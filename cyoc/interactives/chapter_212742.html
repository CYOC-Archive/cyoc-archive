<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The boys look at each other, then they grin, “let&#39;s do it,” they all say.<br />
<br />
Greg smiles, “cool, who wants to go first?”<br />
<br />
“Well, I suggest, since it was YOUR idea,” Eric says, “YOU should go first!”<br />
<br />
Greg looks at the others, who all nod, he shrugs, “okay, let me think, I think I&#39;ll become a Lizard, but which species? Hmmm... .”<br />
<br />
“Well, what species do reside here,” Max asks.<br />
<br />
Greg takes out his phone, “nothing Google can&#39;t answer,” he chuckles, “damn... there are lots of Lizard species... I guess I&#39;ll choose the coolest looking, which would be the “Amazon Race Runner”,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Sounds like a fast Lizard,” Eric says.<br />
<br />
Greg nods, he selects the Lizard and chooses the color green for his scales, for his tummy scales he chooses the color white. “Okay, I got my transformation read,” he says, “who wants to go next?”<br />
<br />
“Me,” Eric says.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Greg says, he scans his friend then asks, “so, what type of big cat do you want to be?”<br />
<br />
“Well, what kind of big cats reside here?”<br />
<br />
“Plenty,” Greg says, “the Jaguar, the Puma, the Ocelot,... .”<br />
<br />
“Hm... I think I&#39;ll become the Jaguar,” Eric says, sounding excited.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Greg says, he selects the cat and then asks, “you want the coloring of your fur to be realistic, or would you like to your fur color be in you favorite colors?”<br />
<br />
Eric thinks for a while, “I think I&#39;d like my fur to be the natural colors,” he says.<br />
<br />
Greg nods, “okay, next?”<br />
<br />
Max raises his hand, “make me a Maned Wolf,” he says, “and I want my fur to be the original colors too!”<br />
<br />
Greg nods, “okay, stored,” he says, “Tyler?”<br />
<br />
“Hm... a Squirrel Monkey,” Tyler says, “I want my fur to be the original colors!”<br />
<br />
Greg nods, “okay... done...,” he says, “okay Dean, your last. What type of bird do you want to be?”<br />
<br />
Dean thinks for a while, “hmm... I think I want to be a blue-and-yellow macaw.”<br />
<br />
Greg nods, “okay... aaaand... all set,” he says, “okay, guys. I set the transformation to be painless, and I set the duration to last for two days. Finally I set our human minds to be dominant, while we have the instincts of the chosen animals, we&#39;ll be able to control them.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds good to us,” Eric says.<br />
<br />
“Let&#39;s do this! I can&#39;t wait,” Max adds, sounding super excited.<br />
<br />
Greg chuckles, “okay... here we go,” he says and pushes the button, “oh... yeah, we should strip. We need our clothes when we change back!”<br />
<br />
They all blush but strip anyway, “he... what the hell,” Eric says, “we are going to see each other naked anyway... so... no big deal.”<br />
<br />
Max suddenly lets out a moan, “I... I think it&#39;s starting,” he says, “s-something is p-pulling... at my t-tailbone... a-and it&#39;s pressing... ugh... against the in-inside of my... j-jeans.” Max hastily fumbles with his jeans, “g-gotta get &#39;em off,” the 15-year-old groans in discomfort and when he finally manages to open his jeans and pull them down, along with his briefs, he lets out a gasp of relief.<br />
<br />
The other boys gasp themselves when they notice a wagging tail growing out of Max&#39;s body, just above his butt. “Holly...,” Eric exclaims, “it actually works?!”<br />
<br />
Greg grins, “told you so,” he says, “cute tail, by the way, Max,” he adds.<br />
<br />
Max, who has turned his head to look at his new body part, turns his head to look at Greg, “th-thanks... I guess,” he says, blushing a little, “having a tail does feel weird, but I like it,” he says, smiling.<br />
<br />
“That is the what matters,” Greg says, smiling back, “the rest of us should get out of our clothes too, I can feel the first change happening to me! My whole body is itching, I think my scales are forming.” He takes off his clothes, the others gasp when they see scales spreading all over Greg&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
Greg notices them staring, “come on, guys,” he says, “strip already, Max and I are already naked!”<br />
<br />
“Oh... y-yeah, s-sorry,” the other boys say, soon all of the boys are naked.<br />
<br />
“I think my tail stopped growing,” Max then says, “but now my body is itching, I guess my fur is starting to grow.”<br />
<br />
“My body is itching too,” Eric says.<br />
<br />
“So is mine,” Tyler says.<br />
<br />
“And mine,” Dean says, he looks down at himself, his eyes widen in surprise when he notices yellow feathers sprouting from his chest, down to his crotch, and blue feathers sprouting from his back and arms. His hair falls out as feathers sprout from his head, he feels feathers grow from just above his butt, he turns his head to look, “man, my tail feathers are so long,” he says, ruffling them and giggling a little.<br />
<br />
Max by now is covered from head to toe in brown and black fur, the boy groans, “I... th-think my f-face is the next to ch-change,” he says. The others watch as Max&#39;s face morphs, his jaw cracking and popping as it slowly pushes out into a muzzle, his nose becomes flat, turning black and moist. His furry ears become pointy and migrate to the top of his head, the boy starts to pant, his tongue slips out of his forming muzzle, long and flat, his teeth fall out as they are replaced by sharp canine teeth.<br />
<br />
“Damn,” Tyler exclaims, “you already look dangerous,” he says.<br />
<br />
Max feels the change end, he grins at Tyler, “hehe... I wish I could see myself,” he says.<br />
<br />
Dean suddenly grunts, “m-man... it... is hard to talk... when you g-grow a... b-beak,” he says, “ha-having no... l-lips feels weird.”<br />
<br />
The others turn to look, Dean&#39;s arms are covered in feathers, his fingers have elongated and look just like feathers, his legs already resemble bird legs and his feet have become talons with sharp claws.<br />
<br />
“You seem to be almost done, Dean,” Greg says, who is almost fully Lizard, his privates have become a cloaca, his tail has grown so long that half of it is on the ground, his eyes have turned yellow and his face has pushed out into a muzzle, while his ears retreated back into his head, leaving two holes.<br />
<br />
Dean nods, “same goes for you, Greg,” he says, “man... you sure have a long tail,” he adds.<br />
<br />
“Hehe, yeah,” Greg replies.<br />
<br />
They suddenly hear a “Mrow,” they turn their heads and gasp, Eric is crouched down, his hands in front of him, “this is AMAZING,” he says, “I feel so powerful, hehe... I feel charged with energy, man this is so coool!”<br />
<br />
Greg smiles, “you look amazing, Eric,” he says, “a little creepy though with those eyes and teeth of yours!”<br />
<br />
“Hehe... it&#39;s amazing,” Eric says, “I can see everything so clearly, as if it were day time!”<br />
<br />
“Good for you, mate,” Greg says, “we others are not gifted with night vision.”<br />
<br />
“Aaaw... no worries,” Eric mews, “I&#39;ll keep a sharp eye out and protect you!”<br />
<br />
“Hehe, thanks,” the others say.<br />
<br />
Soon all of them finish their transformations, “man, this really is amazing,” Max says, checking out his body, poking at his sheath, “hehe... and one part of me defiantly got bigger... rrrr... me like!”<br />
<br />
Dean flaps with his arms, “w-whoa... I feel my body lifting from the ground,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t go to high,” Greg says, “remember, your eyesight isn&#39;t that good!”<br />
<br />
Dean lowers himself back to the ground, “I know,” he says, “I&#39;ll wait until the morning to try out more!”<br />
<br />
“THIS IS FUN,” they hear Eric shout, they look around, but Eric has disappeared.<br />
<br />
“ERIC,” Greg shouts.<br />
<br />
“Hehe... up here,” they hear his reply.<br />
<br />
They all look up and gasp when they spot Eric, sitting on a branch, which looks pretty high off of the ground, “be careful, Eric,” Greg says.<br />
<br />
“Hehe...,” Eric says, “no worries, I know how to keep my balance, I have the instinct of a cat, remember?”<br />
<br />
“Just be careful,” Greg repeats himself.<br />
<br />
“Fine, I&#39;ll come back down,” Eric grumbles, the others watch in amazement Max descend the tree, he looks so graceful and cat-like, the way he moves.<br />
<br />
“Whoa,” they all say, “that actually looked pretty majestic!”<br />
<br />
“Hehe... I AM a majestic critter after all,” Max says.<br />
<br />
“Phew...,” they hear Max say, “did one of you just fart!?”<br />
<br />
“Um...,” the others say.<br />
<br />
Max scowls, “guys, my sense of smell has increased,” he says, he looks over at Tyler, “and I can tell WHO the culprit is.”<br />
<br />
“Who... ME,” Tyler asks, acting all innocent, looking at his friends, grinning when he sees their faces, “okay, okay... I MIGHT have let out a liiiittle bit of “air”,” he chuckles.<br />
<br />
Greg snorts, he then laughs and rolls his eyes, “typical monkey!”<br />
<br />
Tyler sticks out his tongue, “it&#39;s my nature to be cheeky,” the squirrel monkey grins.<br />
<br />
They all laugh, “man...,” Max says, “what a cool way to start our vacation and adventure,” he says.<br />
<br />
The others nod, “I don&#39;t know about you guys,” Eric says, “but I am already dreading turning back to normal. I... I kinda love the new me.”<br />
<br />
Greg walks over to the Jaguar, “hey,” he says, “don&#39;t feel sad. We have two full days as Anthros, so there is still time for each of us to decide what he wants: return to normal, or stay as an Anthro! So, no rush,” he smiles at Eric.<br />
<br />
Eric smiles back, “I know...,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Hey,” Dean says, “let&#39;s get to bed. We&#39;ll have some fun tomorrow and really try out our new bodies,” the others agree, so they all head to bed.</p>
