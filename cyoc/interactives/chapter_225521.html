<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Water as we know is very important for all life. We drink it to sustain ourselves, embrace it to cleanse ourselves, and immerse ourselves in it for entertainment at times. It&#39;s practically everywhere even in small quantities, and will even rain down from the skies occasionally... speaking of the weather lady on the tv said it was going to be raining throughout the month. some days constant pouring, some days a bit of sprinkling, others on and off showers... but rain was coming. Not that anyone in the area would fully know, but the rainwater would start becoming... contaminated in a way... There was a group of wicken burning weird herbs in the forest, an actual witch doing more brewing than usual making more fumes, a secret government lab venting it&#39;s exhaust, and a group of drunk aliens doing something to the atmosphere all combined would leave the rain water with weird properties that would probably change day to day. <br />
That all was somewhat irrelevant as you took your backpack, and umbrella and went on your way to school. As a Sophomore transfer student you mostly kept to yourself finding it hard to start conversations or talk to established groups. Least you lived close to the school as the rain only really started when you were a few feet away from the classroom, downside the school had no indoor halls so you ended up getting a bit wet. You sighed a little as between the rain and your wet clothes it felt like you were getting a bit itchy. Your homeroom teacher &quot;Madam&quot; Lambert was at her desk along with a few other early birds who were trying to finish up some homework or study in the minutes they had till class started. <br />
Madam Lambert said &quot;Welcome, did the rain start already? Why didn&#39;t you use that umbrella?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sorry&quot; you stammered &quot;I was just a few steps from the door when the rain started, I just dashed in&quot;<br />
&quot;Hmph, well get to your seat... and consider shaving more often your looking scruffy.&quot; at that comment you put your hand to your chin and... yeah... there was some stubble there which was odd as you had a hard time growing facial hair... in fact you were a bit of a &quot;late bloomer&quot; as your dad would say. You started scratching a bit more at some of the damper parts on your clothes. Then the next group entered in as some high pitched shrieks ran into the classroom as some of the sophomore cheerleaders that always came together rushed into the area without any rain. Heads turned to the... well not girls anymore... Their clothing was soaked, some a bit see through... not that that was the biggest issue as... Well they were BIGGER. Like they had aged a decade into their twenties, their bodies stretching their clothes to their limit as one of their button up tops had lost SEVERAL buttons already revealing a nice line of cleavage.<br />
One of them said &quot;That rain is coming down FAST! And there&#39;s something weird in it!!!&quot; the group was trying to cover some of their... more prominent features, but it was very apparent that there was something off about the rain if it had rapidly changed them to be buxom beauties. <br />
The next students came in relatively quickly one after the other in states of age. Some were just a bit older having just gotten splashed a bit from under an umbrella, others were in their older twenties or early thirties, and only one student was missing... the guy who rode his motorcycle to school and was held back a few years... Some people were wondering if he aged too much on his bike and... may have gotten into an accident. No one in the classroom knew if the water&#39;s effects were linear or not so... maybe if he was left out in the rain too long... <br />
There was an announcement from the intercom that came out as the principal said &quot;There is some weird effects going on with the weather. It is important we all stay inside until we learn more, and to stay dry.&quot;<br />
One of the cheerleaders muttered &quot;Least the water here seems to have lost it&#39;s effect...&quot; her clothes had been drying a bit, but she hadn&#39;t seemed to have still been aging while the water lingered in her clothes. <br />
The other cheerleader sighed and said &quot;Yeah...&quot; and then took out a sealed water bottle and cracked it open. She took a long drink of nearly half the bottle while sitting and didn&#39;t seem to notice the stares that were going her way. She didn&#39;t grow any bigger or anything. The water bottle wasn&#39;t contaminated by anything. It was just regular tap water, just some normal water with some minerals and stuff in it. However water was known to purify and as it coursed through her veins she seemed to shrink back down to at least mostly normal. Her stretched out clothes ended up being a bit baggy on her now scrawny figure by comparison. and in the following minutes it seemed like a lot of people were trying to get whatever water was available to drink in the class. Although there of course were still those who were enjoying their bigger forms some wanted some of their youth back. <br />
Madam Lambert took a small gavel she used and gave it a smack on her table which quieted everyone up as she said &quot;EVERYONE TO YOUR SEATS!&quot; Everyone went to their seats as she continued &quot;Today a miraculous event has occurred, but we still have a lesson plan to get back to. I&#39;ll try to keep thing more concise today, but we are still here to learn.&quot; She then proceeded with her lesson plan, and at the end the period bell had rang and... the rain was outside. Some people had umbrellas, you also had an umbrella but you were afraid of getting it stolen considering EVERYTHING. Would the school make you all go outside like this?</p>
