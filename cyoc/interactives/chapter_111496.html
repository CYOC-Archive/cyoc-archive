<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lyre didn&#39;t have much of an airport. In fact it wasn&#39;t much more than a simple airfield that was large enough for small connecting flights at the largest. Most of the planes that were there were usually small crop dusters or firefighting aircraft to drop canisters of water from the air. However, the size didn&#39;t really mater as the smaller two engine passenger jet came in for a steady and safe landing. The runway was long enough and there were large enough hangers for it. The plane taxied toward the main terminal and came to a stop while grounds crew rolled a older looking staircase up to the plane&#39;s passenger door, which opened and the passengers began to disembark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... that was fun,&quot; Julia Wesley said to her husband as they reached the ground, &quot;Nice relaxation... lots of pine trees to smell...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A wonderful mate to make ever so happy,&quot; Thomas Wesley replied as he took his wife in his arms  and smiled to her as they walked in.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that went both ways,&quot; Julia said with a smile as she rubbed the bottom of Thomas&#39; muzzle with one paw.<br />
<br />
The two of them smiled at the memories they&#39;d shared over the past week. The trip to Alaska was fun and they got to enjoy a great many sights that were worth taking pictures of to bring back and show to Sarah and Malice. They got to see thick forests on calm hiking trails, and even got to see some wildlife, thankfully from a distance that there was no danger to them or any others on the hiking trails with them. There were a fair number of people who asked questions about Animalians, but both of them answered the questions with a smile and felt a fair amount of pride and happiness in what they were. There was a real part of Julia&#39;s mind that wasn&#39;t fully at ease with becoming an anthro-husky, but she would always love Thomas and he would always love her, and it had produced some perks that she admitted she liked. She liked being back in the prime of her youth and she liked the sexual energy that she and Thomas had gained, and since it was a second honeymoon, the two of them had had a lot of adult fun while they were out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, all that&#39;s left is to wait at the baggage claim and then we can head home and see how our girls made out,&quot; Thomas smiled to his wife, &quot;and hopefully they haven&#39;t made us grandparents, yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julia nodded, though she absentmindedly rubbed her own stomach for a moment with her other paw.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;You can relax, Travis,&quot; Malice said to the young uplifted Dalmatian as he paced the Wesley living room, &quot;Really... you&#39;re being as nervous as Sarah was at even asking you out!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary Alice!&quot; Sarah protested to her adopted sister and shoved at Malice&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I was perfectly fine with asking Travis out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I seem to remember Sophie and I having to convince you that his parents wouldn&#39;t reject you as a suitor for their son,&quot; Malice countered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, so maybe I was as nervous about their accepting me as both Travis and I were about going out... but mom and dad won&#39;t be freaked,&quot; Sarah answered.<br />
<br />
And Sarah did feel confident about that. Travis&#39;s parents had been very accepting and had approved of her dating Travis. Their only requirement with Sarah was that she not give Travis his second dose until after they knew that Sarah&#39;s parents approved of the pairing and that the two families were able to have dinner together. They also wished that Sarah remain on her birth control pills until after High School at the earliest as well, but since Sarah told them that was also something that her own parents wanted, Travis&#39;s parents didn&#39;t make that one of their mandatory issues. So, in the days after the Saturday party, while Sarah and Travis were able to walk and talk and enjoy a few dates, they hadn&#39;t been able to do much more than kiss and hold hands.<br />
<br />
Their dates had gone fairly well, and Malice even gave them some space to enjoy time together, though for the most part, their dates ended up being the two of them sprawled out on the floor at the Wesley home or at Fleck family home near the Lyre firehouse doing their homework. Now, though, with word that their parents would be arriving, Sarah and Malice agreed that their welcome home for their parents would also include introducing Travis to Julia and Thomas. Travis agreed, but that didn&#39;t necessarily confident with it. He had been fairly shy with regard to actually asking Sarah out before the great party the past Saturday because of the fact that she and Malice were so mature, sexy, and strong, and as only a single doser, he wasn&#39;t. The fact that Sarah had actually liked him improve his confidence with Sarah and even with Malice, but he was now a bit nervous that Sarah&#39;s parents wouldn&#39;t think he could provide for Sarah or be good for her because of the fact that he looked so much younger and smaller than her.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... they won&#39;t say I&#39;m not good enough for you...&quot; Travis asked a bit nervously, &quot;Will they?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, they won&#39;t,&quot; Sarah answered, &quot;in fact the fact that you&#39;re a single doser might put them at ease... as I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll want me even giving you your second dose until after you&#39;ve grown and matured to the point where you wouldn&#39;t need a second dose.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malice gave a nod with a heavy sigh, which Sarah knew was related to the fact that Malice had been more active in looking for a mate than she was. Sarah glanced to her sister and then got up and moved to approach Travis who hadn&#39;t stopped pacing yet. She managed to catch him and pull him into a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Sarah assured him, &quot;things will be fine. You&#39;ve been nice and Malice and I will be there to vouch for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah then softly licked Travis&#39;s cheek, which made him smile and wag his tail.  That finally got him to stop pacing, by which point all three of them heard the doorknob start to turn. Sarah backed off a bit and Malice rose to stand by her sister, while Travis stood nervously, wondering if Sarah&#39;s parents would be protective of their baby girl, even if she was physically a mature &quot;woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah! Malice! We&#39;re home!&quot; Julia called as she came through the door, &quot;we picked up some take out steaks on the way home so...&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas came shortly after Julia, but both of them came to a sudden stop when they noticed Travis standing by Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, mom, dad,&quot; Sarah said slowly, &quot;Did you have a good time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We did...&quot; Thomas answered as he recovered enough to shut the door, &quot;who is this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Travis,&quot; Sarah answered, &quot;You said you wanted to meet anyone Malice and I wanted to date before things got serious... and Travis has been a friend and we were working on homework before you guys got home... so... Malice and I figured to introduce you to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Travis Fleck, pleased to meet you, sir,&quot; Travis said to Thomas, his tail held down between his legs as he did his best to look submissive to Thomas Wesley, as the male anthro husky was easily bigger than the three female anthro huskies.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s only a single doser,&quot; Julia said slowly, noting the size difference between the Wesley family and Travis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... the only other uplifted dogs that were around that I could have double dosed off of when I was uplifted were my parents at the firehouse,&quot; Travis said slowly, &quot;and well... I... uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t wish to mate with your own parents, I take it,&quot; Julia surmised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Travis said nervously as Julia and Thomas both traded glances.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... this is certainly a surprise for a welcome home,&quot; Thomas said to Sarah, &quot;but we do thank you for abiding by our wishes to meet with anyone you wish to date before things go beyond holding hands.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah wagged her tail as while her parents seemed a bit surprised, the ultimately seemed okay with Travis. She reached over for Travis&#39;s far shoulder to pull him toward her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like to stay for dinner, Travis?&quot; Julia asked to him, &quot;we would like to know a little bit about you... Or do you have to get back to the firehouse?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The fire department bought a building next to it for my parents after we were all uplifted,&quot; Travis answered, &quot;we live there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like to stay for dinner?&quot; Julia repeated the question. A part of her had been anxious that Sarah or Malice might try to get around their rules regarding dating, but the fact that Travis was only a single doser was enough to ease her fears and the house looked in good shape. In that, she felt okay with accepting Sarah dating the young Dalmatian, but she was interested in learning a bit more about him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Travis said slowly, &quot;Let me call my folks...&quot;</p>
