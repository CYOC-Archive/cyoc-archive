<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Candy. Take off your clothes now. You are ripping them apart.&quot; Amanda yelled.<br />
<br />
The small childish had two pea sized nipple making their presense while candy&#39;s white panties were showing under the dress. Candy went to panic mode as she started to have hard time breathing and with help with her mother. They had to cut both of clothes with scissors while only leaving Candy with her panties.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whew. Are you okay dear?&quot; Amanda asked huffing Candy. &quot;We need to get you some-&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda paused as she noticed that the couple of minutes spent on opening the shirt had made her much younger. For some reason Amanda was shorter and more childlike than her daugter who was approaching her early 20s steadily. The white crop top was getting too big and the pants with the panties had fallen down moments ago.<br />
<br />
Candy in disoriented state on the floor. Looked scared as her mother was shrinking too fast. Amanda begun to scream as her body had lost it&#39;s last pieces of hair and she couldn&#39;t walk or talk. Candy in other hand had gained more features and looked more curvier than her mother. She crawled next to her mother and begun to hold her like a baby on the lap. Amanda tried reaching her hand to the air while Candy was trying her best to open her mouth.<br />
<br />
Both of them were flabbergasted as everything happened so fast. Amanda suddenly vanished suddenly and painful gut punching feeling overwhelmed Candy as she felt her expanding stomach growing to a size of beach ball.<br />
<br />
&quot;STOP! IT HURTS!&quot; Candy yelled as the ballooning belly deflated a little bit.<br />
<br />
Candy begun to weep on the ground as she hold the stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom! Mom!&quot; She yelled and patted her stomach for a response. &quot;What&#39;s going on!? Why is my mom inside my belly!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then Candy&#39;s ears begun to ring and she started to see weird flashing pictures and colors. Like a movie reel being sped up inside her mind. She couldn&#39;t make out what she was hearing, but at the same time understood more and more. These were memories of someone&#39;s life. Because of the odd circumstances both Candy and Amanda had shared their lives and these films she was seeing were her mother&#39;s memories and knowledge. Filling Candy&#39;s brain full of skills, mannerisms and picture of places where she haven&#39;t been or people she never met.<br />
<br />
The headaching ringing stopped and Candy fell once more to the ground. She passed out as she closed her darkned eyes.<br />
<br />
The next time she opened her eyes. It was middle of night. No-one nearby her. She was in hospital bed while her mother&#39;s clothes were folded next to her on top of a chair. She could feel by touch that she was wearing a hospital gown, but something felt different. Beside the belly she felt more &#39;adult&#39; for strange reason, but at the same time couldn&#39;t move a muscle.<br />
<br />
&#39;So this is what it&#39;s like to be an adult feels like.&#39; She whispered to herself and closed her eyes once more.<br />
<br />
As the morning sun rose from the window. Someone was come to observe her. Candy had no idea who he was and asked who they were.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m doctor Silver. What&#39;s yours?&quot; The doctor greeted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Candy. Candy Smith.&quot; Candy greeted back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see, I see. What&#39;s the last thing you remember Candy?&quot; Doctor Silver asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure. I went to this weird carnival with my mother and we had fun and-&quot; Candy started to explain and told doctor the whole thing what had just occured.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, so is this person in this driver&#39;s license your mother and the said mother is now inside your belly? And that you are actually 9-years-old.&quot; the doctor confirmed as he wrote something on a paper on a clipboard while quickly pulling Amanda&#39;s license from the wallet which was inside the capri pant&#39;s pocket.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Candy. Could you tell me your father&#39;s name?&quot; The doctor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy? I just call him daddy, but my mother calls him Joshua. Sometimes.&quot; Candy said. &quot;I also have two brother. Would like to know their names too?&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy and doctor had a little back and forth conversation which concluded as doctor excused himself off the room. That is when a horrible thought came to Candy&#39;s mind and echoing voice telling her that the doctor was evil and that he thought Candy was lying. She should quickly go back to the tent with the age changing room before something bad happens.<br />
<br />
Candy begun to sweat as part of her brain trusted the doctor for no reason, but half of it made her think that he was going to do or say something weird. Something weird was going on, but she couldn&#39;t pinpoint a reason for these worrying thought. She started ti see her mother trapped inside a hourglass. Sleeping inside the glass casket and shrinking.<br />
<br />
Candy rose up from the bed and walked to the window to clear her thoughts. Candy saw that the carnival was far a away from her. The tent&#39;s tip could be seen from the window, but the journey there by foor would be take a long time. Then as she was about to go back to the bed. She felt something. The belly had shrunk down.<br />
<br />
She raised the gown and noticed that she was right. The belly has slowly but surely begun to shrink down.<br />
<br />
&quot;My mom didn&#39;t say stop!&quot; Candy said out loud. &quot;My mom is still regressing inside my womb.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were a lot of thing inside Candy&#39;s mind, but one thing was now certain. She had to go back to the carnival and somehow stop her mother&#39;s de-aging further.</p>
