<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">  Ryan&#39;s mother drove him to school.  She wasn&#39;t happy about it, and was not shy about letting it be known.  What had gotten into the twins? She asked rhetorically. First they&#39;re drinking, then she hears them arguing this morning, and now they leave without Ryan! They might be 18 but as long as they live in her house they&#39;ll follow the rules, or face the consequences. She could still ground them, she informed no one in particular.  Ryan was too busy reliving that morning in his head to pay much attention to his mothers rant.  The looks on the twins faces was priceless, not to mention them turning on each other like they did.  Ryan had never seen Mike and Aaron bicker like that, let alone throw each other under the bus.  They really cared a lot about there ding dongs.  Ryan grinned, all this and he&#39;d only just begun to change them.<br />
<br />
They made it to the high school, Ryan thanked his mother for the ride before heading into the building.  The hallways were still full, but there wasn&#39;t much time before first period. Ryan&#39;s first thought was I have to hurry or I&#39;ll get detention for being tardy.  As he made his way to his locker, he saw more than a few people staring, small groups of friends huddled close whispering only to stop and check out Ryan before going back to furious conversation.  The hallway was loud, but Ryan was sure he had made out &quot;baby&#39;s arm holding an apple&quot; as he passed one group.  He made it to his locker and Charlie was there waiting for him.  &quot;Dude! I thought you weren&#39;t going to make it!&quot; Charlie exclaimed. Ryan started giving his reason for being late, but Charlie didn&#39;t stop to listen. &quot;Ok so the only thing anyone is talking about is you at the pool&quot; Charlie continued, &quot;Ally tried to keep it all quiet but the other girls talked and everyone knows you&#39;re umm...gifted.&quot; Charlie stopped and looked at the outline in Ryan&#39;s pants, &quot;no one even cares about the bonfire anymore&quot;. Ryan blushed, everyone knew? For a second he was embarrassed and concerned, before he reminded himself this is what he wanted. This why, in part at least, he was doing this. Ryan smiled again. &quot;Come on we&#39;re going to be late&quot; Ryan beamed. The two friends headed towards their classes together until the hallways split, Charlie went left and Ryan continued on straight ahead.  <br />
<br />
Even with a little extra hustle, Ryan did not make it to History on time. The stern old teacher showed no mercy when Ryan failed to present a valid pass for being late, it would be detention.  Ryan had never had detention, he didn&#39;t know what to make of this situation.  He shuffled to his seat.  Good grades and being a good student were all Ryan he thought before correcting himself, they were all he had. If anything maybe detention will help his reputation, this is what he wanted.  <br />
<br />
The next couple hours of the day went by easily enough.  Ryan was knew everything they were learning already so he kept his attention on who was trying to steal glances of his new improved junk. Several cheerleaders, a few of the pom squad, more guys than Ryan would have thought.  Ryan had PE right before lunch, they were swimming that day playing a game of water polo.  Ryan headed into the gym teacher, coach French&#39;s, office. &quot;Couch I can&#39;t swim today, my suit was, uhh, lost this weekend and I haven&#39;t had time to get another yet.&quot; Ryan reported.  Wordlessly, coach French walked over to a cabinet labeled &#39;Swim Team&#39; opened it up and threw Ryan one of the team&#39;s trademark white speedo&#39;s.  You can wear this or take detention with me after school today to make up the class. Was double detention a thing? Could he actually make Ryan make up a class? It was just PE after all. Ryan took the speedo and headed to the Boy&#39;s locker room. For the third time today, he had reminded himself that this is what he wanted. The locker room was filed with the sounds of excitement. Everyone loved swim days.  Ryan got to his locker, which was as far from everyone else as one could be over around the corner, and started to change. Socks and shoes off then pants and underwear, suit on before finally his shirt came off. He was finished in less than 30 seconds.  He looked down at the loaner swimsuit.  This couldn&#39;t be legal he thought.  The spandex material was straining against the size of his flaccid member He didn&#39;t know best to adjust himself. After a while he gave up trying, the beast was visible no matter how he positioned it. Ryan rounded the corner heading towards the towel bin and the door, and the room fell silent.  &quot;holy fuck dude&quot; from some guy whose name Ryan had never learned.  The locker room erupted again.  The guys circle around Ryan, &quot;let us see it&quot;, &quot;Pull it out&quot;, &quot;does it grow&quot;, &quot;what do you feed it?&quot; Came pouring towards Ryan.  &quot;I&#39;ll whip it out, if you all do the same&quot; he offered, not quite sure if that was actually what he wanted. This was all knew to Ryan and he didn&#39;t know how to act.  There was a pause again before the guy right in front of Ryan dropped his shorts, the others quickly followed and Ryan was forced to live up to his end of the bargain.  Ryan looked around at the collection of below average dicks in front of him and felt superior.  There were a few guys who even dipped down in size to his old pathetic tool.  All eyes and comments were on the log between Ryan&#39;s legs.  &quot;It gets bigger&quot; Ryan offered, which brought on another wave of discussion.  Couch French knocked, &quot;hurry it up in there&quot;  on the door and in a flash everyone had their suits up and were heading to the door.  The &quot;holy fuck dude&quot; kid introduced himself, &quot;Hi, I&#39;m Bryan, I don&#39;t know if we&#39;ve met. I wish I had one like that. You must be 5 times as big as I am hard, soft&quot; Ryan smiled, &quot;We can&#39;t all be this lucky&quot; before passing through the door and cannon balled into the pool. <br />
<br />
Ryan came up from under the water and looked around, he saw his brother, Aaron on the far side of the pool practicing with some members of the swim team.  Ryan thought how unfair it was that they got to use their PE and any study hall periods they had to come swim, just because they were on the team.  Aaron didn&#39;t look happy, as he pulled his body out of the water, his stubby cock at full mast pointing out and up from his body.  Thats embarrassing, Ryan thought to himself, taking an evil pleasure in it.  The water polo game was hard work.  Ryan made a mental note to increase his endurance and bulk up a little more next time he had the chance.  More than a few times during struggles for the ball, he felt an unknown hand grab his dick. A few times he caught an impressed looking girl sheepishly trying to get away.  The game ended in a 2-2 tie and it was time to change again.  <br />
<br />
The guys all filed into the locker room and where joined by the three members of the swim team who&#39;d been practicing. Everyone stripped down to shower, at first the tile room echoed with an incoherent babble of different conversations. Then there was some giggling, and whispering. Ryan had been shampooing his hair when the change occurred, he rinsed and opened his eyes to see what had caused the change. He realized Aaron was at the pedestal shower across from him.  The other guys were taking advantage of the easy comparison.  One of the other swim team guys spoke up, &quot;Aaron, you got screwed man&quot; he said with a giggle. This made the whole room erupt in laugher. Ryan put on a stern face, and admonished the room, &quot;leave my little brother, alone,&quot; grabbing and shaking his fire hose cock while using his other hand to point at Aaron&#39;s hard dick.  Aaron looked like he might cry, he didn&#39;t even shut off the shower, he just walked out. When Ryan got out into the locker room he was already gone. Ryan got dressed and ready for lunch.</p>
