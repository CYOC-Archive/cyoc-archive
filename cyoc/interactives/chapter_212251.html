<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After watching the hot make out/work out session in the home gym, I made my way back to my living room, intending to explore the expanded space. Instead, the front door opened and in walked two more men. The first one I noticed was a younger looking guy with quaffed brown hair. He stood at around 5’7”, and had a sheen of sweat you could see on his skin. He was wearing a loose low-cut tank top with grey sweat pants. He had a slightly muscular build, and walked in with confidence. As soon as he noticed me, his eyes lit up and he bounded toward me, pressing his face into my chest as he reached me. “I missed you so much… and I’m so horny, I just wanna…” He reached around and grabbed my ass. I was slightly taken aback by how forward he was being, but soon felt his cock press against my leg, I could feel it was longer than a typical straight guys. ‘Probably bisexual’, I thought to myself.<br />
“I didn’t get to bang any of the customers today, and they were so hot, could I borrow one of the other guys? Please?” He pleaded with me. <br />
I looked over at the other guy who just walked in. He was a shorter guy, shorter than the one clinging to me, and had the darker complexion of a man on Hispanic descent. He sported a bushy beard, and his hair was tied into a ponytail. He had a clearly stocky build you could see through the plaid flannel shirt and jeans he had on. He was moving toward the kitchen, striking a conversation with Kevin. I turned my attention back to the man clinging to me, who had begun rubbing his cock against me, through our clothes. <br />
“Well, how about Connor? I think I’d like to watch that.” He grabbed my hand and began dragging me back toward the gym, where Connor was drying his upper body off with a towel. He looked toward the two of us and gave us a smile. “Hey Mark, how was work today?” <br />
“Rough, I didn’t get to fuck any of the customers today, and I danced my ass off! Speaking of…” Mark looked at me, waiting for me to announce what I had just told him.<br />
“I decided that after dinner, Mark here is going to fuck you. He needs some release and I’d like to see you participate today.”<br />
Connor nodded, not seeming to mind that I just told him he was about to have gay sex. “Is that all? That seems fine.” <br />
I thought about it for a minute before responding. “Well… how about until then, I want you to flirt with him too. Really get him in the mood, you know?” Connor looked toward Mark and smirked. “Oh I think I can do that.” He winked at Mark and bounced his pecs for a moment. “I think I’m going to go change before dinner. I’ll see you soon.” Connor moved past us to his room, slapping Mark on the ass as he did. Mark turned toward me and looked at me with excitement. “Thank you Jason! You’re the best gay ever!” He kissed me on the neck before walking off toward the bathroom.<br />
I walked back toward the living room, where Kevin and who I assumed to be Ash, the last guy I hadn’t identified, were making the table for dinner. There were six spots, but only five had food in front of them. I sat down at the head of the table, deciding to be the first to arrive. Shortly after, Carter walked in, having taken a shower and smelled clean. He was wearing athletic shorts and an oversized white T-shirt that hid his pumped muscle well. He sat to my left and looked to me. “Should we eat now or do you want to wait for everyone?” I told him he could eat if he wanted, and he quickly began eating his steak with ravenous fervor. Ash and Kevin sat down shortly after, and I told Ash he could eat now, while Kevin sat with a smile, still feeling full from the dinner I provided earlier. <br />
Conner walked in, wearing a surprising outfit. I had expected him to wear an outfit similar to Carter’s’, but instead he was wearing only a G-string that looked a little under filled in the front, but the strings were pulled incredibly tight. His body was on full display, and he looked a bit shy about it but was trying to fulfill my request as best he could.<br />
Ash spoke up. “Flirting with Mark today, eh, mi amigo?” Connor froze and blushed. Ash continued to speak. “Isn’t that Mark’s work clothes? You’re really going all out.”<br />
Connor replied, “Yeah, I uh… I really want to stick around, so…” He adjusted the fabric around his small cock before moving towards one of the chairs, picking it up and taking it away. He returned without the chair and spent a moment fixing his hair before sitting in the remaining chair. <br />
Mark walked in, clean and a bit wet from his shower, wearing only a pair of short athletic shorts that put his erection on display. He has thin, lithe muscles on his body, giving him a dancers build. Mark looked around for a chair before asking “Where is my seat?” Connor replied by smacking his thigh. “Right here, big guy.” Mark excitedly sat on Connor’s lap and put his arms around him. Connor leaned in and kissed Mark’s neck before continuing. “I figured you’d appreciate being fed by me, and then later you can feed me. How does that sound?”<br />
Mark responded by placing his lips on Connors’, pressing hard into the kiss. “I would love that.” Mark said, after pulling out of the kiss. Connor smiled and brought a bite of food to Mark’s mouth.<br />
For the rest of dinner, I was entranced by Connor’s flirting, and clearly Mark was thrilled. Connor continued to feed Mark abs himself, occasionally dropping food in himself on purpose, and asking Mark if he wanted to clean him up. At one point, when Connor was going to drink some of his beer, he spilled it on Mark on purpose, and quickly moved to begin lapping the spilled beer off Mark’s chest. Mark moaned in ecstasy as Connor’s tongue ran up and down his torso. Once again, I felt myself get hard watching the display.<br />
When the plates were cleaned, Connor stood up, carrying Mark in his arms. “I think it’s time you give me a little something, right?” Mark nodded. I stood up and added “Let’s go to my room, you two can use my bed.” Connor nodded and began carrying Mark to my bedroom, while I followed closely behind. I closed the door behind me, and sat in the nice seat in the corner, getting ready to watch the show.</p>
