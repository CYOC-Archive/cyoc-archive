<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At last the Blonde's pushing won out and Ken walked or was pushed over to the huge slot machine setting in the middle of the Casino. The usual crowd of onlookeds those who can't afford tossing a $100 bucks per spin watched as others who could tried their luck.<br />
<br />
Ken stood with the pushy Blonde nagging him to play but he wanted to watch those ahead and see if there be something not quite right.<br />
<br />
Another round of strong drinks were ordered by the Blonde and when they came Ken took hers and gave his to the Blonde. It was iced Ginger Ale that she was drinking and his by her look as she swallowed the mixture was quite stout.<br />
<br />
Drunks don't have good and clear thoughts when playing or driving! <br />
<br />
Ken wanted his mind clear of booze and able to think and watch what was happening. A Lady dressed in gown and jewels stepped up to the slot machine just then. She took the oversized $100. dollar chip and inserted it into the slot. A hearty pull down of the oversized pull arm sent the machine tumbling the little pictures.<br />
<br />
Lights flashed, the machine player the theme song to the Tv show Jeopardy and those little pictures spun away. <br />
<br />
Click, click, click, and a big gong went bong as the little picture lined up but showed three nanny goats with oversized udders. Rattling out the winners shute came a long leather strap and a silver bell attached. <br />
<br />
The half drunken lady picked up her small prize and grumbling she'd been had walked off to the bar.<br />
<br />
Next came a tall man with a western type hat looking like some cattle barron of the old west. He too put in his token and cracked the big arm making the machine turn and sing.<br />
<br />
Click, click, click, went the machine as from the payout slot came a ton of thousand dolllar chips. He was a big winner that hour and had recieved his big luck story as when counted he'd won $225,000. of the possible one million inside the machine.<br />
<br />
Jumping up and down in her five inch spike high heels the Blonde was getting quite drunk on the drink Ken was supposed to have drank. He looked at her red eyes and gave her a token to play. <br />
<br />
Stepping up she handed her almost gone drink and glass to the security man standing next to the machine. In went the token and with a sadly poor pull of the machine's arm she watched the pictures turn very slowly. <br />
<br />
Click,.......click,.....click, went the machine as the little pictures spun and locked one by one into place. <br />
<br />
The Blonde looked in odd face at the pictures her blurred vision making her stand close to the machine and tilt her head as she gazed through watery eyes. <br />
<br />
There before her was three pictures of Carrot.<br />
<br />
Then from the payout slot came a rattling sound as she put out her little hands for the welcomed payout. <br />
<br />
Rattle, rattle, and plop into her hands was a silver chain necklace and hung on the middle a one inch large gold Carrot.<br />
<br />
She looked up at the man running the machine and then to Ken exclaiming she'd been had! Ken smiled reminding her it was his $100. bucks and with her the winner he turned and walked away leaving her crying about the cheap prize.<br />
<br />
Walking away Ken heard the machine played again but this time when the numbers came up the prize winner,a young girl was with her winnings rushed off by the guard.<br />
<br />
Tired of his Ginger Ale drink Ken went to the bar and asked for a draft beer. The Bartender looked at him in strange face then told him that he'd have to go to the Club to get those kind of drinks. He tossed Ken a menu of drinks he'd make and stated that in the Casino's Bar we serve people!<br />
<br />
Ken ordered a Manhatten and sat there sipping his drink and munching on the free pretzils. <br />
<br />
Suddenly from the far end of the long Walnut bar came the scream of a woman. Cursing she was sounding very angry about something, maybe she'd spilled her drink? <br />
<br />
A security Guard came quickly as ken walked with his drink in hand down the long bar just to see what was going on. Oddly there was not a crowd about her and the guard. Instead the Guard was cuffing the lady with her arms behind her back as she lay face down on the floor.<br />
<br />
Ken remembered the gown of that lady who won the leather strap and its small medallion back at the big slot machine. He wondered if it was the strong drink but her legs which stuck out from under the gown looked quite hairy. Her shoes kicked off showing her shaggy legs and also hair covered feet ending in what looked like a cloven hoof.<br />
<br />
The Guard rolled her face up as the lady continued to yell about her condition. Ken looked at the angry lady her hair which was a dark red was now streaked with lines of gray and white. her eyebrows hard grown together making one brow but colored in an odd shade of gray. <br />
<br />
Her nose was turned up showing more nostril as her lips were red with lipstick before but had a blacker look now. Even her face looked like she needed a shave as the gray and black hairs were sprouting all about the ladies' face.<br />
<br />
Ken tried to ask the Guard what her problem was but got pushed away.<br />
<br />
Picking the lady up to standing as best she tried on cloven hooves the Guard pushed her through a door at the far end of the bar. <br />
<br />
Screaming her last yells for help from anybody willing the door closed behind her and the Guard leaving the Casino Bar a quite place to drink  once more.</p>
