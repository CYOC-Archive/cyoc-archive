<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake smiles. &quot;I&#39;m sure I will. I love surprises. And I love exploring new things with you. I can&#39;t wait to see what you have in mind for next week&#39;s Sunday.&quot; He hugs her. &quot;I love you, Alice.&quot; Alice kisses him. &quot;And I love you. I have an idea for a non-sexual transformation that we could do before we sleep. How about we transform into a pair of plush toys? We could cuddle and snuggle with each other and it would be so cute and cuddly.&quot; She grins at Jake. &quot;What do you think, my dear?&quot; Jake hugs her. &quot;That sounds so sweet. But I&#39;m not sure if it would result in much cuddling. Two plush toys sitting on top of our bed.&quot; Alice giggles. &quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t think about that. But I have another idea. Let&#39;s see what the Transform-O-Matic&#39;s software suggests when we try to transform one of us into a full animated plush toy that is able to move freely and such. Would you mind if I test it with you?&quot; He kisses her on her cheek. &quot;Oh no, not at all. I&#39;m curious, too. As long as you don&#39;t transform me without me consenting to the preview I&#39;m fine with you trying to find out what the software would suggest.&quot; He watches her taking the laptop and then typing her ideas into the text field: &#39;A teddy bear with long fluffy fur, just about one foot tall that is able to move freely in every way&#39; Then Alice selects him as the transformee and clicks on the button that creates the preview that shows what the software suggests. Alice likes what she sees. &quot;It looks so cute and cuddly. And it&#39;s exactly what I had in mind. A teddy bear with long fluffy fur, just about one foot tall that is able to move freely in every way. And it&#39;s you.&quot; She looks at Jake. &quot;What do you think, my dear? Do you want to be this cute and cuddly teddy bear?&quot; Jake looks at the preview and smiles. &quot;Yeah, very cuddly! And what would you want to become? Another teddy bear? Or would you think it would be boring if we were both teddies?&quot; Alice thinks for a moment. &quot;I think it would be fun if I became a plush unicorn. That way we could have a cute and cuddly adventure together.&quot; She smiles at Jake. &quot;Does that sound good for you? Do you want to be a teddy bear and me a plush unicorn?&quot; Before he can answer she adds another question. &quot;And by the way would you want to be powered by electric servos or rather a pneumatic system? You know our Transform-O-Matic&#39;s software can only transform us into inanimate objects. More or less inanimate. It suggests to transform you into a little robot with the shape of a teddy bear and therefore it wants me to make a choice between those two systems.&quot; The first question is easy for Jake to answer. &quot;Oh, yes, I&#39;d love to cuddle with you as a plush unicorn. But I have no idea what to choose for my internal system. What are the options with them? And would I be powered by battery? Or what? Oh, and why wasn&#39;t that a question when I transformed you into the fuck machine and myself into the mobile pussy?&quot; Alice giggles. &quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t think about that. Let&#39;s see...&quot; She checks in the history. &quot;Ah, we were both powered by internal lithium batteries. It says that we were fully charged in the beginning and when we transformed back you had spent about 3% of your battery&#39;s capacity and I had spent about 5%. And we were both driven by electric servos except for your vagina. That had a pneumatic system to make it able to tighten and clench.&quot; Alice notices that she&#39;s getting aroused just by thinking about this episode but she doesn&#39;t want to give that too much room right now. &quot;OK, it is possible to select a battery with more capacity but that results in more overall weight and what is more important, a more bulky body to give room for the battery cells. And here in the help text they write that servos create more audible noise when they move but only when they move and a pneumatic system&#39;s pump is almost constantly running to provide pressure but is overall a quieter system at the expense of not always being as precise as servos when it comes to exact movements.&quot; Jake is a bit overwhelmed. &quot;That&#39;s a lot of technical info. I didn&#39;t expect to become an engineer prior transforming into a moving teddy bear. Do you have an idea what you want to choose for your plush unicorn transformation?&quot; Alice thinks for a moment. &quot;I think I would like to be powered by a pneumatic system. That way I can be more quiet and precision in my movements might be sufficient for a plush unicorn. And I think I would like to have a battery with a bit more capacity. Just to have enough energy for the whole night.&quot; She looks at Jake. &quot;And yes, that&#39;s lots of options to choose from if you just want to be cuddly and moving at the same time. But hey, we could also just try and see if we like the results. We&#39;re not limited on how many transformations we can do.&quot; Jake takes a deep breath. &quot;You&#39;re right. We don&#39;t have to set up everything beforehand, we can experiment. Like we did when we transformed into the green spandex cylinder.&quot; He brushes over her inner thigh lightly. &quot;And maybe it would be a good starting point to equip myself with a pneumatic pump or something similar. So, I go for this option. For the battery... I have no idea how much energy we would need. Is there anything in the software&#39;s help text that could give a hint on that? And by the way, what do you actually plan to do if you want to have enough energy to last the whole night?&quot; He looks at her mischievously. Alice giggles. &quot;Oh, you know me. I always have some ideas for the night.&quot; She winks at Jake. &quot;But let&#39;s see what the software suggests for the battery. Ah, here it is. It says here that with the configuration we&#39;ve chosen for you, a standard battery can provide about five to seven hours of continuous use. And it also says that the battery life will vary depending on the intensity of the movement. OK, you&#39;re not going to run yourself at full power all the time, especially since we want to be cuddly and cuddle more than being active. So, I think a standard battery should be enough for us. And if not, we can always recharge ourselves.&quot; She shows him the option of adding a USB charging socket. &quot;Oh, recharge. That could be quite useful. But this time I&#39;m afraid that I&#39;ll be asleep when I run out of energy and therefore won&#39;t recharge in time.&quot; He thinks for a moment, then asks Alice, &quot;What kind of way were you thinking of transforming us back? Like you did before, with the command to the Transform-O-Matic via Mental Link?&quot; Alice nods. &quot;Yes, that&#39;s what I was thinking. We can give the Transform-O-Matic the command to transform us back via Mental Link. And we can also set a time limit for the transformation. That way we don&#39;t have to worry about running out of energy and not being able to transform back.&quot; She smiles at Jake. Jake agrees with her, &quot;Yes, and because we will stay more or less in the same spot on the bed it won&#39;t be a problem because we&#39;d always stay within the range of the beam that will transform us back.&quot; He grins. &quot;OK, let&#39;s do this. I&#39;m excited to be a cuddly teddy bear and to cuddle with you as a plush unicorn.&quot; Alice smiles. &quot;I&#39;m excited too. Let&#39;s just check everything again and then we&#39;ll get started.&quot; She checks the settings for the transformation and makes sure that everything is set up correctly. She sets the time limit for the transformation to ten hours and makes sure that the Mental Link is activated. Then she looks at Jake. &quot;Are you ready, my dear?&quot; Jake hesitates. &quot;Let me just finish my beer and go to the bathroom. Then I&#39;ll be ready. Meet you in the bedroom?&quot; Alice nods. &quot;Sure, I&#39;ll be waiting for you in the bedroom.&quot; She goes to the bedroom and sets up the Transform-O-Matic. She makes sure that everything is set up correctly and that the Mental Link is activated. Then she sits down on the bed and waits for Jake.</p>
