<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Carl pressed the going &quot;Up&quot; button, and entered the elevator. So far, he wasn't enjoying this at all, but that <br />
wasn't any surprise to him. This was Wendy's dream, his penance. Whatever made her happy and him miserable was <br />
the only fair way to make up for the neglectful behavior of the past few years. Now he would be stuck in a <br />
house with her for three months, unable to get away from her at all. Talk about cabin fever. He set his mind <br />
to the last minute fishing trip he had with Steve the other day. It was nice and idyllic, out in the boonies, <br />
away from all this nonsense. Wendy restoring his youth had done a world of good for him, as he had more <br />
energetic then than he had been in at least five years. When the elevator opened up on the fifth floor, he <br />
exited to find a well lit and well furnished hallway. Downwards, he saw the maid vacuuming. Waving, the maid <br />
made a little wave back at Carl, and then went back to her business.<br />
<br />
Carl unlocked the first door on the right, and it opened sesame. The room itself was easy enough on the eyes. <br />
Carl had spent enough times in hotels to know the ins and outs of them. This one was very, very decent. Not as <br />
nice as the luxury suite that he and Wendy had in Las Vegas, but it was still pretty damn good. The walls and <br />
ceiling were painted the brightest permutation of cool white. The huge windows had white vertical blinds on <br />
them which opened up to a blazing sun overlooking an Olympic sized swimming pool where a few retirees were now <br />
making their rounds. Since it made the already bright room practically luminescent, Carl shut the blinds and <br />
the light curtains so he could examine the furnishings. There were two double sized beds, a flatscreen TV, a <br />
Blu-ray player, a well stocked mini-fridge and mini-bar, a good bathroom, and neatly designed purple <br />
carpeting. The kitchen was small and merely functional, but he figured that was to encourage people to eat in <br />
the dining room downstairs.<br />
<br />
Opening the dresser drawers, Carl immediately found the clothing that Wendy had picked out for him for the <br />
trip. They both had had their luggage's delivered to this hotel three days ago, each to be laid out in their <br />
rooms for them at little extra cost. The clothing was mostly made up of lightweight dresses, tube tops, <br />
skirts, and short shorts, all sized whatever, but absurdly small and skimpy on his person. Wendy had insisted <br />
that they dress as provocatively and flirtly as possible during the interviews and show. When Carl asked <br />
whether thus was setting a good example for Brooke, Wendy went into a spiel about how feminism didn't <br />
necessarily preclude women from dressing traditionally like women. “And”, she said, “now that you pretending <br />
to be my sister, you will dress like me. No twin of mine is going to be a tomboy!”<br />
<br />
Sighing, Carl took his white off sundress off and put a lime green tube top on, as well as a pair of cut off <br />
bluejeans. He hoped that he didn't look too ridiculous, because his fashion sense was never the best.<br />
<br />
He sat down on one of the beds, turned on the TV, and found that a DVD of sample episodes from past seasons of <br />
Big Brother was currently playing in the Blu-ray player. Shrugging his shoulders, he figured “Why Not?”, and <br />
decided to Play All.<br />
<br />
Carl made a day of it, getting into the mood of the game, and the strategy required to do well and go deep. <br />
The more he watched and studied the show, the more he realized that he would suck at this if he were going at <br />
it alone, but if he just listened to what Wendy told him to do and laid low through the first few rounds, he <br />
would nine times out of ten do well and go far. He wouldn't win though, apparently, as people who flew under <br />
the radar were not usually respected compared to the more outrageous and flamboyant players. Carl didn't care. <br />
He wasn't much interested in playing to win anyway. He just wanted to make up his sins to his wife, and get <br />
out of the house with as much dignity as he could. <br />
<br />
The hours flew by until it was 5:00 P.M. Wendy had been gone for at least eight hours now. What were the <br />
network representative asking her? How was she responding to their personal questions? Was that guy, Jon <br />
Adams-Reilly, really on the up and up? <br />
<br />
This was going to be a long two weeks.<br />
<br />
Carl turned off the TV once he was done with the DVD set and pulled out the Gideon Bible from his nightstand. <br />
He started to read it, immersing himself in the drama and poetry of it all, but he was still bored out of his <br />
mind at the drudgery of the application process. People actually wanted to go through this? He just couldn't <br />
wrap his mind around it. This was the most tired he had felt in years. Although now that he was in his early <br />
twenties and full of piss and vinegar, he never felt so old before. <br />
<br />
6:00 P.M<br />
<br />
Isn't this illegal under the Geneva Conventions?<br />
<br />
7:00 P.M<br />
<br />
Smack. Smack. Smack.<br />
<br />
Carl banged his head lightly against the wall. He wanted to open the front door to his room, just to see what <br />
would happen. <br />
<br />
He was getting real, real sick of this. A man(or woman) could go mad from being stuck in a room all day. Then <br />
it hit him. Were there cameras in here? Was this some sort of secret test to see how he would react to being <br />
locked away in a house? There were tons of hidden camera shows out there. <br />
<br />
Was he going mad?<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, Carl decided to just take a short nap, wake up at 8:00 P.M, and get the hell out of this <br />
room for a while. So he laid down above the covers, and rested his eyes...</p>
