<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There were moments when it was easy to completely forget who they&#39;d been before deciding to crash Lucy&#39;s sleep over. During these times, Jeff and Alan were driven from their minds, they saw themselves wholly as Felicity and Jennifer. As Jennifer decided to wait it out for the time being, and headed back to the living room, what happened the instant she stepped into the room was one of those instants where she went from having doubts to Jeff being buried and Jennifer taking full control.<br />
<br />
The other girls still sitting on the floor, whilst on the television some movie played, the group was now engaged in a heated discussion. The subject of the topic, Jennifer quickly grasped, was the Chronivac, and what, if anything, they ought to do with it. Ideas being tossed around, with the general consensus being to keep to their plans for the indoor waterpark and cinema on Saturday, the talk was to explore their options with it Sunday, whilst another idea was to see what they could do with it tonight. Sitting down next to Tanya, Jennifer listened as Natalie said, &quot;I think we ought to try use it become animals of some sort. Not permanently. But, I dunno, maybe for like six hours. Maybe twelve,&quot; whilst Diana put forth the idea of the entire group becoming plush.<br />
<br />
Back and forth the ideas were tossed, ranging from fantasy creatures to becoming other people, with this one shot down by Lucy, who described the notion as, &quot;Creepy,&quot; as she gave Felicity and Jennifer a pointed look, which was missed by everyone. By the time the pizza had arrived, they still hadn&#39;t reached a decision, but were leaning toward the idea of become fantasy creatures, plush, or some type of animal, all within a set time frame.<br />
<br />
Lucy&#39;s aunt giving them permission to eat in the living room, the girls didn&#39;t return to the topic until well after dinner, and by the time they&#39;d started their third movie. Diana coming back from the bathroom, and wearing her pyjamas, she sat down next to Felicity and broached the subject, &quot;So what are going to do with the Chronivac? Anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still think, since we don&#39;t have anything decided yet for Sunday, we use it then,&quot; Natalie offered.<br />
<br />
Several nods greeted this, and then Tanya commented, &quot;I dunno about anyone else, but I&#39;m thinking of using it tonight,&quot; and when asked what for, she explained, &quot;I&#39;m considering become the plush I was earlier, but I think only from about midnight to six or seven in the morning. You know. See what it&#39;s like to be like that for longer than, what was it, ten minutes or so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We could see if there&#39;s a way to set it up so we&#39;re, like, up all night, but not tired when we change back,&quot; Lucy offered, and this getting several other&#39;s attention, Felicity and Jennifer especially.<br />
<br />
Caught up in everything, who they&#39;d been before slipping from them even more, as well as the timer they&#39;d set, the two new girls of the group offered ideas, with Felicity suggesting if they all did it, they each become a different plush, whilst Jennifer said, &quot;We&#39;d want to take into consideration whether we should be the type of plush on all fours or those on two legs.&quot;<br />
<br />
These ideas bringing more talk to the table, the group soon agreed they&#39;d all become plush toys, with a timer set to expire at seven in the morning. Wanting to know when they ought to make the change, Lucy said, &quot;I think the best time would be after my aunt has gone to bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Final details hammered out after it was agreed until Aunt Ginny went to bed, each soon started to talk about what type of plush they might consider. Diana and Tanya both wanted to become what they&#39;d had before, whilst Natalia was unsure, but thought she might become the same as previously. Lucy said she wanted to be something with hands, whilst Felicity commented, &quot;I think I&#39;d want to be something mythical.&quot; Talking over the options, they soon came to the point where it was becoming more speculation, and their conversation shifting, as they put in another movie, and waited for Ginny to go to bed, they talked about their problems in classes, what they were doing in scouts, in the case of Lucy, Diana, and Natalie, various activities each was engaged in, learning more and Felicity and Jennifer and what their life had been like before they moved.<br />
<br />
When Lucy&#39;s aunt had at last gone to bed, they decided to wait a bit longer before using the Chronivac. The movie they were watching finishing, they talked amongst themselves, sometimes going back and re-covering previous discussions, this time with new things added which had been overlooked or forgotten, and when about a half hour had passed, Lucy put her fingers to her lips and made a motion for the others to follow. Tiptoeing toward the home office, Lucy shut the door and clicked on the small desk lamp. Sitting down at the computer, she brought up the programme.<br />
<br />
Jennifer and Felicity, still so lost in who they currently were, crowded with the other girls around the computer. Whispering with the rest of them, Felicity, when Lucy had her profile pulled up, provided, &quot;Can you make me a pastel purple dinosaur? A triceratops?&quot; and nodding at this, Lucy inputted the data. Finishing this, she looked at Jennifer and Natalie, who still had decided, and after a bit, Jennifer, who had a nagging doubt and felt as if she was missing something, put her feelings aside and said, &quot;Can you make me Hello Kitty?&quot;<br />
<br />
This information entered, they each waited for Natalie, who at last suggested, &quot;I think I&#39;ll be a plush pony again. Same colour as before, same mark on the flank, but do you think I can be a unicorn this time? And, if the programme can make us telepathic, do you think it can also make me telekinetic?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s see,&quot; Lucy replied, and going through the options, she confirmed this, as well as discovered there was an option to transport them to a different location.<br />
<br />
Excited by the idea of being able to go somewhere and not have to be confined to Lucy&#39;s place for the evening, a hushed discussion broke out amongst them. Each suggesting a place, it didn&#39;t take them long before they&#39;d settled on where they&#39;d go for the night. Working it out they&#39;d be transported back before the changed back, Lucy worked the Chronivac and entered the new information. Finishing, she stood and said, &quot;I&#39;ve set a five-minute timer before our transformation begins,&quot; and grasping the hemline of her shirt, she started to take it off, but stopped when she saw the others looking at her.<br />
<br />
Still holding her shirt, she asked, &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at each other, it was Tanya who at last asked, &quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
As if it was obvious, Lucy explained, &quot;I am undressing. I do not know about the rest of you, but, I dunno, I feel as if I should make the change without clothes. For those who&#39;ll end up wearing doll clothes, I guess it make the most sense to keep on what you have, as they&#39;ll become something different. But, since I am going to become a plush, jointed monkey, I do not know want my clothes to change.&quot;<br />
<br />
They each saw some reason in this, as well as a fault. But, not wanting to argue about it, each girl gave the other a look as to confirm this before everyone except Diana and Jennifer undressed. Folding up and setting aside their clothes, the four nude girls shuddered as, minute s after they&#39;d done this, an itching sensation washed over them. Each in turning feeling as if hundreds of tiny insects were marching over them, one by one, they dropped to the floor.<br />
<br />
Diana, Tanya and Natalie already knowing what to expect, they were the least bit concerned as their transformation played out exactly as before, with the last to go was their sight as their eyes morphed and then their vision returned. For Lucy, she thought it was strange as she felt the faux fur sprout across her body, her tailbone extended into a prehensile tail she knew she could use, whilst her limbs and joints shifted to become to jointed sections which would allow her to be position, if she was ever played with. Fingers, hands, feet and toes becoming moulded plastic, she was relieved she still had the use of them, then was alarmed when she lost all five of her senses. Nose becoming a hard moulded plastic, whilst her eyes transformed into glass, she was relieved when at least her vision returned and she was able to see.<br />
<br />
Next to her, Felicity&#39;s body softened, elongated, and sprouted faux pastel purple fur. Stitched hearts forming on her flanks, two on one side, two on the other, she was soon about twenty inches long from snout to tail and tens inches high. Three horns erupting outward, her eyes became two black orbs, with a smaller white orb inside, stitched to her face. Below this, two purple circles appeared, giving her the appearance of having dimples, with the last to form was her crest.<br />
<br />
For Jennifer, it was different. Faux white fur sprouted across her body as her nose and eyes became hard plastic. Eyes turning black, nose turning yellow, stitched whiskers appeared on her cheeks as a bow appeared just below left ear, both of which were now on top of her head. Her clothes morphing last, the shorts of her skirt became a tight pair of doll&#39;s panties, a pair of black leggings covered her legs, and the skirt became a two-piece, with the underskirt a solid, white piece, whilst the top part was lacy. Openings for her bob tail appearing, and her tail poking out, her shirt was the last to change as it became pastel purple with a floral print.<br />
<br />
Their transformations finishing, none of the six girls made any attempt to move or contact each other as they grew accustomed to their new bodies, or, in the case of Diana, Tanya, and Natalie, re-accustomed. In their own way, they thought it was over, about to try to see if they could move, it took them by surprise when suddenly the office was whisked away and they were transported to the place Lucy had set for them to be sent to.</p>
