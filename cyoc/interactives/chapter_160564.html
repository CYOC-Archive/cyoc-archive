<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It took them ten minutes to reach Luna´s home. She brought him in quickly, placing him down on the carpet in front of the couch. “There you go, little one. I will make you your bottle and you can explore your new home a bit.” Luna said and moved over to the kitchen.<br />
Chad looked around, hoping for a way to get back to normal, but there wasn´t anything that looked like it would help him. “I didn´t need a bottle, I´m a grown up.” he thought. He tried getting up, but his body couldn´t keep its balance, so he dropped back on his ass. After three more tries he tried to crawl, with allowed him to move around at least a bit.<br />
Soon Luna brought his bottle over. She lifted him up, sat down on the couch and removed his pacifier. He tried to talk to her, but all that came out was baby gibberish. “You are so cute.” she said before putting the bottle at his mouth. Chad wanted to refuse it, but felt compelled to take it and drink. He got drowsy while he drunk it. Soon the bottle was empty, and slowly Chad drifted off, fast asleep. Luna had replaced the bottle with the pacifier again, and now moved him to a crib she had in a spare room which would be his room now.<br />
An hour or two later Chad woke to the sound of voices. It took his sleepy mind a bit to remember what happened to him. He had again this damn it pacifier in his mouth, and couldn´t spit it out, it was so embarrassing for him. At least he noted he was still dry.<br />
Outside Mickey and Luna were talking. Mickey had just arrived, and Luna explained she had dealt with Chad earlier. Mickey relaxed a bit. “Finally he won´t bully me. Where is he?”<br />
“He is asleep in the crib I got. His body has regressed into a baby, just as planned. And nobody but us remembers him now.” Luna replied smiling.<br />
“So he´s still in there as he was? I could get some revenge on him now.” Mickey said, grinning evilly.<br />
“Don´t you dare, Mickey. Yes, he is still in there, but his body is now an innocent baby, and I will raise him as a better man. I want you to be his father, and not an abusive one. That wouldn´t make him any better.” Luna exclaimed a bit angry.<br />
Mickey didn´t answer, but moved to the room Chad was in right now. Seeing Chad awake, he couldn´t stop himself from teasing. “Look at the mighty star quarterback now. A little, diaper wearing baby. Not so strong anymore, huh?” He then built himself over Chad in his crib.<br />
Chad, seeing how intimidating Mickey was now, swallowed hard. And without realizing it, pissed himself, which resulted in his diaper growing and turning yellow.<br />
“Oh, look at that. The champion is pissing himself in fear of the weak boy he picked on. How embarrassing.” Mickey laughed.<br />
He hadn´t noticed Luna behind him. “Mickey, you either stop intimidating Chad right now, or I will see to it that you share his fate as his twin.”<br />
Mickey just laughed even more. “You explained to me how this all worked. I know you can´t just regress me without preparations, Luna. I will have my fun with my tormentor now, so don´t complain to mu-mmgh.” Mickeys sentence was stopped when Luna pushed a second dildo-shaped pacifier down his throat, looking pissed.<br />
“Yes, I needed preparations, but guess what? I already had made more than I would need for Chad. Just in case he had someone with him when he arrived in the field house. That´s not what I wanted to do, but you brought that over yourself now, Mickey.” She said, and then pushed the orange pacifier in completely.<br />
Mickey had tried to stop her, but he couldn´t move while she screamed at him, and now that the pacifier was in as far as it goes, he felt a strong urge to start sucking it. He tried hard to resist, but couldn´t. His mind grew foggy, and soon he was cumming uncontrollable into his underwear, regressing just like Chad did. When it was over and he was just as small and young as Chad, he sat there in his cum soaked clothes, still making a dreamy face.<br />
“Hmm, not as cute as Chad, but still adorable” said Luna as he finished regressing. He shook his head and looked up at her in fear. How could she do this to him, she was his best friend.<br />
“Oh yeah, I was your best friend, but you brought that upon yourself, Mickey. Now you will be my son, just like Chad. And I will make sure you get along nicely.” Luna said as she lifted Mickey out of his clothes and onto the small shelf. <br />
That was also something Chad noticed, this room had no changing table. So how would Luna change their diapers?<br />
Luna did the same with Mickey´s clothes as she did with Chad´s, only his clothes weren´t drenched in his cum. Soon his boxers were a wet diaper, his jeans and shirt resembled an onesie, his socks were mittens on his hands and his shoes had become booties on his little feet. The only difference was Mickey didn´t wore a jockstrap, therefore had no cap on his head right now.<br />
With another wave of her hand the wet diaper Mickey wore was dry again. Chad hadn´t noticed, but his diaper had dried while he watched Mickey regress.<br />
“Now let´s get you to your brother, Mickey. Here, I will expand the crib to make room for you.” And then Mickey and Chad laid next to each other in the crib, looking up at Luna. “Now you will learn to get along, or I will need to help you with it. And then there will happen more than you will want to.”<br />
Shaking her head again at her former friend, Luna left the room, leaving the two boys laying there in shocked silence. Not that they could make much sound around their pacifiers.</p>
