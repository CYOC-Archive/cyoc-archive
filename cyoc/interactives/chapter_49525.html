<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A beam of light travelled slowly across the room, traversing the chronivac and over the sodas still on his desk. Jeff was out cold from the feeding-frenzy before he had gone to sleep last night. Two bags of cashews was picked clean of its contents but the crumbles lied all around the floor. Then it hit him in straight on the face, and groaning he started turning around and scratching his big belly. Not really familiar with the sensation of fur against his hands he quickly awoke and sat up in his bed with eyes wide open. Then it dawned on him what had happened and he just sat there petting his belly, fingers spread wide.<br />
There had not really been any progression since last night aside from that the fur on his belly had darkened in the middle a bit and was slightly thicker than last night.<br />
Touching his chest he could also feel ribs on his side, and that his previous assessment about having such a solid layer of fat wasn't entirely true. He still had quite a &quot;healthy&quot; amount of it but when he punched his stomach it didn't exactly ripple or bounce as he had expected. It felt quite firm in fact. His whole chest had barreled out quite decently appearently, and he could feel larger lungs working inside him and every breath producing somewhat of a runging sound inside him. Sighing with contentment he fell back with head into his pillow and yawned a lot more loudly than he remembered. He stretched out his arms up and above him, closed his eyes and stretched himself thoroughly while lying down.<br />
He panted quite bestially for a few breaths after that, and decided it was time to see what his full-length mirror could tell him that he couldn't see himself. He had forgotten to take off his pants last night, and they had actually shredded since yesterday as they fell down him to the floor once he stood up from bed. He didn't really percieve any heavyness almost whatsoever, took a bit slower to stretch himself up but it wasn't any strain on him.<br />
Once he saw himself in the mirror, he saw what had happened.<br />
<br />
His hearty yawn and panting obviously had something to do with his now pretty substantially thickened neck, and his legs had gotten some more muscle to them. The fur on his belly as he suspected had thickened, and his armpits as well as shoulders now looked really beefy with fur starting to crawl out on them, but as he had specified on the Chronivac it stayed within the area of his chest. He touched himself, the puff of fur on his chest as well as the large, warm belly. However it was once he turned around to see his side that he took notice of the short stubby tail that had grown on his backside.<br />
He without a shadow of a doubt had the torso and midsection of a bear now, much to his delight.<br />
<br />
Trying out some guttural sounds he was amazed at how deep it rumbled inside him. He started to laugh, but what came out was a boisterous guffaw that he quickly silenced once he remembered he wasn't the only one in the household. Speaking of other people, he had 23 sodas left, it would be quite fun to bring them with him to him and his friends weekly movie night. Not before getting some kind of safety on this, it would be devastating if they all had to go through several streets looking like freaks to get back to the Chronivac to change back again.<br />
But stroking his new tail and belly he was staring blindly into the mirror, seriously considering the risk of taking another one of those sodas for himself before any more plans... maybe it would just further change him to a bear or add some more weird animal parts on him.<br />
Walking up to the door and holding a ear against it he could hear his sister downstairs taking care of the dishes, the distinct sound of glass being placed in the cupboard. <br />
Better be subtle. He turned around and walked up to the sodas and grabbed one in his hand.<br />
Lets see what's next in store...</p>
