<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alan walked into school with his head held high. He normally hated going to school, but today, today was different. Alan had the powers of a god in his notebook. He could make anything happen. He could make Norm the school bully Rob piss himself, or any girl he wanted fall in love with him, or make a teacher embarrass himself when trying to embarrass Alan, anything!<br />
<br />
The only problem, of course, was that Alan&#39;s parents had limited his use. He could only make three changes, that was it. Of course, with the power of writing that meant if he could word his changes exceptionally well then he could get away with technically more than three things. He walked into his first class, pretended like he was taking notes, but started to brainstorm ideas.<br />
<br />
He left the class still guessing when he ran into one of his least favorite people, Nate. Nate wasn&#39;t a bully or anything, he was just a huge dickhead. He always thought he was right, and stubbornly refused to admit when he was wrong. It drove Alan crazy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look out dork.&quot; Nate scolded. &quot;You nearly ran into me dingus.&quot; <br />
<br />
Alan just rolled his eyes and began to write. &quot;Nate can only bark and everybody thinks this is normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry Nate, I didn&#39;t mean to nearly hit you.&quot; Alan apologized.<br />
<br />
Nate got that smug look on his face he always got when someone fed his ego. &quot;Bark bark Ruff ruff!&quot; He happily barked as he walked away arrogantly.<br />
<br />
Alan waited till Nate walked around the corner before he started laughing uncontrollably. He couldn&#39;t wait to hear more &quot;discussions&quot; with Nate in them now. Alan was a little sad he waisted a change with that but he felt it was well worth it. He walked to his next class and decided to go for a larger change.<br />
<br />
As the boring lecture went on, Alan wrote &quot;Every time I yell &#39;Freeze!&#39; everybody in range will become thoughtless husks, and when I yell &#39;thaw&#39; they will return to normal with no memory of what happened during the freeze.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alan decided to wait a few minutes as Mrs. Yates started to scroll to the next slide. Just as she was about to do so, Alan yelled &quot;Freeze!&quot; and the whole class just stopped. Alan turned next to him and saw the guy in the next desk over just sitting there lifelessly staring. He looked to the other side and saw the same story with the girl next to him. He got up, walked to the front of the class, and saw everyone was now just sitting there blankly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm.&quot; He said aloud. &quot;I wonder.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alan got a little power mad. He walked up to the school bully in the front row, unzipped his pants, and pulled out his dick. He began stroking it and it slowly got erect, but the guy still didn&#39;t react. Alan started jerking the guy off and just before he blew he sat back down and yelled &quot;thaw!&quot; and everybody perked up and went back to their normal positions with no clue they had missed a few minutes. That is, until something else happened.<br />
<br />
A shot of cum suddenly flew up into the air and everybody jumped up and screamed. Mrs. Yates almost had a heart attack and became red as she started scolding him. Rob had no idea what had happened so he could barely defend himself as he zipped up his pants and turned beat red. The class was canceled as a custodian was called and Rob was sent to the principal&#39;s office.<br />
<br />
Alan felt a little bad but Rob hurt a lot of people, some of which were Alan&#39;s friends, so he felt he deserved this. He felt like he&#39;d keep the freeze ability for a while, but he&#39;d get rid of it eventually. He began to walk to his next class when he saw Melissa Brown herself standing there in all her beauty. She was playing with one of her red curls when she spotted Alan, looked pissed, and then walked off.<br />
<br />
Alan didn&#39;t even realize that their reality changing antics had ruined his chances with her that much. He listened in as she talked to someone on her phone saying &quot;He just ditched me...&quot; and his heart sank. He needed to fix this fast so he wanted to quickly write &quot;Melissa doesn&#39;t remember our awful date&quot; but in his haste while writing with occasionally looking up, he accidentally wrote &quot;Mellisa doesn&#39;t remember dates.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Shit.&quot; he said quietly to himself as he realized he had messed it up. &quot;Oh well, hopefully that doesn&#39;t screw too much-&quot; he thought to himself before he saw Melissa sit down in the middle of the hall. Alan watched confused as Melissa began to wail. Alan realized how the magic had interpreted his poorly thought out writing. She no longer remembers any dates, meaning she has no memories at all. She essentially is a newborn with a high schooler&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no!&quot; He thought. &quot;What do I do!?&quot;</p>

What does Alan do?</h3>
