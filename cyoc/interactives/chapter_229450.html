<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I have big natural and very bouncy, I-Cup boobs, to be exact my bra size is 36I, also I have very long black hair, so long that it reaches behind my knees…&quot; Laura said suddenly lost in thought and thinking about which silly idea to try now, when Laura finished saying her sentence, the vocal command did its thing and wrote each word on the controller&#39;s screen, then it made a beeping sound.<br />
<br />
What exactly was happening here??<br />
<br />
The generously busty girl, with her beautiful and wide I-Cup bouncy breasts, she walked over to check the controller again after it made this beeping sound, as she walked over to it, Laura stroked her really long black hair that was swinging a bit from side to side, Laura liked to spend a lot of time combing her long hair and it was in an incredibly well-kept state, it was beautiful, wide and very shiny, so her hair reflected a bit of the sunlight coming through the window as she was going towards the controller.<br />
<br />
When Laura stared at the controller screen, she saw how the exact sentence she just said was written there in text. And as Laura look at this, she felt very confused.<br />
<br />
According to the instructions, or the vague comments that came with and gave the controller if you can call them something similar to the instructions of some manual. This was a controller capable of editing reality and retroactively changing everything that was defined on it, really a rather ridiculous and exaggerated statement. There was clearly no way that something like a simple weird tablet could do anything like change the world around you, when Laura first saw this, she thought it was just the wat this bootleg digital tablet was advertise itself, like oh woah the photos taken by this tablet are so realistic that when you use its editing tools you will think that you are editing the reality around you!! So Laura saw this whole thing about editing reality as a silly phrase to sell to uninformed people who have never interacted with photoshop in her life, this thing. I mean, if Laura had never interacted with technology in her life, and suddenly she saw Photoshop for the first time, maybe she could describe this as a tool that edits reality on your screen!! But as a digital artist, of course she was all too familiar with those things from years ago.<br />
<br />
Even looking at it that way, when she checked the Reality Rules tabs, she bump into this... a thing that it affirmed and told you that you could use this to //allowed to have specific rules applying to anything from a specific person, a type of food to the entirety of humanity//...like what??? The mode that she opened was described as something capable of editing reality, even from the point of view that this was some wordbuilding guide for fanfiction, seeing it that way didn&#39;t make much sense either.<br />
<br />
Because all it was doing in this menu was writing what Laura was saying, nothing more, it wasn&#39;t editing some kind of picture or model, or generating some list of tags that you&#39;re defining for your story, Everything Laura saw was literally just a thing that wrote down in text what you told it vocally. So why describe this Tab as /Reality Rules/ and talk about applying them to things?? Wouldn&#39;t it be more appropriate to just call this section Notepad or something?? <br />
<br />
The wording all this thing was just, weird.<br />
<br />
But all this wasn&#39;t what was mostly making Laura felt confused at this.<br />
<br />
When Laura said the sentence, she said it while believing for a slight second that ok let&#39;s pretend the controller&#39;s statements are true and this is a thing that can actually edit reality, let&#39;s change something about this reality then and see if the controller shows me its almighty power!! And clearly for Laura, that didn&#39;t happen, nothing about this reality changed and everything remained the same as it has always been.<br />
<br />
And then at the same time, what was the controller supposed to change?? The sentence that was written on it simply described Laura, just as she has always been, what was on the screen was something that was already true, then there was nothing to change, so then why did Laura say that sentence exactly if her intention was to test if the control could change reality?? That was what had her confused the most.<br />
<br />
Laura thought that oh maybe her intention was to change the color of her hair, to describe her hair as blonde and see if her color would change, as a test to see if the controller really worked and could edit reality, but she in her train of thoughts forgot about that and just described her hair as black.<br />
<br />
And this led Laura to blush a little, so why did she describe her breasts first then? That part was unnecessary for the hair experiment. But hey Laura would be lying if she didn&#39;t feel blessed by her naturally very big bust size, when puberty hit her some years ago, it made her the bustiest girl in the school and practically all her female classmates were envious of her while she tried to make not so obvious how big they were, and when she began to dedicate herself to her drawings, they ended up being quite useful because they allowed her to use herself as a model multiple times. Drawings of very busty anime girls attract a lot of attention, especially when they looked anatomically correct, and Laura turned out to be a pretty real busty lady with jiggle physics and everything.<br />
<br />
In fact, when Laura decided to post one of those /Artist vs Art/ images on the internet, she got tons and tons of comments about how she actually looked identical to her drawings, how her OCs literally had the same big breasts size as her, their creator, everyone was like Woahh you are just like them!! Those comments made Laura blush a lot, especially because of how accurate they were. And this whole event of Laura being similar to her drawings of busty anime girls with long hair greatly increased her popularity as an artist on the Internet, which was actually very good for her, Laura was requested a lot of commissions after that, most of them of a very lewd nature or appealing to all kinds of very kinky stuff, to no one&#39;s surprise. It was the kind of drawing that Laura was asked for the most, and the idea that a kinky drawing was made for you by this busty babe was a must for many people.<br />
<br />
So returning to our question...Why did you mention that at the beginning of the sentence in your experiment on your hair, Laura?? Well Laura thought that maybe she just liked the idea of saying it and that the Tablet would knew her bust size, no matter how random and out of place it may sound.<br />
<br />
Laura then embarrassed and blushing said shyly out loud &quot;I guess I really like the big size of my melons…&quot; her sentence was punctuated by the remote beeping again. <br />
<br />
Laura was there, not really looking embarrassed at all, but rather with a complacent smile on her face and blushing a bit, she looked confident more than anything, because of course she was thinking about how she has always felt some pride over the large size of her bust, which she actually quite liked having. Many girls in her situation would be ashamed of their very big size and would opt for reduction surgery, but Laura?? She really liked her melons.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Laura felt that it wasn&#39;t worth giving more thought to what&#39;s up with this tablet. Laura thought of a new theory about what was happening, maybe this tablet was something of quite bootleg and Chinese origin, and maybe originally all its menus were in Chinese, and the unusual descriptions she was reading were some explanation in Chinese poorly translated into English, that&#39;s why it sounded odd, yeah that must be it!! The idea that this thing alters reality is too ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Laura decided not to pay attention to the fact that the controller made a beep sound again a moment ago, and thought well this seems to be anything but a wordbuilding guide for fanfiction or whatever, when Laura really needed some REAL inspiration!!<br />
<br />
The last drawing that Laura posted didn&#39;t get as many likes as usual, and that worried her a little, maybe the drawing was too vanilla?? Laura was thinking that she needed to make a new drawing about some pretty kinky idea to attract more attention on her again, and thus get many more potential clients and more commissions to work on!!<br />
<br />
So that&#39;s what Laura needed, inspiration!! Ideas!! Some very Kinky concept that she hasn&#39;t explored yet, that this would motivate her and this would make her draw something that would get her a lot of likes and feedback!!<br />
<br />
Laura stopped paying attention to the tablet completely, sat down at her desktop computer and got to work.<br />
<br />
Laura turned on the computer screen, and she knew perfectly well what to do next. There was a website especially dedicated to kinky and very horny wordbuilding that she visited a lot. Filled with tons and tons of detailed pieces of erotic literature. Ah yeah the good ol&#39; Alternaterealities.horny.xxx.<br />
<br />
The focus of this website was to offer a platform where its users could publish fiction that explored alternate realities with alternate ways of working, in their physics and/or in their society or however the author wanted to define their alternate kinky reality. Like for example exploring what life was like in a world where sex was used as a means of payment instead of money which didn&#39;t exist there, that kind of things. Both original fiction and fanfiction were allowed on the website and there were things for all tastes, and it was easy to find anything thanks to their very good tagging system.<br />
<br />
And honestly Laura spent a good amount of her hours just reading things here, there was very good material that certain people had published, Laura got a boner just remembering a certain story she read a week ago and she already had a tent showing up in her pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;GOD that author&#39;s horny story was SO detailed&quot;<br />
<br />
The thing is that this website is where Laura got many of her great inspirations, like that time she read a fic about an alternate world where women became horny demon girls when they matured, and this made her make a piece of art of a guy being fucked hard by two demon girls with huge demon dicks, this drawing was very very popular and got many likes.<br />
<br />
Time to review new material then!!, Laura entered Alternaterealities.horny.xxx and the first thing that came out was a notice in which it was written /// REMEMBER, YOU SHOULD NOT ENTER THIS WEBSITE UNTIL YOU ARE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OLD, +18 NSFW WEBSITE. THIS WEBSITE IS ONLY FOR ADULTS!! ADULTS ONLY. -ACCEPT- -LEAVE THIS WEBSITE TO BE SAFE- ///<br />
<br />
Was this warning new? The last time Laura checked, they hadn&#39;t put it in yet.<br />
<br />
The young girl who just turned 18 not so long ago, and had not yet started a college career, said out loud, joking with a smug tone of voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pfff I&#39;m very adult, I&#39;m practically twice that age!!&quot; Laura said with a smile, then the Controller made its Beep sound in response.<br />
<br />
A small inconvenience of having such long hair was when Laura found gray hair in the middle of her hair, since these were quite long and got lost in how wide her hair was, but Laura took good care of it still. She was a woman with a fairly mature body, and despite being 36 years old, she took very good care of all of it. Her I-Cup breasts were still as bouncy as ever because of that, one of the many reasons Laura liked them a lot.<br />
<br />
Laura&#39;s life wasn&#39;t going perfectly to be exact, but she was grateful to just be able to lounge in front of her computer wearing casual clothes, instead of being in her office in her secretary outfit.<br />
<br />
Laura lost her job just 2 weeks ago, because the Company she was working for went bankrupt and it had to fire all its employees much to the sadness of their boss, that company simply made some very bad business decisions. Laura wasn&#39;t too devastated by the event luckily, since she had enough money saved to live jobless for about 3 months just by her own, enough time to get a new job and have a stable source of income again.<br />
<br />
But that&#39;s partly why she was so interested in getting some good inspiration for new drawings, due to her current situation, any extra money she could earn helped her a lot, and she still didn&#39;t want to throw the classic //Emergency Commissions!!// card because she didn&#39;t want to alarm her followers, especially considering that she was sure she would get a new job soon.<br />
<br />
A very good advantage of her excellent I-Cups breasts was that they always helped her get a job quickly, since Laura always did well in interviews, and she got all the attention of her bosses, for all those funny reasons while she pretended that she didn&#39;t notice they didn&#39;t look at her face much.<br />
<br />
But of course Laura didn&#39;t lose anything by being cautious.<br />
<br />
Honestly, the idea of being interested and worried about making money with her drawings alone made her feel nostalgic, for those simpler times when she had a less busy life and her goal was something as simple like getting people to ask her for a lot of commissions then make them, then get the money, to pay for some articulated anime figure that she wanted to have as a model to make more drawings. Laura didn&#39;t have to worry so much about having money to survive when she went to college several years ago, because back then her mother gave Laura all the money she needed to pay for her apartment and food. Now Laura is an adult and she is on her own.<br />
<br />
Still, the internet was a very different place 13 years ago. The old trick of drawing My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic&#39;s STALLION PORN, didn&#39;t seem to do the trick anymore nowdays, Brony culture is finally dying, isn&#39;t it?? My GOD Laura, you seriously were just 25 when this whole Brony culture phenomenon started and then grow exponentially?? God you feel old just thinking about it, you&#39;ve been drawing kinky things on the internet for too many years, Laura, and you spent too much of that time drawing Princess Luna with a huge dick and huge balls.<br />
<br />
That just made Laura realize something, she needed really fresh and new ideas, to attract new audiences to her lewd drawings!!!<br />
<br />
Let&#39;s see.<br />
<br />
Laura browsed and browsed Alternaterealities.horny.xxx, looking for something interesting.<br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t help but notice that a tag that was very popular now was the /Unfuta/ tag, hmmm.<br />
<br />
A Unfuta was a relatively new concept.<br />
<br />
As everyone knows, in this world all women have always had cock and balls.<br />
<br />
What differentiated a woman from a man, in the genitals section at least, is that a Man only had a cock and balls, together they were just one set, while a Woman had two different sets of genitals, a vagina plus the cock and balls, the vagina was this wet fruit shaped thing located under the woman&#39;s balls, an entrance that led eventually to the woman&#39;s womb, a woman standing with her penis erect has her balls resting on the lips of her pussy, slightly covering the top of that entrance. Regarding aesthetics, a difference between female and male penises is that women always used to shave their balls, for reasons of comfort, since the hairs on their balls tickled their pussy and could get in there slightly, which was annoying, so what was considered a Feminine Cock was one with shaved balls. On the other hand male cocks always tended to be very hairy on the balls, since a man grows more hair than a woman all over his body anyway, so the concept of a Masculine Dick was one with very hairy balls.<br />
<br />
But functionally speaking, all this jusy meant that a man could insert his seed into other women and impregnate them, but not be pregnant because he lacked a uterus inside him to incubate the baby, while a woman could both impregnate other women with her own dick, and also to get pregnant by other women and men, and incubate their seed inside to create the baby. Reproductively speaking, a man could do just one thing, but a woman could do two things.<br />
<br />
And since it was the woman who had the responsibility of carrying the baby, that is why they had breasts, to take on the task of breastfeeding it.<br />
<br />
Having nuts and the rod was something that all mammals shared, in their two biological genders, the difference was the presence or absence of the uterus developed inside.<br />
<br />
The scientific explanation of why nature designed men and women like this is because the cock also fulfills the function of being the mechanism by which we pee, so we can say that nature recycled code there, technically men also had nipples capable of giving milk, but their hormones didn&#39;t make them grow.<br />
<br />
So, what the unholy fuck was an /Unfuta/??<br />
<br />
An Unfuta, was this imaginary and fantastic idea of a woman who only had one set of genitals, a Vagina, this idea was a &quot;woman&quot; who could only be fucked by cock, and impregnated by them, a woman who could not impregnate other women, because their biological reproductive purpose was exclusively to get pregnant, without the can impregnate part there, a woman with just a pussy and not balls or cock.<br />
<br />
A woman without a cock or balls, can you imagine it? That sounds just ridiculous!! Where is a person with a biology like that supposed to pee by?? What are they supposed to use to urinate, their assholes??<br />
<br />
The unfutas was a rather weird idea, and whoever came up with it was clearly a total pervert and degenerate. Having weird fantasies of holding a woman who can only get pregnant by and nothing more, so they would need a man to have babies!!<br />
<br />
The concept of a Unfuta was actually born in Japan, where a lot of Erotic Mangas (Hentais) presented and popularized the concept, no one knows who did it first.<br />
<br />
But honestly an Unfuta was a concept that didn&#39;t surprise Laura at all, in her almost 20 years career being a lewd artist on the Internet she has seen all and all kinds of weird kinks, and breeding kinks and the variants that these kinks went through were quite common, doesn&#39;t sounds unlikely the Unfutas as something born from that line of thought.<br />
<br />
What did surprise Laura and didn&#39;t see it coming, is how popular this concept had become recently, like WTF, there were THOUSANDS of new stories posted on Alternaterealities.horny.xxx under the tag /Unfuta/, Certainly not what she expected to pay attention now.<br />
<br />
What would people think next??? Are people going to develop a fetish for the idea of eyeless women and will this become a common porn fafiction genre? Pfff!!<br />
<br />
But well, this left Laura thinking, she has never drawn an Unfuta in her entire life, because she has never in her life done such a thing as drawing a naked woman without a cock and balls hanging there in her crotch, and the idea of drawing a woman without that sounded extremely weird and alien to Laura, as if it went against what she have been learning for decades about the anatomy of the female body.<br />
<br />
But this thing was the hotopic of the moment, and Laura had never drawn that. Hmmm.<br />
<br />
Maybe Laura just needed to take her time to read some of these stories, to understand the enjoyment of the concept, and then she would find right inspiration for her new drawing??<br />
<br />
What should Laura do or review now in the incredibly vast catalog of Alternaterealities.horny.xxx??</p>
