<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a stranger. A half naked woman in her early twenties she had never met. The woman was wearing a some sort of weird waitress maid costume that had some of it&#39;s part cut off or missing. It was like Jennifer was staring at someone&#39;s fetish. A black and white dress gave elegance to the woman as it felt something she was wearing because she wanted to. Even if it was a costume it was perfect fit for her body type.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning Gloria. Are you excited that you can finally work with us?&quot; The woman spoke to Jennifer as if they knew each other. <br />
<br />
&quot;Work? Umm? Do I know you?&quot; Jennifer asked as she had no idea who was she speaking with.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? I&#39;m Penelope. We- Ah- Huh? You should know me...?&quot; The girl looked Jennifer as if she had just asked an odd question. &quot;Uhmm... Sorry to cut our conversation short but Mrs. Smith will be angry at me if I don&#39;t go out there soon. See ya later Glory!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer was confused. Why did that girl call her Gloria and where the heck she was right now? The bathroom didn&#39;t look something a regular house would have. Jennifer stood up and opened the bathroom door. On the other side she found that it was a small locker room full with women dressing and undressing themselves. She counted at least ten pair of heads that were gossiping or talking to each other as if it was normal. What was this place? The moment Jennifer exited the bathroom and entered the locker room all the women seemed to know Jennifer and greeted her as they all knew who she was. Everyone of calling her either &#39;Gloria&#39; or &#39;Glory&#39;. Why? What was so special about her? All the women in the locker room were in their 20s as some of them were a on the younger side and only two looked older than twenty five.<br />
<br />
Amidst of the crowd of women another girl came running to greet Jennifer and hold her hands. She was a happy looking 16-year-old teen who wore the similar costume but in smaller size. The girl grabbed Jennifer&#39;s wrist and dragged to a big office space next to the locker room. Inside the room there was a big sofa, calendar, marble statues, paintings, a maple desk, a thick glass filled with apple juice colored liquid and an office chair. The room smelled like a typical casino as the mixture of industrially washed rug, coins and tobacco smell combined together to produce a funky odor. Jennifer noticed two girls sitting on the sofa. They wore similar maid outfits as everybody else in this building apparently and on top of the office chair there was a woman sitting with her legs spread open in a power pose. It was Jennifer&#39;s grandma. Mary looked similar but different. She had a visible scar in her left eye that made the eye be slightly open but in closed state. Another small feature that struck in Jennifer&#39;s eye was how her grandma had well-maintained and professional cut hair that went past her shoulder. Mary looked more energetic even if she had dark patched under her eyes. Grandma Mary looked elegant and commanding in her brand new and professional looking red office suit. Even Jennifer found it hard to say a word or greet her own grandma as how dominating she was. Mary was talking with the two woman on the sofa as she too huff from a cigar and turned her head towards the door the moment Jennifer and girl dragging her entered the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jasmine and Gloria! Oh my sweet little baby girls. Did you come say hi to your mother? Come in.&quot; Mary cheered as she lowered herself down to give both of them hugs and kisses. &quot;You are always welcome to my office. Mwuah! Mwuah!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary looked back at the two girls who were smiling awkwardly and sitting on the sofa. Mary told them that she was going to have small talk with her family and would ask them to come back later.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Mrs. Smith.&quot; The girls bowed and excused themselves. Jennifer spotted that one of them was sweating profusely and that her smile was weak and forced. Had they done something bad?<br />
<br />
Mary seated them on the sofa where the two girls were sitting and offered Jennifer and Jasmine small pieces of chocolate she had inside on her office desk. Was this normal that they sat like this. Jasmine seemed to act like a normal 16-year-old while grandma Mary was looking at the papers she had in front of her. Jennifer couldn&#39;t tell how old her grandma was as her scar was throwing her off. She guess she must have been in her early stages of mid twenties or somewhere between because how old Jennifer herself was. Which reminded her. Where was her mother anyway? She didn&#39;t see Sylvia anywhere but grandma Mary was here. It felt strange to sit so close to someone who she didn&#39;t know at all. Jasmine was in costume while she was only wearing a hoodie. What a strange conundrum.<br />
<br />
Jennifer didn&#39;t know what to think of this. She started to think questions like, what was she doing here? Why was people called her Gloria? Why even her own grandma called her that and girl next to her called Jasmine was related to her...? She had only seen the bathroom, locker room and now this office space. The place seemed bigger than that. What kind of place was this?</p>
