<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen was not able to put up much of a struggle however, as the second her Mom left her sight, she felt a sharp prick in the side of her neck. She then collapsed backwards into the arms of Julie as she suddenly found herself completely unable to feel her arms and legs.<br />
<br />
Julie pulled her onto a gurney that had been brought out and strapped her in. Another worker came and collected Rex, taking him with him into a different area, while Jen was wheeled through a pair of doors on the other side of the room. As she lay helpless, Julie begins explaining what is in store for Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now don&#39;t you worry Jenny. You are not my first pet, nor will you be my last. Though the  fact that your own mother signed you up for this course is a new one. Usually it would be your husband, wife, or otherwise lover who does that. Not that we judge here. Purebred dogs are ultimatly products of incest afterall. Anyways, for today and tomorrow, I will be getting you situated and all rigged up. Then through the night you will listen to an audio track we prepare, and Tomorrow we officially begin your Day 1 training, starting with the basics of basic commands, how to be a dog, and some actual instructions, kind of like taking a how-to course. Just one for learning long-term pet play practices with a few minor mental adjustments to really make you believe you&#39;ve stopped being human.&quot; Explains Julie, she then continues with one addition thing. &quot;Oh, and here is your special training collar. As you probably can guess, it is an electric shock collar that we have hooked up to a remote instead of a fence.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen felt the new collar get clasped around her neck and then Julie pressed the button. Jen let out a surprised yelp, though it didn&#39;t hurt as much as it had simply startled her. But her reaction was more than enough for Julie to grin. <br />
<br />
Jen was taken to what looked to be a medical room where Julie either worked in, or was very familiar with as she went digging through a few drawers right away. Julie collected a few items and returned with them all set out on a tray table. She had brought things like scissors, some kind of wrapping, a tube of what looked like glue, a small key lock, some black gloves with stubier, fatter fingers and no thumb, tape, etc. <br />
<br />
However, the thing Jen was most uncomfortable with seeing being prepared for her is the golden haired dog tail. The main reason though is because it is attached to a tunnel plug insert, and she could guess which of her holes would have it shoved into.<br />
<br />
Julie wasted no time and began cutting away Jen&#39;s clothing, stripping her down naked. She also gaged Jen to stop her constant whining, not believing a single sentence of what she was saying either, as this was part of the course. Dogs do not get a say in the decisions of humans after all.<br />
<br />
She then flipped Jen over onto her stomach and let her legs hang off the edge. Julie pressed a button and 2 points beneath Jen&#39;s knees began to sink into the gurney. Julie moved Jen&#39;s knees into the new pits which forced them to be bent at the knee as much as possible. She took the wrappings and gave each leg a thorough binding, which she secured by melting the end of the fabric into the lower layer, ensuring that it will never fall off naturally. And thanks to Jen&#39;s flexibility from years of dance and cheerleading, her feet were stretched backwards to conform around her own ass cheeks too. Something that if she were not double jointed in her ankles, would not have been possible to even do.<br />
<br />
Julie took Jen&#39;s arms next and set them out to either side of her. She folder Jen&#39;s fingers at their first knuckles and then applied the glue, securing them in that position. Jen&#39;s thumbs were then placed to the side of her palms and glued in place too. Her entire hands and forearms were then shoved into the two special gloves. The gloves were then glued on as well. Jen&#39;s gloves were special in that they forced her wrists to curl backwards whenever she stopped applying a force to straighten them. The palm sides also had soft, cushioning pads too, making her new handprint look exactly like that of a dog&#39;s paw. And obviously, with her hands bound up like this, their use beyond supporting her weight would be extremely limited.<br />
<br />
Then a pair of injections were administered right into her hip joints. Julie explained that these injections filled a space in her leg joints that would cause Jen a significant amount of pain if she were to ever straighten them out and apply even a little amount of pressure at the same time. In other words, if Jen ever stood upright, she would be forced back down onto all fours by the pain and discomfort.<br />
<br />
Jen&#39;s collar was next to be upgraded, and was given a small key lock too. In addition, it was now also tighter, ensuring that Jen wouldn&#39;t be able to get it off by herself. She also was given a pair of thick hair extensions on either side of her head, right above her ears that hung down in a big clump a bit. Making her appear to have a pair of somewhat floppy dog ears. <br />
<br />
Finally, it was time for the thing Jen was looking forwards too the least. Her new tail. Julie spent a few minutes making sure Jen was clean before she began pumping her ass full of lube and inserting the special tunnel plug. What was so special about it was that it had a way to still close itself up when not &quot;in use&quot;. The tail is also special in that it has a small microchip in it that reacts to another small chip that Julie then attaches to Jen&#39;s head directly, right underneath her hair. The two chips work to interpret Jen&#39;s mood and expression,, as well as when she is going to the bathroom, and will then move her tail accordingly.<br />
<br />
Jen is now finished being rigged up into her &quot;dog form&quot; which she will be staying in for the duration of her time here. One last injection brings back the feeling of her limbs to Jen, and she immediatly stands up, though now restricted to standing on all fours. Her knees began to hurt almost instantly.<br />
<br />
Julie glued a pair of padding blocks to them after seeing her discomfort. Some of their petgirls do not need them, but there are a few like Jen, who do, as their knees are just too thin and boney to be standing on them the full time. That being said though, by the time she leaves, Jen will no longer need that padding, or even the gloves, glue, and wrappings if everything goes as planned. She may even come to love her tail and wish to have it and the other chip impeded into her body. Which actually is the popular outcome from taking the course, as the owners often times end up loving the results so much that they wish to solidify their pets into their new role permanently.<br />
<br />
Jen was then helped down off of the gurney and her gag was removed. Julie hooked a leash onto her collar and began walking out of the room. &quot;Jen. Follow.&quot; Is all she commanded. However Jen was still to distraught over what had just happened to her that she missed the command and was rewarded with a quick shock to her collar for her disobedience. Jen quickly hobbled after Julie so as to avoid another shock, getting the message loud and clear that her continued disobedience is only going to bring her more and more shocks. <br />
<br />
So Jen choose to swallowed her pride for now.  Which she discovered that when she obeyed a command from Julie, she was instead rewarded with either a sugar cube, a head pat, or if she was especially good, a click of the only pink button on the remote, which would send a vibration through her tunnel plug, stimulating her pussy. Jen wondered if at some point, Julie had managed to sneak a small chip somewhere inside of her pussy or something, as the pleasure that pink button brought her was more than enough to make her instantly cum. <br />
<br />
And this is how Jen spent her first 3 hours. Being turning physically into a dog, then began to be taught the basics by Julie teaching her using the &quot;carrot and stick&quot; approach. It was quite effective to say the least. <br />
<br />
Jen was finally lead into a kennel area where she was put inside of a concrete square with chain link fencing around the 4 sides. Her kennel was actually not small or cramped, though it wasn&#39;t large either. About the size of her bathroom back home. She also had her own dog bed, though it came with a grated floor in the corner too. But the best thing is that she had a &quot;kennelmate&quot;. Her dog Rex. He was also let into her kennel and was given his own bed to use too. They shared a water bowl though, which was also bolted down to the floor, preventing Jen from pouring the water into her mouth when thirsty. She will need to lap it up like any other dog would. Jen just laid down on her bed and began to process what just happened to her.</p>
