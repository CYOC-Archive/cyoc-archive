<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The hour passed and Tyler gave the matter as much thought as he could as his thoughts often drifted and he was often distracted by what he considered strange notions, such as how good it felt to go about on all fours. When his raccoon tail finally receded he had made up his mind and had decided that he wanted a fox tail, but for it to be permanent. Sitting down before his brother&#39;s laptop, he enters the commands for the programme to give him what he wanted, and was about to hit enter when the screen blinked and everything took a slanted look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit,&quot; Tyler swears as without any thought to what he was doing, he brought his hand up and slapped the side of the computer.<br />
<br />
From where he lay, Jeff saw this, and how the screen blinked, pixelated, and for a brief moment an error message appeared. Wanting to shout out, &quot;You better not have broken my laptop, dip face,&quot; but unable to, Jeff settled for thinking how he&#39;d make his brother pay for messing around with someone else&#39;s stuff.<br />
<br />
Tyler, having missed the error message, was instead too busy making sure that none of the settings he chosen had gotten messed up. Finding it was still set to give him the fox tail he&#39;d originally tried, and that the changes would be permanent, he scrolled down and read a box that asked him if all changes would affect only the chosen target or all targets that had been transformed within the last twelve hours. Oblivious to what Jeff had done, Tyler thought it was obvious and believing he&#39;d been the only one to use the programme lately, he selected the option for the permanency to effect all targets that had been transformed.<br />
<br />
Ready to click on the option to accept and initiate the changes, Tyler groaned when the screen blinked, pixelated, and turned sideways. Slapping the side of the machine furiously, he watched it go back to normal, unaware that a glitch in the programme had occurred, certain options had been selected and that the mental had shifted to thirty percent human, seventy percent animal. Hovering the pointer over the button, he waited a moment to see if there&#39;d be another interruption, and when nothing happened, he clicked on the option to accept and initiate. Pushing back from the computer, Tyler dropped to all fours, spread his legs and arms out as far as they could go, and raising his head so that he was looking at the ceiling, he let forth a blissful moan.<br />
<br />
Pleasure unlike anything he&#39;d ever felt before rippled through him as he raised and presented his ass like an animal in heat. Hand shaking, he reached toward his dick and as the shaft grew hard, he started to run the appendage up and down it, but for reasons he couldn&#39;t understand, was unable to get his rocks off, as well as feel comfortable doing what he was doing. Lowering his hand after a bit, he missed it as his tail continued to grow in length and red fur started to appear as he pressed his back end to the carpet and began to rub himself against it like an animal. Finding the rough surface wasn&#39;t doing it for him, Tyler stumbled toward Jeff&#39;s bed, his thoughts on the sex doll and what it could do to help, and unaware of other transformations occurring he stepped across the room on all fours without a second thought to it. Reaching the bed, Tyler crawled up on it, but changing his mind as he felt the fabric rub against his hard member, he instead positioned himself, squatted down, and started to rub himself against the soft cotton comforter and sheets that covered his brother&#39;s bed, much in the same way an animal would masturbate.<br />
<br />
Jeff saw this and was torn which horrified him more; the notion of what was happening before him or that Tyler was befouling his bed. Wanting to tell the twerp to stop, and livid that he couldn&#39;t, Jeff would have given a grunt of annoyance and surprise when everything shifted with the twelve year old boy’s rhythm and Jeff found himself sliding to the floor.<br />
<br />
He couldn’t figure out what, as it was so hard to think straight, but there was something wrong. A hunk of comforter gripped in his hand, Tyler continued to thrust against it until it didn’t seem right and he switched to rubbing against the fabric. Cumming, he arched back his head and uttered a combination of a moan and a groan. Not caring that he&#39;d made a mess on his brother&#39;s bed, Tyler slid off the bed and to the floor. Lying where he was for a bit, he took a moment to relish in how good what he’d done felt before he forced himself up. Taking a couple shaky steps, he stopped when it came to him he was again down on all fours. Feeling comfortable, unsure how else he went about, he decided to try something and reaching out to grabbed at the bed, he forced himself to stand on two legs. Leaning forward, he wanted to drop back to all fours, and worried that something had gone wrong with his transformation, Tyler wanted to go check the Chronivac, but stopped when he became aware that the colour of his hand was wrong.<br />
<br />
No longer the same shade as before, he stared at the black appendage, noting that the colouring went about three quarters of the way up his arm before the hue became the russet shade of a fox. Struggling to make his mind work, he stared at the red skin of his arm, looked at his other arm, saw the same, peered at his feet and legs, again saw the same, and stopped when he noticed that it wasn&#39;t just his skin colour that had changed. Staring down at his privates, he gaped as he tried to come to terms that he didn&#39;t have his usual boy parts, unable to think of them as anything but that, and that instead he had what was clearly girl parts. A fox like whimper escaped him as he reached down to touch himself, and at the last moment he pulled his hand away as he thought, “This, not, what wanted,&quot; and dropping to all fours, unaware he&#39;d done so, he headed for Jeff&#39;s mirror.<br />
<br />
Upon reaching the reflective device, he forced himself up on two legs and stared into it. A stranger peered back at him as he stared and feeling like he’d lose his balance, he reached out an put a small hand on the mirror to steady himself. Trying to ignore the urge to drop back down to all fours, he studied the person he saw, wondering what the hell had happened, why he’d transformed so much, finding his thoughts were sluggish and difficult to put together. Seeing that he was now bald, he stared for a moment at that and how his ears now came to a point before he glanced down at the extra nipples he now had, the flat groin that indicated he was now female, his feet that were now paws and the that his body was now russet, whilst it looked like he had black socks covering his feet, hands, lower legs and arms.<br />
<br />
Another whimper escaped him and he lowered his arm. Dropping back to all fours, he turned about in place and he twisted his head and looked back at his tail. Staring at it and the reflected image of his anus, now an exposed pucker, and his female genitals, positioned in the proper place an animal’s would be, he uttered a fox-like whine. Taking a moment to organise his thoughts, he eventually was able to think, &quot;I wanted, tail, only. Not, this,&quot; and his mind starting to wage a battle between which he was, animal or human, and what he was, boy or vixen, he stepped away from the mirror. Heading over to the laptop, he received another shock when he forced himself to stand and he discovered he was smaller. Failing to understand that, if he was able to measure himself, he&#39;d be about two foot ten to three foot tall, Tyler dropped to all fours and leapt up onto the chair. Placing his hands before the laptop, he stared blankly at the computer and cocked his head as he stared blankly at the machine.<br />
<br />
Part of him that was shrinking knew he had to do something, something that&#39;d fix the mess he was in. Yet, at the same time, another part that was more dominate, and growing more so, didn&#39;t care a fig about the laptop and the programme that was running. Staring at the screen, trying to get his mind to focus, Tyler knew he had to do something to fix the mess he&#39;d made, but the mental imbalance that existed between his animal self and human self made it so difficult that he want to bark out his frustration.</p>
