<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I quietly explored his body in a way I couldn’t before, quickly I realized Drew was a very heavy sleeper as you traced the outline of my stomach. Soon enough getting the courage to actually sit up and play with his body. I thought of it as a fun way to explore... like it I had a life-like doll. I wasn’t brave enough to feel under my shirt just yet, but marveled at Drew’s sculpted body while his chest and abs still had a softness to them that I liked. I figured there must be hair under there. Admiring it, 'Damn!' I thought as I started to get hard again. Well, apparently my body was taking quite a liking to Drew. I wanted to sleep by his side, so, carefully laying back down, next to him this time so I could play with his chest a bit. I was a fairly light sleeper, so I knew I'd be awake as soon as when he woke up, another thing for me to look forward to. I moved his arm so that it 'held' me. Drew was like a giant lump and though his arm was heavy I could move it easily enough to get it where it needed to be for me to get comfortable.  And so I did, moving that big furry arm so it was cradling me, using Drew’s bicep as a pillow. I leaned into his chest, moving his hand so that it was on my belly before I finally, and comfortably fell asleep with the first person I have ever loved. Though Drew didn’t know it, his severe rash of bad relationships left him jaded and in the hole, so to speak. He wasn’t sure how to react to me. But another thing he didn’t know was, as I grew on him so quickly, he was beginning to really fall for me. He probably wouldn’t have called it love, it more like the stepping stones that lead to it for him.<br />
<br />
	My eyes closed, I felt the warm, near noon sunlight in the room. I felt something even warmer against me and realized that I was naked. My heart began beating fast as I realized I hadn't dreamed all this up. Calming down, I started listening to Drew’s heartbeat. I was wondering when he'd wake up, but I didn't want to do anything to wake him, though. Staring up at the ceiling, smiling, I thought about how lucky I had suddenly became.<br />
<br />
	Drew groaned a bit as he stretched, slowly waking up and there I was, still waiting for him to wake up. He grinned, catching on, &quot;Morning, Mark.&quot; He put his arm back where he had found it when he had woke, around me. &quot;Sleep well?&quot; I wrapped my arms around him, looking up at him, admiring Drew’s blue eyes that contrasted against his dark brown hair, as I snuggled up against him. &quot;Very.&quot; I grinned. Drew squinted as he adjusted to the light in the room. Then he smiled and yawned, rolling over opposite of me and moved his clock, &quot;12:23. I have work at 6,&quot; he rolled back over to face me. &quot;So, that gives you five hours to tell me what you want me to do for you, right?&quot; I smiled, putting an arm back over his side. Starting to wonder now what I would do at 6 when I would be alone. Drew chuckled, &quot;What you can do for me?&quot; He rubbed my bare chest, &quot;You’re not my slave, Kid.&quot; He was teasing me, by calling me ‘Kid.’ In a way it was degrading, yet feeling that kind of power or being 'that guy' did get him off a bit. <br />
<br />
	&quot;Well, what do you want me to be? Your roommate?&quot; I ask, not really knowing what I was going to be doing while living here, just knowing that anything was better than my old empty shell of a home. &quot;Well you can be.. my boyfriend but roommate is just fine if you’re not up to it.&quot; He grinned laying back down, his hands behind his head. He was calm and smug and expectant.  &quot;Yeah?&quot; I get up, holding myself above him. I grinned at him below me thinking, ‘Heheh, he's not really such a tough guy as much he's a big, cuddly softie.'<br />
<br />
	&quot;‘Yeah?’ Like I said you don’t have to be,&quot; He grinned scratching his stomach ,&quot;I took you in, no strings attached. You can leave if you want, when you want.&quot; He figured by my reaction from before, that I wouldn’t pack up and leave now &quot;Maybe I want some strings attached.&quot; I smirked, still looking down at Drew’s face below me. Instead of seeing him as having such a coarse appearance, I was finding that face comforting instead. He grinned, scratching his cheek. His beard grew fast, the stubble was more noticeable now, than it was the night before. &quot;Well, I can’t tell you what strings those would be, you’d have to be my boyfriend. Otherwise, it defeats the purpose.&quot; I chuckled, lowering myself onto him, just an inch above his face before pressing my lips against his for a moment. Holding myself up, noticing that his hands had moved onto my back in a near embrace, I grinned, &quot;Does that count as a 'yes?'&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Hope so!&quot; Drew grunted as he held me tightly against his body. The top of my head was against his neck as I returned the hug. &quot;Well.. I don't plan on going anywhere... boyfriend.&quot; I smile, kissing that neck. &quot;Good,&quot; He looked up as I licked his neck and Adam’s apple, &quot;So what do you want to do?&quot; He said while my lips were still on his moving Adam’s apple. <br />
<br />
	&quot;Well... I've never really lived in a house like this...&quot; I say, biting my lower lip a bit. &quot;It was better than cardboard though. Gangs never messed with me since I didn't have anything to steal that was worth the trouble.” &quot;Well you don’t have to worry about that now. You never have to go back to that place.&quot; He rubbed my round ass again. &quot;Thank you..&quot; I said, rubbing my head against him affectionately. ‘He might have trouble getting to work with me clinging to him like this,’ I thought with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
	Drew grinned &quot;What?&quot; he moved his hands to my lower back to seem less sexual. &quot;I'll let your landlord know that you’re moving out so you don’t even have to go back there.&quot; He grinned proudly, thinking, ‘I am going to do a fantastic job protecting you,’ &quot;Heh, I doubt anyone will know I'm missing, except for whoever's prolly already taken my 'house.'&quot; &quot;But you paid rent, right?&quot; His hands idled on my soft lower back, his thumbs caressing my spine and the dimples of my ass. &quot;No.. there was no one to pay rent to. Not for that neighborhood, anyways. I all but lived under a bridge...&quot; I said, hoping that I wasn't making myself seem like trash, unsuitable for him. &quot;Your stuff? Is it worth picking up?&quot; Drew asked, figuring that he definitely would have to get me new clothes now. &quot;Just an old cot and a broken alarm clock...&quot; I said, not really caring about anything in that 'house.'<br />
<br />
	&quot;Alright. Well after work I might be late. I’ll pick you up something to wear on the way home. Just going to need your pant size, that kind of thing so I don’t get the wrong sizes.&quot; He smiled putting his hands around my waist on either side. He could almost reach around with a few inches to spare. That either meant I had a tiny waist or he had big hands. Smiling, I nod, &quot;Well... I'm pretty sure you'll be able to find me when you get back.&quot; I smirk. I didn't particularly care what kind of clothes styles he decided on, but just the fact that he was getting me new clothes meant a lot to me. Drew grinned &quot;I'll call the house for your size when I get off work. Just be home then otherwise your free to wander around.&quot; I laugh, &quot;I'll still be wandering around this mansion you get back.&quot; &quot;Hardly a mansion, bud.&quot; He kissed my forehead.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Well.. has more than one room,&quot; I grin, shifting myself up so I could kiss Drew on his lips. I grin, &quot;You're really... sexy.&quot; I say, staring at him. &quot;Careful what you say, remember how you’re sitting, bud.&quot; He grinned, his cock stirring by all my flirting. He kissed me back after his 'warning.' &quot;I know.. I'm just telling the truth.&quot; I grin, rolling off him to his side, &quot;Just wanted to make sure you knew.&quot; I chuckled. He smiled putting his hand on his crotch to hide his growing arousal. He looked at my naked body once over. &quot;So what now?&quot; I put my hand on his big belly, it wasn't fat, but 'big' was a good word for it. &quot;Well, I figure you're hungry.&quot; <br />
<br />
	&quot;Yeah&quot; He grinned, glad that I was talking more today than I had last night. Under the circumstances, he understood though. &quot;What are you hungry for?&quot; &quot;Anything I don't have to dig through garbage cans for.&quot; I say with a smirk that showed that was exactly what I had to do at times. &quot;Well you need not worry about that, you can dig through my fridge!&quot; Drew tried to make light of the situation as he slid to the edge of the bed and sat up. <br />
<br />
	I followed, sitting beside him, pulling my boxers towards me with a foot. He grinned, liking that I were so touchy feely. It felt like I was a addition to himself as I draped my arms over his shoulders. &quot;You know... I don't ever want to leave you..&quot; I said as I looked down and slipped my boxers on. He stood up as I purposely caught my finger on his waist band exposing his plump and hairy bubble butt. Drew grinned as he pulled his boxers back up quickly. &quot;Like what you saw there?&quot; he laughed. &quot;It's nice and fuzzy,&quot; I grinned, standing up next to him. I was curious to see every inch of him. And at the rate the two of us were going, I probably would. Drew grinned &quot;Well that’s the last you’ll see of it, my little bottom boy!&quot; &quot;I dunno, I like your bottom, but I wouldn't call it little.&quot; I teased, messing with his words as I followed him while he walked to the bedroom door. He rolled his eyes just meaning that HE was THE top, ‘I don’t bottom at all, ever.. That’s final!’ or so he thought &quot;Rigghtt...&quot; He led me to the kitchen and opened the fridge for me &quot;Take what you want and I will make it for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
	I just stood there and stared in slack-jawed awe. I had never seen so much food in one place, food that wasn't rotten at or anything else. &quot;Well...&quot; Drew grinned, &quot;Some eggs, ham, breakfast stuff, steak, burgers, salad, juice, beer, some lunch meat and fruit down here…&quot; He played with his bellybutton as I just stared in amazement.  &quot;Wha-whatever's easiest for you...&quot; I say, turning to Drew, my mouth still ajar slightly. &quot;Come on, Kid, pick your food.&quot; He nudged me a bit, “Anything’s easy enough to prepare.” I grabbed some lunch meat, ketchup and started looking around for buns and such. Drew’s kitchen alone was larger than my old home. I was really gonna enjoy getting used to this house. Drew watched me look around as he leaned down and opened the bread box with buns and sliced bread, &quot;Here you go, sweet cheeks.&quot;  &quot;Thanks... sweet heart.&quot; I smirk, teasing him as I pull out slices of meat and put them on the bread. I grinned over at him, still amazed at all of this. He got out some turkey, cheese, and sliced bread. After I was done with the ketchup, he put some on his own sandwich. He got us paper plates and stood there munching on his sandwich while I marveled at things that Drew thought were normal. &quot;Now don’t empty out my fridge while I’m gone. I know how you twinks are bottomless pits!&quot; &quot;Yeah right, tubby.&quot; I grin, knowing that he was hardly fat. I got closer and nudged him with my shoulder smiling.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Hah! You would be surprised at how little I do eat,&quot; He normally ate just twice a day with a small meal in between to keep his protein intake high for muscle mass. He slapped his hard stomach making a loud 'smack' noise, &quot;That sound tubby to you?&quot; &quot;Oh yeah, very.&quot; I chuckled, setting my plate down to rub his hard abs, looking at the hem of his shirt at the bottom, wondering what was underneath, but I wasn't gonna look if he didn't want me to, despite what I did in the bedroom with his pants. Drew grinned, he could tell that I wanted to see more. He started to pull his shirt up an inch at a time until I could see his midriff. There, I could see where his pubes stopped and his happy 'trail' began, but it easily went the full length from either side of his abs I grin back at Drew, &quot;Mmm, you are pretty fuzzy.&quot; I chuckle, &quot;Does that mean I can call you my big teddy bear?&quot; I tease, playing with his belly, trying to tickle him. He grinned, ticklish and he wasn’t holding back, &quot;Yeah you can call me what you like.&quot; Drew grabbed my hand sliding it up under his shirt. I felt that it was thick closer to his pubic area, sort of thinned out around the edges of his abs, but a consistent thickness up in the center. As my hands inched closer to his chest, the hair just continued to become more pelt-like, Drew’s chest was matted in thick dark hair, which now I noticed that I had seen the discoloration of dark hair though his shirt, not having noticed it before. &quot;So what do you think of that?&quot; Drew asked, seeing that I was focusing my eyes on his chest while my fingers combed through it.</p>
