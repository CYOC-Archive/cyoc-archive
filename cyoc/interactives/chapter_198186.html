<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Y-you look like you&#39;re enjoying this...&quot; Kyle had barely been able to finish his sentence before he suddenly felt every limb become clamped by a hand with a steel grip.<br />
Within a split second, Kyle went from lying on his back on a soft bed to being suspended three feet above the ground facing the floor. That soft bed was gone, now replaced by a large patch of long, razor sharp needles jutting out from the carpeting and ending bare inches away from his face. The carpeting around the spikes was seemingly melting, taking on a soft, fleshy color, and out of the corner of his eyes, he could see the quaint patterns of the wallpaper flow downwards, leaving only the bare wooden planks of the cabin behind. The hands pulled harder, leaving his naked body fully spread above the spikes as he felt two sets of warm breath down his neck.<br />
Jennifer laughed in stereo. &quot;I am, as a matter of fact. You leaving the changes to chance like a moron has created something truly... wonderful.&quot;<br />
That last word of hers echoed around the room for several seconds. From what Kyle could hear, at least one more head had grown on the torso that was just above him, and he could see mouths popping out of the floor, repeating her words. Jennifer was putting on one hell of a show for her guest, and Kyle was aptly terrified.<br />
&quot;W-what are y-you going to do to me? W-why did you go through all... all this?&quot; Kyle could barely get his words out, and he was only met by another chuckle, but only from one voice. Kyle could sense the heads and torso behind him shriveling away as he saw the floor in front of him begin to churn. Jennifer&#39;s form began to rise out of the flesh-colored sludge, just away from the bed of spikes Kyle was suspended on.<br />
This, however, was not the Jennifer he had seen just prior. Only bothering to form herself from the waist up, she seemed to float on a column of flesh as her features came into focus. Shining eyes and a cascade of hair that flowed down from her head like a waterfall into the floor. Not content with her pretty looks that had made her the talk of the school, she stretched her form into that which would rival the greatest models on the planet, expanding her breasts and hips to unbelievable proportions. Even as she started talking, she continued changing herself; wings grew and sank out of her back, tendrils rose out of the floor and brushed against Kyle, and her eyes and hair would gradually go through numerous color changes. She looked like a demon. She looked like a mermaid. She looked like a goddess. She was change itself.<br />
She spoke with only one voice now, but it reverberated with power. &quot;I&#39;ll be straight with you; I&#39;m pissed off at the fact that you cursed me to begin with, and as you can see below you, I&#39;m quite ready to get some well-deserved revenge.” Kyle could swear he saw the spikes grow a few inches taller. He was certain that if he coughed, he would find himself with several holes in his face.<br />
“However, given how good of a mood I’m in, I’m feeling like giving you one chance to not end up a mutilated corpse.”<br />
The tendrils and hands holding him in place twitched slightly. Kyle gulped and stayed silent.<br />
“I don’t want there to be a single possibility of me losing out on all this, and the only way I see of that happening is if I get hit with another transformation. What if the cookie tomorrow makes me inanimate? All the stretchiness in the world wouldn’t help me then.”<br />
She leaned over the bed of spikes. Several started to pierce her torso, but she seemed completely unaffected. With one hand that was unfeasibly soft and uncomfortably warm, she stroked Kyle’s face. “We wouldn’t want that happening, would we?”<br />
“To this end, I’m going to have you do the one thing I can’t do myself. I want you to Transform or Dare me again.” Kyle was a bit confused at first, but it soon dawned on him of what she was asking of him. Jennifer had since formed a pair of long, shapely legs and started circling him; each step causing her foot to meld into her floor of flesh slightly before separating.<br />
“You will Dare me to never be affected by this town’s curse again. I will not be Transformed, I will not be Dared, and nobody else can possibly affect me indirectly with a curse of their own And for my transformation you will make so if any piece of my body is to end up inside someone else&#39;s body either by them swallowing it or... other means I will gain full control over their body and be able to shapeshift it at will” The body circling him had dissolved outside of his field of vision, but another soon rose out of the floor in front of him. She kept the previous body’s appearance, but was now significantly bigger. Consisting of parts only from the midriff up, her upper torso filled the room; her arms were folded in front of her, and her massive breasts rested gently on the floor, heaving gently. Her body gave off an intense heat and emitted a luxurious aroma. She smiled cruelly.<br />
“Those exact words and ONLY those words. A single misplaced syllable, and…” Kyle felt all four hands suddenly release. He was in momentary freefall, and expected to feel the sharp pain of being impaled at any instant. At the last moment, however, he felt the vice-like grip on each limb return and keep him suspended. He had dropped a foot and a half, but the spikes below him had shrank down by the same amount. He was in just as much danger as he was before, perhaps even more so as he could start feeling the needle-like tips press against his chest. The control she had over her body and form was both blindingly fast and mechanically precise. He had no hope of escape.<br />
Kyle could just squeeze out a few words between his intense breathing and pounding heart. “You-you’ll let me go then, right?” Jennifer’s monstrous frame leaned forward, he smile unbroken as her teeth began shifting in her mouth, forming a full row of fangs. Her eyes filled with color as her pupils and irises faded away leaving nothing but a blazing red inferno in its place. The structure of the cabin itself began to creak and bend as the mounds of flesh left scattered about began to tremble with excitement.<br />
“Maybe, if I&#39;m feeling generous. But I could also have some fun with you...”<br />
Kyle let out a long breath of resignation. He was drenched in sweat, lightheaded, and bleeding slightly from a few points that he had been pricked by. The will of this omnifarious nightmare was absolute.<br />
As he began to speak the words requested of him, Jennifer’s excitement could be contained no longer. Separate bodies began sprouting all over the house and collapsing back into piles of putty. Every surface in the cabin began to form replicas of her vagina, and the entire building began to reek of her lust.<br />
“Transform or Dare?”<br />
“Dare”<br />
Kyle sighed. “I dare you to never be affected by this town’s curse again. You will not be Transformed, You will not be Dared, and nobody else can possibly affect you indirectly with a curse of their own.”<br />
Jennifer didn’t feel any different, but that was besides the point. She knew her plan had succeeded. The spikes, tendrils, hands, and piles of flesh all began to collapse and collect inward as her main body shrunk down to normal human proportions. With her potential fully realized, Kyle could only look on in horror at what was to come...</p>
