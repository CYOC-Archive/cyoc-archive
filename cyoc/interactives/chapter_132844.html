<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was all too much, the animals whizzing by, so you went back to the home menu and simply chose the &#39;farm&#39; section.  Inside, there was your usual assortment of barnyard beasts.  Owing to the fact that no pigs were shown during the tour, you decide you might as well give them some love.<br />
<br />
That choice made, you&#39;re presented with several more questions that seem to aim down the type of Noah beast this pig will be. The first one asked as to the name of this particular pig.  Thinking for a moment, you decide on Rose, as you figure the pig will smell anything but like a flower.<br />
<br />
Continuing on, the next question went to weight.  It varied from fifty pounds to &#39;standard large&#39; at 700 lbs.  Beyond that, two more magnitudes with you choosing the &#39;1,200 super sow&#39; option since why not?<br />
<br />
Next was fertility level.  At the bottom, &#39;Ice cold&#39; provided a .01% chance of some piglets.  On the other end, &#39;Easy Bullseye&#39; gave 99.98% chance of success.  Since you didn&#39;t really want to leave this whole ride with nothing to show for it- and thinking this would end up giving you a stuffed pig or flimsy certificate- you went for the &#39;Easy Bullseye&#39; and that pretty much guaranteed prize chance.<br />
<br />
The following question had to do with gestation cycle and while it defaulted to a standard 120 days, you were always a little impatient and the sound of the &#39;Super Sow&#39; option- a mere 10 days until a litter- was too good to pass up.<br />
<br />
The fifth question was, oddly, what your favorite food was.  The options available made it hard not to just pick an easy one; pizza.<br />
<br />
Finally, the last question was less fun.  It was a checkbox with a linked terms and conditions.  Not wanting to waste more time, you confirm and get a smiling pixelated pig face with &#39;Thank you, piggy!&#39; written in pink letters, of course. <br />
<br />
Then things went quiet and you looked around for where something might be coming from.  You spy, to your left, a six foot long metal trough that was empty, attached to a sealed chute. Other than that, and some loose hay spread out over metal floor grating, it seemed to be nothing more than a disappoint. A pit forms in your stomach that you first take for wasting time on the ride but it soon starts to spread into a general queasiness. It spread to a dizzy feeling that you had to shake off. Hand on your head, you slowly regain your composure.<br />
<br />
Looking up again, you notice something strange.  The display panel, once something you looked down at, was close to eye to eye now.  The grinning pig face still smiling wide as it looks at you.<br />
<br />
Taking a step, you have to catch yourself on the wall to stop from tripping as the cuff of your jeans slipped under your sneaker.  Odd since these fit you perfectly well this morning when you put them on. Then came a soreness in your knees followed by two loud pops in your hips that cause you to cry out. As you start to look down, you see that your legs appear shorter, though still somewhat stocky.  And despite losing four, no, six inches, your waist was still snug.<br />
<br />
Then came the tightness in your shoulders, and arms, and you start to develop a cold sweat. Looking down at your arms, you&#39;re able to see what was happening to your legs; both forearm and bicep were retracting, pulling in as if the bones were getting smaller.  Even with that happening, your arms remained rather thick of flesh but still, it was almost too much to believe. While inspecting your arms down to your hands, you almost notice something with your fingers.<br />
<br />
The skin near the index and middle finger of your right hand was starting to merge while your left pinky was already attached to your left ring finger.  To make matters worse, your nails were turning a dark black and thickening, growing heavier. Suddenly there was a whirl of mechanical parts and you&#39;re left looking around to see what is happening next. <br />
<br />
The chute near the trough opened and out poured a slurry of grey matter with chunks that spread an odor that only churned your stomach. Holding your stomach to try and keep it settled, you&#39;re surprised to see that you&#39;re developing a gut rapidly. Your shirt was stretching but the growth, now starting to spread further up your torso, was quickly amassing weight on you. You were just 190 lbs before, but if there had been a scale handy, you would have not liked to see that you were now closer to 300.  And climbing.<br />
<br />
With your weight growing at varying speeds on your body, and your feet feeling cramped and unable to keep you stable, it was no wonder you fell backwards, landing with a terrific slam. Your shirt ripped up the middle, stopping at your chest but revealing your chunky belly.  It was then you also saw the red buds that forms two rows that lined up with your nipples, which you only now notice are sticking out on top of a fat girl&#39;s B cup.<br />
<br />
A series of pops in your ears and your spine starts to lengthen, adding more inches back but to your torso, while your legs have growth stubby, short, with fat hocks for thighs.  You wiggle your shoes off which were only hanging on at this point.  After seeing what had befallen your cramped and pained feet, you wish you hadn&#39;t.  While you had struggled to keep your fingers form merging, your feet and toes worked quickly and having torn through your socks, you were left with pig&#39;s trotters.<br />
<br />
When you went to cry out again, it finished in a high pitched squeal. <br />
<br />
Your belt snaps off as your waist keeps gaining weight and your stomach only seems to grow out and up, making your frame, from above, looking more and more porcine.<br />
<br />
But you have to fight it.  This isn&#39;t real and can&#39;t be happening, right?<br />
<br />
You first start to rock from side to side until, at last, you&#39;re able to get to your hands and feet.  Though, your fingers have mostly merged and the nails have grown to make most of your hand as well.  Wobbly on your new hindquarters, you can&#39;t help but feet the massive weight you carry while looking straight down.<br />
<br />
Then, a tight feeling in your bowels and you bite your lip. It&#39;s too late though.<br />
<br />
Your tight pants are quickly flooded as your new asshole opens to release what smells distinctively like a sty in heat. Your face is beat red as your try to clench but only feeling your body pushing out pound after pound of pig shit until the inevitable happens.  Unfortunately for you, eyes peeling back between your legs, you see the chaos as your pants and underwear practically explode, caking much of the wall behind you as your ass pushed out a few more sloppy turds before you felt you could move yourself away from it safely.<br />
<br />
Lifting your head, which was almost completely unchanged down to your now swollen fat neck and jowls, tears were streaming down your face as odd feelings emanated from your stained rear. More pops and cracks, and your hips shift and ass cheeks fully spread.  This reveals not only your curl of a pig tail, but the swollen sow cunt now dripping and swallowing up the remnants of your tiny cock and withered balls. While you couldn&#39;t see it, the flood of hormones put an image in your head that confirmed your switch in gender.<br />
<br />
You move yourself further away from the mounds of shit you made, only to bump into the trough.  It&#39;s only now, with your lifted head just above the lip of the trough, you smelled the vaguely pizza aroma coming from the slop.<br />
<br />
Whereas at first sight, you nearly hurled into the slop, now your tongue felt wet and stomach was wanting. Your lips quivering, you tried to fight it.  Your nose, however, kept sniffing.  And sniffing.  Your nostrils flared larger and larger and the stinging in your nose of the from the trough started turning into a dull pain.  Opening your eyes, you see a round ridge forming around your nose and as your jaw stiffened, your could feel your face starting to push out.<br />
<br />
Tears still wetting your fattening cheeks, you shut your eyes tight and open your mouth as wide as you can before dunking your whole face into the slop. The first few bites are vile, and you do throw up in your mouth, only to eat it up along with more and more.  It wasn&#39;t tasting any better, but you simply couldn&#39;t help but want to fill the aching need in your stomach. Your face continued to change, evidenced only when you lifted your head to breath and briefly chew before diving back in.<br />
<br />
At over six feet long, with 12 teats, and 700, no, 800, no... 1,000 and gaining more as your gorge yourself. Your hair has sprinkled into the food and you even managed to eat some as your weight swelled to 1,250 pounds before another uncontrolled bowel movement relieved you of 7 pounds.<br />
<br />
The trough finally emptied, your stomach is only barely satisfied but it does allow for some clarity of mind. Shaking your head removes most of the slop and you trundle slowly away from the door, feeling like someone just filled you full of really thick air.  Your head was heavy and trying to adjust to the sight of a pig snout was hard. Not as hard as what would come next, when a door opened at the other end of the room. There were heavy footsteps and loud snorts and you could smell something.  Someone.  <br />
<br />
The boar was nearly as big as you, only with more muscle, tusks, bristled hair and no human mind to regret letting what was about to happen, happen.<br />
<br />
As the boar reached you, that your eyes went to his rear end- loaded with two massive testicles and long, screwed cock already hanging out and ready.  He sniffed around you and finally to your rear end, where to shoved his snout into your swollen sex for a closer smell. The squeal you let out was joy and horror.<br />
<br />
Then, the boar did what he wanted, and mounted you.<br />
<br />
You try to move as he scrabbles to get a grip, but you can really only rotate around, you&#39;re left facing the trough yet again as you feel a probing at your new entrance.<br />
<br />
Again, the chute opens and slop fills to very grim in front of you.<br />
<br />
A minute later and the boar is in you and your eating again, the last vestiges of your humanity left to watch the sight. It was another hour before the boar was finished, leaving you the lucky &#39;Bullseye Winner&#39; as your belly starting to swell with your first piglets, along with your second meal.<br />
