<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Connor now took a deep breath as he gazed at his school. He had never been to an actual dance before.<br />
<br />
&quot;You kids have fun,&quot; Gloria exclaimed. Connor gulped, grasping Spark&#39;s hand tightly. Caleb, seeing how nervous his little brother was, now placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. &quot;Hey,&quot; he said. &quot;Relax. You&#39;re going to have a great time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure,&quot; Connor asked nervously. Caleb nodded, giving his brother a warm smile. &quot;No doubt,&quot; he smiled. &quot;Know this is a big step Connor but you got Spark with you. You&#39;ll see, your friends will be just as nervous as you.&quot; Connor simply nodded, maybe his big brother was right.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay out of trouble Spark,&quot; Caleb smirked. Spark turned, the fairy turned human frowning. &quot;Whats that supposed to mean? You think I&#39;m going to look for trouble?&quot; Gloria and Caleb both glanced at one another before nodding, Spark grunting in annoyance. <br />
<br />
As the two preteens now entered the gym, Connor and Dparks eyes went wide at the scene. The gym was illuminated in a light blue color, giving the gym a wintery feel. Adorning the walls and ceilings Spark and Connor could see snowmen, presents, and holiday themed pictures hanging everywhere. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Spark gasped. &quot;It looks so pretty.&quot; Connor nodded, glancing around the gymnasium. Already he could see several seventh and eighth graders milling about. In typical middle school fashion it appeared the boys were on one side as the girls stood on the other. The two preteens could see some of students nervously glancing across the gym either giggling or blushing furiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;So um Spark,&quot; Connor stammered. &quot;Want to see what they have to eat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait they have food here,&quot; Spark exclaimed, to which Connor nodded. The preteen squealing excitedly as she now dragged Connor inside. <br />
<br />
Finding the refreshment area Connor now tried tobstifle a laugh as Spark tore through soda, chips, and cupcakes. &quot;Oh my GOD this is delicious,&quot; she moaned. &quot;Whk made all this anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be me,&quot; an older woman stated with a smile. Spark now studied the woman carefully as she gave a polite wave. &quot;I&#39;m Mrs. Leary,&quot; she said. &quot;My granddaughter goes here. I said I would volunteer to help out tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well the food is delicious,&quot; Spark said in between bites. Mrs. Leary thanked Spark, a warm smile etched on her face. &quot;Glad you like it,&quot; she said. &quot;I remember what is what like going to these dances. Always alot of fun but it does work up an appetite.&quot; Mrs Leary now sighed as she gazed out at the dance floor. &quot;Oh how I miss those days.&quot; An impish smirk now spread across Sparks face as she now pulled Connor to the side.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think,&quot; she smirked. &quot;Want to have a bit of fun?&quot; Connor shifted nervously, before nodding. &quot;Okay but we gotta change her back at the end of the night.&quot; Spark agreed, promising to change Mrs. Leary back at the end of the dance as Glorias ring began to glow.<br />
<br />
Spark and Connor watched as the grey in Mrs. Leary&#39;s hair began to darken to its original black. The two preteens watched as the lines around the older womans eyes faded as her skin began to brighten. Soon instead of a woman pushing 6o, a young woman of barely 30 stood.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Leary continued to youthen, backtracking through her 20s her body began to firm. The extra weight of her adult years melting away to leave the young woman with a curvy yet firm figure. As Mrs. Leary or Leah, descended into her teens, Spark and Connor watched her become skinnier. Leah&#39;s breasts firming before shrinking in size, going from C cups to B cups by the time she returned to high school.  <br />
<br />
As Leah now exited High school and became a middle school girl once more, Connor and Spark watched the girl shrink. Leah&#39;s face rounded, her eyes becoming wide an innocent. The girls breasts continued to grow smaller, her limbs growing thinner and shorter. As the regression completed, Spark and Connor beheld a skinny 12 year old with raven hair. Leah now blinked, flashing the two a bright smile. &quot;Hey Connor whose your friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um this is Spark,&quot; Connor said, memories of Leah now forming in his mind. Leah smiled, shaking Sparks hand as she now made her way towards the dance floor. &quot;Well you guys want to dance or what?&quot;<br />
<br />
As the trio now began to dance, they couldn&#39;t help but enjoy themselves. The memories of Leah told them that the girl was quiet yet friendly. She had become quick friends with Connor but nothing romantic existed between them. The start of a slow dance now caused the group to pause, Leah excusing herself as Spark and Connor stood awkwardly for a moment. &quot;You want to dance Spark?&quot;<br />
<br />
Spark nodded, placing her hands on Connors shoulders as he placed his on her hips. The two quiet for a moment as they shyly avoided eye contact. &quot;So umm are you having fun Spark?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Spark said quietly. &quot;Although I have one question. How do girls walk in these shoes? My feet are killing me!&quot; Connor glanced down, looking at the flats Spark was wearing. &quot;No clue but I know some girls where heels and supposedly those hurt even more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See this why I don&#39;t wear shoes when I&#39;m a fairy.&quot; Connor chuckled, the ice effectively broken as the two now smiled at eachother throughout the rest of the dance.<br />
<br />
As the song completed, Spark excused herself. Heading to the refreshment table, Spark now accidentally knocked into a rather handsome 13 year old. &quot;Oops sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No worries,&quot; he smiled. The boy now paused as he looked Spark over. &quot;I&#39;m Chad. Are you new here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just visiting from out of town,&quot; Spark said. &quot;Nice to meet you.&quot; Chad smiled as Spark touched the boys shoulder before making her way towards the bathroom.<br />
<br />
One of the problems Spark had discovered when becoming human was trying to pee. All of the clothes she need to move out of the way to relieve herself seemed so unnecessary to the fairy. Finishing her business, Spark now made her way to the sink, taking a moment to admire her appearance. She had to admit, the dress and her green hair certainly made her look cute.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey new girl!&quot;<br />
<br />
Spark turned, spying a group of five eighth grade girls now enter the bathroom. &quot;Hi you girls having fun,&quot; she said. The lead girl giving Spark a snide smile as she now stood next to Spark. The girl standing taller than the seventh grade girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;What were you doing with my boyfriend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Boyfriend,&quot; Spark asked, obviously confused.<br />
<br />
The girl nodded, placing her hands on her hips. &quot;Yeah Chad he&#39;s my boyfriend!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um okay,&quot; Spark shrugged. &quot;We talked but that was it. And it was brief so whats your deal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you believe this little bitch Missy,&quot; one girl said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know Vicky,&quot; Missy smirked. Missy now pushed Spark roughly, knocking the smaller girl back. &quot;Stay away from Chad freak!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or what,&quot; Spark scoffed. &quot;Besides not my type. So piss off Missy!&quot; Spark now turned away once more fixing her hair in the mirror. Without warning Missy now dumped an entire cup of soda on Spark, causing the fairy to gasp.<br />
<br />
Spark turned, looking over her stained dress, her face sticky with soda. &quot;Awww gonna cry freak?&quot;<br />
<br />
Spark scowled, stomping away from the girls towards the bathroom door. &quot;Thats right freak,&quot; Missy heckled. &quot;Run away and cry!&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead of running, Spark now took a broom, jamming it into the door to prevent anyone from coming in or anyone from leaving. Spark now smirked, kicking off her shoes as she cracked her knuckles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who said anything about leaving.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor now wondered where Spark had gotten off too. She had said she was going to grab a drink but that had been 15 minutes ago. Glancing around the gym, he now gasped as he saw her approach.<br />
<br />
Spark was smiling, her dress torn and wet. Carrying her shoes with her, the fairy now approached Connor barefoot with a contented smile on her face. Connor immediately noticing the fat lip and small cut on her eyebrow. &quot;Spark what happened!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing much,&quot; she smiled. &quot;Had to use the bathroom. Ran into a couple of girlfriends. We talked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Connor to ask a murmur now rose from the crowd. Turning Connor could only gape at the five eighth graders that now stumbled out of the bathroom. The group looked like they had been in a car wreck, their hair a mess, their eyes swollen, and their dresses torn. Connor now turned to Spark, the fairy turned human blushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah we might want to leave now.&quot;</p>
