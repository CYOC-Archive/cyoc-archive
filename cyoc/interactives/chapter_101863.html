<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke had came to Joshua&#39;s house before when he needed to take him to a swimming event in the high school but he had never entered his house and this wasn&#39;t the best moment to make a visit. So, he thought the best thing he could do was to look for the kids and watch them at distance. Even that, he needed to wear something to cover his member. He knew Joshua&#39;s brother Randy because he was in the same high school as he but he didn&#39;t get along very well with him. He thought that maybe he could sneak inside the house and take some of his underwear to use. He had heard that Randy was very popular in the high school because of his big dick, so this was the moment to prove if it was true.<br />
Meanwhile, Randy was at the bathroom pissing. He had come from a party and he had drunk a lot, so he was pissing like a hose. Then he heard a weird voice calling him, he didn&#39;t recognized it because it was too deep but as he was waiting for his friend Vince to come, he thought it was him. He asked if it was Vince, but he didn&#39;t get a response.<br />
Luke entered the house from behind and carefully he sneaked through the romos.<br />
Damn. This house is huge! He thought and then he entered in a room which turned out to be Joshua&#39;s parents room. He saw the pool and thought this house was amazing. I should try to be friend of Randy to be able to swim in his pool...<br />
Randy finished pissing and he went to the living room to wait until Vince arrived. He was about to turn on the TV when he heard some noises coming from his room. He thought that maybe Vince had arrived and he was making a prank to him. He smiled thinking Vince wasn&#39;t good making pranks and then Randy went upstairs to bust him.<br />
Luke had found a big thong that Joshua&#39;s father had get from an april&#39;s fool prank at his office. Joshua&#39;s father had thought it was so ridiculously big that nobody could wear it but he didn&#39;t expect that someone like Luke would have a dick as big. The thong was a little uncomfortable but it was the best thing Luke could wear in his situation. Now he has some clothes, he was going to look for the kids.<br />
When Randy arrived to his room he didn&#39;t find anybody, but he saw that all his underwear had been taken out from his locker. What kind of joke is this, Vince? He thought. Oh, well. I could put on a speedo right now and to be ready for the pool when I found Vince. Maybe he could want one too, I&#39;ll take the one he always wear. Randy took two speedos from the floor, a green one he wore at the moment and another one in red color for Vince. Then, he returned to the living room to watch some tv.<br />
Luke had heard some noises coming from a lot of places, so he thought his best choice was to hide himself outside the house. He left Joshua&#39;s parent&#39;s room and went to the stable which were too apart from the rest of the house.<br />
At the moment, Vince was arriving the place. Randy opened him the door and, after some talk about the jokes, he wore the speedo that Randy had for him. They went to the pool and jumped inside. Raul and his friends were at Joshua&#39;s parents bedroom where the full pool can be seen. So, when they saw that Randy was going to the pool they quickly hid behind the bed waiting for a change to go to another room.<br />
Randy and Vince were swimming for a while when Vince saw something odd moving near the stable.<br />
What&#39;s that? He said and because he wasn&#39;t a smart guy he didn&#39;t care too much about it and returned to his swimming.<br />
Randy turned to see what Vince was saying and he saw a human body running near the stabble. He thought that it could be a thief so he left the pool. As he was a member of the football team in high school, he thought that he could tackle him without thinking that he could have a gun or something like that. Randy ran as fast as he can and then he tackled the person who was around the stable. When he recovered himself he saw that it was Luke.<br />
Dude, what are you doing here? Randy said. I thought you was at school with my little brother.<br />
I was. Luke said while he stood up. But he and his friends left the class and I assumed they came here.<br />
Maybe... I heard they will have a sleepover while my parents aren&#39;t here. Randy said. I should take care of them but I have my own plans, you know. If you&#39;re looking for them why don&#39;t you wait in the pool with me and Vince, I mean, you&#39;re a swimming teacher and you&#39;re already wearing a speedo... Then, Randy saw that Luke was wearing a thong instead with a very big bulge and he laughed of how ridiculous it was. What&#39;s that? Hahaha, your traveling bag or did you hid your towel inside?<br />
Randy started to touch it like if it was a trash bag, Luke was trying to don&#39;t be aroused so he can make Randy to stop talking about it. But, when Randy took the thong by the upside, he knew what he will going to do. Luke tried to avoid it, but Randy was faster and stronger than him. Then, Randy left Luke&#39;s dick to be free at his full glory.<br />
What the...!! Randy shouted. Is that yours? Luke nodded embarrassed. You know that I&#39;m known as Randy Rex in the school because of my big package but you must be known as the XXXLuke with that monster! Hahaha. Dude. let Vince to see your dong! Vince!! Vince!!<br />
I don&#39;t want to... Luke said. I&#39;m not supposed to be this big, it&#39;s impractical for swimming, I think I need to leave. Say the kids I came and I will call them later, ok?<br />
Come on, dude. Randy said. Don&#39;t be affraid of your manhood. I know a lot of chicks who will die for ridding you. Come on, join us in the pool and let&#39;s talk about it without jokes, ok?<br />
Luke wasn&#39;t sure but he saw the pool. It was as big as the high school&#39;s one and he can&#39;t resist to take a moment to swim. Even he can heard some advices from Randy to handle his now big dick. So, he accepted the offer and went to the pool with Randy and Vince. He took off his windbreaker and jumped to the pool making a big splash.</p>
