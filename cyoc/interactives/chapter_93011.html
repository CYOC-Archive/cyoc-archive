<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Daniel stood up from the bed panting, the rush from eating the cake was intense. Her entire body felt supremely energized and she felt like she had just drank entire case of energy drinks. She felt even more lighter and she found that her mind was even more aware than before she could see everything like it was in high definition and smell and hear everything much more clearer than ever before. Daniel took note of what the doctor had said however and was curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean by that Doctor? I thought I was human again?&quot; Daniel asked suddenly curious although not in the least bit upset. Laura just shook her head and sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you look human&quot; Laura stated cryptically. Daniel just tilted her head in confusion and looked down at herself. Still naked with everything on display.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel human and everything feels normal...well besides the breasts and the ...you know&quot; Daniel gestured towards her crotch. Noticing for the first time that her vagina had a small trimmed tuft of white and red colored hair above it. Daniel turned to the reflective window in her room and studied her reflection. A beautiful petite red-head with large perky breasts stared back. Her skin was a light dusty pale white with small freckles that dotted her face and luscious thighs and ass cheeks. Her nipples were a bright rosy red and she could see some of the skin past her labia was an even darker red. Daniel turned around and saw that her backside matched her breasts in simialr size, her wide hips swelled into a taut but apple shaped ass. The creature before her in he mirror had that typical fiery red headed bombshell look and she found herself hypnotized by the reflection. Daniel shook his head and turned back towards the doctor.<br />
<br />
&quot;I look human...what about me isnt human? I dont feel or look like cake anymore and look! I have fingers!&quot; Daniel then eagerly waved his hands in the air and waggled his fingers excitedly. Laura just laughed lightly at Daniels antics easing her nerves.<br />
<br />
&quot;well..you see the conversion process was almost completely done by the time we used the new process to bring you back...so there were still some hiccups we need to work out and since you were literally our first test subject we didnt know what the results would be. While we are happy with the results technically you arent fully human. You are more like...a more durable mobile pastry&quot; Doctor Laura tried to explain. Daniel stopped her finger waving and stared at her hands once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;I dont....understand..&quot; She began to grope her body, she could feel her skin beneath her fingers, flesh on flesh. She felt her face and head and felt her teeth and tongue and her hair felt like real hair and was confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel like a real person, Last time I checked pastries dont have teeth and hair doc&quot; Daniel pouted as she stood with her arms crossed below her breasts and blushed as she brushed against her nipples. Doctor Laura shook her head and sighed as she approached Daniel slowly. When she got close enough she gently cupped Daniels face and looked down at her with a sad smile. She petted her hair and then grabbed one the long red bangs that obscured her face and yanked hard and quick. Daniel was caught off guard as she felt the tug at her scalp and then suddenly and painlessly a long lock of her hair was grasped within the doctors fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;He...hey!&quot; Daniel gasped as she patted her head at the spot where her hair was ripped off. The Doctor just grinned and took the lock of hair and brought it to her face and sniffed it. Daniel quirked her red haired eyebrow in confusion and then her eyes widened in shock as she watched the Doctor bite off a chunk of her hair and chew it. The Doctor had a pleased smile on her face while she munched on Daniels hair and swallowed, she then licked the remaining hair in her hand and began to rub it together with both hands. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wha..what?&quot; Daniel gasped from the bizarre actions of the Doctor. When she was satisfied the Doctor stopped rubbing her palms together and held them out for Daniel to see. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sugar&quot; Laura said simply. Daniel saw that the hair in her hand was now a small ball of ...melting red sugar! Daniel gasped as she touched it and felt that it was indeed sticky and sugary and even smelled faintly of strawberries.<br />
<br />
&quot;But...Im ...human?&quot; Daniel sobbed quietly as she fell back onto the bed in shock. Doctor Laura was quick to pull her into an embrace and let her cry into her shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;I ...dont...know whats....wrong with...me&quot; Daniel cried through choking sobs, she could smell something sweet as her tears grew. When she pulled away Doctor laura wiped her tears from her cheeks and on a whim popped her fingers in her mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Honey&quot; Laura said, Daniel just stared and then began to laugh and cry simultaneously. Daniel folded fully into Doctor Lauras comforting embrace as she soothed her and rocked her like a parent for their child. When Daniels sobs died down she reluctantly broke the embrace and steadied herself on the bed once more wiping her honey tears from her face and giving the Doctor a shy smile. <br />
<br />
&quot;Im sorry Doc...I dont know why...Im just a bit emotional right now...&quot; Daniel said slowly while she breathed deeply. Doctor Laura just nodded her head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dont Worry about it Sugar&quot; Laura said and gave a little wink for her pun. Daniel cracked a smile and felt more at ease. Daniel was silent for a few moments and prepared herself to what she needed to ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, even though I feel and look human...Im...not...am I still cake?&quot; Daniel asked cautiously. Doctor Laura nodded her head slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Technically you&#39;re human-like. Your blood is pure strawberry syrup, your organs are now comprised completely out of strawberry flesh, your skin is made out of a very advanced realistic vanilla fondant over a layer of vanilla sponge cake and your bones are made out of hard sugar candy. Your muscles and tendons are comprised of strawberry taffy, your hair is made from srawberry flavored blown sugar and your pubic hair is actually cotton candy. While you look like a normal human girl you still have all the properties of a cake.&quot; Doctor Laura listed off while Daniel just nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Im still a cake then? figures....but at least Im...at least I can move, and see and breath and feel and ....eat?&quot; Daniel looked back over to the tray of food she tested earlier. When she was eating the rest of the food she had a complete lack of appetite and hunger. And most of the meats and vegetables she nibbled on tasted bland or even terrible and caused her stomach to knot up, however she was just happy to taste she never noticed that the normal foods made her feel terrible. However when she bit into the strawberry cake it was like heaven and her entire body responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;So does that mean I can only eat sugary stuff?&quot; Daniel asked, already accepting the fact that she wasnt human, however anything is better than being an immobile piece of food in a fridge for months and months.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its what we expected really, since your body is primarily pastry, I dont know if you noticed but your mucus, and your tears obviously are all honey and even your breast milk is just strawberry syrup so it makes sense that you would need a high or strictly sugar only diet...we assume flour and milk are edible and beneficial to you as well.&quot; Doctor Laura explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait....breast milk....but...im not pregnant&quot; Daniel gasped as she studied her breasts, cautiously squeezing her nipple on her left breast and watching in astonishment as a small bead of red syrup dribbled out. Daniel stared at the Doctor in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh, no. But honestly you&#39;re entire being alive really is a mystery so lactating syrup is just another part of that mystery. As far as we know you&#39;re a fully functioning female and we dont even know what sexual intercourse would be for a .....&quot;person&quot; such as you, you have all the internals and organs for birth even though they&#39;re now made entirely of food but...well it doesnt seem like you would be compatible&quot; The Doctor explained, while Daniel had a strange cross eyed look on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I uhh aint willing to test that theory Im still straight even though Im currently a girl&quot; Daniel said as she shuddered at the thought of a man coming on to her for sex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, technically that would make you gay and a lesbian.&quot; Laura giggled while Daniel blushed. Daniel asked one more question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm....what about going to the bathroom...&quot; Daniel asked uncomfortably.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, I dont know if you noticed but you no longer even have an anus&quot; Daniel just stared mouth agape and stood up as she patted down her ass, a quick groping of her behind found that the doctor was completely correct.<br />
<br />
&quot;See, why would a cake need an asshole?&quot; Laura explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would a cake need tits and a pussy!&quot; Daniel Argued, while she sat back down and pouted at the doc.<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax Daniel, think of it as a perk! while you&#39;re like this technically your&#39;re immortal. As long as you have a steady supply of sugar, milk and flour desserts and stuff like that you&#39;ll live forever. You&#39;ll never age or wrinkle, never sag or feel pain or disease. You can even withstand higher and lower than normal temperatures with little to no issues. You never have to use the toilet and even sleep is almost unecessary&quot; Laura said in exuberance.<br />
<br />
&quot;I dont need to sleep?&quot; Daniel asked in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you&#39;ll get tired, but thats only when your body starts to lose sugar, as long as you have sugar your body can go on indefinitely. Hell as long as you have a few strawberries once in a while you could probably go an entire week without sleep&quot; Laura said, she seemed more excited than Daniel was for her new existence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow&quot; Daniel said with new appreciation in her voice while glancing down her new body. For a long moment she just stared at herself in the window beside the bed and turned to Laura.<br />
<br />
&quot;So....what now?...Ive been gone for....how long did the procedure take?&quot; Daniel asked, and for once Doctor Laura looked away in shame and refused to make eye contact with her. Daniel became increasingly agitated as she waited for an answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;How long Doc....Doc...come on, how long has it been&quot; Daniel asked. Laura continued to avoid her gaze and look away. Daniel moved over and grabbed the Doctor by the shoulders causing her to snap her head up, Daniel was shocked to see tears running down the Doctors cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;F....Five..&quot; She sobbed. Daniel just sagged her shoulders and sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Five days aint so bad it&#39;s just a week!&quot; Daniel shrugged and faltered when the doctor only began to cry even harder, and ball her hands into fists.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...Five years....&quot; Laura said softly. Daniel just stood in silence, listening to the doctor cry. Her arms fell limp to her sides and she stared blankly ahead with no expression. When Laura noticed this she rushed to embrace Daniel and cried into her shoulder muttering apologies and mumbling incoherently. Daniel was barely listening, still trying to accept the fact that her old life was completely gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Im so sorry, Im so sorry. My inventions were meant good, to heal and to provide a better life and entertainment for people I never meant to destroy your life Daniel, please please forgive me! I tried so hard! I dedicated everything to bring the people back that I&#39;ve hurt! I&#39;ve never meant to hurt anybody!...Oh god I know Im a monster! but please forgive me... When you and Robin elected for the procedure I couldn&#39;t have been happier I&#39;ve dedicated the last five years to restoring you an--&quot; Lauras ranting was cut off as Daniel pushed her away and stared into the crying Doctors eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Robin!...Robins alive!? She went through the same procedure?!&quot; Daniel yelled into the doctors face shaking her demanding an answer. Laura just shook her head rapidly. While Daniel completely disregarded her previous funk and quickly became joyous and excited.<br />
<br />
&quot;ROBINS ALIVE!? YES OH PLEASE TAKE ME TO HER!&quot; Daniel yelled. As she grabbed the doctors hand and dragged her towards the door completely ignoring the fact that she was still entirely naked this entire time and rushing around the facility in a blind panic in her effort to find her dear friend. Doctor Laura was just taken along for the ride as she was dragged behind the strawberry cake girl with suprising strength and suddenly stopped short as Daniel paused in the middle of the hallway. Naked and panting from running, she turned to the doctor and  shyly said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm....I think Im lost&quot; Daniel said while pouting.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take us to go see Robin....but...let me lead this time...okay sugar&quot; Laura smiled, while wiping away the remnants of her tears and composing herself. Daniel just nodded and offered her hand and let herself be guided to another part of the lab. Daniel bounced on the balls of her feet in excitement causing her large breasts to jiggle proudly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Robin....I missed you&quot; Daniel whispered.</p>
