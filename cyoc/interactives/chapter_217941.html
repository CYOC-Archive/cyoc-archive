<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The rest of the day was a figurative hell for both Bill and Tammy, both of them alternating through periods of screaming at each other, at the Stone, and desperately, desperately trying to get Gloria&#39;s attention in any way possible. Even if they all hated each other, surely Gloria would want two people (despite their appearance suggesting that they were anything but) in her mouth!<br />
<br />
But nothing they seemed to do worked, and eventually they were both subjected to a round of mind-shattering chewing as Gloria eventually popped two sticks of gum into her mouth and began chewing...And kept chewing for what seemed like an eternity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bill I-&quot; Tammy started but was overwhelmed by the completely alien feeling of being entirely unable to continue her constantly moving body and the shudder of pleasure that was cause by the taste buds on her...face? Back? Tammy wasn&#39;t really sure if she could apply anatomy to herself when she now was just part of someone else&#39;s anatomy. And the closest thing she could get to the comfort of Bill (despite his stupid wish causing all of this, she still desperately wanted to be held by him) was Gloria pushing Tammy against Bill&#39;s incredibly small but firm body and rubbing her up and down it, flicking Tammy&#39;s...&#39;tip&#39; across him. Tammy took what little solace there was and tried not to think about how...good it felt. Bill was smooth save for his bumpy &#39;head&#39;, and the throb of Gloria&#39;s pulse from within her, the rhythmic chewing...Now that the shock was wearing off and she was getting used to the other sensations...But no this was wrong. Even if Big Jon&#39;s tongue had been really...NO. NO NO NO THIS WAS WRONG! SHE&#39;S WASN&#39;T A TONGUE AND SHE WASN&#39;T SUPPOSED TO BE ATTACHED TO GLORIA!<br />
<br />
Bill, meanwhile, was simply trying to hold on to any thought long enough between the constant chewing and the pressure that came with it. He couldn&#39;t hear Tammy&#39;s attempt at communication as he slammed into his upper counterpart and pulled at the sticky wad of condensed sugar and rubberized polymers.<br />
<br />
__<br />
<br />
Eventually there was silence in Gloria&#39;s mouth. Eventually the school day had ended and after a far-too-long session of making out with what was now obviously Big Jon came an avalanche of hot food and cold drinks and the painful clatter of silverware and the thundering sounds of Gloria&#39;s exceedingly obedient and submissive conversation with her mother. Then silence again as Bill and Tammy once again weakly called out to their...captor? Host?...Owner?<br />
<br />
Their mental states had been so greatly reduced over the course of the day that the thought of being anything other than completely exhausted had largely left their minds.<br />
<br />
&quot;God I hope we get to sleep&quot; Tammy muttered darkly as Gloria curled her former boyfriend against the pair of incisors at the front of her mouth, a breeze of cool air sliding past her as the cheerleader was obviously focused on something. Anything beyond Gloria&#39;s mouth was near impossible to make out, just a glare of vague shapes, shadows and light that were far too often blocked by the fleshy gates of Gloria&#39;s lipsticks (which tasted far worse on the back end than they ever had when Tammy...when TOM had kissed them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh...Glo-GLORIA, LISTEN!&quot; Bill struggled, his mental voice little more than a croak.<br />
<br />
But silence was all that responded.<br />
<br />
Eventually something long, hard and covered with bristles slid into their prison and began scrubbing, which was the first pleasant sensation that Bill had felt all day. It was hard at first, then turned to a soft stroking as the toothbrush worked it&#39;s way up and down Bill&#39;s body and he felt a layer of...something being pulled off, destroyed, and tiny particles of food sliding out of the tiniest gaps between himself and the other teeth next to him.<br />
<br />
For Tammy it was less pleasant as she was forced to taste the toothpaste up close and personal. She HATED toothpaste. She had ALWAYS hated toothpaste, even when she&#39;d been...What had she been again? A guy? It was getting really hard to recall anything beyond just constantly moving and tasting things.<br />
<br />
But then after a gush of water, the strange sensation of gargling an then the sensation of spitting passed, there was once again silence. The constant thumping of Gloria&#39;s heartbeat around Bill, the pulsing of it within Tammy&#39;s body...The stillness, warmth and darkness pressing around them...Had their situation not been nightmarish, it may have actually been cozy.<br />
<br />
Tammy yawned mentally as she began to zone out. She wasn&#39;t sure if it was sleep, but the sensation felt like when she&#39;d be right on the cusp of it. She felt her weight settled into the cradle of Gloria&#39;s jaw, her near-formless mass spreading out through Gloria&#39;s mouth and pressing against the other teeth, the inner cheeks, and entirely over Bill, who simply let out a muffled mental gasp as he too was covered. The geeky former teen had begun to find comfort in the pressure of his fellow teeth, and Tammy&#39;s weight and heat, putting his closer to the hypnotic thumping of Gloria&#39;s heartbeat.<br />
<br />
He let out a loud mental yawn as he approached the near-mindlessness of sleep and prayed, to whoever might be listening, that this had just been an awful, awful nightmare and he&#39;d wake up...somewhere else. Somewhere...soft? Much like Tammy, over the course of the day, the constant thundering of Gloria&#39;s voice, the chewing, it was just too hard to keep track of anything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gloria...&quot; He yawned again as he slipped away...<br />
<br />
&quot;WHO THE FUCK WAS THAT!?&quot; Gloria suddenly screamed, shaking the tooth and the tongue awake.<br />
<br />
Option 1: Gloria remembers Bill and Tammy, but had no idea where they went after the wish! The three try to communicate but it proves to be extremely difficult as Gloria can only hear Bill and Tammy when she&#39;s focusing on them and nothing else in a meditative state.<br />
<br />
Option 2: Gloria has no memory of Bill or Tammy, and CERTAINLY no memory of voices in her head. Bill and Tammy struggle to convince Gloria that they&#39;re people, and what happened while those around Gloria grow increasingly concerned that she&#39;s had a mental breakdown.</p>
