<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer stuffed her enormous boobs back into her cheerleading shell. It was a good thing the material had had a plunging top and some elasticity to it, or else they never would have fit. A couple of dark spots quickly appeared where her nipples were, and were apparently still leaking a bit.<br />
<br />
Her mom closed the door to the principal&#39;s office behind them. Classes were still in session and the hallways were pretty much empty, except for the janitor who was sweeping the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy, I made a huge poopy in my panties again, and I have to get cleaned up!&quot; she said, lifting up the hem of her cheerleading skirt to show her mom the misshapen globe sized mass in her elastic cheer panties. Jennifer latched onto her mom, squeezing her with a tight hug, her head nestled between her Mom&#39;s ample bosom. Hazel was having none of this and pushed her away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer, STOP acting like a baby this instant and put these on. I don&#39;t want you fouling up your cheerleading uniform any more than you already have. You&#39;ll need it for the competition tonight.&quot; she said, handing Jennifer a bag full of clothes. &quot;I went through your laundry hamper and had a hard time finding a pair of your underwear that didn&#39;t have poop or poop stains in them, so for now you&#39;ll just have to wear a pair of mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer reached into the bag and pulled out a pair of sheer panties with a little pink bow on the front of the waistband. She held them up and although they would be snug on her Mom, they would barely just fit her waist without falling off. She looked at her mom and was about to protest, however judging from her expression and foot tapping, now probably wasn&#39;t the best time.<br />
<br />
Jennifer scurried into the bathroom, and emerged a few minutes later wearing a cute red button down top and short plaid skirt, which came down to just below her thighs. She handed her Mom her cheerleading uniform and befouled panties to be cleaned.<br />
<br />
She bent down to slip on her Mary Janes, giving full view of her bum through her very transparent panties. Standing up straight, she looked fit as a fiddle and ready to head to her last class of the day. The bell rang, as students hurriedly poured out from their classrooms. Glancing at her watch, she realized it was time for pre-calculus. Not exactly her favorite subject.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Jennifer, you&#39;d best run along now, you don&#39;t want to be late for your last class of the day. I&#39;ll get these washed up for the competition and I&#39;ll see you after school.&quot; Hazel said, and turned about face down the long corridor to the school&#39;s front door.<br />
<br />
Jennifer walked into the classroom where her math teacher, Mrs. Jones, was sitting and making notes in her day planner. She could faintly hear a scream from the hall, which sounded like Kimberly, who had probably just discovered the surprise Jennifer had left for her in her locker. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to see you again, Jennifer.&quot; Mrs. Jones said, looking up and smiling. She pulled her reading glasses to the tip of her nose as she said this, and readjusted them back into place moments later. The young brunette teacher had just returned from maternity leave, after having twins. She was wearing a tight blouse which showcased two benefits of her maternity.<br />
<br />
&quot;You too Mrs. J!&quot; said Jennifer, as she sat down. She opened up her binder, hearing jeers and snickers from the classmates who had been present when she fouled her yoga pants earlier that day. She vowed that she would not repeat that mistake, and would control herself no matter what.<br />
<br />
Her heart leaped in her throat as she saw Kyle enter the room. He walked past her desk, slowing as he did to give her a wink and grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle, you&#39;re not even in pre-calc!&quot; she said in angry whisper, giving him the stink eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tsk, tsk. I&#39;m always looking to better myself, and Mrs. Jones said it&#39;d be okay. Besides, with you around these classes are always so much more interesting.&quot; Kyle joked, sitting down two rows behind her, off in the corner.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Jones sat up from her desk and went to the chalkboard behind her, intended to start today&#39;s class.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright class, before we move forward with the next unit of material I&#39;d like to do a quick review of the last thing Mr. Perry covered while I was away.&quot; She said, flipping through her lesson plan book.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who can come up and write down the quadratic formula for me?  For ax2 + bx + c = 0, the value of x is given by...&quot; she said, holding the piece of chalk in her hand.<br />
<br />
There were no volunteers. Scanning the classroom, Mrs. Jones made eye contact with Jennifer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh, Jennifer. Please come up and show the class the quadratic formula.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer hesitantly got out of her desk, and took the chalk out of Mrs. Jones&#39;s hand. She got as far as &#39;x =&#39; before she heard a shout from the back of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, show us how smart you are, poopy pants Jennifer!&quot; Kyle shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not AGAIN!&quot; Jennifer cried, visibly annoyed. The chalk dropped from her hand to the floor and broke, while her knees bent, exposing the lower seat of her panties to her slack-jawed classmates. Placing her hand on the chalkboard, she stuck out her ass in plain view of her classmates who watched with strange fascination as her anus visibly dilated by 3 inches, giving way to a massive, knobby turd that emerged into the seat of her very transparent panties.<br />
<br />
&quot;Again?!&quot; several classmates gasped in unison. Some pointed their fingers, others laughed and some just sat there, their jaws agape.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer, what on earth are you doing?!&quot; her teacher shouted, also shocked at the sight before her.<br />
<br />
By now, the thick 14&quot; inch turd was pulling her the back of her panties taut, like someone was slowly shoving a thick pole down the back of her panties.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Mrs. Jones... I can&#39;t... stopoooooohhhhmygod!!!&quot; Jennifer screamed, although her protest was fleeting - her visible arousal suddenly outweighed any potential embarrassment.<br />
<br />
Jennifer reached back and touched the seat of her panties, placing her hand underneath it. This caused the turd to bend at the back of her gusset, forming a backwards &quot;J&quot; shape, guiding it forward between her legs. The firm turd finally broke off as it reached the front waistband of her panties, nestled against her pussy. From the front, it looked as if she was suddenly sporting a huge cock. At that point, not her classmates, nor her teacher being there mattered. All she cared about was filling her panties with as much poop as she possibly could.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;m gonna be sick!&quot; one girl in the front row shouted, as she ran from the classroom. Several more students followed.<br />
<br />
Slightly softer poo began to emerge now at an incredible volume, coiling around like soft serve ice cream, filling her panties from the gusset up to the back of the waistband. A dazed look crossed Jennifer&#39;s face as she began to grind her pelvis into the mass of shit in her panties which was, so far, contained due to them being quite spacious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmmm...&quot; Jennifer moaned in pleasure, quickly buillding towards orgasm. She began to massage one of her breasts we her free hand, which caused milk to start leaking from it. By now, there was so much poop in her see-through panties that her butt was now completely obscured by the brown, stinky mass which showed no signs of abating. Her short skirt was resting atop the mass in her panties and did little to cover anything up.<br />
<br />
A combination of the big turd rubbing against her pussy and clit and the ass stimulation from the pooping drove her to the brink. She took her index finger and rapidly fingered her clit over her panties.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m cummmminggg!&quot; she cried out, as she had an orgasm in plain view of her teacher and classmates.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer, your behavior is piggish and abhorrent... I want you out of my class... NOW! No objections!&quot; Mrs. Jones scolded, red faced.<br />
<br />
Jennifer, still a bit dazed from her orgasm, saw Mrs. Jones standing there with her arms folded, and Kyle still sitting in his desk. It was as if a big lightbulb had gone off over his head, and raised his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Kyle?&quot; Mrs. Jones said.</p>
