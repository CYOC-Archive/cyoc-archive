<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alice started to dig through her bag once more.  &quot;Unlike the last couple, this change is going to take some preparation.  So, have any questions?&quot;<br />
<br />
Your mind reeled with all the possible questions.  Which ones were the most important?  &quot;What am I going to do with my family?  My job? Won&#39;t people n-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry about that.  Unlike Todd, I&#39;m a good owner.  You&#39;ll be able to return to your regular life, and talk with whoever.  There&#39;s going to be some additional rules, but most of those will be self-enforced.  You&#39;ll probably reconsider your job after you learn the full extent of the rules, but who knows?  Maybe you&#39;ll like the familiar setting.  The important part is that I&#39;m not Todd.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Todd&#39;s a witch too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Todd&#39;s a male, so that makes him a warlock.  He&#39;s also an asshole that breaks his own promises, apparently.  Fortunately, you bumped into me before he got his hands on you, else I&#39;d have both missed out on our deal and I&#39;d have no proof.&quot;  She stopped writing symbols and patterns around you to rub her hands together.  &quot;I can definitely bring this up with the Coven for more benefits...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice snapped back to drawing on the floor.  &quot;Oh!  The Coven is...Pretty much a home owner&#39;s association or police force, but for witches and warlocks.  Keeps people honest between each other.  Keeps everyone from killing each other.  Punishes those that break the rules, including breaking promises between each other.&quot;  She paused.  &quot;When you&#39;re able to walk again, would you like to see what your future would have been if Todd nabbed you first?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not-&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice interrupted you again.  &quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry.  He keeps his pocket dimension in his shed so it&#39;s not a hike.  Also, Todd won&#39;t have a choice and I think it&#39;ll be very good for you to recognize just how bad high-borne can treat low-borne they own.  Todd isn&#39;t even the worst, but I think you&#39;ll appreciate what I&#39;m not doing once you see it.&quot;<br />
<br />
You weren&#39;t sure how you should respond to all this information.  &quot;I...Guess?&quot;  There was an awkward silence, so you decided to change the subject.  &quot;Why did you think I wanted a goat udder?&quot;<br />
<br />
She smirked.  &quot;Well, you know.  Males are used to something hanging between their legs.  Now you&#39;ve got a comparatively giant thing hanging down there.  At the same time, it&#39;s like a big loincloth.  Now, you won&#39;t have to worry about having your genitals on display whenever you face someone.&quot;  <br />
<br />
You&#39;d almost forgotten about your nude form due to all the additions she&#39;d made.  There was no way you&#39;d be able to wear most normal clothes after this.  &quot;Why did you make these...Boobs...So large?&quot;<br />
<br />
You heard a scoff from behind.  &quot;You think those are large?  You&#39;re gonna flip when you see Todd&#39;s low-borne.  No, yours are just large enough that you can milk them yourself, or at least hook a machine to your teats when needed.  In the world of magic, you&#39;re running about the most average number of tits right now: eight.  Only difference is how yours are situated.&quot;  She paused.  &quot;I&#39;m almost done, so let&#39;s do a little temporary trick, just to show you what I&#39;m talking about.&quot;<br />
<br />
You heard a brief whisper, and your lowest udder flared with heat.  It didn&#39;t take long to realize it was growing once more, since you felt it slam unceremoniously into the floor and your feet.  It was a nauseating heat, and in mere moments you could see it spilling into view.  More and more of the floor was swallowed by it, and it started pressing upward as well as outward.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long until you felt it collide with the wall in front of you, though it was several feet away.  When it did so, the growth started pushing at your legs, threatening to pull you off the ground to make more space.  That was when the heat began to dissipate.  Laying on the floor, the crest of this mammoth goat udder was now taller than you.  The teats looked larger than a human, splaying outward where they had met the wall, with one of them pressing into the door and the other moving closer to the hallway.  You were horrified by this sea of gelatinous flesh.<br />
<br />
Alice walked around the side, patting her hand on the udder.  &quot;I could make it plenty bigger, but you could guess how much of a pain it would be to squeeze the milk out of one of these things.  And even worse, I&#39;d have to be the one to do it.  I&#39;d also need to wash this whale of a thing so nothing gets fungal.  Complete mess, if you&#39;d ask me.&quot;  She muttered something once more, and the udder slowly began to deflate, pulling back into your body.  It was much slower in returning to you than it had pushing outward.<br />
<br />
You decided to use this time for another question.  &quot;What are you going to do to me next?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me put it nicely.  I&#39;m going to add a few legs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your eyes widened.  &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s another productive thing that I can stick on you, and it should balance you out for movement purposes.  I think you&#39;re really not going to like it, so we&#39;re going with the surprise route.&quot;  She paused for a few seconds longer.  &quot;Oh, looks like your udder is back to normal.  Let&#39;s begin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, w-&quot;. Was about as far as you could get before you felt the words stick in your throat, and her whispering became chanting.  Something was preventing you from talking, but that didn&#39;t seem to matter as the floor&#39;s symbols began to glow an unearthly green.<br />
<br />
Your body was slowly lowered into a seated position, with your feet splayed wide.  The feeling of your cow udder pressing into your goat udder was entirely alien, and extremely uncomfortable.  You then began to feel a strange pull on your legs.  The other changes had felt like pressure escaping from your body, but this felt like your bones were being pulled out of your skin in every direction.  <br />
<br />
As you watched, your legs began to blacken and gnarl, like they were mummifying before your eyes.  However, they continued to blacken past what would be a natural tone capable in humans, almost taking on a strangely reflective surface.  The gnarls started to end in thick spikes, and your legs pulled further from your body, reaching several feet long while being nothing more than a tube.  This blackness then began to spread up to your hips, where it crashed into your rear, taking an oblong shape that reminded you of a potato.<br />
<br />
The sensation was unforgettable as 6 more tubes erupted from the remains of your lower body, with three to each side.  A grisly green ichor coated them all, but they appeared similar to the current state of your legs.  What&#39;s worse, the misshapen bulge where your rear was began to pull on you from the inside, forcing itself to grow larger until it towered above you, blocking all vision of the room behind you.  You could feel the dull thump as it extended even further back, signaling that you&#39;d hit the table that was easily 6 feet away from you.  <br />
<br />
The tubes that surrounded you started to crack and bend until your now-massive body was suspended from the floor.  You could feel you bulbous rear still touching the floor.  That&#39;s when Alice spoke up once more.  &quot;Excellent! It worked!  Real well-done, if I say so myself!  What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
You felt more dull thumps as Alice apparently was hitting your convertible-sized back end.  You looked closer, and began to realize what Alice had done.  She&#39;d turned your lower half into that of a giant spider!  &quot;You made me a spider?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep!&quot;  She crouched under you.  &quot;Great, I even managed to keep your human vagina in-tact.  That&#39;s some pinpoint accuracy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...why?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Spider silk makes for excellent magical thread.  You&#39;re actually a blend of two spiders, which is part of why the spell was tough.  One part widow for the webbing, one part tarantula for the legs.  Now!&quot;  She clapped her hands.  &quot;You are free to move on your own.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unlike the last two times, you barely moved at all once you were released.  Perhaps it was because of the over-sized spider abdomen now hanging from your backside, or maybe it was the 8 legs widening your stance.  You definitely were more well-balanced, but at what cost?  You were now even more of a freak, and you had no idea how to move your legs.  You gave Alice a pleading look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, just will yourself forward.  You&#39;re not the first guy to grow a leg or two.&quot;  You did as she asked, and your numerous legs seemed to move with a mind of their own, propelling you forward and attempting to climb the wall before you could think of stopping.  Your breasts jiggled incessantly as your body crawled, they then tried to crush you between themselves and your spidery rear as you moved up the wall.<br />
<br />
You slowly moved backward, then turned around to face Alice.  &quot;What do I...How will I...&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice quickly moved over and patted you on the shoulder.  &quot;Look, I know you&#39;re not happy about this whole thing, but I promise you that you&#39;ll be able to get back to a normal life.  I&#39;ve only been doing the business end of things so far.  By the end of this, you&#39;ll be able to live a completely normal life with just a few extra chores.  Trust the magic lady, she has the magic to make it happen.&quot;</p>
