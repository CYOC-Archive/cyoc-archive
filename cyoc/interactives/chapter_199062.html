<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Moonbeam would want to tel the room to stop.  She would wish to stop regressing herself and a now unborn July in her womb.  But so some reason, she wouldn&#39;t.  A part of her wants to keep this going until she feels like she&#39;s ready to stop.  After all, who else would say that they watched their daughter shrinking into the ether, never to return unless she decides it.<br />
<br />
Swaying back and forth while cross legged, she hummed placed both hands on her ballooned stomach and hummed White Rabbit to the fetus of July.  Feeling it slowly shrink from eight to seven months, she smiled warmly and said to it, &quot;There there, my young one.  Just relax and enjoy the ride.  It will all be over soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Door looked at Moonbeam playing with her shrinking fetus and it worries.  It&#39;s obvious that she&#39;s aware what is happening to her and July, she doesn&#39;t seem to care.  She wanted it to keep going until she is ready.  But she has no idea how dangerous this will be.  But it hoped she stopped the process soon, otherwise no only that July will be gone, but also herself until her own mom appears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure you wish to keep going.&quot; the Door asked her, &quot;You can always stop and save your daughter from ceasing to exist.&quot;<br />
<br />
Moonbeam looked to the voice of the room and said to it, &quot;No way, voice man.  I am not ready to stop this bizarre trip until I say so.  Whatever Tex game me in those mushrooms certainly have given me a trippy experience.  It&#39;s not like everyday you see your own child going into your body and shrinking from within.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a bit of silence as the Door watched Moonbeam&#39;s stomach going down from seven to six months.  But Moonbeam decided let the air out and said, &quot;But...  If it&#39;s all right, then maybe we can talk and ask each other questions, since I did appear in a glaze.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Door was surprised that she wished to talk to it.  Normally anyone who entered the room would forget they were in there and marvel at how young they are, up to the point where they would be forever gone from existance.  Moonbeam though was different.  As a hippy who consumed strange substances in her body, she knows what&#39;s going on with her and July and act as if she&#39;s going through one of those experiences.  So considering she&#39;s talking to a voice that doesn&#39;t have a body, makes it feel special.  So with that, the Door said to her, &quot;All right...  Let&#39;s talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Moon beam smiled as her pregnancy went down to five months.  &quot;Okay...  First of all, can you ask me how I got here.&quot; Moonbeam asked, &quot;One minute I was at the compound eating Brownies and Mushrooms.  The next I wound up in this strange room where my daughter shurnk into me and is still shrinking.  Is it all a side effect from all the food laced with Tex&#39;s special medicine?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Door was quiet and answered honestly.  &quot;Actually, you should blame your granddaughter for your arrival.&quot;<br />
<br />
Moonbeam blinked and was quite shocked by that.  &quot;I...  I have a grandchild?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That and a great-grandchild.&quot;<br />
<br />
Moonbeam was a little whoozy and rubbed her head in confusion.  She thought should&#39;ve been mood swings, since her stomach was now down to four months.  &quot;Whoa...&quot; she uttered, &quot;I didn&#39;t think Tex&#39;s cooking could be that strong.  So...  I have a grand daughter and great-grand daughter?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Door was silent and explained about that.  &quot;Well...  Had is more of the correct terms.  Let me explain.  See, your great-grand daughter, Candy enter this room and asked to be little.  I accepted the request and gave her what she wanted.  But she keeps wanting more and more.  So much so that your grand daughter, Amanda, appeared and when Candy was too young, she wound up in her womb and kept going until she was un-created.  Then Amanda wishes to keep on shrinking until she&#39;s young enough until your daughter appeared and un-birthed her too.  That in turn led to your grand daughter not existing as well.  Now your daughter will be joining the two in non-existence and when that happens...  Well...  It won&#39;t end well for her as the previous two.&quot;<br />
<br />
Moonbeam, in her high mind, thought of this while her stomach went down to three months.  &quot;So...  If July goes back to being nothing and I am next...&quot;<br />
<br />
The Door responded the best that it could.  &quot;That&#39;s right, it means that you too will regress into infancy and then your mother will appear to un-birth you.  And when you join the previous three, your mother will regress into infancy and her mother will appear to do the same thing.  And then another, and another, and another.  Until the first of your generation arrives and regress into nothing, erasing that one line of women.  It&#39;s a fail-safe when someone decides to regress to the very beginning.  Only if someone ask to stop will I do that.  But until then, I&#39;m afraid you will be stuck in this eternal loop until your own existence end.&quot;<br />
<br />
Moonbeam looked up and was contemplating the whole thing as she was now two months pregnant with a slight bump on her stomach.  Thinking that, she soon smiled and said, &quot;Far out!  Me and my generation before me will be taking an interstellar trip back to the dawn of time!  That&#39;s so groovy!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Door mentally sighed and said, &quot;Yes...  It sure is groovy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Moonbeam looked down to her stomach and placed her hands on it.  When she feel her stomach getting flatter and her daughter getting smaller and simpler, she smiled warmly and said, &quot;Wow...  My little July is melting within me like ice cream.  It will be a matter of time before she will be created on the month I named her.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Door heard that and was a little shocked.  &quot;Wait a minute.&quot; it started, &quot;You named your child the month that she was conceived?&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked up to the room with her stomach going down to weeks and said, &quot;Of course.  In the commune, it is tradition that our unborn would be named the month they are created.  It&#39;s a rare tradition and a small number of kids have been named the months for their creation.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Door sighed mentally and imagine a boy named January, or a girl named August, or any child that will be named in the months that don&#39;t fit them.  &quot;Oh my...  I can only imagine how the conversation of the kids will be like when they introduce to friends, or loved ones.  Holy shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Within minutes, Moonbeam was entering the days of pregnancy as July became nothing but a ball of cells that started to divide.  The mother was feeling fluster and knew what she was feeling.  &quot;Oh...  I feel something happening in me...&quot;<br />
<br />
The Door see her lying back down and knew what was happening next.  In Moonbeam&#39;s stomach, the cells went back to on fertilize one as it days become hours.  Then a sperm tail stick out and the sperm that contains part of July&#39;s DNA separates on the egg side as the pregnancy went down to seconds.  By the time pregnancy reached zero, more sperm surrounded July&#39;s and they all swam back through the tube while the egg side went back into Moonbeam&#39;s ovaries for storage.  With the now former mother, Moonbeam was getting flushed and sweaty as she was experience sex in reverse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God...  This is it...  I can feel a part of July leaving me.&quot; she said as she screamed in orgasm.<br />
<br />
The moment she bucked her hips, white cum spewed out of her vagina and squirted onto the floor, leaving nothing but a puddle.  Taking a breather, Moonbeam sat back up and saw the white cum laying on the floor, part of it contains July&#39;s sperm.  When she saw that, the puddle quickly dried up and left the tile floor completely clean, meaning July was no more.  &quot;Looks like July ended her journey of existence.  It must&#39;ve been quite a ride for her.  Now she is gone.  I&#39;m going to miss her.&quot; she said feeling a little down knowing that her daughter no longer exist in her reality.&quot;<br />
<br />
With the room now changing color of Aqua Marine, Moonbeam&#39;s favorite, the Door itself knew that three generations of women are now gone due to the continuous regression.  Now Moonbeam is going to be the next one that will take the journey back to nothingness.  Unless she decided to stop it, it will watch her go down this psychedelic trip to her youth.</p>
