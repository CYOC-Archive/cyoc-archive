<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shafts of light cast onto Daniel, causing from him to stir from his rest. As he lay there with his eyes closed he heard a strange noise. It was a comforting noise, reminding him of the whimpers of his new pup Patrick, only amplified. <br />
<br />
That had been some night. He’d broken the “Alpha” on campus and made him swear his life long alliegience and loyalty. Patrick was his slave through and through. They had fallen asleep in the clearing.<br />
<br />
The reality of the situation started to return to Daniel. They were still in a field? This was embarrassing. He felt around. He.. wasn’t in a field. He was somewhere soft, all around him he was enveloped in the unmistakable feeling of fine silk. He opened his eyes. He was in the centre of an enormously large bed - it must have easily been 50 feet across. He was in a giant’s bed.<br />
<br />
He looked beyond the bed and into the surroundings. It was palatial, an incredible piece of architecture - the product of architects of incredible genius, matched only by the love craftsman, artisans of their respective fields. It felt like someone had lifted his personality and had lovingly interpreted it as a building. Coloured light shone on from him through a stain glass window depicting what appeared to be his night before, of himself and Patrick.<br />
<br />
Daniel’s attention was instantly turned from the architecture, and drawn to the more significant features of the sleeping chamber. A single carpet leading down the from the end head of the bed to a balcony outside. On each side of the carpet were seven enormous cot, and on top of each cot was a najked red head with blue eyes. Some of them appeared to be older than others, each of them covered with different patterns of body hair, if at all, and unique braids to their beards. They all ranged in size, the smallest of them appearing to be at least 20 feet tall and equally thick, the largest of them easily five stories tall. Each of them had collar around their neck, polished to a sparkling sheen, all of them bore the same symbol he had given Patrick the previous night. The sound he couldn’t recognise before now, it was them whimpering. <br />
<br />
The most significant thing of all among all of them was their eyes. They all had such deep blue eyes, surrounded by platnum blonde eyelashes and eyebrows. Each of them looked upon him with eyes of such complete worship and surrender, just be seeing their eyes, he could tell that there was no doubting they were his. <br />
<br />
As he walked past them on the carpet, each one fell into grovelling on their cot, each of them exalting with whimpers of excited rapture. Daniel didn’t know how he knew, but these were the reactions of people not having seen a loved one for months, not just getting out of bed.<br />
<br />
Another thing became apparent very quickly as they grovelled. Each of them had a cock at least as long as they were tall, and at least as girthy as their engorged thighs, if not their own torsos. More apparent was each of their balls, Each one had swelled to at least half the bodysize of their owner, as he watched one of the pups closely, he could see them incrementally continue to grow in size. For some of these pups, each testicle alone was at least the size of small bus. <br />
<br />
To the sides of the room, he observed that the edges of the room were declined, making a canal for all the excess precum to flow down and exit the room, falling off the far end of the room by the balcony in what looked like two waterfalls.<br />
<br />
As he stepped down he carpet through all of his 14 pups, he noticed a similar noise to the one in the room, from outside, as he got closer to the balcony the sound only got louder and louder.<br />
<br />
Thrusting open the doors, Daniel steps through the threshold and gasps at the sight before his eyes. He was at the highest point of a city. Crammed as far as the eye could see through the streets were more gingers. Each of them beaming at him with the same worshipful eyes, all of them wearing shiny collars of varying sizes, each of them bearing the mark he gave Patrick yesterday. Some of them even seemed to be larger than the huge gingers in his own sleeping chamber - how was this even possible.<br />
<br />
The cacophony of whimpers grew even louder, each of them bringing their head down in reverent grovelling. In all of their eyes, he was not a dom, not a Master, but a God - the being they surrender themselves to completely. All of the pups had testicles as large and engorged as the ones in the sleeping chamber - they looked tender, but they all seemed to enraptured by greeting their God for the morning to pay too much notice to it.<br />
<br />
Was this all a dream? Was he still in the field with Patrick? Was this something to do with the chronivac. Daniel’s mind felt hazy, but the more he concentrated the more this seemed to make sense. It was all a dream, his subconscious revisiting the day he collared his first slave. <br />
<br />
He remembered the series of events that lead up to him being here this day.<br />
<br />
It all started the night Patrick gave himself over into his Master’s service. The next morning after they woke up from the field, Patrick continued his training, the two moving off campus and finding a house for eachother. It was cheap and the space was a little tight, especially with a giant slave like Patrick, with blue eyes and red hair. But they made it work.  Patrick sold all his belongings, presenting the proceeds to his Master. He even slept on the floor, anything to give his Master a more comfortable life. <br />
<br />
Culturally, people with red hair and blue eyes have long been considered many things, sometimes considered a god from above returning to human form. More often considered a curse upon a family from a spiteful god - or bad fortune. But there were definite traits each one seemed to have in common, physically they would not only develop faster, but they would develop to at least six times the height and mass of a normal human being, allowing them to achieve incredible physical feats, they universally had cocks that extended to well beyond their own height, equally impressive would be their testicles, which would grow steadily throughout the day, continuing to engorge and fill with cum unless given explicit permission for release. A red-head’s sex drive never seemed to dissipate, steadily increasing with each orgasm. <br />
<br />
More remarkably though, was that in steep contrast to their physical stature, was that they all were deeply submissive to a fault. Forging deep life long loyalties and incredibly expressive of their affections. They are universally obedient, but the thing that drives them the very most is their need to serve, to be owned and to be loved. This need consumes redheads, making it difficult or impossible for them to function without someone to serve. <br />
<br />
Over time, Cultures have not been sure what to do with people exhibiting these special traits. Rarely could they even fit into the same buildings as their peers. Some being exiled out, and left to fend for themselves. More enterprising people would find tens if not hundreds of them and entice them with them collars and a promise of love and ownership, only to find themselves be used purely for manual labour in logging, mining and construction. The less fortunate ones being used to fight against each other for sport. Each of them far too in love with their respective owners to even consider a life otherwise, the thought alone of abandoning one’s owner is enough to cause great physical and psychological pain.  <br />
    <br />
In those early days, the bond between Daniel and his slave Patrick grew. Patrick continued to achieve beautiful and incredible things in his Master’s names - pushing the limits of his own size, learning new skills, anything that might make his Master happy. His Master would take photos and chronicle the journey of owning his newfound slave and his own experience of learning how to be a Master. <br />
<br />
One day, there was a knock on the door and there was a redhead kneeling outside their door. Even on his hands and knees, the giant redhead’s shoulders wouldn&#39;t fit through the entrance. The slave threw himself to Daniel’s feet, begging to join Patrick in service. After careful consideration, Daniel offered the new pup his own training collar. Now they were three.<br />
<br />
A few weeks later, there was another knock at the door. Daniel opened the door and there were two more - one of them taller than Patrick, but leaner. The other shorter than Patrick, but thicker - he was a real fireplug. They looked at Daniel with the same wanting eyes, the same ache for worship, to be a part of something greater than themselves. Daniel offered them both refuge, a collar and place at their feet. Now they were five. <br />
<br />
Now there was absolutely no room for all of them. Daniel considered their options, and sold the place they were living in bought an old, large house with a lot of anchorage. In those early days, they didn’t have very much to fill that big house. It was just Daniel and his four loving pups, and Daniel was glad to be serviced around the clock by his four enormous bulls. Daniel had never felt so completely loved in his life, his slaves never feeling more complete than in their total around the clock devotion. For Daniel&#39;s slaves, this had always been their life. Their submissive minds rewiring, removing anything unnecessary to serving their Master. <br />
<br />
Over the next few months, it seemed like a few redheads were arriving every day. Each one of them bringing their own expertise. Many of these were red heads that had been abandoned by their respective owners, this being the only place he felt like they could exist, something inside of them was drawing to Master Daniel. Each one was greeted wholeheartedly with a collar, a brand and a renewed purpose to exist, they existed to serve Master Daniel.   <br />
<br />
It was three months into moving into the remote cabin that the first of what would become many of his giant pups. The first was ‘Titan’ , and he was well over 80 feet tall. It was such a surreal to be grovelled to by such a goliath, but he too ached to serve Daniel with all of his heart. Titan was very easy to break, nobody had told him before that he was beautiful in his life. The first time relieving Titan of his engorged seed filled balls proved to be an explosive learning experience for the both of them.<br />
<br />
With more red heads arriving every day, the rundown old house was patched up, new bunk wings were built. New buildings continued to be added onto the large property, larger kitchens, silos, barns, chicken coups, laundries, dining halls.<br />
<br />
For the first time in the history of mankind, somebody had believed in the gingers enough to start to build gyms for their own special needs. The smallest red head scarcely fit into a gym, and none could even begin to accommodate for their tremendous strength. Master Daniel became astounded to learn that the size his slaves were endowed with proved onto to be a baseline, not only would they continue to grow significantly in musculature, but they saw significant increases in bone structure too. <br />
<br />
Master Daniel theorised that there might not be an upper limit to his slave’s size and strength - assuming that both the correct caloric and training conditions have are correct. In all the time Daniel has had his pups, his theory has not been disproven - the upper limit only being practical matters like the division of food resources and the availability of materials dense enough to satisfy the demanding training needs of the pups.<br />
<br />
Coincidentally, it was in overcoming these two challenges for the sake of powerlifting, that lead to the creation of inventions that would revolutionise the world at large. The first being new innovations in farming and processing that would create nutritionally complete and ultra calorie dense produce. These changes lead to a second worldwide green revolution, saving entire countries from the brink of starvation, and revolutionising food production at large. The second being the creation of a new stable material that was both extraordinarily dense, easy to mold and could withstand even the most brutal punishment - this ended up finding a place in construction and manufacturing.<br />
<br />
Naturally, the ownership rights to both of these breakthroughs belonged to Master Daniel. No owned ginger could ever conceive of owning anything. Master made a sizable amount of money from the proceeds of these revolutions, which he invested in buying the surrounding anchorage around his property and investing it in his ever growing family of pups. At this time, Master Daniel and his pups numbered eighty three.<br />
<br />
Another benefit to regular vigorous exercise, is that it only seemed to enhance their own inherent ‘gingerness’. Their bodies and their faces would grow furrier, their cocks would get even longer - to at least one and a half times their body length, they would get more erections during the day, their balls would grow heavier and bulkier - and grow even more engorged during the day. More impressively to Master Daniel, their psycholocal need for their Master only seemed to grow further, they became even more submissive, they craved even more to make their Master proud, (which made them only want to get bigger still). Every time Master Daniel thought he had broken a pup, or thought he had his complete surrender and submission, he would be surprised to find that they would only continue to sink deeper and give themselves over to him more.<br />
<br />
In those early days, all the pups would wake up a little before dawn from their cots in the bunkhouse. Some would start cooking breakfast for their family, many would have their first workout of the day, all of them would do something for themselves, for their brothers or around the property to make themselves better for their Master.<br />
<br />
As Master would rise, he would invite Patrick and usually about three other pups for morning service. Master prefered to have one pup to each nipple, one to his cock and one to kiss passionately - their cocks leaking heavily, the only sounds they could verbalise being horny whimpergrunts of need to serve. Other days, he would order his pups to line up in a row, having each of them beg for his cock as he rode them one at a time. In one breath they would thank their Master for the gift of his seed, and with the next beg for more. Sometimes it would be just him and Patrick - cuddled up together, like on that first night under the stars. The pups to service Master first would be allowed to do morning ritual - this was a privilege bestowed upon his most senior, most experienced, best behaved pups - and sometimes - a new one he feels is ready to know the feeling of a Master’s love physically. <br />
<br />
Before breakfast, all of his pups would line up in rows of 10 each. Each one bursting with the need to express just how grateful they are to be here serving their Master for another day. Some of the less disciplined pups came on mere sight of their Master, overwhelmed by their own arousal and need to submit. All the others could contain themselves to mere engorged, full sized erections, collectively wetting the ground to a 12 inch deep pool of their own pre, their own cocks ready to go off the moment of their Master’s consent. 82 pairs of beautiful light blue eyes, reflecting the morning’s golden light, their blond eyelashes and eyebrows looking transparent, all of their eyes wet and glistening at the mere sight of their owner.<br />
<br />
In rows of 10, each would have the chance to surround their Master and kiss his feet good morning. The alpha’s would go first naturally, then the betas, then finally the zetas. To Master Daniel, this was a very very good way to greet the morning. He found it facinating how the alphas, betas and zetas grovelled to him with their own unique energy and intensity - but each of them were uniquely belonging to him, each one in their own way saying ‘I need you’, ‘I love you’, ‘I will serve you forever’, ‘You bring purpose to my existence’<br />
<br />
After each of them had a turn at doing morning ritual to their Master, they were ordered to commence the next part of their morning ritual. The betas and the zetas were ordered to service the alphas, until given permission from their Master to cum, at which point both the zetas and the betas were instructed to drink as much of their Alpha’s cum as they possibly could, which they did so dutifully. The zetas were then to service the betas. Finally the zetas were to cum into eachother’s mouths, but true to their station, finding no sexual gratification in this. The only sexual gratification that existed for them was that of their superiors - and absolutely that of their Master. Even the sound of hearing their Master cum from afar was enough to send them headlong into an intense subspace coupled with sexual pleasure. Daniel could only help but watch this daily spectacle with his own (comparatively tiny) leaking 12 inch hard on - certainly not going unnoticed by his pups as nobody in the family wore clothes. Often he would invite a few of his Alpha’s to give him a second morning ‘service’, or have them on their hands and knees before him begging for the chance to have a single drop of his Master’s seed.   <br />
<br />
Following this the pups would then line up and be served their breakfast, then wait dutifully behind their tables or above their matts for their Master’s blessing to sit down - it was important to Master Daniel that all his pups enjoy breakfast together as a family, all as one. The pups would then break and perform their respective tasks, which they did with great vigor - often needing breaks to eat more, or to relieve themselves, to lift, or have an emotional breakdown out of missing their Master so much, or for not feeling worthy of belonging to him. Typically, it is a large part of an Alpha’s role to guide his betas and zetas through these feelings and apply them constructively, Alpha’s however are just vulnerable to these breakdowns as the pups they’ve been given to guide.<br />
<br />
The pups didn’t often seem to need to be assigned to any particular work duty, they often just seemed to find themselves gravitating towards the roles which they feel they could contribute the most to the household, to their brothers, but most of all their Master.<br />
<br />
The work duties started out rather generalised - cooking duty, cleaning duty, construction duty, farming duty, animal husbandry duty. It was imperative that each pup better himself every day, combined with the new experience coming with every new pup, this allowed for much more specialisation and innovation to occur. As the family’s numbers grew, their family only grew from strength to strength. Although some pups were tasked with having to engage with the outside world, to all of them their Master and their family was their entire world. Their memories of any previous fading before disappearing altogether.<br />
<br />
After dinner, Master Daniel would meet all the new gingers that had arrived that day. In a previous time, he may been supremely impressed by their size, but these days he saw that all new arrivals looked obviously underfed and under-exercised. He would take the pleasure of breaking them in the audience of their brothers, each of them begging tearfully with all of their hearts for Master Daniel to relieve them of the the unbearably heavy burden that was their own free will - or what little any ginger could be said to have in the first place. <br />
<br />
As Master Daniel presented them with their new name, a training collar and his brand - he would instruct his new pup that the old life they had is over, it doesn’t exist any more - not materially, not even in memory. Today he is born again as Property of Master Daniel - owned completely in mind, body and in spirit. Today he is a part of a family and a part of something greater than himself. He would then finish it off with the same promise he made Patrick that first night: <br />
<br />
“It means you’ll never be alone. It means that as long as you live you’re going to have purpose. You’ll never have to wonder whether you matter, because you’ll matter to me. No matter how far you go, or what you do, you’ll have a place to call home. Not that you’ll ever go far, because your place is with me. You’ll have my protection. You’ll have my instruction. Most of all you’ll have my love.”<br />
<br />
That’s how it was for some time, every day more gingers would arrive and find themselves a purpose and a home. The slow trickle grew into a steady flow, two or three each day, becoming five or six, becoming ten or eleven. They were always welcome and their Master’s home and surrounding buildings continued to grow to accommodate: more bunkhouses, bigger kitchens, more grovelling spaces, bigger gyms, more infrastructure. <br />
<br />
Every time they got close to building up to the edge of the boundaries of the property, Master Daniel would politely buy out the neighbours and continue to expand.  Master Daniel now owned forty square miles of land.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, on construction sites, in mines, in boxing leagues, and in private houses from San Francisco, to Paris, to Berlin, to Madrid and Moscow, there were whispers and rumours of a special place in Oregon where red heads could go and fulfill their potentials, as part of one huge family, all under the guidance and ownership of the most beautiful, kind, intelligent, loving Master ever to live. The rumours described the Master as being godly. The gingers didn’t tend to pay too much attention to these rumours in the first instance. Their loyalties of these red heads were so strong that no matter how poor their living conditions, or how cruel their owners were- they believed wholeheartedly that their Master was godly and all good. Those that weren’t owned, or who were no longer attached to an owner any more, made their way on foot the special place they had heard about.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, new gingers arriving on foot from across the continental United States and Canada were arriving by the tens by the day, many with nothing but their own cocks slung over their shoulders to keep from getting dusty. No matter how many came, Master Daniel would always greet them all personally, giving them their new names, their collar and their brand. All begging to give themselves fully and completely to their newfound Master.<br />
<br />
Powerlifting, weightlifting, and much less often olympic wrestling, were the preferred sports that the gingers would compete against themselves in. Not that Master’s gingers tended to have a competitive streaks to them, far from it. To the gingers, there was an amazing sense of gratification to be found in the quantifiable measurement of improvement these sports allowed. Contrary to what conventional wisdom might say, it was not the alpha’s who excelled the best at powerlifting, it was the zetas, who in their single minded ambition to make their Master proud and little else made them ideal candidates for becoming champions. A zeta however, can often feel overwhelmed trying to excel in too many areas at once and need some direction in their focus. In most instances, alphas would take on several betas and zetas under their instruction.<br />
<br />
The most accomplished of all of Master Daniel’s slaves in lifting was Patrick, Master Daniel’s first slave. Patrick wasn’t the tallest or greatest in mass, but on the platform he was the most formidable, competing among the top of his Master’s giants - and often winning.<br />
<br />
It is often said that a goldfish would always to continue to grow provided that they have they have the room to. The same very much could be said of Patrick with the right training and diet. Patrick was only 10ft tall and eight hundred pounds, with a three foot cock, when Master Daniel  offered him his first collar. As the days passed, he always pushed himself the harder, outgrowing his collar every few weeks. Master Daniel often held up Patrick as a model brother to his family. Patrick was always made incredibly bashful by this and was always moved to tears by his Master’s praise (which in turn moved his brothers to tears). He never allowed this praise to get to his head. Patrick was very shy, only speaking when spoken to, otherwise communicating with others with whimpers and through his expressions - and never making eye contact with anyone. <br />
<br />
At the time Master Daniel’s family reached 500. Patrick had grown up to 25ft tall, and and 20,000lbs. His collars now becoming so heavy, that they needed to be built out his pup’s special material - with matching wrist cuffs for good measure. Looking at photos of Patrick upon his first collaring, he would almost be recognisable - with each of his distinguishing characteristics amplified by a factor of ten - not only physically but psychologically. His beard - longer and redder, his chest and shoulders pushing up to greet chin and ears, his arms hanging from his sides like semi trailers, the density of fur across his body covering all of his chest, back and shoulders and butt in beautiful red swirls. his cock and balls equally momentous - each ball starting the size and weight of boulders - 10 feet in diameter at their smallest (4 feet taller than Master Daniel), his cock now 45 feet in length and 12 feet in diameter. <br />
<br />
One of the few things to stay the same were those eyes, those big, blue eyes that to his Master always seemed to say “Own me forever Master, I’m yours” - but even then that expression only seemed to grow deeper. He lived and breathed his service. His existence was no more and no less the value he brought into his Master’s life. He was his Master’s slave in the brands across his body, every thought passing through his mind, every action that he took, every expression on his face. In his submission to his Master, he was at the same time, made complete, but always striving to be better.<br />
<br />
The town comprised only of Master’s family only grew bigger, from originally a house with a few buildings in the middle, to a large estate, to a small town, to a large town. By the 14th month since owning Patrick, new gingers were arriving and begging for a collar by the hundreds each day. The 17th month marked the first time over a thousand new gingers sought a new life under the ownership of Master Daniel. It was around this time that the family raised the attention of people who didn’t have the wellbeing of red heads at heart - offering Master Daniel exorbitant amounts of money to buy up all of his gingers, Master Daniel would not even entertain their offers, they were all his family, not something to be sold and traded.<br />
<br />
It was also around this time that the family gathered a lot of attention for a very different reason. For the first time in the history of the world, an owned ginger snapped his own collar from around his neck, politely returned it to his owner, and respectfully and firmly thanked him for his time, but his services were rendered. The ginger known as ‘Bruin’ then left unceremoniously, making his way to Oregon.<br />
<br />
The news made headlines all around the world, featuring as the top news item on every news website, the front page of every newspaper, the talking point of every columnist, radio host and talking head. Nobody thought that such an act was even possible form a ginger, once a ginger was bonded to an owner, he was meant to belong to him forever, and do anything for him - so true are their slave hearts<br />
<br />
An interviewer asked Bruin during his long walk from Arkansas to Oregon why he had set himself free. Without stopping for the interviewer, he quietly and  politely corrected the interviewer “I belong to Master Daniel”. On his chest was Master Daniel’s mark, painted on with ash. Bruin continued walking without answering any more of the interviewers question. An investigation done by the same reporter found a secret shrine to Master Daniel behind a secret panel in the shared bunkhouse of his crew.<br />
<br />
When approached for comment about the incident, Master Daniel stood proudly and looked into the camera with strong assertive eyes. “Look around here. These gingers will never go another day in their lives not knowing if they are loved, or whether anything they do actually matters. Here, they are all part of a real family that cares and loves them for what they are. They all have true purpose in serving me. I love all my pups, they are all beautiful, valuable and special to me.”<br />
<br />
Master Daniel paused bashfully, thinking up his words  “I often wonder if I need them more than they need me. Not only is Bruin welcome here, but he and everyone like him are welcome here . Whether you live here in Oregon, elsewhere in the United States, or anywhere in the world even - as long you feel you belong in this family, and your place is at my feet, always - you are already one of my pups.”<br />
<br />
That night, Master Daniel’s face was the first story on the national news, his face printed onto the front page of every morning newspaper across the country. Owners of gingers across the world expected there to be massive uphevals, but no, their pups continued with their duties as usual, swore their devotions as usual - things seemed remarkably normal. They weren’t.<br />
<br />
What the owners expected was a dam breaking, the situation was much more like a dried up river bed, filling up with an incalculable number of singular drops,  coming together to make a river, and then a flood.<br />
<br />
Across the world, after the lights would go out, gingers would whisper amongst themselves about what was out there, what it would be be like to belong to Master Daniel. The ones servicing wealthier families would find ways to get online, and read the blogs of some of the pups that were there already - sometimes ones they already knew and recognised. The poorer ones would huddle around a radio, and listen to the broadcasts some of Master Daniel’s pups coordinated back in their home in Oregon. <br />
<br />
At the end of each broadcast, Master Daniel recorded a new message, but the format was usually the same, he would start by asking the red heads to breathe deep, let themselves relax deep and clear their minds of everything else, and focus their minds on their heart compels them to serve, about how much they would give to be near that person, to focus on the sensations of grovelling with that person - and pouring out that need, about how much they need to become the best versions of themselves they can be. How tomorrow would come soon, and it would be a new opportunity to start fresh and make that person proud all over again. And then go to sleep.<br />
<br />
Efficiency among gingers seemed to go up across the world, they seemed to have a glimmer of optimism in their blue eyes, they were taking better care of themselves, they were requesting more food, and improvising weightlifting equipment with whatever they could spare. In secret, shrines to Master Daniel were appearing in bunkhouses across the world, copies of Master Daniel’s mark would appear around the place, sometimes making it a game of how conspicuous it could be before they got caught.<br />
<br />
There were whispers about more gingers who were breaking off their own collars with their own hands and politely excusing themselves of duty and making their way to Oregon on foot. These rumours continued for some months before one especially startling news story: Hugo, a zeta from Spain, excused himself from his duties, tried to convince his brothers to join him to no avail, and then set out on a boat on his own across the North Atlantic Ocean. The news broke as only as only a lifeboat floated into New York harbour, carrying himself, oars and and rations of food and water. The amazing thing was that as soon as he rowed himself to a dock, he tied up the boat, strung the rations across his shoulders, and continued with his trek eastward on foot.<br />
<br />
When approached by an interviewer as he just got past the New Jersey turnpike, the 17 foot ginger, wearing a too short kilt and his own cock knotted thickly around his waist to keep it from dragging and getting hot from the asphalt. The ginger whimpered in reply, barely acknowledging the reporter verbally.<br />
<br />
The majority of people who saw the news story thought that the zeta was being uncharacteristically rude by not acknowledging the reporter, obviously his superior. Only a red head himself or someone finely attuned to their ways truly understood Hugo’s reply. Firstly, zetas are largely nonverbal, unless with people they absolutely trust, or by someone that has a direct authority over them. Of all red heads, they are the most loyal, the most giving of themselves, and the most hardworking. Once they set their heart on a task they will achieve it. The majority of the people who saw that story only heard the whimpers, they didn’t pay attention to the eyes. The blue eyes of a zeta with a task and a purpose - ones which screamed both “I belong to Master Daniel” and “Nothing will prevent me from achieving my purpose”.<br />
<br />
Hugo made it to Oregon some three months later. He did not arrive alone.<br />
<br />
The slow trickling river was turning into a torrential flow as more and more gingers dismissed themselves from their ownership. Reports coming from around the world as entire crews of gingers around the world were in unison layed down their tools, tore off eachother’s collars and then made their way together in groups of 3, or 6 or 12. The first such report coming from an opal mine in Central Australia, the next coming from the crew responsible for maintaining and operating the Panama Canal, All the competitors of the Highland Games put down their weights at once and walked out in unison.<br />
<br />
 Small groups of gingers in migration would converge upon each other, making cells of 100-200 together at once marching onward to their new home. Those cells would converge with others, with 1000s together.<br />
<br />
Master’s home, having been growing continuously for as long as it has been around, and with each ginger willing and able to give 100% of themselves to their Master and their Family, was able to keep pace with the rate of growth. Their little household technically was more economically sound than a great many countries in the world. Even though the living conditions were sometimes cramped, the average routines for each ginger living under his care would be the same, starting with each of his pups greeting him outside his house every morning, listening with tearful anticipation, hanging on his every word - and then all the pups relieving themselves of the great volumes of cum they had accumulated since the night before.<br />
<br />
By the fourth year, Master’s was the proud owner of 52,620,942 pups - each proudly wearing his collar, each one bearing his brand. Each of them with a Master to serve and a sense of purpose.<br />
Master Daniel’s ‘household’ had expanded so many times, that the area under Master Daniel’s control filled up all of Oregon - as had been negotiated. The rest of the world would see the innovations his pups brought to the world, in return his ‘household’ maintained sovereignty - with Master Daniel as it’s leader, and every red head in the world either an actual or honorary citizen. Still recognized as “Oregon” by the rest of the world, redheads simply knew of it as Home.</p>
