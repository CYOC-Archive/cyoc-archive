<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once I'd gorged myself on my morning salad and downed one small bottle of the tasty wine I was to shower and then look around.<br />
<br />
As I undressed my slender female form looked back from the bathroom wall mirror. I stretched my body and enjoyed the sexy postures I could muster. Whether it was the cold slate floor or the morning chill of the air my nipples were erect and hard.<br />
<br />
A steaming hot shower relaxed me as I sat on the seat letting the water cascade over my soft skin.<br />
<br />
A knock at the room door brought me back to reality. A scramble for towel and robe sent me running to answer the door. Looking out no sign of the knocker but standing in beauty was a tall arangement of flowers and a note.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good Morning Kathy, When your ready for a tour please join me at the start to the garden walk. You can see me from your balcony, I'm waiting!&quot;<br />
<br />
I got my butt moving and rushed putting my long brown hair into a ponytail twist and jumped into some very businesslike slacks. A few puffs of powder and a scent of this here and there and I ready in just under and hour.<br />
<br />
Walking out the french glass doors from the main lobby I saw a handsome middleaged man. Well groomed he stood a good six foot tall. A fine healthy appearance, if he were younger I'd think he was some real stud, but I best curb my imagination.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good Morning Kathy, I'm Richard Bookman, the curator for the gardens! Please walk with me as I show you where your special talants are truly needed.&quot;<br />
<br />
I smiled and walked as he explained the five different sections of the Botanical Gardens. <br />
<br />
&quot;Our Gardens are sectioned in five main areas. Please note that you are authorized in buildings 2,4,5, but please stay out of the buildings 1, and 3. Number three is under construction to house our African Jungle Exibit and is filled with workmen day and night. The project is six months behind shedule. Least of all the Pleasure Island Research Center has not sent down the primates and other animals for the exibit. Now I beg you to please not use your female notion to go inside. This is our research building and house's many rare plants, some of which eat things!&quot;<br />
<br />
As we strolled through building 2 the flower's scents made me sneeze and cough. It was so strong that when I exited the yellow pollen shook off me when I sneezed.<br />
<br />
Building 4 was filled floor to ceiling with green plants. I was amazed to see celery growing over tweleve feet tall and a pear on a tree the size of a basket ball. It was explained that these plants were now as they once grew in times long ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are the salads which seems to be the only offering as food in the Hotel made from any of these plants?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Kathy how well your mind works! Indeed the salads and food staples all come form these plants. You may see over time an increase in strength and muscle tone due to the ingesting of these extreme hormone leveled plants. In you looked even at myself you might never think of me being seventytwo last April!&quot; said Mister Bookman.<br />
<br />
Out our lasted till mid afternoon and I was getting thisty and hungry all to once. Mister Bookman must have noticed I was licking my lips or heard my stomac growl since he directed me to a small porch with a buffet of fruits and of course wine.<br />
<br />
After a long lunch I was both full and tired. I moved to a lounge chair and soon drifted off to a afternoon nap. The sounds of moaning awoke me from my slumbers as I sat up alert.<br />
<br />
I looked about turning my head to see where those mornful sounds came from. The sounds seemed to come from building three. I well remembered Mister Bookman telling me to stay out of the building, but the more I listened the more I heard.<br />
<br />
Walking toward the steps to the Garden walkway I stopped long enough to pluck a bottle of that strange wine.  As I stepped along I could see other people and maybe employees heading for the Hotel building. The afternoon light was quickly moving toward dusk as shadows became longer.<br />
<br />
I snuck up close to a side door with a clear window and peered into building three. Just like the others the plants growing about were hugh. Far to one side I saw small figures running about with buckets as if they were watering the many plants.<br />
<br />
The door to my surprise was unlocked so I creeped inside. A steel grid walkway circled the outside wall of the inner building. The steel railing was dripping with moss and mildew. The air was thick as though filled with hot humid water. A narrow isleway between the great stalks of plants suggested I jump down off the walkway.<br />
<br />
I'd walked not lees than twenty feet when a small figure ran directly up to me. &quot;You best get the Hell out of here less the curator make you like me, a slave to these damn plants!&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked from the pretty face directly in front of my face as I panned my view down her form. Sleek and slender she stood much as I before my bathroom mirror. Her qute form became much more striking as I saw her chest covered thickly in curly goatlike hairs. Her arms to were shaggy with the hair and ended up around her thick black fingers.<br />
<br />
The view of her beastial form took a terrorified thought as i saw hips, hind quarters and legs and feet as I remembered from younger years on my Grandfathers farm. &quot;Your a Goat!&quot; I exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet dear but is a few months from now you may be quite right. I responded to an add for long term employment and retirement. Instead I find my human self washed away by their crazy wines. Then as I ate the hormoned food the body changed too.&quot; she said with hate in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;How long ago did you come here?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;About nine months ago, I was to work directly under that bastard curator Bookman. Once he thought of a way I could be a direct asset to the company he arranged this over me. Now I'm becoming a goat, a nanny goar from God know's what! I runn about watering these damn plants as excersize till the hormones do their final work. Then I hear we are shipped off to another branch of Pleasure Island Corporation!&quot; she said beginning to look around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quick dear you must leave I can hear his footsteps on the walkway, if he see's me with you were both as good as goats!&quot; she said as she ran quick away like a young deer.<br />
<br />
I wiggled myself out of the plants and back down the walkway. Out the side door I ran like the devil was after me. I was filled in terror for that young girl and had some extra horror for myself.</p>
