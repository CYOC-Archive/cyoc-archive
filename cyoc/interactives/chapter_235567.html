<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff&#39;s friend Kevin came over and Jeff excitedly showed him the capabilities along with the fact that he can pick and choose who if anyone would even realize the changes... Kevin was immediately enthralled and excitedly begged to be able to use it. Jeff agreed suggesting they take turns, and laying on his bed to give Kevin a little privacy.<br />
<br />
Jeff was patient as Kevin explored all the nuances and options, playing on his phone as he waited, and smiling as his friend gasped or exclaimed at the possibilities. Finally Kevin stood up, and grabbed Jeff&#39;s attention, his face alight with exuberation. Jeff watched as his friend grew taller and began filling out with muscle. Teenage acne faded away and stubble took its place. His haircut became a stylish medium on top, fade on the sides. His clothes grew with his form turning into name brand items, and every teenage insecurity he had was addressed. <br />
<br />
Kevin became a handsome, confident 23 year old man, perfect white teeth, modest build, a little on the tall side, a better than average package though nothing one would see in porn. He would stand out in an average crowd as the taller more handsome guy, but not to a point of being intimidating or unapproachable.<br />
<br />
Jeff smirked, &quot;Looking good Kev!&quot;<br />
Kevin took Jeff&#39;s place on his bed as Jeff said, &quot;My turn.&quot;<br />
As Kevin was going on about how he had an early master&#39;s degree by taking summer summer courses since 18 and pinned down an excellent job and now has his own apartment, Jeff was plucking away at the Chronivac himself.<br />
<br />
Something in Jeff had changed a few moments ago when he changed his sexuality. He had a realization, though couldn&#39;t yet put it into words. The difference between hetero and homo now seemed so small. Some guys prefer boobs, others asses. The details tied to those preferences shifted when the gender changed, but, its all the same. It&#39;s just wanting to have fun with someone you feel safe with, maybe even center your life around them.<br />
<br />
If pressed why Jeff did what he did next, he could make up reasons. To share his new understanding with his friend, It would be easy to revert, a prank... any of those were plausible. Jeff only made one change, that was to make Kevin deeply sexually attracted to him, submissively. This didn&#39;t remove or take the place of his attraction to women.<br />
<br />
Jeff stood up after just a moment and announced he was done and it was Kevin&#39;s turn. Kevin watched expecting Jeff&#39;s body to change in some way, presumably to match him in age so they can go out as adults and enjoy rated R movies, pick up chicks at a bar, or something like that... When Jeff&#39;s body didn&#39;t change he asked, &quot;I thought we would go out on the town as adults, that&#39;s why I made myself such a catch with money, a good job, solid future. You - you&#39;re still a kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that does sound like fun. Why don&#39;t you set me up like you did for yourself, you did a really good job.&quot; Jeff said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t you want to set yourself up?&quot; Kevin asked feeling sudden butterflies at Jeff&#39;s compliment.<br />
&quot;We can change it if we need to, just make me manly and we can go out on the town.&quot; Jeff flashed a smile, unknowingly making Kevin&#39;s heart palpitate.<br />
<br />
Kevin sat and gave Jeff a makeover much like the one he gave himself but Jeff&#39;s earlier meddling and request to be more manly bounced around in Kevin&#39;s head. Kevin&#39;s frame of reference for masculinity shifted as he tried to imagine the traits Jeff would want... and he slowly realized he wanted Jeff to have certain traits himself.<br />
<br />
Kevin was awash with hormones, which he attributed to his transformation into an adult, but was actually Jeff&#39;s prank. The physical transformation ready, Kevin switched over to Jeff&#39;s mental stats, giving him a wealth of job experience ranging from mechanical to plumbing to carpentry and lots of random jobs in between... &#39;He&#39;s going to be real good with his hands, that&#39;s manly.&#39; <br />
<br />
Jeff realized it had been nearly an hour and a half since his friend began, on top of the 30 minutes he had spent on himself, meaning his parents will return from work soon and their night out will be dinner at his house. &quot;What&#39;s taking so long? You were done with yourself so much faster than this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin jumped at the sudden noise, he had been so focused he had forgotten Jeff was even there. The last hour had been reimagining Jeff&#39;s... everything... slowly edging further from a simple age progression with minor physical enhancements and having a job to give him spending money, into something else. An elaborate staged transformation, a dramatic reveal, tweaks to his personality...<br />
<br />
Kevin realized how much he had prepared to change about his best friend and was shocked at how far he went. &quot;Oh! I um...&quot; Kevin realized the changes he imagined making were too far, he had to change them back. &quot;I have like 10 more minutes of things to set up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff had been entertaining himself quietly but was bored, &quot;What?! C&#39;mon! Will it make me at least 21 and give me money?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well yeah, but...&quot; Kevin began unsure how to defend many of the changes he had fantasized about making and had prepared.<br />
<br />
Jeff walked over and clicked apply, &quot;Good enough for me! Let&#39;s go.&quot; Jeff anticipated his friend&#39;s newfound attraction caused Kevin to turn him into a muscle god recalling his own attractions while gay and wasn&#39;t too worried about becoming a handsome stud.</p>
