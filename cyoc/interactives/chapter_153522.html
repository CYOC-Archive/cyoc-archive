<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After school the next day, Johnny came home to see that his father was still not home, probably working late again. He really felt like his dad was always either not at home or yelling at him. He was given a lot of high expectations, being a middle school football player yet expected to also make headway in his classes and with little care for his social life or hobbies. Honestly, Johnny wished something could change. The whole of the prior night he had underwent changes to bring him to alignment as Kim and Simon&#39;s son, and he could still swear something was off, but he could not for the life of him see what it was.<br />
<br />
But as he did his chores he saw his dad&#39;s room door was open. He knew he was not supposed to be in there, but his twelve year old mind cooked up an excuse about needing to go in to go get some garbage or something. And as if responding to his desire for some sort of change, there it was. Laying open on the computer desk was the Chronivac, active and ready. Johnny&#39;s eyes went to it and he found himself almost feeling dragged toward it. It was like once he saw the weird little device he could not keep it off of his mind.<br />
<br />
He checked the door and listened for a moment, hearing his mother leaving the house through the front door, probably to go for her daily walk. She was always doing that. He breathed - this meant, given his father&#39;s absence, he was home alone for the time being. And trusted to just do his chores obediently.<br />
<br />
The siren call of the Chronivac complete, Johnny stood before it as he felt an odd zap as the device scanned him, depicting him in a 3D model within its screen. Something told Johnny this was not just a photo-morphing and 3D modeling device. This...this was something else. There was an odd familiarity to it. Like he should be familiar with this thing. Every boy underwent a certain phase of unhappiness with how he looked, and Johnny was no different; he felt in comparison to the older teens he was skinny, weak and useless. Would he really ever blossom into masculinity like them?<br />
<br />
That next question drove Johnny to decide to try something with the Chronivac;<br />
<br />
He changed the age on his 3D model, made some additional selections to amplify for musculature and height - he wanted to grow, really see what he looked like by the end of puberty; he changed his age to 19 and set things up for himself. He set the duration of the transformation for just 3 minutes, after all, he did not have all day. And he clicked through recommended changes for other individuals within Johnny&#39;s family. He was sure whatever that meant they&#39;d be perfectly fine. And then he hit submit.<br />
<br />
Johnny was immediately hit with a wave of heat that had him wavering on his feet and barely able to stand. His hands were shaking, and Johnny&#39;s eyes widened when he saw that his hands were growing larger and larger, and he turned and gasped, &quot;What...what&#39;s goin&#39; on!?&quot; His body was burning, the fires of puberty blazing through him in just 3 minutes meaning he was gonna be doing a lot of growing in a short amount of time.<br />
<br />
He collapsed to the ground, screaming in pain as his shirt went from loose to horribly tight, his jaw was hurting like nothing else, and it was like he was being reshaped and reconstructed, which in all...he was.<br />
<br />
His shirt gave way to a rippling torso of astonishing musculature, pulsing and thriving as he gripped broader, wider shoulders that looked to belong to a future bodybuilder champ, his muscles continuing their growth, and Johnny cried out again as he felt his abs sculpt themselves, his increasingly masculine face framed by shaggy, peroxide blond hair - dyed to be certain, for a kind of look he enjoyed.<br />
<br />
The growing young man felt his pants finally get too tight for him too, and he brute force ripped them to pieces. The quads and thighs and diamond calves he was sporting would&#39;ve done the same in just mere moments. It felt like everything by now was pulsing, and Johnny was caught mentally between a 12 year old and the 19 year old he was becoming, inflections of both starting to show. &quot;F-Fuck...fuck!&quot; He wondered when he started cursing like that, but as he got up he realized how tall he was. Maybe...maybe cursing was okay as a big guy.<br />
<br />
Well, that was perfect for the next change indeed. Johnny cursed like a sailor as he felt his manhood and testicles catch up to his new 19 year old body. At nineteen the new Johnny was well endowed indeed with large balls and a generous endowment perfect for making an impression in the front whenever his new employment called for it. Johnny gripped the carpet as he felt the last bit of hair he would&#39;ve had below his head get outright lasered off. He was now perfectly smooth and everything was almost scarily sensitive.<br />
<br />
He ambled out of the room, his body still pulsing, a few final transformations working their way in, his shredded clothes reforming into new appearances. He groaned and stumbled into the bathroom. He saw an absolute muscular adonis, standing there in a pink crop top, dyed blond hair and red short shorts, full grown age 19. His body was astonishing - smooth and shaved, every muscle in exactly the right pumped form and look. His abs were so cut and deep he could probably grate cheese on em.<br />
<br />
But his new appearance also made him a little cautious - was he...? His remaining 12 year old self worried about his look as most would - but something told him he shouldn&#39;t be. That his identity hinged on his own choice not his clothes. Still...<br />
<br />
He thought romantic thoughts and found himself thinking about a young woman he was crushing on from the gym. They&#39;d met up a week ago, she needed to work on her squat form and he helped her out...wait, what? He shook his head. Maybe...maybe this new body also came with a new history. He reminisced more, seeing the neighbor girl Amy, herself 19, pining after him every time she saw him leave the house in showy workout clothes.<br />
<br />
Amy loved looking at him, and she&#39;d love even more to get to know Johnny - being one of his most common fans to leave thirsty comments for him.<br />
<br />
Johnny realized being nineteen now meant he had seven years of a new history; an injury in freshman football, getting really into fitness after physical therapy, and developing a name and a brand on Instagram and Facebook - JohnnyFit. He was an up and coming in the scene now, and...and oh, he did modeling?<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s a---?&quot; He half articulated the thought when he heard his mother shout for him downstairs;<br />
<br />
&quot;Johnny! You&#39;re gonna be late at this rate! You&#39;ve gotta be down by the mall in an hour for the JJ Malibu shoot!&quot; <br />
<br />
He realized he was modeling a whole bunch of clothes for people like them - while he wasn&#39;t exactly gay himself, he was eager to support and be an ally...even wearing the clothes and being a damn fine sight for his gay audience on IG. And they were...they were apparently quite thirsty for him, going by the comments he saw as he looked on IG.<br />
<br />
Hurdling out the bathroom, Johnny started toward the door, &quot;Thanks mom, I&#39;ll do my level best!&quot; Now was just a short trip on public transit to the mall. His transit there was not very far away at all.</p>
