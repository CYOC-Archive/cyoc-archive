<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Susan just sat in her car. Today, she had walked in to her boyfriend&#39;s apartment, discovering that he was with another woman. She had just been fired from her job, being wrongly accused for spitting in the customers food. She always knew that it was Brian, not her. She had been fired from her job, serving processed meat to people. &quot;How humiliating&quot; she thought, sitting in her car, listening to the last song on her Beatles album. &quot;Look, at some point, you have to leave the car and just get it over with. It&#39;s best to do it early, then later, or else you&#39;re sleeping in the car&quot; she thought, letting out a deep sigh. Susan opened the door handle, bumping her head on the edge of the car door frame as she got out. &quot;Ow&quot; she whispered. Closing the door, she walked up the many stairs to her apartment and reached for her keys to open her apartment room door. She didn&#39;t need it. The door was slightly ajar as Susan looked back up at the door. Did she forget to close it? She hoped not. Slowly pushing the door open, she saw that a huge chunk of her belongings were completely missing. Her furniture, her television, nearly everything was taken, and the things that weren&#39;t were broken or destroyed completely. As she walked in, she closed the door with her head, sliding down the door with her whole body.<br />
<br />
Susan broke down into tears, covering her face with her arms. This could have been the worst day of her whole entire life...<br />
<br />
It could have...<br />
<br />
The sound of something metal dropping to the floor caught Susan&#39;s attention. She wiped away the tears and crawled to the object that was lying on the floor. It was a lamp. A small golden lamp. &quot;This wasn&#39;t here before... Did they just leave this here? Is this there calling card? Did they just decide that they will take all my stuff and in return, they give me this?&quot; Susan thought &quot;There must be something on here that tells me who they are...&quot;. But the lamp looked like it was untouched. No fingerprints, nothing but a olden lamp covered in dust. She crawled to it and lifted it up to see the bottom of the lamp. No label, no name, nothing but dust. As she lifted it, some of the dust entered her nose and mouth. She began to cough &quot;Oh man, this must have been here for years!&quot; she sputtered &quot;If this was their calling card, they could have cleaned it first!&quot;. The dust was unbearable, she had to clean it off. She wiped off one side of the lamp with her palm, covering her palm in several thick layers of dust. Then the lamp became warm, alive warm, and small little sparks came out of the spout. This creeped Susan out, soon dropping the lamp out of fear of not knowing what was happening. The sparks went from being like tiny sparklers to massive huge fireworks. A thick vapour came out of the spout, becoming thicker and thicker until it was eventually smoke. The smoke flashed and dazzled about, flickering with multi-coloured lights as it spun around an area of the cleared apartment. Susan stayed in shock, not being able to move to the door and leave the room. The smoke started to form into some sort of shape, morphing itself into an body of a young woman. The smoke formed a pair of legs and the head and face of a beautiful goddess. Her legs still had a trail of smoke leading to the lamp, meaning that she must of been connected to the lamp in some way. Susan just stared at this person (?) who had just entered her house via a vintage lamp. She looked back at the lamp, the dust was gone. She looked back at the woman, she was blue and her hair was like a tied back cloud. The woman looked at Susan. Now Susan was really scared, her pupils shrunk in fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings! I am the genie of the lamp, and now, you are my master!&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Susan was even more confused. She stayed still, slightly shaking at this strange woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master? Master, are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;AAAAHHHH!!!&quot; Susan screamed. She jumped up in fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;I apologise, Master, this must be the first time you have seen a genie&quot; she explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;A GENIE?! WHAT- HOW- WH-&quot; Susan was speechless, trying to answer this strange woman. Susan calmed down and breathed deeply. &quot;Okay... okay... who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am the genie of the lamp, Master. I am here to grant you your desired wishes&quot; she responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wishes? Like three wishes? This is mental... I don&#39;t believe you&quot; Susan replied, unsure if this was just an elaborate prank.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can you as many wishes as you desire, Master!&quot; the genie responded.<br />
<br />
Susan thought about what has just happened to her. Could this be the person who stole all her things? She had to test this...<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then, I wish that all my stuff was back, all the stuff that was stolen here!&quot; Susan demanded. <br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish, Master!&quot; the genie said. As soon as she clapped, every single thing that Susan had returned to her apartment, everything back to it&#39;s rightful place. Susan can&#39;t believe it, everything was back. This made Susan suspicious of this &quot;genie&quot;, she could have stolen all of this for this elaborate trick. &quot;There you go, Master, everything of your ownership has been returned to this place!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, what&#39;s your name?&quot; Susan asked, eyeing this &quot;genie&quot; in suspicion.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no name, Master, I am just a genie&quot; she replied.<br />
<br />
Susan was getting annoyed, this had gone far enough &quot;Well, name yourself then!&quot;<br />
<br />
The genie thought for a moment, she had never had a name before. It was nice that her master would be so welcoming to give her the opportunity to name herself. Master must have been ever so kind! The genie had really no knowledge of people&#39;s names, she began to look around for a suitable one and found something that she knew would be perfect. A book from Arnold Pilkington. So she decided that would be her name. &quot;Arnold, master!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arnold?&quot; Susan was confused, was this person insane?<br />
<br />
Arnold was now nervous that Master didn&#39;t like her new name &quot;Y-yes, Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
Susan was fed up &quot;Look, just tell me who you are and what you are doing in my house!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Master, I am Arnold, the genie of the lamp&quot; she said &quot;You have awakened me and as a honourable gift, I will grant you with as many wishes as you desire!&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah? So if you are a genie, Arnold, I wish...&quot;</p>
