<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Amy and Jennifer sat down at the table, Jennifer took stock of the two girls they were joining. The first was a thin, tan girl with messy black hair with streaks of blue throughout. She wore a fun but simple outfit, a white and blue striped shirt, a pair of women’s tan cargo joggers, and some white sneakers. Jennifer saw she was a fairly attractive girl though she might attract a few more boys if she could swap out the rather nerdy, red glasses she wore and if she had even the slightest hint of a bust. In truth if the girl had wanted to, she probably could have passed for a somewhat effeminate boy and no one would bat an eye.<br />
<br />
The other girl was far better equipped than her partner, Amy, and Jennifer combined. Rocking a generous bust that would leave some hookers depressed, the other girl was rather husky. Not fat, but her shape was more muscular than attractive. She looked like she could give any member of the wrestling team a hard time. She wore a black jacket, black leggings, and a few piercings, though few showed through her neck-length brown hair which was currently transitioning from a deep crimson she had dyed it. Her shirt was her most colorful item, a dark gray shirt with a yellow silhouette of some muscled hero from some animated show that Jennifer was steadily becoming more aware of with the words, “I Hit Back” emblazoned on the front.<br />
<br />
As the two sat down, the girl in all black was finishing some statement, “Alright, you asked for it, if I’m honest Samantha... I just wish you had bigger tits.”<br />
<br />
“Just so you could motorboat them right?”<br />
<br />
“You know me too well beautiful. Oh and here come the two love birds.”<br />
<br />
“Hello Melinda,” answered Jennifer without thinking.<br />
<br />
The girl in black soured slightly. “Jennifer, darling, how long is it gonna take for youz to call me by my actual name.”<br />
<br />
“How long is it going to take for you to stop calling Amy and I love birds, Mal?” fired back Jennifer.<br />
<br />
Mal smirked, “Amy, you picked a good one. Not going to let you take any more crap from the losers &#39;round here.”<br />
<br />
“Thank You, after school tutoring program ,” remarked Amy as Jennifer and she sat down and began to eat.<br />
<br />
“Of course you meet your girlfriend through some quiet, safe, almost Shakespearean B S. How do I get my girl? I literally have to pull some nimrod off her cause he could not read the fucking room and I had to shout at him, “she’s taken!” Before grabbing miss &quot;um-um-um&quot; over here by the wrist and marching off.&quot;<br />
<br />
“And you wonder why your nickname in some circles is the “The She-Orc,”&quot; giggled out Samantha before she kissed Mal on the cheek.<br />
<br />
“You’re all damn lucky you are cute, because I wouldn’t be taking this talk from just anyone,” answered Mal.<br />
<br />
Amy then spoke, “we thank you for sparing us oh Terror of the High School, scourge of the underbleachers, and rescuer of maidens.&quot; The girls laughed heartily at the joke. Once everyone was calmed down, Amy continued, &quot;So what were you guys chatting about?”<br />
<br />
Samantha smiled and spoke, “it’s a great relationship game, “Grateful, Happy, Wish.”<br />
<br />
“Odd name,” answered Jennifer.<br />
<br />
Samantha continued, “True it does not exactly roll off the tongue, but it is designed to help couples strengthen their bond by allowing people to list one thing they are grateful for with their partner,-“<br />
<br />
“How she helped me deal with and accept my many issues,” interrupted Mal.<br />
<br />
“One thing you are happy with but might cause issues-“<br />
<br />
“I’m happy she relies on me for her confidence, but sometimes she has to find her own strength.”<br />
<br />
“And one wish, any one thing you would change about your significant other.”<br />
<br />
“I love her, but would love her more if she even had a slightly larger cup size... or at least be more comfortable in role playing the young, effeminate, captured prince whenever we decide to get nasty,” finished Mal. Samantha blushed and glowered at her lover for a few moments.<br />
<br />
“Only if you get an A+ on your next report card.”<br />
<br />
“Come on, I’m not a miracle worker.”<br />
<br />
Samantha bit her lip for a bit before relenting with a sigh. “Fine, B+, but you have to get at least two of them,” Samantha then grabbed Mal’s shirt and pulled her in close, “or you’ll be sorry.”<br />
<br />
For the first time, Mal was the one left blushing. Meanwhile Amy and Jennifer ate between bouts of giggles.<br />
<br />
Desperate to take the attention off herself, Mal turned to Amy. “So Amy, how about you and Jennifer?”<br />
<br />
“How about what?” Asked Amy, hoping this was not going where it inevitably was.<br />
<br />
“How about you and Jennifer play the game? I mean it’s only fair after you got a wide window into our lives.”<br />
<br />
“Only because you left it wide open,” countered Jennifer, though even she was curious about what Amy would say.<br />
<br />
“Oh come on,” answered Mal with all the convincing tones of a drunk college student trying to get someone to do a dare.<br />
<br />
Amy thought for some time before she blushed slightly saying, “well, fair is fair. Jennifer, do you mind?”<br />
<br />
“Not at all,” answered Jennifer as she put down her fork and devoted her attention to Amy.<br />
<br />
“Alright here it goes. First Jennifer, I am grateful to have found someone like you, someone who gives me the courage to show off my passions even if you do not entirely get them.”<br />
<br />
Jennifer sat silently, excited to hear what her girlfriend would say.<br />
<br />
“I am happy with where we are in terms of intimacy, but I’ll admit I seem to always be the one who initiates. Perhaps that could change in the future as we continue to grow as a couple? But I am a patient partner.”<br />
<br />
“One wish... to be honest I cannot think of anything I would change about you physically... I guess it would be nice if you were more into some of the things I’m into... like....&quot;<br />
<br />
“Like what Amy?” Asked Jennifer.<br />
<br />
“Like you know those types of things... ya know?”<br />
<br />
“Amy, go ahead and tell me I won’t judge you,” answered Jennifer.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know...&quot; Amy was blushing, her hands fumbling against each other as she spoke.<br />
<br />
Eventually it all came out in a rush, &quot;Feet! Bare feet, feet in colorful socks, plain socks, tall socks, short socks, tights, stockings, toe socks. I love it all.” She turned away, her face now beet red.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Jennifer felt a strange tingling sensation that ran from the tips of her toes to just below her knees. The sensation was warm and pleasant. So pleasant that Jennifer eyes soon closed in mild ecstasy. Yet there was also a prickliness to the feeling, similar to the feeling one gets when their leg falls asleep and the person tries to walk on the still sleepy foot. So focused on the feeling in her feet, Jennifer did not detect the slight tingle in her head.<br />
<br />
Just like that, the sensation was gone, replaced with two things. The first was two quick plops as two somethings fell off Jennifer’s feet. The second was the faintest of breezes that brushed across the bottom of Jennifer’s feet. Looking down, Jennifer noticed that her shoes had transformed. Where once had been a comfortable pair of converse sneakers now there sat a pair of black Mary Jane flats, leather with a small silver buckle. Normally, Jennifer would take more notice of her cute shoes, but she found herself more focused on her feet. The black color had changed to a crisp white, the fabric smooth and silky. They had risen up to above her ankles, and lacy ruffles hung down from the tops.  Jennifer wiggled her toes in glee, their outlines visible through the now-tighter socks, soft fabric rub against her feet which she noted had become far more sensitive. Rubbing her socked feet together, Jennifer quickly understood why Amy might have a foot fetish. She also noted that her jeans had grown shorter and were now essentially capri-length, allowing her to show offer her girly socks to all those who were interested.<br />
<br />
Upon thinking of Amy, Jennifer became desperately curious about what kind of socks Amy could be wearing today. From her current angle, Jennifer could not really tell, but she quickly began to formulate a plan. That was until Samantha snapped her out of her lust infused daze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer,&quot; spoke the tan girl, &quot;Are you alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, just got to thinking about something,&quot; answered Jennifer as she plopped her socked feet in Amy&#39;s lap, an act that quick got the other nerdy girl blushing. Clearly she was resisting indulging in her desires to avoid public exposure. That&#39;s alright, Jennifer always liked to tease her lover.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to hear you&#39;re still with us,&quot; joked Mal, ignoring the white toes that now peaked up over the edge of the table. &quot;So what&#39;s the deal, are you two... into feet or something? Not that I can judge or anything nor would I want to... too much work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Amy, why don&#39;t you go first,&quot; answered Jennifer as she slipped her feet from her lover&#39;s lap and scooted herself closer to her lover, giving her a tight, friendly embrace. This allowed Jennifer to slip her feet down to Amy&#39;s converse sneakers. While there, Jennifer quickly set to untying the girl&#39;s shoes, her dexterous toes clearly having experience with such delicate matters.<br />
<br />
Amy began with, &quot;Well, I do not know where it started for certain, but I&#39;ve always just really loved them, so cute and dainty.&quot; Her eyes flicked down towards Jen&#39;s busy toes. &quot;I&#39;m not a very confident person either, so I&#39;m always looking at other people&#39;s feet.&quot; She smirked, &quot;and mine have always been extra sensitive.&quot; Amy shivered slightly as Jen&#39;s sock feet roved over the tops of her shoes. &quot;As far as socks and tights, I think that just goes with the territory, so many different styles and colors to show them off in.&quot; <br />
<br />
In the mean time, Jennifer&#39;s socked toes had managed to loosen the laces on Amy&#39;s shoes, leaving them primed for being yanked off. However, before Jennifer could do exactly that, it was her turn to speak. Thinking about it, Jennifer was surprised to find that her memories of her previous life had grown a little vaguer, but more importantly, that she did not seem to mind. Additionally, more memories of her current life appeared in her head. &quot;Well, to be honest I don&#39;t really know why. I just know that when I had my first loving experience, the person and I had just slid on wooden floors and had been having a laughing, fun-filled time. And even though we ended up careening into each other and giving ourselves a few bruises, we didn&#39;t really care cause we were with each other and were having fun. At least that&#39;s my best guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah how sweet,&quot; answered Sam. &quot;And now you have each other. And who knows, maybe you share other interests and you just have not discovered them yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; responded Amy, as she took lead now and slipped Jennifer&#39;s legs over so her feet could be on top, &quot;But I&#39;m all for finding out.&quot; Jennifer then felt Amy&#39;s socked foot drag along her foot. Instantly Jennifer felt a wetness grow in her groin and a blush rush to her face. She was about to return the foreplay when the bell rang sending the cafeteria back to class.</p>
