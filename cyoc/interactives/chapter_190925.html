<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty smiled deviously as he urged the police woman to turn into a crocodile woman for June. He had been dying to try something extreme, so why not on this new plaything?<br />
<br />
The poor woman staggered suddenly just before turning back to her car. She let out a gasp, and then clenched her hands and her eyes tight. “W-What...”<br />
<br />
Energy coursed through her. Hot, primal, sexually charged transformation energy. She tensed up from head to toe and let out a muffled moan as she grabbed her mouth. Her red hair seemed to loosen under her cap. A few strands fell right out.<br />
<br />
“T-Ty...” June watched in shock. “W-What did you do to her?”<br />
<br />
“Just watch.” Ty urged, sitting back and swelling hard as he anticipated the change.<br />
<br />
The cop’s skin began to roughen. Strange rectangular dents began to appear all over. She pulled her hand off her face and gasped, stroking her flesh and feeling the little grooves and lines appear. Her pupils flicked into sharp reptilian slashes.<br />
<br />
She looked down at her hands in alarm as her fingernails began to inexplicably grow longer and thicker. Her hair continued to tumble off her hair. She was going completely bald.<br />
<br />
“Ty...” June gaped, realizing. “You didn’t!”<br />
<br />
“I did.” He grinned.<br />
<br />
Her skin was now hairless, tough, leathery, and covered in rectangular scutes. Her scelera was yellowing and her teeth began to grow to points.<br />
<br />
She was trembling wildly, shaking, and as she held out her thickening hands she jolted. Her size began to build. Her skin began to darken to green, with rough yellow washing under her chin and down her stomach.<br />
<br />
“Ahhh!” The hapless cop cried, shaking violently and tearing up as her face began to push. A loud rip from her pants suddenly made her turn to look down, even as her nose flattened to slits and her ears dwindled away to holes on the side of her now reptilian looking head. Her mouth was protruding. Her lips roughened to scales. She gasped, opening her mouth wide and revealing sharp tipped and inhumanly long teeth, as a tail tip snaked its way out of her pants, the razor ridges on both sides of the little thing cutting through the back of her pants as it extended out and began to grow longer and thicker.<br />
<br />
The cop turned, crying, towards the naked couple in the car and let out a pitiful moan. “H-Helg meee!” She cried. Her face pushed wildly, crackling, and her body began to fill out. Her muscle grew thick. Toe claws ripped through the front of her boots attached to huge reptilian toes. Her color continued to change. Her size continued to increase. She crackled and popped and grew.<br />
<br />
The two humans watched in fascination and horror as the poor woman grew huge and beastly. Her mouth extended well past a foot in length, forming into menacing jaws filled with pointed conical teeth. Her tongue lengthened to fill it. She was bulking up fast, hugging herself in huge claw tipped hands. Her shirt burst open from the strain as her torso gained hard muscle, and the shoulders of her uniform shirt burst from the strain of trying to hold in those huge lizardy biceps. Her tail dangled down to her ankles and kept growing while her height began to increase dramatically.<br />
<br />
With a final push, and a deep gutteral growl, a seven and a half foot tall crocodile lady stood in her tattered police uniform and chuffed heavily, her smallish breasts heaving under the gray shirt that had been concealed by her uniform top.<br />
<br />
“Ty...” June gasped. “What the fuck did you do?”<br />
<br />
The crocodile woman opened her eyes, flicked her inner eyelid, and looked down at herself weakly.<br />
<br />
“Hmmmph.” She chuffed, shaking her head. “W-What the fuck?” Her voice was now deep. Her body was huge and powerful. She let out a shocked giggle and looked back to the naked couple in the car.<br />
<br />
“Hrrfff...” She sniffled. “C-Can you guys... help me?”<br />
<br />
“Uh, we don’t have any clothes.” June blinked, wondering WHY the hell she was so aroused by the sight of the giant reptilian beast woman standing there in her shredded clothes.<br />
<br />
“Shit...” The crocodile looked around in embarrassment, an all too funny gesture as the hulking scaly looked around with sheepish body language. “I-I don’t know what to do...”<br />
<br />
“It’s okay,” Ty offered. “Nobody is going to notice you’re changed. This is just you now.”<br />
<br />
He urged it to be true. Nobody would give the massive croc woman a thought. She was just a police woman. She had always been a big crocodile. He made her accept it. He urged her uniform to adapt to her new size and fix itself.<br />
<br />
But she was still aware. With wide eyes, looking down past her snout, she watched her clothes grow to her new stature, adjust to her thickened physique and powerful body, and began to rethread themselves and rejoin as it being fixed by an invisible hand.<br />
<br />
The croc woman stood deathly still in shock, wide yellow eyes staring, as even her equipment belt scaled up to meet her new size. She turned, and looked at the elastic opening at the back of her pants that allowed her tail to fit through just fine.<br />
<br />
She looked back to the couple, seeing their shock, and her long jaws opened in disbelief.<br />
<br />
“Do you seriously not have any clothes?” She rumbled. “Are you driving around naked and fucking? Like... what is this?”<br />
<br />
“Aren’t you more concerned about your new body?” Ty grinned.<br />
<br />
“Of course I am!” The cop threw her scaly hands out into a shrug. “I’m... I’m a fucking alligator!”<br />
<br />
“Crocodile,” June corrected.<br />
<br />
“Well, I’m a fucking crocodile!” She threw her hands up and slapped them onto her meaty thighs. “And...” She looked down in disbelief and gulped. “And... and... how am I going to even explain any of this?”<br />
<br />
Ty grinned. “Hey, look, nobody is going to even care. As far as the world is concerned, you’ve always been a big crocodile lady.”<br />
<br />
“C-Can you like, cover yourselves while we figure this out?” The crocodile growled. “It’s really distracting me.”<br />
<br />
“Big reppy is horny?” June giggled, leaning out of the car a little and seeing people walking by totally disinterested.<br />
<br />
“Yes!” The croc cop snapped her jaws. “Just... please... I need to get my shit together here.”<br />
<br />
“Hey, Charlie-6,” her radio suddenly crackled. “You wrap up that indecency thing? I’ve got another call waiting.”<br />
<br />
The croc looked at the naked people, blinked, and realization sank in. “Dispatch, this is Charlie-6, I’m still investigating the complaint, over.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, Charlie-6, I’ll send another car.”<br />
<br />
The crocodile blinked several times, her freaky third eyelid closing with each blink. She stared at the humans and watched people walk by her huge uniformed reptilian self, eye naturally tracing the movement. She seemed to turn pale, her skin washing from dark green to a forest color. She looked down at herself nervously.<br />
<br />
“Okay.” The cop gulped. “I’ll... I’ll let you go. But you have to tell me what the fuck is going on and why I’m a fucking crocodile now.”</p>
