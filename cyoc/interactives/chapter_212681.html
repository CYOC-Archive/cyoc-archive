<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah was rather surprised just how well she&#39;d managed to sleep on a floor of hard packed dirt. It had gotten a little chilly in the night, but she wasn&#39;t sore at all. She was, however, hungry. Carefully stepping forward to the entrance of the warren she took a sniff and a listen for any signs of danger, and headed out in search of something to eat. Cartoons had taught her that rabbits ate carrots, but she was a little skeptical about how much of a staple they really were, and if she was honest with herself, she wasn&#39;t sure she&#39;d actually be able to identify one without being able to see the big orange root. She figured though that any sort of fruit or vegetable was fine, and figured it was best to just try to find something really obvious.<br />
<br />
It did seem like a good percentage of the plants here were seeded for the benefit of the people in the park. She wasn&#39;t an expert by any means, but she was pretty sure natural forests didn&#39;t have this much variety to the trees, and an awful lot of them were on the smaller side. Searching for a while, she found what she was pretty sure was a head of lettuce, or maybe cabbage. It tasted a lot more flavorful than either but she didn&#39;t exactly have her usual taste buds. It did seem to make sense to mix it up a little and find something with some more color. A few bushes nearby seemed to have some sort of tiny bright red berries. She didn&#39;t recognize exactly what they were, and did wonder for a moment if they might be poisonous, but ultimately decided to risk eating a handful. After all, the warren was pretty clearly built for rabbits like her, so it stood to reason anything growing nearby was planted there on purpose, right?<br />
<br />
She still wanted something with a bit more substance though, especially after exerting herself so much the previous day, and kept foraging. There were a few distant howls that made her freeze up for a moment, but for the most part she kept from panicking quite so badly as she had the previous day. Really obvious food sources kept eluding her, but after an hour or so she caught a scent she somehow recognized as belonging to other rabbits. Going to investigate, it seemed while she was the only one to find her way to the warren, the rest of the rabbit population had apparently run into each other. There were just... eight rabbit people, all sort of piled up against each other in a clearing, just waking up as she arrived. And from the other smells in the air, it was pretty clear they&#39;d done more than just sleep the night before. It alarmed her that they&#39;d be quite so... intimate having just met, but still, she had a duty of sorts to get them somewhere safe. After a very groggy introduction, she just asked the lot of them, &quot;I don&#39;t suppose you wouldn&#39;t all like to come inside for a bit?&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Of course, Sarah wasn&#39;t the only rabbit not joining in on the pile that night. Kay had spent the night with Jay, just sitting beneath a pair of trees, staring across at each other, and hoping for some sort of spark. It was just damn weird to them that they were both women now, and if it had just been that, they could easily have worked something out, but they weren&#39;t even the same species anymore. Try as she might, Jay couldn&#39;t see anything of the man she&#39;d been dating for years in this timid little rabbit, and Kay felt similar staring at this intimidatingly large bear woman. They&#39;d gone to sleep commenting on how there was more to life than sex, and they could live with a bit of a break, but Kay was a little less sure of that as she woke up from a surprisingly vivid dream about another rabbit woman with a fast set of fingers just going to town, and couldn&#39;t help but sneak away before Jay woke up to give the new equipment a bit of a test drive.<br />

Meanwhile, in one of the more wide open areas of the park, a decidedly top-heavy cow was having a bit of an identity crisis. Just yesterday, she&#39;d been Steven. A man. A human man, who dead lifted full beer kegs and dragged another girl home to his dorm every night. Yesterday though, she&#39;d stepped into that booth and just... grew this absolutely massive pair of titties. They had to be bigger than her head! The booth had done some other things too. She had a tail slapping around, and her fingernails were all thick and sort of fused together... which had made it that much weirder hefting these massive milk jugs and flicking at those nips. And she hadn&#39;t really checked but based on these other two, she probably had a little set of horns, goofy ears, kind of a messed up face. These titties though! She figured she should probably stand up, but once she got up on her knees they were just hanging down, swinging like pendulums, brushing up against the grass. It was real distracting... and the grass looked pretty damn good too.<br />
<br />
She lost her train of thought as she just crouched there in the grass, swaying about and grazing. Once her stomach was full though, well, her first stomach at least, she thought a bit more about how she&#39;d ended up here. So she&#39;d staggered out of the booth. Honestly it was hard not to just full on tip over with these things, and well, she was kind of in shock about the whole thing. It was a hell of a change, and they hadn&#39;t said anything about this sort of thing happening. But at the same time, hey, absolute mondo titties right here and she could do whatever she wanted with&#39;em. That&#39;d been hard to pass up. Plus she&#39;d kinda just spaced out. At some point these two chicks came bouncing on out with tits just as big. She remembered that was a little weird because she should have thought that was crazy hot, but whatever, she had her own to play with. There she went, getting distracted again, rocking back and forth to let&#39;em just swing free.<br />
<br />
What was she doing again? Right, thinking about the past day. She&#39;d probably have just stood there playing with these things but... damn this super, super jacked dude came over and started talking about what he wanted to do to these fun bags, and yeah, she kinda figured the same. Guy had this real deep freaking voice though. Just all booming and slick. Should have done voice work or something. So she&#39;d looked over and just... damn. She definitely wasn&#39;t gay or anything and normally she&#39;d never even think about lookin&#39; at another dude&#39;s tool, but like, they were all naked, and it was just ridiculous. Freaking pole ready for someone to run a flag up. Her mind was drifting again now. It was hard to shake the image of that thing... and that thing had really been hard.<br />
<br />
But yeah, she&#39;d been kinda curious, and he was hitting on these two super stacked girls, so she figured she&#39;d follow along. It was like getting to watch a live theater thing if they were doing some kinda crazy porn play. And that was just crazy hot... got her really worked up and...<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when the memory really hit her. She&#39;d done a lot more than just watch. It&#39;d felt amazing too. Her knees were getting all quivery just remembering what it felt like when that massive rod slammed into her. Damn it she was horny now... she straightened her legs out and lifted her tail a bit, to get that new... whole situation some fresh air and maybe cool it down. Wait damn, did this make her gay or something? Because that&#39;d been a straight up schlong just right up in there like... she let out a very pleasantly surprised long moo as she was taken from behind. Just like that, yeah.<br />
<br />
Once again her train of thought derailed for some time as she was lost in pleasure. Damn. She really kinda was a chick now huh. Should probably go by like Stephanie if anyone asked. Come to think of it though nobody had. This minotaur stud here rocking her world wasn&#39;t really much of a talker and these other two chicks were like total airheads mostly, just munching grass and waiting for their turns to get railed. Eventually though they&#39;d all need to stop and like, find some food though. Well... no, there was grass like everywhere. Some water though maybe. After she was done re-chewing this.</p>
