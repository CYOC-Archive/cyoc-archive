<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kendall really was having a hard time keeping track of things. Calculus wasn&#39;t sticking in his head as he looked up at the board, the numbers and formulas just weren&#39;t making sense. Then came the quiz and he stared at the paper lamely. He made an effort to get everything together, doing what he could. Knowledge seemed to be coming in fits and starts. One problem he&#39;d glide through and the next might as well be in Greek. Math Greek.<br />
<br />
His teacher gave him a strange look when he handed it in, her eyes skimming his answers then looking at him with a touch of concern. &quot;Are you feeling alright today, Kendall? This isn&#39;t up to your usual standard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No worries,&quot; He said, trying to fit a smile on his face. &quot;Nothing..&quot; What was the word he used with Mr. Clark? It was there, right on the tip of his tongue. &quot;Nothing.. wrong today. No.&quot; <br />
<br />
She looked him up and down over the rim of her glasses and waved him back to his seat. He sat for the rest of the period in quiet as he thought. Why did everyone think something was wrong with him? He felt better and more full of energy than he had ever before in his entire life. He bounced his leg in irritation, slumping in his seat as he began to watch the clock. Third period was next. Allison and he could meet up for their study session. Maybe unclogging the pipes would get the brain working again.<br />
<br />
He was so caught up in thinking about showing off his new muscles to Allison, using them to lift her up against the wall as he screwed her that he barely noticed class had been dismissed. He was the last one to filter out, which he was grateful for, considering his thoughts had put his cock into a state of semi-hardness that was hard to hide. He took a little used back stairwell down trying to avoid people until his cock softened.<br />
<br />
He took the first flight a stair at a time, but the second flight he took two, hopping down the last three steps to the floor like he was showing off. Not that there was anyone around to show off for. Still he jokingly took a bow but when he did he heard a loud riiiiiip come from below.<br />
<br />
He looked down in a panic and saw nothing out of place, other than his too tight t-shirt and a chubbed up dick that refused to soften. Then he felt the draft and reached behind himself. His sweats had torn open right up his ass, even his underwear seemed to have split, leaving his ass crack on display. &quot;That is not ideal..&quot; He muttered to himself, some of his old thinking power coming back to him in his panic.<br />
<br />
He was in one of the back hallways of the school. Not much back here other than supply closets and a few unlucky teacher offices. He looked around and quickly ducked into one. He needed to fix this problem, and quick. The room he ducked into was half-office half-supply closet. There were two desks and the walls were lined with shelves holding various cleaning supplies and tools. It was not an office many students ever saw, or even knew existed. It belonged to the school&#39;s janitor and groundskeeper. A place where they could write up things, check emails for important duties, and keep their logs in order.<br />
<br />
Tape! There must be some heavy duty tape down here somewhere. It would look stupid but he could get back to his car and make a quick trip home. He was free next period, he&#39;d just need to shoot Allison a text he&#39;d miss their study.. then his eyes spotted it. Something better than tape.<br />
<br />
Kendall grabbed the green coveralls off the hook where they hung on the wall. They seemed clean other than a few grass stains. They even smelled like freshly mowed grass. He quickly shucked his shoes and his ripped pants and stepped into the coveralls, hiking them up to his waist. They felt a bit loose, but fit better than he expected they would. He pulled it up over his shoulders, shoving his arms through the thankfully short sleeves, which were already rolled up almost to the shoulder. Not that Kendall cared, not really, but it was nice to show off his arms a bit now. He grabbed the zipper and tugged it partway up to just below his chest, letting them flare open and show off his pecs pressed against his overly tight t-shirt. A tank top would be better he idly thought, show off some of those rounded pectorals.<br />
<br />
He took a moment to adjust himself downstairs and peeked out into the hallway. Now, to make it back to his car.<br />
<br />
----------------------<br />
<br />
Lisa was not having a good day. She tried to sit through biology, but was growing increasingly uncomfortable. It didn&#39;t help that her usual carefully planned outfit was now gym clothes matched with a skirt. She knew those girls two rows back were snickering about her outfit. She self-consciously shrank in on herself, which seemed harder than normal. Were the desks in this room smaller?<br />
<br />
With a sigh she crossed her legs and went wide-eyed as she felt the scratch of stubble on her legs. She had just shaved last night. She idly ran a hand over her shin and sure enough there was a bit of prickly stubble on her legs. She must have missed a spot. Luckily her red hair was light enough it didn&#39;t stand out too much and it probably wouldn&#39;t be noticeable except to touch, but it still bothered her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lisa!&quot; Lisa jumped a little in her seat as Mr. Suarez said her name with a bit of a shout. &quot;Are you paying attention? What does ADP stand for?&quot;<br />
<br />
She fished through her memory. She had read this chapter yesterday. &quot;Adenosine diphosphate?&quot; She said, somewhat unsure, her voice sounded hoarse and scratchy. But Mr. Suarez nodded his head and went on. She leaned over and pulled a lozenge out of her backpack, popping it in her mouth.<br />
<br />
Lisa was a good student and her habit of reading ahead paid off. She was no Kendall or Allison, but she was certainly in their circle. She plucked at the front of her borrowed shirt. She felt like she was burning up. She couldn&#39;t ask to be excused to the nurse twice in one day, so she suffered through it until the bell rang.<br />
<br />
She gathered her things together and slipped out into the hallway. Maybe she could skip tomorrow, there were no tests or major assignments. One sick day wouldn&#39;t put her too far behind. Instead of heading to class she did go to the nurse&#39;s office this time. The nurse, Anna Landry, was a nice woman, it was also the worst kept secret in the school that she had an on again off again relationship with Mr. Suarez, but no one held that against her. He wasn&#39;t the most attractive member of faculty but he wasn&#39;t bad looking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lisa?&quot; Nurse Landry said as she stepped into the office. She also made an effort to know as many of the students by name as she could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, I&#39;m feeling a little off, I was just hoping I could lay down for a bit.&quot; The nurse motioned for Lisa to go and sit on one of the beds in the office that was there just for that purpose.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sound a little hoarse, sore throat?&quot; Lisa shook her head, but Nurse Landry still did a quick check, feeling at her neck and asking her to open her mouth. She even took her temperature. &quot;A little elevated but not a fever. I&#39;ll send a note to your next period, tell them I&#39;m keeping you here for a bit. Just lay down.&quot; She gave Lisa a kind pat on the thigh and moved back to her desk.<br />
<br />
Lisa sat for a moment before laying down. This bed had a window view at least. She wrinkled her brow though as she saw a figure in green coveralls slinking through the parking lot. Was that Kendall? Her eyes widened even further as she saw Coach Mason coming up from the field. The two were going to bump into each other, but there was nothing she could do from up here but watch.</p>
