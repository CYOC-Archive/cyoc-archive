<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hire a couple of hookers, blow their brains out with a bit of handywork, pay for their service, send them on their way, and isolate oneself before the inevitable hits them. That was Gus&#39; plan for tonight. Plenty of reports had already been made about the red-hot skies that had formed off the coast of Japan, bringing a strange sort of destruction in its wake, by fusing all living and non-living creatures with each other into Lovecraftian horrors, leaving irrepairable damage worldwide, as it rushed over the planet.<br />
<br />
The experts claimed it would not take long before the Great Fusion Wave would wash over Gus&#39; home city as well, so he decided it would be for the best to take the most pleasure out of the remaining time his normal self still had left on this planet. By isolating from other people as far as possible, in his own villa far away from the city&#39;s busy center, he&#39;d bear the lowest risk of merging with some other unfortunate soul. Even if it didn&#39;t decrease his chances from getting merged with an inanimate object, or, god forbid, some random animal or insect of the sort, perhaps that would still be a better option than to spend the rest of his life, unwillingly, with some weirdo the fusion wave randomly picked from the street.<br />
<br />
An hour left, that was what the experts estimated, and Gus would make great use of that time. Even if the sex workers arrived late at his doorstep, he figured he wouldn&#39;t need all that long to finish anyway. He&#39;d just make the best out of it.<br />
<br />
That was until, in the middle of the action, he watched the bedroom get illuminated by an odd red hue. The light came through the curtains that hung closed over his window. Momentarily distracted, the two girls still moaning in bed with neither of them even out of their slutty skirts, he opened the curtains, and saw with his own eyes as a wave of red washed over the city&#39;s skyline in the distance.<br />
<br />
Behind him, he heard the two girls scream as they stared at the sky in horror. For a moment, Gus could only feel frustrated by their course of actions. They weren&#39;t thinking about their safety at all! They were screaming, but didn&#39;t take action, what were the brains of these sex workers even good for?<br />
<br />
Gus made an attempt to outrun the wave, but found that he was already too late. Before he even managed to reach for the doorknob of his bedroom door, he heard the women&#39;s screams distort into nothingness, and he fell unconscious before he even hit the ground, as the alien power washed over him.<br />
<br />
___<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t immediately become aware of the changes to his body. What he figured out first, once he woke up, was that some time must have passed, since the screaming couldn&#39;t have stopped as abruptly as it did just then. He was lying on his stomach, on the carpeted floor that was still part of his bedroom, the door before him still shut where he&#39;d tried to open it before.<br />
<br />
How much time had he actually spent in bed with these hookers? Had Gus lost his track of time, or were the experts simply wrong in their estimates?<br />
<br />
When he tried to turn around and lie down onto his back, he discovered the first of his changes. <br />
<br />
Gus looked down to discover that his legs had duplicated in their amount, from two to four, thanks to the Fusion Wave. Not only that, but these legs weren&#39;t his. None of them.<br />
<br />
The first pair was smooth and oily with sweat, slightly tanned, with dainty feet further down. The second pair, to the left of the first pair, was darker in color, and small stubble all over the skin showed these legs had been shaved before, although small hairs were slowly growing back again. The skimpy skirts only barely covered his private parts.<br />
<br />
Neither pair of legs were originally part of his own body, his own skin-tone being much paler than those of his new sets of legs, especially now that he was in a state of panic and confusion.<br />
<br />
The extra appendages attached to his lower body all felt strange to him, and they looked different as well. The feet were daintier, the toes on all feet painted with red nail polish, the lefties&#39; a slightly darker hue than the righties&#39;. The calves were shorter, the skin much smoother, their thighs much thicker, and his hips considerably wider.<br />
<br />
Gus reached down with both hands on a whim, and to his dismay, as he reached below the hems of the skirts he had never worn before, he was met with the smooth-shaven labia of two female sex-workers, one on each side.<br />
<br />
No trace of the hookers, and no trace of his original pair of legs. Gus stood up, both pairs of feet slightly apart, one pair before the other, as his reality came crashing down around him.<br />
<br />
The Great Fusion Wave had really done a number on him.</p>
