<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aiden was so bored. He sat at the bar drinking his Appletini and scowling. The music pounded around him, giving him a headache. He caught a glimpse of his reflection in a mirrored pillar and cringed. If he’d known he was going out tonight, he would have put something in his hair, but that weird text from Adam had told him to come to Club Aurora. ASAP. Only… Where was he? He wasn’t anywhere in the club, as far as Aiden could tell.<br />
<br />
He futzed with his frizzy brown hair in the mirror, arranging it so it fell down around his ears, resting on his shoulders in a mildly pleasing way. He frowned at his button nose and smattering of freckles, something he always tried to distract from by applying the tiniest bit of mascara to his lashes, drawing attention to his green eyes. He was skinny and hairless, which was pretty much gay law for people shorter than 5’7”, but he thought he looked alright. Well, maybe not tonight, but most of the time. He was in such a rush to leave, he threw on a sweatshirt and some Dockers shorts. At least this was a straight club, so he wasn’t in any danger of running into anybody he knew. Speaking of, Adam was running awfully late. Why did he pick this place anyway?<br />
<br />
He looked around, silently judging all the hoe’d out chicks and crossfaded dudes. Why was it that people couldn’t just enjoy dancing without getting blitzed? In fact, this one bro with a man bun was at the bar, negotiating a pile of at least eight beer bottles tinkling in the lights.<br />
<br />
“Who, man. Be careful, or the bar will tip over,” joked Aiden.<br />
<br />
The bro turned and glared. “At least I’m drinking beer and not some fruity drink, you fruit. Why don’t you go suck a dick and leave me alone?”<br />
<br />
Aiden turned away, flushing red with anger. Who did that guy think he was, insulting his drink like that? This was 2016, people shouldn’t… His thoughts trailed off as the appletini kicked in. The bartended must have mixed him a strong one, because he felt tipsy as all hell. He reached for his glass to sniff it, but it was no longer there. The bartender must have bussed it.<br />
<br />
A beer was in its place, the German label glistening with condensation. Ew. Aiden hated beer. The smell made him want to vomit. Although honestly, this one didn’t stink quite so bad… In fact, it smelled kind of enticing. He slid it over and took a deep sniff, getting lost in the scent of hops. He took a tentative sip and his taste buds exploded with flavor. This was great! His sip became a gulp, which became a chug. The bottle was already empty, but he hadn’t had enough, so he ordered another. As he drank, he thought.<br />
<br />
Fuck that guy for making fun of my drink. Just because I want some real European beer rather than that American piss. In his experience, most Americans were cocksuckers just begging to be punched. Well, American men. The women were cocksuckers in an entirely different way…<br />
<br />
He grabbed his beer and walked out onto the dance floor, scoping out the bouncing racks of scantily clad chicks. His boner strained against his cotton underwear. As he walked, his legs grew lankier and longer, leaving him standing at a solid six feet tall. His skinny limbs bulked up with lean muscle, ripping his shorts down the middle. He tore them off, revealing light blue short shorts underneath that hugged his bubble butt, barely covering the tip of his engorged dick.<br />
<br />
The hood receded into his sweatshirt as the neckline plunged down his thin torso, revealing blossoming pecs. The fabric thinned, turning into a neon yellow tank top. A light dusting of blonde hair sprouted between his barely covered nipples, and downy hair spread on his legs.<br />
<br />
He took another sip as a tattoo of a German flag inked itself in on his bicep. His shoulders tickled as his long brown hair receded, sweeping into a thick coif that slowly faded to blonde. His eyelids grew heavy as his lashes thickened, fluttering drunkenly. His freckles faded away into milky white skin as his nose straightened out.<br />
<br />
He took another sip of his beer, adjusted his package, and walked over to the nearest girl, smirking.<br />
<br />
“Ich habe- I mean, I have a question. You ever danced with a German before?”</p>
