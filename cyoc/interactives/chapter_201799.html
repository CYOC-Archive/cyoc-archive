<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad felt so humiliated right now. However these triggers worked, Jenn had reduced him into a big baby, with no strength, no control over his bladder, his bowels or his emotions, and wearing diaper she just changed for him, along with mittens, silky footies and that damned pacifier he couldn´t even spit out. And his cock was still squeezed by the tiny cage it was in. But by the sound of it, she still had something else for him.<br />
Jenn went back towards her bag, and took out a folded-up piece of pink cloth. Chad had no idea what exactly it was, but he didn´t like the grin she had right now. “I guess you will need something so you won´t get cold out there, right Chaddy? Good that I have something against that problem.”<br />
Chad looked horrified at the big, pink onesie. He was screaming not only at the onesie itself, but also on the color of it. He wasn´t a girl. But it didn´t help, as Jenn opened up the zipper on the back of the onesie all the way down to the ass. And with little resistance from the teen-sized baby, who couldn´t act like he wanted to, Jenn slipped Chad´s feet into the legs of the onesie. Then she pulled his arms into it, stretching the material over his body with no problems. With his front inside the onesie, Jenn pushed him to his side, pulling the back together again. And just as quick sealed the zipper he would never be able to reach. <br />
But it wasn´t just a bright pink onesie. To add even more humiliation, on the front was written in big colorful letters “Chaddy, messy big baby girl”, making him want to cry yet again. He was neither a baby nor a girl. Jenn attached both the mittens and the footies to the onesie´s limbs, sealing him in even more.<br />
“There, all warm and comfy. Now you will be able to leave the fieldhouse without being naked again. Now, while you make a cute little baby girl, Chaddy, there is still the possibility for you to talk if someone takes your little pacifier from you. And that won´t do at all. A cute baby girl like you shouldn´t talk like a grown-up boy, you know. Let´s fix that at last. You will so get “Barking” mad from this.” With that, Jenn laughed evilly.<br />
Chad laid there, not realizing what the trigger was. All he felt was a little sting in his head, as if something had been cut through by that sting. But he couldn´t say what it was for. Not until Jenn took out his pacifier, enabling his mouth to speak again. “Ga go gi gi gu” left his mouth, his please shot down by his new inability to talk. And even his voice sounded girly with this nonsense. Taking that realization had only one effect, he started to wail in despair.<br />
Jenn replaced the pacifier and patted Chad´s hair a bit, which calmed him enough to turn to light sobbing instead. “It´s okay, baby. You are safe now. Only one last thing to do, just to calm you a bit.” That being said, Jenn took a small necklace out of her pocket, showing it to Chad. It was nothing more than a simple band of iron or maybe something colored like iron, he wasn´t too sure. The most important thing for him was the little pendant on it, which was a little key. With a few easy gestures, Jenn had closed it around his neck, smiling at him.<br />
As the necklace was closed around his neck, a sudden chill went through Chad´s body, as if it was dropped in ice before she gave it to him. And for an unknown reason, he dreaded what this would mean for him.<br />
“Yes, that looks good on you, Chaddy. And from that shiver I know its effect has started as well. You see, as long as you wear this little band around your neck, there is no way for you to break any of the commands given to you. Otherwise, I would have to reapply them from time to time. Before you ask, yes, that´s the key to your cage, not that you could use it. And now, little one, as the little chain will “Hide” itself from you along with the key, and other´s won´t find it without taking of your onesie.” Jenn explained as she again patted his head. “Now then, as soon will come over one of your little friends, and I don´t want him warned beforehand, you will need to be silent. Now, be a good little baby and “Sleep” a little while. And when you wake up, I will have a little surprise for you.” <br />
Chad´s eyes had widened about the knowledge what the little chain did exactly, horrified that it made the effect of her commands lasting. Even without much control, his hands had lifted to tear it off. It would also give him the key to his needed release. Only for him to forget it in the blink of his eyes, as the chain and key had vanished. He didn´t remember the chain or the key, and he could neither feel nor see it right now. And as the chain was small, it was unlikely for him to feel it through pressure, as his neck wasn´t that visible. He would most likely think it was the collar of that damned onesie.<br />
Then her second command took effect, and Chad started to get tired and sleepy rather quickly. In no time at all, he drifted off, laying there on the carpet asleep. Jenn smiled at her little baby. While she was angry with Chad, this now innocent little baby he had become, even if hadn´t shrunken or anything, felt already like her own. She pulled up a blanket over the sleeping form and moved towards the door of the room, deciding to deal with the others in a different one. She unlocked it, left the room, and locked the door again, before hiding in the room to the right. She had still twenty minutes until the next person would arrive here, after all.</p>
