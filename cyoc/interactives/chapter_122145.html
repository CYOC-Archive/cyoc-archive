<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate stood there as the warm summer air blew by in a gusty breeze, fluttering through his short and spiky styled hair from a combination of hair styling paste, gel and hairspray while also feeling it move the fine, but the dense amount of hair on his exposed forearms and lower legs from the knee down from wearing a short sleeve t-shirt and a pair of jean shorts. He always liked the look of being messy, yet styled, that also said volumes about the darker, rebellious side that he had ever since he was a youth. It wasn&#39;t always the way Nate had envisioned himself, but this is what happens when the world treats a young man like shit and isn&#39;t anything but cruel. On the outside, Nate was a kind and caring, individual. On the inside, he was hurt and angry for all of the things that happened to him that he had hoped the world would have prevented him from experiencing. As he stood there, Nate contemplated if he&#39;d go back into the mall because he genuinely felt bad about the theft, but the darker and more rebellious side of him won as he thought better of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... I am not going to lose my chance to be something that I&#39;ve always fantasized about being. That dark area I accidentally swiped the potions from looked like it was meant to be off limits, restricted, or at the very least a deterrent from people checking out those wares.&quot; He said aloud to no one, but himself, as he looked at both bottles in his hand and continued, &quot;No... I am going to consume both of these and become something the world hadn&#39;t ever imagined until I came along!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Nate opened the door to his charcoal gray 2009 Toyota Camry XLE with a tan leather interior and faux wood grain accouterments and set the bottles in the cup holder as he closed the door and started the car. However, before he actually went anywhere, the curiosity of the bottles seemed to speak to him... pleading with him to take a small amount of each before going anywhere. Nate couldn&#39;t help thinking that it wouldn&#39;t hurt to try just a little of each, changing him a small amount and leaving the rest for when he wasn&#39;t in such a small and tightly confined space such as his car. No... he wanted to be as comfortable as he could in open space when he took the full contents of the bottles. Nate also had a hunch that depending on which bottle he drank first, or at least sampled first, would have an effect on how he&#39;d look and be in the end. It was quite compelling to try the demon one first, just for something different for himself, but at the same time... he wanted to be a werewolf more than anything else. Although, he also knew that this would be just a sample and he could drink the remainder of the contents of the werewolf one first to be the werewolf first and then add the demon aspect after. <br />
<br />
As he came to terms with his plan, Nate grinned as he grasped the bottle with the demon on it first, safe to do so at a red light that was notoriously slow to turn green for the traffic crossing the highway. As Nate opened it, the smell of cinnamon filled the air, giving the indication that there was going to be a spiciness or a heat to what he was about to taste. Slowly, he brought the bottle to his lips, which was a sizeable container and took a small swig of the potentially potent potable. As the spicy fluid hit his tongue and slid down his throat and esophagus, pooling in the pit of his stomach, he winced and sucked his teeth as it burned on the way down as a strange and sinister heat filled his entire body as it seemed to branch and spider web out. Suddenly his look on life was different as he looked at all of the other people around, seeing them purely as creatures to subdue to his whim and will. Nate could feel the power, albeit a small amount, flowing through his veins. Even though it was a small amount, it felt as though he could feel all those people around him and their dark thoughts and fantasies. As the potable went through his system, Nate could feel a hellish heat inside of him now, burning him with dark desire as he could feel it burning away his pure soul and leaving a charred, dark, evil and sinister one in its&#39; place. Nate felt a desire to do much, much more dark things to everyone and bring them devilish delights. At the same time, he noticed that his fingernails had darkened a bit, growing out longer and sharper than normal as slight claws were established. Nate also noticed that his skin tone had darkened a bit, going from his typical pale white from his Irish and Scotish heritage to a nice tanned bronze color. His hair darkened from its typical reddish blonde to a dirty blonde with reddish tones. Then Nate noticed he could taste the metallic fluid of his own blood pouring over his tongue while he felt his bicuspids sharpening slightly to give the appearance of sinister human sized fangs.  As the light turned green, he felt the changes subside, but the desire to drink the full contents of the werewolf potable was incredibly strong... he wanted to feel what it was to be a beast of that nature and power... to be able to tear into his prey, who and whatever they might be, tearing and rending them into shreds.<br />
<br />
Finally as he was able to come to another stop at another notoriously long red light, there was absolutely no hesitation to grab the werewolf potion and drink just as much, maybe a slight amount greater than the demon one just to see what would happen to him. As he opened that bottle, the smell of pine and an earthy aroma filled the cabin of the car, making Nate long to be up at his family&#39;s cabin that he&#39;d only get to visit maybe once a year. Bringing the bottle up to his lips, Nate threw his head back and let the fluid flow into his mouth, down his throat and into his stomach to begin whatever effects he&#39;d feel. Just like with the demon one, he could feel the potion changing him as a more beastial and primal instinct started to enter his mind. He wanted to find others to bring into the fold, more members to add to Nate&#39;s pack as family, who he too would subdue... but not like those he&#39;d not gift his gift to. No... those would serve him and the rest of his pack as they, those not in the pack, were low and beneath him. Suddenly, like before, he noticed that his body was changing as Nate began to feel his clothes grow tighter as several pounds of muscle slipped onto his average frame while the hair that was on his body grew thicker and more abundant, looking far more manly and masculine than before. He couldn&#39;t help looking at his reflection for a moment, enjoying the look of the short, but thick beard that grew on his face in such short amount of time, especially considering before Nate had one hell of a time growing any facial hair at all. As Nate placed his attention back on the road before him, still waiting on the green light, Nate noticed out of the corner of his eye, in the rear view mirror, that his ears elongated taking on a more lupine look as the tips had pointed and the lobe of the ear took on a hybrid look to it. At the same time, Nate noticed his teeth had grown a bit longer and sharper while the demonic claws that had formed were now darker, slightly longer and curling like the menacing talons of a bird of prey. As the light turned green and traffic was allowed to move along, Nate stole a glance here and there of himself to look at the beast he had become... loving how he looked and couldn&#39;t wait to get home to go all the way, but the question was... would he drink the demon bottle completely or the werewolf bottle to begin with?</p>
