<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kelvin returned to his seat and Tim took his hand as he sat down, Kelvin smiled at him but Tim could tell something was wrong by the weird look Kelvin gave Tal, who was deep in the depths of a long funny story about ‘the FBM man and the magical snake’; Tim tilted his head in silent query, but Kelvin shook his head slightly- the gesture said simply ‘not here’.<br />
<br />
The FBM, and everyone else, left long before Richards party where herded out of the door by Silver and Bull. Tal insisted on paying for all of it at full cost, despite Bull’s attempts to give him a discount. The parties then drove back to the yard, there was some good natured ribbing about coming in for a nightcap, but no one pressed the point and after some back slapping and hand shaking Richard and his family drove home, leaving Tal and the two tried Shifters.<br />
“Well gents, I will be leaving again. I have a few duties to perform” Tal said with a cheery smile on his face. <br />
“Goodnight then” Kelvin said almost brushy. Tal’s smile slipped a little, but Kelvin stepped to the right and leaned into Tim a little more and winked at Tal<br />
“I’ll be leaving you to it then!” he said <br />
“Goodnight Tal, thanks for dinner. Will we see you again?” Tim said leaning back onto Kelvin, his anticipation beginning to rise. <br />
“Oh defiantly” Tal said “I will come back and check how you are coping etc.” There where more goodnights exchanged then Tal walked to his car and drove away. Tim unlocked the gates, waved Kelvin in then locked them again. <br />
<br />
Barking and growls greeted them as they walked into the yard, but a Command from Tim and a quick sniff from Butch was all it took to stop the Pack attacking. As Tim straightened from fussing the Alpha Kelvin asked<br />
“So what do we know about Tal then?” Tim turned to look at his giant lover<br />
“How do you mean?” Kelvin looked up at the clear stars above them, they where slightly ‘off’ compared to home, but still mostly the same. <br />
“Think about it” he said not looking at Tim “we have been dragged from our Homes, made into new people, and thrust into a world we don’t know and all because of Tal. We think he’s a good guy, but he’s proved slippery already, that trick with Richard and the statue, he’s got previous with Cosgrove. He’s powerful, mysterious, British, and strange- I think we need to be careful” Tim cupped Kelvin’s bearded chin in one paw and pulled his face down to look into his eyes<br />
“If not for Tal I would not of met you, and that alone has been worth it. Today has been one of the longest, strangest days of either of Tim’s lives, and frankly without you, I’d be harder pressed to cope. Tal we can worry about another time, for now lets enjoy each other!” Kelvin smiled and the two kissed, hands wandering up and down each others broad backs as they relaxed into each others arms. Tim finally broke the embrace<br />
“Bed! Before I do you right here” he whispered. Kelvin smiled at him, turned him round and propelled towards the house with a low sexy growl. <br />
<br />
Tim let them in and took only a cursory glance round before locking the door, and ascending the stairs. They tumbled into the Master bedroom grabbing at each other, kissing, growling, and hugging each other, their passions rising. They pulled their boots off, then Kelvin pushed Tim onto the bed and slowly started stripping for him; peeling off the work shirt to reveal the broad, thick hairy pecs, his solid gut, and massive arms, he pulled at his belt, but Tim lunged forward, pulling at the belt and jeans, getting them undone and pulled off his big, beautiful Bear of a lover. As Kelvin stepped from his jeans his growing cock slapped Tim the face and with a low growl Tim enveloped the thick head in his warm mouth, however Kelvin stopped him. <br />
“Not until your nude” he rumbled. Tim smiled and stood up, ripping the work shirt from his belt line and unbuttoning it. He pushed it from his own thick, heavy body, and ran a big hand through the rug of chest hair, licking his lips and teasing Kelvin with slow hip gyrations.<br />
“Tease” Kelvin rumbled his thick uncut cock thickening and throbbing with need. Tim grinned his slightly fanged grin and turned his back on Kelvin. He pulled his belt from his jeans slowly, and then coyly, he slipped the jeans down, revealing his thick buttocks an inch at a time, then down onto his thick hairy legs. Kelvin could take no more and jumped onto Tim, pushing him face down onto the bed, tickling him. Tim landed with a heavy ‘thumf ’; he tried to push Kelvin off him, but the big man pinned him, tickling mercilessly. Tim shifted slightly, becoming bigger and hairier, his bigger part-Bear form easily pushing Kelvin off him, but the bed was creaking dangerously. Tim rolled over just as Kelvin seemed ready to pounce again.<br />
“Not in here” Tim warned “the bed won’t take Bear form, we need the reinforced one for that!” Kelvin grinned and pulled him up. <br />
“Then lets go” he whispered deep and low in Tim’s rounded Bear ear. Tim allowed himself to shift back to Human, his own erect cock pressing into Kelvin as he leaned over and kissed him, tongues darting deep inside each others mouths. <br />
“Ok” he purred, and led the way to the Play room. <br />
<br />
Tim ignored the canvas bags just inside the door, he ignored the messed up sheets, what his eyes where drawn to was the sling on the far wall- there was someone in it!<br />
Tim shifted slightly as the sight; he could smell better this way. He crept closer- the stranger smelt almost familiar; he realised he could smell his own lube make! As he stepped up to the sleeping man Tim realised there was one of his own massive dildos in his suspended ass. Kelvin stepped up behind him and exclaimed, <br />
“Who the Hell is this guy and where the Hell did he come from?” Tim shrugged and noticed a piece of paper taped to the sleeping Human, he grabbed it off the man<br />
 “Feed Me Papa, I’m yours.” Tim said incredulously, “Whose idea of a joke is this?”<br />
Graham stirred at the outraged voices, and growled slightly, Tim and Kelvin could only watch as he shifted slightly, though still only partially changed, he was defiantly a Werebear, though he seemed very thin for a Werebear.<br />
“You don’t suppose the note is serious do you?” Kelvin asked, “Would someone dump a starving Werebear on you, Tim?” Tim shrugged again. <br />
“Should we wake him?” he asked. Kelvin stepped past Tim and circled the past the suspended man. <br />
“Probably a good idea” he said, and shifted to Bearman form. Tim nodded and followed suit. He reached out a hand and shook the thin man’s furry shoulder.</p>
