<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He had worn her down. She was in a weakened state and shivering from the cold trickling into her womb. Adam coated his cock in the special lubricant that gave him what he needed next. His slack member immediately went hard. He grabbed her hips as he had done many times before, shifted his position to match, then pulled her down onto himself. She grabbed her own breasts as she was sitting down into his lap, while he was still sitting on the edge of her bed. She humped his member slightly, shifting back and forth, feeling a warm, almost burning, but pleasant sensation within her, not unlike some special lubrication gels they had used before. He let a slight moan, while she looked at him over her shoulder telling him. <br />
<br />
He smiled, not caring about the magic part, just about the sensations, feeling the slight burning, too, and it turned him on hard. Thrusting into her, lifting his hip slightly and turning rhythmically, he went away in a frenzy of bliss. She moaned with every thrust of him, reaching down with her hands, rubbing her clit, while squeezing her own breast, closing her eyes and arching as she approached a climax.<br />
<br />
They both came at the same time, and while spurting into her, somewhere in the back of his mind he just worried whether she still took the pill, then all his worries exploded in a burst of ecstasy. Ana shuddered, arching heavily, grabbing both her breasts, as a wave of energy erupted from her vagina, intense as she had never felt before.<br />
<br />
When Ana opened her eyes again, still shuddering from the afterglow, her body felt weird. Somehow her legs movement seemed restricted, and very warm, and something was stuck to her hip. Adam had his eyes open and looked at Ana in astonishment. He could feel her body as if it was part of his, her skin, her arms, her breasts. Tiny and sensitive. He clenched his hip muscles, and Ana twitched a bit, her body shifted upright slightly. &quot;Hey!&quot; she yelped, feeling a weird jerk beyond her waist, moving her. She turned towards Adam, looking into his eyes. &quot;It really worked&quot; she whispered.<br />
<br />
Adam approached her with his hand, his fingers suddenly very big, ever so gently touching her breasts and exposed nipples. She smiled, but he gasped from the sensation. She could feel his skin around her he would probably sense all of her.<br />
<br />
Ana smiled benignly , touching her skin with her hands, rubbing her sides up and down, then squeezing her breasts, continuing with her neck, then her mouth, extending her tongue, licking her arms. Immediately she felt a pulsing jerk in her hips again as Adam responded to the stimulation, lifting her pointing straight up. He couldn&#39;t help but grasp her whole body with his hand, feeling her breasts between his fingers, feeling his fingers on her breasts, the slight touch so sensitive. Ana felt a pulsing sensation in her belly, and a warmness spreading, filling her, turning her on like crazy. She squeezed herself into Adam&#39;s hand, rubbing herself against his fingers, moaning. He moaned, too, tightening his grip slightly and stoking her, almost as if giving himself a hand job. With the new unique sensations it took not long, then he came hard. She had an orgasm at the very same time, arching strong, grabbing her breasts between his fingers, her legs clenching together, squeezing the testicles beyond her feet. Then she felt a pressure, as something squirted inside her, through her. Her head arching back, and a warm liquid pressing up through her throat. His cum exited her mouth in a long arch, tasting slightly salty on her lips.<br />
<br />
Ana didn&#39;t care, the afterglow being more intense then the last time. She felt a nice warmness all inside her. While the pulsing had receded mostly, she rested in his lap. Gently she kissed his legs, feeling Adam&#39;s fingers on her back, where he stroked her, petting her nicely. &quot;That was great&quot; she said. &quot;It felt so, complete.&quot; Adam just nodded, still dizzy from what he had experienced.<br />
<br />
Adam then stood up,to get the phone. Ana was lifted from her resting place in his lap and dangled head down from between his legs. &quot;Hey!&quot; she yelped, shifting back, arching backwards to get into an upright position. Somehow, when he was not excited, their joint seemed to have much less strength, she wasn&#39;t able to hold up, just arching to a sort of straight forward position. So she grabbed his hair and pulled herself up that way. <br />
<br />
Adam got his boxer shorts, and started sliding in. Carefully he pulled it over Ana, she grabbing the fabric and aiding it over her head. She found out it had a comfortable bulge in it where she could rest, while he walked and got the rest of his clothes on. &quot;Are you OK in there&quot; Adam asked? Her response was muffled, but he could feel that she had nodded. It was still weird to feel her body like this, as part of his own.<br />
<br />
Walking over, he felt her shifting in his pants, and again it aroused him. Her skin seeming so much more sensitive. She felt the arousing pulse from beneath, shifting her around, erecting her position a bit. A slight moan escaped her, as her now erect nipples brushed against the skin of his pants. She yelled at him. &quot;Hey, don&#39;t tell me you feel like this every time you walk.&quot; Adam smiled, then grabbed the bulge in his pants and squeezed a bit, feeling the pressure on his Ana, forcing a slight Moan out of her again.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to get you clean though.&quot; Adam suggested. Ana nodded, gulping down a last drop of cum, as they went to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Adam went under the shower, and put Ana under the sprinkler, then offered some soap to her. Then he just enjoyed as she brushed her own body, sending shivering sensations through his body again, as she touched herself. Ana found out that she was unable to eat anything, without hurting both herself and Adam. Her insides didn&#39;t seem to work the same way anymore.<br />
<br />
Ana gave him a mischievous look, then took one of her nipples between her fingers and twisted it till it hurt. Immediately she felt a jerking in her lower body, as Adam responded, letting out a gasp. A slight pulsing started and Ana was heaved into a more upright position again. It came naturally to her to start rubbing herself, teasing herself. The throbbing went stronger. She could feel Adam&#39;s heartbeat all over her body, as if he pumped her with his blood. That somehow turned her on even more. She caressed her own neck, then Adam&#39;s strong hand engulfed her whole body and started to stroke slightly. She closed her eyes, feeling a few drops of precum coming up her throat again, filling her mouth with the thick tasty slime. Then a surge deep within her made her arch, like an electric shock, and spurt a big load of cum out of her mouth, and across the bedsheets.<br />
<br />
As she came to herself this time, she felt weak and limp. Somehow something was odd. She realized she couldn&#39;t feel her legs. She could however perfectly feel Adam&#39;s testicles in the sack beneath her. Something in her lower torso seemed to have changed too, her muscles felt different, and her lower spine seemed to be simply gone.<br />
<br />
Her upper body, breasts, shoulders and arms seemed mostly as before. Still it was odd.<br />
<br />
Adam felt it too, and looked at her. Then felt his ball sack with his hand, lifting Ana up, who&#39;s body was bendable in weird ways.<br />
<br />
Adam looked more closely, squeezing Ana&#39;s waist. There seemed to be no bone in there. But his body responded to the touch, and soon Ana felt a light throbbing again, making her belly elongate, thicken and harden, a few veins appearing under her skin that weren&#39;t there before.<br />
<br />
Adam gazed at her with worry and fascination at the same time. It felt like getting a boner, but instead Ana went erect. Soon the swelling reached her chest, and, making Ana gasp, heaved her chest up, almost against her will, as if she had his dick between her rips.<br />
<br />
Ana looked at him sadly, she didn&#39;t like this new development. Still of course her body responded to the sensations, her nipples growing hard and pointy, but her arms stuck sideways a bit helplessly. She tried to speak, but couldn&#39;t flex her lungs enough, only a soft moan escaping her lips.<br />
<br />
Adam panted, then waited for the erection to ebb down. Slowly Ana relaxed, being able to breathe again. <br />
<br />
He nodded and walked over, Ana dangling helplessly from his waist. Then came back sitting down.  Ana  braced herself, then Adam started stroking his dick, her body, until the throbbing had filled her up that she thought she&#39;d burst, throbbing with every heartbeat of him, making her dizzy but also turning her on like crazy. Soon again she couldn&#39;t hold herself. She felt his warm load press up through her body, through a pipe somewhere under her skin, ending in her mouth making her squirt his cum over the sheets again.<br />
<br />
As the afterglow ebbed down, her hair had disappeared, leaving her head skin bare and soft, her face elongated and thick, her tongue seemingly gone, but her mouth being weirdly round now. Within it she could still feel some drops of cum, but she couldn&#39;t gulp. She couldn&#39;t turn her head either, but there seemed to be a lot of skin around her shoulders. Adam lifted her up. and looked at her. Her arms were gone too, and her breasts were only slight bulges on the front side of his dick, ending in visible nipples.<br />
<br />
Ana tried to speak, but she only got a moan. She seemed to have no bones in her chest anymore, her movement restricted to twitching and slightly bending one way or the other. Her lower body was completely limp and looked exactly like Adam&#39;s dick would normally look.<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t right.&quot; He said. &quot;There must be a mistake, I think this wearing off doesn&#39;t mean you get free, you are just turning into my dick. We need to find a counter spell or something&quot;. Ana managed something like a nod. Not much but at least proofing to Adam that she was still there.<br />
<br />
He felt Ana shudder and sob. Frantically he searched the book for possible clues to how to counter the effect. Ana eventually sleeping on his lap, he spent most of the night making notes, learning more about the magic. But eventually he was too tired to think, placed the book away and went to sleep, careful not to wake Ana while covering himself with a blanket.<br />
<br />
Ana woke up in the middle of the night. It was warm, dark and moist, some skin covering most of her face. Her lips brushed against fabric, her sides resting against Adam&#39;s warm tights. She could hear him snoring slightly.<br />
<br />
She tried to stretch herself to get her eyes free. Wiggling a bit she felt herself sliding over his legs, the fabric brushing against her tip. Wiggling more, eventually her body responded. Or was it Adam&#39;s? She couldn&#39;t tell. But with a slight pulsing she felt herself get erect a bit, the skin pulling back, freeing her eyes. Soft fabric brushed over her exposed face. Nothing to do, imprisoned under the twilight of the blanket she started thinking about her situation. Being in place of Adam&#39;s dick wasn&#39;t even that bad, she found. She always had liked to be really close to him. But the recent merging, turning her limp and immobile was depressing. And another cum would turn her completely into his dick, unknown whether she&#39;d even still be able to think. But then she thought about him, having doomed her, while caring for her. He&#39;d probably spent the rest of their lives trying desperately not to cum ever again. And eventually it was inevitable, a moist dream or another girl screwing with him, and that would be it. She wasn&#39;t really looking forward to him having to pee either. She could feel his bladder somewhere behind her, it was starting to strain, he would have to pee in the morning.<br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t sleep, so she continued pondering. But as the time went on, a decision was slowly forming in her mind. It made no sense to try to postpone the inevitable. It might be better for her and better for him to get it over with. When he stirred again, then turned around in his sleep, squeezing Ana between his hip and the bed, pressing her into the sheets, it settled her decision.<br />
<br />
Ana started to wiggle a bit, trying to press herself into the sheets a bit more. Eventually Adam&#39;s erection grew, elongating her, exposing her face fully. Veins bulged on her body, giving her a ripply look, her breasts shifting over the sheet. She gasped slightly, then with tears of determination, she continued rubbing over the sheets.<br />
<br />
Adam didn&#39;t wake up. But he still responded, letting a couple of unintelligible moans, and starting to hump the sheets rhythmically. By that Ana didn&#39;t care anymore, sexual bliss taking over logical thinking. She felt the pulsing of Adam&#39;s blood in tune with his heartbeat pump up her body completely, even her face hard and erect, her skin smooth and firm, stretched over the swelling within her. She couldn&#39;t even move, as firm as she was pressed into her skin, she felt the pipe going through her, ending in her mouth. And she had no way to stop the liquid of the first precum sipping out and wetting the sheets, sticky on her cheeks. Her breasts started hurting slightly from rubbing against the sheet so much, but she didn&#39;t care. Shuddering she awaited the climax, at the same time hoping it would take a bit longer, since it would be her end, and also because it felt so good, so good...<br />
<br />
Adam spread a big load of cum into the bed sheet, but he was so tired, he didn&#39;t even wake from it. It wasn&#39;t until in the morning, when he looked at his surroundings, and, seeing the bedroom and the magic book on the table, it dawned to him what had happened. He hurried to put the sheet away to see after Ana, but the nagging feeling that she wouldn&#39;t be there, judging by a slight stickiness and him unable to feel her, turned to reality when he saw the yellowish stain on the sheet, and his own cock, limp and small and wrinkly between his legs, and no trace of Ana anywhere.<br />
<br />
He cried. He tore on his hairs, ripped the sheet of the bed and kicked them through the flat, but it didn&#39;t change anything. Ana was gone. No not really. She was part of him now, he felt younger, healthier, and his dick seemed bigger, even while it was limp. And it hadn&#39;t been small before.</p>
