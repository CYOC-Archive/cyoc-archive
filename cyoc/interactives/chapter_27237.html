<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>Mary knew just what she wanted this time. She searched and located the vial with a cow on its label. "This ought to be interesting," she said to herself. She tipped the vial into her mouth, taking several careful sips. Back in the box it went as Mary took careful measure of her current form. For some reason even she couldn't explain, she felt right about all of this. Every change she was going through was exhilarating, and the mystery of the transformations was enticing.
<P>She couldn't wait for her next change, but knew she had no choice. She remembered that, even though it was past noon, she had yet to do any real work, and her house was in need of some tidying up. She remembered that mess she had created in the kitchen, and started with that. She enjoyed moving about in her bulkier form. It made a normally mundane task more exciting. She made a point to be more careful, however, as she accidentally dragged her tail in some things she had spilled on the floor.
<P>She picked up the end of it and waddled back to the bathroom, where she dumped it in the tub and started running some water. She shivered at the cold. For a moment she hadn't expected it to feel anything, but of course, it was a part of her now and she had to be mindful of that. "Better not close this in any doors," she thought.
<P>She was drying her nice and clean rat tail off when she finally felt her cow changes begin. She turned to the bathroom mirror and scanned her body. She felt that pit in her stomach again, and the hunger quickly followed. This time, though, she was able to stand it, at least for a little while. She didn't want to miss her changes.
<P>The visual changes started in her face. She watched as her ears slowly emerged from her hair, their points lengthening. Then from just above them came light gray horns. They curled out, then quickly arced upward. They were short and petite. Mary glided her finger across one of them and tested its slightly dull point. Her ears grew short black fur, and then stopped changing.
<P>Her hunger was stabbing at her now, and she couldn't ignore it any longer. She walked as fast as she could, noticing that moving around was coming much easier to her now, and ransacked her kitchen for the third time. She tipped cereal boxes straight into her mouth, then gulped down all the milk she had left. She ate the 3/4 loaf of bread she still had in the cupboard, as well as dozens of crackers. There were also veggies in the bottom drawer of her fridge.
<P>Her hunger vanquished, she used some paper towels to wipe off the excess food from her face, neck and breasts, then retreated to her couch. She landed on it with such force she could hear parts of it creak and snap. She rubbed her beach-ball sized tummy with content.
<P>In a minute, her stomach rumbled and started to deflate, spreading its rich nutrients to the rest of her body. She could feel herself sinking further into the cushions as the weight distributed itself through her arms and legs. Her cheeks puffed ever so slightly, as did her neck. Her hips widened again and her arms bulked up.
<P>Then something else began to change. Her eight breasts became warm and heavier, and her nipples tightened. She watched with wide eyes as each nipple stretched longer and longer, thickening into teats perfect for milking. She gently squeezed one and gasped as a small jet of white milk shot out of it. She giggled at the pleasure it generated inside of her. Then she saw that her hands were changing as well. The fingers were thickening and merging together. Her pinky and ring finger swallowed each other, as did her middle and index fingers. She was left with two fingers and a thumb on each hand. Her hands themselves had grown somewhat in proportion to her expanding body, and they now had large black fingertips.
<P>She tried to see over her breasts and gut to tell if her feet had changed the same way, but it was useless. She wiggled her toes, but felt only two on each foot. She grunted as she slowly stood up. She could tell she weighed even more now, but moving around was still pretty easy in comparison. She flexed her thick arms and realized that her muscles had once again been enhanced. She was glad to discover that her body wasn't just gaining fat. In fact, her legs had never felt so strong. As she continued to the bathroom for one more look in the mirror, each step became easier than the last, even though she was trucking a sizable pot belly and eight breasts full of milk.
<P>She stood in the mirror for a while, caressing her soft figure. She still hadn't developed things like fat folds or double-chins. Her hourglass figure was only a small hint at this point, but she still resembled "chubby" more than "obese." Her muscles were faintly defined under her thick skin. She loved how she looked, with her horns, ears, belly, tail, breasts and funny little teats.
<P>She felt different, and yet, perfect. For reasons she couldn't explain, her rat/pig/cow form was pleasing and rewarding. She loved how her ears flopped across the sides of her face and could perk up at a moment's notice. She enjoyed the warm, full sensations from her breasts, the pulling weight of her tummy and the feelings her tail was sending her as it lay on the ground.
<P>Mary was so content, in fact, that she trudged straight to her bedroom and flopped down on her bed. This furniture also creaked loudly, but she didn't pay it any mind. She was full, content, satisfied, pleased, and more. She continued caressing her teats as she fell into a deep sleep.</p>
