<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason woke up to something he had never experienced before, nor had Nick. He woke up to his cock being sucked off, right on the verge of orgasm. Bleary eyes focused on Phil who had his mouth wrapped around Jason&#39;s cock, but already Jason felt his muscles clenching and his balls churning. A moment later he was filling Phil&#39;s mouth with his cum, groaning softly at the unexpected experience.<br />
<br />
&quot;Christ..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh good, you&#39;re up.&quot; Phil said with a devilish smile after licking the last few drops of cum from Jason&#39;s tip. &quot;Sorry to wake you up, I have class soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If that&#39;s how you wake me up,&quot; Jason retorted, &quot;You don&#39;t need to apologize.&quot; He stretched out and wrinkled his nose a little as some of last night&#39;s dried cum flaked off. &quot;Time for a shower at least?&quot;<br />
<br />
Phil looked at the clock thoughtfully. &quot;One shower at least. Good thing my shower&#39;s big enough for two.&quot; Jason didn&#39;t need it spelled out for him as Phil led him to the bathroom. They didn&#39;t fool around in the shower, much, simply enjoying lathering each other up and getting a little handsy. Phil took special attention to Jason&#39;s ass, letting his semi-hard cock rest between those cheeks for a long moment as he lathered up Jason&#39;s chest. The fight inside Jason was getting less and less, he was actually enjoying this and Nick had to wonder if Jason was a bit closeted to begin with, it just seemed so easy to turn him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, will I get to see you again?&quot; Phil asked as he watched Jason get dressed, buttoning up his own shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so.&quot; Jason responded with a smile. He wiggled into the tight jeans which felt even tighter over his ass than they did last night. He remembered he was trying to get that to be a bit fuller and his hole a bit looser. Maybe it was that taking affect. A quick check with a hand confirmed his ass felt a bit fuller than it was yesterday.<br />
<br />
The way Phil was smiling, he obviously thought the hand on the ass was a bit of a show for him. &quot;Tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have hockey practice this evening, but maybe after.&quot; Jason said as he pulled the fishnet tank back on over his chest. There was one more long kiss before he left the apartment, making his way back to the frat. Walking in in the same outfit he left in last night was a clear giveaway as to what he had been up to last evening, but he strode through the house as cockily as he could manage. There were a few stares and a couple of laughs, awkward ones. The brothers weren&#39;t sure what to make of this new Jason. There was no proof he had went to be with a guy last night, but he thought some might suspect.<br />
<br />
Once he got to his room he stripped off his shirt, tossing it aside. There was a knock on the door and Jason opened it to Brody standing there, thick baseball player&#39;s arms crossed over his chest. He kind of pushed his way into the room, and Jason let him. &quot;Hey, man.&quot; He said, shutting the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, what has gotten into you? Some of the other guys are worried.&quot; Brody was wearing only a tank and shorts, still a little flushed looking from a morning work out, his chestnut brown hair just long enough to curl slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just trying out something new. I think you&#39;d like it.&quot; Jason said with a shrug, trying to act calm. He watched Brody&#39;s eyes, and they weren&#39;t keeping to his face. Oh there was something there, they way his eyes lingered on Jason&#39;s bare chest and ass. Oh a whim Jason strode over and groped Brody through the thin fabric of his shorts, feeling the semi-hard cock settle into his grip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude!&quot; Brody began, but Nick planted an idea in Jason&#39;s mind, hoping he was conditioned enough to go through with it and quickly let go of the hockey jock. He braced himself against the shift in perspective as he slid into Brody. It really was easier each time. He was looking at Jason, licking his lips, ready to hop back in case Jason didn&#39;t act the way he hoped.<br />
<br />
But Jason knelt and pulled down Brody&#39;s shorts, letting the fairly average cock flop free. He did have a nice set of heavy balls down there though. Nick settled into Brody and pulled off his tank, grinning as Jason lifted his cock and took it into his mouth. Jason wasn&#39;t skilled at giving blow jobs, not yet, but he went at it with eagerness. Nick was pleased to see how much he had already changed the jock in just a couple of days.<br />
<br />
He rifled through Brody&#39;s thoughts and emotions as Jason sucked him off, letting one hand rest on  Jason&#39;s shaggy blond hair. Brody wasn&#39;t just bi or bi-curious, no, he was definitely gay. Completely ashamed of it though and eager to hide it, though this wasn&#39;t his first blowjob from a guy either. Nick might have to come back to this one once he was done with Jason.<br />
<br />
He bucked his hips a few times as he felt himself near climax, then grunted as he shot his cum right down Jason&#39;s throat. To his surprise Jason didn&#39;t even try to pull of Brody&#39;s cock until he had finished cumming. Jason stood up slowly and Brody leaned in for a kiss, tasting his own salty seed still on Jason&#39;s lips. Nick slipped back into Jason with another thought.<br />
<br />
Brody jerked and pulled back. Nick&#39;s time inside him wasn&#39;t long enough to do too much in way of lasting changes, but no doubt this would have an impact. &quot;I.. forget this happened.&quot; Brody said nervously, quickly pulling up his shorts and exiting the room. He didn&#39;t even grab his tank from where he dropped it, just in a hurry to get away.<br />
<br />
Jason just grinned and got ready for classes.</p>
