<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It didn&#39;t take Alex too long to reach his class, although he was a few minutes late. Stepping quietly into the back of the lecture hall, he shuffled over to one of the center seats and groaned. He generally tried to sit up front, where he could actually hear the professor properly, but this would have to do. Annoyed with how the day had gone so far, he pulled out his notebook and began to take notes.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long for Alex&#39;s thoughts to wander back to what had happened in the bathroom. Seeing the two footballers going at it had been so much more exhilarating than any porn he&#39;d watched online. There&#39;d been something exciting about jerking off, watching the two of them, and getting caught had been both terrifying and a little hot too. It was too bad that Alex hadn&#39;t been able to help them out, maybe clean up the excess cum...<br />
<br />
He jolted out of his reverie for a moment. Clean up the excess cum? &quot;What the hell has gotten into me,&quot; Alex muttered, trying to refocus his attention back onto the lecture on quantum mechanics. But after a few more moments, his thoughts went back to thinking about Jack&#39;s anger, the muttered phrases the receiver had mouthed as he ran away. What had he been saying? Alex almost hoped it had been some invitation for him to join in, and he had this new longing to let Jack have his way with him, maybe cum or even piss on his face...<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck!&quot; he snapped a little too loudly. A few of the other students in the lecture near the back turned and stared at Alex, but the professor continued on obliviously. There&#39;s no way I&#39;m gonna learn anything like this, he thought in frustration as he began to collect his stuff and stood up to leave. Making his way back out of the lecture hall, he absentmindedly began to walk towards the nearby washroom, his thoughts buried deep in trying to puzzle out why these new thoughts were flooding his mind and whether Jack had had anything to do with it.<br />
<br />
As Alex opened the door, he unknowingly walked right into a large man, his face smacking into his pecs. &quot;Oh, sorry about that...&quot; he started, rubbing his nose and cursing as he looked up, but once he realized who it was his voice trailed off. He was staring up into Jack&#39;s chiseled face, complete with an angular jawline, perfect sneer and piercing green eyes. Somehow, Alex had managed to run right back into the one person he had been trying to avoid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if it isn&#39;t the queer from before,&quot; Jack snickered, grabbing Alex by the arm and locking the washroom door with his free hand. &quot;I&#39;m guessing you liked the show earlier, huh?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;N-n-no!&quot; Alex yelped as he was pulled further into the washroom. &quot;I-I didn&#39;t know what was going on! I d-d-didn&#39;t mean to stand there or-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can cut the shit, nerd. You&#39;re gonna be getting a lot more of it soon anyways,&quot; Jack sneered. &quot;Get down on your knees, slut.&quot;<br />
<br />
Without warning, Alex felt his legs collapse on order underneath him, sinking down to kneel before Jack. Jack kept a firm grip on Alex&#39;s head, and Alex was practically at eye level with Jack&#39;s crotch now, a large bulge clear through his jeans. The musk radiating off of Jack was undeniably alluring, clouding Alex&#39;s mind a little before he pulled himself back to the present situation. &quot;L-Look, Jack, I-I won&#39;t tell anyone!&quot; Alex protested. &quot;I&#39;m a nobody - p-p-please let me g-go...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Far too late for that,&quot; Jack laughed, unbuckling his belt as he slipped his jeans down to allow his package to spring forward a little, straining against the cotton fabric of his boxers. &quot;You see, when I saw you standing there, cumming through your jeans, I said a few choice words that are gonna change you life forever. You&#39;re going to be getting a lot more used to this sort of view... so let me help you along.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack pulled his cock out of his boxers, his uncut dick already sporting an erection of at least ten inches. A significant part of Alex couldn&#39;t help but feel turned on, but his fear was still dominating his mind. &quot;J-J-Jack, please... I can even, um, help you out if you, uh, let me forget all of this happened,&quot; he stammered. &quot;I-I can make you h-happy and we can part ways...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack paused for a moment, almost mockingly thinking what Alex had said over, before shrugging. &quot;Sure, why not? Doesn&#39;t matter to me - you&#39;re fate&#39;s sealed anyways, so let&#39;s make this fun for the both of us,&quot; he grinned, letting his cock tease the opening of Alex&#39;s mouth. Swallowing audibly, Alex opened his mouth as Jack stuffed his cock in, nearly causing Alex to choke. Surprisingly, though, Jack&#39;s cock was able to slide all the way in, even going down a bit of Alex&#39;s throat, but he didn&#39;t even feel close to gaging...<br />
<br />
Jack began to thrust as Alex sucked, his thoughts shifting towards pleasure and a want to make Jack happy. Not even questioning this in the moment, he began to moan, his tongue licking Jack&#39;s shaft greedily as it pounded his face. It almost felt like his mouth was open unnaturally wide, his jaw extended further than it should, but all Alex could think about was how badly he needed Jack to fuck him.<br />
<br />
As Jack got closer and closer to climax, Alex began to feel warmer all over, as if he was beginning to bake on the surface on his skin. He groaned, feeling the warmth shift to itchiness, and he tried to scratch his arms as Jake continued to pound his face into Jake&#39;s crotch, hand firmly gripped on Alex&#39;s head. Moaning in anticipation, his own cock was rock hard, creeping towards release, and Alex&#39;s free hand began to rub it through his pants, wanting to serve Jake and release his own feelings.<br />
<br />
All at once, Alex felt his cock climax as Jake&#39;s cock erupted in an orgasm. Alex felt himself greedily lap up the cum as it poured down his throat, his own dick cumming all over his second pair of pants for the day. He was so out of it that all he could think of was wanting more and more from Jake, and as the cum subsided he felt himself longing for something... something else. As Jake began to withdraw his penis, his face changed subtly, a darker grin forming as his cock began to release something else... piss.<br />
<br />
Not even trying to be clean, Jake began to drench Alex in piss, much of it landing in his wide open mouth, but some splattering all over his face and shirt. Alex felt himself reacting in both horror and lust, almost as if two parts of him were now fighting the desires to retch and to beg for more. As the golden stream subsided, he found that he couldn&#39;t actually move, his eyes still shut and his mouth still unnaturally open as Jake chuckled. &quot;Thanks for that, slut,&quot; he snickered, zipping his pants back up. &quot;I&#39;ll see ya soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once Jake exited the washroom, Alex slowly began to feel mobility return to his limbs. Gasping for air, his eyes flew open as he steadied his body against a nearby stall. His mind was running at a mile a minute, questions about what had happened and why he&#39;d acted that way at the forefront. But before those questions could be answered, Alex&#39;s mind turned to an immediate problem - he was drenched with piss, his jeans were soiled, he smelled like a toilet and also needed to get back to his room without getting noticed too much. <br />
<br />
Wiping his face with some paper towel, he quickly peeked out of the washroom to survey the empty hall, not noticing the large clump of body hair he&#39;d left behind on the ground. In fact, the only hair now left on his body was the messy black mop on his head and his two eyebrows. Realizing the coast was clear, Alex took off, not stopping once until he was finally back in his dorm room</p>
