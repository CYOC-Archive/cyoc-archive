<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary woke up from her long nap and asked from Sylvia if there was anybody asking for her. Sylvia replied back by saying that she didn&#39;t hear or see anyone. Mary looked at her phone but shrugged as if nothing had happened. The afternoon turned into a night as Mary kept her door revolving. Sylvia shut herself inside her own room while Jennifer was left all by herself to the living room to witness all the men that visited her grandma. In her delirious state the whole world felt mind numbing as she tried to make herself busy with something. She had no phone, no-one to talk with and the days begun to feel the same. Jennifer was considering leaving the house if her situation didn&#39;t change at all. Maybe tomorrow she could attend school and find someone, anyone to talk with.<br />
<br />
Although during that particular night. Jennifer woke up to a strong fever and tremors. The bizarre body shaking experience was different from the previous transformations. Jennifer hold her both hands on the pile as her body was shaking. Jennifer&#39;s stomach was turning upside down which meant she had to run to the bathroom to empty her stomach. It took a lot of effort to walk forward. The moment Jennifer stood up she fell to the piss filled floor as the changes were messing with her balance. Causing the water splatter everywhere and some of it dripping to her body making Jennifer wet. Jennifer&#39;s eyes were spinning as the whole house felt as if she was walking on top of a boat&#39;s deck. It took too much effort from her to reach the toilet.<br />
<br />
Jennifer pushed her index and middle finger down her throat as it made her body forcefully to vomit whatever was inside her. She felt that the dog food must have made her sick as the fever didn&#39;t go away. The bathroom walls begun to spiral and small mercury colored dots appeared all over the house. It wasn&#39;t just Jennifer&#39;s vision but the whole house was warping and distoring like a modern art piece. Jennifer felt her own body burning as she grew taller. She tried her best to crawl back to the cloth pile but it seemed have grown bigger to accommodate her own growth. All of the clothes being used band t-shirts and all sorts of one-liner shirts with very provocative jokes. Was she the one collecting these or were her mother throwing them into a the same pile for her to sleep on. The Jennifer sized dent grew bigger as she lied back on top of the cloth pile bed.<br />
<br />
Jennifer wasn&#39;t quite sure if the house was getting smaller or if it was just her vision getting blurry as she couldn&#39;t concentrate eyes properly into anything. Her whole body was fighting against the sensations and overstimulating experience she was having. The moment she closed her eyes everything stopped. A second passed. Then another. And another...<br />
<br />
Jennifer gasped air as she finally woke up. To her it only had been seconds but around her the whole place looked different than yesterday. Was that just a nightmare she just had or did she really crawl all over the house... Jennifer didn&#39;t want to experience that feeling again and swiped cold sweat from her forehead. She looked at her surroundings as she had no clue how much thing had changed this time. Something strong was penetrating her nose. A horrific smell. Jennifer had to hold her nose as the whole house smelled like urine. The smell of piss was permeating from every corner of the house. The stank was awful but quickly her nose somehow got used to it. She then checked herself and confirmed that she was year older than yesterday. She wore her mother&#39;s black t-shirt as her pajama. It looked crusty and was way too big. Jennifer swore that it was the same t-shirt what her mother wore yesterday as the faded logo was the same one she remembered. It seemed that she wore anything that her mother had previously worn which also meant... ugh... Jennifer rubbed her temple as she was sure that Mary didn&#39;t seem to care what her offspring wore as long as it was something. <br />
<br />
Jennifer stood up and squated down to think like she always did. Thinking what she should do next as the doublewide trailer home had changed a little bit. There was no clocks in the wall but based on the sunlight Jennifer thought it must have been five or six in the morning based on the light&#39;s color and position inside the room. Jennifer spotted a heavily used and dust covered backpack near the front door. As Jennifer went to inspect it she noticed that it had her name on it. On top of it was her mother&#39;s name that was crossed with a marker. Well at least she was attending school. Jennifer worried if Mary had prepared some proper clothes her to wear in the school. Her own mother seemed to neglect her parental role as Mary was acting more mother like in this timeline. Fearing that if something happened to Mary, Jennifer&#39;s life would go down the drain with a snap-of-a-finger. Jennifer had time to think and collect her thoughts as she could hear her whole family snoring behind the two doors.</p>
