<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad slowly came back to himself. Well, herself, now. She grunted. Her head hurt and she was still feeling sleepy. But she could glimpse sun rays through her eyelids. But what surprised Chad most at first were the smells that reached his nostrils unencumbered by sleep. Different smells. Of dirt. Of hay. Of grass and all sorts of vegetal scents. Yet they felt oddly reassuring. And there were tons of wafts from animal origins. Of fur, wastes and other kinds. Including sweat. Human sweat. But that did not bother much as much as she would have thought. It was mingled with artificial odors of deodorant but weirdly enough it felt like those were the smells that attacked her nostrils. She could also sniff whiffs of pungent smells that were familiar yet laden with testosterone and oestrogen. These should not have been normal, or interesting. Yet they were. Chad slowly roused herself. She was in a little park with vegetation, a deep ditch and high walls. There was a swing made of an old tire and a few fake rocks and real logs. She wondered if he had passed out in a little dingy park. And then she heard a voice. That of a little kid.<br />
&quot;Look, Mommy, he&#39;s waking up!&quot;<br />
&quot;He is, sweetie, but I think the guide at the entrance said it was a girl.&quot;<br />
What? Had Chad fallen in a zoo enclosure? This was bad! He didn&#39;t want to end as an animal\s lunch! But as he fully rose, he noticed that he was on all fours. And it was natural. And his hands were knuckles! And he... Oh, no! It had all been real! Damian had transformed him into a sexy gorilla! A sexy female gorilla! And now he was in a zoo! He tried to approach the people goggling at him but had to stop as he neared the deep ditch. And the walls were too smooth and way too steep. He tried to talk but only grunts came out. And still people stared at him and little kids said he was trying to speak. Then Chad tried to do gestures to say he was human but everyone laughed and said he was trying to imitate people, or that he was from a circus. Then a loud voice boomed, saying Chad&#39;s name and it startled him, making him jump and the people laugh all the harder at him.<br />
&quot;Chad here has just arrived, folks! She is a very healthy female gorilla of about five years old and if she integrates well into Maestro&#39;s troupe, well, she might become a mother in a year or more. First, she is left here for her to adjust. Then, she&#39;ll be slowly introduced to Maestro and other females. If he takes to her and if she is smitten by him, well, she&#39;ll have a new life with her kind. Gorilla are highly social animals so if Maestro isn&#39;t to her liking, another male can be found for her. But ladies, who could resist a strapping, strong but tender and sweet male ready to make all your dreams come true?&quot;<br />
Everyone laughed heartily at that, much to Chad&#39;s utter humiliation.<br />
&quot;And gorillas&#39; dreams are simple: food, friends and a family, a good life of naps, snacks and play. Chad will soon be bent completely upon settling and having babies. Her mothering instincts will kick in and she&#39;ll be ready to take care of many adorable babies!&quot;<br />
Many cooed at that  and the guide finished his silly speech. The rest of the day went by a bit the same way. Chad tried to make signs ands everyone thought him cute in his attempts to imitate human beings. And it wasn&#39;t even easy to do signs with those stupid fingers too, and impossible to race letters to write about his plight! Angered beyond measure, especially at a bunch of teens who were about the same age as Chad had been before his transformation that chortled at the notion of a silverback taking Chad into a harem and saying that ,male gorillas had it made for them, Chad flipped his middle fingers at them. Everyone roared with laughter and the teens made even ruder gestures and thrust their groins at her and yelled that she wanted some real dicks. Chad snarled her fangs at them but they just mocked and jeered some more, until an employee told them to behave appropriately, no matter how the animals acted in turn. Chad was very glad to see the sun set and the visitors leave. He had by then become so hungry that he munched on the food provided, with were vegetables and fruits. Before he knew it, he had finished the entire tray. He had never before eaten his greens and fruits so fast and so much of those too! He had been naked all day yet it had not felt shameful at all, even as a female. Maybe because of the hair. Urinating had ben a bit weird, though. Chad assumed too that he would never sleep correctly in the bed of leaved and hay in the makeshift cave in the corner yet he soon felt it was most comfy and he slept deeply, trying to forget what would the next days have in store for him. How long until he was deem fit to &quot;adjust&quot; to Maestro? And to the other gorillas? He&#39;d have to make clear that he was not at all interested! Then the employees would leave him alone, surely. Hopefully. But he sensed more mockery, boredom and humiliations were to come. In fact, he had turned his back to the visitors a few times, hoping they&#39;d get bored and leave him alone without making fun of him. However, just then, Damian had come to see how his bully was now faring and he had had a few ideas...</p>
