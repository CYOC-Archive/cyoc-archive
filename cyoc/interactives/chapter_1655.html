<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Painstaking indeed. The castle, located on a cliff like all good castles, neat and majestic. Tall towers rises up into the sky. Glittering in the sunshine in a color like hawaian surfers. the whole castle was build out of sandstone, giving it both an ancient and modern look. Banners in all colors where flying on the tops and in the streets. beneath that was the town, where happy sounds where coming out of each tavern and from each marketplace. Standing on the outskirts of the forest, they saw a huge tentcamp in front of the gates. Apparently, the tournament whas held outside the walls. What wasn't that strange, since the vast number of tents wouldn't fit into any of the marketplaces they could see from their vantage point. 
<br>
<br>
Makeshift stables where gathered at their right side, almost all filled with strong beautifull horses. Stableboys where running around like ants, bringing buckets of water, hay , saddles and halters to the horses.
<br>
Small horses, like shetlanders where gathered at their leftside, giving rides to small children. much to their enjoyment. Sheers came from their mouths while the horses trotted further.
<br>
The centerpiece was the arena. A long wooden pallisade in the middle of a sandy place. Here they held their tournament; both boys thought.
<br>
I 'm curious when they will start, aren't you?; Matthew said. I always wanted to see this, or rather wanted to do this. Come on,let's see if we can find out when they start.
<br>
Along they went. Between they tents that housed the contestants. Artistswere performing their stunts, breathing fire, walking on their hands, often supprising both of them.
<br>
The tents, neatly lined up, where almost all accompanied by a small flagpole in front of them. On them where many different shields, symbolising the family or &quot;house&quot; that occupied them. 
<br>
Warfare equipment was often decorating the entrances of the tents. Many spears and swords stand next to shields and armor. Also decorated with the symbols of the owner.
<br>
<br>
Excuse me, sir? Matthew said to a man wearing a full body armor,&quot; can you tell me when the tournament will start?
<br>
The man, being a gaurd from the castle looked up from its conversation with a fruitvending girl, answered: ofcourse i can. It will begin soon. Only some contestants need their horses to be saddled and then it will start. There will be performing stuntriders doing incredible acts while riding on horseback, then some demonstations by squires, followed by performers demonstating their riding skills, the child devisions and the adult devissions.
<br>
&quot;child devissions?&quot;, both replied.&quot; &quot;Yes, teenagers that go through their initiationrites to become a squire. If you wan tto see them training, go to the Eastern side of the camp. Their traininggrounds are located there.
<br>
&quot;Cool, thanks sir.&quot; and both of them ran of in that direction.
<br>
&quot;Cool? It isn't that cold. Strange boys! &quot;, he muttered.
<br>
<br>
Long before the boys arrived, they could hear the sound of weapons clinging against eachother. Teenage boys, from a near 8 years to 16 years and a few elderlings, were practicing swordtechneques, training their muscles with weights, all of them soaked in sweat.
<br>
<br>
Both of them looked at all the action for quiet some time. They were so focused on all the action, that they didn't see one of the boys
<br>
coming up behind them. It was a wellbuild 14-year old wearing a chainlink coat of mail, covered by a cloth bearing a symbol of a horse.
<br>
&quot;Hi, I'm Harold, Harold Underling&quot;, he said with a stong voice, starttling both boys.
<br>
&quot;What the ....&quot;, shouted Matthew, when he jumped around facing the imposing boy.
<br>
&quot;Eh, hi, ..ehh... H..Harold.&quot; he stuttered, looking at the musscles.
<br>
&quot;Don't be afraid, i will do you no harm.&quot;he said&quot;. &quot;Hey, i see that you are looking at the training. Want to join in? Maybe you are naturals.&quot;
<br>
He turned and gestured at a tent baering the same symbol.
<br>
&quot;That's my tent, it houses my supplies and functions as my temporal home for the duration of the tournament.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Come in, if you are willing to join the training.&quot;, he repeated.
<br>
&quot;Ehh.., sure, but we don't have any equipment with us&quot;
<br>
&quot;That's no problem. I have spares. I can borrow you some.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Sound great. We're in.&quot;
<br>
&quot;We're in?&quot;, harold replied. &quot;we are outside the tent. You both sure have a strange language. But come in. then we 'll see what we have in store for both of you.&quot;
<br>
<br>
Both boys followed harold inside the tent. bed and clothing on the left, weapons on the right the tent was litterly filled to the top with stuff.
<br>
&quot;let see. Your old clothes, remove them&quot;, he adviced.&quot; they are no good against swordblows. They will not hold any protection.&quot;
<br>
He opened two crates, both embedded with a horses head, and holds up several pieces of tunics in front of him for inspection.
<br>
&quot;This will do for you.&quot;;Harold said while handing over a dark green tunic to Matthew.&quot; Eh.., I didn't catch your name yet, friend.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Matthew&quot;, Matthew replied.
<br>
&quot;Just Matthew?&quot;, Harold let out with a small supprise. &quot;No last name?&quot;
<br>
&quot;Sorry. Woods. that's my last name.&quot;
<br>
&quot;I'm Gideon Van Sande&quot;, said Matthew's friend.
<br>
&quot;Right. OK, then. This green one is for you, Matthew. And this gray one looks like it will accomodate you. Gideon.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Woods and Van Sande. Never heard those name among my fiends. Are you from the area?&quot;
<br>
&quot;No, we are from outside&quot;, said Matthew.
<br>
<br>
&quot;Take of your cloths. The tunics won't fit otherwise. Over that comes the coat of mail and over that comes the symbol of the house.&quot;
<br>
Both of them looked around, finding no room to change cloths.
<br>
&quot;Where can we chance clothes, Harold?&quot;
<br>
&quot;Here ofcourse, there is noone who can see you, so go ahead.&quot;
<br>
they looked at eachother, swallowed and hessitatingly began taking of their clothes. Soon they were dressed like squires.
<br>
&quot;Here are matching helmets.&quot; , Harold said and simuntaniously tossing them to the boys.
<br>
After some minor adjustments, they were both wearing a helmet.
<br>
Helmets covering there cranums, cheeks and back of their necks.
<br>
<br>
&quot;Come&quot;. A gesture from Harold to the back of the tent catches their eyes upon a dummy. &quot;help me bring him outside&quot;
<br>
All three of them lifted the dummy and walked out of the tent. But not trough the front. They went trough the back. To an enclosed area set of with poles and curtains.
<br>
&quot;Here are two practice swords. I took the lightest i could find because it is your first time.&quot;
<br>
He held two sheathed swords in front of him.
<br>
Both boys took hold of the handles almost at the same moment and slowly pulled the swords out of the sheaths, accompanied with a scraping resonating sound of steel against steel.
<br>
They were somewhat heavy but not too clumsy to hold.
<br>
After some instructions from Harold and some wooden training shields, swords rose above the boys and soon they were engaged in a feirce mockfight.
<br>
<br>
After several houres, all of them called it a good idea to stop.
<br>
It was fun, especially when they feld confident to take on Harold.
<br>
Both of them have bitten into the dust many times, Harold could manage them fairly well, but found himself supprised on several occasions to the shier force Gideon ans Matthew could munster in thier blows.
<br>
&quot;I could use a bath right now; W're smelly.&quot;: Gideon remarked.
<br>
&quot;We could use the river for that. It is deep enough and clean.&quot;
<br>
hearing Harold they both jumped up.&quot;Let's go&quot;:yelled Matthew, and ran of.
<br>
&quot;Wait for me!&quot;: yelled Gideon and he to started running.
<br>
&quot;Don't go into the water with those armors, they will rust and are valuable&quot;: Yelled harold as he pursued the boys.
<br>
<br>
At the river, they stripped of their clothing and ran naked into the water, not bothered anymore by the presence of eachother.
<br>
<br>
After the refreshment, Harold gave them a tour through the village and the camp, presenting them before several of his friends.
<br>
<br>
One tent cought the eye of Gideon. It stood somewhat seperatly from the rest and was represented by dark colors.
<br>
Two black shields featuring a charging boar marked the entrance.
<br>
<br>
&quot;That's the tent of Gregory of Darkwood. You'd better avoid him. It's a rough person with a bad temper.&quot;: said Harold.
<br>
<br>
&quot;Come, let's go to the arena. It's time to attend the opening&quot;.
<br>
<br>
They went between the tents towards the arena. Most, if not all activity between the tents was gone. Only a few guards remained.
<br>
<br>
Suddenly, they hearded the clinging of swords, but it wasn't coming from the arena. 
<br>
&quot;help, somebody,... help me.&quot;, an unknown voice yelled.
<br>
Harold started running, followed by Matthew and Gideon, a bit scared, towards the source of the turmoil.
<br>
They saw two dark figures standing over a motionless third one.
<br>
&quot;He has had it!&quot;, the biggest one said.
<br>
&quot;I have the scrolls&quot;, the smallest replied.
<br>
&quot;What's going on here?&quot;: Harold shouted.
<br>
&quot;Huh, who's there?&quot;: both shouted while turning towards the source of the sound. With them facing the three boys the markings of a boar on their chest became visable.
<br>
&quot;Damn, snoopers. three of them.&quot;, the big guy remaked.
<br>
&quot;That's Harold Underling. If he get's away he 'll alarm the whole camp. He has great influence.&quot; the small one noted.
<br>
&quot;I'll take him. He is no match for me. You take care of those other two.&quot;, said the big guy.
<br>
Harold jumped forwards, drawing his sword.
<br>
&quot;Take the other one!&quot;, he shouted,&quot; you can match him. It's Ivan, one of Gregory's henchman and a lousy swordsman. come on. I need both of you to hold him of&quot;
<br>
&quot;What??? You're kidding!&quot;, Matthew yelled. But before he could hear an answer, a swordblow hit him at his side, knocking him of his feeth.
<br>
Gideon, having time to draw his sword parried a few swings, much to the dislike of Ivan.
<br>
A fierce fight began, until a piece of wood, trown towards Harold and dodged by him, hit Gideon at the back of his head, knocking him unconsious.
<br>
&quot;Gideon???!&quot;, both Harold and Matthew yelled.
<br>
But It was too late. 
<br>
Ivan saw his chance and knocked the handle of his sword into the face of Matthew. Then he charged at Harold forcing him to turn his back to the other guy. A fatal mistake it proved to be. A quick swing of the sword onto his schoulder disabled him for battle.
<br>
<br>
<br>
They were roughly awakened with buckets of water, finding themselves tied up inside a tent. Allthough it was rather dark, they could make out a symbol onto the big chair that was standing in the middle of the room. It was a boar. Matthews and Gideons face went pale uncertain what would follow.
<br>
Suddenly a giant came into the tent. It was Gregory of Darkwood. And with his face covered with his helmet, it was clear that he wasn't pleased.
<br>
&quot;So, you interfered with my plans. I don't like troublemakers.&quot;, he said, while walking towards his chair.
<br>
&quot;You understand that i can not let you go, but what should i do with all of you?&quot;
<br>
<br>
A lengthy pause.
<br>
<br>
&quot;I know what! Call Zodis. and Herman. Let him bring three set.&quot;
<br>
After a while, a small figure came in trough the back. A smell of chemicals accompanied him.
<br>
He reached down and grabbed Harold in his neck, while giving a signal to two guards at the entrance.
<br>
&quot;Zodis, Show them your power!&quot;.
<br>
Zodis was already rumbling with flasks way before gregory gave him an order.He turned towards the three boys with a vile of green flouricensing fluid.
<br>
&quot;Hold their mouths open&quot;, he ordered with an short sharp tone.
<br>
Gregory grabbed the hair of Harold and jerked his head backwards.
<br>
Siezing the opporunity, Zodis poured some of the liquid into his mouth and did the same with both of the other boys.</p>
