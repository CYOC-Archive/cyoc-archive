<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Pete woke up feeling refreshed, relaxed and rested. As he lay there in bed, looking up at the ceiling, he recalled what the voices had told him in his dream the previous night. He was satisfied and felt good inside about what he remembered he&#39;d been told and how the voice had given him extra powers - to control the speed, rate  and way in which he could transform himself - and he resolved that he would test out these new powers this very day. He wondered how he could transform himself in different ways with just his thoughts, but like when he changed into a Komodo Dragon, he was sure that once he&#39;d initiated the process, his body would respond appropriately.<br />
So, what was it to be?<br />
Pete threw off his bedclothes and lay there naked. Closing his eyes, he thought &quot;Golden Retriever dog, now!&quot;<br />
As quick as that thought had passed through his head, involuntarily he turned over, went on his hands and knees and instantaneously became a Golden Retriever dog! Suddenly his senses were bombarded by a million odours surrounding him each one making him feel immensely happy. Pete wagged his tail with glee as he jumped off the bed, nosed his way through the half-open door and bounded downstairs.<br />
As in his doggy form he could not open the locked doors downstairs, he paused a while and thought to himself &quot;Back to normal, now!&quot;<br />
In an instant, there he was, on all fours, a human once more!<br />
&quot;This is fantastic! Pete exclaimed to himself &quot;The voices once again were correct.&quot;<br />
In his excitement, once he&#39;d open the kitchen door and the back door leading into the garden, Pete was ready to try again.<br />
&quot;If I change myself into some sort of bird&quot; Pete thought with some excitement&quot; I could fly over to the quarry and then try some other transformation. I&#39;d really like to try something big once I&#39;m out there!&quot;<br />
Pete decided that, as he might be out of the house for a while, he&#39;d have something to eat and drink before he flew out to the quarry. He could hardly keep his hands from trembling as he made a coffee and poured out some cornflakes into a bowl. He could hardly keep the spoon still as he ate his cornflakes! He tried his best though and eventually managed to eat and drink without upsetting too much on the counter. Carelessly, he dropped his mug and his bowl into some hot soapy water to soak and then walked towards the back door which led into the garden.<br />
Pete wanted to get to the quarry as quickly as possible, so he worked out that he needed to change into a bird which could fly quickly, had a great sense of direction.<br />
&quot;But I think this&#39;ll be a slow change&quot; Pete whispered to himself, hardly being able to contain his sense of anticipation &quot;so that I can feel every transformation as it happens and be in control. I know, I&#39;ll change into a racing pigeon. Fast enough to get there quickly and a bird which has a great sense of direction!&quot;<br />
Standing naked, facing outside, Pete closed his eyes and thought &quot;Racing Pigeon, stage by stage.&quot; Opening his eyes, he then waited for a reaction to his thought.<br />
At first nothing happened. After a few moments though, Pete began to feel the sensation of trying to push out from the whole of his body except his lower legs, the front of his face and  the top of his head. He stopped breathing for a momentarily and pushed with all his might. As he did so, he saw that feathers were starting to extrude from all over his body. Then, he had the urge to suck in and as he did so, the hair on his head went into his skull and then the pressure built up again to push out and out came feathers on his head. Finally, the urge to suck in took over and his ears, nose, cock and balls, and fingers disappeared into his body. The transformation then stopped.<br />
&quot;That was cool&quot; Pete exclaimed &quot;Lets go on!&quot;<br />
As soon as he&#39;d said it the transformation continued. This sensation was quite weird and made Pete feel a little nauseous as it happened. The room began to appear to get bigger, though after a few seconds, Pete realised that it was actually him getting smaller. His whole form shrank down to about a foot tall. As it did so, Pete could feel that familiar sensation of crunching bone as his size diminished and once again, everything stopped.<br />
&quot;That was certainly a strange sensation!&quot; Pete&#39;s voice was now very high in pitch and rather squeaky which somewhat surprised him. &quot;I wonder what&#39;s next?&quot;<br />
As quick as thought things this time began to get really crazy. Pete&#39;s lips fused together. He felt the skin of his face hardening and then the familiar urge to push out. As he did so, in place of his nose and mouth a hard beak formed which prevented him from speaking any further. As his hands disappeared into the base of his arms, his arms began to twist backwards with that crunching and grinding sensation which always accompanied these changes. When the change was complete, Pete now had wings. Then finally, his legs began to change. His height further diminished as his legs got shorter and thinner and as they did so, his feet began to rearrange themselves into claws and talons and the skin on his legs began to get tighter and swarthy. What Pete couldn&#39;t see was that as he got smaller, the size of the feathers on his body remained the same, so by the time the transformation was ended, he was covered with the right density of feathers. The transformation was complete - Pete was now a racing pigeon and he was ready to hop out of the back door, into the garden and then to fly to the quarry. Just before he did so, he unfurled his wings and ruffled his feathers. With a coo of extreme satisfaction and apprehensive excitement, he flapped his wings, rose into the air and was flying at great speed towards the quarry</p>
