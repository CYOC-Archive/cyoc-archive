<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Instincts, being a jackass, having become a young sexually active verile male Jack all caught Mr. Fran off guard. <br />
<br />
Upper lip curled and head raised high he sniffed the wafting breeze for the scent of donkeys. <br />
<br />
Tail wisking over a butt that had gotten used to wearing trousers, now stood open wide and naked to the night air. He like any Jackass was alos naked and this coupled with his giant increase in hormones or maybe pheremones had a learned man thinking with his balls.<br />
<br />
Off on a gallop he went looking for what his balls said was the way of life for him!<br />
<br />
Zig zagging about he came to a hill top and eyed his smaller world.<br />
<br />
The barns and corrals around it gave him his first true Jackass erection. Like being enthralled with his sexual self and thinking he was the only male Jack there he pranced toward the barn.<br />
<br />
Suddenly his instinct ridden mind alerted of the scent of another male. Then he noted two, no four, no nine different scents and all male. He questioned if this were some male only farm but the scent of females was there, he could smell them to be sure.<br />
<br />
Like any outsider even in the company of humans he was not welcomed with open arms. Instead of what he thought he'd find there Mr. Fran the Jackass was met with jelousy and anger. Kicking and being bit by the other rampant males he was in a fight for the right to procreate and maybe even stay alive.<br />
<br />
Run from his attackers he found safety in the tree line to the far west side of the open pasture. There he licked his wounds and felt for the first time like a real animal abandoned to a rude and crude mean world.<br />
<br />
The sun had come up and he saw the donkey herd grazing contently. Feeling the urge to join in he walked out into the light of day and lowered his head to graze.<br />
<br />
&quot;What am I doing?&quot; his small remaining human part of a mind fully accepting the life and body of being a Jackass reminded him it was all for just forty eight hours.<br />
<br />
As his head popped up and became alert so also did the herd look up wondering what this oddball had seen.<br />
<br />
Reminded of his original experiment and what he did not know of the Tome, he knew it did change him and could have also done the same to his friend Doc.<br />
<br />
Walking to where he left his old car the Jackass part of his mind had him stopping often to graze in peaceful mindless contentment. As he came to that corner of the pasture he looked up on the internet, his thoughts were being more directed by the animal part of his mind.<br />
<br />
A truck stopped on the back road as two men looked at the old car and then at the lone Jackass. It wasn't long before the fence had been broken down and Mr. Fran was led to a waiting trailer. <br />
<br />
Part of him yelled warning, but the Jackass part sensed sweet alfala was inside the trailer. Walking into the trailer he found his Jackass' prize and lulled his human self asleep while munching a nice lunch.<br />
<br />
Lulled into a Jackass drunken stooper he paid no attention to what was occuring till the rank smell of death touched his big nose. Unloaded he was poked in the butt and made to walk inside a corral. Around him were dozens of fustrated and worried animals as they also knew the smell of death.<br />
<br />
Time to think he looked about seeing a sign and trying upon trying to remember how he knew to read. Bit by bit if he kept his mind on the sign and not the other animals sniffing at his maleness he was beginning to make some sense of the words.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fulbright Slaughter House&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Fran began to bray violently as this worked its way down into a degrade brain with some human learned knowledge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Slaughter!&quot; he knew that word meant death to animals and he realized quite vividly he was right then nothing more than meat on the hoof.<br />
<br />
Thinking about each hour as it passed and the sun got higher into the noon day sky, Mr. Fran was reminded that this was his second full day as a Jackass. He knew down deep that if he was not sent to slaughter he'd change to a human about 10:00 P.M.<br />
<br />
Pacing, worried, fretting to himself for being so foolish, a Jackass looked like he knew what was coming.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Carl, ya Carl, take the Donkey to corral six and load him into the truck!&quot; yelled out what seemed to be some a manager.<br />
<br />
A rope about his thick neck and Mr. Fran the Jackass was led past numbers of poor animals on their way to doom. Loaded into a semi trailer he felt at least safe for the moment. It was a short sense of safety as the door opened again and in came more donkeys, and all of them female!<br />
<br />
Something inside him danced making his erection pop out full and nasty hard. He tried not to think with his balls but trying to think at all was getting impossible. The truck soon moved away from the loading dock and he was being noticed as the only male aboard.<br />
<br />
It was proper to say that none of the donkeys aboard that trailer liked the ride but the females seemed to show their worry by flirting with the young and verile male Jack.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I won't!&quot; thought Mr. Fran thinking of his wife and their long time relationship.<br />
<br />
Try as he might his real self was still that of a male donkey Jack. His sense of being was tied directly to his gender and that was for him a nagging erection. All tails being held high and to the side showing off each their wonderous delight had one very male Jack going plum nuts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hell, one won't hurt, heck I am a Jackass!&quot; thought Mr. Fran as he started to give in to his passions.<br />
<br />
The truck came soon to a stop as the driver and helper went into a restaurant. Now without the rocking motion of a moving vehicle under the many hoofs the orgy was ready to begin.<br />
<br />
Walking to the center of the trailer he stood and brayed out like a wild male donkey lusting for to mate. Around him stood many a furry rump with tails all held high and vulva on each winking as only they can do.<br />
<br />
Straddled forelegs over one rounded and friendly rump, he worked his self ahead to feeling the tip of one's male part touch the quivering sex of a female donkey.<br />
<br />
Now things happened fast and one enthralled Jack was busy with one after another and another. It was when the truck lurched forward that Mr. Fran fell from a tickled female and found himself beginning to change back.</p>
