<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Eric...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Henry, I know how you must be feeling right now, but I must protest before you attempt to make a move on my...admittedly outstanding muscled ass.&quot; Eric glanced at the two of them and admittedly, he couldn&#39;t really blame Henry for getting pretty turned on. He himself was feeling it every bit as intensely. You don&#39;t just grow all this muscle, tan up, and look fucking astonishing out of the blue every day - and it was radiantly clear that suddenly becoming sexy was having a loud and clear effect on Henry&#39;s libido.<br />
<br />
Honestly, Eric was inclined to try and get some clothes on. It would result in less temptation to act on his imminent horniness, and it would get them ready to go outside. No matter how rippling they were now, they could not well step outside in just heavily strained underwear.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon Eric...&quot; Henry groaned and grit his teeth. He knew he was straight, but at the same time, he was just so desperately horny. Whatever just happened to them was overwhelming in its intensity - and as Henry reckoned with the thick aroused manhood in his boxers, taking up so much room, he tried to exercise control...<br />
<br />
&quot;Henry, I want you to know...&quot; Eric stated, &quot;I am every bit as <i>fucking horny</i> as you are. I&#39;d love nothing more than to bust a load as soon as possible...but we need to---to do so with purpose. With drive. With our pasts and futures in mind. Merely nutting in one another won&#39;t change our lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re really...tryin&#39; to philosophize right now...?&quot; Henry asked, though by now he was starting to get it under control.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just know what&#39;ll get through to you,&quot; Eric said with a sly grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know me too well.&quot; A shrug and Henry nodded, before taking a seat, &quot;So, how are we gonna deal with this. You can&#39;t seriously suggest we just go no nut. So what&#39;re we doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you know,&quot; Eric said as he got up, stretching and looking for some new clothes, finding in the process some oversized clothes he&#39;d gotten for a theatre role last semester - modern, but oversized due to the specificity of the role, &quot;The ladies around here are quite amenable to helping out. And this is the time of year when the parties and drinking really get revved up. Now, I happen to be tutoring Lance Wayfield, the runningback of the school football team. Through him, I&#39;ve managed to learn---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get...to...the...point...&quot; Henry moaned as he grabbed another pair of the same clothes tossed his way by Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well alright if you&#39;ve got no patience for my theatrics...&quot; Eric sighed, &quot;Lance told me all about the parties and where all the most debauched and drink-suffused ones are being held. Suffice to say, I don&#39;t think the partiers will mind a couple extra jocks showing up.&quot; He grinned and gestured at himself and Henry.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we can get laid there!?&quot; Henry was up in seconds, grinning and eager.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes...&quot; Eric nodded, pacing back and forth, eagerly anticipating what was to come himself, &quot;But first I think we need more fitting clothes. We can use these as stopgaps, but we&#39;re not going to a fucking  college party dressed in theatre clothes.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We buyin&#39; jock clothes?&quot; Henry asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re buying jock clothes.&quot; Eric grabbed his wallet, keys and phone, and started moving to the door. Suffice to say, after today, the impression of Eric and Henry would be vastly and deservedly different. Much as he presented himself as the theatric and mature one, Eric was himself very eagerly thinking - a licentious grin on his face - of the sex that was to come. The babes that were going to be all over him.<br />
<br />
And hey, maybe they could have some more lattes before the end of the day for luck.<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
By the time Eric and Henry were ready for their first party, they hardly resembled the nerds they started that day as;<br />
<br />
Eric had dressed in a baseball cap, a tight gray stringer shirt that showed off just about everything on his back, chest, and arms, a pair of tight workout pants, and a new pair of shoes that were from a substantially sportier brand. He walked with a new swagger that betrayed the sheer ego boost he got out of the newly grown musculature granted to him by MTX. His pronounced chest forward walk only accentuated his musculature, and he noticed as they walked out of the mall that he got a significant amount of attention from the ladies...and also from dudes. Always a compliment, he told himself.<br />
<br />
Henry on the other hand had dressed in a tight blue and white polo shirt that hugged his chest tightly, the short sleeves pulled taut, his shirt tucked in at the front and only further exaggerating his muscles. You could even almost see his abs right through his shirt. He wore a half buttoned up denim jacket over that, a big set of black jeans, and sleek black trainers. He stood behind Eric, noting as he did that his jeans-clad ass seemed to invite quite a few glances from the female population there. <br />
<br />
Nobody could have guessed these two newly minted bros were once small, shy nerds.<br />
<br />
And both of them were keen to keep that in mind. As they went back out to Eric&#39;s car to deposit their theatre clothes and start heading off toward their first party of the evening, Eric contemplated where indeed they might go for some fun. He checked the schedule via texting Lance. He got a text back surprisingly quickly explaining there were about three ongoing parties currently. Though Lance seemed a little surprised the duo were going to be stepping out into the social scene like that.<br />
<br />
He really had no idea how different those two were going to be.<br />
<br />
The first party was held by the football team&#39;s quarterback, Devon McDonald, a powerfully muscled football hero and a relaxed, at ease sort of guy. Devon had established a stable relationship with his girlfriend Callie Keller, one of the cheersquad girls. Supposedly it was being held at an off campus house that Devon owned. It was coincidentally just three blocks down from the coffee place.<br />
<br />
The next party was held by Lance himself - and was on campus at the dorm starting later in the day. Lance usually had thrumming parties and with a bit more irresponsible party games going on. Though he usually ended up having to clean them up.<br />
<br />
The last party of the day would be held by Gabe Corcoran, the local troubled rich pretty boy at his apartment. His parents were real estate tycoons, and Gabe got a whole property so long as he didn&#39;t irreversibly devastate it. His would be the latest in the day and the longest wait, thus the toughest sell to Eric. Though Gabe&#39;s party promised to be pretty interesting.<br />
<br />
Eric and Henry contemplated before deciding...</p>
