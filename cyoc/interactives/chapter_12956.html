<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been two weeks since Pete had become a Speedo Fag.<br />
<br />
For the most part of their nights, the men all wandered into the forest to transform into their homosexual counterparts, for whilst they did like pleasing themselves with each other, they felt it necessary to remain secretive and as far from the general public as possible for their own safety. Ironically, Pete seemed to be the most disappointed at this; he craved the feeling of a hidden clan, struggling against the odds and slowly turning others into what they were. Admittedly, the first morning after his initial transformation had left him extremely terrified, but by the time his briefs changed to that good ol' fashioned red Speedo that evening, he transitioned completely in his mindset. As for the actual events that took place each night, well, essentially it was just the seven of them having sex amongst the trees on top of the soft grass. Come morning, they'd all set off for their homes and jobs after changing clothes. However, through all of these events, one person was being neglected; Tom's son, Ben.<br />
<br />
For what seemed like the millionth time, Ben was sitting on the grass oval next to the high school, eating the crappy cheese-on-bread sandwiches he'd been having ever since his dad began to frequently disappear at night. Luke, one of Ben's friends, was sitting next to Ben, picking at shreds of lettuce in his own sandwich with his dark fingers. Ben sighed, watching a green lettuce leaf flick through the air and land several feet away on the grass.<br />
&quot;You still got them shit lunches?&quot; Luke grinned, dumping more lettuce onto the grass next to him.<br />
&quot;Dad's never been out past morning so many days in a row,&quot; Ben told Luke. &quot;And I'm always late gettin' up, so all I can manage in five minutes is a wedge of &quot;plastic cheese&quot; in bread.&quot;<br />
&quot;Where's he goin' every night?&quot; Luke asked.<br />
&quot;Dunno. I asked him like two weeks ago right, and he kinda went red and wouldn't answer. Changed the subject to what we were having for dinner; and guess what, he wasn't there for that either,&quot; Ben replied with a note of annoyance in his voice.<br />
&quot;Maybe he's, like, an undercover drug dealer or somethin'. You know, the whole cop thing is just a front for his dealin's,&quot; Luke suggested jokingly, smiling up at Ben from beneath his dark face. Ben laughed, punching Luke on the arm roughly.<br />
&quot;I really would like to know where he is ACTUALLY going...&quot; Ben mumbled suddenly, staring wistfully out at the empty street.<br />
&quot;Well, why don't you just follow him?&quot; Luke asked. <br />
&quot;Hey! That's not a bad idea...Wherever he is going, he's walking there, because the car's always in the drive way in the mornings. I'll follow him tonight then,&quot; Ben announced as the school bell rang, signalling the end of lunch time.<br />
<br />
At seven o'clock, Ben heard his dad close the front door quietly from his bedroom. Counting to ten, Ben got off his bed and walked to the front door. Spying through the window, Ben saw Tom looking around nervously, and seconds later, Tom dashed off in a sprint. Ben hurriedly opened the door and slammed it shut behind him and ran after his dad. A few minutes later, Ben had followed Tom to the forest, keeping at a safe distance behind him. Tom shot a look over his shoulder before heading into the woods, Ben managing to conceal himself behind a nearby bush. It was growing dark now. Shadows were creeping along the ground, stretching into the smothered darkness of the trees. <br />
Gulping, Ben followed the beaten track his dad had just walked down.<br />
<br />
A few hundred feet down the dirt path, Ben could hear a collection of male voices nearby through the darkness, mostly unrecognisable, except for one which Ben noted was his father's. Ben paused, he wanted to get closer, but not so close that they'd be able to see him. Looking around, an idea came to Ben. The trees...he'd be able to climb across the branches of one and still be well hidden by the leaves. Plus, they wouldn't think of looking for him there. As quietly as possible, Ben scaled the nearest tree and slid out across the branch hanging over the congregation of men. Ben could see his dad and the other guys better now. They were talking to each other in low voices, occasionally laughing at what they were saying. Ben edged further across the branch, the wood creaking slightly under his weight. The men had stopped speaking. Ben strained his ears and heard his dad's voice.<br />
&quot;Well, the sun just went down...we'd better hurry up,&quot; Tom's voice sounded. Ben peeked his head over the branch and saw his dad tugging off his jacket. The other men also began to discard clothing, some going for shoes and socks, others taking off their shirts. Ben noticed that his dad seemed to be the most well built of the group, without a beer gut and having a slightly defined set of abs visible in the semi -darkness. The others varied between large and flat chested with clumps of tangled hair protruding from some. Shortly, they were all down to their pants and shorts. Ben was completely bewildered at this sight, noticing one of the other guys pointing out the nearing nightfall loudly, making all of them rush to remove their clothing. Ben watched his dad hop across the grassy forest floor, his jeans sliding off one leg and caught on the other. As Tom finally freed the other leg with a laugh, he and the others collected their own clothing and placed them into neat piles. They then stood up and admired each other in their briefs. Ben had come to a conclusion he didn't like; his dad was gay...maybe that was why his mum had left them. How could his dad be gay? In the midst of his thoughts, Ben lost concentration and slid off the branch, his legs dangling in mid air several feet above the heads of the men. Luckily for Ben, they were too pre occupied with themselves. Ben looked down nervously, his legs flailing to grasp back onto the branch. Then, he heard a howling.<br />
<br />
Ben scrambled desperately back onto the branch, the tree shaking softly as he swung back up. He was panting heavily, there was a wolf or something out there. Ben wondered why the men and his dad didn’t flee or anything, but a second later when he saw that it was the men who were howling made him feel even more scared. Suddenly, Ben noticed something through the shadows; like film speeding up, all of the men began developing sets of abs and biceps to match that of a body builder. Ben noticed his father didn’t change especially much, although his hair did turn blonde-ish. Then, Ben did notice something exceptionally strange about all of them; the underwear they had been wearing only moments before had been replaced with tight red Speedos. Ben leant over the branch to get a better look, and a moment later, he realized what a horrible mistake that was. The branch dipped heavily; it couldn’t take his weight any more. Ben sat upright and began edging backward as quickly and quietly as possible. He could hear growls and moans below. Ben didn’t want to look. He closed his eyes and imagined himself home and wished that this was all just some dream. The defeated creaking of the branch snapped him back to reality, along with the branch itself.<br />
<br />
Ben fell amidst the Speedo Fags in a crumpled heap. The men snarled slightly at him and sniffed strangely at his body. <br />
&quot;D-Dad...?&quot; Ben mumbled, desperately searching for his father to help  him out of this mess. He spotted the younger, more handsome face that must have been his dad amongst the others.<br />
&quot;Dad...!&quot; Ben gasped, reaching out his hands towards Tom, to pull him in closer and defend his son, but Tom shoved the hand away roughly with a growl.<br />
&quot;It's me, Ben,&quot; he said to Tom. Tom blinked a few times, as if recalling a dim memory. Ben reached out and placed his hand on Tom's shoulder. Ben realised that Tom's muscles were lightly coated in a glistening sweat-like substance. Wincing, he wiped his hand over his face to sweep away his own sweat.<br />
&quot;Your son,&quot; Ben finished. Tom sat down on the dirt and began to rub his penis in thought through the Speedo. The other Speedo men all stood back and leant in closer to Tom, as if they were discussing something in a low hushed tone. Ben thought he heard his dad mentioning his name a few times, but before he could actually hear the gist of what they were saying, they spun around and began to crawl around him in a circle. <br />
&quot;What's...what's wrong with you?&quot; Ben asked, his voice shaking. The Speedo men laughed at this, but Tom silenced them suddenly. He grunted a few times to Ben, pointing at his Speedo, then at Ben.<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Ben asked confusedly. His dad pointed at his Speedo, then at Ben. He then moved next to Ben, leaning across Ben's semi-developed chest and mimed biting his neck. He then leant back to see if Ben understood.<br />
&quot;You-you want to bite me?&quot; Ben asked. Tom nodded, grunting happily that he had managed to convey the message.<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Ben pretended to think as the men leant in closer to hear his reply. He was really confused as to what was going on, and he felt now he probably should have just left his dad to it.<br />
&quot;HELL NO!&quot; Ben shouted, springing from his spot on the ground. He managed to force through a gap, knocking down his dad who grasped frantically at his stumbling feet. Ben danced wildly out of his reach and sprinted straight ahead, not knowing where he was heading; just running for his own survival. <br />
<br />
After what seemed like an hour of running, Ben stumbled to a stop and fell against a tree in exhaustion. He must've been running the wrong way; towards the beach, rather than the town. Now he was drenched in sweat and he felt like he was about to pass out. He couldn't see anyone chasing him. In pure relief, Ben slid down the tree and collapsed onto the soft grass. This HAD to be some nightmare. A thought penertrated through his mind that he couldn't say aloud:<br />
Ben felt...attracted, sorta, to the men in their speedos. <br />
&quot;No,&quot; Ben said aloud, and thought back to the female porn he had downloaded during the last few years and had masturbated over. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, his penis felt hard. Ben couldn't resist it, he'd have to give in. He slowly undid the fly on his jeans and pried them open. Then, he carefully lowered the waist band of his red boxer shorts to reveal his penis. Ben quickly checked around; he was alone. Then, he placed his hand on his shaft and slowly began to pump his penis. His hand was sweaty, so Ben had a little trouble gripping at first, but soon he was lost in the pleasure. He was seconds away from cumming. He could feel it rushing through his balls and up his penis. He thought back to the magazines he had stashed beneath his bed...A muscular woman wearing a red bikini...His thoughts played back in and out to his dad and the other Speedo men, muscular...drenched in sweat...red Speedo...Ben shot a look down at his penis moments before he ejaculated and noticed a glistening liquid sitting around his tip and hand. He attempted to stop in his horrified state of the strange substance, but it was too late. He came over his hand; a lot more than he usually did, Ben noticed. He swung his hand about, flinging the white goo off his fingers into the night air. Then, Ben frantically wiped his fingers against the grass to clean them. After his fingers were relatively dry, he examined them again under the moonlight. They were still glistening, but it was the same sweaty substance he had on his hand before he came. Then he realised something; his dad had had the same substance on his skin. Ben remember wiping it off his hand onto his face...<br />
<br />
Ben looked down worriedly at his cock, the entire shaft was glistening as if it had been soaked in cum. The sweat liquid spread down Ben's penis and went across his boxer shorts, as if he had been working out for ages and was sweating heavily. However, it seemed to be contained entirely around the crotch. He looked at the hand he had touched his dad with; his entire right arm was glistening. It seemed larger, as if he had developed muscles like those swim team members at his school had without even realising it. Ben paused for a moment, and then flexed for himself; admittedly, he felt a little aroused by himself. The shiny liquid suddenly went up his arm and beneath his t-shirt, unlike his boxer shorts which now seemed to be covered in the same liquid. His shirt seemed to be partially dry, but his boxer shorts now felt as if they had been dunked in cum, or something. Ben's erection suddenly sprang back into action. <br />
&quot;Oh man...&quot; Ben moaned, half in fear, half in excitement as he lowered his muscular hand to continue masturbating, seemingly against his freewill. Within seconds of starting, he felt like he was covered in the sweat. His shirt felt uncomfortable, sticking to his skin tightly. Ben felt feverish. He slid down his jeans with one hand and continued jacking off with the other. His boxer shorts felt tighter too; but they weren't uncomfortable, even if they were damp. <br />
<br />
Ben used his free hand to tuck the legs of his boxer shorts closer towards his ass and crotch, and to his partial surprise, they didn't slide back down his muscular thigh when he let go of them. They seemed to have fashioned themselves into a pair of silky red briefs. Ben began to sweat even more, pumping his penis roughly. His hand played against his shirt, his whole body tingling, his chest muscles tightening powerfully. Ben started to adjust the neck of his shirt to give him some air, but a sudden burst of energy made his thrust the shirt apart, tearing the flimsy material off his hardened chest. He looked like his father now, except for the absence of a red...<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Ben thought, looking down at the newly formed red Speedo sitting tightly around his thighs. <br />
&quot;I have a red Speedo...&quot; Ben said, thinking of his dad's own penis as he finished masturbating, the cum dripping over his abs. Ben tucked his still hard penis into his Speedo, the soft spandex absorbing the string of cum leading down his chest. Ben stumbled awkwardly with the newly developed body he had and sniffed at the air, licking his lips at the scent of men filling his nostrils. Smiling, Ben felt his growing erection once more pushing at his Speedo. He could get used to this, Ben thought.</p>
