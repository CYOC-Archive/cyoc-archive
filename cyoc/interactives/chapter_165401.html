<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Minor edit, again</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The suits all looked the same, their colour was the only thing that seperated them from each other, you wanted a bit more diversity to choose from but the costumes were all odd looking. You gazed among the suits, then you noticed a suit that was different from the others, one that didn&#39;t have the oversized zipper and no high-heels, instead had some sorts of light boots attached to the legs, it also consisted of two colours, or more like two shades of grey, with the primary being a lighter dark-grey while the secondary palette was of dark-grey although there was also some small bits of black on the suits as well, most notably was the collar and up, consisting of purely black material.<br />
<br />
Taking it off it&#39;s hanger, you took a better look at it, it was a skin-tight suit which covered everything but the upper parts of the head, the collar reaching up and spreading into a sort of rim that would covered the underside of your jaw and cover a quarter of your cheeks, the rim edging backwards to rim the rest of your head, but would leave your hair uncovered, the dark gray parts of the suits were felt thicker and more rigid, like plates than the lighter dark-grey that covered the rest of the suit,parts of the suit which were covered by the darker-grey were your hips and by extension, upper part of your thighs along with a little bit of your waist, the part which would cover your holes, feet, arms, your spine and shoulderblades and then your knees, the collar and up left out. You also noticed that the suit had a glowing orange light on it&#39;s shoulders.<br />
<br />
Looking for a way to access the suits inside you looked around it, noticing an exposed seam on the suits spine and reaching to the top of the suits collar. You easily opened the seam and were greeted with the suits inside, consisting of a purely grey surface of unknown material, you noted how there was a black pattern looking almost like circuitry spread across the inside of the suit, you reasoned that it might be for some of the suits functions maybe if it had some. Slightly confident in that the suit didn&#39;t look too wierd or awkward you sat the suit down and folded it so you had ease of access to the suits legs. Then you lifted you right leg and guided it down the suits right leg, gently sliding down past the suits material, noting how it didn&#39;t feel especially skin-tight as your foot nestled into the thinner-than-normal (By human standards) boots. <br />
<br />
Next was your left leg and you calmly rose it and slid it gently into the suits left boot, then you lifted the suit and put your arms into the suits ones, gripping experimentaly with your gloved hands, noting the looseness of the suit, especially over your chest, you looked around on the suit some more, looking for a way to adjust it, then you remembered that you hadn&#39;t sealed it when you looked at your back, your eyes barely seeing the loose lips of the suits seal, you attempted to close it up, but it refused to stick together. &#39;Maybe it needs two people to seal?&#39; You think, you weren&#39;t going to try on the lizards other wierd suits without seeing if you could get this less awkward one a try. You try to think up a solution and end up on seeing if the lizard could help you get this suit adjusted, probably a bad idea but it was also the best you had.<br />
<br />
So out of the changing room you walked, being careful so you didn&#39;t trip in the loose suit or have it fall off somehow, and after a few minutes or so of awkwardily walking in a too-loose suit you found the lizard in the cockpit, she was sitting in the chair and turned around upon hearing the automat door open. &#39;&#39;Uh, I wondered if you could adjust this suit, it&#39;s a bit too loose and i can&#39;t get it to seal up.&#39;&#39; You asked her, her scaled eyebrow rising in curiosity. &#39;&#39;Hm, well okay, I-...&#39;&#39; She started before her eyes gazed away, a thoughtful look on her scaled head, before you could see a small grin on her face that quickly disappeared, a shiver going down your spine as you slightly feared whatever kind of trickery she was formulating.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;W-what is it?&#39;&#39; You ask, hoping she didn&#39;t lie (she would of course), she merely looked back and smiled. &#39;&#39;Nothing special, just wondered where i sat my sealing tool and remembered i sat it in the cargo bay, then I remembered a funny memory i had in a similar cargo bay from when i was younger.&#39;&#39; She mused, you nervously smiled back and nodded, unsure if that was made up or not. &#39;&#39;Anyway, I&#39;ll need to find the tool to adjust your suit to your correct proportions, stay here in the meantime.&#39;&#39; She ordered as she walked past you and through the door which closed after her. You looked after her, sort of idling before shaking your head, focusing on the cockpit, looking out the observational windows at the quickly passing stars as streaks of colourful light flung past as well.<br />
<br />
You looked down at the control console which consisted of rows of buttons and screens showing all sorts of strings of symbols which beared absolutely no meaning to you, notable was the fact that there were what looked like holographic projections that showed different things, one of them showed a singular large arrow pointing forward, was it a compass possibly? You didn&#39;t know, then again it looked like map data wouldn&#39;t be useful when you seemed to move between star systems. Then you heard the door audibly open and you turned to see the Lizard walk in with a smal yelow rod that looked sort of like an auto injector. &#39;&#39;I&#39;ll need you to turn around please.&#39;&#39; She said with a calm smile, you looked skeptical at her, then the yellow rod in her grip before complying and turning around, exposing the open seam to her and giving access to your naked back. You looked back to try and see what she&#39;s doing and you see her calmly smiling back, you raise your eyebrow then a sharp pain in your back makes you flinch. <br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;Ow?&#39;&#39; You say as your rub the spot where the pain originated from, your eyes looking at the small yellow rod in the lizards back. &#39;&#39;What did you do?&#39;&#39; You ask. &#39;&#39;Just gave you a poke, take away your hand and i&#39;ll seal the suit up.&#39;&#39; She said calmly but with a wider smile, you were certain she was up to something now but you didn&#39;t know what so you took away your hand and halfly watched the lizard close the seam, sliding her hand up while sealing the seam like if there was an invisible zipper, her hand stopped under your neck before the suits collar. &#39;&#39;Turn your head please.&#39;&#39; She kindly asks, you silently comply with a suspicious look, and afterward you feel the collar tightening and adjusting to your neck, the side rims sitting securely against your skin. &#39;&#39;There.&#39;&#39; She says as you turn around and look at your back, seeing that the suit wasn&#39;t as loose as it previously was and you now had some kind of neck-protection or something, whatever it was for. But the problem of the suit still being a bit loose remained.<br />
<br />
Then came a warm sensation nestling throughout your body, then you suddenly felt a-bit ill as the warmth flared up. You gulped as you stumbled to lean against the wall of the cockpit. &#39;&#39;Oh, are you feeling okay? Is it working?&#39;&#39; You heard the lizard say with a hint of worry in her voice, you shook your head in response as you were too busy gasping for air rather than trying to talk. Your right hand was placed on your stomach, attempting to push away the pain and heat, your mind too busy panicking over your body&#39;s overheating rather than notice the fact your body changed, gaining mass as it filled to fit snugly in the suit, your curves getting more pronounced as your hips widened, your thighs fattened together with your ass and your chest ballooned outwards, expanding with large swells as it heaved in and out with your lungs, as if it was being filled with air as they were oddly light if you were to notice them, then as they grew, they began to gain more weight, as if the air was being replaced by flesh and tissue, your chest growing untill they each became slightly larger than your head, while the rest of your body had gained curves any human woman would be envious of, although your face had only softened up and looked slightly older while your head itself was slightly bigger. <br />
<br />
Your tidy hair changed colour from a deep brown to a raven-black, still only reaching your neck in length and didn&#39;t cover your ears, making them poke out as two pieces of tan flesh. Notable is the fact your eyes colour had changed to the same glowing orange as the two lights on the suits shoulders. Then the warmth died down, regressing back as it quickly disappeared, allowing your brain to quickly regain control of everything and begin registering it&#39;s surroundings. You blinked, noticing your vision was clearer than usual, then you looked up at the lizard, a tired look on your face while the lizard stood there admiring the curves you gained. &#39;&#39;Didn&#39;t expect you to become so volumptious.&#39;&#39; You heard her mumble, was your hearing sharper too?  And why did she say &#39;didn&#39;t expect you to become so vomulmptious?&#39; You pondered before you noticed the weight on your chest causing you to look down and immediately notice your two massive watermelon breasts snugly packed into the suits taut breastbag which also acted as a bra, causing them to poke out more noticably. <br />
<br />
Your mind raced in shock and panic before one worry arose to the top, one which could easily be proven false or right. Experimentally you crouched down slightly then rose up sharply, seeing if your breasts would bounce, and thankfully for your mental stability, the suit was generous enough to not provide any room for bouncing or jiggling, meaning they wouldn&#39;t risk making your center of mass  unstable and cause you to trip suddenly when you get used to possibly running in your changed and heavier body. Now you have the time to look over your body more closely except your goddamn humongoboobs were in the way of your downward vision and limited the view you could get of your lower body greatly. &#39;&#39;Let me help you with that.&#39;&#39; the lizard said, you looked up at her doing something on the cockpits control-panel, then part ofthe wall changes into a full-body mirror, you briskly walkover to it and look at your body, your face bright red in embarassment that you were being turned on by yourself who looked like an unrealistic fantasy-model wearing a super-advanced alien spacesuit possibly not meant for a human wearer. <br />
<br />
Now you turn to the lizard to ask her one thing. &#39;&#39;Why?&#39;&#39; You ask. She looked back at you like she expected you to rant about your emotion. &#39;&#39;Because adjusting that suit was going to be a pain and I thought it better if i adjusted you to the suits proportions.&#39;&#39; She said happily, then her gaze went to the side and her muzzle pointed slightly downwards. &#39;&#39;Although to be honest i didn&#39;t expect the biomachines to make you so curvy and big, nor to make you experience such a process.&#39;&#39; She said appolagetically. You sigh tiredly, the change had for some reason made you more tired and exhausted, maybe because it drained your energy? maybe. &#39;&#39;C&#39;mon, it&#39;s not that bad, besides, your a bombshell now and a pirate wouldn&#39;t harm you.&#39;&#39; She said gleefully, clearly trying to lighten your mood, it worked slightly but the pirate part did not help, for all it sounded like it meant they were more inclined to rape you. An experience you were not willing to experience and would rather stay far away from. <br />
<br />
Then you felt the ship rumble slightly, causing you to look around, then you felt as though you came to a stop even though you didn&#39;t physically decelerate. &#39;&#39;Huh? We&#39;re not supposed to have dropped out-&#39;&#39; Then a series of pings from the control-panel alerted and cut-off the Lizard. &#39;&#39;An alert?&#39;&#39; You heard her mumble as she waltzed over to it and began pushing buttons and tapping the screen, your curiosity rose as you appreached closer, looking at the panel and attempting to understand the nonsensical symbols. &#39;&#39;Huh.&#39;&#39; The lizard says with a surprised look on her face.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;What is it?&#39;&#39; You ask Curiously.</p>
