<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jane should have called her parents and told them someone was breaking in. Of course, that would probably mean having to defuse with Missy and put clothes back on unless the ring really did change reality and her parents wouldn&#39;t question why their daughter was half-cat. Not that they would be able to tell from her voice unless she accidentally meowed.<br />
<br />
However, Jane had picked up Missy&#39;s curiosity and she wondered just who could have broken into their house. She climbed down the counter and started making her way to the back door. She kept low to the ground, surprised that she was able to do this so easily on all fours. She was also able to move very quietly. She only hoped that the intruder wouldn&#39;t see her coming.<br />
<br />
She soon saw the back door, ajar and its window broken. She could smell an unfamiliar scent in the den and she cautiously crept her way there. She soon spotted the intruder looking for anything of value and putting it in a black backpack. The intruder was a Latina woman wearing a tight black jacket and black jeans. She had a black scarf, but she had pulled it down so it wouldn&#39;t get in her way. She had a rather pretty face framed by curly black hair. Her tight black clothes revealed she had an athletic body that wasn&#39;t overly curvy. She probably wouldn&#39;t be able to break into many houses if she wasn&#39;t as slim as she was.<br />
<br />
Jane felt the urge to attack this burglar and defend her territory. But then she&#39;d have to hand her over to the police and they&#39;d question how a young teen like could catch this woman. Jane didn&#39;t yet have enough nerve to test if the ring really did alter reality to make her merging seem normal. But then an idea occurred to Jane. Why catch this burglar when she could just merge with her. It could make her more mature and probably bigger than her reduced height. Jane silently got to her feet and crept forward. The burglar was so intent on her looting that she didn&#39;t notice Jane until she slipped her hand up the jacket and made the ring touch her.<br />
<br />
The burglar froze in surprise for a few moments. But then she vanished. Jane staggered a little as the room went black for a minute. When the room steadied, she looked down at herself and was surprised to see she was now wearing the burglar&#39;s clothes. Considering she had no clothes on herself before using the ring, this shouldn&#39;t be a surprise. Though Jane was disappointment that her body was still small and the clothes felt so baggy on her.<br />
<br />
But then, Jane felt a tingling through her body and felt herself started to shift. She was quickly growing taller, filling out her new clothes more. She soon noticed that her hips and butt were starting to become larger while her chest was pushing out. Jane watched in fascination as her fingers became longer and daintier, though she still retained her retractable claws. Perhaps their stubbiness was because Jane wasn&#39;t fully grown. She also felt her face change slightly as it became more ovoid.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Jane felt the changes stopped. Eager to see what she had become, Jane headed for the bathroom to look at herself. Staring back in the mirror was what looked like an older version of the catgirl she had recently become. She had gained some height, though only a foot. It still made her pretty small, but she was compensated by gaining the burglar&#39;s athletic curves. Jane felt her rounder hips and butt with pleasure before unzipping her jacket and pulling up the shirt under that. Her breasts in her new black bra were not as big as when Jane had merged with the fox, but they still went well with her slim figure.<br />
<br />
Her face looked more mature but she had acquired some Latina features from the burglar, namely darker eyes and her hair was now longer, black, and curly. She closed her eyes and tried to see what she had gained mentally from the burglar. She soon started pulling up the memories and knowledge of the burglar whose name was Juanita. Juanita was a 22 year old woman (which would make Jane&#39;s new age 19) who had stolen valuable items to pawn so she could put herself through a small college for a history degree. But history degrees didn&#39;t pay very much so Juanita kept stealing to cover her income. And frankly, being a thief was more exciting than what a history degree could get her. Juanita was pretty skilled with cracking safes, picking locks, and various other arts of the thief. The only reason she had broken the back door&#39;s window was because her lockpick had snapped and she didn&#39;t have enough patience to do something with more finesses.<br />
<br />
Now Juanita&#39;s skills and knowledge were at Jane&#39;s disposal. A part of her avaricious personality probably also carried over as Jane was considering practicing those skills herself. With her catlike agility and reflexes, she could be an even better burglar than Juanita ever was. She didn&#39;t even have to clean up here since Jane didn&#39;t need to break into her own house and the broken window and looted valuables were back to where they were before. But it would probably be the responsible thing to go to the police station and turn in Juanita, though it would be a hard thing to do without revealing the ring&#39;s existence. Or there was another possibility for Jane: using her new skills and abilities, she could break into other people&#39;s houses so she could find women to merge with and improve her body.</p>
