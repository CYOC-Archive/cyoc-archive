<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Many things impressed Quetzal as she came into Dino City, though namely the scale of the buildings. A lot of it made sense given the potential size that Dinotopians could grow to and she&#39;d seen some of the various photos and acts that had been done to show that. The Sauropod Dinotopians were truly massive when compared to even the large Theropod Dinotopians in terms of height and length and needed a place where they could live and be comfortable. Dino City was built to fit that need and reinforced the sort of storyline that &quot;everything was bigger in Texas.&quot; All of that impressed Quetzal, and it was partially why she&#39;d made her choice regarding what kind of Animalian to become.<br />
<br />
She hoped to remain friends with Holly and Barb, as the three of them had bonded in a way while working for a rather odd porn developer, but she couldn&#39;t go with their choices of Animalian. In a way the Texas Horned Lizard looked cool and few people had converted to become Reindeer Animalians, but they were also mundane and modern. In that they lacked a bit of novelty that Quetzal hoped to gain in her own conversion, which brought her to Dino City with the decision to become a Quetzalcoatlus Dinotopian. She&#39;d gain a more natural look in a way and become the largest animal to ever fly, and it would fit her name which would be good for a giggle when she could meet up with Holly and Barb again. Some of the rest was in her own walking tour of the city, which included seeing one home with a wooden sign put up that read: &quot;Diamond Mansion.&quot; <br />
<br />
The thing to giggle at was the &quot;mansion&quot; was no different in size from the other normal Dinotopian homes. It was larger than some of the homes and buildings there that were Human homes before Dino City was built, which again made sense given the size Dinotopians could reach, but it wasn&#39;t any larger than the homes that had been built for the Dinotopians themselves. This was likely part of the fact that from all reporting, unlike Animalia, Dino City had a rather limited amount of land to build on that had required a lot of buyouts, deals, and careful planning to build because of existing structures and so on. Dino City didn&#39;t have the open area to build actual mansions, particularly mansions build for Dinotopians. But it appeared one Dinotopian needed something labeled as a mansion. Quetzal was still chuckling to herself over that as she arrived at Horizon - Dino City and came face to face with Jeremy and Rex after finishing her paperwork.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t think I was so bad off that I needed two doctors,&quot; Quetzal said slowly, &quot;Miss Fabina...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy raised up a hand and Quetzal was able to get a clearer image on the difference in fingers between Jeremy and Rex. While most of the fossil DNA in Syntixisaurus was from Tyrannosaurus, allowing the hybrid Theropod to be classified as a sub-species of Tyrannosaurus Rex, there were signs of the other Theropod genomes present in Syntixisaurus. The horns above Jeremy&#39;s eyes and the five fingers in total were proof of that, while Rex didn&#39;t have the horns and only had three fingers if you counted his thumbs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will be administering your shot, Ms. Quetzal,&quot; Jeremy spoke, &quot;Doctor Ramos is here more with some paleontological research that will come into play after your conversion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Research?&quot; Quetzal wondered and looked over to Rex, noting the feathers visible on his head and the back of his neck were relaxed, &quot;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m not much of a scientist... In fact, most of the work I&#39;ve done has been more in line with adult entertainment than with science...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My wife did the same before we moved from Animalia to Dino City,&quot; Rex gave a chuckle, &quot;working at the Meat Market... but... that&#39;s a different story. And I&#39;m not necessarily asking for you to be researcher... just to help with the research that is going to a lot of the information related to prehistoric animals. And a lot of that has related to how prehistoric Animalians look like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s actually written a few papers on the topic and even talked with other paleontologists on how Horizon&#39;s programs with Project Mesozoic, Project Cenozoic, and others on how Dinotopians are helping answer a lot of questions that previous scientific debates could really only guess at,&quot; Jeremy gave a nod of agreement, &quot;they&#39;re good reading if you ever have the interest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Quetzal followed along as they moved toward the conversion rooms and with Rex walking quietly alongside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... as I said, I&#39;m not a scientist,&quot; Quetzal answered, &quot;A part of me was interested in something that would relate to my name... and while the Quetzal is the bird I was named for... I also wanted something a bit more flashy... striking... unique. And Quetzalcoatlus fits that. I mean the largest thing to fly ever!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s ultimately part of what we&#39;d want to confirm,&quot; Rex spoke up, &quot;for there has been some debate in the paleontological community on whether or not Quetzalcoatlus could fly or not. Some argue that its hollow bones and wing muscles were sufficient to gain some measure of powered flight while others have argued its muscle strength was more for walking on the ground and that it was too heavy to fly. By becoming a Quetzalcoatlus, you&#39;d actually provide some means to settle that argument. You wouldn&#39;t be the same size as the actual ancient animal, just as I am not the same size as a mature mundane male Tyrannosaurus... it it would present a means of scale that would prove that the actual animal could fly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though that will be determined when one of the previous Project Mesozoic members gets back to Dino City,&quot; Jeremy spoke, &quot;he&#39;s presently going through flight school in Lyre/Animalia. Once he can fly... he will then be hired to help you and handle the tests on whether or not Quetzalcoatlus could fly. Rex, here, would document the attempts and provide his observations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve managed to secure the means for some Zoom meetings with those that worked directly with Quetzalcoatlus to observe the flying lessons,&quot; Rex added, &quot;he can go into more detail on the sorts of things you&#39;d be helping prove or disprove.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He...&quot; Quetzal commented, &quot;well, I suppose I&#39;ll need something flashy. Since the conversion will deal with all the surgical scars, stretch marks, and everything else that my last employer had me get... This might get me someone interested in more than flight...&quot;<br />
<br />
Rex said nothing to that as they reached the door to the conversion room. He stayed out in the hall and let Quetzal go in with Jeremy. Quetzal was quick to move over to the bed and raised up one shirt sleeve, which was in no way a problem. No plastic or padding was ever added to her shoulders. When she looked up to Jeremy, he was working the alcohol swab and had a large plastic box set down on the edge of the bed. Like many things in Dino City, the box was huge, though Quetzal got the impression that was to accommodate Jeremy&#39;s hands. She only sat still as Jeremy finished his work, swabbed Quetzal&#39;s shoulder and then opened the box and readied the syringe, and while the syringe was of great size, the needle wasn&#39;t and thus looked small in comparison to the rest of the medical tool. It even made her giggle a little bit as Jeremy then gave the injection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to Dinotopia,&quot; Jeremy gave a small smile, collected his things and then departed.<br />
<br />
As the door shut, Quetzal went about undressing. The others wouldn&#39;t be that big, for those that became Animalians based on Animals larger than Humans were often still smaller than the mundane Animal. This meant that Holly would be a bit taller and larger than &quot;she&quot; was before and Barb would be about the same size as before, as the Texas Horned Lizard was smaller than Humans. Quetzalcoatlus was well larger than people and could be comparable in height to a giraffe. That would mean she would stand to get even bigger, and she would also have the issue of growing a large set of wings from her back and she was already getting warm.<br />
<br />
She just got her shirt off to see white pycnofibers growing out down her neck and chest and covering up the surgical scars where her implants had been put in and then taken out. Like Barb and Holly, Quetzal had never liked that their previous employer had so specifically wanted someone with unnaturally large breasts that had no sag whatsoever, large butts that also had no sag to them, and with swollen lips that looked overly puffy. It had often made them feel out of balance and unnatural, and while she wasn&#39;t opposed to having generous curves, Quetzal would have preferred a more natural look. An the growing pycnofibers, now getting some brown coloration  as they grew out on her sides. The only place where she couldn&#39;t see pycnofibers growing in was on her hands, though there brown colored scales were growing in and her fingers nails were lengthening into short claws. That sort of tingled.<br />
<br />
She wondered how she looked and wanted to get up and look into one of the mirror and see just how much had changed. However, just as Quetzal stood up, her pants began to pull tight around her pants . There was a tingle at the end of her spine. She looked further down to see her pants tightening around enlarging leg muscles and she soon set about trying to get her pants off. She hadn&#39;t worn a bra as she&#39;d already expected to outgrow her normal bra size, but she had to wear pants and now as her body began to grow those pants were growing tight. She was able to just get out of her pants off before things got too bad and she also got her shoes off as she exposed brown scaled feet with her toes tipped with stubby claws. Her legs had a fine layer of pycnofibers, white on the inner thighs and brown on the outer thighs, but that fine layer could see pulsing of enlarging muscles and even lengthening legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amazing,&quot; Quetzal said slowly as she watched her legs grow a bit longer and getting the sensation that she was begging to &quot;rise&quot; into the air.  And it was at about this time that her panties lost their battle with her tail as he grew out behind her. It wasn&#39;t long, but it was thick enough and strong enough that the soft fabric of her underwear couldn&#39;t hold it, particular as her hips and butt also began growing as well. They seemed to grow out until they were a bit bigger than before her conversion and gave her body some generous curves and longer legs than she&#39;d expected.<br />
<br />
The other Pterosaur Dinotopians that she&#39;d seen reported on all had decent legs, but in proportion to their overall size they were shorter when compared to other Animalians, even if their foot structure was more plantigrade, of a similar size. Yet for Quetzal, her legs were growing longer and more toned. And that wasn&#39;t the only thing. As she looked toward the door, she could see that while before it had towered over and now her head was starting to get closer to it. That got her to move over toward the mirror, and as she arrived she could see the changes in her head and neck. At present the biggest change was in her neck as it grew longer and lifting her head into the air. As it progressed, it rose and grew out into the same long length that she&#39;d found was noted among Azhdarchid Pterosaurs.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;d be like a flying giraffe,&quot; Quetzal practically giggled, though rather slowly as her lips were pulling tight around her teeth and as spoke.<br />
<br />
From there her teeth began to push forward and fusing together and soon poked through her lips. Quetzal ran her tongue along her teeth and found them fusing. She then looked down to see them continuing to push forward and becoming a long pale yellow beak. As this happened, Quetzal soon felt a new weight on her chest. She looked down and lowering her head, she could soon feel her growing beak press against her growing breasts, which soon began to approach the proportionate size they had been to suit her previous employer&#39;s desires. This time, though, her breasts were real and they felt real. Even the touch of her beak against the pycnofibers on her breasts was enough trigger some arousal, though Quetzal couldn&#39;t dwell on it.<br />
<br />
For at that time, the muscles on her back, already twitching as her transformation accelerated, began to heavily heave. Quetzal could feel new bones forming, just as a modest crest began to push up from between her eyes on her now hairless head. Her Human hair had all fallen out, as seemed to be the case with all Dinotopians. Then with one final great heave her wings burst up and out from her back and flared out behind her with three clawed fingers at their apex. It left Quetzal panting for a moment, but she did manage to recover.<br />
<br />
&quot;I may have to wait awhile before finding out if I can fly...&quot; Quetzal mused to herself as she stood up erect and looked over at her wings, &quot;but I can already tell that I feel GREAT!&quot;</p>
