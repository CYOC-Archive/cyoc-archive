<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was morning and time for another round of semen samples. This time Blake was collecting them. Tim had come by to monitor but Pete wasn&#39;t there.<br />
<br />
Because it was Blake and not Pete, I relaxed and got into it more. I let myself go and lost myself in the pleasure.<br />
<br />
Blake had one finger up my elastic ass while he held and kneaded my huge balls with his other fingers. His other hand stroked my cock. My legs and tail rapped around his one hand like I was riding a bull. My arms and mouth made love to his other hand as it moved back and forth. Blake had a nimble skill with my cock doing tricks to stimulate me in ways I never thought of.<br />
<br />
Being only twelve inches tall (30 centimeters) but having a five inch dick (13 centimeters) that grew an extra two inches (to be 18 centimeters) when hard, Blake had complete control of my body. He basically used my dick like a pen to write semen samples in the collection dishes. The blood rushing out of my head to fill my dick left me dizzy.<br />
<br />
Blake got a whopping nine semen samples out of me. That was a record breaker and I hadn&#39;t even had any virility drugs yet.<br />
<br />
When I had no more semen samples to give, he laid me on his desk where I collapsed in exhaustion. Blake and Tim spoke for a while and then Tim left.<br />
<br />
Blake went for a jog and when he came back, I had recovered enough to sit up. He was about to shrink my genitals again but I said, &quot;Wait, didn&#39;t you enjoy that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake said, &quot;No, did you?&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;Yes, that was amazing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake asked, &quot;So you want more?&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;No now. I&#39;ve had enough for today. But do you feel a little resentment toward me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake said, &quot;Well yes. I&#39;ve had sex before and it has usually been they getting all the pleasure. Then they leave me.&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;Then take off your clothes. It&#39;s your turn to feel pleasure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake blushed and hesitated. Then he took off his clothes. He picked me up and took me to his bed. I made my way to his enormous cock that was almost as big as me. I started making love to it, kissing it like his cock was my lover.<br />
<br />
I had read some microphilia stories after my first shrinking. I wanted to get an idea of what Blake wanted. I thought about how many of those stories always shrunk the person really tiny and I thought, &quot;How can that be erotic? What can a person that small do?&quot; I thought about how I was pretty close to the perfect size to please Blake, just big enough to make love to his cock.<br />
<br />
When Blake was hard, I tried to see if I could fit it inside my elastic ass. Despite how elastic my ass was, it was still a tight fit. I barely got his dick-head inside me an ran into a problem. My own internal organs were in the way. I couldn&#39;t go any further without killing myself.<br />
<br />
Blake was moaning but when I couldn&#39;t go any further, he stopped moaning and looked down at me. Abruptly he got up, leaving me on the bed, and left the room. I wondered if I had disappointed him but he came back modifying the shrink ray and shot me. I wasn&#39;t sure what the difference was except that my body seemed to be thicker.<br />
<br />
He lay back down and put me back on his cock. I got his dick head back inside me and pressed a little deeper. This time, there wasn&#39;t anything blocking. I felt my abdomen a little and realized I still had my internal organs. He&#39;d given me an extra internal organ, a long pouch just so his cock could go inside me. I felt my abdomen and could see the shape of his dick head bulging out. I pressed further and got his dick inside my rib cage. I wondered how far I could go and felt his dick head stretch my neck out. Then I opened my mouth and let his dick head out.<br />
<br />
I stopped there for a moment just coming to grips with the fact that I had a hard on go all the way through my body. I used my tongue to lick the tip. Then I slid down further and started making love to his penis. I went all the way down till I sat on his root. I used my hands to caress the part sticking out. Then I went back and forth on him until he shot his load.<br />
<br />
I thought I was done but he grabbed the end of his dick preventing me from leaving. He said, &quot;Don&#39;t go. Don&#39;t leave me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then I thought, &quot;He got nine samples from me. Let&#39;s see how many I can get from him.&quot;<br />
<br />
So I kept going and got two more loads out of him but he still would not let go. On the fourth one, he stood up and headed for the bathroom with me still on him. I saw myself in the mirror and it was a funny sight. It looked like Blake had two cocks and two sets of balls.<br />
<br />
As soon as he went in the bathroom, he left with me still hanging on him. He seemed frantic going from room to room in no pattern but he would not let go. Finally, he yanked me off, dropped me in the rat cage and left.<br />
<br />
I was wondering what was wrong. Why was he so frantic?<br />
<br />
He came back about half an hour later. He seemed calmer although I could tell he was still on edge. He washed me, and then grew me back to normal size. He asked me to pose like David. I asked why and he said, he wanted to take my picture. I posed and he shot me. He didn&#39;t use the shrink ray this time. He used the device that turned plants into aluminum. He turned me into an aluminum statue of David.<br />
<br />
Blake said, &quot;After pleasure, people leave me. I don&#39;t want you to leave.&quot; He moved me out to his small back yard and said, &quot;Don&#39;t worry. Aluminum doesn&#39;t rust. I&#39;ll clean you every day.&quot;</p>
