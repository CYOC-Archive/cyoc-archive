<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One week after their interview Dan and Sean drove up to the farm for the first of their weekly milkings and egglayings. Leaving their clothes in the car they walked into the barn completely naked, David greeted them at the entrance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey guys, welcome to your first day!&quot; David said enthusiastically,&quot;Dan you&#39;ll be over on this side. Just have a seat and I&#39;ll send someone over to milk you&quot; he pointed behind him to the left row of couches. On this side of the barn men with udders hunched on all fours over buckets while having their nipple-dicks tugged and milked by farm hands in overalls. &quot;And Sean you&#39;ll be over there&quot; David said, motioning to the right row of couches. On the right side of the barn men either squatting or lying back on the couches with their legs spread open squeezed eggs out of their pussys into baskets, when a basket was full a farm hand would carry them away. Sean took his seat at one of the empty couches. He was a little nervous practically doing this public, but at the same time a little turned on at the thought, and it was nice to see other guys like him. Sean was so wrapped up in his thoughts he hadn&#39;t noticed the guy taking a seat next to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, you must be new here, I&#39;m Jacob&quot; He said, Sean jumped in his seat out of surprise. Jacob looked to be in his mid-twenties, he had dark slicked back hair, olive skin, and a swimmers build with a little gut of what Sean assumed were eggs ready to be layed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Sean, today&#39;s my first day&quot; Sean responded. Admittedly Sean was taken aback by how cute this guy was. Against his best efforts he glanced at Jacob&#39;s crotch and noticed that, unlike most of the guys here, an uncut 4 inch dick hung where Sean expected a pussy. It was so weird, so...normal, Sean was curious as to how Jacob planned on laying any eggs. &quot;Um, can I ask you something?&quot; Sean asked, a bit nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it about my dick?&quot; Jacob replied, as if he&#39;d been asked before. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um yeah, sorry. How do you lay your eggs if you don&#39;t have a vagina&quot; Sean replied nervously. Now that he thought about it this isn&#39;t exactly something you should ask someone you just met.  <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s ok, everyone here is open about their bodies. I mean, we&#39;re all naked, aren&#39;t we?&quot; Jacob replied. He then turned toward Sean and flashed him a smile before lying his back on the couch, It was then that Sean noticed he didn&#39;t have any balls. Jacob spread his legs and stroked his dick to erectness, in between his puckered asshole and the base of his dick where his balls should be sat Jacob&#39;s pussy. With his other hand he traced the outline of his cunt, letting out a small moan.      <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man, that&#39;s amazing!&quot; Sean exclaimed with a laugh, too amazed to be turned on by the show in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, I think I&#39;m about ready&quot; Jacob replied, sitting up. He grabbed one of the baskets placed next to couch and resumed his position. In the excitement of meeting Jacob Sean forgot why he was here in the first place. He walked over to the other basket and squatted over it, turning towards Jacob. Sean then thought that while he was here he could get answer to something he&#39;s been thinking about for a awhile now.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how does all this work?&quot; Sean asked, pointing to his pussy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Oh, the egg laying?&quot; Jacob turned his attention to Sean while stroking his dick and slowly rubbing his pussy with a single finger. &quot;Well basically every seven days or so your ovaries produce a few eggs, the amount varies from person to person...&quot; Jacob began to explain, he was interrupted as a loud moan escaped his lips and a golfball sized egg slipped out of his pussy into the waiting basket. &quot;Oh man that feels good. Anyways, the eggs increase in size over the week until they&#39;re the size of what I just squeezed out, if they&#39;re not fertilized they develop a hardened shell, and by the end of the week they&#39;re ready to be layed. This is a very unique system, and as you can imagine getting pregnant would be next to impossible, you would have to know what you&#39;re doing or try invetro fertilization.&quot; Jacob finished. He started jacking off faster and moaning louder as more eggs slipped out of him. Pregnancy never occurred to Sean, but it was nice to finally understand how all this worked. He began rubbing his clit between his index and middle finger as his first egg pushed through his cunt. <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy crap, I think your eggs are bigger than mine,&quot; Jacob exclaimed, &quot;How are you not constantly gaping wide?&quot; Sean blushed, he had noticed his eggs were closer in size to a chicken&#39;s eggs than to a golfball.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m always pretty tight&quot; Sean responded, for some reason it was kinda nice to talk about his pussy with someone besides his roommates, &quot;So how long have you had a vagina?&quot; Sean asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um...about four or five years I think. When I first got a chronivac I replaced my dick with a pussy entirely. I kinda missed it after a while, but I still liked having a pussy, giving up my balls to have both was a nice compromise. I mean, It&#39;s not a total loss, I can still cum and everything&quot; Jacob responded, pushing out his fourth egg with a moan.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry about all these questions, I&#39;ve just never met anyone besides my roommate who had a chronivac.&quot; Sean said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? I have an idea, you should come by the farm tonight, around 11. There&#39;ll be more of us here with all kinds of changes, it&#39;s a real orgy, literally speaking&quot; Jacob said. With a grunt he pushed out a fifth followed closely by a sixth egg, finishing his clutch. He sat up and moved the full basket of eggs to other side of the couch. Laying back and spreading his legs he began slowly finger himself with his index and middle finger. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, I don&#39;t know&quot; Sean replied apprehensively, orgies weren&#39;t exactly his thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well think about this: that hot piece of ass David will be there, completely naked, aren&#39;t curious to see if he has any changes? A horse cock maybe? Or maybe he has a pussy like us?&quot; Jacob asked enticingly. Sean gulped at the thought of David&#39;s naked ass like he was swallowing an imaginary load, he pushed out a couple more eggs at the thought of David pounding him with what could potentially be an enormous cock. Sean had to see for himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, I&#39;ll be there&quot; Sean responded.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Good, now to finish up here&quot; Jacob said, fingering and stroking himself faster. He soon let out a gasp as he came onto his chest. Sean pushed a few more eggs at the site. A tall blonde farm hand soon walked up to Jacob and handed him a hand towel before taking the basket full of his eggs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you finished?&quot; The farm hand shyly asked Sean in a country accent. Sean could make out the farm hands erection and a tiny wet spot through his overalls. Sean pushed out his final egg and sat on the ground beneath him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am now&quot; Sean replied with a grin as he handed the farm hand his basket, who walked out of the barn with a basket under each arm. He lay down on his back and began fingering himself making the occasional moan. Jacob finished cleaning himself up and walked over to Sean.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man you can really put on a show&quot; Jacob remarked with a laugh. <br />
<br />
&quot;I could say the same to you. And, by the way, thanks for answering my questions&quot; Sean replied. Jacob smiled and kneeled, his face inches away from Sean&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem, see you tonight&quot; Jacob said before kissing Sean, who came the second their lips met. He then walked out the barn, leaving Sean on the floor with wet fingers.</p>
