<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Okay, one more quick one off thing to tie up an extra loose end and further develop this little weird universe. It may be starting to become obvious what I’m building towards here.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was difficult to keep track of time, bound as she was inside this damned lamp. There had been a last few wishes she&#39;d not truly heard but been bound to grant anyway, forcing her to work her magic at a great distance - but for the most part, Raize&#39;s life had become utterly dull. No mermaids stumbling across the genie, no divers pulling her up, not even a real sense of the world around her lamp as anything other than deep, dark, and damp. She had just about resigned herself to a miserable fate, stuck forever at the bottom of the sea, unable to unleash the kind of bimbo-demon chaos her new form lusted after.<br />
<br />
Today had been different.<br />
<br />
Well - it might have been today. It might have been last week, or twenty years ago. Again, the flow of time was a strange and nebulous thing in here. But she was certain that something had finally scooped her off the ocean floor, dragging her up. The pressure on the lamp was dropping, the water growing warmer as she became certain that she was approaching shore. Excitement like nothing she&#39;d felt since being trapped down here coursed through her being as she imagined finally being freed, and all the ways she could screw around with the wishes of the idiot who rubbed her lamp.<br />
<br />
There was a sudden feeling of something shifting, of her position relocating - and suddenly her lamp was in some kind of large interior space, a room that oozed with an opulent sort of aura. The home of someone with riches, she suspected - a fool, she hoped, with a great deal of money and power she could put to use. Her hopes were higher than ever as she waited to be summoned forth by a rubbing of the lamp, and indeed, she soon found herself being drawn towards the exit... but not by the call of a new master.<br />
<br />
Some other force, a greater magic than even she possessed, was prying her out of the lamp. Raize tried to hold on, but her relative lack of experience with her cosmic powers was on full display as she was forcefully ejected, still bound to the lamp yet now forced to appear outside of it. Her smoky form floated in confusion as she glanced around, finding herself in a large, sweeping chamber - some sort of throne room, in fact. And where there was a throne, there was royalty: she looked towards the big chair to find that there were two big chairs, opulently decorated, each one seating one of the most beautiful women that Raize had ever seen. <br />
<br />
One, a blonde, younger, with a kind expression on her face; the other, slightly older and dark-haired, with a more cunning and mischebvous glint in her eye. Each one was flanked by an equally goregeous lady, Arabic for the blonde, Indian-looking for the brunette. Their garb easily identified them as a pair of queens accompanied by assistants... no, consorts, Raize was certain of it. Certain and intrigued as she noticed the two queens holding each other&#39;s hands as they stood up from their thrones, walking together to meet the genie.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s more... hellish, than I expected,&quot; the blonde mused, her accent that of a prim and proper englishwoman. &quot;And an interesting choice in outfit.&quot;<br />
<br />
The brunette nodded, her arm bending to loop around her Indian companion&#39;s, just as the blonde repeated the maneuver with her own accompaniment. &quot;She certainly has little to hide, doesn&#39;t she?&quot; This one spoke almost like an American, yet with a squave, charming undertone to everything. &quot;What is your name, genie?&quot;<br />
<br />
Raize decided it was worth playing along for now, just until she could sort out what the hell this is. &quot;I am Raize, the Succubimbo Genie!&quot; She wasn&#39;t a monster hunter anymore, but she hadn&#39;t lost her flair for theatrics. &quot;Who among you has dared to remove me by force from my slumber?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that would be our lovely consorts,&quot; the blonde spoke up again, smiling as she nodded to each of the dark-skinned women in turn. &quot;Introductions are in order. You speak with Queens Mary II and Victoria II, Sovereigns of the United Kingdom.&quot; A pair of women married to each other and on the throne - she could only imagine the magical power they must have needed to make that happen. &quot;You have been pulled from your lamp by Farrah and Darzala-&quot; Raize&#39;s eyes went wide as the accompanying women turned their legs to smoke, revealing themselves as genies with trails leading back to the queens themselves. &quot;-so that we might negotiate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another woman with short white hair entered the room as Mary began to explain. &quot;Our lovely companions sensed your creation, and your being trapped within the ocean. It was a miserable fate, one we sought to rescue from without delay... so that you might... join us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darzala took over explaining next. &quot;You&#39;re new at this, and you&#39;ve yet to fully develop your powers - but Farrah and I make for excellent teachers.&quot; She floated away from Mary to circle around Raize. &quot;You see, our devious little monarchs here have a delectable plan...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite wonderful, in fact,&quot; Farrah agreed. The white-hiared woman was staring at Raize&#39;s chest as she stopped next to Victoria. &quot;They seem to free our race, and to use our magic to remake the world into something better, something beautiful. An entire army of genies, the likes of which can make the universe their plaything.&quot;<br />
<br />
The idea filled Raize with excitement, but it wasn&#39;t without issues. &quot;And you think you won&#39;t be stopped by someone? SALEM? The Council? The Guild?&quot; She almost spat out the name of her former allegiance. &quot;They&#39;ll throw everything at you to keep the world the way it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary laughed. &quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry. We&#39;ve set the dominos in motion - soon enough, they&#39;ll all have their hands too full to worry about two strange, beautiful queens who almost seem to have magical luck.&quot; She squeezed her blonde wife&#39;s hand. &quot;And in the meantime, we will gather together more and more liberated gnies to fight for their freedom alongside us... with you among the first.&quot;<br />
<br />
The white-haired woman finally spoke up as she stepped forward, a smile on her face. &quot;My name is Chloe, and... I am to be your vessel, just as my highnesses have become vessels to their own genies.&quot; She adjusted her dress to show off more of the impressive bustline. &quot;If your essence is bound to my body... you will be practically without limit in your capabilities. <i>We</i> will help to herald a brighter, more beautiful world, together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what&#39;s to stop me from taking your body and making the world over all by myself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you&#39;ll be wiped from existence by every magical group in the universe if you try to pull that willy-nilly.&quot; Darzala smirked as she raised an eyebrow. &quot;Assuming Farrah and I don&#39;t turn you to cosmic dust first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hrmph. She hardly liked the idea of having to be a follower to these two... but still... not being stuck in a lamp would be heavenly. And this poor girl could use some work, honestly - she had plenty of ideas for how to sexy up this woman. &quot;So... let&#39;s say I&#39;m open to your little scheme. What&#39;s the whole deal? What do I have to do - and what do I get?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You get freedom, for one thing,&quot; Victoria answered, &quot;The ability to do just about anything you please, and free reign over Chloe&#39;s body.&quot; The girl wagged her chest. &quot;Our terms are quite simple: you don&#39;t bring the Council down on our heads until we&#39;re ready, you do as you&#39;re told when we make a request-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;-and you never so much as <i>think</i> of backstabbing our beloveds,&quot; Farrah finished.<br />
<br />
Gah, so many rules, so boring. But it beat the crap out of staying in a lamp. &quot;Fine. It&#39;s a deal.&quot; She was about to ask what was next, but a snap of Darzala&#39;s fingers answered that question. Her link to the lamp was suddenly and violently severed, sending a chill of shock up her spine as her smokey form began to lose cohesion. Quickly, though, she found herself being drawn in to the nearest appropriate vessel: the body of Chloe, her sweet moans filling the air as Raize was diffused into her.<br />
<br />
She was young, lithe, sexy, desperately horny for her queens - but she could be so, so much more. Raize was at work instantly once she felt her essence fusing with Chloe&#39;s body, setting about changing it to her preferences. Hair became more golden in color, shining as it fell out in long waves down to her ass; her chest, already impressive, swelled up, straining her dress to its limit; a cute butt provided even more pressure on the poor garment as it was blown up - and of course, a little tinkering in the mind, yanking out a few boring things like scientific acumen and replacing it with a constant desire for sexual pleasure.<br />
<br />
Not a full-on bimbo, but close. Raize was quite proud of her handiwork as the transformed girl turned around to face her monarches, hands already moving to rub at herself as she looked their own gorgeous bodies over. The queens and their own genies looked between each other in surprise, having not quite expected such a set of alterations... but after a moment, they began to shrug and approach, wasting no time in placing hands and lips all over the incredibly sexy new form that Raize had given to her vessel. She felt everything the new pseduo-bimbo did, arousal flowing through her as four incredible women began to work their magic fingers all over her host.<br />
<br />
This had not been the outcome she expected... but Raize was certain, as Darzala and Farrah dragged her down to the ground, that this group was bound for a wickedly exciting future.</p>
