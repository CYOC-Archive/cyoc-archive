<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shelly had to keep a careful eye on the new 11 merpeople who were following her toward Atlantis, she did this for multiple reasons. First, she was the only one who knew the way toward Atlantis and trying to find a lost mermaid or merman in a massive ocean would be very hard and she would get into a lot of trouble. Secondly, she had to keep an eye out for predators, she was unarmed aside from the transformation agent which wouldn’t help her or anyone else if they came across a shark or worse a killer whale. She had a short knife but that was also next to useless as well. 3rd she had to make sure they didn’t go swimming off or get into trouble, Cat was the hardest in this regard. She was doing flips and spins even as they swam at such speeds which no human could ever hope to match. Keeping an eye on them and listening to them talking to each other was hard while trying to make sure she didn’t get lost.<br />
<br />
“I need a top.” Stated Sam as the former man now mermaid covered her hands over her breasts, every mermaid knew what she was talking about. Mermaids had sensitive breasts/nipples and water rushing over them at high speeds like they where swimming now was distracting to say the least.<br />
<br />
“Could be worse, it is when we where human going out in the cold was a pain with hard nipples.” Said Amanda who not only had larger breasts then anyone else here but was exposed to the rushing water like Sam and Zack’s where. <br />
<br />
“How far is Atlantis?” inquired Azumi as Shelly looked back at the former women, now merman. She didn’t trust him/her or Zack, the two of them where near the back of their group and seamed to be remaining very quiet unlike the others who were talking among each other. She believed the two of them were trying to remember the path they where following to either make a break for it and try to find humans who would help them or make a break and betray Atlantis’ location out of spite. <br />
<br />
“Well Atlantis is rather far away but we have a short cut.” Said Shelly as she dove toward the sea floor, moving past the remains of a WW2 cargo ship which had been sunk long ago. She didn’t mind the wrecks all that much, in fact she found them interesting at time and considering a lot of the bottom was nothing but sand it helped break up and mark the surface. What drove her crazy and caused her blood to boil was the trash which littered the bottom which all came from the human world. Metal pop cans, plastic bottles, countless numbers of other pieces of trash all messing with her home.<br />
<br />
“Follow me and be careful.” Said Shelly as she dove into the remains of the cargo ship, the others followed. Marveling at the fact that while it would have been pitch black for a human, they could see everything around them. It wasn’t perfect detail for sure, but like looking around in twilight they could see easily enough, and pressure wasn’t an issue either, but they noticed the water was getting slightly harder to breath like they were climbing up a mountain and the air was thinner.<br />
<br />
“Where are we going?” inquired Nate as Shelly stopped in the open cargo hold of the ship, the top had been blown off long ago. <br />
<br />
“Atlantis is far away, but long-ago Atlantis made tunnels which travel around the world and a fast-moving current is constantly moving through them.” Explained Shelly as she lifted a piece of metal to show what looked to be just ocean floor, but she brushed the sand aside to show a stone slab. With some struggle she lifted the lid to show a tunnel which dropped down into a much larger tunnel which seamed to be lined with some kind of bio luminated lights. They all could hear the roar of rushing water and could see it moving at extremely high speed in the tunnel.<br />
<br />
“We just enter the tunnel, and the current will take us to Atlantis.” Explained Shelly as she looked around at the new merfolk. <br />
<br />
“So this is like some kind of highway?” inquired Zack<br />
<br />
Shelly had to pause and think, trying to remember what a highway was. Her parents had told her about the surface world, and she had studied it in school.<br />
<br />
“In a way, but we don’t have cars.” stated Shelly “And the current is strong enough and it is designed in such a way you don’t even have to move your tail at all you can just let the current take you.”<br />
<br />
“Cool.” Said Cat as she moved to dive straight down into the current only to have Shelly block her. <br />
<br />
“Wait, there are two things you MUST DO to be safe.” explained Shelly as she lied her arms cross wise over her chest making sure to cover her breasts. “You were complaining about the current on your nipples before it is about to get worse so cover yourself like this, if you’re a mermaid that is.”<br />
<br />
“If you are a merman cover yourself like this.” She added crossing her arms over her womanhood.<br />
<br />
“Why?” inquired Aaron<br />
<br />
“Because if you get a hard on while in this current, it could rip off your dick.” Explained Shelly as all the guys including the newly transformed Azumi took careful note of that. <br />
<br />
It was like the fastest and longest water slide they had ever been on, the current was so fast that those who had long hair had it cover their faces multiple times but all kept to their proper potions. The tunnel twisted and turned, went up and down but Shelly was right who ever had designed this long time ago knew what they where doing, they didn’t even have to move their tails at all. The downside was trying to talk to anyone was like trying to talk in a crowded rock concert even at a full yell it was hard to hear the person beside you. <br />
<br />
The whole trip took hours, hours for the new mermaids and merman to think without anyone talking to them and nothing to see but curved sand covered walls and nothing to hear but the sound of rushing water. For Shelly this was boring but she knew it was also a risky time because anyone of the newly transformed could have their human side force their way back up and cause trouble. <br />
<br />
Finally, the tunnel widened and they began to slow down as they did multiple other tunnels began to join theirs before finally they all exited out into a large room. <br />
<br />
In the room where a few dozen other merpeople all going about their business as well as two dozen guards armed with spears and crossbows. They looked at Shelly as she came out and more so when she yelled her name and she had 10 new members of Atlantis who needed to be taken care of.<br />
<br />
That brought all the guards along with an official looking merman over, the rest of the merpeople in the terminal looked at the new commers and some even began to clap and yell out their welcome. <br />
<br />
“Where are we?” inquired Zack<br />
<br />
“In the heart of Atlantis, now lets get you to the adjustment center, all of you.” said the official looking merman, his and the other doctors and officials day had just become much busier. It wasn’t often that 10 new members of their society arrived, they would have to do multiple tests both physically and mentally to make sure the changed happen correctly. They would have to grade the mental acceptance of the change as well, Shelly would help with that grade and then they would have to explain stuff about their new society and their role in it. This is a process which took days at the least, weeks on average and sometimes even years.</p>
