<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Motherhood was a lot harder than anything Christina and Barbara had ever expected, and they had to deal with it with almost no notice. They had just finished clearing the rooms for Christina’s newly turned 6-year-old niece and nephew when they had to get in the car and head to the transformation center. The old center where Christina had transformed was now a regular hospital just like the one Barbara had been in. Barbara had been among the 1st to be put behind these walls when the government started putting those who came down with the flu behind walls both to help stop the spread of the virus and to keep order in the nation. In the old days when the virus was 1st spreading and it was believed those who became monsters could spread the virus people where attacked and killed. Even after it was proven that transformed people did not carry the virus they where still attacked. So, to help keep order in the nation the monster population was put behind massive walls. <br />
<br />
In some ways it helped, monsters had different needs then regular humans, and this allowed all those needs to be focused and within the walls they had free movement and a lot of government aid. The centers started out being small towns totally taken over by monsters now whole cities where within the area reserved for monsters. Christina smiled as they drove past the old wall which marked the boarder when she entered this camp, it had expanded out three times now. That was another reason why the government was considering shutting down the center system, they could not keep growing the areas reserved only for monsters without taking away whole states and major cities. Still, they had other things to focus on right now.<br />
<br />
They reached the transformation center which looked like a hospital on their side but with chain link fence which spread out on either side and just kept going. They walked up to a receptionist and to their amazement it was a human. There where humans in the center of course, parents who kids came down with the flu and unlike her brother and sister-in-law refused to leave them or the other way around. Still it was a rare sight.<br />
<br />
“Can I help you?” inquired the receptionist<br />
<br />
“Yes, my name is Christina and this is my girlfriend Barbara, my niece and nephew should be coming in and…” started Christina as the receptionist raised a hand. <br />
<br />
“We got a message from the hospital on the other side and they told us about you, can you provide ID and then we will get legal down here to walk you through the paperwork.” Explained the Receptionist as Christina pulled out her wallet and showed her ID, after that a small mountain of paperwork was given to her. “Here are the forms look them over, legal will help you with that. I can’t say how happy we are you are going to take in these kids. I can’t believe their parents abounded them.”<br />
<br />
“I can.” Said Christina as she considered. <br />
<br />
“Could you call for someone who specialized in child therapy as well?” inquired Christina as the receptionist looked at her. “My family is highly religious and on top of believing Monsterhood is a punishment for your sins, Gays will burn in hell in their world view as well, that will be something they will have to adjust to as well.”<br />
<br />
“I see.” Said the receptionist as she eyed Barbara who was standing back a bit. “I can’t believe some people still believe that, I’ll tell their doctors and believe me therapy is required for everyone who transforms and most of all children.”<br />
<br />
Legal showed up around an hour later, a lizard woman in a 3 piece shut who was more then happy to help them with all the paper work. Finally, a Doctor arrived and guided Christina to near the receiving docks where people who arrived to be transformed came in specialized isolation trucks. Christina herself had arrived in such a truck and to see her niece and nephew come off the truck, their eyes red with tears and puffy as well, just broke her heart.<br />
<br />
“Luke, Sarah.” Said Christina as she knelt before the kids who backed away in fear, which broke her heart even more. “You two have grown a lot since last time I saw you.”<br />
<br />
“Who…who are you?” said Luke, the 6-year boy had always been the more out going type. <br />
<br />
“Well…I am or was your Uncle Chris, but now I am your Aunt Christina, I came down with the flu about 18 months ago when you where about 4.5.” explained Christina <br />
<br />
“Daddy said you died.” said Sarah as she gripped a stuff teddy bear with all her might.<br />
<br />
“Well…I didn’t, wait let me check.” said Christina as she checked her pulse and smiled, that earned a little bit of a smile from Luke but not from Sarah. “Listen…I know you are scared, you are in pain but we will get through this. I will not leave you abounded alone here ok, you will come live with us and we will try our best to be as good as we can be to you.”<br />
<br />
“Ok…” said Sarah likely simply happy not to be alone.<br />
<br />
“Who is we? Are you married?” inquired Luke<br />
<br />
“No…well not yet, we will have to see about that.” answered Christina<br />
<br />
“Mommy says it is a sin for a man and a woman to live together and not be married.” Repeated Sarah “She said that while she was watching a show.”<br />
<br />
“Well…” said Christina as she wondered how she was going to deal with this, if they had been brainwashed religious this far how would they deal with Barbara. <br />
<br />
“Aunt Christina, why did Mommy and Daddy abound us? What did we do to hurt God?” inquired Luke<br />
<br />
“Nothing, absolutely nothing.” Said Christina as she pulled both children into a hug. “You, both of you did nothing wrong, God is not angry with you or hates you, you did nothing wrong and no matter what remember that.”<br />
<br />
“But we came down with the flu.” Countered Sarah tears flowing down her face, by now a lot of people where watching as these two crying kids where being talked to by what everyone assumed to be a family member or social worker at least. <br />
<br />
“And that isn’t your fault.” Said a new voice as Barbara walked up and knelt down as well. “Hello, you must be Luke and Sarah, your Aunt has told me a lot about you two but I can’t wait to get to know you better.”<br />
<br />
Christina thanked God that Barbara had come up even as the kids looked up at her confused. She actually hadn’t talked about Luke and Sarah all that much, they had been 4 and a half when she transformed and at that age they were toddlers.<br />
<br />
“Who are you?” inquired Luke <br />
<br />
“My name is Barbara.” Said Barbara as she extended her hand which Luke took. “I am your Aunt’s…”<br />
<br />
“Girlfriend.” Answered Christina deciding to just rip the bandage off.<br />
<br />
That started a whole another set of crying as these little kids started spewing out all the anti-gay things their parents had told them. About how it was wrong and it was against God, Barbara and Christina just took but they took heart that neither kid pulled away. Maybe it was their need to be close to someone when they face the future of monster hood but it still made both of them smile.<br />
<br />
The doctors came up and told them they were ready to transform, they transformed both kids at the same time and together so that they where not alone. The process was much smoother than it had been for Christina and while the kids where tired once the process was done they where free to leave the hospital. <br />
<br />
It was nearing nightfall when Christina walked out of the hospital carrying her niece, Sarah. She had become a Neko like she was, only instead of blonde like Christina her cat ears and tail where jet black aside from a little white on the ears. It was actually almost the same shade as Barbara’s Kitsune fur but Sarah’s mother, her sister-in-law had black hair so it likely came from her. Barbara was carrying Luke who like his sister was passed out from the process of transformation, he had become a Kitsune like Barbara only with blonde ears and tail, in the same shade as Christina. She didn’t want to say it but she was actually somewhat happy about that, Luke was Barbara’s monster type but had her color, while Sarah was her monster type but Barbara’s colors. They put both of them into the pair of car seats which the hospital had given them and once they where sure both where locked in, both of them sat in the front seats.<br />
<br />
“Well…we are parents now.” Stated Barbara with a smile.<br />
<br />
“Not the way I wanted but still I can’t thank you enough.” Said Christina as Barbara waved it off.<br />
<br />
“Like I said, I couldn’t leave them.” Said Barbara before giving her girlfriend a playful grin. “Still I think we will wait until they are at least in 3rd grade before we have our own.”<br />
<br />
Christina grinned as she leaned toward her and kissed her, it was standard practice when a guy was transformed to get a sperm center and it was kept in a sperm bank. So if they wanted they could have biological children of their own. <br />
<br />
“You know, that is only like 2 years from now.” Laughed Christina as he looked at the two sleeping children, they where both entering 1st grade next school year.<br />
<br />
“I know.” confirmed Barbara with a wink.</p>
