<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Ciaro Blivia Resort in the Caribbean Islands was a place nobody really knew the origins for. It just seemed to be there one minute and had always been there. What most people could tell was that the place was enormous, utterly luxurious, and drew in those yearning for a fresh and lucrative experience - either for their own relaxation or for the sake of their online presence. However most who did go there would be able to testify that the place always had a strange air to it - somewhat eerie if one tried their hardest to peer beyond the beauty of the location. <br />
<br />
Which was hard to do, considering the marble-like infrastructure, massive interior and exterior pools, rooms, and service that seemed top notch.<br />
<br />
The exterior included a large though harmless forested area outside the official grounds of the resort, which all guests were free to journey to and enjoy in the capacity of an adventure. The beaches were stocked with chairs, towels, and freely available swimwear in case a guest failed to bring along their own. Though guests of legal age on certain areas of the beach were allowed to go without clothes whatsoever.<br />
<br />
But to those who were able to do so, the place&#39;s eerier qualities included the fact that every single employee seemed to look alike - 20-something young people, well muscled and with a buzzcut in the case of the men, and athletic and busty in terms of the women, black hair and blue eyes, boyishly handsome or openly gorgeous, but devoid of any distinguishing qualities. They all looked exactly the same between others of their gender. And something seemed missing from these attendants.<br />
<br />
The only person who was not included in this strangely assembled nature of the staff was the so called owner of the place, Stefan Gautier, the strange and absentee man whose picture was plastered in photography in the large dining quarters, in multiple long hallways, and even in some bedrooms. But none really seemed to see him except very late at night, when some could see the light haired, pale and handsome man wandering the hallways.<br />
<br />
Singing a tune that seemed to be vaguely East European accented, but the words almost seemed gibberish. Yet none who saw him could keep their eyes off of him or stop listening. His was a tune that seemed to captivate hearts and minds. It was almost like he radiated an appeal that circumvented sexuality and preference. He was handsome, make no mistake, but in a way that seemed supernatural. A yearning radiated from him. A desire that went beyond the normal. The straightest of men and the gayest of women would find themselves captivated by that esoteric tune.<br />
<br />
That was however if they could catch him. He didn&#39;t come out every night. It seemed he only wandered the halls very specific nights - without rhyme, reason or pattern. His form, clad in slacks, a jacket and a black t-shirt, seemed elusive on purpose. And none could find him during the day.<br />
<br />
But the supernatural oddity of the place went well beyond just the allure of its founder. There was something going on that divided the place along an axis - an effect that took to people of different ages very differently.<br />
<br />
Those ages 40 and above would slowly, as they stayed longer at this conspicuously generous and low-costing resort, retrogress backward through the ages until they reached 16 to 18 years old. And, correspondingly, those of those younger ages would find themselves just as well growing older in tune with their time spent there. Those under the age of 30 would find themselves growing older as they stayed at the place longer. How they grew older would almost uniformly be generously - as if they went for the healthiest routes in aging.<br />
<br />
Now, most people would, upon noticing they were aging or regressing, panic, yes?<br />
<br />
However, the resort seemed to possess a strange &quot;shuttering&quot; effect. In which only those with the most perceptive capacities and capable reasoning would be able to tell they were in fact changing at all. A perception filter that ensured that when people began their trek to the boats and reverted to normal whence they left the place, few would really notice they had in fact changed at all.<br />
<br />
Thus, with the rules set forth and the scene set, three families come to the island upon hearing of it from friends, relatives and those close to them...<br />
<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
Caleb Lockwell sighed as he looked around the ship, wondering when the docking would complete and they&#39;d be able to get on this &quot;island paradise&quot;. Not exactly a typical nerd, Caleb greatly enjoyed swimming, water polo, and even experimented with rugby. His dirty blond hair was cut short, in a grown out buzzcut he meant to get cut down again, blocky glasses over his light brown eyes. Despite his logo&#39;d shirts, heavy jackets, sweat pants and so on, under the nerdy chic apparel Caleb was tightly muscled, though not bulky. He was excited to try out the swimming pools...as well as get away from his much more stereotypical dudebro brother and his friends.<br />
<br />
Dylan Lockwell - the said older brother - was presently and noisily making out with his girlfriend Christy. Dylan was the linebacker, about 19, and had outright been held back one year in high school, and was about a year older than Caleb. Not exactly typically handsome due to his jowls, Dylan wore his hair thick, bushy and with a few bangs hanging near his eyes. He was a hefty guy, about 270 lbs, not exactly all muscle either - Dylan was massive and strong, tall too, but fat. His pecs looked slightly saggy, resting over a large gut. His huge arms stuck out of a tank top, and he wore very large size jeans. Even still, Dylan was a cocky womanizer, eager to get to enjoying his separate room with Christy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude,&quot; Caleb asked, &quot;Are you making out hard enough to be moaning? On a public ship?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!&quot; Dylan said with a grin as he broke off another make out with Christy. &quot;Can&#39;t help it that my babe is so smoking hot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christy teased Caleb, &quot;You hoping to get laid here? Maybe if you showed off a bit more, you&#39;d get lucky.&quot; Christy was every bit the cheerleader, though she had a back up academic scholarship outside of athletics. A raven haired beauty, she had a tight athletic build and generously sized endowments both in the chest and in the rear.<br />
<br />
Caleb rolled his eyes, &quot;Christy, not everyone goes on vacation to bang.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s why you&#39;re a virgin, bro.&quot; Dylan chuckled dumbly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I got a BJ from Cynthia Lang by the swimming pool!&quot; Caleb retorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t count.&quot; Christy responded, and before long the lovebirds were back at it. Caleb for his part was just left waiting more for the ship to get to port. He wondered if there might be more people there, people who might be a better fit for him socially than his dumb-as-bricks brother and his fake bimbo girlfriend. Oh, Christy put on the front for Dylan&#39;s arousal, but it was almost insulting how she just casually slipped into her more intelligent persona when Dylan wasn&#39;t around.<br />
<br />
Down in the cabins, the parents were fooling around a bit...<br />
<br />
David Lockwell and his lovely current wife Lindy Lockwell were attempting to take advantage of their alone time while their teenage sons and their guests were out running around and enjoying themselves. David was 55, but had a background in wrestling, bodybuilding, and powerlifting - making him look more like a spry 40, though his fertility was markedly a worry of his. He styled his golden blond hair to make his hairline&#39;s decline less obvious, slight wrinkles obvious on his face. Still, most would say David Lockwell was a very handsome man for a 55 year old, well built as well. He&#39;d never quite left behind the lifting life - he was a fixture at the local gym.<br />
<br />
As he currently kissed and tried to urge himself to erection with his wife, he hoped there might be something to help him at this resort. He knew part of it was aging, but he was loathe to accept it. &quot;Babe...give me...just a minute. I know I&#39;m almost hard...&quot; David muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t force it, honey,&quot; Lindy said as she patiently waited. She was very passionately in love with him and cared for the kids, even though she was the step-mom. Following a divorce, David ended up coupling instead with a younger woman he met at the gym. 37 year old Lindy Young was in quite good shape, dark haired, and vivacious for her age especially - most would call her a cougar.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I know I can!&quot; David blushed and tried to concentrate. He had heard there was some treatment here that could ease such issues men had, but he was best described as skeptical though hopeful. He&#39;d kept his body in the best shape possible, but it seemed it was otherwise betraying him. All he wanted was to treat his wife to the love and adoration she deserved. Was that so much to ask...?<br />
<br />
Elsewhere, Lindy&#39;s relatives and friends were likewise enjoying their time there.<br />
<br />
17 year old Luke Young - or Surf Luke 99 as he liked being known online - was a dark haired, well toned young man who liked hanging out with Caleb and functioned as both his wingman and surf instructor. Best known as a &quot;Surfing Influencer&quot;, Luke maintained an online profile he intended to update and keep a hold on as things went on at the resort. Not that he knew what might be going on. Presently wearing a Hawaiian shirt, shorts and sneakers, Luke surveyed the waves and the distant beaches for any sign of &quot;good waves&quot; for him to engage with.<br />
<br />
Luke&#39;s friends presently conversed in the cafe area of the ship;<br />
<br />
18 year old Cameron Dane was a rather mouthy and open young man, his light red hair shaved into a high fade, Cameron had light green eyes and &quot;I could not be more Irish if I tried!&quot; He always said what he wanted - no matter how untactful and crude that might be. Cameron was quite openly queer - mostly toward gay. He openly wanted Dylan Lockwell, though it seemed he had no luck so far in that regard. Though he was indeed mostly toward gay, he did find he liked Christy as well. His fondest wish? A threesome.<br />
<br />
Likewise 18 year old William De La Cruz was Cameron&#39;s best friend and tagged along with their mutual friend Luke. William was hispanic on his mother&#39;s side, and was a well muscled aspiring model. He preferred &quot;fitness modeling&quot;, and had a catalogue of trendy shirts, pants, and shorts he enjoyed wearing. His skin was naturally bronzed looking, his eyes alluringly light blue, he styled his curly black hair back. Many people attested Will was gorgeously handsome, though a lot of work went into his face. William was somewhat bi-curious, though he mostly preferred women.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...you hoping to get with Dylan?&quot; William asked as he sipped at some apple juice. He never drank, not with his physique on the line.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bang on, bruv. Bang on.&quot; Cameron nodded with a grin. &quot;Fuck, he&#39;s been bulkin&#39; up a lot lately, mm?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not exactly my type, but you do you, man.&quot; Will said with a shrug. When it came to men, Will if he felt like going for one preferred guys like him. Men with astonishing physiques, great muscles, and beautiful faces. &quot;You know if we&#39;re gonna be coming up soon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a clue.&quot; Cameron said with a shrug.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, as Caleb started to wander off to try and establish some distance, just as he saw Luke coming up from his spot, there was an announcement over the PA system on the boat;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, we&#39;re heading in for the Ciaro Blivia Resort. I repeat, we are headed in for the Ciaro Blivia Resort.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb groaned, &quot;Finally...&quot; He looked over at Luke and the two of them fistbumped as the ship finally started heading in to the dock. It looked like as they got in that there were few people running around at present, but just enough to present a social scene for the people coming in to enjoy as they underwent any changes therein at the Resort.<br />
<br />
Before long, Caleb, Dylan, Christy, Luke, Cameron and Will - as well as a rather flustered and awkwardly sweaty David and Lindy - all readied to disembark. Checking for their luggage and making sure they had everything. Caleb raised an eyebrow when he saw what the adults were like, and wondered if he might be able to guess where Dylan got it from. He rolled his eyes and - as everyone headed out toward the resort - he thought about where he might be able to go...</p>
