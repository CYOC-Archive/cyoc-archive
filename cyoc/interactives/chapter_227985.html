<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Antonio cried out in pain as he was wheeled into a cybernetic shop, the hospital gurney rattling as he was rolled under a bright surgical light<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t care what it cost, name your price, just help him!&quot; A muffled voice yelled, everything around him sounding submerged in water<br />
&quot;Why didn&#39;t you help him!&quot; Another voice yelled in anger, a muffled thud echoing through his mind<br />
&quot;That thing was on us from the get go, what the fuck did you want me to do?&quot; A deeper voice replied<br />
<br />
Antonio could hardly focus his left arm felt like he had dunked it in molten metal, a burning, disintegrating feeling, his head spinning like a top as the urge of sleep began to overtake his mind.<br />
Something was wrong, something was extremely wrong, something in the back of his mind screamed at him to realize something, but everything came up blank, his arm began to feel wet, and cold, but the liquid still warm, his breathing intensified,panic beginning to set in.<br />
He couldn&#39;t move, like his body was pinned under some sort of weight, mustering all his strength he was able to lift his head, looking around the room, his head pounding as everything around him seemed to have an afterimage, he tried to lean up on his elbows, but he didn&#39;t move, why couldn&#39;t he move.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Mantis and Kat appeared above him, Mantis holding his face, her hands shaking her eyes stained with tears, and Kat holding the back of his head, looking up as she barked orders at someone, her voice unbearable now, nothing but muffled white noise, he turned his attention back to Mantis, why was she crying, had something happened?, was something wrong?, he tried to reach out with his hand to caress her face, but nothing happened, the feeling of warm liquid running down his side now intensified, the feeling of unease growing, so he decided to run a system assessment.<br />

Now the panic set in, what the fuck has happened to him, almost every system in his body was shot, scrap, or in layman&#39;s terms, fucked.<br />
It looked like he had gotten into a fight with a lion or some sort of manic beast, one armed to the teeth to kill and slaughter, frantic for answers Antonio looked back into his systems, desperately searching for something, anything to show him what happened, then by a stroke of shure fucking luck he came across the last intact file, everything after it a jumbled corrupted mess, not waiting anymore time Antonio played the datalog, his vision going black as his memories reconstructed what he saw and felt<br />
__________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Antonio woke up in Kat&#39;s bed, wiping the sleep from his eyes, stretching out as the morning sun bled through the city&#39;s dominating skyline skiing down warmly against his skin, every muscle ached as he tried to work the soreness from his body, stopping when he heard a groan, looking down he saw a sizable bulge under the beds sheets, lifting them aside Antonio couldn&#39;t help but chuckle at the two sleeping faces resting on his stomach Kat and Mantis almost woven around both his legs as they stirrwd in their sleep, Mantis being the first to wake, batting her eyes before letting out a quiet morning, smiling up at Antonio<br />
&quot;Well good morning stud&quot; she said with a smirk, shifting gently as she worked her way up until she lay her head against his chest, tracing circles on his skin as they watched the sun rise, it was peaceful<br />
<br />
&quot;Well good morning to you too, I take it your just as sore as I am after last night&quot; he chuckled, Mantis looking up at him with a raised eyebrow<br />
&quot;Really, last I checked you weren&#39;t the one having your throat and cooch fucked wide around a breeding rod&quot; she purred, letting her hands wander onto his stomach, grinning with evil satisfaction as Antonios member twitched under the covers<br />
&quot;Oh good, I was worried after last night we may have worn the poor guy out&quot; she laughed.<br />
<br />
Antonio looked down at Mantis, something about being with her just seemed right, and it wasn&#39;t just the sex, but dam was that a good bonus, but something about her made Antonio feel things he had never felt before, he couldn&#39;t explain it<br />
&quot;So about what you said last night&quot; he started, Mantis looking up at him as he spoke<br />
&quot;About what you said about us not being in love, I get it, but I don&#39;t want to be just fuck buddy&#39;s&quot;<br />
<br />
Mantis looked at him, seeming to ponder her words<br />
&quot;Well....we&#39;ve only known eachother a day, and in that time we&#39;ve sorta fucked like rabbits, probably bred me like a rabbit too, but appart from sex, we don&#39;t really know each other, so I don&#39;t know what else to say&quot; she stated.<br />
Antonio layed back against the soft pillows as he thought over her words, she was right, love wasn&#39;t even on the table yet, miles off the table, they had only ever knew each other working and in the sack, so what else could she call their relationship with all that<br />
&quot;Ok then, if fuck buddy&#39;s, sor friends with benefits works for you, then that&#39;s good enough for me&quot; he said with a smile, Mantis suddenly propping up on her palms as she hovered over his face, a look of relief on her face<br />
&quot;Ok.... Alright then, but don&#39;t you think for one minute that your cock goes near any other woman you hear me, that cock is mine&quot; she purred, grasping his member firmly as they both began laughing.<br />

<br />
&quot;hey buddy!, yeah you, throw me a gun!&quot;<br />
Antonio was now in the buildings main lobby, the air filled with people screaming, and gunshots flying through the air, glass all over the floor, bodies and blood scattered all over the main floor.<br />
Antonio was crouched behind the lobby front desk, now wearing nothing but a bulletproof vest and a pair of leather trousers, looking over to the source of the call for help Antonio saw a guy, his arms complete chrome, blood from a gunshot wound on his leg turning his blue jeans into a dark red<br />
&quot;Hey bro, I don&#39;t know what I just got mixed up in, but no one takes a shot at me and walkes away without a bullet in their back, toss me a gun!&quot; The guy shouted, Antonio reaching around to his back pocket and threw the guy one of his Magnum&#39;s<br />
<br />
&quot;Eat lead bastardo!&quot; He shouted, peaking around the overturned table before letting a few rounds off behind him, the sound of blood splattering and metal ricocheting bullets pinging a second later.<br />
Antonio tried peaking his head around the counter, a shower of bullets splintering the wood as soon as they saw him<br />
&quot;Friends of yours Mi amigo?&quot; He asked, Antonio breathing heavily from almost getting shot shrugged his shoulders<br />
&quot;No fucking idea&quot; he replied, looking down at the sizable patch of thick oozing blood dripping from his back<br />
&quot;But I got a pretty good idea what their here for&quot; he grimaced<br />
&quot;Hey, were not dead yet amigo, I don&#39;t know you, but at the moment we&#39;re all we got, and we can&#39;t sit around and wait for them to get comfortable&quot; the guy called, Antonio gave him a nod in agreement<br />
&quot;Ok....so what&#39;s the plan&quot; he asked, his new friend looking around the room before his eyes zeroed in on the elevators<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a risk but it&#39;s our only shot&quot;<br />

<br />
&quot;You gotta loose her!&quot; Antonio shouted as he clutched his bleeding side<br />
&quot;What do you think I&#39;m trying to do!&quot; The driver called, it was the same guy from before, now driving like a bat out of hell down the city&#39;s main street, on the wrong side of the road<br />
&quot;Hold still, your gonna bleed even worse&quot; came Mantis&#39;s voice as she applied pressure to the wound<br />
&quot;Dam, she fucking got you good&quot; she growled, Antonio hissed in pain as she pressed down<br />
&quot;Hey hey take it easy, you&#39;ll end up in my guts you press any harder&quot; he chuckled before spitting out blood that began to gather in his mouth<br />
&quot;HERE SHE COMES!&quot; the guy called out before a solid impact hit the back of their vehicle, sending them airborne for a brief moment before landing back on the road with a ear splitting screech.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, she&#39;s gonna wreck us!&quot; The driver shouted<br />
Mantis looking away from her task at hand<br />
&quot;Just focus on the fucking road Carlos!&quot; Mantis roared in anger as she pressed down harder on Antonio&#39;s wound, causing him to cry out in pain, in an instant everything turned to hell, one moment they were driving perfectly fine, and the next moment Antonio felt as a large impact on the cars side, gravity leaving them for a brief moment as they flipped through the air, glass flying through the air in a shower of small crystals, slicing both Antonio&#39;s and Mantis&#39;s faces and bodies.<br />
The car slid accross the tarmac, sparking as metal scraped against tarmac, setting fire to the fuel that leaked out onto the road from other cars, the ones unfortunate enough to have been shoved directly into the barriers of the highway, their front ends crumpled like pieces of paper.<br />
<br />
Antonio groaned as he dangled upsidedown, his vision blurry from both the impact and the smoke surrounding them, turning his head to look at the destruction left behind them, Antonio&#39;s blood ran cold as a figure emerged from the wall of fire and smoke, their pristine white synthetic body unscathed as she walked towards them, her eyes glowing red, her arms unfolding to spring two firearms out and around into her hands from her forearms, Antonio tried to get up but he couldn&#39;t move his arm, looking down he screamed out in pain as he realised his arm had been crushed off, gushing blood as his destroyed arm dropped off, tearing just above his shoulder, looking back towards their attacker, the girl was suddenly stood right outside Antonio&#39;s door, waiting as blood loss and pain began to take their toll on Antonio.<br />

<br />
Antonio&#39;s breathing became tagged and laboured as his conceous mind returned from his memory banks, the pain throughout his body exceeding anything he had ever felt before in his life, a burning, gnawing feeling throughout his heart and veins, like liquid iron was being pumped into them, his arm, or rather lack there of burned with fresh pain, something solid being inserted over his shoulder bone, Antonio didn&#39;t know what it was or what to make of it as whoever was doing this to him connected it to his systems, a arm reaching across his view before putting a clear mask over his face, breathing heavily Antonio was suddenly hit with the strong urge of sleep, his mind fogging and his body relaxing as darkness enveloped his mind once more.</p>
