<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Come on Kyle, you really believe in this whole &#39;Transform or Dare&#39; nonsense?&quot; Jen snorted. &quot;You&#39;re a little too old to believe in campfire tales. Someone made it up just to scare others.&quot; Her snort quickly turned into a laugh. &quot;Let me guess .. you&#39;re going to come up with some weird &#39;curse&#39; to cast on me, something that&#39;s going to &#39;ruin my life&#39; and you&#39;ll tell me all about it in great detail and then hang up on me? Well news flash, &#39;Transform or Dare&#39; isn&#39;t real!&quot; She stood in her kitchen and looked around, this stupid phone call was going to make her late, so she&#39;d have to grab something quick to eat for breakfast. Not that she wanted to go to school anyways. It was a place full of losers a fakers. Fake friends and boyfriends who only liked her for her wealth. The only reason why she went was because her after school cheerleading and gymnastics classes were her escape.<br />
<br />
She opened the fridge and sighed with disappointment. There was absolutely nothing good to eat. Her mother and father worked long hours and they always came home exhausted, the live-in maid left took the day off, and since Jen herself had never even stepped foot inside a grocery store that meant there was no-one left to go shopping. She sighed as she slammed the door shut. Her eyes drifted over to a platter on the counter where fruit was usually kept. &quot;Ugh, seriously? All we have to eat is a freaking banana? Fine.&quot; She rolled her eyes as she picked up the lone piece of fruit and tore a portion of the peel away. <br />
<br />
On the other end of the phone, Kyle cleared his throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. You&#39;re still there.&quot; Jen said dryly. &quot;Look, I don&#39;t have time to entertain your nonsense. So I&#39;m going to hang-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No .. you aren&#39;t. Since you didn&#39;t respond in time, you&#39;re going to get both. I&#39;ll start with your dare. I dare you to not hang up this phone call, so you have to listen to everything I have to say. I also dare you that you will not be able to speak a word of this curse to anyone, and you will not be able to transform or dare anyone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah right.&quot; Jen spoke. She pulled the phone away and prepared to hang up but found herself unable to hit the end call button. &quot;What is this?&quot; Her eyes widened in shock. &quot;Why can&#39;t I-&quot; Her voice faltered. Wait .. could the curse actually be real?<br />
<br />
&quot;Now listen Jen. I know ever since we entered high school you changed. And you changed for the worse. You acted like you didn&#39;t even know me, even though we both know that&#39;s not true. And then when I tried to confess my feelings that I held for you, you pulled down my pants and laughed at me with all your bully friends. So out of respect for our old friendship, I won&#39;t completely ruin your life with this transformation you&#39;re about to undergo. But I sure as hell am gonna make it embarrassing and kinda kinky.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen opened her mouth to yell at Kyle but was interrupted by his continued speech. &quot;You actually gave me an idea earlier, so I&#39;m going to use that as a starting point for your curse. Jen .. as soon as I tell you that it&#39;s okay for you to hang up, you&#39;re going to transform into a anthropomorphic monkey boy. Over the next month, your intelligence will begin drop, starting with you losing your ability to read. Eventually you&#39;ll start talking in third person, using short words and sentences. Sometimes when a word or concept is to difficult for you to express you&#39;ll just screech and chatter like a monkey. You&#39;ll eventually become blissfully unaware of the curse for the most part as you become ditzy, adorable, horny and slightly clumsy. You&#39;ll find its much easier to run on all fours and climb trees and hang from your tail than it is to walk, not that you&#39;ll be unable to walk. Soon you&#39;ll forget all about your curse in the first place since ignorance is bliss.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll start by losing your vagina and ovaries, since they&#39;ll be replaced by a dainty three inch cock and balls. You&#39;ll shrink to exactly five feet tall. You&#39;ll still be sexually attracted to men, don&#39;t worry. You&#39;ll especially love being underneath a man, feeling him fill up your puckered ass with his seed. You&#39;ll still view yourself as female and refer to yourself with female pronouns.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You will no longer be monogamous, at least for the time being. You&#39;ll want to sleep with every boy within a five year gap of your age range, and do so with at least one a day. It won&#39;t matter if they&#39;re related to you or not. You&#39;ll never be able to get or pass on STDs, but you will pass your curse to any man or woman you sleep with. For the men, they&#39;ll become infected but never transform. However, the next woman they sleep with will inherit the curse. And any woman you sleep with will also inherit the curse as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The women who are infected will instantly transform becoming some kind of male simian or prosimian, so that means they&#39;ll all become apes, monkeys, gorillas, lemurs and the like. Although just like yourself, the former females will still use feminine pronouns and act feminine. The infected naturally born males will never age past twenty-five and the infected naturally born females will never age past twenty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eventually once the curse has spread far enough, you&#39;ll settle down with me as your mate. Since you&#39;re considered the ground zero of this infectious curse, all the &#39;females&#39; will naturally consider you their queen and bow down to you, protecting you with their lives. Once every five years, you, and only you, will switch back to being anatomically female. During that fifth year your job is to increase the population. The first day of the new year, you&#39;ll sleep with me and get pregnant. You&#39;ll experience one trimester per day, and on the ninth day you&#39;ll give birth. Then the cycle will start all over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You will grown &#39;d&#39; sized breasts during that time along with your top forty closest female attendants so you can feed the infants. You&#39;ll keep and raise our baby but you&#39;ll pass the others off to your attendants who will love and raise them carefully. After the year is up, you&#39;ll go back to being male and come back to sleeping exclusively with me. Then over the next four years the female simian children will age up to twenty, and the male human children will age up to twenty-five. The cycle will then continue all over again. You&#39;ll love getting pregnant and giving birth will be relatively easy for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now as for your physical transformation, since you&#39;re going to be the queen of the new species, you&#39;ll stand out as the only one who has pure white fur and golden eyes. Everyone else will have either brown, black or grey fur with either pink, red or purple eyes. Every female child you give birth to will have brown, black or grey fur, but they&#39;ll inherit your golden eyes. Male children will always resemble their human father, but with golden eyes. You&#39;ll still have long hair, and you&#39;ll have a thin, athletic figure .. perfect for running and climbing. You&#39;ll resemble a rhesus macaque the closest, but you&#39;ll have a long, strong and prehensile tail and be incredibly soft and fuzzy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh and by the way, the world will not think your curse is just natural, they&#39;ll know something is wrong, but lucky for you anyone who has any intention of harming that comes within five feet of you will turn into deliciously docile bugs that will stay put. And you will instinctually grab and eat them. And weapons of any kind will undergo the same treatment, turning into bugs for you to eat. You&#39;re free to hang up now so you can experience your transformation and have wild intercourse with the first man you see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen pulled the phone away from her ear, startled by everything she just heard and unable to comprehend it at all. &quot;What kind of sick-&quot; She began to say before realizing that Kyle had hung up on her. She slammed the phone down. &quot;What a freak!&quot; She grumbled. She shoved the banana she had peeled into her mouth.</p>
