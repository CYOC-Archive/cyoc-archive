<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the shower Steven scrubbed the cum that had splattered and matted into his now hairy body.  He was disgusted to see just how much he had gotten on him and how the game had changed him.  He seemed to scrub and scrub. On the ledge of the shower, he found one of his old razors.  It wasn&#39;t super rusty so using the lather he had worked up, he decided to shave the offending hairs on his chest.  He made quick work of the trim shaving from the top of his chest down to a few inches below his navel.  He stopped above the massive bush of pubes that had been covered by his speedo knowing that his &quot;situation&quot; down there would require more of a power tool approach.  Rinsing off and stepping out of the shower, he grabbed the towel off the rack. <br />
<br />
Drying off, he stood in front of the fogged up vanity mirror and wiped it off.  He wrapped the towel around his waist and recoiled.  <br />
<br />
In the time it had taken him to dry off, the hair on his chest has reappeared seeming to have grown back in seconds. Even worse, he couldn&#39;t even call himself merely hairy now.  He now had a pelt of hair from his chest on down. He wrapped the towel around his waist and then...<br />
<br />
Dan cleaned himself up fairly quickly.  He hadn&#39;t been thinking or even aiming when he had shot his load at the table but the sheer volume and pressure of his massive load had caused it to shoot out and away from him.  He found pulled off the shorts and underwear that he had been wearing knowing that they wouldn&#39;t contain his now pendulous set of balls. He thought about pulling on another set of underwear but he quickly decided that nothing would adequately cover his added mass.  He decided to forgo his briefs and just pull on some of the drawstring shorts that he had worn at his heaviest after his wife&#39;s passing. As he pulled up a pair of cotton shorts, he felt one of the offending orbs.  He almost swore he could feel it churning in his hand making more cum at a rapid rate.  The thought turned him on a bit but he quickly drew his hand away and pulled the shorts up.  He grabbed a t-shirt and thought for a moment.  How could this all have gone so wrong. And then...<br />
<br />
Tony and Jeff went into their shared bathroom. Tony began to strip down. Jeff said, &quot;Hey, have some decency, I&#39;m in here too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not like I don&#39;t have anything you haven&#39;t seen before.&quot; Tony said with a smirk. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not really true.&quot; Jeff said with a matching grin then his face shifted revealing the confusion he felt.  The two sets of memories playing in his mind. He remembered his life with his two older brothers and growing up as the youngest but he also remembered a completely different life where he had his twin brother with him the entire time.  <br />
<br />
It was obvious which set of memories were fake.  There were no twins in the entire world that were born at the exact same time and he had even seen a scar on his knee from when they had both fallen off a bike.  It was weird.  He was snapped out of his reverie when he realized that his brother had finished undressing.  Tony was hefting what he knew to be his 9.5 inch cock.  They had both measured over the years.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn.&quot; He said with a laugh. Recalling what the game had done to him at the beginning of the game.  &quot;You must have been hung like a mouse before we started sharing.&quot; Jeff started shucking off his dirty clothes too.  <br />
<br />
Tony blushed but Jeff kept going. &quot;You know the game had me at well over a foot. What were you sitting at before we got changed?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony smiled even wider and grabbed his bro&#39;s cock and give it a couple tugs.  It sprung to attention.  <br />
<br />
Tony said, &quot;I am glad that we evened out some of this ass though.&quot; He released his brother&#39;s cock and gestured to his rear which had gone from a pair of basketballs after his first card to a more natural looking bubble.  &quot;Good thing you were so scrawny.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two started to tussle.  The thoughts of cleaning up and getting dressed momentarily forgotten.  They stopped and were panting knowing that the intermission might end at any moment.  <br />
<br />
Tony and Jeff both thought about how nice it was for them to be close.  Neither one the annoying kid or the boring jerk.  But both just close.  <br />
<br />
They looked away from each other&#39;s face and realized that they were both hard.  Each reached out to the other and began to play with their matching units.  They shared everything.  <br />
<br />
&quot;We should stop,&quot; Tony said. Neither brother slowed.  They both felt the heat from their shared cocks building and pre leaking out.  Then...</p>
