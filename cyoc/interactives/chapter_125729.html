<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite the unexpected turn at the Halloween Carnival, Jeremy continued to go out with Heather. He had to admit, without the possible threat of being kidnapped, these outings with Heather were rather enjoyable. They were mostly small things; going to movies, eating out, taking a jog in the park. Jeremy was a bit embarrassed to realize how out of shape he was, even without being compared to an amazon of a dinosaur.<br />
<br />
But he still, he was finding Heather to be very pleasant company and was growing increasingly fond of her. Perhaps it was because they had known each other years before, even if Jeremy was too wrapped up in his own work to really pay attention to her. Perhaps it was because his view of Animalians living within a limited niche of society was eroding away. His repeated visits to Dr. Jones was able to help him to get to terms with his various emotions. Eventually, he was able to come to a final decision.<br />
<br />
Of course, he didn&#39;t tell Heather immediately. He decided to talk to her in a better setting. The Steakhouse seemed to be the best location to do it. Jeremy didn&#39;t intend to give any hints, but Heather seemed to have picked up that this was supposed to be a special night and dressed up a bit. While some people might think a dinosaur in a dress would sound ridiculous, Heather actually managed to pull it off. It certainly help that her red dress clung tightly to her impressive curves, as well as having a plunging neckline and intended gaps on either side of her waist to show off more skin. Jeremy had already seen plenty of Heather&#39;s curves in her form-fitting jogging clothes, but her dress was still very appealing.<br />
<br />
But possible romance or not, Heather wasn&#39;t about to pass up a chance to have her fill. And being a <i>Syntixisaurus rex</i>, she could put away a lot of meat. She was starting on her third steak before Jeremy said, &quot;Heather, we&#39;ve known each other...a reasonably long time, haven&#39;t we?&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather swallowed her mouthful and said, &quot;At least a few years, on and off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I feel I&#39;ve really gotten to know you better as a dinosaur than as a human,&quot; said Jeremy. Heather raised an eye ridge at that. &quot;Uh, let me start over,&quot; said Jeremy, &quot;I think that considering the species difference between us, we&#39;ve gotten rather close. No, wait, what I meant was-&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather watched as Jeremy stumbled to make a statement for about a minute or so. She probably could have been offended by the seemingly-insensitive way Jeremy kept addressing her as, but she knew that Jeremy was not a people person and tended to forget how to act with others quite a lot. So his self-correcting was a lot more cute than insulting. And it was rather funny too.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Heather decided to interject. &quot;I think what you&#39;ve been trying to say is that we&#39;re at a level that most people would consider &#39;boyfriend and girlfriend&#39;,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, to put it in the simplest terms, yes,&quot; said Jeremie, &quot;And I was thinking it might be time to...cement that level.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather paused in shocked. &quot;Jeremy Green, are you suggesting what I think you&#39;re suggesting?&quot; asked Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what I was thinking that since you&#39;ll eventually be wanting a mate, I would be the best choice,&quot; said Jeremy, &quot;I have a very decent understanding of you, I&#39;ve known you for at least as many years as many couples have before they&#39;ve become official. We already work pretty close together and I have the best understanding on how your physiology works.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what about love?&quot; asked Heather, sounding casual, though secretly on edge.<br />
<br />
Jeremy shrugged and said, &quot;I suppose I do love you, as much as a person such as myself is capable of love.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are very capable of love,&quot; said Heather, &quot;Look how much you&#39;ve devoted to your sister.&quot; She paused at that before saying, &quot;Oh, wait, Polly. If we become... Wouldn&#39;t she...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been thinking about that a lot too,&quot; said Jeremy, &quot;I have been looking after her, trying to raise her as best as I can since our parents passed away. I should have considered my efforts to cure her were completed when I gave her that injection. But I think Mrs. White was right. I&#39;ve been more of her caretaker than her brother. She needs a proper home to grow up in, to give her what she wants as well as what she needs. And maybe I need to realize that I want and need aren&#39;t what I think they are. I do love Polly, but we can&#39;t be shackled together all her life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeremy, I wouldn&#39;t want you to sacrifice so much just for me,&quot; said Heather solemnly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need this as much as Polly does,&quot; said Jeremy, &quot;The Whites are a good family. I&#39;m sure Polly will be able to see me any time. Besides, I think I&#39;d rather be a dinosaur for life than a bear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Overcome with emotion, Heather stood up, grabbed Jeremy, and hugged him close. &quot;Oh, Jeremy, you&#39;re making me the happiest dinosaur on Earth...which doesn&#39;t have a lot of competition, but still.&quot; She eventually became aware of Jeremy frantically tapping on her arm. She looked down to see he was literally smothering in her cleavage. &quot;Oh, sorry,&quot; said Heather before releasing him.<br />
<br />
Jeremy took in a long breath of air and said, &quot;I think we should wait until I&#39;m in your weight class before we do that again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how do you want to do it?&quot; asked Heather with a sexy growl, &quot;Want to be the first human to hump a dinosaur?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heather, you know your particular variety of the virus is noninfectious,&quot; said Jeremy. Heather gave him a disappointed/annoyed look. &quot;But as you recall, there is a serum back at Horizon Lab that should have the same effect.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how are we supposed to get that serum?&quot; asked Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;The usual way: asking, filling out forms, ordering new equipment for larger hands,&quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You already planned this out?&quot; asked Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t have brought this up if I weren&#39;t prepared,&quot; said Jeremy, &quot;We can go to Horizon Labs tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that&#39;ll be the most I&#39;ve ever looked forward to that,&quot; said Heather with a warm smile.<br />
<br />
====================<br />
<br />
The next day, Jeremy and Heather went to Horizon Labs. Heather was feeling particularly giddy. She couldn&#39;t wait to finally claim Jeremy as a mate. And it wasn&#39;t just a strong need for companionship. Heather had a certain she was having trouble scratching herself. And she definitely didn&#39;t need her grandma&#39;s help for that. Still, it was pretty amusing for Heather to introduce Jeremy to Tyra as her soon-to-be boyfriend only for Tyra to recognize him as the wiseguy who called her a &#39;fossil&#39; before she was converted. But still, at least Tyra was happy her granddaughter was finally finding someone to share her life with. If only Heather could forget Tyra asking if they could share Jeremy once he was converted.<br />
<br />
However, there was one other surprise as they went into the particular lab where the <i>Syntixisaurus</i> serum was kept. They weren&#39;t the only couple there, though &#39;couple&#39; was a bit of a stretched term. Heather recognized Iphis and Ianthe from her last punishment, though it was pretty hard to not recognize the large two-headed anaconda. She didn&#39;t recognize the hippy woman and the punk guy though. &quot;Iphis, Ianthe, what are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t know?&quot; asked Iphis.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought all the scientists here knew,&quot; said Ianthe.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been out of the loop lately,&quot; said Jeremy. Since he&#39;s been reassigned to the three de-extinction projects, he&#39;s not paid much attention to what the other projects at Horizon have been working on.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re finally ready to take our relationship to the next level,&quot; said the punk, &quot;And the science guys here have figured out how to do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, you realize they could just bite you or something to change you, right?&quot; asked Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, we&#39;re not just becoming Animalians,&quot; said the hippy in a slightly dazed voice, &quot;We&#39;re gonna be shemales.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shemales?&quot; asked Heather in confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;She means herms,&quot; said Ianthe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; said Heather. It took a few seconds for it to click in: &#39;herms&#39; being short for &#39;hermaphrodites&#39;, which Iphis and Ianthe told Heather they were. &quot;Oh!&quot; said Heather in a surprised tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can do that?&quot; asked Jeremy, also sounding surprised. He had been busy with his own cure project at the time and hadn&#39;t been part of the uplifting of the polycephalous snake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we were just female before they added the DNA from that two-headed herm rat snake,&quot; said Iphis.<br />
<br />
&quot;It should be really be a simple procedure,&quot; said the scientist working with them, &quot;We&#39;ve already isolated their unique X/Y chromosome configuration. All we really need to do is make sure that Typhoon and Waterlily&#39;s chromosomes match that configuration as the virus is introduced to their body. The rest of the conversion should be a piece of cake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we&#39;ll merge into a two-headed snake too,&quot; said Waterlily, still sounding dazed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t count on that,&quot; said Typhoon.<br />
<br />
&quot;So after that, how will you guys, uh, marry?&quot; asked Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we&#39;ll just ask a justice of peace to elope us,&quot; said Typhoon, &quot;I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a church in the world that can do a wedding for a bisexual threesome like us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would it be a double wedding or a triple wedding?&quot; asked Waterlily.<br />
<br />
There was a long pause as everyone tried to think of an answer to that question. Eventually, Heather said, &quot;I think I see your point there. I don&#39;t even know who&#39;d be wearing the tux and who&#39;d be wearing the bridal gown.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, anyways, once we&#39;ve finished converting them, I think there&#39;s much possibility for this hermaphrodite gene,&quot; said the scientist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what? Making herm hyenas?&quot; asked Jeremy jokingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s one of our selections,&quot; said the scientist.<br />
<br />
Jeremy closed his eyes as he felt his head pounding in an unpleasant way. &quot;Heather, let&#39;s just get our serum and get going.&quot; With that, he retrieved the serum from the fridge and walked out of the lab.<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations, you two,&quot; said Iphis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make his first time special, &quot;said Ianthe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; said Heather before following Jeremy. As she caught up to him, she asked, &quot;Have you ever thought about going herm?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Jeremy flatly.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, I bet you&#39;d look cute,&quot; said Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I suppose you&#39;ll want the same yourself,&quot; said Jeremy dryly.<br />
<br />
Heather briefly imagined herself with a dick. The thought actually turned her off quite a lot. &quot;Er, I think I&#39;d be fine as I am,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re already going to turn me into an amalgamation of different theropod species that didn&#39;t exist in prehistory. Let&#39;s not flaunt the laws of nature any further,&quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
====================<br />
<br />
Once in one of the several &#39;changing rooms&#39;, Jeremy started preparations. It was really more of a simple hotel room, complete with a bed. An extra large one since they&#39;ll both be very large species. &quot;Er, I should let you know I&#39;ve never done anything like this with any girl,&quot; said Jeremy as he was sanitizing his arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m sure that you haven&#39;t done a lot of species changes before,&quot; said Heather dryly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, not that,&quot; said Jeremy, suddenly going a little red in the face, &quot;You see, well, I&#39;ve never had a lot of...progress with women. I didn&#39;t really date as much as you might think.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather nodded absently before getting what Jeremy was trying to say. &quot;Wait, are you telling me that you&#39;re still a virgin?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Jeremy&#39;s blush became more noticeable. &quot;If by that you mean I&#39;ve never had sexual congress with another person, then yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather clenched her jaw to keep from laughing. It did make sense, really. Jeremy was such a workaholic that he probably wouldn&#39;t have wasted a lot of time with dating. And his personality traits did make him a bit of a turn-off for most women. But Heather didn&#39;t tease Jeremy for it. &quot;Well, we&#39;ll fix that as soon as you&#39;re big enough,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess we will be,&quot; said Jeremy. Which was why he hadn&#39;t undressed, despite what it would mean for his clothes. He knew it was pointless and arbitrary, but he was still too shy to strip with a girl nearby.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is your last chance. There&#39;s no turning back from this,&quot; said Heather. While she did want Jeremy, she didn&#39;t want Jeremy to regret this forever.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know. I&#39;ve spent too long trying to find a way to turn back,&quot; said Jeremy as he prepped the syringe, &quot;But I think there&#39;s no real need for it.&quot; With practice precision, he inserted the needle into his skin and squeezed the plunger.<br />
<br />
Jeremy swore he could actually feel the serum as it went through his vascular system. There was a warming, energizing feeling that was spreading throughout his body. He clenched his hands as he felt the changes start to manifest. Already, the hair on his arms were either falling off or being swept over by scales starting to surface. Jeremy watched with fascination as his pinky fingers started to melt into his fingers, becoming completely swallowed up. His remaining fingers and thumbs started growing larger as more power went into them, the fingernails growing into black claws.<br />
<br />
Heather watched with interest as saurian features became more prominent on Jeremy&#39;s body. As hair was falling out, scales were coming in. Heather noticed that Jeremy&#39;s scales were a lot darker in color than hers, a dark grey that would look black in low light. As the last of Jeremy&#39;s hair fell out, Heather watched with interest as the <i>Carnotaurus</i>-like horns grew above his eyebrows, reaching a longer length than her own. The spines were also appearing on the back of Jeremy&#39;s scalp as they started spreading down his back, poking holes through his lab coat which was already straining.<br />
<br />
More overt saurian features were being displayed as Jeremy increased in size and mass. His feet shredded through his shoes, already clawed like Heather&#39;s. The back of his pants were giving out as a new limb was pushing through. His tail gained length and thickness, helping to better balance his body. More of his dark grey scales were exposed as his clothes were reduced to tatters. The last thing to change was his face. It remained partially human-shaped even after the scales had covered it. Then it started pushing forwards, nose melting into nostrils on the sides of his growing muzzle. His mouth grew bigger to accommodate the many sharp teeth that were popping out of his gums, not including his existing teeth changed to be more suited to tearing meat. His eyes were pushed back into deeper sockets as they became a golden yellow. To most people, this change would have been scary, but Heather was finding Jeremy increasingly more attractive.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the changes ended and Jeremy stood all the way upright. Heather noticed with a bit of envy that he was a head taller than her now, like Tyra was. Was Heather a runt of a <i>Syntixisaurus</i>? Or had she not completed growing yet? But then again, Heather&#39;s eyes were eating up Jeremy&#39;s improved physique. The dark grey scales did nothing to hide the large muscles he now possessed. His bigger horns somehow made him look more masculine. Jeremy was looking at his four-fingered hands and the claws they sported. &quot;Well,&quot; he said, his voice a little deeper, &quot;It&#39;s going to be harder to do work with these.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather grasped his hands and said softly, &quot;You&#39;ll learn to adapt. You&#39;ll have me to teach you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy looked back at Heather with a look of unmistakable attraction. He removed his right hand from her grasp and slowly stroked her face. His hand felt the spines on her scalp before grasping her left horn. Heather gave an involuntary shudder of pleasure. Her horns weren&#39;t particularly sensitive, but having a muscular male grabbing them was turning her on for some reason. Jeremy pulled Heather&#39;s head closer to his until their lips met. They kissed softly at first before they became more passionate, tongues extending into each other&#39;s mouths and dancing across the sharp teeth.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Heather couldn&#39;t take it anymore. Breaking off the kiss, she stepped away from Jeremy. She pulled off her top and dropped her pants with practiced ease. Her bra and panties soon followed, leaving her as naked as Jeremy. Her workout sessions were showing results, but Heather wished she was in better shape, her belly still a little on the flabby side.<br />
<br />
But apparently, she was attractive enough for Jeremy, his eyes locked on her scaly breasts. Heather could see his groin tightening. She had never seen a dinosaur penis. She had no idea what to expect. But she had to see it. A long pink shaft emerged from a slit in his groin. It was thick, with the girth of horse, but the end was strangely tapered at the tip. Some fleshy protuberances lined the side, smaller ones at the tip. Could they be barbs or spines? Heather knew she should be worried but for some reason that only made her more excited. It wasn&#39;t the elephantine monster that Andrew allegedly possessed (her grandmother giving too many details for Heather&#39;s comfort), but if Heather had to guess, it was the same length as a stallion&#39;s, at least 18 inches.<br />
<br />
Backing up, Heather lied down on the bed, spreading her legs so that her vagina was spread open. Jeremy recognized the invitation and approached her. He knelt on the bed, on top of Heather. Gripping his shaft, he aimed his penis as Heather&#39;s vagina. &quot;I know the basic principles,&quot; he said, &quot;But beyond that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t think. Just do,&quot; breathed Heather. With a nod, Jeremy placed his tip on her lips. With a short thrust, he pushed it through them. Heather gave a slight coo of pleasure. Jeremy wasn&#39;t her first, so there was no pain here. Once Jeremy was sure he wouldn&#39;t slip out, he grasped Heather&#39;s hips and thrust harder. Heather gasped as he filled up more of her. She arced her back a bit to push her pelvis towards Jeremy. Jeremy let out a low growl of pleasure at that.<br />
<br />
Jeremy was slow and methodical at first, moving no more than an inch inwards or outwards. Heather would have been frustrated if he wasn&#39;t filling her insides like a hand wearing a tailor-made glove. But eventually, Jeremy put more effort into it, his mating instincts telling him to claim his mate. Heather groaned with pleasure as he thrust deeper. The spines on his penis were rubbing against her inner walls in such a way that sent shivers through her whole body. She grasped her breasts to accentuate those feelings more. But then Jeremy brushed her hand away from one breasts before grasping it himself. Heather let out a louder moan at that. It was so different having someone else feel her breast.<br />
<br />
By this point, Jeremy was no longer acting like the cautious scientist conducting a first experiment. He was an alpha predator, thrusting to please his mate. Heather was thrusting back as well, making sure he was getting as much pleasure as her. One benefit to being reptiles was that his testicles were now internal and thus couldn&#39;t receive a painful smack during their mating. Heather could feel herself clenching tighter. She reached out with her legs, wrapped them around Jeremy&#39;s back, and pulled him in closer, pulsing around his shaft as she did so. Fortunately, Jeremy was close as well and she could feel his shaft expand as he reached his peak. The two of them let out a bellowing roar, such as hasn&#39;t been heard in 65 million years. Jeremy erupted inside of Heather, pushing his semen deep into her.<br />
<br />
As the climax ended, Jeremy lay down next to Heather. She spooned against her alpha, her breasts pressing against his broad chest. He put an arm protectively round her. Smiling at Jeremy, she asked, &quot;Do you think you love me now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m feeling lust, attraction, protectiveness, and the need to always stay by you,&quot; said Jeremy, &quot;I suppose that counts as love.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather just chuckled before kissing Jeremy. &quot;I love you too,&quot; she said.</p>
