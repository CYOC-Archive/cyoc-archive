<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ike though confused on some things found his changing metal abilities much more atune to the world around him. As one would expect all senses changed, scent was far better, hearing ten times that of a human, eyesight limited with fixed focus and lack of the broad range of color. The feel of his skin was like a neuronet of sensors as the slightest touch could turn his complete attention.<br />
<br />
This new ability to feel the slightest touch was both interesting and also took all his concentration. Whatever he was doing no matter what the sudden touch of even a fly made him break off his pattern of thought to turn and see what he'd felt.<br />
<br />
Taste seemed to be the only sense that dulled to some degree. He wondered at length why he would not have the same taste factors as a human. As Doctor Frank would notice his wrinkled brow and might expect his rash amount of thinking Ike tried and tried to ask questions. Even on his second day the questions came to mind but lips, tongue and jaw were then more set for gathering food than conversation.<br />
<br />
The injections continued from day to day as all in the Lab could see changes, even Ike. Soft muscle was first to change and then in spurts tendons and lastly actual bone growth. An occasional moan soon brought a short injection of pain relaxant and the subject slipped into a deep slumber.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good afternoon Ike!&quot; came the voice of Doctor Frank as Ike turned his head to face the man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your time in the confines of this Lab are over, today we move you to new surroundings. The changes happening to your frame have given me renewed hope that you will pass quite smoothly from homosapiens to equine during your next full month. It will be then allowed to let you wander about a private pasture and aquaint yourself with true equine mannerisms. Once the muscles and bone strengthen and your ingestion of a total fiber diet is accepted, then we will come to the heart of our testing. I would expect in say three months or so you will be pastured with five select mares. It will be then your choice which one to mount, mate, and make pregnant.&quot; explained the Doc.<br />
<br />
Ike listened to the words as most made their target but some slipped through the cracks his equine mind just could not understand. A calm and friendly snort was Ike's norm for answering, yes!<br />
<br />
Ike's head now almost set in true horse like form was bridled and with a rein in hand one of the Lab assistants walked him out the rear of the building. The sun beat down on Ike's darkened skin. The patches of brown hair soaked up the warmth even batter. As set by set he went the feeling of his tail swishing and the jiggle of new and larger male parts offered a giddy feeling.<br />
<br />
A good long walk and the sight of a steel gray barn loomed in front of Ike. As he followed where led the assistant led him down the long stall ilseway. The uneven bricks of the isle took much attention not to lose his balance. The young and only partially formed hoofs made clomping noises which brought a horsey laugh from the subject, Ike. The assistant laughed too as he watched the young human mind accepted and actually beginning to enjoy the new experience.<br />
<br />
Once Ike entered his box stall he was suddenly very sullen. Plopping down on his big butt he lowered his head as his round brown eyes slowly closed shut.<br />
<br />
The assistant tried to converse with Ike but the subject made no moves to answer or acknowledge. A short dash to the intercom and he called for Doctor Frank.<br />
<br />
Ike sat there thinking and remembering his family, brother, and wondering where Luke was at that moment. Second thoughts were creaping in as he sat there thinking. &quot;What if this is permanant? What is happened to Luke? I had good grades and big plans but never did the desire to be a stallion at stud enter in! Oh how I wish I'd never answered those big money promises, we were all set for the next two years anyway!&quot; pondered Ike.<br />
<br />
&quot;Second thoughts?&quot; asked a familiar voice.<br />
<br />
Ike looked up and with the Lab assistant standing near the Doc stood leaning over the stall's wooden rail. A simple shake of the head to signify he agreed was all that the Doctor needed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't wish to be tough on you at this moment but facts are facts! Once the first injection entered your blood stream the ultimate and projected change would occur. It was the number of injections which hurried the changes along as the serum built up inside you. Now the injections are done and the work of your body to complete the planned adjustments is left to be completed.  I can understand your thoughts and the loss of family, however once the mating ritual begins those memories will take a back seat to your personal desires. You are the nineth to be so tested in this way. All but two of those tested returned to human life and family. One, a mare and female human was so enthrawled with the sexual feeling of being a brod mare she was allowed due to lack of family to remain here as the horse she became. It was our only mistake to accept into the testing a older man. A man well past the growth spurts known by the young. It was him that we had to keep against his will! As his body changed the serums made him go raving mad. He tried to kill himself four times! It was after he'd been a pony stallion for five months that his equine instincts started to fight for control of mind and body. A remarkable and fine sire he was as the mares almost enjoyed his calm manner and considerate way he mounted them. No doubt due to his number of years in a service business and being consoling to his customers. Yet as he fought for dominance in his own body the mental human thought patterns went into deep depression. He's here today, in stall fourty one! If in time you trot over to see him don't enter the stall, he's raving mad and will try to kill you!&quot; warned the Doctor as Ike cocked his head trying to listen and remember.</p>
