<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Well let&#39;s get this out of the way. Your girlfriend is literally an anthromorphic fox. Fox paws for feet, fox tail, fox head, claws, and fur. The whole nine yards. It was a few days after the carnival that Molly transformed into this. It was a shock for both of you. But you both have adjusted pretty well to it after 8 months you believe. Oh you actually forgot. Molly is an actually a male fox; tod or reynard (which ever one you want to use; both are correct). That was a huge shock for both of you. More than Molly becoming an anthromorphic fox. <br />
Molly came downstairs wearing a blue tee shirt & grey cutoff shorts; no shoes or socks of course on account of his paws. He hasn&#39;t worn any footwear since he changed into a fox. Not like he needed to because paw pads are better then any shoes ever could be. [God it&#39;s weird Molly is male now. Not as much as Molly being a fox... but still.] You thought. You were eating breakfast at the table in the kitchen & reading an article on your phone. Molly commented / complained about his clothes being uncomfortable with his fur. You without really thinking about it or looking at him said &quot;Then just remove them.&quot; Soon you heard the other chair move & all that. You aren&#39;t sure why you did that moment but you looked up from your phone. You were shocked to see Molly&#39;s chest without a shirt covering it. You looked around & saw Molly&#39;s shirt & shorts on the floor. &quot;You&#39;re naked Molly?!&quot; You yelled shocked. &quot;You got a problem with that?&quot; Molly questioned. &quot;Why are you naked?&quot; You questioned. &quot;I don&#39;t need to wear clothes.&quot; You tried to argue that but Molly growled (something he started doing when angry) &quot;I don&#39;t need to wear anything.&quot; You sighed &quot;Fine. Be nude.&quot; You knew Molly was right. [Everyone thinks of Molly as an animal anyways. Might as well let him embrace it.] You thought. &quot;Oh before I forget. I had my name legally changed to Mal yesterday.&quot; Surprised you asked &quot;Mal? Why?&quot; Molly now Mal answered &quot;Mal is a male name. Molly isn&#39;t.&quot; You sighed &quot;Fine Mal.&quot; He was correct you figured. No sense in arguing it sense he had done it. You finished breakfast & got up to put your dishes in the sink. You left the kitchen with Mal following you. You informed Mal you were going to the grocery store to get a few things. Mal said he&#39;d come with. You reminded him what happened last time. They gave him crap about being an animal. They told him & pointed out the clearly posted sign on the door that read &#39;No Animals Allowed. Unless Service Animals.&#39; They told him he wasn&#39;t allowed in the store because of that. And clearly is no service animal. &quot;I&#39;ll stay outside of the store.&quot; Mal told you walking out the door behind you. You turned around & yelled angry at Mal realizing it &quot;Mal!&quot; Mal growled back &quot;I told you I can be nude sense I&#39;m a fox. An animal. I don&#39;t have to wear anything.&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t leave your clothes laying on the floor! Wear clothes or don&#39;t! But be a damn slob with your clothes!&quot; Mal growling still went back into the house. He picked up his shirt & shorts & tossed them on the couch. Mal came back out growling &quot;You happy?&quot; You answered &quot;Yes.&quot; You locked the house up as you heard Mal get in the car. You then went over to the car & got in too. A few minutes later in the car...You looked at Mal & questioned &quot;Are you going to wear anything anymore?&quot; Mal replied &quot;Not sure. I feel right in only my fur here.&quot; A few later after that...&quot;Mal can I ask you something?&quot; You asked. &quot;I want to stay this way.&quot; he answered. Shocked & confused you asked &quot;What?&quot; Mal tried to explain &quot;You don&#39;t understand what it is for me. I now pick sounds & smells I never could before. My paw pads are better than any footwear could ever be. It feels great to have the wind blow on my fur. Stuff tastes better. And the absolute liberating freedom that I get from being an animal. I am nude right now and I can&#39;t be arrested for public nudity because I&#39;m not human.&quot; You could tell he was happy. &quot;You love being a fox don&#39;t you?&quot; You asked. Mal nodded after a few of thinking &quot;I do. I really do actually.&quot; You soon arrived at the grocery store. You both got out & Mal surprised you by grabbing you & kissing you. It felt weird to you having his snout on your lips; really hairy. During your kissing you accidentally touched his fox junk with your hand. Mal said &quot;You&#39;re touching my junk.&quot; You said defensively &quot;It was an accident. If you weren&#39;t nude right now it wouldn&#39;t of happened.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s ok. It&#39;s fine.&quot; He told you. Getting more defensive &quot;I&#39;m not gay.&quot; Mal replied &quot;Didn&#39;t think I was sense I used to be a woman. But...&quot; You looked down to see his vulpine penis exiting his sheath. &quot;Oh my.&quot; You whispered surprised. &quot;And you clearly find me attractive as a fox. You still touching my junk.&quot; Mal replied. You still were touching his fox junk. You didn&#39;t know how to react to that. Mal whispered sexy in your ear &quot;You are attracted to me. You are attracted to me because I&#39;m a fox.&quot; You now realized you were getting an erection. And Mal&#39;s penis was fully out now. Mal whispered sexy as a bit of precum leaked out of his red fox penis &quot;I think I wouldn&#39;t be wearing clothes anymore.&quot; You told him firmly &quot;You won&#39;t be wear anything anymore fox. I forbid it.&quot; Mal whispered sexy &quot;Ok my alpha.&quot; You quickly informed him &quot;Alpha is a wolf thing not a fox thing.&quot; Mal licked you on the nose & said &quot;Doesn&#39;t matter to this fox.&quot; He let go of you & then said playfully (you think) &quot;Maybe you should get a collar for this fox.&quot; You playfully said back &quot;I think I might.&quot; You then headed into the store. As you walked around getting the groceries you paused at the pet aisle. You thought you maybe should get a collar for him. You then began to wonder what kind of collar would look good on the fox.</p>
