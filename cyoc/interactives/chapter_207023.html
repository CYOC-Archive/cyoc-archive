<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jackson saw a brown box sitting on the front porch. &#39;I didn&#39;t order anything...&#39; he thought as he picked it up. Tossing it around, he noticed his dad&#39;s name on the label. A bit of a grin covered his face. &#39;Birthday present?&#39; then shook it hearing something rattle inside. &quot;Birthday present,&quot; he confirmed as he stepped inside. &quot;Since my birthday&#39;s in a few days... What&#39;s the harm in at least looking?&quot;<br />
<br />
He cut open the tape as gently as he could and pulled out the brown packing paper. However, he rolled his eyes at the contents. There was a full on wrestling singlet in there in the blue and gold colors of his college. &quot;C&#39;mon dad...&quot; Jackson knew full well that his father wanted him to do sports. Any sport at all. Even soccer! But Jackson couldn&#39;t see it as anything other than an absolute waste of time. Even worse, he was terrible at it. With his thin frame and lack of motivation, he could never get himself to even try.<br />
<br />
Even worse, when he pulled out the singlet it had to be made for someone nearly twice his size. Jackson didn&#39;t know much about wrestling, but he&#39;d seen enough pictures of guys online and that thing was tight. Oh, he knew how tight it should look on them. A smile crossed his face again as he thought about some of the videos he&#39;d watched online. &quot;Stop it,&quot; he scolded himself. The smile didn&#39;t fade in the slightest though.<br />
<br />
&quot;What am I thinking?&quot; he asked himself as he held up the singlet. Suddenly, he had a desire to try it on. Even if he knew he wasn&#39;t ever going to be a wrestler, didn&#39;t mean he didn&#39;t want to try out a fantasy. &quot;This thing is way too big!&quot; he tried reasoning himself out of it, but the desire only seemed to amplify. &quot;Damn it,&quot; he cursed as he gathered up the box and singlet and rushed into his room. He closed the door and locked it. His dad wasn&#39;t supposed to be home for a while, but that didn&#39;t mean he wanted to get caught. <br />
<br />
Jackson tossed the empty box near his door and then stripped down into nothing. For a second he looked at his thin frail little body. Then gave it a flex. Nothing changed. He had always been small. Small enough that if he went out for the wrestling team, he could have won just because no one else was in his bracket. But even the coach told him that it wasn&#39;t a good idea. <br />
<br />
None of that mattered now. He could still at least have a little bit of a fantasy. Holding up the singlet to his body, it really was too big. The stretchy material wouldn&#39;t even touch him in most places. But that didn&#39;t stop Jackson. He stepped inside the wrestling uniform. Just as he thought, it didn&#39;t cling to him at all. The straps holding it up kept sliding over his thin shoulders. Still, that didn&#39;t stop him from trying to flex. Even if his arms looked like limp noodles, he still held them up and flexed them with all his might. <br />
<br />
A smile crossed Jackson&#39;s face as he went into another pose. &quot;Man! This feels good!&quot; suddenly he realized why so many gym bros liked to pose in front of the mirror. It didn&#39;t matter that he had next to nothing to show, it felt so much fun. However, other ideas were starting to worm their way into his head. He started to pose more like the wrestlers he&#39;d seen on the mat. His arms hung low in front of him as he tried to mimic the starting position. &quot;That&#39;s not right...&quot; he corrected it by holding his hands out in front of him.<br />
<br />
What Jackson didn&#39;t notice was his shoulders starting to widen. Thick mounds of muscle were starting to grow where none had been before. The straps were stuck in the crevice between his shoulders and neck. Jackson continued to play wrestler. Each movement became more natural as muscle started to grow more on his body. His biceps quickly filled out, rounding out to the size of softball when flexed. He smiled as he stood back up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did I think this was too big?&quot; he wondered as he turned to the side and flexed his arm again. Watching the bicep bulge only made his smile grow larger. Even if the turn was more to check out his thick chest pressing hard against the straps holding the singlet up. Jackson&#39;s hand naturally ran down his body over his defined abs and thin waist. The legging no longer hung around his knees, rather they clung tightly to his thick quads. Almost feeling too tight as they stretched against the hard muscles. &quot;No way... This would have been so good for my last bout...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackson naturally took a starting position as memories of a wrestling match just a few days prior filled his head. His arms were loose but ready as they swayed in front of him. And he could easily picture the other guy. The handsome jock was just as well muscled as he was. Thick but lean muscles covered his body just like him. He cocked a smile as he pretended the referee said go. Jackson dove onto his bed clutching his body pillow and pretending it was the other man. <br />
<br />
He flipped the pillow back down onto the bed. His cock throbbed with excitement. Just reliving that experience made it all the better as he plunged down into it. Jackson wanted to do this so badly to the other man. To feel his hard cock push into the tight ass of his opponent. To make him squirm and writhe on the mat as his cock slid deep inside, well past the man&#39;s prostate. Jackson bit into his pillow as his massive cock and balls churned with pleasure. Each time he slid his cock against the pillow, another writhing pleasure rocketed through him. His body twisted and turned, grabbing his dark blue sheets with all his might. <br />
<br />
Jackson let out a gasp as he finished. &quot;Holy shit...&quot; his deep voice resounded as he was breathing harder than usual. That was basically a full on sprint that he went through. Slowly he started to sit back up. But decided it might be better to fall on his back and bask in the glow of his release. He was still completely unaware of the changes happening around him. Wrestling trophies and medals started to line his shelves and bookcases. Dumb bells were laid against his wall next to his computer. There was a more distinct musk of sweat and sex rather than just his cum. <br />
<br />
&quot;God damn... No wonder coach makes me masturbate before a round... Don&#39;t know if I&#39;d contain myself if I didn&#39;t,&quot; a distant smile filled his face as he thought about his opponents and teammates. He knew full well than an erection meant a possible disqualification. And it was never as fun if the other guy felt it. They would always get all weird about it.<br />
<br />
A ring of his phone brought him out of his daze. &quot;Hey bud. There should be a package on the door when you get home. Don&#39;t open it. I&#39;ll be home shortly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackson felt his heart drop as he looked down at the singlet. &quot;Oh shit...&quot; he cursed as a very clear, obvious and large stain covered a large portion of the singlet.</p>
