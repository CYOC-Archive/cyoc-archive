<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Sofya’s father left earlier that morning, his first stop was to see the captain of the track and field team, Daniel. Though the wizard knew that Daniel was not intelligent or capable enough to possess the ring, he wanted to definitively rule out the possibility on the off handed chance that Sofya wasn’t lying to him. It would also be a good idea to check up on his arm and make sure he didn’t tell the staff at the hospital where he was bitten and by what.<br />
<br />
The wizard had the ability to levitate, so he moved his way through the air at a slight elevation. He would quickly put himself back on the ground if someone else would come into his path. Sofya’s father quickly nodded, as he exchanged greetings with fellow neighbors on his journey, irritated by how many times this was happening to him. It was holding up his passage and he hoped it would stop soon. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, he made his way to the address listed for Daniel in the “Classified Teenager Phone Book.”<br />
<br />
Stopping in front of the house, the wizard noted the nicely manicured lawn and modern looking house, one that seemed to have only recently been built. <br />
<br />
“Boy must come from some money” the wizard thought to himself. “Luckily, I won’t be in this town for much longer, so I don’t have to worry about him or his parents.”<br />
<br />
The wizard also noticed that there were no cars in the driveway, though he sensed that there was a presence inside the house. <br />
<br />
“That must mean Daniel is home alone” he thought to himself. “That’ll make this that much easier.”<br />
<br />
The wizard quietly made his way to the side door and gently turned on the knob. Noticing it was locked, the wizard closed his eyes and used his mental powers to unlock the door from the inside. When he heard it snap, the wizard quietly turned the doorknob open and made his way inside. Shutting the door behind him, the wizard levitated up several flights of stairs before hearing noises coming from Daniel’s bedroom.<br />
<br />
When Daniel had fled from Sofya’s house in a panic yesterday, he and now former friend Duane immediately made their way to the emergency room. Confronted with a barrage of questions as doctors worked to save his arm from amputation, Daniel avoided giving details about the origins of the bite. It was as if something inside him was purposely refusing to cooperate with the line of questioning, even when the police became involved. Finally, after multiple surgeries, a blood transfusion, several stitches and an oversized cast, Daniel’s arm was saved. It would function again, but he would be required to stay home for a week to recover and would have to step down as the captain of the track and field team due to his inability to engage in any sports for the foreseeable future. <br />
<br />
Despite the large and suffocating cast blocking his ability to move freely, Daniel still managed to get a young girl into his room to make out with him. A classmate from their trigonometry class, which Daniel was failing, the two of them engaged in a passionate make out session. The girl had her way with him, as she straddled him in a chair and kissed him passionately. Daniel had told her a sob story about being bitten by a wolf he couldn’t find again in the woods. She felt sorry for him, even though she knew he was a jerk at times, and agreed to come over to keep him company. She wasn’t sure if she was going to get laid or not, but it didn’t matter. This was erotic enough. <br />
<br />
Feeling a sense of control over Daniel, the girl began to paw at his growing erection. Daniel was extremely turned on and ready to let her give him head. Before he could get it, his door violently swung wide open.<br />
<br />
From the other side of the door, Sofya’s father had listened in to the passionate make out session between Daniel and the other girl.<br />
<br />
“My daughter isn’t the only whore I around here, I see” the wizard thought to himself. <br />
<br />
Getting sick of being a purveyor to this intense kissing session, Sofya’s father burst the door open to a startled Daniel, helpless as his boner throbbed in his pants. The girl on his lap turned around and screamed as she jumped off of him, while Sofya’s father lunged for her lover. Completely defenseless, Daniel gasped and grunted, as Sofya’s father applied pressure on his neck that seemed to weaken him and left him breathless. <br />
<br />
“You boy” Sofya’s father hissed to him quietly. “I need to have a word with you.”<br />
<br />
Daniel continued to suffocate, as Sofya’s father’s grip got tighter around his neck. <br />
<br />
“Did you tell the doctors yesterday that my dog bit your arm?” Sofya’s father asked him sternly.<br />
<br />
Daniel made an attempt to shake his head no.<br />
<br />
“Good” Sofya’s father replied coldly. “Now, I have one very simple question for you.”<br />
<br />
Daniel looked at him pleadingly, nodding as he hoped that Sofya’s father would let go of his neck soon. He feared for his life, but also felt embarrassed in front of the girl he invited over to his house. Here he was, this supposed tough guy, getting wrung out by a man twice his size and age. He felt like a pussy, but tried his best not to show it. It was proving to be impossible. <br />
<br />
“The Ruggeri ring” Sofya’s father continued sternly. “Do you have the ring?”<br />
<br />
Daniel shook his head no, hoping to be put down soon. Sofya’s father eased his grip on his neck, as he asked another question.<br />
<br />
“Do you happen to know who might be in possession of it?”<br />
<br />
Daniel had trouble thinking, but tried his best to answer the question. He went through all of the nerds in school, quickly ruling out most of them until….<br />
<br />
“Mi…” Daniel squeaked out, unable to fully speak.<br />
<br />
“What?” Sofya’s father asked coldly, as he loosened his grip on Daniel’s neck.<br />
<br />
“Mich….ael Scavolini is into that magic shit” Daniel squawked out. “Maybe he has it.”<br />
<br />
“Just what I thought” Sofya’s father thought to himself, as he let Daniel go to slink back in his chair. <br />
<br />
Sofya’s father stormed out of the room, as the girl rushed to Daniel’s side. <br />
<br />
“Oh my God” she said to him with a noticeable worry in her tone, as she kissed him all over his face. “Are you ok? Who was that?”<br />
<br />
“It’s nothing” Daniel replied nervously, relieved that it was over. <br />
<br />
Daniel couldn’t believe this had just happened to him, especially in front of a girl he liked to fuck. It made him seem weak, in contrast to his image as a strong, tough guy. Hopefully, if Michael, and maybe even Freddy, had something to do with it, they’d pay for this humiliation he had to endure. Thankfully for him, no one else in school saw it, so Daniel was apt to pretending it never happened. <br />
<br />
Leaving Daniel’s house in a huff, the wizard levitated his way to the address for Michael in the book. Slightly careless, he didn’t notice that at least one person eyed him curiously, as the neighbor could swear that the man was levitating. Deducing it to their eyes playing tricks on, the neighbor didn’t say anything about it, fortunately for the wizard. In his haste to find Michael, the wizard was acting carelessly. It would cost him in the end. <br />
<br />
After a number of minutes passed as he made his way through town, the wizard stood before Michael’s house. He saw cars in the driveway and could sense that someone was home. He also felt the presence of the ring, as it was likely was left in the house. The wizard noticed something else as well.<br />
<br />
“The boy isn’t home” the wizard thought to himself.<br />
<br />
The wizard had an important decision to make. He could either barge in, not knowing who was on the other side, and steal the ring outright. Or, the wizard could try to find Michael, command him to summon it, and then kill him. After quickly weighing the pros and cons, the wizard made a hasty decision.<br />
<br />
“I have a feeling I know where he is” the wizard thought to himself.<br />
<br />
Levitating back in the air, the wizard made his way over to his own house. When he arrived, Sofya’s father settled down on the ground and slowly walked up to the open front door.<br />
<br />
“That’s odd” he thought to himself. <br />
<br />
Silently making his way up to the front door, Sofya’s father could hear a conversation in progress. <br />
<br />
“How did you know I was jacking him off just now?” Sofya’s father could hear his daughter ask someone.<br />
<br />
“Because” the voice of Michael replied “I’ve been listening in to your house since I came over yesterday. I bugged your house and have recorded the conversations your father has been having with you about his desire to take the ring I possess.”<br />
<br />
“Of course” Sofya’s father thought to himself. “That’s why I sensed someone was listening to me yesterday.”<br />
<br />
Sofya’s father watched as Michael popped a bug off a painting in the living room and showed it Sofya. <br />
<br />
“These bugs” Michael continued “are the most sophisticated in the world.”<br />
<br />
“How did he manage to get his hands on those?” Sofya’s father thought to himself quizzically.<br />
<br />
“They can record just about anything with crystal clear quality” Michael continued. “We have confessions from your father on tape. I have other rooms in your house bugged as well.”<br />
<br />
“That’s all I needed to hear” Sofya’s father thought to himself, as he stepped into the entryway. <br />
<br />
“Sofya” Freddy said to Sofya “We don’t have a lot of time. We’re all in big danger. Your father is probably going to come back here soon and….”<br />
<br />
“That’s quite enough” Sofya’s father called to the three teenagers sternly. <br />
<br />
They turned to see Sofya’s father, glaring at them angrily.<br />
<br />
“I’ve been looking all over for you, Michael Scavolini” Sofya’s father continued curtly. “I believe you have something in your possession that belongs to me.”<br />
<br />
“It doesn’t belong to you!” Michael replied sharply. “You stole it from the National Museum in Rome and I have proof! Now hand the other rings over to me before the police arrive!”<br />
<br />
“I’ll be the one doing the demanding around here.”<br />
<br />
Sofya’s father held out his hand, as he lifted Michael off the ground and choked him telepathically. Michael struggled to break free of the wizard’s psychic grasp, as Freddy and Sofya looked on in stunned silence. <br />
<br />
“Hand over the Ruggeri ring to me now” Sofya’s father commanded in a hissed tone.<br />
<br />
Michael continued to choke, as she struggled to break free of the telekinetic grasp. <br />
<br />
“Hand it over” Sofya’s father pressed again.<br />
<br />
“Daddy” Sofya called to him meekly.<br />
<br />
Michael continued to struggle, averting his gaze from the wizard’s eyes. The wizard, despite all efforts, could not get Michael to teleport the ring to his house. Releasing his telepathic grasp, Michael fell to the floor with an aggressive thud, as Freddy rushed over to protect him.<br />
<br />
“That’s odd” Sofya’s father thought to himself, as he looked upon Freddy trying to cover his boyfriend. “Why couldn’t he teleport the ring here? I was able to break though his feeble mental defenses and yet, he didn’t bring it to me. It’s as if he couldn’t bring it to me. It’s as if….”<br />
<br />
Sofya’s father paused for a moment, as he stared at the barren Freddy before him, removed of all decency in his nude state. <br />
<br />
“Unless” he continued in his thoughts “that other boy is bonded to it.”<br />
<br />
Sofya’s father held his hand out again, as he levitated Freddy off the floor. Michael grabbed onto Freddy, as he tried to pull him back to the floor. All Michael could do was dangle off of Freddy’s naked leg, as he was being choked by the wizard telepathically in the air. After some aggressive mental prodding, Sofya’s father was able to tap into the naked boy’s mind and command him to deliver the ring. After a flash of lightning struck into the room, Sofya was flung to the wall and then the floor, as the Ruggeri ring appeared before them. <br />
<br />
Seeing the ring again in person after so long made Sofya’s father beam with joy. At long last, after two and a half centuries of trying, here before him was the Ruggeri ring at long last. Dropping Freddy and Michael to the floor, the wizard telepathically moved the ring to his grasp, as it seemed to give off a resistance. Unable to fight off the magical powers of the wizard, the ring was snatched into his hands, as he marveled at it gleefully. <br />
<br />
“At long last” Sofya’s father said aloud. “After nearly two and a half centuries of searching, I am once again in possession of the Ruggeri ring. My long lost Ruggeri ring.”<br />
<br />
Holding up the ring to the air, Sofya’s father continued. <br />
<br />
“With this power, I will be able break into the museum once again and steal the other two rings. With all five rings in my possession, I will become one of the most powerful beings in the universe. I can change all of humanity into my personal pets and hold entire control of the known universe.”<br />
<br />
Sofya’s father chuckled loudly, as Sofya looked up at her father in fear and Freddy and Michael looked up at him in disgust. <br />
<br />
“You can’t do that!” Sofya yelled. “I won’t let you!”<br />
<br />
“You have no choice in the matter, little girl” her father replied. <br />
<br />
Like magic, she was levitated into his armpit and put in a chokehold. <br />
<br />
“You are coming with me” Sofya’s father said to her. “And you.”<br />
<br />
Sofya’s father pointed to Michael, as he levitated him into his armpit and held him in a tight chokehold. <br />
<br />
“I’ll need you for this. And as you for you.”<br />
<br />
Sofya’s father took the ring and pointed it at Freddy.<br />
<br />
“I’ll be back for you later” he continued. “Or should I say, I’ll be back for Fido later.”<br />
<br />
In an instant, a chill washed over Freddy, as he once again was forced back onto his hands and knees. In a matter of seconds, Freddy body morphed into that of Fido the German Shepherd. Fur raced across his body, as his arms and legs mutated into the standing position of a dog. His senses rapidly enhanced and Fido returned once more. After he briefly shook his furry body, Fido was unsure of how the transformation could happen without being turned on first. Barking loudly, Fido raced to the front door, as Sofya’s father levitated out of the house.<br />
<br />
“Freddy help us!” Michael and Sofya called to him<br />
<br />
Fido, despite his speed and best efforts, was unable to make it out of the house in time before the door slammed shut. With a loud clack, the door was locked. Fido pawed at the door, before he sank onto the floor below to deal with the inevitable. He was stuck in Sofya’s house, unable to leave it. <br />
<br />
Fido, in desperation……</p>
