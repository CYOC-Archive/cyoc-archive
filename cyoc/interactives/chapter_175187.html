<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your ears perk up, and you hear a ringing sound. Turning around you noticed it was coming from a purse, your purse. You looked inside and noticed it was your cell phone, and the person who was calling you was a male lion labelled &quot;Hunky Hubby Husband&quot; which made you blush a bit. You gulped and took the call raising the phone to your ear,&quot;Uh... Hello?&quot; Upon hearing your new feminine voice you couldn&#39;t help but blush a bit at first, until your mind was taken away from it all as you heard a male voice on the other end.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jenny, how&#39;s my sweet baby girl doing~? Big Davey has finally cleared out a room here, so that you can move on in~&quot; A deep voice and what sounds like purring come through, and admittedly you felt a bit wet upon hearing it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I erm.... thanks....?&quot; You replied, gulping a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on over sweetie, let&#39;s celebrate a little, and today it can just be you and me~&quot; He replied,&quot;I&#39;ll make things extra romantic for the both of us if you want~&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Erm... o-okay, I-I&#39;ll be right down then uh....D-Davey,&quot; You replied to which he replied,&quot;Can&#39;t wait~&quot;<br />
<br />
Davey then hung up and you felt a million emotions swirling around in your stomach. Looking down at your hand you noticed you had a wedding ring on your finger, and around the band were the names of every member in the harem. In total, there looked like there was four including you,&quot;Adrian, Bella, Jenny, Maddie&quot; then on top in big bold letters was written,&quot;David&quot;. With little to no choice considering you had no idea what else you were going to do in this weird new world you created, you turned off your computer and grabbed your purse, pulling up David&#39;s address on the gps, and from what it looked like it was just a brisk walk from where you normally lived so you decided to jog there.<br />
<br />
Looking around the neighborhood you saw a lot less houses than normal, then again most homes looked like they were replaced with large and expensive mansions, no doubt most males and their harems lived in such luxury, and at various houses you spotted other females doing yard work, some walking alongside a male, and others sunbathing happily. Your phone would notify that you had arrived at the destination and you noticed you were standing before one of various large estates in the neighborhood, and it was almost daunting for you to walk up to the door and ring the doorbell.<br />
<br />
A few minutes pass and the door is answered by a female lioness like yourself, and the moment she sees you she pulled you into a hug and purred before kissing you on the cheek. &quot;Welcome home Jenny~ David is so excited for you, he&#39;s even started referring to himself in the third person again, I think he intends for you and him to have some fun tonight~&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;U-Uh...... w-what do you m-mean by fun?&quot; You replied a bit nervously when you noticed that you felt a bump rubbing against your belly, and you peered down and realized that this female&#39;s breasts were large and swollen, and her stomach was even more so, she appeared to be at least four months pregnant. She also had a cute collar around her neck with the name &quot;Adrian&quot; printed on the side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-You uh.... are pregnant... A-Adrian...?&quot; You muttered which made the female giggle,&quot;You&#39;ve noticed hm~? Heheh, yes, I&#39;m almost a month in. I would be mad at you, then again you have been living by yourself and with your parents no less, plus with your school and tests I completely understand that your focus can&#39;t be on your family the whole time. I mean you just turned 19, but now that you&#39;ve graduated, you can stay here with us~&quot; Adrian purred and nuzzled your cheek and placed her hands on your hips.<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem like you are doing fine,&quot; You blushed feeling surprised but then you remembered that you noticed lions have smaller gestation periods than humans on your monitor, it now only takes about three and a half months for a female to give birth to a litter, and of course... since it was a litter bellies would be bigger with kids.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am, not too bad for a milf in training wouldn&#39;t you say Jenny~?&quot; Adrian giggled teasing you by striking a sexy pose before she took your hand,&quot;Bella and Maddie are out running some errands. David wanted me to let you know that you would be helping me out and pampering me through this pregnancy, which is fair. He doesn&#39;t want all of us to be gravid at once so we will take seats alongside him and have Bella and Maddie take care of us for a change. But for the time being you&#39;ll just be helping me with tasks I cannot perform so easily.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I uh.... o-okay,&quot; You replied blushing, somewhat glad the chronivac adjusted your age a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways, let&#39;s not keep Davey waiting, just follow me,&quot; Adrian replied smiling before taking your hand, closing the door behind you after she guided you inside, before leading you down the hallway.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-So uh.... where is David now?&quot; You asked as you looked around, admiring all of the expensive things on the walls and inside the mansion of your new husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;He is in your new room, and it&#39;s right next to his room too, and the game room, so you&#39;ll be enjoying a lot of his scent,&quot; Adrian purred,&quot;Lucky you~&quot;<br />
<br />
Adrian took you into a room that had a bar, a pool table, and a large tv probably meant for watching sports plus you saw a few gaming consoles hooked up to it. You blinked twice and slowly nodded to Adrian in response,&quot;Y-Yeah.... lucky me....&quot;<br />
<br />
Adrian then giggled and opened a door, and gestured you inside,&quot;Right this way Jenny, please tell me all about what happens sweetie~&quot;<br />
<br />
You slowly nodded and walked on inside the room, and you saw a nice large and gorgeous looking bedroom. No closet or dressers of course, but there was a desk in the corner and a vanity on the opposite side of that. There was a private bathroom and a few windows that were currently closed. Then in the middle of the room was a nice large queen sized bed, and laying there with a wide toothy grin on his face, erect cock in hand, and licking his lips was your husband. Before you or him could say anything Adrian closed the door behind you, leaving you alone with him and you gulped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why hello there sweet Jenny~ Looking as sweet and sexy as ever I see, come here and lay with me in your new room sweetie~&quot; He said purring, patting the spot next to him on the bed.<br />
<br />
You gulped and nodded, slowly making your way over to the bed and laying down next to him. As you did this, David reached out snd hugged you close, and you immediately picked up on his masculine odor reeking off of his body which made you blush. <br />
<br />
David then slowly stroked your cheek and smiled before licking your forehead,&quot;How do you like your new room~? Better than your other one~?&quot;<br />
<br />
You blushed heavily and slowly nodded,&quot;Y-Yeah....&quot; You felt yourself growing wet and a bit heated between your legs and bit your lip, and you couldn&#39;t help but think back to what Adrian said at the entrance, &quot;S-So uh..... do you plant to uh.... b-breed me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, what gave it away~? Was it the way I was awaiting for you on the bed~? Was it my musk, and the sight of my man meat enticing your body into heat~? I can smell it on you sweetheart, then again, only at your consent. Since you are young and still a virgin I will take things nice slow and easy~&quot; David purred stroking your cheek still.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I uh.... A-Adrian said... you were in... th-that kind of mood.... and recognized a few tells....&quot; You replied and he nodded.<br />
<br />
He nodded and moved his hands down your body, gently rubbing and groping your ass, and stroking one of your breasts. &quot;Well.... what do you think~? My oldest at the age of 24 and my youngest at 19, pregnant together~ I figured it would be a nice way to spend our one year anniversary, and yes... I remembered, and no... if you forgot then I don&#39;t mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I..... erm... m-might have...&quot; You muttered in response and he nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe then I can turn on the tv, and you can give me one if your famous massages, or perform a kinky fetish or two for me as a way of apology~?&quot; He purred and you blushed heavily.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I....&quot; You weren&#39;t sure what to say but with his musk only turning you on more and more, you slowly found yourself nodding,&quot;O-Okay.... you.... your stroking feels so... mmmm~ nice~&quot; You began purring yourself uncontrollably from your husband&#39;s gentle, but effective hand movements, stimulating your body to no end.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll let you choose what you wish to do, but no matter if I take you now, we will be doing it again later~ Adrian volunteered to make us dinner and deliver it here for us, so why not consider this a small appetizer~&quot; David purred and you nodded, looking over your husband&#39;s muscular body, damn he sure looked like he worked out a lot, and he definitely smelled like he got out of the gym rather recently. That musk of his was so strong and you just wanted it all over your body and in you.... gaah! What do you do?</p>
