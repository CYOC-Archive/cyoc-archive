<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Somewhat reluctantly, Amy reached out and took the half-empty can from her friend. She hefted it in her hand, glancing once more at the cartoon goth on its surface. She lifted it to her lips and took a sip.<br />
<br />
Her eyes widened at the taste before they rolled upward, her lids fluttering at its strength. Without even thinking about it, the can was back at her mouth and she was downing it with deep gulps. The carbonation slid down her throat, pooling in her stomach before bubbling outward. Amy threw her free arm out against the soda machine, steadying herself while the bubbly sensations traveled down to the ends of her fingers and toes.<br />
<br />
Lina smiled at her friend&#39;s obvious enjoyment of the soda, or at least attempted to. What felt like a broad grin to her only displayed as a smirk on lips that were steadily darkening as a deep purple coloration overtook them. She ran her tongue across them absentmindedly, echoes of the grape soda flavor playing across her tastebuds.<br />
<br />
Lina shivered slightly as a wave of vertigo passed briefly over her. The floor seemed to move away from her as she began to grow in height. Starting at 5&#39;2&quot;, only a couple of inches shorter than Amy, she quickly rose to match her friend. Lina swayed, scrunching her toes in shoes that now felt a size too small. She hiccupped quite loudly and her body pressed up and out again, raising her height another two inches, her body growing thicker and firmer.<br />
<br />
Lina brought a hand tipped with purple nails to her lips, her face whitening in embarrassment at the noise she had made. The whitening didn&#39;t seem to be stopping though, the color steadily drained from her face before traveling downward. Her skin took on a uniformly white hue, looking as if she hadn&#39;t been in direct sunlight for the better part of a decade. Blemishes disappeared as her skin became wholly smooth.<br />
<br />
Pale fingers still pressed firmly against her mouth, Lina felt another hiccup wrack her body. Despite holding it in she lifted in height again, more vigorously than before. At least four inches were added to Lina&#39;s height, and she showed no signs of stopping. The gothifying girl moaned slightly behind her fingers, half in pleasure and half in discomfort as her swelling frame pressed against her clothes.<br />
<br />
Her breasts enlarged from A-Cups to hefty Cs, swelling against her now too-small t-shirt as her bra disappeared. Her ass bubbled outward, the seams of her shorts creaking as they struggled to contain her milky cheeks. She scrunched her toes again as she felt a rustling in her shoes. Her soles and arches stretched outward in size, and something was going on with her socks. Their fabric writhed about and between her toes as if it was alive, becoming softer. Despite herself she found she enjoyed the sensations very much.<br />
<br />
Amy had been lost in the flavors and sensations of the soda for a solid few minutes now. They receded for the moment, and her eyes shot open at the strange combination of sounds emanating from her friend. She looked over, and found her eyes popping even wider at the sight of her embiggened friend.<br />
<br />
From short and scrawny to tall and voluptuous, Amy hardly would have recognized her friend if not for her familiar (if paler) face. Even that was changing slightly now though. As she looked on, Lina&#39;s jawline became a little sharper; her eyelashes darker and thicker; her lips fuller and poutier. Amy noticed a dark spot forming at the top of Lina&#39;s brown hair. Inky black tendrils writhed their way through her friend&#39;s locks, inching toward their tips.<br />
<br />
Lina hiccupped once more, and again she shot up in height, even faster and taller this time as another half foot was piled on. Girth and muscle wrapped around her limbs as she expanded to fit her new size. Her now-shapely legs trembled and she wobbled dangerously. She felt like a giant at her new height of 6&#39;2&quot;, her clothes barely seemed able to hang on. The nipples of her new D-Cups buzzed as they pressed insistently out against her shirt, which looked more like a crop-top now.<br />
<br />
Amy found her eyes having to travel upward as she observed this latest round of changes, the grape tingles playing about her tongue forgotten as she stared with an open mouth at her friend. <br />
<br />
Lina&#39;s hair finished its transition into a deep, shiny black color, yet even as Amy watched, it seemed to shrivel upwards. It shrank from its original, mid-back length, to a messy bob about her shoulders. Her bangs shot up even higher, coming to rest in a loosely flat line along her eyebrows.<br />
<br />
The rustling that Lina felt in her socks had continued, and she bit the corner of her dark lip at the pleasurable sensation; half tickle, half foot-rub. The sensations began to travel upward, as her socks became even softer and rose above the edges of her shoes. Their white coloration darkened as a pattern of light purple and black stripes overtook the fabric.<br />
<br />
Her white converse high-tops were not spared, their color darkened to black as the canvas shifted to leather. They thickened into a pair of solid boots, their tops just below the middle of her calves. Her laces shifted to a dark purple, the same color as her lips. The soles bubbled outward, thickening to add yet another inch to her already impressive new height. Her socks rose higher, sliding smoothly and pleasingly over her legs until they stopped just below her knees.<br />
<br />
Lina let out a sigh of relief as her too tight shorts shifted, becoming high-waisted and expanding, wrapping themselves themselves around her shapely ass. Their color quickly darkened to black as well, and a studded black belt wound about her midriff. Her relief was broken with a quiet gasp as her plain panties shifted beneath them, the simple cotton shifting to dark, lacey purple as they pulled tighter about her crotch and rear. The end slid up between her ass as it became a thong.<br />
<br />
The collar of her white t-shirt dissipated, becoming low cut and showing off her pale cleavage. The arms unraveled, and the color shifted to the purple of her socks as the hem tucked itself into her shorts. The shoulders became little more than spaghetti straps, pulled taught by the weight her large breasts. <br />
<br />
Yet more rustling was heard and felt from below this new tank top, as black mesh wove itself over her pale skin. The mesh undershirt made up the space lost by the retreating neckline of her light purple tank top, the shadow of her cleavage still peeking through. The ends continued unabated, passing over her shoulders and down her ivory arms. The ends stopped at her wrists.<br />
<br />
She gazed down at her white hands. A band with triangular purple studs and some black bangles wrapped around her right wrist, and on her left a black leather band formed. Curiously, this one was unadorned apart from a small metal loop on the underside. Some silver necklaces slithered and clinked about her neck, several simple chains, but one hung lower, a flat enamel charm of purple grapes hanging at the end.<br />
<br />
She felt several pinches about her face and ears as piercing began to appear. They ought to have been painful, but instead felt more like the pleasurable pops of the grape carbonation still bouncing through her body. Two dangling silver pentagram earrings dropped from her earlobes, and a few other amethyst studs dotted her cartilage. An equally silver crescent pierced her septum, the ends pointed down toward her dark lips.<br />
<br />
Lina breathed heavily as the changes slowed, and then finally stopped. She stood there, now gone was the mousey girl who entered the store, replaced by statuesque, dark beauty. Her nipples still buzzed, visible even beneath the double shirts she now wore, her large breasts were unsupported yet retained their shape. Her feet almost ached pleasantly in her boots, her socks tight wrapped tightly around her larger soles. She scrunched her toes again, feeling sympathetic pleasure rippling beneath her shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goddess,&quot; she found herself saying in a strong, sultry voice. She did not notice the choice of word. &quot;And that was only half a can?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy still stood rooted to the spot, staring in shock and awe at her friend. Her whole concept of the world had just been shattered over the course of a few minutes. Lina may have invoked a goddess in her own amazement, but Amy felt the term might well apply to her friend at this point.<br />
<br />
So distracted by her friend&#39;s changes had Amy been, that she hadn&#39;t noticed the resurgence of the soda&#39;s bubbling in her own stomach. It returned now, and Amy felt a tickling, expectant sensation in her throat. Before she could react, a loud hiccup erupted from her.</p>
