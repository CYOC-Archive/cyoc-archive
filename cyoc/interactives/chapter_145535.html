<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Moe and Nichole were in their bathroom.  Moe was pounding into Nichole from behind while Nichole was holding on to a pillow.  Nichole was moaning and screaming, &quot;Don&#39;t stop, Moe!  Don&#39;t stop!&quot; as she felt her fourth (or fifth?) orgasm that day.  Moe grunted as he released his third load into her.  Once the orgasms subsided, the two of them relaxed as Moe pulled out of Nichole and collapsed next to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow...&quot; Moe said as he was huffing.  &quot;How long have we been at this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Judging by the amount of light, I&#39;d say a few hours,&quot; Nichole said as she looked out through the window.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever gone that long, not even in our honeymoon days,&quot;  Moe said as he looked to his wife.  &quot;Heck, I don&#39;t remember even being naked this long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; she said while smiling at Moe, &quot;But there&#39;s something about this place.  Every time I look at that book, there&#39;s something in me that goes wild.  That makes me want to take you and make passionate love.&quot;  Nichole took a hand and brushed it through the hairs on Moe&#39;s chest.  &quot;Those weres are so sexy and when I see them...&quot;<br />
<br />
Moe put a hand on Nichole&#39;s hand and said, &quot;I know what you mean.  To be honest, I&#39;ve been imagining you with those ears and a tail, and it turns me on so hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nichole chuckled and said, &quot;Yeah, at least with me, I don&#39;t have to imagine you in fur.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Moe said, grinning.<br />
<br />
Nichole sighed and said, &quot;If we&#39;re being honest with each other...and myself...I sorta want what they have.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Meaning?&quot;  Moe asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll admit, I didn&#39;t like this whole were thing.  Having an anthropomorphic cat explain the whole Mandatory Were thing didn&#39;t exactly sit well with me.  And since Karen volunteered to be the family were, it still didn&#39;t sit right with me.  But since talking with Dan and Fran, seeing how they were, and even seeing Peter how he was, my mind has been slowly accepting things.  And then I read that book.  I saw the various types of weres, how strong and beautiful and even how sexy they were.  I kept imagining you as the male were, and myself as the female were, and that alone just turned me on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know what you mean,&quot; Moe said as he put an arm around Nichole, pulling her close.<br />
<br />
&quot;And, then as I read more of that book, I learned all of the advantages of being a were.  Not getting sick.  Living for about four hundred years.  Looking as if you haven&#39;t aged a day past 25, and have all the benefits of working out at a gym without the actual workout.&quot;  She paused as she gathered her thoughts.  &quot;If I&#39;m being honest with myself, I want all that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Moe thought about what Nichole said and then asked, &quot;Are you saying that you...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Want to be were?&quot; Nichole finished his question.  &quot;Yeah, I am.  Which were exactly, I&#39;m not sure yet.  But I want everything that Dan and Fran have...and Karen will soon have...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I do call you foxy...&quot; Moe said with a grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and werefox is one of my choices,&quot; Nichole said, &quot;but we can have that discussion at a later time.&quot;  She got up off of the bed and made for the bedroom door.  &quot;We left our clothes all over the house, and I figure we ought to pick them up before Karen catches on.&quot;  It was then that she discovered the pile of clothes near the door.  &quot;Too late,&quot; she said to herself.<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Karen waited by the phone, waiting for the phone call from Peter.  She had the guide book in her hand as she studied the different weres.  She was leaning towards weretiger, but werecougar was also looking good to her.  Wereleopards had really nice coats, but she thought that they didn&#39;t have the strength she wanted to defend herself.  Werelions were the only were group she hasn&#39;t talked with, but it wasn&#39;t a strong contender.  Sure, they had strength, but werelionesses looked too plain to her.  Besides, she was meeting with one just to keep her parents happy.  Karen wanted to be strong, beautiful, and feline.  The phone then rang, interrupting her thoughts.  She picked up the phone and answered it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Karen,&quot; Peter started, &quot;I&#39;ve got some bad news and good news.  The good news is that we do have someone from Talbot coming, but the bad news is that they won&#39;t be able to come till tomorrow afternoon, sometime around one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s fine,&quot; Karen responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Peter said slowly,  &quot;I&#39;ll be sure to tell them.&quot;  He paused as he noticed something was off with Karen&#39;s tone.  &quot;Is everything all right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Karen said, &quot;It&#39;s just this whole...Gamboni thing throwing me off.&quot;  She knew she was lying, but she felt she couldn&#39;t let Peter in on what was really bothering her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about that,&quot; Peter said.  &quot;My dad has the best team in town handling them, and the FBI are here too.  They won&#39;t lay a finger on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen smiled a little when he said that.  &quot;Thanks, Peter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem,&quot; Peter said, &quot;Hang in there, and this whole thing will be over before you know it.&quot;  The two of them said their goodbyes before hanging up the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Karen?&quot; Nichole called out from the master bedroom, &quot;Who was that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was Peter, mom,&quot; Karen called out, &quot;He&#39;s having a werelion person come over tomorrow at about one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, okay,&quot; Nichole responded.  &quot;Are you hungry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I made myself something to eat,&quot; Karen said half-lying.  &quot;I&#39;ll be fine.  You and dad can keep doing whatever you guys are doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, dear.  Have a good night.  And thanks for gathering our clothes for us.&quot;  Karen heard the door close before going to her own bedroom.  She sat next to the window as night fell.<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
It wasn&#39;t long after night fell that she heard the noises that she was listening for.  The sound of people having sex.  She put her shoes on and looked out into the hall.  Her parent&#39;s bedroom door was still closed, although she couldn&#39;t hear anything.  She turned off the light and quietly closed the door before sneaking downstairs.  She took a breath before going through the back door and onto the patio.  Once outside, it wasn&#39;t hard for her to pinpoint the couples having sex in the woods.  She decided to go to the sound that was the loudest and closest.<br />
<br />
Although it was dark and she couldn&#39;t see very far, the noises guided her way.  She walked carefully trying to make as little noise as possible as well as avoid any low hanging branches.  It wasn&#39;t long before she reached her destination as she saw two weretigers going at it.<br />
<br />
The weretigress was on her hands and knees while a weretiger was thrusting from behind.  Karen watched as the weretigress&#39;s fur and breasts moved with every thrust of the weretiger.  The weretiger was massaging the base of the weretigress&#39;s tail, with the weretigress moaning as he did this.  With every thrust, Karen could feel the tension that was building up in her, the same tension that was building up in her all day.  It wasn&#39;t long before both weretigers seem to roar as they both orgasmed.  Karen bit her lip as the familiar wetness grew in her groin.<br />
<br />
That tension broke when she felt a heavy paw land on her shoulder.  She yelped and quickly turned around to see Oliver in his werecougar form.  &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Karen looked behind her and saw that she had the weretiger&#39;s attention.  Her face flushed red as she turned back towards the weretigers and said, &quot;I&#39;m so sorry.  I didn&#39;t mean to watch you as you two had...um...sex...&quot;<br />
<br />
The male weretiger pulled himself away from the weretigress and stood up.  Karen could see the droplets of semen as his penis was deflating and heading back into his sheath.  &quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; he said, &quot;We know that when we come out here to the woods, there&#39;s always a chance that someone could see us.&quot;<br />
<br />
The weretigress got up, and then a discreet sniff in the air.  &quot;You&#39;re normal,&quot; she said.  &quot;Most normals who come out into these woods either don&#39;t know about the activities here or more likely in your case...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Karen said as she sat down.  &quot;Sorry, it&#39;s just been driving me crazy lately.  It seems that everyone here&#39;s having sex.  My parents just spent all afternoon together.  I hear you guys out here enjoying yourselves.  And me...well...if I join you guys, not only would I have a fur coat, but I&#39;d be pregnant too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not get birth control pills?&quot; Oliver asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I promised my parents that I&#39;d wait until I talked with all the groups on my list, and that I&#39;d tell them what my choice was before I changed.  And with my situation, I can&#39;t exactly walk to the hospital and get birth control pills.  So, I can&#39;t really enjoyed the same things you guys are enjoying right now.&quot;  Karen sighed as she put her head on her knees.  <br />
<br />
The weretiger sat down in front of her as he looked at her.  &quot;Hey, I get it,&quot; he said.  &quot;By the way, I&#39;m Rich and this is Olivia.&quot;  The weretigress waved her paw as he introduced her.  &quot;If there&#39;s one thing us weres know is that pull.  That desire to enjoy each other&#39;s company.  Olivia and I have been meeting each other in these woods ever since that last weretiger meeting, and I don&#39;t regret it one bit.  So, I can understand what you want.&quot;  Karen gave him a small smile as he said that.<br />
<br />
Oliver then asked a question.  &quot;Do you know which were you want to be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I&#39;m being honest,&quot; she said as she took a breath, &quot;yeah, I do.  I made a decision a few days ago before we went into this cabin.  My dad stopped me because I hadn&#39;t explored all my options yet, but there is one particular were that I want to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rich looked up at Olivia and turned back to Karen and asked, &quot;And the only thing that&#39;s really stopping you is the lack of birth control pills?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Either that,&quot; Karen said, &quot;or be with a female were, but I don&#39;t swing that way if you know what you mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And do you know, then a male member of the were species?&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen smiled up at Rich and said, &quot;Yeah, I do.  If I had some birth control pills.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rich thought about his response and then said, &quot;Well, here&#39;s what I can do.  My car&#39;s parked not too far away from here.  I can drive you to the hospital, get you your birth control pills, and then drive you back.  What you do from there is up to you?  Ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen smiled at Rich and then bit her lip to think about his offer.  This whole being normal in a were town thing was driving her nuts, and she was a bit eager to get this over with.  On the other hand, she did promise her father that she&#39;d wait, and she was meeting with a werelion tomorrow.  <br />
<br />
So, the real question is that would she be a rebellious daughter and go ahead with her plans on joining were society, or would she be an obedient daughter and hold off joining were society?</p>
