<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenna wasted no time, slamming her lips against Jack while holding his face to keep it locked with her mouth. Jack grabbed Jenna’s wide child-bearing hips pulling her groin closer to him, at least as close as her massive bust would allow. Jack then grabbed one of the huge jugs giving them a good squeeze which caused Jenna to moan out and lightly kick one of her legs to the side hitting the table. The same table that the chronivac was sitting on.<br />
<br />
The kick caused it to fall off the table, landing on the table with a thud and causing it to error. The machine went haywire but managed to keep most of its settings the same. Most. Due to the recency of some of the changes, they weren’t fully saved so the device had made a few changes on its own.<br />
<br />
Both Jenna and Jack felt the tingling sensation again as both were changing to the new settings of the chronivac. Both could feel each other changing but didn’t notice anything unusual once those changes were done, believing everything was still as it should be. Mentally, both once again had their IQs increased to 200, the max the machine could set it too. It didn’t change their athletic stance however, in fact, they became even more well known for their sports exploits. Jenna was no longer just a cheerleader but was a gymnast allowing her already toned and flexible body to become even more impressive. Jack had his muscles expand with him getting into track and field, increasing his stamina again and developing a full eight-pack as he became a huge hulk of a man at only 18. But that changed as well, time had moved forward, and both had now celebrated their 19th birthdays and were now celebrating Christmas in Jack’s home.<br />
<br />
It was nighttime on Christmas Eve with snow falling at a major rate. A Christmas tree being the only light emanating in the living room, which is where Jack and Jenna now found themselves though they never thought they had been in their bedroom tonight. Jenna had now officially moved in with Jack. Jack’s football season had come to an end, leading the high school to its 4th straight championship as its quarterback. Jenna finished first in both gymnastics and cheerleading in the state and regional. But that was the end of her athletic career, as she was choosing to focus on academics. The next decision was about to seal that fate.<br />
<br />
Jenna finally pulled back up from Jack, her G cup breasts still defying gravity while she rubbed her massive, heart-shaped ass against Jack’s 14-inch cock, priming it for the main event with her wet pussy. Jack was in awe at Jenna’s beauty doing his best to hold one of her hips while his other hand held as much of her right boob he could, sensually rubbing it. Jenna continued to grind herself against his dick, teasing him and making it even harder. “So, Jack…ready to make a baby?” Jenna said doing her best not to impale herself on him at that very moment. The chronivac had also changed their wants, now both wanted to start a family now. They barely kept it together during the 1st semester for Jenna to finish her sports. But now that it was over and it was Christmas time, the horny couple couldn’t keep it contained anymore, helped by Jenna always keeping track of her ovulation.<br />
<br />
Due to the fast forward in time, Jenna was now in a period of ovulation. Not only that, the chronivac made her extremely fertile, a drop of Jack’s cum would also almost certainly knock her up and she was about to receive a full load, perhaps even more than that. Jack’s own virility had been massively increased, allowing his orgasms to last even longer, not that Jenna minded, she loved how much cum he could produce. “Knowing both of our bodies, we might need more than one baby crib in nine months.” Jack answered, “You ready Jenna? No turning back once you slide down.”<br />
<br />
Jenna gave him a knowing look before lifting her hips up and positioning her moist folds over his absolute monster, ready to take the next step in life. Slowly she slid down onto him, even for the well over 100 times they had sex before, it still took some effort to fit his full length in her tight folds, but she always managed. She tilted her head back and gave a long moan until she finally reached the base of his cock. She was biting her bottom lip as she looked down at Jack again and without saying a word leaned forward and began to slide up before slamming back down quickly. Jack moaned as Jenna started to get into a rhythm, both beginning to feel pleasure they had never felt before during sex. Jenna was incredibly sensitive due to the chronivac and her current ovulation. “Oh God! It’s so good!” She moaned out pumping up and down at a faster rate.<br />
<br />
Jack was feeling her tight walls constantly constrict against his massive member sending waves of pleasure up and down his body. The first time they had slept together they barely lasted 4 minutes. Now they surpassed 30 minutes every time and usually pushed an hour. After 15 minutes, neither of them had broken a sweat, Jenna was still going at a steady pace moaning loudly and hadn’t tired one bit thanks to her amazing stamina, same with Jack who felt like he could last all night if he wanted too at the point. But now, he was finally starting to thrust in time with Jenna.<br />
<br />
His first upward thrust caught Jenna off guard as she gasped out, nearly losing all her breath from the singular motion but was immediately brought back into rhythm with Jack’s help. Jack took his other hand and grabbed onto her other massive breast using his fingers to flip over both of her nipples. Jenna felt her hunk of a man use his strength to draw more moans from her as he began to get rougher, squishing her boobs. “That’s it, big boy. Use that horny brain of yours.” Jenna smiled as she was suffering from sensory overload. “Huh, This coming from the co-valedictorian of the school.” Jack retorted as he thrusted a bit harder during the comment. “It’s going to be odd for the rest of the school to watch two soon to be parents accept the reward.” Jack made one more comment before he lost himself to the same pleasure Jenna was, speeding up his thrusts while Jenna did the same in kind<br />
<br />
The smacking of their bodies continued for some time but even with their incredible stamina it had to end at some point. It was nearly midnight, both lovers had been going for nearly an hour and a half, when Jenna felt a minor throb from Jack’s dick. “You’re close, aren’t you?” Jenna said a smile creeping across her face. Jack just looked up and was clearly beginning to feel the effects of the marathon event. “So are you my beautiful girl. You’re starting to get tighter.” Jack remarked which Jenna didn’t dispute, she could feel her orgasm also slowly approaching. Her breasts continued to bounce up and down for Jack’s enjoyment as her sensitive body continued to cause her hormones to go into overdrive. Suddenly, Jack pulled her closer and grabbed one of Jenna’s boobs with his mouth. As he began sucking and licking, Jenna went crazy. “OH YES! YES! JACK! KEEP DOING THAT! KEEP SUCKING MY TITS!”<br />
<br />
Jack then lifted off her breast to get some air, “I can’t wait for them to become real Mommy Milkers.” He felt a much more intense throb in his dick, he was getting close and wouldn’t be able to hold it much longer. “So, Jenna, how much do you really want this?”, Jack slowed his thrusts down to see how Jenna would react. Jenna quickly slammed herself down again and increased her speed to as fast as she could pump up and down his dick with her pussy. “KNOCK ME UP!” Jenna screamed out in a lust filled haze. As another, more intense throb of pleasure shot through his body, Jack heard all he needed, deciding to catch up to her speed and intensity. As it approached midnight, neither made much stamina left. <br />
<br />
Jack felt more throbs as he had to begin to slow down. Jenna felt this as her heart fluttered in want for him to explode inside of her to get her pregnant. Jack couldn’t hold back anymore, “H-here it comes. Say goodbye to this athletic body…AND WELCOME TO MILF-HOOD!” The words reached Jenna as she couldn’t contain it anymore, “OH YES! CUM INSIDE! DO IT! OH GOD YES!” And as the clock struck midnight, officially turning over into Christmas, both screamed out in mutual pleasure.<br />
<br />
Jack felt his first shot of cum shoot out with intense force and pleasure as it began to paint Jenna’s walls. Jenna clenched tightly around his massive member, trying desperately to drain Jack dry into her unprotected, fertile womb. Soon a second shot of his virile sperm came out, followed closely by another. “THAT’S IT! KEEP CUMMING IN ME!” Jenna screamed out, her intellect being overtaken by pure carnal lust and the same went for Jack who was holding Jenna down to keep her from pulling his dick out. Jack fired off 12 shots of thick cum into his girlfriend’s body as they finally started to come down…from round 1. <br />
<br />
After 5 minutes of breathlessness, Jenna finally began to lift herself off Jack. “Oh, what a mess we’ve made.” She said while looking at the couch which would clearly need to be cleaned later. “That can be left for later. As for you and me, Bed. NOW!” Jenna began to march up the stairs to the master bedroom of the house, her hips swaying side to side to entice Jack further. He followed her into the room where she was waiting on the bed, already exposed for Round 2. “Your turn to be on top, hunk.” Jenna said as Jack smiled at the sight.<br />
<br />
“If that first load didn’t knock you up, then these next few will do the trick” Jack said jumping on the bed and quickly going back at it with Jenna. While the two continued to fuck each other senseless, the load of cum from the first round of sex began to do its job. Jack’s sperm quickly worked its way towards Jenna’s egg. It was surrounded by trillions of the tiny bits of DNA. Finally, one broke through beginning the fertilization process and soon, the first stages of pregnancy. Then, a second egg appeared, slightly larger than the first. Jack’s sperm soon surrounded it and one quickly broke through, beginning the same process as the first. Both fertilized eggs began to divide at a rapid rate however, the larger egg was unstable in its current state, and it soon began to split, becoming two separate zygotes. Jenna was now going to be pregnant with triplets. But she nor Jack knew this, nor did they care, too lost in the best sex of their lives.<br />
<br />
Jenna loudly moaned as Jack quickly and forcefully fucked her, using his strength to bounce her back and forth on the bed as it creaked and bent. Her breasts bounced up and down with each thrust as Jack held her curvy waist. “Enjoy those curves while you can Jack, cause once the bump starts forming, they’re going to go away for awhile.” Jenna said while nearing orgasm again. “Good thing I’ve got these!” Jack then moved his hands to her breasts and roughly groped and rubbed them, he was also nearing another orgasm. Jenna gasped in pleasure as her boobs were rubbed by Jack, “Come on! Give me another load!” Jack’s body then followed the command, speeding up his thrust while his dick throbbed hard until he gave one final slam into Jenna, cumming inside of her again. Jenna followed quickly by clamping down on his large member as both screamed out in pleasure once more. Jack fired off another 12 shots of cum until some of it leaked out of Jenna’s pussy. Jack pulled out, grabbing a tissue to clean up some of the mess before Jenna once again got on top of him for another round of sex.<br />
<br />
By the time they were finished, it was almost daybreak for Christmas and even then, neither of them were tired out. They absolutely loved each other and the passion they had during the night proved it, going 7 total rounds for the night. “Our children are going to be so lucky to have us as parents. Our beautiful athletic bodies combined with our extreme intelligence will give them a boost as well.” Jenna said looking at Jack as both held each other tightly, “By the way, Jack. Whatever happened with those advertisement offers?”<br />
<br />
Jack looked down at her with a loving smile, “Why do you think I agreed to procreate with you tonight? I accepted the deal and finally accepted an athletic scholarship to that prestigious college. The same one you’re going to.” Jenna smiled, having already known the answer for a bit but she still couldn’t help but shed a few tears. “I love you, Jack! Merry Christmas” Giving him a light kiss on the cheek.<br />
<br />
“Well hold on, I have one more gift for us.” Jack got up and walked over to the table the chronivac was under and pulled out a box and got down on one knee in front of Jenna. “Jenna Stills…Will you marry me?” He opened the box revealing a diamond encrusted engagement ring, the first thing he bought with the advertisement deal money. Jenna eyes had their floodgates opened as she sat up on the bed. “YES! YES, I WILL MARRY YOU JACK!” Jack then jumped onto his new fiancé, getting ready for an eighth round of sex in celebration.<br />
<br />
The chronivac meanwhile had finally fully recovered, making sure everything was set in stone. After checking over both Jack and Jenna and seeing she was now pregnant, it locked all the changes in. Neither of them could be changed by the chronivac, except their awareness of any changes they or someone else committed. John had gotten a lot more than he bargained for. Instead of hopefully scoring a bombshell, ditz girlfriend, he became a bombshell beauty with intelligence only rivaled by his best friend, now her fiancé. He went from being a nerd to a top athlete in her region and now, was fully focused on academics for her future career, even if for a while she would be taking care of triplets soon. But that’s not the end of the chronivac here, Jenna picked it up later while cleaning up the mess she and Jack made, placing it back on the table.</p>
