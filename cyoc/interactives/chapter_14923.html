<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kent got up the next morning, still feeling overcome with fear and anxiety about going to school. He was tired of being picked on, just because he was such a smart but nerdy-looking kid. Still, Ty loved the guy because he was so meek and timid.<br />
<br />
When Kent got up, he walked into the bathroom, and he splashed some water on his face. When he looked at his reflection in the mirror, he noticed that he was still the skinny, short kid with short, black hair, a large frame with glasses covering his eyes, and braces on his teeth. He often stuttered and he didn’t talk much in school, because he was so horrible shy. He was the favorite target for just about every bully in school, and he knew it.<br />
<br />
“I don’t feel like going to school today…” he whispered to himself, as he was overcome with fear and anxiety. What if the jocks saw him today? What if they decided to make fun of him again? What would he do? What could he say? Kent realized that he couldn’t always depend on Ty to help him out.<br />
<br />
Kent walked back to his bedroom and grabbed his backpack, tossing it on the bed. Then he looked at his planner, a small book with a picture of Einstein on the cover. In it, he had written down exactly what tests he had that day, and he had worked out exactly which chapters he would study for homework that night, dividing up all his study material in equal sections for every day, including weekends.<br />
<br />
“I got a Chemistry test today… I have no choice… I have to go to school…” he thought out loud. To stay home from school was almost impossible for him. He would go no matter what, rain or shine. He would even show up for class with a bad cold, a headache, or a sore throat. It just became harder to get motivated enough to go, especially when he realized that he ran the risk of getting bullied again.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Kent was overcome with an incredible urge to take a shower. He resisted at first, but as the urge increased, it became unbearable. He finally collected a pair of jeans, suspenders to hold it up, and a yellow, plaid button shirt. He would look incredibly geeky in school, but it made him happy. That’s just who he was. <br />
<br />
Kent finally got up and ran into the shower. The warm water made his entire body feel strange. As soon as Kent grabbed the bar of soap, he looked down as he started to rub the soap over his skin. His pectorals increased like balloons, forming two round spheres which were covering his chest.<br />
<br />
“What the…” he exclaimed, at first wondering what was going on. When he bent over, he saw something growing below his increased pectorals. Were those abdominals? <br />
<br />
“Wow! Where did those come from?” he whispered. As he continued to look down, he felt the water flowing down to his legs. As soon as his legs became wet, he noticed his quadriceps increase in size as well, followed by his calves. <br />
<br />
When Kent turned sideways, he saw something forming on his arms. Biceps? Round balls of muscle formed on his arms, making him feel stronger. <br />
<br />
“Oh my gosh… I’m getting bigger! My muscles are growing!” he exclaimed.<br />
<br />
As soon as Kent finished rubbing soap all over his body, he quickly rinsed off before he turned off the water and opened the sliding glass door. He immediately stepped out and grabbed the towel, which was hanging right by the toilet. When he stepped in front of the mirror, which was hanging above the sink, his mouth dropped wide open in amazement.<br />
<br />
When Kent made a fist and flexed, sparks suddenly came from his biceps!<br />
<br />
“Whoa!” he gasped, when he was suddenly overcome with a surge of muscular strength.<br />
<br />
As soon as he opened the bathroom door, he saw Ty standing before him, all dressed up and ready to go to school, with his backpack hanging from his shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Hurry up, Kent! Get dressed! I will enlarge your clothes for you, for they definitely won’t fit on THAT body!!” Ty chuckled.<br />
<br />
Kent just stared at him for a moment with a confused look on his face. Then Ty walked up to him and rested his arm over Kent’s shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Nobody is gonna bother you at school today. I changed you into a muscle dude! And you’re the strongest kid in school right now! So, stop worrying about those goons and get dressed so that we won’t be late in school!”<br />
<br />
Kent just smiled, as he turned towards Ty. He didn’t have to say anything. Ty already knew that Kent had become his best friend. Ty even started to consider Kent as his little brother, and he loved making the timid and scared kid grow big and buff. What more could Kent ask for?</p>
