<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">  Riley was sick of her life, middle aged, no kids,  single with no hope of ever finding a partner. She was sick of her dead end job working with people she could barely trust with a pen let alone any significant job tasking she wanted a new start and it would arrive in the form of a small package left on her front door.<br />
      Riley got home from work and dropped her purse on the floor before picking up the plain box left on her front porch. Closing the door behind her she turned on the hall light and examined it. The box had no markings nothing to indicate a return address or a receipt. Curiosity got the best of her and she opened it finding a small phone like object inside complete with a case and charger. Plugging it in she left it to charge while she made some dinner. After a simple dinner for one she decided to take a bath and check out the new phone. <br />
      Sitting in a hot bath with bubbles and a large glass of wine she powered up the phone and was greeted by something she would never have expected.<br />
                 Welcome to the Chronivac Pro!<br />

Riley stared at the screen in amazement , There she was a complete digital replica displaying everything about her and her body <br />

She scrolled down and saw a digital avatar representing herself and was embarrassed about seeing everything displayed in such a  casual way. As she explored deeper into the settings she couldn&#39;t believe what the options were. Age, gender, race, sexuality, species, and at the bottom inanimate. Smiling at the novelty of seeing herself differently she tapped on the settings and made a quick change <br />
 <br />

<br />
After tapping apply she felt a tingling feeling on her scalp and shrieked in surprise when her normally boring brown hair suddenly changed into a bubble gum pink, almost dropping the Chronivac in the water she quickly put it safely on the floor and stood up staring at her reflection. It had actually changed her hair for real. Stepping out of the bathtub Riley picked up the Chronivac and looked at her avatar now with matching pink hair. A loud thud against her bathroom window startled her back to the moment, looking out her window she saw her neighbors son playing with his friends in the grassy area between buildings “ sorry Ms Hanson” he called out smiling with his adorable youthful smile showing missing baby teeth. Riley waved and quickly closed the curtain and went to get dressed.<br />
      Riley sat on the couch wearing shorts and a shirt the barley hid her ample cleavage while she continued to play with the Chronivac. She had discovered that she could edit her avatar and see the changes first before applying them and had drastically changed her avatar before reverting all charges and going back to her normal self. Holding the Chronivac and staring at the darkening ceiling Riley knew what she should do. Her childhood and early adulthood had been nothing but mistakes and blown opportunities and she wanted to fix it. Tapping on her stats she started making changes <br />

She hesitated before going back for more changes <br />
As the made herself into her dream self she kept thinking about her neighbors son and how much fun he was having to be a kid again would that be the best thing? To grow up again and be able to make the best decisions knowing what had happened before? Smiling Riley made the changes <br />

Riley read the warning and was more than pleased at the thought of having parents again. Parents who would take care of everything and love her forever. She was about to tap apply when she heard the joyful laughter of the boys playing and with a small twinge of jealousy she thought of being able to join them looking at the Chronivac she knew what had to be done.<br />

<br />
  Robby woke up buried deep under his blankets he could vaguely remember being a middle aged  women from the United States and receiving a Chronivac and using it to change herself into the young boy that he was now. Sitting up he looked around the bedroom. It was definitely a little boys room but a clean and tidy one. The walls were a dark blue with a few posters for local soccer teams including Manchester United complete with a jersey, As he looked around he heard a soft accented voice in the hallway “Robby honey it&#39;s time to get up!” His mum was calling him from the hallway “ I&#39;m up mum” he called out surprised to hear the same accent coming from his own mouth.<br />
     Robby slipped out of his bed and stretched his body looking down at his toes and seeing a flat slim chest and surprisingly fit  body. Suddenly feeling the urge to go pee he quickly crossed the hallway and entered the bathroom closing and locking the door behind him. Walking to the toilet he  took a deep breath and calmed himself down. With a quick action he pulled down his pajamas and underwear revealing a soft penis about 3 inches long with a wrinkled foreskin covering his glans, taking a quick moment to accept the this was indeed his he got down to business. Grabbing himself he gently pulled his foreskin back to reveal his smooth glans, aiming at the middle of the bowl he relaxed and started peeing a yellow stream. He started waving his penis around being extra careful not to miss the toilet while having as much fun as he could. After finishing up and wiping off he let go of his penis giggling softly as his foreskin slipped over his glans, it always felt funny when he played with his penis especially when he rubbed his fingers across his glans. Washing his hands he left the bathroom and went to get dressed.<br />
     Robby undressed down to his underwear and shrugged before taking them off as well, standing naked in front of the mirror he examined his new body. Slim and pale but fit and healthy, he smiled revealing a few missing baby teeth and bright green and blue eyes filled with mischief and wonder, he noticed a small scar on his face and remembered the bike accident last year his mom had been so worried. Taking a better opportunity he started examining his penis and testicles wiggling his hips and watching it flop limply slapping gently against his legs “ Robby hurry up and get dressed your going to miss your bus”. Robby quickly got dressed in fresh undies and his school uniform, he struggled with the tie before he decided to get some help from mum.<br />
       Walking down the hall he looked for pictures of his new family and quickly discovered that he was the youngest of two boys his older brother was 12 and went to a different school. Robby entered the kitchen and sat down after grabbing a bowl of cereal. He has just sat down when Simon walked in and grabbed him playfully “ hey squirt!” Robby squirmed around in his chair trying to free himself from his older brothers grip “ let me go!” Simon held him tighter “ not until your a good little boy and do what I tell you” Robby stopped and looked at him “ I promise”. Simon released his brother and sat down at the table. “ What do I have to do now?” Robby asked dully. Simon took a large spoon full of cereal “ I&#39;ll think of something”. The brothers quickly finished breakfast and after getting Simon&#39;s help with his tie they left to meet the bus.</p>
