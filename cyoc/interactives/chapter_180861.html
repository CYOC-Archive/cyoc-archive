<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty was so fired up with the gym members he had made more muscular. What an incredible rush it was, seeing their muscles inflate before his very eyes, and seeing these guys grow bigger and stronger in just a matter of a few seconds, all thanks to his cool, new reality-altering powers! These events made Ty feel more and more at home in the gym, and he began to contemplate finding out if there was a way for him to hang out at the gym longer without being suspicious?<br />
<br />
Ty walked past the front counter, located near the front entrance of the large gym, when he spotted a small sign with the words “Help Wanted” and an email address. Ty smiled as he immediately grabbed his cell phone and used his power to write the best resume and cover letter ever, submitting it to the right email address right away while standing by the front desk. As he stood there, the manager of Bunky’s Gym, who was Mr. Bunker, received the email from Ty. <br />
<br />
Ty made sure, thanks to a silent wish, that his resume came across as being extremely professional and that Ty appeared to be very qualified for the job. Mr. Bunker grabbed his cell phone and called Ty, who answered the phone while standing a few feet away from him.<br />
<br />
“Hello? Can I speak to Ty? Can you come into the gym and meet me for an interview?” Mr. Bunker asked him.<br />
<br />
“Sure! I’m already here! I’m standing right behind you!” Ty responded. <br />
<br />
Mr. Bunker turned around and spotted the teen on the other side of the front counter, holding the cell phone in hand. <br />
<br />
The two sat down and talked briefly, with Ty answering all of the gym manager’s questions. Ty was very qualified to work behind the counter and to help sign up new members. Ty also had to help clean the cardio equipment and he was fine with that. Mr. Bunker presented Ty with all the paperwork which he filled out and signed and he was hired on the spot. <br />
<br />
Ty got his cool black-and-red Gym Staffer uniform and cap as he started to walk around the expansive gym, greeting the members who were working out. He wandered over to the front counter, where he worked the phones and checked in the members from their ID cards using the barcode scanner. He began to love the new job, since he started to get to know all the gym members. <br />
<br />
Finally, after about an hour, a young guy walked through the wide glass doors. He looked rather lost as he approached the front counter. Ty sensed that this kid wasn’t a member at the gym. <br />
<br />
“Uhh… Hi… Umm… I wanna sign up… I wanna become a member of this gym!” the teenage boy said. <br />
<br />
“Awesome! I’ll meet you at the little round table, okay?” Ty smiled, pointing at one of the tables with two chairs, located a few feet away from the front desk. The teen, who seemed about the same age as Ty, wandered over and sat down. <br />
<br />
Ty walked over to the table, carrying a few sign-up papers in his hand. He sat down and explained the monthly membership fee to the teen, who’s name was Brandon. Brandon was about the same height as Ty, but he was a little heavier than him. He needed to shed a few pounds and he had wanted to gain some muscle while he started working out at the gym. So, Ty signed him up and got all his information in order to get his membership going. <br />
<br />
About ten minutes later, Ty gave Brandon a tour of the gym, showing him everything from the cardio section, the free-weights area and the men’s locker room. He also showed Brandon the spa area where the massage chairs and beds were located. Once the tour was over, Brandon got his lock and he strolled into the locker room where he changed before his very first workout. <br />
<br />
Ty was happy with his sign-up of his new gym member, but he felt that perhaps Brandon could use a little help in getting started with his workouts. So, he got a rag from the storage room and a bottle of sainting lotion and he began to wander around, cleaning the treadmills and ellipticals while waiting for Brandon to emerge from the locker room. <br />
<br />
When Brandon finally appeared, he wandered over to the free-weights section, where he sat down on the small weight bench and he grabbed a pair of 10-pound dumbbells from the large steel rack, located against the wall below the big mirror. He started doing some arm curls, struggling a little at first. Ty saw that as he wandered over, carefully taking note of what Brandon was doing. Brandon had changed into his shorts and a tank top while in the locker room, and he was all meat and bones with no muscle at all and just a slight belly in the front.  Ty decided that Brandon could use some more muscle, now that he was working out in Ty’s gym! He made a few silent wishes while wiping down the dumbbells as he walked in front of the area where Brandon was working out. <br />
<br />
Brandon was in the middle of doing arm curls when he was overcome by a strange, tingling sensation, which caused him to stop what he was doing. He almost dropped the dumbbells on the floor when the tingling became too intense in his arms! His fat belly melted away, leaving him with a flat tummy that now morphed into a great, ripped wall of abdominal muscles resembling a deep washboard. Buttons formed with grooves between them, and his stomach became hard like armor. In addition, his flat, flabby pectorals suddenly hardened as they widened and inflated into large, big, solid mounds of hard muscle, implanted on his upper chest, making his shoulders much wider than before. The larger pecs along with the wide lats made his tank top stretch out some, which gave him that amazing V-taper as well. <br />
<br />
“Hey! What’s going on?” Brandon moaned softly as he began to feel the changes as they happened to his body. <br />
<br />
His arms blew up as well, with big, hard triceps and biceps filling up his arms, making them big, hard, strong and heavy. Right away, Brandon was overcome by that intense desire to raise up his arms and flex!<br />
<br />
“Whoa! I got big guns! How did that happen?” he gasped.<br />
<br />
Long, deep veins formed across his forearms, which now grew into large bowling pins as the muscle growth sensation traveled south towards his legs. <br />
<br />
First, Brandon’s quads practically ballooned into large, wide and thick pillars of muscle, making his legs resemble the largest tree trunks! Massive, thick vertical columns of muscle ran from his waist to just above his kneecap, making his quads bulge like sewer pipes covered in veins. <br />
<br />
“Ohmygosh…. Ohhhhh!” Brandon could only groan as his legs grew thicker and wider while they continued to pack on more and more muscle within just a few seconds’ time. His hamstrings grew bigger and thicker as well, and his calves bulged into large soccer balls that were sticking out from the back of his legs. Within just a few moments, and thanks to a few silent wishes, Ty had made Brandon transform from an average kid into an astounding teenage bodybuilder!<br />
<br />
“Holy shit! I… I must be dreaming! Holy frick! No way! What the hell happened?” Brandon just gasped, first looking down at his torso, his arms and finally his legs, before glancing at his incredible reflection in the large mirror that was in front of him. His jaw dropped wide open when it dawned on him that he had magically transformed into a muscle man! <br />
<br />
Just then, Mr. Bunker, the gym owner, walked up to him.<br />
<br />
“Say, Brandon? Would you like to become our new personal trainer? We’re looking for someone right now and you look like you know what you’re doing since… Well… You’re obviously built for the job!” he said. <br />
<br />
Ty quietly wished for Brandon to have all the knowledge and experience needed to become a personal trainer and the teen accepted the job, making Ty very happy!<br />
<br />
Ty just continued to walk around the gym, leaving Brandon to his workout as he looked for other gym members to change…</p>
