<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave's curious fingers continued to probe the newly formed lips as he contemplated on what to do next. With one hand, he explored his changed anatomy with gentle fingers, while the other twirled the strange pen. Essentially, his new vagina had replaced the space behind his ball sack, which made it rather difficult to get to. Nevertheless, he could feel the sensations his fingers were having on his body. His cock had been rock hard at first, but now it had dwindled away into only a moderate erection. It was almost as if his pair of genitals were separated and exclusive to two completely different sex drives. On the front, he had his cock, the undeniable pinnacle of masculinity and fucking, yet it wasn't what his mind was focused on now.<br />
 <br />
Dave leaned his head back and let out a gentle sigh. He pondered how this was possible, and whether this pen was truly magic. The possibilities were absolutely endless! <br />
<br />
Just when he was about to write something down, a finger slipped in to his lower lips, and a distinct shudder travelled through his body. Down there, deep between his thighs and nestled far beyond his normal male instincts, a button had been pressed, and Dave's limbs writhed in response. He let out a soft moan that bordered on being feminine.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Oh man,&quot; he breathed to himself. Able to gather enough willpower, Dave pulled back his fingers and shivered as a gentle breezed brushed across his female anatomy. The small striations of his new folds had left his pussy tender and sensitive. Added to that the subtle trickling of juices in his new canal and the sensations were rather distracting if he tried to be modest. However, there was no a single man or woman to bother him from this moment. With the pen, he put the tip on the piece of paper and placed his hand just under the previous sentence. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have a woman's hips and ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
Immediately after his pen stopped, Dave felt a tingle zing through his body and center around his lower abdomen and upper legs. There, it stopped and intensified into a soothing warmth that seemed to pierce into his flesh and bones until they were downright numb. Seconds later, Dave felt a gentle pressure pushing against the inside of his backside. Then, he heard a small crack as his hips expanded. The noise was followed by another just as identical, and situated on the other side of his body. <br />
<br />
Slowly and surely, his legs pushed apart as his midsection changed into something more appropriate for the opposite gender. Dave jumped as he felt another shift in his sitting posture. Just a second later, a ripple shot through his legs and ass, and he felt himself raise into the air by an inch or so. Then, another followed and the same effect happened.<br />
<br />
A minute after finishing the wording, Dave felt the tingles subside and he took a deep exhale. The changes were hard to grasp in his sitting position, except the sensation of sitting on a cushion when there was no such thing underneath him, so he decided to stand up. Just as quickly as his tush left the seat, Dave positioned himself into his normal male posture, but the action took more effort than it seemed. Rather, his butt wanted to stick out more, giving his body a curve that could only be described as womanly. After a few unsuccessful attempts to fix the matter by consciously arching his back to counter it, he decided that it wasn't worth the effort. <br />
<br />
With only his hands to sense the evidence of his changed backside, Dave decided to add something else so he could see his new addition. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have a full length mirror in the corner of the office,&quot; he wrote.<br />
<br />
An object materialized just as he said it would, and Dave strutted over in front of his desk and positioned himself in the reflection. With his pants already unbuttoned, he pulled them down along with his underwear and stood still in the mirror. With only the bottom of his shirt to keep any form of decency for his lower half, he still looked rather normal. His hips were a little wider and his legs may have been a inch or two farther apart. However, from the side profile, the changes were more obvious. Where his lower back ended, the ample swell of a woman's ass started. Gone was his slightly hairy and rough skin, replaced by the smooth equivalent that could only be associated with feminine. Just below the cheeks, the smooth skin stopped almost abruptly, and his normal, hairy legs began. Dave ran his hand along the naked backside to reassure himself that the reflection was indeed real and not a figment of his imagination. The softness of his new ass was an added bonus. <br />
<br />
While Dave's cock had stepped aside in the matter of his new anatomy, it once again grew into a rigid erection at the sight in the mirror. <br />
<br />
But now what? The pen was very real, and a tool for things that could only exist in Dave's wildest imaginations. Getting in touch with his feminine side was not a fantasy of his, yet the very idea of experimenting with the pen more only made him much more excited.  A part of him wanted to go farther, and perhaps become a full woman. His male ego, however, had other ideas in mind. If the pen was truly as powerful as it indicated, then whatever his imagination could come up with could be transferred into reality.</p>
