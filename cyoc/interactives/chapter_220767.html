<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;A lot of this is fairly quaint,&quot; Sergei said to Aleksi Nozdrin as the parade passed by.<br />
<br />
The two were seated along one side street while watching Lyre/Animalia&#39;s Fourth of July parade. It was a modest one compared to some in bigger cities, and largely went down the road that essentially linked the two sister cities together. Neither Sergei nor Aleksi knew if the road had been there before Animalia was formed, but both didn&#39;t really care about that all that much. The thing that the two looked to was more in the support and welcome that both got. There were some looks of suspicion at first, and Aleksi largely suspected such, largely given on how Putin had behaved over the past 6 years in international politics that had served to irritate a fair number of Americans, and the present war in Ukraine didn&#39;t make those issues any better. But it only lasted a short while and with he and Ivana were fairly outgoing people, and because Elly had been in Animalia even longer, they were accepted.<br />
<br />
Sergei was another new arrival, though, he&#39;d come from Russia for different reasons. He was not as old as Aleksi and Ivana were, by the year of birth, since with all of them being double dosed Animalians they appeared to be in their early twenties. However, Sergei was also one that essentially was on the wrong end of Putin&#39;s regime, though for different reasons. Aleksi seemed to be suspected for being critical of the actions that had caused the present war in Ukraine, while Sergei had been targeted more for his sexuality. It was something that Sergei tried his best to hide while in Russia, but it wasn&#39;t easy, and he feared that that would be lost as the war went poorly for Russia. It left him fearful that he would get drafted into the army and things would only get worse. Thankfully, Sergei&#39;s number had never come up and he&#39;d managed to get out of Russia, getting a pass and going from Kaliningrad to Poland, and from there to the US. And where he got an ultimate sponsor regarding the immigration and &quot;exile&quot; status.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is interesting way of celebrating things,&quot; Aleksi agreed, &quot;and in ways that differ from Putin&#39;s Russia... It&#39;s a parade... but look, not a tank in sight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And much more toleration for those who are... different,&quot; Sergei said slowly, though he did note that Rod was seated next to Elly on the other side of Ivana. The line was more with regard to his sexuality before his conversion, and Sergei was fairly sure that Aleksi picked up on that. Sergei had actually enjoyed &quot;Pride Month&quot; in America, and while it had its bitter homophobes, some of whom were in government, it wasn&#39;t as powerful as it was in Russia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... a country that respects freedom and choices... and celebrates that,&quot; Elly picked up, overhearing the conversation, &quot;is great... and even more that they also open it up to those not born here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sergei nodded with that, &quot;and I must thank your father for a lot of that. I wouldn&#39;t have gotten my chance without him.&quot;<br />
<br />
“You sponsored him?” Rod asked, lowering one ear in confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Obviously not sponsored in the way Elly did for Ivana and I,&quot; Aleksi answered, &quot;but it would be an interesting story...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on, dad,&quot; Elly commented, intrigued by the story.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Some of the open ground around the Animalia Police Station often did attract attention from people walking by. Much of it came from the fact that despite being around for years now, many people still seemed to respond to Animalia as either an attractive novelty or that they did have interest in anthropomorphic animal-people in ways that they wouldn&#39;t admit to otherwise and seeing the Animalia PD practice and train was one of those things that came up and some of this came around as Aleksi went through his training to join the Rhino Guard. The paperwork and testing was easy enough, as he found that while there were some looks over Aleksi&#39;s record and initial training being in Russia, but once all that cleared through, things could move forward.<br />
<br />
The big test, however, came more from the fact that Animalia had a fairly low crime rate that many paces would be rather jealous of. But it was something that Animalia had also figured to always be prepared for the unexpected in some ways, be it those overwhelmed by animal instincts that fueled rage, as Heather Wilcox had been when she first became a Dinotopian, or terrified and desperate for a cure as the &quot;Rat Queen&quot; Mara had been. It was something that allowed for the formation of the Rhino Guard and the ability of Animalian officers to use their senses and abilities to the utmost, and the Guard did make room for Aleksi after he and Ivana converted. That presently had him in the exercise yard with Wanda and Sherry, along with Sudan and one of the other male members of the Rhino Guard.<br />
<br />
It made for some fairly interesting work, as while Aleksi held his own against the other male White Rhino Animalian, an order by Sudan to practice some of the same take down operations with Sherry did not do as well. While proportionately speaking, Sherry&#39;s arms and legs were not as &quot;trunk-like&quot; the way any of the Rhinoceros Animalians&#39; were, but the Triceratops Dinotopian was larger overall and that gave Sherry an advantage in terms of raw strength, and that had in turn slowed Aleksi&#39;s ability to handle some of the standard measures. It took some tries and some tips that came from both Sudan and Sherry before he managed it. There were a few snickers from Wanda, as the Wolly Rhinoceros Animalian actually seemed to have some enjoyment in seeing her partner dominate the sparring secession with a well-built male White Rhinoceros Animalian.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re getting better, Aleksi,&quot; Sudan said slowly, &quot;but you have to keep your mind focused and sharp...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It took about all that I had just to manage what I managed there,&quot; Aleksi answered, and panted a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but Sherry is a larger and stronger opponent,&quot; Sudan answered, &quot;and while this isn&#39;t common... it can happen. Thus, you must remain prepared for the potential that something like this happens in the future and remembering on how to restrain yourself when in nearly all other situations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That last part is surprisingly easy... it&#39;s like so many utensils were not built for large Animalians,&quot; Aleksi managed, &quot;I fear even the specialized pens they made for larger Animalians might just break if I&#39;m not careful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s just about every Dinotopian with just about everything,&quot; Sherry gave a laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though, a lot of that may clear things up for the day,&quot; Sudan nodded and checked his watch, noting that he had some paperwork to file on the training reports, and dismissed the other three.<br />
<br />
After that session and the shift, Aleksi came out to find a lone Human waiting for him outside the Animalia PD office. The man was fairly tall and very fit, which struck Aleksi as an athlete and one who was potentially comparable to some of the smaller Animalians in many ways.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; the man said in English, but with a heavy Russian accent, one that was as strong as Aleksi&#39;s own. Elly&#39;s had grown weaker, but then Elly had been in Animalia for longer, &quot;you are Aleksi Nozdrin, yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am... why do you...&quot; Aleksi began.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can call me Sergei... and I need your help,&quot; the man answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;With what, sir?&quot; Aleksi wondered, &quot;if someone here threatened you, you should report it to the local officers, and I am not on duty at this moment... I actually just got OFF duty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No one has threatened me... at least not here,&quot; Sergei answered, &quot;it&#39;s more about looking to help with other issues... and I&#39;ve heard you&#39;ve been fair, which raised some interest in your help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My help?&quot; Aleksi wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;To become an Animalian... to get the legal permissions and all that,&quot; Sergei spoke, &quot;and perhaps get around the problems that saw to my leaving Russia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unless you have a criminal record... I don&#39;t think there are any legal permissions needed in America,&quot; Aleksi said slowly, &quot;you need only understand the Animalian you wish to become. Why? What problem were you...&quot;<br />
<br />
He paused when he looked to see Sergei look to him for a moment, blush and then look down. While mundane Rhinoceroses, of any species, did not have great vision, Rhinoceros Animalians could see just as well as Humans, with only the issues related to their horns and muzzle that might get in the way. But Aleksi was attentive enough to get a sense of what Sergei was nervous over and remembered. After all, he&#39;d seen plenty of cases in Russia where officers were to &quot;crack down&quot; on homosexual behavior. That had to be what Sergei was afraid of, and as Putin seemed to lose his mind over the defeats Russia was taking in Ukraine, Sergei was even more afraid that his sexuality would be found out.<br />
<br />
&quot;And this is America,&quot; Aleksi spoke, &quot;you are free to be &quot;gay,&quot; here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure?&quot; Sergei asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Aleksi nodded, &quot;though, I would warn you that apparently... becoming an Animalian would bring about some... sexuality related changes. Increasing the drive to want to reproduce, as it were... you&#39;d essentially become bi. And you could then fall for a woman, as it would appear that something like that has happened with my daughter and a young male Rhinoceros she&#39;s been seeing. Though, you could still live and love who you wish to. No one would force you. Not instincts, not the government, and not anything else. Everything would be up to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that would be good... but I could still use some of the help,&quot; Sergei answered, &quot;as I will admit that my English is not super strong and that may complicate things with regard to my getting to become an Artic Wolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you thought America... and particularly Nevada would be just like Russia?&quot; Elly asked to Sergei.<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew they were more tolerant,&quot; Sergei answered, &quot;but I&#39;d thought it was more an informal thing... that the laws forbade same sex relationships, but unlike in Russia, law enforcement didn&#39;t actually enforce these laws.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Many states did have laws that forbade gay marriage, though that was declared unconstitutional around ten years ago, now,&quot; Rod answered, &quot;which effectively legalized gay marriage in America. Most of the arguments now is over whether or not officials have to honor a same sex couple&#39;s desire to get married or whether they can get the wedding cakes they want... often ending up getting shafted by people claiming their religion demands they persecute gays.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Idiots,&quot; Sergei growled, baring his fangs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never said they were smart,&quot; Rod answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And your father helped Sergei with the paperwork and translating his paper on the Artic Wolf&#39;s instincts and behaviors into English,&quot; Ivana commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it all worked and on a day when I had a day off, I was able to escort Sergei into Horizon, as we had made friends during that time,&quot; Aleksi spoke and resumed his story.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The waiting room at Horizon was a little bit cramped for Aleksi, though he figured some of this came from the fact that the area was largely set up for those waiting to become Animalians. The Hospital, Horizon Light, handled Animalian Medical Care in Lyre/Animalia and thus Animalians didn&#39;t need to come into the main Horizon offices. Though, Aleksi contented himself to a brochure that talked on the history of the company and its desire to use biology and genetic research to improve life on Earth and looking for ways to cure diseases or improve the health possibilities for things people ate. On the surface the basic premise seemed fairly well, even if some of it sounded like it would be a &quot;mad scientist&quot; experiment ten years ago.<br />
<br />
But it was all real, and despite it starting quite by accident, it seemed to accomplish many of the goals that the brochure stated Horizon had. There was the potential for rivalry and even some cases of more combat that what was shown, though this often had to do with the fact that some Humans could get overwhelmed by the animal&#39;s instincts when they became Animalians or could be incensed to it during the mating season, particularly if two Animalians were interested in a third Animalian, regardless of gender. Animalia had largely avoided this, but it was still something that could be an issue. And Aleksi remained alert to the potential for it and kept his ears alert. From what he knew, Horizon had ways to let any Animalian that might get overwhelmed by their new instincts at first to calm down, but there could always be some other surprise, and so he listened to make sure that nothing happened with Sergei.<br />
<br />
Though after a few moments, he didn&#39;t need to focus on that as he heard footsteps approaching with the soft click of claws clicking on the tiled floor. Aleksi eventually looked up to see Sergei come into view. He wore a pair of jeans and a tee-shirt, but they were stretched over a very muscular frame and one that allowed for a ruff of white fur hanging over the top of his shirt at his collar bone. Sergei made for an impressive male Artic Wolf Animalian, and one that seemed to be a bit larger than most of the other Wolf Animalians. Though, from what Sergei told him, the Artic Wolf was another subspecies of Grey Wolf and was found in the Artic regions of northern Canada. The thing that really made it stand out was the more common occurrence of an all white coat.<br />
<br />
&quot;It worked well?&quot; Aleksi asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... it has worked out quite well,&quot; Sergei answered, &quot;it could get me going back into some of the athletics things I enjoyed before things began going so wrong of late in Russia. Working out... running... and I&#39;m sure I can find other Wolf Animalians that would be interested.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aleksi nodded and noting out of one eye some drool coming from the lips of one woman who was there in the waiting room as she looked to Sergei, &quot;you may have all sorts of attention... Human men or women. Animalians of either gender... and if you do show some interest in females, because Domestic Dogs and Wolves have produced fertile offspring, the Edict on inter-species breeding wouldn&#39;t be an impediment if you are interested in a Dog Animalian instead of a Wolf Animalian. Things are quite open...&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;And they&#39;re still open,&quot; Sergei smiled as Aleksi finished the story, &quot;though some of it is embarrassing. I&#39;ve run into Animalians that have shown interest. I was jogging around the BARA House earlier in the week, and a couple of Human women followed me home... along with the bisexual husband of one of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not too much for you?&quot; Ivana asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... people have been astonishingly polite, and I like that,&quot; Sergei answered, &quot;and it leaves things open for me to make a choice... and I&#39;ve even gotten some help at times from a small group of Herm Wolf Animalians. Though, I think they&#39;ve been something of an unofficial welcome party in the area with cards and friendly banter... and in a way, they appeal in both ways.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... the Herm Wolves are both male and female,&quot; Elly commented, &quot;though, I think they&#39;re in their own little pack that kind of share each other...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ivana gave a disapproving snort at that, which let Elly then avoid continuing with that.<br />
<br />
&quot;The big thing is that you&#39;re in a place where you can be free to make your own choices,&quot; Rod spoke up, &quot;learn from mistakes and not be held down by them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And to enjoy quaint things like this Fourth of July parade,&quot; Sergei smiled and returned his attention to the parade as it went by.</p>
