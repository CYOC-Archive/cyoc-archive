<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You are shuffling through a rack when you see it. You grab a rainbow women&#39;s one-piece swimsuit and pull it off the rack. Secretly you have always had a love for women&#39;s one-piece swimsuits. You loved the way they tightly hugged your chest, abs and waist, the way the cuts showed off your thighs and enhanced your ass, and the way it caressed your man hood. Your girlfriend had no clue about this obsession or that you had a collection of eleven one-pieces hidden away back home. You often ordered them online save for three which you had stolen by hiding them under your clothes.<br />
<br />
You don&#39;t know how to explain it, but wearing these just make you feel great. You never brought this up to anyone, not even Rachael as you were afraid she would leave you. And its not like this is a gay thing, you have zero interest in other men, its just that the one-pieces feel good. But regardless, you felt like you had to have this rainbow one-piece and you were not beyond stealing it. Heck, it only costs $15, its not like it is gonna really hurt this store. You figure you can slip this on now and wear it under your shorts and shirt, then when you get back to the hotel you can take it off in the bathroom and sneak it into your suitcase, all without your girlfriend finding out.<br />
<br />
You glance around the open room to make sure no one is around, you take the suit off the rack and hastily walk to the &#39;Change Rooms,&#39; &quot;Huh,&quot; You thought, &quot;This place couldn&#39;t even spell &#39;Changing&#39; rooms.&quot; You are confident no one saw you carrying the suit while entering the changing rooms. <br />
<br />
Once inside you strip off all of your clothes, first your blue t-shirt, followed by your black basketball shorts and then your purple boxers. Once fully naked you briefly check yourself out in the mirror before pulling on the one-piece. You are a 5&#39;11&quot; man at 160 lbs, decent muscles but nothing to brag about, you have a bit of body hair but nothing too crazy. You then step into the one-piece and pull it up. Then that all too familiar feeling hits your as you pull your arms through the holes and the suit tightens around your body giving you that spandex hug you love. You take a moment to admire the suit and yourself in the mirror. You don&#39;t look great in the suit, it is clear it is made for a woman as it just stretches wrong in a few places, but it feels good and that&#39;s what matters.<br />
<br />
You then proceed to pull up your underwear and shorts over your waist followed by your t-shirt. You then lean in close to the mirror to adjust your shirt and make sure the swimsuit isn&#39;t poking out around your collar. 100% confident you can steal this one now, you are about to reach for the door when you suddenly feel a tingling all over your body. <br />
<br />
Slightly panicked, you look at your arms and see your body hair retracting back into the body. You rush over to the mirror to see the same happening to your five o&#39;clock shadow and within seconds you have a clean shaven face. You then notice your shorts and shirt are beginning to shrink. Desperate and confused, you try to pull off your clothes but it is too late, your shirt shorts and boxers seem to be fused to the one-piece swimsuit and are being quickly absorbed into the suit. You watch in horror as your clothes slip between your fingers and completely disappear into the swimsuit. As quickly as the tingling started, it is gone.<br />
<br />
You are now standing there in front of the mirror. A man in nothing but a women&#39;s one-piece swimsuit. But things seem different now. To start with the obvious, the suit seemed to take on the color of your clothes you were previously wearing. The one-piece is now black with a blue and purple liquid like swirl pattern on the front and a black rear. You also have no visible body hair aside from what&#39;s on top of your head. Then the less obvious things, your have a slightly more feminine appearance overall. Like you can still tell this is you at a glance, but you definitely lost weight, you maybe weigh 140 or 130 lbs, and your shoulders are much less broad. Your a bit thinner at the waist with slightly wider hips. You are clearly still a man but just more feminine. You also notice you definitely lost size in the man hood. What was once a 5 inch flaccid cock was now a 3 inch cock and small balls packed into a small bulge of the one-piece.<br />
<br />
It now struck you, this was no ordinary swimwear store, there was something magical about it. The slogan was &#39;Show your true self&#39; which you absolutely are now and there was no typo on the rooms, these were definitely &#39;CHANGE&#39; rooms. Your mind was now racing, you didn&#39;t know what to do. You had no clothes aside from this one-piece, you can&#39;t just leave the changing room naked, what if Rachael saw you like this, what would she think... For the next half hour you would pace back and forth, with a race of emotions striking your. At one point you even began to cry.<br />
<br />
After what felt like an hour, you built up the courage and a plan. You would sneak out of the changing room to the nearest rack and grab the first pair of board shorts you see, heck even a speedo would be easier to explain. You peak under the changing room door to make sure no one is close by, and then slowly open to door and step out. A cool breeze hits you and you can feel it brush your hairless legs and arms. That was when you saw yourself in another mirror just outside the changing rooms. You actually look really good in the one-piece now, like it was made just for you. You even turn around and peak over your shoulder into the mirror to get a look at your back side and you realize you have an really cute looking butt now that pairs perfectly with your small bulge on the front. If you were gay, you would definitely smash this. Suddenly you get a new sense of confidence wash over you, as if all of your worries had been washed away. &quot;Yes&quot; you tell yourself, &quot;This is great!&quot; you shout out, not caring who hears you.<br />
<br />
You confidently strut your way around the store, testing out how the new suit fits you and it is perfect. You make your way down to the first floor, swaying your hips back and forth as you step. You can&#39;t wait to walk down the beach and go swimming in this new suit, the new you, the real you. You make your way to the cashier and as you approach you hear her say to you, &quot;I see you found the perfect suit, and might I say, you are looking fantastic.&quot;<br />
<br />
You respond with a bashful, &quot;Thanks&quot; and swing your hip up to the counter so the cashier can scan the tag attached to the hip. You pay for the suit and the cashier cuts off the tag. You finally make your way to the store entrance and step outside into the busy boardwalk and the sun hits your exposed skin and it feels great.<br />
<br />
&quot;Blahahahahaha, what the heck is that? ahahahahaha.&quot; You see your girlfriend on a bench to your right cracking up.<br />
<br />
&#39;Well there goes my confidence&#39; you think as you begin to blush. <br />
<br />
Seeing that she embarrassed you, Rachael quickly rushes over to you embracing you in a hug. &quot;Oh no need to worry honey. I&#39;ve known you like wearing those for quite some time now. I&#39;m just glad you finally got the confidence you wear one in front of me now. And I have to say, you pull it off better than me.&quot; She says as she pulls you in tighter, &quot;Come on, I heard there is a new burger joint that opened up a couple blocks down.&quot;<br />
<br />
You smile realizing that Rachael will love you no matter what and give her a hug back. You then join hands and continue walking down the boardwalk were you occasionally get some nasty looks from other people as you pass by, but you don&#39;t care, you never felt better in your life.<br />
<br />
As you continue Rachael suddenly asks, &quot;Hey, did you lose weight?&quot;</p>
