<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Easy around the horns! Careful!&quot;<br />
<br />
Curtis tensed, his long tongue sticking out in concentration as he worked the electric shaver through Ollie&#39;s wooly hair. It was meant for human hair and kept catching on the thick tufts. &quot;I&#39;m sorry! I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing. Isn&#39;t there like a barber or someone you could go to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but those are expensive! You&#39;re all about your hair, haven&#39;t you ever done this before?&quot; Ollie asked from where he sat looking forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! My mom always cut my headfur growing up...&quot; <i>Wait, no that wasn&#39;t quite right, was it?</i> &quot;I mean, my mom always took me to get my hair cut.&quot; Curtis stood in thought for a moment as he tried to consolidate the dueling memories, though was interrupted as Shro entered the dorm followed by a tall white dog he hadn&#39;t seen before.<br />
<br />
Shro frowned at the mess they&#39;d made all over the floor. &quot;You&#39;re cleaning that up, right? Couldn&#39;t you at least have put down towels or something? The floor is so wet!&quot; He sighed and jumped over the pile of wet wool on the carpet on the way to his bed. His friend simply trudged through the pile and sat next to the cat.<br />
<br />
Ollie gave Shro an apologetic look. &quot;Sorry, still new at this whole thing. We were tryin to make sure we cleaned it proper. Just in case I could sell it for yarn or somethin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can tell. You know they wash it after the fact, right? What are they teaching you in Anthro 101? Who&#39;s your teacher anyway?&quot; Shro asked curiously as he dug in his backpack for something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, LaVeur. He&#39;s a Raccoon. Do you know him?&quot; Curtis asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah. Do you, Linus?&quot; Shro looked to his friend who simply shook his head, his thick white fur spinning in the air with the motion. For all intents and purposes, he looked like a walking mop wearing a woven hoodie and khaki pants, and Curtis couldn&#39;t see his eyes for his fur. &quot;This is Linus, by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sup.&quot; Linus waved vaguely in their direction. Curtis and Ollie nodded in greeting.<br />
<br />
Shro continued, &quot;You do you. It&#39;s not even, though. And you missed a spot.&quot; He pointed lazily at a particularly long clump of wool before turning back to Linus. &quot;Alright, what strain were you wanting? Same as last time?&quot;<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like Barton&#39;s out again. I swear he&#39;s never around. Works for me though.&quot; Ollie opened the door for Curtis, who walked in and sat lightly on the bed. This wasn&#39;t his first time in Ollie&#39;s room, but they generally spent their time together in the common area or his room assuming Shro didn&#39;t have one of his <i>customers</i> over. He looked around to see some pictures of Ollie&#39;s family--the humans smiling and looking close-knit. He could see the strong familial resemblance, or at least from how Ollie had looked on their first meeting, eyes notwithstanding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, your mom&#39;s pretty!&quot; Curtis took a picture in his hand to look closer at it. Ollie nodded but didn&#39;t really respond, so he put it back. His tail wagged lightly as the sheep joined him on the bed. &quot;Sorry again about your hair...it&#39;s barely noticeable...&quot; He wasn&#39;t sure whether to wince or laugh nervously at the sheep&#39;s butchered haircut.<br />
<br />
<i>Can you do anything right?</i><br />
<br />
Ollie flashed his trademark smile and shrugged. &quot;It&#39;ll grow back. I&#39;ll just wear my hat until I can stop by the barber. Lesson learned. Not yer fault.&quot; Those dimples always put Curtis at ease as he found himself leaning forward subconsciously. &quot;It&#39;s a good thing yer cute, though.&quot; Curtis&#39; tail thumped on the bed as Ollie pulled him into a kiss. This was his favorite part.<br />
<br />
Soon they were sprawled out on the bed, Ollie on top as they made out. Curtis found with a satisfaction that his tongue was perfect for this particular activity, as he eagerly alternated between deep French kisses and lapping at Ollie&#39;s neck. He was honestly surprised Dare hadn&#39;t called out any of the hickeys he&#39;d left on Ollie&#39;s neck, but the skunk-to-be had seemed pretty distracted. At their photoshoot that afternoon Milo had given them an amused look but didn&#39;t say anything as Curtis and Ollie grinned at each other guiltily. <br />
<br />
Things were going surprisingly well. <i>Surprisingly well.</i> Classes had been smooth so far, their little friend group was getting comfortable with each other--it was easier to be comfortable around other gay couples...<i>Couple?</i> Did that fit him and Ollie? He hoped so. It was pretty difficult to misinterpret things, right? Especially with the way Ollie completely dominated him with their passionate kisses, and the way he grunted softly as they were lost together. His dick throbbed, trapped in his pants. <br />
<br />
Ollie pulled away and gazed down at him thoughtfully as Curtis grinned up, his tongue lolling out as he panted from their latest kiss. &quot;Hey, Curt?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I like you, right?&quot; Ollie was hard to read.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah? I like you too. A lot...&quot; Curtis felt his heartrate increase as Ollie ran his fingers through the fur next to his ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if...Uh...How would you feel about, I dunno. Making it official?&quot; Curtis&#39; heart was hammering in his chest. The only thing cuter than the way Ollie&#39;s dimples showed themselves when he was excited about something was the way he was looking at him now. His heartbeat pounded in his dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean, like boyfriends?&quot; He tried not to sound <i>too</i> hopeful. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Gettin&#39; lost in the sound of our hearts beatin&#39;<br />
Take me here, take me now</i><br />
<br />
Curtis felt like he could explode! He felt a million emotions at once, all of them positive. &quot;I&#39;d love that, Olls.&quot; He wasn&#39;t even sure if that came out as English, but Ollie seemed to get it as he looked relieved and <i>excited</i>. Curtis leaned forward to kiss softly at his <b>boyfriend&#39;s</b> lips and they resumed. He moaned into the kiss as he felt a pleasurable jolt when Ollie groped at his throbbing dick. His tail flailed as he followed suit, and their make-out session intensified.<br />
<br />
<i>I waited for you all my life<br />
Hold my hand and keep me close</i><br />
<br />
For all of their time spent together, things had remained rather above board. Whether they were just too shy or polite it had been just kissing until now. They were determined to correct that now, however, as groping became petting became humping became wanton passion. Soon Ollie was fumbling with Curtis&#39; belt and zipper as he freed the trapped shaft. Curtis shuddered, his excitement causing him to tremble as Ollie ran his finger along the length. <i>It was the best feeling. Ever.</i><br />
<br />
<i>I&#39;ll never let you go<br />
No, not tonight</i><br />
<br />
Eager to return the favor and to touch the dick he&#39;d fantasized about, he reached forward to unbutton Ollie&#39;s shorts as he pulled off his shirt. And there it was: Long. Thick. Throbbing. Beautiful. His. He reached forward and took it into his hand, his sensitive pawpads relishing in its warm, soft skin. It was rock-hard and Curtis loved the way Ollie moaned as he flexed it against his grip. He was addicted to the feeling and reluctantly released it only to allow Ollie to pull of his shirt. Soon they were both naked as they kissed and eagerly thrust into each other&#39;s hands.<br />
<br />
Curtis wanted this to last forever, but found himself quickly nearing completion. He didn&#39;t have much time to worry about it, though, as Ollie&#39;s ragged breathing quickened in tandem with his own. The sheep&#39;s moaning had a light bleating quality to it that drove the dog wild and with a cry of euphoria he was coming into Ollie&#39;s hand in thick ropes. He rode the orgasm, his vision white while doing his best to continue his pumping and soon Ollie joined him as Curtis was covered in his boyfriend&#39;s semen.<br />
<br />
Ollie collapsed on top of him and they lay together, panting as they came down. &quot;That was...amazing.&quot; Curtis grinned goofily at Ollie as he tried to catch his breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. <i>You&#39;re</i> amazin, Dog.&quot; Ollie leaned forward and kissed Curtis&#39; nose, which had pushed out from his face into a short muzzle. &quot;I have an amazin boyfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
They laughed and cuddled on the bed together in bliss.<br />
<br />
