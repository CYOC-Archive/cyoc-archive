<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Bart?&quot; Patrick asked as he looked up at the black male wolf-man, who was licking the tooth that was now chipped.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm over HERE!&quot; came the voice of one of the four pups, making its frustration clear, &quot;quit calling father by MY name!&quot;<br />
<br />
Patrick then turned to get a closer look. A reddish-brown male, looking about the same age as a nine year old stood beside a black female of about the same age. Another pair of reddish brown pups stood behind the first two, and both of them were flanked by what he would have sworn to be a statue, until he saw it blink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny?&quot; Patrick then asked toward the black furred female.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jenny nodded, although looking rather angered that Jensen had been attacked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would have thought you'd be older by now,&quot; Patrick spoke, thinking that the Jenny he spoke of was his Great-Granddaughter, &quot;and human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Humanity if fleeting,&quot; Jenny dismissed it, &quot;and I'm nine. Exactly the age I'm supposed to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe he thinks he talking with the &quot;me&quot; he knows,&quot; the large black male then spoke and came forward to crouch in front of the man as Fran and Darla held him down, &quot;Don't you, GREAT-GRANDFATHER?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you keep calling me that?&quot; Patrick demanded, &quot;Who are you?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think he knows about the game, Master,&quot; said dark brown female standing nearby.<br />
<br />
&quot;He should have an idea,&quot; the black male grumbled, &quot;after all, Jenny called and asked him the game yesterday and then invited him over... which has now insured that I need a fang capped...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have the funds to pay the dentist, father,&quot; the older looking red-brown pup spoke, &quot;although... I don't know if they'd let a wolf in the office... but given some things about the game and Glendale, they might.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHO ARE YOU?!&quot; Patrick roared as the conversation was running off course and leaving him behind with no answers.<br />
<br />
The black male turned his head back to face him. Patrick still struggled, but the two she-wolves easily held him down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, forgive me and my BAD manners, bad, bad, bad,&quot; the black wolf snickered, drawing chuckles from nearly every wolf present, &quot;I, great-grandfather am Jensen. THE Big Bad Wolf, formerly Jennifer Smith the second, your great-granddaughter, now your great-grandson.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's impossible,&quot; Patrick snorted defiantly, &quot;now tell me what you've done with my family!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly added to it,&quot; Jensen answered, &quot;Bart and Jenny were &quot;youthafied&quot; to the nine year old pups you see over there and added their younger siblings, Alice, Marcy, and Kevin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Patrick glared at them, and they all snarled back, and were held back by the four armed wolf monster behind them.<br />
<br />
&quot;And then there is also my mate, Kaylee, my pack's Alpha Female,&quot; Jensen continued as he gestured to the red brown female, and then gestured to all the other wolves present, &quot;and this my pack, which is a sort of extended family. And we're all very happy. Aren't we?&quot;<br />
<br />
Patrick heard a chorus of &quot;yes&quot; come from the she-wolves in the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;And how, exactly could you have done this?&quot; Patrick questioned, &quot;my grandson-in-law may not have been the best of people my granddaughter could have married, I know he was human and at least decent. He was never into the Doctor Moreau science.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bart growled again.<br />
<br />
&quot;This wasn't done by science,&quot; Jensen informed him, &quot;it was done by the powers held within a game here in Glendale that ha some rather unique properties.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen hoped that would jog the old man's memory.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean that silly game Jenny called me about yesterday?&quot; Patrick asked.<br />
<br />
Jensen nodded, &quot;It's real and it changed me into what I am now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't believe this,&quot; Patrick began...<br />
<br />
&quot;Believe it,&quot; Jensen growled back.<br />
<br />
&quot;You would turn your own family into an animal?&quot; Patrick asked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I look human?&quot; Jensen retorted, &quot;I am the Big Bad Wolf! I'm not supposed to be nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Patrick couldn't answer immediately.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you doing this?&quot; Patrick asked, &quot;I've always treated you and your mother well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe we've already covered that,&quot; Jensen answered, &quot;I am the Big Bad Wolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you're going to eat me?&quot; Patrick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not until I get this tooth fixed,&quot; Jensen retorted, and then paused for a moment, &quot;you honestly think I'm going to eat you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is what the Big Bad Wolf would do,&quot; Patrick answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bad is all relative,&quot; Jensen answered with a smile, &quot;Some people kill people and are thought to be heroes for it. And besides, I'm smart enough to know that killing you would only give me more trouble later. I would much rather control the game, and to do that, I have been testing the game's rules, see what it will allow and what they will not allow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you had your mother try to turn me into a wolf,&quot; Patrick spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, she's more like a daughter to me now... and she sees me as a father figure now... for obvious reasons,&quot; Jensen answered, &quot;and I'm still leaning toward turning you into a normal wolf... although making you slightly larger doesn't sound like too bad an idea. You'd be stronger and capable of defending my pups that way... both those created by the game and those to be born in the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm an old man,&quot; Patrick spoke, &quot;You know I won't live that long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is easily corrected,&quot; Bart told him, &quot;along with all your old hatreds of me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough,&quot; Jensen told his son.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, father,&quot; Bart answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't suppose there is some way you would let me go?&quot; Patrick asked, &quot;a promise to keep your secret, perhaps?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can easily use the game to secure that if that was my only goal,&quot; Jensen told him, &quot;all you have to do is answer the game's question.&quot;<br />
<br />
Patrick grumbled back, &quot;do your worst.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I intend to,&quot; Jensen answered, sensing that Patrick still didn't believe the game was real, otherwise he would have used his turn by now, &quot;all that is left is some formal planning as to what you will become.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen then stood up and turned to the blond she-wolves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take him to the basement and tie him to a chair down there,&quot; Jensen ordered, &quot;Make certain that he can not move ANY limb. I don't want to have to have any more teeth capped.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It does make you look rather rugged, Master,&quot; one of the blonds commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Move it,&quot; Jensen ordered, as being kicked by an elderly man was not his definition of tough.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Master,&quot; the other blond spoke  and helped her twin carry him toward the basement, one arm restraining one of Patrick's arms and the other a leg.<br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
Once his Great-Grandfather was out of sight and hearing range, Jensen turned to the rest of the gathered Pack.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will use Zack's turn for him,&quot; Jensen answered, &quot;and he will NOT be an inanimate object.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the gargoyles outside?&quot; Hope asked, &quot;technically they are inanimate objects.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen paused to think about that. The Pack's gargoyle protectors were inanimate objects with the given ability to move, talk, see, and sense... things that an actual carved gargoyle could never hope of doing. And since no one would use their turn unless he allowed it... or was Kaylee in a fit of impulsiveness (which likely wouldn't happen since Kaylee's turn had been used with Fran and Darla's creation). It all left some room for thought.</p>
