<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jack was the first to reach a pleading hand out toward Farmer John. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh pleading, mercy no doubt, well mercy is something long lost about these here parts! You and your harlot will be on good use for me, and once you are used to your new selves I imagine you will find a healthy desire to fuck in the hay!&quot; said Farmer John with a sly grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, please we are here from another place, another time, to rescue two boys!&quot; begged Sarah as she too was feeling things changing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Silly girl, I'm to believe such a nobble story? No, no, no, I found two young and foolish people making love in my blessed barn! I tell them to come out and speak the truth, to confess their evil ways. Oh, but not then this ignorant fool tries to play me John Merlin to be a idiot! Well I have some powers left to me by my Grandfather. His books I hold dear and with them have kept me safe from the wicked Queen Mayella. I have a sty full of her guards and assassins! They come in groups of two or ten but once those of evil minds with a cause for killing walk past the front gate, they soon find their way to the sty. Swine, men who are swine of mind shall be swine of form too. She tempts me with maidens fair, yet as they come to call and becon me to lust they find their prudent place among the goats in my pasture. Oh be calm my dear your change is almost final, the pain will go and with it strength, stamina, and a desire to feel your frinds massive member plunged deep, so very deep!&quot; told Farmer John of Merlin.<br />
<br />
You can't stand it anymore, scared to death, and terrified by watching your sweetheart and Jack evermore changing into a pair of plow horses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your wrong!&quot; you shout from behind the haystack.<br />
<br />
A disturbed Farmer John of Merlin whirls about to stare at this new and grown man standing before him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who in this cold world are you?&quot; yelled farmer John.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am who I am and was with young Sarah in search of a youth who fell thru a magic mirror in a magic shop call Spells-r-Us!&quot; you state with a sound of solid courage.<br />
<br />
Framer John looks at you, then looks to the two youngsters almost changed to a pair of Belgian drafts. &quot;I think you speak the truth Man!&quot; said Farmer John.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do Sir I do, please let me tell you of our quest and the full story.&quot; you suggest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come then come to the house and we shall talk over your quest with a cup of my green tea.&quot; offered Farmer John.<br />
<br />
As he puts his big and strong hand upon your shoulder the two of you walk toward the barn's doors. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nieghie!&quot; comes from two scare young Belgian draft horses stand aside the other in the barn.<br />
<br />
You turn suddenly thinking of Sarah and Jack. &quot;John, what of my two friends?&quot; you ask looking to see the fine and strong pair of black animals.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Oh yes them, well it would have been nice if you had more courage and stood up a little earlier. They, huh, those two are now Belgian draft horses! I must check the books but if I reacon' the spell could be reversed in thirteen years.&quot; John said with a sad frown.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, but, they are...&quot; you try to urge him as if to beg for their reformation to human.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tisk, tisk my good man they are not in pain! Why an hour from now an nobody would ever guess that they were not born to their forms.&quot; then in a whisper he says, &quot;See the male sniff the rich scent she throughs. He is just now feeling the oncome of animal instincts. She too lowers her head in the instinctive submission to her mate. Oh, give them an hour and they will both be enthralled in the heat of wild passion, might even get a foal soon, well come on now we have things to consider.<br />
<br />
A quick gaze back toward the barn you see Jack stretching his stance and a draft horse penis erect and stiff. Sarah, her tail held high, head hung low, stands with hinds legs spread in an equine fond hope of sensual satisfaction.<br />
<br />
Once inside you sit down in a parlor room dressed and furnished in Elizabethan style.<br />
<br />
In walks John with a try holding a Rose patterned china teapot and two cups and saucers to match. &quot;Well you say this quest has to do with a boy?&quot; asked John.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes a boy named Tom, brash and quick of tongue to be spiteful, but still he is young and able to change as he would grow up, if he has the chance.&quot; you say. &quot;Oh yes, when Jack, Sarah, and I came here we had a young chap named Billy, have you seen him?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
John leans back in his chair, &quot;Billy you say! You must realize that when you stepped into the mirror, you stepped into a river of time itself. The flowing river of time rushes from one focal plain to another as it rushes in streams both forward and back. You might have stepped thru the mirror together but once in the mad rush of time you were split apart. Billy came here in what I might say was almost a year of this time in this place from today. I remember him well as he told his name as Billy. You must understand that in this Elizabethan time the slang word Billy does not suggest his true Christian name of William as what we would use here. He too showed up in the barn and came from out of nowhere, crashing down and landing on top of me as I milk Red, my Gurnsey cow.&quot; told John as you listen and look with eyes wide in horror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Red, she's here too!&quot; you shout.<br />
<br />
&quot;Red, Red is my cow, a milking cow, that's all!&quot; said John looking rather surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Red is,huh was Sarah's younger sister.&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well maybe in your time and on that focal plain but here Red was born a Gurnsey, and that's all she's ever been here!&quot; says John now with a small smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then what of Billy, is he here too?&quot; you ask showing your passion to find him before something horrible might happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Billy, yes him! Well he crashed down knocking me flat out. I might have been a little more considerate, but at that moment I was pulling my face from a warm and soft cow pie which Red had dropped when I began to milk her. As the boy sat up he laughed at me for where I had landed, that angered me well, you understand! Then as I wiped the shit from my face he told a simular story and asked about his friends Jack, Sarah, and you. Well I was then feeling a little less than willing to offer my friendship. I asked him who he was and that's when he said, Billy! I stared at him for being so brash and suggesting to me that any mother would name her son as if he were a goat. Well, as you might realize I was hot and he was still laughing at me, so I summoned my thoughts and cast him into the animal world as the brash and lusty creature he was named after. He's been a sound sire to the wealth of maidens and whores the Queen Mayella sent to baffle me into submission. As they are nanny goats, Billy is for them the buck goat which keeps the milk flowing and kids dropping. I think he's found his true self as a buck of a stud goat, don't you think?' asked John.<br />
<br />
A sigh as you lean back in your chair. The thought of Sarah and Jack as horses, trapped here for thirteen years! Billy, young jerk Billy now a sire goat fucking nannys for the rest of his life. Tom who must have entered the castle of Queen Mayella, you wonder what of him? Then here is you a grown man, ignorant of the rampent magic which is all around you in this a strange world. You sit for a moment deep in thoughts as one thinks of how to get back thur the mirror and your place in time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me Sir what is your plan for entering the castle of Medora?&quot; asked Farmer John of Merlin.</p>
