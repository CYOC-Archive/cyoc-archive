<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the unpredictability painful process of being shoed, which Jeff had unwillingly sat through on her enormous rear. Farmer John guided her by hand towards a different set of stables, and Jeff immediately felt her nerves acting up in more ways than one. It was about dusk now, and Jeff wasn’t exactly the most willing to get shoed so it took almost all day. Right as the two approached the door Jeff pulled back a bit, and Farmer John took notice to this and asked,&quot;Somethin&#39; wrong there Jessy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...&quot; Jeff said but paused nervously trying to come up with the right way to try to explain things to him, but then Farmer John suddenly laughed,&quot;Ha! I know that look there, you’re nervous bout meetin&#39; Prince aren’t ya?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff blushed as more thoughts of being humiliated like this alone entered her mind figuring that Prince was just as unknowledgeable about the Chronivac as anyone else here, and she nodded. &quot;I just....is this the best time?&quot; Jeff asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, don’t worry, Prince never tries jack shit on the first date, not until he knows ya or anything. Just be yourself, and don&#39;t worry bout a thing. He&#39;s the only stud here, plus, and don’t say a word to the other ladies, but there’s reasonin behind why none of&#39;em have seen him in awhile.&quot; Farmer John whispered to Jeff, who was still really nervous.<br />
<br />
Farmer John began to slowly open the door, but suddenly Jeff grabbed his hand and whimpered,&quot;But what if...?&quot; Jeff couldn’t finish her sentence as Farmer John gave her another strong slap on the rump, and that caused Jeff to jump again through the stable door. Jeff soon heard the sounds of chains, and a click from the door and she soon realized that she was now locked inside with Prince somewhere about.<br />
<br />
Jeff cautiously began walking forward, and suddenly she saw a light flare up in one of the stables, and she slowly walked towards it, her hooves clopping with each step she took worryingly. It wasn’t long before Jeff was now in sight of a full blooded American Quarter Horse, just minding his own business in the stable. Jess assumed this was Prince from the start as he was the only one here, and then she caught sight of his humongous equine dick and blushed. &quot;Uh....um...hello...&quot; Jeff spoke nervously and Prince sighed,&quot;What’s your deal friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...w....what?&quot; Jeff asked puzzled then Prince looked up at her and paused squinting at her then facepalmed and said,&quot;Dear god.....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I could go somewhere else until....&quot; Jeff began until Prince held up his hand and said,&quot;Stop talking, just tell me who you are and what your whole &#39;gimmick&#39; is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff cocked her head to the side and gave Prince a confused look and asked,&quot;Gimmick? What do ya mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
Prince paused then did the same thing Jeff with his expression then he said,&quot;You&#39;re....odd, I mean you’re whole gimmick is supposed to be what you like, your kinks, your body. I know mine is just standard considering how I was bred, but with you women it’s difficult, and yes I have an accent here that I like to use instead of what you grew up with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff paused at this then said,&quot;I&#39;m just new, and today’s been mighty hard between this, the shoeing and....well just about everythin is god damn screwy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, apologies then, but I don’t like smuts, and that WASN&#39;T a compliment.&quot; Prince said in a sour tone, and sarcastically <br />
<br />
&quot;Don’t call me that, because I ain’t no whore! I ain’t no slut! I ain’t no damn stripper! I don’t even wanna be here right now anyways!&quot; Jeff neighed in protest then Prince looked up at her and raised a brow.<br />
<br />
&quot;You’re different, your smarter than you look and sound at least. Most here call me charming, but all I do is mock the farmers around here and speak sarcastically just because everyone here is such a country hardass that they can only understand their own accents, as far as sarcasm is considered. If you’re worried about how you look in front of me then don’t worry, even though I&#39;m a breeder I don’t judge looks.....unless if it’s a horrific inbred horse.&quot; Prince said<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...I&#39;m just shy, and I don’t know my place here just yet. I honestly hate it here, and the first chance I get to get away from those other &#39;perfect&#39; hoes of mares, I will. I don’t wanna anythin to do with&#39;em and they already made that clearer than the space between you and I.&quot; Jeff exclaimed turning her back to the stable Prince was in and frowning with sorrow.<br />
<br />
Prince saw this and walked out of his stable to examine Jeff’s body. Prince then put his hooved hand to his chin and muttered,&quot;Not even a glance...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff then looked up at Prince and said,&quot;Ya say somethin Prince?&quot;<br />
<br />
Prince paused then walked closer and he asked,&quot;Who are you miss? I mean really, who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff paused gazing into Prince&#39;s eyes then she said,&quot;Jessy, at least that’s what everyone else call me. I already heard yours earlier if you were wonderin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, I&#39;d expect nothing less considering how I&#39;m the only stud here. You know, the reason I&#39;m called Prince is because of that and because I’m.....from the city. I guess I&#39;m off your standards now that you know that, so...&quot; Prince began then Jeff interrupted him,&quot;Whatcha mean by that? You’re the only halfway decent thing that I met here, and that’s puttin things lightly. I&#39;m honestly glad that I came here now, buuut....as far as the whole breedin thing. Wellll, I&#39;m just not so willing on my part.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait what? You’re a breeding mare, of course you’re.....&quot; Prince began then Jeff looked down at herself and blushed feeling embarrassed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I uh...I think I see what’s wrong now Jessy.&quot; Prince said now leaning next to her and Jeff looked to him and asked,&quot;Wait, ya do? Ya actually, genuinely know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh course, you were bred for breeding, but you don’t want to breed. I mean in more complex terms you want to be a different kind of mare, but unfortunately you ended up this way because of how you look. Kind of brings me back to a nostalgic period of my comfused teenage life. Either way, if you want to breed with me then you have my permission, and I promise to take it easy with you starting off. Nothing over the top until you want it, that okay with you?&quot; Prince asked putting his hands on Jeff’s hips, and she paused looking up at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I uh....sure, I&#39;d like that alot actually.&quot; Jeff said thinking that Prince didn’t exactly get her situation correct, but he was close enough to give her some time to figure out the whereabouts of the Chronivac, and give her a last resort in case she doesn’t. Jeff could only blush as Prince lead her into his stable,&quot;When’s Farmer John comin back?” She asked<br />
<br />
&quot;He comes if I call him, but for now just relax and feel safe that I&#39;m the only male on the farm. If any of those smuts tries anything with you then I&#39;ll be close by, the field is the same, and our stables are nearby too. If I can I&#39;ll see if you can stay here with me, or perhaps somewhere private.&quot; Prince said and she smiled warmly and nodded to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jeff said and Prince followed that up with a small kiss on the cheek, and the two layed down in a pile of hay together with arms wrapped around each other.<br />
<br />
The next day the two of them woke up, and as the day progressed...</p>
