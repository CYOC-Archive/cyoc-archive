<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Drake sat outside his building trying to decide what to do. He had so many choices now; he threw many options around in his head- should he make himself hairy like he always wanted; should he be built; should he grant Ethan his desire to have 20/20 vision? He couldn’t decide. Drake placed the lamp in his bag and got out of the car. He started walking away from the dorm building, he needed to think this all through. <br />
<br />
One thing stood out in his head- he knew nothing about Djinn. He knew they were like Genies, but didn’t they twist your wishes round or something? Drake had a nagging remembrance about them being evil. One way to find out, he crossed campus to the library. He found himself a quiet spot in a corner and accessed the University network. The on-line encyclopaedias were generally useless. All Encarta had to say was: <br />
ge•nie <br />
magical spirit in stories: a magical spirit in Arabian folklore that has supernatural powers and will obey the commands of the person who summons it.   <br />
jin•ni (plural djinn) <br />
Islamic magic spirit: in Islamic mythology, a spirit that can take on various human and animal forms and makes mischievous use of its supernatural powers.   <br />
<br />
Real useful. Drake decided to hit the real books and grabbed the Dictionary of Myths and Folklore. Half an hour later Drake was surrounded by books and scribbled notes. None of the books or encyclopaedias could agree- where Djinn evil? Some yes, other maybe, one said no- but they took your soul as payment for the wish. And some said one wish, others three ala Aladdin. One book seemed to have lifted its definition straight form the Disney movie. They could or could not shape change or leave their lamp. Only thing Drake could be sure of, Djinn granted wishes. He rubbed his tried eyes and the lamp caught his attention again, peeking out from his bag. <br />
“Let go right to the source” he mumbled to himself and pulled it out. Taking a quick look around to ensure he was alone Drake rubbed the lamp<br />
<br />
Once again a fog flowed from the lamps spout and Beldazarr, The Djinn of Mind and Body appeared. Drake noticed that like the various illustrations he’d found Beldazarr was muscular, and smooth shaven. His face was square with a prominent nose and bright intelligent eyes. His hair was hidden in a white turban. He wore no clothes on his dark brown torso but had a metal circlet on each bicep, they glinted gold and had strange markings on them that Drake could not read. Beldazarr body vanished into mist just under his square abs at the navel. He floated at about the six foot level.<br />
“Greetings Mortal! Beldazarr cried “What is your next wish!” <br />
“Shhhhhh” Drake said in reflex to were he was. Beldazarr looked confused but lowered his tone.<br />
“Is better for you Master?” he inquired with laughter in his much deeper voice. Drake found that voice sent a shiver up his spine and not in a bad way either. <br />
“Yes” he said quietly. <br />
“Have you decided on a wish?” Beldazarr asked.<br />
“Er……no” Drake said “I wanted to ask you some questions, er…..if you don’t mind”<br />
“You are the Master” the Djinn said with a small bow. Drake shuffled the paper in front of him and looked back up into the Djinn’s eyes<br />
“Er….can you take a seat or something” he said waving at the empty chair. <br />
“If you wish” Drake twitched a bit at ‘wish’ but gestured to the chair again. Beldazarr floated himself over it and lowered himself down until his eyes were level with Drakes. A small trail of fog led back to the lamp.<br />
<br />
Drake waved a hand at the paperwork<br />
“None of this gives me any idea of what or who you are. I don’t know what I am getting into” The Djinn smiled and Drake was unsurprised by the perfectly even white teeth.<br />
“What would you like to know” he said in that low voice.<br />
“Well…..are you evil?” The Djinn let out a roar of a laugh. Drake looked around in case anyone had heard but the few people he could see across the library had not even looked up<br />
“No Master. I am not evil as you understand it. What people have done with my wishes my be considered evil, but I myself am not” Drake leaned back in his chair.<br />
“You are not evil, but you let people do evil things with their wishes?” he said trying to turn the concept round.<br />
“Of course. It is not the instrument that is evil, but the way in which it is used” <br />
“But you could stop them” Drake protested<br />
“Yes I could but it would be preventing them the wish they wanted. I have to provide wishes, it is what I do. One per lamp rub, as I explained to you” <br />
“Can you not give a wish?”<br />
“No Master, once the lamp is rubbed I stay out until the Master makes a wish. Deliberate or not, that’s the wish that comes true.”<br />
“I need to be very careful what I say then?” the Djinn smiled again<br />
“Yes Master. Very”<br />
“Please don’t call me Master, my name is Drake” Beldazarr nodded. There was a pause<br />
<br />
“The stories say that Djinn are tied to their lamp for a thousand years, is that true?”<br />
“No Mas….Drake….that is not”<br />
“How long then?” Beldazarr looked a little uncomfortable, unfolding and folding his thick arms. <br />
“It depends” he said<br />
“On?”  Drake leaned forward expectantly.<br />
“What you did” Drake opened his mouth to say something but Beldazarr’s eye grew dark and he stared directly into Drakes. Drake could not move or turn away as Beldazarr said in almost a whisper<br />
“Never ask me about the how’s, whys, where’s, and wherefores of Djinn. It is safer for you that way” Drake could sense the danger in his voice<br />
“I will” he said quietly. <br />
“It is most important” the Djinn said in a more normal tone. Drake sat back a little shaken nodding. <br />
<br />
Drake stared out of the window for a moment. <br />
“I need a drink” he said and began packing up the books and notes. <br />
“You said mind or body, single or multiple, any place or time yes?”<br />
“Yes”<br />
“So could I wish that Mankind’s ancestors had twice as much body hair and it would affect us now?”<br />
Beldazarr tilted his head and a small smile grew on his lips<br />
“In all the centuries I don’t believe anyone has asked such a question. But yes if you wished” <br />
“Would it have much impact though?” <br />
“Who can say Master? That is not my job” It was Drakes turn to laugh<br />
“I suppose you and the lamp will exist however weird I wished the world? <br />
“Yes Master Drake, we would”.  Something suddenly occurred to Drake <br />
“Can we travel through time?” he said, visions of Roman legionaries filling his head.<br />
“No Drake, I can change or transform any aspect of a subject or multiple subjects in either or mind or body, and in the past, present, or future, but I cannot take you there”<br />
“Ah ha, but I could wish for say Ethan my history friend to have the memories, attitude and abilities of a Roman Senator?”<br />
“If you worded your wish very carefully yes” Drake grinned at the Djinn. <br />
<br />
With his books packed Drake looked at the Djinns fog trail. <br />
“Is it possible for you to appear properly?” Beldazarr looked shocked<br />
“But every one could see me then. Some may wish to take me from you”<br />
“But no one can while I have the lamp right?” <br />
“Correct. Someone would have to take it from you” <br />
“So all I have to do is keep it hidden” Beldazarr looked very uneasy<br />
“Perhaps if I was to make it appear that you were not having a conversation with thin air?” he suggested. <br />
“Yeah ok.” Drake said. He wasn’t going to push right now, but he must find out about the ‘coming out’ problem. <br />
“Let’s get that drink” he said.<br />
<br />
On the way to the refectory Drake asked lots of basic questions about Djinn eating, drinking, and sleeping. None of which they needed. He didn’t ask about sex. Drake grabbed a Coke and went outside since it was a nice day.  He nabbed a bench in the University grounds and made Beldazarr ‘sit’ too. <br />
“You had many Masters who could not make up their minds about what they wanted?” he asked the Djinn.<br />
“Few Master….Drake. Most start playing with their wishes almost immediately without asking anything. One long gone Master managed to get himself killed 2 hours after getting the lamp due to a badly worded wish involving turning himself inside out.” Drake made a face “I won’t bore you with the details”<br />
<br />
A young man sat on the bench opposite them and starting reading a maths book. He was 6’ 5”, with nice brown eyes and a very hairy, thin but trim build. Drake knew him from the Uni gym. While Drake merely ran maintenance on his swimmers body, the man opposite spend ages in there trying to get bigger. Drake suddenly remembered his name.<br />
“Tom” he said sticking out a hand. The man looked up from his book<br />
“Drake” he said in a light voice shaking Drakes hand. “Good to see you”<br />
“How are the weights coming?” Drake asked. Tom rolled his eyes.<br />
“Slowly; I gained almost nothing this month. I want to be gaining much faster.”<br />
“What your ideal?” Drake had an idea forming.<br />
“Ideally I’d be as big as Nasser, or Yates. Big enough not to be pushed around anymore!” Tom said it with such passion that Drake blinked in surprise.<br />
“You get trouble?” he said “I thought the gym guys helped out with that?” <br />
“They did, but it’s the not the big threats, it all the little things all day. I swear Bear’s got it in for me. Feet in way, elbows in guts, you name it.” <br />
“So how much bigger would you have to be to deal with Bear?”<br />
“Big alone won’t cover it, the bastards brains as well as brawn, but I’d say 220- 240lbs all of it muscle. Then I’d kick his ass. Call me a faggot! I hear he’s had half the guys on campus. Just cos I turned him down…….” Drake tuned out Tom’s rant and talked to the air next to him.<br />
“Beldazarr, could I make a wish that affected someone over a period of time?” <br />
“Certainly Master” the Djinn confirmed. <br />
“Tom Drake said cutting into the man’s tirade “have you tried Veg X?” <br />
“Veg X? What that?” <br />
“It’s new. I saw it in the Health Shop, it’s a supplement supposed to get you real big quick” Tom snorted <br />
“They all say that”<br />
“True, but why don’t you try it? Might work and you wanna get big yes?”<br />
“Oh man, I so wish I was big”<br />
“So do I. I wish Tom that if you take Veg X regularly you will grow right up to your 240lb target muscle weight”<br />
“Granted” Beldazarr said in Drakes ear and vanished. Tom smiled at Drake<br />
“That’s very good of you” he said. “You sound like a commercial” Drake grinned at him back. He’d actually made it up. As he remembered Veg X was a burger Soya mix thing for ‘promoting healthy living, strength and hair growth.’  Still he wasn’t forcing Tom to take it. <br />
“Look, nice to run into you again. Gotta go” Drake stood up <br />
“No problem. I’ll see you in the gym.” Drake nodded a goodbye and walked away from Tom. <br />
<br />
As he walked Drake ran the wording of his wish over in his head. Had be left a hole? He couldn’t think of one. Tom will get big if he took Veg X, exactly as he wanted. Drake smiled to himself and started whistling as he walked. He kinda liked this helping people thing. Why use the lamp for totally selfish ends? <br />
<br />
Drake starting looking for others to help. He passed several friends and class mates. Who needed help and who didn’t? he took another seat and summoned up Beldazarr. <br />
“What is your wish Master?” he said. Drake gave him a sly grin.<br />
“Nothing yet, just wanted you here for when I do. Besides I might have more questions for you”. <br />
“As you will” Beldazarr said and floated down next to him on the bench. Drake looked round. So many people so little time…… <br />
<br />
Then Drake spotted someone that really needed his help……..</p>
