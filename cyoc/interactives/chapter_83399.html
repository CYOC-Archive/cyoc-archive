<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ouch! Joe jumped from the toilet as he felt the sharp pain resonate through his body. ‘What the hell was that?’ he wondered as he examined his costumed body in the bathroom mirror. Joe rubbed his eyes in confusion, convinced that they were playing tricks on him. Was the costume… rippling?<br />
<br />
Joe stared awestruck at his reflection as the strange undulation continued. He prodded his swollen nose with one of the suit’s stiff, hoof-like hands, when it suddenly, inexplicably, bulged further. Joe watched, eyes wide, as his nostrils widened and his nose rounded, the golden nose ring gleaming as the motion caused it to jingle. His mouth followed suit and pushed out into an unmistakable muzzle, as he felt his teeth flatten and his tongue thicken within the confines of his new snout. Short black and white splotched fur sprouted on his changing face, looking remarkably like the fur of the cow-girl costume. Joe gaped dumbly as his uncovered face slowly warped to match the rest of his costumed body. <br />
<br />
Or was it still costumed? Joe realized with a sick jolt that he could no longer see the seam of the costume’s hood framing his face. He contorted his arms desperately, trying to fumble at the zipper that ran down the suit’s back. Why can’t I reach it? He thought hysterically. It has to be there! He shook his head back and forth, trying to look behind him and catch a glimpse of the damned zipper. Joe felt the costume’s floppy ears smack against his face and neck as he twisted his head back and forth. Joe stopped his ministrations and peered confusedly at the costume’s elongated, furry ears, dangling from his changed head. Had they always looked that real? He flinched, startled, as one twitched and swiveled on its own accord. The costume’s short, curved horns no longer looked like hardened plastic either… Joe poked at one with a costumed hand and was nervous, though unsurprised, to find it had become solid, unyielding bone. <br />
<br />
The rest of the costume was slowly morphing to look more realistic as well, to Joe’s ever-increasing dread. What once had been a loose-fitting, if well-made, piece of fabric, was now growing more lifelike by the second. His entire body itched as the fur covering his form grew slightly and became more well-defined. A dark tuft on top of his head ruffled in the breeze, as he grew into the splotched black-on-white patterned pelt. Bones cracked painlessly as his thighs thickened, becoming plump, and his legs grew more curvaceous. Joe tottered unsteadily as his legs changed shape, his new hooves clopping loudly on the tile floor. He leaned forward to steady himself, and winced as his hand-hooves made a similar clopping sound against the ceramic sink. He lifted his slimming arms and inspected his hands… although you couldn’t really call them hands any more. The thick, dark nail of the costume had spread, leaving little more than a cloven hoof in its place… it was clear that his dexterity had taken a big hit.<br />
<br />
Joe whimpered as the tingling feeling re-centered on his rear. He watched in the mirror as the thin, ropy tail attached to his backside lengthened and began to twitch on its own, rather than hanging limply as it had moments before. The dark tuft on the tip of his tail flicked lazily back and forth, drawing attention to his rump as it fattened and lifted into a perkier position. Soon, to Joe’s chagrin, his undeniably feminine ass had ballooned into a rounded, enormous beach ball. Joe shifted his wider hips, unwillingly setting off his now shapely rump in an enticing wiggle. “&quot;This can&#39;t be real. This can&#39;t be real. This can&#39;t be real.&quot; Joe repeated, his voice softer, having lost some of its masculine timber, trying to deny the unwelcome changes to his body. His entire lower half looked like a cross between a beautiful woman and a cow, and the costume wasn’t finished with him just yet. <br />
<br />
Joe cringed as the nightmarish transformation progressed to the change that he’d been fearing most. “Aaaghh..” He let out a husky moan as he felt the costume’s breasts grow and swell, getting heavier by the second. Joe grabbed at the tits with his hooved hands, gasping with alarming pleasure as they grew beneath his grip, bigger and bigger. Finally, the growth ceased, and Joe released the great mounds of flesh cupped in his hands with a terrified whimper. His twin jugs fell heavily to his chest, where they bounced with staggering heft.  Before their transition from empty cloth to real-life flesh and blood, the costume’s breasts had been large, but they’d also been light and baggy. Now… now they were immense, firm and weighty, but also clearly soft, as they jiggled mesmerizingly, capped with large, pink nipples. This is too much, Joe thought in a daze.<br />
<br />
But it wasn’t over yet. Joe had almost forgotten about the costume’s other appendage, but he was quickly reminded as the tingling concentrated on it, intent on subjugating him to this final indignity. Because what cow is complete without an udder? Like his new breasts, the udder inflated and expanded, gaining in weight as it went from simple cloth to fatty tissue. Soon it hung heavily between his spotted knees, massive as it curved jutting from his belly to halfway down his legs. He poked at it, watching dumbfounded as it swayed ponderously from side to side, topped with four puffy, wagging teats. It brushed constantly against his furry legs, exasperating him to no end as it never let him forget its existence for even a moment.<br />
<br />
Joe stood frozen in the bathroom, looking into the mirror with shock and disbelief. He searched his reflection desperately for the man he knew he was but instead there stood a female anthro-bovine with huge, billowy breasts, a big rounded butt, and a bulging udder.  A cow.  Joe, whether willing or not, had changed completely from horn to hoof. His ropey tail twitched nervously back and forth. Somehow, the costume had become real, and worst of all, he had no idea how to get out of it. The horrifying reality was that this body was his now, and he was struggling to accept that he was now a big-breasted, sexy cow-girl with an enormous, swollen udder. <br />
<br />
But was he truly a girl? While the huge tits and udder screamed yes, he didn’t know that for sure… or so Joe tried to reassure himself. Last time I saw my penis, I’d shoved it inside of this damned udder… maybe it slipped out and is underneath it? He thought, hoping against hope. He poked a hooved-hand gingerly against the top of his swollen udder, flinching and withdrawing his hand quickly at the strange, unwelcome sensation of feeling from within the udder, forcing him to acknowledge, once again, that the bloated milk-bag was indeed his. It was a part of him now, no matter how much he wished it were not. Joe gathered his courage, and stretched his furry arms around the ample confines of his udder, reaching down well past his knees to gather the entire unwieldy appendage in his grasp. He snorted, thick nostrils blowing out gusts of air as he pushed the burdensome udder to the side, its abundant flesh yielding as it squished against his legs. Joe peered down, trying to see his crotch beneath the udder. He grunted, embarrassed, as his bovine muzzle rested distractingly between his tremendous breasts, his dark, moist nose tickling uncomfortably as it pushed his cleavage apart. And it was all for nothing. His udder was simply too big. Joe could barely see the tips of his cloven hooves peeking around the periphery of his gigantic udder, let alone his crotch which was nestled right beneath it. With a sigh, Joe dropped his heavy milk sac, and lifted his muzzle from his tits. His bust quivered as his great breasts pushed back against one another into their captivating cleavage, and his udder flopped strenuously back between his knees, wobbling vigorously as it settled into place between his legs. <br />
<br />
Joe felt like crying. The alien sensations assaulting the former human male were too much for his shell-shocked mind to take. But he was determined, almost sadistically, to finish what he’d started. So he took one stiff hand and groped awkwardly between his legs, burying the hoof beneath his fleshy, squishy udder as he reached towards his groin. He gasped as he brushed accidentally against one puffy, sensitive teat. But suddenly, he was there, and before he knew what was happening, his hoof had slipped inside a moist, warm slit. It was undeniable now. He was fully female, and a cow to boot. “Ungh- MooooOOOOO!” Joe moaned unconsciously. His eyes widened at the sound and he clasped his hooves over his snout, one still damp from its recent exploration into his new feminine anatomy. <br />
<br />
“Joe? What was that? Are you ok in there?” To Joe’s chagrin, Anna was back outside the bathroom door. Joe, trying to figure out what to do, caught another glimpse of himself – herself – in the mirror. The long ropey tail, cute little white horns, thick snout (with large brass ring clipped through his nostrils), floppy ears, awkward hooves that had replaced his hands and feet, furry splotched skin – and worst of all – seductive rounded butt, immense tits, and bulging udder jeered obscenely back at him, and he still could not believe that it was real and that strange, titillating cow-girl was him. I can’t let her see me like this! But it was too late to stop her, and the door was flung open with a thunderous crash.</p>
