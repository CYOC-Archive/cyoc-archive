<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I don't wanna wear it,&quot; Nick exclaimed in a childish, defiant tone and stamping her foot, she added, &quot;It's for a girl. I'm not a girl,&quot; failing to see how weird it was for her to be saying such a things as her actions, voice and any number of things clearly shouted that she was a girl.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, Heather looked at her younger self, who had been her boyfriend up until about eleven minutes ago and explained, &quot;You only have to wear it until we figure out why and how you changed and how to turn you back,&quot; thrusting the romper she was holding, the only piece of clothing she could find that wasn't in tatters, at Nick.<br />
<br />
As she remember how she had loved to where the garment she was attempting to get Nick to wear, she added, &quot;You cannot go about in nothing but an over-sized shirt. Its indecent.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at romper, taking in the fact that it had a ruffle around the waist line, was pink, had pink, purple and white hearts printed on it and had to pink bows affixed to the thin shoulder straps, Nick crossed her arms definitely and stared, &quot;I shan't wear it. I'll be called a sissy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not sissy for a girl to wear girl's clothing,&quot; Heather explained.<br />
<br />
Stomping her foot again, Nick screamed out, &quot;I am not a girl and I shan't wear something girly,&quot; and turning about, she took off through the house, leaving Heather wondering if her mother had ever had any problems like these with her.<br />
<br />
As she ran through the house, Nick could feel the tears stinging her eyes again and wondering about how she come to be in this situation, she took refuge in a closet off the kitchen. Curling up underneath a shelf, lying on the heating and cooling grate, which was pumping out cool air from the house's central air system, Nick stuck her thumb in her mouth as she felt the tears once again beginning to fall. &quot;How could she treat me like that?&quot; she thought as she stared at the back of the closet door.<br />
<br />
Unsure of what she should do and why she suddenly felt like crying so much, unable to remember fully much of her life as Nick, let along her childhood as Nick, she lay there and when a funny feeling began to creep over her, Nick did nothing, thinking, &quot;Nothing could be worse then what has happened to me,&quot; as a pressure in her abdomen began to build.<br />
<br />
Without warning, Nick could suddenly feel a wetness spreading from between her legs to the front, where is caused her shirt to stick, to the back, where is had the same effect on the over-sized shirt and after a moment, Nick heard a dripping noise as something trickled down into the air vent. Taking her thumb from her mouth, Nick touched the wetness that was slowly spreading across the front of her shirt and smelling her hand, she grimaced when it became clear that what had happened was that her bladder had let go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; Nick thought, a feeling of shame spreading just as quick as the urine and climbing out from underneath the shelf, she stood and looked at the spot she had been lying.<br />
<br />
After a moment, she shucked off the shirt, disliking how suddenly cold the liquid felt against her skin, the way the garment clung to her skin and how it seemed to be tied to her feeling of shame. Tossing it on the floor, looking down to were her genitals were located, she wondered how it was a girl dealt with peeing, something inside her young mind saying that she sat on the potty like a good girl and wiped afterward, like mommy had taught her.<br />
<br />
No longer wanting to be hiding in the closet, but at the same time upset about what she must do, Nick let herself out of the closet. Walking slowly through the house, she eventually found Heather packing up stuff in the main bedroom. Without waiting to see if the other girl knew of her presence, Nick stated, &quot;I hadda ax-i-dent,&quot; and then just stood there, the shame she was feeling growing.<br />
<br />
Instead of scolding her, like Nick thought Heather would, Nick's former girlfriend merely set down the items she was holding and holding out her hand, she said, &quot;Let's get you cleaned up,&quot; and when Nick took the offered hand and allowed herself to be led to the bathroom, she offered no complaint when Heather commented, &quot;You know that you'll have to wear the romper,&quot; to which Nick merely nodded in shameful silence, despising the shame he was feeling and how it felt like everything, from her body to whatever had brought about her change, was betraying him.<br />
<br />
Afterward, cleaned and wearing the romper Heather had insisted that she wore, Nick sat on a chair at the kitchen table, eating a peanut butter sandwich, upset the way the way the article of clothing she was wearing rode up and pressed into her privates, leaving no question that she was indeed a girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;There,&quot; Heather announced as she tossed several bits of paper towelling into the trash bin and sitting down, she said, &quot;I got as much as I could get cleaned up, though the urine that leaked down the register is a bit out of my reach and I'll probably have to have a professional come in to clean it,&quot; as she reached for the jar of peanut butter, the knife and two slices of bread.<br />
<br />
Her feet swinging back at forth, gently knocking into the rungs of the chair, Nick announced, &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For what?&quot; Heather asked as she spread the peanut butter on the bread. &quot;You had an accident. It's to be expected. There is nothing to be sorry about,&quot; and slapping a slice of bread on the one she had been spreading the peanut butter on, she asked, &quot;You sure you left your shirt in the kitchen closet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, Nick replied, &quot;Uh-huh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Strange,&quot; Heather said in an absent manner and seeing the look on the four year old's face, she explained, &quot;When I went back to the closet to look for anything that might hint toward why you transformed, I noted that your pants, underwear, sock and shoes had vanished. Now, it appears your shirt has disappeared as well. Almost as if whatever changed into a four year old version me is trying to keep you from turning back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scared, Nick dropped the rest of her sandwich and wailed out, &quot;I don' wanna be a girl,&quot; the sting of tears once again pricking her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you shan't have to be, sweetheart,&quot; Heather said, setting her own sandwich down and reaching over to comfort the girl. &quot;As soon as we figure out what happened, we'll get you back to being your normal, happy, male self. Okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, forcing the tears not to fall, Nick picked up her sandwich and took a couple more bites before setting it down. Looking at her former girlfriend, she asked, &quot;May I be excused?&quot; to which Heather nodded in an absent manner as Nick slid out of her seat and began to wander through the house, slowly making her way back to main bedroom.<br />
<br />
There, she paused and after a couple seconds, she went in. Peeping into the closet, taking in the mess, she wondered what it was that had caused her to change, noting that Heather had been right and that her former clothes were indeed missing. Trudging into the closet, Nick shifted aside a couple items but stopped after a bit when it became clear she had no idea what it was she was looking for. Exiting out the closet, she climbed onto the bed and sticking her thumb into her mouth, she curled up in a fetal position, thoughts about having to grow up all over again, this time as a girl, racing through her mind. After a couple minutes of lying there, her eyelids began to droop and within moments, she was asleep, her last conscious thought being, “I am not a girl and I refuse to be one.”<br />
<br />
Coming back from the kitchen, Heather stepped into her mother's room, noted the sleeping form of her four year old self, and heading for the closet, she began to pick up the room. As she did, she sorted through the items, deciding what to keep and what to get rid of. When she came across the amulet, she picked it up by the chain and studied the disk, unable to fully make out what was on it, just that it had a word that she did not think was an English word.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this?&quot; she asked herself, wondering where it was that her mother had got such a thing and figuring she would take it down to the local jewellery store later to get it appraised and see if they had any information on it, she slipped it around her neck and dropped the medallion beneath her shirt.</p>
