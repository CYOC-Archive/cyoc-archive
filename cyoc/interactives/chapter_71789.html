<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">We walked into the mansion with great anticipation.  Our anticipation turned to apprehension as we began to <br />
look around.  The place was very dark, and it became darker still as we closed the front door behind us.  It <br />
seemed that curtains covered all of the windows and very little light was able to peak in from outdoors.<br />
<br />
Immediately in front of us was a grand staircase.  It looked like the one in “Gone With the Wind” since it was <br />
very wide at the bottom and narrowed gradually as it reached the next floor.  To either side of the staircase <br />
were two rooms that had ceilings that reached all the way to the third floor, save for a small area that was <br />
the second floor.  The second floor started at the top of the stairs, but it pushed back into the house rather <br />
than taking up the entire level.  The two rooms we saw appeared to be living rooms.  <br />
<br />
We decided to explore the house in a clockwise manner.  We entered the living room on the left.  The furniture <br />
remained in the mansion but it was all covered in white sheets.  For now we decided not to look under them, <br />
for we wanted to see all the mansion had to offer.  As we further explored the house we discovered a multitude <br />
of rooms.  We found a huge dining room, which appeared should only be used if a lot of guests were at the <br />
house.  Adjacent to the dining room was what we determined to be a ball room.  <br />
<br />
We found our way into the kitchen next.  It was bigger than any kitchen I’d ever seen in my life.  One could <br />
easily run a restaurant out of this kitchen.  This was going to be a great place to improve our cooking <br />
skills.  There was a small eating area adjacent to the kitchen as well.  <br />
<br />
Eventually we discovered a huge indoor pool.  Next to the pool were a sauna and an area that appeared to be <br />
made for spa services.  The pool area seemed to provide the only direct access to the grounds aside from the <br />
front door.  There was an empty garden that showed now evidence of being tended in some time.  The garden also <br />
sat right against the mansion walls.  There was a backyard that appeared rather plan, which eventually gave <br />
way to the woods.  <br />
<br />
The woods extended in a very wide range from left to right, practically as far as we could see.  The trees <br />
were extremely tall.  They were taller than any trees I had ever seen previously.  Something told me that we <br />
should stay clear of those woods.  Considering how big the woods appeared to be, it gave the appearance of a <br />
place where one could too easily get lost.<br />
<br />
We returned to the staircase and ascended to the second level.  At the top of the staircase was a hall that <br />
extended in each direction.  We could look down into the two living rooms from it.  On each end of the hall <br />
was another staircase that led to the third floor.  We made quick inspection of the second floor which <br />
contained rooms that were meant to be used as offices, a gym, and other indeterminable functions.<br />
<br />
In the third floor there was nothing but huge bedrooms.  They all had beds that could easily fit three people.  <br />
There was also a large balcony at the back of the third floor.  It looked like the perfect place to just lay <br />
in the sun for several hours.<br />
<br />
“This place needs a lot of upkeep,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Isn’t that what your ring is for?” Nicole asked.  “I mean, this place isn’t exactly ‘move-in ready.’”<br />
<br />
“I can’t argue with that,” I agreed.  So I wished that the house was in pristine condition, with all of the <br />
furnishings uncovered and in top condition.  I also wished that the house was completely clean, that the <br />
kitchen was stocked, that the pool was filled and ready to use, and that all of our clothes and possessions <br />
from our apartment were in the house.  We spent the next half hour or so making sure that the wish fulfilled <br />
all of its intentions.<br />
<br />
Once our wish inspection was finished, and we determined that everything we asked for was done, we headed for <br />
the pool.  I bent down and put my hand in the water in order to gauge its temperature.  “Nice and warm,” I <br />
said.  Suddenly a figure jumped over my head and directly into the pool.  The splash of water got a good <br />
portion of my clothes drenched.  <br />
<br />
I turned around and saw Nicole’s clothes in a pile.  I looked back at the pool to see Nicole’s head emerge <br />
from the water.  She smiled at me and then laughed when she saw that I was wet.  “Might as well join me,” she <br />
said.  <br />
<br />
I took off my shoes and then my socks.  I smiled at her and said, “Might as well.”  With that I jumped into <br />
the pool.<br />
<br />
“You’re a riot,” Nicole laughed at me once my head was above water.<br />
<br />
“I could use some help getting these off,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Ooh, my pleasure,” she said.  We struggled together to strip off my clothes.  As soon as I was naked we began <br />
another torrid love making session.  After we were done Nicole asked me, “What do you want to do next?”</p>
