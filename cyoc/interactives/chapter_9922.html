<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">
<P>Tim continued to grow , unrelentingly. His head began to brush against the rafters in the attic of the house. </P>
<P>With more and more of the house falling to the ground floor and onto his lap, He decided that it might be a good idea to grab the chest from the remains of his room before it became damaged. It was a tight fit, but he managed to reach for the box and clasp it safely in his expanding palm.</P>
<P>"won’t be long now" he though to himself as he hunched over a little to get a little more comfortable in his shrinking habitat. </P>
<P>From below him, Tim could make out a faint noise. It seemed to be small popping and groaning sounds. Shortly thereafter, the entire house seemed to gain several inches in height, from his perspective. </P>
<P>"What the Hell?"</P>
<P>The floor had given way and Tim had fallen into the basement. This afforded him a bit more room to plan his eventual grand entrance. Getting onto his knees, he crouched down into the smallest ball he could manage and still breathe. He opened his hand to make sure that the chest was still alright after his drop into the basement. He carefully opened the lid and looked inside. Everything seemed to be fine from the looks of it. His back and shoulders began to , once again rise through the ceiling of the first floor as his body grew up from the basement. He could hear things being moved about him by the displacement of his growth. Suddenly a piece of ceiling beam broke loose and came to rest inside the chest.</P>
<P>" Oh SHIT!" he bellowed</P>
<P>His fingers at that size were not well suited for fine work like the retrieval of the pieces of wood and plaster that had fallen into chest and the fact that they were getting bigger didn’t make anything easier. After several tries, Tim managed to extract the pieces that had fallen. But as he removed the final piece there seemed to be , what appeared to be the chest shorting out. There were several bright flashes and sparks and whiffs of smoke.</P>
<P>"uh ho"</P>
<P>Tim noticed, immediately that his growth had stopped. He examined the box. The flashing and smoke had subsided and there were s few small scorch marks on the outside surfaces of the lid. But the examination of the box would have to wait until later.</P>
<P>His attention was drawn away from damage by the oddest sensation of pressure building up in his body. The feeling steadily built up until his body began to expand outward. He didn’t have much room to look down at himself but from what he could see he was getting stronger. The pressure ran its course and the expansion of his muscles subsided. Tim thought that he might as well stand up and get it over with but he soon felt himself begin to grow once more. Upward he surged , faster than before his massive back and shoulders pressing upward into the story above. He was elated to know that the box hadn’t been damaged. Faster and faster he grew ,his back beginning to brush the rafters of the attic once more. </P>
<P>To anyone walking past the house, what happened next would be a sight to tell your grandchildren. Within the house, Tim continued his pattern of growing followed by expanding. Outside the house began to show the torture that was being inflicted on it. It began to creak and groan as his body began to press against not only the roof, but what was left of the upstairs floors and walls. The house , itself, appeared to be swelling. Clapboards began to break loose from the outside walls. The windows shattered and the doors burst free from their hinges. The peaked roof began to bow upward and the shingles fell like leaves in the fall as the roof was pressed up and away from the crumbling lower structures.</P>
<P>Tim reared up and stretched his arms, free from the confines of the house which had now crumbled to dust all around him. As he stood, the full glory of his transformation began to set in. He had to be over 100 feet tall and the process continued. With each phase he seemed to be growing faster. Pulse after pulse , wave after wave of ecstasy passed through him as he passed 200….250…300…400…600…and then he seemed to slow and stop. Looking down at the incredibly small box in his hand, Tim noticed that it was sparking again.</P>
<P>A new wave of pressure began to build inside his massive frame. His muscles began to grow once more, but this time the growth in his overall size to compensate did not occur. Something had gone wrong. In the place of what should have been full growth, another swelling of his muscles occurred, followed by several more in rapid succession. As his arms were pressed farther and farther from his sides he lost his grip on the , now tiny, chest and it fell to the ground.</P>
<P>He couldn’t dwell on that for long. He was getting too big. The pressure was building inside him but unlike before it did not subside as his muscles grew. More and more pressure built up inside him swelling his muscles up and out to inhuman proportions……………he was growing out of all control.</P></p>
