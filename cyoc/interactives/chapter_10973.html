<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Steve started working on his math homework, the scent from the candle was starting to fill the room.<br />
<br />
He was working on a particularly aggravating calculus problem when its effects first started.<br />
<br />
He felt a little light headed and quickly found his aggravation over the problem fading. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know what's in that thing, but damn, suddenly this doesen't feel so bad&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly feeling a little itchy on his neck, he gently scratched it with his left hand as he continued to work on the problem.<br />
<br />
As he finished the problem, his arms started to itch. He put down his pencil this time and scratched his left arm with his right hand and vise versa. It was then that he noticed something was very wrong.<br />
<br />
The fine black hair on his arms had turned a yellow color and more hair appeared to be growing between each strand.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the heck is this?&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
He knew he should have been very upset at this point but something was wrong; for some reason it was as if he coulden't get mad. Despite his best effort to fight it, he actually found himself getting even more calm!<br />
<br />
He sat there and watched as the yellow hair grew thicker, softer and longer; quickly looking more like fur.<br />
<br />
It wasen't long before his chest started to itch. He quickly took his blue shirt off and threw it onto the ground. Running over to his desk, he looked at himself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
His chest wasen't very hair, in fact he only had a few strands of black hair on it. Now however, his chest was covered in a light yellow fuzz!<br />
<br />
Raising his hands up, he gently touched the fur. It felt soft and warm and he could feel his hands touching it; it was definitely his! He felt what was almost like a pushing under his hands and quickly realized the fur was getting thicker.<br />
<br />
He also noticed that his nipples appeared to be vanishing into his chest and that he was getting chubbier! In fact, his whole torso was getting rounder! He could actually feel his ribcage expanding from within. Strangely, the feeling didn't hurt at all.<br />
<br />
Suddenly feeling a sharp pain about his rear, he quickly took his pants off. His tried to ignore the fact that his legs were now covered in yellow fur but coulden't help but reach down and pet them.<br />
<br />
He gasped when he realized how nice it felt, not only to touch the soft fur but also to be petted!<br />
<br />
His petting came to a quick halt when he felt something that almost felt like the base of his pine was being pulled on! Turning around, he turned his head and was able to see the same yellow fur on his now very round torso. There was one different however, his back had three horizontal brown stripes on it!<br />
<br />
&quot;Now where have I seen that before?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Still clearly smelled the scent of the candle, he wanted to resist but was so soothed by the scent that he coulden't bare to extinguish it.<br />
<br />
The feeling at the base of his spine now a warmth, he could only watch as his spine began to grow longer, and longer, quickly growing into a yellow furred tail int he shape of a lightning bolt nearly a meter long! reaching his right hand around, he grabbed the tail and yanked on it, receiving a sharp pain for his trouble. The tail was without doubt his.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is crazy, I should be panicking, yet I feel so calm and happy. It must be that pika candle chu ...&quot; <br />
<br />
Stopping, he realized the strange inhuman sound he had just made.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did I just say what I thought pika pika said?&quot; he asked, the slip answering his question.<br />
<br />
His legs were starting to ache and he felt himself losing his balance. He quickly jumped up onto his bed and lay down on his back. His a round torso, it felt very strange indeed to lay down. Looking down at his yellow furred body, he was too fascinated by the sight of his tail between his legs that he didn't notice the tingling that accompanied the formation of brown spots on his cheeks.<br />
<br />
He felt a warm itching as his long black human fair quickly fell out and evaporated, leaving behind slightly longer yellow fur; the only sign that anything but fur had even sat atop his head.<br />
<br />
His ears started aching and he brought his hands up to feel them. What he felt was a bizarre twisting and crunching of the cartilage in them. He felt them getting longer, pointy and starting to lose their form. It that wasen't enough, they began moving up his head, ear canals and all. He knew this process should have hurt and should be impossible. Instead of a feeling of pain and dread, he felt a sense of anticipation, as if his ears were moving to where they should be and reshaping into their true form.<br />
<br />
When his ears finished their journey and reconfiguration, they were long and ended with black tips. He coulden't help but close his eyes as they started tingling. With them closed, he felt them melting.<br />
<br />
As that process happened, his nose and mouth began to tingle. He was too distracted by the reformation of his eyes to feel them but the sensation of bones pushing out and reshaping themselves was more then enough to let him know that something major was happening.<br />
<br />
He lay there and simply experienced the feel of his jaw forming into a muzzle, taking his nose with it until it was a little pink nose just above his mouth. His teeth also started changing, his incisors growing far longer and razor like, the teeth of a rodent. His molars reshaped somewhat, becoming a form more suited for grounding up vegetable matter.<br />
<br />
As that finished, he opened his eyes. They were now much large and a deep black. He would have expected decreased visual acuity, but instead was greeted with far better sight; colors were more vibrant and while it was hard to tell within his room, distance objects that used to be blurry would now be crystal clear.<br />
<br />
His arms and legs, while fur covered still appeared mostly human; that was about to change. <br />
<br />
It started with his arms. He the bones in his arms losing length. Everything beyond his elbows seemed to be absorbing into his upper arm. He could only watch as his thumbs disappeared into his hands and as his remaining fingers lost a little length but gained cute little claws; perfect for climbing. When his hands had reached his elbows, the joints vanished and changed into wrists, leaving his with two short little arms.<br />
<br />
His legs quickly underwent a similar change. His felt his hips getting large and a little wider. His legs began to decrease in length but at the same time, increased in width. As they did so, he felt the bones in his feet reshaping, growing rounder. His big toes were absorbed by his feet as the rest of his toes widened and grew soft yellow claws. When all was said and done, his legs were only about half of their normal length, but 50% wider.<br />
<br />
Felling the changes about complete, Steve stood up on his bed. Looking back at him in the mirror was a huge pikachu. He could still smell the candle burning and quickly realized his sense of smell was far stronger. The scent of the candle was nothing short of incredible. It was a sweet candy floss like scent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, this pika is chu crazy I'm a king sized pika pi pikachu!&quot; he said, noticing how odd his voice sounded; it sounded high pitched and a bit squeaky.<br />
<br />
He wanted to be angry with his Joey as he knew the candle Joey bought for him did this. But something inside of him just woudlen't let him feel any negative emotions.<br />
<br />
&quot;great so what am I ...&quot; stopping he felt a tingling in his throat and felt a little dizzy for several seconds. Suddenly feeling a sinking feeling, he thought the room was getting larger! It didn't take him long to realize that he was in reality, shrinking! He continued shrinking until he was only about 50 cm tall. The dizzyness faded and the tingling went away.<br />
<br />
He tried to speak but instead of English, he was only able to speak pikachu, even odder, this didn't seem odd to him; if anything it felt natural.<br />
<br />
Now a little pikachu, Steve stood there looking at his reflection just as his door opened. Standing there was...</p>
