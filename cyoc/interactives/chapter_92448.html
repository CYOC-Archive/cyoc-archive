<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Satisfied with their creation, Ty and Dustin left the museum and went off to school. &quot;i&#39;m really excited to see what else we can add to it!&quot; Dustin said. &quot;Oh, I&#39;ve got some ideas...&quot; Ty replied devilishly.<br />
<br />
Dustin quickly realized what Ty meant when they got to gym class. Their gym teacher, Mr. Harrison, was always strict with them, to the point of being cruel. He would force them to run laps till they were exhausted, or to play tackle football games with players from the actual football team. Whenever they failed in any way, Mr. Harrison would call them wimps or pussies. <br />
<br />
Oh, and Mr. Harrison was incredibly buff--an amateur bodybuilder, in fact. Whenever the kids ran laps, he&#39;d run alongside them, wearing only sneakers and gym shorts to show off his impressive physique. As they ran laps today, though, Ty ran alongside Dustin with a smirk and said, &quot;Pretty soon he&#39;ll get to show off for a much bigger audience...&quot; Ty then winked at him.<br />
<br />
After a punishing set of laps, Dustin and Ty showered with the other kids, then hid in the locker room rather than move onto their next class. Mr. Harrison eventually emerged from his own private staff bathroom wearing only a towel. &quot;Perfect,&quot; whispered Ty. He made a wish and told Dustin to wait with him and observe what happened in Mr. Harrison&#39;s office...<br />
<br />
In the office, Mr. Harrison gave himself an appreciative look up and down in his full length mirror, then turned to grab his clothes where he had left them. He was shocked, however, to find a giant bull&#39;s head mask sitting where his clothes had been. He frowned, and muttered to himself, &quot;How the hell did that get here?&quot; He felt a strange curiosity welling up inside him, though, and hefted the mask in his hands. It was remarkably lifelike--if he hadn&#39;t inspected it to find a hole he would have believed it was the head of an actual bull. Looking around--and failing to see Ty and Dustin in their hiding place--he lifted the mask onto his head, then walked to the mirror. It was uncanny--it looked as if he indeed had the head of a bull.<br />
<br />
&quot;This could make a sweet costume!&quot; he said to himself, then froze in shock and fear. When he spoke, the bull&#39;s mouth had moved! &quot;What the--&quot; he watched the mirror in terror as the mouth moved again. He grabbed frantically at the snout of the mask, and realized he could feels his hands on it. He tried desperately to pull the bull&#39;s head off, but it was no use. Then, moments later, he watched in terror as the fur of the mask spread down onto his neck, stopping just at his collarbone.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...this can&#39;t be...&quot; he whispered through his new mouth. Dustin beamed at Ty, whispering, &quot;Amazing work!&quot; But Ty shushed him, pointing him back toward Mr. Harrison and making another wish. <br />
<br />
In the office, the gym teacher was so dumbstruck that it took him a few seconds to realize his towel had slipped off, exposing his thick legs and above average dick. When he did, he looked down, only to see his legs from the waist down sprouting thick, dark brown hair all over. Speechless, he watched his now fur-covered legs expand even larger--his thighs and ass becoming especially thick, almost bulbous. He then saw his feet shrink, at the same time feeling them harden into black hooves. &quot;What the--&quot; he finally said, but as he did he felt an explosively erotic feeling form in his crotch. &quot;Unnnh!&quot; the teacher moaned, as he looked down and watched his member swell to a gargantuan erect 24 inches, his shaft growing wide as a soda can, his balls dropping further and further as they  grew to the size of grapefruits. Finally, the changes stopped. Mr. Harrison now looked in the mirror to see his beautiful, hairless bodybuilder torso crowned by a bull&#39;s head with terrified eyes, and sitting atop what looked like the hind legs of a massive, very well-hung bull.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looking pretty manly!&quot; Ty chuckled, emerging from the shadows with Dustin. &quot;You--&quot; Mr. Harrison cried, before trying futilely to cover up his gigantic, throbbing bull cock. &quot;Did you--&quot; &quot;Sure did,&quot; Ty replied. &quot;Not so wimpy now, huh?&quot; The gym teacher was furious: &quot;Change me back or I&#39;ll--&quot; &quot;You&#39;ll what,&quot; said Dustin, &quot;moo at us?&quot; Ty fell over laughing. Humiliated, Mr. Harrison strode forward awkwardly on his new hooves to try to catch the boys, but suddenly felt disoriented, and blacked out for a second. When he came to, he was standing on some sort of large plinth. &quot;What the--where am I?!&quot; he cried.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Ty and Dustin appeared before him. &quot;Welcome to the Museum of Sexual Art!&quot; he said. &quot;You&#39;re our latest addition!&quot; &quot;Addition--sexual art? What are you--&quot; Mr. Harrison was suddenly distracted by a motion to his left. He turned, and saw a gorgeous, full-grown cow before him. Wait--gorgeous? &quot;No...oh God, no!&quot; the gym teacher cried as he realized what was happening, but it was too late. Drawn hypnotically by the pulsating sexual power of his animal dick, he thrust forward into the cow&#39;s sex. It mooed wildly as he began thrusting. Ty looked Mr. Harrison dead in the eye, then made his last wish. All at once both the gym teacher and the cow froze. Mr. Harrison felt suddenly cold, and realized that the cow before him had turned to bronze. Looking down onto its rear, he could see the bronze reflection of his own massive, muscled, half-animal body. He was a statue, frozen in orgasmic bliss and horror.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really are so creative, Ty!&quot; Dustin smiled. Ty nodded, then made another wish; a plaque reading &quot;The Minotaur&quot; appeared before the former gym teacher and his new lover, and visitors started filing in.</p>
