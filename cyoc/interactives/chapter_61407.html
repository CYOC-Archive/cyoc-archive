<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It wasn’t until then that the doctor realized that in her haste to collect the sample she’d actually grabbed <br />
Paul’s cock, and was still holding it.  She quickly let go, embarrassed.<br />
<br />
“Thank you for the, ah, sample.  I’ll send this down to the lab, and have the results for you within a week.  <br />
You can put your pants back on now.”<br />
<br />
Paul collected his wits, and his clothes.  His cock was still too hard to point down along his leg, so instead <br />
he pulled it up towards his belly, planning to hide it under his shirt (he’d learned some new clothing <br />
techniques recently).  But it seemed even too stiff for that: he could pull it up to about a forty-five degree <br />
angle, but it wouldn’t go any farther than that.  This was a bit odd; normally Paul could pull his cock as far <br />
up as he wanted, even when it was totally erect.  He shrugged it off, figuring in a minute or two when he was <br />
flaccid the issue would be moot.<br />
<br />
“Actually I think I can’t get my pants back on just now.  Better give it a few minutes.”  The doctor pursed <br />
her lips in momentary concern, but then very professionally chatted with Paul about how to get his test <br />
results, what they might mean, whether he had any other concerns, etc.<br />
<br />
Paul periodically checked on himself during the conversation, but the situation didn’t seem to be improving <br />
any.  Was he that into the doctor?  He didn’t think so.  Finally the doctor began wrapping things up <br />
conversationally, and Paul gave it another go.<br />
<br />
It was even worse.  He could barely move his cock at all, except by swinging his hips.  But with a nine-inch <br />
kielbasa sticking straight out in front of him, there was no way he was going around in public.<br />
<br />
The doctor noticed his predicament.  “It still won’t go down, hmm?  This could actually be serious.  Let me <br />
get someone to cover my next appointment, and then I’ll be back to try to help you.  While I’m gone -- <br />
masturbate.”<br />
<br />
Before Paul could question her, she slipped out of the room.  A moment’s reflection made Paul realize that <br />
whether she knew it or not, this must be the doctor’s doing.  It must be her fantasy.  So maybe now that she <br />
was gone, he could go soft again.<br />
<br />
He spent a minute thinking about work.  But when he checked himself, he was still hard as a rock.  Damn.  It <br />
looked like just how he retained his size even when Liz wasn’t around, he’d be maintaining this erection even <br />
without the doctor nearby.  <br />
<br />
He decided he’d better start masturbating again, since that was the doctor’s orders.  He walked over to the <br />
sink and started twisting his hands up and down his big shaft.<br />
<br />
He looked over at the sound of the door opening and saw the doctor’s pretty face returning.  He came <br />
immediately, out of nowhere.  As he added more of his cum to the deposit still sliding its way down the sink <br />
basin, he realized that that ejaculation must have been part of the doctor’s fantasy.  <br />
<br />
For her part, she said nothing, and was playing things pretty calmly.  She watched Paul’s orgasm subside <br />
clinically, waiting several awkward seconds in silence afterwards, and then grabbed Paul’s cock and pulled it <br />
laterally.  Paul’s hips turned, but his cock stayed perfectly still relative to his hips, as if it were joined <br />
by bone.<br />
<br />
“This does seem serious.”  The doctor declared.  “You seem to be suffering from Priapism.”<br />
<br />
Paul had to stifle a laugh at the fact that a power granted him by Priapus was now inflicting his namesake <br />
disease.<br />
<br />
“This is no laughing matter.  If you remain in this state, it could cause blood clotting in your penis, <br />
essentially giving it a stroke.  That, in turn, could cause impotence or gangrene, possibly even necessitating <br />
amputation.”<br />
<br />
If Paul had been thinking, he would’ve realized that he didn’t really have to worry about any of that.  But <br />
when your doctor tells you she may have to amputate your penis, you are unlikely to be thinking straight.  “So <br />
what’s the treatment?”<br />
<br />
“Normal treatment is a minor surgical procedure in which additional holes are made in your penis to promote <br />
blood draining.”  Paul was amazed to be still erect during this conversation.  “But I have neither the tools <br />
nor the expertise to perform that here.  We could rush you to the hospital across town, but at the rate your <br />
case is progressing...” they looked down at Paul’s dick, whose head was shiny, purple, and throbbing.  “I fear <br />
we wouldn’t get there in time.”<br />
<br />
“So, limited to the treatment options available to me here in my office, we must fall back to a more natural <br />
approach, and make you come as quickly and as often as we can.”<br />
<br />
&lt;Oh&gt;, thought Paul, &lt;nice fantasy&gt;.  “So, should I just keep whacking off?”<br />
<br />
“No, that will be too slow.  You’ll need my help.”  Paul was not surprised.<br />
<br />
She walked up behind Paul, pressed herself against him, and reached around to grab his cock.  Paul moaned, in <br />
equal parts from the feeling of her breasts pressed against his back, her small hands on his cock, and the <br />
sight of his cock expanding to more easily accommodate their four hands.  He began leaking precum, which she <br />
grabbed and smeared all over his cock.<br />
<br />
After a bit of initial conflict, they picked up a steady rhythm, four hands working his huge slippery cock, <br />
occasionally straying down to his engorged balls.  She broke the rhythm to begin caressing his head and <br />
corona.  She had to press herself harder against his back to reach that far, and he felt some enticing curves <br />
under that coat.  She tweaked his frenulum, and he exploded.<br />
<br />
They both gripped him tight as he came.  There wasn’t any sign of softening though.  Even while he was still <br />
dribbling, she dropped to her knees, spun him around, and took his cum in her mouth.<br />
<br />
As she began licking around his head, Paul noticed it gradually shrinking to a more manageable size.  A more <br />
manageable thickness, at least: it showed no signs of shortening.  When his head reached plum-size, she popped <br />
it into her mouth, purring at the taste.<br />
<br />
Paul jacked the exposed inches of his shaft along with the bobbing of her head.  She caressed his balls.  She <br />
took more and more of him into her mouth on each forward assay, and soon he had to shorten his own strokes to <br />
avoid hitting her.  He began hitting the back of her throat, stimulating his head.<br />
<br />
With fourish inches still in her mouth she began to stand up, bending at the waist to keep her head <br />
positioned.  Without warning, she lunged forward, taking the monstrous cock down her throat to the hilt.  He <br />
was still steel-hard, which meant she had to line up her throat just right.  <br />
<br />
It didn’t long of her deepthroating for Paul to come again.  The first shots went straight down her throat, <br />
but soon she pulled back to take them in her mouth where she could taste them.  Still Paul’s boner raged on, <br />
throbbing, shiny, purple, and beginning to hurt.<br />
<br />
“Still not fast enough” she muttered to herself after swallowing.  “There’s only one thing to do, then.  Lie <br />
here.”  She patted the exam table.  As Paul walked to the table, she removed her lab coat, revealing lovely <br />
wide hips, followed quickly by the rest of her clothes.  Paul noted appreciatively that she kept her bush <br />
neatly trimmed.<br />
<br />
She wasted no time in climbing on top of his vertical cock.  It was still much too long for her, though the <br />
width was quite manageable.  She slid down, her velvety walls feeling cool against Paul’s overheated cock.  <br />
When she bottomed out, it began changing size, getting shorter but wider.  By the time it was short enough <br />
that it all fit inside her, it was nearly as wide around as a Nalgene.  <br />
<br />
She took just a moment acclimatizing before she began pushing herself up and dropping back down.  Her tits <br />
jiggled deliciously.  She began moaning quietly.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes of this, Paul was near his peak again.  She noticed, and sped up a bit.  He felt himself <br />
swell with orgasm, straining her pussy even further, and then he was shooting.  She kept right on bouncing, <br />
timing the strokes with Paul’s spurts.<br />
<br />
It was a great orgasm.  It seemed to go on forever.  Her pussy was already overfull, so his come quickly <br />
squelched out onto their crotches, even as he kept depositing more.  She began tiring, and put a hand down <br />
behind her for added support.  Paul was still going strong.<br />
<br />
Pauls’ orgasm was beginning to be spiked with a bit of pain, as the dull ache of his overhard cock <br />
intensified.  He realized that he’d been coming for at least a minute, maybe two, and it didn’t seem be <br />
tailing off.  That was nice, but the pain was still intensifying, and he was getting a bit worried.<br />
<br />
He struggled to focus and ignore the tight pussy on his cock, the gallons of come drenching his middle, the <br />
beautiful bouncing boobs in front of him, the moaning beauty attached to them, and the sharp pain in his cock.  <br />
Her plan did not seem to be curing his Priapism.  A terrible thought occurred to him, and he fervently prayed <br />
that her fantasy was not to have a cock explode inside of her.<br />
<br />
Wondering about her fantasy gave Paul an idea.  She assumed that the cure for his condition was to make him <br />
come, but if his condition was really just caused by her fantasy, maybe she was the one who needed to get off.  <br />
Figuratively.  She hadn’t yet.  <br />
<br />
Through the haze of pain and pleasure of his continuing orgasm, Paul reached a hand down to finger the <br />
doctor’s clit.  Her moans increased in volume immediately.  The whole area was already plenty lubed with <br />
Paul’s come, so he began strumming her furiously.<br />
<br />
Finally, with a shriek, she came.  Paul felt himself spurt out one even larger blast, and then his cock almost <br />
instantly went limp, pain and pleasure both abating so quickly he thought for a moment he’d gone numb.<br />
<br />
She leaned down onto his chest, a luxury she could now manage that the cock inside her bent.  They rested <br />
there for a few minutes, then casually cleaned up and dressed as if they were old lovers.  She reminded him to <br />
watch his cholesterol intake as he was leaving.<br />
<br />
The episode scared Paul a bit.  When he’d lost control of his cock with Ray it had only been embarrassing, but <br />
this episode had been painful and a bit scary.  On the other hand, he discovered that night with Liz that he <br />
was now totally multi-orgasmic.</p>
