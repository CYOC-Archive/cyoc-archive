<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before Jocelyn could charge at Gwen, another itch caused her to pause. This was all over her arms, legs, and chest. She looked down at her arms first, and yelped-brayed when saw grey fur rise from her pores, starting from where her hooves ended. It climbed up her arms slowly, and she looked down at her feet to see more hairs grow up her legs as well. These were much lighter in color than the fur on her ears and tail, but it was terrible all the same. Already Jocelyn began to sweat nervously. It was like her skin was being slowly invaded. She could feel her chest grow hot and itchy as fur was surely growing there too. But as her body grew more sweaty, a new change was triggered. Jocelyn’s nose caught whiff of a horrid smell, and she gagged. It was a dank musk, something that belonged in a barnyard. Finding her shirt stifling, she did her best open it up with her hooves. Clumsily, she managed to pop the button off and force it open, but as she did, the smell increased, causing Jocelyn to look down at her furry chest damp with sweat.<br />
<br />
“N-no way! Is thaaaaaaaawt coming from me?!” <br />
<br />
She realized now that her body odor stank like a real donkey, made worse by the sweat all over her body. Once again Jocelyn’s anger shrank, being replaced again by terror as the fur continued its ceaseless growth. In addition to the rest of her body, a new itch formed on her back. However, she wouldn’t have a chance to further react to that or her smell as her feet started to cramp painfully. She looked down to see her shoes were positively bulging, almost like they were ready to burst apart. And pretty soon, they did just that, revealing her feet had morphed into identical hooves. <br />
<br />
She began to stumble, her new feet not meant for a bipedal stance. Jocelyn did her best to balance, but it would all be useless as she was sent falling forwards, landing on her front hooves. Although her hands and feet were already suited for a donkey, her limbs were still human for her position to be highly awkward. Her arms being shorter meant that her bottom was sent sticking up into the air, tail waving uncontrollably like a proud flag. But Jocelyn was anything but proud right now. <br />
<br />
Gwen walked closer to her, looking down on her as if she was some pitiful animal. Jocelyn hated being forced to this level, but she couldn’t do anything to resist. Only shame and horror filled her right now, that stubbornness having completely vanished. <br />
<br />
“Well, well,” Gwen said. Seems like you’re pretty much an ass already. Although, we could use more work still.”<br />
<br />
After she spoke, her legs started to reshape themselves, adjusting to bend into proper hind legs. At the same time, her arms lengthened, and soon her stance on all fours was much more comfortable. But this didn’t make things any better, even as Jocelyn’s whole body barreled out, tearing her clothing as her human shape was being converted into that of a donkey. Only her head remained mostly intact. Feeling desperation set in, and she looked up to Gwen with pleading eyes.<br />
<br />
“Pleaseeehaaaww… nawwwwt aww dawwwnkeeeehaaaaww!” she begged through darkening lips, tears streaming down her face. Fur had not reached her face yet, but all her other facial features were unmistakably that of a donkey. Her nostrils flared out and enlarged, their enhanced sense of smell making her own odor much stronger. Her teeth grew big and blocky, unable to close her human mouth properly. Thanks to her shirt being split down the middle, a thick strip of dark fur ran down her back and up her head. It look like she had a small black mohawk sitting on top of her short blonde hair, but in reality this was her mane. <br />
<br />
All of this made Jocelyn look completely ridiculous and silly. Her changing vocals made it difficult to say human words, but she did her best to plead with Gwen, anything to return to normal.<br />
<br />
“Caaaawnge meee bawwwwk!” She pleaded some more as her eyes faded into a solid black. Jocelyn hoped desperately that Gwen would show her mercy, but instead, she just shook her head without a word.<br />
<br />
“NAAAAAAAAW!” Jocelyn brayed hysterically and kicked back her hind legs furiously. Her mouth pushed out into a large muzzle, her blonde human hair falling out until her black mane was left on her head. Grey fur consumed her face as her muzzle finished expanding, her movements shaking off her tattered clothes even as Jocelyn fought to keep her humanity. “SAAAAAWAAAAAN HAAAAAAAAW MEEEEEEEHU HE-HE-HEEEEHAW HEEHAW!”<br />
<br />
Jocelyn, the human girl, was no more. All that remained was a bucking, odorous donkey. Braying like mad as Gwen who cursed her simply watched the beast’s endless tantrum.<br />
<br />
“What’s done is done,” she stated. “A person like you was always meant to be an ass.”</p>
