<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hidden under Vin’s speedo, the jockstrap stretched, groaned, and grew. The cotton and spandex became white lumps of Ryan Standish’s returning form, as it tore through the swim briefs on Vin’s collapsed, naked body. His dripping, bare back was slumped awkwardly against the locker room bench. The straps that hugged Vin’s water-treading glutes hardened into bulging arms gripping tight around his waist. The fabric in front spread out into powerful legs that pressed heavily on top of Vin’s. The cup rippled into a massive back and shoulders which never ended, and Vin was now pinned down by 230 lbs of solid, beefy jockbeast.<br />
<br />
With Ryan’s grip on his mind gone, Vin came to his senses. He had no recollection of the past three weeks, as Ryan had stolen those memories, along with Vin’s intelligence and magic. All this was now stored inside the water polo cap that Ryan took for himself and now wore on his own, restored head. The sight of the two of them--wet and naked on the locker room floor--surprised Vin, who couldn’t comprehend the reason for any of this. Yet it seemed so right, as that square-jawed head, supported by Ryan’s thick, massive neck, pressed onto Vin’s six pack, restricting his breathing. Vin’s bare cock stirred amongst the shreds of his ruined speedo. It hit Ryan’s massive, heaving pecs.<br />
<br />
“R-ryan?”, Vin said. “Are we still in gym class?”<br />
<br />
Ryan lifted his head and swept his wet Bama bangs out of his eyes. He looked at Vinnie.<br />
<br />
“No”, came the reply. “It’s your water polo practice. You’re the captain, remember? I’m here for football practice”.<br />
<br />
Water polo? But that’s a sport, and Vincent was never good at sports… All his life, Vincent was a short skinny nerd, with his nose always in a book, jealous of jocks like Ryan who’d get all the chicks. He knew all this. Yet why, upon reflecting upon these facts, did they all feel wrong? He pushed Ryan off of him and got up. Right away he felt the power of this athlete’s body that felt different from the skinny shell that was always his. This was not his body! He looked at a mirror. He recognized his face, though it was more defined than he remembered. He was also an inch taller and built like someone who spent evenings at the gym, and not holed up at his desk. But he still had his smarts, right? He tried to think of the work he was doing in his current classes, but it was all just a frustrating blur. Math… 2+2 is 4, right? Vincent panicked. What is going on?<br />
<br />
Coach and the rest of the team found Vin curled up in the fetal position, babbling about how he wanted to wake up and it was all a mistake. Ryan avoided notice as he ran to his PE locker. All his street clothes and book bag were still there. He got quickly dressed and slipped out while the commotion grew even more. Accessing a spell from within the water polo cap, he transformed it into a puka shell necklace that slid down to fit around his neck. He got to his car, still parked in the school parking lot, and drove home. <br />
The doctors said Vin must have suffered a concussion and even some brain damage from hypoxia while drowning. One tested his IQ, which was once clocked in as 124. Vin barely got 88. His prospects as a honors student, let alone a valedictorian, were over. However, he was still an excellent athlete, and with the permanent changes Ryan made to his hormonal production, Vin continued to grow in height and in bulk. His body was now the only asset that he had, and he worked it in the gym to the limit that fall, carrying the water polo team to the state championship in the meantime.<br />
<br />
Rebuilding his life was a challenge, but Ryan Standish thankfully had a lot of smarts and magic on his side. First he started with remote access to the records office. He excused his three week absence from school with a verified medical excuse. He excused his absence from football practice and games with a major leg injury, memory of which he implanted into his coach’s and teammates memories. The physical trainer now remembered recommending an outside professional to Standish’s case, who sent daily updates to the coach and verified that the star quarterback was fit to return the very next day. His parents were always absent so he didn’t have to change anything with them; they never even realized he was gone.<br />
<br />
That night, Ryan surprised his girlfriend with a visit. He finally had his sex machine body back, and she was always up for a ride. But while she explored his cut, hulking physique, Ryan found it hard to maintain any interest at all. All he could think about was Vin’s cock, balls, and ass, and how he missed caressing it all as a jockstrap and exulting in his and Vin’s manliness together. This scared Ryan, and he avoided Vin all fall, even switching his PE period. But he still dumped his girlfriend over Thanksgiving break. Little did he know that Vin's magic was still not done with his life yet...</p>
