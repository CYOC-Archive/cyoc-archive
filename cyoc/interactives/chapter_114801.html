<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Melissa Jenkins, meanwhile, sat quietly with Megumi Tachibana in a private part of her grandmother&#39;s small estate at Moon Lake. She&#39;d come for a bit of extra information and perhaps wisdom from Akane no Tachibana, who Megumi promised could help her with her choice on what were to be. She had agreed to be the family were in the Jenkins family, but so far she&#39;d also found herself falling for Trevor Tyson. The young werecattle bull was strong and kind, patient and gentle. He listened to her and promised to keep her safe. It was something special, and Melissa had admitted that she wanted to spend the rest of her life with Trevor, which would mean that even if her father had made the decision to be the family were that she&#39;d need to become a were anyway. That had left Melissa with her own problems related to what kind of were to be.<br />
<br />
Her choices had been between being a werefox, to match certain elements of her personality or to be a werecow, to match Trevor and perhaps be able share his strength. They were obviously different, but that didn&#39;t mean either were bad choices. Werefoxes were sleek and well toned, though the most open regarding their sexual exploits, which was a thing that Melissa was a bit wary of, but to some extent also decided to ignore when all other weres had libidos higher than a normal human would anyway. Werecattle were more robust with a lot more obvious musculature, with even Trevor&#39;s mother looking like she&#39;d spent a lot of time lifting weights to build muscle mass. Werecows may not have lost their femininity, but they were still built to be strong. At the same time, there was this great sense of gentleness that Melissa had gotten from Trevor and from his mother, like all their strength and size was more for show than a threat to anything. It was like werecattle had taken a page out of The Story of Ferdinand by Munro Leaf in that if pushed, they could be powerful, but were more content to be calm and gentle otherwise. Melissa did privately admit that she liked that aspect. <br />
<br />
However, these things had left her with questions on which way to go, to follow her head or her heart. It had gone back and forth with no clear answer as both had good sides. And on some level, Melissa had felt that the good side to being a werecow would negate the parts that she considered more negative and wouldn&#39;t necessarily be a major risk. However, from what she&#39;d learned on a werefox&#39;s bonds to their mates, there was some things that were difficult. It&#39;s unbreakable nature reminded her too much of her father&#39;s morning for her mother and that wasn&#39;t something she really wanted to live with. That was why she had come to talk with Megumi and her grandmother. Both had made fair advice, but had still left things with the possibility of a werefox&#39;s bond causing that sort of mourning, though most werefoxes, like Akane, who had lost a mate did seem to move on with their lives.  However, as Akane left to respond to some sort of fight, she gave Melissa the advice to do what would give her the most happiness, which to Melissa pointed directly to Trevor. He made her happy, and as strangely fast as it was, she couldn&#39;t picture herself with anyone but Trevor. In that, she made her decision to be a werecow to be happy with him, and it wasn&#39;t as if that would be the only benefit.<br />
<br />
Her choice, however, didn&#39;t necessarily put her at ease, as she got an odd premonition that her father had been involved in something and she didn&#39;t know what. That left her nervous and eager to get home and check on her father. Regardless of his mourning, she still loved him. And that nervousness didn&#39;t go away when she&#39;d talked to her dad on the phone and heard that she&#39;d need to meet him at the hospital. It left her in a state of near panic that Megumi easily picked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure your dad his fine,&quot; Megumi said hopefully, &quot;Moon Lake generally doesn&#39;t that much trouble...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But he said to meet him at the hospital!&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;and what I saw...&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa trembled slightly, remembering the strange daydream she had regarding actually having lesbian sex with Megumi and becoming a werefox. It was a bit frightening in that she had promised her father to wait a day before going through with her decision to let her father get used to her becoming a were, not to mention the idea that her father had been in a fight. And now she was supposed to meet her dad at the hospital.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... for one that was probably only something of some fantasy,&quot; Megumi answered, &quot;you&#39;ve been talking to the gang about what were you want to be and what you&#39;ve narrowed your choices to. And I&#39;ve already offered that if you do or did decide to become a vixen, I&#39;d be more than willing to help you so that you can let Trevor &quot;take&quot; your virginity without an issue. Your thoughts probably just drifted to that because it&#39;s what&#39;s been on your mind. Nothing big. If Trevor were here, it might have been you and him having a good time together instead of you and me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... but this fight... and my dad being at the hospital?&quot; Melissa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... if the two women you said were in the dream have been after your dad, they may also be something that&#39;s on your mind, consciously or unconsciously,&quot; Megumi answered, &quot;and the report of a Statute 1A violation and the potential violence in it... that was probably just the fear that came forward.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about meeting my dad?&quot; Melissa asked, &quot;he said to meet at the hospital... If what I dreamed was nothing, why would I need to meet him there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That could be coincidence,&quot; Megumi gave a brief shrug, &quot;that sort of thing does happen from time to time... and not just in Moon Lake. And even if it does mean something... if your dad said to meet there, I&#39;m sure whatever happened was minor and he&#39;s fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if it&#39;s not?&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;what if...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If the coincidence happened and your dad was clawed... he&#39;s likely a were himself by now,&quot; Megumi answered, &quot;but he&#39;d also be perfectly fine. If bitten or scratched, the wounds have healed and it&#39;d look as though there was never any wound. And that he&#39;s okay... if different.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa looked back to Megumi and looked fairly serious, &quot;but what will that mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It may mean that you wouldn&#39;t HAVE to be the family were,&quot; Megumi answered, &quot;If you wish to be a were, there is no thing that would deny you the right to choose. You can still be a were if you want to. The only change would be that you wouldn&#39;t be rushed to make the decision based on abiding by the town&#39;s laws.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I think I am ultimately set with regard to what were to be,&quot; Melissa answered.<br />
<br />
Megumi nodded when her grandmother returned to the room they were in. The older woman glanced to granddaughter and then turned back to Melissa and gave a polite bow.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will forgive me for the time it took, young Ms. Jenkins,&quot; Akane Tachibana spoke, &quot;and I apologize for the message that I bring...&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa looked down and then frowned, &quot;My dad was in this supposed Statute 1A violation...&quot; The tone of her voice was calm statement, not a question.<br />
<br />
&quot;From the way things happened... there likely is no Statute 1A violation,&quot; Akane spoke in reply, &quot;though he has become a were, yes. Though he is still your father where it matters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;as I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware, I was willing to be the family were...&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane nodded politely, &quot;If you wish, I can escort you to the hospital and you may converse with your father.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Melissa nodded as Megumi came up beside her and they prepared to head out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll come with you,&quot; Megumi said to Melissa, &quot;to be a good friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Meg,&quot; Melissa answered as they moved to follow Akane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Megumi,&quot; Megumi corrected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Couldn&#39;t Meg be short for Megumi?&quot; Melissa asked half teasing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose,&quot; Megumi answered, &quot;So long as it doesn&#39;t turn into something that includes the whole school!&quot;</p>
