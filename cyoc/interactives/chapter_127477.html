<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Claidia sighed sadly as she gazed at Katie. &quot;As much as I want to help Mika I don&#39;t want her to leave,&quot;she said glumly. &quot;Does that make me an awful person?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie shook her head. &quot;No I don&#39;t think so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I had a chance for Katie to live with me I&#39;d take it,&quot; Kellie smirked.<br />
<br />
Claudia grinned as she looked out the window. Katie gave the girl a look of pity as she tried to think of something. &quot;You know we could always just go to where she&#39;s meeting him and watch,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Claudia looked up before smiling. &quot;Sounds like a decent enoigh plan,&quot; she said. &quot;Kellie I&#39;ll give you directions, you drive.&quot; Kellie smiled broadly as she gripped the wheel. &quot;Just tell me the way, I&#39;m starting to get the hang of ihis.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia said that Mika was meeting her brother at a local coffee shop. Kellie was able to drive without any issues. Surprisingly she seemed to be a natural despite having no real driving experience. As the girls pulled into the parking lot Kellie smoothly parked as the girls exites the car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow Kel your a natural,&quot; Katie exclaimed. Kellie could only blush and shrug her shoulders. <br />
<br />
As the girls made their way towards the coffee shop they begam to womder what exactly they would do. At first thoughts of sticking up for Mika crossed their minds. Now, though those thoughts began to seem stupid, this was a family matter and Mika was more than capable of defending herself from close minded individuals. Lookimg aroumd the shop they quickly spotted Mika and her brother.<br />
<br />
Mika&#39;s brother Shiro looked more mature than the typical 20 year old. The man was dressed in a polo shirt with a pair of khakis. His face, while young, had a grim look on it as he continued to talk to his younger sister. Mika, to her cresit seemed to be taking things in stride. Despite being in an uncomfortable position sje appeared confident, returning her brothers icy glare. Quickly the girls moved to an area where they could listen without being seen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mika enough of this foolishness,&quot; Shiro spat. &quot;You&#39;ve brought enough shame to the family. Its time for you to return home.&quot; Claudia griited her teeth and would of lept up to say something if Katie and Kellie hadn&#39;t grabbed her.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Mom and dad dont want anthing to do qith me,&quot; Mika said flatly. &quot;They&#39;ve already said they want nothing to with me. The Hardys are happy I&#39;m there and actually treat me with respect.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Respect is earned,&quot; Shiro shot back. &quot;And a little girl making foolhardy decisions will get you none. Especially if its a decision that has you involved with a gaijin girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika rolled her eyes. &quot;Ugh seriously Shiro,&quot; Mika sighed. &quot;Is that what this is about your more upset that Claudia is white rather than your sister being bi.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shiros eyes narrowed as he glared at his sister. &quot;I don&#39;t agree with any of it,&quot; he grumbled. &quot;Its a deviant lifestyle and you know our family abhores it. That its with a white girl just shames the family more. Just look at that family the parents, her siblings and especially her. They&#39;re devils.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia had heard enough. Breaking free from Katie and Kellie she spun and faced Shiro. &quot;You you calling a devil,&quot; she growled.<br />
<br />
Shiro looked at Claudia before frowning at her. &quot;See Mika,&quot; he grumbled. &quot;Your girlfriend here cant even let you talk with your family by yourself. She sees you as nothing but a possession.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite being happy to see Claudia Mika frowned. &quot;Claud I told you to stay home,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Im sorry I didnt listen but Im not going to just sit here while your asshole brother talks shit about my family and treats you like garbage.&quot; Claudia frowned as she stared daggers at Shiro.<br />
<br />
&quot;Claudia maybe we should go,&quot; Kellie said meekly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should take the deviant whores advise,&quot; Shiro smirked. &quot;She may be a deviant white whore but at least she has some sense. Its unfortunate though that she disappoints her family with her choices.  For white devils her parents actually seemed reasonable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tears began to well in Kellies eyes as she looked at Shiro. &quot;You bastatd how dare you,&quot; she choked.<br />
<br />
&quot;How dare I,&quot; Shiro yelled. &quot;Your a deviant and your parents are too weak to do whats right. They should of stoned you to death when they found out what you are. White parents, always coddling instead of disciplining. Its weakness on their part.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie now began to cry as she turned away. Her parents may have coddled her but they werent weak and she wasnt a whore. They were wonderfu, loving people that treated everyone well. She was saddened that anyone could be this hateful of someone just because of who they loved.<br />
<br />
Katie was angry now and heard enough. &quot;You old racist asshole,&quot; she spat as the eing began to glow.<br />
<br />
Shiros progression was almoat instantaneous as they quickly left his 20s, reentering hos 30s and 40s. His black hair grew more and more grey as he got older. <br />
&quot;Whats happening to me,&quot; Shiro exclaimed.  Katie, Mika, Kellie anf Claudia gaped as Shiro stared at his weathered hands.<br />
<br />
Shiro was in a near panic as her grew older still. Shiros youth and vitality drained from him as he became a man of 60 then 70. The black hair was replaced by grey as he body seemed to waste away. The bit of muscle on his body grew soft and flabby giving hin a frail, thin elderly body. <br />
<br />
As Shiro comlletes his progression becoming 85 he stared in horror at his hands.  Covered with liver spots and touched witb arthritis givong ot an almost skeletal appearnce. While he had lost no hair it now it was a white as snow now. Shiros fave had gone from young to old so quickky it surprised even the girls. Covered in deep wrinkles and flabby jowls Shiro angrily glared at Katie. &quot;What did you do witch!&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie had been shocked when she accidentally activated the ring. It scared her even more that Shiro seemed to be aware of what was happening. Quickly recovering Katie put on a stern face, trying to bluff Mikas brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats only a taste of what I can do,&quot; she growled. I womt have you belittling Mika, Kellie, Claudia or myself anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shiro sneered, his elderly face looking almost skeletal. &quot;You will pay for this white bitch,&quot; hr growled. &quot;No you won&#39;t,&quot; Katie threatened. &quot;Im the only one that can change you back.  Do as I say and I will give you your life back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shiro nodded curtly as Katie continued. &quot;I wont have your hatefulness in Mikas presense anymore,&quot; she stated. &quot;If she chooses to see any of you again it will be her decision. You habe no control of her anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is no way I can allow her to disgrace my family with her deviant ways,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Katie glared at him with an icy expression. &quot;If you want your life back you will,&quot; she growled. &quot;Leave Mika alone until you can learn to love her for who she is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shiro gritted his teeth before nodding. &quot;Fine,&quot; he growled. Katie smirked as she motioned for the others. &quot;Very good,&quot; she murmurred. &quot;Cmon guys were leaving.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie and the others turned to leave. As they did Katie wished for Shiro to return to 20. As qyickly as before Shiro grew younger, the color returning to his hair as his wrinkles smoothed. Soon he was his original age again, glaring at Katie with contempt.<br />
<br />
Katie and the others silently got into Claudias car now. &quot;No one hurts my friends,&quot; Katie growled. The others sat in stunmed silence, frightened at the show of power Katie had just displayed.</p>
