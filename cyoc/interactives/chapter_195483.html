<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I just don’t know.” Draco tells Susan, stepping back and pacing the room. <br />
<br />
Susan could tell Draco was upset, his tail barely moved as he walked, and he wouldn’t make eye contact with her. “I know I am not a hybrid like you.” Susan starts. “But I have felt something with you ever since we first met a few years ago. Do you remember what happened?” <br />
<br />
Draco stopped and looked at her. His memories were of his human self, not the hybrid wolf he is now. He was hesitant to say because he wasn’t sure what all had changed. After a few moments to clear his thoughts, he replied. “I was outside with my sister. Your dad pulled up the moving truck to the house and you jumped out before the truck even stopped. Your dad was yelling at you, but you were so focus on meeting me and Laura.” <br />
<br />
“I scraped both my knees when I jumped.” Susan adds. “You took me inside to put bandages on me before you would play.” <br />
“You were hurt. I was just being nice.” Draco replied. <br />
<br />
“You were being loving.” Susan tells Draco. “Even back then, you always cared. That maybe why you always wore clothes when you didn’t need to. For everyone else. Tell me, at the zoo, did you not tell your mom about what happened in the restroom because of embarrassment or because it would taken away from your sisters party?” <br />
<br />
Draco never thought of that. Yes, being a hybrid was new to him, in his mind at least, but if he was still human, it probably wouldn’t have changed much. “I don’t know. I really can’t say.” <br />
<br />
“I can guess.” Susan replies. “You let everyone else come first. Let me help you come first every once in a while. Look, tonight, when you shower. I’ll show you something my sister told me about. Just trust me.” Susan walks over and hugs Draco before leaving the room. <br />
<br />
As Susan leaves the room to go back and play with Laura, Draco could feel his penis harden and slowly move out of his sheath. He looked down to fine that only the tip was sticking out right now. Do I have feeling for her like that? He asks himself in his mind. Do I want to mate with her?<br />
<br />
The rest of the day went by fast. Draco stayed in his room reading more of the book until dinner was ready. Walking down, Draco’s brother gave him a hard time after hearing from their father that he received a book on puberty. Draco just dismissed it and ate quietly as Susan sat next to him, defending him from his brothers jokes. After dinner, Susan followed Draco back to his room for the night. <br />
<br />
Draco turned on the shower as he usually does, but this time waits for Susan to join. When she doesn’t come in the bathroom, he walks out to his room to see why. <br />
<br />
“I wasn’t sure you wanted me to be in there with you.” Susan replies. “You are usually mad about it.” <br />
<br />
Draco looks down, a little embarrassed. “Maybe I just need my friend with me.” He tells her. Susan grins before she starts striping down to join him. <br />
<br />
Walking in the bathroom again, Susan shuts the door to the bathroom and locks it. “So, what do you want?” Susan asks. “It’s all up to you. I can just be in here or I can bath you…. or I can do what I talked about earlier.” <br />
<br />
Draco takes in a deep breath. He could smell that Susan was already getting heated. “What did you want to do?” <br />
<br />
Susan’s smiles grew wider as she walks over to Draco and pulls him into the shower. She quickly washes off his sheath before massaging it to make his tip come out. As it comes out just a bit, Susan looks Draco in the eyes. “Just trust me, okay.” Draco nods as Susan gets down on her knees. <br />
<br />
Susan then sticks her tongue out and licks the tip up and down. This sends shivers through Draco, making more of his penis grow out. Susan continued to teased Draco with her tongue until she believed enough of his canine member was out of the sheath. She then pulled what she could into her mouth, moving up and down the shaft. This intensified the sensations Draco was feeling. Draco could also smell Susan more intently. <br />
<br />
Between the ebb and flow of Susan’s mouth, Draco could see she was fingering her own private area. He could tell that this was also well the smell was coming from. <br />
<br />
It didn’t take long before Susan was able to coax out Draco’s knot from his sheath. Draco’s knees were shacking as he felt the pressure build within him. “I can’t hold back.” Draco whispers as he holds his muzzle close to keep himself from howling. The pressure in his balls and penis was building and building. Susan, hearing him, continues with new passion. She wrapped her mouth around as much of his member as she could as she went up and down. <br />
<br />
Finally, Draco couldn’t hold back any longer. He released his seed into Susan’s mouth. Susan tried to swallow as much as she could, but the pressure force much out of her mouth and all over the two of them and the shower’s floor. When the last wave came, and Draco’s penis was just dry pulsing, Susan does one last suck and lick before moving her mouth from Draco’s groin. <br />
<br />
Draco helps Susan up to her feet, even though he wasn’t that stable himself after receiving head for the first time. “What… Wow.” Draco says. <br />
<br />
“I know.” Susan replied. “I couldn’t believe how much I was able to swallow. I’m glad I didn’t eat too much beforehand.” <br />
<br />
“But will you change because of this?” Draco asks. <br />
<br />
“I don’t know.” Susan replied.</p>
