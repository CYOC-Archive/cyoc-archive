<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">No her hair was clearly gray, but not an old gray, this was a rich gray color that looked healthy. Clearly nothing wrong. <br />
<br />
Her eyes roamed upwards, there were her ears, foot and a half long elongated teardrops coated with the same color gray as her hair, with white inside. Clearly nothing wrong there. <br />
<br />
She turned around and looked over her shoulder and looked down her back. Normal...normal...she was normal right down to the black tassel capping her tail hanging under her dress. <br />
<br />
So what was she worried about? <br />
<br />
“I look good!” Dan said, posing in front of a mirror. He flexed and slapped his tail against his back. His ears looked a very rich and shiny brown. His cock was almost ripping through his pants, he wanted to show it off. “<br />
<br />
You were right to come here.” He flexed again. <br />
<br />
“I should have come here ages ago.” Emily giggled. “<br />
<br />
Neither noticed the haze in the room or the scent of cigar smoke that was clearly keeping both of them high. Or perhaps neither cared. Either way they were having fun! <br />
<br />
Dan stopped in front of the first mirror, a strange pressure behind his face. He looked in the mirror and saw...two donkeys!<br />
<br />
“Hey! What gives?” Dan asked. The donkey in the mirror brayed as he talked. <br />
<br />
“That’s haaaaawsome.” Emily brayed. She reached to the mirror, and the other donkey in it raised a hoof. “How are they doing that?” She touched the mirror. And it instantly flipped around, taking both Dan and Emily with it.<br />
<br />
The two landed head over tails in another hall, full of mirrors. Now though the floors, walls and ceilings were mirrored as well. The mirrors on the side and ceiling showed humans but those below showed two donkeys.<br />
<br />
Dan looked down at the mirrored floor and blushed. “Uh...Emily? Look down...” He pointed. Below him was reflected the underside of a donkey, a fat furry belly, with a sheath tight against it.<br />
<br />
Emily looked down and she looked even more flushed now. She gave Dan a longing look. <br />
<br />
“He’s really big, isn’t he?” Dan smiled back. He giggled, Emily looked funny. Small hairs began to sprout on her cheeks, then her chin, then her forehead, moving all over her face.<br />
<br />
“Yeah kinda like me!” Dan bragged as he admired the well endowed jackass below him. When he looked up Emily was giggling.<br />
<br />
“I like you with the beard.” She commented. <br />
<br />
“Beard?” Dan asked, and looked at the side mirror, he had a thick mat of brown hair running all along the bottom of his face, around his lips, and up to his sideburns. What was odd though, was that when he looked again, he noticed the hair and the skin around his lips was white.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Emily’s human hair began to fall out around her shoulders, being pushed out by fur. All of her hair but one long patch had fallen out. That one stripe down the middle began to change. Instead of soft human hair, it stood up straight, bristling like a hedgehog. It grew down Emily’s neck, resting between her shoulder blades. Her mane was too long on a human but it would be perfect on a donkey<br />
<br />
Dan for his part noticed something else. Emily smelled different. Better than before. He drank in her scent, his nostrils ballooning out to get as much as he could of it. As they did, they grew messy and wet on the inside. <br />
<br />
“You smell good Emily.” Dan said huskily, as he felt his cock extending in his pants. As Emily happened, his hair on his head except for a clump in the middle suddenly all fell off, as if it had been magnetic filings and the magnetism had stopped. Left behind was short, coarse brown fur. The clump of hair jiggled slightly, then turned pitch black. Then, as if being drawn by a string, the clump shot down his back between his shoulder blades, and then sprang up, bristly,tough fur.<br />
<br />
Emily blushed at him. She licked her lips, then licked them again. At the touch of her tongue her lips began to swell. Her teeth and jaw still remained human but her lips grew out, turning black as they did. They inflated to their full size, giving her the lips of a donkey, on a too small human head.<br />
<br />
Emily buried her nose in Dan’s neck, breathing in his scent. In the process her nostrils expanded until they looked like a little muzzle on a still human nose.<br />
<br />
Y-You smell good too Dan.” Emily said. “Haaaaaaw! Yo-you smell like strong male.” <br />
<br />
Dan blinked. Something about those words was...no normal. Dan looked at her massive lips, which hung down hilariously from her mouth. Somewhere in the back of his head, a part of him was confused and scared. <br />
<br />
“Ah! Damn it!” He took a deep breath. He felt something against his legs. He jerked his massive head back and nearly fell over. “What’s wrong with me! I have a tail!!!”</p>
