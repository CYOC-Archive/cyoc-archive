<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A week later, and the same workout being done...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Owen,&quot; Katie asked as she looked Owen over, enjoying the vantage and observation she was able to have on the changing man, &quot;You seem distracted lately. Is something wrong?&quot; She was just finishing up a set of bench press, eagerly wearing a similarly flirtatious top and short shorts basically designed to draw Owen&#39;s eyes to her body. And she could tell he always did enjoy the look. She had refrained so far from escalating it to sex - she&#39;d decided she wanted Owen to be over 30 when they had sex.<br />
<br />
But as of today it seemed Owen was cottoning on - almost - that something seemed...different. A whole week later and seven more years had drastically escalated Owen&#39;s dedication to his sport. The young amateur bodybuilder had bloomed into a square jawed, masculine paragon of strength that made Katie almost gawk at him every time she came in. His tan was deep and impressive - it had to be in preparation for the stage performances.<br />
<br />
And Owen&#39;s body had if anything even further toned and eliminated fat from his physique - while he had apparently undergone a few bulks, he was now so much more careful that these bulk ups just made him look even more impressive. And people around the gym were talking about him now more than ever. <br />
<br />
And Owen didn&#39;t know if he found that welcoming or more than a little concerning. Or, hell, if he found it kind of hot he was looking so good. He wasn&#39;t usually the super narcissistic type, but when he&#39;d put on his stringer this morning, he&#39;d been shocked by just how buff, tall and strong he looked. He&#39;d heard of a growth spurt, but he figured that was the kind of thing that happened in the teenage years. Now when you&#39;re 21.<br />
<br />
Owen helped Katie get the right form on a dumbbell laying down kickback, and then consulted the mirror. He could not for the life of him rationalize it. The way he&#39;d changed so far. But he liked it. The only thing was it seemed his...his HAIR seemed different. He ran a hand through it. He didn&#39;t remember if he&#39;d gone with a longer cut lately, but that was what he had now. Not that it was a bad look or anything. Certainly gave him a certain image.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Big O, looking amazing today,&quot; Duncan said as he entered. And there was Duncan, coming in to do his legs today. Duncan visibly tried to keep himself from looking too long so that Owen didn&#39;t realize he was getting increasingly into the growing man. Just looking at him, Duncan had grown erect and had a number of fantasies run rife through his mind.<br />
<br />
Duncan did not know what Owen&#39;s opinion was on these kinds of things, and he didn&#39;t want to haphazardly let the personal trainer know. Some of that came down to shyness, otherwise, it was just making sure things didn&#39;t end badly. Still, he was good for now with just watching, enjoying, and quietly appreciating the displays Owen readily put on for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know it man, my client&#39;s doing great, I&#39;m feeling awesome!&quot; Owen flexed his two great peaks, and Katie finished up her tricep exercise in time to look at Owen and coo at his display.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, Owen,&quot; Katie started, touching one of the striations on his tricep, &quot;I&#39;ve got nothing going on mm, two days from now. And I have wanted to get to know you better.&quot;<br />
<br />
And there it was. Owen grinned, not knowing what was really going on here, his thoughts immediately going directly to sex. And well, obviously the date that she planned on, but it was obvious based on their interactions that she wanted him. And he intended to give her an all access pass to the gun show right before they retired for the night. Owen didn&#39;t really care what the story was about these weird changes going on with him.<br />
<br />
He just knew his client wanted him, and he wanted her. &quot;Well, Katie, I&#39;m all good with that. Let&#39;s finish up your workout for the day, then I&#39;ll see about my availability.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie gave it her all the rest of the workout, eager to make a show herself for her muscular date. She knew she could drive his desire up the wall, and see what that did to him when they met up at the date in two days. She had no doubts he would find the availability.<br />
<br />
Duncan chatted with Owen as Katie exercised, whispering in the &quot;21 year old&quot;&#39;s ear, &quot;Dude, check her out. She wants you, man, like bad. You really should find that availability...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me something I don&#39;t know,&quot; Owen said with a wry grin, and looked at Duncan, &quot;I mean, can you blame her? I just seem to pile on muscle day after day.&quot; He flexed again, and left Duncan having to cool himself off after that display. Still, even after all the changes, Owen had no idea what Duncan&#39;s real deal was.<br />
<br />
Following the workout, Katie and Owen met up at the front desk, and Owen immediately went right to the topic of conversation, &quot;So, about your &quot;date&quot; idea, I looked over my availability, and I&#39;m excited to let you know I have that day entirely off. Wherever you&#39;re good to go...&quot; He leaned forward on his desk, subtly flexing his pecs.<br />
<br />
And Katie took notice of this with a smile, &quot;How about dinner and meeting up at my place after?&quot; And more still, Katie looked forward to seeing how things changed with Owen. She considered if she should do anything with Duncan, and wondered about possibly giving him the same thing she was giving Owen. He was already pretty experienced, but considering what it was doing for Owen?<br />
<br />
Yeah, it could be good for him too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds great, Katie, I&#39;ll be looking forward to it.&quot; Owen then got up and excused himself to go change clothes for his own workout / flex for the mirror in the men&#39;s locker room, not even  noticing Katie looking intently at the exercising Duncan.<br />
<br />
Katie, having done the same aging &quot;spell&quot; on Dunc, decided to head out and get ready for the imminent date. She was looking forward to seeing where this all went with these two. Maybe she could do some more once they&#39;d reached a certain age...</p>
