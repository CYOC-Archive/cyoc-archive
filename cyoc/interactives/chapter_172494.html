<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Diane placed a well-manicured hand to her temple.  She felt strange, as if something was different about her.  She was seated behind her desk in her first hour World History class, her back perfectly straight as always- she&#39;d always prided herself on perfect posture.  She vaguely recalled confronting Noelle before that awful girl Ashley had attacked her lover Brianna with the ferocity of a pint-sized tigress...<br />
<br />
Wait.  Something in that sentence was dreadfully wrong, but she wasn&#39;t certain what.  She hoped the damage Ashley had done to Brianna&#39;s hair was minor- she enjoyed the girlish twintails her beloved sported.  They&#39;d been friends for a very long time, but only recently had they admitted their love for one another.  They&#39;d been taking it very slow to this point- casual intimacy, such as cuddling or sleeping next to one another, soft (but brief) kisses, light touches, and of course, embraces.  Her Brianna enjoyed hugs immensely.  The girl was practically her total opposite- short and childlike instead of tall and mature.  Bright and lively in total contrast to Diane&#39;s gloomy tranquility.  Brianna shyed away from violence, while Diane could be quite vicious to those that crossed her.<br />
<br />
And of course, Brianna had very large breasts, as if nature was mocking Diane for the one thing that flawed her elegant femininity.  Despite hormone treatments, puberty had failed her; Diane&#39;s chest was as flat as a boy&#39;s, as her breasts had never developed.  She of course, knew that it didn&#39;t mar her beauty; but at the same time, despite her cool, confident demeanor, she had insecurity in her heart- that she wasn&#39;t a woman at all, but some overgrown child.<br />
<br />
Brianna made all those feelings go away; the tiny girl wore her heart on her shoulder, and just being near her was enough to warm Diane&#39;s soul.  She tuned out the mundane ramblings of the teacher as she thought about her plans for her lover- their first time would be not left to chance!  She would rent out a hotel room in the city- the bedsheets and pillowcases would be black, of course.  The room lit only be candlelight, black rose petals on the floor.  She was debating if she should have classical music playing, or soft gothic rock.<br />
<br />
Cassidy had suggested Evanescence, which Diane supposed was barely tolerable.<br />
<br />
Cassidy.  The thought of the musician made Diane&#39;s lips twitch.  Their relationship had been anything but careful and measured.  The rocker girl was wild and chaotic, like fire.  Their first time had been spontaneous, and to Diane&#39;s surprise, Cass had taken the initiative.  Diane&#39;s dress had been ruined when Cassidy had almost literally ripped it off of her in their moment of shared passion, but she did not lament the loss.  She squirmed slightly thinking about Cassidy&#39;s tongue caressing her labia, the drummer&#39;s hot breath warming her groin.  Like Brianna, Cassidy didn&#39;t judge her flat chest at all; indeed, she had been quick to tease Diane&#39;s small, pink nipples with her mouth.<br />
<br />
She knew that Cassidy and Brianna also had strong feelings for one another- she couldn&#39;t wait for the night when she could arrange their menage a trois.  But she needed to be with Brianna alone, first.  It wasn&#39;t that she couldn&#39;t share her heart; Cassidy was closer to her than a sister.  But she wanted everything to be perfect.  There was a correct pacing to these things.  Brianna was so like a child, she needed to be prepared, guided, and seduced.<br />
<br />
She wondered which of them would give Brianna her first orgasm.  She would put money on Cassidy, the girl lacked any sense of patience.  She might even be the first to break Brianna&#39;s blessed seal of maidenhood.  But Diane didn&#39;t fret- her first time with Brianna would be epic, and the girl would be hers forever.<br />
<br />
She smiled, and ran her tongue over her teeth.  Not for the first time, she marveled at how nature had given her prominent eyeteeth.  They weren&#39;t proper fangs, of course, far too short, but they made her feel like a creature of the night, a wolf among sheep.  And she couldn&#39;t wait to nibble on Brianna&#39;s soft flesh, to make her lover shiver and squeal in pleasure...<br />
<br />
Mrs. Grace, the History teacher, sighed, as she tried to get Diane&#39;s attention.  The girl was intelligent, to be sure, but she was always off in her own private world, as if everything else around her was nothing more than a idle distraction.  If she didn&#39;t do so well on her tests and homework, she would swear the girl didn&#39;t care one whit about her education.  And while her black dress was technically within the boundaries of the school dress code (she certainly showed less skin than most other girls), it made her look like some kind of vampire- unacceptable!<br />
<br />
Finally, she got the goth girl&#39;s attention, and asked her a question about the lesson.<br />
<br />
With patience boredom, as if she were the adult, and Mrs. Grace was an ignorant child, Diane answered, condescension dripping from her voice.<br />
<br />
Ashley, who shared the class with Diane, was highly entertained by the new and improved version of her friend.  Actually, if she was being honest with herself, she found Diane to be hot as hell, and was starting to become aroused.  Something had changed in her, and she wasn&#39;t sure what had sparked it.  Sure, as she&#39;d told Noah...Noelle...she&#39;d fooled around with girls before.  But it was nothing major, not enough for her to think of herself as a lesbian, or even bisexual.  It had been nice, that&#39;s all.<br />
<br />
But seeing Noelle, watching the boy she loved magically transformed into a beautiful girl- yes, Noelle made Ashley horny and even a bit frustrated (she knew she had to be gentle with Noelle, or she might push the other girl away- which was her own fault.  Noelle didn&#39;t trust other girls, let alone attractive ones).  But now she found herself seriously appraising other girls, and finding that, yes, she was aroused by other girls.<br />
<br />
Turning Diane and the other girls into lesbians had been no spontaneous decision- with these new feelings awakening inside her, she wanted to be able to share the experience.  And maybe, maybe, at some point, share other things as well.  At the moment, however, she had other concerns.  How would Noelle feel if Ashley admitted she had such desires?<br />
<br />
Hell, how would Noelle feel if Ashley admitted she wanted her to remain female?!  And she did.  She shivered thinking about it.  Then she swung her feet happily like a little girl- at her new diminutive height, they hung several inches above the floor.  &#39;I think I&#39;m going to have Noelle shrink me some more, I love how this feels.  Or even, make me younger, if she doesn&#39;t think that&#39;s weird.&#39;<br />
<br />
Diane had stood up.  &#39;Did Noelle wish her to be taller?  She seems taller&#39;.  And, in truth, she towered over even Mrs. Grace by a few inches, thanks to her heels.  The elegant girl folded her hands in front of her tiny waist as she began to lecture her teacher- apparently Diane&#39;s grasp of history far exceeded Mrs. Grace&#39;s training!<br />
<br />
Ashley noted she wasn&#39;t the only person checking out Diane&#39;s backside- those wide hips, the shapely rear.  She didn&#39;t need breasts to attract the attention of boys (not that there weren&#39;t a few girls other than Ashley enjoying the view!).<br />
<br />
That had been kind of the point, in ever other way, Diane was a gothic goddess of a young woman.  Ashley had wanted her to have some flaw, some point of dichotomy to offset that perfection- but she was also curious if a woman could be beautiful and feminine without tits.  And the answer was a resounding &quot;hell yes&quot;.<br />
<br />
Ashley surreptitiously slid out her phone and texted Noelle.  &quot;Hey, could you wish that Mrs. Grace was shorter, and maybe less experienced?  Like just out of college?  Will explain later.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was no reply, but then she noticed that, yes, Diane seemed to loom over Mrs. Grace even more, the teacher&#39;s meek refusal to stand up to Diane continuing longer as she dwindled in height.  Her features softened, crow&#39;s feet around her eyes vanished, and her hair seemed to take on a lighter color.  The blemishes of age vanished, and she soon looked more like a cute co-ed than a woman in her 30&#39;s.  Her confidence drained away as she forgot the hard-earned lessons of how to demand the respect of teenagers, and while her college lessons seemed fresher in her mind, facts gained since then were forgotten.  Even worse, she became aroused by Diane, as she&#39;d dabbled heavily in relationships with other women during her college years, before she&#39;d met her husband.<br />
<br />
Finally she couldn&#39;t take it any more, torn between her shame at being berated by the taller girl, and her growing lust- her business-style pantsuit hung on her shrunken frame, as she had gone from 5&#39; 9&quot; all the way down to 5&#39; 3&quot;.  She fled the room, her oversized heels left behind.  The class exploded in laughter, but suddenly, Diane slapped the teacher&#39;s desk.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Enough, class.&quot;  Diane ran her fingers through her raven black tresses, sweeping her locks behind one ear.  &quot;My lack of discipline has cost us our teacher, but I will continue the lesson in her stead.  Now, open your books to page 202, and we&#39;ll further discuss the economy of the years between 1910 and the Great Depression.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her tone brooked no dissent, and to Ashley&#39;s amazement, the students immediately settled down, and allowed the girl, one of their peers no less, teach the lesson.  Diane was in her element, answering questions, and when the bell rang, the students waited to be dismissed before leaving!<br />
<br />
She texted Noelle.  &quot;OMG, Mrs. Grace ran away, and DIANE took over teaching the class!  I think she&#39;s going to be more popular than I ever was!&quot;<br />
<br />
She got a reply.  &quot;Hail to the Queen.&quot;<br />
<br />
And then, &quot;I want to kiss you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiled.  Oh that would happen, very soon...<br />
<br />
Next!</p>
