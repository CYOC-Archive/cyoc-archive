<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Another excellent chapter written by the_doctor</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shelby woke up groggy and had no intentions of getting out of her comfortable and warm bed. Alas, she had to. Thankfully it was the weekend and the entire sorority house didn’t have any classes. So naturally it was a weekend to have fun, watch some movies, play some video games, the whole works. <br />
<br />
She got out of bed and slipped on a tank top. She saw the hideous tube top she had to wear and thanked whomever she didn’t have to wear it again! She sniffed the air realizing that food was cooking downstairs. She could almost feel her mouth watering knowing that Harmony’s cooking was going to hit the spot!<br />
<br />
She peeked out her room and saw that no one else was up. Thinking she got up extra early, she checked her watch and saw it was nearly ten in the morning. This was indeed odd, because the girls would usually be up by now. <br />
<br />
She shrugged and headed downstairs. She recalled the previous day with Ms. Sunderland and the other girls and found it even stranger that she didn’t really remember much of it. She remembered going to class, the teacher saying some things and then it was kind of a blur. Next thing she knew, she was walking out of the classroom and into her room. <br />
<br />
The smell got stronger as she walked into the kitchen. Still somewhat half asleep, she grabbed a seat at the table.<br />
<br />
“Morning Harmony.” Shelby said through a yawn. <br />
<br />
“Good morning sweetie!” A cheery voice said. <br />
<br />
There was a bit of a pause. It sounded like Harmony, but somehow it sounded different, more mature sounding. Shelby lifted her head up and took a better look at the person at the stove. Their back was turned, but she could tell almost immediately, it wasn’t Harmony!<br />
<br />
“W-who are you?!” Shelby said getting up and heading over to the phone in preparation to call 911. <br />
<br />
“It’s Harmony, silly.” She giggled. The person turned towards her and smiled. It WAS Harmony! Only difference was, she looked older and much curvier!<br />
<br />
“It’s can’t be!” Shelby said setting the phone down and walking over to Harmony. “W-what happened to you? You look so much older!”<br />
<br />
“Older? What on earth are you talking about pumpkin?” Harmony asked confused. What was wrong with her? She was a college student the night before and now she’s acting like being a milf is no big deal! Did she not notice that she aged at least twenty years over night!?<br />
<br />
“You don’t notice anything is off?” Shelby asked trying to make sense of what she was witnessing. Harmony only shook her head. “You were a twenty something year old college student just last night!”<br />
<br />
Harmony only laughed. “Oh sweetie, you’re too much. You know I just turned 42 a week ago! Don’t make me blush!”<br />
<br />
Shelby couldn’t help but ogle at what had become of Harmony. She looked like something out of a 50’s pinup magazine! For being “42” years old, she looked amazing! She had a bit of wrinkles on her face, but they weren’t anything too incredibly noticeable. In fact, they gave her a very mature and sexy look to her. Her outfit only furthered the 50’s look with a black and red polka dot dress. Shelby even had to admit, it was super cute and waned one, but right then and there, there was more pressing matters! Those curves that Harmony possessed now were certainly something to marvel at! The Harmony before didn’t have much of anything, but certainly wasn’t a stick. Now, sported a chest that would almost rival Shelby’s size! In fact, upon inspection, Shelby would notice that Harmony’s new chest was actually bigger! <br />
<br />
Shelby could only look at the brand new Harmony and just think as to what had happened. Because it was very apparent that her mindset had changed!<br />
<br />
<br />
EARLIER THAT NIGHT<br />
<br />
<br />
Harmony went into her room after all the girls had returned home from classes and had all eaten dinner. Beaten and worn out, Harmony began to undress for bed. She pulled her ponytail out at let her hair fall down to her shoulders. Then she slipped off her glasses and set them down on the nightstand next to her bed. She slipped off her shirt and pants and stood there left in a pair of panties. Her breasts were honestly so small that she could get away of not wearing one! Harmony didn’t have too much as far as curves, but what she did have, she made the best of it.<br />
<br />
“I swear…that Shelby girl could honestly share a bit.” She said to herself. It wasn’t that she was jealous of their new sorority sister, but there were times where she wished she did have bit in the name of curves. Looking down at her flat chest she shook her head and began to get ready for bed. <br />
<br />
However, as soon as she was getting into her bed, she was not only hit with a wave of nausea, but her body felt hot.<br />
<br />
“Whoa…what the…?” She said feeling a bit woozy. She sat on the edge of her bed and tired to wait for it to pass. Maybe it was something she ate that wasn’t agreeing with her? Maybe she caught a bug and wasn’t aware of it? But all she knew was that this nausea wasn’t letting up. So she got up and headed over to her vanity that was in the corner of her room. She looked at herself in the mirror and through her blurred vision she couldn’t really notice anything out of the ordinary. Thankfully, she kept a spare pair of glasses in her vanity draw just incase her original pair were lost or broken. <br />
<br />
Once they were slipped on, she noticed something odd. Slight crows feet were developing on her face. Nothing too drastic, but she saw them plain as day. Then more of her face began to look strange. Her skin looked a little looser, giving her laugh lines and various other forms of wrinkles. Harmony wanted to scream, but something was preventing her from doing so! It was almost as if, she weren’t allowed to! <br />
<br />
She got up from her vanity nearly knocking her chair over and felt her legs feel weak. She felt her body heating up more and more.<br />
<br />
“W-what’s happening to me?” She said weakly. <br />
<br />
She began to feel a strange heat accumulate in her chest as it was almost like it were harder to breath! She clutched her chest tightly as felt an odd softness. She looked down at her bare chest and saw that there were more than just dainty little nipples. There were actual boobs beginning to bud on her chest! With each breath she took, she could see her chest beginning to expand. Slowly approaching A cups, then to small B cups, enough for her to wear a bra! Then they finally began to grow into C cups, looking more and more like boobs! A set she should have had! A part of her was excited to see a pair of breasts growing on her body, but another made her feel like something was terribly wrong! Her breasts gave another push into the D cup range! She even let out a very sensual moan feeling her skin stretch. Pushing more into the DD and E cup range, Harmony began to feel like her chest was getting a little too big. Her boobs had other plans! Slowly but surely, they swelled into the F cup territory and plowed through the G cup range, surpassing Shelby’s size and slowly settling down to a stop on a very healthy and very large size of H cup breasts.<br />
<br />
“Oh my god! My boobs!” She said heaving them up and feeling their heft and their size. Never in her life had she ever see, let alone, feel boobs that big! But the fact that those massive boobs were on her chest made her feel euphoric! <br />
<br />
However, that all too familiar heat returned to her body, but this time in her ass. If she knew any better, that heat would do the same to her ass as it did to her boobs. She looked back and saw just in time another beautiful sight! Her once almost flat ass began to gain a bit of a bump. She could even feel her panties that she kept on begin to tighten as her ass began to look more like booty than a butt. It very clear, whatever was happening to her was making sure she had some epic curves! The more her ass swelled, the tighter she felt her panties getting. Her butt was certainly looking more like something out of a porn video or maybe even a rap video! The more she looked, the more it looked like her ass belonged on rap artist! Even her panties were starting to look more like a thong due to her swelling butt cheeks! Though she didn’t want it to end, she eventually felt her growing ass slow to halt. <br />
<br />
She took in several deep breaths and looked at herself in the mirror. Sure, she had the boobs and the butt of a luscious pornstar, but she looked like she had the face of a forty something year old milf. Granted, a very attractive milf, but a milf nonetheless!<br />
<br />
“What…happened to me?” She said clutching her throat, as she even sounded older, much more husky sounding, maybe even sexy sounding!<br />
<br />
Then like getting hit by a train, she felt a pain shooting through her head. She clutched it hard feeling something going on her head. Memories began to form into her head. Slowly but surly her old life began to vanish and be replaced with memories of a new one. She was still Harmony Morgan, but she was now recently turned 42 being born in 1976. She was even a mother of three now! She shook her head knowing these weren’t real, but more that were shoved in, the more she was convinced that the young Harmony was the fake. More and more memories leaked into her head. She recalled her wedding day. The day she had her first child. The day she became a housewife. All the time she spent in the kitchen, cleaning up the house, taking care of her child, taking care of her husband, everything! <br />
<br />
Harmony was now a 42-year-old sexy milf who adored cooking and cleaning and taking care of her “daughters”. She remembered coming to the sorority house and becoming a sort of mother to the girls. It was almost like her new job. <br />
<br />
<br />
PRESENT<br />
<br />
<br />
Shelby looked at Harmony. Harmony only smiled and went back to her cooking while humming to herself. She still couldn’t quite wrap her head around what she was seeing. All she knew was that Harmony was now some sexy, busty milf. <br />
<br />
However, before Shelby could get any other questions out, she heard one of the doors open up upstairs.</p>
