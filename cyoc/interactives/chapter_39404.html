<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jessica was about to walk off when she remembered that Melissa was quite good with computers. Maybe she would be able to figure out what the Chronivac program did. She explained the situation to Melissa and together they went back to her room.<br />
<br />
Once in her room it took some maneuvering to get them both situated in front of the computer. Melissa ended up sitting in a chair directly in front of the computer while Jessica laid down with her horse body and looked over her friend's shoulder. Neither of them found anything about the situation particularly unusual and Melissa went about loading the program.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like you use it to make a picture of someone or something,&quot; Melissa commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had thought as much, but I couldn't get it to work,&quot; Jessica replied, not fully aware that she was now a centaur due to the options she had chosen when first trying the program.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, here's a menu to select a subject, why don't we put Brian's name in and make a funny picture of the jerk. If it's really good we can hang it all over the campus.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica laughed, &quot;Sounds good to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
After entering Brian's name Melissa looked over the options until she found one that made sense, 'Body Modification', &quot;This one must be how you chose what the picture will look like.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking over her shoulder Jessica saw an option she liked, &quot;Hey pick that one!&quot;<br />
<br />
The option she was pointing to was 'Pregnancy'.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, making a picture of Brian as a pregnant man? I like your style,&quot; Melissa snickered as she clicked it.<br />
<br />
There was a gender change option, which she chose not to use since she wanted the picture to be of Brian as a guy who looked pregnant. For month she selected 'nine' since she wanted to make it obvious what was going on. A window came up asking if she wanted the pregnancy to be frozen at that point in time and since she wasn't sure what it meant she clicked 'okay' since it seemed like the best option. &quot;Duration' she set at 'indefinite', for 'alter reality' she hit 'yes' and selected 'no' for 'awareness' figuring that if that combination didn't work she could go back and edit it later.<br />
<br />
All that was left was 'transformation time' and for that she typed in 'ten minutes' figuring that was how long the picture would last on the computer. Plenty of time to save and print out the pictures if they turned out good. Smiling she hit 'save and apply'.<br />
<br />

<br />
In his room Brian was trying to get his homework done. He had big plans for partying that night and he wanted to be able to enjoy it without having to worry about having work to do. As he worked on his essay he felt an odd twinge in his stomach and rubbed gently at it, hoping that he wasn't coming down with something. Getting sick on a weekend would be terrible. A feeling of tightness across his chest took his mind away from his stomach, making him wonder if it was from sitting hunched over his laptop for so long. Putting the computer aside he got up off of his bed and stretched.<br />
<br />
The tightness at his chest increased as it began to swell out into a pair of breasts. He rubbed at them, feeling their weight, but unaware that there was anything strange about them. Mentally he justified the feeling of discomfort there due to his shirt being too tight. He lifted it up and gently massaged his growing breasts, enjoying the sensations that came from them. His nipples, much larger and darker now, perked up and he played with them for a short time until his breasts reached their full size at an impressive d-cup and a feeling of warmth began to emanate from his nipples. When he let go of them they rested heavily against his chest without support. There was a sensation of fullness in his breasts, they swelled up a bit rounder, their weight seemed to increase and milk began to bead on the ends of his nipples. Reality adjusted and a padded bra appeared on his chest to support his heavy breasts and keep milk from soaking through onto his shirt. <br />
<br />
He then turned his attention to his stomach rubbing at it as he felt another twinge. It was swelling rapidly now, but his only response was to unbuckle his belt to give it more room to ease the discomfort. As he loosened his belt several notches his growing belly pushed his pants down a bit. Sighing he buckled his belt as his belly grew so large and tight that it pushed his belly button out and settled into the low, heavy position one would see in a pregnant woman.<br />
<br />
Letting his shirt drop back down he stretched and rubbed at his back, with all of the extra weight he was carrying, he starting to get a backache. He noted that his shirt was pushed up quite a bit by the size of his breasts and belly, so that a fair portion of his stomach was visible, but once again reality adjusted, turning his shirt into something more akin to a loose fitting maternity gown.<br />
<br />
Yet another, much stronger twinge came from his swollen belly, but this time he simply folded his hands over his stomach, smiling slightly as he felt the rolling sensation. Though he was not sure why the feeling struck him as being pleasant, comforting as though it was a sign that everything was alright.<br />
<br />
Once he finished writing his essay he decided that he would take a nice, warm shower. The idea of partying didn't seem that appealing to him anymore. He just wanted to relax, maybe hang out with Sarah later if she wasn't going to any parties that night.<br />
<br />
With a sigh he sat back down on his bed and tried to find a comfortable position to to his homework, one where his belly and breasts wouldn't get in the way of his typing.</p>
