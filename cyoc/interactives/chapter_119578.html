<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The alarm went off early in Jenny and Karen&#39;s dorm room. Its steady beeping was enough to get both up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, today&#39;s the big day,&quot; Karen said as she reached out and flipped off the alarm, &quot;You get your man and will be secure in staying in Moon Lake...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jenny gave a small smile and looked over to her roommate as she sat up and then to the door to the inside closet area. The door was presently open both wedding dresses were hanging from the open door and protected by plastic. The first was white and sleek, and in it&#39;s own way reflected the generous curves that she grew when she became a werefox. That she liked very much as it reinforced her joy at being with Harry. However, the other dress represented the problems and worries that her own family represented, but she was still confident that she could make it work in the end. It was a problem, but in the end, it was a solvable one. &quot;And hopefully will provide for some real peace.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know that will happen,&quot; Karen gave an encouraging smile, &quot;Everyone is with you and I&#39;m sure if your dad causes real trouble, Peter and the other males that are helping with security will make sure that he won&#39;t harm you... at least not physically, anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Jenny managed a small smile as she looked over to Karen. She did feel fairly confident that physically she would be safe. The big thing would be more with the emotional conflict in dealing with her parents and what would likely happen if her younger siblings accepted the idea of emancipation from her parents and staying in Moon Lake with Jenny to keep them safe. If that happened, Jenny knew she&#39;d need to reveal to them that weres were real and that she was one of them, as if they did agree to stay with her, Jenny knew that her now wide hips and F cup chest would be easily noticeable. She&#39;d need to make sure that her younger siblings would be okay and wouldn&#39;t be fearful of her so that she could keep them safe from her parents. &quot;The big issue though is more on the emotional side...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Karen sighed as the two of them gathered the things they&#39;d need for a quick morning shower before breakfast, &quot;but... your therapy sessions were helping with that, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
From what she knew about Jenny&#39;s parents, Karen couldn&#39;t believe their stances. She&#39;d had a fairly good family life and couldn&#39;t believe that people would hold the opinions that Jenny&#39;s parents did. Karen felt relieved when Jenny smiled and nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I feel ready,&quot; Jenny assured her, &quot;I&#39;m good with that. So, when will Peter be by to pick us up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny watched as Karen looked over to the small alarm clock that she had by her bed. With a quick look at it, Karen then turned back to Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Peter should be by in about an hour,&quot; Karen spoke, &quot;He&#39;ll then take us to get a quick bite to eat and then tot he church to get changed for the wedding. We have time for a quick shower.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
At the Jenkins home, Harry woke up with the rising of the sun and put on a pair of shorts and a shirt to move to have a quick breakfast before dealing with the work needed to get ready for the first ceremony. Some of the nervousness was still there, but at the same time he was still quite happy. He would marry his bonded mate and they would have many years of happiness together. As he came through the living room he found Huck and Betty cuddled together on the couch and sleeping calmly together. Huck even had one arm wrapped around Betty. Betty&#39;s scent indicated that she was still a normal human woman, but Huck still held Betty close to him. This made Harry smile in the fact that Huck had finally found a real partner for him to be with, even if she was a friend that he&#39;d had since high school.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Huck,&quot; Harry said to his older brother and bent over and shock Huck&#39;s shoulder with a free hand.<br />
<br />
The shake wasn&#39;t hard and Harry made sure he wasn&#39;t shaking Huck in any way that would disturb the stitches holding his wounds closed. After a moment, Huck&#39;s eyes fluttered open, as did Betty&#39;s. Huck soon looked up to Harry and gave a small grunt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm... Harry,&quot; Huck said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning,&quot; Harry gave a small smile, &quot;sleep well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Huck gave a small smile as he and Betty began to get up, both of them being careful to avoid having any sort of accident, &quot;I think... I think because I know I have someone...&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry watched as Betty smiled as she looked to him. He did feel glad for Huck finding happiness or maybe recognizing the happiness he had. It reminded him of the happiness he had with Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know the feeling,&quot; Harry commented, &quot;How&#39;s your arm/shoulder doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Huck took a deep breath and looked to the area where nightshirt he was presently wearing covered up the wound that had been inflicted on him.  He then slowly rolled the shoulder on that side up and down. After that, he looked up to Harry and gave a shrug.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s doing well,&quot; Huck spoke, &quot;turning back to my human form might be a bit uncomfortable, but I&#39;m feeling much better. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ll be fully recovered by Monday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still... rest until the doctors can run their scans and be sure that you&#39;ve healed,&quot; Betty spoke and held Huck&#39;s hand. Huck nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I will,&quot; Huck answered, &quot;though I will look out for my baby brother. Make sure no one threatens him at the wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
Huck slowly got up and stood up next to Harry. Betty was also quick to her feet, straightening the over-sized shirt she wore as a nightgown. Harry focused to Huck and moved to usher him toward the kitchen. He noticed that Huck was giving him a fairly playful smile, which looked fairly cute on his canine muzzle, though Harry had long learned to be careful with the word cute with Huck, since Huck was a Pomeranian based weredog. Huck often wanted to project that he was strong and wasn&#39;t some lap-dog, and thus his aversion to the word &quot;cute.&quot; However, Betty would need to get dressed and all of them would need breakfast. Harry could hear some signs of his parents stirring in their room, which would mean that they would be coming out soon. They&#39;d all need breakfast to be ready on time.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t need to worry about my safety,&quot; Harry answered, &quot;Jenny&#39;s Maid of Honor is dating Peter Talbot and has gotten some of the werelions to commit some volunteers to aid with security and the police and Skulk will also protecting everyone there. In theory you and everyone should have no worries.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s good,&quot; Huck commented as Harry began to lead him toward the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Harry nodded, &quot;it&#39;s a lot and represents a lot of the stresses that we have with our wedding, but with the commitment to protecting Jenny... I&#39;m sure that there will be no further real issues with regard to physical safety. You two won&#39;t have any troubles...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only that my parents might just hug Huck to death given how well they got on over the years,&quot; Betty smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;But that&#39;ll be for the future,&quot; Huck commented, as he looked to Betty, &quot;I&#39;ll keep an eye on Harry while you get dressed.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Getting dressed and getting things ready went quickly for Jenny and Karen, and thankfully most of those in the dorm were still asleep as they went about their business of getting dressed and cleaned. No one was at the front desk as they made their way out and with Jenny holding onto the two plastic bags that protected her wedding dresses. Karen held the door for Jenny and they found that just as they came out, Peter Talbot came driving up in his own car, which to Jenny&#39;s surprise looked like it was a restored classic car. She&#39;d seen the model before, but more often than not, the cars she&#39;d seen were beat up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like we&#39;re all ready,&quot; Peter said with a polite smile he put the car in park, &quot;you two want breakfast?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I&#39;m starving,&quot; Karen commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;A shame the college&#39;s cafeteria and restaurants don&#39;t open this early,&quot; Peter commented, &quot;but thankfully Burger King is open twenty four hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny and Karen both climbed in. Karen moved to sit up front next to Peter while Jenny managed to get into the backseat. She hung her dresses on a hook and then sat back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, ready to go,&quot; Jenny spoke as the buckled herself in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then here we go,&quot; Peter smiled.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Breakfast went well, though Lisa Jenkins was more of the opinion that Harry shouldn&#39;t be cooking. In her words, &quot;any accident could spoil plans for the ceremony.&quot; But they managed ate and then got dressed. Harry even heard Huck grumbling a bit as he transformed to his human form and wrestle into the clothing he would wear for the wedding, with Betty offering encouragement and help. Once dressed, they all gathered in the living room. Huck stood fairly tall and in rather good shape, which was a sign that he was healing and he did look good.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, and the wedding is at the Baptist church, right?&quot; Betty asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Harry nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Betty nodded and put one arm around Huck, which Harry wasn&#39;t sure if it was to help hold Huck up or be close to him. However, Huck didn&#39;t complain, so it wasn&#39;t too big of an issue, &quot;Huck and I will follow in my car, and hopefully the morning ceremony will be all smiles.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It will be,&quot; Harry assured her, &quot;It will be.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was the second ceremony that had the potential for fireworks.</p>
