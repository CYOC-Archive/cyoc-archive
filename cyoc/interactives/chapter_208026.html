<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Assaulted by fear, Nate decided to run away. Escape is better than any fate he might receive in this situation, among these people. Too bad if he looked scrawny, he&#39;d use this to his advantage, run and dodge and find a place to hide. The captain could do unimaginable things to him and all sounded too horrid to contemplate. <br />
So Nate let the mop, bucket and utensils crash to the ground and bolted. He sprinted as fast as he could, dashing across the cave, beaches and going so fast and above all so suddenly that the pirates just stared at him. Some attempted to pursue him but Nate lost them easily in the bushes and thick vegetation. He collapsed after what seemed like hours of having lost the pirates, attempting to have his gasps and breathing kept to a minimum level of noise. He rested for a long time, panting and letting his beating heart calm down. He was dirty and exhausted but Nate decided to have a rest. All danger seemed far away now. <br />
Except itv wasn&#39;t. A loud crash, followed by shocks across the ground, made him sit upright. What was that noise? The sounds and tremors looked like something was approaching. Something impossibly big. Massive, even. Probably a monster about to eat him, or...<br />
Or a giant ape, as the monkey pushed aside vegetation and stared at him. The thing was at least seven meters high! And it had brownish light fur and a flower on her ear. The monkey was female, also proved by her slightly prominent chest. However, it stared at Nate, curious but certainly not aggressive. Yet of course Nate was frightened and recoiled in great terror when the ape approached a finger. He was too tired to run again! However, the ape just touched him and made little cooing noises, approaching slowly. She poked at him, which soon angered the boy.<br />
&quot;Hey! Hey, stop!&quot; he said angrily, swatting away the giant fingers.<br />
But the giant female ape didn&#39;t stop and continued in spite of Nate&#39;s protests. Worse, she seemed to find this highly amusing, poking a little harder and seizing him to place him in her lap as she sat, using her feet to proceed with more efficiency. But as she poked Nate&#39;s armpit a bit too hard and on his ticklish spot, he could not refrain a squeal of laughter. Amused and surprised, the ape laughed in joy and delicately grabbed his wrists so she could play more at this game. To Nate&#39;s anguish, the monkey could not tire of her new toy and soon he was squirming and giggling, his laughter echoing across the forest. The ape then decided to test out other methods of getting the odd little hairless monkey to make those funny noises. He looked so happy when he did! Helpless still, but a lot sweeter! Chucks under the neck, the lightest scratches, wiggling fingers, all of Nate&#39;s lithe bodies was subjected to this merciless tickling torture. The worst were the female kisses on his belly and butt, followed by her crooning noises. In fact, she poked him so much on his tummy that his bladder couldn&#39;t hold its contents. He screamed and cried in shame. But the ape didn&#39;t look nonplussed or angry. On the contrary, she shushed, placed him on her shoulder tp pat his back and went straight to a small river, where she ripped his clothes and tossed them like the filthy old rags they had become and dunked him in the water, splashing and scrubbing him. He squirmed and cried in outrage. She didn&#39;t pay attention. What a silly baby! All alone and with no one to take care of him. His mother had probably died and now he was all alone, incapable of looking after himself. He looked so helpless. But of course he didn&#39;t know any better, the poor little baby. Good thing she passed by! The other species of monkeys all had hair but this one was almost completely hairless. He must be a juvenile, a very young one in need of care and help. And she who was desperate for a baby! He was just so adorable! In no time he&#39;d be cuddly and so well-behaved!<br />
After washing him, she placed on him a few layers of folded broad leaved in which she stuffed dry soft moss. In case he had to urinate again. He would be hungry soo too. Then she cradled Nate in her arms to warm him up and dry him, crooning little sounds of comfort. Nate, of course, was completely humiliated and waited for his blood to return to his hands and feet to dash away, still mortified at the idea or running naked in a forest. But alas, his humiliation had just started.<br />
<br />
As Nate attempted to escape the motherly arms of the ape, she decided to get him to be more compliant but tickling him anew. So soon Nate had his butt pinched, his toes tickled and grabbed playfully, his belly poked and his feet kissed. As he laughed uncontrollably, he heard other roars of laughter. At a safe distance, the pirates were looking at him, pointing fingers and guffawing loudly. The female ape did not flee but held Nate closer to him, patting his back again with reassuring grunts.<br />
&quot;Looks like you found yourself a mama, boy!&quot; exclaimed the captain.<br />
The other pirates followed, commenting on how cute he was and how lucky the monkey was to have such a cute baby. They even had  seen him getting a bath and getting diapered. <br />
&quot;Please! Help me!&quot; pleaded Nate in desperation.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t think so,&quot; jeered the captain. &quot;Those apes aren&#39;t aggressive but getting her new baby snatched from her would anger her. Besides, you tried to escape. Looks like you&#39;re exactly where you should be.&quot;<br />
The other pirates laughed, enjoying every minute of Nate&#39;s predicament. <br />
&quot;No! I&#39;ll do anything you want! You can&#39;t leave me like this!&quot;<br />
&quot;Actually, no. I cannot. In fact...&quot; the captain smirked.<br />
He took out a large banana and proceeded to approach the ape. With caution, she took the banana, still wary and holding Nate close to her chesty and making sure he was safe and right where he belonged: next to her.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not really the right shape to please this kind animal in her desires of motherhood,&quot; said the captain with an evil grin. &quot;How about we remedy that?&quot;<br />
Nate&#39;s shouts of terror were interrupted by the monkey forcing half of the banana into his mouth. He swallowed it as best he could, terrified of what the captain was about to do.   <br />
&quot;Let&#39;s see... How about I regress you into her womb, so that she may enjoy your presence in her tummy and have the pleasure of giving birth to you?&quot;<br />
&quot;NO!!!&quot; shrieked Nate, appalled and horrified at the very thought. <br />
The mere idea was revolting and worthy of his worst nightmares.<br />
&quot;But... But your new mama is having so much fun with you,&quot; smiled the captain with an evil grin, clearly enjoying this little torture of his. &quot;It would be so cruel to deny her the opportunity to play with you and mollycoddle you as much as she wants. She&#39;d be devastated otherwise. So let;&#39;s render you as cute as she would love you to be.&quot;<br />
He cautiously placed his hand on Nate&#39;s thigh and let the magic seep in. Soon, Nate kept his round, bouncy buttocks but got more flesh around him. Indeed, he had a bulging belly and more fat. He was becoming extremely babyish. To add to that, the captain infused him with more youth, creating a chubby teen who would grow in size indeed but not too much. The ape just stared at the transformation, mesmerised and delighted. Now she truly had a baby! And an adorable what at that!She pressed his face against hers and then hugged him with all the love that could be expressed. All the pirates laughed at the sweet scenery. But Nate barely registered the laughing pirates and the pirate retreating back to his crew. His mind was swirling with new and conflicting emotions. Unbeknownst to him, the captain had also induced new thoughts into Nate&#39;s mind. He was now overcome with a desire please and regressed to a baby mind and instincts. His adult brain still existed but had to face more powerful urges. Soon he&#39;d realize it was better to just let go and obey his new impulses. Now Nate was overcome with a desire to please his new mama and to answer to her love, squirming and gurgling. Her attention made him bask into a warm and fuzzy feeling he wanted to feel always.<br />
<br />
As the monkey retreating into the forest, thinking in anticipation about the days spent tickling, poking and feeding her new baby, the pirates made their way back to their own camp, still laughing about the show they&#39;d seen and about the boy&#39;s future, his forced babification and his adult mind powerless to stop his fate and treatment. Maybe they&#39;d try to find him again just to see him and have a good laugh at his expense.</p>
