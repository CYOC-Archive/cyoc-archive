<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brittany sat in front of the mirror something that she had avoided doing but now that she was looking normal it didn&#39;t freak her out too much. Her family had been supportive and her sister was the best spending time with her in her room. She looked closely at herself, her skin was still pale but nowhere near the show white it was and she still looked as though she was wearing blush and blue eye shadow but her nose was back to normal. Her hair was still blue but there was a half inch of brown hair showed at the scalp and they had talked about buzzing her hair. She got up and walked over to her bed and tripped, falling flat on her chest which let out a small squeak. Brittany&#39;s heart started to pump hard when she heard it, her nipples hadn&#39;t squeaked for weeks. She slowly rolled over and looked down, and found one of her dogs chew toys under her. Laughing she picked it up and squeezed it a couple of time listening to the small squeak it emitted. Her heart rate returning to normal she got up she tossed it aside the toy and continued to her bed only to trip and fall again. Again she heard a small squeak and her heart rate sky rocketed again. Rolling over she looked at her feet at what had tripped her, her feet had shrunk and were still large for her age but not clown sized anymore, but no she noticed that they seemed to be growing. Her breath coming fast and hard now she ripped open her bathrobe and stared at her chest in horror. Before her eyes her breasts were enlarging to their former comical size. Her skin was turning pale and washing down her legs and up her breasts before with a pop her nipples exploded into pink balls larger than before as her breasts continued to grow past their former size. Sitting up against her bed she found that she was moving up and her hands fell to her ass and felt it expanding into a nice bubble butt lifting her higher. She tried to scream but she couldn&#39;t, she tried to slow her breathing but she need more air. Crying in horror she covered her mouth and found herself smiling, her lips bigger fuller and curling into a big smile.<br />
&quot;No&quot; she whispered in a high pitched helium clown voice and realizing it came out of her she started to laugh feeling light headed. Anger bubbled in her as she continued to laugh and feel silly. <br />
&#39;Why?&#39; she asked herself &#39;The treatment was working?&#39; <br />
She aimed a kick at her vanity with her now very large feet and a crash sounded as the mirror came off and broke on the floor. Brittany gazed at her refection in the broke shards, her body totally reverted back to a clown, her eyebrows gone, hair completely blue again and now tied back into twin ponytails, blue and green eye shadow and pink hearts freckles all there. She laughed and giggle, her mind totally gone, as a spot of red blossomed on the tip of her nose and began to grow. She watched it in anticipation, wanting it to happen, waiting. The spot grew before with a final pop it inflated into a clown nose the size of a peach, bigger and better than before. Laughing she squeezed it feeling pleasure jolt through her as a honk echoed in her room. Laughing and moaning she kept squeezing it and that is how her sister found her. <br />
Patti would do anything to help her sister and easily donated some blood to try and help her. She loved her and spent time with her closed off in her room understanding that she didn&#39;t want the world to see her like this. She had walked down the hallway and heard her laughing and a honking and ran into her room and found her sitting against her bed, her bathrobe open naked to the world, laughing and honking her clown new nose. Patti&#39;s scream had brought mom and dad racing up to her room.<br />
Looking up at her family giggling not caring that she was naked she continued to honk her nose &quot;Looky I&#39;m a silly clown, YEA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot; she yelled. Her family looked at each other in horror at this announcement and Dan reached for the phone to call an ambulance. Her parents got her up and bathrobe closed as the paramedics arrived.<br />
&quot;Our daughter is on a treatment to cure her clowness and she isn&#39;t right.&quot; both parents holding a giggling teenage clown between them.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine, I feel great. I have a silly clown nose now and great breasts.&quot; she giggled and swayed like she was drunk falling onto one of the paramedics &quot;Want to see?&quot; and she ripped open her bathrobe and pulled the guy&#39;s face between her enormous breasts all the while giggling. Finally having extracted himself from the soft mounds and sedating Brittany, they went to the hospital.<br />
Meeting with a team of doctors they explained to the family what had happened. &quot;The clown mutations has adapted to and overrode the DNA from Patti and has actually become stronger, hence why she seems have bigger clown features. And it also is either affecting her mind or she had a mental breakdown, she is acting more like a clown. We can hope that this is a cooping mechanism.&quot;<br />
&quot;We told you there could be unknown side effects and the treatment could not work. The clown genes adapting to the introduced DNA is one of them. This adaption will affect your family unfortunately.&quot; A stern looking woman said this slowly as if she was trying to lead into something bad. Patti, Dan and Shelly looked at each other trying to understand all this.<br />
&quot;We will help Brittany in any way we can.&quot; Dan stated without question.<br />
&quot;Yes but the clown genes have adapted to the introduced DNA.&quot; the stern woman repeated.<br />
&quot;Yes, we understand that.&quot; Dan stated<br />
&quot;No, you don&#39;t understand. The DNA was donated by Patti and the clown genes have adapted to her DNA and the retrovirus we used.&quot; The whole family sat in shock, Patti going pale at the news.<br />
Slowly Dan asked &quot;So is Patti at risk?&quot;<br />
&quot;I am afraid so the clown genes have adapted to the retrovirus and the DNA and anyone who shares that DNA and has had close contact will be infected with the clown genes.&quot; Patti went paler at this news but smiled. Realizing she was smiling she covered her mouth with a pale hand.<br />
&quot;Oh honey.&quot; Shelly wailed putting a arm around her daughter as she started to cry.<br />
&quot;Patti is already showing symptoms of the clown genes but it is more than that.&quot; Shelly and Dan started to cry at the thought of more bad news, Shelly&#39;s skin becoming flush and pink.<br />
&quot;Since Patti and Brittany have the same XX chromosome and got half of their DNA from you the mother the clown genes will affect you also.&quot; Shelly&#39;s scream was caught in her throat as a pink hand covered the white area developing around her mouth and eyes. Dan looked in shock at his wife and daughter both of whom are changing before his eyes.<br />
&quot;We are sorry, this complication was impossible to foresee.&quot;</p>
