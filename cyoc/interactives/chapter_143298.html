<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Mr. Morrison returned home, upon his arriving and walking into the barn, Jasper was there still in his box stall. Jasper and Jared were of similar concerns for what they had stood and watched, seeing friend Carl do a changing. Snorting and many nervous whinnies told Mr. Morrison that down deep inside Jasper, that Jared surmised what his father did to Carl was for an unscrupulous reason.  As Bob Morrison went to work cleaning up the personal items that Carl arrived there wearing, he ignored Jasper and put the box of clothing in the pickup truck.<br />
<br />
Upon his return to the barn, an excited Jasper was kicking his hind hoofs at the barn wall. He reared up high and pawed his fore legs; as if using his hoofs then like boxing gloves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, okay, calm down, so what is so wrong with you?&quot; Mr. Morrison asked, as knowing that Jared would understand his dad.<br />
<br />
A snorting horse stood there facing what part of him knew the man as a father figure and his counterpart knew Bob to be his master.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, and yes, your friend Carl knew your, our secret. He came here looking for you, but noted then Danny and those four pony mares. He asked a lot of fool questions, and had high hopes of him trying, becoming like you a stallion. His parents are away, his father a tour guide to Asia for six weeks and his mother away tending to her daughter and a sick child. Carl saw the leaving of him at home alone for some weeks as a perfect time to ask and try his being a stud animal.<br />
<br />
Carl was adamant about his desire to know what you feel from being a male animal; he did not care really whether his change was to a horse, bull, goat, or pig. A phone call to me from Mr. Benson asking if I owned a Devon breed bull was the start of my offer to Carl for his urgent wish to know life from the other side of the fence. He was more than willing to become a bull; and to show his horny desires, not five minutes after he had arrived to the Benson farm, he stood humping a cow, sheath deep and thrusting!&quot; Mr. Morrison told, as Jasper and Jared listened intently.<br />
<br />
All was silence between the man and his equine with son, as Jared remained but the life force that the medallion used to re-create Jasper.<br />
<br />
&quot;I leased Carl to Mr. Benson for four weeks while he mates with the cow herd. I will check with him at the end of his fun fling, giving him my offer to return him here, or stay there as a Bull for the use Mr. Benson&#39;s herd. Eric has written his hope of remaining as Danny, your pet Shetland pony. His mother thinks he went for a cross-country hike with you. I am not sure what to do now that Eric likes being a pony stallion, as his mother wishes her son to return home.<br />
<br />
It would have been wise never to tell your, our secret. I will tell you that your Mom does not like my plan for you to remain a horse during every weekend and at breeding sessions. She looks far along the road of life, where I have a special need to supply an income for our family, and Danny plus you, as well Carl can enhance the year end finances quite handsomely.<br />
<br />
I am somewhat surprised your younger brothers Kevin and even Mitch having overheard your mother and me arguing, that they have not voiced a wish to be other than as what they were born. With you out here in the barn, your mother got to cleaning your bedroom and found a host of girly magazines. I told her you were going through a youthful male phase and not to worry, as presently you sexual thrills will be with eyeing a mare vulva, sniffing the scent and licking before any mating.<br />
<br />
Although I have officiated over many a horse breeding session, seeing how a mare takes and offers her body to the delights of a stallion, I think about comparing my relationship with your mother, as she rules over me when we are in bed. The Medallion could change her feminine overbearing attitude, and given the situation, the right timing, I just might make a slight change to regulate our married lifestyle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared was old enough to know much about his parents. They often fought about the money he spent, or as he said, he invested. The owning of that Medallion was something new and neither Jared or his father knew what rules came with such power.<br />
<br />
&quot;Buzz-buzz,&quot; the cell phone on Mr. Morrison announced an incoming phone call.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Morrison Farm, Bob Morrison speaking. Yes he is, his semen was tested and his health is just fine for breeding. Oh, yes he is a pedigree Appaloosa stallion, born, reared, and trained here for riding. He is gentle and reacts as intelligent, should do well as a stud for any mare. Oh you own an Appaloosa mare, well come and see her stallion. When, now, sure, oh and if you wish to, bring her along to meet Jasper, if they act as willing we could get her bred this weekend. Oh and thanks for calling!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well there Jasper, you get to meet a cute mare, I hope the both of you find her as enjoyable!&quot; Bob said, as he smiled, knowing his son was in for a wild thrill that afternoon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lunchtime,&quot; Mrs. Morrison called from the rear porch of the house to all in ear shot.<br />
<br />
Mr Morrison had interesting new to tell his wife, and since Jared was as Jasper, with both Kevin and Mitch at school, he had a private time to boast about what the family would earn that year.</p>
