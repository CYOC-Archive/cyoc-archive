<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joe leaned back on the couch, one arm resting on his girlfriend Cassie’s shoulders as she rested her head against his neck. It was Friday evening on the week of the Assembly, and Cassie’s parents were out of town on work, so they’d decided he should spend the night; they could eat some pizza, watch some movies, and maybe do a little bit… more. That’s what Joe was hoping for, anyway. Anything to take his mind off of what had been going on at school this week. <br />
<br />
Joe was the school’s star football player, and he was one of the few boys left on his team – or, honestly, at all. Every day there were more boys who gave in to whatever that strange magic Sarah had done was and did something – anything – stereotypically girly, and by the time they were through, they were girls themselves. Just this morning, he’d walked in on his best friend Ryan trying on a corset of all things in an empty classroom, helped by two giggling girls, one of whom, a perky punk named Sami, had been a boy herself just two days ago. No sooner had the corset been laced all the way up than Ryan had turned before Joe’s eyes into a ravishing, raven-haired goth who’d turned to wink at him and ask if he’d like to join her. Needless to say, Joe had bolted, and later that day he’d had a science class with her; she was calling herself Raven now and, as usual, nobody – students or teachers – treated the transformation as anything out of the ordinary. <br />
<br />
And the fact was, a part of Joe did want to join her. He knew it was Sarah’s magic, but that little voice in his head telling him to try on makeup, or a skirt, or to shave his legs kept getting louder. He always managed to resist it, though. However tempting being a girl was coming to seem, he didn’t want to give up his sports or his relationship with Cassie, the hottest girl on the cheer squad. He was living the dream, wasn’t he? And if Sarah was right, he just needed to hold out until the end of the weekend, and then he’d be free. So when Cassie had called and asked if he wanted to come over, he’d jumped at the chance. Anything to keep his mind off things. <br />
<br />
Now, however, another sensation was distracting him. “Gotta pee,” Joe said, getting up as Cassie nodded at him. He used the bathroom down the hall and was on the way back to the sofa and the movie when he passed the door to Cassie’s bedroom, which was open a crack. Drawn by a force he couldn’t understand, Joe stuck his head in and saw, lying on the bed, arranged as neatly as if they’d been left out for him, was a sports bra and panties. Curiosity getting the better of him, Joe stepped inside. <br />
<br />
He stared down at the bra and panties, and it suddenly seemed to him that they looked much more comfortable than boys’ underwear. Put them on, a little voice seemed to say in his head. Try them on. “No,” Joe said out loud, shaking his head. He knew what would happen if he listened to that little voice. “No, I won’t. I like being me. I don’t want to change.” But do you really, the little voice said? You like playing sports, but girls can play sports, too. You like Cassie, but you wouldn’t have to give her up just because you were a girl. You know she’s bi. And lesbian porn’s always been your guilty pleasure. Don’t you want to know what it’s like? Don’t you want to be able to connect with Cassie girl to girl, without that bothersome masculinity in the way? <br />
<br />
Joe shook his head, trying to clear it. He called up images of Cassie in his mind as a defense and remembered the last time they’d had sex, but that was a mistake. Strange new images invaded his mind; laying on his back, giving high-pitched moans as Cassie played with his nipples and breasts… panting as she ate out his wet pussy… giving a final cry of pure delight as he came with a glorious, full-body female orgasm… <br />
<br />
Before he realized what had happened, Joe had stripped. He was staring at himself in Cassie’s full body mirror, seeing the body he’d always been so proud of but now seemed gross and ungainly. Sweating heavily, he pulled on the panties first, then the sports bra. His body shook as the changes began; he lost several inches in height as his limbs and torso shrank, becoming more slender but still toned with muscle. Hair retreated into his legs, leaving them smooth – I’ve always loved girls with long, shapely, athletic legs, he thought with a strange thrill, and now I have them too – and his hips expanded as his waist narrowed. Something gurgled between his legs as his dick and balls were sucked inside, forming the hungry female genitalia he’d just imagined having. His face feminized, his features becoming more delicate, more… cute. His hair, which he’d always kept cropped short, grew out, forming itself into one of those cuts that was kept closely shaved on one side and longer on the other. Joe had never much cared for that look – he’d always thought it was a lesbian cut – but now it seemed appropriate. Why wouldn’t it be? I’m a lesbian, after all, he – she – thought. A cute, sporty lesbian. Finally her breasts swelled, filling out the sports bra. Not too big, but enough to be noticeable and very well shaped – and, she realized with a bit of a naughty thrill, it felt like her nipples were pierced. <br />
<br />
Joe was gone as if he’d never been. Now she was Joy, the school’s sexy, lesbian star soccer player, standing in her girlfriend’s bedroom in her underwear, and she couldn’t be happier. She was who she’d always been meant to be. And so engrossed in her changes was she, she almost didn’t notice as someone slipped up behind her and wrapped her arms around her torso, just below her breasts. “Hey there, cutie,” Cassie whispered into her ear. “Love the new look. I see you found my present. How do you feel?” <br />
<br />
Joy leaned back against her girlfriend, realizing as she did so that they were now the same height. “I feel,” she said, as Cassie nibbled on her ear, “great. Really great. So, what should we do now?”</p>
