<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Angie wasn't sure what to think. first her husband had vanished into thin air, just poof. She <br />
had gone up the walls and through the roof looking for him, the police almost acted like <br />
zombies in regard to her husband vanishing, like their minds couldn't even focus on the <br />
task or idea, Angie was disgusted. Jennifer of course had been even more distraught, at <br />
least Angie had managed for a while to keep her at bay by simply telling her that Carl was <br />
on a long trip and nothing more. <br />
<br />
Angie had even begun to consider the very realistic possibility that Carl was dead. Her <br />
loving husband, he wasn't the greatest catch in the world, but he was devoted to her, and <br />
she loved him and they both loved and cared for their child. <br />
<br />
She had discovered much to her horror of items with Carl's names on them vanishing, and <br />
her own memories of him seemed to be slowly dancing away... it was totally illogical and <br />
irrational, and did her best to rationalize it anyway she could. <br />
<br />
But suddenly, they all came back in a flood, all the memories that had been vanishing, and <br />
all the images and name of Carl on various photographs, e-mails, and documents <br />
returned.  Angie had no idea how to explain it, for the sake of her sanity did her best to <br />
pretend the entire episode didn't happen. But at the end of the day her husband was still <br />
missing. <br />
<br />
Then she showed up on her front door step. A naked humanoid fox woman creature. But <br />
Angie never thought of screaming or calling animal control or thinking the martians had <br />
landed. <br />
<br />
She'd like to say it was the look in her eyes, or her style of speech, of her body language, <br />
or the features hidden underneath that fur, muzzle, and a missing Y chromosome, but <br />
while in retrospect and now she could decidedly see those things, at that moment, the <br />
only thing that enable her to recognize this person who she was. And Angie couldn't <br />
understand what that thing was. It wasn't a neon sign. It wasn't a name tag. But, it felt like <br />
there was some of -message- implanted in the being before her, that said, beyond all <br />
doubt, the person before her was her husband. <br />
<br />
Whatever the message was, Jennifer apparently heard it too, she couldn't stop talking <br />
about how furry and soft her daddy was now. Though she was rather confused on her <br />
father still BEING her father despite evidence to the contrary, but that all besides the point <br />
for Jennifer, her daddy had returned and that was that. <br />
<br />
The story Carl told, or Charlene as she explained her name was now, was beyond belief, if <br />
not the for the physical evident talking to her at that very moment. <br />
<br />
The violation done to her husband was unthinkable, and what she had endured to escape <br />
was incredible, and.. the choices she had made to return her, brought tears to Angie's <br />
eyes. Though she often wonder about these new sisters Carl said she had, and Angie <br />
wondered if they would ever get to meet them. <br />
<br />
With the mainstream media being no use, Angie had been reduced to tabloid and <br />
conspiracy site to glean through the muck what was happening in the middle east <br />
regarding the events surrounding Carl.  After countless absurd connections to Judo-<br />
Christians and 9/11, and the war between Anonymous and Scientology, she managed to <br />
find the notes about the mysterious city of the fox people, and reports of several people in <br />
the surrounding villages finding themselves with tails and fur.   <br />
<br />
Angie wished Carl's sisters good luck.<br />
<br />
There was nothing else making Angie cry right now. Though she still loved her husband <br />
dearly, she simply didn't feel the biological attraction she had before. She just couldn't. <br />
They tried their hardest... they really did... noble effort really... but it was fruitless. <br />
<br />
Angie didn't bother to think how utterly bizarre it was that Carl's coworkers and friends <br />
seemed only vaguely aware of Carl's transformation, only that her friend was back from <br />
his/her mysterious ordeal. It was like they knew about Carl's transformation only as an <br />
after thought. They had to -reminded- not to step on her tail. <br />
<br />
What mattered to Angie was... her husband... she was with him again, but she couldn't be <br />
with -her-. It was like fate was playing some childish game with her for it's own <br />
amusement. <br />
<br />
She sat in her bedroom, wondering what to do, what she could do, besides pray for a cure <br />
to magically appear out of thin air. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mrs, I've just flew all the from Japan and indeed my tails are tired.&quot;<br />
<br />
Angie started and turned around in a flash, seeing the multitaled fox sitting on her bed, <br />
unlike the ones her husband had described this one wasn't humanoid in the least, and <br />
some small details suggested this was no fox. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Angie, my name is Keiko, Charlene told me bits and pieces about you, myself and a <br />
friend chose to take the scenic rout to some friends of ours, and I decided to drop by.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;K-k-keiko... wait... wasn't that... who are you?&quot; 'Don't give information that can be played <br />
back to you for proof.' <br />
<br />
&quot;I am one of Charlene's sisters, another of Karther's victims, and someone who chose not <br />
to return their old life or fight Karther's growing plague of insanity.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What... what are you doing here?&quot; Angie whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm here... to make you an offer, normally as a kitesune I'd throw in a catch as is my <br />
nature, but I think my new species needs some good PR... as the Prince of all desert foxes, <br />
and myself a japanese kitesune, I don't have the power or authority to undo Karther's <br />
bodily transformation upon your husband.. but I do have a way you two can be together... <br />
if you want... but be careful, I doubt there'll be a way back once you've mad your choice.&quot;  <br />
A small pendant appeared appeared on the bed in front of the majestic fox spirit. It was <br />
shaped like a male fox furry. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't try to use this to cure your husband or she WILL suffer a horrible fate, mixing of <br />
magics is never pleasant. Place this on yourself knowingly and willingly, and you'll become <br />
a humanoid fox male, desert of japanese or european will depend on yourself... wear it for <br />
twenty four hours and the transformation will become permanent with or without the <br />
pendant... take it off within that twenty four hours period knowingly and willingly, and <br />
you'll transform back, and the pendant will loss all of it's power. I'll also rigged it to only <br />
work on you just in case you daughter decides to try it on while you're thinking things <br />
over.  ... With this transformation, people will comprehend you as a person, and as a male <br />
fox, your family will fully comprehend your transformation but also recognize you for who <br />
you are. Those who don't or are passing acquaintance will be aware of what you are on a <br />
subconscious level. This'll your choice.&quot;   <br />
<br />
&quot;Why not... why not just make it able to transform into a... a... like that when I'm in bed <br />
with... her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because... living a double life -would- destroy you. You can't walk two paths in life. I'd <br />
say hello to Charlene, she is my sister after all, but we're short on time on a grander scale <br />
that you'd want to know... I've given you your choice. Do with it as you shall.&quot; The kitesune <br />
vanished in a mass of leafs.</p>
