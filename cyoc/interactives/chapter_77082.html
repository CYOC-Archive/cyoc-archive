<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning, Carl and Wendy woke up as husband and wife for the first time in days. It was such a relief <br />
to Carl, who had risen a half hour before Wendy, that he got up from his slumber in an unusually jovial mood. <br />
Most mornings, he was usually pretty foggy until he had his morning coffee and maybe some cartoon watching <br />
time with Brooke. Brooke. How he missed her. How he was going to miss her exponentially more during the three <br />
months on Big Brother. He really didn't want to do the show, he still thought it was stupid as hell, but it <br />
was penance for being a bad husband in Wendy's eyes. Eating what was left of his doggy bag from last night, he <br />
looked out upon the Las Vegas strip from the balcony, the only people outside being taxi drivers and other <br />
tourists like himself.<br />
<br />
Later on, after Wendy had arisen and filled up on breakfast herself, there was a knock at the door. Wendy <br />
answered it, revealing Steve and Janet who were in their Johnny Helms and Stephanie forms.<br />
<br />
“Can't be too careful” said Steve quietly, sneaking in. “Ready to go everybody? Both of you cash in your <br />
chips?”, he asked. <br />
<br />
“Already did!” answered Wendy gleefully.<br />
<br />
“At least you won a freakin' Ferrari. The only contest I won was a contest meant for hot broads, and I was the <br />
hot broad!” said Carl.<br />
<br />
“You look better now though. You should thank Wendy” smiled Janet. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, I guess so” replied Carl, touching the top of his head, glad to feel thicker hair on his scalp. Not <br />
that he had been going bald, but it had been thinning a little over the years.<br />
<br />
“OK, so let's get going. Check out time is in two hours, right?...<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
All in all, the Las Vegas excursion had been great for everyone. Steve and Janet weren't fighting anymore, <br />
Wendy felt a rekindling of romance with her husband, and the two lovebirds would now be going on a bizarre <br />
three month odyssey into the lower levels of Hollyweird during one of Wendy's favorite TV program's. The night <br />
before, when the two couples had reentered the casino, Steve had encountered a slot machine where the grand <br />
prize was a new Ferrari 458 Spider. On a stroke of daring whimsy, he put some coins into the machine, and <br />
immediately won it. He turned to Janet behind him, who started giggling, cutely shrugging her shoulders in <br />
mystery as to whether she had wished for it to happen. Meanwhile, Wendy and Carl(who had reverted back to <br />
being the blonde eye candy twin sister “Carly”) returned their Big Brother applications over to Jon Adams-<br />
Reilly, who was now a little buzzed, and he in turn returned them over to his assistant Lynne. She herself <br />
then left the casino, clearly a little uncomfortable being around all the decadent behavior. <br />
<br />
“Looks like you two are all set” he said. “Sit down, and I'll pass along a little wisdom from the gods.”<br />
<br />
Jon was closely involved in casting all the big Reality TV shows. Well, the competition based ones anyway. He <br />
had good information to share to Wendy and Carly on what to expect. <br />
<br />
“First, you're going to be taken to a large hotel in Los Angeles. Nice, but not the ritziest place in town <br />
like this hotel is. Once you meet the people from the network, who will establish contact with you both very <br />
soon, they will then sequester the both of you. This means that they will temporarily separate you two from <br />
each other in different rooms, and neither of you will be allowed to talk to one another or come into face to <br />
face contact.”<br />
<br />
“What?” yelled a terse Carly. “I can't talk to my...”, he was about to say 'wife', but he corrected himself in <br />
time, “...sister?”<br />
<br />
“Not until the vetting is over. One at a time, you will undergo a physical, which isn't too bad since it's Big <br />
Brother and not a physically taxing show like The Amazing Race, but a thorough physical nonetheless. Then a <br />
psych test. Then an interview, and that's where things get really personal.”<br />
<br />
“What, are they going to ask what my bra size is?” asked Carly, trying to stay in character.<br />
<br />
“Maybe. It's usually about what you are going to be like on the show and what you'll be willing to do. Since <br />
you're both attractive women, a lot sexual related questions will come up, including the obligatory Will you <br />
flirt or use your body to get ahead? type questions. Standard stuff, really. It does get really personal <br />
though, so fair warning.”<br />
<br />
“Then what do we do?” asked Wendy, holding onto Jon's every word, grinning like a fangirl fantasizing about <br />
joining her favorite band. <br />
<br />
“Once you're done, you'll be analyzed and compared against other people in your Group Type. This means you two <br />
will be ranked against other hot female twins applying for the show. Like I said, I have a lot of clout, and <br />
you two I have a feeling will bring a lot to the table, so I wouldn't get nervous. You two are going to be <br />
fine. While you're waiting for the results to see if you are on the shortlist to go on, you can pretty much go <br />
around the hotel and the surrounding shopping area. The room is on their dime, and so is the room service, but <br />
you have to pay your own way to L.A.”<br />
<br />
“Well...I guess that's OK. Then what?” asked Carly, slightly pissed that all the money Wendy won would have to <br />
be used to fund the flights. And Carl hated airports anyway. Oh boy...<br />
<br />
“After you two are picked, you'll do a little pre-show junk. Just a little...”<br />
<br />
Jon went on to describe everything else that Wendy and Carly would have to do, but I'll save the surprises for <br />
next chapter.</p>
