<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Casper and Ashley walked to her place, talking about their plans to make more rubber anthro animals.  He thought more as they walked, seeing how happy Ashley seemed to be in her new form.  He thought more, curious as to what it would feel like to be a latex anthro animal.  He was a bit worried about losing his manhood and looking like he was sealed in rubber, but he figured that when he took that step, he probably would no longer care.  He was also unsure if he changed himself into a rubber creature, if the ring would still work for him.<br />
<br />
They approached the building where her apartment was located, and they stood out in front of it, both seeming a bit nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose this is goodnight,&quot; Ashley said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose so,&quot; he replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;God, this is so cliche,&quot; the lizard girl said, giggling, &quot;okay, I&#39;m going to be frank, I like you, in fact, I like you a lot.  I&#39;m grateful for what you&#39;ve done for me, and I want to be with you as you continue to help others. I&#39;ve got tomorrow off, so we can play with the ring some more, but I get the feeling that you need some sleep after today&#39;s events.  Call me tomorrow morning?&quot;<br />
<br />
Casper surprised himself as well, replying &quot;I like you a lot too, Ashley. I&#39;ll call you.  In fact, here&#39;s my number.&quot;  He fished the receipt from the restaurant out of his pocket, scribbling his cell number on the back, and carefully scratching out the total on the other side.  He handed the receipt to her, and she took it from his hand, stepping in close and wrapping her arms around his waist.  Casper panicked a bit and froze, until the lizard girl took his arms and pulled them around her body.  He seemed to relax then, just holding her, looking into her purple, slit-pupil eyes.  She smiled, saying, &quot;You&#39;re warm,&quot; as she leaned into him, Casper getting the hint and leaning in as well, his flesh lips meeting her latex ones as the two shared a kiss.<br />
<br />
The moment passed and the two pulled away from one another, both smiling and grinning sheepishly.<br />
<br />
&quot;See you tomorrow?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;See you tomorrow.&quot; Casper promised.<br />
<br />
With that she smiled and turned, walking into the apartment building, leaving Casper to walk back to his place.  He walked back, a slight spring in his step he noted.  He made his way home, walked into his own apartment and promptly fell into bed.  That night his dreams were filled with the possibilities of the ring, and he awoke the next morning in good spirits.  He showered and dressed, then pulled out his cell phone, dialing Ashley&#39;s number as he had promised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning!&quot; she said into the phone, &quot;how did you sleep?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; replied Casper, &quot;though, do Synthetics sleep? Heh, do Synthetics dream of latex sheep?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What, oh.&quot; Ashley&#39;s voice said through the phone, &quot;it was kinda wierd, actually, I didn&#39;t get tired per se, but knew I should rest, so I laid down and kinda zoned out for a few hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting,&quot; he said, &quot;maybe Synthetics need a rest period like humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; she replied, &quot;so, what is on the docket for today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, want to go watch a football practice?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Ashley giggled again, visualizing a whole team of football players being changed into latex anthro animals like herself.  &quot;Sure.&quot; she said, &quot;meet you by the mall?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See you there.&quot; Casper said.<br />
<br />
A short while later, Casper walked up the drive to the community college&#39;s football field.  Ashley was already there waiting for him, as unclothed as she had been the night before, with the exception of a brightly colored silk scarf artfully looped about her neck.  She ran up and hugged him again, leaning in to deliver a quick kiss to his cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like the scarf,&quot; he commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,  though I don&#39;t seem to need to wear clothes, or remember ever wearing clothes, I still like to look pretty.&quot;<br />
<br />
She twined her arm in his and the two of them made their way into the field and up to one of the bleachers.  Looking out over the field, the team was practicing drills on one end of the field, and the cheerleaders were practicing formations at the other end.  Casper looked out and spotted his friends Tommy leading a blocking drill, and Lana working on a human pyramid.  He pointed them out to Ashley.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh,&quot; she said, &quot;you should change them first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Casper thought about this, they were his friends, and everyone that he changed so far had been strangers to him...but, he reasoned everyone was someone&#39;s friend, and Ashley seemed to be happy in her rubber form, so maybe they would be happy too.<br />
<br />
He focused on Lana first, concentrating and thinking of the shape he wanted her to take.  Her change came quickly then, her shoes and socks disappeared, replaced by the shiny black socks of a rubber fox.  Right below her knees, the color changed to a bright red, brighter and redder than natural, her spandex shorts disappearing as her legs were rubberized.  Her cheerleader&#39;s skirt remained, Casper realizing it was a uniform, as did her tank-top emblazoned with the name of the school, but the spandex shirt under it, and her bra he supposed, disappeared and were replaced with more rubber, her arms ending in glistening black like her feet.  Her head changed next, pushing forth into a fox muzzle, taking on the markings of such, as her ears inflated and migrated to the top of her head, now absent of hair.  A nozzle popped into place at her navel, and as her team mates threw her into the air, he could see the barcode on her rear as her skirt flapped in the breeze.  The cheerleaders caught her easily and put her back on her feet, where she finished the cheer and the coach congratulated them on a job well done.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, wow!&quot; Ashley said, watching the transformation wide eyed, &quot;do him next!&quot; She pointed to Tommy, who was lining up at the scrimmage line for another drill.<br />
<br />
Casper turned his attention to the football player, and pushed his will through the ring once more.  This time the change started from his head, as his football helmet shifted and changed, holes opening up on the sides for his white horns and floppy ears that appeared, the face cage elongating as his face pushed into a bovine muzzle.  His pads and jersey did not disappear, only seemed to swell with his bulk as his skin shimmered into a bronze color and inflated beneath them, stretching the already tight fabric further.  His pants also stayed put, but a hole appeared at the back as a long ropy tail snaked out, thrashing back and forth.  His cleats and socks did vanish, replaced by his rubbery legs, which stretched and shifted, until he sported two shiny black hooves, his legs bent to look like he was on his tip-toes.  His bellow of the football play reached Casper and Ashley, his voice seeming to have deepened from the change.<br />
<br />
Ashley stared on in wonder, &quot;I saw them change, right in front of me, but I remember seeing them before today, and they&#39;ve always been this way, always been Synthetics.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You did say you wanted your memories to change just like everyone else&#39;s&quot; he reminded her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; she replied, &quot;Its just...weird feeling.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who shall we change next?&quot; Casper asked the brightly colored lizard sitting next to him.</p>
