<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nick sighed as he looked down at his pants, seeing the bulge in it that was a signal of his male gender. One that in his opinion didn&#39;t really suit him anymore. He wouldn&#39;t admit it outloud, but if there was one thing thing he would have kept from being a Melon girl, it was actually being a girl, especially since his first taste of sex had been on the bottom half, normally reserved for the woman in a relationship.<br />
<br />
&quot;Made up your mind Nicky?&quot; Jesse asked as she opened one eye, Nick shaking his head as he stood up. &quot;I&#39;ll be in my room.&quot; He said as he waled into his room, leaving Jesse alone in the living room. Nick looked at the chronovac as he closed Jesse&#39;s page. No more changes to her for now, just himself. &#39;I could be anything, melon girl, snake girl, spider girl...&#39; Nick thought, noticing all this thought had that linger &#39;girl&#39; at the end. His own brain was dead set on that, no matter what he became, it would be a girl.<br />
<br />
&#39;Why not a fairy?&#39; Nick thought, thinking about the tiny little people that fairies were. Heck, he could probably live in Jesse&#39;s hair if he wanted to as a fairy. &quot;Fairy it is.&quot; Nick muttered to himself as he stopped for a moment. Did he want to be aware that he was a human as a fairy? He could turn off awareness for both him and Jesse and they could live a relatively normal life. He wouldn&#39;t even be aware of the transformation as it happened.<br />
<br />
Weighing his options he sighed as he turned around and went for the door to talk to Jesse. &quot;Hey Jesse?&quot; Nick called as Jesse one an eye. &quot;Yeah Nicky?&quot; Jesse asked as Nick stepped out of his room. &quot;I know what I want to become... but.&quot; Nick said as he tapped his fingers. &quot;What is it?&quot; Jesse asked as Nick took a deep breath before staying it. &quot;I don&#39;t want us to be aware that I had changed.&quot; Nick said quickly as Jesse blinked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t want us to be aware? What is it?&quot; Jesse asked as Nick tapped his fingers. &quot;A fairy...&quot; he admitted embarrassingly. &quot;So you want us to just have a normal life as a melon girl and a fairy, without the burden of knowing what you really are?&quot; Jesse asked as Nick nodded. <br />
<br />
Jesse smiled as she stood up, walking up to Nick and hugging him. &quot;It&#39;s your choice Nick, if you want us to live as a girl and her fairy companion, go right ahead.&quot; Jesse said with a wild smirk as Nick smiled back at her. &quot;Thanks Jesse.&quot; Nick said as he got away from the hug. &quot;I&#39;ll be right here for you Nick.&quot; Jesse said, giving him a thumbs up as Nick gave one back before going into his room.<br />
<br />
Going up to the chronovac Nick started to put the changes in, even making it so that he would have a fairy-ish name once the change was complete, setting the timer for a ten minute change he came to the final option. &quot;Awareness.&quot; Nick mouthed as he closed his eyes and sighed... before turning it off. Neither him or Jesse would know what he used to be. Just as he hit enter a warning popped up. &quot;WARNING! Completing this change without anyone aware will set change to subject&#39;s new default state? Continue?&quot; The warning said as Nick smiled and clicked yes before walking out of the room, remembering the chronovac... but not what he had just done.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jesse.&quot; Nick said with a smile as Jesse smiled at him. &quot;You good now Nick?&quot; Jesse asked as Nick nodded, neither of them noticing as Nick slowly started getting shorter, his hair extending slowly and changing color to a light blue hue. &quot;So Nick, what do you want to do?&quot; Jesse asked as Nick shrugged, already he was at chest height with Jesse, and still get smaller, even thought neither noticed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well short stuff, how about we watch a movie?&quot; Jesse said with a smile as Nick smiled, his figure now completely feminine and cute, his eyes getting larger until they took up almost all of his face before turning green, his nose and mouth shrinking as his ears became pointed, his hair growing all the way to his butt. And by now he was below Jesse&#39;s breasts.<br />
<br />
As they walked over to the couch to watch a movie Nick&#39;s clothes started shifting, under his pants his gender gone as she sat next to Jesse on the couch, Jesse relaxing as she grabbed the remote and started looking for a movie for them. &quot;Sure you can see it Whisper?&quot; Jesse asked, giving her nickname for the new fairy, even though she wasn&#39;t fully a fairy yet. &quot;Whisper Dust, get it right Jesse.&quot; Whisper said as Jesse frowned. &quot;If I used your full name people could control you Wisp&quot; Jesse said as a pair of wings burst out of Whisper&#39;s back, but at this point she was only about as tall as Jesse&#39;s thigh. &quot;I know, but it comforts me to hear it from you partner.&quot; Whisper said as her clothes finished changing into a dress with holes in the back for her wings. In Jesse&#39;s vine and leaf hair a small room was forming within the wild tangles where Whisper would soon live.<br />
<br />
&quot;You going to watch from down there or from up top Wisp?&quot; Jesse asked as Whisper finished shrinking, now only about the size of  Jesse&#39;s palm, which she could probably fit in comfortably. &quot;Up top.&quot; Wisp said, beating her wings as she flew up to Jesse&#39;s hair, her changes finishing as a pair of tiny c-cups sprouted from her chest. She flew into Jesse&#39;s wild tangles, navigating them expertly into her room in Jesse&#39;s &#39;hair&#39; smiling as she flew out the top and sat on top of Jesse&#39;s vine and leaf hair as the movie started.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jesse.&quot; Whisper said as Jesse went &quot;hmm?&quot;. &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re my partner.&quot; Whisper said as Jesse chuckled. &quot;Me to Wisp, me to.&quot; Jesse said with a smile as the two of them watched their movie, life for them good as it was now.</p>
