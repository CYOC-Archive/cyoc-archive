<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You ask lucifer about the door with caution tape on it, &quot;that&#39;s where the prisoners were being held, its cautioned off due to pending construction to enlarge the room&quot; you then look through the window and see the room where all the events from yesterday took place. You then think of Kent and how you wish you could have saved him from his fate, some hero of the prophecy you turned out to be. You then turn away from the door with tears beginning to well up, man you never thought being a woman would make you so emotional. You then decide to explore the Male training room. Once inside you see a table with sheets and a pillow on it &quot;this is where the Males are turned into succubus&#39;s&quot; Lucifer explains. Out of the corner of your eyes you spot something on the walls and walk over to get a closer look.<br />
<br />
You see pumps of varying sizes littering the wall, one that&#39;s verry large and looks big enough to fit a cantaloupe, one that is fairly narrow and looks like it could fit some sort of pole shaped object, and finally you see one that has a awkward looking shape. You eye Lucifer questioningly and he begins to explain &quot;as I mentioned earlier our previously male succubus&#39;s are much more fertal than the others and much weaker as well, so in order to help them reproduce I made this machine. The large pumps are used to farm breast milk from them, the strangely shaped looking one is meant to suck cum out of their vagina and the long one is rarely used but should the need arise I can use my transformative magic to restore a pre male succubus&#39;s cock so that we can also farm ejaculate from them in order to impregnate a succubus.<br />
<br />
You look at Lucifer in shock and ask &quot;why would you ever need to do that? Aren&#39;t succubus&#39;s immortal?&quot; Lucifer then looks to you and shakes his head &quot;normally yes but only if they remain in hell&quot; he explains &quot;once a succubus crosses over to the real world they age and can die just like any other human, albeit they are much stronger than a average human but if overwhelmed by numbers they can be terminated. This is usually rectified by turning humans into succubus&#39;s however if we can&#39;t do that&quot; he then eyes the cautioned off door &quot;we have to resort to other methods&quot; he explains. You then get even more curious &quot;so, what&#39;s the procedure for impregnating a succubus and why don&#39;t you just give them the means to make a baby and let them do it naturally?&quot; You ask.<br />
<br />
Lucifer sighs at this and says &quot;because it&#39;s more efficient&quot; he explains &quot;if I did let succubus&#39;s get pregnant naturally by having sex then they would not be available to do their jobs and sending a succubus to the doctors office to be impregnated so they can get back to their duties is far more efficient&quot; he explains. &quot;Once they do start showing signs of pregnancy they are then given a leave of absence so that they can give birth to their child and nurture it into either a fighter or a tower attendant&quot; he looks over at you and the face of pure shock you are showing entices a response from him &quot;there is no need to worry, once a succubus does go into labor it does not take them as long to give birth, unlike humans when a succubus get&#39;s pregnant they are ready to deliver the child merely a month later and once the child is born it only takes another five months for that child to reach maturity. succubus&#39;s also learn various things like life skills and how to talk naturally making teaching them fairly effortless.&quot;<br />
<br />
You stare at Lucifer in awe at all he is telling you, you then speak up and ask &quot;so succubus&#39;s can&#39;t have families?&quot; and lucifer looks over at you and shakes his head &quot;we are essentially one verry large family and most the time succubus&#39;s are too busy to be living out normal lives and when they do have free time the only thing they ever think about is sex and being pleasured.&quot; You then ask &quot;well if they can&#39;t have sex then how do they satisfy that urge?&quot; You ask confused &quot;they usually use the pumps that their rooms are fitted with, these pumps are more of a means of training them how to use them. They also have various sex objects in their rooms that can also help them relieve any sexual tension, and if they do get the desire to have sex with each other then they can by all means do that in their free time.&quot;<br />
<br />
You then look over your body and scratch your head, you then look back up at Lucifer and ask &quot;well then how come I don&#39;t get those urges?&quot; Lucifer giggles slightly at that and says &quot;it&#39;s simple really, all of my other children were transformed by greater succubus&#39;s and therefore became lesser succubus&#39;s and lack any self control. You on the other hand were transformed by me and are a greater succubus with far more willpower than your siblings.&quot; You blush at that and ask &quot;well then how were the greater succubus&#39;s made?&quot; and he eyes you with a sarcastic look in his eyes. He says &quot;isn&#39;t it obvious? I made them&quot; he states plainly &quot;but most the other greater succubus&#39;s remain in the underworld to run things for me while i am away. You on the other hand get to be up here with me because you are my lover.&quot; You then blush at that remark too.<br />
<br />
&quot;So if all succubus&#39;s are your children then does that make you my dad?&quot; you ask him and he laughs again only much louder this time &quot;yes it is true that all succubus&#39;s I create or are created by my creations are my children however when I made my first batch of greater succubus&#39;s I was in the underworld where my powers were limitless. However up here they aren&#39;t as powerful therefore in order to use them I need a catalyst, for example in order to make a creature such as a succubus up here I need a body to transform. I can&#39;t make one appear out of nowhere like I can in hell&quot; he explains. &quot;Also that means that anyone who used to be human that is transformed is not my child initially unless I make it so by transforming their soul and identity along with their body. In your case all I transformed was your body and I left your soul, personality, and memories in tact. This means that you are not my child but rather just a extension of myself&quot;<br />
<br />
Your eyes then go wide and ask &quot;does that mean I can perform magic like you?&quot; and lucifer laughs &quot;yes you can perform magic but it&#39;s not as strong as mine obviously and since you are my creation that means you can&#39;t use any of it against me if you were thinking of dethroning me that way.&quot; &quot;Dang&quot; you think to yourself &quot;he thought of everything&quot;, You then yawn as most the day has gone by at this point and Lucifer checks his watch &quot;oh damn, it&#39;s that late already?&quot; Lucifer then runs to the exit and you ask him where he is going and he just shouts &quot;got business to attend to!&quot; and just like that he&#39;s gone. You decide to leave the training rooms and explore the mansion a bit, from the sounds of booming yelling coming from upstairs you assume that Lucifer is up there taking care of some business. You then decide to go to your room and look around a bit more.<br />
<br />
Once inside you see a bookshelf in one corner of the room, being a lover of books when you were a man you decide to go see what he has. Most of the books look normal and most are items you have read before except for a few outliers which are...</p>
