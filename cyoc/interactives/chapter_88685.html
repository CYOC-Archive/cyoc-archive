<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Missy was a bit surprised at this but decided it made sense, punishments would be regression and rewards would be progression.<br />
&quot;Okay then Abby, everytime your good I&#39;ll make you three years older okay&quot; said Missy. Abby nodded, clearly ready for the change.<br />
Missy made a mental wish to make Abby seven years old and the changes started straight away, she grew about five inches making her four foot, most of her baby fat disappeared leaving her quite skinny and her hair got darker becoming a dark red.<br />
Abby looked herself over and giggled, she was obviously pleased with the change.<br />
&quot;Abby if you&#39;re good again I&#39;ll make you older again okay, then you&#39;ll  be ten and the older sister.&quot; Missy told Abby. This made Abby smile, &quot;you must be tired from all that running around though, come on nap time.&quot; As Abby ran up the stairs Missy made some changes to her things, she made her clothes fit her and all her belongings suit her slightly older self.<br />
Missy went upstairs to find James, he had just finished in the shower. Missy helped dry him and change into his pyjamas as he was also having a nap, but he would be wearing a pull up.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry if you don&#39;t like it James but I don&#39;t want you wetting the bed okay, you need to learn your lesson.&quot; Missy said comfortingly, James just nodded. One thing Missy had noticed since she had regressed James was that he was no longer staring at her breasts, his mind was changing, slowly.<br />
<br />
Abby woke up after about an hour and went downstairs to watch tv but James didn&#39;t wake up until 7am the next day. He woke up with a start to a horrible smell. He threw his covers away to find he had not only wet his pull-up he had soiled it as well. Missy came into the room half an hour later, to find a four year old James lying in his bed crying softly.<br />
&quot;James sweetie, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Missy asked while stroking his leg softly.<br />
&quot;I pood my pull-up, I want mommy.&quot; He replied crying, he clearly hadn&#39;t noticed he was only four years old now.<br />
&quot;You wet your pull-up, that&#39;s okay James. But mommy won&#39;t be here for another two days&quot;.<br />
&quot;No, I want her now.&quot; <br />
It was at this point Missy had had it with James, his mother clearly hadn&#39;t raised him right. He needed a fresh start. Missy made a wish that she was James&#39; mother. Her breasts got another size bigger becoming a 39 PPP. But the most drastic changes were too James, his features changed to look like Missy&#39;s and he got a bit taller.<br />
&quot;Mommy&#39;s right here James&quot; she said and hugged him tightly, smothering his face into her now bigger breasts. Missy changed him but put him in a diaper this time. He refused at first but then he allowed it, they went downstairs to get breakfast to find Abby was already there but she looked very different to the last time James had seen her. <br />
First of all she looks to be at least sixteen and a lot taller for it, her figure was nothing to be desired she looked to be 32 A and really skinny, her face was very plain as she now required glasses and her hair that was now a very rich red colour was cut very boyishly. James was shocked it was clearly Abby but she was older now and he hated it. He stormed off up the stairs and into the nursery Missy followed him chasing after him up the stairs. He sat down in the nursery next to where Sarah was. Missy arrived in a second later, she sat down next to James and asked if he wanted any breakfast, he said he did. A minute later Missy returned with a bowl of cereal but there was no milk.<br />
&quot;Can I have some milk please&quot; asked James.<br />
&quot;Of course you can sweetie.&quot; Was Missy&#39;s only reply as she pulled down her dress to reveal her breasts, she pulled James towards her and sat him on her lap. Now sat on a rocking chair breastfeeding James she wished that when she was finished feeding je would regress to be Bobby&#39;s twin, this was the only way that he would get a true fresh start.<br />
Missy played with all four of her children for another hour and then put them down to bed. She went downstairs a minute later to find Abby there crying.<br />
&quot;Woah Abby, what&#39;s wrong sweetie&quot; she said as she hugged her.<br />
&quot;I was walking down to the store and there were these girls there, I didn&#39;t know any of them but they made fun of me, they called me ugly and flat chested&quot; she said through bouts of tears. &quot; I want to be like you Missy, you&#39;re the best person I know, you have big boobs, your really sexy, your an amazing parent and an amazing friend.&quot;<br />
&quot;You know what Abby I&#39;ve got a surprise for you. Follow me.&quot; <br />
They went into the basement and  locked the door. Missy told Abby to stand in the middle of the basement.<br />
&quot;Abby you&#39;re going to think I&#39;m crazy but this ring I have here, can grant wishes. That&#39;s how I made you older.&quot; Abby looked sceptical but played along &quot;so lets make you like me, I wish that your tits would grow to a 38KKK&quot;. Abby almost laughed but that was when she felt a warm sensation in her small breasts, it was done in about a minute Abby&#39;s breasts straight up burst through her hoodie, Breaking the zip.<br />
&quot;I wish that Abby had an ass to match her tits&quot; Abby didn&#39;t laugh this time she just stared at her ass and watched it grow. It ripped through her jeans it was that large.<br />
&quot;I wish that no one would remember the old Abby except for me and her&quot; all that happened this time was a spark of light went off which made all of Missy&#39;s children cry. Missy ran to comfort them and Abby ran after her both of them having to hold their breasts down as not to give them black eyes. Missy ran into the nursery and started to comfort both Bobby and James whilst Abby comforted Sarah and Thomas, Missy took off her sweater and undid her bra. She then began to feed both Bobby and James at once. But Sarah and Thomas were still crying.<br />
I wish Abby would breastfeed Thomas and Sarah so they&#39;ll stop crying. Abby did just that revealing her breasts and  feeding both Sarah and Thomas at the same time, one on each breast. After they had finished it appeared Abby&#39;s breasts had gotten bigger too compensate for the milk. They put the children back down to sleep and went downstairs, then the doorbell rang, Missy opened the door, it was Jade.</p>
