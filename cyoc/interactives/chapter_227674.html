<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gloria watched Dave hesitate, taking some time to think about Lesley’s question.  After a moment, he gestured towards Jessica.  “Let’s keep going in order, so Jessica can take her turn next.”  He paused while Jessica stepped forward to stand next to Lesley. “And I’ll go with the level two risk factor this time.”<br />
<br />
Jessica seemed to break free of her trance for a moment at the mention of risk.  “Um, Dad, I’m not sure I’m OK with that.”<br />
<br />
Jessica started to pull away, but Lesley waved her crystal in front of Jessica’s face, hypnotizing the teen once more.<br />
<br />
“No more chatting, Jessica, it’s time to send you to your womb.”  Lesley said, taking her hand and pulling her across the stage towards Rose.  As they walked, the audience saw the teen’s clothing loosen as her body regressed backwards through puberty, before it fell off completely, tripping the girl.  Lesley reached down into the pile of clothes and pulled out an infant, who squirmed in her arms as Lesley carried her over to Rose’s hospital bed.<br />
<br />
Rose already had her feet in the stirrups and was panting as though she was in labor, and a moment after Lesley placed Jessica between her mother’s legs, the girl disappeared back into the womb she’d come from, leaving a young Rose pregnant once more.  This time, she looked even younger than when she’d had Kevin, and she grew younger still as her pregnancy melted away.<br />
<br />
As Rose began to moan with pleasure, a stage hand stepped forward with a jar, but Lesley waived them back, and pulled out the towel she’d used to wipe off Kevin’s jar instead.  <br />
<br />
“Since her dad’s opted to restart her with a new sperm sample, we’re just going to let this soak up her original set of swimmers.”  Lesley said, pressing the towel against Rose’s crotch as the mother bucked her hips and moaned in orgasm.  A moment later, Lesley pulled the towel away and held it up to the audience, showing a large damp spot at the center of the towel.  “And since we won’t need them anymore, one of you can keep this.”  She said, then tossed the towel into the audience, and a woman next to Gloria caught it, looking excited to have the souvenir.<br />
<br />
“Now, it’s time to get that new sample from Dave.  How do you want to handle this?’<br />
<br />
To Gloria’s surprise, Rose answered before Dave could.  “He’s going to come over here and let me ride him until I’m good and knocked up.  It’s the least he can do to make up for putting me through labor this many times.”<br />
<br />
Lesley smirked, then turned back to the audience.  “Well, I guess this is about to become an R-rated show.  Parents, you might want to take your kids somewhere else while this happens.”<br />
<br />
No one in the audience moved as Dave came over to join Rose on the hospital bed.  Lesley and her assistants moved to block the view of exactly what was happening as Rose climbed atop him, but Gloria still could see Rose’s head and shoulders as she rocked back and forth, clearly enjoying herself.  Rose came twice before she seemed satisfied, and when Lesley moved out of the way, Gloria saw Rose’s belly already beginning to swell with pregnancy.  One of the assistants led an exhausted-looking Dave to a nearby chair as Rose’s pregnancy progressed.<br />
<br />
“Now, let’s see what sort of luck Jessica had this time around.”  Lesley said, watching Rose’s belly expand.  Gloria wasn’t sure, but she thought it looked even bigger than it had right after Jessica’s unbirth.  And it got even bigger than that before Rose went into labor once more, birthing a baby into Lesley’s arms. <br />
<br />
“Welcome back, Jessica.”  Lesley began, but was interrupted by another moan from Rose.  An assistant quickly stepped over to comfort her, and stopped, staring in surprise.<br />
<br />
“Um, Lesley, there’s another baby coming.”<br />
<br />
Lesley looked startled too, but quickly recovered her composure as she reached down to catch the second baby.  This time, she waited another minute for Rose’s labor to fully end before holding both babies out where the audience could see them.<br />
<br />
“Well, talk about lucky!  It looks like Jessica’s embryo split this time around, giving us a pair of identical twins.”  Lesley said as the two babies began to grow, growing into a pair of toddlers in identical outfits, but with one green and the other dark blue.  <br />
<br />
As they aged, those outfits changed, but the color scheme stayed the same, and was the only way to tell the two apart.  Finally, Lesley was standing next to two identical redheaded teens, who waved in unison at the audience.  They were both shorter than Jessica had been, and took after their mother’s looks even more than Jessica had.<br />
<br />
“Introduce yourselves to the good people here, girls.”  Lesley said.<br />
<br />
“I’m Jess, and I’m going to be class President this year.”  Said the one in blue.<br />
<br />
“I’m Cassandra, and Jess means that we’ll be class President.  If she wins, I’m wearing her clothes every other day, just to see how many people I can get to listen to me instead.”  Said the one in green, prompting a glare from Jess, before they both burst into giggles.<br />
Lesley turned to Dave, who still looked half-asleep from remaking his daughter.  “Well, you’ve traded an artist for a pair of mischievous politicians-to-be.  But I can’t call a two-for-one trade anything other than a win, so you’re getting an even bigger reward this time.  When you leave, you’ll find that your personal finances have improved dramatically, enough to cover an extra child, and properly fund these girls’ future political ambitions.”<br />
<br />
Dave looked up and gave Lesley a thumbs-up.<br />
<br />
“Now, it’s time to decide whether to push your luck even further.  There are still prizes to be won, but with this unexpected addition to your family, any more spins of the wheel come with an extra three levels of risk.”<br />
<br />
“What?  Why?”  Dave asked.<br />
<br />
“Because the rules of Rebirth Roulette only guarantee that you won’t leave with fewer family members than you started with.  Since you started with three children, and Rose has rebirthed three babies, any further pregnancies have the usual odds of something going wrong partway through.”  Lesley answered.  “So, with that in mind, do you still want to send Terri on a spin of the Rebirth Roulette wheel?”<br />
<br />
“Well…  If the prizes are good enough…”  Dave trailed off as Rose interrupted him.  <br />
<br />
“I think Dave’s made enough decisions for our family today.  Let him rest, this one’s my call.”<br />
<br />
Lesley turned to face Rose.  “That’s fair.  So, are you going to roll the dice with Terri, or take your winnings and go home?”<br />
Rose looked thoughtful, then a mischievous expression crossed her face.  “Is Terri the only one left to spin the Rebirth Roulette wheel, or can I send my husband on it too?”<br />
<br />
That broke through Dave’s fog of exhaustion enough to make him stand up, looking shocked.  “You can’t possibly want to do that, Rose!”  He exclaimed, before Lesley waved her crystal in his face, sending him deeper into a trance.<br />
<br />
“Your choices made me go through labor four times, once with twins!  And you were seriously thinking about adding another two rounds?  I’m absolutely tempted to send you on that ride instead of Terri!”<br />
<br />
Lesley smiled.  “Well, in that case, yes, he’s also an option.  You get to leave the stage with at least three kids and a spouse, but none of them have to be exactly the same as when they started out.  But you will still have to be the one to provide the womb for any family members you send on a round of Rebirth Roulette.”<br />
<br />
Rose sighed.  “That does put a damper on the idea, I was hoping someone else could carry him.  Still, maybe it’s worth one more pregnancy…”  She paused to think for a moment longer.  “OK, I’ve made my decision.”</p>
