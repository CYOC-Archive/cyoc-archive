<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For years, I had worked for someone I met online. A very attractive woman with large chest and big butt, always wearing the skimpiest of clothing, by the name of Elaine. Needless to say I had grown attracted to her, and I was certain she felt the same way. We tended to meet up in person many a time to discuss projects upcoming; working with effective marketing to make the most profit. Unfortunately, she become aware of my attraction to her, against my will. She wasn&#39;t spoken for, remaining single due to work reasons, so she immediately made sure that it was known we were just friends. Broken up inside, I resigned my lust so as to avoid any allegations and the like, so I agreed. It seemed the mature thing to do and I  was certain I&#39;d eventually grow past this. Except I didn&#39;t, though it wasn&#39;t my fault in the slightest.<br />
<br />
After another in person meet up with Elaine, something happened whereupon all track of time after that was lost. Sensations were dulled and I became unconscious. Unsure of how long I was out, eventually I was brought back to consciousness in a strange location. &quot;Ah, he&#39;s finally awake!&quot; I heard a boisterous male voice say. Unfamiliar with this person, I aimed to stand up to greet them; except, I found I couldn&#39;t move. Grunting, I realized I was strapped to some very large operating table, positioned vertically so that I was upright. &quot;What is this?&quot; I asked, shocked as I looked across from me.<br />
<br />
There, in a similar predicament, was the sexy Elaine. Clad in the loose blue t-shirt and short black skirt she wore when we met earlier, I noticed her eyes sobbing as she struggled a lot. With tape over her mouth, all I could hear were muffled sounds and moans as she stared into my eyes. Looking down, I found she was barefoot, with her toes wiggling and clenching. &quot;Glad you&#39;re awake,&quot; The male voice from before stated. &quot;Allow us to introduce ourselves.&quot; Stepping from around my table was a suavely dressed businessman, with hands clasped in front of him and a bright smile on his face. &quot;This is my company, Bond Corp. Our goal is to rebuild broken relationships with friends and family. And you two fit that bill perfectly.&quot; He explained, though I saw Elaine shaking her head frantically from over his shoulder. &quot;Consider it therapy, only very literal and very permanent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I inquired, hoping maybe he&#39;d just let us go if I didn&#39;t enrage him. The man continued, &quot;You two have some professionality issues between you, yes? You having feelings for her, though unreciprocated. We are going to remove the awkwardness that must&#39;ve caused and help you two act as a single unit at work again.&quot; Snapping his fingers, the man gestured to some associates to step from behind Elaine&#39;s table and lift up her skirt. Upon this, I can see she is commando, and a large vibrating dildo is working magic inside her pussy. &quot;As you can see, we are helping condition her body to liking the thought of you being in control.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was speechless and had a puzzled look, indicating the man needed to explain further. Nodding, he continued, &quot;Simple, we are going to transplant your head onto her body, solving the lust issues and awkward issues. Complete with her voice, face, and hair, you will live out your life together.&quot; To Elaine&#39;s horror, this elicited a smile from me. Being able to always touch the woman I love, dressing her body as sexily as I wanted; it sounded heaven to me. Elaine must&#39;ve felt differently; having some creep in control and violating her sexy body. Walking around in public wearing her face and speaking with her voice, it was the stuff of nightmares. But she had no say here.<br />
<br />
With some strange science, a surgical blade goes from her chin up and around to the back of her head. Surprisingly, her face and hair were connected in a sort of full head mask style. What remained on her body was a featureless head, spazzing and shaking; except the same process then happened to me. In an instant, most of my senses were gone; sight, taste, sound. It felt like I was holding my breath, but like I could do so indefinitely; and then it all came back to me. Opening my new eyes, I caught sight of long, silky brown hair flow past my gaze. Releasing a higher toned moan, I licked my new thicker lips and turned my head to twirl my new hair around.<br />
<br />
One of Bond Corps&#39; doctors stopped my head to put a mirror in front of me, where I giggled with joy. I assume that when they removed my features, my head was a blank slate as well. One which they simply slipped Elaine&#39;s features on to. With the seams fused to my skin, my head was undoubtedly Elaine&#39;s, with a softer jawline and smooth skin. I wouldn&#39;t mind just this alone, but there was more in store for me. Feeling a warmth right under my new head, I realized I was being lifted higher into the air. Or rather, just my head was; leaving my body strapped to the table, my new Elaine head faced her body as a doctor carried me over to it. <br />
<br />
After removing Elaine&#39;s twitching featureless head, they turned me forward, before lowering me onto my new body. Sensations of a female body hit me all at once. The jiggling assets, erogenous zones rubbing against my clothes, softer more sensitive skin, and finally the vibrator buzzing away in my new cunt. Unleashing a loud, yet proud moan, I relished being able to hear Elaine&#39;s voice make such a noise; especially since I&#39;ll be hearing her make plenty more in the future. Clenching my new dainty toes, my new pussy releases fluids from my first female orgasm. Getting it onto the clean floor of this facility, the Bond Corp workers seemed to not mind the mess. That didn&#39;t stop me as I arched my new back and came many more times from the vibrator. It was a weird feeling, like I was actually cumming twice at the same time.<br />
<br />
Thankfully the Bond Corp suit guy was there to give some insight. &quot;Thanks to our conditioning, you&#39;ll find her body loving having you attached and in control of it. Think of it as you&#39;ll always be horny just by existing, now, let&#39;s get you two out of here.&quot; With a wave of his fingers, the vibrator was removed from my tight, dripping snatch as Elaine&#39;s flip flops were slipped onto my new smaller feet. Still in the euphoria of being a woman, and now having Elaine&#39;s body all to myself from now on, I blacked out with my last memory of this being unstrapped from the table.<br />
<br />
Upon awaking, I quickly sat up to think about that wonderful dream I had. Shoving my bedsheet to the floor, I turned toward the full body mirror across my bedroom. And in my reflection, I saw Elaine staring back at me. &quot;Oh my god, it was real?!&quot; I ask, hearing her voice leave my mouth. Smiling, I removed my top and bottoms to see my nude self. Feeling the sweat dripping down my soft, tan skin, I spread my shapely legs to reveal Elaine&#39;s hairless cunt leaking fluids onto my bed. Feeling my new heart beating fast, I gripped the bed sheet on the floor with my dainty toes. Lowering a manicured hand down between my legs, I inserted it into my lusty pussy. Shoving my fingers in and out, I used my other hand to grope and tweak my new E cup tits, getting more ecstasy from that. Moaning like a beast in heat, I spew fluids onto my thick thighs, as my inner walls tighten around my fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Elaine,&quot; I say in the afterglow. &quot;We&#39;re going to have so much fun together from now on.&quot; As if in response, Elaine&#39;s body gets horny once again, so I get to work fingering myself once again. Mindlessly glancing to my open closet, I learn I now have Elaine&#39;s enter wardrobe as well. Dressing my new, slutty body like a stripper, or in bikinis, was a sexy thought, and I moved even faster. Cumming again and again, I was in peace and complete happiness. &quot;I&#39;m going to love being this way forever...&quot; I say, before drifting back to sleep</p>
