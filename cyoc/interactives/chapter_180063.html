<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before long, Alex came to. He rubbed his head and groaned as he once again realized what happened. His whole life was constructed by some lame computer program. However that was possible, Alex didn&#39;t like it. Not at all. He never, ever wanted to return to being some twig of a boy. He was strong, he was growing into muscles, and he was sure he was going to be a hunk in just two years or so depending on his workout progress. At least, as far as his ego was concerned.<br />
<br />
Ben tried to give him consolation, &quot;Dude, it&#39;ll only reverse as of right now if someone does something to reverse it. You&#39;re set for life at the rate you&#39;re going.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really!? So I&#39;m...I&#39;m not just gonna revert into some twig!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, so you...kinda fainted over nothing.&quot; Ben responded, already blase about what happened.<br />
<br />
But Alex was not quite so over it, even though he nodded along and crossed his arms in front of his chest. He had to find a way to make his changes permanent. He had a path for a lot of success in life set up in front of him now. He was not about to let anything get in the way. Call it shortsighted, but Alex was a teen. And he was not keen on something like this sidetracking him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Idea.&quot; Alex started, looking at his Chronivac page, &quot;Gimme twenty pounds more of muscle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-You sure, man? I-I mean, you&#39;re already pretty buff for your age. And I&#39;m not sure how wise it&#39;d be to use this kinda thing on us. I mean, what if some kind of ulterior change or necessary change happens as a result---&quot; Ben responded, wondering where in all this would go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I&#39;m sure! Just give me more muscle!&quot; Alex flexed for effect and then sat back.<br />
<br />
Ben grumbled a bit and went ahead, altering Alex&#39;s file. He noted that the machine was showing some &quot;slight necessary alterations&quot;, but Ben figured as long as they were slight, Alex would not mind. He got the change started, and sat back. Watching his friend shift position and wait eagerly for the results of his desired change. Alex murmured, &quot;You sure you started my growth? Cuz I don&#39;t---oooh...&quot;<br />
<br />
He was distracted by a sudden tingling sensation. It was not so bad as it was alien and unusual. And while not unpleasant at all, it was strange enough Alex hoped it would pass soon. &quot;Ahh...Ah!&quot; Alex gasped as he felt his already rounded little shoulders bulge out a bit more still, felt his pecs press against his shirt, followed by his abs pushing out more, oddly enough. He could feel his biceps making more of an impression along with his triceps. The material on his shirt getting stretched tighter. He kicked with his leg and watched his quadricep muscle grow stronger and larger. &quot;Ohh yeah baby!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex flexed...and heard a few fabric lines in his shirt give. He looked himself over. He had to be the most ripped guy in the whole middle school now. But something was weird about his abs. They reminded him a little of those bodybuilder guys he occasionally saw on Instagram. &quot;Well, all&#39;s well that ends well.&quot; Alex said with a smirk. &quot;Let&#39;s see if we can do anything else with anyone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben looked at Jake&#39;s file first, and as Alex walked over, he started to get a few mischievous ideas as he looked at the names and connections associated with Jake. A grin settled over Alex&#39;s face, &quot;I got an idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Big bro Jake has a rivalry with this dude from school named Ethan Carmody...&quot; He pointed at Ethan&#39;s file. Pulling it up, they saw a tall, very muscular figure. Light blond hair, mischievous blue eyes, a devastatingly handsome face, almost ten lbs heavier than even Jake, Ethan was known around school as both a powerful football player and as something of a prankster. He&#39;d been the class clown well before he got into working out to become this spectacular specimen of jock masculinity. &quot;How about we end the rivalry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How are we doing that?&quot; Ben asked.<br />
<br />
Alex leaned forward and said, &quot;Set up a change to take place over a week. Ethan Carmody the jock becomes Ethan Carmody the new teacher. Once fully changed, he&#39;ll be 65 years old. Consolation prize, he used to be a bodybuilder, and still keeps fit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben was a little worried until Alex mentioned the consolation prize - as he would&#39;ve thought turning Ethan old and weak outta nowhere would be kind of mean. But if he had such a vibrant background in fitness... &quot;Alright, I&#39;ll do it. Gonna set the change to take place over a week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, next target,&quot; Alex said as he cracked his knuckles. He thought about people from his own life, and almost jumped with the inspiration when it hit him, &quot;Mr. Bardwerth!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The old PE Teacher?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!&quot; Everyone knew Dustin Bardwerth. The bulky, ~50 year old PE teacher was a fearsome force around the middle school. He apparently used to be a powerfully muscled jock before an injury in college football put him out of the circuit. And he&#39;d never really been very happy since. He trained the kids brutally and without allowing much rest time. His balding haircut, remaining lantern jawed good looks, and powerfully built if slightly obese physique all contributed to an air of fear around him. On top of everything else, he was known for quite a few problematic statements and pretty...dated personal opinions.<br />
<br />
Alex cupped his chin, &quot;Let&#39;s turn mean old Bardwerth into an 18 year old uhh, &quot;twink&quot;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So we&#39;re turning the grouchy homophobe into---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A form where he&#39;s gonna learn some empathy.&quot; Alex admitted, he wasn&#39;t really doing this due to the teacher&#39;s more bigoted opinions. He was more doing it to get back at him for all the mile runs and shouting. But he figured it&#39;d do well enough. And it&#39;d require a new teacher at any rate, so they&#39;d have someone who wasn&#39;t a fucking lunatic.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...think that&#39;s it. Week long changes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know it.&quot; And with that, Ben started the changes on Dustin Bardwerth. They now had two separate timers ticking down. Alex was honestly kind of excited to see the changes take place. He had plans to swing by the high school big bro went to in order to &quot;learn from the high school players&quot; just so he could observe Ethan&#39;s changes as they happened. But he didn&#39;t know really which he looked forward to more.<br />
<br />
The mean teacher or the high school rival of his big brother...</p>
