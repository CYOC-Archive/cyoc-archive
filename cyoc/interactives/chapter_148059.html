<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Friction. Warmth. Slick. Hands. Giant hands squeezing him against Richard. Playing with his sack, with his dickhead. Pumping them both like rubbers. He wouldn&#39;t last. Not for much longer!<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to... to... CUM!&quot; <br />
<br />
Gerald&#39;s sight blanked out as pleasure erupted at the front of his mind. Strings of cum flew out of his mouth, coating him and Richard both, and seconds later, he felt Richard&#39;s own discharge splatter over his body. <br />
<br />
Being a cock was absolutely mindblowing. So many people would pay to experience even a fraction of this pleasure. If only they could crack the code of Hugo&#39;s tech...<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, Gerald managed to get his panting back to normal. &quot;Fuck, Dick, that was a callback to our teenage glory. I haven&#39;t been able to have this much consecutive sex in years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard laughed. &quot;Maybe YOU haven&#39;t, but I&#39;ve always remained sexually god-like.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald snorted and spat the last remaining drizzling remnants of his last orgasm. &quot;Oh, shut up, Dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard seemed to shrug, despite the lack of shoulders, or limbs, or face. It was amazing how expression a cock could seem when you were one yourself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Becoming your own penis was the right decision, Gerald. It&#39;s helped you shed some of your bad side.&quot;<br />
<br />
It probably didn&#39;t mean much. Richard&#39;s secretary picked Richard up a few seconds later and reattached him to his crotch. Gerald had no intention of doing the same. It was one thing to become your penis, it was another to become someone else&#39;s. <br />
<br />
Still... shedding the bad sides... Gerald was feeling much healthier than before. Much more vigourous. He&#39;d just gone three sessions with Richard and he knew he could still go a couple of rounds. It deserved some investigation. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, diseases?&quot; Hugo replied. &quot;Well, I cannot share the specifics behind the dicking mecanisms, but as you are now, you do not require air, water or food for survival. Alternative forms of nutrition are suggested if you want to be able to keep producing sperm, but not strictly necessary. Dicked humans also do not suffer from any disease. Incompatibility with most viruses and bacteria. Why, are you worried about yourself? You seem like a perfectly healthy cock to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, this is not about me, Hugo,&quot; Gerald said. &quot;I&#39;m just curious about what would happen to someone that *was* currently sick and got dicked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo looked thoughtful. For a moment, he said nothing, then he pulled up his tablet and started typing. &quot;Well, by all means, the new penis would be far more healthy than their previous human self.&quot;<br />
<br />
On that note, Hugo left. Gerald, alone, a simple dick hooked up to the company&#39;s computer, pondered for a minute. Then, he used the &#39;call&#39; fonction of his app. His son&#39;s bodyguard appeared on the screen, tall, tan, black hair to match the black glasses. A professional mask of stoicism that never broke. <br />
<br />
&quot;Cole, you are to retrieve my son from home and bring him to my office, unless it jeopardizes his immediate well-being.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right away, sir,&quot; Cole replied, saying nothing about the state of his boss.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Nico was anxious. His dad never called him from work, usually. It was more of a &#39;don&#39;t leave home, Nico&#39; or &#39;that&#39;s too dangerous, Nico.&#39; The sort of lines that made him feel as if he were made of glass. He couldn&#39;t blame his dad, but it grated. <br />
<br />
Now he had no idea why Cole had come up to him in his bedroom (nearly walking in on a jerking off session) and announced that he was going to Richard and Son Inc.&#39;s main building for a meeting with his dad. <br />
<br />
Cole had given no hint. Just helped him into the limousine. The help, unfortunately, had been needed. His bones had started aching on the way down the stairs, and by the time he had gotten to the elevator to his dad&#39;s office, his legs felt as if they were on fire. He had to pause to stabilize his breathing before he entered. When he did, he found only a stranger, with a camera in hands. A paparazzi? No, a profesionnal photographer? But where was his father? <br />
<br />
... Had Dad left a dildo on his desk?!<br />
<br />
He almost had a heart attack when his dad&#39;s voice rose up from the lifelike dildo. &quot;Nico, good, you&#39;re here, we need to talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You bet! Why are you... you&#39;re a penis!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I am. One of Richard&#39;s better ideas. Which is why I asked you to come here today. I&#39;ve asked around and I&#39;ve found a way to cure you of your chronic illness.&quot; Despite himself, Nico&#39;s heartbeat sped up. &quot;It&#39;s simple really. You just have to become your own dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, this is insane!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, this is for your own good. You&#39;ll thank me someday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t just say that! I&#39;m your son, I should get the final say!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m your father. I decide what&#39;s best for you. Hugo.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nico tried to run. He couldn&#39;t, obviously. He was too slow. Too sick to get away. Barely fast enough to get up in time to get the full experience. Light washed over his skin, and then, the world expanded. Air brushed against his naked skin, his entire naked body as he fell through the darkness of his own clothes. The impact of his dickhead against a cushion of his own pants was mercifully soft.   <br />
<br />
Nico tried to scream. His father had him reduced to his own cock! How could he?! Why would he... <br />
<br />
All his life, all his life he&#39;d felt that dark presence inside his body. The thing that steadily ruined his health every year. Nico had once dreamed of going to college with Danny, before he had to spend six months in the hospital. He&#39;d been resigning himself to living a short uneventful life. <br />
<br />
But he could tell now. He wasn&#39;t sick anymore! <br />
<br />
Nico sobbed happily. <br />
<br />
He was a healthy, nine inch cock!</p>
