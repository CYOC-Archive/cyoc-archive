<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Additional tag: Multilimb</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With Pride Month beginning, one of the main focuses in Las Vegas is the Herm Exposition. With hermaphrodite conversions at half-price, it was expected for a lot more people to do it. More than that, there was an expectation that Animalia&#39;s herm repertoire would be be expanded exponentially. The Herm Exposition will be needed to showcase all the various herm species that currently exist and will be introduced. There were already some people applying for new species of herms to become.<br />
<br />
Brittney knew she was beautiful. She had the whole package: light gold hair, blue eyes, skin that that naturally tanned with risk of burns, a hot body that didn&#39;t require much maintenance to keep her figure. Everyone who knew agreed she was one of the most beautiful women they&#39;ve personally known. And yet, Brittney never felt right with it. Though she never admitted it to anyone, she felt like she was born in the wrong body. As much as she got along with the other girls, she never really felt like one of them. She used to fantasize about meeting a good-looking man who felt the same way that she did and they would switch bodies to live their perfect lives. But this isn&#39;t a world of magic.<br />
<br />
Brittney regarded the trans women with approval and envy. It was so easy for men to declare themselves female, dress like women, and get the plastic surgery and hormone treatment to make themselves look more feminine. It was far harder for a woman to become a man. The most she could hope for was to pass herself as a tomboy and that would still feel hollow. And she has spent her whole life living up to others&#39; expectations that she couldn&#39;t bring herself to break their mental image of her.<br />
<br />
Brittney had been mostly indifferent to Animalians until she heard about their hermaphrodites. It made her hope that someday they&#39;ll create a formula that&#39;ll allow her to fully transition to a male. Though her rational side told her she was being foolish. There is no way for there to be a species which has only males. Then Project Lesbos started and then the announcement of the ROSE House. Brittney almost screamed out at the unfairness. Men always get it easiest, even becoming the opposite sex.<br />
<br />
That proved to be the last straw for Brittney. Any chance of completely transitioning to a man was nothing more than a fantasy. So she&#39;ll have to settle halfway and become a herm. It shouldn&#39;t be so bad, she told herself. Better to be half-male than not male at all. But if she was going to go through with it, she wanted to break as far away from the image of her old self as possible. She wanted her new body to be utterly unrecognizable from Brittney. Losing her hair would be a big part, so her interests turned towards the reptilian Animalians. Dinotopians lose their hair, but Brittney didn&#39;t really want to be a dinosaur. But there was one other type of reptile Animalian that she knew of that didn&#39;t keep their hair.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
&quot;It can certainly be done,&quot; said Judy, &quot;Mixing up a herm cobra formula should be simple, if that&#39;s what you really want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like nothing I&#39;ve ever desired before,&quot; said Brittney, completely honestly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, as long as you&#39;re becoming a snake Animalian, there&#39;s also the multiarm option,&quot; said Judy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you offer that with every Animalian?&quot; asked Brittney.<br />
<br />
&quot;Typically no,&quot; said Judy, &quot;Everyone may want to have four arms, but they tend to be a bit of a hassle to master. But with snakes, the legs that would otherwise become part of the tail would become the second pair of arms. According to our studies, people who become snakes have better motor control of their new sets of arms. Most likely because the nerves and muscles that they&#39;ve used their whole lives are still there. In fact, we already have some four-armed cobras-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect, I&#39;ll take it,&quot; said Brittney. A four-armed herm cobra was about as far apart from her human self as she could think without adding another head or wings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent,&quot; said Judy, &quot;I&#39;ll get that ready for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Before long, Brittney was in the throes of transformation. She could feel the modified virus coursing through her body, changing every cell in it. The first sign of her change was her skin drying out and becoming rougher. Her tan coloration was shifting to a different brown as her skin became scales. She felt her body swelling in all dimensions, making her hospital gown quite tight. Brittney rubbed her hands over her scalp, which hastened her hair falling out as the back of her head started to swell out into a hood.<br />
<br />
Brittney&#39;s legs felt an odd numbness, as if they had both fallen asleep. In actuality, they were in the process of separating from her pelvis and moving further up her torso. Bones and muscles rearranged as locked into a new pair of shoulder blades, her feet remolding into clawed hands like her originals. Below her waist was an elongating tube of flesh that stretched out further as her tailbone grew more and more.<br />
<br />
Speaking of below her waist, her vagina was pulsing like it never had before. Part of it was that it was adapting to be like the vaginas of other snake Animalians. But her clitoris was receiving new instructions of what it should be. It began growing longer and longer, becoming a bright red as it did. It grew thicker at first, but then a fission began down the middle. Hands that were formerly feet stroked the engorged clitoris before it split in twain to form a serpentine hemipenis, which was connected to newly -formed interior testicles. Both hands grasped a penis and started pumping.<br />
<br />
Brittney, though shi didn&#39;t feel at all like a &#39;Brittney&#39; now, moaned as shi got closer to hir first herm orgasm. Hir gown was getting too tight by now, so shi grabbed and ripped it apart. Hir original arms soon started fondling hir growing breasts. Hir shoulders got broader and hir muscles got thicker as testosterone rose up dramatically. &#39;Brittney&#39;s&#39; mostly human face looked strange attached to a cobra&#39;s hood, let alone a body like shi was gaining. But that soon changed as hir nose melted down to two slit nostrils as hir mouth pushed out into a serpentine snout, hir canines become long fangs. &quot;Thisss...feelssss...ssssso...good...&quot; moaned &#39;Brittney&#39;, hir new forked tongue picking up more scents as it slipped out with hir S&#39;s. She could taste hir own arousal, in a manner of speaking. Though shi didn&#39;t need that to tell hir shi was going to orgasm soon. Shi let out a louder hiss as hir hemipenis started going off for the first time.<br />
<br />
It took a few minutes for &#39;Brittney&#39; to really feel hir new tail, let alone try to stand on it. At least it was easy to push hirself up with hir new arms. Thankfully, hir new instincts had managing hir new massive limb as soon as shi was upright. And it also made it easier for hir to use hir new form of locomotion to slither over to the mirror. The cobra in the mirror was completely unrecognizable from Brittney. The only thing that remotely resembled the old her was hir eyes appearing blue, though that could just be a trick of the light or hir imagination. Bu the rest of hir body was a magnificent example of reptilian curves and muscles. Shi may not be completely male, but this was an acceptable compromise. Shi didn&#39;t mind hir larger breasts or that hir vagina still existed, mostly because shi had the broader shoulders common with herm Animalians and hir dicks were withdrawing back into hir body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thisss isssn&#39;t ssso bad at all,&quot; said &#39;Brittney&#39;, flexing hir four arms. But a completely new body and new identity would require a new name. Shi picked up hir phone, which seemed smaller in hir hand now. Shi could fortunately still put in hir passcode as hir thumbprint would surely be unrecognizable, if shi even had fingerprints anymore. &#39;Brittney&#39; did a random search for snake names and the names for things appropriately snake-related like lamias and nagas. Eventually, shi found one to hir liking. &quot;Sssilixera,&quot; shi said to hirself. Shi kept repeating it both to help cement that new name in hir head and to try and work through hir hissing.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Once Silixera adjusted to hir new instincts and fully figured out how to manage hir four arms and hir tail, shi began moving forward. Whil shi was still going to be at the Herm Exposition, shi wasn&#39;t going to spend all of hir time there. It wasn&#39;t much of a surprise that shi decided to start performing at the Meat Market. Many new Animalians adjusting to their new hormones and instincts gravitated towards the Meat Market to work out their libido. Silixera&#39;s exotic nature soon made hir quite popular. And it was at the Meat Market that Silixera first met Becka and started a very close relationship with her. But that&#39;s a story for another time.</p>
