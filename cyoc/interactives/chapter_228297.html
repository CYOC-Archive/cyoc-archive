<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Seeing all sorts of furies out and about wasn’t an unusual sight; the fact that it was Christmas day did make it for an eye raising moment. However Michael didn’t pay much attention as he parked his Saab in the cleared out parking lot; he along with his tigress mate Denise exiting the car. While the stag-deer fury collected the toboggan from the trunk as well as an inner tube that needs inflating; Denise helped her cub out of the child seat she still had to sit in. The five year old cub was eager to jump out of the car to have some fun, she inadvertently made it difficult for Denise to unbuckle the excited tigress cub.<br />
“Well someone is eager for fun,” Michael observing the cub squirming to get out; “hold still for a few seconds so mom can finish.”<br />
<br />
Roxy reluctantly did as she was told and was soon allowed to leave the car; her pink paw pads making contact with the cold ground did make her shiver for a few moments before getting use to the cold ground. Taking her mother’s paw the three make their way towards the ski hill just outside of town. An advantage to living in the Pacific Northwest was plenty of mountains with ski slopes on them. While most of the slopes did close down after the fury flu; a lack of means in which to secure ski and snowboards to the paws and talons of various furies, they soon started coming back to life as some die hard snow enthusiasts managed to figure out how to use magic to safely secure the equipment to themselves without irritation.<br />
<br />
Michael noticed a red feathered cardinal fury helping a young mute swan fury balance herself on a snowboard while a Doberman fury rocketed down the hill stopping next to the two. A smaller Doberman fury soon followed but at a slower pace; the cub still trying to balance himself on the brand new looking board, fell down just as he managed to stop like his father. The Cardinal and Doberman furies both chuckle as Michael continue to follow his mate and daughter to the ski lift for those with toboggans and sleds. The slope smaller than the ones for skiing and snowboarding; it doubled as a beginner slope for first time skiers.<br />
“I wonder if what is being used for the skis,” Denise watching several fury cubs being taught how to ski for the first time; “can be used for skates? It’s been a while since I have been on an ice rink.”<br />
“I hope so,” Michael coming up to the ticket counter to pay for some passes; “I would like to see Hockey making a comeback.”<br />
<br />
Since the Thanksgiving fury flu of 2023, there has been a lack of sports entertainment; most requiring the use of equipment such as pads and helmets, this killed football and hockey as furies could not stand wearing clothing. The garments making them feel constrained as well as overheated; clothing also had the added issue of irritating the fur, feathers or scales of the fury in question. Summertime sports such as Volleyball, baseball and basketball were not heavily dependent on safety gear as those sports were not necessarily full contact; they were quickly re-tooled to suit a fury’s new instincts.<br />
“You men and your sports,” Denise rolling her eyes as they make their way to the ski lift; “you can’t be happy unless there is some blood spilled or a few haymakers contacting an opponent.”<br />
“Well there is this old chestnut,” Michael helping his daughter into the ski lift and sitting next to her. Both parents keeping the cub in the middle as the lift moves, taking them up the slope. “I went to see a fight, and a hockey game broke out.”<br />
“Ha,” Denise unable to hide her mirth; “if what we saw being used to keep skis and snowboards attached without the use of boots, you just might get what you want.”<br />
“Keep still Roxy,” Michael noticing his daughter fidgeting as they are now a good twenty feet above the ground below them; heading up the hill in a bench suspended and supported by a series of cables that are pulling them along. “A fall from this height can do worse then give you a skinned knee or a couple of bruises.”<br />
“Don’t scare our daughter,” Denise placing a comforting paw on the tigress cub; “plus we are almost at the end.”<br />
<br />
A minute later they were off the lift and walking on a reasonably leveled portion of the mountain; heading the edge allows Michael to survey the distance to the bottom; it wasn’t a huge distance, roughly five hundred feet. The Stag-deer fury worried that his daughter would see the distance and start to cry and tear up at being too high up the slope. Sighing he uses his runes to magically inflate the inner tube he brought up and then sets it down.<br />
“Your riding down the hill in that,” Denise looking at the rapidly inflating rubber donut; “you’re going to wipe out before you hit the bottom.”<br />
“Want to make a bet of it,” Michael dispelling the magic as the tube is now fully inflated; sitting in it so he would have to lean up to see past his hooves. Placing his hoof hands on the ground to give him leverage as he prepares to go down.<br />
“I can think of a few things,” Denise smiling wryly; sitting down in the toboggan and placing Roxy on her lap. “But not in front of our daughter,” Denise pushing the sled down the hill and letting gravity do the rest.<br />
<br />
“Last one down is a rotten egg,” Denise shouts as she leaves her mate behind. The childish dig bringing out a competitive streak in Michael; he pushes himself down and begins to race down the slope on his inner tube. Picking up speed he soon catches up with Denise and Roxy before shooting past them as he begins to spin and tilt in his tube; hitting a small bump gives him some air that those nearby notice and watch as he struggles to stay on the wildly uncontrollable object. Michael cheers as he manages to stay on as the tube makes contact with the snowy surface; shifting his weight so to turn around, allowing him to look forward, Michael swears as he nears the bottom and sees he is about to run into the same fury’s teaching their cubs to snowboard he watched earlier. Without thinking he digs into the snow with a hoof hand, trying to steer around as well as slow down; Michael manages to make enough noise to make the group notice and scramble out of the way as he barrels into a quickly erected snow bank that a nearby slope employee magically erected.<br />
<br />
Michael slowly pulls himself out of the snow break just as his mate and daughter arrive in the toboggan; Denise making sure to take it slow so as not to risk injury to Roxy.<br />
“I guess that make you two rotten eggs,” Michael smiling as he pulls out the tube.<br />
“No fair,” Roxy mock pouting; seeing her father race down the hill made the cub want to go faster than what her mother would allow. “Daddy had to have cheated,” Roxy adding; jumping out of her mother’s lap as she raced to the deer fury wiping the snow off of his fur.<br />
“That was some serious air you got there,” the slope attendant who erected the snow barrier approaching; the anthro bobcat fury looking at Michael with a serious look. “You could have hurt yourself or worse other furies,” the employee admonishing the stag-deer fury.<br />
“Nowhere does it say that inner tubes are not allowed,” Michael responding as he picks up the object.<br />
“True,” the bobcat answering; “but we do reserve the right to refuse entry or the use of any equipment that may be unsafe. Be it to the user or to other patrons. Your inner tube meets that criteria,” the anthro bobcat stating as his runes glow and the tube is instantly deflated thanks to a few magically made tears into the rubber. “You can rent a pair of skis, snowboard or a sled from the clubhouse if you wish to continue to ride down the slopes.”<br />
<br />
Michael was about to respond when his mate stopped him. “How about you ride with Roxy in the toboggan while I go get use some hot chocolate.”<br />
“Yay,” Roxy beaming; “daddy is going to sled me! Can we go fast?” The cub looking at her father with wide eyes of joy.<br />
“Alright,” Michael tossing the destroyed tube in a nearby trash can; picking up the toboggan and escorting Roxy back to the ski lift for another trip down the hill.</p>
