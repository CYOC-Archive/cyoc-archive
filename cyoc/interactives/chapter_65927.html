<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The debate continued on in much the same way as it had started. There were a lot questions aimed at trying to get Hireman justify his actions and try to explain how his campaign didn't influence the decisions made by teens that decided to attack Amy and Marcella. Now, to some extent there was no real connection. Officer Barnes and I did maintain some contact with Officer Howard and the officers involved in dealing with the case. The attacking teens didn't make their decision under orders from Hireman, and other then Officer Tin's daughter, none of them had paid any attention to the school board elections. In this, Hireman was able to defend himself from having any responsibility for what the teens did.<br />
<br />
However, homophobia did play a major role, and seemed to be Donald Blake's only reason for planning the attack. This then reinforced what the teens claimed to be either betrayal or some form of duplicity on Amy's part. Amy had tried to act like she was &quot;straight&quot; for awhile, and the teens had stated that this act was an unforgivable breech of trust. The three girls, including Abigail Tin, had claimed that Amy had been checking them out in the showers during school, and they described that as &quot;gross&quot;. The fact that homosexuals commonly did hide their sexuality because people didn't treat them well was totally lost on them.<br />
<br />
Amy had told me that most of the people who already knew she was gay had rejected her, and didn't want anything to do with her. She did her best to try and hide it because like any person, she wanted to be liked. She wanted to have friends, and was afraid that if they knew she was gay, she would lose them. And the teens that attacked her, seemed to miss the prejudice that people commonly had against homosexuals. It was the sort of argument that claimed there were no racists in America and that America had no problems. In reality, it was the argument by people who wanted to keep their hatreds secret.<br />
<br />
And that is where the connection between the school board elections and the homophobia that Amy and Marcella's attackers had. Hireman in his paranoia and desire to use some underhanded trick had been following Officer Barnes and I through the school's security camera footage under the claim that there was some legitimate suspicion that we were doing something wrong. In doing this, he came across the footage of Amy's visiting Officer Barnes and myself to get some advice on how to handle the changes in her relationship with Marcel... now Marcella. Marcella's instincts as a Maine Coon kept her straight, which put some strain on their relationship, and Amy asked for our advice. That ultimately led to the suggestion that the Animatrix Serum be used. Hireman used that portion of the footage to make the charge that I was trying to turn everyone in Columbia Falls into Animal People.<br />
<br />
Hireman's attack was a no win scenario for the school board and for Tabby's campaign. If they had retaliated and exposed the truth, they would also implicate themselves in breach of privacy. The only way that Hireman's attack could be negated would be for Amy to make the statement herself. I had urged her to do so, and in light of the attack on them, I did feel a bit guilty over it. But, Amy and Marcella had insisted it was their decision, and they did make the decision. And politically, Amy's statement had broken Hireman's charges, especially when she made it clear that she blamed Hireman for the invasion of her privacy.<br />
<br />
But her statement also had to reveal the details of her relationship with Marcella, including the fact that she was a Lesbian, which lead to the attack. And it was that indirect connection that Hireman had to defend in the debate. Particularly when people in the audience got their chance to ask questions of Hireman. They grilled him repeatedly on the issue. It was as if his one sided campaign was finally reaching the point of tolerance for the people of Columbia Falls.<br />
<br />
Hireman's campaign was marked entirely by lies and underhanded tricks to reinforce his racism. And that was his political consequence from his latest attack and Amy's statement that his attack was a lie and breach of privacy. And the people attending the debate were clearly fed up with that. Molly and I were quiet in terms of our reaction to the debate itself, but we did follow the action in the debate. And that was how we could see that the people were fed up with Hireman's actions. I could also hear the reporters that were covering the debate silently whisper among themselves, as they commented on what was going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think things are really turning,&quot; Molly commented as we left the debate.<br />
<br />
Judging by the responses and heated questions aimed at Hireman, some of them not even directly related to the election, it was fairly clear that Tabby had won the debate. And to that comment, I nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And hopefully Tabby doesn't make a serious blunder in these last couple of weeks for the campaign,&quot; I nodded, &quot;people are probably tired of the fact that everything Hireman has rested on has been underhanded and that he can't come up with a real reason to hate us... at least not one that will stick as a general rule.&quot;<br />
<br />
We quietly continued on our way toward our cabin. There was some interest to see what the local news would say on this debate, as the Columbia Falls School Board Elections had become a standard part of the local news, and times seemed to have more attention then the Presidential and national level elections, which were arguing over many of the same issues.<br />
<br />
&quot;And some may hate me as an individual,&quot; I sighed, &quot;and you and I know... my temper is not helpful in every situation... but you've shown a lot of people that we aren't to be feared... the kids all love you... and you went after that Mountain Lion to save Megan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't sell yourself short, George,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;you'll always be my hero.&quot;<br />
<br />
I wrapped one arm around her shoulders and gave a low rumble in my throat, the closest I could come to purring.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
And the news stations did cover into the debate. They had little to really say about Tabby, but focused on the mistakes that Hireman had made in his campaign and how unpopular they were rapidly becoming. To the reporters it was as if they were setting the race as being against Hireman, not necessarily real support for Tabby. Though, given the fact that Tabby was an unknown when it came to these sorts of things, that tended to be the focus of nearly every election that was similar. The race wasn't so much being in favor of the challenger, but being against the wrongs and mistakes of the incumbent. That would give Tabby a decent shot in this election, and if all went well... she'd be able to point to the good things she had done in the next election.<br />
<br />
And over the next few days, Hireman's numbers in the polls were beginning to take a nose dive. Early on, when his underhanded tactics seemed more legitimate, and as there were plenty of other issues that Hireman had an advantage in, the race had been close. Particularly as there were a lot of issues in which Tabby and Hireman did agree. That normally lead to people supporting the experienced candidate rather then the unknown challenger. But as the campaign went on, Hireman's underhanded attacks became more and more distrusted. Particularly as his charges were proved to be either misused facts or outright lies. And now with the state's local TV networks covering the election, those tricks were costing him a lot more then they had early on.<br />
<br />
And as the first weeks of October began, while the rhetoric in the campaign was still fairly heated, it was rapidly becoming clear that Hireman's tricks were failing to achieve the desired result. But that was largely something that remained in the background. Molly and I obviously paid attention, as the election would directly affect Molly's place in the school district. If Hireman won, he would likely continue his efforts to fire Molly at every possible opportunity. If Tabby won, the school district might finally come free from to the racism that Beauregard had unleashed when Molly and I had moved to Columbia Falls. And in the meantime, we had our lives to live.<br />
<br />
The biggest thing that had to be done was to try and counteract the effects of the attack that the teens had made on Amy and Marcella. And the High School's principal came into the DARE office that Officer Barnes and I used to discuss the matter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, Officers,&quot; the principal said politely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning,&quot; Officer Barnes answered his greeting, &quot;is there anything we can do for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is,&quot; the principal nodded and then gave a sigh, &quot;I'm sure you remember the attack on the Vin and Tyeree girls...&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Barnes and I nodded. That day was still fairly fresh in my mind. Amy had returned to the school, but from what I could see, Marcella did what she could to protect her. She had even hissed at one of the school's football players when he came to close for Marcella's comfort. The football player had been rough-housing with buddies over recent games and didn't know Amy was there. But, with her broken ribs, the doctors had likely told Amy to avoid any strenuous activity or any situation that could result in further injury. Marcella likely knew that, and was making sure that no one barreled into Amy while not paying attention. I'd suspected that they'd also given Amy something that would pad her chest, ribs, and torso up to protect them from further injury, but I didn't want to be a bother to the two of them.<br />
<br />
And on the school's side, the attack had had other consequences. Because much of the attack was only enabled because Officer Barnes and I were babysitting the reporters who mostly gathering the student's opinions on the Choir-Hireman race, the High School, the Middle School, and the Elementary School had all decided not to accept interview requests during school hours. At least not with students, not on divisive subjects, and not in a situation that would require security. If the reporters wanted to interview students on the election, or talk with Molly, Patten, or any of the other school employees, they would have to meet with them at their own homes. And no reporter was yet to come to Bandhavgarh Cabin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to hold an assembly to try and teach something of tolerance,&quot; the principal commented, &quot;I mean we've never had an incident like this before...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You've never had a kid have to give a statement to the local press telling everyone that he or she is gay,&quot; Officer Barnes reminded him, &quot;for the most part they've kept it quiet...&quot;<br />
<br />
The principal only sighed, &quot;all the same... what happened was unacceptable. I don't know if you two formally support things like gay marriage or equal rights for homosexuals, and that isn't the issue. The issue is tolerance. What those kids did crossed a line that even most Anti-Gay people have drawn... you don't just attack people.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Barnes and I nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you're wanting us to provide security for this?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I had hoped you would be the speaker, Officer Wayne,&quot; the principal said weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me?&quot; I gasped, caught by surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; the principal nodded, &quot;as an Animal Person, you've faced some of the same petty hatreds that fueled the attack on Ms. Vin and Ms. Tyeree. Your reaction may not have been the best... but you're the only one to have faced similar hatred. I don't need a lecture on policy or anything of that nature... all the assembly is to be is to explain what is right and what is wrong... tell the students that tolerance is the best thing we can do. That it's better then doing what the teens that made the attack did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; I said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;When do you plan to have this assembly?&quot; Officer Barnes asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;This afternoon,&quot; the principal said nervously, &quot;and we do have it scheduled. I know it's short notice... but it couldn't hurt... and if you can't say anything... I can talk. I simply figured that you would be the best candidate to talk about these issues.&quot;<br />
<br />
I then glanced to Officer Barnes, who only gave a shrug in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I suppose I could make a few remarks,&quot; I said slowly, &quot;I'm not sure how much good I'll do... but I could make a few remarks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it shows the kids that we must tolerate one another, you'll do a lot of good,&quot; the principal answered, &quot;and that is the purpose of the assembly. To show that we must all tolerate one another.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The assembly was held in the High School's gym, and as I made my way into the gym, I found that this assembly was more heavily organized the assemblies that started off the year. The teachers lead each class into the gym and into the stands and they sat in accordance with which class they were in immediately before the assembly. The teachers then sat in a section of the stands near their classes that either put them at the front of the line of students or at the rear of the line of students. Either way, there was a teacher seated between each class, making sure that the classes couldn't jabber among themselves. Marcella sat nervously with a class that had come from the wood-shop and glanced to where Amy was, in a different section of the gym. The fact that the teens that had launched the attack had been suspended left a portion of the stands empty.<br />
<br />
I quietly stood next to the principal as the students came in and sat down. Once all the students were in the stands, the principal stepped forward to a podium that had been set up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good afternoon, staff and students,&quot; the principal spoke slowly, &quot;recently our school has suffered through an incident that I had hoped we would never have. Spurred by petty hatreds, a group of students attacked two of their classmates. This was an act of intolerance that can not be tolerated, regardless of your views. Everyone is different... and it is only when we tolerate our differences and work together to make them work together that we succeed. And I have called this assembly to try and set things right. I have asked Officer George Wayne to give a few remarks on what had happened and on a better way.&quot;<br />
<br />
The principal then stepped aside and offered the podium to me. I slowly approached it. With my height, I quickly found that the podium was far too short for me... though I didn't need the microphone. Turning it off, I gave a slight chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll have to forgive me if I don't use the microphone, and talk to you with a volume closer to what my species can produce in the wild,&quot; I commented, &quot;as it appears I'm a little too tall for your podium.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were a few snickers, but things were largely silent.<br />
<br />
&quot;As your principal has said, this assembly is to talk about tolerance,&quot; I began, &quot;to tolerate others for their differences... be their differences be physical... such as greater development or overall size... species related, Human or Tiger, or Maine Coon, or some other species of Animal Person... philosophical, Republican or Democrat... or sexual, homosexual or heterosexual.&quot;<br />
<br />
I gave a slight pause.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tolerance is important... not merely because it is right or morally better to be tolerant and accepting of others, but also because of the laws our society follows,&quot; I continued, &quot;The assault carried against two of your classmates came from a hatred for their choices and hatred for who they are. And in doing so, they broke the law... and if you look around, you will find that the attackers are not here. They have been suspended for the remainder of this school year and could be facing additional legal punishments for what they have done. It should be clear to all of you that their act of intolerance was not met with the support of the law.&quot;<br />
<br />
I noticed the kids look at each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, in a perfect world, this assembly would never be needed,&quot; I continued, &quot;we would all get along and live as best friends with all our neighbors, regardless of the things that make us different. But, the world is not perfect. Never has been, never will be. And so we are left to struggle against the things that make the world not perfect... unfair, if you will. Things like hatred, greed, inequities... these are things everyone must struggle against.&quot;<br />
<br />
I sighed and paused for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Know that these things that we struggle against are always there, and many people try to excuse them for their own reasons,&quot; I resumed my comments, &quot;that they are protecting someone else... that &quot;God&quot; supports their position and that it is &quot;God's will&quot; that they do what they do... that we must do it in order to achieve some greater good. And we are all guilty of these things to some extent. I am even guilty of this to some extent. You all know my wife... the Tiger Lady at the Elementary School. I love her dearly and will do anything to protect her. And in that, some have seen me as aggressive... as a bully... the very thing that I'm telling you know you shouldn't be...&quot;<br />
<br />
There were a few gasps.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is a sign that we all struggle with these things,&quot; I continued, &quot;We must all struggle against the things that enable people of every stripe and race to make decisions that betray elements of mistrust... intolerance. And if successful, we'll do more good then bad. Because look at the world around you... how many groups do you know of that have preached hatred and have been morally right? Animal People are still people. Homosexuals are still people. It is important to tolerate all of them and to work with them... and in doing so, we will all learn more about them. We'll learn that Animal People are not mindless slaves to animal instinct... and we learn that homosexuals are not mindlessly going after straight members of their own gender. The hatreds that have been used as attacks against these groups are based off of hatreds that have little or no factual basis. And that is the problem with the behavior of the students that are no longer here. They used inaccurate preconceptions to justify attacking their classmates.&quot;<br />
<br />
I paused to glance to the students, whose complete attention I had for the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that was wrong,&quot; I finished, &quot;I can not command you to like those of us that are different. But I can ask that you truly get to know those that are different. That you tolerate their presence and learn from them. You'll probably be surprised by what you learn... and in doing so, you may come to realize that maybe the differences between you are not as great as previously imagined...&quot;<br />
<br />
I then glanced to the principal and stepped back.<br />
<br />
&quot;...that's all that I really have,&quot; I told him.<br />
<br />
The principal nodded and retook the podium.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Officer Wayne,&quot; the principal spoke and retook the podium.</p>
