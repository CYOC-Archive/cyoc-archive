<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>As you can probably tell, the Brad here is not much like the one from the other branch, along with all the other characters. I don&#39;t have this planned out in advance, I&#39;m just writing this as I come up with more pervy ideas. I might start making alternate ending branches to the branches that continue the story.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At the ring of the bell, Kyle made his way down to his school&#39;s parking lot. As most of Glendale&#39;s student body trudged to the cafeteria for lunch, he opened a car door that had been unlocked for him. &quot;Do you have it?&quot; he asked the figure sitting in the driver&#39;s seat. &quot;Yep, bitch fell right into our hands. I already used the industrial glue. I have it wrapped so she doesn&#39;t feel any movement.&quot; Martha replied. &quot;Excellent...well, what am I waiting for then?&quot; Kyle grabbed the burlap sack sitting in the back seat and stuffed it into his bag. Martha grabbed his arm. &quot;Wait. The letter, are you <i>sure</i> Brad will accept the gift?&quot; Kyle smirked, &quot;He&#39;s a dumb jock, but he&#39;s also a teenage boy who just got broken up with. He&#39;s totally one-itis on Jen right now, and what you wrote contains more than enough fuel for his self-pity. He&#39;ll use the thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Surreptitiously walking up to the Glendale locker room a short time later, Kyle glanced around to see if they were any witnesses. Satisfied, he picked the run-of-the-mill hardware store lock guarding the door and entered. He made his way to Brad&#39;s locker and quickly entered the combination. Slipping the item Martha had prepared inside, he shut and redid the lock. He quickly exited the locker room and made his way back to the main campus whistling. Truth be told, he was a little annoyed that he had missed lunch due to the clandestine operation. <i>Oh well, I&#39;ll just work out some of this frustration before class.</i> thought Kyle as he made his way to one of the less-used bathrooms on campus. Entering the stall, he shut the lock and began to unzip his fly.<br />
<br />
Sitting in Kyle&#39;s drawer, Susan&#39;s annoyance showed in her eyes. Her rear-facing mouth began to suck mid-sigh as she felt him start to thrust all 12 inches violently into her ever-accepting pussy.<br />
<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Brad entered the locker room after a hard practice. His performance had dipped after homecoming game, his broken heart affecting his calls. The coaches had noticed, and had just had a long talk with him recommending against getting &quot;too much into girls&quot; during season. &quot;Besides, it&#39;s high school!&quot; they had said. &quot;There are plenty of fish in the sea, and you haven&#39;t even met most of em yet!&quot; In the meantime, they had put the second string in his place until he could come back with a clear mind.<br />
<br />
Due to the length of the talk, Brad was the last one to enter the locker room. Still a team captain, he had the locker room key and and he began changing alone. He often just left his stuff on the bench outside the locker and so had no need to interact with it, but he noticed something odd sitting in the metal container today. Entering his combination after sitting for a long moment to remember it, he takes the burlap sack lying within and peeks inside. At first glance it looked like some sort of odd trophy, or at least an amalgamation of brass and wood. But before he took the object out in it&#39;s entirety, he saw a letter besides it in the sack. Confused as to what he this was all about, he read the letter included with the strange object.<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>Hello Brad,<br />
<br />
I&#39;m someone who&#39;s close to the Smith family. Exactly who is unimportant, but what is important are your feelings regarding Jennifer. I know-</i><br />
<br />
Brad&#39;s heart ached anew at the mention of his ex-girlfriend&#39;s name. He had been completely taken aback by the sudden split, and his body had felt leaden for the past week and a half. All of his friends could tell what had happened just based off of he was acting; Brad wasn&#39;t exactly an expert in subtlety, and that included hiding how he felt as he had always worn his heart on his sleeve. They hadn&#39;t spoken since, and in his mind he was torn between the bitterness he felt at the sudden rejection, and the love he had for her, along with the recognition of how gently she&#39;d let him down. In his darker moments he imagined that she had broken up with him because she was already with someone else. With a maelstrom of emotions swirling in his head (which did not contain the vocabulary word &quot;maelstrom&quot;), he continued reading.<br />
<br />
<i>-I know that you took her split with you very hard, and I empathize with you. Jennifer has high standards, I know. Almost impossibly-high in fact; how could you be expected to meet such demands?! I&#39;ve been cataloging her misdeeds, and you </i>certainly<i> seem to be the recipient of one of them. It strikes me as unfair that your whole year and a half of commitment(!) would pay off with nothing more than some fooling around in the back of your car. And so-</i><br />
<br />
Brad read the words of the note with an increasing sting in his chest as his darker, more spiteful impulses were fed. The note was wrong; they&#39;d done more than &quot;fooled around&quot; in Brad&#39;s car over the summer, but Jen had certainly kept him baying at her heels for quite a while as she had told him she &quot;didn&#39;t want to rush into things&quot; early on in the relationship. And her standards for everyone&#39;s appearance and behavior were <i>so</i> high! He&#39;d watched her chew out their lesser classmates for missteps Brad didn&#39;t even notice. And now, <i>he&#39;d</i> failed those standards finally, despite his loyal 17 & a half months of commitment! (Which, being 18, seemed like a long span to Brad at the time.) Becoming increasingly incensed, he read the last part of the note.<br />
<br />
<i>-And so I felt you deserved something. A recompense, if you will. Jen mislead you about a certain major life event she experienced recently. No, not a new boyfriend! Though she might have lied to you there too, I&#39;ve heard things but I don&#39;t claim to know. She was recently subjected to the town curse. You know, Transform or Dare? Anyway, she recently found herself having to carry her genitals around separately from her person. Hard to believe I know, but you&#39;ve heard the stories right? I managed to spirit some of them away; consider them yours now. If you notice anything missing it&#39;s because she had already given it out, I&#39;m sorry to say. Despite that, now you can carry a piece of her with you always, despite the cruel end of your relationship.<br />
<br />
She may have ended your relationship, but you can always love her from afar,<br />
A friend<br />
<br />
PS: Don&#39;t take it out of the sack until you get home, wouldn&#39;t want anyone seeing this would we? And the plaque is meant to be read in a mirror.</i><br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
As Brad entered his room after eating dinner, he looked at the sack sitting on his floor. Brad didn&#39;t know what &quot;recompense&quot; meant, but he understood enough to get the gist of the letter, and he hadn&#39;t opened the &quot;gift&quot; at the field despite the supposed lack of people. He thought about the contents of the letter. <i>Those stories are just town legends, right? They&#39;re the kind of stuff you fool someone into believing if they get drunk or stoned enough.</i> He considered whether it was a prank, but few students would dare to mess with the 6&#39;1&#39;&#39;, 200-lb (~1.85m & 90.7 kg) and still growing quarterback, despite the fact that he was typically fairly easygoing. He hadn&#39;t been feeling very easygoing lately though, and it was likely most students knew pranking Brad now would probably be their last earthly action.<br />
<br />
Despite this, he was still skeptical and hence hadn&#39;t opened the sack until now. As he undid the drawstring and let the sack hit the floor, however, he began to seriously consider the implications of what the note had said for the first time. As he undid the saran wrap that was stuck around his gift, he felt lightheaded as he fell to his knees staring at the object. Turning it in every direction, he could barely believe his eyes.<br />
<br />
The object had a wooden block as it&#39;s center, a little larger than the size of hotel room safe if laid on it&#39;s back, but that&#39;s where the similarities with most trophies ended. On the front of the block was a photo of Jen in a plastic holder, a previous profile picture of her as Brad recalled. It framed Jen&#39;s head and naked shoulders (she&#39;d worn a tube top) as she gave her sweetest smile, one she rarely showed in real life. Brad had told Jen at the time that her smile had an &quot;I&#39;ve got a secret&quot; look to it, and it still gave him that impression. Beneath it was a narrow plaque that reached from one end of the block to the other, bearing reverse letters that looked like gibberish to Brad.<br />
<br />
Much more attention-grabbing, however, were the top and back sides of the block. On top, facing the back of the box, were two teardrop-shaped brass tits that were honestly more perfectly formed than Jen&#39;s not-negligible breasts were in real life, and located at the end of these were two very familiar-looking nipples. But even this paled in comparison to what lay in back of the box. A sizable bubble of a butt lay in the back, sizable enough for the sides of it to be wider than the box itself. The brass derriere was large enough to take up almost half the total space of the whole arrangement, the shape starting a little near the small of the back above the tailbone and ending with the tops of the thighs melding back into the block. It was so realistically-shaped that at first glance it looked like a brass woman was stuck in an impossibly-small box with her ass stuck out. Two petite brass arms extended from the sides of the box, the manicured hands appearing to spread the cheeks apart to expose the delicate rosebud within. And there, in the middle of the brass Jennifer&#39;s spread cheeks, was the clenching brown ring of flesh & blood Jennifer&#39;s asshole. Beneath it was a blank spot where Jen&#39;s vagina would be.<br />
<br />
As Brad got over the shock of seeing parts of Jennifer that he thought he never would again, he spotted more hardware in the sack. What looked like a brass thong and various anal plugs still sat inside, but he paid them nearly no mind as he considered what lay before him. Brad&#39;s thoughts were conflicted. His more ethical side still loved Jen and thought he should return her stolen parts to her. But his more selfish parts kept pestering him the insistent thought that this might be the last opportunity to have any sort of sexual contact with the girl he lusted after, not to mention that she&#39;d never given up her ass to him and this might be his only opportunity to feel the insides of her bowels with her anus stretched taught around his cock. Even as Brad denied it, the more primal thought process underneath everything enjoyed the dominion he now had over Jen&#39;s helplessly-offered asshole. <i>Maybe I can use it tonight and tell her I found it tomorrow...</i><br />
<br />
As Brad gave into his impulses, he looked again at the blank spot right beneath Jen&#39;s puckering brown eye. <i>The note said that whatever parts aren&#39;t here were already given out. Jen&#39;s already fucking someone else, AND literally passed him her pussy? So much for &quot;taking it slow&quot;, huh Jen?</i> Brad&#39;s bitterness returned as his skepticism of the letter faded. Picking the block up and setting it on his waist-high drawer, he remarked at the weight of his new trophy despite it&#39;s small size besides the ass. <i>You need to lose some weight if you&#39;re going to be my exclusive sex toy, babe...</i> Brad began feeling up the brass tits, paying special attention to Jen&#39;s nipples until they grew as hard as they ever had during their backseat tango. <i>Guess that means your ass is ready for my cock. Let&#39;s try my pace this time.</i> All memory of Jen&#39;s gentleness during their split was forgotten as Brad lined his lubed rod up to Jen&#39;s quivering hole. He pushed into Jen&#39;s back door for the first time, and after a moment he felt her rose bloom as his penis was engulfed in Jennifer&#39;s slimy rectal tube. Continuing to rub Jen&#39;s trophy nipples, he slowly pushed in and out of his ex-girlfriend&#39;s anus as he felt her walls expand and contract around her, powerless to expel their intruder.<br />
<br />
Not long after he had begun, Brad felt a sudden tightening and pressure from the &quot;front&quot; of Jen&#39;s luxurious chute. As he paused, he began to feel the pressure rhythmically enter and leave, and in shock he realized what it meant; <i>Jen is fucking her new boyfriend at the same time as me, the fucking slut!</i> Brad looked in the mirror in front of the box at Jen&#39;s photograph, and finally realized what her secret was. Leaving her nipples with a pinch, he lowered his hands to the trophy&#39;s arms, using them as handles as he abandoned all pretenses and roughly pounded Jennifer&#39;s defenseless anal fleshlight. He enjoyed the feeling of her submission as both her cumdumps started twitching in orgasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;You might be a slut with your pussy, but your ass will always be faithful to me.&quot; Brad muttered as he continued to pump Jennifer&#39;s monogamous orifice, her tight sphincter sucking him in as it futilely tried to close around the massive cock wedging it open. He was determined to last longer than the guy fucking her cunt. <i>I&#39;ll show you what you&#39;re missing out on now, in your pussy at least. How many people get to literally fuck their ex in the ass?</i> He looked at Jen&#39;s picture in the mirror as his hips slammed against the brass cheeks, finally catching sight of what the plaque underneath said.<br />
<br />
<i>Jennifer Smith&#39;s consolation hole, property of Brad Wilcox</i><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Jennifer lay on her stomach in bed, her mouth buried in her pillow as she moaned into it. For a time, she&#39;d secretly experimented with putting fingers, then finally her vibrator up her butt before when she masturbated, but it didn&#39;t compare at all to having an actual cock up her ass, and nothing compared to having two cocks using her pussy and anus simultaneously. She was almost frightened at the intensity of the ass-fucking she was receiving in particular, but all she could do was take it since her entire lower torso had been converted into a unlimited-use pleasure center for others.<br />
<br />
As she looked at Brad&#39;s entry in her phonebook, she desperately wanted to call him. She missed his stability, the grounding effect his simple but easygoing style gave her when she was going crazy, and she was certainly on the verge of going crazy as she seemed farther than ever from locating her lost pussy and now asshole. She was going crazy over the thought that two men now controlled her sexuality. Going crazy over the thought that if she couldn&#39;t find both before the graduation, she&#39;d have to live the rest of her life having her pleasurable parts used by strangers. Her vagina and anus would never again be sacred temples worshiped by a trusted lover, but cumdumps freely-available to whoever happened to hold her puss and asshole. She&#39;d be the easiest girl in the world, men wouldn&#39;t ever even have to meet Jennifer for her most sacred spaces to open to them again and again, as many times as they wished. She couldn&#39;t even cum except when a man decided to pound her holes, and she couldn&#39;t stop herself from cumming when they did. Most of all, she was going crazy over the shame of how much she was enjoying it even as she didn&#39;t want to, her pussy growing wetter as it got pounded. Despite the two penises inside her, Jen felt alone in her struggle to retrieve her genitals. Her thumb lingered over Brad&#39;s name.<br />
<br />
Ultimately though, she decided against it. <i>How can I explain to him what happened without him losing interest in me? &quot;Hi Brad, it&#39;s...ah!...Jen. Look my (oh!) vagina and my (Mmm!) butthole have both been turned into sex toys, can you help? Yeah, sorry about the noise, I&#39;m taking two dicks right now!&quot; I&#39;d scar him for life even if he believed the curse.</i> Jen thought sadly even as she came again, this time from her ass.<br />
<br />
<i>Speaking of that, can you two cum already?!? It&#39;s a school night and I&#39;m trying to get some sleep!</i> Jen managed to connect her phone to it&#39;s charger and turn her lamp off before slumping into the pillow again with a groan. <i>God it&#39;s almost like you&#39;re competing with each other. Like, hello! It&#39;s me, the woman who&#39;s got to take all of it? Besides....it&#39;s not like I won&#39;t be there tomorrow...</i> Shuddering at the last thought as she continued to squeeze her wet orifices around both dicks in her to try to get them to cum, she longed for Brad&#39;s presence. Little did she know that Brad was closer than she thought, and in fact inside her at the moment as a blank patch of skin between her asscheeks continued to alternate between nearly a dot to a sausage-sized O right above a similar O between her legs.<br />
<br />
As Jennifer&#39;s trusted ex-boyfriend continued to fuck her in the ass, the owner of Jennifer&#39;s pussy came into her womb for the 30th time. Soon after, Jen felt her rectum receive it&#39;s first spunk. Both pulled out, and she was empty for the first time in weeks. This was cold comfort to Jen, though, as she fell asleep with the feeling of jizz dribbling out of both holes.</p>
