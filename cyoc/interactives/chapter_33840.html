<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess it's my turn to be transformed&quot; Jenny said. &quot;What are you going to turn me into Catherine?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me think&quot; Dylan said. There were several things that he could think of. One was a bug but that would be mean. He smiled as he picked one.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is that smile for?&quot; Jenny asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm feeling a little lonely being the only six year old here&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you recite the spell Catherine&quot; Lisa said. &quot;This is the spell that you want. Just focus on Jenny and the age you want her to be when you mutter it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dylan did as Lisa said and when he was done watched Jenny's change. Jenny started to shrink in height and her breasts started to shrink. As she regressed her hips narrowed and her hair grew out. The strangest thing though was that her hair changed from red to blond. It only took about 30 seconds for Jenny to transform from a 14 year old 5 foot 3 girl with short, red hair to a six year old 3 foot 9 girl<br />
with waist length, blond hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did your hair change?&quot; Dylan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is what my hair looked like when I was six&quot; Jenny said. &quot;I dye my hair and I like it short. It took me forever to convince my mom to let me dye it and cut it short.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it's your turn now Jenny&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
Jenny simply said &quot;Spin.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pointer spun around and finally stopped on Rachael.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know just what your transformation will be&quot; Jenny said. &quot;You've always wondered what it would be like to be a boy, so that's what you'll be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know this one by heart&quot; Lisa said and then muttered the spell.<br />
<br />
The first thing to change on Rachael was her hair shortened. Her breasts diminished until her chest was flat. Her face became more masculine. Her hips narrowed while her waist widened. Her arms and legs became thicker as well as her hands and feet. Sparse hair grew on her chest. Finally her pussy closed up and her lips formed ball sacks while her clit grew into a penis and came forward a bit. In 30 seconds Rachael had gone from a 13 year old girl to a 13 year old<br />
boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;How is it?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is gross&quot; Rachael said in a deeper voice than what she previously had. &quot;How can guys stand being guys?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I asked myself that same question&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys don't think that being guys is gross&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do guys do it Catherine?&quot; Rachael asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They just do&quot; Dylan said, &quot;they've lived that way their whole lives.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you go through something similar when you first changed Catherine?&quot; Rachael asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I didn't want to be a girl and I demanded that Karen change me back&quot; Dylan said. &quot;I didn't think being a girl was gross or anything but I wanted to go back to being a boy. I guess it was because I had spent my life as a boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I don't like this body&quot; Rachael said. &quot;Thank God this is only temporary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it's your turn Rachael&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right&quot; Rachael said, &quot;spin.&quot;<br />
<br />
When the pointer stopped this time it was pointing to Megan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok what will I become?&quot; Megan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've always thought that you'd make a good centaur&quot; Rachael said.<br />
<br />
Lisa and Dylan were looking through the spell book for a centaur spell. &quot;Here it is Catherine&quot; Lisa said. &quot;You better stand up Megan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dylan focused on Megan and muttered the spell. The first change to happen to Megan was the lower half of her body from the waist down became covered in brown fur. Her legs split in half and the back half was pulled back as Megan's rear extended back. Her pussy followed her hind legs back. Her feet changed into hooves and finally a tail grew out of her rear.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is cool&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel like running&quot; Megan said. &quot;I bet I could run pretty fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe later Megan&quot; Lisa said. &quot;It's your turn to spin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I really want to run but I guess I'll continue the game&quot; Megan said. &quot;Spin.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pointer landed on Anna this time.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going to do Megan?&quot; Anna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm just going to change your hair&quot; Megan said. &quot;I want to see it down to your ankles.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know this one by heart too&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
Lisa muttered the spell and Anna's hair grew out and pooled around her on the floor.<br />
<br />
Anna picked up some of her hair and said &quot;I'm glad I don't have this long of hair normally. Imagine having to wash this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Imagine having to wash this body&quot; Megan said. &quot;I wouldn't be able to wash it by myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone broke out in a fit of laughter imagining Megan trying to wash her centaur body by herself.<br />
<br />
Finally Lisa was able to say &quot;It's your turn to spin Anna.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright alright&quot; Anna said still chuckling, &quot;spin.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pointer landed on Karen this time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I haven't had a turn yet&quot; Hannah said. &quot;How come it stopped on Karen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's just chance that it stops on someone&quot; Lisa said. &quot;It doesn't matter if you've transformed or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I may never get a turn?&quot; Hannah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll get a turn sometime&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Just be patient and enjoy the game. Now, what are you going to do to Karen Anna?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we haven't seen an inanimate transformation yet&quot; Anna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're going to turn me into something inanimate!&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You bet&quot; Anna said, &quot;I just have to think what to transform you into.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This should be interesting&quot; Hannah said. &quot;Perhaps you could transform her into something useful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what is that suppose to mean?&quot; Karen asked with her hands on her hips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing&quot; Hannah said, &quot;I just thought that you should have some use. You wouldn't be very useful if you were a plant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that's true&quot; Karen said. &quot;So Anna, have you decided what to turn me into yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I have&quot; Anna said. &quot;I want you to become an android.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa was flipping through the book trying to find the right spell. &quot;I don't know if that is in here. An android isn't exactly inanimate and it isn't a mythical transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could it be body modification?&quot; Dylan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think so&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Body modification is stuff like muscles, hair, eye color, the shape of the face, skin color, and breast and penis size. An android is a machine and a machine is inanimate. So it stands to reason that it would be in the inanimate section but I can't find it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dylan started thinking about his old life. He had gotten into sci-fi recently and of course androids are almost a staple of sci-fi. He started thinking about what an android could be called. &quot;Try robot, mechanical man/woman, or living puppet&quot; Dylan suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is a spell for a mechanical man/woman but I don't know if it's what Anna is looking for&quot; Lisa said. &quot;The description says that it will transform someone into a mechanical being that resembles a man or woman. It doesn't say how closely it resembles a man or woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well there's only one way to find out&quot; Anna said. &quot;If that's the closest you can come than use it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like it is the closest thing&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Do you want to take this one Catherine?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok then&quot; Lisa said, &quot;this is the spell you need.&quot; Lisa placed her finger on the spell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Dylan said. He muttered the spell focusing on Karen.<br />
<br />
The only thing that happened was Karen's skin became shiny, like latex.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you feel?&quot; Lisa asked after 30 seconds had passed.<br />
<br />
Karen lifted her hand up to her eyes and opened and closed it. &quot;This is weird&quot; she said. &quot;There's numbers and words scrolling up in my vision. When I look at each of you I can see your measurements. I can see the electrical wires in the walls and ceiling. My skin feels weird like it's rubber but I don't hear the squeaking of rubber against rubber.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well your skin looks like it's latex&quot; Hannah said. &quot;You know, this is fun and all but if we want to watch a movie we should quit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right&quot; Karen said, &quot;we should stop.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright we'll stop&quot; Lisa said. She then muttered a spell and the pointer spun a little bit. When it stopped she put it away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you change us back so we can watch the movie?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I'll change you back&quot; Lisa said and then muttered another spell.<br />
<br />
Dylan felt that same tingling he felt before. His fins fattened and turned back into feet. His tail split back into legs and his pussy moved back to it's normal position. 30 seconds later Dylan was once again a six year old girl.<br />
<br />
Lisa repeated the spell for each one that had been transformed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank God I'm a girl again&quot; Rachael said. &quot;I feel like I need to take a shower now. Sorry about that Catherine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you really feel like you need a shower go take one&quot; Karen said. &quot;We'll wait until your done to start the movie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachael went to take a shower while everyone else put on their night clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was fun&quot; Karen said, &quot;we need to do it again sometime.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course we'll do it again&quot; Lisa said. &quot;One of these times I need to take you to a special place of mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What special place?&quot; Dylan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A place with a huge lake that you'll be able to swim in&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be fun&quot; Dylan said. He didn't want anyone to know it yet but he was starting to like being a girl. He was starting to agree with Rachael that being a boy was gross. He knew that there was something wrong there but he couldn't tell what it was. If he was feeling like this, what would he feel like in a week?<br />
<br />
&quot;Earth to Catherine&quot; Karen said. &quot;You appear to be lost in thought.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you say that?&quot; Dylan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just basically froze while you were pulling up your panties&quot; Karen said. &quot;What were you thinking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing&quot; Dylan said while he finished pulling up his panties.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, you can tell us&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was nothing&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was something&quot; Karen said. &quot;Come on, tell us or we'll keep bugging you to tell us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright I'll tell you&quot; Dylan said. &quot;I'm starting to like being a girl. I agree with Rachael that boys are gross.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you used to be a boy&quot; Jenny said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know&quot; Dylan said, &quot;that's what bothers me. I was a boy until yesterday and I'm thinking that boys are gross. What's wrong with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's nothing wrong with you Catherine&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why do I feel like this?&quot; Dylan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that you're getting used to being a girl&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Some of your views are bound to change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dylan sat down and cried. Karen came over and hugged her. 'Oh great' she thought, 'now I'm thinking of myself as a girl and acting like one. How far will this go?'<br />
<br />
&quot;It's ok sis&quot; Karen said, &quot;being a girl isn't that bad. For one thing you no longer have to worry about becoming sterile from a kick to the groin. Your reproductive organs are now on the inside of your body. Girls get to wear pretty clothes and no one thinks anything of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dylan stopped crying and asked &quot;What about periods?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Those kind of suck&quot; Karen admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's mostly cramps that you'll have to worry about when you're old enough to have periods&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you think being a girl is better than being a boy?&quot; Dylan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well the only ones that can answer that are you, Rachael, and Lisa&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think being a girl is better than being a boy&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about sex?&quot; Dylan asked.<br />
<br />
They all looked at each other and then Lisa said &quot;We don't know how it feels to have sex as a boy. The first time I transformed myself into a boy was yesterday to slip the medallion to you. That was gross enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cyndi had sex with you when I had used the medallion to change you into a copy of myself&quot; Karen said. &quot;I know that it's not the same but the orgasm should be pretty close. Compare that orgasm to a male orgasm and tell us which you think is better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dylan thought back to her orgasms as a boy and as a girl. When she compared the two she had to admit that having an orgasm as a girl was better. She remembered the multiple orgasms she had as a girl. They involved the whole body and each one was more intense than the last. When she had had an orgasm as a boy it was only one orgasm and it was just concentrated in her penis.<br />
<br />
&quot;A female orgasm is definitely better than a male orgasm&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It should stand to reason that sex as a girl is better than sex as a boy&quot; Lisa said. &quot;If you were able to go back to being a boy, would you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dylan thought it over for a little bit. Finally she simply said &quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then look at what you've gained&quot; Karen said. &quot;When you look at it there's no need to cry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right sis&quot; Dylan said wiping his eyes with his hands, &quot;I don't need to cry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a good girl&quot; Karen said. &quot;Now get your nightie on and we'll have pizza and watch the movie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What movie are we going to watch?&quot; Dylan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have a couple of movies&quot; Anna said, &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines and A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which one would you like to watch first?&quot; Karen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about Terminator 3&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Terminator 3 it is then&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
Dylan quickly pulled on her nightie and they all started watching the movie. Dylan fell asleep toward the end of the movie and Karen tucked her into her sleeping bag.</p>
