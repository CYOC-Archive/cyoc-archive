<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You are going to help me extend my grasp to the overworld, and become a being capable of great power, and strength. Your potential must not go to waste now shall it?&quot; Nitrosinous said <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know about this, I mean I don&#39;t like killing humans as it is.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Not all humans will perish, only those who despise, and wish to oppose us. Besides I wasn&#39;t asking, I was ordering, and when a demon lord orders their underlings to do something, the underlings do it without question. In laments terms, I will get what I want from you, no matter how painful, or horrific it has to be, for you. You saw what a small fraction of my forces did to that puny settlement you ended up appearing in, we wouldn&#39;t want the same to happen to you now would we. Besides you already killed about 2 dozon humans with your fire, including the guards, and those who died when the flames spread.&quot; Nitrosinous said <br />
<br />
You paused recalling the havoc at the castle settlement, and gulped. &quot;O..okay then, I see your point, as long as I don&#39;t die or get scarred for life I&#39;ll cooperate.&quot; You said, attempting to hide the tone of fear in your voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, I have sent one of my personal minions to transport you to the underworld, or as many call it, Hell. Don&#39;t worry about the flames, your body is already immune to them.&quot; Nitrosinous said as his body distorted inside the pond, and all that was left was your reflection.<br />
<br />
You took a deep breath and then exhaled a small smoke cloud,&quot;That could have been worse, but it could have been better too. Let&#39;s just hope that I don&#39;t get spotted by a knight.&quot; You thought to yourself. You then felt something on the back of your neck, and you jumped startled. You turned around to see an anthropomorphic wolf with cinders, and embers coursing through its black, and ash gray fur, and he was ass naked with his dick ina sheath.&quot; Greetings, dragon, I am one of master Nitrosinous&#39;s personal servants. I see you are startled by something, was I the cause of that, or is that just your natural reaction?&quot; The wolf said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, you just startled me is all. I&#39;m kind of new you should say, so is there any way I should refer to our lord Nitrosinous, without unintentionally potentially getting myself killed.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;I see master has indeed convinced you of his power, and you fear for your own life. That&#39;s good, but as long as you cooperate you should be fine, I haven&#39;t seen master punish those who obey him at all, or at least yet. Anyways you should formally refer to him as lord, and nothing less, I only call him master because I&#39;m his servant. Come now, your orientation into a true demon awaits, and master will surely have plans for you, he has been anxious since you first appeared.&quot; The wolf said <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, let&#39;s not keep him waiting then, what&#39;s your name by the way?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Garanaf, you will receive a new name upon completing your orientation, but master has requested to see you personally. Feel honored, he says he looks forward to a face to face meeting with you.&quot; The wolf, Garanaf said, and he placed one of his paw-like hands on your shoulder and a fiery ring appeared around your feet. The flames around the ring grew, and eventually engulfed you completely, and you closed your eyes. When you opened your eyes again you were in what appeared to be a volcanic wasteland, and there was no plantlife or water in sight. Lava was everywhere, and you watched as imps were working almost like slaves for much larger demons, and those bigger demons just casually walking around like everything was normal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the Hell, my shortly known friend, come master is this way.&quot; Garanaf said walking towards a large brimstone fortress built into the side of a volcano, and you followed him persistently as to not attract unwanted attention. As you followed Garanaf you saw more of the same thing you saw before, but you also saw what appeared to be a few red, and black dragons in the mix too, and some seemed to be anthropomorphic too, unlike you. The two of you then approached the entrance to the fortress where there stood a muscular, demon resemblant to that of a satyr.<br />
<br />
You followed Garanaf, but as you went to enter the satyr demon stopped you and said,&quot;You are not permitted in this area, turn back or else.&quot; You looked up at the demon confused, and then Garanaf spoke up,&quot;Let him pass master has plans for this one. Plans that very well put him higher than you, or does your lack of intelligence suggest that your role is better suited for that of a breeding slave?&quot; The demon almost immediately backed off, and let you pass through unhurt. As you were passing the demon you saw that it was genderless, and that it had a nervous expression on its face.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that about?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Some demons don&#39;t know how to recognize certain things, especially when it comes to one following another willingly. The only time when this occurs here is either for situations such as yours, or when taking up a mate. The guards have no possible way of mating so they can be focused on what they&#39;re supposed to do.&quot; Garanaf explained <br />
<br />
&quot;Got it, is there anything else I should know so I don&#39;t get myself caught in an awkward situation her?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;All will be explained during your orientation, master has a different kind of procedure for you.&quot; Garanaf said <br />
<br />
You decided not to ask about the procedure considering that you think you&#39;ve asked enough as it is. You the inside of the fortress was exactly what you thought it would be, brimstone, bare walls, no doors, and guards everywhere. You kept to Garanaf&#39;s side until he took you to a giant room that looked like a throne room. At the other end of the throne room sat Nitrosinous in the throne,&quot;Welcome dragon, this is my fortress where I usually dwell, does it strike your fancy at all?&quot; Nitrosinous asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it&#39;s certainly nicer than anything I&#39;ve seen in Hell thus far.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Idiot address your lord formally.&quot; Garanaf said and you felt yourself grow worrisome.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Garanaf don&#39;t be so rash, the dragon here simply doesn&#39;t know our customs. For now however leave us alone Garanaf, what I&#39;m about to conduct isn&#39;t for your eyes or ears.&quot; Nitrosinous said, and Garanaf bowed to Nitrosinous and walked away.<br />
<br />
&quot;So uh, what&#39;s going to happen now?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I am going to infuse you with a fraction of my power that will be fully regenerated by me later. In addition you will be filled with the knowledge of your role, and you will know how to act, and use your new abilities too. However, the process is experimental, and your body may be transformed in the process potentially giving you new gender, and/or new skeleton structure making you anthropomorphic. You will keep your draconic features, and memories aren&#39;t an issue, your mind will not be altered only receive knowledge of what you&#39;re supposed to do.&quot; Nitrosinous said <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then,&quot; you said <br />
<br />
&quot;Prepare yourself, the process hasn&#39;t been done before, but we&#39;re going to begin immediately.&quot; Nitrosinous said <br />
<br />
You then braced yourself for whatever may happen, and suddenly you felt your body gaining strength, demonic strength both physically and magically. You then felt memories rush into your brain, the memories of thousands of demons and your Nitrosinous himself were flowing into your mind. You suddenly felt a huge strain on your mind, and a sudden headache caused you to pass out unconscious from the pain.<br />
<br />
When you awoke you were laying on solid ground inside a corridor that was basically the size of a small room. You groaned holding your head, which was throbbing from the headache pain. Garanaf then walked into the room and looked at you in the eyes. Then he spoke,&quot;Welcome to your new life, your title is now Hell Guider. I assume you would like to get used to your current status and process everything that has happened to you. I shall wait for you outside the corridor, would you like to hear your new name now or later?&quot; Garanaf asked and you shook your head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well then, I shall inform you once you emerge from the room.&quot; Garanaf said <br />
<br />
You then took a moment to adjust, and then realized what Lord Nitrosinous said, and that you may be transformed. You immediately looked down at your body, and you had black marks all over your body, and you...</p>
