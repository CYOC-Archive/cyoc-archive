<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Samantha Twist, werecat, held on to William Anderson, newly created werefox, as tightly as she could, despite the fact that he kept trying to break away and rejoin Yvette, the werevixen who turned him.<br />
&quot;Let me go!&quot; howled William, between yips calling and pining for his new mate. &quot;I must be with Yvette!&quot;<br />
&quot;Not tonight,&quot; said Samantha. &quot;You need time to adjust to the new were side of your life, which is why most new arrivals are initiated into our society slowly and not rushed into something they might not be completely able to deal with yet.&quot; <i>I&#39;d hate to be in Yvette&#39;s fur when the Elders deal with her rouge actions.</i><br />
&quot;But I must sire—&quot; began William, feeling his newly transformed werefox penis create its end knot and grow even longer and harder in the process.<br />
&quot;I said not—&quot; but Samantha never got to finish repeating her statement as William suddenly took a couple of steps backward and slammed Samantha into a tree.<br />
Her back pressed into the hard trunk, knocking her breath away and releasing the werefox in the process.<br />
Yet, instead of running off after Yvette, William turned to face her.<br />
&quot;You know, while Yvette might be the mother of my future kits, I&#39;m sure there is no rule that says I can&#39;t sire others,&quot; he said, staring at her menacingly.<br />
William&#39;s eyes glowed a feral red as Samantha looked on in horror.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve cheated before, and I&#39;ve got the feeling that the old rule book just got thrown out the proverbial window. Who&#39;s to say I can&#39;t start a harem, and sire every werebitch I can get my paws on?&quot; asked William, as he started to approach her.<br />
Samantha stared at the werefox, the fur bristling across her body.<br />
<i>I&#39;ve been a happy lesbian all my life, and never once have used any form of birth control. Even if hybrids are possible, I certainly don&#39;t want his were-kids. What would Frances and Martha think when they found out?</i> Samantha asked herself, as William started to rip her clothes off with his new claws.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Eric Anderson had to answer nature&#39;s call.<br />
He got out of bed and opened the door to his room, only to be surprised that all the lights were on in the house despite the late hour.<br />
After using the upstairs hall bathroom, he looked down the stairwell long enough to see that apparently all the lights were on down there as well.<br />
Then he noticed his big brother Nate, sitting on the floor in front of the closed door to their parents&#39; bedroom.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; he asked.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a long story,&quot; replied Nate. &quot;You better sit down and I&#39;ll tell you what I can.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha tensed as William approached. Her back against the tree, she knew he would anticipate a feint to either the left or right as part of any escape attempt.<br />
So she did the unexpected and leaped forward, attacking the werefox with all her werecat strength.<br />
Caught completely by surprise, William fell backwards onto the ground behind him, but Samantha didn&#39;t let up. She jumped on top of William&#39;s chest, knocking  the wind out of him as she grabbed his head in her paws.<br />
Then the werecat banged his skull against the ground a couple of times until the werefox was knocked unconscious.<br />
Samantha stood over her would be rapist, victorious, until she was able to calm down.<br />
<i>Just how many times have you cheated on Martha, you sick son of a bitch, besides the one where you were caught that led to moving your family to Moon Lake?</i> she wondered. <i>The only good thing that came out of that was Martha entering our lives,</i> she thought, thinking about herself and her wife Frances, <i>but we&#39;re all going to have to deal with the consequences of this night soon enough. I hope you&#39;re man or fox enough to face your share of them.</i><br />
Then, after checking to make sure he was still alive, Samantha positioned herself to grab William by the paws before bending down to attempt the classic fireman&#39;s lift maneuver.<br />
With his upper half somewhat against her body and his feet still on the ground, Samantha slowly began walking back to the Andersons&#39; house, the tired werecat dragging the unconscious werefox.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Inside their parents&#39; bedroom, Martha Anderson, now wearing a very nonflattering bathrobe, sat on the bed with an almost empty box of tissues.<br />
While Samantha was out hunting her husband, Frances had been plying her trade as a professional therapist to help console Martha in a difficult situation.<br />
The lady that the two lesbian werecats had more than a passing interest in had poured out her whole life story.<br />
When Martha was out of words and tears, Frances just let her sit there on the bed while staring out the window, waiting for Samantha to come back with the new werefox.<br />
Martha shook her head in disbelief. She never thought her life would fall into such disarray, let alone that she would be friends with a creature that, until the Anderson family moved to Moon Lake, she wasn&#39;t even aware existed.<br />
Then again, Martha also realized that at some point, she would have to confront her growing feelings about Frances and her wife. Human and otherwise.<br />
But not tonight.<br />
&quot;Well?&quot; Martha asked, breaking the silence.<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; said Frances, turning away from the window.<br />
&quot;What should I do?&quot; asked Martha. &quot;About William,&quot; she added quickly, not wanting the attractive red furred werecat to think she was hinting at something else. Even if she was.<br />
<i>That&#39;s a good question,</i> realized Frances. On one hand, Martha the human was vulnerable to exposure until she decided to become a were of her own free will. Yet the ladies were growing greatly interested (falling in love?) in Martha herself, not just the possibility of the housewife joining their pack.<br />
But how could Frances honestly advise her without it seeming like whatever her answer was would benefit the lesbian werecats in the long run?</p>
