<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dustin stepped out of the office building feeling like a new man, again. He couldn&#39;t believe what he had just done, he wouldn&#39;t have had the balls in his old body, and it felt wrong to be using someone else&#39;s for it. At least until he thought about what that someone else had done to him. He knew the two copies thing was a strange request, but he had plans for those.. one for his own viewing pleasure and one to ship off to Cody Santoni. He would do it every time he did a shoot, too, rub it in his face.<br />
<br />
Dustin checked the time on his phone and sighed. Forty-five minutes till his bus came by, he really would have to buy himself a new car, he sold off the old one to pay bills, not like he could have driven it anyway. He looked around for a why to kill some time and spotted a bar across the street.  He stepped in to the place which was mostly empty early in the afternoon on a weekday, but he pulled a twenty from the roll of bills he got from Clyde and set it on the bar, instantly gaining the bartender&#39;s attention. &quot;Whatever stout you have on tap, keep the change.&quot; He&#39;d just nurse the one beer till it got closer to the time his bus would be here and...<br />
<br />
&quot;Cody?! Cody Santoni, you fucker! Long time no see!&quot; It took Dustin a moment to realize the owner of the voice was talking to him, then another to realize it wasn&#39;t angry but amused. Looking down the bar he saw a man about his age, mid-twenties, with blond hair in a short buzz cut. He wore jeans and a black t-shirt that hugged his muscles, he wasn&#39;t as jacked as Dustin, but he was still super fit, his arms stretched the sleeve of that tee dangerously as he lifted an arm to wave. He was good looking, no doubt. Dustin found himself wondering what he looked like with his shirt off, then snapped back to reality.<br />
<br />
&#39;Of course.&#39; Dustin thought to himself, &#39;Some meathead friend of Cody&#39;s Wouldn&#39;t be the type I&#39;d want to know.&#39; He took his beer in hand as it was set down in front of him and smiled politely to the guy. &quot;Sorry, you have the wrong person.&quot; Maybe that would get him to back off, if he wasn&#39;t close enough to Cody to know he lost his body, maybe he wasn&#39;t close enough to be sure he had the right person. Especially with the changes Dustin had made to his style.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot; The guy laughed. &quot;Gave up that Jersey Shore shit, but can&#39;t hide from me.&quot; The guy scooted down a few stools and dropped onto the one right next to Dustin. &quot;C&#39;mon, don&#39;t be like that, man. I know we fell out, but we were best buds for years. C&#39;mon, for old time&#39;s sake?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin sighed. &quot;Sorry, I guess you didn&#39;t hear. I&#39;m not Cody, I got his body in a court settlement. Sorry you had to hear like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man let out a soft whistle. &quot;Damn. No, I didn&#39;t hear. I&#39;ve been deployed the last few months, just got back into town a couple of days ago.&quot; He shook his head. &quot;I always knew Cody&#39;s temper was going to get him in trouble, how long if you don&#39;t mind me asking?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lifetime swap.&quot; Dustin said, keeping his eyes focused on the TV and the game playing on it. The conversation was not one he wanted to have, not with one of Cody&#39;s friends, fallen out or no. &quot;He&#39;s still in county lock up for a few more weeks for throwing a table in the courtroom if you want to go see him.&quot; Normally, Dustin would have been intimidated by the guy sitting next to him, but he was coming quickly to the realization that between the two, he was the bigger guy. It made him feel cocky. &quot;Your friend is a homophobic shit, and he can fucking rot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then Dustin got an answer he wasn&#39;t expecting. &quot;Yeah, I know. But you grow up best friends with a guy and you want to give him all the chances in the world.&quot; The guy sounded resigned, but in that sort of &#39;I tried everything so no fault of mine&#39; way. &quot;I was friends with him through school. We drifted apart when I enlisted then fell out when.. never mind. Name&#39;s Jason by the way.&quot; He held out a hand towards Dustin, who took it and gave it a firm shake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dustin.&quot;  He found himself relaxing as Jason was turning out to be a pretty level headed guy, unlike the friends of Cody he met in the bar last night that only seemed to egg him on. Jason was more of the charming boy-next-door type.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what brings you to a bar in the middle of the day, Dustin?&quot; Jason smirked and sipped his own drink as if he wasn&#39;t doing the same thing himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Had some business in the area, waiting for my bus, they run kind of slow out here, so just killing time.&quot; Dustin took his eyes off the game on the TV and looked over at Jason who nodded thoughtfully. Fuck, he really was good looking, square jaw, dimples when he smiled. He sat somewhere between handsome and cute. He had freckles along his nose and cheeks, and had nice full lips perfect for sucking... Dustin cut off that line of thought. &quot;You?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said, just got back in town, so making the rounds of the haunts to let people know I&#39;m back.&quot; Jason looked past Dustin towards the front window. &quot;Looks like it&#39;s starting to rain. Shitty day for a bus. How about I give you a ride home? Apologize for my old friend&#39;s behavior. I was always cleaning up his messes anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin wanted to say no. He really didn&#39;t want to be involved with anyone from Cody&#39;s life but instead his brain decided, &quot;Sure.&quot; He downed the rest of his beer and Jason finished off the last few sips of his. He took Dustin to an old Civic that had seen better days, but still seemed well cared for. The ride itself was mostly small talk, though turned to what had happened between Dustin and Cody and the court case. Jason offering Dustin all the sympathy, while holding Cody fully to account. It was kind of surprising. Enough that when they pulled up in front of Dustin&#39;s apartment he found himself inviting Jason in for beers. He found he liked this soldier ex-friend of Cody&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Soon, they were both seated on Dustin&#39;s couch, cold beers in hand and Dustin found himself asking. &quot;So, you said you fell out with Cody?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason went quiet, picking at the label of his beer bottle. &quot;Yeah, like I said, we drifted apart when I entered the army. Then... when I was away for the first time on deployment I realized something about myself. That girls just didn&#39;t do it for me. I had my first time with a guy, one of my squad mates and it was.. right. I also figured something else out, and when I got back I confessed to Cody that I had a crush on him. He stopped talking to me after that. I guess it fucked him up more than I...&quot; He frowned. &quot;I actually haven&#39;t seen him since then. That was like six years ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You still picked out his body pretty quick.&quot; Dustin said with a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cody&#39;s a distinctive look.&quot; Jason laughed. &quot;Also, that scar on your forearm, that was my fault, sorry. I&#39;ll tell you the story sometime if you want, but that&#39;s how I was certain.&quot; He sighed though. &quot;Can&#39;t help but thing me confessing to Cody might have fucked him up enough to...&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin shook his head. &quot;No, Cody made his own decisions, and he&#39;s paying for them.&quot; He reached out and put a hand on Jason&#39;s thigh, giving the firm muscle a gentle squeeze. Then lips pressed against his, warm and tasting of beer. He wanted to pull back, but only for a moment and then leaned in to the kiss.<br />
<br />
Finally it was Jason who pulled back. &quot;Sorry, I shouldn&#39;t have done that. I just.. fucking lose my wits when looking at..&quot; He looks right at Dustin&#39;s chest, eyes scanning his body hungrily. &quot;And you just seem so..&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin shut Jason up with another kiss, tongues hungrily exploring each other&#39;s mouths. Both men grabbed at their shirts, breaking the kiss to pull them off and toss them aside. Jason had a diamond of blond hair along his chest and a line going down his stomach, neatly trimmed to an inch in length like the hair on his head. His body was toned and hard.  Though Jason practically purred when he saw the thick pelt on Dustin&#39;s chest, running his fingers through it. &quot;Gotta say, all around you are an improvement.&quot; His fingers found Dustin&#39;s nipple rings and gave them a little tweak as he leaned in for another kiss, causing Dustin&#39;s cock to jump eagerly.<br />
<br />
They began to pull at each others pants, working them off of each other inch by inch until all their clothes were deposited on the floor. Dustin lay on the couch with Jason pressed on top of him, making out and feeling the warmth of their bodies pressed together. &quot;Condom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Oh!&quot; Dustin groped at the floor for his pants, then his wallet inside the pants. He had bough a bunch of condoms when he got his new body, and was definitely glad to be finally using one. Jason plucked it from his hands and slide down until he was sitting on Dustin&#39;s thighs. He rolled the condom over Dustin&#39;s monster cock like a pro. He held the cock in his hands like a trophy, or the Holy Grail.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know it&#39;s big, you don&#39;t have..&quot; Dustin started.<br />
<br />
Jason interrupted with a vehement. &quot;No, I can do it. I&#39;m just savoring the moment.&quot; Dustin guessed he could understand. Years of wanting something to finally have it in front of you. He just hoped this wouldn&#39;t get complicated. Jason got up on his knees, straddling Dustin and began to lower himself onto the ten inches of beast. Jason wasn&#39;t lying when he said he could take it. He lowered himself slowly, gently, but inch by inch Dustin&#39;s cock slid inside of Jason.<br />
<br />
Jason&#39;s own cock with hard as a rock a dribbling pre onto  Dustin&#39;s stomach. It wasn&#39;t small, either. probably seven and a half inches, hard as it was and remarkably thick, foreskin slid back to show a rosy head that was a perfect mushroom shape. Like everything else about Jason it seemed lovingly crafted by hand to be just right. Dustin stuck his finger in his mouth tasting Jason&#39;s pre, salty and slick, with just a little sweetness. With a shock he felt Jason&#39;s pert, round ass settle in his lap.<br />
<br />
What followed was the best ride of Dustin&#39;s life. Not that he had many encounters to go by. When he was younger in his old body he was a bit of a twink and got some closeted jock or other to pound his ass in college. Later on he had a few brief relationships that never went anywhere. But this was something else entirely. Jason rode him like a race horse, sliding up and down his cock and he tried to keep pace, stroking Jason&#39;s cock with one hand and steadying him with his other hand on his lower back. Jason gripped Dustin&#39;s pectorals as he rode him, fingers curling in the thick dark hair as they both worked themselves into a sweat.<br />
<br />
Dustin&#39;s balls started churning and then exploded. For the second time in as many hours he blew his load, and despite the earlier session this one was no less full, in fact, it might have been even heavier, cock twitching as he filled the tip of the condom with his seed. He felt warm splashes of cum against his chest and cheek as Jason released his load as well.<br />
<br />
A few minutes of heavy panting and they both caught their breaths. Dustin grabbed what he thought was one of his socks and cleaned himself off as Jason pulled himself free of Dustin&#39;s softening monster. Jason pulled the condom free and tied it off, examining the load like a fresh caught fish. &quot;Fuck... I need a sec..&quot; He went to the bathroom and tossed it, taking a moment to clean himself off while Dustin still sat in a daze from what was definitely the best sex of his life.<br />
<br />
Dustin grabbed his beer and took a swig, lounging on his couch, not even bothering to get his clothes back on as he might have done once. He had no shame in his naked body. And as Jason came striding back into the room it seemed he didn&#39;t either. Dustin got his first good eyeful of Jason&#39;s body from head to toe. Fit, athletic, it really was like someone sculpted their perfect man then brought him to life, the this man was looking at Dustin like he was having the same thought.<br />
<br />
Jason picked up his beer and sat down on the couch right next to Dustin so their hips touched, and propped his feet up on the coffee table. Dustin found himself putting an arm around Jason&#39;s shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;re your plans for the rest of the day?&quot; Jason asked with a small smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno,&quot; Dustin shrugged. &quot;I was thinking, order a pizza, watch a movie, and may do an encore performance in the bedroom if you&#39;re interested?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason reached down to find his cellphone. &quot;Sure, I&#39;ll buy the pizza.&quot; He looked over to Dustin with a grin. &quot;I&#39;ll even throw in a blow job if you answer the door without pants.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Deal.&quot; Dustin laughed.</p>
