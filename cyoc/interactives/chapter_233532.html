<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle and Mrs. Business entered her bedroom, it was a clean and tight style with minimalist furniture, painted in a shell white. He didn&#39;t see a tv in sight and wondered about that.<br />
<br />
“Well explore that later,” Said Mrs. Business, she started stripping,” Business first, playtime later.” She said sternly. Kyle timidly followed suit, this was all too much for him, but he knew he have to do it, “Now, on the bed Kyle.” He followed orders a little numbly.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Business was an impressive and tall woman, she was slim, with a little bit of belly fat, with C cup breasts, her skin showed some signs of aging, a scare here or there, her face had some laugh lines and crows feet. She stood roughly seven feet tall, even without the heels, it was insulting, all of Kyle&#39;s new feminine halves were at least a foot taller than him, but she was by far the tallest. Kyle awkwardly lay in the bed as she crawled onto it.<br />
<br />
“Now, for a little stimulation.” She cooed as she put her mouth around his cock, Kyle squirmed a little, not that he wasn&#39;t enjoying one of his fantasies come true, but he could taste his own cock through her mouth. She masterfully sucked and licked it until he was finally rock hard. She then brought herself up to him, “And now, the business, or as I like to call it, a hostile takeover.” She mounted him, in the background they could hear the other girls.<br />
<br />
“She just doesn&#39;t stop with the puns!&#39; Mrs. Punk groaned to Mrs. Sport in the kitchen, Mrs. Hippie starting to cook a breakfast for them all. It was at this moment that Kyle&#39;s mom walked into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Good Morning Kayla.” She said to all three of them.<br />
<br />
“Hi mom!” The three of them beamed, acting naturally as if this was normal.<br />
<br />
“Who&#39;s turn is it today?” She smiled<br />
<br />
“Mrs. B has our boy today.” Mrs. Hippie said.<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t see how you all do it, being a hive mind, you can feel that right?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but it&#39;s faded as one of us focuses on sex.” <br />
<br />
Kyle shook his head.<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t worry about them, we know it&#39;s all new. Now enjoy me.” She kissed him, he wrapped his arms around her and started to thrust, “Yes, give it to me, hard as you want, I like it.” She moaned as he pushed his virgin cock into her. It wasn&#39;t long before they were completely unaware of any of their connected minds, lost in bliss as they fucked, Kyle was in heaven, not a trace of fear or angst left in the boy, he finally cam, along with Mrs. B the two of them moaning in pleasure as the climaxed. She rolled over having taken his seed and scooped him up, laying him on top of her, his face pressed into her breasts.<br />
<br />
“I haven&#39;t had sex like that in years Kyle. Thank you, it was wonderful.” She panted. <br />
<br />
“I haven&#39;t had sex before.” Kyle said.<br />
<br />
“Really, you do that like you&#39;ve had plenty, beginner&#39;s luck eh?” She chuckled, Kyle chuckled too. They lay there for a bit, before he finally spoke again.<br />
<br />
“Mrs. B?” He had guessed she&#39;d like that.<br />
<br />
“Yes Kyle?” <br />
<br />
“Um... this is a little awkward but... who were you before?” <br />
<br />
“I&#39;ll tell you in the bath.” She pushed him off and started over to her personal bathroom.<br />
<br />
“In the bath.” Kyle said startled, “Like together?”<br />
<br />
“Yes silly, why can&#39;t we, we just had sex after all.” She smiled at him.<br />
<br />
In the bath Kyle sat in her lap, being washed by her, and he moving around to wash her as well, the tub was luxuriously big.<br />
<br />
“So, in my previous life, the woman who was this body was a Mrs. Lydia Summers. I had been promoted to Branch Manager at that bank where Mrs. Smith works, she wasn&#39;t pleased and my old self was, as you can see, rather forceful. She didn&#39;t take any of Smith&#39;s shit, and nearly demoted her as she tried to sabotage my old self&#39;s career.” Mrs. B explained, “Now she probably complained to her family about me, but the other girls were part of a loosely connected group of friends, different ages and stages of life, we all had our own interests, my old self&#39;s being her career.” <br />
<br />
“Do you um... mind all of this?” Kyle asked as he scrubbed her back.<br />
<br />
“Well I do, being that I&#39;m now a woman subjugated to the will of a young, and let&#39;s admit it, perverted man.” <br />
<br />
“Yeah.” Kyle sighed.<br />
<br />
“But there isn&#39;t really anything I can do about this, even if you or any of us use the curse, the damage is done, and there&#39;s not really a way to undo it. We have to accept our fate.” She sighed as he halted. “No keep going, treat me well.” He continued cleaning her. “The down side is that “my” career is over. But the upside is that I don&#39;t have to worry about aging for a long time, and I get free sex without having to work so hard for it. I mean you were really into it as well.” <br />
<br />
There was a pause. “I&#39;m sorry.” Kyle said.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s not your fault. And I have the feeling I&#39;m going to enjoy being part of your hive mind.” She said. “Now no more regrets, this is us now, let&#39;s enjoy it.” She was quite for a few moments. “And before you ask, this body is 42.”<br />
<br />
“Forty Two!” Kyle said shocked.<br />
<br />
“Oh please don&#39;t tell me I look younger, and let&#39;s face it, you&#39;ve got a step mom kink after all.” The both laughed.<br />
<br />
Kyle felt every movement and breath, feeling her mouth speaking to him, it was surreal, but not as overwhelming as their first meeting. When they had gotten done in the bath, after she dried him off and vice versa, they walked into the bedroom and found that Mrs. Hippie had left them breakfast on the end table. They had vaguely seen that she was doing it, but didn&#39;t think anything of it while they bathed.<br />
<br />
“Ah, Mrs. H left us breakfast, she&#39;s always been so nice. Just wait til you get to her, I hear she&#39;s a little... wild.” She smirked. “Come on, let&#39;s eat.” <br />
<br />
Kyle and Mrs. B spent the rest of the day sitting on the bed chatting and watching daytime tv, he&#39;d never been so fascinated by a soap opera before, but he guessed that being with one of his other halves, he probably was in tune with her. He casually brushed against the other women&#39;s minds, seeing that Mrs. Punk, Sport, and Hippie were outside somewhere.<br />
<br />
“Hey Kyle.” Mrs. Punk said. “What&#39;s up?”<br />
<br />
“Um...” Kyle thought, “Just trying something out.” <br />
<br />
“It&#39;s pretty cool huh? How&#39;s Mrs. B treating you, we haven&#39;t checked in.”<br />
<br />
“She&#39;s really nice.” This received a hug from Mrs. B. <br />
<br />
“He&#39;s a really nice guy when you get to know him.” She thought into their conversation.<br />
<br />
“Hey, I&#39;m trying to read here.”Said Mrs. Goth from somewhere.<br />
<br />
“Why don&#39;t you read to us?” Kyle said. He felt Mrs. Goth hesitate and then begin reading to them, she enjoyed doing it, and the rest of the girls listened, even Mrs. Fashion, who wasn&#39;t really into horror novels. <br />
<br />
“That&#39;s, like, a really weird story.” She said at the end of it.<br />
<br />
“Well it&#39;s a horror novel so it&#39;s supposed to be weird.” Mrs. G said<br />
<br />
“I didn&#39;t say I didn&#39;t like it.” Mrs. F responded.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t until dinner time that the collective got together and started to talk about scheduling who got him and who was affected for the day. Over dinner they decided that the next would be....</p>
