<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You wake up first, wondering why you ache the way you do. The muscles of your lower back and stomach are slightly sore, but it's not exactly an uncomfortable feeling. Instead you feel good, like you just had the best sex ever. That thought brings the events of earlier back to you. <br />
<br />
Now thinking clearly, you decide that things have gone on for long enough you reach for the light and turn adjust the different blue settings until you are back to normal, your breasts gone and the rest of your body fully male. Next you carefully pull back the covers and use the pink setting of the light to restore Stacy's pussy.<br />
<br />
You start to put it back, then smiling wickedly, you get an idea. Turning the light to its highest pink setting you shine it on Stacy's chest, watching as her breasts expand well beyond a d-cup. Shifting in her sleep, Stacy rolls over, her breasts wobbling gently with every movement she makes, her big dark nipples perking up in the cool air of the room.<br />
<br />
Putting the light down you reach out and begin to gently roll one of her nipples between your fingers, causing her to open her eyes with a sleepy smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love it when you play with my breasts like that,&quot; she sighs softly.<br />
<br />
You smile back and start attending to both her breasts, which causes her to arch her back and moan. Her hands slide down between her legs as she begins to pant heavily, &quot;Yeah, just like that. Ooh, it feels so good!&quot;<br />
<br />
She continues to writhe under your ministrations, her hands coming back up from between her legs to rub at her breasts.<br />
<br />
To your amazement, in a few minutes she goes through a full body wracking orgasm, just from having her breasts played with. You begin to let go, but she grabs your hands and presses them hard down against her breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep going,&quot; she hisses, &quot;I'm not done yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright...&quot; feeling more than a little strange, and very aroused you continue to attend to her breasts, her obvious pleasure quickly causing your restored cock to harden. You let go of one of her breasts for a moment to stroke yourself.<br />
<br />
Stacy looks up, puzzled for a moment, then she sees your condition and smiles, &quot;Want to cum on my tits?&quot;<br />
<br />
She carefully spreads her breasts, inviting you to stick your aching cock between them and you're more than happy to comply, mounting her and inching up until your cock is firmly between her breasts. You begin to thrust and she continues to rub and massage her breasts, pressing them tightly against your manhood.<br />
<br />
During this you're sure, based on her writhing and panting that she's orgasmed at least three times before you finally reach your own climax, spraying cum across her breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; you gasp as she lets your softening cock slide free of her breasts.<br />
<br />
She runs a finger through the cum on her chest to rub it on her nipples, &quot;That was amazing.&quot;<br />
<br />
For several more minutes she remains laying there playing with her breasts as you start to get dressed. When she leaves the room to wash up you take the flashlight and put it in your pants pocket.<br />
<br />
When she gets back she starts to get dressed as well and you watch, noting that her fashion sense has changed slightly. The pants she puts on are the same sort of style that she always wears, but her bra is something else entirely. In addition to being a far sturdier style, it's also not the sort of thing she'd normally wear on an ordinary day, black and undeniably sexy, pushing her already impressive breasts up and forward, making her cleavage positively breath taking. The blouse she squeezes herself into is also a surprise, the neckline so low cut that it looks like she's in danger of falling out with every step she takes. Clearly she is unafraid to show off her impossible, porn star breasts. Now that she's standing up you realize just how large they look on her otherwise ordinary and slender body.<br />
<br />
Noticing that you're watching Stacy smiles, &quot;It's a gift and a curse, but mostly a gift. With breasts like these I need to order all order all of my bras. There aren't many girls out there who need triple-d bras after all. I'm so glad that I'm one of the lucky few.&quot;<br />
<br />
She giggles and walks over to you, deliberately moving in a way that makes her breasts shake, and hugs you, pressing her breasts hard against you and rubbing up and down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome,&quot; you laugh, patting the flashlight in your pocket just to be sure it's still there. If using it on her breasts gets results like this, later on you might want to use it on her pussy just to see what that will do.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're awesome,&quot; she smiles letting go of you and bending down to pick up a much smaller, plain white bra, &quot;Letting me and the girls dress you up like a girl yesterday and then wearing a bikini to our pool party. I mean you even wore a bra here today. I like a guy who appreciates breasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And breasts like yours are hard not to appreciate,&quot; you answer truthfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mind if I help you put this back on?&quot; she holds up the bra, your bra.<br />
<br />
&quot;No thanks,&quot; you laugh, &quot;That dress up thing was a one shot deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But no one will see the bra,&quot; she pouts, crossing her arms over her breasts, &quot;And I think it's sexy, pretending that you have tits.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, but just this once,&quot; you've already decided that as soon as you get home you're going to throw the bra out.<br />
<br />
She slips the training bra on you, the small triangles of fabric of its cups pulled flat across your muscular, masculine chest. Taking a step back to get a better look, Stacy nods, &quot;Almost perfect, but not quite. You need a little something to fill it out a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Smiling wickedly, she goes over to her night table, and gets a box of tissues.<br />
<br />
Instead of trying to argue you allow her to stuff tissues into the training bra until Stacy has the cups filled to her liking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect,&quot; she exclaims, putting the tissue box down, &quot;You're now an honorary member of the itty-bitty titty comity.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; you laugh weakly, putting your shirt on and looking down at the two small mounds under your shirt.  You have to admit, she's down a good job of it, if you didn't know better you'd think that you really did have breasts.<br />
<br />
Giving Stacy one last goodbye and, at her insistence, a kiss on each breast as well, you head out to your car and drive home.<br />
<br />
On the drive home you take the tissues out of the bra, planning to take it off once you get home, but once you pull into the driveway your mother is there with a list of chores for you to do, and you spend the rest of the day helping around the house, completely forgetting that you're still wearing a bra until you get undressed to take a shower.<br />
<br />
Amazed that you were able to forget something like that, you take it off and toss it into a corner, rubbing at your chest and feeling strangely naked without it. After wearing it all day you figure that you got used to the feel of it there. Rubbing gently at your chest, waiting for the strange feeling to go away, you take a shower and then go to bed, falling into a deep sleep filled with strange dreams, the most vivid of which revolve around your shopping trip two days ago.<br />
<br />
In the dream you and Stacy are back in the bra store, she's holding a bra of the sort that she would wear, red and black and needlessly lacy, while you're holding a training bra. Stacy is insisting that the training bra is too small for you, and you disagree, pointing to your obviously flat, masculine chest. From there the two of you end up in the changing room of the store. Dream logic being what it is, you're both topless, Stacy's enormous breasts restrained by a bra identical to the one she wants you to wear, while you struggle to put on the white training bra.<br />
<br />
Laughing, Stacy takes the bra for you and begins to suck on your nipples. When she pulls back she smiles, telling you to try to put the training bra on again, that it'll fit perfectly this time. You do as told, and it does. Looking in the mirrors on the walls of the changing room you can see that your nipples have perked up and are visible through the fabric of the bra. Stacy comes up behind you, pressing her breasts against your back and cupping her hands over your chest, saying that your breasts have just started to bud, but soon they'll fill up the cups of the training bra and then you'll need a bigger bra.<br />
<br />
The dream shifts again, Stacy is now completely naked and you're on top of her, your cock between her breasts.<br />
<br />
It's the last part of the dream that lingers with you when you wake up in the morning.<br />
<br />
Rubbing sleep from your eyes, you head to the bathroom. As you walk, you notice how uncomfortable it is to have the fabric of your t-shirt rubbing against your chest.<br />
<br />
After brushing your teeth you stop for a moment to look in the mirror, just to be sure that you really are back to normal, being especially through with your examination of your chest as though expecting to see budding breasts, but there's nothing. Your chest is flat and male, your nipples as small as ever. Still, you don't like the feeling of the fabric of your shirt against your chest and the more you think about it, the more strange you feel about it, like you're half naked.<br />
<br />
Back in your room, you sit down on your bed and stare at the bra Stacy and her the other girls got for you...</p>
