<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A week later...<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you&#39;re sure that this is legit?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim asked his newfound best friend as the two of them exited a train and got off at the station nearest Crafter&#39;s Wellness and Spa. As far as Tim was aware, he had been friends and teammates with Tom Rockman ever since...well, ever. He had no idea his friend was anything but. Least of all that Tom had been just a small kid who had only just seen him visiting a teacher a couple times, enough to develop a crush. But now, the two of them were on the same football team - and surprisingly, Tim had accepted the invitation to visit the supposed magic spa. Not that Tom told him the origin of his knowledge, or the change that he&#39;d undergone.<br />
<br />
Tom today was dressed in a white tank top, blue denim shorts, and sneakers. His shirt was trimmed just enough to give an impression of his chest, and a bit of the oblique area. <br />
<br />
Timothy however was dressed more in a white t-shirt, a denim jacket, jeans, and sandals. He had anticipated something more like the typical chilly SF Weather - whereas Tom knew from the weather forecast yesterday that it would be a warmer set up.<br />
<br />
Timothy Bruner was every bit as attractive as Tom thought of him initially - now that they were more or less on an equal height plane, Tim didn&#39;t seem as huge and muscled as Tom had thought he was. In fact, the kicker was among the slimmer guys on the team. But it was all in the way Tim Bruner carried himself. He didn&#39;t need the widest neck, the biggest pecs, and the broadest arms to be as quietly confident as he was. He just needed to be good at his sport and remarkably well studied, especially for a jock. Tim never needed anyone to step in and give him a boost to his grades, like what you saw in the movies.<br />
<br />
But as Tom and Tim walked out and pressed their clipper cards against the BART Turnstile, there was something that made Tom wonder.<br />
<br />
Timothy unlike most of the guys in the team wasn&#39;t exactly loud about his sexual preferences, one way or the other. A bunch of teenage boys in a locker room or gym, and you&#39;d get some pretty raunchy talk. But Timothy limited it to some chat about potentially having &quot;someone&quot; he was interested in going to prom with. There were rumors about a girlfriend back in eighth grade. But nobody really knew all that much about who Tim liked.<br />
<br />
And more to Tom&#39;s interest, if Tim liked guys or girls.<br />
<br />
Sure, the two of them, they wrestled around. They engaged in all that typical jock horseplay. Jumping up and hugging each other from behind after a long day of running around in the field and training in the yard. They would workout in the school weight room, their shirts off, and they would compliment each other&#39;s body. But Timothy never once engaged in anything overtly homoerotic beyond what amounted to a bunch of guys horsing around...<br />
<br />
And Tom wasn&#39;t willing to push the issue for fear of weirding Tim out with the recontextualization of countless fun times in and around the locker room, field, and in the halls. But he hoped. He hoped that Timothy would be up for something. Whether that took the form of him being secretly gay or bi, or even just being okay with some experimentation, he was fine with it. <br />
<br />
And as the two of them walked up and out of the veritably subterranean Bay Area Transit Station, into the rather crisp and warm air, Tom found himself looking at Timothy Bruner and imagining again. Imagining just how amazing he would turn out in the sauna. Tom still recalled it, despite feeling such a sense of distance from his time as a kid. He remembered how much he&#39;d grown, the muscles, the height, the...the everything! And he was just some kid.<br />
<br />
With Timothy already having an athletic body at the present...wow, it was just...enough to make Tom already start to get a bit of a chub. <br />
<br />
Admittedly, as he watched Timothy remove his denim jacket and wrap it around his waist, Tom was brought back to the times late at night where he would imagine Timothy Bruner in the sauna with him. The two of them sitting there with just their...just their freaking underwear on. And he would get to watch Timothy grow, mature, and muscle up right in front of him. And Timothy would start doing their usual horseplay in the sauna...<br />
<br />
And not even notice Tom was getting seriously hard as the two of them progressed toward their varsity stud years... fuck. Just thinking about the fantasies, and the many sessions of late night masturbation progressed that chub to almost full erection. Thankfully, the two of them passed by an eccentric woman dressed only in a thong and a pink bra, walking through the city street as if it was nothing unusual, her hair dolled up in an impression of a well known doll.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh.&quot; Timothy looked down at Tom&#39;s crotch, and then over at the woman, &quot;You noticed her too, am I right? Or am I right?&quot; Timothy seemed to be pretty interested in her too, and admittedly, she was pretty hot - even if she wasn&#39;t exactly what Tom had been thinking of when he got hard.<br />
<br />
Timothy then joked, &quot;If this what, this super sauna works, and it actually does that...how about we fuckin&#39;...we fuckin&#39; try and find that babe. That lady just showin&#39; it all off and flirtin&#39; around, and we see if she wants to fuck two football guys?&quot; Timothy seemed to be less quiet when he was with someone he trusted as a friend - more eager to let his ideas show. And honestly, Tom was pretty fine with that. It told him a lot about how in with Tim he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah bro, I bet once we&#39;re done she&#39;ll take one look at us and go... HOO BOY, THEY FOINE!!&quot; Tom grinned and kept walking, pumping his arms in an early impression of a double bicep flex. And the two of them laughed and laughed, fist-bumping as they kept on down the street, listening to the sounds of the city. The sizzle of hotdogs being publicly fried up in and on the seasonings. The people hawking some souvenirs in stores along the sides of the streets.<br />
<br />
People showing off collections of watches and necklaces, supposedly home made.<br />
<br />
But they had exactly one destination, given by the impetus of Tom&#39;s earnest and excited testimony - albeit with several facts omitted to avoid sounding like a crazy person. The sun was slightly obscured by tall skyscrapers, and the skyline was full of bright blue sky, with few clouds. This was their spring passing into summer weather. And they got to enjoy it in a big way today.<br />
<br />
As Timothy and Tom opened the doors to the spa and wellness center, Tom put an arm across his friend&#39;s shoulders to no reaction, &quot;Just remember, bro, I got you on this. I made sure I brought money enough for the service.&quot; Indeed, Tom had made sure to keep some of his &quot;allowance&quot;. His &quot;allowance&quot; being larger than what most teenagers earned in an entire week from their small time jobs, granted, but it was always framed as &quot;allowance&quot;. <br />
<br />
Tom, for his part, couldn&#39;t wait for the trustfund - and the fast cars.<br />
<br />
As the two of them entered, Clyde took note - and immediately notified Lilianne, letting her know over the line that &quot;your young customer is back - and he brought a friend&quot;. <br />
<br />
Lilianne had been waiting to see if Tom might ever return, and whether he would bring any friends. Timothy Bruner was a fellow athlete of Tom&#39;s new high school - and the two of them seemed to be in the same grade. Meaning there was little risk for one to end up graduating or something ahead of the other in the midst of the sauna. Tom for his part, as she looked on from her office, seemed...excited. And he had reason to be. The last time, he progressed right up to the teen years. Now he seemed keen on going further.<br />
<br />
Before long, she went down to meet them, teleporting just outside of the front office to make it less...obvious.<br />
<br />
As she walked out, both Tom and Timothy were starstruck immediately. Tom, she knew from experience. Timothy seemed to be likewise a bit eager to see something nice - though he did seem to try to make it a little less obvious. She could still tell by that glint in his eye he liked what he saw. &quot;Ah, my little friend Tom Rockman. How are you doing today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very nice, very nice,&quot; the young man grinned, &quot;I&#39;m back for another session in the sauna. Same as last time. And I have my friend in with me today. This is Timothy Bruner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh, yeah, mm, yeah ma&#39;am, nice to meet you.&quot; Timothy smiled, and Lilianne nodded.<br />
<br />
She led the way down to the sauna - figuring that Tom was probably footing the bill. After all, his parents if they didn&#39;t give him a trustfund yet probably still kept their little teen son flush with cash so he could enjoy his youth. As she presented the sauna doors to the boys, she gestured back at the entrance to the area. &quot;I&#39;ll leave you guys to your sauna experience. I&#39;ve calibrated it exactly as you experienced before, Tom. Always glad to see such a satisfied and happy customer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom grinned and nodded, and watched Lilianne walk out - his eyes on her rear...and then on Timothy, as he watched the object of his queerer affections begin to strip down to his boxers. Tom bit his lip and tried not to make it too obvious, taking off his own shirt and shorts, leaving him in a pair of tighty whities - deliberately picked to be a bit more roomy. Tom didn&#39;t know how much he&#39;d be growing today. But going by Timothy&#39;s choice, he...might have some trouble with tightness down there.<br />
<br />
And so, the two teen jocks walked toward the sauna and opened the doors, breathing in and sighing as they felt the hot air wash over them...</p>
