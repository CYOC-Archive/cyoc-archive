<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Karen Sinclair had to be behind what Chad found in his locker. <br />
<br />
In the times she and Chad had spoken, she gave off the impression that her actual nature clashed with the rigid and regimented lifestyle that her wealthy and extremely conservative parents wanted for her. They were even skeptical and &quot;concerned&quot; about her using make-up! It fit with a fantasy Chad Jones had maintained - the idea of rescuing the beautiful and low key brilliant woman from the clutches of a repressive household, bringing her into his care. It wasn&#39;t even like she&#39;d lack for anything she enjoyed - Chad&#39;s own family was independently wealthy, being nouveau riche as opposed to the old wealth Karen came from.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lover boy...&quot; Chad grinned and pressed the box against his muscular chest. Even though he slept around, primarily maintaining sexual relationships, it wasn&#39;t like he disliked or even looked down on the girls he slept with. He just knew what he was willing and able to provide, and it turned out monogamy just wasn&#39;t his thing. Most people were happy with that - though there were some clingy women who didn&#39;t exactly appreciate it - even when he shared the way he handled things ahead of time.<br />
<br />
Karen deserved a well muscled, tall and handsome knight in shining armor. A man willing to save her from a precarious and superstitious circumstance. To bring her from a stifling life into one where sex was easy, often, and viewed without stigma. And it looked like she was already looking forward to it, instructing him to come out there to the old fieldhouse behind the football field just wearing one of a couple choice items.<br />
<br />
The old fieldhouse had been there since before the school was built.<br />
<br />
It kind of came with the property, being bought along with the school grounds to be. It used to be someone&#39;s supply storage - but now it was cleared out, and mostly saw use as a &quot;love bunker&quot; for the many athletes who used the field. Nobody really restricted who could use it. Whether it be Chad and his many girlfriends, or Ruben Callas and his boyfriend Jeff Hartrew. Ruben was a friend of Chad&#39;s after all. Any homophobia directed at Ruben was basically a declaration of war against the biggest quarterback the football team had in years - who, owing to both that and his membership on the water polo team, knew how to get really rough.<br />
<br />
Still, these were some pretty odd things to potentially wear. But then, she was obviously chafing against her folks. So she&#39;d want to get on the wild side. Chad hadn&#39;t exactly gotten very kinky lately - the majority of his hook-ups being rather vanilla - he was looking to expand his horizons a bit.<br />
<br />
One of them was a green and white speedo that had an eighteen and an upward arrow sign on it. &quot;Cute. And it&#39;s even my age, too, on top of the meaning of that.&quot; He grinned as he sorted through the box further. Another item was a swim team speedo, tight, black, and with what looked like a logo on it - as if in anticipation of Olympics, &quot;Well, if I keep pursuing athletics after high school I&#39;ll probably do football more. But I get it. She might want me to play act like we&#39;re in the Olympic village or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
He sorted through some of the other things, noting a skimpy little loincloth that seemed like it would be expected for some barbarian hero in one of the sword and sorcery novels that his nerdy tutor always enjoyed. &quot;Beth always loved those things. A sword wielding barbarian, an evil sorcerer, and usually an ass-kicking female barbarian...&quot; He couldn&#39;t deny it - he saw the appeal. &quot;Hmm...&quot; He then picked out a pair of bodybuilding posing briefs. &quot;I get it. I&#39;m pretty built. But probably not as built as some of those muscle monsters. But if she wants me to flex and preen, I won&#39;t deny her that.&quot;<br />
<br />
The last item in the kink box that Chad pulled out looked like some kind of combination loincloth with a belt of wolf fur - he assumed it was imitation - around the top. &quot;Werewolf play? Well, the Full Moon&#39;s in a week. But I guess she wants to get this going sooner rather than later.&quot; As he put everything back in neat and orderly, Chad wondered which one he was going to go with. Each had some interesting erotic potential, and stirred up a response already.<br />
<br />
His jeans were tented by a very robust erection, one that alluded to a long and passionate affair tonight. &quot;Karen Sinclair, you&#39;ll love what you get from me tonight!&quot; Chad murmured to himself. But, seeing as he had some time, he figured he needed to take the edge off. And seeing as it was break between classes, and he had the time...well. Why not? <br />
<br />
Putting the Kink Box into his backpack, Chad went into one of the bathrooms nearby, straight into one of the far stalls as he readily took off his polo shirt and let his jeans and boxers fall to the floor. Gifted with an eight incher already, Chad looked forward to seeing how Karen would handle it. Pressing his back against the wall and locking the stall door, Chad sighed as he leaned into his fantasies - of a grateful Karen Sinclair and he enjoying freedom in his house - the freedom to fuck.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
Thankfully he wasn&#39;t late to his next class after spending five minutes of his break just getting a handle on himself.<br />
<br />
By the time school was over, Chad swaggered over toward the field, and off past that toward the fieldhouse. The place was given some natural cover with some trees and a naturally hilly environment that meant he could change clothes into whichever item from the Kink Box he chose. He tilted his head as he sorted through them again. He didn&#39;t know what they meant - except of course for this meaning some fun was in his future.<br />
<br />
Once he was behind one of the trees, off came Chad&#39;s polo and jeans, leaving the young man standing there, a statuesque bastion of rippling male muscularity in a pair of sneaker shoes. But even those before long were shed, and his boxers not long after. Now he had to choose something to wear for his kinky date. His finger tapped his chin a few times as he deliberated. He didn&#39;t even mind being naked out here like this.<br />
<br />
Chad had nothing to hide physically. He had one of the best bodies among the jocks - and he was damn proud of that. Some people looked askance at a man that had pride in his physical beauty. But Chad saw nothing wrong with that. After a regretfully dorky few middle school years, he&#39;d made the effort and improved himself. Became a powerful, stunning physical specimen. &quot;Man, she&#39;ll be delighted to see this gorgeous body striding in wearing one of these things!&quot;<br />
<br />
A quick flex of his chest, abs and then his biceps. Chad then went ahead and chose...</p>
