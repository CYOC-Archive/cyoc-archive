<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With a smile and an apology, Ben excused himself from the conversation about girlfriends with three of his coworkers and stated his intentions to use the restroom, pocketing three more of those delicious lumpia the catering group had brought to the corporate Christmas party.  Placing them in the warmed bag in his shoulder pack along with the few appetizers, chicken wrap, and yogurt bowl that he had already taken, the man calmly and quietly turned the opposite way and entered the storage room he had become quite acquainted with ever since the Fusion Wave hit.<br />
After asking if anyone was present, and making sure no one was, Ben unzipped his hoodie and pulled up his very loose red shirt.  Pulling the ginger hair away from her reddened face, the beautiful lady gasped for fresh air - the current bootleg gas-mask + breathing tube solution only could work for so long.<br />
<br />
Flustered, the man scratched the back of his head - &quot;God, I&#39;m sorry I took so long - I couldn&#39;t get out of a conversation with Kade.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ohhh . . . no worries Ben.  I shouldn&#39;t be preventing you from living life like you did before.&quot; - there was not a hint of contempt or irritation on the sweaty face of the woman.<br />
&quot;I know you said that you&#39;d eat later - but I felt your stomach rumbling and I couldn&#39;t hold back - I got you a snack.&quot;<br />
&quot;Gee, thanks!  It&#39;s more like a feast!&quot; - Using her two shrunken, hip-attached arms that had been pressed against Ben&#39;s sides and under the oversized hoodie he wore for the last hour, the ginger dug in as Ben sat down on a stool, sighing as he rested his head against the wall.<br />
<br />
After pausing to wipe her mouth with a provided napkin, dismayed, the woman looked down before leaning the unattached portion of what remained of her back against Ben&#39;s stomach, laying her head and locks on his lower chest.  Quietly, she talked to him.<br />
&quot;Babe, we can&#39;t keep doing this.  I&#39;m destroying your mental health.  Your relationships.  Your work.  Your chance at a normal life.&quot;<br />
Ben rose his hand to caress her cheek, sighing again - &quot;Celia, I&#39;m sorry, but we can&#39;t - you told me before to remind you whenever you didn&#39;t want to continue, remember?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; - they both said at once - &quot;Kent will get the wrong idea . . .&quot;<br />
<br />
Contrary to what the nature of the couple&#39;s transformation and their efforts to hide it seem to suggest, a karmic punishment had not befallen Ben and Celia - Celia never would have betrayed Kent, and Ben was too good a man to be adulterous.<br />
Four months before, Ben had visited Celia after work to see her for the first time in seventeen years - his old friend Kent had moved back into town and had become a coworker at Ben&#39;s accounting firm a week before.  Coming with him was the undeniable MILF, a even older friend of Ben&#39;s.  You see, when they were all in high school, when Celia was one of the prettiest girls on campus, and when Ben&#39;s frame was considerably slimmer than it was just before the Wave, Ben and Kent&#39;s great friendship had splintered into open hostility as they fought for Celia&#39;s love.  It took two years for the tension to simmer down and another for the hatchet to finally be buried when Ben let Kent win - on the condition that he&#39;d treat her like his queen.  And so he did, building a house, fathering a wonderful kid (that Ben was the godfather to), and moving away to find better work a few years later.<br />
Getting back to it, Ben had only planned to stay for a half hour to catch up with Celia - but the conversation was just too good to end.  Celia was preparing dinner for Kent before he came home and offered Ben to stay as well - when the Fusion Wave hit.<br />
<br />
Knocked to the ground by the force of the blast, initially unchanged, Ben was left only to watch as Celia fuse with the family dog, Jake, a faithful Doberman Shepherd.<br />
As Ben lay stunned, the fur raced up Celia&#39;s body. Screaming as Jake whimpered, fusing to her legs, the scant hairs on her arms and neck thickened into the sleek browns and blacks, puffing out her dress and blouse as they grew around her chest and stomach.  As Jake breathed his last before what was left of him completely dissolved, Celia groaned as her bones popped and cracked to her slight discomfort, becoming longer, sleeker, and stronger.  Ben, kneeling over her, bewildered as to what to do, was there to see up close her hands and feet slightly stiffen and grow light dark pads and claws, their thumbs receding in placement slightly.  The partial paw-hands and paw-feet do help with Celia&#39;s running, and thankfully are still able to function like a normal human&#39;s - but to some difficulty.  <br />
Watching as the skin under her new fur turn black, and her face barely push out into a tiny snout as her nose blackened and pointed, Ben thought it was finished.  But Celia whined in a manner that was both very human and dog as her ears pointed and furred, moving to the top of her head.  Opening her barely extended mouth, Celia&#39;s teeth sharpened and shifted to an intermediate between human and dog as her tongue lengthened and lolled.  The swishing Doberman tail that had grown above Celia&#39;s behind, lifting up her dress, began to extend backwards before an astonished Ben.  Shredding her underwear and revealing the placement of an anus and vagina characteristic of a female dog, Celia&#39;s behind began to push out, forming a sort of an identically-furred torso, and growing nubs that soon lengthened into identically-furred legs.<br />
Ben jumped back as Celia hopped to her feet in a flash struggling only momentarily for balance, her arms outstretched to her sides - somehow, there were now four, which seemed now appropriate considering the six breasts that now clearly resided on both the intermediately half-dog-half-woman&#39;s upper and back (taur) torso. <br />
The very last change presented itself with an audible schlorp and a gasp from a panting Celia.  Bending her torso downward, her now brunette hair mopping the floor, she exclaimed as the very long, very erect half canine, half human penis attached to the front of her rear groin bobbed, throbbing.<br />
Looking up, with her tongue still lolling as she panted, the two stared at each other in uncomfortable, bewildered silence until, shocked, Celia quickly brought her hands to her mouth to stop herself from panting.</p>
