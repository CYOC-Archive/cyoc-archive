<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Gloria now tried to figure out what to do with Mika’s newly youthened parents, Sasha was continueing to talk with Hideo. “Wow what’s up with me,” Sasha thought as her cheeks flushed. “This guy is not my type. He’s studious, polite, dressed preppy and.....really cute.” Sasha smiled shyly as Hideo continued to talk. “Man I really wish we were old enough to go on an actual date.”<br />
<br />
As Sasha thought those words she felt an odd tingle envelope her. Looking herself and Hideo over she was shocked to see that the two of them were actually growing older. Alarmed she looked back towards Gloria, who was talking with her friends and Reiko. “How,” she thought. Looking down at her hands Sasha was surprised to see the Ring of Age on her finger. “When did this get here,” she mused as she and Hideo became 18. Sasha couldn’t help but admire their growing bodies. Sasha had begun to fill out, instead of a skinny 14 year old she now possessed slight curves and c cup breasts that were continueing to fill out. As she looked at Hideo she was pleasantly surprised to see the boy becoming more muscular. Hideo’s muscle mass continued to increase, taking on a slim yet athletic look.<br />
<br />
As the two crossed the line from teen to twenties their bodies continued to mature. Sasha now possessed generous curves with large and full c cup breasts. Hideo was now a very handsome college student. Hideo possessed a slim yet muscular look with a firm chest and slightly long dark hair. As the two finally completed progressing Sasha found herself an attractive dark haired girl with ample curves while Hideo appeared to be a fit, professional young man with a handsome face. “So,” Hideo said smiling. “Care to grab a coffee with me.” Sasha nodded her head in a daze as she leaned against Hideo. “Not sure how this happened but I’m rolling with it,” she thought. Sighing happily she now walked with Hideo as the two left the park.<br />
<br />
While Hideo and Sasha were enjoying an impromptu date Gloria was contemplating turning Mika’s parents back. After talking with Reiko they found they really enjoyed the girl. Reiko was a slightly timid yet polite girl that Gloria could easily find herself being friends with. Reiko seemed to be getting along fantastically with Diane and Felicia as she happily talked with the two girls. “Gloria,” Jackie said quietly. Gloria shook her head as if coming from a daze. “Gloria listen,” Jackie said firmly. “Look Reiko is really cool and all but maybe we should change her back now. I’m starting to get nervous that we could kinda mess things up.” Gloria nodded, Jackie had a point. “Your always the sensible one Jackie,” she smirked. Quietly she now wished for Reiko and Hideo to grow back up. As she watched Reiko she began to wonder why the girl wasn’t growing up. Confused she now looked down towards her hand, gasping in alarm.<br />
<br />
“Where’s my ring,”<br />
<br />
Jackie and Gloria’s faces went pale as they frantically began searching the ground. Unable to see it the girls looked to where Sasha and Hideo were only to see the two had vanished. “Where’s the ring,” Jackie hissed. “And where did Sasha go.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know,” Gloria stammered. Jackie’s eyes went wide as she frantically began looking between Gloria and her friends. “Call Mika NOW,” she demanded. Gloria nodded. Quickly she now pulled out her phone, sending Mika an urgent message. Gloria was hesitant to call Katie just yet, she worried Katie would be angry with her. She now hoped Mika would be able to help her out. After only a few moments Mika magically appeared in front of the girls. “Well got your message,” she smiled. “So what’s up?”<br />
<br />
Gloria and Jackie sheepishly looked towards Reiko, unable to answer Mika’s question. “Umm whose the new girl,” Mika asked curiously. “She looks kinda familiar.” Mika now approached the young Asian girl, still unsure who she was. “Hey new girl,” she said. “What’s your name?”<br />
<br />
“R..Reiko,” she said shyly. “Reiko Mishima.”<br />
<br />
Mika’s eyes went wide as she spun around to face Gloria. “What. The. Hell,” she exclaimed. “You made MY MOM a kid!!!”<br />
<br />
“Um I can explain,” Gloria said quickly. “Make it fast,” Mika said, obviously annoyed. Gloria now began fidgeting in place as she tried to explain her actions. “Well it’s  like this,” She started. “Katie told me how your parents weren’t so thrilled about white people or you being bisexual so we um, wanted to make them...our age. We kinda thought we could maybe change their minds.”<br />
<br />
Mika groaned as she now rubbed her eyes. She appreciated the gesture but it wasn’t a dangerous gamble, Gloria was still too new when it came to useing the ring. “Look Gloria,” She’s sighed. “I appreciate that, it’s very sweet but I don’t think it will work. Just....change them back okay.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah that’s the second problem,” Gloria said sheepishly. “My um ring...it..Uh..kinda vanished.”<br />
<br />
“Mika’s eyes went wide as she now gaped at the 14 year old version of her mother. “That’s not the only problem,” Jackie added. “Your dad vanished alongside with Sasha and umm...it kinda looked like you’re dad had the hots..for Sasha.”<br />
<br />
Mika groaned as she now looked the girls over. “Okay this is bad,” she sighed. “We need to find my dad and Sasha now. And I’m probably going to need some help.” Jackie and Gloria gave each other looks of concern as they slowly nodded. Before the girls could answer though they noticed a ripple begin to travel through the air. As Mika, Jackie, and Gloria watched it approach an odd feeling crept over them. When the wave passed over them Mika shuddered slightly. “The hell was that,” She’s muttered. Gloria and Jackie shrugged before gaping at Mika.<br />
<br />
Mika’s features began to change. Jackie and Gloria watched as Mika’s skin tone lighten as her face began to change. Mika’s Asian features began to soften, the shape began to change, looking less Japanese and more Caucasian. “Um Mika,” Gloria stammered. “Uh..I think you need to check yourself out.”<br />
<br />
Mika gave the girls an odd look as she produced a mirror from  her purse. Opening her compact Mika stared at her reflection before screaming. “Holy Shit,” She’s yelled. “I’m half white!!!” Mika stared dumbfounded at the girls as she tried to piece things together. From what she could remember her parents began dating in high school. The two had only ever been with one another. While the story was cute and endearing in an  old fashioned sense Mika had always found it quite lame. Now, somehow, her history was being altered. If her father was falling in love with Sasha then it could be possible her appearance was being affected.<br />
<br />
“Ugh why does this weird magic shit always happen to me,” She’s groaned. Trying to maintain her composure in front of the girls Mika let out a deep sigh. “Okay we gotta find your friend and my dad quick,” she stated. “Somehow the ring is affecting me as well as my parents. If things keep going like this I’m pretty sure your friend will become my new mom.”<br />
<br />
Gloria, Jackie, and Mika now began trying to come up with a plan to change Mikas parent she back before any More damage was done.</p>
