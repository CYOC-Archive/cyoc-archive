<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen got up, the constant tingling in her tongue greeting her. Unlike most mornings, though, she was wide awake, no coffee needed. Something was definitely wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;My tongue is thwollen!&quot; she said, her tongue&#39;s overnight growth obvious in her newfound lisp. She bolted over to her mirror and opened her mouth. She was greeted by a truly massive tongue sitting in the middle of her mouth, taking up far more than its fair share of it. She stuck it out, amazed at how far it stretched. She could lick her chin and nose with ease, whereas before she&#39;d had no chance. She could even lick her elbow without even trying! Just as she finished that, she felt the tingling begin again, but now even stronger. She watched with tears in her eyes as her tongue slowly expanded before her very eyes! She watched as it grew, and felt it push along her bottom teeth as its base increased in size. Just as soon as the more powerful tingling began, it stopped. Her tongue completely filled her bottom jaw now!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, thith ith great!&quot; she said, finding talking now increasingly difficult with her new tongue. It filled her mouth completely, begging to be let out, as if Jen were some kind of dog.<br />
<br />
She began to cry, but quickly pulled herself together. &quot;Come on, Jen, we can&#39;t lose composure now! We have to figure out what&#39;s causing this!&quot; she thought to herself. She quickly got ready for school, and decided she wanted to see a doctor about her swollen tongue. However, when she got downstairs, she realized her mom wasn&#39;t there! &quot;Great, the mutht habe already gone to work,&quot; Jen muttered, upset by her new thick lisp. She then saw a note that said that her mom was out of town for work, and her dad decided to go with her, leaving Jen to man the house alone for the next week. &quot;I gueth I&#39;ll go talk to the nurthe,&quot; she sighed.<br />
<br />
When she got to school, she headed directly for the nurse&#39;s office. However, ironically, a sign on the door said the nurse was out sick today. And unfortunately for Jen, today was a Friday. She groaned, and headed to her first class: English 12. Mrs. Tamm was having them read out lines from Hamlet as theatrically as a group of disinterested 12th graders could.<br />
<br />
Jen sat down in the circle of students as they went around the room, each trying to one up the last. Jen was lucky in that she sat in the position which was last to speak, and she was saved by the bell. Her next few classes went without worry until Chemistry, when she remembered she had a presentation to give in her next and last class, Spanish. &quot;Damnit,&quot; she thought, wondering how she was going to get out of this. Just as she exited into the hall, the tingling began again. Jen took this as an excuse to go to the bathroom. Bolting to the single-use bathroom, she got there just as someone else was leaving... her girlfriend, Bri!<br />
<br />
Jen pushed her back into the bathroom and slammed the door shut.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, whoa, Jen, what&#39;s up?&quot; Bri said, surprised at the rash actions of her partner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ith... my tongue. Ath you can probably hear, it&#39;th thwollen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, dude, definitely. It&#39;s peaking out a little.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen looked down. Sure enough, her tingling tongue poked out from her lips slightly. The tingling increased in severity, and her tongue started to grow. Visibly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen, what the fuck!&quot; Bri screamed as Jen panicked, her tongue poking further and further out. Jen felt the base of her tongue swell, pushing her teeth to the side, ruining her perfect smile. She began to cry as the tingling didn&#39;t let up for minutes, and now her tongue flopped out of her mouth uncontrollably. She sobbed as it continued to grow for what felt like hours, becoming thick and heavy in and out of her mouth. The tingling subsided slowly, disappearing for now.<br />
<br />
Bri stared in amazement before saying under her breath, &quot;fuck, that&#39;s hot.&quot; Jen stared at her aghast, opening her mouth to protest only to have more tongue pour forth. She pulled her tongue back into her mouth as best she could, but it was no use. Her tongue was too big for her mouth now! She pushed it further in with her fingers, but felt Bri&#39;s hand touch hers, holding it in place.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Jen. Let it be free,&quot; she said, coyly. Jen obliged, putting her hands down and letting her tongue fall from her mouth. It had to be almost half a foot long now, and that&#39;s only counting what was coming out of her mouth! Jen opened her mouth as wide as she could as Bri eagerly looked in, seeing her tongue completely fill her mouth. She saw Jen&#39;s now crooked teeth, her tongue almost making eating impossible.<br />
<br />
&quot;What am I going to do?!&quot; she sobbed. Bri snapped out of her newfound lust and hugged her friend, patting her on the back.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be ok, Jen,&quot; she said, hoping the sympathy she intended came through. She put her hand on Jen&#39;s chin, careful not to touch her now slobbering tongue, and pulled it up to look at her. She pressed her forehead to Jen&#39;s, and Jen felt instant relief. Even with her new gargantuan tongue, she thought, her girlfriend still loved her! Hell, Jen couldn&#39;t deny the surprised lust in Bri&#39;s eyes at her growing tongue, and that kind of turned her on, too. &quot;Maybe this tongue growth wouldn&#39;t be so bad...&quot; she thought, watching as her girlfriend&#39;s vision settled on the tongue resting on Jen&#39;s bosom. Jen flicked her heavy tongue up, licking her girlfriend&#39;s face. Bri giggled, and could see the panic disappear from Jen&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to be ok after all,&quot; Jen thought. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said as best she could, and in response Bri hugged her. The muffled bell told them that somehow an hour had passed, so they bid adieu, Jen heading to her empty-for-the-week home for the weekend, now eager to see what would happen.</p>
