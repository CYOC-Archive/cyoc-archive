<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">May eventually arrived. And school was drawing to a close. How was he going to tolerate being alone all summer long. The short breaks over Thanksgiving, Christmas and Spring Break were intolerable but this was going to be several months.<br />
<br />
As the school closed for the summer Mika sat there in the dark just hoping for someone to come and use him. It was the only bit of human contact he had and began to crave it. The fat janitor would come and piss in him or one of the other urinals from time to time but not nearly enough.<br />
<br />
About a week after summer vacation began the hidden panel to his cage opened and he saw light. There reaching in to him was his teacher, Mr. Spencer. He unhooked the hose leading to Mika&#39;s mouth and the drains from his cock and ass.<br />
<br />
As he positioned Mika around on the rolling dolly he had been on for most of the school year he then began to put up walls around him and a lid on top.  Mika felt himself being rolled out of the pen he had been held in and down the school halls. Or at least that is what he believed. He was still securely restrained just as if he were still at the urinal but boxed up and rolling along. Mika felt himself going up a ramp and then the movement stopped.<br />
<br />
There was some rumbling around him and then it stopped. He felt the container on the move again down a hill and then up another hill. He came to a stop and pounding began on the container he was in. There in a sterile white tiled room Mika found himself once again in front of his teacher Mr. Spencer.<br />
<br />
You have developed very well piggy. Your time at school has taught you well. <br />
<br />
Mika felt his mouth still held open with the tube going down his throat and a hollow gag strapped to his head. <br />
<br />
Would you like to take this off boy?<br />
<br />
All Mika could do was move his eyes up and down. He couldn&#39;t even shake his head to say yes.<br />
<br />
As Mr. Spencer took off the gag and pulled out the tube that went down directly into his stomach Mika once again felt his jaw. But having been held open for so long he couldn&#39;t move it much and he was completely unable to talk. He made a few guttural sounds and Mr. Spencer asked if he was thirsty. Mika once again nodded his eyes to say yes.<br />
<br />
Mr. Spencer unzipped his pants and pulled out his cock and shoved it in Mika&#39;s mouth.<br />
<br />
This wasn&#39;t what Mika had expected but he began sucking like he was a pro at it. Soon Mr. Spencer came shooting deep in Mika&#39;s mouth and then remaining still lodged deep down Mika&#39;s mouth when a warm stream of pee started to flow down his throat. Mika could&#39;t believe he was enjoying this.<br />
<br />
As Mr. Spencer finished and zipped up he began to inspect Mika inch by inch. Mika had softened up after almost a year of no activity. His arms and legs were spindles but his belly had become so bloated that it looked like he was 12 months pregnant with triplets. <br />
<br />
Nice container Mr. Spencer said as he squeezed Mika&#39;s belly. All nice and stretched ready for the real workout.<br />
<br />
Mika&#39;s eyes got wide.<br />
<br />
Don&#39;t worry it isn&#39;t going to be now. Lets drain the tank. He started to feed a catheter up Mika&#39;s penis and he began to release a stream of pee into a drainage hole located in the middle of the white tiled room. Now there wasn&#39;t a lot of shit to expel from Mika but the goo that was fed into him with did make a bit of a bm. Mr. Spencer fed a hose up Mika&#39;s ass and hosed him out. Also draining into the drain in the room.<br />
<br />
As he emptied Mika fully he once again began inspecting Mika and his belly felt very loose now and very empty.<br />
<br />
I&#39;ve got an open house this weekend and everyone is ready to see my new urinal. I have been telling the boys all about it. But we have a few days to get use to each other.<br />
<br />
The days passed and Mika once again was able to speak even though much of his vocabulary was lost having not spoken in all the time at school. His first words were Why Mr. Spencer?<br />
<br />
And Mr. Spencer said you know why. This was your dream. You told &quot;Forever&quot; that you loved to be dominated. Now you are. Your first training has been to take massive amounts of piss. Your body has adjusted to this by losing all muscle tone and stretching out your belly to hold all of a man&#39;s fluids that we wish to fill you with.<br />
<br />
Your Ass will be stretched out next in order to accommodate a man&#39;s cock initially then we will graduate to dogs and then see where we go from there.<br />
<br />
After that we will see where we can take you.<br />
<br />
But Mr. Spencer...<br />
<br />
That is a good start. Mr. Spencer is ok when we are alone, Sir in public or Master will be more appropriate. And severe punishment will ensue if you disobey.<br />
<br />
Being allowed to be released might be a gift I will give to you if you behave but you must show me you are willing to learn. Now open up I have to make sure you are ready for the weekend.</p>
