<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Oh, crap, Odette thought as she stared at her breasts.  They were enormous.  Rapping her arms around her breasts she was able to just clasp her hands around the opposite wrist.  As she sat on the floor her breasts hung down and touched her thighs.  They were firm and round and smooth.  Rubbing her hands over the skin she could not feel a single stretch mark or blemish.  It was a testament to her imagination that she could have made them this big.  To Odette, breasts only ever got as big as the double D-cup bras she had seen at the end of the rack, while shopping.  She had known that breasts could be bigger, but that was for fat people and augmented women.  Odette had never imagined that she herself could ever have breasts that were larger than her head.<br />
<br />
She tried to stand.  Getting to a squatting position was the first step.  Bending forward was limited by breast flesh.  She eventually got her legs under her butt and started to rise.  The weight of her tits pulled her in a number of ways that were not as she had ever experienced.  Her breasts did not feel to heavy on her shoulders but they way in which they stuck out was enough to cause to pitch forward violently if she leaned to far.  Standing up right she thrust her hips forward to put her center of gravity back between her feet but this caused her mounds to bulge outward and upward.   This was not good, she thought as she tried to see over the crest of her breasts by craning her neck.  Righting herself slowly to avoid falling, Odette found that she could stand almost straight up even if her back was ached horribly.  She surmised that she may not have imagined the correct weight for her breasts but that she was fine with having light boobs.  Despite this she still found the need to support them with her hands from bellow, as if they would fall off otherwise.<br />
<br />
In her mirror her arms were obscured by the breasts.  They stretched from one side of her body to the other and seemed to hide everything from her armpits to her navel.  Odette wondered if she had a shirt big enough to fit over these massive globes.  This thought was quickly tossed out as she was dead-set against leaving her room until they were gone.<br />
<br />
Laying on the bed Odette found her breasts rose above her like two mountains in the distance.  She humorously thought of having snowy glaciers forming on the top of her nipples.  Lifting her head onto a pillow allowed her the sight of nothing but her breasts.  These were too large for everyday wear, she thought, but it is good to know that i could have them if I wanted.  Her mind was buzzing, wondering just what was the limits of her breasts, or indeed all of her body.  She had made her legs longer yesterday but only by a few inches.  Could she add feet to her height or would she just fall over?  What would happen if she became so tall that her bones could not support her?  She shuddered at the thought and resolved to take things slowly from now on.<br />
<br />
After a half hour of trying to fall asleep Odette started moving around her room.  It was no use trying to nap, she had had one earlier and she was just too awake.  It also did not help that her masturbatory session had left her feeling energetic.  She did the next best thing.  She cleaned her room trying to find an old stretchy shirt she could use to cover herself.<br />
<br />
Downstairs the phone rang.  It stopped when someone answered it and minute later there was a soft knock on her door.  &quot;Odette, are you sleeping?&quot;  It was her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Mom,&quot;  she called out in a panic.  She still did not have a shirt.  She quickly dove for the bed and hid under the covers.  Although this simple action was made all the more difficult by the addition of her inflated bosom.  Her breasts bounced and knocked about each other and prevented her arms from doing the things they needed to.  Trying to hide her breasts with the covers was also difficult.  On her back they stuck up too high to be anything other than large mounds that dwarfed everything else.  Sitting she would have to hold the covers up to her neck and scrunch forward but the breasts would still poke out the front and sides.  On her front she might be able to pass the breasts off as pillows that she was laying on but then she would still have no top.  This all passed in an instant of panic and fright that was halted immediately.<br />
<br />
&quot;You locked the door, honey,&quot; her mother said as the knob rattled.  &quot;Is there something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Mom.  I just did not want to be disturbed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well the phone was for you.  It was Jimmy.  I told him you were sleeping and that you would call him back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, I will.&quot;  Odette was relieved when she heard her mother move away from the door.  Her heart was pounding in her chest and adrenalin was coursing through her veins.  She would not be able to get to sleep now.  She would have to find something to cover herself then she could call Jimmy.</p>
