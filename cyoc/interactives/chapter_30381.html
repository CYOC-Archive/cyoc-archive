<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>A flash of light produced another five-dollar bill out of thin air. It landed lightly on the table next to the original. Tricia picked it up in her black-furred hands and found it to be a flawless copy. She didn't need to work at that drab grocery store now!
<P>Her smile turned to a frown. Her examination of the note led her eyes to the serial number. It was the exact same on both fives. Sure, she could probably get away with it in most cases, but if she tried to deposit a bunch of them at the bank she'd get in serious trouble.
<P>But then another idea hit her. Did she really need to buy anything? If the remote could duplicate money, it could duplicate food. She knew it could already generate clothing and modify existing objects. The remote could provide for her all on its own!
<P>She opened her fridge and took out a carton of milk. It was already opened, but that didn't matter as long as it hadn't expired yet. She copied the carton and then picked up the new duplicate. She sniffed it. It smelled okay. She took a few test sips and didn't find anything wrong with it. After a few generous gulps, she licked her black lips and put both cartons back in the fridge.
<P>Tricia spent the next half-hour experimenting with the decorations. She accidentally created curtains that were way too long, and then got the hang of the size adjustment buttons. It was difficult, but she managed to double the size of her bathroom and put in a jacuzzi next to the shower. She reshaped some of her solid-backed chairs to have a hole in the middle so that her tail could hang out the back.
<P>Then her mind settled on her wardrobe. With her black fur she wouldn't need much in the way of insulation. She'd almost feel fine going out nude, though even the remote might not be able to let the general public accept that. She examined her body in the full-length bedroom mirror. It was almost perfect. Almost.
<P>Tricia giggled as she rubbed her arms and felt the strange sensation of rubbing against the fur, then the pleasant feeling of straightening the fur back out. The long red feathering she had created on her forearms was a bit much, though. She remembered that during lunch she had to be very careful to keep them from falling onto her crumby plate or in her drink. Nice though they were, she could live without them. One zap of the remote later, and the long, fine red hair had receded completely into her wrists and ankles, leaving her arms and legs covered only in the regular short black fur.
<P>She removed her socks and looked at her two-toed feet, tipped in their red nails. They looked a little boring now without the feathering. She shrugged as she adjusted the "RBCow1" setting and then shot herself again. She quickly backed up and onto her bed to let her legs reshape themselves without tipping her over. She didn't feel pain, but a slight numbness and uncomfortable shifting within her legs as her feet thinned and lengthened. Her heel became a new, second "knee" as her toenails grew and covered her toes with solid red cloven hooves. Her legs had now become similar to the hind legs of a cow.
<P>She carefully placed her new hooves on the carpet and tried to stand. Balancing was a little difficult, and she took a few practice paces around her room.
<P>The room looked a little different to her now, and as she thought of balancing on her hooves she realized why. The adjustments she made to her legs had raised her height. She guessed she had gained three or four inches. "That's why I'm having so much trouble," she said. She quickly punched the size button on the remote and fired. She felt dizzy for only a second before everything felt natural again. Her walking was still a little awkward, but now that she was back to 5'4" it was much easier to get the hang of it.
<P>Now she wanted a slight change of dress. Her plain tee shirt and shorts seemed boring on her wildly inhuman body, and her little shrinking spell made them look a tad big. She searched for some better options in the remote's menu. After a time, she had found an outfit she liked, one that covered her enough to be seen in public, but didn't hide too much of her spectacular body. She also had a sinister little inspiration of her own and added some slightly unusual accessories to her choice.
<P>She again stood in front of her mirror and shot the remote at her reflection. Instantly her clothes were transformed into the new outfit she had picked. Instead of a tee-shirt, she was wearing a dark purple shell top that snuggly covered her chest, held up by four spaghetti straps and ending just low enough to show off her thin, furry midriff. The bra underneath was black, blending into her fur so its straps could barely be seen. Her shorts were now a short purple skirt held by a tight black belt with a silver buckle. Of course, there was a hole in the back for her tail.
<P>That wasn't all, though. Her limbs were now adorned with bracelets and anklets, each made of thick black leather with silver pointy studs. There was no hook or buckle to remove them, only the remote could do that. However, each one had a silver rectangular link dangling from it. Tricia's naughtiest thoughts pondered the attachments these could accept. Her tail also held a miniature version of the bracelet at its base, just before the red cuff, though this did not have a link to hook anything onto it.
<P>On her neck hung a large black collar, with the same silver studs and the same lack of a buckle. It wore a little loose so that it wouldn't choke her, and its crowning achievement was the shiny silver bell that hung from it. It settled coolly against her furry chest. Her name was etched in fine cursive on its polished front.
<P>Finally, she had made two earrings. Each was a large, 24-karat gold loop that hung from the tips of her black cow ears. They were so heavy they forced her ears to hang limply at the sides of her head. She could still twitch them to a degree, but raising them all the way up was now impossible.
<P>Tricia turned around a few times to admire her handiwork. She heard a few dull clanks from her bell as she moved. She smiled lustfully, knowing exactly where she wanted to go tonight.</p>
