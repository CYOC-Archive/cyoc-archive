<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Normally, when mermaids gather, they chatter and prattle endlessly. They&#39;re very social, and seldom serious about anything. But the lagoon is silent when three regal mermaids, breathtaking in their stately and classical beauty, swim into the lagoon. They come to a halt before you and Alex, and with skillful motions of their tailfins, the rise up out of the water just to the waistline, so that their bare human upper-halves are exposed for all the world to see and their scaly fishtails remain just beneath the surface. (How they manage to balance like that and at the same time tread water in one place is a total mystery to you.)<br />
<br />
The Mermaid Queen has tan skin, straight black hair a bit longer than shoulder-length, and deep brown eyes that seem to penetrate your soul. She looks every bit like the stereotypical notion of an Ancient Egyptian ruler, as if Cleopatra herself were swimming before you, bare-breasted and with her legs replaced by a fishtail. The two mermaidens flanking the Queen carry themselves with the same noble mien: one is fair and golden-haired, with Grecian features and scales of dark blue; while the other has light brown skin and curly dark-brown hair which are both similar in shade to Yasmin&#39;s, and a rose-red colored tail. The Queen&#39;s tail has an exotic, striped pattern of tropical yellow alternating with narrower bands of azure blue.<br />
<br />
You begin to feel unnerved by the Queen&#39;s staring, and so you break the silence with your best attempt at a bow while treading water yourself. &quot;Your Majesty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You will not speak until you are addressed,&quot; snaps the golden-haired mermaid. You shut your mouth and await the Queen&#39;s pleasure.<br />
<br />
Finally, the Queen says, &quot;This is most unexpected. The power of the Goddess is unwelcoming to men. Tell me, child: were you a man before you appeared here, to be changed into one of my kind?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I—I think so,&quot; you stammer. &quot;I mean, it depends on your definition of a man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Explain yourself,&quot; says the Queen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m eighteen,&quot; you reply, &quot;so depending on how you see it, I could be called a man or a boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Queen smiles. &quot;In my time, a man who had seen eighteen floods of the River was no mere boy. Still, your answer shows some wisdom. Perhaps we can welcome you after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What other choice do you have?&quot; asks Alex. &quot;You can&#39;t just get rid of him!&quot;<br />
<br />
The other handmaiden is about to snap at Alex for her rudeness, but the Queen holds up a hand to stop her. The Queen says, &quot;You may not be aware of this, but he breaks our most sacred law merely by being here. This island first came into being as a refuge for the souls of women who had been brutalized by seafaring men. The ground of the island itself, and all the waters around it, are consecrated—made sacred to the great Goddess, Atargatis.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex smacks herself on the forehead in realization. &quot;Atargatis! Of course!&quot; And at your questioning look, she turns to you and explains, &quot;Ancient Canaanite fertility and moon goddess. Mythology&#39;s first mermaid. Derceto was her name in Greek.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; you say. You take off the amulet you found in the shipwreck and hold it out to Alex. &quot;Like on this medallion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That amulet,&quot; says the Queen suddenly, &quot;let me see it!&quot;<br />
<br />
She is so insistent, almost panicky in the way she speaks, that you accede at once and hand the artifact over. The Queen&#39;s hands shake as she takes it from you, and she runs her fingers over the image the winged siren-mermaid-goddess and the Greek letters. She reads them aloud, &quot;Derketo. Greek. Bah, this is not *my* sacred relic. For a moment I&#39;d thought—hoped—that you&#39;d found it.&quot; She hands the medallion back to you and asks, &quot;What are your names?&quot;<br />
<br />
You introduce yourselves simply as John and Alex, and the Queen continues, &quot;Well, I am Nephi, Queen of Mermaid Island, and these are my handmaidens, Thetis and Miryam. Alex is of course welcome among us, for she is now a mermaid, like all the favored daughters of the Goddess. But as for you . . . the presence of a male complicates matters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How so?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;In twenty days&#39; time, the spring equinox will be upon us, and the once-yearly desire to mate will seize our bodies. No mermaid has ever done this with a male before; none of our kind have ever conceived, hatched, or reared offspring. Our very purpose is chastity; the reason for our existence is our sacred virginity, a holy sacrifice to please the will of Atargatis. We are not meant to be bound to men as wives, or beholden to children as mothers.&quot;<br />
<br />
You could tell, from the way several of the mermaids were listening to the Queen, hanging on her every word, and then turning to look at one another in confusion or realization, that most of this Goddess business was entirely news to them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; you offer, &quot;what if I just, uh, stay out of everyone&#39;s way when the day comes? I&#39;ll be really careful about it, I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Queen Nephi shakes her head and says, &quot;I fear the temptation will be too great. Here in this island sanctuary, my beloved mer-maidens have been shielded from all the depredations and wickedness of men, and also the temptation to lose their virtue to men, to see their very maidenhood destroyed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex cuts in and says, &quot;I get the sense that a lot of these girls weren&#39;t even virgins in the first place when they got turned into mermaids.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is of no concern,&quot; says Nephi. &quot;The moment they appeared on my island with their pretty girlish legs and sacred womanly cunts encased within hard, impenetrable scales, and their cores of carnal lust buried deeply for all future time within their powerful fishes&#39; tails, they became virgins anew, and their maidenhood was restored to them. Every mermaid is a mer-maiden, and must always remain so, lest we risk the displeasure of the Goddess.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you must understand, John, you who are the first and only merman to ever lay eyes upon the Sacred Refuge, you must never, ever consummate a mating with any mermaid, for as long as you dwell on this island. If you upset the careful balance I have wrought and bring harm to what my Goddess has bidden me build here, I will destroy you. Do you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cowed, you answer with a meek nod. &quot;Twenty days from now. I&#39;ll hide myself away. It&#39;ll be like I was never here.&quot; (And knowing that the month was already half-way gone and in two weeks&#39; time, Uncle Jack would be summoning you and Alex back to his costume-shop, you were being entirely truthful with the Queen.)<br />
<br />
Queen Nephi turns to face the crowd of mermaids and says, &quot;Mark my decree. When the day of mating arrives, none of you may approach the merman. It is the will of the Goddess. Thus have I spoken; thus shall it be.&quot; She turns back to you and Alex and says, &quot;On that day, you both will keep company with me and my handmaidens. Oh, and one thing more.&quot; She points at the Derceto medallion that you&#39;ve put back around your neck. &quot;If either of you find another amulet like that one, but with the inscription in Hieratic Egyptian, be a dear and bring it to me, would you? Good.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, the Queen dismisses you from her presence, and goes off to mingle and socialize with some of the other centuries-ancient mermaids lingering in the lagoon.<br />
<br />
You and Alex share a concerned look. The Queen, you&#39;re quite certain, could become dangerous merely by deciding to favor caution and do away with you early on. Your last two weeks on Mermaid Island might prove perilous. But you take some small comfort from the fact that it won&#39;t be the Queen&#39;s religious zealotry and imperious decree that disappoints the mermaids when their mating-day arrives. It will be the fact that you and Alex had already intended to be long-gone by then, and nothing more to the mermaids than a mysterious memory. The only question is, can you survive the last fourteen or so days you have left here?</p>
