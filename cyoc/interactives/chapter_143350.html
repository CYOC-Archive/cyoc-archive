<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You were now left alone and you sighed and walked away back to the tent you and Zarsh shared. You decided to see if you could scrounge up anything that would suggest what he would be doing after his defeat. You wanted to ask around the tribe&#39;s women to see if they knew anything more, or if that policy existed in this tribe. You needed to be a little more social after all, you WERE the wife of the tribe leader, or so they considered you such.<br />
<br />
The women were more than willing to answer you, a few admitting they’ve lost and were now mates to some of the male soldiers. A couple of those women were pregnant, but none of them were very clear on whether that was required or not.<br />
<br />
You sighed at a loss, and you decided to go question one of the men in camp. Finally you found a red scaled male amongst a few others, and you looked to him and called,&quot;Hey, Red scales!&quot;<br />
<br />
The men around him immediately noticed you and backed away, and a nervous look appeared on his face. You were curious about just how afraid these guys were of you now that you’ve beaten their leader, and you tested this by silently looking into the eyes of this red male.<br />
<br />
After awhile he began to crack and replied,&quot;L-Look, wife of Zarsh&#39;s if you’re going to challenge me then I’ll forfeit before it starts okay? I’m a husband, a father soon too, so please...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I’m not here to face you, I just want a word with you.&quot; You exclaimed <br />
<br />
&quot;I.... okay,&quot; he replied and he seemed to calm down a bit.<br />
<br />
You explained to him the situation you woke up to this morning, and what you learned from Thrass about the sacred land. The male paused as he heard this and said,&quot;W-Well... what does that have to do with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn’t,&quot; You sighed,&quot;I just want to know a little bit more about the tribe, mainly whether Zarsh run off to become a woman while I slept or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
The red male paused and stared off into space a bit and muttered,&quot;Zarsh... a woman?&quot;<br />
<br />
You raised a brow as his eyes looked down at your breasts and he blushed and you hissed,&quot;Well...?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I don’t know r-really I don’t!&quot; He yapped nervously,&quot;I-I just thought it was always tradition s-so... w-well...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what you’re saying is that he’s most likely going to return as a female?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
He paused and nervously scratched at the scales on the back of his neck and nodded slowly. &quot;I-I mean... I-I don’t know for s-sure but... yeah... I think. P-Please don’t hurt me I know he’s y-your husband and everything, just...&quot; He whimpered and you sighed,&quot;It’s fine,&quot;<br />
<br />
His eyes went wide and you turned to walk away and he asked,&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think Zarsh is an asshole, and the fact that I’m &#39;married&#39; to him kind of insults me... to an extent of course, I mean he is the tribal leader,&quot; You exclaimed then you sighed,&quot;I just guess I wanted someone who wasn’t as much of a pervert as him, and he didn’t have to be so open about my body, it’s mine not his! You know what I mean though... right?&quot;<br />
<br />
The red male gave you a quick nod and said,&quot;I...I guess, c-can I leave now Mrs?&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked back at him and shrugged,&quot;Go ahead, I know I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
You then decided to make your way back to your tent and you sighed looking down to your breasts and your pelvis. You couldn’t seem to shake the envy of having a dick, hell you’d feel a lot better if you had one instead of this puffy cunt all the damn time.<br />
<br />
You then slowly passed by Tharss&#39;s tent when something firmly grabbed the tip of your tail and tugged on it. Initially you’d turn around and punch the asshole who did this, but you paused when you saw that the one who had your tail was none other than Tharss herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-Hey uh... don’t be mad please, just... can we have a private talk?&quot; Tharss asked blushing and dropping your tail as she peeked out of her tent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... sure, no problem, what’s going on?&quot; You asked hoping that this wasn’t some awkward lady bodily issue that this species had.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shh, p-please... come on in,&quot; Tharss replied and you paused and slowly entered her tent.<br />
<br />
When you were in you saw Tharss completely nude, and you paused and blinked twice, she did have quite the body as compared to your own now that you had a full view of her. You saw a single bed, her clothes thrown to the side, and her spear on the ground next to a sewing needle and a tanning rack.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what would you like to talk about Tharss?&quot; You asked with a hand on your hip as you studied her body and mentally complimented and admired it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I thought about what you said... a long time actually, a-and well...&quot; She paused with a deep blush on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...? Don’t try to act like someone you aren’t girl, you can be casual when it’s just you and me,&quot; You replied with a warm smile on your face.<br />
<br />
Tharss nodded to you then she sat down on her bed and said,&quot;I think I am a... Les-biiiion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean lesbian?&quot; You asked and she nodded,&quot;Yes, I’m not used to that weird word yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a few moments of silence and you crossed your arms and asked,&quot;Well, do you wanna talk about it? It usually helps to express yourself a bit in these kinds of scenes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tharss nodded and said,&quot;Look, ever since I became this way I’ve never truly felt like a woman, I guess. I’ve never been attracted to men, just... women...&quot; She took a deep breath and went on,&quot;At first I thought it was just something that would pass, but it didn’t. Then I thought something went wrong when I initially went to the alter to become this way. Men have come up to me, and... I’ve pretended to like a few, and they were nice, but I’ve never felt the same way as they did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don’t worry about it dear, just be yourself and open so...&quot; You began then she growled,&quot;You don’t get it! Th-This kind of thing... some tribes just look down upon it, some don’t even allow it in their tribes. I don’t know how to get rid of it and...!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So they’re prejudice then, so what that’s just them, and they’ll learn eventually,&quot; You said and shrugged then paused,&quot;Oh... was that... why you were uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don’t want to talk about it right now... what is pre-jud-ice?&quot; She asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Hate for someone who has a quality that the victim doesn’t have the power to change, or something like that,&quot; You said then knelt down and paused as her eyes followed you, still blushing as you gave a puzzled look,&quot;Are you okay Tharss?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don’t understand wife of Zarsh I... you were the only one who noticed this, and you’re completely fine with it... that plus your skill and your...&quot; Tharss bit her lip and hissed at herself and buried her head on her hands.<br />
<br />
You paused and sat next to her and wrapped an arm around her to comfort her and said,&quot;What is it girl? I’ll keep all of this just between us if it helps. Just spit it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N-No... you... just....&quot; Tharss stammered then she took a deep breath and sighed,&quot;I think... I’m in love... with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused and your eyes widened, you imagined just that she’d maybe just call upon you from time as a friend, but THIS?! You weren’t even sure if you were completely straight or not or bi. Zarsh was handsome, muscular, and his cock was one of the meatiest you’ve seen, but if he becomes a woman then that’s all gone.<br />
<br />
With this in mind you looked to Tharss and said,&quot;Tharss... I have to test something really quick, can you uh... help me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tharss paused and nodded,&quot;Well... yes wha-&quot; You suddenly wrapped your arms around Tharss&#39;s head and planted your lips firmly against hers. Tharss’s eyes went wide with shock, but she slowly eased into a passionate kiss with you and put her hands on your hips. <br />
<br />
You wanted to see if you were truly bisexual or not, and the more you made out with Tharss the more right it felt, just in general. Initially you intended this to just me a small smooch to test the waters, but you found yourself even leaning into this more and more. You felt Tharss’s tongue move around your mouth, and you wanted more and more of the taste in her mouth, despite the poor hygiene of the people in this tribe in general and you lost yourself in passion.<br />
<br />
You eventually fell forward and Tharss fell backwards onto her bed. You caught yourself just inches away from her muzzle, and it wasn’t just Tharss who blushed, your whole face turned a deep color with hers as you looked into her beautiful eyes and looked down to see your breasts and hers slightly squished together.<br />
<br />
There was an awkward silence until Tharss muttered,&quot;A-Are you.... M-Mrs...&quot;<br />
<br />
You hated that people kept calling you by that name and you sighed,&quot;Tharss... d-don’t call me that.... please...&quot;<br />
<br />
She slowly nodded to you and said,&quot;What’s your name then?&quot;<br />
<br />
That’s when you bit your lip, and you blushed now in a different kind of awkward situation. &quot;I....&quot; You paused and replied,&quot;D-Don’t have a name...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tharss tilted her head curiously at this and asked,&quot;W-Wait, what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I.... don’t have a name...&quot; You whimpered then sat up and crossed your arms over your breasts, then looked away and contemplated whether you should’ve just made up some weird name for her.<br />
<br />
Tharss sat up and put her hand on your shoulder then looked down and asked,&quot;N-No name? Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just... can’t remember...&quot; You muttered then put your hand on your head and rubbed it, trying to act your way out of this, but using a completely idiotic response to do so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don’t remember? Wait.... you...?&quot; Tharss paused and asked,&quot;Do you have... what humans call amnesia?&quot;<br />
<br />
A light bulb clicked on in your head, this was the imaginary explanation you were looking for. So you slowly looked to her and asked,&quot;Is... that what it’s called?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tharss seemed to have a moment of realization as you said this and she wrapped her arms around you and said,&quot;Oh you poor thing, that’s horrible.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded, and hugged back as your upper breasts squished with her lower breasts. At least now you didn’t have to tell her where you came from or make up a life&#39;s story about yourself. &quot;It’s... thank you... but...&quot; you began then Tharss said,&quot;A sibling of mine hit their head after falling from a tree, and had the same thing. Took years to get him back to remembering me as a guy, but... not everything came back.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded to her and hugged tighter then said,&quot;Thank you... I-I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too, but you’re Zarsh&#39;s wife and...&quot; Tharss exclaimed then you took her hands and interlaced your fingers with hers and said,&quot;If he returns as a woman then she’ll find someone new I bet, if not well... leave him to me. In the end if he finds out he can’t take on two of us, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, well you certainly beat him... despite your injuries... are you okay?&quot; Tharss asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I’ve been.... dealing with this awhile... I’m just building up a new life I guess, heh,&quot; You replied and she tilted her head and asked,&quot;Are you sure?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it’s just me.... I feel like I used to be bisexual as well, and... maybe lived near humans?&quot; You exclaimed then shook your head and sighed,&quot;It’s all so blurry,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bi-sexual?&quot; Tharss asked then smiled and giggled,&quot;Well if you lived near humans it explains all of your weird words, but what does that mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It means that I’m attracted to both men and women. I guess I’ve viewed it as a choice I have, and I think I’ve chosen which I like more,&quot; You said then nuzzled Tharss’s snout and she smiled with a humbled look on her face and replied,&quot;I’m honored you picked me over him... but.... isn’t something like this... wrong when you’re married?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you see a ring on my finger? He may call me his wife and mate, but in reality if he got anywhere close to mating with me I’d make him wish he had a womb... if he doesn’t already have one by that time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why... does that sound like you claiming that you’re going to tear off his dick?&quot; Tharss asked <br />
<br />
&quot;I would, figuratively of course, he just got on my bad side before,&quot; You exclaimed <br />
<br />
&quot;Bad... side? Are you going to get that way with me?&quot; She whimpered <br />
<br />
&quot;I promise I won’t, Zarsh is the only one who’s pushed me to that point,&quot; You hissed<br />
<br />
&quot;You looked good, of course there were openings you made on your part, but you were incredible! Every woman in the tribe practically looks up to you!&quot; Tharss cheered<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, it means a lot coming from a fighter like you, really!&quot; You replied then you sighed and said,&quot;I should probably leave now, lord knows when Zarsh will be back home, besides if I’m as famous as you say I am I wouldn’t want to get noticed like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tharss paused and nodded,&quot;Yeah... come back sometime though sweetie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, of course I can babe,&quot; You said giving Tharss a hug goodbye and leaving.<br />
<br />
The rest of the day consisted of you just trying to straighten up around the hole Zarsh calls home. But soon the tent flap opened and you heard a voice,&quot;Greetings... wife,&quot;<br />
<br />
You turned around and there was Zarsh, as a....</p>
