<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Deep within a plane of pure darkness, many levels below the plane of reality Dana has once resided as a human male, the two Ancient and impossibly powerful being had been watching the events unfolding from the great pool of ethereal essence they had squeezed from tormented souls. As old as they where, the time that had passed seemed only the blink of a human eye, and having discussed the matter, watching Dana and her &quot;growth&quot; as a Succubus carefully.. they decided to act, sensing an opportunity. The second being inclined it's head to the first, and then snapped its fingers as Dana attempted to reenter the realm of Chaos, distorting the fabric of reality as Dana's final destination changed.<br />
<br />
 The Demoness Blinked in surprise when her clawed feet landed on a floor that burned against her skin, despite her already elevated body temperature, and as she brushed hair from her eyes, Dana could not help but stare dumbfounded at the chamber she suddenly found herself in. Jeffery landed with a thump and an off nearby, prom[ting the Succubus to immediately turn toward him, her eyes still holding that brief hint of Green, that last little bit that had kept her from fully falling under Astara's control, as they glimmered with concern for his well being. Dana opened her mouth as if to speak, but before she could, there was a loud groan as a giant stone door slowly swung open, revealing a large room, from which a bright, smoldering light glowed. <br />
<br />
 &quot;Thi- This is not the realm of Chaos... where the Hell am I?&quot; Dana asked aloud, not really to anyone in particular. Jeffery replied with a low moan, then grew silent, and again the Succubus turned to him, about to step toward him when another loud sound filled the space around them... a strange sound, the combination of a deep, booming voice, but at the same time, sounding like a dark, raspy hiss.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Do not bother with the Mortal, he will survive, step into the chamber.&quot; The voice was astonishingly powerful, far surpassing even Astara's power, and, unable to resist it, Dana began to step toward the chamber, all of her bodily control completely lost to her. Concerned and confused thoughts began to swirl in the back of the Succubus' mind, and, almost immediately, the voice began a deep, rumbling, wheezing sound. It was LAUGHING, the damned thing was LAUGHING at her! She tried to fight, but she could not stop herself as the passed through the door into the chamber beyond, and found herself facing two giant... things. There where no words that could describe the beings she found herself facing, aside from a loose labeling of &quot;Lovecraftian&quot;, and her jaw dropped in awe, fear and surprise.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Ahh... and here you are at last young one.&quot; The closest of the creatures said aloud. &quot;We have been watching you for some time, Astara's actions do not please us, and thought you have obeyed her orders, you have fought her will every inch of the way.&quot; Dana could only blink in response as the second creature spoke.<br />
<br />
 &quot;There has been much discussion about you, Astara cannot continue to go any further without a counter weight, someone to oppose her and reinstitute and reinforce the balance, and our ranks. Other players have taken notice of these events, and have begun to move.&quot; As the creature spoke, the Succubus felt rage suddenly rise within her, Astara had taken over her world, had made her into the Demoness she was now, but she had also taken care of her, taught her, and she had began to feel a connection with the Princess. The closest of the creatures seemed to scoff, and suddenly incredible pain seared into Dana's mind, overwhelming her senses as images of a giant war, one so large that the very fabric of the universe was undone, consumed her thoughts, and sent the Succubus to her knees. <br />
<br />
 &quot;Do not lie to yourself, you have known all along that Astara was insane, deep down you felt that she was creating an unstable shift in the balance of the universe. We have decided that you would be the perfect being to oppose her.&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;But I don't have anywhere near the power that the Princess does!&quot; Dana protested,the onslaught of images lessening some, only to be replaced with an incredible burning. Though she could not see it, Dana had begun to change, her skin seemed to soften, growing a darker shade of red, beginning to glow as her legs grew longer, her hips began to swell even more, and her breasts gained another cup size, easily a double D now, but amazingly firm. Her hair great out, and the horns that had sprouted from her head curved, growing out along with the claws on both her hands and feed, gaining length, thickness, and amazing strength. Dana's entire body continued to shift, gaining a quality of perfect femininity reserved only for true Goddesses. The Demoness felt new power surge through her, impossible power, something that would have completely destroyed her when she was a human. Suddenly she was capable of seeing beyond herself, and was easily able to watch the changes occurring to her body, and was able to glimpse the red consume the last of her green irises, and her pupils turning a shade of black so deep that any being who looked into them would be lost forever. Toned muscle was made more apparent, accenting her now perfect body in every way, and somehow, all of her fear, her anxiety, and her self doubt was gone. Dana knew who she was now, she knew her body, she knew her abilities, and she had no doubt about them.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Arise Dana, 667th Princess of Hell, it is time for you to take your world back, your family back, and to prevent the continued expansion of Astara's insanity. You will also prevent any others from interfering, and may do whatever you must. The world you came from is yours now, along with all of the worlds Astara has conquered, when you defeat that meddlesome brat, she must be delivered to us. Go now, and take the male creature with you, he is yours.&quot; The new Princess grinned, her sweat immediately turning to steam from her bodies new temperature, and turned, striding elegantly out of of the chamber, setting out to grab Jeffery and begin her task.</p>
