Original Chapter: /interactives/chapter_154737.html</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The pair lay in their state for what seemed like hours. The blissful post orgasmic state they were in seemed to linger as the bathed in one another company. Jess’ hand shot out, grabbing Henry’s arm tightly. Henry stifled a satisfied sigh in response, doing little to dissuade the behaviour of his youngest. The cold of the floor was beginning to seep through their happy delirium, striking at Henry first. Jess’ back was still warm, insulated by the fur that her new lover had given her. It was subtle at first, but very quickly everything that was wrong about this moment came seeping in. It was clear to him that this was no accident. That his wife, in a fit of jealous rage had pushed his daughter to the edge and then set him loose on her. Regardless of the grievances that Joan had with the pair, Henry was quick to decide that she had crossed a serious line from which there was no turning back.<br />
<br />
Next his mind turned to Jess. His baby girl. His baby girl turned two time lover. Whether he liked it or not, the two were bound, both by circumstance and by species. His eyes cast lovingly over Jess’ frame. Her breasts, too big to sit pert fell to each side of her chest. Her udder, bulbous and veiny sat there as a stark reminder of just how much his perception had changed. Weeks ago he’d have been disgusted by such a sight. But now? Henry stifled the thought about how much they turned him on. Even the subtle changes to her face, like how her ears twitched as she lay, or how her tail swayed gently against the cold tiles.<br />
<br />
Inside Jess’ mind a less critical evaluation was taking place. All that surged through her was the blissful afterglow of her second mating. “No, not mating. Love making.” She reconciled internally, her faint smile peaking at the thought. She felt amazing, her whole body aglow with hormones, both human and otherwise. To have been wanted in such a way, it invigorated her. In her mind it was far easier to blur the relationship between her and her father, her rationale more malleable to the cabin’s will. Of course she knew her mother would oppose, but he would make it right. He would make his choice, and it had to be her.<br />
<br />
Finally Henry spoke<br />
<br />
“Jess…” He said softly, twitching his arm to illicit a response. Henry got a giggle in response, the young woman slowly leant up, draping her leg across Henry’s body. “Mhmm.” She replied, still a little drunk on lust. Her hand lazily caressed his chest, finger sliding down between his burgeoning breasts. Henry stammered for a moment, trying to refocus his thoughts despite his daughters best attempts to distract him.<br />
<br />
“Jess baby…” The words felt natural leaving his lips. ‘Baby’. “We need to talk… About… This.” He said, stammering a little as he sat further upright. His hairy bovine testicles draped across the cold floor, further waking him. Henry’s sudden movement startled Jess up, she pushed against the floor and sat upright with him, her cleavage jiggling as she did. Henry blushed this time, prying his eyes away from hisn daughter&#39;s frame. “But first… We need to get dressed.” He laughed, looking away. Jess joined him, clearly she was a distraction for him, a fact that made her smile. “Okay daddy.” She giggled, shakily getting to her feet before taking off to her bedroom.<br />
Henry heard heavy footsteps descending the stairs several moments later as he entered the hall to watch his daughter waddle down. Henry raised his eyebrow in amusement at her get-up. Jess had obviously pulled a dress from upstairs to replace the now bursting dungarees. The dress was yellow and had thick straps, pleated skirt and a loose middle. Neither skirt nor middle were loose enough, however, to not be pulled tight around her breasts and udder; nipples and teats poking out like permanent little erections.<br />
<br />
She frowned seeing his face. and countered. &quot;Needs must Dad...&quot;. To be fair, he himself had thrown on sweatpants to hide his cock and dangling balls.<br />
<br />
Jess continued. &quot;You said Mom was going having a shower? I think she must have gone to bed, I don’t hear her.&quot; She asked, mostly for confirmation. Henry nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we have a problem...&quot; She breathed, exasperated. &quot;I think Mom knows...&quot; Henry winced. &quot;Are you sure?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, she all but lubed me up. Then you said she asked you to check on me? Come on...&quot; Jess sounded frustrated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lubed you up?&quot; Henry asked, quizzically, but felt shocked. Jess hadn&#39;t mentioned that till now.<br />
<br />
She pinched the bridge of her button nose, eyes squeezing shut. &quot;Yeah...&quot; She let it hang for a moment. &quot;She began rubbing me, talking about how sexy you were, and describing having sex with you, all things to get me hot and horny. Then she left...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And talk of me gets you horny?&quot; Henry asked, almost rhetorically.<br />
<br />
Jess&#39;s eyebrow arched, as her hands grabbed her udder through the dress and began to jiggle it. &quot;I thought that was obvious Dad...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I think we need to talk Jess...&quot; Henry said.<br />
<br />
&quot;About us?&quot; She asked, fearful and hopeful.<br />
<br />
&quot;About us...&quot; He confirmed. &quot;You&#39;re my daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t be attracted to you, or you to me...&quot; Jess countered without missing a beat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking your daughter is wrong...&quot; Henry continued, as if Jess hadn&#39;t said anything.<br />
<br />
She cut in again instantly, &quot;I think the laws of right and wrong are out the window in this place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I took advantage of you.&quot; He continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be ridiculous, I fucked you. My choice.&quot; She finished.<br />
<br />
Henry stopped. &quot;You really feel that way?&quot; His final question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course! Don&#39;t you?&quot; She sounded fearful. Henry sighed in resignation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... yes I do.&quot; He said. &quot;Then why all the excuses?&quot; She accused.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is big. I want both of us to be sure.&quot; He admitted. &quot;So&quot;. He continued, taking Jess&#39;s soft hand in his. Rubbing it. &quot;You were always the smart one honey. What&#39;s the plan?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess smiled in happiness. &quot;We bust that wall open and find a way out. And if that doesn&#39;t work we&#39;ll try something else and something else... and keep trying; and if nothing works then...&quot; She trailed off. Henry sensing her becoming morose leaned in and gave her a kiss on the lips. Their first. &quot;Then we become cows together...&quot; He said, smiling.<br />
<br />
Jess smiled up and leaned into him, difficult with humongous breasts and an udder. She laughed into his chest, happy tears streaming down. &quot;Your tits are soft Dad.&quot; He let out a bark of laughter. &quot;You should talk!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jess pulled back, big eyes looking up from under his chin. &quot;What about Mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck her...&quot; Henry said with conviction. &quot;She tried to turn me into a Goat on purpose, she&#39;s trying to turn you into a Cow out of spite. I think she&#39;s earned a place in the &#39;black book&#39;.&quot; To her credit, Jess looked sad. In the end, it was still her mother. She&#39;d raised them. Though all her life, Jess had always felt overly criticised and targeted by her mother in favour of James. It wasn&#39;t something she held against him. But it had definitely caused friction between mother and daughter over the years.<br />
<br />
This place though. It seemed to amplify emotions, and her mother&#39;s jealousy, and spite seemed to be growing unchecked. Jess began to wonder if all emotions grew here, positive and negative. Or only those that were given time, like love for her father, in her case.<br />
Lust was universal here of course. Unless, of course lust was a universal feeling in everyone, like hunger. She was more often hungry now. Maybe there was something there?<br />
<br />
Jess train of thought was interrupted as her eyes drifted and fell upon something that fell out of place. A doorway in the hall. She stared at it for a full 20 seconds as the two rocked in comforting embrace, before something clicked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad!&quot; she said untangling herself. &quot;Where did that door come from?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What door?&quot; He asked as she pointed. He furrowed his brow. &quot;It&#39;s just the door to...&quot; He stopped, then parroting in confusion, &quot;Where *did* that door come from?&quot;</p>
