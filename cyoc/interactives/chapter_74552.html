<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;He IS one too,&quot; Balthilde nodded, &quot;but he rarely if ever takes his wolf form. I've only seen him do it once.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah blinked in surprise at all of this as she sat on an old wooden chair in her grandmother's dining room. Her mind was still swimming in shock at surprise to register things. She was sitting naked in front of her grandmother, covered in gray fur. She still had her cape and red hood, but it was smaller on her now. It used to come down to her knees. At present it only came down to her waist and the base of her tail. At the same time, her grandmother was also naked and just as wolf-like as she was. Her muscled looked a bit larger, as did her breasts, but they did so some signs of her age. They were firmer than what Sarah expected from an older woman, but they weren't as firm as her own enlarged maternal material was. What made Sarah the most surprised at this is that a good part of her mind was okay with the fact that both she and her grandmother were naked in front of each other.<br />
<br />
But she didn't have time to ponder that because she was still trying to process the revelation that her grandmother, her mother, and herself weren't human.<br />
<br />
&quot;He rarely changes?&quot; Sarah wondered, &quot;but the people in the village say werewolves transform every night on the full moon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't believe everything the humans in the village say about us,&quot; Balthilde said more defensively, &quot;they think we're nothing but mindless monsters that only eat people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do we?&quot; Sarah asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some do, but it isn't a mindless blood-lust,&quot; Balthilde said with a sigh, &quot;and when it happens it is more the human's fault then ours. They treat the woods and everything in it as fuel for their own ambitions and vilify everything that they don't control. When a werewolf does it, it's to protect his pack and his home. I mean suppose some man came after me or your parents with an ax... what would you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd defend you,&quot; Sarah answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that is why some werewolves have killed humans,&quot; Balthilde explains, &quot;the human has threatened the werewolf, and the werewolf either defends itself or is saved by another werewolf. But this isn't often, and if you do not wish to eat humans, that is alright. I don't, and never have, and neither has your mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah nodded, &quot;So why doesn't Dad transform?&quot;<br />
<br />
Balthilde sighed and glanced to her granddaughter's golden eyes. They looked fearful, nervous, and puzzled all at once. And she sighed again. She knew that werewolves were always puzzled and confused when their abilities manifested. They lived the early part of their lives as humans, and then at a certain age, they suddenly learn they were never truly human. Balthilde remembered crying into her own mother's shoulder after transforming for the first time at the breakfast table.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would mostly be guilt, I suppose,&quot; Balthilde said slowly, &quot;or being ashamed of his past. Now, to correct what the villagers thing, we don't transform because the moon is full. We can transform at any time we wish. We commonly chose to transform on full moon nights, but that is our choice. But because we have both wolf and human sides, we commonly have the instincts of each that require good self discipline and self-control. Your mother and I will be more then happy to help you as this is all new for you, don't worry, but it does mean that emotional stresses, fright, anger, frustration, sadness, extreme joy, lust and arousal can trigger a transformation because they can distract you from your concentration. In fact a young male in the pack...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah blinked as her grandmother then raised her voice, as if she was talking to someone other then her.<br />
<br />
&quot;...who needs to think more before he acts did that with me,&quot; Balthilde spoke, &quot;jumped through my window and gave a right start, and I transformed after losing my own focus... which at my age can be easy...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What does this have to do with Dad, Grandma?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It relates to how your father joined the pack,&quot; Balthilde told her, &quot;you see, unlike myself, your mother, and you, your father wasn't born a werewolf. Your mother bit him. Before he joined the Pack, your father WAS a werewolf hunter... A human who knew about us and believed us to be only monsters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He knew mom was a werewolf?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, he knew werewolves were real, but didn't know the truth,&quot; Balthilde explained, &quot;I wasn't real supportive of your mother dating a human, and would have done more to stop her if I knew he was a hunter, but I didn't know he was a hunter and there were no other male werewolves in the area that were available for your to date, so I allowed it. And they did get along well. And as time went by, I saw real love blossom between the two of them... and then it happened...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah looked on as her grandmother sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a full moon, and your mother was late for meeting us to transform and have some fun with the pack,&quot; Balthilde continued, &quot;and feeling late, she was transforming as she went while shedding her cloths as she went. It wasn't the smartest decision, but we all do things when we're in hurry. She stumbled into your father as he was stalking the pack as a whole. From what your mother told me, later, she was half horrified to see that he was a hunter and he was just as startled to see that she was a transforming werewolf...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; Sarah gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your father couldn't believe and dropped his gun,&quot; Balthilde responded, &quot;he stood there watching your mother change. I heard her howl and wend to investigate. I found him hugging her, apologizing, and her holding him to her and telling him that she wasn't and never was a monster. In that, the true love between your parents burned through your father's mistaken prejudices. Your mother bit him and brought him into the pack, but I've rarely seen him change... Your mother and I have tried to get him to change and come with us, but he gets a guilt ridden look and says he's unworthy or makes some other excuse not to change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So he's not a werewolf hunter anymore?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not anymore,&quot; Balthilde nodded, &quot;he joined us and has become very helpful to the pack and has been a wonderful loving husband and father to you... I'm sorry we couldn't be with you for your first transformation. I hope it wasn't too scarring for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not really,&quot; Sarah said slowly, &quot;I thought it was some enchantment in the water from the well that I drank from after meeting with this other wolf on my way here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bigby, you mean,&quot; Balthilde told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bigby?&quot; Sarah asked, she vaguely remembered a boy from the village having that name. Somewhat wild and forgetful, but fairly nice, and had been friends with her, but a few years back he had vanished and never was seen when she went into town.<br />
<br />
&quot;A young male of the pack,&quot; Balthilde answered, &quot;a good pack member, if a bit forgetful and prone to doing things without thinking, but a good pack member none the less.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah-ha,&quot; Sarah said slowly, again catching that her grandmother had raised her voice again, &quot;forgive me Grandma, but is someone else here?&quot;</p>
