<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Let me make it up to you,&quot; I said, looking my sister up and down. &quot;Is there something I can wish for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie paused, one hand on her hip and the other pushing her hair back. Just in that moment, she looked gorgeous as an actress. I&#39;d noticed my twin sister&#39;s beauty before now. But this time, I&#39;d seen her naked in the street, and she was as gorgeous as I&#39;d hoped. I knew that, as a lesbian, Jamie would never have any interest in me. But I&#39;d decided long before that moment that, if she ever expressed any curiosity about having sex with a man, I&#39;d volunteer to be her test subject.<br />
<br />
I first became attracted to Jamie when we were both fourteen, and I had a wet dream about her. I&#39;ve read since then that sexual dreams about siblings are usually symbolic rather than literal, but I didn&#39;t know that at the time; I assumed my subconscious mind was already attracted to her, so my conscious mind began taking her in. That first dream was very simple. I dreamed that Jamie and I had sex under the teacher&#39;s desk at school while our teacher droned on about Avogadro&#39;s Number.<br />
<br />
Since then, I&#39;d had wet dreams about Jamie off and on. My favorite happened when we were fifteen. I dreamed that somehow—I&#39;d long forgotten how—we&#39;d swapped genitals. She got on top of me, penetrated me with my own penis, and rode me until we came together, both laughing.<br />
<br />
That dream was a real turn-on for me. The thought of my sister penetrating me, of me having a womb, and of her shooting jizz so close that we might have a baby... wow. I&#39;ve beaten off several times fantasizing about the smile on Jamie&#39;s face as she broke my hymen and made me hers. But come on, that sort of thing never happens, not in real life. It&#39;s just fantasy.<br />
<br />
Until now.<br />
<br />
While my sister hesitated, wondering what an appropriate punishment might be, I whispered my own wish as silently as possible. Because come on, if she felt vindicated, and I had my fantasy come true, who would be hurt?<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish we would swap genitals,&quot; Jamie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; I replied, feigning innocence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Joey, it&#39;s simple. Use that ring and wish that your dick would be on my body, and my pussy would be on yours. Easy. You and I would still be exactly the same people, except I&#39;d have your cock, and you&#39;d have my snatch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I, um...&quot; I scratched my head. &quot;I guess I understand what you want. I just don&#39;t understand why.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Joey. Boys are so stupid. You saw me naked. You have the power to humiliate me with the memory. I want something to have that same kind of power over you. I want you to remember being the weak sex, and me being the strong one.&quot;<br />
<br />
I hemmed and hawed a little bit, still pretending I had no idea where this came from. Honestly, I never wrote that rationalization my sister quoted at me. She must have come up with it, or maybe the ring did, to make my fantasy seem completely reasonable to her. So I pretended to be uncomfortable with the idea, and even crossed my legs a little bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Joey,&quot; Jamie said, patting me on the cheek. &quot;You can still have control. You can put a time limit on it if you want. Or you still have the ring, so you can wish it undone whenever you want. But if your cock isn&#39;t growing out of my lap in the next sixty seconds, I&#39;ll tell Mom and Dad that you looked at me naked. And there will be no wishing those consequences away!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, fine,&quot; I said. &quot;I wish for the next forty-eight hours that my penis was transplanted onto my sister&#39;s body, and her vagina was transplanted onto mine. That includes the whole thing. Jamie&#39;s testicles will produce semen genetically identical to her, and I&#39;ll have a womb connected to my own eggs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, Joey,&quot; my sister said. &quot;Very thorough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just thinking of you, sis.&quot;<br />
<br />
As I said that, I felt the change. There was no long-drawn-out transition, like I&#39;d hoped. Instead, it was just like, POP, my cock and balls were gone, and I had a pussy riding low in my jeans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Jamie squealed, suddenly clutching her groin. &quot;That was... oh, wow!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie cupped and fondled my dick through her Dockers. &quot;I can feel it getting hard! This feels so good. No wonder you spend half the day locked in the bathroom! If touching myself brought pleasure this fast, I&#39;d probably never do anything else with my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you know why my grades are so bad,&quot; I replied, forcing a half-smile.<br />
<br />
Jamie laughed.<br />
<br />
Well, the first half of my fantasy was complete. I gently touched the ring and whispered the second half. &quot;I wish my sister would want to have sex—&quot;but, before I could finish saying it, Jamie kissed me on the cheek. I got flustered, forgot what I was doing, and my wish sputtered into a half-voiced &quot;Um...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Joey,&quot; Jamie said, bouncing ebulliently. (I couldn&#39;t help watching her breasts move with her.) &quot;I can... oh my god! I have a real, legitimate dick! I can have sex with straight girls! Ooh, there&#39;s cheerleaders and volleyball players and drama geeks...&quot; She started toward the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Jamie,&quot; I called after her. &quot;Wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No time, Joey. I only have your dick for two days, and I want to try it out with as many straight girls as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, Jamie, please. I could... I mean, I&#39;m...&quot;<br />
<br />
My sister turned back to me, one hand on the doorknob. Her cheeks were flushed, her eyes ablaze. The part of the wish I&#39;d actually said was certainly coming true, Jamie certainly wanted to have sex. But I&#39;d wanted her to have sex with me. And she was about to walk out without sparing me a second look.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just thinking, Jamie, I&#39;m sort of a girl now. Sort of a straight girl. Maybe you and I could, y&#39;know...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You?&quot; Jamie laughed. &quot;YOU? Look, Joey, I&#39;m flattered you would even think that way, but I&#39;m a lesbian with a dick. I want to have sex with a FULL girl, with breasts and hips and everything. You may have a pussy, but you still look and think and act like a boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that what you think I am, Jamie? A boy? Then maybe I should show you that I&#39;m becoming a real man.&quot; I strode over to her, where she still stood at the door. I put my hands on her hips, spun her around, and pressed her up against the door, where she stood, thunderstruck, while I pressed myself into her body and kissed her full on the mouth.<br />
<br />
Jamie hesitated a moment, but her body started to respond to the kiss. She squirmed under me, in a way that rubbed her tits into my chest, and I could feel her dick getting hard against me. She let out a small moan.<br />
<br />
Finally I stepped back, letting my sister come up for air. &quot;Listen, Jamie, I can&#39;t force you to do anything. And I know the whole incest thing may not be your cup of tea. Let me just say, if you agree to stay here with me, if you agree to teach me what a woman really wants, maybe there doesn&#39;t have to be a time limit on how long you get to keep that willy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie averted her gaze from me, chewing her lower lip. Maybe my offer was changing her mind, or maybe my kiss awakened something in her. She was at least considering it... but she wasn&#39;t completely convinced. She might stay, or she might go.<br />
<br />
I held my breath, waiting for my sister&#39;s decision.</p>
