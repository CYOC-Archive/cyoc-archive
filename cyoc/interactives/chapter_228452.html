<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The three brothers typically slept in just their boxer briefs, and nothing more. It was a household of boys, so their mother didn’t used to mine. Even now, with their parents gone, they kept up with this tradition, trying to make things as “normal” as possible. <br />
<br />
But this night was not normal. After the three all drank the blue drink given to Brian from Madame Illusia, their bodies were on the verge of change. <br />
<br />
As they slept, the three boys started moaning and groaning in their sleep. Their dreams were not of anything particular, but from the outside, you would though they were romantic in nature. <br />
<br />
Brian was the first to show some change. Having kicked off his covers during the night, his briefs give a noticeable little twitch as his small boyhood starts to grow. At first, it thickens, his balls inflating some. From the outside, one could see the mushroom tip slowly become visible under the fabric of the briefs. Then the tip starts to slide downward, meeting the bottom of the growing balls. Brian’s mouth opens, letting out a loud moan as the fabric of his briefs become tight. <br />
<br />
Still asleep, Brian’s hands grab at his mattress as he lays on his back. His muscles start to tense up, his changes spreading slowly across his body. His fingernails and toenails turn black as his young teen chest pushes up. His stomach flattens as his baby fat burns away before small “bubbles” start to form. These bubbles are the start of his six pack, though they look to be more for sumo then a bodybuilder. His arms and legs thicken, his overall size growing slightly. <br />
<br />
Brian’s hips lift up some, as a new appendage grows from his tailbone. His new tail thickens as it slides along his but crack and down underneath his still largening ball sack. With a slight grunt from his mouth, the tail rips through the briefs, sowing his new leather balls and now almost bullish cock. The balls and cock take the new freedom to grow slightly more, his tip now hanging over the lager balls and touching the bed. <br />
<br />
As he continues to sleep, the last changes for now are two small horns growing on the sides of his head, his ears growing to points with a slight dusting of dark brown fur. <br />
<br />
A cross the room from him, Brian’s slightly younger brother Matt, was moaning to his own changes. His own boyhood started twitching and growing, but not to the degree of his brother. The thicken and inflate, staying inside their respective briefs. Under his sheets, he clings to his stomach as it flattens out. His body takes on more of a runner or swimmer physicality to his, as his finger and toenails turn black. He lets out a small grunt, turning to his side, as his waistband slides down to show the growing deet tail from above his butt crack. Small antlers start to form on his temple, protruding just a few inches. <br />
<br />
A cross the hall; Joseph was experiencing his own change. The young man, slowly dripping in sweet, moaning and groaning as his first changes took effect. His body is twitching fiercely under the sheets. Small whines escape his mouth as a tent start to form under the sheets. Ripping noises could be heard, as his hardening manhood started suppressing not only it’s limits, but the limits of Joseph’s briefs. Soon, the tip of the tent falls to Josephs stomach as his cock and balls tear free of their constraints. His mushroom head pushes upwards along his body, a middle ring forming for support, as it slows to just below his chest. <br />
<br />
At the same time, Joseph’s muscles ripple under the sheets. His arms and legs thickening to great proportions. His ass widens, as his thighs bulge, ripping the last remains of his undergarments. His fingers and toenails turn black as well, but not before his ears grow pointed on top of his head and a horse’s tail snakes its way down his butt crack. <br />
<br />
Some hours later, the brothers slowly away to their initial changes. Matt lets out a loud cry for his brothers, seeing his fingers and toes change. Slowly waking up, Brian is too met with his changes, his half bull cock now dangling as he stands at the end of his bed. <br />
Not realizing his changes at first, Joseph rushes into his brother’s room. “What is going on? What’s wrong?” <br />
<br />
“Big brother…” Matt’s eyes watered as he stood, showing his fingers. <br />
<br />
“Something is happening to use…” Brain then sees the new rod dangling between his brother’s legs. “TO YOU TOO!” he points. <br />
“What?” Joseph looks down, before seeing his changes. “What is going on?” <br />
<br />
Safely away for now, Madame Illusia watches the boys from afar. She gives a slight smile, “Let’s finish their changes, before I go onto the next part.” <br />
<br />
Back with the brother’s, Joseph walks up to Brain. “Could this be from that drink you gave us?” <br />
<br />
“I don’t know… I…” Brian cuts out as both he and Joseph hear an inhuman moan from Matt. <br />
<br />
Looking over, the two older brothers watch as Matt’s body starts twitching. His muscles stretch and grow, a light covering of white and light brown fur growing over, matching his dear tail. His black toes start to inflate, before merging into a two toe hoofs. His fingers thicken as the fur covers, his five fingers merging to three. He could still grip with these hands, as shown as he holds his head. His face slowly pushes out, his moans and groans growing louder and more deer like. His antlers grow out a few more inches as his ears move to their new location. The last change of the new antro deer boy was his cock, it grows slightly large along with his balls inside his briefs. As he was the youngest and smallest animal of the three brothers’, his didn’t rip off. With that said, as his changes ended, his briefs disappeared from his body, as well as the clothes in his closet. Madame Illusia smiles, as antro didn’t need clothes. <br />
<br />
“My god!” was all Brain could get out while he and his older brother watch on. He turns to Joseph and opens his mouth. “What is…Ooohhh.” <br />
<br />
Brian grabs at his dangling bullhood as his changes continued. With Matt distracted with his new body, Brian and Joseph watch on as Brain’s cock slowly started to grow again. It started growing longer and slightly thicker, resembling a mix of a bull and a human’s genitals. No sheath was here, though it wouldn’t hide much. <br />
<br />
Dark brown fur spread out from Brian’s groin, the muscles under the new fur growing and twitching. Brian slowly grows taller, as his body becomes stronger. Now looking more like a linebacker, in a kid’s body, Brian’s horns grow further out the sides of his head. His face pushes out, his ears flaring into that of bull’s and his muzzle taking shape. His feet, too, grow and stretch into two toe hoof limbs, his fingers thickening and merging from five fingers to three. <br />
<br />
With his waist expanding, the left overs of his briefs burst apart as his bull tail sways side to side. His ass expands, legs strengthening to hold up his new bullish physic. But, unlike his younger brother, Brian’s cock starts to stir. <br />
<br />
He had experience a wet dream or two, and his body was showing what he could do now. His new cock hardens, facing outward. Joseph, smartly, backs out of the way as Brain lets out a beastly call. Pre starts to form at the inflame tip of his cock, sweet dripping from his face. A pleasurable pulse comes from his body, just as his releases his first seed as an antro bull. <br />
<br />
Same as his younger brother, what remained of his clothes soon disappeared from his body and the room. Catching his breath, Brain looks up at his older brother with knowing eyes. Joseph nods back, as he feels his changes coming. <br />
<br />
Joseph grabs his sides, his back starting to ripple. His shoulders slowly move apart as his frame gains mass. His legs thicken greatly, showing legs muscles that even a mister universe would be envious of. His feet form one large horse hoof each, them growing to hold up his new weight. Brown and tan fur starts to cover his body, whimpers and whines escaping from his growing face. His head forms to that of a horse, as his fingers fuse like is siblings. The big difference here was that Joseph new growth was much larger than his brothers. <br />
<br />
While Matt grew only a few inches and Brain grew about eight inches, Joseph grew almost a foot and an half taller. His horse-man body filled out, audibly stretching like leather. Even his already impressive cock and balls grew more, keeping in pace with his body. His tip, which still looked mostly human, now reached down to his knees. Giving that the young man was pushing almost eight feet in height, it was impressive to say the least. <br />
<br />
As his new mane grow over his back and down to his shoulder blades, Joseph’s eyes widen. Just as Brian experienced his new seed, Joseph would do the same. His new half horse cock sprang to life, lifting up, and pointed across the room. Brain ran, grabbing Matt and pulling him to the floor and out of the way just as the first waves came out of the horse-man. He lets out a loud beastly whine, as the pleasure overtook him for the moment. AS the other two, with his changes ended, Madame Illusia then took the liberty of wiping away the need for clothes. <br />
<br />
As Joseph’s libido calmed down, the three brothers look each other over. They were in shock and awe of their changes. Joseph suggested the three take quick showers, as to clean off the mess that he and brain made, before meeting down in the kitchen. After the showers, and Joseph taking care of the seed that was all over his younger brother’s rooms, they walk down together, hoping to talk at the dinner table. <br />
But as they arrive to the kitchen, they are met by Madame Illusia. “So, boys, what do you think?”</p>
