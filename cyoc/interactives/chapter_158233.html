<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty was feeling like someone new. He loved his new size and the way new clothes felt on his body. But after buying so many things he grew hungry and started walking towards the mall&#39;s Burger King. However, as he was going that way, he realized &quot;Why would I go buy a crappy cheap meal when I could go to one of those fancy restaurants&quot; He thought. Thus, Ty went into the most expensive restaurant he could find in that place. He knew he could just go to a real classy restaurant if he wanted, one outside the mall of course, but he wanted to experience everything, so why not start with the mall? Which is already familiar. <br />
<br />
Ty walked in and was welcomed by a nicely dressed guy at what he could only describe as the reception of the restaurant. He towered over the guy for at least 6 inches. He was asked if he had any reservations, to which he said he did have one. He made it so that he had one and all the other ones were cancelled. He loved using his powers and trying new things, but he liked exploring everything alone, without so many people staring at him or whatever. <br />
<br />
He was, thus, lead to a table for one, where he sat with his long legs spread out. A few seconds later, an evenly nicely dressed man approached him with the menu. To Ty&#39;s surprise, the man didn&#39;t grow restless or asked him to rush his order as he was used to, he just stood there, waiting patiently at Ty&#39;s order. Ty smiled to him and handed over the menu &quot;I want 2 of everything, fast&quot; He said. The waiter&#39;s eyes grew wide at Ty&#39;s request and asked him if he heard him right. Ty only nodded and emphasized the &#39;fast&#39; part again. He was hungry and he didn&#39;t like that. With a thought, he made the cooks work extremely fast and for the food to cook just as fast as well. Not even 5 minutes later, the waiter was cooming and going from the kitchen pushing a food cart with plates on top of plates of food. <br />
<br />
Ty knew he couldn&#39;t just eat that much, but it was nothing but a simple task to make his belly able to take everything. Pleased, Ty started eating mouthfull after mouthful. He had enough food to feed 40 people easy, but why should he hold back? He was hungry and everything just looked and tasted so delicious. He ordered the waiter to bring him beer and a few bottles of wine, the most expensive ones. He wasn&#39;t planning on getting drunk, but he just wanted to try everything. He could make himself immune to getting drunk anyway, so it didn&#39;t really matter. <br />
<br />
While eating his third plate, he decided to read the waiter&#39;s mind, as he kept on giving him glances from time to time. Ty found out that the waiter&#39;s name was Ed, and that he was utterly surprised at seeing someone eat so much. <br />
<br />
On his fourth plate, Ty ordered Ed to sit across from him and to rub his feet. He just blatantly used his power to make Ed do it, to which of course Ed had no resistance. He immediatly sat across from Ty and, after very carefully putting Ty&#39;s new flip flops aside on the floor, he started massaging his big feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Ed&quot; Said Ty inbetween plates. &quot;This is a very nice place, have you been working long?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yes sir, about 4 years already&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty really liked to ring to being called &#39;sir&#39;, so he made sure Ed didn&#39;t forget on calling him like that from now on. He was the bigger man after all. He also made Ed to become a very honest person, honest to never lie kind of person. <br />
<br />
&quot;You like this place?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, very much so, sir&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a very nice place, and the food is awasome, you think your boss appreciates it enough?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really sir. He&#39;s often out of town, doesn&#39;t pay much to us, and rarely does he pay attention to our client&#39;s needs. We still don&#39;t have a vegan menu&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds awful&quot; Ty had really liked the place, but the lack of staff and the fact that there weren&#39;t that many reservations to begin with made him think that the place wasn&#39;t taken care of very well. <br />
<br />
&quot;BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURP&quot; After chugging down a few liters of beer, Ty burped right before he kept on eating. He was enjoying the massage Ed was giving him a lot. &quot;Oh, I guess I know what to do&quot;. He, then, made for the owner to show up at his table, he came walking from the back. <br />
<br />
Ty was going to be the new owner of the restaurant. He could just think of him being the new owner, but he sort of wanted to know how much the owner would sell it for. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, Ed! What are you doing!? Stop that right this moment!&quot; Said the owned, but Ed refused, he was dutifully doing his job and was at the right place, making sure his soon-to-be new boss was pleased and relaxed while massaging his toes. <br />
<br />
Ty made him forget all about it and went to the chase. &quot;How much for this place?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? what are you talking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How much? I don&#39;t like to repeat myself&quot; Ty made the owner get the hint and a little more.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry sir, a million dollars&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;are you being honest? that&#39;s how much this place is worth?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir. I swear&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A million it is then, you take cash?&quot; Said Ty with a smile. He knew the now old boss wasn&#39;t lying as he made him be honest and to be extremely respectful to him. He also made sure to skip any red tape and make all the papers have his name from now on. After ordering the former owner to leave, he put Ed in charge. He also made Ed extremely knowledgeable in finances and how to administrate a restaurant. Now, Ty could come to his restaurant to eat whatever he wanted and as many times as he liked. <br />
<br />
He also made sure to get to know his employees and doubled everyone&#39;s salary as well. In addition, he decided on re-naming the restaurant and named it &quot;Ty&#39;s Kitchen&quot;. It was unoriginal, but he could change it whenever he wanted it anyway. <br />
<br />
His employees were dumbfounded at the fact he was only 15, but the papers said his legal guardian authorized it. Besides, the teen hunk was so impressive in person, that no one was actually able to object, even less so after all of them got their salaries checked.<br />
<br />
After settling down everything, Ty decided to go back home to Dustin and the rest of his family. He was now more used to his new power and knew exactly what he wanted to do. Then, right after taking his bags, with a snap of his fingers he was back home again.</p>
