<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The time between when Janice and Snowflake got pregnant and had to give birth went by fast. It was right on Christmas Day. The whole family was home. Luna and Lia had agreed that with everything going on that they&#39;d be more help to stay home until all the birthing stuff is done, thus far. Janice and Snowflake did blossom and they just passed their thirteenth birthday. Sally and Charlie were very excited and nervous as was Midnight, Talia, Janice and Snowflake. However they were expecting Janice and Snowflake to be able to wait until the new year. Janice and Snowflake were sitting closest to the presents, doubt on wiether or not the two would be good parents was gone with how responsibility the two were already taking. Maurice and Snowy had agreed that if Midnight and Talia would like to, they could adopt and take care of the cubs. Alia was sitting beside Pinkie and talking. &quot;Pinkie, I talked to mom, shi said if it&#39;s okay with Luna and Lia, I can go with, as a sort of exchange student.&quot;<br />
<br />
That brightened Pinkie up as shi and Alia had become good friends, they both agreed that they, if they should become mates, they would wait for that decision until they were at least eighteen, seventeen the minimum for they knew the risks. Brent had been elected as this years Sankat Clause. Shi was calling out name just as Janice would reach for hir present shi would freeze solid as the contractions would hit hir like a ton of bricks. Shi looked down going bright red as there was a pool of liquid. Shi looked up covering hir face. &quot;Mom, I&#39;m sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For what dear?&quot; Sally would look then stand, shi&#39;d move close to Janice. &quot;Okay sweety let&#39;s go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, I know. Me and Snowflake have been practicing. We&#39;re ready.&quot; Janice said with a near grownup tone. Shi stood slowly, Snowflake with hir. They went to hir room and lied down. Ronnie was supposed to do the sea section but shi and Mina had an emergency of their own to take care of. One of the orphans had to have a transplant due to the smaller heart failing in hir. Janice was lying there wincing in pain as hir mom went to one side, and Snowflake to the other. Charlie moved up and stood right there, rubbing Janice&#39;s lower feet. Pinkie, worried about hir sister moved up and lied beside hir, rubbing hir sides to help ease the pain.<br />
<br />
Charlie was frantic on what to do as Snowy walked up. &quot;Charlie, you&#39;re going to have to help deliver your granddaughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... shi&#39;s supposed to have a sea...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Charlie, there&#39;s no time. Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie nodded. &quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie moved and looked. &quot;Okay, Janice, look at daddy. You&#39;re going to have to push. Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y... yes daddy.&quot; Shi was panting hard as shi gripped Snowflake and hir mother&#39;s hands tightly, making both wince.<br />
<br />
As the process happened it took nearly fifteen minutes but as Charlie helped finish the little chakat into this world, Ronnie walked in. The little kat was crying as Charlie shed a tear and had a smile on hir face. Shi looked and went over to wash hir off. Mina came in from behind and went up and smiled once shi found the kat, fortunately, was very healthy. &quot;Well, Charlie, looks like you get to sign hir birth certificate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You delivered your granddaughter, therefore you will sign it.&quot; Shi looked at Janice. &quot;Hun, no need to worry, shi is healthy, very much so.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie turned, wrapped hir in a blanket and handed hir to Janice. Janice kissed hir forehead. &quot;Shi&#39;s as pink as hir aunt.&quot; Shi smiled. &quot;Pinkie Christmas Wise.&quot; Shi looked. &quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind, Pinkie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because, you&#39;re my best friend. What more reason do I need?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pinkie smiled. &quot;I love it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Snowy handed Janice a bottle with a smile. &quot;Here. Maurice made the formula. Shi&#39;s replicating it just in case there are repeats, girls who do like you did.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shi nodded. &quot;Thank you.&quot; Shi began feeding the kitten who just purred and went to sleep.<br />
<br />
The fact that Snowflake hadn&#39;t gone into labor yet worried Ronnie however. Shi looked at Mina and walked over. &quot;Go get the ultrasound.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I have a bad feeling.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, dear.&quot; Mina walked off and grabbed what shi needed and soon returned. <br />
<br />
Shi started it up and Ronnie started examining hir niece. &quot;Oh my. This is not good. Snowflake, get on Pinkie&#39;s bed and on your back. Now. Mina, get your gear on now, we have to get an emergency sea section done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright.&quot; Shi said and got hir stuff on. They rushed Snowflake to the other bed and got right to work. Ronnie then looked. &quot;Snowflake, we&#39;re going to have to gas you, put you to sleep temporary. Okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Uncle Ronnie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice was sitting there, trying not to panic. Just as that happened Midnight let out an earsplitting scream as shi was at the door watching, shi fell over holding hir lower belly. Janice looked. &quot;Mom...&quot; Shi pulled at Sally&#39;s outfit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, I&#39;m kinda making sure Snowflake&#39;s okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let your mom be right now.&quot; Charlie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;MOM, Midnight&#39;s hurting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally looked down. &quot;Hun, that&#39;s nice but....&quot; Shi froze. &quot;What?&quot; Shi turned and ran to Midnight, Luna already by hir side. Charlie looked over and went to Midnight. Janice looked at Pinkie. &quot;Can you go tell Talia, Midnight is having baby?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep.&quot; Pinkie jumped up and ran out the other door to get to the living room. Janice stood up and carried hir little one over, walking right too Snowflake, walking to the otherside and taking hir hand. &quot;I&#39;m here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Janice, hun, you need to focus on your little one.&quot; Ronnie looked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am. I&#39;m just here to let Snowflake know I&#39;m here for hir.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No you need to be over there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;RONNIE!&quot; Snowy looked at hir. &quot;If this was Mina in this position, you in Janice&#39;s, what would you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I don&#39;t...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ronnie, shi&#39;s not going anywhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, but if I say move, do so, Janice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice nodded.<br />
<br />
Ronnie had to cut along the belly, just beside Snowflake&#39;s sheath, being extremely cautious. Snowflake was asleep during the process. Fortunately the procedure was a success. The child was healthy, the reason shi hadn&#39;t broken out like hir sister was the cord was around hir neck. Snowflake was stapled up and had to rest while Janice tended the two little ones. Ronnie then ran to Midnight to make sure shi was okay, by the time shi got there though, Midnight had given birth to twins. How they were undetected and how they weren&#39;t born earlier was a mystery to all. Talia only smiled as shi kissed Midnight. Sally was next to go into pain. Shi was in hir bed relaxing when hir water broke. Mina was walking by and right up. During the excitement shi called for help but none heard hir. Mina walked up. &quot;Sally, looks like it&#39;s you and me.&quot; Shi said.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least I don&#39;t have to deliver solo.&quot; Sally giggled painfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right. So, singles?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trips.&quot; Shi said. &quot;My mom heard their heartbeats.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mina smiled. &quot;Well, then let&#39;s get those babies out and into this world.&quot; Shi walked up.<br />
----------------------------------<br />
By the end of the day, only Charlie and Talia hadn&#39;t given birth, well, at the end Charlie did give birth, however Talia didn&#39;t until six in the morning. Born to Janice was Pinkie Christmas Wise. Born to Snowflake, Ashalin Pinksnow Chakat. Born to Midnight Spina and Casto Wise, Born to Sally, Charles III Wise, Penelope, and Bethany Wise. Born to Charlie, Zachius and born to Talia, Starlete. Pinkie Christmas was, as hir name, pink from head to toe. Save for hir ears. They were the color of a pine tree, and considering their shape reminded Janice of a Christmas Tree. Ashalin was all pink as well, a splash of white was on the tip of hir ears however. Spina and Casto were Talia&#39;s color, had Talia&#39;s wings but, other than the tail resembled their mom, the tail was Talia&#39;s of course. Charles III was Black with blue spots over the eyes. The edge of hir tail were like hir dad&#39;s. Penelope and Bethany resembled their mother fully save for their tails, like their sister, they inherited their father&#39;s. Zachius was like hir mom, born with two sets of nipples. Shi unlike hir mother and father, as if nature couldn&#39;t decide, was born with two tails, one like hir mom&#39;s and one like hir dad&#39;s.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, each got a good Christmas gift. Snowflake and Janice had signed the papers at the start of the week, but Midnight and Talia said that they&#39;d let them stay for the first week. Everyone went home to rest, only Snowflake who was sleeping on Pinkie&#39;s bed had to stay there after the bed was cleaned of the mess on the blankets, which earned the wrath from Sally, but shi for gave hir knowing that all those born were healthy. Janice was purring as shi slept by the crib with hir own children in them. Sally only would smile and closed the door behind hir. Shi would then head to hir room where Charlie was in the room with their four, feeding all four at once. Sally only giggled. &quot;Now I finally a see a use for four breasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie only laughed. &quot;Love, why did you insist the name Charles continued?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hun, shi&#39;s going to be like you and your dad. Full of love.&quot; Shi lied down beside hir and they snuggled close. &quot;I&#39;m proud of our girls you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Midnight and Janice? I am too. Both handled themselves very well. And you know. Perhaps we didn&#39;t do anything wrong with the girls. Perhaps, we&#39;ve done everything correct.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you not notice how Janice handled the situation?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hun, when Janice and Snowflake hit the proper age for their next little ones, they will be well overly prepared. We raised them correctly. And I wager Janice and Snowflake wouldn&#39;t have done what they did if they didn&#39;t think they were ready. Physically I know they weren&#39;t ready but in their hearts they were fully ready. Next time around however, they will be more than ready for a family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree, Charlie. And you know, I did notice something about Janice lastnight. Shi was lactating all night. Even thought hir breasts weren&#39;t deveoloped.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Love, I think they were.&quot; Charlie said as shi stood and took the four to their beds.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, when Snowy and Maurice made the original virus we had feline dna incorperated in us, did it not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, felines develope fast. Perhaps it was hir feline side that took over. Thus letting hir lactate. Grant it the size was not what you&#39;d think but, perhaps it was more the feline gland.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm... makes since. Well, let&#39;s go to sleep my love. The next day we are planning two weddings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Two weddings?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom is marrying Anubis, and Timothy is going to marry Casey Jones.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah. When do they want it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Valentines Day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a month and a half away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but at least we&#39;re getting it out of the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good point.&quot; Charlie smiled and the two lied down to sleep.<br />
---------------------------------<br />
Pinkie decided to stay over at Alia&#39;s. Shi had put a belt around the front part of hir sheath and something over hir pussy to help hir resist what hir sister could not. Alia smiled. &quot;I told you. Your sisterly bond with Janice is stronger than ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that now.&quot; Shi smiled. &quot;But I&#39;m still going to go with Luna, I hope you are too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You bet your tail I am. Say what&#39;s with that device?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s to help me resist what happened with Jan and Snowflake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you make me one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it shouldn&#39;t be too hard.&quot; Pinkie giggled and the two got to work.<br />
<br />
-------------------------<br />
<br />
Midnight and Talia were sitting there just planning to raise five little ones. Midnight knew shi was going to have hir paws full, but knew Talia would be with hir along the way. Ronnie and Mina were sitting there, glad the mess was over with. Ronnie looked at Mina. &quot;You know, everyone&#39;s having children but you and I. What do you say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our next heat cycle. But we&#39;ll have to do so at seperate times. You halfway through my pregnancy and you halfway through yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Deal.&quot; Ronnie smiled as Snowy walked up. &quot;Thank you, both.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem, Snowy. You would&#39;ve done the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right, Mina.&quot;<br />
<br />
---------------------<br />
<br />
Luna smiled looking at Lia. &quot;We&#39;re next. However ours will be born in France.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, they will, Lia.&quot;<br />
--------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Maria and Raul were in the jail talking to the scientist female who helped them. &quot;Look, we pulled strings and you will spend three years in this cell then you&#39;re a free woman. However you will stay here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. So when&#39;s the trial?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The fifteenth. The fifteenth of January.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; She looked. &quot;Thank you, Maria, Thank you Raul.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, my dear, thank you. Had you not decided to help us, we would&#39;ve never seen the end of the outbreaks and the prevention of World War 3.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When you&#39;re out, Raul and I have set up a room for you, to help you get back on your feet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that they left the jail to the scientists to think it over. The female was ignoring them as they conviced her to continue Li Sang&#39;s work but she fully refused. She only did it as a favor to him. Nothing more, and now she did it she was no longer going to attempt stuff like this again, however she did intend to help clean up the mess she created.</p>
