<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Give me those socks!  We&#39;re gonna make Kurt into Greg!&quot;<br />
Devon found a pair of discarded shorts on the floor and slid them on, and looked over and smiled as Henry peeled the socks off his feet, looking down at the chubby toes and feet of Devon, realizing how cute they were.<br />
<br />
Snatching the socks, Devon grabbed the sandals that belonged to Greg from when he was 9, and headed to his bedroom door.  <br />
&quot;Wanna come?&quot; Devon asked.<br />
<br />
Henry nodded obediently at his slightly older twin, and found some briefs that were on the floor.  When in Rome, right?  The two boys stepped out into the hallway and looked at Kurt&#39;s door.  Padding over to the door, Devon looked back at Kurt and pressed his finger to his lips, motioning for him to be quiet.<br />
<br />
Devon gently turned the knob to Kurt&#39;s bedroom door and slowly swung the door open and peeked his head in, glancing around in the room, and found that Kurt had dozed off while watching TV.  Stepping into the room, Devon was giddy as he made sure Henry followed, and closed the door behind them both.<br />
<br />
Devon shook the socks out and handed one to Henry and took the other one and lifted up the sheets, exposing Kurts size 11 feet.  Devon spread the sock open and started to slide them on the feet of his big brother, looking at Henry and nodding to get Henry to start doing the same to the other foot.  Once the socks were on,  Devon handed Henry a sandal, and then took the other one and started to mess with the velcro straps, but realized how noisy they were.  Devon decided faster was better, so he ripped the straps open as fast as he could, and then nodded to Henry to do the same.  After the sandals were prepped, Devon and Henry put them onto Kurts feet.  They looked ridiculously small.   <br />
<br />
Kurt, who was lightly dozing was slowly wakening from the disturbances.  The socks being put on his feet and the noise of the velcro had pulled him from his deep sleep, and now the odd feeling of something placed on his feet were making him awaken.  When Kurt cracked his eyes open, he saw Devon....and Devon....at his feet.  Rubbing his eyes in confusion, he sat up, looking down again, true to what he thought, there was two Devons there, and some kids sandals on his feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Devon? What the fu....&quot;<br />
<br />
Before he could finish, he realized something was wrong.  His whole body is tingling, and it felt like a million needles poking him.  And since he hasn&#39;t been able to relieve himself for days, he had a raging hard on under his boxers.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Just go along with it Kurt, we&#39;re gonna have some fun...&quot; Devon tried to explain, seeing his brothers face change, hair darkening and eyes changing shape. <br />
<br />
Kurt looked at his feet, which seemed to be getting closer to him, and the sandals that were on his feet seemed to be getting bigger too, until he realized that his feet were shrinking.  <br />
<br />
Kurt was terrified.  There were two Devon&#39;s and now he was shrinking.  Kurt realized that his hand  and foot no longer hurt, and were actually falling out of the bandage wrap the doctor had applied.  Looking at his arm which was no longer in pain, he realized that the skin had taken a dusky tan hue, and the body hair had disappeared from them, leaving him smooth.  Kurt tossed the sheets off as his twin visitors looked on with interest, looking at the skateboard brand logo shirt he fit into nicely now hung over his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whats happening? Why..&quot; He put his hand over his mouth as the sound stunned him.  His voice was much higher than before.<br />
<br />
Devon smiled and looked down at the boy that was about 11 now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Youre gonna be my friend Greg, and we&#39;re gonna have some fun....oh, and that other me? Thats Henry....hes gonna have fun too...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kurts eyes darted back and forth at the two boys, not able to quite process what Devon was saying.  One thing for sure was happening, which his physical size disappearing, his emotional side was also losing maturity.  Kurt was very scared. He had not been this scared since he was a kid...subconsciously, he reached down to grab himself like a little boy does, only to be met with a raging stiffy that makes him moan out.  Out of curiosity, he slides down his underpants, exposing a not quite 3 inch, stiff uncut winkie,  devoid of all hair.  The sight terrifies and makes him excited all at once.  He should know what to do with it, but he can&#39;t remember.  <br />
<br />
He looks back at the two boys in front of him, now slightly bigger than he is.  Kurt was kind of an asshole to Devon, and now Devon had the upper hand physically.  Devon easily had 30 pounds on the newly made 9 year old Korean boy staring back at him, but Devon had backup with Henry. Kurt&#39;s mind raced as he felt things that he was looking for in his mind, not available anymore.  He gulped and grabbed himself again, moaning with his high pitched voice, which made him cringe with nervousness as well as excitement.</p>
