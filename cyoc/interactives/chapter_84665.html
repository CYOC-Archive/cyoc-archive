<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Justin took hir place at the front of the church, Raul had politely asked if he could do the honors in escorting Talia up to the alter. It had been aranged that shi&#39;d act as the bride while Midnight would be the groom. Charlie was with Luna and Lia helping Midnight get dressed. Danna had made an unusual tuxido for her. Meaning the top would fit comfortably and made some strange pant like things ment only to cover the lower body. Midnight shivered having been nervous. &quot;Dad, I, uh... I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m ready.&quot; Shi said pinning hir ears back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, can you give me and Mid a moment alone.&quot; Luna looked. &quot;You too Lia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; The two left the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Darrik, look. I told you no matter what happened you and I would always be brothers. And I&#39;d always be there for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you have meen Rick. You&#39;ve been there all this time.&quot; Midnight would say.<br />
<br />
The two never used their birth names, unless they were talking brother to brother. Luna looked over. &quot;But, I&#39;m not always going to be able to take care of you, you know that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That I do, but what are you saying?&quot; Midnight asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;These missions are becoming more and more dangerous. The next one, I will be stepping in for aunt Jess, and Lia will be stepping in for Mom. Flake will step in for dad. I just need you to be prepared for the worst, and you getting married to Talia, that is the best way to prepare you. If you&#39;re not ready, you&#39;re not ready. We can always plan for it another day, and the way Talia looks at you, shi&#39;ll wait for you for eternity if shi must. You and I have been best friends since the day mom and dad brought you home from the hospital. To.... to.... see them dead, had Sally and Charlie not have taken us in, I&#39;d have taken you to an orphanage and ran away. They are our new mom and dad, but they won&#39;t be around forever either. We need to stand on our own four paws.&quot; shi walked over, and for a moment in each other&#39;s eyes they didn&#39;t see wolfkats when they were alone. They saw two small little boys who were best friends. Long before they ever became kats. &quot;Even in the midst of a battle field, I&#39;d come to save you. Hell if I were on my death bed, I&#39;d come for you. But now, you are getting asked to do a job and have the official title. I won&#39;t make you marry Talia just yet. The time to do so is your choice, not mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand, Rick.&quot; At that the two siblings hugged. &quot;You know, it feels funny, when you think about it, when we were kids we didn&#39;t have mountains on your chests. Now after twelve years, it feels wierd.&quot; Shi giggled.<br />
<br />
Luna laughed. &quot;Yes, it does. Come, I&#39;ll see you out at the alter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna walked out and looked at the other three. &quot;Shall we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Mid...&quot; Charlie started.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, shi&#39;ll be along, just give hir time.&quot; Luna smiled. &quot;Shi just has butterflies.&quot;<br />
<br />
An hour later and Midnight was at the front waiting. Her adopted uncle, despite hir quirks, found with the multi arm thing, shi can play the organ perfectly so she started the wedding march. Once Talia was up front Raul began. &quot;Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to join these two lovely kats in holy matramony. If there is anyone who is foolish enough to think that these two shall not get married, let the speak now and die a horrible death or forever hold their peace.&quot; And just to get everyone&#39;s attention, Raul shot two rounds in the air, just to wake them up.<br />
<br />
Justin then walked up. &quot;Easy Raul, no one will object.&quot; Raul smiled and stepped down as Justin looked. &quot;Now let us begin. Talia, do you take Midnight, to be your lawfully wedded wolfkat, to have and to hold, for richer or for poor, in sickness and in health, to death do you part?&quot;<br />
<br />
Talia smiled. &quot;Oh, death will not part us, my dear, and to answer your question, I absolutely do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin smiled. &quot;And Midnight...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You best believe it. There&#39;s no one else for me.&quot; Midnight responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now the rings.&quot; He said.<br />
<br />
Diamond handed Midnight hir ring and as a twist in tradition bent down and put the ring on the ring finger of hir forward foothand. Talia did the same.<br />
<br />
Justin smiled. &quot;Now by the power bestowed upon me, by the nation of France, I now declare you Wolfkat and Wife. You may kiss the bride.&quot;<br />
<br />
Talia and Midnight kissed each other deeply. &quot;Ladies and gentlekats, it give me great pleasure to introduce you to Mrs. Midnight and Mrs. Talia Wise.&quot; Justin smiled as they walked down the asle, As they did so, everyone caught a glimpse of Midnight&#39;s wings growing out.<br />
<br />
Once outside, she looked right at Talia. &quot;I got a surprise, my love.&quot; Talia then could feel Midnight wrapping her own pure snow white wings around her. Where Talia&#39;s looked like a pair of eagle wings, Midnights resembled that of massive dove wings.<br />
<br />
Talia smiled looking. &quot;I love them, hun.&quot; The two kissed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that&#39;s part of the surprise. I decided we should move.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I love our house.&quot; Talia said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, but Talia, we need our own. Give mom and dad their space.&quot; Shi extended hir wings and in moments shi was in the air heading in a direction, Talia soon followed. Midnight smiled as hir surprise was now complete and landed there.<br />
<br />
As Talia approached she saw it. It was a pyramid, built in Janice. Shi landed and walked right up. &quot;It&#39;s wonderful... wait, is that...&quot; She looked at a building.<br />
<br />
&quot;The new school? Yes it is. It&#39;s built into it.&quot; Midnight giggled.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
After all the celebration the past week had, Sally and Jess had decided they would leave without so much as a word. They had to find their mother, even if she were dead, she would be brought home. They did leave a note and headed strait to DIA (Denver International (Imaginary) Airport). The only two who truely knew where they were going were Maria and Raul, who set them up with a plan to take them there. It was a long flight, and considering summer there was in four weeks, it only ment they had four weeks to get there, look for her and get back or they&#39;re stuck in Antarctica for three to four months.<br />
<br />
They arrived in two days, having to stop in Buenos Aires to fuel up. Once they arrived they were thankful they had fur. For if they didn&#39;t, they&#39;d be freezing. Once they were out the plane took off and the two sisters began walking through the snow. They knew that they&#39;d probably scare their mother half to death, if she wasn&#39;t dead should they find her.<br />
<br />
Sally and Jess watched as the plane took off headed back to Buenos Aires. They had a short time to contact them and be ready, but they knew that they would find her.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
With one day left, Sally and Jess had found clues, fresh clues of their mother, and knew she was infact still alive. The question was no longer if. The question became &quot;Where is she?&quot; Sally and Jess continued their search, even walking amongst some penguins to do so.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve always adored penguins.&quot; Sally said. &quot;But, I think I&#39;ve seen my fair share.&quot; She giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sal, look.&quot; Jess ran and found something. It looked like a cavern, but it even felt warm. But that&#39;s not what got hir attention. Shi walked right in and found someone sleeping. A lady, with her hair brushed. Jess froze once she looked at her. &quot;SALLY, I FOUND Her.&quot; Jess knelt down and felt her. &quot;Shi&#39;s still alive.&quot; Shi said. &quot;Warm but loosing heat. We&#39;ve got to warm her with our bodies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally ran in. &quot;I&#39;m coming sis.&quot; Sally and Jess both hugged their mother between them to get her warmed up.<br />
<br />
In about a few hours their mother stirred. &quot;Wh... why am...&quot; She smiled. &quot;Feels like fur.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom?&quot; Jess said then looked in her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, it&#39;s Jessica and Sally.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My baby girls?&quot; She looked up. &quot;But why do you look like a feline and a fox?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Long story mom, but for now, we got to get you home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t. I&#39;m not strong enough to move.&quot; She argued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, I can carry you.&quot; Jess said. Shi turned to hir sister. &quot;Radio the plane.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally nodded. &quot;Can anyone hear me, over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We read you loud and clear Sally. Over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We found our objective. We are moving north, should be at our Rondevoue in two hours. Rondevoue Six.&quot; She looked at the map.<br />
<br />
&quot;Copy that, kats, we&#39;ll be on our way now. Pick up eta, two hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally smiled and looked. &quot;You want me to carry mom? I&#39;m only a month pregnant, and with your arm still re....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax, Sally, I got mom. Let&#39;s move.&quot; She said as they grabbed their mother and the bags she had. The two sisters ran across the frozen desert.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
During the two hour run, Jess had time to explain everything that had happened in the last twelve years. Their mother had explained that they left her for dead, she even had to resort to eating penquin flesh to survive the harsh twelve years. Fortunately ice worked for water. What baffeled their daughters was why the cave was so warm, but their mother stated that she&#39;d tell once they were home.  They made it to where they were and Sally popped smoke, with the signal flare. The craft landed on the run way, slowed enough for the two to get on. Once on the aircraft took to the air again closing the door behind. Jess let their mother rest as they sat together. &quot;All this time, we said she was dead, and now we&#39;ve got her back.&quot; Sally spoke.<br />
<br />
Jess had nodded at their successfull trip, but shi was curious as to why it was so warm in that cave and wouldn&#39;t let it escape hir mind. But instead of thinking on it, shi and Sally just went to sleep. They had arrived over US soil and Jess even had the pilot land in the landing strip in Janice, so that way their mother could get immediate attention. Once they landed they rushed their mother to the hospital. Fortunately, appart from frost bite and a few broken bones here and there, she was in perfect health, but was recomended to rest for a few weeks to build up energy and to adjust to the climate. It was then, they held a meeting of their discovery.<br />
----------------------------------------------------<br />
&quot;The cave was rather warm.&quot; Jess said. &quot;Very warm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Raul looked. &quot;How warm, may I ask?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, let&#39;s just say it had it&#39;s own natural heat.&quot;  Sally answered.<br />
<br />
Charlie looked at hir mate then to Jess. &quot;What could it be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. Mom said she&#39;d tell us once we got her home.&quot; Shi said. &quot;Nikole is in with her now, considering they were close friends.&quot; Sally replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I don&#39;t think Nikole will be leaving her side until she is one hundred percent. Meaning, we&#39;re replacing another team mate.&quot; Jess said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Correction, the full team is being replaced, if the original isn&#39;t fully ready.&quot; Raul announced.<br />
<br />
Brent was sitting in the corner. &quot;Should mother not be able to go, I&#39;ll be glad to go in hir place.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elise looked over. &quot;I got a better idea. Every mission we change teams. This time, Brent, myself, Luna, Lia, Ryles, and Casey will go on this trip.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally smiled. &quot;That&#39;s another thing. Casey won&#39;t either. Our mother is her sister and will not, I repeat will not leave for a mission, so Sammy will go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brent spoke up. &quot;I also have another thing. I have decided, of all my children, I shall keep no more than two at a time.&quot; Shi said.<br />
<br />
This caused a massive silence in the group. Charlie smiled. &quot;Well, Brent, you will be an excelent mother. And I shall get the paperwork together. However don&#39;t get to ready to give them up, just yet. Wait until they mature enough to decide.&quot; He looked.<br />
<br />
Brent nodded. &quot;I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what made you decide, Brent?&quot; Jess asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, mom don&#39;t believe in abortion, so neither do I. Rape child or not. They will still be my children.&quot; Brent smiled. &quot;But I am standing firm. I am only keeping two. I will decide which two when the time comes.&quot;<br />
<br />
The lot smiled and Elise moved closer to Brent. &quot;I think I found a good man.&quot; Shi teased.<br />
<br />
This brought on a big laugh from everyone as Brent turned to a darkish red. &quot;Shucks... how do I get so lucky.&quot;<br />
<br />
Even Raul, the hard ass laughed at this. &quot;Well then, does this conclude our meeting? If so, then me, Maria, Mikkie, Danna, Elise, and Brent have to prepare for our trip to New York City. I have to speak personnaly with the UN and Mikkie and Danna have a show.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, we can conclude our meeting.&quot; Sally said.</p>
