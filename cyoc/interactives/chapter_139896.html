<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a dark and stormy september night. The wind was howling and the rain was pouring. The 37 year old Chicago resident Nick Crup spent it at his home office like he allways did. He was overworked and very tired, but still determined to get through the remanig paperwork.<br />
<br />
Nick worked long and hard every day of the week. Bothe from home and at the office bulding. He had worked white the same company for years.<br />
<br />
Nick sighed, reflecting on the past. He had been whit that company for almost 13 years. But not anymore. He hadd resign less then a week ago. Only two days ago innfact. He had resign after a falling-out whit a colleague named Becky. The company hadd taken her side and the hole ordeal had been nerve wracking and absolutly  exhausting for Nick. He aboutlty were a workaholic. But even he could not stay under thise circumstances. So he quit. He would later come to regret not holding out just two more days.<br />
<br />
Nick were allready looking for a new job tho. He was still young enuff, well, he was not too old. And he had plenty of work experience so this should not be any trubel. Or so he thought.<br />
<br />
He looked at the clock on the wall. it was over midnight. That ment that it was now september 12th.<br />
<br />
September 12th the same date he had met his wife Laura all those years ago. They both study abroad in France at the time. He was only 19 years old then but would be 20 the next week, she had just turned 23 the week before. They met by coincidence, becuse some creepy old geezer had bought her a drink, she took it but not his advances. So Laura asket Nick if she could sitt with him. They started talking and pretty mutch hit it off from there.<br />
<br />
They were still together to diss day and had two boys together. 9 year old Danny and 12 year old Lucas.<br />
<br />
<br />
He had been an somewhat absent father. It wasnt that he was not involved in there lifes at all. But he did tend to priorities work over his family. And he did love them, but it was telling that he was not driven to find a new job becuse of a want to provide for his family, but just a compulsive need of his for a  purpose with inn a corporate environment.<br />
<br />
He sighed. He the went to the bathroom, to get ready for bed.<br />
<br />
He was greeted by his reflection from the bathroom mirror. Nick was an pale scrawny blond man whit a receding hairline, a five o&#39;clock shadow and green eyes.<br />
<br />
He get ready, and soon joined his allredy sleeping wife in bed. She was a brunette with a pixi haircut. She had C cup boobs. She was pretty chubby, but in no way obese. She was waring a green nightgown. Her glasses laying on nightstands.<br />
<br />
Littel did Nick nor Laura know what were about to happen.The GenderWave was swiping over the globe. Changeing everyone&#39;s gender everywere. Changing there bodys,  there lifes, there past. And as it swept over Chicago, it changed Laura and Nick Crup into Robert and Mandy Samper. And there littel boys Lucas and Danny into there littel girls Lilly and Daisy.<br />
<br />
But it was more than that. As you know Nick was unemployed at the moment. If he had still been employed when the genderwave hit he would have keept his posison as Mandy. That was the case for the absolute majority of pepole, and Nick would have been no exception. But sinc Nick was not employed, Mandy was not employed, and she hadd not been employed for over a decade. <br />
<br />
The thing is, even though most people keep there current occupation there CV very often got changed by the genderwave. And this was the case here too. You see, when Nick become Mandy he did also change from the boys dad to girls mom. And she would therfor have been pregnant with the oldes of them, at the time Nick got the job, but it made less sens for a company to hire someone that would almost immediately have maternity leave. So Mandy did not get the job, or she would not have gotten the job if she ever had apply for the job. <br />
<br />
This is becuse Mandy never got a career, that meant the Samper&#39;s would be an single income family unlike the Crup&#39;s that hadd been a dual income household. But they still had the same home, for the  Samper&#39;s to afford this, the genderwave had swept away some expenses. Most notably Nick&#39;s student debt along with his higher education. And this was why Mandy never got a career. But also becuse Mandy had been dating a older guy that allredy had a job, that could suport her when she got pregnant. Insted of Nick dating a older woman that had  to go on maternity leave.<br />
<br />
All of this ment one thing: Mandy hadd for the past 12 years been a stay at home mom. She was a homemaker that was completely financially dependent on her spouse.<br />
<br />
But all of this was yet unbeknown for the former Crup family.<br />
<br />
the alarm clock went of. And the new Mr. and Ms. Samper wake from there slumber.<br />
<br />
They deffently got startled by there own change and the &quot;stranger&quot; in there bed. But at the same time was it like they just had a grasp of the situation.<br />
<br />
They looked at themself and each other.<br />
<br />
Laura now Robert was now a very tall man with wide shoulders, a huge beer belly, strong arms and a hairy chest. He had a stern look on his face, a fully grown dark brown beard with some strands of grey in it, a strong jawline and a bald head. He wor blue boxsers and a grey wifebeater. Laura&#39;s glasses was just gone. Robert&#39;s eyesight was bether then what Laura&#39;s had been, so he did not need them.<br />
<br />
Nick now Mandy were now a quit slim woman with B cup boobs, but she hadd a great bubble butt and sexy legs. She had light brown hair in a shoulder-length bob. She now had dimples on her cheeks and a few stress lines was showing on her pretty face. She had big blue eyes. She wore a purple silk pyjamas.<br />
<br />
With just a quick glance of the bedroom one could see that there were someone else that had  furnish the room. Someone with a diffrent style.<br />
<br />
Mandy looked at Robert, and asked: <br />
&quot;what do we do now?&quot;</p>
