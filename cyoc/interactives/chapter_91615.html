<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You&#39;re welcome, Harkaal,&quot; Lartara said with a knowing smile as she looked to me. &quot;It warms my heart to hear that you are pleased with your new form.&quot;<br />
<br />
Something in her tone of voice indicated that I wasn&#39;t the first newly transformed Lycothan who wanted to see what he or she looked like after they changed. Though, there was a slight teasing edge to it as well, which I understood. She and all of my new sisters had commented that I was beautiful after my transformation, and I had to admit that I had found Lartara beautiful in her wolf form and had the same feelings as I watched Eira and the others shift forms in front of me. I expected I&#39;d take a bit of teasing for a while over that, but to a degree, I felt willing to take it. I did feel strong, confident, and beautiful as a Lycothan, but that didn&#39;t mean I didn&#39;t want to see what I looked like. If the others wanted to make jokes, I figured I could take it and come back with something.<br />
<br />
Though I did make my way out of the creek, and shook my feet off as I stepped out. The water had completely soaked my fur on my feet, and they did feel a bit cold, particularly as they left the cold water and were exposed again to the air. Though, seeing what I looked like outweighed the negative affects of standing in cold water. I was pleased with my new form. Privately and personally, I still wanted to do what I could for the other prisoners... give them as much of a choice as possible with regard to when they changed or if they changed and make sure that Alpha didn&#39;t bully them, but I had found myself pleased with my new form.<br />
<br />
&quot;And so... now that our beauty queen is sure of herself, what shall we do now?&quot; Eira asked with a teasing smile toward me, &quot;Explore the woods a bit more? Or maybe Harkaal wants to inquire about males...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you seen a male warrior?&quot; I asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Eira admitted, &quot;but Verozza says there is a male wing in the facility.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is, though its smaller than the female wing where we work,&quot; Lartara spoke, &quot;Fewer male prisoners means fewer male guards are needed. And the Alphas aren&#39;t likely going to give us a shot a courting a male until after the facility is no longer needed.&quot;<br />
<br />
That made me think back to just before my transformation and the conversation I&#39;d had with Lartara. She&#39;d commented that because they Lycothan population was mostly female that it was likely their concept of family would likely be a lone male taking several females in sorts of &quot;sub-packs.&quot; Part of me also figured it could be possible that a Lycothan female might only go looking for a male when they were ready to have children of their own,  but I also remembered the size of the male Servant Lycothan&#39;s sheath at my last recruitment session. The memory of that began to make me feel rather warm and I figured that there was also the potential that Lycothans liked sex just as much as humans did, and for females with the added interest in both genders.<br />
<br />
I was about to say something in response to Eira&#39;s comment when I heard a howl rise from elsewhere in the forest. I turned my right ear toward it, and soon recognized that the others had finally caught dinner. The dinner I&#39;d wagged my tail at the prospect of eating. Eira and Lartara turned an ear toward the howl as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dinner&#39;s ready,&quot; I spoke, remembering the instructions Lartara had given Raksha before the others left to hunt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Lartara nodded, &quot;and they aren&#39;t too far away. We can get though quickly...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Harkaal already gave us a warm up,&quot; Eira laughed, taking a jibe at the rush I&#39;d taken to get to the creek I&#39;d looked into.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just be glad I&#39;m making sure your muscle stays perfect,&quot; I replied and began to jog toward where the howl had come from, &quot;Just the way I like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eira didn&#39;t answer, but I did hear Lartara chuckled. We jogged along briefly and soon began to pick up the pace. In no time at all, the three of us were again in a full sprint, dodging trees, rocks, bushes, and anything that might have tripped us up with ease. It felt good. I could feel the &quot;wind&quot; in my pelt and it felt good. It made me feel free. My human memories found it a little strange, but even my human mind felt free in being able to run and feel the wind in my fur. It was odd, but I loved it. And in no time, we arrived at the scene where the others had caught dinner. They stood in a sort of half circle around three dead White Tail Deer, each with a noticeable bite mark at their throats. Each of the other warriors had a smile as we approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;You all arrived sooner than we expected,&quot; Nyl commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Harkaal had to see for herself how beautiful she was,&quot; Eira teased, &quot;Took us on a run to a creek...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Says the wolf who loves my hair,&quot; I teased back.<br />
<br />
There were a few chuckles among the the others, but no one said anything for the moment. I meanwhile focused my eyes to the deer. They lay still, just waiting to be eaten. I could smell their scent as it stood in contrast to the musky scent of myself and my sisters. Part of me expected them to be cooked, but the more I looked at the dead deer and remembered my own hunger, I felt my mouth begin to water and my tail begin to wag. Lartara, Eira, and I came closer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good job, girls,&quot; Lartara complemented them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; they answered.<br />
<br />
Lartara, Eira, and I soon joined them and I noticed that together, we&#39;d completed a circle around the three deer. All of them looked hungry as well, and I noticed several tails wagging in anticipation of eating. I soon recognized that we were about to eat it raw, and while my human mind did want to protest, I couldn&#39;t stop my tail from wagging and I was salivating at the prospect of feeding on the deer.  As such I crouched down on all fours beside my sisters and licked my muzzle at the prospect at taking a bite.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks good, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; Lesroia asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; I nodded, &quot;Good enough to eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
I then leaned in and bit into the rear leg of one of the deer. It&#39;s fur tickled my tongue a little, but meat beneath it was savory and quite good.</p>
