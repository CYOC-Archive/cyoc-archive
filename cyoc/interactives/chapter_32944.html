<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>The three policemen surrounded Brandon so that he felt safe around his beastly step-father, while they walked into the large living-room area. Rick sat down on the black leather sofa while moving his tail so that he didn‘t sit on it, causing himself unnecessary pain. Brandon and the three rugged cops sat on the regular, but large and comfy couch across from his step-father with a glass coffee table directly between them, keeping everyone separated. As they all made themselves comfortable, Rick sighed, but even that came out like a low and menacing growl. Brandon picked up on the unintentional growl and was ready to bolt for the door, but the cops held out their thick arms against his chest, preventing Brandon from going anywhere.</br>
<br>“Sorry about that Brandon, I meant nothing by it really. It has just been such a long time since I took my full werewolf form…”</br>
<br>“What do you mean it‘s been a long time? Are you telling me you have always been a werewolf?”</br>
<br>“Well… yes in a manner of speaking. Obviously I haven‘t changed since you‘ve known me, which has been your whole life.”</br>
<br>“Right… so why now?”</br>
<br>“Well you see, the werewolf gene has always run in our family, affecting only the men and never the women. Ever since I was a young boy, I helped my father create potions or elixirs to keep this side of us at bay. I was working on the potion in the basement when your music made me lose my concentration and I spilled the chemicals. One key ingredient forces us to change but the others suppress it, so we just end up having full grown beards almost right after ingestion. Since I spilled them, the chemicals weren‘t mixed and the vapor it gave off forced me to change.”</br>
<br>“Ok… well you said our family. Rick, you do remember that you married my mom after I was born, so I can‘t be part of your lineage.”</br>
<br>“Under normal circumstances, you are absolutely right, but these are not normal circumstances. You see, this side of us is a natural part of our lives and so is our human side, however there is one thing that is seen as abnormal to most. Our kind is actually genetically homosexual, meaning we men like other men. This is why and how we are able to keep our kind down and why only men are affected by it. Many of us wanted normal lives with a wife and children, but as long as we allowed this side of ourselves free that was never going to happen. Many, many years ago a werewolf scientist concocted a potion that would shut off the werewolf gene as well as the homosexual nature tied into it, so we would be able to procreate and live normal lives. If we ever had boys, we as the fathers would teach our sons the potion. At first we make it into a game so that we would have the potion to drink and you all would remember how to make it. Then around the first full moon after your eighteenth birthday, we would tell you the truth.”</br>
<br>“Ok… I understand that and all, but why are you telling me? I know I just turned eighteen and tonight is the first night of the full moon, but I am not your biological son.”</br>
<br>“Oh but you are. Your mother and I hit it off, had sex before marriage and that very same night she witnessed my transformation much like you did. When I tried to explain, she didn‘t want to have anything to do with me and she left. A year later we happened to bump into one another in public while she pushed you around in the stroller. She told me about the pregnancy and everything and we decided to consummate a relationship and even fake our whole marriage, just for you. As you know, your mother left a couple months ago because she knew what was going to happen to you and she didn‘t want to be part of it, especially since you were grown up now. She wanted you to think I was your step-father so things could be normal with us as a family.”</br>
<br>“Alright, so tonight I am going to change into a werewolf like you? Just out of curiosity… why did we move here?”</br>
<br>“The first answer is yes, but more so. On the nights of the full moon your transformation is much stronger than what you saw with me. Everything is bigger, thicker and fuller… and I do mean everything! Second, I will go through the same thing, just everything being bigger and better than it is now since I‘m already in werewolf form Third, we can change at will and we would look how you see me now. If we ingest the chemical that forces our change, we turn out how we ill tonight when the moon is up and out. Fourth and foremost, we moved here because the entire community is comprised of thropes. Like you and me, there are other werewolves or lycanthropes around here, but there are ursanthropes or werebears here like these three fine officers. These guys get the full boat whenever they change because they are not tied to the lunar cycle like we are, but we can still take a dose ad have our full helping of the change.”</br>
<br>Brandon looked at the three men who surrounded him, at first it was just a harmless glance, but he looked at each a second time with a lustful intent building in him. The three smiled back at him, wanting what they saw in his lustful gaze since bears rarely took the drug to keep them from being homosexual and from transforming. Rick caught his son‘s deviousness and smiled.</br>
<br>“You know dad, moments ago I would have been disgusted by looking at another man or multiple men like I just did, but now it seems right. Hell now what I would have done to a woman makes me sick to my stomach.”</br>
<br>“Yeah, well I could see that. That is how we are and it is normal, hell it‘s one good of a time, especially since we know what makes our cocks feel awesome and gets us off, we can give that same thing to other guys.”</br>
<br>Even though Brandon was listening to his father intently, his mind wandered and so did his eyes, which led to his hands. The biggest cop who was sitting to his left sat by himself and out of instinct, Brandon started to slowly stroke the big man‘s chest outside of his shirt.  Brandon wanted to do more, but he was hesitant to do anything in front of his dad and Rick caught up on that immediately.</br>
<br>“Brandon, you go ahead and do whatever you want. First of all I am not going to shun you for it, hell I would have been over him too had we not been in other circumstances or talking. Secondly, we have orgies with one another all the time. If you are having doubts because you don‘t want to contract an STD, you don‘t have to worry about that either because our immune systems wont allow it to gain any ground. So we can‘t contract anything from humans nor can we get anything from other weres around because none of us can get anything.”</br>
<br>“So if I want to take a thick load of cum down my throat, I can and not worry about anything?”</br>
<br>“Yep, exactly and by the way… we produce ten times the amount of cum when our werewolf genes are active, five times the amount when they aren‘t. Bearmen on the other hand produce twenty times, so if you are hungry, you are definitely getting a feeding from the right bear. Hell, I have had his cock in my mouth a couple times and each time I am fully filled, especially since he shoots like a gallon of cum with each climax and he has climaxed in my maw as many as six times before. The more cum you swallow, the healthier of a werewolf you will be because of the high amounts of protein in cum. If anything was a drawback to being a werewolf or werebear it would be the protein intake. Although, the way we get it is most enjoyable, so it really is just a wash.”</br>
<br>Brandon smiled, showing off his already sharpening k-9‘s and unbuttoned one of the buttons of the cop‘s shirt. He smiled and tilted his head back enjoying the little rub he was getting. Brandon enjoyed the feeling of the medium length and thickness of his chest hair, while slowly exploring the mountains of muscle of the bear‘s chest. Slowly he moved around, feeling the hard and solid spare tire that was his belly, even though he could still feel the ridges of the abdominal muscles. Brandon continued to feel around and got to his nipple. Brandon toyed with it, making erect and then played with the tip, watching the bear stir and increase in horniness. As Brandon still checked him out with his eyes, he smiled as he saw the bulge in the cop‘s pants pulse, growing larger, thicker, wider and pushing harder against the fabric. Brandon just decided at a whim to unzip the cop‘s fly and let the monster trapped inside free. As he unzipped and opened the cop‘s fly, Brandon could see the thick fleshy rod of meat was still stuck and when he pulled it out, Brandon‘s eyes went wide. The cock was only six inches long and cut, but with a width of a beer can and a mushroom head that was just as thick and covered in a thick coating of precum. Brandon gave the cock head a slow stroke, getting his entire hand covered in the stringy, thick and clear liquid. Curious to it’s taste, Brandon licked the tip of his index finger to try it out and immediately found the sweet fluid to be very good. Brandon licked his whole hand clean and then… </br></p>
