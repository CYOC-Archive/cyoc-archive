<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The new preview and time-travel (both backward and forward) feature that Jeff created in his new version of the Chronivac opened up before him and Kyle.  He knew Kyle was convinced that he was right, that he would always love Jeff and never leave him.  But that was the nature of love - it couldn&#39;t see past the moment, couldn&#39;t see reality and all of its imperfections, only what it wanted and imagining that is what would be fulfilling forever.  It was childish, unrealistic, and as Jeff was about to show Kyle, a lie.<br />
<br />
There was real love in the world, it was true; the kind of love that endured hardships and did the hard work of working things out when things got tough, despite how difficult it was.  The kind of love that stuck with it even when things seemed grim and there seemed to be no reward for all the efforts... that kept at it even when it seemed to be unappreciated.  That was love.  But lust - love&#39;s cheap immitation - ruled supreme.<br />
<br />
Kyle saw the future unfolding before him.  A future where Jeff said yes to him, and became Jeffery.  Kyle made it perminant, there was no going back for Jeffery now - he was Kyle&#39;s perfect &quot;girl&quot;.  Kyle was happy, had everything that he wanted.  As the months went on, and turned into a year, Kyle saw his eye start  to wander.  He noticed other guys.  The things he loved so much about Jeffery started to irritate him.  Jeffery&#39;s feminine way, his flamboyance, the lisp and limp wrists.  Kyle started diving into longer hours at school, in practice, and at work, trying to avoid Jeffery.  Finally the day came wehn Kyle met Mike.  Mike was everything that Jeffery wasn&#39;t... and he was perfect for Kyle.  Mike was really the kind of guy that Kyle wanted.  So it wasn&#39;t a surprise when one night after a fight with Jeffery, Kyle found himself in Mike&#39;s bed.  And it wasn&#39;t a surprise when not long after that, Kyle dumped Jeffery, leaving the guy he had transformed into a flaming gay twink... stuck that way, because he wasn&#39;t &quot;in love&quot; with Jeffery any more.  In his mind it was Jeffery&#39;s fault, for being so feminine (even though it was Kyle that had made him that way), for being such a weakling (which was also Kyle&#39;s doing with the Chronivac).<br />
<br />
When the future preview stopped, Kyle sat with his mouth open, in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;So that&#39;s what would happen if I said yes to you,&quot; Jeff said evenly.  &quot;You&#39;d turn me into a flaming gay stereotype, then grow tired of it and leave me that way, alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... I...&quot; Kyle stammered.  He didn&#39;t know what to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want something easy, something fun.&quot;  Jeff shook his head.  &quot;You would have made me into your current fantasy, grown to hate it, then left me stuck like that, man.  Do you GET that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle still didn&#39;t know what to say, then said weakly, &quot;But I love you.  I would never leave you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yet you do.  That was a preview of the future, based on what you wanted to do here tonight.  That is how it would ultimately unfold.  It&#39;s not a guess, it&#39;s that actual future.&quot;  Jeff sighed.  &quot;And you saw the truth... in that reality you DO leave me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it hasn&#39;t happened yet, you haven&#39;t even given me a chance,&quot; Kyle protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;I ran several other scenarios, variations on the theme.  You know what they had in common?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle shook his head negative.<br />
<br />
&quot;You find a new guy you go gaga for, and leave me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeffery, I -&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NOT &#39;Jeffery&#39;,&quot; Jeff stopped him, putting his hand up.  &quot;JEFF.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Kyle conceded.  &quot;Jeff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I ran even more scenarios after that,&quot; Jeff revealed.  &quot;In every one of them, you do what you like, you never once try to brave through the challenges.  You want it easy, you bail when things get tough, find a new infatuation.  Do you know what I discovered you are, Kyle?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle tried to say something but was promptly interruted again.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a pig.  A big fat sex pig.  Like an animal, you just do whatever you feel like, and tell yourself you did the best you could and that other people changed.  But in reality you just grew bored with them.  So now, I&#39;m going to do the world a favor and make you look like the sex pig you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff hit the Chronivac emitter button, and Kyle squealed.  His body started expanding rapidly like a balloon.  Abdominals turned into a gut, love handles rolled out his sides, Pecs turned into moobs.  His bushy blonde hair started falling out, and his clothes started ripping as his fat expanded too much for them to contain him any longer.  In moments, Kyle&#39;s weight increased - 400, 500, 600 pounds.  His face rounded out, his nose turned itself up into a snout.  His tanned skin faded and got all pink.  His rounding shoulders and back sprouted course dark hairs, as the last of the hair on his head fell away; he felt his bald head as hair fell past his eyes, squealing anew.  His arms brushed his eyebrows as he felt his hairless scalp, and they brushed away like autumn leaves, leaving him more piggish looking.  Kyle saw his hands changing, fingers fusing into a three-fingered cloven-hoof hand, points darkening.  His ears grew into pointed triangles that flopped over on themselves by their own weight.  Sets of new nubs appeared down Kyle&#39;s belly, even as he felt his cock and balls drawn into his body with a pop and grew a new dripping sow pussy.  A second popping sound, and he now had a curly tail above his very wide ass.  Then he simply stood there in all his fat glory, a 950 pound sowboi, shocked and speaking in a very girly lisping gay voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
I made you what you really are, Kyle... Princess.  You&#39;re an anthropomorphic sow, and you give off a hormone that will draw other sex pigs to you, so you can have all the piglets you can nurse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Princess stood, embarrassed at being naked and so fat, grunting and oinking, then waddled over to Jeff, begging to suck his cock with his lisping girly voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Princess.  I&#39;m not gay.&quot;  Keying the Chronivac, a big gold ring appeared in Kyle&#39;s snout.  &quot;But I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have no problem finding some sex pig to impregnate you.&quot;  Jeff pressed some buttons on the Chronivac, and &quot;Princess&quot; found herself in a busy school hallway.  She waddled past several schoolmates she recognized, friends from the football team, and others.  She somehow knew that everyone knew who she was - that she was Kyle, and she blushed with embarrasment as one of his best friends from football, Jim, stood behind him reading Princess&#39; new tramp-stamp, &quot;Please fuck me, I love big dicks.&quot;  Jim started laughing out loud, and grabbed the sow by the fat hairy shoulder.  &quot;C&#39;mon, Princess Kyle, lets get you laid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle blushed beet-red, and then let out an involuntary squeal as she orgasmed right there in front of everyone in the busy hallway, just from Jim touching her shoulder, juices flowing from her pussy.</p>
