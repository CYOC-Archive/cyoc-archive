<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You are awaken by your dad snoring next to you, you look around and notice you are in your room, everything looked in place and peaceful, except that your TV and Xbox are gone.  Probably you brother took them. That makes you angry and start feeling your heart beat racing. Then your dad wakes up.<br />
<br />
“Oh you are awake, I though you would be sick but your mother said it would be normal for you to be tired”<br />
<br />
“How long have I been sleeping?” <br />
<br />
“Well if your clock is right, over 12 hours”<br />
<br />
“What?  That long? <br />
<br />
“Yeah but don’t worry, about it, you have been sleeping for the past week.”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?<br />
<br />
“Oh right, I forgot to tell you, after the transplant you remained unconscious for almost a week until you woke up yesterday.<br />
<br />
“So that means...<br />
<br />
“Yes I’ve been carrying you for all this time.”<br />
<br />
“Oh no, what day is it?” your dad wonders what’s wrong but you keep asking for the date and he tells you its Friday.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, your friend Colby will be here today after school, to bring your homework”<br />
<br />
“Dad! Its 7am and you are already talking about homework? ”<br />
<br />
“Well I just needed to remind you, now let’s gets started.<br />
<br />
Your dad sits ln the side of your bed and stretches his arms making your heads squish together and you get to smell his armpit. Again you pretended that it didn’t bother you as your dad started walking to the bathroom. He was wearing his pj pants and a tank top that fit perfectly for your two heads.<br />
<br />
Once in the bathroom, he starts pulling down his pants and underwear, exposing his cock.<br />
<br />
“Dad, what are you doing?”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry son but I need to pee”<br />
“But I’m here”<br />
<br />
“Then look the other way”<br />
<br />
With no other option you look to the ceiling while listening to your dad’s stream hit the water, when he is finished he lets a small gasp out and starts wiggling his dick before pulling up his clothes. For some reason you can’t ignore the relief you felt after your dad finished.<br />
<br />
He starts washing up his hands and then looks into the mirror, letting you see the same thing he does.  He stares and touches his face, and for the first time you noticed your dad had a few pimples around his cheeks which was odd.<br />
<br />
He sees you looking at him and says<br />
<br />
“Yeah I’ve been having this trouble for the last couple of days, and look at you, it looks like you are finally growing a beard.”<br />
<br />
Then you look at your own face and see a couple of small hairs growing on your chin and cheeks. You try to get closer to the mirror, happy of seeing your first facial hairs. <br />
<br />
“Hold you’re your horses narcissus, we need to shave them “<br />
<br />
“Why?”<br />
<br />
“To look presentable and it will make them grow faster.”<br />
<br />
As you didn’t have other choice but to let your father do the work, he smears shaving cream all over your face and starts shaving you, cutting your face a couple times  because he wasn’t used to shave someone else but him.<br />
<br />
When you are done, your dad walks you to his room and you see that your mom is already gone.<br />
He starts undressing leaving only his underwear you feel a bit embarrassed looking at your dad’s hairy body, then he starts dressing up. He grabbed a pair of jeans that were a bit too tight for him.<br />
<br />
“What? But they fit perfectly the other day, I must be getting some weight, he grabbed his belly. “Then he picked an outfit similar to the previous day and headed downstairs to prepare breakfast, your mom had left a note on the fridge saying she was Going to be late from work, and that Kenneth would be Sleeping at a friend’s house, she also reminded you of the blue serum she left in the fridge.<br />
<br />
 Your dad prepared a huge amount of food just for you two, No wonder why he was getting weight, he was eating Way too much, something you usually do but never thought it was wrong since your 16 yo. body was smaller than his .<br />
<br />
After breakfast your father turned on the news and he started doing some house chores with you; sharing a few comments but most of the time remained silence since none of you knew what to say.<br />
After Cleaning, you start feeling hungry again and your dad seems to feel the same way because he asks you<br />
<br />
“What do you want to eat Max?”<br />
<br />
 “I don’t know, anything’s good”<br />
<br />
“Let’s see…” started your dad while grabbing his phone.<br />
<br />
20 minutes later the food arrived, and your dad managed to make the delivery guy to leave the food on the front door, since the pay was made via credit card. You and your dad start eating the burgers and soda your dad ordered while sitting on the couch, then you had a strange sensation while your dad took his hand to your shared chest, finally you burped tasting the meat and cheese from the burgers. <br />
<br />
“Sorry son, I didn’t expect that to happen” <br />
<br />
“Dad” you said, then you swallow trying to push as much air into your stomach until your dad finally let go a small belch.<br />
<br />
“Not bad Max, but we shouldn’t keep doing this.”<br />
<br />
For a while, you and your dad remained on the sofa watching Tv, even though you were watching one of your favourite series on Netflix, you felt annoyed that there was nothing else you could do, just stare at what was in front of you, not being able to move, feeling your shoulder itch but not being able to move.  Your dad kept changing his position, probably because he though you didn’t have a good view of the TV, until he decided to simple curved his back and crossed his legs over the small table; Just like yesterday when you ate the sandwiches; Giving you a perfect look at his feet, they were not really beautiful but there was something that attracted you to them, they were bigger than your own feet for sure, probably size 10, maybe 11?  But you weren’t going to simply ask your dad about his shoe size did you?<br />
His toe nails were a bit long, and his second toe was longer than the rest, they definitely didn’t look soft, and probably his soles were hard from his work. You know that your dad was a surgeon and must surgeries take place while standing, you were once at the hospital with him and saw how the surgery took place from the outside. Then again your attention went to the Hairs growing at the instep of his foot made you curious if you will ever grow that much hair. Your kept moving from your dads hairy legs up to his bulge when you noticed his dick forming a tent under his shorts. You felt ashamed once more and looked away, at this point you had the opportunity to look at your dad’s dick twice but never did because you though it was part of his privacy and didn’t want to invade it.<br />
<br />
When you look back at the TV, you hear the doorbell ring and your father starts moving again.<br />
<br />
“What time is it? It’s already 4 o’clock! It must be your friend Colby bringing up your homework”<br />
<br />
Your dad walked to the front door and you nervously asked him if he was going to really open the door and let Colby see you like this.<br />
<br />
 “Oh come on Max don’t be silly I have it figure out, beside it wouldn’t be that bad if Colby saw you this close to your old man, you have been friends since kinder garden”<br />
<br />
“That’s not the point dad, he would totally freak out if he ever see someone with two heads no matter who.”<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah you are right, this might cause panic into any normal person, don’t worry” <br />
<br />
You were about to add something else but then your dad opened the door just enough to cover your head. You were nervous of Colby seeing you like a severed head reattached to your dad, you could feel your heart beat racing and suddenly those couple of minutes seemed like an eternity, you could feel your face small droplets of sweat form around your forehead, even running down your neck to your chest, you could even feel your armpits Moistening your dads shirt.<br />
When your dad finally closed the door he was holding a couple of notebooks in his right hand, you released your breath and thanking your dad in your mind for taking care of the situation so smoothly.<br />
<br />
“Uff, for a second I thought he would come in, I’m even sweating” said your dad cleaning his forehead and moving his shirt. You could feel a nice breeze refreshing you.<br />
<br />
Afterwards your dad went into his study and told you to do your homework, for The next couple of hours you were sitting in your dads desk debating with him on how to solve Your math equations, you kept telling your dad that you needed him to write the procedures because it was hard to do everything in your mind.   Apart from that you could feel mosquitos bit your legs making it more difficult to concentrate but fortunately your dad would scratch his legs with his feet from time to time. It took you more a lot of time but in the end you managed to finish your homework on time, then your dad went to the kitchen to grab some food for dinner but you felt asleep before having a bite.</p>
