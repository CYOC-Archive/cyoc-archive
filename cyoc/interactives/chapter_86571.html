<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was a flash. The young man blinked his eyes and looked around. He was in some kind of jungle clearing. It was very hot and humid. “Where am I?” the boy tried to ask, but all that came out were incredibly deep and guttural grunts and moans. Confused, the boy looked down and saw a shocking sight; he truly was a Neanderthal! His skin was incredibly leathery and thick, with thick brown hair sprouting all over it. He glanced at his hairy and oversized arms and hands. Very thick and wiry hair clung to them and they hung nearly to his knees. His legs, on the other hand, were much shorter than they were supposed to be. They too, were covered in an incredibly thick and dirty pelt of hair and ended in feet that were far too large for his body. His pubic hair had become a wiry jungle; it looked almost like a loin cloth the hair was so thick. The new caveman was disgusted by it; he could feel things crawling inside of his huge pubic bush. From the large bush, the hair thickly crawled its way up his stomach and all over his newly muscular chest. It was so thick in parts that the skin was barely visible beneath it. It was matted and tangled with dirt and sweat. The next thing the boy noticed was how greatly increased the size of his manhood was. It now hung down nearly to his knees and was about as thick as a soda can. The skin on his penis felt much thicker and leathery than before, almost like a sleeve, and it was crisscrossed with new, thick veins. A good portion of his manhood was hidden in his new pubic jungle. Reaching into his bush and groping around, he found his new balls; they were each about the size of a tennis ball and completely encased in hair. The boy spotted a puddle over to his left, and he walked over to it. Glancing in the puddle, he saw what devolving thousands of years had done to his handsome face. A thick and simian brow protruded above his eye sockets, framed with a thick and wiry unibrow. His lower jaw also protruded from his face. His face was also covered with a smattering of thick, dirty stubble. He looked nearly simian! He grunted in shock and staggered backwards, his new hose of a cock and his balls flopping and slapping against his knees. Using his overly long arms, he reached behind his back to see if the dirty wiry hair continued their as well. Running his hands along his now hunched back, he found that the hair grew there as well. His entire back was covered in wiry, thick, and matted brown hairs. There was no escape from the hair; his entire body was completely coated in it. With his arms raised to feel over his back, the boy noticed something; his new body stunk horribly. He looked to his right and into an incredibly thick, tangled bush of armpit hair under his right arm. It was the hairiest armpit he had ever seen. He leaned in to get a whiff and he was greeted with incredibly pungent and smelly body odor. He glanced over at his left armpit; the same thick bush of hair had sprouted from that one as well, giving of a strong, sweaty, musky odor. Having been completely smooth before and someone who showered regularly, the boy found all of this hair and his new stench rather disgusting. He was ashamed and embarrassed of his new body. He would have to get used to the new smells his body and armpits produced, he thought with defeat, because he would never ever use soap or deodorant again. This isn’t what he wanted! He was completely trapped in this ancient jungle forever in this gross, disgusting, smelly, hairy body. This line of thinking caused his newly thick manhood to twinge. It slowly began to rise out of the mound of pubic hair, becoming over a foot long hard. The boy was mortified; thinking about being forever trapped in his new dirty body, covered in thick matted body hair that produced incredibly pungent body odor was turning him on! Absolutely disgusted and embarrassed with himself, the boy couldn’t help but to begin stroke his new leathery appendage. He closed his eyes and began to deeply grunt. Just as this happened, he heard a noise behind him. The new caveman wheeled around in surprise and saw…</p>
