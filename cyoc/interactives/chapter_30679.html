<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike didn't give us an opportunity to explain.  He immediately lunged at the three of us with a look of rage in his eyes.  Fortunately for us, he didn't know his new body yet, and so he lost his balance and fell right on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ouch,&quot; Kim stated sarcastically.<br />
<br />
I didn't want any repeat attempts and so I said, &quot;I wish that you are all unable to attempt to cause us any type of harm in any way, shape, or form.&quot;  I figured that would take care of anything conceivable.<br />
<br />
Mike stood back up.  The look was still plastered over his otherwise beautiful face.  It appeared that he still wanted to get at us, but his feet wouldn't allow him to move any closer.  &quot;What the fuck have you done to us?&quot; he repeated his demand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Follow us and we'll tell you,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
We walked back to the living room and told them to sit on a couch.  We sat down on a couch across from them.  &quot;We'll make this short and sweet,&quot; Rachel said.  &quot;The three of us have all been given a gift which grants us any wish we desire,&quot; she explained.<br />
<br />
Mike looked angrier still.  &quot;Like a fucking genie in a lamp?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Kim said.  &quot;You don't need to know what makes our wishes, just that we can do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve said, &quot;Then prove it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel sighed and said, &quot;I wish that a fireball would appear in my hand as if I was a comic book character that could manipulate fire and not be hurt by it.&quot;  She opened the palm of her right hand and the fireball appeared, dancing and twirling around in her hand while she stared at the three of them.  &quot;I wish the fireball would disappear,&quot; she added.  It did so right away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; Steve said, &quot;Then why don't you...&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel didn't let him finish his thought.  She jolted up out of her seat and said, &quot;Oh, shut up!  We don't need to prove anything else.  Is the fact that you're missing your muscles and cocks and have tits and pussies not enough proof for you?&quot; she demanded.<br />
<br />
Steve shrunk back into his seat.  He seemed afraid to speak again.  Rachel sat back down.  Michael continued his line of questioning.  &quot;Why did you bitches do this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know,&quot; Kim said, &quot;I'm not liking the tone, Mike, so I wish you wouldn't speak until I said you could again.&quot;  Mike tried to open his mouth again, presumably to call Kim another name, but he simply could not.  &quot;As for the 'why,' that's simple.  The three of you are collectively the most macho, chauvinistic assholes in the entire school.  You use girls endlessly, and if a girl dares reject you, you simply drag her name through the dirt and imply she is a slut and a whore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we would know,&quot; I continued.  &quot;You've done it to all three of us, because we've been smart enough to tell you to fuck off.&quot;  This was true, for I did have memories of them giving me the same treatment they had to Rachel and Kim.  This whole thing with two sets of memories was getting a little confusing.<br />
<br />
Rachel continued the explanation.  &quot;So we've decided to make you three feel what it's like to be a woman.  What we've done so far is to just make physical changes to you.  We can do more, much more in fact, that can be far worse.  So the three of you have a choice to make.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is that choice?&quot; asked Brad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Simple,&quot; Rachel replied.  &quot;Do what we tell you to do, willingly, and we might consider changing you back to normal.  Provided, of course, you demonstrate to us that you've learned your lessons.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve sat back up with a look of cold hatred on his face.  &quot;One problem with your little plan, though,&quot; he said.  &quot;Our parents and friends are going to wonder where we are, now aren't they?&quot;  A look of smug satisfaction spread over his face.  He lightly elbowed Brad in the ribs, as if to get Brad to agree with him.<br />
<br />
Brad just sighed.  &quot;No, you idiot.  If they can wish anything...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can wish no one will worry about you or look for you,&quot; I finished.  &quot;Face it, boys, or I guess I should say 'girls' now, you don't really have much of a choice.  But either way, you have to make the choice.  That's our rule.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad sighed again.  &quot;You didn't exactly give us a choice about this,&quot; he said as he gestured as his well-endowed features.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not,&quot; Rachel said.  &quot;But from here on out, you'll play the primary role in deciding your fates.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So here's what you're going to do,&quot; Kim said.  &quot;There is a room up at the top of the staircase.&quot;  She motioned to the staircase so they'd know where to go.  &quot;You're all going to go up into that room and discuss this between yourselves.  Make a decision and let us know.  Mike, I wish you could speak again once you get into the room, but not a second before that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, I had a feeling that I just had to act upon in the meantime.  So I added, &quot;I also wish that you will stay in the room until we say it's OK for you to come back down here and will talk at a volume where we won't be able to hear you down here.&quot;  I let the wish sink in as Rachel and Kim gazed at me with raised eyebrows.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you waiting for?&quot; Rachel asked.  &quot;Get going!&quot;<br />
<br />
The three of them stood up and walked to the staircase.  They all looked back at us as they ascended it.  Mike still looked as if he wanted to kill us, while Steve and Brad seemed to appear somewhat more contrite, while still very unhappy.  They walked into the room and closed the door.<br />
<br />
Rachel looked at me and said, &quot;What is so important that you need them to stay up there?&quot;</p>
