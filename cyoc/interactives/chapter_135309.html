<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Okay, now that we changed your stinky butt…” Sarah began with Paige giggling at the comment instead of taking offense, “I need to get you ready for our little shopping trip.”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean? Where are we going?” she asked questioningly.<br />
<br />
Sarah booped the little one year old on her nose making her smile cutely.<br />
<br />
“Well silly we need to go and get everything we need to set up your new nursery. Zane was going to do it himself but he only got around to finishing the machine when the accident unfortunately happened. He asked me to take of it if for whatever reason he was unable to, even gave me a credit card with a large amount of money on it to pay for everything. You should also know Zane really wanted to be here when you regressed and picked out all your baby stuff” she explained as the toddler girl’s face went from happy to downcast at the mention of her late husband, sniffling a little as her eyes became watery.<br />
<br />
Sensing Paige’s mood change Sarah pulling the baby girl into a loving embrace, patting her back as she attempted to calm her and keep her from possibly crying, “There, there Paige. I shouldn’t have mentioned that, I’m so sorry. Just know that I’m gonna be right by your side throughout your second babyhood, including this trip. I’m going to her you pick your bottles, pacifiers, clothes and lots and lots of diapers for you to make pee pee and poo poo in to your heart’s content” Sarah said empathizing her point by patting the toddler’s crinkly Pamper, Paige giggling a bit at the crinkling noises it made as her good mood return.<br />
<br />
Seeing the smile on the other’s face Sarah grinned, “There’s my happy baby girl.”<br />
<br />
Giving Paige a kiss on the forehead she then sat the girl down on the floor before rummaging through the diaper bag and pulling out an appropriate sized t-shirt and pants, along with socks and shoes.<br />
<br />
“These are some of my old baby clothes that you can wear, just until we get your new wardrobe” she said getting the toddler to lift her arms up so she could put the t-shirt on her, the bottom coming down to just over the waistband of her Pampers. Once it was on she looked down at and noticed it pink colored and had pictures of different colored cartoon butterflies on the front, loving how childish and perfect it was for her new age. Looking up Paige saw Sarah holding out the pants for her to step into and immediately shook her head, “Nuh uh, I don’t wanna wear those.”<br />
<br />
“Why not? I’m fairly sure they’ll fit you” Sarah replied confused at the girl’s refusal.<br />
<br />
“Cause they will hide my diapers from view” Paige answered matter of factly.<br />
<br />
Despite being an adult baby for three months she had thought up a bunch of things she’d do if she ever became a baby again. And now that her dream had come true thanks to her late husband’s genius she planned to do them all, one of them being going out in public with her diapers on full display.<br />
<br />
“Oh I get it, you want everyone to know that you’re just a little baby girl who isn’t potty trained and needs her Pampers to go potty in dotcha?” Sarah teased.<br />
<br />
Paige blushed slightly as she responded, “I couldn’t have put it better myself.”<br />
<br />
“Well don’t worry, unlike adults it’s completely fine for babies like you to go around with your underwear showing” she smiled then playfully added, “Not to mention cute. Also it’ll make it easier for me to change you if you need it.”<br />
<br />
Sarah then put away the pants and also the shoes telling Paige that she would just carried her around since she wasn’t that heavy, an idea that Paige really liked.<br />
<br />
“Okay, let me just get your new diaper bag ready and we’ll all be set to go” she said as she busied herself with putting away the changing supplies back into the duffel bag.<br />
<br />
The toddler blinked not sure if she heard the other correctly.<br />
<br />
“Wait, what did you just say?”<br />
<br />
Instead of answering Sarah got up and returned from the kitchen carrying a light baby blue diaper bag with a giraffe spotted pattern decal. There was even a picture of a giraffe on the side pocket with a flying bluebird right next to it. It also had an adjustable gray colored strap for hands free carrying. “So do you like it?” she asked as the baby girl excitedly replied, “Like it…I love it. Thank you so much!” She then gave her leg a hug as Sarah chuckled, “I thought you might. It was the only thing I picked out without you since I knew you would need one, well that and a car seat because of legal and safety reasons. I already have it set up in my car for you.”<br />
<br />
Paige couldn’t stop smiling, overjoyed that she now had her very own diaper bag.<br />
<br />
Sarah wasted no time in filling it up with the supplies, putting the bottle of powder and the packages of wipes inside before dumping in the small supply of Pampers. Zipping it closed she swung the strap over her shoulder then reached down and picked up Paige, cradling the toddler girl in her arms as the two exited through the front door, stopping only to grab her car keys off the kitchen table. Locking it behind her she walked the short distance to the driveway where her red SUV was parked, opening the backseat and placing her in the playskool brand car seat, adjusting the seat belt strap and locking her in. Paige loved the way the middle strap that went between her legs pressed against her padded crotch in a pleasant way. Climbing into the driver’s seat Sarah started up the car and off they went.<br />
<br />
As they drove Paige gaze up at the sky through the window and saw that the morning had already flew by and it was now noon. Good thing to since this was the perfect time to go somewhere since traffic was light and they arrived at their destination in no time at all. She smiled as the car pulled into the large parking lot of Babies R Us, the superstore that had everything for infants and toddlers.<br />
<br />
Paige had imagined one day coming here and shopping for herself…and now that day was finally here.<br />
<br />
Parking the car and grabbing a cart Sarah unbuckled her from the car seat and transferred her to the one in the cart, shouldering the diaper bag before entering the store with her in tow. Once inside she looked around and noticed that the store was mostly empty with a few shoppers around all of which were moms, a few of which actually having their children with them. The lack of customers didn’t surprise her all that much since it was a weekday, probably the reason Sarah chose to take her now when there wasn’t any crowds and they could shop in peace.<br />
<br />
And as for the shopping itself…it was a blast!<br />
<br />
Turns out doing it as a baby was a lot more fun than doing it as an adult, she got to be carted around which meant she didn’t have to walk anywhere and she got plenty of compliments from woman passing by on how cute and well behaved she was. Paige also didn’t have to lift a finger as Sarah would ask her to point out what she wanted and she would throw it in their cart. They quickly amassed a collection of stuff, including a box of pacifiers, baby bottles and formula which she always wanted to give a try. Baby food however was completely out of the question, there was no way she was eating that yucky stuff. Sarah understood and promised to make her child safe dishes instead which she preferred. Eventually they came to the diaper aisle which was her favorite in the entire store and Paige gazed up in wonder at the shelves lined with various brands of the crinkly padding she was currently wearing. Unfortunately they didn’t spend too much time here as Sarah quickly grabbed the wipes and powder along with two large economy sized boxes of 164 count Pampers three-way fit cruisers, her baby girl’s preferred brand.<br />
<br />
“Do we really need that many?” Paige questioned at the massive amount of padding she was buying.<br />
<br />
“When it comes to diapers you always buy in bulk…the more the better” Sarah answered as she placed the boxes in the cart, “These should last us about two months, give or take” she mused aloud.<br />
<br />
“Hey I don’t go that much!”<br />
<br />
“We’ll see” Sarah smirked in reply.<br />
<br />
As they turned a corner and walked down the next aisle Paige was caught off guard when she felt a sudden warmness on the front of her diaper, realizing with pleasant surprise that she was peeing herself. Just like when she pooped in the basement she had absolutely no control over it and didn’t know she needed to go until it already was happening. She sighed as her infant bladder continued to empty itself in the form of a warm yellow steady stream, the liquid flowing right into the Pamper she was wearing. The diaper did its job and thirstily soaked up her pee, the padding becoming puffy as the toddler flooded it with delight.<br />
<br />
“Sarah, I’m going pee pee right now” Paige announced in a hushed voice, tugging on the other’s sleeve to get her attention.<br />
<br />
The aforementioned adult looked down at the baby girl’s Pamper and saw a growing yellow stain around the middle, one that was starting to spread to the front of the garment.<br />
<br />
“Whoa, look at you go girl” Sarah praised her regressed friend.<br />
<br />
When Paige finally finished going her diaper was warm, wet and squishy; three sensations that she loved feeling. Moving around in her seat the toddler giggled at the squishing sounds her soaked padding made when she moved, feeling like she was on top of the world.<br />
<br />
“It’s a good thing you’re enjoying that wet diaper of yours because I won’t be able to change you until after I’m done paying for everything” Sarah said noticing the girl’s reaction.<br />
<br />
Paige just shrugged and started to suck on her thumb, not caring that she’d have to wait.<br />
<br />
“It doesn’t really matter since we’re almost done anyway. All that you need that’s left is the big stuff, a highchair, a changing table and crib” she listed off as she pushed the cart to the appropriate isle. Once they she got the appropriate item codes so she could pay for them at the counter and they would have someone cart it out to her car for her. After that was done Sarah began making her way to the front where the check outs were located and as she was doing so she pasted by the toy section and happened to notice a large bin filled with stuffed animals. Picking out a bunch she thought Paige was sure to love she tossed them into the cart before heading to the cashier. Paige didn’t see her do this because of her short attention span and also because she was too busy sucking on her thumb.<br />
<br />
As the lady at the counter quickly scanned and bagged their items she periodically glanced at the one year old sitting in the cart, giving the toddler a pleasant smile.<br />
<br />
Paige noticed this and shyly averted her eyes and while proceeding to suck her thumb harder. <br />
<br />
“Your baby girl is very adorable, especially when she sucks her thumb” the woman commented as she rang up the total.<br />
<br />
“Why thank you, I agree she is quite the cutie pie” Sarah replied as she pulled out her purse and swiped her card.<br />
<br />
“You might want to get one of those pacifiers you bought in her mouth as soon as possible” she playfully joked and Paige grinned at the idea.<br />
<br />
“Will do” Sarah laughed as she pushed the cart containing their purchases over to the exit where the restrooms were also located, pulling off to the side and stopping.<br />
<br />
Paige momentarily wondered why they weren’t going to the car when she remembered the wet diaper currently strapped to her waist and realized what it was time for. The warmth of her soaked Pampers was already beginning to fade as had the initial excitement of being wet down here, pardon the pun. So of course she was quite ready to be changed into a fresh dry pair of padding.<br />
<br />
“Aright little mrs. soggy, where would you like to get that change? I could change you in the women’s restroom or I could take you to the car and do it in the backseat. It’s your choice…whatever you’re more comfortable with.”<br />
<br />
Paige weighed both options carefully and decided she wanted to be changed in the…</p>
