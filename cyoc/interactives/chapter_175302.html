<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Tl;dr at the bottom since it is kind of a longer one.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Jeff awoke he was in his bed and his alarm clock was going off in his ear. Looking over to the right, he brushed some hair out of his face and hit the off button before pushing himself up off of his bed. Oddly enough, his view was still blocked by very long strands of white hair, and a pair of weights were swaying around hanging off of his chest. Looking down, Jeff sleepily identified the source.<br />
<br />
In an uncaring manner, Jeff grabs one of her breasts and gives it a gental squeeze. &quot;Hmm, these feel nice from this side too.&quot; For what it was worth, Jeff was quite happy with her cup size too. Large enough to be more than a handful, but not too large to look painful. Although at that moment, they suddenly didn&#39;t feel too great anymore as the hours spent sleeping on them had finally caught up to her. &quot;I guess I need to learn to sleep on my side or something&quot; Jeff said, now massaging her sore chest as she looked around her room. <br />
<br />
Instead of her usual plain room, this room was painted a darker shade of lavender, with matte purple bed sheets. Her light gray carpet was actually the lightest colored thing in here besides her hair, as even her lamp shades were a metalic silver color. <br />
<br />
With a yawn, Jeff slowly slid out of bed and stood up with a stretch. Looking down at her bed, she saw a deep purple bra had been flattened where she was sleeping. Upon further inspection she realized the last clasp had finally snapped off. &quot;Damn it. That was my last fitting bra too.&quot; <br />
<br />
It was quite an interesting realization for Jeff. He had the memory of his old life, but also had her new life&#39;s memories as well. His old life&#39;s memories actually felt more like a very vivid dream, eventhough she knew them to be real enough. &quot;It would seem that the world had been gender swapped&quot; Jeff said, stating the obvious to herself. However, she was really more annoyed with breaking her last good bra than anything else though. <br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, you two are just so damn expensive. What am I going to do if you keep on growing bigger and bigger?&quot; Complained Jeff halfheartedly, while she cupped her breasts. She loved her boobs since they made her able to wear a lot of ssxy clothing, or make even casual clothes sexier when paired up with her thin, well toned waist and nice ass. It was a figure she took a lot of pride in and did a lot of extra effort to maintain. It was just that constantly buying new bras for her ever increasing cup size was getting to be pretty expensive. This last bra had been a rather large C-cup, so she definitely was well into the D&#39;s now, maybe even E&#39;s soon after if their growth doesnt stop. Ah well, the bigger the better right? At least they were quite fun to play around with. <br />
<br />
Scratching her back, Jeff walked over to her dresser and took out one of her less than comfortable bra&#39;s and tried to fit into it. She couldn&#39;t even get the hooks to reach unless she really crushed her boobs. &quot;Fuck! And I have school today too.&quot; Since her cute and sexy underware was no longer any good, Jeff opted to try out one of her less attractive, but better fitting sports bras. &quot;It&#39;s still pretty tight, but I can at least manage it for today&quot; Jeff thought. She just knew that this next shopping trip would mean that another several hundred dollars would be down the drain. <br />
<br />
Looking through her drawers, she found a matching steel colored gray thong and put it on. Next she found her favorite top, a royal purple, low cut, crop top that showed off a fair amount of her cleavage. Luckily this at least still fit well enough to be comfortable. Adding to that the knee length, matching purple, high low skirt that her best friend had given her this year for her 18 birthday. It was a bit over the top, with the little black bows here and there along the hem, but she liked it a lot. Especially when she wore it with her favorite top and her gray, cable knit cardigan. Next she picked out a darker pair of tights and her black suede ankle boots. Sure walking with a 5 inch heel wasn&#39;t always comfortable, but they would look good with her outfit, so she grabbed them too and put them on her bed. Jeff was kind of surprised at how long it took her to do her makeup and fixing her bed head, which she then put it into a messy ponytail. It took well over an hours alone for her makeup and just brushing her hair. <br />
<br />
Now it made sense why girls always woke up at 6:00 am for an 8 am class that was only a 10 minute walk from her dorm room. Back when Jeff was a guy he would wake up at 7:40, throw some clothes on and would be out the door in 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
When you finished getting dressed, your roommate finally appeared to have woken up. Apparently he wasn&#39;t gender swapped. It was odd that 2 college students of opposite genders shared a 2 person dorm room, but searching your memory, you found out why. <br />
<br />
According to your memory, around 12 years ago, something changed all of humanity, which was apparently your changes taking place. Over a third of the world&#39;s entire population switched genders, whicb included yourself. As a result, gender swapped people were allowed to select to be either gender for all things. This included bathrooms and dormitories, as no one could come up with a better plan at the time due to the other part, the main part actually, of your change taking priority. <br />
<br />
You and Nick had been best friends since you were both 4, and now were sharing a dorm room together. You becoming a girl had strained the relationship a tad at first, however not enough to cause any lasting damage it seemed. Apparently he was responsible for your white hair too. Back in 9th grade, he dared you to do it. And you liked how it looked, so you kept it ever since. It made your green eyes really stand out too. <br />
<br />
As Nick walked out of his room, he rubbed his eyes and said hello. &quot;Sup. Yet again with the purple I see. You do know there are other colors besides that and grayscale right?&quot; You flipped him off and rolled your eyes. &quot;I know very well that my eyes are green, and this is the skirt that you gave me, you know&quot; Jeff sarcastically said back. <br />
<br />
&quot;What can I say, I have great tastes&quot; replied Nick. &quot;Anyways, I&#39;m taking my car to class today, wanna ride along?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, can you take me to the mall afterwards?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What, did you brake another bra again?&quot; Joked Nick with a laugh. But when he noticed you didn&#39;t say anything else he stopped. &quot;Oh, uh yeah. Sure thing. Does our usual deal still apply?&quot;<br />
<br />
It was an agreement you made. If he buys it for you, you promised that you would wear it for him at least a few times around your dorm room. &quot;Fine, but wait until I find my new measurements this time ok. And nothing orange or yellow this time either.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, how does maroon suit you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you know I prefer purple, but maroon is.... wait, you already have picked something haven&#39;t you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven&#39;t bought it yet though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever, I&#39;ll text you my new sizes once I get measured again.&quot; This wouldn&#39;t be the first time you were shopped for by Nick. Actually, he seemed to rather enjoy dressing you up. And if you were being honest, you did like the style of clothing he picked out. Well, aside from last time when he got you a short white sundress with orange and yellow colored lillies on it. It wasn&#39;t that it didn&#39;t fit you, but you hated the colors since they were just too bright with your white hair. You mainly wore it around now only when you had nothing else, but you would&#39;t get rid of it. <br />
<br />
Again, another shock came to Jeff. It turns out she secretly has had a hug crush on Nick ever since the 8th grade, but just didn&#39;t want to ruin their friendship. It was one of the reasons why she kept her hair dyed white, and why she let him pick out some of her clothes. Maybe on this shopping trip he will finally get your hint? <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, we will be late&quot; Jeff said as she put her purse over her shoulder hand pulled Nick by the hand out the door. &quot;And for the hundred thousandth time, just please call me by my girl name, at least while we are at the clothes store, ok? Odette shouldn&#39;t be that hard to remember since you are the one who came up with it. And you know how I hate people treating me like some kind of victim once they find out that I use to be a boy.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tl;dr<br />
Jeff is now a girl who lives with her male best friend Nick as college roommates who share a dorm room. She has white hair (dyed), loves the color purple, and has D-cup boobs that still are growing larger. <br />
<br />
Jeff doesn&#39;t really mind being a girl now, and is going shopping with Nick after class for new bras since she broke her last cute one. She and Nick have an agreement where she will wear whatever he buys for her. Jeff secretly has a crush on Nick in the new world. Jeff goes by Odette now, but Nick still calls her Jeff out of habit. They both are 18.</p>
