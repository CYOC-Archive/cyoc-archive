<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Adams knew that running directly to the cabin was a bad idea. Those guys were angry and they could follow him. No, he needed to confuse them.<br />
Instead of going back to the cabin he ran through the forest until he found a creek that leads back to the village. He followed it for a while when he saw an old warehouse with a watermill. He sneaked in and walked quietly through its old wooden floor.<br />
It was an awful place, full of cobwebs and mustiness. He thought that nobody could live there. It was a perfect place to lose his persecutors.<br />
He walked through a big hall full of boxes, some of them were empty but there were a few with food cans. He smiled, that&#39;s what he was looking for. He took several cans and put them in his backpack.<br />
After taking the food, he kept exploring the place. Oddly, the kitchen looked clean in contrast with the rest of the warehouse. He looked at the drawers and found more food cans.<br />
&quot;Maybe someone is living here...&quot; Adams muttered. &quot;I should be cautious.&quot;<br />
He left the kitchen and found another room. The only one closed with a door. He slowly opened it and crouched inside.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a bedroom.&quot; He said. &quot;And it looks like someone is living it.&quot;<br />
He explored a little until he was in front of a window. He can see the village from there. Outside there was a small crop field that didn&#39;t look too well. On there, there was a scrawny redneck boy, tanned by the sun and covered in dirt. He was wearing an old overall and nothing else. It looked like he was having a hard time.<br />
&quot;This village looks it&#39;s just populated by kids.&quot; Adams thought. &quot;How convenient for the research...&quot;<br />
Without thinking too much about it, he prepared the gun, aimed the boy and said before pulling the trigger.<br />
&quot;I guess the question is what I&#39;ll do after I pubertify all the boys in this town...&quot;<br />
*Zap*<br />
The kid fell in the mud and while he was getting up, the pubertification was taking place.<br />
Muscles and hair were blooming all over his body. A new height of 6&#39;1&quot; replaced his former 4&#39;10&quot; and his new size 14 EE feet get covered in even more mud.<br />
While he was panting, his chest was expanding his shoulders were broadening and his arms turned way more thicker than his head. His hands felt powerful, strong and tough.<br />
His face went through twenty years of maturity. His strong square jaw was soon covered in stubble and over his lips a small mustache could be seen.<br />
He tried to stand up but his new weight was unbalancing him. That&#39;s when he realized how big he was now.<br />
He gasped, on his crotch there was a bulge ten times bigger than before. He thought about taking off his overall but he won&#39;t be naked outside.<br />
He tried to run back to the warehouse but he lost balance and fell on the mud again. A long rip sound could be heard and when he got up he saw his torn clothes in the mud.<br />
He covered his new manhood really embarrassed although no one was around. His face was red of shame. He ran once again and Adams knew he had to hide somewhere. He hid under the bad before he was seen.<br />
The guy entered through the window as he used to do but he hit his head this time. When he rubbed his head he realized that hair had grown in his armpits too. He freaked and ran to a mirror. When he saw his reflection he can&#39;t believe it.<br />
He was older! There&#39;s no way a boy could suddenly become so big and sturdy. If it wasn&#39;t him he couldn&#39;t believe he was a kid a minute ago.<br />
He touched his face, rubbed his stubble and his hairy chest. Then he put his hands on his armpits. What a freaky beast he was!<br />
He lay on the bed. It cracked too loud that he thought it could break at any moment. His arms and legs were so big now that they hung outside the bed. Adams saw the hands and feet of a man not a boy.<br />
The guy was terrified but what took all his attention was the huge equipment that was hanging between his brawny legs. It was big enough to be as big as his former head size and the most hairiest spot on his body... and he had seen how hairy he was. <br />
He didn&#39;t know that man&#39;s genitals could be this big. He hadn&#39;t seen anyone as big and now he was sporting it. He felt ashamed. He felt like a monster. Tears were running through his face.<br />
He looked at his dick with more attention. It was so thick and long now that he thought he had a salami instead of a penis.  Even his tip had swollen. He was circumcised so it had a perfect pink mushroom shape. It made him blush even more. He was hungry and now he was comparing his dick with food. And talking about food, he also thought that his small balls had swollen to look like a delicious pair of chicken eggs, obviously ignoring the dense rug of pubes. In fact, he thought he was as big as the old bull he had.<br />
He was so embarrassed of that body that he didn&#39;t want to get out the bed.<br />
&quot;What I&#39;m going to do?&quot; Adams thought after realizing that.</p>
