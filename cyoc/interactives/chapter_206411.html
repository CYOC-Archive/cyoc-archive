<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the excitement still pumping through my heart I knew I needed to slow down. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I was still going to play around with my wife, but that had been enough for tonight.<br />
<br />
As Sarah the behemoth lay sprawled out before me asleep again I wished her back to her original body. The mass if flesh, bone, and tentical quivered as shrank. The extra limb in her middle withered back into her body, as did the plethora of tenticals that withdrew like dieing weeds. The hump of her back caved in back to the familiar S shape of a human spine and her fingers returned to her swollen limbs, the unsettling eyes at her wrists closing shut and sealing away. Over the span of a minute Sarah lay slightly curled up fifty yards before me in the white void.<br />
<br />
She rested helplessly before me, the slick sheen of moisture between her legs from her orgasim as a giant monster. She was out like a light and I scooped her up in my arms. Attempting to lift her up and realizing I was more out of shape then I thought. <br />
<br />
With a quick wish to make myself strong enough to effortlessly carry her I lifted her up and started across the void to the remnants of our bedroom. I layed her down on her side of the bed and and wished us back to our house. The walls dematerialized around us, and any smashed or over turned furniture from her expansion was restored. With Sarah in bed I went to my side and cuddled around her, makeing a wish that I&#39;d feel rested despite tonight&#39;s events. This magic wishing power had some rather useful though be it mundane applications.<br />
<br />
The next morning came as a surprise. As I was awoken by something I&#39;d never experienced. That being said let me say it wasn&#39;t that I&#39;d never recived head from Sarah, but I&#39;d never been woken up by having my dick sucked! (Highly recommend it) <br />
<br />
I was stired awake by the pleasing sensation of Sarah fully licking, sucking and kissing the tip of my morning wood. The covers of our bed bobbing up and down as I looked at her empty bedside and the mass that lay at my feet. When I flung the covers off to reveal her still naked form, her hair a hot(sexy) mess, she slowly deep throated my cock, pulling back slowly up its shaft, sucking on its head like a lollipop before letting it go to bob against my stomach and back to attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are,&quot; she cood up at me. I noticed her arm reaching under her disappearing between our bodies, her hips slowly ungilating as she masterbated. &quot;I&#39;ve been waiting for hours for you to wake up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before I could ask what she ment, she sprung up, pinning her hands to my chest and pressing me down, she then lept atop my cock easily taking it into her slick womanhood road me for all I was worth. As this went on I fully woke up and happily joined in the love making. Pulling Sarah close and passionately kissing her, touching her every way I could until she arched her back, buried her head into my chest and gasps, thrusting herself down deeply on my member as we both came!<br />
<br />
We layed in afterglow for a few minutes, cuddling in our sweat dampened bed, breathing heavily to eachother. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where did that come from?&quot; I eventually asked after a long while.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had a really, uh... rousing dream last night, I guess?&quot; Was her response. &quot;And when I woke up I was still really, hmm &#39;needy&#39; lets say.&quot; Her face was flush with color either from her embarestment at her words or her continued afterglow.<br />
<br />
We both cleaned up and hurried out the door. The unfortunate reality of our day to day lives compleatly ruining the moment that morning. (Note to self; wish more free time for myself in the morning.) Sarah was the first of us to leave and I took the opertunity to to glance a peek at her dream journal finally. <br />
<br />
The entries from the past few days were all their. The heaviness of the first night, when I&#39;d made her over 300 lbs heavier. The unsettling gross feeling she&#39;d experienced from being half centapide. Most recently as the behemoth was the most vividly written, though the writing was quickly scribbled, likely trying to get the whole thing down before she forgot its details.<br />
<br />
Reflecting on these I recalled that after each experience Sarah had been influenced by them in the morning. The relief of her weight loss the first night, the gross feeling after being part bug, and of course the horny, dominate sex drive just this morning from being a turn on monster.<br />
<br />
At work I&#39;d simply wished my work done, with one or two mistakes so I wasn&#39;t turning into te golden employee, yet. This freed up alot of time to think on what to do tonight. I became really excited when I realized it was Friday and a long weekend (note to self; wish for more long weekends)<br />
<br />
I&#39;d have 3 uninterrupted nights and days to further play with Sarah! This got me really pumped for tonight and I started brainstorming all kinds of things.<br />
<br />
Friday night came and after the usual set up of letting Sarah sleep first before joining her I started I acting the first step of my weekend plans.<br />
<br />
I got into bed, making myself comfortable and silently made my wish. &quot;I wish that as I sleep I will be in a dream state. While in this state I will control my wife&#39;s body from the neck down as though it were my own. My body will still speak when I think about speaking, but still be asleep. Sarah can still wake up, but as long as I&#39;m sleeping I will pilot her body.&quot;<br />
<br />
I then spent the next few moments drifting to sleep.<br />
<br />
As I dreamed I could see through my wife&#39;s body. More to say my &#39;sense&#39; of vision was just at the top of her neck, I could also hear myself snoring obnoxiously, (bless my wife&#39;s heart for putting up with me) i could also feel my own leg as Sarah&#39;s foot brushed up against it. In an excited rush I brushed Sarah&#39;s legs against eachother, feeling them as though they were my own, cuz they were!<br />
<br />
The way I&#39;d thought of this happening was just as I&#39;d wanted, I was basically my wife&#39;s body, her own sleeping head the only thing I didn&#39;t control. Slowly I swung out of bed and set my wife&#39;s dainty feet to the floor, lifting up on her legs to stand. Shifting my view down I tested the next part. <br />
<br />
As I didn&#39;t control Sarah&#39;s head and had linked my speech back to my own body I thought a whisper to myself. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wish Sarah&#39;s breasts would grow two cup sizes.&quot;<br />
<br />
I heard the muffled words come form my body and suddenly a warmness spread over Sarah&#39;s breasts! They surged forward going from B to D in just seconds! It was notably arousing and I was excited that I could now feel everything that I put my wife though over the next few nights! The wishing even worked!<br />
<br />
To excited to experiment more i got started with my weekend plans!<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish...&quot;</p>
