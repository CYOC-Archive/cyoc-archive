<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A furry paw shuts of the alarm as it buzzes. The sleepy werewolf yawning as he slowly wakes up looks at the time.<br />
‘Seven am,’ Evan thinks to himself; ‘It feels like I slept in.’<br />
“You’re not in the military anymore love,” a sleepy voice speaking next to him; “so stop thinking you are.”<br />
<br />
Evan turns his head to see his wife Maggie nearly nine months pregnant. Placing a paw on her taught swollen belly and rubbing it gently; Evan growls in joy as he feels the fetal heartbeat and a kick. His future son or daughter; Evan beams as the due date for his and Maggie’s second child is coming up in a few weeks. Smiling as he gets up to begin his day. For Evan it still feels like yesterday as he had a farewell party at the nearby military base back in January. Finishing up his latest service run; the now retired navy seal had one hell of a bash. The party doubling as a congratulation party after several NCOs*found out he was going to be a father again. Being served cake in the shape of a baby in military fatigues for his sendoff party was a humorous touch for the retiring Captain.<br />
<br />
It was roughly a week after he retired from military service did Evan begin working for Tachibana’s security division. Answering directly to Daisuke; Evan was busy managing from the mundane to personally handling security details. Trading in his military dress uniform for a suit; Evan felt right at home with what he was doing. Looking at his wife as she still slumbers; he makes sure the blankets are covering her good; tucking her in so she doesn&#39;t feel cold as Maggie was wearing pajamas. While he was in his werewolf fursona; Maggie was not. As a doctor, she knew the risks of a pregnant female were shifting into their fursona or back. Now on maternity leave from the hospital; both she and Evan waited with baited breath as any day she could go into labor.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Showered and dress; Evan heads downstairs to the kitchen to see his father making breakfast. The hundred and fifty year plus werewolf named Mike Lawson smiles as his son looks at him disapprovingly.<br />
“I thought I told you to stop breaking into my house,” Evan looking at his father.<br />
“Get better locks then,” Mike chuckling as he pours a cup of coffee; “Coffee?”<br />
“Perhaps I’ll install a bear trap at the door,” Evan jokes; “that might stop you.”<br />
“Then I’ll just go through the window,” Mike smiling; “you aren’t keeping me from my grandchildren.”<br />
“I thought you and Mindy were living together now,” Evan sipping his coffee; “what happen?”<br />
“We are content to be boyfriend and girlfriend,” Mike answering; “but we do spend a lot of time at each other’s place if you know what I mean. Son,” Mike being serious; “at my age it’s too late to start another family. You, Spencer, Maggie and baby to be are the only family I have left. If your brother were still alive,” Mike sighing.<br />
“I miss Spencer as well dad,” Evan responding; “but it was his own stupid fault for getting shot down in Vietnam.”<br />
“Your brother did have a talent for flying choppers,” Mike answered; “even if they were medical choppers, he still served proudly. Never forget that. Yes he detested using guns, even though he went to medical school to become a paramedic; he was still drafted to serve. Thank goodness his drill sergeant recognized his talents and had him assigned to one of those M.A.S.H units**.”<br />
<br />
“So did you just break into my home,” Evan drinking his coffee; “just to make coffee and talk about the past?”<br />
“Well I was going to make breakfast,” Mike getting up; “but you came down before I could start frying up the bacon.”<br />
“That can’t be your only reason,” Evan smiling; “come one you randy old codger out with it.”<br />
“I was going to see if breakfast,” Mike smiling; “was going to be enough to butter you and Maggie up to tell me if your baby will be a boy or a girl.”<br />
“You can try,” Maggie staring at the two men; cradling her very pregnant belly; “but I’m not.”<br />
“So you do know,” Evan looking at his wife; “tell me so we can finish the nursery properly.”<br />
“No dice,” Maggie chuckling; “you’re just going to have to wait until it’s born. Now where is breakfast,” Maggie easing herself into the chair; being pregnant has affected her mobility, but not her hearing. She heard father and son talk from the bed room and came down to investigate.<br />
“Cagey just like before,” Mike shaking his head; “Evan your wife was like this when your daughter Spencer was born. Bet you,” placing the skillet on the stove; “you’re going to have another daughter.”<br />
“You have a fifty percent chance in being right,” Maggie grinning; “you dirty old man. Now where is breakfast, it’s not polite to keep a hungry pregnant lady waiting.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Evan surprised at how his wife could pack away the food; eating several plates of eggs with bacon and toast. While he knows she is eating for two; the amount of food was enough feed an army, metaphorically of course. Eating his scrambled eggs and toast along with a second cup of coffee; he wished he could remain at home to be with Maggie; but with today being a work day, Evan had to be at Tachibana’s head office soon. Kissing his wife as he gets up to leave; reassuring her to call him if she starts feeling contractions. Both cars already packed with what they would need for Maggie’s stay at the hospital; He heads off to work, leaving Maggie in the care of his father Mike Lawson.<br />
“So what’s on the agenda today,” Mike collecting the dishes.<br />
“House cleaning,” Maggie grinning; “and boy do I have a chore for you.”<br />
“Okay,” Mike looking bemused; “I’ll bite. What is it?”<br />
“The nursey needs a coat of,” Maggie grinning; “blue paint. But don’t tell Evan.”<br />
“It’s a boy,” Mike looking surprised; “you’re giving me a grandson?”<br />
“Don’t tell Evan,” Maggie pointing a finger at Mike; “I want him surprised.”<br />
“He is going to find out when he smells fresh paint and sees the nursery finally done,” Mike answering.<br />
“By then he and I will be alone once he get home from work,” Maggie getting up slowly; “You will be gone. Spencer will most likely be hanging out with Eric and Frieda.”<br />
“Oh no,” Mike looking at Maggie; “I’m sticking around to see my sons face when you tell him. Plus there is still some of that leftover buck,” Mike speaking; “that needs cooking. Mindy will also be coming over.”<br />
“Fine,” Maggie shaking her head; “but keep this between us. I WANT to surprise MY husband with this news.”<br />
“Oh I promise,” Mike smiling ear to ear as he watches Maggie leave the kitchen; “but you never said for me to not tell Spencer.” Getting out his cellphone he texts his granddaughter the big news.<br />
