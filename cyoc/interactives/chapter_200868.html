<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The air was hot and humid when the plane came in for a landing in New Delhi, and Abby could feel that as she and her family came across the terminal and into the airport&#39;s main internal area. Even inside the heat was present and the air conditioning systems seemed to be trying to combat it at a low whine. It was something that made it feel more like mid-July rather than the last few days of May but seeing the new colony that was being set up was intriguing, and apparently the mayor of the town being called the &quot;City of Kings&quot; as an alternative to its regular name that the Indian people knew it by had heard on Animalia Ambassadoria and had requested her and Samson to provide some of the coverage. Abby wondered on how good their connections were, as she and the original cast hadn&#39;t been on the show as anything more than guests for about two years. College life had taken them away from Lyre/Animalia and they wouldn&#39;t give the extensive breaks and funding that Animalia had done while they were in High School. Though, a part of her figured that maybe they were more fans of the original crew and just asked for her and Samson on that basis. Either way, it made for an interesting adventure, which her parents were happy to join in on.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s hotter here than it is at home,&quot; Martin Brown commented as he and Josephine on his arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we are much further south than Lyre/Animalia right now,&quot; Abby commented, &quot;that may account for the heat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully Sylvia stays in line,&quot; Martin then nodded, earning some chuckles from Abby and Samson.<br />
<br />
The idea for the vacation had come from her parents, and that included the new Indian colony specifically. There was still some concern that mare Sylvia who had been working for them might get a bit distracted while they were away from home, but even that wasn&#39;t too much of an issue. The biggest times of the year for the Brown Farm, particularly after Animalia got started, first came in spring when the apple trees started growing out their leaves and with flowers soon coming. Proper pesticides and measures would have to be used to help protect against things that might parasitize the trees, and this HAD to be done BEFORE the trees put out flowers. After that came the fall harvest and making sure the apples didn&#39;t go rotten on the tree. During the summer, there was largely only regular watering and making sure no one damaged the trees, not super intensive, and in theory all things that Sylvia and the others could do.<br />
<br />
The biggest worry was more with focus, and there, Abby knew that was where friends came in. Their neighbors agreed to help take in the mail, and Sarah and Malice were more than willing to keep an eye on Sylvia and those that might be too distracted without them there. It was good seeing her friends again, or at least most of them. Sarah, Malice, and Tavis had the free time to volunteer. Simon couldn&#39;t, as he was pulling shifts with the Animalia PD by now, which had Malice all excited. Sophie, Roland, JC, and Paula were likely still on the road back from SMU&#39;s Dallas campus and thus weren&#39;t able to be there before the Browns flew out. Jessica and Roger were there, and they shared some stories from the theater classes and activities they&#39;d had at UNLV, but they also had some other stuff going on that related to Roger&#39;s human brother.<br />
<br />
It all made for a good story. Abby remembered that Codey Lightfoot was a good kid, though heavily interested in the Power Rangers and enjoyed martial arts as a result. In middle school and high school, it was something that Abby paid little attention to, but Jessica ended up learning more about it as she dated Roger. After the Shikamatsu family moved to Lyre/Animalia and also became Rabbit Animalians and began setting up a martial arts school, Codey and Roger took lessons there and remained dedicated to it, Codey especially, though largely because Roger was soon dating Jessica and Animalia Ambassadoria at that time took them away from those lessons. Of late, while Cody was attending the University of Washington, he&#39;d also been dating Michiko Shikamatsu, and from what Abby had heard through the proverbial grapevine was that that romance was starting to become serious. Abby then figures that Jessica and Roger were busy helping Codey get ready for becoming an Animalian to be with Michiko. Abby had no problem with that, and even told Jessica and Roger to wish Codey the happiest, and with Sarah and Malice keeping an eye on things on the farm, there wasn&#39;t too much worry about Sylvia and the others getting too distracted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure Sarah, Mary-Alice, and Travis can keep her in line,&quot; Josephine commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Particularly as they&#39;d get the opportunity to give Belle and Bash some opportunities to explore as well,&quot; Abby smiled, &quot;things will be fine, dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin nodded as he stretched his back a little after the long flight. He did agree, and a part of him was more than happy for a bit of a vacation, as Abby had often reported various other Animalian Colonies when in high school and to a degree that made him curious. Thus, with the Indian Colony being new, that seemed like a good place to visit. They soon were making their way from the terminal toward the baggage area, thankful that the instructions were actually posted in multiple languages, including English. He didn&#39;t recognize the other languages, but he did recognize the English signage. They eventually got to the baggage area and collected their bags as they rolled along the metal conveyor belt.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how do we get to the new colony?&quot; Samson wondered as he lifted up his bag and noted some of the looks of attention from others in the area. Some were other travelers, and some were likely employees of the airport.<br />
<br />
&quot;The tourist guide said they would have a driver waiting for us,&quot; Martin said in response, &quot;and they said that they did have some vehicles for Animalians of most sizes, but that much of their work and activity was rather local in nature.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll probably be part of what they&#39;re wanting us to show and report on,&quot; Abby commented, &quot;essentially how a colony with a taste of India and its laws.&quot;<br />
<br />
They made their way out, and the sun beat down on them and it felt even hotter. If they were Dog Animalians they&#39;d be panting, though they also soon found one that was standing near a large van and holding a cardboard sign that read &quot;Brown&quot; on it. This Dog Animalian had black hair on his head but had reddish-orange fur with a more creamy-orange chest, and with some black on the top side of a rather short tail, at least when compared to the Fox Animalians they knew in Animalia and Lyre. It&#39;s muzzle, while pointed was not quite as long as a Fox Animalians. They approached him.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are the Browns,&quot; Martin introduced himself, &quot;I am Martin, this is my wife, Josephine, my daughter Abby, and her bond-mate Samson.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Amit,&quot; the &quot;Dog&quot; Animalian answered, &quot;I will spare you having to try and pronounce my last name... so you may call me Amit.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Browns nodded, though Abby&#39;s curiosity was running high.<br />
<br />
&quot;May I ask... what breed you became?&quot; Abby asked, &quot;One of my friends became a Siberian Husky Animalian during the second &quot;outbreak&quot; in Lyre... though I don&#39;t think Sarah or Malice would take to the heat here well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... it is hot and muggy this time of year, but in a few days the monsoon season will start with the start of June and will give some sense of relief,&quot; Amit answered, &quot;though, in what you are calling &quot;the City of Kings,&quot; it won&#39;t be as bad as it could be in other parts of India, as much of Rajasthan is pretty dry all year around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now, some rain would be welcome,&quot; Samson commented as they climbed into the vehicle, and hearing a few flashes of cameras snapping photos.<br />
<br />
&quot;That it would, but the monsoon season doesn&#39;t start until early June, we&#39;re still in late May,&quot; Amit answered as he moved around and then climbed into the driver&#39;s seat, &quot;but to answer your question, I did not become a Dog Animalian. The species is a canid, but NOT a domestic dog. I am a Dhole Animalian. All of us in &quot;the City of Kings&quot; became Animalians based on Animals native to India.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Were any animals uplifted?&quot; Samson wondered as they began to move along, and Amit was negotiating traffic.<br />
<br />
&quot;There were a few dogs that were uplifted to treat some injuries and diseases they had,&quot; Amit answered, &quot;but other than things like that... no. Mostly because animals like the tiger, rhinoceros, and others in this country are critically endangered in the wild. Uplifting them would remove them from the balance of nature. The hope with the project is that Horizon can help us become more productive and use less land... which would then help our wildlife recover.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like a very noble venture,&quot; Josephine commented, &quot;though we would like to visit the hotel first before getting into anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Understandable, it&#39;ll also be a while before we get back to the &quot;colony,&quot; so there are no concerns,&quot; Amit answered, &quot;I do have an igloo in the back with some salads in it, case you would want a snack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is most kind, thank you,&quot; Josephine answered.<br />
<br />
The ride did end up taking a while, and while Amit was a good drive, that didn&#39;t make negotiating busy traffic and long roads easy. It made some of the heat even tougher to endure, which then made the arrival of night something that was welcomed. It brought an end to the worst of the daytime heat, though the Browns also found that things were a bit different as they drove along. There were also questions on how wildlife was dealt with and if they were ever seen on the road. Amit often answered that was all possible, but that it was generally safer during the day, at least with regard to things like tigers and leopards. Amit also explained that the Tiger Animalians that worked as both police for the village and as forest guards had also taken on roles that would be akin to territorial marking that might deter un-uplifted predators.<br />
<br />
It was actually fairly late by the time they came into &quot;the City of Kings,&quot; and Abby noted that the sign was different from what it had been advertised as. Or at least that was what she could notice before they drove past the sign and the lights from the car&#39;s headlights began to illuminate the rest of the small town.<br />
<br />
&quot;I couldn&#39;t help but notice...&quot; Abby began.<br />
<br />
&quot;The town&#39;s name?&quot; Amit answered, &quot;I am not surprised. &quot;City of Kings&quot; was something more that Animalia and Horizon thought would sound &quot;cool,&quot; I believe the word is. And for promotional material, that&#39;s fine. Particularly since Horizon paid for the entire town to be rebuilt in a style that matches classical Mughal and Maratha architectural designs for palaces and other major public places. Many of us have never even visited places so rich. In this, Horizon did invest a lot of money in the project... but we would prefer the name we&#39;ve always had. In time, the sign may be updated to include the nickname that Horizon wants... but we will be keeping with our traditional name for our town. And it&#39;s been a good name and fits with India&#39;s present status as a republic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t you have a king, though?&quot; Samson wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Technically, one could say that our last king was George VI of Great Britain, but the last local monarchs and royalty go back to the Marathas, well before the 20th Century,&quot; Amit replied, &quot;after independence from Britian in 1947, we became a republic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll need some help with the precise pronunciation,&quot; Abby commented, &quot;so as not to be offensive with regard to the coverage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the mayor can help with that,&quot; Amit answered, &quot;but that would be best until later... it&#39;s late, and I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t want to wrestle with an angry Indian Elephant Animalian.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not,&quot; Martin and Samson both agreed.</p>
