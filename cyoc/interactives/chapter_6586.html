<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As I waited for the changes to take place, I made a few quick wishes in my mind.  Essentially, I wished that my clothes would rip completely off my body as the change took place.  That way she wouldn't have to see a nude male body, and I could make this more of a spectacle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm waiting, Joe,&quot; she said.  She was still sitting on the couch, and judging by the tone of her voice and the fact that her arms were folded in front of her, I knew she still didn't believe me.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Just be patient,&quot; I said.  I could already feel my body hair pulling itself back into my skin.  Unfortunately, she couldn't see it as I was wearing a button-down long sleeve shirt and a pair of khakis.  I looked down at my hands and saw the pink color reforming.  I held my hands out in front of her so that she could see my hands change.  &quot;See?&quot; I asked. <br />
<br />
Her eyes went wide as she saw my nails extending outward.  She could also see my hands and fingers get smaller as my fingernails became colorful as well.  I lifted my left foot off the ground, and was surprised to see that the shoe did not come with it.  As a matter of fact, neither did the sock.  I lifted my right foot and saw the same thing.  Kristy stood up from the couch and looked down at my still shrinking feet.  Just as before the toenails were painted pink.<br />
<br />
A sudden tearing noise grabbed our attention.  I was amazed to see that the slight arm muscles were developing now.  But even more amazing was that they were big enough to burst through the sleeves of my shirt.  In a matter of seconds both arm's sleeves were tattered rags.  Then I felt my arms retaking the feminine proportions of earlier.  Kristy was so amazed that she came up to me, and tore the remaining pieces of cloth from the shoulders.  She watched in fascination as my arms thinned.<br />
<br />
That was nothing compared to what happened next.  Another sound of ripping fabric happened, this one from my legs.  We both looked down to see my khakis being torn to shreds by expanding leg muscles.  Apparently my wish to make as much of the clothes rip as possible dictated this happening.  Kristy looked as my leg muscles expanded out.  Just as with my arms, my legs the thinned to feminine size.<br />
<br />
I started to feel changes happening elsewhere.  I could tell that my eyelashes were lenghtening and my nose narrowing.  I could also being to feel my penis losing its girth.  But for some reason, nothing else was happening there.  I felt my shoulders start to crunch inward, and my chest and stomach followed suit.  I started to groan in pain.  Kristy, who had started to run her hands over my smooth, toned legs, shot straight up when she heard me groan.  &quot;Your voice!&quot; she whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; I groaned.  &quot;Is my Adam's apple still there?&quot;  I guessed it was because my voice was only somewhat higher.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, &quot;but it's going away!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; I said, my voice still climbing the octave.  I let out a few more groans of pain, while at the same time I felt my cheeks rounding and my lips fulling.  &quot;Look at my face,&quot; I said.  <br />
<br />
She did and immediately gasped.  &quot;It's changing!&quot; she said.  She put her left hand on my cheek.  &quot;I can actually feel it,&quot; she said in amazement.  <br />
<br />
As she explored my face, I felt my pants getting tighter around my hips.  &quot;Watch this,&quot; I said.  My voice was now almost back to the high pitch it had been in my house.  She was about to ask where I wanted her to watch, but then she saw what I meant.  The button on my khakis suddenly flew off, almost hitting Kristy.  The sides of the pants exploded, giving way to my expanding hips.  What was my best pair of pants was now no better than a rag.  The remnants of the pants fell to my side, leaving me in only my boxers and my half-torn shirt.  <br />
<br />
My boxers were also feeling the strain of my hips.  They ripped up the sides as well.  Kristy jumped to my side and saw my skin being exposed through the hole.  However they didn't rip through the elastic waistband.  But they were about to.  I felt my ass start to swell.  My ass cheeks pressed firmly against the thin fabric of the boxers.  Then they tore through in the back.  Kristy moved behind me and saw my smooth, rounding ass for the first time.  Between the pressure of my ass expanding now, in addition to my hips, the waistband gave way.  My torn boxers dropped to my ankles.  I was now naked below the waist.<br />
<br />
My genitals had still not shown much sign of changing.  I wasn't sure why.  At long last my hair lengthened.  As if in some race to catch up, it grew much quicker than it had the first time.  My face twinged in pain once more.  The final changes were occurring there.  Once it finished, only my breasts and pussy had yet to appear.  Kristy had started to run her hands over my ass.  It felt so good.  She really seemed to admire how smooth and round it was.  &quot;My face,&quot; I whispered, my voice now fully feminine.  <br />
<br />
Kristy walked back in front of me.  &quot;Oh my God,&quot; she said.  Her hand shot up to her mouth, covering the shock of what she saw.  &quot;I-I can't believe...this.&quot;  Her eyes narrowed on her last word.  It looked like she was trying to figure something out as she gazed at my face.  In the meantime, I unbuttoned the bottom two buttons of my shirt and held the strands apart.  I had a feeling my penis was about to go away.  <br />
<br />
Indeed, I felt the changes resume in my groin.  Kristy took my cue and looked down in awe.  My penis shrank further, while my testicles quickly deflated and my scrotum withdrew to form the opening of my pussy.  This change also happened quicker than before.  By doing so, it caused me to feel more concentrated pleasure, too.  I felt my knees buckle once more, and hoped that I wouldn't orgasm in front of her.  In just over a minute, my penis disappeared within my reformed pussy and became my clit again.<br />
<br />
Kristy still held her hand over her mouth.  That must have been a truly shocking experience.  But it was nothing compared to the final change.  I could feel my nipples become more sensitive and poke against my shirt.  I knew what remained of it wouldn't last long once those nipples decided it was time to push out.  I unbuttoned the thirdmost bottom button, as I felt it wouldn't spring off once my breasts grew.  I was just in time, as I felt my nipples straining against the material of my shirt.  The first button sailed over Kristy's head.  The pressure was too much for the shirt to handle.  The second button went flying and Kristy could clearly see my expanding cleavage.  The third button quickly followed the second button.  When it did, my shirt hung open for a second, before somehow deciding to simply fall of my shoulders.  I was now completely naked.  I saw my breasts growing again.  They were already approaching the C cup range at this point.  A few more seconds and they grew to the previous D cup size.  I was able to keep the feelings of pleasure at bay this time.  I just wanted Kristy to enjoy the show.<br />
<br />
When my breats stopped growing, Kristy removed her hand from her mouth.  Her mouth was wide open in shock.  She still could not believe what she had witnessed.  But it had happened.  I stood before her, in all my naked, feminine glory.  I smiled at her and asked, &quot;Do you believe me now?&quot;</p>
