<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“If you continue to make up fantastical stories,” Amanda said, lecturing her friend Mary Kate. “One day you'll <br />
end up in a–” <br />
<br />
Just then, Amanda's eyes grew wide as saucers. Her jaw dropped and the half-eaten sandwich in her hand fell to <br />
the lunch tray on the table in front of the girls.<br />
<br />
All the girls sitting at the table with Grant had similar shocked reactions. Grant had been staring down at <br />
his tiny, feminine hands, feeling embarrassed and humiliated about having to pretend he was a teenage girl. <br />
Now he looked up from his plaid, uniform skirt and finally saw what had stunned Mary Kate's friends into <br />
momentary silence.<br />
<br />
Hovering in the air right above the lunch table was the ghostly blue, translucent image of a chubby, nerdy <br />
looking teenage boy.<br />
<br />
“I'm sorry I ever laughed at you, M.K.,” whispered Colleen. <br />
<br />
“Make it go away,” hissed Penelope. <br />
<br />
“Mary Kate, I'm scared,” breathed Edie.<br />
<br />
Grant, whether because he was truly a confident and mature grown man or because his Mary Kate persona was <br />
unflappably unfazed by encounters with the paranormal, managed to somehow maintain his composure. <br />
<br />
“Who are you?” he asked the spectre.<br />
<br />
“You can all see me?” replied the fat, ghost boy. “Good! Then I've finally managed to do something right. Now <br />
don't look too shocked or anything. You ladies at this table are the only ones who should be able to see and <br />
hear me. So... uh... like, just keep eating casually, y'know? As though everything is normal.”<br />
<br />
“Who are you?” repeated Grant, a little more firmly this time.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I'm sorry,” said the overweight phantom. “I'm still pretty new at all this occult business, y'know. My <br />
name is Paul Hodgson – and I am a wizard.”<br />
<br />
“You look like a ghost,” said Colleen.<br />
<br />
“You look like a dork,” said Penelope.<br />
<br />
“I get that a lot,” said Paul. “The dork comment, not the ghost one. Look, this ghost image of me is just an <br />
ectoplasmic manifestation... like astral projection or something. I'm not really here. I'm using magic to <br />
communicate with all the people who've suffered at the hands of my friend Timmy.”<br />
<br />
“A fat ghost is warning us about his evil friend Timmy?” Edie said sarcastically. “I don't know how you did <br />
this M.K., but I totally know this is some stupid practical joke of yours.”<br />
<br />
“I assure you, this is no practical joke,” continued Paul. “And your friend... uh... Mary Kate is it? Yeah, <br />
she's not really... well... y'see, she's the reason why I'm here is... because... ah...”<br />
<br />
“I'm really a man,” said Grant flatly. <br />
<br />
“Bingo!” grinned Paul sheepishly.<br />
<br />
The other girls all sat glued to their seats, slack-jawed and bug eyed now with a mixture of confusion and <br />
amazement.<br />
<br />
“My friend Timmy got possessed by a demon,” explained Paul. “It's a long story – and my fault ultimately, <br />
which is why I'm trying to make amends for everything. But it was Timmy who changed an adult man named... no, <br />
wait... don't tell me... I'm getting better at this part of magic... ah... erm... Grant is it?”<br />
<br />
Grant glumly nodded his head.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, Timmy changed Grant into Mary Kate,” said Paul. “And he's been doing a lot of other really bad things <br />
too. There's a demoness possessing Timmy and putting all these ideas into his head. You see, it all started <br />
with my uncle's spellbook. I accidentally switched my friend Timmy into the identity of an evil, old lady. <br />
Well, for awhile she had me fooled into thinking the spell hadn't worked and she was really my friend Timmy. <br />
But by the time I finally saw through her deception, it was too late. I'd thrown away the spellbook and poor <br />
Timmy, living the old lady's life, well... he had died.”<br />
<br />
The girls all gasped.<br />
<br />
“I don't really know exactly what happened after that,” said Paul. “I suspect poor Timmy wound up in Hell or <br />
something. That would explain why some demonic succubus is manipulating his actions now. Anyhow, I finally <br />
reacquired the spellbook I had thrown away, and I've been studying it and trying to use its powers to correct <br />
all the horrible damage Timmy has been inflicting on everyone. But since I'm pretty new at this whole <br />
wizarding business, and because Timmy has the almost unlimited powers of the infernal realm at his fingertips, <br />
well... uh... it's been slow going.”<br />
<br />
“Excuse me,” said Grant. “There's one thing I don't get. The people who did this to me were both girls. One of <br />
'em was a vampire; I'm sure of it. The other could have been a demoness or something. I really don't know.”<br />
<br />
“The vampiress is one of Timmy's victims,” explained Paul. “And the other woman is my friend Timmy – <br />
transformed in both body and spirit into an evil, female creature from the bowels of Hell.”<br />
<br />
“So... uh... like... Mary Kate is really a man?” asked Colleen.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” said Paul. “And I might be able to change her... erm... uh... I mean HIM back to normal. I can't do it <br />
long-distance like this. We'll all have to meet in person.”<br />
<br />
“Why all of us?” asked Penelope.<br />
<br />
“Well, as I was saying,” continued Paul. “I'm a bit new at this whole magic-user thing. And I'm currently up <br />
against a Princess of Perdition. I can really use all the help I can get! I'm sure that if we all team up <br />
together, I can change your friend Mary Kate back into a man and then...”<br />
<br />
“Ewww, I can't get over that,” said Edie. “I've known Mary Kate all my life! How can she really be a man?”<br />
<br />
“Reality has been altered,” said Paul patiently. “History has been re-written. But if you team up with me, I <br />
can protect you all from some of these reality re-writes that are still occurring. Please, I really need some <br />
help at this point. I obviously can't rely on the evil, old woman inhabiting Timmy's old life. In fact, she's <br />
another nemesis I'll have to deal with later. But first, I absolutely have to do something to save Timmy's <br />
soul and cast out the demoness within him. And I just can't do that alone.”<br />
<br />
The girls all looked skeptically at one another. Only Grant spoke up.<br />
<br />
“I'll help you anyway I can, kid!” said Grant in his chirpy, girlish voice.<br />
<br />
“Thanks,” said Paul with a smile. “I... uh... don't have lots of friends, so I really will need all the <br />
support I can get. How about the rest of you ladies? Care to go on a genuine demon hunt with me and Mary <br />
Kate?”<br />
<br />
“Don't call me Mary Kate,” grumbled Grant sullenly.<br />
<br />
