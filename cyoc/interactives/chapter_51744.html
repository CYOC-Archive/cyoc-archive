<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was nothing more dangerous than a wounded and cornered animal. A creature with <br />
nothing left to lose was very very dangerous indeed. Golgatha and Gomorrah had <br />
promised that victory would taste so bitter than those who rejected chaos' paradise that <br />
that they will have wished for defeat instead. And they would do everything within the <br />
infinite possibilities of chaos to do precisely that. Any who set foot on this island would be <br />
handed a Pyrrhic victory so utter and complete, they would use the curse to bring thee <br />
chaos down on themselves, freeing them from every restraint and regret. <br />
<br />
Gaal, whose name meant abomination was gone however. Their left Gogatha and <br />
Gomorrah broken. The black cat Herodias though of the loss of the familiar Lilith, and the <br />
loss of Gomorrah's familiar the crow Salome before their deaths...  She was the only of the <br />
familiar three left. <br />
<br />
&quot;No matter the price sister,&quot; Gomorrah's twisted shadow that was part of the curse spoke <br />
in the Curse World thinking of her biological elder sister Gaal. &quot;I promise we'll make our <br />
dream a reality... we'll make the prudes pay. And we'll liberate all we'll come across now <br />
and bring them into chaos' paradise!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our enemies are closing on us fast, and we've been robbed of Glass and some of the <br />
chimeras... &quot; Golgatha said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mistress.&quot; The twisted shadow of the black cat Herodias said, &quot;Our options dwindle even <br />
as our enemies close in... Glass didn't even think to use her infinite turns!!! We have gone <br />
from being closer than ever from liberating others... to being almost annihilated... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you desire to see Gaal avenged Gomorrah?&quot; Golgatha's shadow asked holding on the <br />
arms of the the witch's echo in the curse world. <br />
<br />
&quot;More than anything.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Then we must become more.&quot; Herodias' shade said  knowing where this was going. <br />
<br />
&quot;IF FIRST YOU DON'T SUCCEED!&quot;  Gogatha began and Gomorrah finished. <br />
<br />
&quot;CHEAT-CHEAT-CHEAT until you do! Rules are for sheep!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or Dare mistresses!&quot; Said Herdodias. <br />
<br />
&quot;Transform!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform your spiritual essences so no Dare or Transform worded by or aided in the <br />
creation of by Alice effects us or whoever and whatever we may become!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Such an utter and complete violation of the rules that had held the game together of <br />
course caused them to sink deeper into the infinite chaos, driving them MORE insane. <br />
<br />
&quot;If we are to succeed at all, we must become stronger than Gaal ever was...&quot; Golgatha said. <br />
<br />
&quot;That is impossible.&quot; Gomorrah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE IN THE INFINITY OF CHAOS!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YES MISTRESS!&quot; Said Herdodias! <br />
<br />
&quot;We must BECOME the chaos! We must BE the chaos... divided we are broken...&quot; Gomorrah <br />
said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only whole we were truly unbeatable...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then united we must be! In a way as never become!&quot; <br />
<br />
In the curse world, with knives willed out of the chaos, Gomorrah and Golgatha stabbed <br />
themselves in the wombs, cutting them open, and out slipped twisting churning chaos in <br />
it's absolute form, and it dove into the shadow of Herdodias' mouth, and them covered the <br />
black cat familiar shadow completely. <br />
<br />
The chaos congealed, only one thought and identity and purpose remaining, turn all to <br />
chaos, have all who reject chaos BREAK.<br />
<br />
The mass of chaos shaped like Herdodias grew, expanded, twisted, warped, and grew <br />
some more, becoming something truly awe inspiring as the chaos was tempered and <br />
directed as selves of the witches and familiars melted and twisted back upon themselves. <br />
<br />
In the curse world, what stood up was a naked, black twelve foot tall cat woman, with <br />
breasts only somewhat smaller than Amethyst's. Her eyes glowed green, she looked down <br />
at herself as she flex her very impressive muscles. One moment she was baled, another <br />
she had long black hair, another she was a blond in braids in no logical pattern.  <br />
<br />
And the curse world grew twisted and warped. <br />
<br />
Herdodias, Gomorrah, Golgatha, Eris herself, Lady Discordia, or the much more simple and <br />
direct name &quot;Kurse&quot; what did it matter? Her mind was a picture of perfect, flawless utter <br />
and complete insanity. <br />
<br />
The flower symbol that was on the backs of the gem wolf pack, now lay like a fur birth <br />
mark over one eye. The shape of her eyes and the shade of her coloring reminiscent of an <br />
anime character almost. <br />
<br />
The newborn demigod smiled at she felt herself, her tail swishing behind her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooh yesss.&quot; She moaned as she felt her own breasts and explored the space between <br />
her legs. &quot;Gaal, the world of chaos will be reality... and you will be avenged... &quot;<br />
<br />
In three steps she was before the chained wolves and yacht passengers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Glass is gone... oh well... &quot; She kelt down before the bound captain, his cloths vanished <br />
into the chaos, and immediately, she began to hump him. And his form within the world of <br />
chaos, became that of the blind monsterous warped centaur that he was in the real world. <br />
<br />
She then went to one of the other women in the ground, the cat woman grew a penis just <br />
long enough for to invade and violate the innocent woman, whose spiritual also twisted <br />
and warped until all that was left was the creature of chaos. <br />
<br />
Time had limited meaning in the spiritual realm and she repeated this process over and <br />
over, finding new and grotesque ways to hammer her way of 'thinking' into each of her <br />
'subjects.' Until all that remained where her creatures of base impulses and loyal gem <br />
wolves. With the last little boy whose friends were now the remaining three chimeras, she <br />
opened up a sea of chaos below him, and plunged him in, when she pulled him out, an <br />
exact replica of -their- Glass remained. Who prompty hugged her mother, her crystal <br />
reflective form (lacking an alernate form) turned rainbow colors, then cool colors only then <br />
warm colors, then clear, then black glass, then clear with tint of pear, the color changing <br />
remaining until they broke apart.<br />
<br />
The act being nothing more than a play acted parody of the kind of love Samantha had for <br />
her family. <br />
<br />
&quot;There is no way to win when you have an opponent who can cheat all she wants!! And I'll <br />
cheat, and I'll KEEP ON CHEATING, until the chaos is all that is left everywhere!&quot; <br />
<br />
And a black shock wave came of the island in all directions as the weather around the <br />
island went completely and utterly mad. And Amethyst, on her knees covered in runes <br />
drawn in blood, was raised up as a crag rose up in the middle of the island with a small <br />
mesa on which Amethyst now knelt a similar crag with a spiral staircase leading to the <br />
waiting two muses for the third. Similar flat crags rose up underneath of the gem wolves, <br />
leaping from one to another in a completely chaotic dance devoid of harmony or pattern <br />
as the creatures of depravity continued their actions below. <br />
<br />
Amethysts said in a tranced voice, &quot;Chaos must never end! It CAN never end! Forever, <br />
ever, and always! Spread out further! And further! Until all is but beautiful and free chaos!&quot; <br />
<br />
The gem wolves all cheered at this not breaking stride in their dance of insanity among the <br />
crag tops.  Kurse in the curse world made a slash motion, and suddenly all the gem <br />
wolves were all twins, but also now Amy's age and the new sets of twins continued their <br />
dance. Kurse in the curse world clapped, and the wolves' skins fell away leaving only living <br />
crystaline form the same color as their names, and stil the living crystal twins all continued <br />
their dancing of absolute chaos in celebration of Kurse's birth, leaping from peak to peak, <br />
only Amethyst still the same for the moment on the outside. <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
All those recently transformed by the curse felt the black shock wave, including in a <br />
distant town a girl with cat ears and tail. <br />
<br />
Amy felt sick as she got back to her feet, the only one had actually been knocked down. <br />
The six children (three girls and three boys) had fainted from the trauma of their changes, <br />
hopefully their parents would be saved by the time they woke up. Sarah moved them to <br />
one of the bedrooms. <br />
<br />
'No... I knew they were insane, but I never imagined they were THAT insane... Whatever <br />
they did... it felt like some THING was just born. Something that uglier than ugly.' <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Strangely, the only ones this didn't effect was Kirk and Penny, made because their love for <br />
each other was at the front of their minds (an emotion the witches never put much stock <br />
in) or maybe it was some random kindness of divine will. Whatever the chase, Kirk and <br />
Penny (both directly effect by the game and thus more aware of changes to reality than <br />
everyone else who was not) still hugging each other early in the morning after 1 am in the <br />
morning (the staff not feeling like telling the lions visiting hours were long long over and <br />
Penny should have been resting), were quite surprised when a lioness and lion entered the <br />
bedroom, and quickly hugged Kirk, crying, and swearing they'd do their hardest to protect <br />
their son from now on. <br />
<br />
Kirk of course, was very surprised to see his parents as naked lion people with his father's <br />
wallet only on a cord around his neck hidden by his mane. &quot;Mom, dad, is, is that, is this <br />
really you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know it's been far to long son, but you still recognize us right?&quot; Gloria said fearful the <br />
curse had left her son unable to remember his own parents. <br />
<br />
Kirk wondered if his own existence as a lion person had caused his parents mutation, not <br />
knowing it was the fact the parents and child loved each other and had interacted that had <br />
triggered the changes to reality. <br />
<br />
Kirk DARED break away from the hug with Penny for a brief moment and hugged his <br />
parents in return, &quot;I recognize you both! I promise!&quot; Which was true, for while he WAS <br />
surprised to see them as lions like he was, and knew for a cold hard fact he, and his <br />
parents had been human before being trapped as a statue... he found it hard to picture <br />
them as human... <br />
<br />
Penny was even more surprised, but she said nothing... 'Kirk is going to have a lot of <br />
happy reunions to go around...' <br />
<br />
Gloria looked at Penny, &quot;Oh Penny thank you! ... So have you booked the church yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom!&quot;<br />
<br />
The elder lioness in the room teased, &quot;Sorry son, couldn't resist!&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
At the police station, Serenity too felt it, like the curse was almost going into overload, had <br />
-almost- gone off with the force of a nuclear explosion (but thankfully had not). And now, <br />
the feeling of a gigantic turn constantly in use was only bigger, like a cancer that had <br />
made six month's progress in the space of a minute.  <br />
<br />
In fact, Serenity was sure she was feeling what might have been chaos effecting those <br />
altered by the game here in Glendale, herself included. She couldn't bring herself to count <br />
on who was in the room with her and who wasn't. Who was at Smith's manor she had <br />
never been to personally? it ALMOST felt like people were shifting and teleporting around <br />
randomly. Serenity shook her head, gray to God Almighty that what she felt was just <br />
disorientation, otherwise they'd have a horde of insane wolves and lions in Glendale. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is going getting worse, and is going to continue to get worse... &quot; Madam Serenity <br />
said, &quot;if you're going to invade the island and enter the mental world of the curse to <br />
destroy it I suggest you do it very very fast and very very soon! Otherwise it'll be like <br />
trying to save a terminally ill patient... My curse enables me to have a distinct feeling of <br />
the curse's activities and... it feels like looking at a cancer growth in fast stop motion...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm still going.&quot; Trevor said simply.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
The wolves began to gather in the living room, to settle the insanity that had briefly <br />
entered the manor in the form of the six monsters. <br />
<br />
&quot;MOMMMY!&quot; Samantha shouted hugging her mother Fran letting herself be lost in her <br />
mother's bosom, Fran enjoying the smooth feeling of her baby against her body. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay dear, I'm right here, nothing bad will happen to you again, I promise.&quot; <br />
<br />
Wanda and Nillie stood back to back looking at all the wolves, the place utterly and <br />
completely reeked of dog! The smell was nearly intolerable for the lionesses unless they <br />
happened to be engaging in an all out assault which they were not. <br />
<br />
&quot;Things are just getting crazier and crazier.&quot; Wanda muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just figured that out?&quot; Nillie said... &quot;Yes this morning, well, yesterday I guess now, we <br />
were just a couple of guys, now we're lion girls in the fast tract to weird relationships one <br />
oh one!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The last part doesn't sound TOO bad...&quot; <br />
<br />
Amy staggered, her mother holding her paw. &quot;Zelipe, you and the others stay here where <br />
it's relatively safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Zelipe said. <br />
<br />
The other pups didn't complain, huddling among themselves between Mr. P and Miss <br />
Martha Pack Omega, shocked to the core of Samantha's attack as Glass and the six <br />
monsters that had come to kidnap them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alice, Abbey, Samantha, we're going to need you too.&quot; Amy said. &quot;I'm sorry Samantha but <br />
we really do need you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We understand.&quot; The three said together. <br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Fran said with finality, &quot;Samantha's been hurt enough tonight, I'm taking her to bed, <br />
hopefully when she wakes up in the morning this'll all be over.&quot; <br />
<br />
The other two triplets nodded in agreement. <br />
<br />
&quot;Very well.&quot; Amy said. <br />
<br />
June said, &quot;Amy do YOU really need to go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm the largest mobile source of white magic in Glendale, I'm the only thing that can face <br />
the curse toe to toe.&quot;<br />
<br />
A middle aged she wolf with white fur said, &quot;I'm am going to rescue my nephew, you can <br />
bring me along or I can sneak along, you're choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish.&quot; Amy sighed knowing this part was beyond her control. <br />
<br />
The she wolves were of course surprised that Lawrence HAD an aunt. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
A minute or so later at the police station and Alice returned along with Nellie, and Wanda... <br />
and a white wolf with red brush markings. <br />
<br />
The catholic priest turned ape and Shinto Priestess turned wolf girl calmly walked to each <br />
other and stared into each other's eyes passively. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're naked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So are you. My theology strictly says that reincarnation is fiction. I'm going to believe that <br />
you're merely being guided by the spirit of the woman you believe yourself to be a <br />
reincarnation of.&quot; Signed the great ape. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fair enough.&quot; Amy nodded, after all, there were elements of Paul's theology that Ami's <br />
theology had taught were fiction so it was a square deal. &quot;So you have the power to drive <br />
out demons?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My grandfather was an exorcist.&quot; Paul sighed, &quot;I studied under him in depth before I was <br />
struck by the curse. I have used those talents since I accepted my fate once.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your conviction is strong, your faith powerful, and your desire to help others with no <br />
thoughts to yourself are genuine and not clouded. You can fight along side me to destroy <br />
the curse's awareness I am certain of it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thhhank-yuuu.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome.&quot;<br />
<br />
The clock struck two AM. <br />
<br />
Brian said, &quot;You can take us right to the island, we provide a distraction for the people <br />
who the curse had warped, and you and Father Paul destroy the curse's brain?&quot; <br />
<br />
Amy nodded. <br />
<br />
Gill said, &quot;You're not going.&quot;<br />
<br />
Felicity said, &quot;Go to Hell.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Why you-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;GILL! Don't,&quot; Serenity pleaded, &quot;Just don't, it's past late, we're all tired, but we can't afford <br />
to stop against a thing that doesn't tire. ... We just don't have time to argue.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gill groaned, &quot;Oh to hades with it all. You brought this transformation on yourselves, go <br />
get slaughtered and leave your daughter an orphan for all I care.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She won't be Chief even if that happened, which won't,&quot; Elise said, &quot;She's part of the <br />
pride, she's ALL of our responsibility.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gill was too tired to argue. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come back safe okay,&quot; Mary hugged Trevor. <br />
<br />
&quot;I will I promise.&quot; Trevor hugged Mary. <br />
<br />
'You aren't as off the hook as you'd like everything to think Trevor.' <br />
<br />
The tired Trevor heard a non-human, non-cat familiar voice say at the back of his mind, <br />
Trevor ignored it. <br />
<br />
Gary said, &quot;Alright. Brian. Felicity. Bobbi, Bernie, MJ, Wanda, Nillie, Lexi, Megan, Sasha, Fox, <br />
Elise, Areal, Armisael, Ma'akh, Gabriel. Jensen Smith. Glass wolf-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Alice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;-Alice. We're going in!&quot; <br />
<br />
Each of the lions took hands, with Gary taking Alice's hand, Jensen taking his daughter's <br />
other hand. <br />
<br />
Alice entered the mirror world, the rest following. Jensen's appearance... was nothing <br />
short of a victorian monarchy minus crown or scepter. The lions... many were dressed as <br />
english bobbys. Arael, Gabriel, and Mal'akh were unexplicitly dressed like something out of <br />
the zero century Israel. Brian and Felicity were dressed in African tribal gab that wasn't all <br />
that much had tattoos on their bodies. If Trevor had been there he would have had similar <br />
to Brian and Felicity and would have Mary.<br />
<br />
Ami asked Paul to relax, and was surprised to find the great ape already in a meditation <br />
pose lifted by his hands and having his 'feet' in yoga gestures looking very calm. Amy only <br />
nodded and assumed a meditative pose herself. <br />
<br />
Trevor looked completely out of place the Lutheran christian now lion boy tried to make <br />
himself comfortable. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Abbey took the hand of her mother, and Darla, Beth, Yomato, Chiyoye (still with breasts <br />
that were larger than was biologically possibe), Zack, June, Hope, Grace, Isebelle, Megan, <br />
Margot, Ashley, AND OF COURSE Nicole, flicking her red ribbon one time for good luck <br />
(not that she believed in luck), Nick, and forever loyal Alexandra.  And bringing up the rear <br />
was the three musketeers: Millie, Robyn and Maxine. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why are we doing this idea?&quot; Millie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because it's the climax duh! I'm not missing that and neither are you!&quot; Maxine cheered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ya'all think we should be thinkin' more how we're all girls now that our heads are all <br />
cleaned up all pretty?&quot; Robyn asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;at this point,&quot; Maxine said, &quot;The only way any of us are going to stay sane is to go with <br />
the flow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Every nodded at that. <br />
<br />
Alice had used the reflections on her and Abbey's body to start handing out cure vials, <br />
(there would be plenty of time to make new ones for the wolf pack and pride to use on <br />
themselves later), Amy said that with the curse having disregarded anything resembling <br />
rules on the island, that the white powder would be actually MORE potent in it's <br />
effectiveness than in Glendale, so each assault memember was handed a vial of the <br />
powder as if they were grenades. <br />
<br />
In a mirror behind Kaylee, a crystal glass wolf head came out and whispered the game to <br />
her, Kaylee became paralyzed. A minute later with everyone looking at the assault group <br />
she was pulled into another part of the mirror verse.<br />
<br />
A minute ahead of the two assault teams (three if you counted Paul and Amy/Ami) the <br />
new Glass emerged holding the hand of the dainty and obedient and submissive Kaylee, <br />
her eyes solid gradient yellow. She spoke not a word as she emerged from the solid <br />
reflective surface that had twisted into being just for her entrance, Glass let her go and <br />
Glass ready  to do her part of drawing out the conflict as long as possible with no intent of <br />
winning only extending the life span of the chaos when the heroes arrive a minute from <br />
then.<br />
<br />
Kaylee not speaking a word walked up the spiral crag, the now truly gem wolf twins <br />
dancing around her like they were in low gravity almost dancing from one crag face to the <br />
other not slowing down or hitting each other once. Some leapt on and off her, some <br />
danced around her, but she just continued her peaceful and calm trek up the crag until <br />
she was before the incomplete statue. <br />
<br />
'Incomplete, because I'm not there, I am a part of this art, yet I am not there, that is <br />
wrong. I love being beautiful, now I can be beautiful forever, now I shall experience the <br />
statue transformation that I have wondered about for so long first hand.' Kaylee thought <br />
her thoughts in a twist fog her mind becoming the twisted fog. <br />
<br />
She stepped onto the pedestal, turned around, and calmly assumed the pose of the middle <br />
muse, a moment later, her body faded to solid marble, a smile on her face.  Thinking of <br />
how beautiful she looked, the other two parts of the statue also saying how beautiful she <br />
looked, and how cool being a statue was. <br />
<br />
The two teams led by the indestructible Abby and Alice, (her mothers switching teams <br />
midway to look after her child) emerged on opposite sides of the island. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to Big Bad Island... I am Glass, we encourage all guests to full embrace their <br />
impulses and whims and experience absolute freedom.&quot; Glass said to Abbey's group as <br />
they emerged half-hazardly from the now pitch black waters around the tropical island at <br />
two PM in the afteroon on the other side of the world from Glendale. &quot;What awaits you is <br />
pure and absolute happiness.&quot; <br />

Ami found herself naked holding a brush in her right hand, a bow in her left hand, and a <br />
quiver strapped to her back. Paul also looked much the same except a bible in latin in one <br />
hand, and a stick the likes of which you'd doodle in the sand in the other. His crucifix was <br />
still around his neck. <br />
<br />
Amy hadn't known was to expect, but seeing in the distance a fifteen foot tall black cat <br />
woman with ample breasts laying lazily on her side on a freight struck sized couch wasn't <br />
one of them. <br />
<br />
Amy didn't look back to see what Trevor looked like now. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to Big Bad Island, my name is Kurse, with a K. I'll be your newborn goddess <br />
today. If you were expecting anyone else by the names of Gomorrah, Golgatha, or a lady <br />
familiar named Herodias, you'll be happy to know you're speaking to her right now. So sit <br />
back, relate and let your base impulses be your guide without taboo and without being <br />
judged for acting on those impulses. So let all those urges go and run with'em!&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul said, &quot;Derr ez, on-lee, onn god, ann' ed izzent, yuu.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kursed frowned.</p>
