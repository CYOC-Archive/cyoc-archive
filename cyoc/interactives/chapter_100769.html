<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{{Before we begin, my description of Spencer&#39;s were form is based upon information from the previous episode &quot;Moving Day&quot;. If not totally accurate, it can always be tweaked later.—tmw.}}<br />
<br />
Martha Anderson watched Gina Watson walk away, a heady trail of pheromones in her wake. Whether the woman was conscious of the act or not, she was leaving a strong, sexual scent behind.<br />
Fighting the urge not to strip, assume her werevixen form and begin pawing her soaking vagina right there within her own classroom, Martha gathered her things for the day and went out to her car. Sadly, she had already said &quot;no&quot; to Liz because of the parent/teacher conference she was glad happened, although it was much too soon to initiate further contact with Gina, but there were still others available to help scratch her own itch.<br />
She tried calling Samantha Twist first, but was told by her secretary that the Town Chancellor was in a meeting and couldn&#39;t be disturbed.<br />
Not bothering to identify herself or leave a message, Martha hung up and called Frances Twist. Her secretary Rudy put Martha through almost instantly.<br />
&quot;Hey hun. What&#39;s up?&quot; asked Frances, purring into the phone.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m horny as hell! Can you help?&quot; inquired Martha. Dr. Twist&#39;s therapist office was farther away from the elementary school than the town hall, but still closer than her own home or anyone else she could have called.<br />
&quot;I sure can,&quot; Frances said happily, already picturing a <b>very</b> private session between the werevixen and the werecat. &quot;I&#39;ve already seen my last patient for the day and was just catching up on paperwork.&quot;<br />
&quot;Twenty minutes?&quot; asked Martha eagerly, while starting up her car and securing her seat belt.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll send my secretary Rudy home now and let you in myself when you knock on the outer door,&quot; promised Frances, already anticipating what else she would let Martha into.<br />
&quot;See you soon doll,&quot; promised Martha with a yip of things to come, before hanging up her cellphone and leaving the elementary school.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
After locking her bedroom door, Spencer Lawson stripped and stood in front of the full length mirror in her bedroom, admiring her young body.<br />
At 15, she was in-between the brothers Anderson age wise, which put her in kind of an unique position; since she was finding herself attracted to both.<br />
<i>Nate&#39;s older, and probably a lot of fun in the sack,</i> Spencer thought happily, as she cupped her pert young breasts and teased the nipples into further hardness.<br />
<i>Yet while still a virgin at the moment and a year younger; Eric&#39;s cute, and I could certainly teach him a thing or two,</i> she thought with a smile, as Spencer lowered a hand to start fingering her already wet cunt.<br />
<i>Nate&#39;s definitely seeing someone on the sly though,</i> thought Spencer, as she recalled the mysterious text he received during school and the lingering scent of werepanthress on him. <i>Which just means he&#39;s more experienced, and knows how to treat a woman right,</i> she realized, while noticing that she was starting to get taller as fur began to sprout across her body.<br />
&quot;Hmmmm.....&quot; moaned Spencer, as a paw started caressing her clit.<br />
<i>Eric&#39;s &quot;inexperience&quot; would be a good opportunity to show him how to treat a lady properly from the start,</i> realized Spencer, grasping her now much larger bosom with one paw, as the other sank deeper into her vagina. <i>I&#39;ve never been with a virgin before, but I would love to personally handle his sex education classes,</i> she thought with a smile across her newly formed muzzle as she reached her goal of having another self induced orgasm.<br />
<br />
As she brought her wet paw up and slowly began to lick her own juices off of it, Spencer Lawson stared at her fursona in the mirror.<br />
She was still a growing girl. Currently at almost eight feet tall in her full were state; she was a rare, unique, but natural hybrid of werewolf and werecat.<br />
The all black fur covering her entire body was as thick as a wolf&#39;s, but as silky to the touch as a cat&#39;s.<br />
Her four paws were feline, giving her a distinct advantage over her lupine cousins by granting Spencer the ability to climb trees and other obstacles.<br />
The muzzle, with its thick jaws of sharp teeth and stub nose was definitely wolfish, which gave Spencer the ability to track scents better than a cat. She couldn&#39;t really tell which side her eyes favored, because they didn&#39;t quite look either lupine or feline, and both species were capable of seeing in the dark. However, whatever fate(s) there might be decided she should have an ear from each side of her genetic makeup, for neither species was the stronger when it came to hearing.<br />
Spencer&#39;s tail was long and sinewy like a feline&#39;s, but the fur was bushy like a wolf&#39;s.<br />
As she turned this way and that to study herself in the mirror, Spencer once more appreciated her unique status as a hybrid; but there was absolutely no denying she was all female with her bountiful bosom, sleek fur covered curves, and very wet vagina that was demanding more attention.<br />
<br />
Going over to her bed and pulling out her favorite &quot;toy&quot;, and very thankful her father still had yet to discover her &quot;collection&quot; during any of his &quot;quarters&#39; inspections&quot;; Spencer began pleasuring herself with the foot long fake penis, even as she wondered which Anderson to express an interest in.<br />
<i>Why not both?</i> she asked herself, shivering in anticipation of being double teamed by two healthy and eager young men at the same time. A thought which caused her to drive the pseudo-cock deeper into her cunt.<br />
The only glitch in her fantasy was the fact that besides still being a virgin, Eric Anderson was still a normal.<br />
Spencer had yet to be with one, so had no way of knowing if the guy&#39;s first transformation after having sex with her would favor the wolf, the cat, or beat the odds and create a hybrid were like herself.<br />
But there was also that Julie Stovall to consider. Despite the fact Eric appeared to be as thick as a brick when it came to understanding women, the were-mermaid did have a serious interest in him.<br />
<i>Maybe she&#39;ll thank me for doing her a solid and showing Eric the ropes,</i> thought Spencer, picturing getting a little &quot;tail&quot; from the blonde were. <i>Wouldn&#39;t be the first time I sampled from the alternate menu,</i> she thought, happily recalling her past lesbian experiences. While Spencer thought semen was the more tastier treat, especially direct from the source, there was nothing wrong with an occasional taste of honey too.<br />
<i>Then again, if she objects, guess I&#39;ll have my fish dinner another way,</i> thought Spencer with a low, menacing growl; before her animalistic noises turned to softer mews of pleasure as she shuddered from another orgasm.</p>
