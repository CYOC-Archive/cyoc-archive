<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake waddled down the hall of his house. The colors on the walls were yellow with white polka dots on one side whilst the other was stripes of teal and red. Down the stairs he went with a jolly stride in his step and sat down at the breakfast table. <br />
<br />
Mom was cooking sunny eggs omelets for everyone. Her hair in a huge green bun with a pencil sticking out of it, and I standing a ridiculous foot tall. She wore an apron that was also green with frills and white polka dots over her women’s business suit which was blue along with her tie, the shirt was white though. Her shoes were large size 16 clown flats also blue but had green soles and her leggings were white with green stripes. She was a business clownette, or more accurately a teacher at the local college. <br />
<br />
Her face consisted of the same orange triangles around her eyes as Jake and she also shared the red dotted freckles on her cheeks as well. Her lips were done in a red smile that extended just past her lips. Furthermore eyebrows were also black but were just simple, nearly straight curves just above her eyes. Lastly, dead center in her face was a red clown nose that was the same shade of Christmas red of Jake but a different shape than his own.<br />
<br />
Dad was sitting nearby watching the news, he looked like an older version of Jake in regards to his mouth and eyebrows along with his red nose size but it was a darker red. Around his eyes there was nothing and his cheeks had a red blush to them giving him an appearance of Santa Claus. He was heavier than Jake and his hair was also bright yellow and balding in the same style. He was wearing his pediatrician uniform consisting of a white doctor coat, a light blue vest and pants, a white shirt underneath and a purple bow tie with polka dots. His shoes were classic style clown shoes but black with yellow laces. <br />
<br />
“Morning Mom, morning Dad.&quot; Jake said as he plopped himself down in the colorful chair at the kitchen island. Mom came over carrying a plate of food for him. It was a pair of confetti pancakes, along with sliced slippery bananas fresh out of their peels. There was also a smaller side plate with a pair of sunny side up eggs for him. &quot;Morning Jake, you better eat up. You have to get to school soon.&quot; Jeff nodded and took a bite of his pancakes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, also I have good news. The tailor called this morning, your tux is ready for homecoming this weekend. They said you could pick it up after practice today.&quot; Dad said as he looked over at Jake. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, your&#39;e homecoming as a senior. Your&#39;e going to look so funny in that tux.&quot; Mom said as she smiled and squeezed her nose making it squeak. (Remeber, this is a clown world. So funny means handsome) Jeff smiled at the thought, but internally, his stomach was turning more than a cotton candy machine. He didn&#39;t have a date for that yet and he was running out of time. <br />
<br />
Jake was so absorbed in his thoughts about a date that he didn&#39;t realize he had finished his plate of food. It was only the action of his mom reaching in front of him and squeezing her sons large red nose. &#39;HONK&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jake sweetie, you really need to stop spacing out like that. I have been talking to you trying to say you need to get off to school or you are going to be late for school.&quot; She said that as she shook her finger at her son and her rear in a funny manner, exactly in the sight of her husband, Jake&#39;s father. <br />
<br />
Jake face palmed himself, nodded at his mom and stood up form his chair. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll see you all later tonight after practice. Will be back as soon as I can&quot; Jake said that as he adjusted his hat, put on his backpack and waddled out the front door. Jake went to his clown sized sedan, colored green with red wheel rims and climbed in. He then pressed on the horn a few times with the window down. &quot;Come on Carla! We got to go, we have school!&quot;<br />
<br />
Carla, or Caroline, was Jake&#39;s neighbor and an old friend. She was a whiteface like Jake, and slightly shorter. She had bright orange hair that was a fluffy mass on her head. She had black lips in a smile and pink hearts on her cheeks, blue eye-shadow and black lines for eyebrows. Her nose was pink and the size of a tennis ball. On them was a pair of large glasses that were also black. She was wearing a pair of red Susie Q overalls, and blouse puffy sleeves along which was white with polka dots. She was wearing black converse sneakers that were size 16 for her feet and lastly a pair of sock that were striped red that led into the overalls.<br />
<br />
Carla, ran out of her house and ripped on her own feet and due to her bad vision. She somersaulted into the open door of Jake&#39;s car, and the two of them sped off school.<br />
<br />
A minute later, the doorbell of Jakes house rang. His mother andwered it and standing there was the mailman, an older auguste with the daily mail. &quot;Morning Mrs. Smith, mighty fine day isn&#39;t it.&quot; He said as he squeezed his nose hello.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it is,&quot; she replied as she squeezed her nose in greeting back took the letter and other mail he was holding. &quot;I saw Jake pick up Carla in his car.&quot; Mrs. Smith nodded. &quot;I think I want to add to the neighborhood pool. I think its going to happen this weekend given its homecoming.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, then come by later today with whatever you want to add. He better ask her, its painful to watch then both all the time.&quot; She said as she waved goodbye, and closed the door, and squeezed her nose with a giggle at the thought of Jake and Carla together at homecoming.</p>
