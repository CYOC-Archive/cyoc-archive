<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Evan woke up today and yawned stretching out her body as much as she could. It was 3 months since she became a breeder and she was showing very prominent signs of pregnancy. Her stomach bulged out with her udder and she found it a bit different to deal with at times, but she was fine with it.<br />
<br />
Evan’s human memories have all faded away except for the last day before she arrived inside the palace. She stood up and walked over to the table then she sat down and studied her oversized belly and sighed. She had been tested by doctors and nurses alike, and by law, and it seemed that Evan was going to be the proud mother of twins.<br />
<br />
Evan took a deep breath and sighed now then she rubbed her breasts and massaged them as routine before she was to feed any calves at all. She sat there and caressed the fur along her sensitive nipples and moaned, and soon she found herself groping, and pinching at her nipples to see a small bit of milk squirt out.<br />
<br />
She stopped of course, she had to save as much milk she had for the calves anyways. So now she looked to the door and waited for the guards to bring in someone for her to nurture, some would be intruding humans about to become a breeders like her. Then others like bright and young calves that would either grow into soldiers, or remain young and beautiful girls.<br />
<br />
It was then her chamber door opened, but this time she was greeted to a new sight. She stood up and saw that the captain of the guards walked in, and Evan recognized him by his scent, his heavy metal armor, and his helmet. Immediately, Evan dropped to her knees and bowed before this minotaur and the captain patted her on the head for doing so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this the one?&quot; The captain asked, and Evan peered up as she heard the clopping of someone else. Then in walked the minotaur, the same minotaur that Evan nurtured and blessed with her former masculinity, the minotaur that is the father to her calves, and the one that she would never forget.<br />
<br />
The minotaur Evan raised had multiple scars on his body, some of which looked to be caused by beasts such as dragons and other extremely dangerous creatures. The most noticeable scars was a humongous horizontal claw mark across his chest, and a a diagonal scar on his back that could have been caused by a sword or an axe.<br />
<br />
&quot;She’s the one captain, she’s the one I want.&quot; The minotaur that Evan nurtured exclaimed then the captain nodded and said,&quot;Very well then, she’s all yours then Bovran, all yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
The captain then turned to Evan and said,&quot;Your time as a breeder who feeds young is over slave. Now you belong to one of my finest soldiers, he is your master now.&quot; The captain said and Evan paused then she asked,&quot;B....but what will I do?&quot;<br />
<br />
The minotaur Evan nurtured then stepped forward,&quot;Whatever I want, and need from you slave.&quot; The minotaur then looked at the captain and said,&quot;I can take it from here now captain. She won’t be an issue for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Knowing you, I will allow this, but she must be off the premises by nightfall.&quot; The captain said and then he left Evan in the room with the minotaur, alone.<br />
<br />
The minotaur just stood there and stared at Evan for a few minutes without movement. Evan looked up into the minotaur&#39;s eyes and she could tell that he has been through a lot since she last saw him, and she could tell by his expression that every one of his scars had a story to it. The minotaur then took a deep breath and said,&quot;You may stand, speak freely, and come to me now slave.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan paused and nodded to him hesitantly a bit confused as to what was going on with the minotaur and why he had returned. It took Evan awhile to get herself up on her hooves as she held her gut and udder in one hand and used the other to steady herself using the table. The minotaur even gave Evan a slightly concerned look and asked,&quot;Do you need help?&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan looked up and shook her head then rushed over to him and began to examine the minotaur&#39;s scars looking worried. &quot;What happened to you? Your body is all torn up, but.....you’re okay.&quot; Evan said then tears began forming in her eyes and she hugged the minotaur as tightly as she could.<br />
<br />
A small grin appeared on the minotaur&#39;s face and he smiled and hugged Evan back gently. &quot;Let’s just say that I owe you more than I know. By the way my name is Bovran if you haven’t heard by now.&quot; Bovran explained then he asked, &quot;Tell me, what have you been up to since I left? I see your breasts and udder are larger, and also a cute little bulge in your belly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan giggled as her breasts and udder jiggled, and Bovran was indeed correct. Evan’s breasts were now very firm F cups and her udder was now the size of a plump pumpkin. &quot;I&#39;ve been feeding little ones like you used to be when we met. I’m glad you grew up so fast, because without you I wouldn’t be carrying twins.&quot; Evan laughed and she kissed the minotaur on the chest as she was too small to reach up to his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Twins huh? Well that’s surprising, almost as much as much as your masculinity.&quot; Bovran asked and he kissed Evan on the forehead then she laughed and said,&quot;They surprised me too, but that was all you dear. That masculinity was only holding me back from my true self anyways, and I’m glad it’s gone now. Besides I prefer having a large set of jugs to milk then a couple of cumming balls anyways.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bovran laughed at this and said,&quot;Well, I know that breasts are much easier to turn you on with than balls. But anyways, we’re getting sidetracked now.&quot; Evan heard this then she looked up at Bovran and she gave him a puzzled look.<br />
<br />
Bovran then knelt down and said,&quot;I almost died two weeks ago, by throwing myself in front of a serpent in order to protect our allies. I am told that the beast was killed, but my body is now too broken for war. So I was given a home, and a salary paid to me weekly, but I traded half of my salary for something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bovran then took Evan’s hand and place his other on her back and pulled her close into a hug. &quot;That something else, is you, and now you are my personal slave, no longer a breeder.&quot; Bovran exclaimed as he hugged Evan and she blushed and she began to cry over his shoulder. &quot;Oh Bovran, I knew you were a special boy the moment you latched onto my nipple. You don’t know how much I think about you when I wake up with this swollen belly of mine!&quot; Evan cried and Bovran smiled and patted her on the back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Touching, before I almost died my life flashed before my eyes, and the first thing I saw was you.&quot; Bovran said and Evan smiled and hugged him as tighter. Her breasts and udder squished up against his body and she didn’t even care now. &quot;I trust that you are good at performing normal housework, am I wrong?&quot; Bovran asked<br />
<br />
Evan shook her head and wiped her tears and said,&quot;No, *sniff* it’s all I&#39;ve been doing here besides feeding calves. I’m not sure how I will fare when the calves are do, but honestly it’s....it&#39;s astounding that I can see you again.&quot; Evan kissed Bovran on the cheek now that his face was about level with hers, and he smiled at her and said,&quot;You were always a bit clingy weren’t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you remembered me, and you’re here now aren’t you Master Bovran?&quot; Evan asked and Bovran nodded to her and said,&quot;Heh, that’s just my mind being stubborn thanks to your masculinity. Now come, I think you&#39;ll like the new home. Also, your obedience is enough to satisfy, so drop the title, uh...heh, I don’t even know your name.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan paused and she tried to recall her name and replied,&quot;I...believe my name was...male, and.....it had an E in it. Everything is all fuzzy from back then though.&quot; Bovran nodded and he put his hand on Evan’s shoulder and said,&quot;Don’t bother then, I&#39;ll come up with something for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan nodded to Bovran and as their hands were locked with one another Bovran began guiding her through the palace, and the view was nostalgic for her considering she hadn’t come out of her chambers since Bovran had left her alone. The guards watched as he left with Evan and the two of them just casually walked through the palace until they eventually reached a large set of doors that the guards opened for the two to leave.<br />
<br />
When the door opened Evan saw true sunlight for the first time in three months and she needed to shield her eyes for a few moment before her eyes adjusted. Bovran saw this and continued walking with her along a brick road through a courtyard filled with all sorts of beautiful flowers, and then through a gateway that served as a checkpoint, and into a village.<br />
<br />
The village was large, and it had lots of minotaurs, but the only ones who were there were male. There were other creatures roaming around too such as centaur, harpys, kobolds, and much more, but the town was dominantly male minotaurs. Of course this meant that Evan got a lot of looks, not because she was nude, but because she was the only female who was outside of the palace. Evan felt flattered, honored, but a bit embarrassed because of all of the looks from certain other races that understood little of minotaur culture.<br />
<br />
Eventually Bovran took Evan up to a large cottage on the side of the street and he opened a heavy wooden door for her, and guided her inside. Bovran shut the door behind him and locked it then he looked at Evan and asked,&quot;Do you like it?&quot;<br />
<br />
The cottage looked like what one would imagine a medieval cottage to look like. There were weapons in one corner on display, a full suit of armor on another side, and it overall the walls were either decorated with the heads of beasts on plaques. Overall this was definitely the home of a male minotaur who was prideful about his career as a warrior, and Evan knew that Bovran was just that kind of minotaur.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would say lovely, but I&#39;d be afraid of offending your pride. This is beyond impressive, and I think it shows off just how manly you can be.&quot; Evan said cuddling up to Bovran&#39;s side and caressing his abs seductively.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;ve heard news of my feats then? I didn’t think you would get word considering your position then.&quot; Bovran exclaimed then Evan shook her head and said,&quot;Who do you think these calves belong to? Don’t you think that I forgot how you hoisted me up on that cock of yours, and all I could do fall down, and let that long and throbbing cock take me on a trip.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bovran paused then he smiled and said,&quot;Judging by that I&#39;d say someone missed me more than what they let on. Should I take you upstairs and remind you about what you did for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I want to see how much better you&#39;ve gotten since we last had fun together.&quot; Evan said seductively with a sly grin across her face. Bovran nodded to her and then he....</p>
