<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Fixer had been a qualified scientist who had a degree in bio nano-robotics  been working with DNA in the field of fish and aquaculture. She found that working for criminals was more lucrative and she was careful with whom she did business. She would only accept cash and working through third parties to receive payment and dispense her TG cocktails. She had a warning that these disguises should only be used two to three times. Changing a person&#39;s DNA had side effects that even the leading scientists didn&#39;t know about. She had passed this warning onto Charlie but he had been desperate to get out of the country. He was facing twenty five years for his white collar crimes.<br />
<br />
The near miss at the airport had been the sixth time he had transformed into Charlene for the purposes of escape. The last episode with that lesbian FBI agent had not only made him stay as Charlene longer than he had hoped, but also left high amounts of estrogen in his body that would not easily pass from his body. He was in conference with his attorney and the US DA negotiating a sentence when his nipples felt hard, he brushed them with his elbow and they sent a shiver of pleasure straight to his brain, making his cock fatten with blood. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck no.&quot; he breathed, sweating like he was in a sauna.<br />
<br />
His attorney knew about his attempts to leave the country as Charlene. He asked for a break as Charlie burst out of the conference room and ran to the disable toilet, which was also unisex, as he found excessive fat being drained from his male body and poured into his chest.  He felt his nipples pop out. Pushing into the fabric of his business shirt. He felt his growing breasts as they became A cups and giggled. Charlene was taking over his body. He felt tingling across his chest as his upper chest became hairless and his arms started to loose muscle mass. Her budding breasts were puffy but started expanding as she was struck with a desire to cry. <br />
<br />
The pain of what felt like her nipples being pulled out with tweezers was hurting her so badly that she just wanted to cry. Looking down she felt them expand in her shirt, that was now loose around her shoulders. Her tits pushed into the shirt as she took off her tie and undid the buttons. Her tits swelled bigger than before, leaving a V of cleavage which left her hypnotized. The two brownish orbs pushed into the fabric of her shirt, pulling it loose from her pants. Her teardrop breasts clung to the shirt, leaving nothing to the imagination. Her sensitive nipples pushed into the fabric almost making her orgasm. Hair was now down to her shoulders. She cupped them and they felt warm, a part of her. Not something to be hated and she was absolutely gorgeous. NO I AM A MAN! A voice echoed in his head.<br />
<br />
She reached for her hairless cock and felt it starting to shrink, knowing that she was rapidly becoming Charlene she focused on the fact that she was a man. He started to jack off, at first it was like trying to light a fire with a wet match. But slowly the deformed cock remembered what its purpose was and blood started to fatten it as he started to think about all the highlights of his male life, athletic competitions, the woman that he had known and seduced. He thought not about being a woman but what he did to them. He held an image in his head as he second girlfriend Alex, who was fat and ugly, allowed him to do things that no other woman would. He remembered putting her across his knees and spanking her ass with a school ruler, jacking off between her tits and into her face. The desperate urge with which she gave blowjobs.<br />
<br />
This masculinity slowly but surely pushed back the Charlene in his DNA as his limp cock blew its load.<br />
<br />
 His breasts deflated, his cock matured and became hairy. His chest bulked up and his tits reverted back to toned pecs. Reaching inside his shaving kit he used safety razor to cut his hair back to something approaching what it normally was. As he sat down with his attorney. The ADA for the US government made a note on his iPad about the changed appearance. Special Agent Matthews would want to know about about this.</p>
