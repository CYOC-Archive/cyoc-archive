<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You sighed again and went back to work hoping that David would leave. Eventually he said, &quot;Well you get both now. That's good news for me. I'll be able to get my turn back and the promotion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm the one that deserves the promotion,&quot; David said an angry tone to his voice. &quot;I've been here longer than you have.&quot; He smiled wickedly and continued, &quot;But now that isn't a problem. When I'm done you won't be working here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that a threat?&quot; you asked starting to get angry. You didn't like being threatened.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's just the way it will be,&quot; David said. &quot;Now for your transform...&quot; he trailed off looking at your screen. With a smile he continued, &quot;For you transform you will be an eight year old girl named Cassandra May or Cassie as any friends will call you. You will always be an eight year old girl never aging. Since you don't have any family here you will either become a member of a family in Glendale or you'll be in the Glendale Orphanage. You'll have another form, that of a living glass eight year old girl with the ability to move and speak. In that form you can walk through any mirror or other reflective surface, no matter it's size as long as it reflects an image, into the mirror world. When you pass into the mirror world you'll turn into flesh and blood again. In the outside world as your glass form you can be shattered or melted or damaged in anyway and you will reform and be whole. You also won't have any physical needs in your glass form but you will have physical needs in the mirror world. In your glass form you can travel between mirrors in three steps once you've decided to go to a mirror. You have to be in the mirror world in order to do this. You can take other people into and out of mirrors with you. Your glass form only wears a bikini suitable for an eight year old girl both in the outside world and in the mirror world. When you change form in the outside world any clothes you're wearing will disappear to be replaced with the bikini when you become your glass form and will reappear replacing the bikini when you change back into your flesh and blood form outside of the mirror world. When you're in the mirror world and you appear in a mirror people will see you as a ghostly reflection. The only way you'll die is if you kill yourself. If you're in danger of being physically hurt you will become your glass form whether you want to or not. The only way you won't be transformed into your glass form if you're going to be physically hurt is if you do it yourself. If someone asks you &quot;Transform or dare?&quot; they will not be able to transform you for your form and mind will be locked. Everyone will remember the old you and accept the new you seeing it as perfectly normal. Your transformation will occur ten minutes after I give you your dare. This is your transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you done?&quot; you asked rolling your eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I still have your dare to give you,&quot; David said with a smile. &quot;I'm sure you'll love it.&quot; A pause and the he continued, &quot;For your dare you'll ask me &quot;Transform or dare?&quot;. Also no one can dare you to either hurt or kill yourself. This is your dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Dave,&quot; you began saying unable to help yourself or stop. &quot;Transform or dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll choose dare,&quot; David said with a smile.<br />
<br />
You didn't know if the power of the transform was real but you knew the power of the dare was real. David seemed to put all his thought into your transformation and didn't see the loophole he left you. You intended to use it to make sure he transformed too. With a smile you said, &quot;Ok Dave. For your dare you'll ask me &quot;Transform or dare?&quot; immediately when I'm done talking. When I say dare you'll dare me to ask you &quot;Transform or dare?&quot; and immediately say transform when I ask. Once you answer transform you will not be able to ask anyone &quot;Transform or dare?&quot; without my permission. This is your dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
David had gone pale when he heard the dare. Evidently he thought you were going to give him a harmless dare. &quot;Rick,&quot; he said slowly evidently trying to fight it. &quot;Transform or dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll choose dare,&quot; you said smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I dare you to ask me &quot;Transform or dare?&quot; David said still trying to fight it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dave,&quot; you said not fighting it, &quot;Transform or dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tran... tran... transform,&quot; David had said doing his best to not answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Dave I have something special in mind for you since you're turning me into a girl,&quot; you said smiling. You had been thinking about what to do to him since finding out you'd be an eight year old girl. Taking a breath you said, &quot;For your transform you shall become my doll. You will be a living porcelain doll of an eight year old girl capable of moving and speaking. You'll be wearing a pink dress and pink shoes. Your hair will be curly and worn loose. You can not be broken or damaged in any way. You will have no physical needs except for sleep and you'll sleep when I do. If we're separated for more than three days you'll be able to travel through the mirror world to find me but your form will not change. Your name will be Alexia and that's what everyone will call you. People will remember you as you were but will accept the new you and consider it normal. If someone asks you &quot;Transform or dare?&quot; they will not be able to transform your mind or body as they are locked. You will transform at the same time as I do. This is your transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as you were done David turned and ran as fast as he could. &quot;You can't run now,&quot; Julie Halber called out after him. &quot;Your fate is sealed.&quot; She looked at you and said, &quot;It's been nice working with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I really going to be a girl?&quot; you asked still not sure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunately you will be what Dave said you will be,&quot; Julie said hugging you. &quot;There's one good thing. At least you're not going to be a piece of art in the art gallery.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;People have ended up there?&quot; you asked thinking of the times you had went there since moving to Glendale.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes,&quot; Julie said. &quot;Maybe I'll get a change to take you and show you those that have been transformed to be there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How will you do that?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well maybe you'll become my daughter,&quot; Julie said. &quot;If you end up in the orphanage though I'll adopt you. I'm going to stay here and hold you while you transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; you said feeling grateful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just try not to scream too much,&quot; Julie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Scream?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The transformations are often painful unless it's specified that there won't be any pain,&quot; Julie said. &quot;You'll probably experience pain going from flesh and blood to glass and back. I hope not.&quot;<br />
<br />
You hoped not too but there wasn't anything you could do about it. You just sat there in Julie's arms thinking about what your life was going to be like. After a few minutes you felt a twinge go through you and Julie tightened her grip saying, &quot;It's starting.&quot;<br />
<br />
No sooner had the words left her mouth then your body was flooded with pain. You couldn't help but scream which brought Wally Hammond running. He was the one that ran this operation. He had to shout to be heard over your screams and he asked, &quot;WHY IS HE SCREAMING?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;DAVE ASKED HIM THE QUESTION,&quot; Julie said as you started shrinking. &quot;HE DIDN'T WANT RICK TO GET THE PROMOTION SO HE DECIDED TO MAKE HIM AN EIGHT YEAR OLD GIRL.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'LL FIRE HIM,&quot; Willy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;RICK ALREADY GOT HIM WITH A TRANSFORM,&quot; Julie said as you continued to shrink.<br />
<br />
You had been five foot eight and you where shrinking. You passed five foot by the time Julie had said you had got back at David. You didn't stop shrinking though as you quickly approached four foot. After four foot your shrinking slowed and then stopped as you reached three foot eleven. The pain lessened then. Your body had stayed in proportion as you had shrunk so your clothes were now hanging loose on you. Your shoes had fallen off and taken your socks with them. The pain shot up again as all the hair you had grown with puberty retracted back in. Then your felt even more pain in your groin as you penis shrank and your balls retracted into your body. Your ballsack and the skin around it formed the lips of your new sex as the vaginal canal, cervix, and womb formed. Soon your penis had changed into a clitoris and your balls had changed into ovaries. Your fallopian tubes formed and you were a girl where it counted. Your body softened a bit while your face rearranged to look more like a girl's face. You felt like someone was yanking your hair as it grew longer to mid-back. Finally the pain stopped and you sat there panting. You could feel someone holding you but you didn't know who it was or where you were. You were afraid that you were in the orphanage. You took a breath and opened your eyes to see where you were.</p>
