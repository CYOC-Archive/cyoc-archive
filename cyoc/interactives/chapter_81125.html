<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake didn't want to take the risk of leaving Matt alone with the clock for any longer. Looking at his watch, <br />
he'd been in there for over half an hour now. It could take another half an hour to talk to the man in the <br />
clock shop by which point he could of died of old age. The morbid thought made him laugh, a man aging to death <br />
in an hour. It sounded so surreal and yet they were faced with the reality! He entered the house and called <br />
out for Matt. He swung open the door to the living room to see he wasn't in there, and neither was the clock. <br />
Confused, he called out again. Then Jake heard a faint grunt coming from the kitchen. He opened the door and <br />
was surprised to find an old man in there. He was even more overweight than himself, and coated in thick <br />
greying hair. He was completely nude, but his rolls of fat covered any undesirable views. His hair was almost <br />
completely gone, some strands still clung to the top in thin patches. He wasn't gone that long, was he? &quot;Is <br />
that you Matt?&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man gave another grunt in reply and added &quot;Of course its me. Who were you expecting, Santa?&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it's not too far off given your belly... How old are you now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you earlier I'm 54 years old&quot;. <br />
<br />
Jake frowned at the response. Earlier? That meant the clock was in the room and still working. Luckily he was <br />
stood out of the room. &quot;Don't you think it's time to turn the clock off now?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Matt looked confused before saying &quot;What do you mean clock? I haven't seen a clock round here at all&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean you don't know where you left the clock? But it's obviously in the room with you! Get out before you <br />
get any older!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not making any sense, son. I'll get out when I'm good and ready to!&quot;. Matt got back to eating his <br />
pizza, and Jake thought he could see the man's belly grow. He didn't want to go into the room because Matt had <br />
obviously left the clock on its highest setting, but he also didn't want to leave his friend in this <br />
condition. He sighed and forced himself into the room, looking everywhere he thought his friend could of left <br />
it, turning the timer on on his watch so he knew just how old he was getting. Jake looked through cabinets and <br />
drawers and boxes as quick as he could. 5 minutes in, he still had no clue where it could be. He was getting <br />
exasperated, knowing every minute he would be a year older. Matt had finished his pizza now and watched his 50 <br />
year old friend looking for something. &quot;Hey, what is it you're looking for again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake turned to Matt, who looked every bit as 60 as he could, and said &quot;I'm looking for that clock you seemed <br />
to have lost&quot;.<br />
<br />
Matt thought about it and said &quot;Oh, that clock! I think I remember holding it while making the pizza, but I <br />
don't know what happened to it&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I just hope you haven't eaten it, which is sadly quite possible&quot;. <br />
<br />
Matt looked his down at his belly, a bit upset. Sure he was very overweight, but he didn't have to be so <br />
cruel. &quot;Fine, I was going to help but now I don't want to&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jake got back to looking until he'd searched every single place he could think of. He'd even looked in the <br />
refrigerator and the oven in case Matt had misplaced it while making food. He looked at his timer, and 15 <br />
minutes had passed since he'd entered the room. His new clothes were now tight, his larger stomach stretching <br />
his shirt. All his hair was white and he felt a vague ache in his legs, but that sort of thing happened now <br />
that he was 60. He looked over at Matt who had fallen asleep in his chair, his face was well aged, a long <br />
white beard stretched down to his saggy man-tits. His belly was swollen and veins were visible. He had liver <br />
spots all over his wrinkled hands and smooth scalp. Why did his 70 year old friend have to lose the clock? He <br />
went over to wake the old man who started up a coughing fit before glaring at Jake. &quot;Why'd ya wake me? I was <br />
having a weird dream where I was a kid who suddenly grew old&quot;. <br />
<br />
Jake didn't have the heart to tell him it was real, putting an arm around the man's shoulder and lifting him <br />
up to take him out of the room. Matt didn't protest at all. It was then that Jake saw it. Matt was sitting on <br />
the clock this whole time! It still looked intact as well. He dropped the fat man on the floor, who groaned in <br />
pain, and grabbed the clock, fumbling with the back until he heard a click. The clock was off. He could feel <br />
his memories come back to him as he realised how much he'd aged. He joined the man on the floor in groaning, <br />
he was the oldest person in his family now! Matt hadn't faired any better, fearing he'd broken his back from <br />
the fall. It took longer for him to remember what had happened, but he was now in a state of shock. After a <br />
long period of silence, Matt looked at Jake and said &quot;Where did you get the clothes from?&quot;. His voice sounded <br />
hoarse and ancient.<br />
<br />
Jake replied &quot;Well you see, on my way to the clock shop, my neighbour stopped me and asked if I wanted any <br />
clothes. He gave me some, and then some food, and I still haven't gone to the clock shop yet. Oh don't look so <br />
shocked, you left me for the same reason! At least I came back before going to the shop or you'd still be in <br />
here getting older. How could you not even feel that clock under your ass?&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt was too tired to argue. He just wanted to go to sleep but his back was keeping him alert. Now he knew how <br />
his granddad felt whenever he woke him up. It was a terrible feeling. &quot;Well can't you just take the clock to <br />
the shop now? I'll just stay here and rest&quot;. Jake just nodded and helped his friend onto the sofa before <br />
leaving, and Matt fell asleep.<br />
<br />
Jake looked about to make sure Graham wasn't out again and walked to the shop, trying to ignore the pain he <br />
felt in his right leg with every step. It wasn't long before he reached the shop and entered, the sound of <br />
ticking everywhere. The man who served him yesterday was at the counter again. He walked up to him and said <br />
&quot;Excuse me, I purchased this clock from you the other day and I need some help with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, not able to set the time yourself? Don't worry you just take this little knob and turn...&quot; he paused, <br />
realising exactly what clock this was and then looked at the 60 year old man in front of him. He still had <br />
those young eyes. &quot;Oh my, you used the aging function on this clock? Didn't I warn you not to go too far with <br />
that? Now look, you could be my older brother now if we were related. Didn't you think things through?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake shrunk back at the man's harsh words before stammering &quot;I'm sorry, I wasn't paying attention to your <br />
warnings because I thought I already knew how to work a clock, I didn't even think it could age someone. I <br />
know it my fault I'm 50 years older now, but it's not just me, my friend's also been affected and he's 70 <br />
years old now! Surely there's a way we can get younger. Anything. I don't want to be a grandfather yet&quot;.<br />
<br />
The shopkeeper thought it through and said &quot;I'm sorry sir, but there's nothing you can do with the clock to <br />
make you younger. It only ages you. The effects are normally temporary, but the more you use it, you run into <br />
the risk of the changes becoming permanent, especially from doing something like gaining 50 years in a few <br />
hours. You both will just have to hope that you'll be younger by tomorrow morning, or else I know of a nice <br />
retirement home nearby&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jake was depressed at the news, he could be an old man for the rest of his life, which was now severely <br />
shortened. Matt was even worse for wear, he already looked gravely ill. He might not even make it to the end <br />
of the year. &quot;Well isn't there another clock or gizmo that could help us both?&quot;.</p>
