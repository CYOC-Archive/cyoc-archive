<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny and Harry carefully looked to the small book that Keiko Tachibana had produced from her purse. Both could easily see a series of notes which came from both their conversations with Akane concerning the wedding and even with some of the other people who had come to represent the services that wanted to handle things like catering and so forth. Jenny even remembered that one man came right up to her dorm room to help provide for the wedding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, from the notes that I have, you want this to be a fairly simple wedding?&quot; Keiko asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;Nothing too extravagant.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry nodded in agreement to that.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you wish to have the ceremony at the local baptist church?&quot; Keiko asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, as some measure of appeasing my parents,&quot; Jenny nodded, &quot;though... we&#39;ve agreed to do a few things to make sure that if they do cause trouble... what they interrupt won&#39;t be the REAL ceremony.&quot;<br />
<br />
This related to the double ceremony that the Twists had offered. The first one would be early, before her family arrived and the second would be later after her family arrived. The principle reason for this was the strict and to a great degree controlling attitudes that both her parents had taken in rearing her and her siblings. She got along well with her older brother, and at times he seemed to try and shield the rest of the Harper children from whatever beating her father or even her mother decided on. She did okay with her younger brother, but he often seemed to be in a sort of fantasy world, where online games/video games which were usually borrowed or the occasional comic was his escape. She also got along very well with her younger sister, who looked up to her, but the relatively good relations she had with her siblings was over-shadowed by her parents, and that could be a real problem. Especially since her father kept thinking that Dieter Wilhelm would actually help get the Harper family out of poverty.<br />
<br />
But despite all the potential trouble, they were still her family. The did deserve to know that she had found happiness, and there was the off chance that her father would see her happy, see what a good place Moon Lake was, see that she had the support of the town&#39;s residents, and at least back off if not accepting her decision. Even if that didn&#39;t happen, the fact that they were family was enough to give them the right to know. They were, of course, family, which couldn&#39;t be changed, regardless of their differences. She would have a new family, potentially even with Mr. Anderson and his family filling in for her own parents&#39; role if things truly went south, but all of that was still to be determined.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... the issue with things being difficult,&quot; Keiko said slowly and calmly, as though nothing Jenny had said was a surprise. &quot;This should all be easily handled, will you wish to handle the schedule personally, or would you like help?&quot;<br />
<br />
That made Jenny pause and look to Harry and then to Lisa. She was a bit conflicted here, as she still had her sessions with Dr. Twist for therapy and so on, which already cut into her school schedule as it was. They&#39;d done a good job of getting around classes, but they did have some issues that related to the number of hours in the day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you let us know when you have things arranged?&quot; Lisa asked, sensing Jenny&#39;s mental confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Keiko nodded, &quot;the major part of all this planning is to make sure that the ceremony... or ceremonies in this case... are to the bride and groom&#39;s pleasure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then it may be best to let you handle some of the grunt work and let us know,&quot; Harry commented, &quot;Jenny still has some therapy appointments and we both still have college. We don&#39;t have a lot of time... and that crook yesterday took away a lot of the time that Jenny and I had to do a lot of the work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My eldest son and his cousins will be doing their best with the police to insure that that does not happen again or that whatever troubles that my come do not come until you are ready to face them,&quot; Keiko assured both Harry and Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jenny gave a smile and actually hugged Keiko. The other werevixen&#39;s comments reinforced much of Jenny&#39;s feelings of real acceptance in Moon Lake, and that made her feel good.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is no problem,&quot; Keiko gave a smile, &quot;Though the big thing we will have to discuss will relate to things like the reception and the flowers. Do you have any particulars?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The reception should be fairly simple,&quot; Harry commented, &quot;just so long as there is enough for the full guest list.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have it yet, dear?&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet,&quot; Jenny admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Keiko commented, &quot;I can talk with the caterers. They tend to do a lot of this sort of business with the Skulk&#39;s official meetings. So, we should be fine, but if you can get at least a good guess at the number of guests by Wednesday, we should be good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny and Harry nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;What would like for entrees and sides?&quot; Keiko asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ham?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about roast beef?&quot; Harry countered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not go with both, they can go good with mashed potatoes,&quot; Lisa commented, &quot;that&#39;d then give people a choice to select from.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry and Jenny blinked and then nodded, saying that that wasn&#39;t a bad idea. Keiko simply wrote down some notes while the rest moved on to the sides.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d assume potatoes for one side...&quot; Jenny commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mashed would go with ham and roast beef,&quot; Harry commented, to which Jenny nodded, &quot;the next thing would simply some fruit sides... either slices or chopped. Whichever is more affordable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Apple slices would be nice,&quot; Jenny mused.<br />
<br />
&quot;We do get very good apples delivered,&quot; Keiko commented with a smile, &quot;Is there any specifics for drinks?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A selection of water, iced tea, fruit punch, and some soda should be fine,&quot; Harry commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coca-Cola for the soda,&quot; Jenny specified.<br />
<br />
Keiko nodded and wrote that down in her notes. She then looked over some things.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the cake?&quot; Keiko asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was actually thinking...&quot; Jenny began, &quot;Could you make it so that it has the image of a mundane gray fox and a mundane fennec fox together on the top... so it&#39;d represent both Harry and me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can do that,&quot; Keiko commented, &quot;a bit atypical for a wedding, but we can...&quot;<br />
<br />
Keiko looked to Harry, who was seated quietly. He blinked when he noticed all eyes were on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;If it&#39;s a small image on the top of the cake, I suppose that wouldn&#39;t be too bad,&quot; Harry commented, and glanced to Jenny and his mother, &quot;What do you think would work best for flavor? Chocolate or vanilla?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been partial to half and half,&quot; Lisa commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about a swirl?&quot; Jenny asked, &quot;chocolate and vanilla mixed together. Like a marble cake...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s actually quite good,&quot; Keiko commented, &quot;though if someone is allergic to one or the other... not likely in Moon Lake, as we weres tend to have few allergies that are common among normals... but if you have family coming from outside Moon Lake...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My family has no food allergies that I know of,&quot; Jenny commented, &quot;other than maybe my parents being allergic to buying anything that wasn&#39;t marked down or close to its expiration date.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Marble style it is then,&quot; Harry commented.<br />
<br />
Keiko nodded and looked over her notes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Any choice for music?&quot; Keiko wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;That we&#39;ll need to talk about,&quot; Jenny commented, as she looked to Harry.<br />
<br />
Keiko again nodded, &quot;and the flowers?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;ll be happy with however you place them,&quot; Jenny commented, &quot;but with the reception... I was thinking one small vase per table.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keiko nodded and then asked, &quot;any choice of flower or color?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It might be easier to go with what is the most available,&quot; Lisa commented, &quot;some greenhouses may be open all year, but with the summer over and winter not THAT far away, it&#39;s likely that their stocks will be low.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry and Jenny paused and then nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think would be best?&quot; Jenny asked to Keiko.<br />
<br />
&quot;My first choice?&quot; Keiko mused and thought back to when Tora married her, &quot;my first choice would be under a soft showering of cherry blossoms... but it would be a bit late in the year to even arrange for that. The easiest we could do would be with some roses, and in a small vase, that&#39;d be four flowers per table.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you like roses?&quot; Lisa asked to Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;d be nice,&quot; Jenny commented, &quot;maybe mix them... some red, some pink. What do you think, Harry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So long as they smell nice and you&#39;re happy,&quot; Harry smiled to his fiance, &quot;I don&#39;t care on what kind of roses you get.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We will make sure they are fresh, do not worry,&quot; Keiko promised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then red and pink it is,&quot; Harry commented with a smile to Jenny. Jenny only smiled back.</p>
