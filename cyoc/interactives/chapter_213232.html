<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Waking up the next morning, Jeff felt a pleasurable feeling down in his groin. It took him a few moments to realize what it was. His eye shot open to see a massive tent in his sheets, pointing straight up. Throwing off his sheets, he sees his wolf boner just as his knot is released from his sheath. <br />
<br />
Quickly, he runs to his attached bathroom, feeling the pressure in his balls build up. As moving, he notices, but is not able to think about, how his penis was the only thing to change overnight. Reaching his walk-in shower, he grabs his massive member and starts stroking, trying to get his release as soon as possible. Rubbing his hands up and down the massive red rocket, Jeff feels sensations he had never felt before. His body felt like it was on fire with pleasure with each stroke. And he was using both hands! <br />
<br />
But as quickly as it seemed to begin, it was over. Jeff grunts as his penis erupts into the corner of the shower with his seed. Jeff does his best to keep it to the corner, while not back splashing onto himself or the floor. He didn’t want to clean up more than needed, or give his mom another chance to find him in a awkward situation. <br />
<br />
As his hose died down, Jeff catches his breath as he finally processes that his groin was the only part of him that changed. Jeff tried to think if he dreamed anything the night before, but he couldn’t remember. So, he tossed it up to just tossed it up to normal morning wood combined with him sleeping in the nude, both being something he didn’t normally do. <br />
<br />
Jeff cleans himself off before focusing on changing back. Just like the night before, it seemed to take a bit, but soon he was back to human… well, mostly. <br />
<br />
Jeff looks at his human form well for the first time in the mirror of his bathroom. The night before, his mother had wrapped him in a blanket before he could see, but now Jeff saw other changes being a werewolf had done to him. <br />
<br />
Jeff was by no means a fit teen. He wasn’t fat either, but he wasn’t going to be picked for any sports, nevertheless. That is why he went into computers programs when he entered high school a few months back. But now, Jeff was lean. He was sporting a small six pack and could see the outline of his muscles under his skin. It wasn’t enough of a change that people would be able to tell when he was dressed, but it was a large change never the less. Jeff felt stronger too. He flexed his muscles, seeing how they grew. He figured that if he ever goes swimming at the school pool, he wasn’t going to be picked on. <br />
<br />
And then there was his cock. Now he could call it a cock, and not the small three incher that was there before. He knew once again that the three inches was nothing to scoff at, and that he was still growing, but now he sported what he thought was a four and a half incher that was twice as thick as before. Just from the shear thickness, he was impressed. Becoming a werewolf seemed to be a great decision, even if it was partly accidental.<br />
<br />
Hearing his mother call for him brought him out of his daze. “Jeff? Are you up?” She called. <br />
<br />
“Going to the bathroom!” Jeff called back. <br />
<br />
“Okay, Breakfast will be a minute. The stove went out again, so I am tossing everything on the grill outside. You should have time to take a shower before the eggs and bacon are done.” His mother replies before adding. “Was everything alright this morning?” <br />
<br />
Jeff knew instantly what she was talking about. “Yes mom!” He replied in a half lie. He wasn’t going to mention the “dog wood” but being in his new stronger body was definitely an improvement in his mind. <br />
<br />
“Okay, Susan’s mom text saying that she will be over here soon too. She apparently left her phone at home before she started walking over. So be out before then.” His mother says before walking off. <br />
<br />
Jeff, now in a hurry, turns the show on and starts to wash off all of the seed from the wall. He definitely didn’t want Susan to see all of that. She may be his best friend and a fellow nerd, but he didn’t want to have to explain that he was now a werewolf unless he had too. <br />
<br />
As Jeff hopped into the show, he started thinking about his relationship with Susan. She moved in a few streets over back in elementary school. Like him, she was in introvert, mainly just reading books in the library at recess. Jeff would always ask to library as well, but to play on the computers. One day, the librarian paired them up at a table because she was “cleaning” the library. That was when he and Susan realized they liked some of the same things. Jeff was watching an anima on the computer as Susan was reading the manga. After that, they would always pair off at recess to watch and read together. <br />
<br />
That was what they were going to be working on as well with Susan coming over. For their English Lit class, they were tasked with writing a paper about the differences between the video version and the written version of the same story. They decided to use “By The Grace of the Gods” since it was still being made both via book and anima. <br />
<br />
As Jeff got out of the shower, he heard a knock at the door. “Jeff? You out yet.” <br />
<br />
It was Susan. She was punctual if anything. <br />
<br />
“Just got out of the shower?” Jeff replied, double checking the door’s lock. It was still locked from last night. <br />
<br />
“Okay, your mom says that food will be ready soon and if we like, we can eat in your room while we work on the paper. Just unlock the door when you are dress.” Susan yells before Jeff hears her walk off. <br />
<br />
Jeff chuckles before pulling out some clothes from his dresser and closet. He tosses on some of his boxer briefs, jeans and a plan t-shirt before unlocking the door and bringing up his computer. He made sure the Chronivac app was closed so Susan wouldn’t find it and moved the hardware to the back of the computer. If anything, he could say it was cheap external memory, considering how large it was.<br />
 <br />
Just as he brings up his word files just as his door opens and Susan walks in. He looks her over as she walks in holding two plates of food and had a folding chair on her back. <br />
<br />
She was wearing a jean jacket with a sleeveless shirt underneath. She then had a skirt on with some long socks that went up to the bottom of the skirt. Her hair was light brown, that worked with her naturally tan skin. Her biggest feature, to Jeff, was her bright green eyes that he always lost in. <br />
<br />
“I see that the stove went out again. She should talk to my dad about repairing or replacing it. He does own a store you know.” Susan says as she places the on the desk and takes the folding chair off. She opens the chair and sets it up next to Jeff before walking over and closing the door, locking it behind her. “That way your sister doesn’t bug us while we work on the paper. I love her, but she needs to learn boundaries when we are doing homework.” <br />
<br />
“She needs to learn boundaries period.” Jeff replies before getting a mad stair from Susan. <br />
<br />
“She is your little sister. Don’t be so mean!” Susan says with her hands on her hips. <br />
<br />
Jeff looks at Susan dumbfounded. “Hey, you said the same thing!” <br />
<br />
“No, Is said during homework. I would love to have a sibling.” Susan replies as she takes a seat in the folding chair. <br />
<br />
Jeff shakes his head as he grabs his plate and starts to eat. “You can have her. She broke a doorknob last night and wouldn’t leave me alone trying to pass the blame.” <br />
<br />
Susan giggles as she takes her plate to eat as well. “A sister’s prerogative.” <br />
<br />
Jeff shakes his head again, “Save those big words for the paper.” He jokes as they start working on the paper while eating. <br />
<br />
About an hour later, both plates were moved to the dresser as Susan and Jeff were lost in the paper. They had gotten a large amount of work done, but their mental stamina was running low. Susan was the first to break, standing up to stretch and taking off her jean jacket. <br />
“Well, at least your heater seems to be working.” Susan says as she tosses the jacket on the pillows on Jeff’s bed. Jeff could see now clearly that the sleeveless shirt Susan was wearing was a plan woman’s undershirt. Jeff could also tell now, with the jean jacket removed, that Susan was once again not wearing a bra. <br />
<br />
“Now I know why you left your phone at home. You didn’t want your mom blowing up your phone about you not wearing a bra again. And are you complaining about the heater? You could have just worn warmer clothes.” Jeff jokes as he leans back in his seat. <br />
<br />
“Well, they are uncomfortable. Besides, I went up a size again.  Mom needs to take me to get new ones.” Susan replies in a matter-of-fact way. “And I knew your house would be warm, why wear all these clothes if I was just going to take them off.” <br />
<br />
Jeff raised an eyebrow before getting a snicker from Susan. “You know what I mean.” She replies as she takes a seat next to Jeff again. <br />
Sitting down, Jeff could see undershirt toss forward, reviling her right boob. It was nice and round already, with her areola being quite large. Jeff could feel the blood rush to his member, as his balls chirmed some from his sight. He adjusts himself and looks away before Susan realizes what she was showing off. <br />
<br />
“Always the gentlemen.” She says as she adjusts her shirt. “Hey, let&#39;s take a break and talk.” <br />
<br />
“About what?” Jeff says, still looking away but now blushing. <br />
<br />
“Us.” Susan says with seriousness. <br />
<br />
This catches Jeff off guard, and he turns his chair to face the now blushing Susan. <br />
<br />
“Jeff, we have known each other for a while. And we are good friends, right?” Susan asks softly.<br />
<br />
“Yes…” Jeff replies unsure where this is going.<br />
<br />
“And you like me, right?” Susan then asks. <br />
<br />
“Yes, you are my friend…” Jeff answers. <br />
<br />
“And we are now in high school.” Susan stops, unsure of what to say next. She Looks Jeff in the eyes as she holds her hands to her chest. <br />
<br />
“Jeff, would you…. date me?” <br />
<br />
Jeff is taken aback by the question. After becoming a werewolf, the night before, and spending the past hour working on their project, he wasn’t expecting this question. He just sat there, staring at her. Susan looks away, now ashamed by the question. Jeff, not wanting to hurt his friend, but also not knowing what to say, takes her hands. <br />
<br />
“Sorry, that was rude of me not to say anything.” He says, getting Susan to look at him again. “I don’t know what to say. But if it means this much to you, we can try. What did you have in mind?” <br />
<br />
Susan gets out of her seat and sits with Jeff in his computer chair. It was cramped, but they both fit. “I’ve just been wanting someone to hold me lately. Someone like you.” <br />
<br />
Sitting next to Jeff, his arm now around her, Susan’s undershirt is pushed over again, reviling her breast once again. This time too, her skirt is pushed up, reviling her thin panties. Jeff blushes as he feels a tent in his pants. Susan smiles seeing the tent. “Like what you see,” she asks.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think I need to answer that one.” Jeff replies softly while looking away. “You can already tell.” <br />
<br />
Susan smiles more before deciding to straddle Jeff. Jeff faces her as she adjusts her skirt before placing her hands on his bulge on his pants. She slowly starts to unzip his pants while saying, “You got to see mine, so I should be able to see my new boyfriend’s, even if it doesn’t lead to anything.” <br />
<br />
Jeff starts to pray that he didn’t start to change into a wolf as Susan parts his zipper and the opening to his underwear. Susan gasps his human four-and-a-half-inch member comes out. She wraps her hand around it, barely able to make her fingers touch. <br />
<br />
“It’s so big.” She lets slip, before releasing it. <br />
<br />
Jeff just smiles as Susan, receiving a smile back. She leans forward, rubbing her slit and panties against the erect member, as she kisses him on the lips for the first time. Susan then adjusts more in the chair, causing more rubbing between her slit and his rod, as she gets a better angle on kissing. As they release the kiss, they both have a needing look in their eyes. <br />
<br />
Susan then stands up, to Jeff surprises, before she takes off her undershirt. Jeff stands up, following suit. As they both disrobe, Susan lays down on her back on the bed, spreading her legs. Jeff starts to move to her, before a though enters his mind. <br />
<br />
Jeff recalled what the Chronivac had read. If he has sex, he will change Susan into a werewolf as well. This now gave Jeff a dilemma, does he continue and change Susan without her knowledge beforehand. Or does he stop now, risking his friendship for the secret. Before deciding, Susan sees Jeff’s mind racing from his face, and she speaks up. <br />
<br />
“If this is to soon, that is fine.” She says to him. Jeff takes a breath. With her words, there was only one decision he could make. <br />
<br />
“Susan, before we do this, I need to show you something.” Jeff says in a low voice. “Just don’t freak out.” <br />
<br />
“Never.” Susan replies, making Jeff nod. Just then focus on his tailbone, making his wolf tail come out. <br />
<br />
It was a slow process, but his tail grows in, it’s mixes brown fur growing in. Susan looks on in awe, still laying on the bed. As the tail reaches its full size, a part of it being on the floor with the rest of Jeff’s body still being human, Susan looks on in a mix of shock and amazement. <br />
<br />
“I found out last night I was a werewolf.” Jeff whispers, not wanting his mother or sister to come in on the situation. “From what I can tell, no one else in my family is one. Also, there is a chance that I can change you if this continues.” <br />
<br />
Jeff looks away before he feels a pull on his arms. Susan pulls Jeff’s arms hard enough to make him fall on top of her. His penis rests between them as his tail starts to wag behind him. <br />
<br />
“Then change me.” Susan says. “Even if we don’t work out, I don’t want to stop now do to fear of an if.” Jeff knew better but didn’t want to bring up the Chronivac. He nods as he regains his poser, preparing himself. <br />
<br />
“If I start to change more, and it hurts, just tell me. I will stop.” Jeff says as Susan nods. <br />
<br />
After that, no more words were needed. Susan grabs one breast as she moves her other hand between her legs. She opens her lips as Jeff starts rubbing his penis along them. Jeff could feel his body start to change, and just let himself turn. <br />
<br />
Susan heart starts racing as she sees Jeff’s ears start to grow to a tip, fur growing in. Jeff starts to grind harder as he places his hands on either side of Susan’s chest, just under her arms. His fingernails and toes nails start turning into claws as Susan watches his teeth begin to sharpen. Jeff’s overall body starts to bulk up, his changes faster then the night before. He could both feel and smell Susan becoming wet from their actions. <br />
<br />
As Susan watch her new boyfriend change, his body growing larger and furrier, she then feels a new weight on her groin. Susan looks down to watch Jeff’s penis change from the human one see saw a few minutes ago, to its wolf’s counterpart. <br />
<br />
The first thing she feels is his balls grow larger and hairier. They soon rest rolling back and forth between her thighs. Then, she watches and feels as Jeff’s cock start to inflate, his foreskin regrowing. Fur soon covers the skin as a sheath slowly forms. She see’s Jeff’s face twitch before noticing the sheath shifting from what was inside. Soon, a much thicker, red, vain coverer member comes out. Susan gaps as it lengthens, with only the Knot still hiding in the sheath. <br />
<br />
“Jeff?” She says softly. <br />
<br />
Jeff, his face pushed out into a muzzle, just nods his head to show he hears her. <br />
<br />
“Put it in me?” She asks as she takes the red member into her hands. <br />
<br />
Jeff acknowledges by moving his hips back to ready for a thrust. Susan, with the member in her hands, guides the tip to her opening. Jeff slowly moves his hips back forward, entering Susan. Susan gasps again, closing her eyes but smiling from the feeling. Jeff was surprised that Susan could take his new size and continue to push forward. Unknowingly, Jeff breaks Susan with ease as she stays in a silent bliss. As Jeff reaches her womb, he starts going back in forth, his balls gently hitting her between Susan’s legs. <br />
<br />
When Susan reopens her eyes, the last of Jeff’s changes take effect as he now engulfs her body form above. Susan moves her hands to bring Jeff’s head down to her as she kisses him on his wolf lips, taking breaks just to gasp for air. Jeff assumes this is from the long kisses, but Susan knew it was from her cumming with her overstimulated body. <br />
<br />
Soon, Jeff’s eyes went wide while he was pushing forward. He feels his knot slide out of his sheath and into Susan’s lips with a loud “plop”. Susan’s eyes go wide too as she is stretched to her limits. They both stop moving, as Jeff’s balls tighten and his seed is released into Susan’s waiting, but to small womb. <br />
<br />
As they hold each other tightly, Jeff releases wave on wave into Susan. He could feel her stomach inflate under him before the seed sprayed out from between them. As the torrent slows, Jeff realized he can’t pull out of Susan when he tries. Susan, for her part, places a hand on his cheek. “Please, don’t pull out. I like the feeling of you in me.” She says. <br />
<br />
“Okay.” Jeff whispers as his tail gently wags behind him and their now mixed juices start to puddle on the floor. <br />
<br />
 They stay in this embrace for an unknown amount of time, until Jeff’s knot and penis naturally return to his sheath. The two continue to hold each other, until Susan speaks up. “I guess we need to clean up.” She whispers in his ear. <br />
<br />
Jeff lets his hold of Susan go and stands up as he takes a look at her. So far, no changes from what he could tell, other then some red marks from their love. Susan sits up on the bed, still leaking cum from her legs, when she grabs her chest. <br />
<br />
“Jeff, I feel weird.” She says.</p>
