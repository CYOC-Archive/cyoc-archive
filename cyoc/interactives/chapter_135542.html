<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A steak bone clattered onto John&#39;s plate, as the anthropomorphic dragon gave a satisfied huff of hot air from his nostrils. Within minutes, the Anderson family had left their plates completely bare of any food, with only a few tiny scraps strewn about. Julie was still lapping up pieces of lettuce on the table, while Derra licked up a drop of milk from her own breasts.<br />
<br />
“Whelp. I’m famished,” quipped Sean, as the satyr leaned back on his seat. He let out an impolite burp, which had both Derra and Julie giggling.  <br />
<br />
“So, what now?” Julie asked.<br />
<br />
“Not a clue,” Sean replied. “I’m not entirely in a hurry to get our rooms yet.”<br />
<br />
“<i>Same,</i>” John growled, while he cleaned his clawed fingers with his draconic tongue. “I guess we should go to that garden there.”<br />
<br />
The family turned their heads. On the very opposite end facing where the steam room door used to be, there was a garden with numerous trees, plants, standing pillars and statues. The paths around the lawn all seemed to lead there.<br />
<br />
Sean shrugged. “I guess we’ll head there then.”<br />
<br />
Together, the family of creatures headed off, leaving the table of empty plates behind. <br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
The moment the Andersons entered the garden, the sounds of the nearby sea seemed to instantly disappear. In its place was a tranquil silence, interrupted only by the occasional calls and whistles of birds, along with the clops of Sean’s hooves. <br />
<br />
The family walked on together. The lawn&#39;s paved paths had given way to trails of neat dirt roads, though they were narrow enough to make walking side-by-side difficult for the Andersons. Sean and Derra took the lead, while John and Julie followed.<br />
<br />
“Thissss garden seems quite niiccccee.”, Derra hissed out, as she snaked past the various statuary. Next to her, Sean plucked a hanging berry from a nearby plant, and tossed it into his mouth. He admired the juicy taste, when he heard a growl from behind.<br />
<br />
“John, you alright?”, Sean asked.<br />
<br />
“<i>Full,</i>” John roughly replied. As his sphinx daughter watched, the anthropomorphic dragon went down to his clawed hands and feet, standing on all fours. His legs bulked up slightly in muscle and stared shortening up, till they were of a similar length as his arms. None of the family took much notice of this change. <br />
<br />
Finding comfort in his new position, John continued following after his family on all fours, with his large lizard tail waving about.  <br />
<br />
“Maybe the way out is down there,” said Sean, pointing his head at the end of the path. Behind the group, Julie was taking a little extra time looking at her surroundings, when a fragrant smell hit her nose. <br />
<br />
Julie looked around for its source. Her eyes landed on a bed of red roses, with a butterfly fluttering about collecting nectar. The teen sphinx smiled and pawed up close, taking in the blissful scent. It reminded her of the French perfume her mom always liked to wear.<br />
<br />
Julie blinked. Wait, mom? That’s not… <br />
<br />
The sphinx girl’s mind went blank for a moment, as if something inside was resetting itself. Julie shook her head, wondering what she was just thinking of. <br />
<br />
Smiling anyway, Julie turned to continue down the path, only to find herself facing a dead end. <br />
<br />
Julie blinked. The path ended with a thick hedge wall, with a Greek bust on a pedestal in the middle. She was so sure her family had gone through this way. <br />
<br />
“Uh, guys?”, she called out.<br />
<br />
No response. There weren&#39;t any other paths branching out from there, the sides of the trail were all surrounded by hedge walls as well.<br />
<br />
She turned around. To her further surprise, the path she had walked from was gone too. Instead, the path branched out from a rectangular open space also surrounded by hedges. All the way down was a large fountain, built against an ivy-covered stone wall. <br />
<br />
Julie eyed the strange clearing, as confusion ran through her mind.  “…weird.”<br />
<br />
She pawed forward. There weren’t any exits or doorways around the hedges, and they seemed too tall for Julie to jump out of. It seemed as if she was trapped there.<br />
<br />
It was a little concerning, but Julie took more notice of the wall fountain. She pawed up to it for a better look. <br />
<br />
The fountain was carefully carved with shapes of plants and mushrooms, some of which looked suspiciously like human genitals. The water trickled out from a hole in the top-center, located on the mouth of a detailed male lion’s head.<br />
<br />
Julie stared at the lion sculpture. She had plenty of sex with her sister and dads, but never another lion. She often wondered what it&#39;ll be like for a grown, male lion to make her his own. Even in her spare time, she&#39;d imagine that scenario in her head; his furry weight upon her body with his paws by her flanks, his large, throbbing shaft shoving into her rear...<br />
<br />
A heat started rising in her beastly nethers. She was suddenly feeling quite horny.<br />
<br />
Julie pondered, as temptation set upon her. Sure, she had to look for her dads and Derra, and she had to find a way out of here. Then again…<br />
<br />
The water from the fountain trickled on. Beyond that, there was still that muffling silence in the air, with nary a sound except for the birds.<br />
<br />
Grinning shamefully, Julie bent her neck down towards her groin, which proved quite easy with her flexible feline body. The 14 year old sphinx reached a tongue out, and dipped into her own feline vagina; lapping into it like she was drinking from a bowl of milk. When her tongue ran upon her clitoris, a pleasured buzzed through her lower body that caused Julie to let out a delighted moan. <br />
<br />
As Julie licked on, her clit started to enlarge. Though this actually surprised her, she continued, even as her clit swelled in size, and her furry labia extended out to wrap around her new appendage like a pocket. It grew so large that Julie went from licking her clit, to sucking it between her lips.<br />
<br />
Julie’s ears began moving up higher on her head as fur grew on them, while the hair on her scalp grew out rapidly and became more thick and frazzled, till she soon sported a young lion’s mane. If it weren’t for her human-like face (which still looked like that of a young teen girl), she could be easily mistaken for an adolescent male lion. <br />
<br />
As if to further add to that impression, a furry sack containing two orbs pushed out from the back end of Julie’s stretched vaginal lips. Hanging underneath, they ballooned into fully sized lion’s testicles, just as the top of her former labia attached to her belly. Her vaginal lips were now the sheath surrounding her new, sizable penis, which already started leaking cum inside of Julie’s mouth.  <br />
<br />
<i>‘Heheh…desserts,’</i>  Julie mused in her head, as the sphinx continued tasting her new maleness.</p>
