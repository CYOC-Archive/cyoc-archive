<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Yvette Smith was released from her hospital bed, only to have her hands cuffed behind her, before a Moon Lake police officer on either side of the rogue were-vixen escorted her out of her room and up to the third floor.<br />
From there, they walked down an isolated corridor that ended in front of a nondescript white door.<br />
In front of the door were Tachibana no Akane, most of her grandsons, Samantha and Frances Twist, Harry Jenkins, and a hospital security guard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Harper is waiting inside. Take as long as you need to, but you know what must be done,&quot; Akane said coldly, while staring up at the taller woman.<br />
&quot;And if Jenny doesn&#39;t come out of this alive and whole,&quot; growled Harry.<br />
Yvette looked at those gathered. While Harry might at least attempt to carry out his threat, she was more afraid of the Japanese men in the black suits, as the one in the far corner behind the others opened his jacket just long enough to expose the hilt of a sword in its sheath.<br />
Yvette gulped, before asking the officers to please remove the handcuffs as politely as she could phase the question.<br />
Then, standing in front of the door for a moment while rubbing her sore wrists, she took a deep breath and went inside.<br />
The door closed behind her with an audible click.<br />
&quot;Unlike the sunset to sunrise setting, I can open it whenever necessary,&quot; said the hospital security guard.<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Frances Twist, as Harry began to pace back and forth in the hallway. &quot;But for now, I&#39;m afraid all we can do is wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yvette stood in front of the closed door within the hospital safe room. The click sounded ominous to her, especially since someone had dimmed the room lights.<br />
As her eyes adjusted to the partial darkness, Yvette saw Jenny Harper lying on the king size bed, staring up at her.<br />
&quot;You!&quot; shouted Jenny, recognizing her from the class they shared with William Anderson. &quot;You did this to me?&quot;<br />
&quot;So?&quot; snorted Yvette. &quot;From what I&#39;ve heard, you&#39;ve got everything <i>I&#39;ve</i> wanted and deserve. The love of a good man, along with a bright and happy future together for the two of you and whatever kits you have down the road.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not if you don&#39;t finish what you started,&quot; said Jenny, as she removed her hospital gown to reveal the sexier body she now possessed as a were.<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Yvette, just standing there.<br />
&quot;By the doctor&#39;s best estimate, it&#39;s already been over 30 hours since you first clawed me. I&#39;ve been told that is <b>severely</b> long past any known safety limit for being incomplete. My life signs are starting to fade, and if we don&#39;t do it by night fall...&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Yvette, fearful of the answer.<br />
&quot;The doctors told me I could die by tomorrow morning,&quot; revealed Jenny. &quot;Then there would be a murder charge amongst everything else you&#39;re facing.&quot;<br />
Yvette broke out into a cold sweat at hearing that. &quot;I never thought... I just wanted to distract the police so I could...&quot;<br />
&quot;Hush!&quot; said Jenny, as she got off the bed and moved closer to Yvette. &quot;None of that matters right now. We just spend some nice, <i>quality</i> time together and I should be all right,&quot; she said, as her were-vixen instincts started to kick in.<br />
&quot;<i>Should be</i>?&quot; repeated Yvette, as she stared into Jenny&#39;s eyes.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m new to this, but the way it was explained to me is that no one knows if there will be any consequences, short or long term, from a prolonged, incomplete induction into were society. But for now, we just enjoy the moment and hope for the best,&quot; said Jenny, as she kissed Yvette while untying her hospital gown.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not a lesbian, or even bi,&quot; swore Yvette, as she broke the kiss and pulled away from Jenny.<br />
&quot;Neither am I. But a woman&#39;s got to do what a woman&#39;s got to do.&quot;<br />
Then, without warning, Jenny grabbed Yvette by an arm and flipped the were rogue over her shoulder.<br />
&quot;My parents were stricter than any ever had the right to be, but one thing they did teach me was how to defend myself bitch!&quot; said Jenny, as Yvette landed on the king size mattress. &quot;Now you&#39;re going to do what&#39;s necessary, or neither of us will be leaving this room alive!&quot;<br />
With that, Jenny Harper let out a low growl and jumped onto the bed on top of Yvette.<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I the only sane one in all of Moon Lake?&quot; asked Yvette, as Jenny sat on the rogue&#39;s face. An exotic wetness started dampening Yvette&#39;s lips as she felt Jenny lean forward and pry her legs open.<br />
Yvette tried to fight off Jenny Harper, but she was like a woman possessed. Jenny reached down and started tonguing Yvette&#39;s slit.<br />
Despite all her emotional and physical attempts to resist giving in, soon the rogue&#39;s body started responding, as Yvette felt herself growing damp and her clit extending to welcome the invading tongue.<br />
It was only moments later that Yvette came for the first time at the actions of another woman, but it wouldn&#39;t be the last as Jenny continued to eat her pussy.<br />
<br />
Yvette laid there, relishing the sexual and exotic feelings coursing through her body. She had been eaten before, but only by men. There was something different about the act being performed by a woman. As if only she knew the places a man wouldn&#39;t or couldn&#39;t go.<br />
The rogue&#39;s face became wetter as Jenny came, just from eating Yvette.<br />
Until now, she had just laid there, wanting it over with as soon as possible.<br />
Although she had not been an active or even willing participant, as Jenny&#39;s moisture started dripping into her mouth, Yvette couldn&#39;t help licking her lips and soon found she couldn&#39;t get enough of the taste or the liquid itself, even as Jenny&#39;s fur sprouted across her body and her were-vixen tail grew out of the crack above her butt cheeks.<br />
Having never seen a Sahara Desert Fox before, Yvette stared in awe at the exotic beauty that Jenny Harper transformed into.<br />
Feminine pheromones filled the air as Yvette assumed her were-vixen form even as the ladies continued exploring each other&#39;s bodies.<br />
Soon they started exploring and discovering the intimate pleasures only two women could share together.<br />
<br />
It was almost a full three hours after Yvette Smith was locked in that everyone outside the hospital safe room heard a knock on its lone door.<br />
Harry, having finally worn himself out from pacing, was sitting on the floor with most of the others when the guard walked over to the room&#39;s intercom panel. Only he and Akane&#39;s grandsons had remained standing the whole time. With nothing else to do, even Akane sat down on the tile floor.<br />
But now, everyone anxiously stood as the guard pressed the intercom button and said, &quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
&quot;Could you please let me out now?&quot; asked Jenny.<br />
Harry smiled and rushed to the door as the guard opened it.<br />
&quot;Oh Harry! I missed you!&quot; exclaimed Jenny, still in her furry were-vixen form, as she leapt into her fiance&#39;s arms and started kissing him.<br />
The hospital guard and the police officers entered the safe room and discovered Yvette, still in her were-vixen form, asleep on the king size bed with a smile on her muzzle.<br />
<br />
Akane and the Twists, who had peered into the room after law enforcement officials entered, just looked at one other, wondering exactly what had happened.<br />
Then, hearing a strange sound, the women turned around and were shocked to see that Jenny now had Harry pinned to the ground. She had ripped his pants open and was now riding his hardening cock even as her fiance assumed his werefox form to reach up and caress her fur covered curves and breasts with his paws.<br />
<br />
Akane&#39;s grandsons, not knowing what else to do, looked at the Skulk leader. In turn, she looked to Frances Twist. The professional therapist simply shook her head and shrugged her shoulders, not knowing what to make of this new development, as the topknot of Harry&#39;s werefox penis sank passionately into Jenny&#39;s very moist depths.</p>
