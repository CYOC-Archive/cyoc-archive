<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I wish SHE was the little one,&quot; Claudia screamed. The ring begam to glow as Katie and her friends tackled her to the ground trying to snatch the ring back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Claudia what did you do,&quot; Kellie yelled as the feisty blond now fought her friends. As they were all fighting they heard an audible gasp. Turning the girls now stared in horror at Cola and Julia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha....what&#39;s happening,&quot; Julia whispered as she stared at her hands. Julia was already in her early 20s as the girls stared dumbfoumded. The woman was rapidly approaching her teenagr years as the maturiry was wiped from her face as her breasts lost their fullness becoming perky. Cole watched as his older sister now looked like a teenager. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jules,&quot; he muttered. &quot;Claud.....wha...what did you do to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia angrily glared at her sister as she reentered high school. The 18 year old had lost the curves of adulthood. Now a tall girl with large breasts and a cute face. Julia still looked to be in shock as she rapidly raced backwards through high school. In only a few moments she was now only 15. The girl appeared to shrink ever so slightly while her curves continued to melt away. As she became 14 she gasped. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so thin,&quot; she whispered looking at her waifish waist and perky b cups. Closing her eyes in terror awful memories flooded her head. The nickname of beanpole was often directed at her at this age because of her height and skinny appearance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quick get her behind the shed,&quot; Katie called to Cole. Cole reacted quickly lifting the now 14 year old Julia up and carrying her out of view. Katie and her friends now attempted to drag Claudia behind the shed. The girl fighting the whole way while grinning maliciously at her former older sibling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not so tall and pretty now huh,&quot; Claudia sneered. Julia was still in shock as she hit 13. The girls looked on in shock as Julia shrank at least 5 inches. While still tall for a girl her age they could see her reliving the awkwardness of her early adolescence. Julia shivered again as she shrank again becoming 12. Claudia still continued to fight as she glared at the preteen, Julia was STILL probably a little taller than her sister at this age.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it weren&#39;t you ever short,&quot;Claudia spat. Julia now looked at her sister with tears in her eyes. Before she could answer she shrank again, becoming 11. Claudia grinned as most of her adult features were wiped away. The girl now stood a few inches shorter than her sister while her breasts were reduced to a pair of bumps no bigger than apples. Julia tried to say something but only squealed in fright as her shorts lost hold of her hips, falling around her ankles. <br />
<br />
Julia turned red and began to cry in embarassment as she became 10. Cole instinctive took his uniform shirt off, tying it around thw girls waist to preserve her modesty. &quot;Thhhhanks,&quot; Julia stammered as she shrank down to 9. Cole nodded before glaring at his little sister.<br />
<br />
Cole now approached Katie and her friends glowering down at them. Katie and the others shrank back while Claudia glowered at her older brother. &quot;What did you do Claud,&quot; he growled. The others trwmbled slightly while Claudia continued to glare at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s her own damn fault,&quot; she spat. &quot;She always makes everything about her. Shes always selfish and perfect. I&#39;m sick and tired everyone saying oh be like her she&#39;s the best.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cole wait,&quot; a now 8 year old Julia called. Cole slowly turned his head to look at his childish sister. Nodding stiffly her stepped aside as Julia looked at Claudia.<br />
<br />
Julai gulped as she shrank down to 7. Having to look up at her tiny sister was a surreal experience for her. She usually towered over the smaller girl and now foumd Claudia at least 7 inches taller than her. A final tingle spread over her body as she became 6, looking over herself she found her body to be flat as a boy. Her tiny arms and legs appeared skinny while the t-shirt she wore hung to her knees. Looking in the window of the shed she saw her childish face once more. Anadirably cute girl, tall for a 6 uear old with long blond hair cascading to the middle of her back. Taking a deep breath Julia stepped out of her sneakers and began to approach Claudia in her oversized socks.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to me,&quot;she chirped. Claudia looked down smugly at her now 6 year old sister. &quot;Looks like I put you back in first grade,&quot; she smirked. &quot;Serves you right, you wouldn&#39;t even let me talk with Cole.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julia frowned as she took this info in. &quot;Are you serious,&quot; she said flatly. &quot;I needed to talk to him about his injuries not to steal him you putz.&quot;<br />
<br />
A confused look spread across Claudia&#39;s as she looked at her brother. &quot;What is she talking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole looked stone faced at Julia. &quot;How did you find out?&quot;<br />
<br />
Julia placed her hands on her hips as she glared up at her brother. &quot;Hello,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I&#39;m a doctor in D.C. do you havr any idea how easy it is to get a hold of your medical records from Bethesda.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Civilian doctors shouldn&#39;t be able to get a hold of those,&quot;  he said flatly. Julia smirked, which at her current age made her look like a naughty child. &quot;Dad was a military hero and I&#39;m his eldest child. Trust me when I say theres alot of stuff I can get a hold of. Now let me see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole sighed, his shoulders slumping as he removed the t-shirt he was now wearing. Claudia gasped as she saw Cole&#39;s wounds. The man had what appeared to be 3 bullet hole scars on his left shoulder witb what appeared to be shrapnel wounds on his right side.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s nothing,&quot; he grunted.  Claudia stared in horror at her brothers wounds, tears begining to form in her eyes. Julia approached now examining the scar tissue with a critic eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing my ass,&quot; she muttered. &quot;Your lucky to be alive.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julia now approached her sister with a disapproving face as she looked at her. &quot;I wasn&#39;t trying to take Cole from you,&quot; she stated. &quot;The reason he&#39;s finally home is because of that. They want him to recover from those injuries before he returns to active duty. WHICH I HOPE IS NEVER!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole blushed slightly as he now put the t-shirt back on. &quot;Jules I&#39;m fine,&quot; he moaned. &quot;You really need to stop mother henning me,  especially when you look like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julia shook her head. &quot;Not happening Sergeant,&quot; she chirped. &quot;Knock off the G.I. Joe crap or I&#39;m telling mom. I already know the folks have no clue about this. You know damn well mom will have a fit. Then shes going to force dad to get you to quit. You already know dad never wins a fight with mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole now tried to stammer a response as Julia turned her attention to Claudia. &quot;As for you we need to talk NOW!&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia&#39;s face turned bright red as she stared at her diminutive sister. She had never felt so small. Nodding in embarassment she began to trudge away from her friends where her tiny sister now berated her.<br />
<br />
Katie and her friends had sat in silence throughout the entire ordeal. This was a family matter and even though Claudia had stolem the ring they weren&#39;t about to get involved. Now they found themselves standimg with Cole as a 6 year old Julia now talked to her sister like an angry mother. Katie looked up at the giant that was Cole who was chuckling softly to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whats so funny,&quot; she asked timdly.<br />
<br />
Cole looked down to see the pale faces of his sister&#39;s friends. &quot;Sorry,&quot; he said warmly. &quot;Its just funmy watching those two. Neither would admit it but they are EXACTLY like our parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean,&quot; Kellie asked quietly.<br />
<br />
Cole shook his head smiling. &quot;Claudia is a hot head just like dad. She&#39;s all feisty and ready to throw down at the drop of a hat. Julia on the other hand is exactly like mom. Quiet, rational and not intimidated. It doesn&#39;t matter how big or bad someone is. Once Julia has her mind set no ones changing her mind and you definitely lose the arguement. Exactly like mom and dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika smirked as she took this in. She had never thought of her girlfriend like that before but looking at her now she could totally see Tom Harris in Claudia. &quot;I see what your saying,&quot; she smirked as Claudia hung her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look I&#39;m sorry okay,&quot; Claudia groaned. &quot;I lost my temper.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And turned me into a freaking kid,&quot; Julia grumbled. &quot;How the hell did you do that? Do mom and the Major know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Claudia mumbled. &quot;Just my friends you know dad would freak out. That or think it could be some awesome weapon for the military.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two sisters now shared an awkward silence as they looked eachother over. &quot;You know I&#39;ve always hated how you talk to me like I&#39;m a damn imfant,&quot; Claudia mumbled.<br />
<br />
Julia sighed as she looked at her sister. &quot;Look  I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Its just......well when I was at home you were. By the time I left for college you were what 5, 6.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but I&#39;m not a kid anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I know,&quot; Julia sighed. Silence once again hung between the two girls. Julia was finally the one to break it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know when I was growing up I used to dream of the day we could talk like adults.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia gaped at her sister now surprised by what she was saying. Julai smirked, hilding her hand up before Claudia could speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you probably dont remember,&quot; she said. &quot;But before I went to college I would take you everywhere. Park, playgrounds, shopping. Mom was so busy with Cole and Derrick that she was only too happy to let me take you off her hands.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I dont remember any of that,&quot; Claudia whispered. &quot;All I remember is you being too busy when you came home from college. Then you went to medical school and I never saw you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julia sighed sadly as she remembered those days. &quot;I know,&quot; she muttered. &quot;I had so many expectations on me from the folks that I never had time for anyone else. I.....I really miss those days of just you amd me. I always thought that when you grew up we would be closer. Guess I messed that up. &quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia groaned as she looked at her tiny sister. She had been so jealous of Julia that she never thought of all the responsibility placed on her as the eldest daughter in a military family.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I messed up too,&quot; she moaned. &quot;I was always jealous. Mom and dad would always say why can&#39;t you be like Julia. She&#39;s so mature. Plus your tall, gorgeous and have an awesome body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julia smirked as she took her sisters hand. &quot;Yeah usually I do. To be honest I always envied you. You pretty much had a chance to grow up normal. Being a military brat sucks. Moving every couple of years, having to make new friends. It&#39;s.....its incredibly lonely.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two girls stared awkwardly at eachother before embracing eachother in a hug.  Katie and her friends now watched this scene. Touched that it seemed the sisters had made some positive steps in their relarionship. Now the only question was, what to do next.</p>
