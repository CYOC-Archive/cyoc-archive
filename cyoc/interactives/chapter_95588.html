<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The week passed by slowly while you waited for another chance to use the socks, even carrying them with you whenever you left the house just on the off-chance. However you hadn&#39;t had a true moment to yourself where you wouldn&#39;t be distracted or discovered by anyone since the day you first tried them on. Finally on the Friday morning, you found an opportunity. You were awake and out of the house earlier than usual after you accidentally wound up promising your gym teacher, and all-around sports coach, you would help him set up and prepare for the school&#39;s fundraising fun run happening later in the day. Mr. Castro was a heavy-set, hirsute man in his late forties. He originally hailed from Italy before leaving as a young man, and despite living in the country for over 2 decades, he still had a mild accent. This combined with his large, burly stature led to persistent rumors throughout the school that he was part of the Mafia, although you didn&#39;t believe it. With the amount of time he spent teaching and training, you doubt he had the spare time to also be a part of a criminal organisation. In fact, you admired the man&#39;s persistence to helping others achieve their potential and considered him as a sort of role model.<br />
<br />
After being dropped off by your mom, you wandered bleary-eyed to his office and knocked on the door. No answer. You paused for a few moments before knocking again to the same result. Pleasantries aside, you let yourself into the cramped room to find it empty. You roll your eyes and groan in annoyance, he expected you to arrive at school an hour earlier than you normally would, an hour you could have spent tucked up in bed. You debate whether to wait or to leave and eventually decide on waiting, it&#39;s not like you had anywhere else to be. You yank a chair sharply out from under the desk and collapse into it, hoping he would arrive soon.<br />
<br />
After 10 minutes, you were feeling very impatient. You decide to search his office for the marathon equipment so at least the early start was worth something. You open the supply closet in the corner and, after picking through the disorganized items, you found something interesting; a pair of black running shoes. You recognised them as the pair Castro would wear during lessons. Glancing outside of the room, making sure nobody was about, you quietly closed the office door and picked up one of the shoes, tracing a finger across its rubbery brand logo. You had waited days to get a chance to give the socks another round and here you were, alone in your coach&#39;s office, a pair of his shoes in your hands. It had to be a sign. Why, to have the chance to be your role model, it would be a dream. And once you found a white polo shirt and pair of gym shorts your coach also often wore for lessons, you knew it was destined for you to fulfil that dream. <br />
<br />
You fidgeted with anticipation as you pulled the green pinstriped socks from your bag and prepared yourself for the change, exchanging your shirt and jeans for the polo shirt and shorts so you wouldn&#39;t damage your clothes like you almost did when you became your father a few days back. The shorts were more like extra baggy 3/4 length pants and were huge around your waist, so much so that even tightening the drawstrings couldn&#39;t make them stay up. You decided on second thought not to even try the shirt on as it would surely swamp you in excess fabric. Besides, you wanted to see as much of your body change as possible. You slip the socks on, noting their eerily perfect fit, and finally tugged the running shoes over both feet. They were comically oversized for your feet, moreso than your dad&#39;s loafers were, but they wouldn&#39;t be for long.<br />
<br />
It only took a minute for you to notice the effects of the socks, even though it felt more like 10, as you felt your feet fill up the excess space within the shoe. The growth spread up your body as your legs immediately lengthened, sprouting like beanstalks and causing you to almost fall over. You nervously laugh as the room appears to shrink, you&#39;d been through the process once before but the fact the socks worked still astounded you. You wobble and manage to keep your balance as it became your upper body&#39;s turn to vertically jolt upwards like a jack-in-the-box, sending your head even closer to the ceiling. It wasn&#39;t long before you&#39;d added an entire 12 inches to your height, rivalling the height of the closet you found the shoes in. You stick an elongated arm up in the air and giggle as you didn&#39;t even have to stretch to touch the ceiling. You seemed to have kept your body proportions despite the crazy height increase, if a bit gangly looking.<br />
<br />
The next part of the transformation began as you felt a surge of power throughout your body. Your legs were first as your calves grew larger and your thighs inflated to incredible proportions compared to the rest of your bony body, looking as thick and sturdy as tree trunks. The pumped up muscle travelled upwards as your ass plumped up into perfectly round buttocks. As your hips and waist widened to accommodate your expanded lower body, you stomach quickly slimmed and sank into your body until a mighty six-pack cut itself through your skin, accompanied by a V-like groove that pointed towards your crotch. Your chest was next, inflating rapidly like in a cartoon as it practically doubled in circumference. Your back widened across your upper body, thrusting your shoulders outwards until your torso resembled an upside-down triangle. Your pecs thickened considerably, growing round and hard to the touch. You neck was swallowed up in the overflowing expansion as it finally flowed down your arms, inflating your upper arms to a size that could put melons to shame and toning your veiny forearms.<br />
<br />
You were grinning wildly as you mimicked the sort of poses you&#39;d seen bodybuilders pull in pictures. You knew Castro was stronger than his heavy-set body led you to believe but you&#39;d never guess he was this ripped under all that fat. An odd feeling overcame you as the changes had spread to your face. You spotted a small mirror to your side, positioned perfectly for your new height. You gazed at your reflection while your features shifted and morphed into a younger looking version of your coach&#39;s. Your sandy blonde hair rapidly darkened until it was a pure black. Your button-nose lengthened and slightly pointed forwards. Your jawline grew more sculpted and pointed while your chin slightly jutted out and gained a faint cleft. Your eyes subtly rounded and darkened to a dull brown. Your lips got slightly thinner while your brow got heavier, giving you a permanent scowl. You felt a sharp, harsh pain across your face as your nose cracked, the bridge looking misshapen, a long yet thin scar swept across your lower left cheek, and a few teeth vanished from your mouth to be quickly replaced by dental implants. You look like you&#39;d been in at least one big fight at some point in your life. You were looking more and more like Castro with every passing moment but there was still a lot more to go.<br />
<br />
 An intense itching suddenly overtook your entire being caused by the accelerated growth of hair across every part of your body. The faint, small hairs on your arms darkened and multiplied considerably, covering the tops of your fingers and hands, giving your forearms a gorilla-like coating and only somewhat dispersing as it stretched around your biceps and onto your wide shoulders. Your legs received a similar, possibly heavier coating of long, black hairs. A patch of dark hair sprouted in the centre of your chest, swirling outwards and completely coating your round pecs with curly hair. It rolled down your stomach, almost obscuring your chiselled abs, and connected with the untamed hairs that crept out from under your shorts. It even wrapped around your torso to give your back a sparse coating of its own. The lower half of your face momentarily turned a dark shade of grey as pinpricks of stubble squeezed out of the skin with a dense, sandpaper-like layer. The hairs quickly lengthened into a short, thick beard that did well to hide the scar you&#39;d recently received. The wild, untrimmed hairs crept high above your cheekbones and swept down your neck to seamlessly join your chest hair. You were impressed by the sheer amount of body hair you had obtained, it was even more than your dad had. You briefly wonder whether it&#39;s a bit too much. It was so thick, you couldn&#39;t even see your skin in some places. You stick a hand into the uninterrupted expanse of chest hair, it was probably what it felt like to stroke a bear. You smirk at the feeling and decide there&#39;s no such thing as too much body hair, gently playing with the fur. <br />
<br />
You were starting to feel bloated now. You try belching but it does little to ease the feeling. You place a hand on your stomach and cringe. You could feel your once-impressive abs begin to fade away. Your thighs were becoming more like thick pieces of ham that fit rather snugly within your shorts legs. Your bubble butt softened and turned more chunky. You waist grew even wider leaving you to hastily undo the drawstrings that had been keeping your shorts up. Your abs were no longer visible as your stomach curved outwards. It expanded in all directions until it threatened to collapse over your waistband. You gave the flesh a squeeze and were surprised at how firm it felt considering its shape. Your pectorals swelled to fantastic proportions, bulging outwards like a shelf of pure meat before finally sagging down towards your ball gut and causing your round nipples to almost hang underneath them. Finally your arms beefed up, your upper arms losing the defined shapes of musculature they previously had. Taking a look in the mirror, you see that all that extra weight had caused your previously sharp jawline to subtly round until you were on the verge of gaining of a second chin. You couldn&#39;t help but feel slightly disappointed at the fat gain, especially after seeing how buff you were without it, but you had to admit it gave you a certain sense of authority and intimidation. You were still just as robust as before, looking like you could rip a phone book in half. However your stature was now built for power and strength instead of aesthetics. You grab your round gut and feel it&#39;s hefty, tough mix of muscle and fat rest in your hands, a powerful ratio formed over years of training. You performed your bodybuilder poses again, now fully admiring your larger belly as it shook and bulged with your movement. <br />
<br />
A feeling of tiredness overwhelmed you as your prepared for what was likely to be the final stage. Your skin was losing its elasticity, turning rugged and wrinkled to the touch. It also turned several shades darker, taking on an olive hue that reflected your Mediterranean genes. The palms of your hands obtained callouses and slight tears from the amount of weightlifting you do. Your shorts grew even tighter as you felt the contents of your crotch increase in size, coming close to being obscene. Your hairline crept backwards, while a bald spot quickly appeared at the back of your head. Your hair rapidly thinned and receded as both parts met up and swept the top of your head clean of any hair. Laughter lines and crows feet dug into the skin around your eyes and crossed your cheeks. Even deeper lines etched themselves across your enlarged forehead and the corners of your mouth, giving you a roughened, weathered appearance. The horseshoe shape that remained of your hair fell away to reveal a close-cropped, greying stubble that accentuated your advanced male pattern baldness. Grey hairs sprung up and dominated your facial hair, the majority appearing throughout across your chin until it appered two-toned. More grey hairs formed in the centre of your drooping pecs and across the width of your chest. Your wild, full beard trimmed itself into shape, your bushy moustache no longer obscuring your mouth and your high cheekline and sideburns reduced to stubble so you were left with an extended goatee that stretched from each end of your jaw, growing longer on the chin.<br />
<br />
The flow of changes finally came to a stop. You had completely gained the thickset, brawny body of your gym teacher. While you had a few doubts about whether you would like being so big and rotund, you actually felt completely at ease like it really was your own body that you were accustomed to. You gawked at your reflection in the mirror, turning your head from side to side to see every angle of your craggy, bearded face. You bring a hand to your face and run a finger across your wrinkles, your skin feeling dry to the touch. You bring it up to your bald pate and place your palm on top. You shiver at the unusual feeling of skin-on-skin where you would usually feel hair. You stroke the smooth surface and drag your hand down, feeling the stubble on the sides of your head and the thick hairs that cover your lower face. You grab the tip of your beard and give it a pull, feeling a bit of pain as a few hairs come out. It wasn&#39;t just a dream, this massive body was for real. You heartily chuckle in triumph, throwing a fist in the air in celebration and wincing in pain, forgetting you were now six foot five as you accidentally punch the ceiling. But it didn&#39;t matter, you had become the super hairy, super bulky, middle aged man that you once looked up to, both figuratively and literally. You were Mr. Castro!</p>
