<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The conversations over the reveal at the Twist home did continue, and while there was the presentation that for the moment things would largely remain calm, that didn&#39;t necessarily mean that things were completely solved on that matter. There were plenty of things that the three werewolves had to worry about as well and that remained pretty clear even as dinner was finished. The three agree to head out for a run, or more that Ben figured to go out for a run and Nate and Alex decided to tag along. This of course lead to the three disrobing to transform and Nate passing his clothes to William.<br />
<br />
&quot;Things will be safe for this... right?&quot; William asked to Samantha while he folded Nate&#39;s pants and brown fur began to grow out over Nate&#39;s form. &quot;I mean...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t say that things will be uniformly supportive,&quot; Samantha answered as watched Ben set his own clothes down on his chair while his tail grew out behind him, &quot;but I would think that for the most part there shouldn&#39;t be a major problem. Especially if the three stay together and don&#39;t try to antagonize anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That will be a relief,&quot; Martha gave a sigh as Nate grew taller as his feet grew longer to let him assume a more digitigrade stance.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll be safe, mom,&quot; Nate promised and soon followed Alex and Ben out the Twist&#39;s back door.<br />
<br />
As he came out, he found the cooler night air refreshing in its own way. It wasn&#39;t cold by any means, but it was definitely cooler than it had been before Halloween. However, with the reveal still something that was apparently under serious consideration, Nate knew that the move toward winter was really the least of their concerns. It might not affect the Thanksgiving football game, but then the game could also be considered small when compared this planned reveal. Nate also knew that it wasn&#39;t likely that weres would get a &quot;warm&quot; reception, as too many stories in the media tended to portray weres as monsters or as the model for a psychopathic killer, as that was how many of the werewolf movies he liked and still liked portrayed werewolves. Nate was willing and eager to be a were, and had been most pleased that real weres weren&#39;t mindless or psychotic, but much of that came from the fact that he&#39;d been into weres so long in the first place.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll need to stop by my house to drop off my things,&quot; Alex commented as the three began to make their way across the Twists&#39; back lawn and toward the forest behind the line of houses.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... I guess we then have the route to take,&quot; Ben chuckled as he looked to see Alex hold up his clothes with his shoes dangling from two fingers, &quot;Let&#39;s go... it shouldn&#39;t take too long and will be a way to keep in shape. Wouldn&#39;t want to go all flabby over the weekend.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three of them took to a slow jog through the woods, largely with Alex leading the way as it was the Ramsey house that they were headed toward. Out of the corner of his eyes, Nate saw his boyfriend roll his eyes back at Ben.<br />
<br />
&quot;One weekend isn&#39;t going to make us out of shape,&quot; Alex commented as they began making their way through the trees, &quot;shoot... I&#39;d bet even the average Normal wouldn&#39;t get out of shape over one weekend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which will be good for the Thanksgiving Day game,&quot; Ben commented, &quot;but still... a little exercise couldn&#39;t hurt. Even if it&#39;s more a distraction from other things.&quot;<br />
<br />
And Ben honestly felt that way. He was glad that his moms had agreed to grant him permission to play in the game and was glad that things remained amicable between them. That Frances didn&#39;t feel like he was rejecting her because of the disagreement and Ben would make sure to stick to his promise to stay safe with regard to the game. And if the only thing to discuss or deal with was a flag football game, then Ben knew there wouldn&#39;t be a problem. But between the rumors about the City Council meeting and the decision that was reached at that meeting there was bound to be things that would overshadow the football game, and would be something that many would worry about for various reasons. Ben also knew that there was little that the three of them could do, even if they knew the right path for Moon Lake to take and as such about the only thing they could really do was wait and see.<br />
<br />
&quot;Might simply be something that doesn&#39;t involve worrying about whether or not weres will be accepted,&quot; Nate commented as they jogged along and ultimately came up on the backyard of the Ramsey home. As they did so, Alex held up one finger and then moved across the lawn while Ben and Nate waited inside the line of trees.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll be about all we can do,&quot; Ben commented, &quot;though... I&#39;d think that things will sort themselves out and positively so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You really think so?&quot; Nate asked as he looked over to Ben while they waited for Alex to come back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... it may not seem like it now, particularly to you and your parents as you&#39;ve all recently become weres... and there&#39;s been something that new weres often tend to be the most protective of the were secret,&quot; Ben nodded, &quot;but in many ways... I&#39;d think Moon Lake has been steadily advancing toward a decision like this, and from stories Samantha has told me... its something that leads to intense debate whenever these steps have been taken.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Nate wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... supposedly when the town was first founded the mandatory were law applied to EVERY member of a new family had to join were society,&quot; Ben nodded, &quot;thus if one family member betrayed the family... they would betray themselves as well. Or at least that was the reasoning. Thus if the law hadn&#39;t been amended when your family moved in... all of you would have HAD to become weres and the only choice would have been what were to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though they ended up becoming weres anyway,&quot; came Alex&#39;s voice as he joined them again.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s beside my point though,&quot; Ben commented as they soon resumed their jog through the woods. From what he could hear in the background there seemed to be some activity that wasn&#39;t too atypical for a normal night in Moon Lake and he hoped things stayed that way, at least for the night to help the town &quot;digest&quot; the city council decision. &quot;The larger point is that eventually the city decided that they were secure and safe enough that the mandatory were law was amended to say that at least one member of a new family had to become a were. If the rest of the family joined, as Nate&#39;s family did... regardless of the circumstances... that fine, but no longer mandatory. Which shows how things are changing and have been changing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And this reveal would be in line with all that?&quot; Nate wondered as they jogged along, now picking up the pace to avoid trees, bushes, and other things that might be &quot;obstacles&quot; in the night.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way,&quot; Ben nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem to know a lot... does your mom tell you all of this?&quot; Alex wondered with a slight teasing edge to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of it,&quot; Ben answered, knowing that Alex was joking around with the fact that his mother was Moon Lake&#39;s Town Chancellor.<br />
<br />
There were a few chuckles from Alex and eventually even Nate joined in. They continued on until they came closer to the point where Wood Street and the street that the Ramseys lived on met the outermost circular road that made up the &quot;hub&quot; of Moon Lake&#39;s &quot;wagon wheel.&quot; The coverage was still fairly thick with trees and shrubs, though many of them were also deciduous and thus there were some signs of leaves changing colors and falling to the ground. Some crackled underneath their feet as they jogged along, though Ben didn&#39;t pay attention to that, as his focus was on the lithe form making her way into the woods from the homes that faced the circular road. She also noted his approach and looked to him as he, Nate, and Alex approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello... my noble wolf,&quot; Kenya gave a warm smile as she looked down her black furred muzzle to Ben and then with Nate and Alex pulling up the rear, &quot;and you have escorts tonight, I see...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Kenya,&quot; Ben commented as he slowly came to a stop and glanced to Nate and Alex who came to a stop behind him, &quot;Mostly just getting some exercise and trying to do something that would involve not thinking about certain things...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This wouldn&#39;t be in relation to Frances?&quot; Kenya asked as the wereleopard twitched her tail behind her. Her form was striking, mostly due to the fact that she had the build and characteristics of a melanistic leopard, the famous &quot;black panther.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... that front was ultimately healed... mom: Frances gave her permission and I agreed to be safe... and we are on good terms,&quot; Ben answered, knowing that Kenya knew a bit more on the debate he&#39;d had with his mother over the Thanksgiving football game than Nate or Alex did. &quot;The thing right now has more to do with the City Council&#39;s recent decision...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My parents are probably still talking to Ben&#39;s parents about all that,&quot; Nate added.<br />
<br />
&quot;A part of me was thinking to ask some questions of my own,&quot; Kenya commented with a low nod to Nate and Alex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this...?&quot; Ben began and glanced over his shoulder to Nate and Alex.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is with my parents... yes...&quot; Kenya said slowly with a sigh, glancing to Ben&#39;s two friends, but knew that while their courtship would be a bit awkward, at least until Ben made it to the college, she also figured that it would be best to at least let his friends know some things. &quot;For you know they are still in New York... right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haven&#39;t they planned on moving here eventually?&quot; Ben asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... but that&#39;s something that will still take time,&quot; Kenya said slowly, &quot;and if this thing goes public and goes bad... they may not have that much protection. Here... even if people &quot;found&quot; Moon Lake, you have the open areas and avenues with which to escape. There aren&#39;t many places like that in New York City.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your parents are from New York?&quot; Alex wondered and waited for Kenya to nod in the affirmative, &quot;well... I can&#39;t say for certain as to how well humanity will react to such a reveal... and in many ways, I&#39;m sure ever were will fear the negative reaction...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That goes without saying,&quot; Kenya commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;But if this reveal tells everything... that weres exist and that we&#39;re likely highly fit individuals... places like Moon Lake might not actually be as safe, as such a large concentration of weres is going to attract theories based on the build of most of the people in Moon Lake,&quot; Alex answered, &quot;as we don&#39;t have a large scale gym and the small size of the town would generally mean that many people aren&#39;t going an hour to Seattle work out in the gym there and then come back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your point being?&quot; Kenya asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... a place like New York might be safer in that regard,&quot; Alex answered, &quot;the population is larger and highly diverse with tons of things that could be written off for exercise and so on. Thus if a New Yorker responds negatively to this reveal... they might not be able to look at your parents in their human form and say &quot;were&quot; because they&#39;d know a fair number in the city that would have a similar build that they know aren&#39;t weres.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It might mean staying in human form more... but Alex might be right there,&quot; Nate commented. &quot;Lots of people will change some of the perceptions...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... but weres will generally prefer to be in their were form,&quot; Ben commented, &quot;and in a crowded place like New York City... where many apartment walls aren&#39;t that thick or insulated to muffle sounds... some things may be difficult.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True,&quot; Alex nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that is what has me worried,&quot; Kenya spoke, &quot;I&#39;m sure my parents would be safe and would not deliberately try anything that would raise suspicion... but there is still much in this that could go wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There may not be any real answer one way or the other that will avoid that risk,&quot; Ben said slowly, &quot;my family didn&#39;t go to the City Council meeting and my mom: Samantha isn&#39;t required to be there. Deputy Mayor Katherine Chambers manages the debates and is there to cast the deciding vote. And from what we&#39;ve all heard... the vote went largely in response to some of the recent events that have had the potential to expose weres... namely the gun fight in Seattle. In this, it&#39;s either we continue to wait for an accident or crime to expose weres and then being connected with the crime or come out while we can still control the narrative. All the risks and fears will be there regardless.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn&#39;t sound reassuring,&quot; Kenya said with a frown.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... I suppose it doesn&#39;t,&quot; Ben commented, &quot;but sometimes things in life aren&#39;t easy and all we have is hope that things will turn out well. And right now... all that they&#39;re working on is a plan. Actually carrying it out... will need another vote with the plan is put together. Right now... with all of that... we can only wait and see.&quot;</p>
