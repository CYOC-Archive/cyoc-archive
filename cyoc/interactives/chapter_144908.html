<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">By the end of summer, Chad weighed close to a thousand pounds. He had produced over ten thousand loads of sperm for Zeb and Jude&#39;s freezer and cows.  Chad could tell the days were getting shorter.  He should be at football camp.  Zeb had promised and hinted that Chad would be there, but Chad had his doubts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, girl, today&#39;s the day,&quot; laughed Zeb, as he plunged huge syringe into Chad&#39;s right testicle and emptied the contents. Chad bellowed in agony.  It burned so badly.   Chad was so lost in his agony, he didn&#39;t see Zeb refill the syringe and walk around to his left side.  He did feel the gloved hand on his store testicles just before the syringe punctured his left nut.  Chad was bellowing and stomping in agony.  His balls were on fire, his bull shaft extended, but even while erect he could feel it shrinking backward into his body. Maybe he was becoming human.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zeb!&quot; shouted Jude, &quot;You were supposed to wait for me.  Oh, my his balls look huge, perfect for banding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nroo!&quot; balked Chad.  But it was too late, as Jude said the word &quot;banding&quot; he snapped the rubber gelding band into place.<br />
<br />
Jude gently massaged Chad&#39;s neck, &quot;There, there jockboy.  I cannot have a trophy if they retract inside you like your cock, as you become a cow, now can I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mrrooo!  Mrooo!&quot; protested Chad.<br />
<br />
Zeb and Jude laughed.  Twenty minutes later, Chad felt lighter, Jude had unceremonious cut off his balls.  He sobbed softly.  Later Zeb fed him three times his usual portion of oats.  He ate and chewed his cud feeling betrayed. Zeb unfastened the trainers and allowed Chad to lie down for the first time in months.  Chad fell asleep.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, girl, how you doing today?&quot; ask Jude.  There seemed to be real concern in his voice.<br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s head felt so heavy.  He was still bovine.  He struggled to his hooves, and stood.  He felt a heavier weight between his thighs. He was male again?  He mooed.  Gloved hands grabbed two of his penises?  No, udders!  He was a cow.  Jude milked Chad old style.  Chad felt relieved as his swollen udder emptied.  It wasn&#39;t quite as enjoyable as blowing a load, but it took longer, and that made it pleasurable. At last all four udders had been milked, and Jude carried two full buckets away.<br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s belly felt so heavy.  There was the sound of water splashing on the floor.  Chad realized it came out of him.  He lay down, and began to push.  A human hand covered in placenta pushed out from beneath Chad&#39;s tail.  Chad was confused.  He was a cow, but he was human inside a cow.  He pushed his arms and shoulders out, his head gasped for air. He fought and struggled, and collapsed in the straw naked, and wet. <br />
<br />
Jude helped the newly human Chad by cutting the umbilical, and tying it off, and then guiding Chad&#39;s head to one of the four teats hanging from the cow Chad&#39;s udder.  <br />
<br />
It was confusing for Chad.  He was a cow, and he was human.  His mind was one.  He could feel himself deep throating the udder, it was his udder and his throat.  It was weird, but he was do hungry.  For the next week or so, Chad suckled at his cow&#39;s teat.  He gained weight, and managed to stand and walk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you  look almost ready to go to football camp,&quot; said Jude one morning.<br />
<br />
Chad the cow asked, &quot;Moo?&quot;  How could he go to football camp, he was a cow.<br />
<br />
Jude laughed, and tousled Chad the human&#39;s head. He was almost his old size, but he didn&#39;t have facial hair yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to start exercising your vocal chords, Chad,&quot; said Jude.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, uh? Juhhud?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Close enough for now, Chad. You weighed over a thousand pounds as a bull.  To get you back to your old size, we turned you into a pregnant heifer.  And you gave birth to yourself. You&#39;re going to be the perfect roommate with benefits.<br />
<br />
&quot;Buhn-uh-fts?&quot; Chad human managed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, heh, oh, yeah, you are already expert at sucking udder, and my cock is about the size of one of your udders,&quot; said Jude.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re going to be our roommate at college.  The football coach arranged it.  After six months as a bull taking it up the wazoo, and a few weeks sucking udder until you&#39;re weaned, you&#39;ll be the perfect cocksucking fuck toy roommate,&quot; said Zeb.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huhmuhm?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you&#39;ll be human, Chad.  Just a very gay version of yourself,&quot; laughed Jude.  He added, &quot;But you&#39;ll also remain a cow.  Your mind is inexorably linked so don&#39;t think you will every be anything but owned by Zeb and me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah, almost forgot,&quot; said Zeb, &quot;You got to brand him last time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeow!&quot; shrieked Chad as the hot iron seared his right butt cheek.  Then stench of burning flesh and pain made him want to wrench.  He lay sobbing for a few minutes.  His empty stomach rumbled, and he crawled over to his mother self and started sucking a teat.   He blindly moved on to the next, and then the next.  It was different this time.  He opened his eyes.  Instead of a cow, Chad found his face buried in Zeb&#39;s pubes.  He wasn&#39;t sucking an udder, it was Zeb&#39;s cock.  It spurted.  He didn&#39;t even gag.  Zeb stepped back, and Jude stepped forward with his cock hanging out of his jeans.  Chad swallowed it.  He sucked off three good size loads, and a half load.  Then he was allowed to finish draining his udder.<br />
<br />
In the next few weeks, Chad grew to his former weight and height, his beard grew in, and his speech returned to normal.   He no longer had thoughts for any girls, his lust and heart belonged to Zeb and Jude.  They were his besties.  They helped him to discover his true self.  He couldn&#39;t wait to move in with them and begin college life.</p>
