<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The rest of the day seemed to just fly by. But during it Paul couldn&#39;t stop thinking about Jeff. His small lean muscular frame just kept running through his head. Old thoughts of him changing in front of him were now forefront in his mind. Paul squirmed in the small desk that just seemed so much smaller today than it had before. But it was the same with his shirt as well. It just kept pulling at his neck and the sleeves weren&#39;t as loose around his arms. <br />
<br />
He was glad when the school was finally over. He could change out of his clothes into his more comfortable work out ones. And today was just drills and the weight room so he wouldn&#39;t have to worry about his pads fitting wrong either. <br />
<br />
As he entered the weight room he could already hear Jeff shouting. &quot;What is with everyone! Seriously! What the fuck&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
None of the other guys responded. There were several of them crowding around him as he was changing. The only thing he had on were his boxer briefs that clung tightly to his quads. His soft pecs just barely pushed out in front of him, but that six pack he had under them were all the girls ever cared about.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing,&quot; one of the guys said. But everyone was still staring. Including Paul. For a second he felt his brain drift off. Paul instantly saw themselves in the locker room by themselves. He pushed his smaller friend against the locker, tearing off the underwear, hiding Jeff&#39;s perfectly sculpted butt. &#39;More,&#39; Jeff begged. <br />
<br />
&quot;Paul!&quot; Jeff shouted, tearing the other man from his sudden fantasy. &quot;Get me away from these guys. They&#39;re being so fucking weird today.&quot; He threw over his shirt and pulled up his shorts as he crossed the locker room to get Paul to be his bodyguard. A dull groan filled the rest of the locker room as they each had their own fantasies squashed. &quot;Jesus... What&#39;s wrong with them?&quot; He whispered to Paul.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dunno,&quot; Paul said. He turned away as he pulled up his gym shorts to hide his own boner. Blood just kept rushing to his penis and he couldn&#39;t stop it. Even as he flexed, the blood just seemed to stay in that one place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking weirdos man,&quot; Jeff said as they went up to the track. The two quickly went through a series of stretches, then started running. &quot;Still don&#39;t know what&#39;s up with them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Haven&#39;t heard anything,&quot; Paul said. He could still see them staring at the two as they ran around the field. Each of the guys on the team, and even the coach&#39;s seemed to just be staring right up until Jeff would look at them. Then they&#39;d quickly turn away, pretending not to be looking at him. <br />
<br />
Jeff let out a groan. &quot;Let&#39;s go down into the weight room,&quot; he said after they finished their run. &quot;Surprised you actually kept up with me big guy.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Did I?&quot; Paul didn&#39;t even realize he wasn&#39;t even out of breath. With his larger size, it was always so hard to keep up and even harder to go the full distance. But he barely felt like he&#39;d done anything. Part of him almost wanted to go for more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah man. Just look at you. Have you been losing weight?&quot; Jeff poked at Paul&#39;s belly. It felt firm. &quot;Dude!&quot; he grabbed at the shirt and lifted it up. There was the tiniest outline of six individual blocks, forming his abs. &quot;When&#39;d you get those?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul quickly pushed his shirt back down. &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude!&quot; Jeff leaned in closer. &quot;Are you on something?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No. It&#39;s just... I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve been feeling a bit different today. I don&#39;t know why though. Everything I&#39;m wearing has just been feeling tighter than usual,&quot; Paul said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weird...&quot; Jeff walked into the weight room and a couple of guys turned their heads. He let out a heavy breath of air, then went over to the squat rack. &quot;Spot me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul nodded. He watched as Jeff added two 45 pound plates on each side and then positioned himself under the squat bar. It wasn&#39;t a whole lot of weight for someone like Paul, but to Jeff it took a lot of effort. His smaller leaner muscles weren&#39;t built for the same kind of power and strength that Paul was. But that didn&#39;t mean Paul&#39;s eyes looked away for a second. He could easily see that perfectly sculpted butt dip down and out and he wanted to follow it all the way to the ground. <br />
<br />
His mind started to wander again. Feeling a weird feeling rush to him as he wanted to keep him down on the ground in that squatted position. He wanted to tear open those shorts and reveal that tight asshole that he could tear open as well. <br />
<br />
&quot;Paul?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
The sudden noise made Paul jump. &quot;Huh?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus! What&#39;s going on today?&quot; Jeff demanded. &quot;Now you&#39;re getting all dreamy on me too?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry... It&#39;s just,&quot; Paul tried to think of a lie. &quot;I was just wondering if you wanted to go back to the fair tonight?&quot;</p>
