<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jane woke up later then normal because she had stayed up later the night before. She had gone to the grocery store near by, mostly to buy food and other necessities but also to buy diapers and pull ups for Sam incase he had another accident. She knew he wasn&#39;t very mature for his age but  wetting his pants at ten years old was just weird. Jessica was the same age as him and she hadn&#39;t wet herself since she was three. Even Greg and Michael, four years younger than him, neither had wet themselves for two years. She supposed it was only a phase though. And hopefully it would pass.<br />
<br />
<br />
She rose out of bed and immediately felt strain on her back and chest. She looked down at her breasts, she hadn&#39;t worn a bra to sleep. That was odd, normally she wore her bra and nightie to sleep. Otherwise she felt pain in the morning because her breasts were quite large and required support. So obviously the first thing she did was put on one of her D cup bras. She then went downstairs to prepare breakfast for everybody.<br />
<br />
Jessica was the first one down, as always. She poured herself a bowl of cereal and began to eat at the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jessica, sweetie after you&#39;ve finished breakfast can you go to a shower and then get changed. We&#39;re going for another picnic today and then well see what else we can do afterwards, okay?&quot; Jane said to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure mom.&quot; Jessica replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I&#39;m going to go check on Sam, if Greg or Michael come down just help them with there breakfast but I should be back by then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam woke up feeling some wetness around him. He reached his hand under hus covers to discover that my goodnite was extremely wet and had even leaked. He got out of his wet bed and the goodnites immediately fell to the floor. He stepped out of them and walked over to the door. Before he could reach the door it opened and his aunt came in the room. She saw him standing their in front of the soaked goodnite with no clothes on. <br />
<br />
Sam did you wet the bed this time, I had hoped this would only happen once. You know what if you&#39;re going to wet the bed like a baby I&#39;m going to treat you like one until you realise how to behave like a ten year old. Lets get you in a fresh pull up.&quot; She said to him.<br />
<br />
Jane went over to the dresser and opened it pulling out a bag of pull up training pants saying &quot;if this is going to happen again I think it would be best if you wear one of these, I will give you a chance to prove that you can still make it to the potty.<br />
 She pulled out one of the pull ups from the package, it had cars from Disney on it, and held them out for him to step into. Sam stood in the pull ups as she pulled them up to his waist saying that I didn&#39;t need any other clothes while home, because she wanted to be able to see if i had any accidents. Before he knew what was happening Jane picked him up with her hand under his butt, and carried him out into the kitchen where Greg and Michael both got to see him in just a pull up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Jessica thankyou for helping Greg and Michael out,&quot; Jane thanked her. Jessica just shrugged.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sam was taken over to a booster seat that was now at the table and placed in it. Aunt Jane went and got him a bowl of cheerios with a big plastic spoon. She also got him a sippy cup full of orange juice and placed it next to the bowl of cereal. Before he could even pick up the spoon my vision was blocked out for a second while his aunt put a bib over hus head and round his neck.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sam sat their mortified by all that was happening to him. He hated drinking from the sippy cup, but man was he thirsty so he did anyway. When he was done with everything he asked if he could be let our of the chair because he had to go to the bathroom. Jane lifted him out of the chair and placed him feet flat on the tile floor of the kitchen. She told him to wait right there. She left the kitchen and came back with a plastic potty chair. <br />
<br />
While Jane was gone he dribbled a little bit into the training pants. He felt some pee just kind of come out, it wasn&#39;t a lot though. Jane pulled down his pull ups and sat him on the potty chair. He was mortified to be naked in front of his 2 cousins who were still eating at the table. At least he was now somewhat covered up by the pee guard. He didn&#39;t want to go to the bathroom in the middle of the kitchen in front of his cousins, but Jane said that he only could come off the potty when he made a tinkle. He sat their for a little bit and without really feeling it he began to pee in the potty. The pee hitting the potty made a loud sound so everyone, was looking at me. When he stopped peeing Jane told me what a good boy he was and pulled him off the potty and then pulled his pull ups up to his waist.<br />
<br />
 Jane told him that he could go watch some TV in the living room while she cleaned out the potty chair. He walked into the living room and turned on the TV. He had the news on for what ever reason. He sat on the couch and watched TV for a little bit. Greg came in the living room saying that he wanted to watch cartoons. Sam said no but all Greg  did was call out for Jane and she yelled from the kitchen that we should watch some cartoons for a little while. Sam handed Sam the remote thinking how babyish it was for him to want to watch cartoons. Then he realized he was the one at least in underwear, while  he was sitting in a slightly damp pull up. He kept feeling himself dribble pee into the pull up, but their was nothing he could do to really stop it.<br />
<br />
<br />
After a while of watching cartoons the pull up felt pretty wet. Sam looked and could see that the car design on the front looked pretty faded, indicating that the pull up had been used. Jane came in a little bit later with a fresh pull up and the plastic potty. She set the potty on the floor and said that its okay that he wet his pull up, little boys tend to dribble without knowing. She had him stand up and pulled off my damp pull up and told him to sit on the potty for a little bit. He sat their in the living room exposed as she told Greg to get on some clothes, because he was still in just his undies. Aunty let Sam sit on the potty for about 5 minutes before she let him stand up and put on a fresh pair of pull ups.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re going for another picnic today so if your good and don&#39;t wet yourself I might stop treating you like a three year old. But I will continue to do so until you start behaving. Next thing I know I&#39;ll be breastfeeding you just to teach you a lesson.&quot; She sighed. &quot;Look I know your mom died and if this is you going through a phase to get over that, that&#39;s fine but you have to remember. I&#39;m your mommy now, I&#39;m not aunty Jane. Just mom. Okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam nodded quietly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lets get you some clothes then.&quot;<br />
<br />
They both went upstairs to get changed. They went into Jane&#39;s bedroom. She told him to wait on the bed as she got changed. She opened the closet and took out a pair of jeans, a t-shirt and a zip up hoodie for herself. She then stripped down into just her bra and panties. Sam was staring at her. <br />
<br />
&quot;What is it baby?&quot; She asked him.<br />
<br />
Sam just looked away as she finished getting changed. She then moved onto him. She got a pair of shorts, a shirt and a cardigan out of a drawer for him and helped him get changed.<br />
<br />
They then went downstairs where everyone else was waiting for them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on guys, get in the car then. Oh Jessica can you get the basket sweetie? It&#39;s just on the table.&quot; Jane told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; replied Jessica.<br />
<br />
&quot;And put your glasses on!&quot; She half yelled.<br />
<br />
Once everyone was in the car they drove to the same park as yesterday as Greg and Michael talked to each other and Jane and Jessica did as well. Sam on the other hand said nothing.<br />
<br />
They arrived at the park and Greg and Michael instantly ran off to play with the other children. Jane suggested that Sam did as well as she and Jessica sorted lunch out. Sam, Greg and Michael all ran round a climbing frame playing tag with a group of other kids. Jessica joined them eventually and after about two hours Jane called them over for lunch. <br />
<br />
She gave Jessica, Greg and Michael each a sandwich and some snacks. Sam asked for some but she told him to wait. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is your pull-up wet?&quot; She asked him<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; he replied shamefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we&#39;ll have to change you then.&quot;<br />
<br />
She just pulled his pants down right then and gave him a fresh pull up, which she pulled up to his waist and through the wet one in the trash can. She then gave him a much smaller sandwich than the others and some carrots. <br />
<br />
After they had all finished their lunch it was around one o&#39;clock and they all decided to go back home and hang around the complex for the rest of the day. <br />
<br />
Once they got home Greg, Michael and Jessica all sat down to watch cartoons. Sam was going to join them but Jane picked him up before he reached the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where are you going Sammie? Its time for your nap okay.&quot; She said to him.<br />
<br />
She carried him upstairs and into his bedroom where the bed was now covered in a plastic sheet. She lay him down in his bed and let him fall asleep.<br />
<br />
<br />
When Sam awoke he looked at the clock next to him. 4:30. He had slept for three hours. He lay there for another hour until Jane came in the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah you&#39;re awake,&quot; she said. She picked him up under the arms and pulled him out of bed. She checked his pull-up. Only damp so she assumed the bed was fine. She checked just to be sure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy, your pull-up needs changing but you didn&#39;t wet te bed like last time. If you keep this up I&#39;ll take the sheet off. &quot; <br />
<br />
She put him down and he went downstairs to watch cartoons for a few hours until bedtime. At around eight Jane turned the TV off and told him it was time for bed. She put the plastic potty on the floor again for him and allowed him to do his business. She then washed it out and took him upstairs. <br />
<br />
She changed him into a free pull-up and a blue onesie. She then put him in his bed and tucked him in. Instantly he drifted off ready for the next day.</p>
