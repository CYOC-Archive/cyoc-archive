<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You may have a super power, but you aren&#39;t free from the labyrinth prison just yet! You need to develop a strategy. One mistake, and you&#39;re dead.<br />
<br />
You&#39;ve never noticed any cameras in your room. There may be some expertly-hidden cams, of course. You don&#39;t want to do anything that could reveal you as a shape-shifter. Drat, you hope no one saw you transform those movies!<br />
<br />
Well anyway, you decide there&#39;s only one safe thing to do: wait it out.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
The next 7 days are torturous. All you can think about is how you&#39;re going to use the ring and escape. You almost accidentally mention it to a guard one morning! But finally, the time has arrived. Someone is unlocking your door. You probably should have tested to make sure the &quot;one extra charge per-week&quot; rule works properly, but there&#39;s no way you&#39;re going to wait another 14 days to try to escape.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, ma&#39;am!&quot; The guard says, waving to you and shutting the door behind him. He doesn&#39;t even bother locking it. Everyone in the staff is always so friendly. It&#39;s as if they&#39;re so confident in Bresgenzer security that they have nothing to fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning, Derrick.&quot; You say, knowing many of the guards by name at this point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keepin&#39; the place cozy, are you?&quot; Derrick asks<br />
<br />
“...yeah…” You wince.<br />
<br />
“I know, it’s not easy staying put in one place your whole life, is it?” He says as he diligently restocks your refrigerator. “Well, it’s not so bad once you get used to it. You never have to worry about bills or appointments, that’s for sure, right?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah!” You say. You are always baffled by the stupid things Derrick says, but right now you’re mostly trembling with anticipation. “Hey uh… what’s that thing under the fridge?” You ask.<br />
<br />
“Under the fridge?” Derrick says, scratching his chin. He gets down on his knees and peers into the dark space between the fridge and the floor. “I don’t see anyth--”<br />
<br />
Derrick is interrupted as you full-body tackle him from behind, and envelope the both of you in a blanket. Your plan is for no one to see what happens as your body transforms into Derrick’s body, and Derrick’s body transforms into yours.<br />
<br />
“Dammit!” You yell as you pop out of the blanket and see your newly flattened, hairy chest emerging from the t-shirt and bra you were wearing. “Why did I think it would swap clothes?!”<br />
<br />
You shake your head violently for a second and blink a few times. Did that voice just come out of your own mouth? Deep, basey… this is what a man’s voice sounds like from the inside? Well, no time to dwell right now. You have to deal with the other subject slowly emerging from the blanket. A frightened young woman is trembling on the floor, clinging onto her loose-fitting guard uniform. You are amazed by how small she looks. Nevermind the fact that she looks identical to you. Well, identical to how you looked until a moment ago.<br />
<br />
Derrick starts screaming for help. You’re quite put-off, hearing something in your voice. Something you wouldn’t have said...spoken with a personality you don’t have. You decide to give Derrick a taste of her own medicine.<br />
“Calm down! Geez! Won’t you prisoners behave already??” You exclaim, shaking your head. You don’t know what any of the guard protocol is so you’ll just have to stick with shitty improvisation.<br />
<br />
Three more guards pile up at the door behind you. They ask what’s wrong. Then they just ogle at how the both of you are dressed. Embarrassed, you look down… Luckily, your slacks still fit alright. They’re a bit tight at the ankles, but that’s no big deal.<br />
<br />
“Freeze!” One of the guards draws a weapon. It looks like a standard pistol, but you’re not sure. He points it at Derrick. “Officer Wallerts, was this inmate trying to escape??” He asks.<br />
<br />
“Yes! I think so!” Derrick exclaims.<br />
<br />
The guard reels back a bit, surprised to see the inmate so eagerly confess.<br />
<br />
“Wait! No!” You exclaim, realizing the question was addressed to Derrick (and that Derrick’s last name must be “Wallerts”.) “The inmate is having a manic episode and she sexually assaulted me!” You say, drawing again on quick improvisation.<br />
<br />
“I see.” The guard says, lowering his pistol and giving the other guards the signal to get to work. One of them pins Derrick to the ground, while the others march into the room and remove all of the furniture. They systematically haul out the TV, the books, the bed...they even uninstall the toilet and plug it shut. They then proceed to remove Derrick’s clothes. They are surprised to see men’s underwear underneath her uniform. They wonder how she managed to switch all your clothes with you so quickly. They strip her completely naked, take a pair of handcuffs and tie her up to a chain that they attach to a hook on the ceiling. Derrick is now forced to keep her arms above her head, and isn’t quite able to fully sit on the floor.<br />
<br />
You’re a bit taken aback, seeing a replica of your own body abused and pinned up like that. Whatever, you need to snap out of it. You and the guards exit the room and lock the door. You did it! You escaped your room! It’s been well over a month, and you finally get to breathe a slightly fresher air!<br />
<br />
“No amenities for 3 months!” The guard says to Derrick through the window. “That’s the minimum sentence for sexual misconduct. Be a good girl and behave yourself now!” He adds.<br />
<br />
You tear your gaze away from the window as you and the guards march down the hallway together.<br />
“Officer Wallerts… uh… here you go, sir.” The guard says, awkwardly handing you Derrick’s uniform.<br />
<br />
“Thank you, sir!” You say, eager to change into something less conspicuous.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
You have a moment of silence to change in the locker room. No one else is there at the moment. You think about your situation as you try to slide your pants down. You are no longer a prisoner...but you’re now a prison guard at a prison that claims to be impossible to escape. There’s probably a lot of very strict rules to work by, and you don’t know any of them!<br />
<br />
You see the plain white panties you had been wearing, and a sweaty mass of bulging flesh bulging out the sides. Oh, you almost forgot about that part. You slide the panties down, and the moment you lay eyes on your new body part… Well, you’re not very long, but you make up for it in girth. You start to get erect, just staring at it. You remember watching your body get stripped naked...you remember the other guard telling it to “be a good girl”, and you grow into a full, raging erection. You reach out and touch it; feel it. It’s like someone sucked your clit out and put it on a third leg. You start to rub it and stroke it. This is what it’s like to have external genitalia!<br />
<br />
“Officer Wallerts?” The other guard asks.<br />
<br />
“Oh! Oh, yessir?” You ask, puffing up your chest and covering your crotch with the guard uniform.<br />
<br />
“Officer Wallerts...the dean would like to speak with you. In 15 minutes flat, and that’s an order.” He says, then turns around and walks out.<br />
<br />
Crap. You may be out of the frying pan, and just straight into the fire. But...you’re all alone again. The temptation is irresistible. Testosterone is flowing through your body, and male sexuality is overtaking your higher judgement. You reach your hand back down and continue to stroke.<br />
<br />
Your hairy, muscle-defined arm is able to plow away at your chubby cock, seemingly endlessly. You bite your lip and moan as precum starts to splatter around your hand. Drips fly up all the way to your face. You writhe around on the bench until you’re in a full laying position. You instinctively reach your nondominant hand down, attempting to insert them into your vagina, but finding the path blocked. Your instincts manage to roll with it, and you instead cup the contents of your crotch into your hand. This gives you some addition to the pleasure; enough to send you over the edge. You let out an enormous, deep moan, and a second later your hand is soaking and sticky.<br />
<br />
You lay there for a number of minutes, just panting and watching dust fly around in the air as the sweat dries.<br />
<br />
At last, you come to your senses and you get dressed. You watch your now-flaccid penis flop its way into the boxers Derrick was wearing before you transformed him, and then equip yourself in the rest of the guard’s uniform.<br />
<br />
You just barely make it to the Dean on time, and are questioned furiously on what happened, and how “the inmate” managed to swap all of your clothes. The Dean expresses his doubts, and suggests that you had deliberately chosen to swap clothes with her.<br />
<br />
“It seems to me like you and the inmate were getting up to something in there. Officer Wallerts, you KNOW the penalty for sexual activity with the prisoners, don’t you?” He asks, smiling from across the desk.<br />
<br />
You nod. You don’t actually know, but you nod.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
You are placed in a holding cell. A trial is being arranged for you, which will supposedly be held the next day. You did learn what the punishment was, by the way: castration. Yeah… well at least you had fun with that thing while it lasted.<br />
<br />
It is weird, though. You’d think you’d be fired over this, but you’re actually expected to keep your job. In fact, someone told you you’ll be back on the clock not 30 minutes after you wake up from the surgery.<br />
<br />
What do you do now? You’re no longer a prisoner. In a way, you’ve already escaped. You can just finish up your shift and go home as Derrick Wallerts now. The surgery won’t even hurt since you’ll be on anesthetics. So you just kick back and await the trial.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
You plead guilty to everything they accused you of, and shrugged as you were sent straight to the operating room. I mean, it’s not really “your” balls they’re getting rid of, anyway.<br />
<br />
And just as you were told, you’re back on your feet and monitoring the halls of the prison later that very afternoon. You pass by your old room on the way. You can’t help but stare through the window, at the real Derrick...her wrists bruised by the cuffs. You feel bad for her. She didn’t deserve any of this. Nevertheless, you need to look out for yourself. Really, maybe you shouldn’t feel THAT bad for someone who chose to work for such an obviously unethical prison.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
You breathe a sigh of relief as you clock out of work a few hours later. Finally, you can go back to “your” home and you’ll be free to live your own life again.<br />
<br />
...right?<br />
<br />
Well, this is the point when you start to finally understand why it’s called the Bresgenzer “Labyrinth” Prison. This is no simple campus of buildings. This is something far, far beyond that. No matter how many buildings you pass, all you see is more buildings. More roads, leading to more prison buildings. You can’t even see a horizon: it’s just more prison after more prison. As Derrick Wallerts, your home is IN the prison. You live in a small apartment, shared with two other prison staff members.<br />
<br />
“Hey dude!” One of your roommates says, getting out of the shower. “Didn’t see you last night! I heard you were in confinement?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I was…” You answer awkwardly.<br />
<br />
“Bro I heard you got snipped?” He asks, drying off his hair.<br />
<br />
“Uh, yeah. Pretty messed up, right?” You avoid eye contact, not exactly sure what kind of relationship the two of you are supposed to have.<br />
<br />
“Yeah wicked fucked up, bro. You always talked about how you wanted to have kids and stuff.” He flings off his towel and starts pulling up a pair of boxers. “Anyway, shower’s clear, my dude.”<br />
<br />
“Okay.” You respond, spacing out a little. “Hey uh… bro. Do you remember how long it’s been since I last left the prison? I’ve totally forgotten.” You ask.<br />
<br />
“Left the Bresgenzer property entirely? Uh, wasn’t it like 8 months ago?” He says.<br />
<br />
“Right, right I remember that. It’s like...difficult to leave the facility, right?” You ask, hoping to be corrected.<br />
<br />
“Totally! I know, right? I sometimes have a hard time remembering all the questions they ask you before you’re allowed to leave. And that’s not including the like 12 different forms of ID you need.” He answers again.<br />
<br />
“Yeah…” You sigh. “...it sucks.”<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
You stand there in the shower, staring down at your sackless groin.<br />
“Well… at least I’m not trapped in a single room anymore.” You mutter to yourself.</p>
