<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason felt ridiculous walking beside his double wide 8 foot tall mother. He was 16 gosh darn it, but next to her he felt like a little kid again out on a grocery trip with his mommy. The only other difference was that his mommy was now a fat, sweaty, rancid, jiggling giantess stuffed into the world’s largest mom jeans. As he entered the store with her he braced himself for the stares, and possibly a few screams. As it turned out, however, nobody else in the store seemed to so much as bat an eyelash. Sure there was a passing glance here or there and rarely did anyone’s gaze linger, but outside of that there weren’t any huge reactions.<br />
<br />
Jason now wasn’t sure what he was expecting.<br />
<br />
“Let’s see, we’re probably going to need a couple of the bigger carts,” Martha explained, “You can reach the handle, right?”<br />
<br />
“I... wouldn’t know,” Jason shrugged honestly, “I mean, how big are they gonna be?”<br />
<br />
“About double the size of the little ones,” Martha clarified, “So... no you won’t be able to reach. It’s okay, I can take two at once. You just focus on the bottom shelves where I can’t quite reach anymore, alright?”<br />
<br />
With a nod, the mother and son got started shopping. All the while he was amazed at how little of a reaction she was eliciting from others, almost as though it were a normal sight to see a woman the size of an elephant that smells like a septic tank. In fact, to his amazement they passed another stinking ham planet of a person with a cart loaded with food. As it turned out, his family weren’t the only giant fatasses in the world and more than that were apparently a common enough sight!<br />
<br />
“Jason, are you sure you’re alright?” Martha asked, “You look a little paranoid today.”<br />
<br />
“I... just got a lot on my mind,” Jason said, “In fact, could I ask you to humor me for something?”<br />
<br />
“Of course honey bunch,” Martha smiled, “What is it?”<br />
<br />
“I... well my head is feeling a little fuzzy and I need you to answer some questions I have,” Jason explained, “Probably some obvious questions but can you please answer honestly?”<br />
<br />
“How obvious are we talking, dear?” Martha inquired.<br />
<br />
“As obvious as say,” Jason began, “how you got so big?” There was a bit of a pause as he braced himself, suddenly realizing how his question just sounded. To his surprise, his mother laughed instead of whatever negative response he was expecting. Actually her laughing it off might be a bit worse.<br />
<br />
“Well, I eat a lot,” Martha said, “Mostly junk like carbs and saturated fats. I know I should be eating healthier but I could never give up this monster of a booty I got here.”<br />
<br />
“Uh huh,” Jason nodded slowly, “Umm... how... how many other people are as big as you?”<br />
<br />
“Oh a great many, actually,” Martha explained as she swept a couple dozen boxes of pasta into one of the carts, “There’s the rest of our family you know, along with probably half of the town. The pastor’s second son is a big boy, my friend Phyllis has a belly on her, and that’s just a couple of examples. Some of us are just born with the fat giant gene I suppose. Your cousin Henry, you remember him right, he’s in the same boat as you as the only little guy in the family.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, that’s... interesting,” Jason noted, “Uhh... how often would you say you’ve seen people who haven’t seen someone like you?”<br />
<br />
“Mmm, there were a few people in college who’d never seen big people like me before,” Martha supposed, “You get that sometimes, and let me tell you that they freak big time the first few meetings. Some of them pass out from... well I’m told that sometimes my gas can clear a room so that should give you a pretty good idea of what I mean.”<br />
<br />
“D-I, umm,” Jason stammered, “Y-you fart that bad? I was under the impression that women... uhh...”<br />
<br />
“Maybe little women are self conscious about that kind of thing, but us big folk?” Martha exclaimed, “Let me assure you that yes indeed I cut the cheese, and I cut the hard. I have trouble holding them in too due to my loose bowel syndrome.” Jason cringed and his face turned green. “Oh don’t worry, I get how gross it might be to think about for you. Just comes with the territory of having the gene. It makes me big, gassy, and maybe a little forgetful. One guy the other day reminded me to wash my hands after taking care of some personal business, and a bit sternly too. Guy must’ve been a neatnik or something judging by his tone.”<br />
<br />
“I... neatnik?”<br />
<br />
“Oh that’s just what little people who can’t stand big people get called sometimes,” she explained, “Too neat for their own good some people say. Some little people call us big people things like ogres or swamp things, I think this Japanese fellow called me a kaiju once, and speaking of, the fat giant gene is pretty rare in Asian countries. Not as rare as it used to be, but still. I learned all this as a city planning committee member, in case you were wondering.”<br />
<br />
“I... okay, that’s... neat,” Jason nodded, “Oh, let me get that box for you... trouble bending down, right?” As he helped his mother with the boxes of soda, he was unaware of how close to her butt he was when suddenly.<br />
<br />
*PRRRRRRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFFTTTT*<br />
<br />
He was knocked over by the force of her ass trumpet, assaulted by a scorching wind that reeked of rotten eggs and spoiled milk. He could feel his breakfast threatening to come back up.<br />
<br />
“Gah!” he gagged, “Jeez, Mom! At least warn me before you let off one of those! Holy shit, it actually pushed me over!”<br />
<br />
“Sorry sweetie!” Martha answered, “Like I said, loose bowels. I didn’t even realize I had one in me! You’re okay, right?”<br />
<br />
“I... I think so,” Jason stood up, “Geez, did you draw mud on that one or something?” Martha shimmied her huge hips, sending jiggling ripples through her cheeks.<br />
<br />
“Not that time,” Martha said, “Wouldn’t be the first time I shat my pants before. It happens a lot more often to big people than you might expect.”<br />
<br />
“So what you’re saying is that you’re about as incontinent as a toddler?” Jason asked.<br />
<br />
“Well maybe not that bad,” Martha clarified, “but you were the easiest out my kids to potty train, that’s for sure. I can make it to the toilet on a good day but it happens sometimes.”<br />
<br />
“Kinda like right now?” Jason asked with horror as he watched the seat of Martha’s mommy jeans start to swell and turn brown. On top of that she seemed to be wetting herself too as evidenced by the wet spot on her crotch.<br />
<br />
“Oh my stars! Just like right now!” Martha squealed, “You watch the carts while I find a restroom! Momma’s sprung a leak!” She hurriedly waddled away, leaving a trail of foul smelling droplets on the ground. Jason felt about ready to die from sheer force of disgust. After what felt like an eternity, Martha came back without her pants, or her underwear, which shocked Jason even more.<br />
“Yeah, I had to chuck my pants in the garbage. It’s fine, I’ve gone around bottomless before. It’s actually not as weird a thing for big people to be bottomless. Most of us only bother with pants because they’re actually comfortable not gonna lie. You okay, honey bunch?”</p>
<hr/><h3>
Is Jason okay?</h3>
