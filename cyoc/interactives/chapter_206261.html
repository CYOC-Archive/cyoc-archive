<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I wanted to detail everything that happened while we were playing, how we kissed in game and how he said we were a couple. I wanted to type it all out to him in some vain attempt to make him remember. But recounting it all was just painful, so I sent one last message.<br />
<br />
&quot;We kissed in game, and you said we were a couple.&quot;<br />
<br />
I stared at the screen, waiting for his reply. &#39;Seen&#39; being the only notification I had from Sam, no message in response, nothing. Which just made my thoughts worse. Regret struct me, worry overtaking every corner of my mind as I thought of how I might have ruined our long-lasting friendship. I no longer wanted to go to school, I no longer wanted to be anywhere. I just wanted this day to restart so I could take back that message.<br />
<br />
But I was forced to face reality as the door to my room opened. My father entering in his usual suit and tie, he worked for some energy company and was rarely home. Working until 8 and leaving by 6 in the morning. I didn&#39;t ever really see him, and now he was seeing me at my worst state.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mum&#39;s gone out, so be sure to lock the front door when you leave.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay dad...&quot;<br />
<br />
I wanted to seem fine to him, but my voice came out weak and my father&#39;s face was tinged with concern. Forehead scrunched and neutral expression turned to a frown. His hand scratching at his beard as he looked me up and down, walking to the side of my bed and sitting on the edge of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ray, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nothing. I&#39;m fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
I choke up, it was all rushing back to me. Did I mistake everything that happened yesterday? Did I ruin my friendship? Sam never hit on me before, but I was always secretly hoping he would. I was too scared to make a move, I didn&#39;t want to ruin what we had and now I had ruined it. <br />
<br />
Dad brought his arms around me as I cried. Telling me that whatever happened, it will be alright. I couldn&#39;t get the words out to explain, I was too overwhelmed by it all as he helped me dry my tears and calm myself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad... Sam and me. We started dating, I thought we did at least but... he said he doesn&#39;t remember it. Now he&#39;s ignoring my messages and I&#39;m worried I&#39;ve ruined everything.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sam did that? He&#39;s been your best friend for years. He wouldn&#39;t drop you all of a sudden.&quot;<br />
&quot;But... he isn&#39;t replying.&quot;<br />
&quot;He might be hurrying off to school, or thinking about what you&#39;ve said. We don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on in his head, Ray.&quot;<br />
<br />
That small bit of hope was enough to break me out of this stupor. Maybe I am overreacting, maybe it is fine.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll find out at school.&quot;<br />
&quot;If he is mean to you or you feel down, give me a call alright?&quot;<br />
&quot;But you&#39;ll be working.&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;re more important than any work.&quot;<br />
<br />
His hug tightens, I wrap my own arms around him in response. More than happy to have my father here. Letting him help me calm down completely, until I let out an involuntary yelp of pain. Something hard and metallic pressing against my back, as dad backs away suddenly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, almost forgot I had this on.&quot;<br />
<br />
He rolls up his sleeve, showing a bracelet on his arm. The same one any player of &#39;Reborn Venture&#39; would have. Wait... dad&#39;s playing the game? I was so surprised I couldn&#39;t speak, which caused him to more hurriedly explain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t tell your mother about this! She&#39;d make my sleep on the couch for weeks if she ever found out I was gaming with friends over being with her!&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;re... playing the game too? How&#39;d you get into it?&quot;<br />
&quot;I always liked playing games, just didn&#39;t have the time for it. But my manager gave everyone in the company a copy.&quot;<br />
&quot;Weird, why&#39;d he do that?&quot;<br />
&quot;Part of a new health and wellbeing program. A lot of corporations have rolled it out and gotten in boxes of the VR sets. Apparently, it helps you relax, promotes expression of self or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
He looks partially embarrassed as he quickly adds.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just think it&#39;s a fun game. We play it at lunch and after hours, it&#39;s become huge in the office. Productivities gone way down, but since the managers are into it no one&#39;s complaining!&quot;<br />
&quot;Geeze, another reason for me to drop out of school and start working.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hah! Your body&#39;s almost in working shape. Did I ever teach you how to shave? Might finally be the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
I look at a nearby mirror, my previously weak and thin body now packing the early signs of muscle growth. Slight definition in my abs and arms. Body a few inches taller than the night before, and chin covered in short bristly hairs. I should be more than shocked at the insane growth spurt I was experiencing, but the bracelet helped me to relax and accept it.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if I don&#39;t want to shave?&quot;<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t force you. Your mother though...&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of us chuckle, dad patting me on the back and standing from the bed. Looking to his phone for the time, eyes going wide as he quickly heads for the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember, call me if you need me! I&#39;ll call in sick if I have to.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks dad!&quot;<br />
<br />
I call back, looking over to my own phone to see a new message from Sam. My heart sinks, but I am too curious to ignore what it says. Just opening up the message to read whatever words are written.<br />
<br />
&quot;Meet me outside the school gate.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay, I will.&quot;<br />
<br />
I write back before looking at the time. 7:10, I need to be out of here. I go to the shower. Wash up. Get changed. Lock up the house. Run down the streets. I should be out of breath at this point, but my new and fit body perseveres. Letting me jog past the houses and to the school gates, before I rest against the walls and catch my breath. Sam is already here, walking over to me as I recover from the strenuous activity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, didn&#39;t have to run just to see me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Flirting again... did he remember?<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, let&#39;s go somewhere quiet and talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
He leads me off into the school and down the halls. Stepping into our classroom which is still empty at this early hour. Sitting me down at a desk on the back, and then passing me his phone. It&#39;s on the &#39;Reborn Venture&#39; homepage, where there&#39;s an emergency maintenance notice.<br />
<br />
&#39;We apologise for the inconvenience. Reborn Venture will be down for Emergency Maintenace from 8:00 AM - 10:00 AM (Local Time). A fault in the bracelets initial design was identified which would cause damaged devices to display incorrect feedback to and from the server. This was due to the inbuilt inhibitor malfunctioning and misrepresenting the actions of other players. To correct this mistake, we are lowering the inhibitor&#39;s intensity on all devices and adjusting the servers appropriately. <br />
<br />
This decision was done due to a belief that the damaged devices provided a more realistic and interesting experience that we should have always strived for. We hope that this new update will bring further joys to our players lives inside and outside the game.&#39;<br />
<br />
My cheeks turned bright red as I stared at my cracked bracelet. I... made all that up? So, Sam was never interested in me? I can&#39;t look him in the eyes, but he tries to look in mine. At first twisting and turning his head as I turn away. Until his attempts turn comical, Sam dropping to the part of the floor I am staring at, and I can&#39;t help but laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;So. You thought we were dating?&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s what I saw. You kissed me, held me, said we were a couple. All in game so... it didn&#39;t happen right?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nope. But would you hate it if it did happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
I froze. Is... is he really flirting with me? He stands from the ground, lowering to bring his face near mine. Lips suddenly locked, the two of us in an embrace as he wrapped his arms around me. Whatever doubt I previously had going away. Maybe it wasn&#39;t real the first time, but this one had to be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sam, I didn&#39;t know you were into me... or even gay.&quot;<br />
&quot;Bi, and you&#39;ve seen me staring at shirtless guys before.&quot;<br />
&quot;I just thought you wanted to be like them.&quot;<br />
&quot;I mean, yeah. I do. But I&#39;m also into them... Shit, one thing Ray.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam turns serious. Eyes filled with worry as he switches from looking to me and looking to the classroom door.<br />
<br />
&quot;My parents don&#39;t know I&#39;m Bi. They&#39;ll kick me out of the house if they find out.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite years of being friends, I didn&#39;t really know his parents. My family hated them, and we usually hung out at my place. But I always felt uncomfortable around them. They were very direct, and very demanding. I wasn&#39;t too surprised to find out that was how they felt, it only made me more concerned for Sam as he took a seat in front of me and readied himself for class. <br />
<br />
The bell rung shortly after, with more students piling into the room. A lot of whom looked different than I remembered. Some were taller, others shorter. Some fatter, others thinner. But despite the changes, no one commented on them. Everyone just treated it as normal, myself included as I waited and waited for the teacher. Idly talking with Sam as we started to wonder what was going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Attention all students. Due to a shortage of teachers, we will be doing mixed activities all day.&quot;<br />
<br />
The announcer listed the various classes and assigned them a teacher, ours was Coach Sullivan who the classroom eagerly awaited. I could hear the other students whispering praise about the Coach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, I encountered him last night, he kicked my ass!&quot; A student calls out.<br />
&quot;&#39;He got me on the first day, love the coach so much now!&quot; Another adds in, this boy showing muscular gains far past his age. Arms covered in thick hairs and voice almost <br />
gravelly.<br />
&quot;Yeah, he&#39;s sick. I&#39;m so close to escaping his prison though, maybe tonight I&#39;ll get to rematch him.&quot; Adds in a female classmate of mine, the brawny boy from earlier laughing and adding.<br />
&quot;Nah, ain&#39;t going to happen. You&#39;ll be recruited by Coach.&quot;<br />
<br />
As his name is said one last time, Sullivan enters the room. I swear he looks a bit younger than before, passing as a man in his mid-thirties with a barrel like physique. Arms surprisingly defined in contrast to his thick chest and flabby pecs. The coach&#39;s presence still friendly, but with an almost domineering aspect to it now. All of the students that were singing his praises wait for him to speak, while the rest of us feel almost intimidated by the man.<br />
<br />
&quot;School&#39;s given me free reign for the day. We&#39;ve got the gym, so we&#39;ll do some laps and sport then end the day early.&quot;<br />
<br />
No one dares to question him. Leaving in a line and getting changed into our sports gear. We run laps for the coach and switching between a few games, until two hours pass. Coach calling out to us all the moment the school bell rings for 10.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s enough for today. Go home and have fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
There&#39;s a wave of movement, everyone leaving for the halls. Sam and I included as we reach our lockers and see the halls filled with students. My friend giving me a mischievous grin as the area quickly empties.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess Maintenance is over.&quot;</p>
