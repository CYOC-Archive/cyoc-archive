<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul knew that he couldn't go to the Troop Weekend like this. It would put off all of the other guys...he would have to sneak up to the camp site without them knowing...<br />
<br />
He called on the Friday before claiming he wasn't feeling well and that he wouldn't be able to attend. His Scout Leader told him it was okay and he hoped Paul would feel better soon. Paul got Michael to drive him up to the Camp Site on the Staurday morning. On the last bend before the camp, Paul spotted a small lake. &quot;Stop here, this'll be fine...&quot; he told Michael. After parking the car, they hid behind some bushes on one side of the lake and waited.<br />
<br />
After the Scouts had arrived, they were told they were allowed to have some free time and to be back in a few hours. The Scouts ran off in all directions to have some fun. Paul and Michael watched as 4 of the Scouts came their way. Paul recognised them as Peter, Alex, Kieran and Greg and they were all straight and from his former scout group, and all around 16 years old. He smiled and told this to Michael who nodded and put his finger to his lips to tell Paul to be quiet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit it's hot,&quot; complained Alex.<br />
&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; agreed Greg.<br />
&quot;Hey, why don't we go for a swim in this lake? It's so fucking hot today,&quot; Kieran asked.<br />
&quot;Because we don't have any bathers to wear dumb ass,&quot; replied Peter.<br />
&quot;We'll just go naked. Unless one of you guys is a fag, I don't give a shit,&quot; said Kieran as he began to take off his uniform. Not wanting to appear gay, the other 3 also began to slip out of their clothes and they all ran into the lake, just as Paul and Michael had hoped.<br />
&quot;Come on,&quot; Paul told Michael. The two Speedo Fags crept up to where the 4 boys' clothes lay. They gathered them together and ran back into the bushes without the boys noticing. They threw all of the clothes into the forest, except for their underwear and boxer shorts.<br />
<br />
Michael and Paul both grabbed two pairs of the underwear and shoved them down the front of their Speedos for a minute, then pulled them out and threw them back to where the boys had originally left their uniforms. After about half an hour, the boys left the lake, and walked back to where they had stripped off.<br />
&quot;Hey, where are all our clothes?&quot; asked Greg.<br />
&quot;I dunno, our boxers and undies are still here...&quot; replied Kieran.<br />
&quot;Come on, let's just put them on and have a look around. If any of the guys saw us like this, we'd be screwed,&quot; said Alex.<br />
So the boys each grabbed their piece of underwear; Kieran and Peter were wearing blue and green boxer shorts respectively, and Alex and Greg were wearing slightly baggy underwear, black and yellow respectively. Michael and Paul smiled at this, and then headed back to the car, they had agreed earlier to help David change some of his straight cop buddies after they were done with the camp. <br />
<br />
The boys didn't notice that their underwear was gradually changing a faint red color as they searched for their uniforms. Greg found that he would stop every minute or so and look at Peter's ass and he had to pinch himself so he would continue to look for the clothes. Kieran streched his arms in the air and had a look around. Suddenly, he felt something rubbing gently across his balls. He looked down and saw that his boxers looked a little bit smaller, but he didn't really care, as he was more concerned about his other clothes. That was when Kieran heard Alex whisper from behind &quot;You have got to see this, it so is fucking disgusting&quot;. So Kieran followed Alex through the bush for a little bit until he saw two guys on the ground kissing each other. It was Greg and Peter! Kieran noticed that Peter's green boxer shorts seemed to be shrinking, but he was distracted with the thought of why would he be looking at his friend's dick? Then he saw something strange with Greg's yellow underwear; it was now more of an orange. He opened his mouth to say something, but he heard someone calling in the distance. &quot;Kieran? Peter? Alex? Greg?&quot; It was their scout leader, they obviously been away for too long and were being looked for.<br />
<br />
The two guys on the ground suddenly broke apart. &quot;What the hell was that?&quot; moaned Peter. &quot;I dunno, I just...couldn't help myslef for a second or something. I don't know what came over us...&quot; said a horrified Greg. &quot;Come on, Nick's here to take us back, let's just get the hell out of here,&quot; said Alex. The 4 walked to Nick, the Scout Leader, still in their underwear. &quot;What the hell were you guys doing?&quot; he asked with amusement. &quot;N..nothing...our clothes were stolen or something...&quot; said Kieran.<br />
&quot;Get in the ute, I'll take you back to camp,&quot; said Nick.<br />
They all clambered in, and then Kieran noticed something else with his boxers; they were red and were the size of a brief and had a strange spandex feel to them! And he could just make out a Speedo symbol in the corner. What was happening? He looked around to see if any of the other guys had noticed, but they were busy with their own problems; each of them too was also wearing a tight red Speedo now as well. Nick was outside checking something with the car. Kieran continued to watch in amazement as his chest became a tight 6 pack and the hairs on his chest faded away. His leg hair too also disappeared. He felt himself growing in his seat a little and he found his ass was rubbing against Peter’s, who was sitting next to him. He tried to shift along a little for some room, but Peter moved closed and smiled at him. Kieran was astonished to find he was smiling back at this hunk…hunk? He never thought like that before…he reached out his muscly arm and stroked Peter’s face and moved it down to his chest and began to move it down towards Peter’s well filled Speedo, but the car door opened and Nick jumped in. Kieran looked up and noticed Alex and Greg also had their hands on each other with large boners in their tight Red Speedos.<br />
<br />
They all smiled cheekily at each other and then looked over at Nick, who was about to start up the ute. Alex, who was sitting behind Nick, wrapped his arms around the chair and held down Nick’s head.<br />
“What are you doing?” Nick asked with a laugh. Kieran climbed into the front seat and began to lick Nick’s handsome face. “Stop it, or you are all in deep shit!” Nick said angrily now. Alex began to lick Nick’s ears; Greg came in from the door and began to kiss Nick’s cheek; Kieran continued licking his face and Peter started to rub his chest. Nick tried to pull away, but Alex was holding him too strong. Kieran moved his tongue into Nick’s mouth and forced it down Nick’s throat. Nick made a frightened sound from his mouth, but it changed quickly into a moan. Peter tugged apart Nick’s shirt to reveal a muscly hairless, tanned chest and then lay upon it moaning. Nick tilted his head backwards as Greg licked his neck. There was a loud sound from below; Nick’s shorts were pulling apart. His belt snapped off and his zipper tugged all the way down instantly, revealing another tight Red Speedo below. The shorts broke apart and they all got up and ran out of the car and began to roll through the bushes kissing each other and rubbing each other’s hard penis through their Speedos. This was so fucking good. They had to go back to camp to show the others how good this felt.</p>
