<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I felt all the primal urges of a hungry wolf, but I was also in complete control of those urges.  Already I <br />
felt the positive effects of my wish to keep control.  I staggered forward a few steps.  I was slightly unsure <br />
and clumsy as I walked with my altered feet.  In order to get used to them I walked in a small circle until I <br />
felt more sure of myself.  I took a few steps forward and then happened to glance back.  I saw the tattered <br />
remains of my clothes and shoes.  Just to be on the safe side, I wished they would disappear.  The ring <br />
obliged my wish and the clothes were gone.<br />
<br />
I continued deeper into the woods to see what I might find.  My altered ears picked up the sound of sticks and <br />
underbrush being trampled.  The sound was very close and getting closer.  I stopped moving so that I could <br />
pinpoint the exact location from where the sound came.  I could also smell something getting closer.  <br />
<br />
I turned my head to the right just in time to see a deer emerge from a row of thickets.  The deer caught sight <br />
of me but did not move.  I could see, and I could smell, that the deer was a male.  He just continued to stare <br />
at me.  Instinctively I snarled at him and bared my full set of fangs.  The deer did not react so I let out a <br />
full blown howl at him.  The deer then broke its stare with me but rather than running away from me, it just <br />
took a few steps away from me.<br />
<br />
Then I realized why the deer did not feel threatened.  I had wished for the animals of the woods to not look <br />
at me as a threat.  So the deer had no reason to see my as dangerous.  Time to amend my wish, I thought.  I <br />
wished that when I was in regular human/vampire form no animal would feel threatened, but that when I was in <br />
wolf form animals would rightly look at me as a predator and a threat.<br />
<br />
The deer stopped moving, as if it sensed something new and threatening.  I snarled at it again.  Without even <br />
looking back at me, the deer ran off as fast it could.  This was just the challenge I desired.  I ran after <br />
the deer with all possible speed.  I found that I could run faster than I ever had as a human.  This did not <br />
surprise me.  What did surprise me is that I already seemed very adept and agile in this form.  The deer used <br />
its benefits of four legs to bound in any direction it wished.  But even with only two legs, the way my wolf <br />
body was built, I found that I was able to keep pace.<br />
<br />
I realized that I was gaining ground on the deer.  It was doing its best to lose me, as it twisted and turned <br />
in different directions.  However, I was able to anticipate its changes in direction.  The distance between us <br />
steadily narrowed.  Soon I was right on the deer’s tail.  Without thinking I leapt high into the air.  I found <br />
myself seemingly floating in the air right above the deer.  I reached out with my arms and grabbed the deer by <br />
its antlers.  The deer jerked back in reaction but my grip of it did not loosen.  I was able to wrest the deer <br />
to the ground.  Before it could attempt to return to its feet I pounced on top of it.  I let the animal in me <br />
have full control as I sank my teeth into the deer’s neck and throat.<br />
<br />
The poor deer let out a sound that, had I been thinking like a normal human, would have frightened the wits <br />
out of me.  Since I had let my animal urges take control, however, I thought nothing of it.  The deer did not <br />
suffer as my powerful teeth quickly brought about its end.  Instead of ripping the deer to shreds I found that <br />
I was only interested in tasting its blood.  Having never exactly tasted blood before I could not say what it <br />
was like, except that it was different.  <br />
<br />
I spent several minutes drinking from the deer’s corpse.  I decided that I’d had enough.  I stood over my <br />
fallen prey and looked at the dead beast.  It was a gruesome, yet pathetic scene.  The deer’s mouth hung open, <br />
stuck in screaming that horrible sound.  Its eyes seemed to stare at me as if to ask why, as if it knew that I <br />
was not a natural predator and had used it for mere sport.<br />
<br />
The animal urges subsided and I found human reason taking over again.  I suddenly felt ashamed of what I’d <br />
done.  I had to say that this was against my original intention.  My point in making myself was a vampire was <br />
to prey upon others.  It occurred to me, however, that I wanted to prey upon people, not animals.  I felt that <br />
animals were innocent and people were not.  <br />
<br />
I caved into my feelings of humanity.  I wished that the deer was alive and completely unharmed.  I backed <br />
away as the wounds on the deer were instantly repaired and it rose back to its feet.  The deer did not <br />
immediately run away.  It looked around, as if it knew it had been dead and now wondered how it could be <br />
alive.  It caught sight of me and, again, it did not run away.  It cocked its head at me, further making me <br />
believe it knew it had been brought back to life.  I raised my hand and pointed away from me.  “Go,” I growled <br />
at it.  That was all the encouragement the deer needed.  It bounded away from me just as fast it could.</p>
