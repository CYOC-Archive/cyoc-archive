<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It&#39;d been a few days since her foster brother had been caught wearing girl&#39;s clothes, and if he still was, Denise didn&#39;t know. What she did know was her he’d started seeing a psychiatrist, though, for what, she wasn&#39;t told, but had her suspicions. In addition, she&#39;d began to seriously map out how much she&#39;d change him and at what points she&#39;d use the Chronivac to make them, and in the process discovered a slight hiccough.<br />
<br />
This lay in how long she planned to transform Jon. If she had it worked out, she&#39;d never finish, until sometime after she turned eighteen, aged out of the system and went off to college. This was a guarantee, as she at last received a letter of acceptance from the institute of higher learning she figured she would, which was the local community college, and having submitted the final paper work, including for grants and scholarships, she was now just waiting to hear back about whether she qualified for assistance to pay for college. But, in the meantime, she had another worry, mainly Jon&#39;s transformation.<br />
<br />
Of course, she knew she could set a timer on the Chronivac, input the desired changes, and let everything take its course. But, the thing with this was, she wanted to watch him become a girl. She wanted to see how he&#39;d react and what he&#39;d try to do, if anything, to stop what was happening, as well as to know if making him female would have any lasting impacts, which she suspected it might, as she&#39;d already noticed slight shifts in the way he behaved. In addition, she still wanted to use the Chronivac on Billy, as, in her opinion, he also deserved the same thing as her foster brother. Thinking over what sort of girl she might make Billy into, having a possible idea of two, Denise tried to come up with a solution the problem where she could still turn Jon into a girl, whilst, at the same time, watch it happen.<br />
<br />
The simplest solution she decided after a day or so was to use the Chronivac on herself. Leery about this, not sure what the consequences of doing this might be, Denise also couldn’t decide how she might use the software on to allow it for her to be around to initiate Jon into the world of being a girl as well as watch it happening. Taking the disk and emitter down to the living room, seeing she had some time before the Parkers came home, and Jon was at a meeting with his doctor, she booted up the computer, inserted the disk and double-clicked the icon for the Chronivac. Watching as it pulled up the only profile available, she took a deep breath and hoping she wasn&#39;t making a mistake, she aimed the remote at herself and had it scan her. Completed, she plugged in the device via the USB cable it came with, which caused Jon&#39;s profile to vanish and her&#39;s to appear.<br />
<br />
With a series of taps, she minimised the screen and after a bit of searching, located and pulled up the other profile. Satisfied she could retrieve it and hadn&#39;t lost it, as she was still considering turning Jon back after a bit, she pulled back up her profile and started going through it.<br />
<br />
Option upon option available, she clicked, scrolled, pulled up dialogue boxes, pulled down menus, all as she looked for a clue as to how she might use the software to allow her to do what she wanted. Mulling over the situation as she did, she ceased what she was doing after a bit, and certain of one thing, she shifted the awareness to any changes she might make so only she would know about them. Not wanting a repeat of her first mistake, where everyone knew what was happening to Jon, just not why, she reclined back in the office chair and stared at the computer screen. Reading the things available to her, she reached out to move the mouse, causing the readout on the screen to jump and new data to be displayed. Seeing how it displayed her age, she thought, &quot;There&#39;s the problem. But how do I fix it,&quot; and leaning forward, an idea forming, she moved the cursor.<br />
<br />
The information on her profile scrolling, she soon reached the section which listed her birthday. Seeing it wasn&#39;t greyed out like some other things were, she clicked on it. A pop-up appeared and with a series of clicks, she reassigned her birthday. Closing this, she went back to her age, seeing she was now a year younger, with her seventeenth birthday in late August instead of her eighteenth, Denise smiled.<br />
<br />
Certain she had fixed the problem, knowing it&#39;d mean another year in the foster system, she didn&#39;t care, as long as she remained with the Parkers. Another idea coming to her, she began searching her profile for specific details, and within moments, she&#39;d deleted her birth parents and set it so she was the daughter of George and Sophia Parker. Feeling confident she was solving a number of other issues, she scrolled through her profile, tightening as much of the details as she could, all so she could make it so the Parkers were now her parents and she was sixteen and about to turn seventeen in two months.<br />
<br />
Finished, she saved the new information, and after taking a deep breath, hoping she wasn&#39;t making a mistake, Denise initiated the changes. Unsure of what to expect, she was caught off guard when it suddenly felt as if she&#39;d been doused with something cold. A pressure building in her head, she couldn&#39;t help herself as she squeezed her eyes shut as memories faded and were replaced by new ones. And as her age slipped backward by one year, reality around her shifted as pictures redesigned themselves to suddenly display a happy girl growing up over the years, as well as a family of three, sometimes more if her foster brothers and sister ever wanted to be part of the photoshoot. The house rearranging to accompany this new reality, the transformation lasted no more than about eight to nine minutes before, eyes opening, Denise looked around the living room.<br />
<br />
The first thing she saw were the photographs of her, her parents, the foster brothers and sisters she had known over the years, and remembering events of birthdays, holidays, going to see family for Christmas and Easter, among other things, Denise quickly turned back to the computer. Closing the Chronivac, ejecting the emitter and disc, she put the computer into sleep mode. Collecting her things, she stood and hurried out the room, eager to see what other differences awaited her.</p>
