<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">June trudged through the jungle, each step accompanied by the now-familiar sloshing of her swollen belly and the constant, rhythmic sway of her tail. Her body had settled into a new rhythm after the days spent in her haze—larger, more unwieldy, but somehow, she was beginning to accept it. Yet as she walked, she began to notice more subtle changes, things that hadn’t immediately been obvious when she first woke up.<br />
<br />
Her hair, once short and manageable, had grown long and thick, falling in heavy waves down her back. She could feel its weight now, the way it clung to her neck and shoulders in the humid jungle air. Every breeze sent it fluttering around her face, making her aware of just how much it had grown. She gathered it into a loose braid, but even that didn’t keep it fully contained.<br />
<br />
As she moved, her arms brushed against her sides, and she realized with a start that thick patches of hair had grown under her arms, something that had never happened before. She lifted her arm experimentally, running her fingers through the dark hair there, feeling the strange roughness of it against her skin. It wasn’t just her armpits, either. Her pubic hair had grown considerably, now a thick, dark patch that she could feel every time her thighs brushed together. her thick pubic hair did help her legs from chaffing as she walked, a nice change.<br />
<br />
But the most shocking change revealed itself when June stopped to relieve herself. She found a quiet spot, far from the path, and squatted down. As she did, the sensation in her lower body felt different—larger, more expansive. When she finished and turned to look, she gasped. The pile of waste behind her was... enormous. Far more than anything she had ever produced before. Her face flushed as she realized what had happened—her anus, like the rest of her, had grown larger, accommodating her expanding body in ways she hadn’t even considered. June awkwardly set her mirror down and bent over to examine her butthole. she had to use her hands to spread her fat butt  cheeks apart, long dark hairs poking out the crack till she spread her butt wide enough to see her anus, now as big as a bagel. it twitched and glisened from her sweat. she carefully touched it with a finger sending shivers down her spine. <br />
<br />
June stared at her butt for a moment, shocked and embarrassed. But as the initial wave of disbelief passed, she couldn’t help but feel a strange sense of fascination. Her body was transforming in ways she never could have predicted. Each change, no matter how bizarre, seemed to push her further away from the person she had been before, yet somehow, she was beginning to embrace it.<br />
<br />
Her breasts, which had been steadily leaking milk since her haze, were now perpetually dribbling. The warm liquid flowed freely down her chest, soaking into her already damp robes. It was oddly comforting to let it flow without restriction, the pressure in her chest easing with every drop. She no longer felt the need to milk herself as often—the leaking took care of that on its own, and she found herself enjoying the sensation of the milk gently running down her skin.<br />
<br />
As she walked, lost in thought and adjusting to the constant changes in her body, June barely noticed her surroundings. It wasn’t until she nearly stumbled over a crumbling stone that she realized she had wandered directly into the ruins she had been searching for.<br />
<br />
The ancient city lay before her, its moss-covered stone structures rising from the jungle like the bones of some long-dead beast. Vines twisted through the cracked walls, and trees had grown up through the streets, reclaiming the city for nature. The ruins were silent, save for the occasional chirp of birds or the rustle of leaves in the breeze.<br />
<br />
June blinked, surprised at her own carelessness. She hadn’t been paying attention, too absorbed in the changes her body had undergone to notice the landmarks she had been searching for. But now that she was here, standing on the edge of this forgotten place, excitement surged through her.<br />
<br />
She quickly made camp at the entrance to the ruins, her mind buzzing with possibilities. As she settled into her small shelter, she leaned back and let out a deep sigh, her hands drifting down to her swollen fupa. Her fingers traced the tender skin, feeling the faint dots of the teats beneath the surface. She rubbed gently, her mind wandering as she thought about what the ruins might hold.<br />
<br />
Would she find treasure? Ancient knowledge? More magical artifacts like the *Jug of Alchemy*? She wasn’t sure, but a part of her, deep down, was curious about how these new changes might tie into whatever she discovered here.<br />
<br />
June’s fingers continued their gentle massage, her body relaxing as she imagined what might come next. Her tail swished lazily behind her, her breasts continuing their soft, steady leak of milk. For the first time since the transformations had begun, she felt a strange sense of peace. Her body, as foreign as it had become, was hers. And perhaps, whatever she found in the ruins would only deepen her understanding of what she was turning into.</p>
