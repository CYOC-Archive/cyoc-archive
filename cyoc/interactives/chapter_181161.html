<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Who the hell are you?” Donna demanded the second Janette returned from her blissful date. She hadn’t seen the woman who walked into the apartment before with hair that looked like it was made of moonlight and eyes so beautifully icy they made even her straight heart flutter in love. There was something unnatural about the stranger, and that was beyond the fact she was dressed like a LARPer.<br />
<br />
“I just had the most wonderful night,” Janette sighed with a dreamy look in her eyes. She looked like something out of a dream, something mystical and slightly inhuman. “Mason kissed me.”<br />
<br />
“Mason? Wait, Janette?!” Donna demanded with her eyes widening. “What happened to you? Why do you look like that?!”<br />
<br />
Janette blinked and looked down before glancing at Donna in confusion. “What do you mean?”<br />
<br />
“First off, you’re blonde, second off you’re dressed like a cross between a fantasy princess and a swordsman, and thirdly you don’t even look like you,” Donna listed.<br />
<br />
“Oh silly Donna, I’ve always looked like this,” Janette replied with a wave of her hand before Donna grabbed her wrist and dragged her into the gloomy confines of her bedroom. It didn’t take her long to figure out someone had been messing with her stuff, specifically the book she kept under her bed filled with all sorts of “potions”. They were all placebo effects and herbal remedies, but it was clear someone had disturbed the tome and judging by Janette’s appearance something in that book was really magical.<br />
<br />
“I have no idea what you did, but you somehow botched an herbal remedy and discovered real magic,” Donna grumbled as she tried to figure out which page her roommate had touched.<br />
<br />
“You’re the witch,” Janette yawned, her voice so airy and cute it made Donna suddenly realize she might just be bisexual. “You’ll know the answer.”<br />
<br />
At her words the pages in that old book shimmered like a mirage and when it cleared Donna was staring in shock at a book filled with very intricate and strange directions. She slapped the book shut and stared at the cover. “Advanced basic witchcraft vol. 6...” she read with wide eyes before dropping the book. “What did you do?!”<br />
<br />
“What did I do?” Janette asked innocently, god her voice was so cute.<br />
<br />
Donna was about to reply when she noticed more had changed. Her clothes, they’d turned from a stylish top and torn up jeans into a dress. She had long sleeves with big openings near her wrists, dark leggings that fell into boots that rode up to her knees, and as she watched the fabric opened up on her shoulders and neckline presenting a healthy amount of bust and her tattooed shoulders. She quickly pulled that dress up and over her head, stripping down naked to get the garments off her. It was a chain reaction, the last thing she needed was whatever spell was on Janette spreading to her too.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately Janette was oblivious to her power.<br />
<br />
“I like your tattoos,” she commented and suddenly all the imagery she’d paid hundreds for since escaping her strict mother warped into intricate symbols that wrapped around her arms, shoulders, back, and down her legs. There was no removing her tattoos and she could only watch as her skin got paler, her breasts puffed up a little, and her curves got far more alluring.<br />
<br />
Her dyed black hair became truly black right down to her DNA. Black as the darkest sky at midnight and her eyes shifted from green to an unnatural purple hue. Then it happened, her tattoos started to glow, she stepped back fearfully and accidentally lit a fire on her hand.<br />
<br />
It was a ghastly blue colour and didn’t burn her, and it left the faint scent of burned incense in the air. Donna stared at her hand in shock before a shockwave erupted form her body and her entire bedroom shifted. The floor turned to stone, the books on the bookshelves got older and hand bound, and her clothing all changed into all sorts of fantastical black dresses and outfits that she just wanted to wear, she wanted to feel that fantasy fabric on her body.<br />
<br />
“I’m a witch,” she stammered as her room expanded, a second room forming with a huge cauldron bubbling over a fireplace, cabinets filled with strange ingredients, and tables and more bookshelves, so many bookshelves.<br />
<br />
“Of course, now what did you need me for again?” Janette asked in that voice, that sexy sexy voice. Oh why did she have to be in love with Mason?<br />
<br />
“Um...” Donna trailed, gazing over her rocking naked witchy body and finding her gaze on the book. There was a spell for mind control there, and she bit her lip, glanced at Janette, and shouted out the words while aiming her hands at her roommate.<br />
<br />
Janette’s gaze went blank, her sexy eyes staring at nothing and Donna bit her lip, knowing exactly what she wanted.<br />
<br />
“I want you to get naked,” Donna requested and much to her excitement Janette stood up and began to strip. “Um... go slower!”<br />
<br />
Janette indeed slowed down. She drew her pants down in a slow sexual manner, she then lifted her top in a way that made Donna’s heart pound, breasts dropping once they were free from that shirt and bouncing in their bra. Janette then slipped out of her underwear but by bit until she too stood naked in that room. She looked even better nude. Donna wanted to fuck her so bad, and hey she had Janette under her control so why not?<br />
<br />
“Make love to me,” she ordered and Janette blinked, taking on a sexy look in her eyes and grabbed Donna by the shoulder, pushing her down onto the bed, fingers entering her vagina and beginning to feel around.<br />
<br />
It was blissful, Janette was an expert, her tongue scraping out every inch of Donna’s vagina, her soft breasts jigging and pressing into Donna’s own, and her sensual fingers finding every pleasurable spot across Donna’s skin. They kissed, Donna got her turn to slurp up Janette’s vaginal juices, and they cuddled. Janette was a hazy bunch of smiles but Donna was in pure ecstasy.<br />
<br />
“I think I might be lesbian now,” she announced while Janette cuddled up against her. A frown formed on Donna’s face as she watched her cuddle bug lightly rest her head against her breast. “If only Mason wasn’t in the way...”<br />
<br />
Her gaze then found her immense collection of spell books, which she assumed all worked.<br />
<br />
“Maybe I can get him out of the way,” she grinned, placing a hand on Janette’s side and wishing the mind control spell could last forever.</p>
