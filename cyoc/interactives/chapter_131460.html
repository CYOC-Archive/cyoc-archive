<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake looks up and was shocked to find that his mom now had a man’s face and head on her otherwise female body. Also to Jake’s shock and bewilderment, the blouse she was wearing was completely unbuttoned. A brief glimpse at her chest confirmed that she still had boobs but significantly smaller than Jake would have assumed. But the most alarming thing was the (handsome?) man’s face his mother sported.<br />
<br />
“Are you okay, sweetie?” Jake’s mom asked in a surprisingly deep voice. For some reason, Jake felt a little strange hearing that voice.<br />
<br />
“Uh…yeah,” Jake replied, breaking eye contact with her. “I’m still a little tired is all.”<br />
<br />
“Well, okay,” she replied. She turned away from him. “You better get a move on. Paul will be here any minute to pick you up.” She then took off the blouse and dropped it on the floor as she was walking away from him.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Jake said slowly, staring at the discarded blouse.<br />
<br />
“MOOOM!” a young male voice shouted from upstairs. Jake did not recognize the voice.<br />
<br />
“What is it, Eric?” Jake’s mom called back. Jake frowned. Eric? Who’s–? Jake’s eyes widened. As in Erica?! Did the same thing happen to her, too?<br />
<br />
“I can’t find any pants up here!” the voice called back.<br />
<br />
“I’ll be right up, dear!” Jake’s masculine mom said. She shook her head. “Honestly, you and your brother’s hangups about pants make no sense to me. Your father and uncle don’t ever wear pants.” She ascended the stairs. “Anyway, have a good day at school, Jake!”<br />
<br />
Jake snapped out of his daze and moved to pick up his mom’s blouse, saying, “Mom!” He stopped. The blouse slowly disintegrated into thin air, as if it never existed in the first place. He looked up at his mom. She had gotten taller, too. She was looking at him expectedly.<br />
<br />
“Uh…thanks,” Jake quickly said. “I will. See you tonight.” He grabbed his bag and quickly made for the front door. He opened the door just in time to see his Uncle Daniel pull into the driveway.<br />
<br />
“No need to lock it up, Jake!” he called out. “I’m about to head in.” He stepped out of his truck and walked towards the door. His uncle was dressed in a navy suit jacket, dark blue shirt, navy necktie, black socks and shoes,…and dark red underwear briefs. Jake was too stunned to say anything. Uncle Daniel walked up to him and without so much as another word planted his lips directly on Jake’s. Jake broke the kiss almost immediately and stared at his uncle, stunned. His uncle was completely oblivious to the look on Jake’s face.<br />
<br />
“Thanks for holding the door, boy,” Uncle Daniel said to him. “You really know how to obey orders from older men.” He laughed. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, if I hurry, my brother-in-law and I can get a quick fuck before heading into work.”<br />
<br />
With that, he went into the house and shut the front door. Jake stood motionless on the front steps, trying to process what was happening. Why were his mom and sister slowly turning into guys? Why did his uncle just kiss him? Why did his uncle say such sexy things to him about what he was going to do to his dad? Jake shook his head in surprise. And why was he finding all of this gay stuff to be sexy? He wasn’t gay. He had been wanting to ask that cheerleader Amanda out on a date. He glanced over at his neighbor’s house.<br />
<br />
He immediately regretted it. There, on the front porch, was his older neighbor Dave sucking the mailman’s dick in broad daylight. The mailman was completely clothed, but Dave was only wearing dress pants. The mailman’s own mouth wasn’t busy either. He was making out with a very hirsute man with long, flowing red hair wearing a torn dress. The man came up for air, and Jake nearly gasped. The man still had a woman’s head. Jake recognized the woman’s face as Gloria, Dave’s devout wife for nearly 40 years. They were incredibly religious too so seeing this was incredibly bizarre. And hot.<br />
<br />
Jake shook his head again, unknowingly removing his hand from rubbing his crotch. What was happening? It’s like the entire world has turned into some crazy gay sex nightmare, and Jake was just along for the ride.<br />
<br />
“I can transform the entire world,” a voice echoed in his mind.<br />
<br />
“The stupid curse,” Jake said to himself, shocked. So whoever had called him wasn’t lying when they said that the curse was real. And now, it was turning the world, and Jake along with it, into some gay sex fantasy world. He needed to get to the bottom of this and fast, before he became overwhelmed by the desire to have sex with the first guy he sees. Maybe he could use the curse to stop this from happening. But who would he use it on, and who would trust him or believe him enough to let him try? Maybe he could convince Brad to let him?<br />
<br />
Jake chuckled at that thought. He wanted to convince the cheerleader to go out on a date, not scare that handsome man away. He did not shake his head of these different thoughts this time. He saw the small car of his friend Paul turn down his street. Maybe he could use the curse on him. Or maybe someone else?</p>
