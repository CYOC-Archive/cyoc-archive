<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cradling her weighty breasts in her hands Rachael decided that she could wait a little bit longer before dealing with them. The feeling of warmth and fullness was very pleasant and very, very sexy. Taking her time she walked back to her bedroom where she had left the box of chocolates, savoring the way her breasts jiggled and swayed as she walked, droplets of milk beading on her big, erect nipples.<br />
<br />
There were so many different chocolates to try and she had only samples a small number of them. It was difficult for her to decide where to start. There were breast chocolates, cock chocolates, pussy chocolates, tongue chocolates, butt chocolates, hips, bellies and so many more.<br />
<br />
While she thought about it she continued to play with her breasts, and maybe that was what gave her the idea. The dark chocolate belly chocolates were plump and pregnant looking and she was lactating...<br />
<br />
Smiling she picked one up and popped it into her mouth. As it melted in her mouth she felt a tingle in her stomach. Placing a hand on it she could feel that her stomach was no longer as flat as it had been.<br />
<br />
Still smiling she took another dark chocolate belly. The tingle returned and the slight bump to her belly became more noticeable.<br />
<br />
Walking over to the mirror she turned to examine herself from the side, enjoying the changes to her profile. Her belly was starting to balance out her heavy d-cup breasts, but there was still a ways for her to go.<br />
<br />
Rachael returned to the chocolates and had another. This time the tingling was stronger and the skin of her stomach started to become taunt. It was almost large enough for her to cradle it in her hands. One more chocolate brought it to that point. The tingling lasted a little longer this time, filling her with a feeling of well being that seemed to emanate from her belly.<br />
<br />
Again she turned to the mirror to look at herself, admiring the round swell of her now pregnant looking belly. <br />
<br />
She took a step and gasped at the heaviness of it. It felt strange, but good, making her want to continue as each chocolate she had only increased the pleasurable sensations.<br />
<br />
Another chocolate and her stomach was melon round and bulging. Sitting down on the edge of her bed she rubbed at the taunt skin of her stomach, savoring the feeling of firm fullness beneath her smooth skin. Maybe it was the chocolate, maybe it was hormones, but just touching her stomach was enough to send tingles of pleasure through her whole body, making her pussy grow wet.<br />
<br />
For several minutes she sat there on her bed, rubbing her belly and milky breasts, occasionally giving her clit a little tweak for good measure.<br />
<br />
Shuddering with waves of pleasure, she looked at herself in the mirror and smiled at what she saw. Her heavy breasts, with their large, dark nipples, coupled with her swollen belly make her look like she was at least half way through a pregnancy. To her the sight was very sexy.<br />
<br />
Rachael carefully lay back on the bed, needing to adjust for her changed center of gravity. Full as her breasts were, they hardly sagged. Past their heaving weight she could see the swell of her belly.<br />
<br />
Due to the size of her new endowments it took a bit of time and effort to take her jeans off and then strip off her panties, already wet with the juices of her aroused pussy.<br />
<br />
With a soft sigh she ran her fingers across her sopping pussy, teasing her plush nether lips, sending a rush of pleasure through her, urging her on. With one hand she rolled her clit between her fingers, pausing every so often to dip her fingers into her pussy, using the wetness of her pussy to provide lubrication while she caressed her belly and breasts with her other hand. <br />
<br />
The tingling of pleasure continued to grow, demanding her full attention. Abandoning tending to her belly and breasts she rubbed two fingers gently across her wet slit before pushing them in. Her inner walls tensed around her fingers as she slowly plunged them in and out, the wetness seeping out of her pussy moistening her thighs and dripping down onto her bed.<br />
<br />
Gasping and moaning she continued to pleasure herself, breasts and belly heaving, her shudders of bliss shaking her whole body.<br />
<br />
She could feel her orgasm fast approaching, starting as a warmth that came from her belly and pussy alike. Even her breasts were tingling with it, her nipples rock hard and aching with pleasure.<br />
<br />
When it finally came she did as well, a rush of pleasure accompanied by a gush of feminine juices.<br />
<br />
For several minutes afterward all she could do was lay there, trying to catch her breath. She rolled to her side, her breasts jiggling and her belly getting in the way.<br />
<br />
Eventually the tingling running through her began to fade, allowing her to decide what to do next.<br />
<br />
First things first she had to sit up, which took more effort than she expected due to the weight and size of her belly. When she did manage to push herself up she found that she had to sit with her legs spread to help balance. Managing despite the amount of effort it took gave her a feeling of accomplishment.<br />
<br />
Reaching for a box of tissues on her night table she dried her hands and blotted the milk off of her nipples. Though her breasts still felt full they had stopped dripping milk, for the time being at least. Her eyes then fell of the box of chocolates and she shrugged. There was no harm in one or two more.<br />
<br />
The next belly chocolate she ate caused her to exhale sharply. She could actually feel the skin of her stomach stretching and with an audible 'pop' her innie belly button became an outie. Rachael ran her fingers across the new little nub, as sensitive as her stomach was, it seemed to be the seat of all that sensation, tapping it sent tingles through her whole stomach.<br />
<br />
She cradled her belly in her arms, marveling at its roundness and size - larger than a basketball, and also its weight.<br />
<br />
It might have been a risk, but she decided to have one last belly chocolate, knowing that it was still early in the day, meaning that she had plenty of time to reverse what she had done. When she popped the chocolate in her mouth she gasped. Her belly pushed out in its final spurt of growth, increasing in both size and roundness before finally settling into a much lower position, forcing her to spread her legs a bit wider.<br />
<br />
Eager to get a look at herself in her mirror, Rachael tried to get to her feet, only to start to fall backwards due to how much her center of gravity had changed. Very carefully she leaned back and then forward, rocking several times to get the momentum necessary to get up.<br />
<br />
Slowly she walked over to the mirror, turning to look at herself from all angles.<br />
<br />
For all intents and purposes she looked like she was nine months pregnant. <br />
<br />
A pressure in her bladder let her know that she needed to go to the bathroom and she made her way out of her room and down the hall. The urgency of her need to pee was like nothing she had ever felt before, making her realize that her expanded womb was putting pressure on her insides. She rushed as fast as she could, her breasts swaying from side to side and her belly bouncing in a way that made the pressure feel even worse.<br />
<br />
In the bathroom she lowered herself onto the toilet, starting to pee even before she was fully seated.<br />
<br />
When she was done she wiped herself and then realized that getting up was going to be another challenge. Reaching to grab the edge of the sink she hauled herself up and washed her hands, her belly pressing against the cold porcelain of the sink.<br />
<br />
Making a mental note that she would need to be careful about not going too far from the bathroom until she decided to reverse what she had done, Rachael walked slowly back to her room. The challenge that simple tasks were due to her state was fun, after all until now her routine had been unbearably boring. Now at least she had to think about what she was doing and try different ways of going about things.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to spend the day naked, she set her mind to the task of getting dressed.<br />
<br />
First she had to get a new pair of panties out of her underwear drawer. Unable to bend down, she had to squat to get to the drawer and getting back up took all of her effort. <br />
<br />
Right away she realized that slipping her panties on would require her to sit down on the side of her bed, which she did with little effort. Getting up wasn't all that difficult since she had already done it once before, and even squatting down to retrieve her jeans wasn't as much trouble as it had at first.<br />
<br />
Again she had to sit down on her bed to put on her jeans and this time getting back to her feet felt like second nature.<br />
<br />
What to do about her breasts was another matter entirely though, since as big as her breasts were all of her bras were too small, and because of how large and heavy they were she didn't want to spend the day going without one. Her mother had large breasts though, so borrowing one of her bras might work.<br />
<br />
Rachael went to her mothers room and looked around until she found an old bra in the back of the closet, clearly forgotten and something her mother wouldn't miss.<br />
<br />
She put the bra on, taking time to adjust the straps and sighed in relief at the feeling of having her full breasts properly supported.<br />
<br />
Walking back to her room was much more comfortable and she went through her closet to find the most loose fitting shirt that she could. Even then the shirt she found was stretched tight across her breasts and couldn't cover her belly, leaving its pregnant bulge exposed. it might have looked silly, but Rachael was satisfied since it showcased what she had done to herself.<br />
<br />
All the walking and needing to exert herself just to get up from sitting had left her legs tired, so she sat down on the edge of her bed to think of what to do next, drumming her fingers on her exposed belly as she did so to enjoy the sensation of her taunt skin.</p>
