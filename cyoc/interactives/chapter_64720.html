<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I'm going out for a little while,&quot; her mom called out and when Diane did not answer, her mother added, &quot;You going to be fine by yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
Irritated, more with what was happening to her than with her mother, Diane made a nickering-sort of noise and then, from where she was lying on the bed, replied, &quot;Yeah. I'll be fine,&quot; aware that it sound almost like a whinny-sort of noise as she turned her attention back to the monstrosity that now made up her genitals.<br />
<br />
Somewhere in the house she could hear a door closing and knowing her mother went out each time with the noisy conservative Christian Ms Dousal, Diane turned on her side, deciding suddenly that what her mother did was really not her concern at the moment as she looked at the wall, slowly drew her legs up, hugged herself and lost herself in thought as she lay naked, curled up in a fetal position on her bed, hating the way her new penis felt as it slid from its sheath and rested against her leg.<br />
<br />
Turning back over, suddenly feeling really uncomfortable in the chest, she listened as the bed creaked beneath her, something she noted that it never had done before, staring at the ceiling, feeling all mixed up inside, she silently asked, &quot;What did I do to deserve this?&quot; as she let her hands drift down and cover her new genitals, aware how sensitive the tip of her penis was and how weird her testicles felt.<br />
<br />
As she lay there, feeling more and more aroused by the touch of her hands touching her genitals, Diane thought of the fat man and the way he had been staring at, wondering if maybe he had something to do with what was happening to her, and whether something similar was happening to the others. But, after a moment, she dismissed the idea as ridiculous and still idly tracing one finger up and down her penis, which was not rock hard and pointing up, she pondered over how it was possible for a girl to suddenly grow a set of genitals appropriate for a boy, but unable to come up with any solution as her mind kept drifting back to the fat man.<br />
<br />
Shifting, she forced herself to sit up and the moment she was in a sitting position, Diane realised that something else about her body was off and grumbling, &quot;Great. What's next. I start gaining weight and turn into the fat man,&quot; she heaved herself off her bed, her penis growing flaccid and withdrawing back into the sheath as she moved across the room.<br />
<br />
As she moved, deciding that she might call one of the others and ask if anything odd was happening to them, Diane paused as she knew that there was something definitely wrong with her body, besides her neo-penis and testicles. Looking down, thinking that her breasts appeared different somehow, she forced how they looked at the moment out of her mind as she looked at her thighs, shins, forearms and upper arms, deciding that they were what looked different, &quot;Almost more muscular,&quot; Diane thought to herself as she rushed across her room, out through the door and down the hall to her mother's room.<br />
<br />
Inside, she stepped in front of the mall that had been covered with mirrors and tilted her head, studying her reflection, turning sideways, she gazed at her image and then turned around, knowing for sure that something was off and there was no way that she had looked so muscular and built a couple hours ago and flexing, she attempted to wrap her hand around the muscle, but found that she was unable to.<br />
<br />
Turning away from the mirror, she thought for a moment and coming to a conclusion, she dashed from her mother's room and towards the bathroom. Inside, she stepped on the digital scale and then nearly screamed when it told her that her weight was about four hundred and seventy five. Stepping back, near hysterics, Diane buried her face in her hands, ran her hands over her face, finding it odd how suddenly sensitive the area around her nose, eyes and ears was and making a nickering sort of noise, she stepped forward again on the scale.<br />
<br />
Immediately the scale jumped back to four hundred and seventy five, blinked five hundred and nine, blinked again and then finally settled on five hundred and fifty three. Stepping back, Diane muttered, &quot;Great. Not only do I have the wrong genitalia, but also I turning into a majour lard butt!&quot; and kicking out at the scale, she watched as it launched into the air and then imbedded in the wall.<br />
<br />
Angry, not wanting to deal with how she was able to do what she just did, Diane turned away and marched out of the bathroom, deciding that the time to call her friends was now and marching toward her room, she started to get dressed in what she was wearing before, but finding that her clothes where now to tight on her and in the case of her jeans, would not fasten shut and when she shifted, ripped down the inside seam, splitting them in two.<br />
<br />
Letting out a shrill whinny of disgust, not even realising the noise she had just made, Diane began to tear the clothes from her body and knowing that she need something, she eventually settled on a pair of sweats that had once been baggy on her, but were now pulled so tight that it was possible to see the bulge of her penis and testicles, which also appeared to look larger. <br />
<br />
As she pulled on a matching sweat jacket, which was also stretched tight, Diane noted how flat chested she appeared  as she zipped it up and figuring it had something to do with how the jacket was being stretched across her arms and shoulders and that there was nothing she could really do about at the moment as she cantered across her room and through the door, her head just barely clearing the top of the six foot six doorframe.<br />
<br />
Moving through the dark house, she came to the conclusion that she should just go over to her friend's house instead of bothering with a phone call and deciding that Chastity was the closet, she changed direction and headed for the front door, where she was greeted by another surprise as she found that none of her shoes fit anymore and that she would have to go bare foot.</p>
