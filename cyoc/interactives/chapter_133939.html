<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brian was the type of guy who would spot a cute woman across the club and send her drinks over the course of the evening. Then once the woman had taken three or four he’d go up and guilt trip them into going home with him and banging. He’d been sending drinks all night, why would they be allowed to decline? Tonight was no different, he’d caught sight of a gorgeous redhead, one that made his heart skip a beat. She was in a beatiful green dress with matching heels and had a generous amount of cleavage showing. All covered in freckles, not an absurd amount but enough that Brian was definitely turned on. She had flipped her hair back when walking past him and he could only picture her doing that while atop him completely nude. He knew from the second she entered the club that she would be his prize.<br />
<br />
At least she would be if she hadn’t declined all his drinks.<br />
<br />
Brian had spent at least thirty dollars by this point sending drinks to her table only to have her decline and the drink be brought to him instead. They sat in front of him at his table, watered down because of all the ice and definitely not his forte when it came to liquor. The woman was apparently drinking vodka mixed with fruit juice and a fizzy orange sofa covered in a shot of grenadine, a slice of orange, some cherries, and strawberries with an umbrella stabbed into one so it could be locked into place. It sounded like Cavity the drink and whenever he sent one over the woman would look at him for a split second with brown eyes so alluring they made his dick go hard before looking away and resuming her conversation. To make matters worse the waiter was now cutting him off.<br />
<br />
“Sorry sir but you’ve already ordered six drinks since you got here,” the now tipless waiter explained before turning heel and walking away.<br />
<br />
“Stupid staff, stupid women,” Brian grumbled while downing the last of his first and only whiskey and soda. He put the cup down not even feeling a buzz from the liquor and frowned at the woman who had cost him a fun night. The music stopped as he did so and for a split second conversations rang through his head. He glanced at the DJ and was surprised to catch her looking right at him. Not just an odd catch of the eye but a clear glance. She was hot and Brian thought that maybe she was checking him out. She narrowed her eyes as he thought this, almost like she could read it and a new disc was put on and loud thumping music filled Brian’s ears. Really good music. People danced but he in particular felt a draw towards this song. It made his chest buzz and his tongue go dry, really dry. He looked at one of those drinks he’d sent to th woman across the club and picked it up. A sweat of moisture clung to the glass and felt real nice in his hands. He moved the straw of the girly drink away from his mouth and took a light sip like it was a rye and coke. Sugar and sweetness immediately blasted his mouth and hit every taste bud in his mouth. He coughed and held the drink aloft as the buzz of vodka hit him, it thudded with the music and the taste faded leaving a very nice aftertaste that made him lick his lips. He began to drink the first drink again, holding it to his lips while the sweetness poured down his throat and into his gut. He even shifted the ice to his mouth and crunches on it. The orange slices were devoured, the cherries were eaten, and the strawberries savoured. All that remained was a glass with cherry stems, an orange rind, and a tiny umbrella and straw for others to see.<br />
<br />
Brian smiled failing to notice that the grenadine had stained his lips red and that red spread until it looked like he was wearing lipstick. He had a buzz going through his body and the music seemed to be matching it. It spread and faded until he was thirsty again and reached for another drink. This time he brought the straw to his lips and sucked on it. Each suck drew more liquor into his body and each suck made something on his body change. First his body hair retreated into him, then his nose shrunk until it was petite, then his eyes changed shape and turned a beautiful hazel colour. The drink continued to empty as his shoulders drew inwards lowering his body girth and making his arms slim down. Nice thick arms melting into thin and scrawny ones for a man. His hands also became dainty and girly at the same time with the nails pushing outwards at the same time. Next his hair began to cascade downwards becoming styled and cared for. The entire do was run over by a beautiful faded auburn colour that would have been bright orange at one time. It began to weave itself into a braid and hung down Brian’s back beautifully before he swung it over his shoulder like it was completely natural. He sucked back the last of the drink as his waist began to move onwards slowly, it went from flat to a beautiful hourglass in seconds and the feeling sent a smile over his face as he popped cherries into his mouth, ate the orange rind, and strawberries finishing off the second drink while chewing on ice. His thighs expanded and his feet shrunk in response to this. He began to drop in terms of height and all his clothing hung off him loosely but he didn’t event notice his left shoe fall off with a loud clack.<br />
<br />
There was absolutely no time wasted in starting the third fruity and sugary drink. By this time Brian’s mouth and innards should have been dyed red but his body kept absorbing the coloration like a sponge absorbs water. He felt the buzz of liquor increase inside of him, assisted by the loud thumping of the music. Each thump pounded in his chest and it got super sensitive as the nipples expanded in diameter. Fat began to build up behind the nipples and as Brian sucked the drink back they expanded. First A-Cups, then B-Cups, then C-Cups, before finally settling at a nice D-Cup. They stopped growing and jiggled up and down for a few seconds before falling into place. Brian arched his back in response and moaned while sucking back the drink. It slurped in the cup as he picked up the orange. As he ate it his dick began to wobble and wiggle before being sucked backwards into his body. By the time he’d swallowed the orange he could no longer be called a he.<br />
<br />
Brian then popped the cherries one by one into her mouth and her testicles were sucked back into her body as well setting in as Ovaries. The strawberries then made her pussy lips form and her dicks transformation into a vagina complete. She began munching on ice and her hips suddenly flared outwards making her hourglass even nicer. They were built for child rearing but could also attract men at the same time. Her filling butt agreed as it jiggles into place, beautiful and round, ready to be shooken at some guys cock. Brian put the third cup down and picked the forth up with a smile.<br />
<br />
First her undershirt shrunk and cupped her breasts, pushing them up and together as wiring and straps formed creating a bra that coloured itself black. She wiggles her chest in excitement at the feeling and continues to suck back her drink as her boxers shrunk until they were nice and comfortable briefs. The briefs then shrunk until they were bikini undergarments before shrinking again and sliding up her ass as it turned into a thong.<br />
<br />
The pants she wore began to merge together until she was wearing a black dress skirt. It crept up her body and under her shirt groping her breasts tightly and stopping so it could display a lot of cleavage as a beautiful cocktail dress. Her shirt began to open up, the buttons undoing themselves as the men’s dress shirt opened up and the tie she had been wearing slapped against her no exposed right boob contained in her tight black cocktail dress. Her dress shirt began to morph taking on a much thicker texture as pockets appeared and her wallet and phone reappeared in said pockets. The coat pulled upwards getting tighter and tighter until it zipped up it would stop exactly at her waist. It remained white but began to change in texture. A black hair and appeared in her hair as sideswept bangs styled themselves for her. The tie shrunk and slid into her cleavage turning into a necklace with a snowflake charm on it. Her socks shrunk down until they hid themselves in her shoes which quickly turned into heels. The one that had fallen snapped snugly onto her foot and she sucked back the last of the drink, finished off the fruit, and ate the ice. By now she was wavering back and forth as her now female body held liquor differently. She picked up the last one and drink it when she fumbled it and the drink splattered all over her chest and face. The brightly coloured drink absorbed into her skin and left behind drop marks that quickly turned into freckles. It absorbed into her face becoming makeup, eyeshadow, and foundation. Freckles spread over her nose and breasts as she giggled drunkly and felt her mind waved as much as her body was. She stood up and fell back into her seat before composing herself. The waiter from earlier walked past and looked at her before asking, “Table six sent a drink over, do you want it?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah I do,” Brian giggled as she took ahold of the drink that had been sent over. Another one of the fruity drinks. She quickly drank it back and felt the buzz overtake her brain. She ate all the ice, chewed all the fruit, and polished off the drink before a shadow loomed over her. A man about five or ten years older than her with a tight wife beater on and a cowboy hat atop his head.<br />
<br />
“Hey babe, so I’ve been sending drinks over all night and I think I’ll collect what I’m owed,” The man grinned.<br />
<br />
“Owed?” Brenda asked drunkly before she hiccuped.<br />
<br />
“What you thought they were free?” The man asked with a snicker.<br />
<br />
“I-I-“ Brenda started before the man took her hand and began to lead her out of the club. She wavered to and fro and looked around for something but couldn’t find it. She began to deage as they walked out of the club dropping from in her mid thirties to just twenty one years old, just legal to be in a club and drink. The man was even older now in comparison but she was too drunk to pay attention as he led her out of the club and to a beat up pickup truck that he basically shoved her into the passenger seat of. He put the truck in reverse and pulled out of the lot driving Brenda away from the club and her old life.</p>
