<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tom and Alexa gazed at the monitor within the undercover van. Once again the pair found themselves with Geshp on a stake out.<br />
<br />
The devil assured the pair that this time the meeting between the Lycan underworld was taking place, despite some mild ribbing by both Alexa and Tom. Needless to say, Geshp was taking no chances as he triple checked his Intel and doubled the amount of age to on scene.<br />
<br />
&quot;Think you went a bit overboard Geshp?&quot; Tom asked with a smirk. Geshp didn&#39;t take to kindly to the rookie agents joke, his dark eyes glinting with malice.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what would you know of preparation boy,&quot; Geshp growled, the devil&#39;s horns slowly beginning to protrude from his forehead. Sensing that the devil was about to lose his temper, Alexa now stepped in between the pair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy Geshp,&quot; Alexa said quickly. &quot;Tom&#39;s just trying to lighten the mood. You look tense.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I&#39;m tense,&quot; Geshp snarled. &quot;I have an opportunity to cripple the Lycan Criminal Underworld for decades to come and your boyfriend is treating it as a minor inconvenience.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh please Agent Ross,&quot; Geshp scoffed. &quot;Others may not have noticed but it is apparent to me that you two have become a couple. I&#39;m a devil dear Alexa, emotions such as love and lust sting my nostrils like cheap perfume. With you two, the stench is overwhelming.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexa and Tom paused, the pair looking between eachother before turning to Geshp; cheeks flushing crimson.<br />
<br />
&quot;You won&#39;t say anything will you?&quot; Tom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your secret is safe with me Agent Harris,&quot; Geshp replied. &quot;I simply await the inevitable end to such passion....and the sorrow that follows.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s comforting,&quot; Alexa grumbled, folding her arms across her chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Geshp,&quot; Tom stated, trying to shift the focus off of himself and Alexa. &quot;Business then. I reviewed the the mission briefing as well as the personnel you acquisitioned for this little operation. Can you explain the civilian?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Civilian,&quot; Geshp asked. &quot;Do you mean Felicity?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom nodded, the devil taking a breath as he now explained Felicity Monroe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Felicity Monroe is the bodyguard and mistress of Princess Winery,&quot; Geshp explained. &quot;While she may appear human, she is much more. The royal family has taken an interest in this operation considering the difficulties that the Amberhills posed before we took them into custody.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that why security in the prison block has been so high?&quot; Alexa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Geshp said softly, his voice almost fearful. &quot;No, security has been increased because of something far worse than an angry werewolf. Something I have dealt with on a few occasions. It is powerful, vengeful, and looking to inflict nothing but....misery. The Amberhills in their actions may have brought its wrath upon them. We protect the Amberhills so that they can actually face justice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom nodded, understanding what Geshp maybe talking about. He had heard plenty of rumors from Mia and Zack about Misery. Needless to say, if the Amberhills had run afoul of her, they would need S.P.E.A.R&#39;s protection.<br />
<br />
&quot;There,&quot; Geshp whispered, gesturing towards a pair of limos. Tom and Alexa watched as a group of men exited the vehicle before making their way inside. It didn&#39;t take much for Tom to realize that those men were werewolves.<br />
<br />
&quot;All units,&quot; Geshp stated over the radio. &quot;Wait for my signal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom and Alexa readied themselves. They had close to 50 agents on scene. Quickly checking their weapons, the pair positioned themselves near the rear of the van.<br />
<br />
&quot;NOW!&quot; Geshp ordered.<br />
<br />
Tom and Alexa burst from the van, quickly advancing towards the warehouse. Several agents now lined the wall, ready to breach as soon as everyone was in position. The lead agent quickly counting down before breaking down the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Federal Agents Don&#39;t move!&quot;<br />
<br />
The werewolves paused, at first transforming. Tom watched as the men&#39;s features twisted, their clothes town to shreds as fur of various colors erupted from their skin. Their faces shifting, jaws elongating, fangs growing, their muscles swelling under their skin. They looked ready to attack.<br />
<br />
All agents now leveled their rifles at the werewolves, the laser points of their sights covering each werewolf. Tom now saw Felicity, the blonde woman stepping forward before muttering something.<br />
<br />
In a flash, Felicity transformed, Tom shielding his eyes from the light before blinking. He had heard rumors but this confirmed it. Felicity Monroe was the magical girl Daydream Rose.<br />
<br />
A now teenage Felicity ran forward, useing her massive hammer to strike a pair of nearby guards. Both guards lay unconscious as Daydream Rose glowered at the werewolf gangsters.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the name of the Royal Family I order you to stop,&quot; she proclaimed. &quot;I am Daydream Rose, defender of the Lycan Royal family!&quot;<br />
<br />
Most werewolves raised their hands in surrender. The amount of firepower pointed at them making a fight unwinnable. One, though, attempted to press his luck as he charged Daydream Rose. This werewolf would rather take death than imprisonment.<br />
<br />
What occurred next shocked Tom. Daydream Rose began to change once more. The magical girl grew in size, blonde fur erupting from her body, her mouth becoming a muzzle with razor sharp fangs, her muscles increasing to Amazonian proportions. All while adorned in the skirt and top of a magical girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;A werewolf majokko!&quot; Tom exclaimed in awe.<br />
<br />
The now werewolf magical girl clutched her massive warhammer in one hand swinging it incredible speed. The attacking werewolf never stood a chance, Daydream Rose catching him in the gut before placing a clawed foot on top of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;No longer will you tarnish the name of the royal family,&quot; Winery snarled, the magical werewolf girl&#39;s eyes glaring at the werewolf beneath her clawed feet. Seeing no other recourse, he quickly surrendered as S.P.E.A.R now moved in.<br />
<br />
The raid was over quickly, Geshp all smiles as the werewolves were handcuffed and placed in waiting trucks. Geshp was all smiles, the raid was a resounding success.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Alexa said as she approached Tom. &quot;Magical Werewolf Girl was definitely not on my BINGO card this year.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom chuckled, glancing at Daydream Rose. The magical werewolf now speaking with Geshp as the gangsters were transported to HQ for processing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just glad it went smoothly,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
As the last of the prisoners were loaded on the trucks, Tom and Alexa approached Geshp and Winery. Winery remained in her magical werewolf girl&#39;s form as she spoke with Geshp. Tom surprised at just how tall the blonde werewolf was. Geshp noticed the young agents, turning to face them with a smirk on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Agent Harris, Agent Ross,&quot; the devil smirked. &quot;I take it the suspects were safely secured?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir,&quot; Tom stated. &quot;Everyone is enroute to S.P.E.A.R HQ for processing. The operation was a resounding success.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As I knew it would be,&quot; Geshp replied confidently. Tom said nothing, biting his tongue at the devil&#39;s arrogance. &quot;Agent Harris, I&#39;d like to introduce you to Felicity Monroe aka Daydream Rose.&quot;<br />
<br />
Felicity extended her furry paw, shaking Tom&#39;s hand or more accurately Tom&#39;s hand and half his forearm. &quot;Pleasure Miss Monroe,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Likewise Agent Harris,&quot; she said, her voice animalistic. &quot;Out of curiosity, are you related to Yuriko Harris?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, she&#39;s my little sister,&quot; Tom said. &quot;How do you know her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mia and Zack,&quot; Felicity replied. &quot;I&#39;ve been friends of theirs since high school. They always mentioned their goddaughter and her big brother. Zack talks a lot about you, says he sort of considers you like a son. Pleasure to meet you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Likewise.&quot; Tom replied with a smile at what Felicity told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Monroe acts as the Lycan Princesses personal bodyguard,&quot; Geshp stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Alexa said. &quot;If I could ask a question, have you always been a werewolf? I&#39;ve never heard of werewolves possessing magic before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t you a curious one.&quot; Felicity chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nekomata,&quot; Alexa replied sheepishly. &quot;Curiosity is kind of a personality quirk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Felicity said, a warm smile on her lupine face. &quot;To answer your question, no. I was human. In fact I was a magical girl before I became a werewolf. Ten years ago I pledged myself loyalty to Princess Winery&#39;s family, becoming her personal bodyguard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s interesting,&quot; Alexa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you think that&#39;s interesting then I should tell you about who was originally supposed to be Winery&#39;s protector,&quot; Felicity smirked. &quot;I think Agent Harris would find it interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really,&quot; Tom asked. &quot;Who?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A friend of yours Morgan Carlson.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Morgan?!&quot; Tom exclaimed in confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Morgan,&quot; Felicity stated. &quot;You see twenty plus years ago Morgan&#39;s aunt Gloria made a pact with the Lycan family. In exchange for the assistance of the Lycans, Gloria promised that one of the next generation of wizards would be sworn to the Lycans. It seemed fair at the time for the Lycans. The kitsune were connected to your cousins. The dragons were connected to Tricia Davis. The Lycans wanted a child of their own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How come I&#39;ve never heard of this?&quot; Tom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly because of me,&quot; Felicity shrugged. &quot;Winery and I are....close. Quite close. After years together, she confided in me that Morgan Carlson would become an honorary member of the Lycan Royal family on her 21st birthday. At the time, Morgan was still young, perhaps 9 or 10. She didn&#39;t have any real connection with the family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you took her place,&quot; Alexa added.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did,&quot; Felicity stated. &quot;It made sense honestly and Winery agreed. Why ask a child who had no connection to the werewolves to join us when I wanted to do so freely. After all, Winery and I have saved each other on several occasions over the years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you joined their clan and became a werewolf,&quot; Tom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did,&quot; Felicity said. &quot;And when it was discovered that I still had access to my Daydream Rose powers as a werewolf, the royal family allowed Morgan&#39;s family to let her remain unturned.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our friend Felicity is now one of the most powerful soldiers in not only the Lycan kingdom but the supernatural world,&quot; Geshp stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re too kind Geshp,&quot; Felicity blushed. &quot;Remember though, once S.P.E.A.R has processed these criminals the royal family wants to deal with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have already told Director Meyers,&quot; Geshp replied. &quot;She will contact the royal family personally.&quot;<br />
<br />
Felicity nodded, saying her goodbyes as Tom and Alexa stood there in stunned silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;You certainly have interesting history Tom,&quot; Alexa chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess I do,&quot; he smirked. &quot;And I didn&#39;t even know. Looks like things wrapped up early here, want to grab some dinner and get started on our reports?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only if you&#39;re paying,&quot; Alexa grinned. The young couple now making their way towards their vehicle to enjoy a late dinner as they got to work.</p>
