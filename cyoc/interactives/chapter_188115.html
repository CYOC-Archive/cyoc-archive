<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This is a story concept that I’ve had in mind for this branch for a while now. While I’m still working on a follow-up to the Satyr tf, I felt more motivated to work on this one before continuing that one. Hope you all enjoy! <br/>
-TWP</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you go to put your shoes and socks back on, you find that they aren’t there anymore. But...isn’t that where you put them? You only looked away for a second, so how could they have vanished so suddenly?<br />
<br />
You don’t have to wait long to get an answer to your question, as you hear the sound of something rustling in the bushes. Turning your head towards the source of the sound, you see a pure white fox poking its head out of a bush. You were about to shrug it off when you noticed that the fox had something in its mouth. Was that…?<br />
<br />
“My sock!” You say. “Give that back you little thief!”<br />
<br />
The fox doesn’t make any attempt to give you back your sock and runs off into the woods. Swearing to yourself, you begin to chase after the small canine, going deeper into the forest. <br />
<br />
As you run after the fox, you don’t think to make a mental note as to where you’re going. You’re just focused on catching that fox and getting your sock back. It’s only when the fox slips through a hole leading under a wall that you stop and begin to take note of your surroundings. <br />
<br />
Somehow, you hadn’t noticed that the fox had led you straight to a large wall that resembled those that you often see in Japan, complete with blue painted tiles lining the top. In front of you was a traditional Japanese gateway with a pair of large, wooden doors, one of which was slightly ajar. Determined to get your stolen article of clothing back, you slip through the gate. <br />
<br />
On the other side of the wall was a beautiful Japanese garden. The whole garden appeared to be made up of a few islands in a rather large lake, each one connected to each other by red wooden bridges. Large cherry blossom trees dotted the area, their beautiful pink flowers in full bloom for all to see. On one of the islands was a small yet elegant pagoda that appeared to have a tea table inside it. However, none of this was the main focus of your intention. <br />
<br />
On a central island was a large traditional Japanese home that appeared to be two or three stories. It was elevated a foot or two off the ground with a deck leading around the entire house. In front of the main island was a smaller island with nothing on it but a large, red Torii. A red, wooden bridge connected the piece of land you were on to the small island, with another one connecting the small island to the one the house was on. <br />
<br />
Then, you spotted the fox on the deck of the house by the front door. The two of you locked eyes for a split second before the fox ran into the house through the front door, which had also been left open. <br />
<br />
Shaking your head in frustration, you begin to walk down the stone pathway and across the first bridge. As you pass under the Torii, a sudden cool breeze blows through the garden, making you shiver slightly. Nevertheless, you continue onwards across the second bridge and up the stairs, stopping at the front door to the house. You push the door open slightly and slip inside, closing the door behind you. <br />
<br />
The first room of the house was rather small with nothing much inside. You remember from an article you read online once that most traditional Japanese homes had a small room to put your shoes and coats. Whatever the case, the fox wasn’t in here. You continued on.<br />
<br />
The entrance room led to a hallway that was lined with paper screen walls and sliding doors. Most of the doors appeared to be closed save for one at the end of the hallway on the left. You walk down the hallway and turn into the room, only to see the fox sitting on a large traditional Japanese bed. You close the door behind you so the fox can’t escape. <br />
<br />
“I’ve caught you now, you thief,” you say, moving towards the fox. <br />
<br />
The fox looks at you and starts to open its mouth. You think that it’s going to bark at you, but then…<br />
<br />
“Well, I suppose you have, haven&#39;t you?” the fox responds. <br />
<br />
Your eyes widen in shock as the fox begins to change before your eyes, growing larger and taking on a more human-like appearance. You want to run away, but for some reason, you can’t move your feet. After a minute, the fox finishes transforming, and you stare at the creature in front of you in a mixture of shock and awe. <br />
<br />
The fox had become a fox-like humanoid with well defined muscles. A mop of moderately long white fur resembling hair sat on top of its head, with a pair of triangular ears poking out from the top. Behind the fox were nine, fluffy-looking white tails, each of them gently swaying behind their owner. You can easily make out the tip of a red cock poking out from a sheath, identifying the creature’s gender as male. <br />
<br />
The fox raises his arms over his head and stretches. “Ah, it’s good to be back in this form,” he says before looking at you. “I’m glad that you followed me back to my home. It’s been so long since I’ve had some good company.”<br />
<br />
“Wh…what are you?” You ask, trying not to show fear in front of this…this thing. <br />
<br />
The fox smirks before he slowly walks towards you and begins to circle you, brushing his tails against your body. <br />
<br />
“I’m a kitsune, you silly boy,” he responds. “And I must say, I’m glad I chose you.”<br />
<br />
“Hold on, what do you mean you ‘chose me’?” you ask.<br />
<br />
The kitsune stops behind you and puts his hands on your shoulders. He leans in close before whispering “to have some fun.”<br />
<br />
You shudder as the kitsune whispers in your ear. There was something about the way he said it that made your heart race. You’ve never been attracted to males before, yet there was something about this creature that made you hornier than you ever have been in your life. <br />
<br />
“I…I’m not gay,” you say. You try to sound firm, but your voice ends up sounding a little shaky. <br />
<br />
The kitsune laughs at your response. “Now now, there’s no need to make such hasty conclusions,” he says, running his hands down your sides and placing them on your hips. “I can clearly tell that you’re enjoying yourself.” The kitsune uses his right hand to grasp the bulge in your pants, giving it a nice squeeze. You can’t help but let out a small moan against your will. <br />
<br />
The kitsune smirks and leans his head over your right shoulder. “See? I told you that you’re enjoying yourself,” he says. “And things will only get better from here. Think about it: you’ll be giving up your human form to become an immortal being with unlimited wisdom. Your body will experience new pleasures that you never thought existed thanks to a mate that will love and cherish you for all time.”<br />
<br />
You want to reject the kitsune’s offer and tell him, again, that you aren’t gay, but your body is telling you a completely different story. It’s as of being in the presence of this powerful being has released a wave of urges that you’ve kept closeted your whole life. <br />
<br />
“What….what exactly would I have to do?” you ask.<br />
<br />
The kitsune smirks and leans towards your ear, whispering a single word that makes you shudder.<br />
<br />
“Submit.”</p>
