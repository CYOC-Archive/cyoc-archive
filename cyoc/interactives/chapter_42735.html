<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake tried resisting opening the door but he just couldn't and upon opening the door he sees his family's gardener, Miguel standing there in an open flannel button down and ripped jean ready to rip at the seams. Miguel had come from a poor south american family and when he was 15  had come to America to build a better life for himself, but as the years progressed and Miguel's body developed, he began noticing people hiring him for jobs not cause he was a good garden, but because of how much his shirt strained against his muscular torso and how his jeans showed off his perfect ass and his heavy set strained the front of his jeans. <br />
      When Jake saw this muscle bound latino, he tried hard to resist jumping Miguel, but Miguel was already getting ideas when he saw this sexy white boy jock halfway naked and sporting a decent bulge. Miguel usually was able to fill his sexual appetite and keep it under control even when a jock is half naked in front of him, but he hadn't been getting any and this site was too good to pass up, he just needed his opening. <br />
      Jake was able to control himself long enough to get the money his parent had left for Miguel and began counting it out as he handed it to him. Yet as he was almost finished the wind from outside picked up and blew one of the bills inward and Jake had quickly turned and bent over grabbing the bill but this is where it went down hill for Jake.<br />
      As Jake turned to catch the money, he had inadvertantly placed his ass on Miguels crotch and Miguel didn't seem to be startled at all, if anything the bulge seemed to get bigger. Jake at this point was going crazy over the feeling of this guy's meat so close to his whole, Miguel noticed this and decided it better if the went into the house instead of dooing this at the door way. He pushed inside and closed the door while still keeping his crotch on target and hearing little moans coming from Jake's mouth. Miguel thought &quot;Wow this kid is sensitive. can't wait to hear him when my cock is up that tight bubble butt ass&quot;. Jake finally had unbent and lead Miguel to his room, once in the room he undid what liitle clothes he had and lay on the bed, Miguel followed and got on top of Jake, ready to fuck the hell out of him. Miguel looked around and saw some lube next to the bed and knew if he wanted this to not look like a gore fest, would place like half the tube in and around Jake's hole. <br />
     Miguel at full size was a uncut 10 inches as thick as a red bull and balls the size of large eggs, he lined up his cock to Jake's hole and went in deep. If Jake's back hadn't arched and dug into the pillow, his neighbors would have heard a scream but it soon passed and replaced with high moans, Jake adjusted quick to Miguel&quot;s cock and accepted it entirely and was loving it. Miguel was getting so damn turned on by this kid that he kept himself from comming and Jake was pretty much was gone between the cock up his ass and the latino muscle man it was connected to, even the sweaty smell coming from this guy was driving him over and the way Miguel glistened with the sweat all over him was making Jake wish he was a part of him.<br />
    After what seemed like hours Jake could feel Miguel bending closer to him and saying &quot;You ready for my cum little man, cause its comming straight into this fine little hole of yours and its gonna be a big one&quot; and with this Jake spun himself around on Miguel's cock, tipped the guy that had been on top of him the entire time and was pretty much riding ontop of miguel, Jake pushed foward and gave a deep kiss to Miguel while pushing down harder on Miguel/ Miguel himself was in shock from the change in position and the kiss but as the kiss broke, he let out a smile and pushed harder into Jake's ass and with his final thrust, lifting Jake and even his own ass off the bed, Miguel shot one of the biggest loads he has ever blown and as he ascended, embrassed Jake closer and kissed his neck while still having his cock up his ass with just small droplets of cum dripping out of Jakes ass. Miguel from working all day and this just fell asleep after a while, but Jake was feeling an odd sensation coming from deep inside him..</p>
