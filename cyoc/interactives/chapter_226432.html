<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Riley sees Sarah taking the phone “Amy” had chosen for herself, the boy exits the shop, wanting to prevent from being spotted by the two girls, not wanting to come across, if spotted, that he’s stalking Amy.<br />
<br />
Riley waits a few feet away from the store for the girls to leave, he then follows them, keeping his distance, to a cafeteria, and watches them get themselves some drinks and a snack and head to a small table to sit down.<br />
<br />
After waiting for 15 minutes, Riley decides that it’s the right time to approach the two girls, the 15-year-old takes a deep breath, ‘remember Riley,’ he thinks to himself, ‘act as though you are surprised to see them. Do not let them suspect that you had something to do with their opinions changed about you, and make sure to compliment Amy on her outfit. Most importantly: do NOT come across as creepy! You got this!’<br />
<br />
“Amy” and Sarah don’t yet notice Riley walking up to them, “you know, Sarah,” the little “girl” says, “I have to be honest, I do feel a little weird.”<br />
<br />
“In what way,” Sarah asks.<br />
<br />
“Well, it is the way I suddenly remember stuff,” “Amy” continues, “I mean… I remember that I met Riley a few months ago, I also feel as though I have always been “Amy”, that today is not the first time I transformed myself into her. It feels… it feels like false memories are filling my mind, to be honest, I feel more like the real Amy than just a simply copy or replacement. I mean… I still feel like myself: a straight 16-year-old boy… but this body… feels as though I always had it. I feel so weird and confused! I even prefer this body over my original one! Do… do you think something went wrong when I used the App on myself? Is my mind being affected, causing me to BECOME the original the longer I stay like this? I mean… I’m kind of scared… I… I don’t want to lose myself.”<br />
<br />
Sarah just smiles, “I think you are just tired,” she says, “it’s been a long and stressful day at school. I think you are just overwhelmed, I wouldn’t worry and think about it if I were you. Besides… you feel comfortable as “Amy”, right?”<br />
<br />
“Amy” nods, “I do,” she says, “but… I mean… I’m not really a girl, I am a straight boy, I shouldn’t be thinking about Riley the way I am.”<br />
<br />
Riley is still a few feet away, due to the noises in the mall and the cafeteria, the teen is unable to make out the words of the two girls.<br />
<br />
Sarah rolls her eyes, “Amy, yes you ARE a straight boy,” she says, “BUT you are also a straight girl! Straight girls have relationships with boys! That is how it’s supposed to be! Do you feel disgusted or does it feel in any other way uncomfortable to you, the thought of having a boyfriend? To have sex with a boy, having a boy insert his cock into you? Pumping you full with his seed?”<br />
<br />
“Well… no,” the little “girl” says, “it feels right. Thinking about IT… imagining Riley fucking me… it feels natural and right… but… I know I should not really be so comfortable with having a relationship with a boy.”<br />
<br />
“THAT is what your mind says,” Sarah says, “but what does your HEART and FEELINGS tell you?”<br />
<br />
“Amy” thinks for a while, she ignores the thoughts in her head, and instead focuses on what her body is telling her. As she imagines herself in bed with Riley, having him fuck her, “Amy” feels her body become warm, her stomach gets that butterfly feeling and she can feel her virgin pussy become moist. “Amy” realizes how good those feelings feel, her body wants Riley, SHE wants Riley! The little “girl” finally relaxes and smiles at Sarah, “you are right, Sarah,” she says, “I should stop worrying so much and just go with what feels right!”<br />
<br />
Sarah smiles, “finally,” she says, “to be honest, I think you and Riley would make a cute couple.”<br />
<br />
“Y-you think,” the little “girl” asks, blushing.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think, Amy,” Sarah says, smiling, “I KNOW!”<br />
<br />
“Amy” is about to say something when both suddenly hear a voice say, “Amy, Sarah, what a surprise seeing you here”.<br />
<br />
Both girls look up and their eyes widen in surprise, “Riley,” Sarah says, “this sure is a surprise”.<br />
<br />
Riley stops in front of the table, smiling, “I’m surprised that you are not jumping to your feet to protect Amy,” he says.<br />
<br />
Both girls look at each other, “about that,” Sarah says, “Amy has something to tell you”.<br />
<br />
Riley, acting as though he is unaware of what his crush is about to say, looks over at “Amy”.<br />
<br />
“Amy” feels her face heat up as she blushes, ‘he… he is much handsomer than I remember,’ she thinks to himself, ‘just… just looking at him makes me feel all… giddy’.<br />
<br />
“What is it you want to tell me, Amy,” Riley asks.<br />
<br />
“Amy” blinks, “I… Um…,” the girl stutters, seeming to be rather nervous.<br />
<br />
Riley smirks inwardly, ‘she looks so cute when she is nervous,’ he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
“Amy” takes a deep breath, “well… f-first, I want to apologize to you,” she says.<br />
<br />
“Before you continue,” Riley interrupts her, “would you mind me joining you?”<br />
<br />
Both girls shake their heads, Riley smiles and pulls up a chair and sits down, he then looks over at “Amy”. The little “girl” gulps, “a-as I was saying,” she continues, “I’m sorry that… that I called you a “creep” and told you to stay away from me”.<br />
<br />
Riley nods, “that really hurt,” he says, “especially since you haven’t really given me a chance”.<br />
<br />
“Amy” lowers her head, a feeling of shame raising inside of her, “I… I really should have given you a chance,” she says.<br />
<br />
Riley smiles, “so, does that mean,” he says, “that you’d be willing to give it a try?”<br />
<br />
“Amy” nods, “yes… yes, I’d be willing to give it a try,” she says.<br />
<br />
Riley’s smile widens, “I’m really happy to hear that, Amy,” he says, “by the way, I like your outfit. It looks so good on you”.<br />
<br />
“Amy” blushes, “I… th-thanks, Riley,” she says, then she looks over at Sarah.<br />
<br />
Sarah smiles, “I told you that you look great in the outfit,” she says.<br />
<br />
“So, what are you girls up to,” Riley asks, “I mean… do you have something planned?”<br />
<br />
“Actually, Riley,” Sarah says, “Amy and I were about to head home, we had a really stressful day”.<br />
<br />
Riley nods, “I understand,” he says, he then turns to “Amy”, “w-would you… would you like to… um meet up on the weekend?”<br />
<br />
“Amy’s” eyes widen, “are… are you asking me out,” she asks, sounding surprised, Riley nods, blushing a little. The little “girl” looks over at Sarah, who gives her a “I-would-accept-if-I-were-you”-look. “Amy” turns back to Riley, “I… I’d love to,” she says.<br />
<br />
Riley can’t help but beam with joy, “I promise to make our first date special for the both of us,” he says, he then takes out his phone, “give me your number, I’ll text you my address later”.<br />
<br />
“Amy” nods, she then takes the phone Sarah had bought her out of its box and scribbles the number on a piece of paper, “I still have to activate the number, I just got the phone and new number today”.<br />
<br />
Riley nods, he types the number into his phone, “no worries, Amy,” he says, “I’ll send you the address later tonight or tomorrow”.<br />
<br />
“Okay, Riley,” she says.<br />
<br />
“Okay, I shall leave you girls,” the boy says, getting to his feet, he then turns to look at “Amy”, “m-may I give you a… kiss?”</p>
