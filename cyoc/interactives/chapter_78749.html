<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Sara. Take moth... Queeny inside. Let us handled this.&quot; Arn asked, confidence in her voice, she'd been fairly <br />
confident when she was first changed into an elf girl but that personality had quickly faded and been replaced <br />
by the meek little elf girl Andrew had fantasized about. Men and there fantasies! Really! If anything was <br />
going to be Andrews undoing I suppose it would be that. Still, I was glad that Andrews confidence was showing <br />
itself in Arn again and obliged, dragging Queeny by the feet inside what I assumed was the local Inn.<br />
<br />
Outside, Morgana hid beneath a water trough, normally used by the horses of adventurers or tradesmen passing <br />
through, now the horses were unsurprisingly absent. Morgana flicked through a very small spellbook she had <br />
been carrying about her persons, doubtless somewhere quite lewd. She hurriedly looked for a spell that might <br />
actually be of some use against a magical transformation resistant dragon before finally stopping on one with <br />
an &quot;Aha!&quot; It looked like she was on to a winner and chose to bide her time waiting for the right moment to us <br />
it. <br />
<br />
Maedel dodged through dragon fire towards the dragon. If she could get close she could avoid the flames, <br />
something she very much would like to do as her currently wooden body didn't take too kindly to fire. She made <br />
it in close to strike at the dragons neck and did so, striking between scales and causing a nasty but not very <br />
lethal scratch. The problem with being so close to a dragon is that you are very close to a dragons claws, <br />
teeth, tail and wings, all of which it is usually quite happy to strike you with. As Maedel made her way <br />
around the dragon, causing many scratches, it non-chalantly raised a clawed arm and batted her across the <br />
street through the wooden wall and into the stables of the Inn. A hit such as that would normally be enough to <br />
make even the toughest of men to think twice about going toe to toe with a dragon but Maedels thick wooden <br />
body was very resistant to blunt force and she got up and charged again, either oblivious to the fact she'd <br />
landed in the barns dung heap or raging that she'd landed in the barns dung heap.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, the dragon had turned its attention to Arn who had been loosely tying rope around its back <br />
legs while it focused on Maedel. Now it had turned around and with that the rope tightened, pulling its back <br />
legs together and, for the time being, immobilizing them. The dragon was obviously unhappy with this situation <br />
and decided to made its displeasure known in the best way it knew how. Arn smiled up nervously as the dragon <br />
inhaled and Arn made very well sure not to be there when it exhaled in a explosive, fire-y, fashion. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eeeeeeeee!&quot; the petite little elf screamed as she ran like a frightened maiden. Her diapered bottom gently <br />
swaying with each step, palms raised and open at her sides, arms bent at the elbows in level with her ribs. <br />
She looked like a hysterical woman frightened by a mouse. As silly as she looked, she managed to run circles <br />
around the dragon as it awkwardly tried to catch her in its breath, its turning hampered by the loss of the <br />
use of its back legs. All the while Maedel held a rope (adventurers carry lots of rope) as the dragon <br />
unwittingly tied itself as it spun round chasing Arn. By the time it noticed all four of its arms and claws <br />
were tied together and it lost balance falling to the side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quick Arn! Get on top of its head. Go for the eyes!&quot; shouted Maedel as she ran to knot the rope.<br />
<br />
Arn was limber for a girl with a thick diaper between her legs (or perhaps elves just are?) and had quickly <br />
climbed atop the dragons head when she finally lost balance and stumbled over onto her knees. The dragon still <br />
had its wings and strong neck which it was attempting to use to right itself and fly into the air where its <br />
tied legs wouldn't matter. It could just strafe through the air burning anything in sight after all. Why <br />
dragons felt it necessary to fight adventurers on the ground I'll never know.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've got this!&quot; shouted a confident Morgana as she crawled out from under the horses trough. She raised and <br />
hand and with wicked smile and crackling bolts of magical energy between her fingers she annouced with great <br />
malice in her voice, &quot;I cast flare!&quot;<br />
<br />
A bright light shot from her hand into the dragons face blinding it temporarily and making loose balance and <br />
come crashin back to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking flare? That was your big move? Children can cast fucking flare!&quot; Shouted Maedel as she tried to hold <br />
the rope steady and not let the dragon break loose.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you I'm not very good at non-transformation spells,&quot; Morgana cried sounding a little less confident <br />
than usual, &quot;I've got an idea though. Arn I want you to fly directly up above the dragons head!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Fly but I ca...&quot; Arn was cut off by her sudden transformation into a tiny red-breasted robin, an <br />
uncommon bird in these parts especially considering all the giant bats and griffs that would love to chow down <br />
on one. Still, Arn had little time to worry about that now as she had to quickly learn how to fly lest she <br />
fall into the dragons nostril and end up as some poor peasants cooked meal for the day. She flapped her little <br />
wings and flew high and true, just as asked, and unafraid of the eagles the flew over the city looking for <br />
little birds to pray on. Or possibly just unaware. <br />
<br />
Morgana watched as the little bird flew nice and high and raised another hand filled with pulsing magical <br />
energy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh dear. They may be a little too high. I'd hate to see the little Princess hurt on the fall down. No <br />
matter.&quot; Morgana said sounding genuinely concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fall down? What do you mean fall down?&quot; Maedel ignored the fact that Arn was supposed to be a Prince not a <br />
Princess just as Morgana flung another ball of energy at the little bird just as an eagle had spied, and dived <br />
bombed toward her. <br />
<br />
The ball of energy engulfed the tiny bird and she swelled to enormous proportions, loosing all trace of <br />
feathers, beaks and wings replaced with strong stumpy limbs, a fat stocky body, a tiny little tail and a huge <br />
snout.<br />
<br />
Maedel and Morgana watched as the 3 tonne hippopotamus, commonly known as a hippo, fell from the sky to land <br />
on its bottom, hitting the dragon square on the head, smashing it into the cobbled road!<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that worked out alright, I suppose.&quot; said Maedel, reluctant to compliment Morgana.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was better than alright. I defeated a dragon! That'll teach the naysayers! I hope the towns people were <br />
watching from there homes to spread the word,&quot; Morgana giddily looked about, &quot;I was a little worried that a <br />
hippo wouldn't be quite heavy enough and that I should have gone for an elephant or even rhino but I so rarely <br />
get to make a hippo... It would seem a shame to turn her back...&quot;<br />
<br />
GRRAAAAOOOOOHH<br />
Arn the hippo yelled, grunted or roared. We still aren't sure which.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you could be the famous hippo that beat a dragon! Surely that's better than diaper fetish, gender <br />
confused Prince?&quot;<br />
<br />
Another unintelligible moan and this time Maedel joined in too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh alright! I'll change you back. You elves really are such drama queens. Can't take a joke. Even though I <br />
was serious.&quot;<br />
<br />
-----------------------<br />
<br />
Meanwhile inside the Inn I had asked for water to wash the soot off of Queeny and hopefully wake her but the <br />
barmaid was going to charge me 3 copper pieces! You don't pay 3 copper pieces in the capital of West Kingdom <br />
let alone this sorry little excuse for a kingdom! Luckily, however the bar maid recognized me and I her. It <br />
was the soldier that Morgana had transformed into a busty barmaid. One of 9 soldiers she'd turned into women <br />
earlier in previous chapters. She gave me the water for free and even offered me a drink of ale which I <br />
refused after seeing what happened to the last poor saps that she had given drinks to. Remembering that <br />
particular bit of bizarreness I had the sudden hope that those unlucky fellows ended up on a farm and not on a <br />
plate. It was then I noticed the chicken, or rather hen, in a cage behind the bar and how a lot of the patrons <br />
seemed to be eating fried egg. Some pig-like grunting from the kitchen confirmed my suspicion that this was in <br />
fact the same hen as I'd seen as the end result of the towns strongest soldier coming up against Morgana's <br />
magic. <br />
<br />
Since the dragon wasn't going anywhere soon and Queeny was all cleaned up but still asleep i decided to chat <br />
to the barmaid (it was clear she was asleep and not unconscious from the loud snoring and occasional mutter <br />
about bottom burps.) I finally learnt the barmaids new name she had chosen for herself, or perhaps Morgana's <br />
spell influenced. She was now Jade. Jade the barmaid. She certainly seemed to have the necessary endowments <br />
needed to make the bar an attractive place for the male patrons and so I, being a privileged city girl who <br />
knows little of the real world, decided to see if she was as well equipped for the other thing my brother had <br />
told me barmaids are famous for. No, not &quot;tittyfucking,&quot; whatever that is. Listening to and spreading rumors! <br />
If you want rumors about adventures or gold or dragons, you go to a tavern or Inn and you ask the barmaid and <br />
if she can't tell you she'll surely point you to who can! And let me tell you, Jade was most helpful! <br />
<br />
&quot;Listen in close because I don't want rumors spreading about who told who what, but, the King of Molossia has <br />
managed to separate the dragon side of Ariadne from the human part! She's now his prisoner or slave or <br />
something worse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So the big dragon outside kind of is, Ariadne the DragonKnight?&quot; I ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, half of her.&quot; Jade said.</p>
