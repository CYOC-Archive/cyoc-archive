“I wish you were my slave!” Brian said with a smile.<br />
The fairy responded by laughing<br />
<br />
You are such an isiot that fairy said. “Im the one with the magical powers not you”<br />
And with that he disappeared and then reaperaered outside the jar.<br />
And now I’m going to punish you.<br />
<br />
Brian decided to keep his cool. Ok fairy I had enough of you. You should go now.<br />
<br />
“Oh I will when Im done having some fun”<br />
<br />
The fairy grinned and and then laughed himself silly as Brian tried to decide if he could run. He decided to try, clamoring to his feet and dashing for the door. However, his hand froze just an inch from the doorknob and no matter how he tried, Brian could not move his arm, or any other part of himself for that matter. He heard the fairy say, &quot;Come here, Brian,&quot; and he felt his body move against his will. He almost marched across the room and stood before the small fairy, sweat beginning to form on his brow.<br />
<br />
Brian soon discovered that he could still speak and wasted no time filling the air with colorful metaphors. The small fairy stared at him placidly for a few moments and then held up his hand. Instantly Brian&#39;s voice was gone. Now true fear spread across his face.<br />
&quot;Y&#39;know, Brian,&quot; the intruder said, &quot;Cursing bores me. I need some entertainment, and you&#39;re going to provide it. I think it&#39;s time for a wedgie.&quot; Brian didn&#39;t know what he meant, but he knew he wasn&#39;t going to like it. He suddenly bent over, sticking his bottom out in a comical fashion, and – in the dorkiest voice he ever heard – said, &quot;Why, yes Sir, you&#39;re right! One wedgie coming up, Sir!&quot;<br />
With that Brian watched helplessly as his hands moved of their own volition to his bottom. They plunged into the back of his pants and felt around until they grasped the elastic on his underwear. With strength he never would have believed he had, Brian suddenly pulled his underwear up and into the crack of his ass.<br />
&quot;Here we are, Sir,&quot; he chirruped. &quot;One super wedg – NNNNNAAAARRGH!!&quot; Brian couldn&#39;t believe the pain he felt from this. He instantly thought of the younger boys he&#39;d done this to in the past and wondered how they ever survived. He stood, still bent over and in pain with his underwear sticking out behind him like some ridiculous tail.<br />
The small fairy wasn&#39;t finished with him yet. He said, &quot;Why don&#39;t you keep pulling until you rip your underwear clean off?&quot;<br />
&quot;A wonderful idea, Sir!&quot; Brian hated the stupid voice and what it was saying. He felt tears fill his eyes as his hands wrapped behind him and grabbed the elastic again. He needed three excruciating yanks before he stood before his fairy master holding out his ruined underwear as if it were a prize. Tears were running down the older fairy&#39;s face. The younger fairy approached the terrified Brian and took the underwear from him. As he tossed the ruined cloth away, he spoke gently to Brian for the first time: &quot;Okay, Brian, here&#39;s how things are. You will address me as `Sir&#39; at all times unless told otherwise. I am going to be punishing you for the next few days. The type and severity of your punishment is not negotiable. I dish it out, you take it – period! At first your punishment will happen no matter what. Later on,  you may be punished less frequently. Hopefully there will come a time when I can stop dealing with you and go home.<br />
&quot;Now understand this:, your body will be controlled by me when you&#39;re being punished. It will look like you&#39;re punishing and humiliating yourself, which should be very entertaining to anyone who witnesses your performance. Trust me, lots and lots of people will be watching your humiliation, especially at your school.<br />
Now we need to deal with your foul language. First, let&#39;s get you naked – you better get used to showing everything, buddy!&quot;<br />
Without a word, Brian quickly stripped naked .<br />
<br />
Hey your pretty hot the fairy said looking up and down. Your a well developed young man. Too bad you acted like such a stupid kid. <br />
<br />
Brian turned and stood facing the door that led to his small bathroom. An object came flying out from his shower and hovered right in front of him. Brian began to almost cry when he saw it was his bar of soap.<br />
&quot;I see you know what&#39;s going to happen,&quot; the small fairy said. &quot;I&#39;m giving you an opportunity you don&#39;t deserve – you can show me that you really are capable of learning. I want you to take that soap and wash your mouth out with it. You know how to do it: your dad did it to you more than once. Every time your mouth fills with soapy liquid, you will swallow it and continue until I allow you to stop. Begin.&quot;<br />
When Brian found he could move, he took the bar of soap in his hand and looked at it for a long time trying to decide if he should just submit. Suddenly he remembered that he used this soap to clean his butthole and he became enraged. &quot;No fucking way!&quot; he shouted as he threw it with all his strength directly at Sir&#39;s head. When he saw the soap stop in midair just inches from the fairy&#39;s nose, Brian knew this was going to be bad for him. The small fairy just sighed and said, &quot;I should have known.&quot;<br />
Against his will Brian&#39;s hands rose up and clasped themselves behind his head. He watched as his oak bath brush flew out of the bathroom and hovered before him. Suddenly he spun around and bent over, offering his upraised bottom to the brush. Meanwhile, the bar of soap had taken flight and found its target as Brian&#39;s mouth opened. The spanking started immediately.<br />
The soap began to piston in and out of Brian&#39;s mouth as the bath brush alternately smacked first one cheek and then the other. Every fifth spank was a mighty wallop across both cheeks that cause Brian to swallow the foul soapy liquid that was building in his mouth. He was wriggling and trying to scream from around the intruder in his mouth, but with no success.<br />
He glanced at his tormentor and saw that, instead of paying attention to the suffering young man, he was casually flying around the room looking at whatever Brian had collected there. The small fairy then glanced at the stolen guitar and his face clouded in anger. He glared at Brian, and the ferocity of the miscreant&#39;s spanking increased.<br />
Brian&#39;s entire world had telescoped down to his aching, abused ass and his mouth, which was beginning to foam from the soap moving back and forth over his tongue. He was crying freely now, occasionally emitting a high-pitched squeal, and that was when the spanking stopped. The bar of soap came out of his mouth trailing soapy saliva, and the sobbing fairy was allowed to stand up straight.<br />
&quot;Tell me, Brian,&quot; the fairy said. &quot;Still want to hurt me?&quot; Brian shook his head rapidly, spraying soap all over.<br />
&quot;No, Sir!&quot; he cried through the soapy taste in his mouth. &quot;I&#39;ll never try that again! I learned my lesson, Sir!&quot; The fairy called &quot;Sir&quot; smirked.<br />
&quot;One lesson, at any rate,&quot; he said. &quot;Now it&#39;s time for you to shower and get to bed.&quot;<br />
Before he could react, Brian found him self force-marched into the small shower. The freezing water came on, making Brian squeal.<br />
&quot;Sorry, spanky,&quot; the fairy  said. &quot;You have to earn warm water. Now it&#39;s time to clean you up.&quot;<br />
Brian&#39;s mouth opened and the water shot in with great force to wash out the soap. As he watched, the soap and the brush came together to create a great deal of foam. The brush then began to roughly scrub every inch of his body: Hair, arms, armpits, back and butt, chest and stomach, legs and feet, and finally, his fuzzy scrotum. No one had touched Brian in these places since he was little kid except the occasional girl and he felt totally humiliated.<br />
<br />
A washcloth floated before his eyes and was soon covered in soap. Brian suddenly bent over and his hands flew back to his aching butt cheeks and pulled them apart. The washcloth worked its way into his anus and began sawing in and out rapidly. Brian was groaning, but stayed in position as the washcloth finished reaming him. It twisted in mid air and snapped Brian&#39;s ass twice, making him squeal. Then he was allowed to stand straight and rub his enflamed behind.<br />
&quot;Come here, Brian,&quot; The fairy said. Brian jumped at the sound of his voice and scrambled to stand before the small fairy.&quot;Spread your legs wide.&quot; Brian complied and then groaned when he saw the bath brush floating between his legs, the spanking side aligned with his balls.<br />
&quot;Tell me about the guitar,&quot; Sir said. He was gratified to see the look of panic in the older fairy&#39;s eyes.<br />
&quot;Uh, uh, Sir,&quot; Brian began. &quot;It was ... a gift from my dad.&quot; Instantly Brian&#39;s world was filled with hot, blazing agony as the bath brush slammed into his precious jewels.<br />
&quot;NOOOOOO!&quot; he cried. &quot;AAAAH! MY BALLS! PLEASE! NO MORE!&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s up to you, Brian,&quot; Sir said. &quot;Now tell me about the guitar.&quot; Brian composed himself as best he could, his eyes darting from the waiting brush and back to Sir.<br />
&quot;I stole it, Sir,&quot; he said, crying openly. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, sooo sorry, Sir, please forgive me...&quot;<br />
The small fairy simply held up his hand and said &quot;Ssssh! Quiet. What you did just now is called `telling the truth&#39;. If you always tell the truth – to me or to anyone else – your life will be easier. Do you understand?&quot; Brian nodded his head, and Sir said, &quot;Good. Get to bed.&quot;</p>
