<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a bit of thought, she felt it was worth it to try and guess the password. At worst, her mom would just punish her some more. And that would just happen anyways, so she may as well give her a reason to do it at least. Moving her now too small chair out of the way, Joanna types in her first guess. &quot;Password1&quot;. <br />
<br />
Knowing her mother, and how awful she was at using the internet, she always just used &#39;Password&#39; and more recently &#39;Password1&#39; for literally everything. And wouldn&#39;t you know it, the Chronivac unlocked. She was in. Her nightmare was finally over. But she wanted to make certain of it and ensure that her mother would never know. So she made her mother see and believe that everything was still how she thought it was. But in reality, Joanna undid most of her changes. She shrunk her udders down to nothing, restored her pussy, and shrunk her breasts down to a much more managable size. They were still huge and lactated excessively, but she had always been like this. She restored her legs and feet too. And because she was feeling generous to herself, she gave herself a properly working milking machine. <br />
<br />
After giving it some more thought, she decided to give herself a better body. Having N-cup breasts filled with a very heavy quantity of breast milk had always been a killer on her back and shoulders. So she made them stronger, but in a way which didn&#39;t physically change her appearance by making her overly muscular and actually made her much more slender, and improved her overall figure. Her lips had to also be corrected. She deflated them down to what she felt was correct for herself. Though they were still notably puffier than most girls had. &#39;At least now I can speak more fluently&#39; she thought to herself while licking them all over. <br />
<br />
That was another thing, why did she always lick her lips? She knew it was how she kept her lips moist as she was allergic to chapstick. But could she not just fix that? So she made her lips always moist, which seeemed to have added a permanent shine to them, as well as make their color much more vibrant looking. Joanna looked into her mirror and made a kissy face, then a full pout, then a smile, confirming that she was going to be saving a few extra dollars since she no longer needed to purchase lipstick. <br />
<br />
Looking back at the Chronivac, Joanna also made her nipples an extra 3 inches longer. Knowing from her first hand experience, having the extra length would make milking them so much easier. She could switch over to using the thinner suction cups, which wouldn&#39;t tug and pinch her breasts nearly as much. She changed everyone but her mother&#39;s perception of them to be considered perfectly normal for her to have as well. The last thing she wanted was to make people still think she was a freak of nature. She had been humiliated enough for an entire lifetime. It was something she would never forget nor forgive her mother for.<br />
<br />
Lastly, she password locked the Chronivac once more, only using her own password this time, and disabled her mother&#39;s usage of it entirely. However her mother would never figure that out because of her uniquely altered perception of reality. <br />
<br />
Joanna ran the program after one final look through. However it was paused when an alert appeared. <br />
<br />
&quot;Warning. The system detects that changes are being made by a new user. This will erase the complete transformation history so as to provide the new user a clean slate to reference from. This action is permanent. Do you wish to proceed?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna had no intention of keeping the track record of what her mother had put her through as it was too much of a painful memory. What she didn&#39;t realize was that she was still under the mental rewriting, making her thing that she always was a girl who was cursed with having insanely sized breasts that lactate profusely, and an obsession with her having and maintaining her ankle length hair, as well as a health condition that more or less forced her into wearing high heels at all times with a heel of at least 3 inches or more. As far as she knew, those were normal. She loved her hair and wearing heels. She even had gotten used to her breasts. So she was content with her current form and the minor edits she had just given herself. So she clicked yes and locked the program.</p>
