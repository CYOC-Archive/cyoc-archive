<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He opened his brief case to take out his lunch. Inside he found deep fried grass hoppers, and some chopsticks. Well, he had changed his biology, did he expect his needs to stay the same? <br />
<br />
Looking at Nicole, she looked so damn, HAPPY, it felt actually like a crime to age her up, plus she had her whole life ahead of her, it actually felt like he would be STEALING to age her into an adult. Besides, Mikki for her part was perfectly happy as a teenager working for the company, and Nicole looked perfectly happy as a child, so why should he disrupt their happiness?<br />
<br />
He noticed the predator species were eating all meat lunches, while the herbivores, were indeed acting like herbivores. It was rather strange really. And a reminder these changes in species weren&#39;t just superficial. After seeing so much remain the same, it was a bit of a surprise to see what had indeed come about from his changes.<br />
<br />
He wondered about what had evolved into a crazy goal of making people into furry nudists, but in for a penny, in for a pound. <br />
<br />
This kind of power did make him feel drunk, as pretty much whoever had the pen, had reality in their pocket. He could make dictatorships democracies, he could write diseases out of existence, and while there was clearly a butterfly effect, the revisions seemed to be limited to the individual, for now. Still he was hesitant, who knew what gigantic changes would do to the world, or who it would get the attention of. He could just ask the pen, but if it had any awareness, it was clear it wanted to be used, and used to full effect.<br />
<br />
On the plus side, he found out that the pen couldn&#39;t kill, hopefully that meant it could [i]never[/i] do anything that would accidentally write a person out of existence. <br />
<br />
He went to Nicole&#39;s office-slash-playroom. The place was set up for the mundane mindless grunt work that Nick had been doing anyway, except now Nichole seemed to be doing it with a lot more string in her step, and looking to be perfectly happy about it. <br />
<br />
Dave wondered about child labor laws, but no one seemed to give Nicole being here any thought, and it was clear she wasn&#39;t being used or exploited. <br />
<br />
She was having tea and a fish sandwich with her dolls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Nicole.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Davvey!&quot; She waved cutely.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m feeling okay, uh . . . sorry about that prank this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave shuddered. &quot;It&#39;s okay Nicole, we know you were just playing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave wrote on a small note pad. <br />
<br />
&#39;Nicole will answer these next questions honestly and won&#39;t think them strange.&#39; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nicole, do you like being a little girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes! It&#39;s fun! I get to do important stuff but play at the same time, and all the adults like me! Some of the older kids don&#39;t that adults trust me with so much stuff, but I&#39;m told not to let bullies get to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you want to be an adult?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve always been an adult comes in time, and that I shouldn&#39;t rush it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there anything you want more than anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; . . . I wish I had a playmate at work,&quot; her voice took on a slightly lonely tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Nicole.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome!&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked at Samantha. And thought how an innocent and cute face in Public Relationships could do wonders, or simply have a different point of view. <br />
<br />
&#39;Samantha will transform into a humanoid gazelle that is around Nicole&#39;s age, they&#39;ll be best of friends, always look out for each other, and can always rely on each other. Samantha will be a boon to the PR department in her own special way. And both Nicole and Samantha will be happy. Mikki will not have trouble looking after both of them at work while still doing her own job.&#39;<br />
<br />
Samantha&#39;s clothes faded away, and he could see her extremely hot figure, but didn&#39;t feel as overwhelmingly attracted to her as he thought he would, then again, she was a mammal, he was a reptile. <br />
<br />
Her age reversed on her, going past puberty, he breasts shrinking to nothing,and her figure becoming rounder, at the same time, covering everything at a fast pace, was white fur covering the inside of her limbs and her front and neck, black fur that went as a strip down her entire body, and brown fur that covered the outside of her body and backside. Two tiny stubs of horns formed on her head, as her ears grew quite large, and her eyes became large and solid black, while her face became a muzzle. Her limbs became thinner, and more delicate, while her feet became hooves made to balance on two legs, while her hands came four digits each, ending in armored fingers that clicked whenever she tapped them together. A tiny thin tail emerged from her rear. <br />
<br />
The office blurred and did some rearranging, and now Samantha&#39;s office was right next to Nicole&#39;s &#39;office&#39; and the two merged together, the wall between them having been taken out ages ago. <br />
<br />
Now Nichole and Samantha were chatting up a storm, talking about the little imagery soap opera that had going with their dolls, and how things were going in their respective branches of the company. Samantha was now wearing a set of blue bows that mirrored Nicole&#39;s pink ones, except the last one was around her waist rather than her tiny tail. <br />
<br />
And the two looked positively adorable together. It would be a crime to separate them.<br />
<br />
Seeing he still had some time, he left his office again and went down to the place of damned souls, better known as the telemarketer section.<br />
<br />
These were the people without friends, family, and had long since given up all hopes and dreams. They saw none as people, including themselves, only number to call, voices on the other end to make a sales pitch to, in the mindless futile task that maybe one of them will accept the offer. Not to mention how many people considered telemarketing itself criminal. <br />
<br />
These men had long since lost their souls, and were doomed to their futile existence forever that was part of the tiny gears that made up the big machine. <br />
<br />
Well, if they were going to be machines, they might as well be. <br />
<br />
He wrote down.<br />
<br />
&#39;Any of the telemarketers in the telemarketing section, who fit my stereotype I&#39;m thinking of: of a soulless drone who has already lost their humanity and with no loved ones or family, will transform into an android girl. They will be completely capable of emotions, and free will, and be respected as PEOPLE and individuals with rights and privileged rather than pieces of equipment by the company and everyone else.&#39; <br />
<br />
Except for one mother who was there to support her family, and a couple of interns, the majority of telemarketers began to change. <br />
<br />
Their skin became shinny like plastic, their eyes looked possessed and doll like, and all became became young, innocent, and girlie looking. Some were dressed in fluffy dresses, while a couple were wearing swim suits! One was wearing a tank top and shorts and was bare foot. A thin white dress. Their hair, it was mostly long and platinum blond, but others had it blue, green, neon-red, cut short, boyish, in spiral curls. It made the telemarketer&#39;s section look like an anime convention. Their ears now looked like little plastic cell phones almost the same color as their air.  <br />
<br />
The SHOCKING part was that they were all smiling!<br />
<br />
Cords were jacked into their ears, and they seemed to be doing their job of calling potential clients, and happily chatting the day away with each other at the same time! Seemed their sale pitches didn&#39;t take much brain power. <br />
<br />
Some chatted about their hobbies, others about boys, the &#39;younger&#39; ones chatted about colorful ponies, some chatted about the newest action movie others mentioned the latest internet meme. All in all, they acted more alive and more human than when they had been human!  <br />
<br />
Their relentlessly cheerful demeanor Dave would find had actually increased ever so slightly the number of clients won from the unholy practice of telemarketing. <br />
<br />
Dave for a bit feared he might have turned them into slaves, but when Dave looked over the books, if ANYTHING,  they now had a BETTER contract with the company than they did before! Apparently now that they were expensive machines rather than expendable grunts who you could replace with the blink of an eye, the company had to treat them with respect least they go to ANOTHER company to serve their function that was their reason for living.</p>
