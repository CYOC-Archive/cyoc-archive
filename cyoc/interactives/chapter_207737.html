<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ugh not my mom I don&#39;t wanna ruin my buzz,&quot; Moonbeam sighed. &quot;Lets start with July.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Age Room agreed, Moonbeam now gazing over the aqua marine room, what would it look like seeing July return? Would she get pregnant at 10? The sound of a small infant whimpering drew the child hippies attention, Moonbeam glancing over at a crumpled maternity dress, a small lump seemed to be wiggling underneath it and was rapidly increasing in size.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa,&quot; she stated in awe. Moonbeam now rose to her feet, quickly grabbing her bellbottoms that threatened to cascade down her narrow hips. The child giggled, glancing at her voluminous clothing, realizing she was standing on several inches of empty material. &quot;This is trippy man,&quot; she giggled. &quot;I like shrank too much.&quot; <br />
<br />
Realizing that walking would be next to impossible, the girl now began shuffling towards the maternity dress, feeling as if she was ice skating on her own jeans. Giggling drunkenly, she now peered into the dress, her mouth gaping in astonishment. <br />
<br />
A small infant now stirred within the confines of the dress, slowly swelling in size as she grew older. Moonbeam was astounded, immediately recognizing a returned July. &quot;Oh man July is back,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Its like she was birthed from the cosmos man. I...I think I&#39;m freaking out, this is wild!&quot;<br />
<br />
As Moonbeam now muttered incoherently to herself, July continued to grow. Passing one and racing towards two, the toddler now slowly stood inside her tent like maternity dress, trying to piece together what had happened.<br />
<br />
As the girl passed three and became four, her mind began to clear. The fog that had clouded her mind began to dissipate. She gasped as she reached five, remembering everything that had happened from the moment she entered the room to eventual unbirth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god,&quot; she whispered, pulling the dress around. &quot;I...I disappeared. Vanished. My...mom...&quot; July paused, still in shock from her ordeal as she now craned her neck up to gaze at the 10 year old girl in front of her. &quot;Mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa you can talk,&quot; Moonbeam said softly. &quot;Wow man I&#39;m like tripping hard. You came back! Birthed from the cosmos after vanishing into the void. This is so wild!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom why are you a kid,&quot; July exclaimed, the girl now growing to six, fidgeting with her fat too large dress.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was on my way to becoming one with the universe July,&quot; she smiled. &quot;Shrinking down to non existence, about to join you on this cosmic trip to the beginning of time.&quot; Moonbeam now broke intoa fkt of giggles, swaying back and forth as she clutched herself tightly. <br />
<br />
July simply sighed as she grew back to 8, this was why she had run away from home at 17. Moonbeam was a nice person to hang around with but she was seriously lacking in the mom department. More concerned with expanding her mind or communing with nature, July had felt lost as a child, neglected for her mothers good time. No wonder she had gotten pregnant at 20.<br />
<br />
The realization of her own child now caused July to gasp. She remembered now what happened to Amanda. How she had gotten so freaked out at her own pregnancy. Before Amanda was born, July had been petrified of being as neglectful a mother as Moonbeam. She hadn&#39;t been ready to be anyone&#39;s mother, that changed after she held Amanda for the first time. <br />
<br />
The memory of being a mother though had been erased following Amandas unbirth, July now going pale as she realized she had doomed Amanda to non existence, in very much the same way her own mother had. Looking towards the catatonic Moonbeam, the 9 year old now grasped her, shaking the slightly older child out of her stupor. &quot;Mom! Moonbeam! Snap out if it, where&#39;s Amanda?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s Amanda,&quot; Moonbeam asked drunkenly.<br />
<br />
&quot;My daughter you idiot,&quot; July yelled angrily. &quot;Will you snap out of it Damn It!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Moonbeam stated. &quot;I like totally spaced on that. The magic man here did say something about a grand kid. Like the future of my line, I&#39;m like so excited to see the cosmos show me the future man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about,&quot; July exclaimed, the girl finally settling at 10 years of age. Glancing at herself, she grunted in frustration. Her maternity dress now brushed her shins, for whatever reason she had stopped growing, now finding herself the same age and size as her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom will you focus,&quot; July groaned. &quot;Why are we kids? I need to find Amanda, will you snap out of it! We have to find your granddaughter!&quot;<br />
<br />
Moonbeam returned a goofy smile, the hippy child&#39;s eyes glazed over, July grunting in frustration. She recognized that look from her own youth, her mother so caught up in her own world that she failed to notice what was going on with others. As July was about to slap her child mother in the face, she paused as she heard the whimpering of an infant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa it happened again,&quot; Moonbeam stated in awe. &quot;This is so wild. The cosmos birthed another from my line! I&#39;m literally watching my line created from the brought into existence by the the cosmos itself man. This is so groovy!&quot;<br />
<br />
July said nothing, casting a weary glance at her mother before rushing to the discarded blouse and slacks on the floor. Already she could see a small lump struggling within its contents trying to free itself. Quickly digging through the clothes, July gasped, nearly bursting into tears as she beheld her infant daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God Amanda,&quot; she cried, picking up the shivering infant and cradling her to her chest. &quot;Oh baby, oh God I&#39;m sorry. Everything will be okay baby, mommy promises.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa you&#39;re like a mom,&quot; Moonbeam said in awe. &quot;Thats like so heavy man. Like your my kid, who like looks like a kid, with a kid. Were like children of the cosmos man. Its wild!&quot;<br />
<br />
July frowned, clutching her growing daughter tightly to her chest. Amanda at least appeared to be safe and growing up. Still, July and Moonbeam were only ten years old. Far too young to take care of themselves in the world. Honestly, if July thought about it, Moonbeam wasn&#39;t very good of taking care of anyone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh July you gotta watch,&quot; Moonbeam said excitedly. &quot;Like the rest of my line is coming. Amandas daughter will be here and then you&#39;re going see my mom and my groovy grandma. Its gonna be wild man, six generations all in the same place at the same time.&quot;<br />
<br />
July said nothing, simply casting her mother a scornful look as she watched her own daughter grow. For the time being at least she and Amanda were safe. She just needed to think now what her next move should be.</p>
