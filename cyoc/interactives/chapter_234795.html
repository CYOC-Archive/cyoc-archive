<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite Alex was only 5 inches tall, in his perspective he was on his regular size and everything else turned giant. The scene was beyond surrealistic, those giant alien staring at him, the parking lot size table where he was put on and his sister&#39;s enormous butt briefly above him. He wished that was just a nightmare and he could wake up at his bedroom, but no, this was completely real.<br />
<br />
&quot;Test subject vital signs are fine. Initiating the age acceleration.&quot; One of the huge aliens said and he turned on the weird beam machine above Alex. It made a neon blue light that covered the whole table and of course, Alex, who can&#39;t do anything to avoid being exposed to it. &quot;Test subject heart beats are increasing.&quot; The alien said. &quot;That has been normal on every awaken test subject we have had before.&quot;<br />
<br />
The alien seemed more interested on their monitors than on what&#39;s happening with Alex who was groaning and complaining in pain. It was like the light was hot and it was starting to burn his skin, but that wasn&#39;t what it&#39;s happening. Alex kept his eyes closed, so he can&#39;t see that his body was changing, he was growing up several years in a matter of seconds.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t look like a 12 years old boy anymore, puberty had started to hit him and his height shot up. His muscles were bulging out and some hairs were sprouting. However, he was growing so fast that it was hard to tell if he looked like a 15, 16 or 18 years old boy. He kept groaning in pain but his voice now sounded deeper and manlier. Now, he resembled more a guy post puberty than a teenager.<br />
<br />
He was a young adult now, maybe between 24 or 25 years old, with an impressive height, muscles and masculinity coming out from every pore on his skin. However he was still getting older and that masculinity was maturing like a fine cheese. His height and limbs stopped growing, but his muscles were still developing, long gone was that fit physique and now he&#39;s looking more bulky like a bodybuilder.<br />
<br />
The body hair which had grown on his legs, crotch and armpits when he hit puberty now was thickening and growing out in another areas like his chest, arms, face and surprisingly, butt. He wasn&#39;t a hairy beast but definitely genetic was pushing him on the above average group. Now Alex looked like a man around his mid thirties, like 20 years older from where he started.<br />
<br />
&quot;Process complete. Test subject vital signs are a little bit high, but nothing to worry about.&quot; One of the aliens said. &quot;Fantastic. It thought he won&#39;t gonna make it. Now the human male is more suitable for our purposes.&quot; They kept looking to their monitors while a grown man Alex had passed out on the table. At least, he&#39;s still alive. A spoon like device came out from the ceiling and took Alex&#39;s body and place it on a small cage that looked like a mix between a dollhouse and a hamster cage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey kid, kid. Are you okay?&quot; Alex heard a voice calling him. It sound deep and rough, like the one of an old man. Alex started to recover his senses despite he still had a strong headache and can&#39;t stand up for now. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; He asked with a voice that he won&#39;t recognize if he wasn&#39;t so dizzy. &quot;It seems they also caught you. You&#39;re trapped here with us.&quot; Alex look and noticed a man&#39;s face staring at him. He looked like in his sixties.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are we?&quot; Alex asked while he still tries to feel better from his previous pain. &quot;We&#39;re not completely sure. Some people think we&#39;re on a spaceship but I think we&#39;re still on the hotel. Unless the whole hotel is a spaceship. You seemed sick, don&#39;t you want some water?&quot; Alex nodded and then he got a paper cup of water, when he extended his arms to take it he noticed that they felt heavier and... bigger.<br />
<br />
He suddenly realized what had just happened and immediately opened his eyes astounded. He realized that he now had a bigger older body and that he was completely naked in front of a stranger, or maybe more than one... &quot;Oh, shut!&quot; He yelled to himself while he shamefully tried to cover his privates and butt with his hands. &quot;You don&#39;t have to do that, kid. You&#39;ve been unconscious for a few hours. We had seen you and you don&#39;t have anything we hadn&#39;t seen before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice butt, by the way.&quot; Another male voice from behind told to Alex. He turned around and noticed a young man, maybe on his late twenties, staring at his butt. He was completely naked and Alex turned around ashamed because he hadn&#39;t seen another person naked before even less a grownup. &quot;A little bit hairy for my taste, but I can work with it.&quot; The young man kept saying before he slapped Alex&#39;s butt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hahaha. Kid, you looked pretty embarrassed but don&#39;t worry, we&#39;re all friends here.&quot; The old man said. &quot;He&#39;s Louis, he&#39;s the youngest lad around here, that&#39;s why he thinks he&#39;s the alpha male and use to make that kind of comments.&quot; The old man said while he put a hand on Alex&#39;s shoulder. &quot;My name is Otto and I used to be a chef at the hotel before I was caught by those aliens. What&#39;s your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Alex... I came with my sister, Sophie. We we&#39;re exploring the hotel when we find out this place. She got caught and they used and age beam that turned her older. It tried to save her but they shrunk me and then they used that age beam on me!&quot; It seemed that Alex&#39;s anxiety was increasing once again. &quot;Calm down, kid. Do you mean they used a machine to make you older? How old are you originally?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m twelve.&quot; Alex replied. &quot;Holy shit!!&quot; Louis shouted. &quot;I was thinking of doing it with a baby! I&#39;m not a pedophile!&quot; &quot;Hey, I&#39;m not a baby!&quot; Alex yelled back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Incredible.&quot; Otto said. &quot;If we weren&#39;t five inches tall I won&#39;t believe in your words. You even look older than Louis.&quot; He rubbed his nape. &quot;Now I understand why you were so ashamed of being seen naked. I hope you have learned about puberty at school because I won&#39;t go to have the talk with you.&quot; Alex was confused and replied. &quot;The talk? What&#39;s that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha! He doesn&#39;t even know what it is!!&quot; Louis began to laugh. &quot;Considering you have the biggest package of all of us, it&#39;s ironic you don&#39;t know how to use it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve already told you I won&#39;t give you the talk.&quot; Otto said. &quot;Ask Louis or Scott about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s Scott?&quot; Alex asked and he immediately got a response. &quot;Me.&quot; Another male voice sounded from behind. Alex turned around and noticed another naked man, this time around thirty years old. &quot;And I won&#39;t give him the talk either. If you want to know about it, you&#39;ll have to figure it out by yourself.&quot; He looked at Otto, then at Louis and then he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have more important things to do right now and we need all the help we can get. Are you going to help us or are you going to stay there wondering how your dick works?&quot; Alex doesn&#39;t know what to say, so he just nodded. &quot;Wait, my dick works different now?&quot; He wondered while he followed the other three men. He softly rubbed his dick but immediately stopped embarrassed when he felt a tingle going through him.</p>
