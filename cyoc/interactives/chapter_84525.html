<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I stood there some perplexed by how things were going. When I&#39;d made the wish, it had come from a somewhat perverted part of my mind. In other words, I was a typical teenager. I had no idea that the consequences of the wishes I&#39;d made would go this far. I&#39;d expected that the wish would only turn my mother and her club into bisexual werewolves that changed whenever they got horny. I did not expect that Mrs. Flemington&#39;s daughter, Clarissa would also become a werewolf and one who was born a werewolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;The ring must also be able to affect reality as well as simply creating or changing things,&quot; I thought to myself as played with my hands for a moment to look at the ring. It was still there, and had strangely grown larger when I changed and shrank back down when I returned to human form.<br />
<br />
If the ring changed realities and that Clarissa had been BORN a werewolf, how many other werewolves were out there? The ring had obviously made a drastic change which would have to mean that werewolves had always existed and always transformed when they were horny. You also made a not to relook through the old werewolf movies you&#39;d watched. If the myths around werewolves had changed, thanks to the ring, movies like American Werewolf In London might be more of a sex film now. That still left me with having to deal with the fact that one, I had several older woman who turned into werewolves when aroused and after doing so had to release that sexual energy, preferably with me, two, I had a girlfriend whom I didn&#39;t really want to break up with, and three, I was being told I essentially needed to marry and have kids and that a different girl was the best choice because she already was a werewolf and was only waiting to change. If I knew the consequences would be as great I wouldn&#39;t have made the wishes in the first place, at least not made such big perverted wishes that I was privately sure Sara would break up with me over... unless I abused the ring further.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Joe... will you be my daughter&#39;s mate?&quot; Mrs. Flemington asked, &quot;Her wolf is coming and is getting ready to emerge fully... as is her eighteenth birthday. It&#39;s been coming out in small ways since she was thirteen and its getting stronger. Sooner or later she will get horny and change on her own or she will turn eighteen and as a mature werewolf she will be driven to become aroused and release what has been dormant within her. Once she changes she should be fine... but due issues related to the first transformation, she could either infect someone who doesn&#39;t want to be a werewolf, which will create other problems we... that YOU would have to contend with as the Alpha Male... or she&#39;d accidentally kill someone before she has control.&quot;<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t want that to happen, but you and Sara weren&#39;t on bad terms, though she didn&#39;t fully how much of a pervert you were. As such, you had no reason to just break up with with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Sara?&quot; I asked slowly, &quot;She has been a good girlfriend and I have no explicit reason to break up with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Flemington opened her mouth to speak before I raised a hand to cut her off.<br />
<br />
&quot;No reason that would not involve telling her the complete truth,&quot; I said pointedly, &quot;She&#39;s smart enough that if I try a lie, she&#39;ll know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can&#39;t be exposed,&quot; Mrs. Vranch spoke quickly, &quot;You&#39;ll have to either take Clarissa as your mate or kill her, and Karen will never let you kill her daughter, Alpha or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to kill anyone and I will admit that I have had a bit of a thing for Clarissa...&quot; I said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what&#39;s the problem?&quot; Mrs. Vranch asked, &quot;Just break up with the girl...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And be what you guys have generally complained about?&quot; I asked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a bit different from the jerks in our past relationships,&quot; Mrs. Gabrielli commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;But we should let him be noble,&quot; my mother spoke up, &quot;It is different, yes... but if we simply brush things off as different, we&#39;ll be no different from the men that thought their behavior was different from what was common and decent.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other women were silent for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;ll tell Sara that you&#39;re switching girlfriends and telling her the truth why?&quot; Mrs. Flemington asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was actually thinking about both,&quot; I said weakly with a slight blush.<br />
<br />
&quot;Typical,&quot; Mrs. Gabrielli commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two mates?&quot; Mrs. Flemington asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not like you are presently monogamists, if you&#39;re all having sex with each other whenever you change and needing me to mate with you every time you change and I&#39;m around,&quot; I pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s Pack bonding,&quot; Mrs. Flemington answered, &quot;we don&#39;t have children together and while there is the chance that you might impregnate one of us... it isn&#39;t likely.&quot;<br />
<br />
I watched as the others nodded, and I only raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;We only meet to transform on nights when we&#39;re not ovulating, dear,&quot; my mom told me, placing one hand on my shoulder, as if trying to explain things, &quot;Though we are hornier on those nights...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it that&#39;s why you always lock the door in your bedroom... and I think moving something heavy in front of it?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My dresser with its mirror,&quot; my mom nodded, &quot;and yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But with regard to having children... that is something only the Alphas do,&quot; Mrs. Flemington spoke, &quot;If any of us wanted to become mothers, we&#39;d need to leave the Pack... or you would need to change the Pack&#39;s rules with regard to monogamy...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could do that?&quot; I asked, trying not to sound to enthusiastic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Within this Pack, yes, that is your right as the Alpha Male,&quot; Mrs. Flemington answered, &quot;but given that other than Clarissa, we are all at least ten years older than you, I doubt you want to have kids with us...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though we could arrange an &quot;accident&quot; given that he doesn&#39;t seem to mind having sex with us,&quot; Mrs. Gabrielli smirked.<br />
<br />
That only earned her an icy look from Mrs. Flemington. Mrs. Gabrielli seemed almost be trying to start another orgy.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, if you do decide to do that, you would need to persuade Sara to accept it willingly and she would need to be okay with not only you having sex with Clarissa but having sex with all of us and all of us having sex with her,&quot; Mrs. Flemington then spoke, &quot;are you sure that she will be that open... or that much of a pervert to enjoy it?&quot;<br />
<br />
You thought to the ring for a moment and said, &quot;I&#39;m sure I could talk her into it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that is what you intend to do?&quot; Mrs. Flemington asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; you said after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you&#39;ll need to bring her here and explain and if need be we can demonstrate,&quot; Mrs. Flemington advised, &quot;If she accepts then all you have to do is mate with her...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No biting?&quot; I asked stupidly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That works too, but I&#39;d thing sex is a more pleasurable way to become a werewolf,&quot; my mom commented.<br />
<br />
A slight scent of arousal went through them. You then got up before things got out of hand, again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I&#39;ll go get her and bring her back here, try to stay under control until we get back,&quot; I urged.<br />
<br />
The group nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll also call Clarissa and tell her to come join us and meet who will be her mates,&quot; Mrs. Flemington spoke as I walked out,</p>
