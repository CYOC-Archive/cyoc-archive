<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your sister had made plans yesterday at school to host a sleepover. It was the perfect plan since her brother wouldn&#39;t be home until tomorrow from wherever he went for a week.<br />
<br />
She had already went out and rented a movie for her and her friends to watch, besides that she planned to just get a pizza and hang out. Jeff was excited at the prospect of seeing more girls potentially nude, his male fantasy of a female slumber party. In reality stuff like that can&#39;t really happen can it? <br />
<br />
The evening comes and your sisters friends begin showing up one after another. Since this is a pretty small get together they plan to spend the entire night just in your sisters room, keeping out of your mothers way. <br />
<br />
Your sisters breasts bounce around every single time she runs down the stairs to open the door for a new guest, then again when she runs up the stairs to show them to her room where everyone else is gathered.<br />
<br />
As the last of the guests show up you can hear a bit of your mother taking in the kitchen, she&#39;s on the phone with someone. &quot;HUH! I&#39;m so sorry I assumed you meant shoe up a week from the intial event! So you meant before!? What. Can&#39;t turn back otherwise!? Yes. Yes. I&#39;ll bring him right away.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your sister doesn&#39;t know what she&#39;s talking about but calls out to her, &quot;You okay mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
Your mother frantically calls back trying to play it cool, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it! I&#39;m just going to have to run out, you girls will be alright home alone right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah grins, &quot;Of course! We are legal adults after all! Technically about to start college! We can handle being home alone for a few hours I&#39;m sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll always be my little girl in my eyes!&quot; Your mother teasingly calls back.<br />
<br />
Your mother runs upstairs to her room and grabs what she thinks is Jeff in green bra form. Unknown to her that the real Jeff was currently holding onto Sarah&#39;s breasts.<br />
<br />
She left leaving your sister and her guests to their own. They all gathered in her bedroom and Sarah sat out all the snacks she had prepared. Some of Sarah&#39;s friends had begun looking through Sarah&#39;s closet, admiring all of Sarah&#39;s expensive outfits.<br />
<br />
Sarah had on many occasions wasted her earnings from her part time jobs on a assortment of clothing. She prided herself on her collection so seeing her friends interested she happily offered if they would &quot;Like to have a little fashion show?&quot;<br />
<br />
Thus the movie was put on hold as the girls began throwing together outfits for each other. Without anyone else home they were free to use all the bathrooms as changing rooms, clothing becoming piled in all of them. <br />
<br />
Girls removed their bras and panties switching them with better colors to match the outfits. Sarah was no exception, at some point removing Jeff and swapping him with a black laced bra that better matched her outfit. Jeff was sad to be removed, but that sadness was gone once he realized he was left in the bathroom on the floor, now able to watch as the girls changed inside.<br />
<br />
After an hour or so of fashion fun the girls got tired of the game. Everyone was super helpful in running around and picking up all of the clothing they had left thrown about the many bathrooms and Sarah&#39;s bedroom. <br />
<br />
Hanging all the dresses back up all that remained were skirts and undergarments that were left in a pile. The skirts could be hung in the closets, but when it came to the undergarments it was a mix of no one quite sure which was theirs. Sarah shrugged it off, &quot;Eh, we&#39;re all pals here, if anyone is missing something we can always switch it back later.&quot;<br />
<br />
So Jeff was left in the pile on the floor as the girls started their movie. Some of them lay on Sarah&#39;s couch while others ate at a small table Sarah had prepared to keep the mess to a minimum. It was boring watching the girls silently watch a movie.<br />
<br />
A quiet snap sound was barely heard by anyone but Jeff. One of Sarah&#39;s friends, Macy, got up from the floor and walked towards the door eyeing the floor. Walking past the pile of undergarments with her foot she grabbed onto one of Jeff&#39;s cups kicking him out into the hallway. <br />
<br />
Once outside the others view she picked Jeff up and carried him by his strap into the nearest bathroom. She took her shirt off revealing her bra strap had snapped, &quot;stupid straps, this is probably one of Nikki&#39;s cheap bras anyway, of course I&#39;d be the one to break it.&quot; She threw the bra beside the bathtub. She grabbed my cup and placed them gently onto her breasts, &quot;I&#39;m not buying a new one for her, so I&#39;ll never let them know this happened. Plus Sarah said it was cool if we ended up with someone else&#39;s stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
She gave it no more thought as she put her shirt back on over Jeff. She walked back down the hall and returned to the movie lying down on the floor.<br />
<br />
Macy was much different from Sarah, for one thing she wasn&#39;t as big in the chest as Sarah which meant she had to tighten Jeff more. Her nipples were much more rough than Sarah&#39;s, Jeff wondered why that might be. A genetic thing he supposed.<br />
<br />
The girls enjoyed their movie, once it was over they all laid out sleeping bags and climbed inside to sleep on Sarah&#39;s floor. Sarah being a great host had decided to sleep on the floor also so no one would get to sleep in a comfortable bed. <br />
<br />
Macy&#39;s sleeping body heat warmed Jeff as he lay under her breasts pinned down. A few hours later he heard his mother quietly sneak back into the house. She ran into her room we quietly as she could, you could hear her throwing her drawers open looking for something. She must be looking for you.<br />
<br />
She entered Sarah&#39;s room quiet as she could, slowly creeping around the girls and looking into Sarah&#39;s closet and dresser. She pulled out her bras looking them over but couldn&#39;t find any green bras that could have been her transformed son.<br />
<br />
She even went as far as to creep over to Sarah and eye down her shirt, a black bra resting there proved Sarah didn&#39;t have Jeff. If only she had known about the girls fashion show or had checked the other girls she might have found Jeff. Instead panicking she returned to her own room to continue searching.<br />
<br />
Throughout the rest of the night while you lay beneath Macy&#39;s soft breasts you could hear your mother desperately looking for you. This only further proved to Jeff that his situation was more grim then he had expected. <br />
<br />
Was he going to be Stuck as a bra forever?<br />
<br />
Morning came, the last day it was possible for Jeff to safely transform back and not be stuck as a bra for the rest of his bra existence.<br />
<br />
The girls woke up and one by one left Sarah&#39;s house, thanking her for hosting such a great sleepover. Macy got out of her sleeping bag with Jeff still around her chest. She packed up her stuff and left like the others, climbing into her car  and unknowingly taking you away from your only chance at becoming human again.<br />
<br />
After everyone had left your mother with no other option began debating weather she should tell her daughter about this in the hope she might know something. Who else would have Jeff if not her? <br />
<br />
Macy made it home and removed Jeff from her chest, hanging him in her closet to give back another time if she rememberered. It wasn&#39;t exactly something important after all.<br />
<br />
Your mother finally spilled the beans. Your sister gasp and nervously admitted what she had done. Your mother was furious and demanded she bring her brother down right this instant while there was still time to turn him back.<br />
<br />
Sarah went up to her room and looked all over, but the comfortable green bra was no where to be found.<br />
<br />
In a panic she recounted the story of the previous nights events, how the last place she had seen Jeff was when she took him off in the bathroom. The searched everywhere but found no bra. That&#39;s when it hit Sarah that the other girls had swapped bras around as well. The sinking realization that one of her friends had unknowingly taken her brother home as if he were truly just another bra.<br />
<br />
Your mother was horrified when Sarah shared this theory. What could they possibly do?</p>
