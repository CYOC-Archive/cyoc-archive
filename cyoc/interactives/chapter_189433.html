<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/><i>I realised much too late that I assigned the gardens to the first level of the upper hall, and the harem is on the second level. So just imagine that there are multiple levels of garden too (same for Luma&#39;s quarters on the southern side).</i></div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">So exhausted was Ty that at first her sleep was deep and dreamless. However, as the night passed towards dawn, the red light of her heat began to break through, illuminating confused scenes of lust and submission. One final dream came, vivid and clear to all her senses.<br />
<br />
<i>Once again she and Steph were releasing the other players from the witch&#39;s curse, but their roles were rather reversed. Ty was the vixen, and she was the one down on her knees, sucking and licking at cock to revert her potential allies. And behind her, Steph -- as the Orckish warrior -- was &quot;encouraging&quot; her by thrusting hard into Ty&#39;s wet cunny with her oversized horse penis.<br />
<br />
Again and again cum sprayed into Ty&#39;s mouth. Or, in some cases, she found herself lapping up both male and female essence, as with the wolf atop the elfmaid.<br />
<br />
Finally, they were done. &quot;Finally,&quot; Ty said, laying back on the grass and spreading her legs to the crowd of freed heroes. &quot;I can have somebody else fuck me besides Steph.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then he realised with a shock that he was about to be gang-banged by nearly forty people --!</i><br />
<br />
&quot;No! Wait!&quot; Jerking upright in bed, Ty clutched the bedspread to his bosom. <i>His bosom.</i> Drawing in a long, ragged breath, he let the sheet drop and gazed down at <i>her</i> body. The large, smooth expanse of her breasts shone pearly grey in the faint light of dawn filtering past the curtains. He could also just see the bridge of her muzzle, and the top of her black nosepad.<br />
<br />
He let the breath out in a long, sad sigh. <i>Who am I? The vixen Tyana, or...?</i><br />
<br />
Once more he came up blank. His dreams had jarred something loose from his subconscious, and he felt... well, &quot;male&quot; again; but he could not recall why he should.<br />
<br />
Slipping out of bed, he ran his hands over his body. Soft fur over yielding flesh; breasts, hips, ass. Labia and vagina and clitoris. He was certainly a female in body, and he felt proud of it. Yet uneasy, suppressed memories whispered that his pride in her beauty and sexuality was a fraud, a fabrication meant to enslave him.<br />
<br />
He ran his fingers back up to the collar around his neck. Feeling around the leather, he could find no way to open it. But, as his fingers touched the back, they tingled and he <i>knew</i> that if he pulled, the seamless band would open, and he would be free. But -- he could not disappoint his Mistress like that.<br />
<br />
Even with the knowledge that the collar itself was responsible for his feelings of devotion towards the ninetailed Kitsune.<br />
<br />
Or was it? The memory of Luma was certainly still fresh in her mind. Warmth suffused Tyana at the thought, and she hugged herself in ecstasy. Luma had made her feel so... so... <i>desired</i>. Desirable.<br />
<br />
Ty shook his head, and sat back on the bed. Something had to give. Either accept the promise of his new life as <i>her,</i> or fight back and find a way to free himself from the enchantments that Mistress and Master had placed on him.<br />
<br />
To start with, he reasoned, he needed to recall what his life had been before the Master transformed him. The fact that his memory was only clear for the past day or so frightened him, but he pushed past the fear. Concentrated. He drew up what he could remember. And, ironically, it was Mistress Luma&#39;s own words that pointed him in the right direction.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Who once was a human boy... who became an Elfmaid ranger... a frog girl... Rescued your friends, defeated that pretentious witch... but caught by the Master of Slaves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Right!</i> And the Master of Slaves had said something similar, when he had scanned Ty.<br />
<br />
And so it fell into place. Her adventures as a frog girl in defeating the Stone Witch; defeating the goblins; and rescuing all her friends. Her first entry into the world as the Dark Elven ranger, Sorhafe. And before that...<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Human boy.&quot;</i> That was harder to grasp, and she shivered again. She <i>was</i> fairly certain she had been male then, although the only cock she could remember between her legs was Luma&#39;s. Maybe Rhea&#39;s. Confusedly her hand went to her clitoris, shuddering more at the touch. Yes, she thought she could recall it... longer... less sensitive, but more powerful...<br />
<br />
With a frustrated huff she shook her head. It was the image of Luma&#39;s heavy balls and vulpine spire that she saw, renewing her own feminine identity -- as well as her <i>need</i>; and she did not want to be distracted. Withdrawing her hand, she took several deep breaths and tried to think of other aspects of her life before the Game.<br />
<br />
But the room was saturated with the smell of her sex; she could even smell a cocktail of her sisters and Luma from the fluids they had left on her. Slowly she stood up, and wandered out of her room, along corridors she half-remembered Vala pointing out. And then she was outdoors, in the private section of the roof garden walled off for the harem&#39;s use.<br />
<br />
She inhaled deeply, letting the early morning breeze free her of the stale odours clinging to her fur. Going to the parapet, she leaned out, and looked east to the Sun rising over the sea. Now in the light and fresh air, she was able again to focus on her human identity.<br />
<br />
She had been a student at some kind of school, she recalled. She had been the Dungeon Master for her roleplaying group. She remembered her parents. But all other details remained foggy. She could not even recall what she looked like as a human -- in such scenes of Tyler&#39;s life as she could picture, she was still the vixen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God...&quot;<br />
<br />
She closed her eyes, feeling tears welling at the loss. &quot;I guess I&#39;m truly... trapped like this...&quot; A vixen whore. What was even the point of imagining escape from the Pleasure Palace? Her life would be much the same anywhere else. And here she was wanted. She sniffed, remembering the love radiating from her fellow concubines. <i>That</i> at least hadn&#39;t been an illusion...<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong, little sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
She jumped at the kindly voice. Putting her back to the parapet, she saw the tall, golden figure of Rhea approaching along the garden path.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I couldn&#39;t sleep.&quot; She felt oddly guilty about the thoughts she&#39;d been entertaining. &quot;How did you...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I <i>am</i> the chief concubine,&quot; Rhea reminded her, smiling as she came up. &quot;I have a sixth sense where my little sisters are concerned. Not as strong a connexion as Mistress Luma&#39;s; but akin to it.&quot; She lifted a hand, and Ty instinctively bowed her head, letting Rhea gently stroke her hair. &quot;And I can tell something is wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmrrrr...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to tell me, if you don&#39;t want to. But I think you might find it a relief.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; Ty looked up, meeting the taller Kitsune&#39;s kind gaze. She took a breath. &quot;I... don&#39;t know. Who I am, what I want... I&#39;ve been enchanted, enslaved... that isn&#39;t what I wanted, but...&quot; She stopped, choked by a sob.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my dear.&quot; Rhea put her other arm around Ty, and drew her softly into a hug. Ty hugged her back, trying to repress her sobs as she leaned into the body of the harem chief. Despite their nakedness, and the hardness of Rhea&#39;s nipple piercings against Ty&#39; own upper boob, the embrace held nothing of sexual tension.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; mumbled Ty.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said Rhea, petting her head. &quot;Do not be sorry for your tears or your doubts. You&#39;ve no need to hide how you feel, here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t I? L- Mistress Luma...&quot;<br />
<br />
Rhea laughed softly. &quot;Mistress Luma knows that the best way for a slave to accept their part is for them to work out their misgivings, not bottle them up. So long as you render her the obedience and reverence she is due, she will not mind what you think or what you say outside her presence.&quot;<br />
<br />
A few minutes passed. Ty shivered as the wind curled its fingers around her tail, cooling the hot fluids that still dripped from her heat-swollen nethers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t we go back inside?&quot; Rhea suggested. &quot;And talk?&quot;</p>
