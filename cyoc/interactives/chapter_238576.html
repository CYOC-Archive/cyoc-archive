<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Circe passed the next few days sorting out her ingredients and reading new parchments with magical recipes. She stocked up on popular potions that many paid her well for. Circe was not only crafty in witchcraft, she also knew a thing or two about selling. At times, she thought about Damon, crunching on corn, acorns and the occasional apple. He seemed to get used to his new life. But Circe would ask him in a few days how he felt and if he appeared remorseful at having offended one such as her, well, she&#39;d transform him into something else. The boy did not sound like a true meanie or a bully, truth be told. Deciding what to transform him into would be fun, though.<br />
Just then, a tiny sparrow flitted inside her wide room, perching itself upon her table. It chirped animatedly, announcing the coming of a young woman within her domain and heading straight towards the castle. Circe thanked him and prepared herself to welcome this newcomer. She wondered what this female looked like.<br />
<br />
It turned out she was rather boring. She was pretty, for sure, but not that much and extremely bland in character. She obviously had a high esteem of herself, and clearly took pride in the fact that she had money. Or rather, that her father had money. She asked her way back to her home but couldn&#39;t be bothered to look up from her cursed phone as Circe talked to her and informed her. Chewing one of these horrid gums, she sighed and said she&#39;d order a taxi out of here, but then started vaping and asking why there was no network here. Circe told her there was none, and asked her to stop with the smoke. The girl sunk into impoliteness, telling she had the right to do so and that with no internet she was bored. Circe patiently said that she&#39;d give her directions and that if she waited, the girl could find ways to occupy herself, like walking, weaving, cooking or just admiring all of the animals. The girl snapped that she did not want to do these boring things and she wanted to use her phone. Circe insisted but the more the girl went without her device, the more aggressive she became. Hearing bad things about her realm, Circe had enough. This girl of sixteen years was going to get a good lesson! Circe told her that she&#39;d grant her a wish, as a compensation for not having any computers or phones around. The girl looked at her clearly thinking that she did not believe a word of it but spoke nevertheless.<br />
&quot;Fine. I wish to be so beautiful as to be a model,&quot; she said.<br />
&quot;A model?&quot; Circe asked.<br />
&quot;Yeah. I want the body of a model. A swimsuit model,&quot; the girl said.<br />
&quot;I see. Well, enjoy!&quot; Circe smiled.<br />
With her wand, she hit lightly the girl on the head, who screeched in outrage as if she&#39;d been brutally whacked. But it was too late. In a puff of smoke, she vanished to reappear into Circe&#39;s gardens, in the lake and rivers&#39; region.<br />
<br />
Stacy rubbed her head, furious at her situation. This old bitch pretending to be magic was going to get sued as soon as she reached home and talked to her dad! She noticed right after that she was feeling more of the air and wind upon her skin. She glanced down and saw immediately that her clothes were gone! Well... Not all her clothes. She saw that she was in a small two-piece bathing suit. And what was more, her body had changed. She had pestered uselessly since she was 12 for her parents to pay for plastic surgery. She wanted a bigger butt and a full rack, as well as lip injections, so as to emulate the stars she immensely loved on social media. Stacy was vapid for sure. Yet as she looked at her body, she saw that she must have aged a few years but she had a gorgeous slim-thick body. The perfect one - in her mind. Her boobs were enormous, her waist nice and cinched and her butt all bouncy. She touched her lips and yes, they were much, much bigger than before! She rushed to the surface of the nearest water and looked at her reflection. Wow, she was hot! Her hair was fuller and shorter but so, so much more stylish! That crazy bitch was right! She DID have a model&#39;s body! She knew she would be selected for Sports Illustrated no questions asked now! She just had to reach her home now again, but first she could gaze at herself for a while.<br />
<br />
Stacy stroke poses endlessly, as she looked at her body and imagined all the money she could earn as a model. She was clearly above 18 now, if only by a few years, so she could! Lost in her daydreaming of future wealth and admiration, she did not notice a creature emerging from the lush trees and greenery. It was a gillman, approaching stealthily in the direction of the priceless beauty that Circe had told him would be there. The sorceress had told her the truth indeed. She had told him that she was his for the taking. This gillman had never liked nymphs or other members of the fair sex. Only human women in swimwear made him feel an erection and want to pump his seed to make eggs into a female. And this one... This one was perfect! Utterly enchanting! She had curves, delightful curves which many nymphs lacked. Those butt cheeks! And those tiddies... Those tiddies! He couldn&#39;t wait to squeeze and kiss them! Circe had explained to him that she&#39;d be a bit frightened at first but with proper courting, and a beautiful baby in the belly, she&#39;d learn to love him like the most faithful mate. Perfect! The gillman&#39;s lair would keep her secluded and safe. So when she screamed at his sight, he simply grabbed her and dived into the water, more than ready to start his new life with his beautiful bride and mate. Stacy, of course, was a lot less enthusiastic and if she had known what the gillman had in mind for her, she would have screamed even louder.</p>
