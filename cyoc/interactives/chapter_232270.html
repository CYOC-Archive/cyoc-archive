<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric was beyond astounded. His husband had turned into a child. His child had turned into an overweight adult man. They now sat at the breakfast table in each other&#39;s clothes. Adrian was wearing his son&#39;s Avengers T-shirt and hoodie while Mitch was dressed in a T=shirt and large beach shorts. They couldn&#39;t find any pants that would fit Mitch&#39;s bulk. Adrian had been so fit that all his clothes were for a much trimmer man. Mitch was having fun slapping his belly and playing with it and making it jiggle until his dad Eric made him stop. <br />
<br />
Mitch had experienced a large erection in the shower but he didn&#39;t know anything about how to handle it. His dads had told him that they would explain everything about how grown up men&#39;s bodies worked after they got together for breakfast. Luckily, it was a Saturday and Dad Eric didn&#39;t have work today. Adrian wanted to scream. His legs didn&#39;t even reach the floor! His son was now a disgusting fatass middle aged adult with thick blond stubble, and his feet could touch the floor just fine! Mitch had always been jealous of men who were taller than him, being of average height. His bodybuilding was, at heart, always a way to make up for being merely average in height. He had been so much stronger than his husband Eric, who now TOWERED above him! It was so disorientating to have to LOOK UP at the adult men in the room. Even at the breakfast table, their heads stood above his. It wasn&#39;t fair! <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God, I just thought of something,&quot; the eight year old boy said. He was a good looking boy. He looked the same as he did in third grade. His soft brown hair and adorable looks made him unusually popular all throughout school. His good looks could have landed him acting gigs but his parents had refused to allow him to become a child actor. <br />
<br />
Adrian and Eric had always been such a handsome couple. They were both Alpha males and the hardest thing about their relationship was that they both wanted to dominate their environments. For Adrian, that was always predominantly a physical aspect. He had dominated many men with his powerful muscles and had always coasted on his looks. He was a powerhouse in the bedroom, and could often outlast men twenty years younger than himself. Eric, on the other hand, was handsome but of average build. He had actually started bodybuilding because of Adrian hounding him to. Eric was a businessman. He was 6&#39;3&quot; and had black hair that he kept short. He had the look of a man from a well to do East Coast family because that&#39;s what he was. Adrian had come from much more humble origins. Adrian had worked his way up through the ranks of muscular men at the gym to become a respected member of the bodybuilding community and was a personal trainer to dozens of men desperate to look just like him. Eric was the man men at work wanted to be. He was the head manager of an important digital cloud creator platform, and he was the obvious breadwinner in the family. He had paid for the house, the furniture, the vacations to Europe and tropical islands. <br />
<br />
In the bedroom, Eric and Adrian had gone back and forth on who was &quot;in charge&quot;. At the beginning of their relationship, Adrian had been very much in control. Eric had been a skinny twig when they met, only 150 lbs at 6&#39;3&quot;. He had a great smile, and sexy stubble, and he looked like someone&#39;s dad from Mad Men. Eric had a strong chin and big ears. He had grown into his looks, which had been awkward in his teenage years. Now, he was very picture of fatherhood, and he usually dressed conservatively in suits. He was used to being in charge, but then he had met Adrian, and Adrian was a muscular god, perfect in every way except for the fact that he was of average height. Still, Adrian had proven himself more adept in the bedroom...at first. When they adopted Mitch, they mutually decided that Adrian would spend more time with Mitch at home since his schedule was more malleable. He had become &quot;the mom&quot; of the relationship, though he would get very defensive if anyone used that term for him, which he considered derogatory. He had spent the majority of the last few years devoted to raising Mitch while he took on less clients while still maintaining his incredible physique. Eric, on the other hand, was zooming right up to build his body into a 190 lb. frame. And he had the potential for much more with his height. At the age of 35, Eric was already a multi millionaire and he could easily have any man he wanted. <br />
<br />
He had become more aggressive as their marriage and roles changed around their new status as parents. He had become a lot more fit, packing on muscle. Though not as buff as his husband, he had definitely seen a huge uptick in his sexual libido, which now matched that of his partner. He had started to demand that he top more. He had never been a full bottom, and he had bottomed for the most part of the first few years of their marriage until Adrian had relented to allow Eric the dominant role he so craved. He had also sworn Eric to secrecy. He was ashamed of the fact that they now took turns. It hurt his ego as a bodybuilder who had spent countless hours trying to memorize videos on how to be the &quot;ultimate Alpha male&quot; not really understanding at first that it was something that came naturally for Eric. Eric had to explain it to his husband, that he didn&#39;t need advice on how to be a natural leader. He was fully in command at work and he fired people regularly for not making the cut. <br />
<br />
And now, here they were. Adrian was looking up at his son and husband. Both he and Eric were distracted by their new enormous son as he wolfed down a huge amount of food. <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit,&quot; the 8 year old boy Adrian remarked. &quot;I just remembered something! That little nerd! He said...he said he was gonna get even with me!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Who said that?&quot; Eric asked urgently. &quot;What do you remember?&quot; <br />
<br />
Mitch shoved eggs down his throat and gurgled some milk. &quot;Can I have some more, please?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on a sec, sweetheart. The adults are talking. Um. Well. Um. You know what I mean,&quot; Eric said, a bit flustered, which was unusual for his personality. <br />
<br />
&quot;It...it was a few weeks ago. I was at work, and I was trying to help this guy because he was trying to put too much weight on his rack. I told him he had to slow it down and just lift some tens. I knew that&#39;s what he was capable of. He was a new client. I&#39;d only been with him a month or so. He had kind of a bad attitude. He kept telling me he needed to get what he was paying for, get his money&#39;s worth. Real thin guy. Glasses. Total nerd. Little brown dude. I thought he was Mexican or Indian. I mean...he was literally only 110 pounds soaking wet, only 5&#39;1&quot;. He had some growth development disorder or something. I asked if he was from India, but said he was from some country I&#39;d never heard of in Asia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that narrows things down,&quot; Eric said sarcastically. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, please go on.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, this little brown dude. I can&#39;t remember his name. It was like Jakil or something, he and I got into an altercation. He was really belligerent. Started insulting the staff. He was just very unpleasant. Had a screw loose, you know? We all thought he was crazy. We asked him to leave, and I told him I was ending our session and I&#39;d refund his money. Told him to find another gym. He went ballistic, but like, you know...we asked him to leave....&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What happened, Daddy?&quot; the huge blond 38 year old man with receding blond hair asked, wide-eyed. It was almost impossible for Adrian to process that this was his little boy all grown up! <br />
<br />
&quot;Wipe your chin, sweetheart. You have food on your face,&quot; Adrian admonished, in his 8 year old boy voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your father&#39;s right, mind your table manners,&quot; Eric noted. It was not a good situation, he thought, that this grown man had the manners of a small child. What was going to happen to them like this?? &quot;What happened then, Adrian?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We...sort of picked him up and escorted him outside. I mean, he wouldn&#39;t leave! He was pretty humiliated by that and started screaming at us, me and the other guy who picked him up, you know Bob. Anyway, we kind of laughed about it and he started screaming about how guys had bullied him in high school. Stuff I had nothing to do with and...then he said some weird language I&#39;d never heard before. And I was like, dude, I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re saying but we&#39;re gonna call the cops if you don&#39;t leave the premises. He just smiles and says, you&#39;re gonna find out what it&#39;s like to be me, cuz I just put a curse on you. Only he had like an accent.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to do the accent, I get the gist of it. Okay, so you think...this...Jakil put an actual curse on you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a fucking eight year old!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Language!&quot; Eric shouted very strongly. His voice was powerful and shook Adrian right away. He felt tendrils of fear curling in his back and he stood up straight. &quot;I&#39;m...sorry. I uh...you&#39;re a child and I just...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Can I say naughty words now because I&#39;m a grown up!?&quot; Mitch asked. &quot;Can I have some more sausage, please?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And why is he fat? If we switched ages, shouldn&#39;t he be like me, with muscles? I mean, he&#39;s a total lardass now.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mitch started crying at Adrian&#39;s question. He dropped his fork and ran away from the table. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now look what you&#39;ve done!&quot; Eric admonished. He threw down his napkin and went after his now enormous son. Mitch was curled up on his bed, but of course, he couldn&#39;t really fit on his bed anymore. He was at least 6 feet tall, between Eric&#39;s height and Adrian&#39;s former height. Mitch was crying hard. Both Eric and Adrian calmed him down and told him it would all be okay. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have any idea how to contact this man? Is he in your system?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but I have to go into work in order to get it off the computer. I can&#39;t go in like this! No one will recognize me!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, look, we will figure that out. For now, the first thing we need to do is get him some clothes for our son that fit. None of our clothes will fit him because of his size. You watch him and I&#39;m going to be back shortly. Mitch, can you watch TV with Daddy until I get back?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Sir.&quot; the blond man who could be a dad himself replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn&#39;t we explain...you know...adult things to him first?&quot; Adrian asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you do that while I get him some clothes to wear? Let me get my tape measure...&quot; Eric measured his son and wrote down his measurements. &quot;A 42 inch waist. Well, I&#39;ve seen worse. Alright. You two sit tight. And then, on my way back, I&#39;ll stop at the gym and tell them you&#39;re sick and I need to pick up a few things in the office that you need. What would you need?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you access your work&#39;s system from home?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, we never did that. We couldn&#39;t work from home during covid so we never even tried to change the system.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Right. I should have offered to redesign your work system years ago. It&#39;s so early 2000s it&#39;s ridiculous.&quot;<br />
<br />
Soon, Mitch and Adrian were alone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can we watch cartoons now, Daddy?&quot; the grown man asked the little boy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, sweetheart,&quot; the little boy replied. They started to watch Spongebob and the grown man laughed way too hard the jokes. Adrian sighed. They had to find that little brown nerd so he could fix this!</p>
