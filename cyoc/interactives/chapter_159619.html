<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Elspeth brought the class back to order and announced, &quot;I know we were having fun focusing on animal or inanimate transformations but over the break, I realized. A live test subject opens up a world of opportunities. Considering that it is my job to prepare you for the real magical world, I see an even greater opportunity.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elspeth turned to James making some gestures and moving her hands in pointed gestures. James felt something build up within him, and then things began feeling uncomfortable. Elspeth materialized a piece of chalk and began by making two circles at opposite ends at the front of the room and drawing inside them. Meanwhile, James could feel he was changing, His organs felt compressed, his skin felt tight and all eyes in the room were on him, save for Elspeth&#39;s.<br />
<br />
There were a few intrigued ooo&#39;s, some flashes of insight OH!&#39;s, and even some disappointed Aw&#39;s as James felt the changes conclude. He was left panting and found himself kneeling against the desk he was previously sitting on. He stood up and half the girls looked on appraisingly others were chatting and the rest were wildly sifting through their textbooks, trying to find the spell no doubt. James looked at himself and right away he noticed his body had less hair. even the briefest glimpse at his appendages, he could tell he had lost muscle, and looking around he noticed he was a little bit shorter. Some of the girls looked less comfortable with him now and James reasoned he had been youthened to their age for some reason Elspeth had not yet explained, and it was less okay to see someone who could be their boyfriend, standing naked and ashamed before their class.<br />
<br />
Elspeth finished what she was doing and went to the board, she began drawing symbols and the class fell silent in anticipation of the explanation. &quot;You are all familiar with these, you&#39;ve seen variations of them in your books, in movies, on the covers of your romance novels&quot; she underscored one of them as she said this, getting a few giggles. &quot;These are part of what? Class?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Runic castings&quot; the class droned in unison.. &quot;Very good.&quot; Elspeth replied. &quot;James, Please stand in the circle.&quot; She pointed to the one on the right side of the room.<br />
<br />
James moved into the circle and turned apprehensively. Elspeth had already begun chanting, A flash erupted from the chalk marks and symbols made of light appeared on James young body. The floor quickly faded and the marks on James followed a second or two later. Elspeth turned to the opposite circle and began chanting something different but a moment later a similar flash appeared as the symbols glowed. <br />
<br />
Espeth turned to the class, &quot;In real life situations you may need to think fast, and respond to protect yourself and say... a dear friend who&#39;s been possessed. Your goal is to do just that... WITHOUT KILLING HIM OR BANISHING HIM... You need only protect yourself for 30 seconds and then the &#39;possession&#39; will end. If he reaches your circle you fail.&quot; Elspeth sternly looked at a few select students. &quot;I will demonstrate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elspeth stepped into the circle, which again glowed in response. James was immediately filled with a white hot rage, he burst forth intending to wring Elspeth&#39;s frail little neck, she needed to die! She pointed a finger at James and uttered a few words and he immediately collapsed to the floor, fast asleep.<br />
<br />
Elspeth remained in the circle until the glowing stopped and instructed the class to do the same. She then released the spell and James awoke confused and a little bruised from his fall. &quot;Return to your circle James.&quot; was all he got.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who wants to try it?&quot; she asked <br />
<br />
Hesitantly a hand arose... &quot;Ill give it a try Mrs. Elspeth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good Amanda, come, come!&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda stepped in and again James couldn&#39;t contain his blood lust and fury. Amanda said a few words and gestured with her hands and James stopped dead in his tracks half way between the circles. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, what was that? A paralysis spell? Very nice Amanda.&quot; <br />
<br />
Amanda with a giddy smile looked back at her teacher, &quot;Not quite...Mrs. Elspeth&quot; She slowly moved her hands and James&#39; body was pulled with each motion she made. After just a few seconds she got a grasp on the mechanics and made James dance before the class.. all while he was incensed with rage and spewing profanities.<br />
<br />
The class burst out laughing and Elspeth was overjoyed by Amanda&#39;s performance, &quot;A puppeteering spell, Marvelous work Amanda, you have outdone yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
The circle faded and James returned to his senses doing an awkward Can-Can dance before the class.<br />
<br />
The process repeated many times over, James was paralyzed by another student, turned into a rabbit by a student who was prepared for the earlier lesson, his feet became vines,  he was struck blind, He was enfeebled, he was toddler-ed,  and many more things spells successfully stopped him.<br />
<br />
One student froze and as soon as he reached the circle it teleported him back to his own circle and the hold on him ended. One student tried to switch his rage for another emotion... it worked but he reached the circle attempting rape instead of murder. Some spells were fumbled and others he distracted the witch as he felt the spells energy building. Elspeth used these as teaching moments explaining that a possessed friend may still know their magic and cast back...<br />
<br />
One success turned the floor to quicksand and he fell through the floor. Faint screams were heard from below as a naked male teen melted through the ceiling in the middle of their class. <br />
<br />
The students who failed got to try repeatedly until they got it right, by the time every one had successfully warded him off, Jeff was completely coated in sweat and panting. He didnt know what was going on because he either came back to, on the floor, or in his circle.</p>
