<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Terrence Westworth sat on the padded couch, his legs spread slightly, his eyes hungrily drinking in Carlos. It was such a strange sight to him the Carlos even missed a step coming into the room. There was his brother, looking at him in a way he had never seen before. Terrance was ten years older than Charlie had been and was his idol. Everything Charlie had been he molded after his brother. His blond hair was fashioned in a neat crew cut, he wore his suit with the jacket off and tossed to the side. He was slim, and the shirt and slacks he wore were tailored for him, fitting him perfectly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Touching a target lets you know their sins.&quot; Astarael&#39;s voice echoed in his head, &quot;Though I think you might know his.&quot;<br />
<br />
He was much the same as Charlie had been, though he worked for a politician since graduating, trying to get into politics himself. He was all anti-immigration, and anti-welfare, traditional marriage, and family values. Yet here he was paying to have a Latino strip for him, and not just strip from the way he way licking his lips. &quot;Come here.&quot; He said, motioning Carlos closer.<br />
<br />
Carlos&#39; body once more seemed to know just what to do, practically swaying as he made his way closer, until Terry could put his hands on his hips, Carlos put his hands over Terry&#39;s and like his demon master said, he knew. Hypocrisy was Terrance&#39;s sin of choice. He was gay but fought against gay rights, had a thing for non-white guys and considered most of them welfare drains. He didn&#39;t give a shit for the community, and only pretended to work for them. Carlos saw his former brother in a whole new light.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh... see? Worthy of punishment.&quot; Astarael purred in his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not take him thrall?&quot; Carlos thought back as he swayed in Terrance&#39;s grip, turning so those hands could caress his rear through the thin fabric of his shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were worse, he can be redirected. The punishment can be great, or small. A complete change of their lives, or a tweak to their circumstance that changes their course. You could make it just so he wasn&#39;t able to hide the fact he was gay - make him out and proud, or you could make him a whole new person like you became. It&#39;s all about instinct. Feel the right answer.&quot; The demon&#39;s words soaked into him, but all he could feel was Terrance slowly pulling down his shorts and pressing his lips against one of his ass cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s my brother! I can&#39;t!&quot; Charlie&#39;s thoughts welled up, overwhelming him for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;DO IT!&quot; He winced at the sound reverberating in his skull.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; Carlos thought meekly as his shorts pooled around his ankles, he bent over to loosen the laces on his boots and step out of both those and his shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything alright?&quot; Terrance asked as he pressed a kiss against Carlos&#39; other ass cheek, not having heard the conversation between Carlos and his master.<br />
<br />
&quot;First night jitters.&quot; Carlos responded as he turned around, his already rigid cock on display for his former brother. He reached forward and loosened the crimson tie, slowly sliding it off of Terrance and tossing it aside.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s why I hadn&#39;t seen you before. The moment I walked in and saw you, I knew I needed you.&quot; Terrance ran his hands up Carlos&#39; stomach and over his furred pecs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll try to make it worth every penny.&quot; Carlos whispered as he kneeled in front of Terrance, pushing up between his legs, he slowly began to undo the buttons of his dress shirt, popping them one by one. He pushed the shirt wide open, exposing Terrance&#39;s pale chest a torso, just the lightest wisps of dark blond hair running down the middle of his stomach. Feling something surge from deep within him Carlos sucked on first one nipple, then the other before standing up to reposition himself straddling Terrance&#39;s lap, the couches were extra deep and extra padded, made for lap dances, or riding cock.<br />
<br />
Terrance&#39;s nipples were darkening after Carlos&#39; quick tease. Soon matching his own before deepening to an even darker shade. He leaned in and pressed his lips against his former brother&#39;s lips, feeling them plump up as they pressed together. Terrance pulled his arms free of his shirt and wrapped one around Carlos&#39; waist, another gripping he back of his neck as they kissed. Carlos worked at Terrance&#39;s trouser fly, soon working it open and breaking the kiss.<br />
<br />
Carlos pulled back after a moment to admire those full, dark lips. His nose was starting to broaden, his nostrils flaring from arousal and the transformation he was undergoing. As Carlos slid of his lap he took those trousers with him, pulling them down to Terrance&#39;s ankles before casting them aside along with his dress shoes. Socks came off next as Carlos brought first one foot up and then the other, teasingly sucking on each big toe, and like every touch of his mouth before, leaving the skin darkening and spreading. Terrance&#39;s whole chest was pretty much dark brown, his two nipples nearly black points, it had spread from his lips over his jaw and chin which was becoming heavier and more masculine, and up his cheeks. Already his feet were growing larger as his other toes began to follow the first in change. Terrance seemed oblivious for the moment, breathing heavily as Carlos took Terrance&#39;s cock in hand.<br />
<br />
Charlie hadn&#39;t been the only gifted on in the family, Terrance, too sported a large 8&quot; cock almost identical to what his brother&#39;s had been. At least until Carlos put his mouth over the pink head, turning it a deep brown-red almost instantly. Carlos, never having given a blow job before, expected to gag on the monster, but instead he managed to take most of it, his nose burying in Terrance&#39;s dark blond pubes. He bobbed, on the cock, once, twice, three times, each time more and more of the cock came out of his mouth a darker shade than it had gone in. By the fourth time he took that cock in his mouth his nose met with pubes that were black and tightly curled, scrotum almost black. He pulled the cock free of his mouth to look up at Terrance who had his head back and his eyes closed. Under the dark skin on his chest, his pectorals had begun to swell, his shoulders and arms also growing thick, heavy muscle as the skin darkened. The final bit of white on his neck vanished as the expanding pools of change from his nipples and lips met, the hair on his head was rapidly darkening and twisting into a tight curl before retracting into his head leaving a cleanly shaven pate and only the dark shadow of stubble to show his hair line.<br />
<br />
Terrance opened his eyes and looked down at Carlos, then his eyes widened even further, noticing the changes for the first time. &quot;What... What&#39;s happening?!&quot; His voice was frantic. He was looking down at his cock which had actually grown a bit bigger to 9&quot;, and quite a bit girthier a pair of heavy bull-like balls beneath it. It went with his feet which were almost three sizes bigger by now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhh...&quot; Carlos cooed as he climbed back up onto the couch, straddling his ex-brother&#39;s lap. &quot;You can&#39;t tell me it doesn&#39;t feel good. It feels right, doesn&#39;t it? Don&#39;t fight it.&quot; Strangely, Terrance relaxed at Carlos&#39; words, slowly nodding his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;It feels.. amazing.&quot; His voice was deepening to a smoky baritone. Carlos met him with another kiss, feeling scratchiness as a short, trimmed beard grew on Terrance&#39;s face. He reached beneath him and guided that new cock towards his ass, and slowly lowered himself onto it. Like the blowjob, he managed to take it without struggle. It felt good to have that monster cock in him, a sweet pain mixed with intense pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to pretend anymore.&quot; Carlos whispered into Terrance&#39;s ear as he rode his cock. &quot;You can be a whole different person, now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taught abs formed on Terrance&#39;s stomach, quickly replaced by a small but beefy muscle gut. Thickening hands gripped Carlos&#39; waist, strong fingers digging into his flesh as he rode up and down in a steady rhythm. Curly hair grew in along Terrance&#39;s chest and over his stomach, less than what Carlos himself sported, but still a nice dusting across those meaty pecs. The two former brother&#39;s reached climax together, Terrance filling Carlos as Carlos let his load loose across Terrance&#39;s stomach and chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finish your task. Ask him who he is.&quot; Came the demon&#39;s command in Carlos&#39; head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you.&quot; Carlos whispered into Terrance&#39;s ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Terrance Westworth. No...&quot; Terrance shook his head. &quot;Terrance Smith, I&#39;m a beat cop, I&#39;m gay.. and anyone who has a problem with that, well, I&#39;ll just kick their ass.&quot; Carlos smiled and climbed off of Terrance, getting a good look at his handiwork, a 6&#39;3&quot; dark skinned man, flush with muscle and maybe a bit of  gut from a few too many beers or fast food meals, his heavy cock swayed between his thighs as he stood up and grabbed a towel to clean himself off.<br />
<br />
The both got dressed, though for Carlos that only meant putting his shorts and boots back on. Terrance&#39;s clothing had changed from a suit to a pair of blue jeans and a blue button up shirt, his suit jacket that had been tossed aside was now a leather jacket he pulled on. Terrance pulled out his wallet and flipped it open, the glint of a police badge catching Carlos&#39; eye, until that fifty dollar bill came out. &quot;You earned it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carlos reached for it but Terrance pulled it back and scooped Carlos in close for another kiss before finally handing over the tip. &quot;I&#39;ll definitely be back for another piece of your ass.&quot; Terrance walked out of the room with the confident stride of a man comfortable in his own body.<br />
<br />
After a moment Boss opened the door and stepped inside. &quot;I saw that piece of work leaving. Holy hell, boy, you got some talent for this. Take a few minutes to rest up and then get back out on the floor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carlos stared at the fifty in his hand like he had never seen one before. &quot;Yeah, sure thing, boss.&quot;</p>
