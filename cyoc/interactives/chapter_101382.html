<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rod Maynard was a 45 year old bank-clerk who regularily went to the park to walk his Bobtail Twipsy and to have a smoke. The Bobtail was a girl and he did not come up with that ridiculous name, but his wife had. She too was the one who attached that stupid pink ribbon on that dog, bouncing up and down on it&#39;s head when it was running and jumping. Rod wasn&#39;t his actual name, his parents had decided to call him &quot;Roderick&quot;, but he preferred &quot;Rod&quot;. &quot;Roderick&quot; made him feel as if his parents did not love him, because how else could you come up with a ridiculous name like that? He knew it wasn&#39;t true, he knew it was just because they had been considerably old already when he was born and they were old-fashioned and for some wicket reason thought of &quot;Roderick&quot; as being a strong name. He, however, never even mentioned his name &quot;Roderick&quot; to anyone but always introduced himself as &quot;Rod&quot;. When he was leaving the country, however, his name, that was fully written on his passport and ID-Card, caused the border-patrole always joy. <br />
Here, at the park noone knew his embarassing name. They only knew him as &quot;Rod&quot;. To the others he was just another guy who suffered under a dominant wife who made him walk a pet-dog. Rod had just lighted up another cigarette when that young guy entered the area with his dog, took off the leash and went to join the group of dog-owners who were already there. <br />
&quot;Hi there!&quot; The young one said. &quot;Mind if I join?&quot; <br />
&quot;Not a problem! Im Rod!&quot; Rod said. &quot;This is Stacy, Armin and I always forget his name ...&quot; <br />
&quot;Rick! Its Rick! Damn it, how often do you forget!?&quot; a short middle-aged man with a considerable portion of belly fat replied. <br />
&quot;Oh, right, ... Im just teasing you, ya know that!&quot; Rod was laughing now. Turning towards the young man he said &quot;And you are ...?&quot; <br />
&quot;Ty, the name is Ty!&quot; <br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen you around here before.&quot; <br />
&quot;Im walking my cousin&#39;s dog, so I don&#39;t usually come here&quot; Ty replied whilst watching Mei sniffing around, the other dogs already at her behind sniffing. <br />
&quot;By the way, what kind of a dog is it?&quot; Rod asked. &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen one like that before.&quot; <br />
&quot;Oh, Mei is a Chinese Shiatsu, apparently quite rare.&quot; Ty had just made that name up, hoping noone would notice. <br />
&quot;Mei, come here girl, come to me!&quot; Ty was shouting. <br />
Mei left her new buddies and ran back to Ty, happily rubbing her face at his leg. &quot;Thats a good girl!&quot; Ty said, scratching her behind the ear. &quot;Thats a good girl.&quot; <br />
&quot;My cousin has brought her over from China one or two years ago and asked me to take care of her while she is on holiday, so here I am, walking the dog.&quot; <br />
&quot;She is quite a cutiepie I must say&quot; Rod said. He had never seen that type of a dog. For some reason he could not take his eyes off of her, she was just too adorable. While the others joined in and each of them made a remark about Mei and from there telling the tales of their own dogs, where they had them from, how long they had them and all that stuff dog-owners love to talk about: basically dogs, Mei stood up, sniffing between their feet, moving from one to the other. She ended up with Rod who bowed down and fondled her enthusiastically and she really seemed to enjoy it. Mei then laid down on the floor, turned on her back and showed Rod her front side, happily yelping as he started to scratch and fondle her chest. <br />
Ty watched them from the corner of his eyes and amused himself. He was the only one who was aware of Rod actually fondling a naked girl and one with a massive cock that was rock hard from him fondling her to add to that. The view was hillarious. He too could see how Rod had really gotten into it, he was fondling Mei more enthusiastically and dedicated than anyone would fondle a dog. <br />
Rod at that time did not understand what was going on. There was this dog he had never seen. All right already, but he could not stop fondling her and to make matters worse he felt how he got a hard on. How was that even possible? He wasn&#39;t into bestiality at all and there he was, getting an erection from touching a dog. Just what was wrong with him? He turned his head and realized that Ty was watching him. &quot;She seems to have taken a liking in you!&quot; Ty remarked. &quot;Oh, well, I guess I just know how to treat dogs well.&quot; Rod replied confused. &quot;Do you mind if I play with her for a bit?&quot; he asked. &quot;Oh, of course not! Do as you please.&quot; With that Ty turned around and joined back into the conversation of the others. Rod picked up an old tennis-ball he had originally carried with him to play with his Bobtail, stood up and called Mei. He showed her the ball, moved it around &quot;Get the ball, honey, get the ball!&quot; and then he threw it to the end of the fenced run area. Mei got up and hunted down the ball excitedly, whilst Rod followed her with an easy trot.</p>
