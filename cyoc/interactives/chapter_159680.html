<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Richard just started to walk through the forest rather aimlessly. There were a number of times where he could swear that he went around in circles. His fear was confirmed when he across the same lake he was dumped into by the helicopter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it!&quot; Richard shouted as he punched the ground scaring a number of birds from the trees. In that moment, Richard realized he truly had no idea how to survive in the wild. And was pissed off that Garok was in his original body, doing who knows what. While he didn&#39;t know if he would get back to civilization, he should at least try to get back to the camp. He got back up, picked a direction and started walking.<br />
<br />
After walking about an hour, Richard had heard something rustle not too far away from him. He walked over to see what it was hoping it was another person only to find out it was herd of african buffalo. Before Richard had a chance to react, one of them charged at him, hitting straight in the stomach, knocking him out cold. Once Richard awoke, the first thing he felt was that his stomach was in a lot of pain. He then noticed that he was in a big hut. In fact it was so big, it could easily fit ten more of a man of his current size. As he stood up from the ground, two men came through the door. Both of them were the same height as him. Although with the first was a spitting image of him except for a darker hair color and was wearing a loincloth made of leaves, which Richard was a bit jealous of a bit for that. The other was naked, had much shorter hair and looked like he was about 7 month pregnant.<br />
<br />
&quot;You..well?&quot; the first one asked<br />
<br />
Richard simply nodded <br />
<br />
&quot;You new in village.&quot; the second one said rubbing his stomach<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Are you ok? Richard asked the second one<br />
<br />
&quot;Tran with child.&quot; he answered<br />
<br />
&quot;How is that possible?!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When boy be man after 20 years, they choose. Either be hunter or be birther.&quot; the first one answered &quot;Tran Astras mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard couldn&#39;t believe what he heard. The idea of a man giving birth was just so bizarre.<br />
<br />
&quot;How would one go about bearing a child?&quot; Richard asked<br />
<br />
&quot;After 20 year, Tran left home. Visit sacred plant. Tran let plant have way. After two day, Tran in front of sacred planet again with mark.&quot; Tran then showed Richard a mark in the shape of a flower with four petals on his left palm. &quot;One petal is one child. No petals, no more childs.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Can you visit this sacred plant again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Astras older brother tried once. Almost kill him.&quot; Astras responded &quot;No one go to sacred plant twice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you find me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Astras find on hunt. Astras bring new man home.&quot; Astras answered &quot;What name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Richard&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to village Richard!&quot; They both said as Tran opened the door of the hut. Richard looked around and saw several big huts and as he suspected from what he was told a few moments ago, there was not a single woman in the village. Another thing he noticed, was that only the men who were pregnant were naked and then figured that those who were hunters were wearing loincloths. He also saw that the kids were also naked. Some of them were wrestling with each other and others were resting in trees. He also saw a good number of naked teenagers, who certainly had more muscle and hair on their bodies than he did at their ages. A few of them were wrestling, a bit rougher than the kids, however a majority of them were having sex with each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it ok for them to have sex with each other like that?&quot; Richard asked almost appalled that they were having sex for everyone to see.<br />
<br />
&quot;They no allow to visit sacred flower. When feel good snake first rise, they need use.&quot; Astras said &quot;Hurt bad if they no use.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t they use it on their own?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They can.&quot; Tran answered &quot;Just more fun to do with others. Why problem to Richard?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In my village, we do it privately.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; they both asked <br />
<br />
Richard wanted to answer, but it occurred to him that aside from society, he didn&#39;t have a reason. He realized that this village without inhibitions or pride or anything else from his upbringing, this place may just be easier. With that, Richard felt his mind get a little foggy which made his intelligence go down a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Richard no know.&quot; Richard said &quot;Richard village no around here. Richard stay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Richard may stay, but Richard must be hunter or birther.&quot; Astras said &quot;If hunter, Richard must hunt for family to feed family and choose mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If birther, Richard must build home for family and care for childs after birth until 20.&quot; Tran added<br />
<br />
&quot;Will hunter show Richard?&quot; Richard asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Richard will join other hunter, but Richard must take final kill.&quot; Astras answered<br />
<br />
Richard had to think about this one.</p>
