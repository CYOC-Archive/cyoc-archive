<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I couldn&#39;t help it. People staring was always a pet peeve of mine and always served to unnerve me. It wasn&#39;t because I was self conscious, it was more of irritation that someone would be staring in the first place. If you need something, just ask, don&#39;t stare. I tried ignoring it, but I couldn&#39;t help it. Finally I relented, turning to look at the girl who was still staring at me. She was in the row behind me but maybe six seats to my right. She was Asian, and cute, a sharp jawline and small face. Her eyes were so dark they almost looked black from a distance and her straight black hair fell long and over one shoulder. Her lips were narrow, she had a button nose, and her smile was the cutest I had seen. She wasn&#39;t much for figure, slender and looking to be a bit on the short side her breasts were at best a small C cup and her hips were virtually non-existant, though I couldn&#39;t really gage from my angle as she had crossed one leg over the other. She held her chin up via her arm that rested on her desk, giving her a gentile look accustomed to that of a dainty princess. I stared back at her, locking eyes this time. She smiled and waived with her free hand.<br />
<br />
Still uncertain whether she was waiving to me, I pointed at myself and raised my eyebrows in the universal sign that meant &#39;me?&#39; She simply offered a slight nod as a giggle escaped her. I waived back, eliciting yet another giggle from her. &quot;Hey there, handsome!&quot; I jumped, the voice startling me as I turned to see another girl had relocated to the seat right at my left foot. She was White, a blonde with sparkling blue eyes and curles for days. I let out a stunned sigh, sparing a glance back at the Asian who seemed to have found the sudden interruption annoying as her once beautiful smiled had just turned to a frown. &quot;Hm... she&#39;s cute I guess, but I&#39;m sure you could do better,&quot; the blonde continued, eliciting my attention back to her. &quot;I&#39;m Aubrey,&quot; she started again, flashing me a perfectly straight smile and offering a hand. I shook it, noticing the diamond bracelet on her wrist and assortment of silver rings. Already red flags were going off as I realized that she likely had several... benefactors to provide such luxery. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jethro,&quot; I replied, the other obviously stifling a laugh. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, well, Jethro, tell me, where are you from?&quot; she asked, pressing herself against the back of her newly acquired desk in a bid to excentuate her cleavage.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m actually local-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too!&quot; another feminine voice gasped in glee. I turned back past my left shoulder to see another had claimed the seat almost directly behind me. She was a Latina girl, with her hair flowing down her back to her ass, and what an ass it was. She sat in the desk, leaning on it as though she were trying to peer over the Grand Canyon and see me on the riverbed. She wore tight jeans and six inch heels, obviously dressing to impress. &quot;I&#39;m from the Columbia district, how about you?&quot; she asked, wide eyed and thrilled to be speaking with me. <br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Aubrey huffed, looking at the other with disdain, &quot;We were having a conversation. Do you mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do actually. You&#39;re not the only one who wants to get to know our classmates. We&#39;re the elites and we&#39;ll all be graduating together,&quot; the Latina replied. &quot;Sophia,&quot; she continued, turning to me and smiling. &quot;It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you... Jethro.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, eavesdrop much?&quot; Aubrey continued. <br />
<br />
The two seemed to be on the cusp of arguing and so I returned my attention to the Asian girl from before, but just as I did she took up the seat right nex to me in a bold move that seemed to annoy the other two. &quot;I&#39;m Su Minh,&quot; she said, introducing herself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, hello, Su Minh,&quot; I replied, Sophia and Aubrey still fighting. I spared a glance at them only to look back at Su who was staring at me intently. &quot;I wonder what&#39;s gotten into them,&quot; I muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t mind them,&quot; Su said, her voice a very high octave that sounded almost mousy. &quot;They&#39;re just doing what every other girl in this room wants to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; I smiled nervously, having a bad feeling I knew what she was aluding to. &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Talk to you,&quot; came the answer. <br />
<br />
&quot;M-me? Why would anyone want to talk to me?&quot; I asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this is just me speaking for myself but... you are really cute,&quot; she grinned, almost too shy to admit it. <br />
<br />
&quot;You... you think so?&quot; I stammered, sparing a glance towards the classroom doors to see if Lara was on her way back to save me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently a lot of us do,&quot; she replied, pointing down towards the front of the class. I looked around, surveying the whole room. Everywhere I looked there were girls with their eyes on me. Some stared at the three next to me in envy, others looking directly at me with smiles and winks, one even blowing me a kiss, while the others were engaged in conversation with peers but would steal intrigued glances my way. What the hell? No girl had ever looked at me twice before. I was too nerdy, too geeky, too passive, and the glasses didn&#39;t help. Now I was in a room of about fifty students and nearly thirty of them were girls, all seeming to show some rudimentary interest in me... if not something more. I had to admit, I wasn&#39;t used to such attention and it was starting to give me stage fright. <br />
<br />
&quot;Imagine gradually becoming the biggest stud in all humanity,&quot; Lara&#39;s words echoed in my mind as I realized that the process she spoke of was already starting. This was how it would begin. My dick was bigger, my balls were bigger, and now every girl in the room wanted me. What would be next? I had an idea what Lara would say: fuck them all. However, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have that much confidence or energy without her around. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t let them scare you,&quot; Su continued, &quot;I&#39;m here to help in any. way. you. need,&quot; she offered placing her hand on my thigh. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re all here for you,&quot; Aubrey added, touching my hand, and Sophia following up by touching my shoulder. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um... thanks, but I&#39;m okay,&quot; I answered, suddenly feeling a stirring in my pants. I could feel all three pairs of eyes suddenly focus on my crotch and the tent that began to pitch. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, break&#39;s over,&quot; the professor shouted from below. &quot;Let&#39;s finish this last hour and head to lunch.&quot; The girls all turned their attentions to the front in unison as I heard the latch to the classroom door open and in stepped Lara beaming with pride and having a slight coloration in her cheeks. She stepped over Su and me and took her seat on my right, much to the envy of the other three in present company. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did I miss anything?&quot; she asked, breath labored. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes you did,&quot; I muttered. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll talk after,&quot; she reassured me, patting my hand.</p>
