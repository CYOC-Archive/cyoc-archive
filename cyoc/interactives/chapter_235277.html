<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the year moved into late August, places like WSA weren’t the only place starting school and that brought many making their own journeys and preparations for the start of the new year. Some starts had different ones than others.<br />
<br />
&quot;This will be great,&quot; Sophie said to Roland as they climbed out of the Albers van. <br />
<br />
Luwries were parked not too far away with their car. They both looked to a small structure that looked like it had two homes built into one frame and had numbers on the doors for each. Sophie looked down at the papers she had and the envelope that had the physical keys to the building. They were the married couples&#39; homes that were on the SMU campus, and thus would, at least for a school year, be her and Roland&#39;s residence. One where they would be able to be together as husband and wife and not have to worry about campus dormitory rules and without shuffling between the neighboring houses that their parents had in Animalia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... you and me,&quot; Roland smiled to her, &quot;and on the path forward. You can complain about the law school professors while I make dinner...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you can complain about how kids behave while I make breakfast,&quot; Sophie smiled back, &quot;once you get to student teaching next spring.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two nodded and nuzzled their beaks together with some feeling of pride at how far they&#39;d come. Sophie still missed JC and Pauline, but they did manage to keep close and schedule when they could have video calls and keep up to date on what all they were up to. Her internship with one of the small law firms in Lyre had helped with some of the basic nuts and bolts of activities in a law office. Now they were at a point where they were moving forward. Sophie with her four years of law school coming up and Roland finishing his last year for his bachelor&#39;s degree and then his teaching certificate. By this time next year, they&#39;d have a full-time apartment in Dino City, and while Sophie would then have move back to the dorms connected to the law school that was on SMU&#39;s overall campus, there would still be the recognition of things that had advanced from where they were four years ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though the first thing would be to get you both set in,&quot; came her father&#39;s voice from above and behind them making them look back and up.<br />
<br />
Sophie and Roland looked back to see Remington Albers standing on the driver&#39;s side of the van while Vera was moving to direct Persephone as she pulled the Luwrie car up to a spot where she&#39;d park on the street. They knew that the house was built more to Human standards and that their parents wouldn&#39;t be able to go into the house to place things, particularly if any furniture would need to be taken in. As while most modern megafauna Animalians would be cramped in most dwellings built for Humans, that was near impossible for larger Dinotopians like their parents. However, they could help unload the vehicles outside and make it easier for Sophie and Roland to move their things in. There was another car on the driveway that went into the other residence, but for the moment none of the Dinotopians were paying attention to that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right... I&#39;ll go check on things,&quot; Sophie nodded, &quot;the brochure stated they provide basic accommodations, so there should be the basic appliances, a table, a bed, and some chairs and that sort of thing. And some simple television, likely similar to the main ones in the dorms&#39; common rooms, but not much more than that. We&#39;ll need to have our own bed sheets too, obviously.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie walked over to the door that had the number that had come with the paperwork on the one that she and Roland would have for the coming school year. She slid one key out of the envelope and used it to twist the lock. The door opened with ease and Sophie entered into a modestly sized living room. There was some set piece furniture that was there and was likely something that came with the college provided residences, but it was pretty simple. The living room had a simple upholstered couch with a floral pattern and a moderately sized television on a simple wooden platform. The room then opened into a dining area ahead of her, which had a relatively small table with wooden chairs around it. Sophie noted that there were more chairs than would be needed between her and Roland.<br />
<br />
That wasn&#39;t too much of an issue, though, as Sophie approached to note a decent sized card that was seated on the table and read, &quot;Welcome Roland and Sophie Luwrie.&quot; That brought a smile to Sophie&#39;s beak as she then continued her tour, nothing a set of closets built into the wall to her right, which she figured were for coats and boots, though for her and Roland, sandals would do for footwear. There was a modest kitchen with one oven, a gas stove, and an older looking microwave on the counter next to it. The sink wasn&#39;t much, but it was in front of a decent window that faced to the east and the backyard beyond. Sophie could also see that backyard looking out onto some of the other grounds that were nearby and the taller dormitory buildings not too far away. Passing through there took her into the small laundry room that had no windows and there were no baskets provided. She found that there was a door that led out into the backyard, but no other door, which would mean a doorway on the northeast side was likely the doorway to the bedroom and bathroom area. That was enough of an inspection and Sophie then moved to head back out and left the paperwork and things on the table. As for the moment, they were moving in.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... how do things look?&quot; Roland asked as Sophie came out and saw that Tyler and Persephone were standing behind the Albers van with Remington and Vera for the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s about what we expected,&quot; Sophie answered, &quot;they have the most basic amenities for things like furniture and likely something that they&#39;re connecting to the college. So, we shouldn&#39;t be in need of anything... or having our folks ship things from Animalia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least THIS year,&quot; Roland reminded, &quot;the things that they became too big for will need to go with us to Dino City when next summer comes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll handle that when we get to it,&quot; Sophie told her husband, &quot;For now we have unpacking. The bedroom is in the front left corner of the home, and you&#39;d go through the living room to get to it. The dining room is straight ahead, and the kitchen would be next to the dining room. The laundry will be on the back left... and we&#39;ll likely need to fiddle with the air conditioning. I don&#39;t think they had it on all summer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Best to start with the food first,&quot; Vera commented, &quot;we packed enough igloos that you two should be good for a few days... and kept enough ice to keep things cool, but you&#39;ll want them to make sure they get into a fridge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Especially when not all of it is jerky,&quot; Roland agreed, &quot;thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we need to return the igloos?&quot; Sophie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... or at least not with these,&quot; Vera answered as she turned her head to Persephone, who nodded, &quot;most of our food doesn&#39;t need refrigeration as much as meat does, and we didn&#39;t really pack all that much for us on the way down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie and Roland nodded. They&#39;d all largely ate out on the way down from Animalia. The things that were packed for food were largely bits of beef, fish, chicken, turkey, and even some other meats. The one thing that had been a snack in the van was jerky.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two might also need them for picking up things while you&#39;re down here,&quot; Persephone added, &quot;particularly if this heat keeps up...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie and Roland nodded as they came forward. Remington handed Sophie a large red igloo from the back of the van while Vera then handed a smaller blue igloo to Roland. As the two of them turned around, they watched as the door to the other residence opened and a young woman came out of it. She was Human with slightly bronzed skin and dark hair, and with dark brown eyes. She wore a pair of jean shorts that came halfway down her thighs and a white shirt blue star on its chest. The shirt also slightly curved over the beginnings of a noticeable baby-bump.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; the young neighbor woman spoke, &quot;you&#39;re the ones into the adjoining residence?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... we&#39;re just moving in,&quot; Roland spoke, &quot;this is my wife, Sophie. Back there are my parents, Tyler and Persephone Luwrie and her parents Remington and Vera Albers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Real Dinotopians, you from Dino City?&quot; the woman asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lyre/Animalia for us,&quot; Remington gestured himself, his wife, and the Luwries.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll be moving there after this school year,&quot; Roland added, &quot;I&#39;m finishing up my education courses this year on the main campus, Sophie will be starting law school, and next summer... we&#39;ll move into Dino City, where in the fall, I&#39;ll hopefully be teaching kindergarten/preschool down there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow... and we&#39;ll be neighbors for a school year,&quot; the woman gave a smile, &quot;my husband Jackie will be sad to have missed this. He&#39;s a big Jurassic Park fan. I&#39;m Maya, Maya Lopez. Do you need any help with anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe with moving some boxes in,&quot; Sophie said slowly, &quot;though...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry about junior,&quot; Maya answered and gave her belly a soft pat, &quot;I&#39;m only just in my fourth month... It wasn&#39;t planned, but things are healthy for me. So, it isn&#39;t like I can do much about it, particularly in this state. So long as the box doesn&#39;t weigh a ton, I can carry it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then...&quot; Remington answered and offered Maya a modest sized box and then looked up to Sophie and Roland who were slowly making their way up toward their door, &quot;we&#39;ll start unloading the van and set them on the driveway. You can go in an assembly line.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were some nods as Sophie and Roland lead Maya in. The door had been just ajar enough that Sophie could push it open with the igloo and then made her way into the residence and made a beeline for the kitchen. The plan was to put the igloo on the counter and then put the food into the fridge as fast as possible. Any melted ice would be dumped into the tub later. Maya followed behind them and Sophie could hear the clinking of dishes and silverware inside the box as Maya walked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can place that table,&quot; Sophie instructed, &quot;it sounds like dishes and silverware in there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Maya answered, &quot;so... you all didn&#39;t become the same Dinotopians?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Roland and I became Pterodactyls... to be bond mates and all that,&quot; Sophie answered, &quot;and that was back in high school for us. Our parents only became Dinotopians around Chinese New Year this year... for the Year of the Dragon. Mom and dad became Mamenchisaurus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My folks became Alamosaurus Dinotopians,&quot; Roland added, &quot;they&#39;re the more blue-bluish silver ones. Sophie&#39;s parents are the green ones with gold spots.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And a lot of their choice in species was more protective... thinking that with the way some things are going, that if things do go south,&quot; Sophie added, &quot;they&#39;d be able to protect us if need be. And they certainly did put on the muscle to do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maya gave a chuckle, &quot;given some of the stories on Animalians... I&#39;d imagine they both put on a bit more than just muscle. And probably so did you two.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie could only chuckle a bit as she and Roland moved about placing the milk and meat refrigerator. It did hum when they opened the door, so it was still running.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... there is probably a bit of THAT for everyone that becomes an Animalian,&quot; Sophie admitted, &quot;but there is a lot of romantic and family love that is there for Animalians. One of my friends parents became Animalians pretty quickly and conceived puppies almost as soon as the mom came into heat. And the parents of the first Human born Animalian had a foal this summer as well. Our parents... they may have more kids now that they&#39;re young again... and if they make that choice that&#39;s up to them. If they&#39;re happy, I&#39;m happy for them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... did all your friends&#39; parents become Animalians?&quot; Maya wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Among our close group... no,&quot; Sophie answered, &quot;Jessica&#39;s parents stayed Human... and I think Roger&#39;s parents stayed Human too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though, not everyone NEEDS to be an Animalian,&quot; Roland commented, &quot;if one WANTS to change, great. There are plenty of colony cities the world over, and there are some Animalians that live outside of them... but if one wants to remain Human, that&#39;s fine too. It&#39;s why we&#39;re up to date on our vaccines.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie watched Maya nod as they quickly put away their food and set the igloos on the floor near the back door. There was some melted ice in them, but that would be handled later. They then made their way out to the driveway, where Remington, Tyler, Persephone, and Vera had already stacked out a fairly decent sized number of boxes.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... are you just starting college, or is this post graduate studies?&quot; Sophie asked to Maya.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... Jackie is just starting college, but it&#39;s my second year,&quot; Maya answered, &quot;and we were able to get the married residence because of the fact that it IS my second year. The baby was a surprise, and that&#39;s probably what prompted the wedding... but it&#39;s worked out so far. Jackie can be a bit of a goof, and he&#39;ll probably end up a professional comedian regardless of his degree... but in a way, that is something I&#39;ve liked about him. And you two?&quot;<br />
<br />
They picked up a set of boxes and moved to carry them in. Roland&#39;s clanged with the sound of metal pans and skillets hitting each other while the boxes Sophie and Maya carried were a bit quieter. Roland took his box to the table while Sophie and Maya placed their boxes on the floor in front of the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, for me it is post graduate work...&quot; Sophie said slowly, &quot;law school... SMU Dedman School of Law. I&#39;m hoping to start my own practice in Dino City, and largely representing Horizon in dealing with potential challenges coming from the state... and at the same time, offering something of a legal conscience. Though... I&#39;d probably work with just enough general practice rules so that I&#39;m not working toward just one client.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m actually completing my bachelor&#39;s degree, and the things required for a teaching certificate,&quot; Roland answered, &quot;I&#39;d actually taken courses at a different rate than Sophie during our first four years, and my grade point average was better... but it also meant that after four years, I didn&#39;t have the credits to graduate, and thus I have one more year. It&#39;ll mean some things are more expensive, but I think it&#39;ll give me a leg up for getting a job with the Dino City School District when it starts next year. The kids may not be the present hatchlings that have been hatched there, as they might be young... BUT Dino City has gained enough popularity that some people are moving in with families in tow... and Glen Rose won&#39;t have the room to house them all, so Dino City will get its start next year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like a lot,&quot; Maya commented, &quot;though... even if it&#39;s only for the coming school year, it could make for good friends...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie and Roland both thought over other things. JC and Pauline moving to Africa, Travis and Sarah moving to Reno, and Abby and Samson looking at eventually moving to Montana.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d like that,&quot; Sophie answered with Roland nodding beside her.</p>
