<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shyra knew she made a bad first impression with Jessica and her father. She had been rather eager to meet one of the members of Animalia Ambassadoria and she got a bit too enthusiastic. It was easy for her to forget not everyone has the same relaxed standards as her. Well, the relaxed standards she had now. Being turned into a young busty rabbit definitely made her lustier than she been for years. But then, she was a <i>rabbit</i>, that&#39;s to be expected.<br />
<br />
And it turns out her exuberance were stretching the tolerances of even her fellow Animalians. So after the rather mishandled attempt to get to know Jessica, Shyra found herself being sent to Dr. Jones because of her &#39;Regression Hypersexuality&#39;. But at least she wasn&#39;t the only getting that treatment. While Shyra was waiting for Dr. Jones to get to her, she was shooting the breeze with the other girl. Olivia Goldsmith, or rather Gazette Onyx, had been doing this therapy for a while now. Shyra had already heard about Gazette&#39;s steamy reputation when she started working at The Meat Market.<br />
<br />
&quot;Personally, I think they&#39;re a bit threatened by women who are open about their sexuality,&quot; said Shyra, &quot;They see a woman coming onto them and they want to back out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you might have been coming too strong,&quot; said Gazette, &quot;I mean, you were trying to come on to a 16-year old girl and her married father.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet you flirt with married men too,&quot; said Shyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, but I&#39;m not trying to convert them,&quot; said Gazette.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn&#39;t forcing myself on him. I wasn&#39;t going to grab Jessica and drag her onto the stage so she could strip. There wasn&#39;t even any stripping going on that day,&quot; said Shyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still, I don&#39;t think any parent would like their daughter going into a strip club,&quot; said Gazette.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, so maybe I didn&#39;t think it through,&quot; said Shyra, &quot;But do they really need to brand me with a mental problem and make me come here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know about you, but I actually have a diagnosed mental illness,&quot; said Gazette. Shyra gave her a leery look. &quot;I have PTSD from serving as a spy in occupied France in WWII,&quot; said Gazette, &quot;What&#39;s your excuse for acting out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I really need an excuse?&quot; asked Shyra. Gazette just gave her a steady look. &quot;Ok, fine, so my life wasn&#39;t the best before I changed. I was in my 80&#39;s, living alone with only coupons and sherry for company. It wasn&#39;t really the retirement plan I was expecting when I was young,&quot; said Shyra with annoyance.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do when you were young?&quot; asked Gazette.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much what I&#39;m doing now,&quot; said Shyra, &quot;Dancing and serving drinks, though I did more of the latter. Back then, it was the Mafia who was running the casinos.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn&#39;t sound like something you&#39;d want to go back to,&quot; said Gazette.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, they were good years for me. Years where people actually noticed me,&quot; said Shyra.<br />
<br />
Gazette was no shrink herself, but she got the feeling that Shyra had depression and self-esteem issues. &quot;Well, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re getting a fresh start here,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I already got my fresh start,&quot; said Shyra, thinking back to when she was converted.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Mabel Scott was particularly eager when they finally got around to processing her form. There were a lot of people who were applying to get into Animalia and there was a significant background check before they were cleared. But now she had the chance to finally leave that crappy apartment of hers and her sad, dreary life.<br />
<br />
Wanting to feel energetic and lively again, she chose an animal well-known for being full of energy. And she admitted that being a rabbit had several other appealing traits to it as well. From what she had heard, her donor wasn&#39;t one of the wild rabbits who were uplifted during the Outbreak, but a pet rabbit that was uplifted when it was exposed to tainted water. But that didn&#39;t really mean anything to Mabel. She just wanted to get her transformation over with.<br />
<br />
As soon as she got her doses and the scientist left, Mabel stripped down and tried to stimulate herself. She could already feel the tickle, but she wanted to help it along. Though it didn&#39;t help that her breasts felt like sagging half-filled bags in her hands and her vagina was nearly unresponsive to her touch. But eventually, she felt her body responding to her touching. She could also feel it start to tighten up, the sag and weight of too many years being erased. She could also feel the fur start to spread across her body.<br />
<br />
As her self-pleasuring got more intense, she became less aware of her body&#39;s animal changes. Her feet grew longer as they adapted to a digitigrade stance. Her short fluffy tail grew without being noticed. She did pay attention a bit when here ears were growing very long. But the most attention she paid to her transformation was when her breasts started swelling dramatically. She looked down in amazement to watch her now fur-covered boobs inflate in her hands. It only served to stimulate her more as they became more sensitive. She grunted with effort before she finally reached her peak.<br />
<br />
Once she had finished, Mabel got up to look at herself in the mirror. And she really liked what she saw. Gone was the old frumpy woman, here was the sexy young rabbit woman she was hoping to see. She had turned out better than she had hoped. Her breasts had swollen to at least D-cups and her waist was very slim and toned now. Her hips and ass also looked great and combined with her rack and waist to make a very noticeable hourglass figure. In fact, Mabel thought she looked a bit like that Toon sex symbol woman. What was her name again? Oh yes, Jessica Rabbit. She even had her long vibrant red hair back. Interestingly, she wasn&#39;t completely white. She had some black patches on her body, most noticeably over her eyes that looked a lot like eyeshadow. Her ears were a bit longer than she expected and instead of standing straight up, they hung down alongside her hair.<br />
<br />
Mabel posed sexily in front of the mirror. &quot;Mabel Scott has officially left the building,&quot; she purred to herself in a low, seductive voice. But what could she call herself? It was a pity that &#39;Jessica&#39; was already taken. Well, she can think on that later. She was still feeling very horny and she was going to put this bunny body through more of its paces. As she started fingering herself again, she made a mental note to get a vibrator. Probably one shaped like a carrot.</p>
