<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Grizzer was still thinking about Ty and the new package he had given him.<br />
<br />
He rode down the highway on his Harley Davidson and could feel his new genitals; they squished against his seat with more weight and spread across the seat more than he remembered. It made him feel more confident and aroused than usual. <br />
<br />
Arriving at The Smuggler's Den, he sat on his parked bike outside and looked down. A bulge the size of a large melon poked it's way out the front of his jeans, the thickness of his new penis was easily visible. Luckily, his large frame compensated for the potnetially strange proportions than his bulge could have induced. It felt like he had a smaller, longer ass at the front of his hips. Merely sitting on the bike was very arousing and he barely controlled himself from rubbing his hands across his mammoth balls and huge pipe in front of some of the boys hanging out at the front of the Den. As his huge erection began to appear, he heard the fabric of his jeans stretching and making a noticeable taering noise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ey Boys&quot; Grizzer said as he walked past them as they grunted their replies. He walked away from them quickly hoping they wouldn't notice the erection poking out from just above his right knee and the trickle of pre-cum pouring down the jeans. He unsuspiciously rushed to the loo accessed from the side of the Den.<br />
<br />
It was a dark, cramped room with signatures and graffiti in every portion of the walls. A small light hung from the cieling where many large, dead flies lay dead in it.<br />
<br />
&quot;My dick must hung longer than that...&quot; Grizzer muttered as he heaved himself into the cramped room. His large, perky ass was almost as wide as the room. He pulled down his jeans and saw his huge new member. His old underwear barely covered 1/4 of the cock that poked up but straight (about a 45* angle). It felt extremely heavy, and it was just unbelievably long and thick. It was so strong it pushed up and back his round, hairy beer belly and he didn't need to lean forward to see it, in fact he was leaning back.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's 15 inch and 10 inch 'round... it's as long as my fore-arm and as thick as a torch.&quot; Grizzer thought as he leaned forward to check out his balls. They were a combined size of a small melon, and his scrotum was extremely oversized, so his big, hairy balls even had mroe excess skin poking out from around them, which all hung about 5 inches from the base of his penis. No wonder his jeans bulge had been so big! But this didn't encourage him to wear larger jeans in the future.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a thin, long-fingered hand reached from behind him and grasped the center of his penis, the thickest part, excluding the head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hard as wood&quot; a familiar phrase Grizzer heard, it always reminded him to great memories. It was Olive, Grizzer's wife (who was not surprised at the new size as she was VERY used to it), Ty had made her very attractive, thin, same age, yet she fit in around the Den, and could easily be a typical Biker's wife, she had quite a handful of tattoos herself and fuzzy, unmanaged blonde hair. <br />
<br />
Instantly and wordless, Grizzer turned around and crushed Olive against the dirty, graffiti-ed wall of the loo (the door was still open which added to the air of recklessness). As his large, hairy beer belly squashed her against the wall as he impaled his mammoth penis into her. Despite his size, he was always energetic during sex and could pummel Olive for hours, thrusting into her 11 times per 10 seconds. Olive held her breath, but suppressed moans were still audible. Grizzer's penis was incredibly hard, long and strong. It felt like it was going half up her. The sex was so powerful that Olive didn't noticed the pain of banging her head against the low cieling or hitting her shoulder against a wall. Grizzer flailed Olive up and down the wall... she could not focus on anything. Just be in amazing ecstasy as Grizzer's cock just barely squeezed it's way into her vagina and felt like it was thrusting every corner of it...</p>
