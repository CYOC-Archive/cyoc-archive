<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Susan left her bathroom, she heard a door open. Knowing who it was, she smiled as she went to make breakfast. She had just started when the man walked into the kitchen. He had her blanket wrapped around him. She could immediately tell what his tells were. His ears were pointed like an elves. Then his toenails were oddly thick and dark. The biggest tell for Susan though were the bumps on his chest. When he saw her he jumped a bit. &quot;I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re the horse from last night?&quot; she asked. It took him a minute but he was able to recall bits about a were-lion plunging its cock into his ass. &quot;uh, yes. I&#39;m Jeremy&quot; Jeremy said. &quot;Susan&quot; she responded. After the two introduced themselves they talked for a bit. Both could only remember bits of Sirius and Silver. However, still, it was a wonderful experience. She found out Jeremy was an IT tech at a nearby police station. She had just told him about her job as a zookeeper when he heard a buzzing near the front door. Walking over the two saw it was part of the man&#39;s destroyed jeans. Jeremy pulled out a phone and answered. His face turned from confusion to worry as he asked if there were any clothes he could borrow. Thankfully Susan had some clothes that could fit him, she just hoped no one would notice the butterfly design on the jeans. After he left Susan&#39;s mind went back to the book. Going to the bathroom and retrieving it she then sat down in the dining room. She had realized she could do whatever she wanted with this book. Heck, she could even be a god with everyone in the universe obeying her. However, she didn&#39;t feel the need to. Life was all about enjoyment, right? Susan&#39;s thoughts went back to the footage she saw of last night. Wondering what stories there could be she flipped the page. She wasn&#39;t too surprised to see her specific tv in written form. She soon changed its purpose. &#39;The TV belonging to Susan brown will have magical properties. It will show her what she wants to see from anywhere. It will now turn on by itself and show seven different people changing last night as if she were there. The changing people will not see anything recording them nor will they feel like they&#39;re being watched&#39;, Like before as soon as she was done reality changed. Her TV turned on and displayed a woman with short brown hair relaxing on her porch. Knowing where this was headed Susan sat down on the couch. <br />
<br />

<br />
Ashley needed this. The last few weeks had been hectic. Her eight-year-old son had been struggling in school. Not with grades but because a bully kept picking on him. The boys had been picking on Jason on his way to and from school. Being so close to the school it didn&#39;t last long. The boy only did it when Ashley couldn&#39;t drive or pick him up. The worst part is that they had no proof as the bully would use non-physical attacks to hurt Jason&#39;s emotional and mental states. She wished she could do something but she was just an employee at a salon, how was she gonna help? Maybe Jason still had a father to deal with this, however, his father died last April. As Ashley remembered her husband the moon began to show itself from behind the clouds. Ashley suddenly felt good. Beneath her red shirt and jeans her muscles grew rapidly. She tried to keep herself from moaning so Jason could sleep but it felt too amazing. Her pussy became wet as hair began to grow across her body. Everything happened in a few moments but it felt like several amazing hours to her. Her feet kicked off her flip-flops as they got bigger. Each digit on them became more flexible as the big toes moved up the feet becoming thumbs. From her crotch, the zipper and button broke revealing a massive veiny cock and equally large balls. Her belly ballooned out into a massive muscle gut as her boobs lost their perkiness, beneath which massive pecs formed. Ashley&#39;s face became simian as sideburns coated his cheeks. The flimsy chair couldn&#39;t hold the sudden increase in weight causing him to fall as his clothing ripped apart. The loud thud awoke Jason.  <br />
<br />
Hearing the sounds outside he grabbed his dad&#39;s old camera and set it to record. Then he aimed it out the window where he had a perfect view of the porch and the creature. It looked like his mom but also didn&#39;t with the latter becoming more true in moments. Soon an eight-foot were-gorilla was covered in hair and jacking off. Fangor moaned as he came across the wood. &quot;that... was awesome&quot; he said. Feeling hungry he opened the sliding door. Remembering the food in the fridge he began stuffing himself. He was halfway through eating a banana when he heard the creaking of wood. Turning his head he saw Jason with a camera. The boy looked scared but felt relief when he heard Fangor&#39;s voice. &quot;hey buddy, what are you doing up?&quot; his voice was reminiscent of a beach dude. Jason explained what he saw and showed the footage he caught. Fangor saw how good he looked and praised his son. After sending him to bed again he looked at the computer in the living room. Knowing people had to see this he uploaded the footage to the news. He did however edit out his release though. Once that was done he smiled and went back to the kitchen. <br />
<br />

Eva was in her penthouse trying on gowns for the evening. In less than an hour the new skincare treatment her company invented would be unveiled and she needed to figure out what to wear. As she was putting on the latest gown she suddenly felt very horny. She grabbed the chair as her body began to grow. Her gown strained against her muscles. Several black spikes appeared on her shoulders and scalp as read scales surrounded them. They soon spread across her body as her breasts shrank. Pinkish-white scales covered her mouth and front as large pecs tore through her dress. Instinctively he humped the air as a large dragon cock grew from his closing pussy. Soon large balls dropped. From his backside, two large wings and a long tail grew. He gained a beard on the bottom part of his growing muzzle. A trail of black hair grew between his testicles, front, armpits, and forearms. Each digit was now tipped in a claw. Draco grabbed his dick and moaned as he jacked off, his cum covering the mirror and gowns. As he finished he wiped the cum off the mirror. He brushed his long hair out of his face and admired his body. Looking to his right he saw the night sky and felt it calling to him. &quot;well, I can&#39;t go to that gala like this so...&quot; he rushed to the window. The glass broke as he extended his wings. After a few flaps, he was amazed at how natural it felt. Soon he found the skies to be filled with other winged were-creatures. Draco had to admit this was the most fun he&#39;d ever had.  <br />
<br />

<br />
Margret had been helping Sophia with her homework for a while now. Looking at the model for a new filtration system she was impressed. The two were putting on the finishing touches when they both moaned. While Margret&#39;s changes made her more bulky, Sophia&#39;s changes made her more agile. However, Susan skipped overseeing this as the two began to kiss, on the mouth. Quickly grabbing the book she changed it so the changes made today would apply to last night. Unfortunately, that meant she only saw them after they changed. Sophia was solid brown with ears sticking out over her head, he had this chest fur and thick fur on his shoulders and elbows. Margret on the other hand was far more muscled giving him a fridge body. While his front and face were creme the rest of his was white. He had a bead around his short muzzle and thick brown hair on his chest and up his abs. Warren now looked at his son Rex like his bro. This was a relief to Susan before she changed the channel. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Damien had just done a few laps in the pool for night training. Suddenly as he was headed to the locker room her felt aroused. Just as he entered he found his body hair getting thicker and his nails sharper. His ears got pointed as his teeth sharpened. His face pushed into a muzzle as his swim shorts got too tight. She grabbed them as his pelt grew. A black mane surrounded his head as a wolf&#39;s tail grew out of his ruined trunks. His feet became paws as he sat down. In a matter of moments, the man was now a huge werewolf. Fenrir&#39;s cock exited its new sheath as he smelled others. Several other male were-creatures came in. he ended up with a were-tigers cock in his ass while sucking off a were-bull&#39;s dick. Susan flipped the channel when this started. She felt like this was their own business. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
David Sanders felt exhausted. He pulled into a truck stop and was about to head inside when the moon came out. Suddenly he felt like he had drunk several cups of coffee. He could feel his muscles growing and it felt good. Fur covered his muscles as his clothes ripped. His feet became paws as did his hands, those still worked as normal. What did surprise him was the inclusion of bull horns, a scorpion tail, and bat wings. Looking in his mirror he saw the most handsome were-manticore he could ever dream of. He wasn&#39;t the only one who thought that. A were-panda man soon surprised him by plunging his cock into his ass. Once again Susan flipped the channels.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Randall Ainsworth didn&#39;t seem too interesting to Susan. Apart from regaining his youth, he had the least romance of all of them. Then again that could be because he lives alone. Regardless this was when Susan turned off the TV just as the were-bear was exiting the shower. Susan then brought out the book and got the bios of the people she just watched. Looking at Randall&#39;s profile she was horrified to learn he was a sexual predator. He would break into women&#39;s homes and force them to have sex. Angered that he could do such a thing she changed his bio. &#39;Due to the new sense of smell police have been able to track Randall to his house. His were-form is rather punny, being the size of a kid with barely any muscle tone and a pussy instead of a dick and sack. Later it will be determined that his excisive drinking and smoking stunted his were-form without his knowledge.  <br />
<br />
Looking at the TV now, she saw Randall Mason being led away from his house in handcuffs. Smiling, Susan turned to the next bio. Seeing it made her feel pity. She once again changed his bio, but this time for the better. &#39;David Sanders is a healthy adult man. His unique now female were-manticore form gives him a never-ending feeling of energy with no negative side effects. Instead, he can choose when he can go to sleep&#39;. Susan saw the screen show David with a perfect body as opposed to his fat, balding and drug-addicted one. His chest showed two bumps and a bulge in the rear of his pants insinuated his scorpion tail still exited. Apart from that and his sharp teeth and nails, he looked normal. Then again every human past puberty had a tell, so to be more accurate the new normal. <br />
<br />
Looking at Eva&#39;s bio, she smirked. She changed it, too: &#39;Eva Winters will keep her wings in her human form. She will enjoy it, though, and it won&#39;t impede her work. After each transformation into Draco, she will find herself becoming more masculine and loving it. When fully male, he will bump into her soul mate and date her for some time before marrying her&#39;. She smiled as this would unlock Eva&#39;s hidden desire. Her tv now showed Eva waking up and overjoyed to see she kept her wings and cock. She also had the spikes on her shoulders remain. After waking up she called her tailor and told him she needed all her clothes redone.  <br />
<br />
The next bio was Margret and Sophia&#39;s. Looking at it she found there wasn&#39;t much to change. Still, she did, &#39;Margret now has a permanent cock, it will be two feet when hard and a foot soft. Despite this Margret will find her life improved. Sophia will be able to shift between her human and were-rabbit form at will&#39;. Looking at the TV it showed the mother and daughter duo going about their morning. Margret had a large bulge beneath her dress as well as buck teeth and larger muscles that stretched out her dress. Sophia was the biggest shock. Rex had told his mom he preferred to be his were-rabbit form.  <br />
<br />
Flipping to Damien&#39;s bio Susan smiled. He seemed to embrace everything about his were-form except one. She grinned as she changed that problem. &#39;Damien found out last night that his female werewolf form is the best swimmer at the gym&#39;. There wasn&#39;t much to change. Looking at the screen she saw Damien swimming. He had on a pair of green swim trunks but nothing else. Allowing Susan to see his two budding breasts, fangs, and claws. The others at the gym seemed unbothered by this and congratulated Damien on his performance. <br />
<br />
Ashley&#39;s bio made Susan hurt. She had been bullied as a child just like Jason. Determined to fix this problem Susan went to town on the page. &#39;Ashley will be able to switch between her human and were-form. Unlike other were-creatures, Ashley remembers everything Fangor does and vice versa. She will find herself preferring to be Fangor rather than Ashley over the week until he decides to permanently become Fangor to protect his son on the final day. From then on the bully wont dare to mess with Jason.  <br />
<br />
Additionally, he will be allowed to keep his job, his employer will be amazed at how dexterous his legs are&#39;. Watching the screen one final time she saw Jason and Ashley sitting at the table in their house. Ashley was apologizing for being nude in front of him to which Jason said he was avoiding looking there. Looking at Ashley she saw her face looking slightly ape-like. She was also barefoot allowing her to see her feet looked more flexible than before.  <br />
<br />
Susan soon realized not everyone preferred to be nude in their were-form. While she didn&#39;t mind being naked as Sirius she knew others would. Picking up the book she wrote &#39;Each clothing store will now sell clothing for were-beasts. Being clothed will be completely optional for were-beasts. Men and women will find items to cover their bodies. However, men will prefer to go topless and show off their bodies, except for open shirts, vests, and jackets. Susan will have a variety of their male outfits in the closet to the left of her living room TV&#39;. As soon as she was done she saw the closet. Opening it up revealed more clothing than she had in her original closet. She wondered if she should write she could transform at will so she could get Sirius dressed but her alarm went off. Grabbing her stuff she was about to go to her car when she remembered the book. Deciding to take it with her she made her way to the zoo.</p>
