<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Talia was sitting there with Nemo and Torrent when shi got a call from Sammy. Shi started talking. &quot;Talia, are you in Miami?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know how we can stop Cuba from attacking. Aqua came up with the idea for North Korea and I&#39;m thinking that it can work both ways. Is hir part of the ship working?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the &#39;ark&#39; is a massive magnet. If you were to take your half of the sub to Cuba....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can prevent an arial attack from Cuba. Not a bad idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
Talia looked at them. &quot;My friends, we&#39;re going to Cuba.&quot; <br />
<br />
Torrent smiled and the three got in. They headed strait south to Cuba. Once they arrived they saw many ships with flags from all over. The U.S, Brazil, Argentina, Egypt, Spain, Italy, France, England, Germany, Russia, Poland, South Africa, Some ships representing all the islands in the Gulf and Caribbean along with various other nations. When they arrived they realized they&#39;d be amazed if anyone could get out. They just went right through and stopped right on Cuba&#39;s coast. Once there Nemo activated the magnet system and to everyone surprise the power it had covered the entire country. Fortunately the room they were in was air locked and they were under the water.<br />
<br />
Talia and Torrent were ready to go to shore when Nemo intervened. &quot;Talia, why don&#39;t you stay here, in your condition you shouldn&#39;t risk it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nemo, even on my death bead I&#39;m still a force to be reckoned with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but why risk it when you don&#39;t have to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nemo&#39;s right, Talia.&quot; Torrent walked up. &quot;We&#39;ll handle this one. Besides, we&#39;ll have back up soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, but... if you need me, you call.&quot; Talia said sitting at the controls as Torrent and Nemo swam to one of the U.S. Ships to lend support.<br />
<br />
------------------------------<br />
<br />
Janace, Anubis, and Trigger were the only ones that Maurice could find. Shi did get a shock to find Luna and Lia there visiting. Lia walked up. &quot;How can we help?&quot; Shi smiled.<br />
<br />
Maurice smiled. &quot;Well, you two have good timing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lia looked. &quot;Well, I&#39;m here to help finish while Luna came to help with hir sisters. Francine and Justin decided we are needed at home right now so, here we are. We&#39;re here to help finish off these stupid ass outbreaks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and considering I&#39;m pregnant again, I figured it&#39;d be best to help my two sisters, and I plan to talk with Janice and Snowflake. I heard they got a tail chewing but I think what they misunderstand is that they think they&#39;re the first to make a mistake like this. So, I&#39;m here to give them a pep talk on it. But, I haven&#39;t seen Mid in a while so I do believe it&#39;s time for some sisterly time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Lia, you&#39;ll go with the team to Cuba then.&quot; Maurice smiled.  &quot;Janice, Anubis and Trigger are going with you. They&#39;re at the airport getting ready to leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lia kissed Luna and ran to the Airport to catch up. Luna headed strait to hir mom&#39;s place to see hir little sister. Lia smiled walking up to Janace. &quot;Hello Jan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lia? What are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, me and Luna have vowed to see the end of these outbreaks and well, here I am. Are you saying you don&#39;t want me on the last mission?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I&#39;m just shocked to see you here.&quot; Janace hugged Lia and they got on board the plane.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------<br />
<br />
After hours they finally arrived on the carrier.  Torrent and Nemo met with Janace, Anubis, Trigger and Lia. They sat in the mess hall explaining what had happened. The ships captain came in and talked with them. Shi was a kat like them and asked that shi go along. They nodded and had decided. Just as things started to get ready to commence, the Cuban government had to realize they were severely out numbered, with over three hundred ships surrounding them, and now that their air travel and everything else wouldn&#39;t work, they had surrendered. Torrent looked. &quot;Wow, it&#39;s working better than I thought.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes but that&#39;s where you lot come in.&quot; The Captain spoke.<br />
<br />
Torrent nodded. &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot; Shi stood up and the team headed out to a boat on the side, took it to shore. &quot;Okay, me and Nemo will take Lia and go one direction, Anubis, Trigger, Janace, you three go the other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good idea.&quot; They all nodded and parted.<br />
<br />
Nemo, Lia, and Torrent spoke as they walked along, getting to know Nemo real well. If Jules would&#39;ve known that Nemo was from space, the stories would&#39;ve been even more unbelievable. However Lia was beyond fascinated with Nemo. No wonder why Torrent became a fan. Grant it it was easy to get lost, after all, they were in Havana. But it didn&#39;t take them long to find one of the labs they were looking for. They walked right up and when they were told they&#39;re not getting in, Nemo busted the door in and they waltz right in. The scientists working were in utter shock and quit working. Torrent looked. &quot;By the order of all in the world, the operation and making of the chakat virus is over.&quot; When shi looked all in there ran out, dropping their tools, only thinking they were safer out there, they ran right into the arms of Marines. The lab was shut down.<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------------------------<br />
<br />
It took six days to cover Cuba and shut down all labs, odd as it is, they managed to shut down drug labs too, so Cuba was starting to look clean. Meanwhile North Korea found itself in the same position as Cuba. They knew if they didn&#39;t surrender they would be slaughtered by many nations there as well. And with their mechanical stuff not working, they were now only ground troops, which they gathered their troops to do what the others were going to. They handed the scientist over and let the teams in to shut down the labs. When they did, the governments declared that North Korea was now property of the U.S. which considering the circumstances, they couldn&#39;t argue, however, the U.S. informed them it would be a temporary fix.  They had caught the last of the scientist. Aqua was sitting there talking with Sammy. &quot;So the outbreaks are over, completely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t say that, Aqua. If this has told us anything, it is that a single mistake can lead to terrible trouble. And though we got the scientists, sure, it does stop the outbreaks but all it takes is for one individual.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good point. Now let&#39;s go home.&quot; They smiled as they all were now headed home.<br />
<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
In Washington Jake was over getting ready to take the Vaccine to become human again when a kat walked up. Shi was absolutely gorgeous. Shi resembled a jaguar. Shi walked up and smiled. &quot;Don&#39;t go changing back Jake, after all, I decided we would live the rest of our lives as kats.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake looked hir over and to hir great pleasure it was hir wife. Shi became a kat to make hir happy. Jake walked up to hir best friends office. The president was sitting there, head resting on his desk. &quot;Mr. President, sir. It would seem the war is over.&quot; Shi walked up. Jake however got no response. &quot;Mr. President, sir?&quot;<br />
<br />
Again no response. Shi walked over and shook him lightly. However when shi did, and got no response again, shi looked up rubbing hir head, feeling his neck. Shi got no pulse. Shi looked at hir wife. &quot;Get his wife.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong Jake?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The president&#39;s dead, hun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But how?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;m not going to be able to resign after all.&quot; Shi walked to the door and had hir wife go out.<br />
<br />
------------------------<br />
<br />
A few days later after the autopsy confirmed that the president passed away, it turned out that he had a massive heart attack. Jake walked into the Oval office and sat behind the camera. The camera came on and Jake was nervous then looks up. &quot;Good morning. My Fellow Americans, and people of earth. It is with good news that we have captured all the scientists behind the outbreaks. I would like to thank those that have helped and extend a full thank you to my family and friends in Janace, CO. Home of the Kat Cops and as of this year, the new location and permanently the new Location of the United Nations building. However, regardless of the good news, it is with a heavy heart, that I must tell you all. Our president and my best friend, passed away. The Autopsy came back that he had a massive heart attack. It leaves me as your next president. However I will inform you, I do not intend to run in the next election. I will finish out my friend&#39;s term and resign. Regardless of this being a depressing day, we are to celebrate the end of these terrible outbreaks. I would like to extend a mass thank you to all our allies who have helped put an end. And to repay the kats, we are issuing a global hunt for parts of their ship so they may go find a new home to prevent over population. Those of you who have been forcefully turned, I highly recommend not changing back. However should you choose to change back, they are giving the Retrovaccine out. The State of Colorado declared that Chakat Industries is under surveillance for what Timothy Chakat did. I hereby announce that they are not. For you cannot fault them for the mistake of another. As for things that have happened over the course of the last twelve years, had Maurice and Snowy not caused the first outbreak, our world wouldn&#39;t be better because of it. They created the perfect cure to all illnesses, and now they are improving. As your new President I will fully support the Chakat Industries.</p>
