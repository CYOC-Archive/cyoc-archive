<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I’ll be able to tell you in just a few minutes,” I said.<br />
 <br />
George’s former father looked annoyed, but she sighed and said “Sure, whatever.”<br />
 <br />
The rest of us turned our focus to Kelly.  I had to admire the girl.  She’d been told that her brother was now a stunningly attractive woman, she watched her mother change in appearance drastically, and then she watched her father turn into a seemingly blonde bimbo.  On top of that those people that had been her parents didn’t know who she was.  “It’s my turn, isn’t it?” she asked.  I nodded.  “OK,” she said.<br />
 <br />
“Kelly, this is important, but I’ll give you the choice.  Do you want to remember anything from before you change?” I asked.<br />
 <br />
She looked at her former parents again.  “They don’t know me at all now?” she asked.  I nodded.  “I guess not then.  It would be silly.”<br />
 <br />
“It will be the same with George,” I advised.<br />
 <br />
“I know,” she said.  She looked down for a minute.  Then she looked at Myrintha.  “I know you’re not really George anymore, but I’m sorry if I was ever mean to you or hurt you or stuff.”<br />
 <br />
Myrintha looked somewhat upset.  “I know,” she said.  “Don’t worry, it’s OK.”<br />
 <br />
“I have one final important question for you, Kelly,” I said.  “I have a feeling you’d rather be a boy, is that right?”<br />
 <br />
Her face brightened.  “Yea, I would!” she said.  “Boys get to have more fun and play rough and not act so…girly.”<br />
 <br />
I laughed.  I liked her enthusiasm.  “Do you want to have muscles like Bozantum?” I asked.<br />
 <br />
“Yea, that would be awesome!” said Kelly.  “I want to be older anyway.”<br />
 <br />
“Very well,” I said.  In my mind I formed an image of how I wanted Kelly to look.  I wished that she would become that image and that she wouldn’t have any memories prior to her change.  I also wished that George’s former parents would forget the moments in between the ends of their own transformations until Kelly’s transformation was complete.<br />
 <br />
Kelly’s transformation happened very quickly.  The first thing to happen was for all of her bruises, cuts and scrapes to heal themselves.  Her skin color also changed as it became more tan that it had been previously.  Her hair, which was not very long to start, quickly retracted into her head until she was left with a traditional buzz cut. <br />
 <br />
Kelly began to squirm in her seat.  She pushed back her chair from the table and I could see that the discomfort was in her feet.  Her feet were rapidly growing too big for her shoes.  Within a few seconds her feet burst through her shoes.  The normally unforgiving material of her shoes gave way to her enlarging feet as if it was tissue paper.  Her socks tore off just as easily.<br />
 <br />
Kelly stood up from the chair as her feet continued to grow.  The changes spread upward as her ankles thickened and her legs grew larger and longer.  She also began to sprout several inches in height.  This caused her shirt and pants to tighten around her expanding body.  They rapidly became much too small for her.  Rips and tears began appearing in several places in both garments.  Kelly seemed to enjoy the changes as a smile spread on her face.  She reached to one of the holes on her shirt and used her enlarging hands to rip open the shirt and tear it off her body.  She threw it to the ground with satisfaction.  Her pants followed suit as the button holding them together snapped off as her waistline expanded.  The rest of her pants fell off in shreds.<br />
 <br />
As she continued to grow in height, she also vastly grew in muscle mass.  Her arms and legs developed thick, strong muscles all over.  He shoulders broadened as her chest hardened with thick pectoral muscles.  Her abs stiffened into a rock-hard six pack.  Muscles also expanded on her back and around her hips and thighs.  The expansion of muscles around her hips caused her underwear to tear apart.<br />
 <br />
Kelly’s soft face grew more masculine as the smooth curves on her face gave way to rough, hard edges.  Her chin and jaw became more pronounced as her cheeks became more angular.  Her nose broadened and her eyebrows thickened.  Her face shifted in general ways until she possessed the face of an attractive young man.  Her neck thickened and an Adam’s apple became evident on her throat.<br />
 <br />
The final change happened quickly.  Kelly looked down with delight as her clit slowly swelled up and spilled out of her vagina.  It shaped itself into a small cock that continued to add length and thickness.  At the same time her feminine slit closed off as her scrotum dropped down.  She let out a very masculine groan as her testicles dropped into her scrotum and steadily became larger.  Her cock grew until it was about 11 inches long.  I just couldn’t let her have quite as large a cock as Bozantum.<br />
 <br />
When the changes ended, Kelly couldn’t help but put his hands on his new member and stroke it a few times back and forth.  I was afraid that he might start to fully masturbate himself right now so I sharply cleared my throat.  He stopped right away and looked around.  “Oh, sorry,” he said in a deep voice.  Then a look of confusion spread on his face.  “Say, who are you guys?”</p>
