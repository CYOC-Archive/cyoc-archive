<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Then Jim wonders how Judy would have been if she was 12. Then he decides to give her a slow growth so he went to his room and found a small machine that he used to use in order to fill with air balloon animals, which was small enough to hide it in his pocket. Then he connects it to the balloon and said “control Judy’s age and the size of her things”, and start the machine at very slow and to stop at right pressure that she would been 12. Then he hides it at drawer of his desk, took the tape measure and come out and in the beginning, it was unnoticed.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing?”, He asks the girls as they headed to the backward.<br />
<br />
“We just go to play basketball, want to come?” Judy says.<br />
<br />
“Yes, why not”, and join them. As they reach the basket at the front of their garage he opens the garage to take the ball.<br />
<br />
“So, who we play”, Judy asks and took the ball from Jim.<br />
<br />
“Since we are 3 you could play 1-1 with me play with the winner”, Dani says<br />
<br />
“Let’s start!”, Jim says as he observes that she is now only 1 ½” shorter than him and somewhat bigger allover her body. She shoots to see who get the ball first and misses. The game begins. At the start, he has the game is equal because he has shorter arms than Judy. After 20 minutes Jim Shoot and get the ball at the basket. The score is 16-12 to Jim’s favor.<br />
<br />
“I didn’t notice we are almost the same height”, Judy says as sees that her eyes are just ½ below his. At the rest of the game she was clearly the better one as he didn’t take the ball not even one’s. When the score was 16-18 he tries to block one of her shots but without any lack.<br />
<br />
“Either you are growing really fast or I am shrinking again!”, Jim says, Judy turns and Dani comes closer. His eyesight was over her mouth.<br />
<br />
“You are right, little bro”, Judy says and laughs as she sees that the top of his forehead now comes under her eyes.<br />
<br />
“I have the tape measure with me”, Jim says and right after he finished the sentence she grabs him and take him inside.<br />
<br />
“Alright let’s measure you first Jim.”, Judy says and pinned him to the wall.<br />
<br />
“So, I shrunk???” Jim asks.<br />
<br />
“No that means that you grow. Let’s see how tall are you, could you measure her Dani.”, Jim says.<br />
<br />
“Of course, Jimmy”, Dani says and take the measurement for Judy’s height.<br />
<br />
“You are 5’0” tall, that means that now you are 2 inches taller than your older brother.”, Dani says as she caresses Jimmy.<br />
<br />
“Let’s finish the game”, Jim says and go to the door.<br />
<br />
“Ok, but I don’t think you have a chance.” Judy says as they flow him outside.<br />
<br />
“So, the score is 16-18 in favor of Judy’s, the ball goes to Jim”, Dani says and gives him the ball. In the rest of the game he tries to shoot but Judy block him easily and get the 2 points with layup. Then she just walks with the ball from out to next to the racket by walking, Jim only delayed her but as soon as she was under the Hoop she makes a shoot, misses and take the rebound and strike again with success.<br />
<br />
“As I told you, shrimp, you didn’t even have a chance since I am that much taller and you are not the most athletic person.”, Judy says and Jim come closer. He saw that she didn’t done growing as she was even bigger.<br />
<br />
“I think you are taller than before”, He says tried to cover the excitement, as he saw that his eyes are at the middle  of her neck<br />
<br />
As she sees him even shorter than before, she gets inside to remeasure her high. Dani remeasured her.<br />
<br />
“That’s really weird, since you are now 5’4” tall! That make you half foot taller than your smaller brother!” she says with worry.<br />
<br />
“To tell you the truth that’s the second time that happens in this week, the first I shrunk to 9-year-old Jim you saw when you came”. Jim says.<br />
<br />
“Who did you come back to normal, maybe it helps Judy too.”, Dani says.<br />
<br />
“I went to a wizard and cure me but he said me that we can find him when he wants, and as I got out of his shop the shop vanished to thin air!”, Jim says<br />
<br />
“So, if you regressed 3 years then Judy grow 3 years”, Dani try to find a logical explanation.<br />
<br />
“Since my clothes grow with me I don’t have the problem little had. So, while it lasted I want have fun with it.”, Judy says and grabs Jimmy and lifts him up like a feather.<br />
<br />
“PUT ME DOWN, NOW JUDY”, Jim says frightens of her new-found strength.<br />
<br />
“You are so light, how much do you weigh, 40, 50 lbs.?”, Judy says and laughing, as Dani too.<br />
<br />
“PUT ME DOWN, PLEASE”, Jim says and Judy do it. Then the go to the bathroom and take the scale.<br />
<br />
“Now let’s see how heavy you are.” Judy says and put down the scale. He hopes on and the scale saws that he is 70 pounds. Then she weighs herself and the scale saw 130 pounds.<br />
<br />
“Oh, you are light. No wonder that I can lift you so easy.”, Judy says and start laugh again, as she grabs him and hold him with her left arm. He tries to resist but in vain as all her weigh she took it in muscles and bones there for he was no much for her. He doesn’t accept that and struggles to escape her without any success.<br />
<br />
“You are really weak for a 12-year-old boy. I can hold you like this forever!” she says and laugh loudly.<br />
<br />
“This is fun, but I must go for shopping, so Judy you are in charge, while I’m gone.”, Dani says and getting ready to go out.<br />
<br />
“But I’m older”, Jim says object to what Dani decided<br />
<br />
“She will be same age as you soon and she is much more responsible, not to mention stronger. Good buy”, Dani explains and goes out.<br />
<br />
“Buy.”, Judy says as she covers Jim’s mouth. Then she goes to the table and drag him with her.<br />
<br />
“Do you want a rematch?”, Judy says<br />
<br />
“No, with your height advantage you sure beat me.”, Jim says and goes to his room. He accelerates the machine and goes out. <br />
<br />
“Let’s compete to something that requires brain and not height or strength”, Jim says as he hold a board game, it is checkers.<br />
<br />
“No first we play football, since you don’t want basketball”, says, as she knows that she was much better before this all started, and took the game off his hands and leave it somewhere he could never reach.<br />
<br />
“I think you grow some more.”, Jim says with excitement, as his eyesight was at her chest, which has started to grow.<br />
<br />
“Let’s measure me”, Judy says, as she laughs when she sees that the top of his head was at her neck and goes to the nearest wall. Jim took a chair and before he climbed it she lifts him. He measured her. <br />
“You are 5’8” tall! Which means you almost a foot taller than me! Can you put me down to see how much to you weight?”, Jim says, instead she goes to the scale with him. Then she put him down and go on the scale which saws that she is 170 pounds with no sign of fat. Then he goes to his room and check the balloon and the machine. The machine has stopped give air to the balloon which means she is 12 now<br />
<br />
“Release.”, He says.</p>
