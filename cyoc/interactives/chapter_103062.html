Back to Seattle…<br />
<br />
Nate remained oddly upbeat the rest of the evening. After he finished wallowing in self pity, he got up, and walked straight up to the others with a giant smile on his face. Which raised a few eyebrows to say the least. <br />
<br />
“I think he might have cracked.” Alex whispered to Ben at one point in the afternoon. Ben didn’t know what to say. Nate had made it very clear he didn’t want to talk about things. And Nate did seem to be enjoying himself. It was like nothing happened between him and Kenya. <br />
<br />
Though Ben was curious as to what really did go down, he wouldn’t press the issue. He would just wait until Nate was ready. But that wouldn’t be until much later in the evening. The rest of the day, from the cookout to the actual concert, to the drive back to Moon Lake, Nate didn’t once mention Kenya. And whenever someone tried to mention her, he was awfully quick to change the subject. <br />
<br />
“Well those others were like methadone. I took to get me through the day. Now I’m trying to find my way back home. Staying clean along the way. Hold out for the real thing.” Nate hummed during the drive back. <br />
<br />
“So, had a good time then?” Alex asked. He and Ben swapped places, Alex driving them back to Moon Lake, while Ben rode shotgun and stretched his feet out. <br />
<br />
“You didn’t?” Nate asked. <br />
<br />
“It would have been better if the sweaty guy in front of me hadn’t kept farting in my face. God, he stunk. Body odor, farts, and don’t even get me started on his beer breath. I thought I was going to pass out from the stench.” Alex gripped. <br />
<br />
“Please, I was standing next to you. It wasn’t that bad. No worse than you after you eat Mexican.” Ben snickered. <br />
<br />
“Whatever. Glad to see you enjoyed yourself Nate.” Alex hit Ben’s shoulder, and kept on driving. <br />
<br />
“Why wouldn’t I?”<br />
<br />
“Uh, you know, that fight with your girlfriend?” Ben said. <br />
<br />
“Ya, ya.” Nate waved the comment away and went back to humming. <br />
<br />
“I got off the rails without you. Sick with this addiction in me…” Nate hummed. Very appropriate for what he was feeling about Kenya at the moment. He knew Ben and Alex wanted to talk to him, and he appreciated their concern. But right now there was only one person he wanted to talk to. Someone else who’d gone through the same kind of hurt and betrayal. <br />
<br />
Nate only hoped Eric wasn’t too busy with Spencer to talk. <br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Jack and Kenya were still wrapped in each other’s arms when Jack got a phone call. He reluctantly answered it, and soon wished he hadn’t. <br />
<br />
“What do you want Dad?” Jack almost growled. <br />
<br />
“You haven’t responded to a single on of my emails, texts, letters, or previous phone calls.” his father said angrily. <br />
<br />
“There’s a damn good reason why, I’m not interested.” Jack said for the hundredth time. <br />
<br />
“Why not?! You can’t keep up this playboy act Jackson, it’s not healthy. You’re almost forty seven, and it’s high time you settled down and started a family. And what’s more, this girl wants to start one with you!” <br />
<br />
“That lioness is nothing but a gold digger. She’s half my age, and as dumb as a sack of corn! I’m telling you for the last time, I’m NOT interested!” Jack hung up and then tossed his phone aside, not caring that it clattered to the floor. Kenya looked up at him, finally having stopped crying. She’d heard the entire conversation, and wondered if Jack had told any of his family about her. <br />
<br />
“What would they say if they knew their son was marrying me?” Kenya thought in a panic. <br />
<br />
“Sorry about that. Now where were we? I believe you were crying and I was comforting you.” Jack smiled and brought Kenya close to him again. But she pushed him back and wiped her eyes. <br />
<br />
“Jack, I can’t. I shouldn’t have come here in the first place.” she said, veritably crushing Jack’s heart into little pieces. <br />
<br />
“Why? Is this your way of saying no? Showing up crying to soften the blow?” <br />
<br />
“No. Nate and I had a fight, and… I guess I just needed someone to cry on.”<br />
<br />
“Nate, that’s your boyfriend’s name? So that’s it? Just use me as a tissue and then leave? No answer?” Jack asked. He felt like he was on the verge of a breakdown as well. <br />
<br />
“No! I mean, not no like no I…” Kenya stopped herself before she inadvertently said yes to Jack’s proposal. After everything that happened in the past hour or so, was she really about to say yes? Jack Ashford was from an entirely different world. How would that relationship even work out? Then again, how did Kenya think her relationship with Nate would play out? <br />
<br />
Let him finish high school, go to college, and then what? What if he wanted to do something with his life away from Moon Lake? Kenya realized she knew very little about Nate aside from the fact that he was originally from Minnesota, was a normal turned into a werewolf, and he was a fairly good cook.<br />
<br />
“We rarely do anything but sleep together, or eat. What kind of relationship is that? And now he probably won’t want to spend any ‘quality’ time with me. Not after this. I ruined everything.” Kenya thought. Tears began to well up in her eyes again, and Jack quickly wiped them away with his thumb. <br />
<br />
“Hey, I’m sorry. I should have been so short with you. I don’t want to lose you. I don’t know how you feel, but I’d say I’m head over heels for you.” Jack admitted, taking Kenya’s hand in his. <br />
<br />
Staring into each other’s eyes, they both assumed their feline forms. Kenya’s body became enveloped in sleek black fur, while Jack’s body nearly doubled in size as white and black fur sprouted on his body. <br />
<br />
As they leaned in two kiss, their faces pushed out into cat muzzles. Their whiskers tickled each other, but that didn’t bother either much. All of a sudden the only thing that mattered was Jack putting his spiny tiger penis into Kenya’s waiting folds. Jack growled as he bent her back against the couch, and slowly pushed himself in.<br />
<br />
Giving him a approving mew, Jack started moving in and out. Kenya’s mews only got louder, until she too was growling as their bodies got hotter and hotter. Maybe it was the fact that Jack’s cock had the spines, that Kenya suddenly felt this wave of affection for Jack or that he was bigger than Nate, but Kenya found the experience more pleasurable than anything else she’d ever had before. <br />
<br />
“I never want this to end.” she thought. But just as she did, Jack’s cock stopped moving and filled Kenya. <br />
<br />
“Don’t… move…” Jack growled, knowing that his spines were latched into Kenya’s walls, and that if he pulled out too soon, it would cause her pain. In addition to increasing the possibility she got pregnant. And neither party wanted cubs just yet.</p>
