<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Cole is busy looking at the map, Ken hears something call to him. It&#39;s a whisper calling his very name. Ken was about to look for it when Cole snapped him back to reality,<br />
 <br />
&quot;I think I&#39;ll choose a body swap beach for our first day. How about you?&quot; Cole asked.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Ken said. &quot;Did you just hear someone call my name?&quot; Ken looked around then he heard the faint whisper again, &quot;There it goes again.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Are you sure? All I&#39;m hearing is the sound of these people walking around. Good lord, there are so many people on the island. I hope the beach isn&#39;t filled with these bums.&quot; Cole looked at Ken to see that he was still looking for the voice. Ken is the kind of guy that won&#39;t stop unraveling strings until all of his questions are answered. This isn&#39;t the first time that Ken has gotten this intrigued and this surely won&#39;t be his last. Cole knew him well enough that the only cure to his obsessiveness is to see this through the end. &quot;If you finished what you&#39;re looking for, come find me on the beach. I&#39;ll be there turning this pasty skin into a sweet tan. See ya!&quot;<br />
 <br />
Cole hitched a ride with a passing car train, and he&#39;s gone.<br />
 <br />
Ken paid little mind to the fact that his friend just abandoned him. Cole said he&#39;ll be at the beach, and he&#39;ll stay there until he gets his dream tan. Ken knows that it would take days before Cole&#39;s skin turns into a different shade other than red. He&#39;ll be there at the beach for a very long time. In the meantime, that voice grew stronger the moment Cole left. Which meant that Ken can now follow the voice to its whereabouts. Ken walked past crowds of clothed and naked men, into streets and alleyways, and into a secluded area of the island where a dead-end stands.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Ken… Kenneth…&quot; The voice is deep, gurgly like it&#39;s choking on water.<br />
 <br />
Ken looked behind him to see who&#39;s making the voice, but there&#39;s no one there. There&#39;s only an empty alleyway leading back to Midrib Avenue and a grey puddle that must be reflecting the overcast skies. Wait. That can&#39;t be right. Ken looked up and saw that the sky is as blue as it can get. The sky is spotless and the clouds are thin and far in between. Ken looked back on the alleyway then realized the puddle was gone. Suddenly, Ken lurched backward when a wet and slimy thing latched on his face. He tried to scrape it off but his finger merely passed through. He wanted to scream but his voice came out as underwater gurgles. His vision grew ever darker as his brain ran out of oxygen. Within moments, Ken lost his consciousness.<br />
 <br />
In the darkness of his unconscious mind. Ken felt like he was drowning in water. When he rose to the surface, the waves lashed at him and slimy tendrils dragged him down to an untimely watery death.<br />
 <br />
Ken gasped awake, but he realized something is strange with that statement. He awoke but there was no gasp. He tried to breathe but failed when he realized that he lacked the apparatus for respiration. The world around Ken is like an inside-out globe. He could see all around him all at once. Also, he&#39;s permanently on the ground. Not because something is holding him down, but it seems that his current form is reduced to the size of a football.<br />
 <br />
This. This can&#39;t be real. Ken wanted to scream, punch the wall, do anything he could do before. He wanted to do those things and yet, he can&#39;t because he has no human body to do these things. Ken can&#39;t put a word to it but his mind is telling him that he is reduced to the form of a puddle. No. Not a puddle, but more like slime.<br />
 <br />
Ken sensed something shifts behind him. He did not notice it before because he was too busy comprehending his new limiting form. He crawled to where he sensed the vibrations and saw a human figure lying on the ground. As he moved closer, the figure became more and more familiar. And now that he is within inches to the body&#39;s face, that is when Ken realized that the waking figure is his body. In a second, it&#39;s waking up, a smile flashed on his face. Ken knew his smile and it&#39;s not that.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Finally,&quot; Ken&#39;s doppelganger said. &quot;some gullible fool fell for my trap.&quot;<br />
 <br />
The doppelganger crouched and looked at his reflection from Ken&#39;s surface. &quot;This body could use some work but beggars can&#39;t choose. I&#39;m just glad that I have a permanent body to stay in for the rest of my life. So, I&#39;m sorry kid that it&#39;s you I chose. Don&#39;t feel too bad. I lost my body the same way as you did. You&#39;ll forget this body in let&#39;s say… 10 years, give or take.&quot; The doppelganger slipped a hand inside his pants and squeezed his new manhood. He found delight with the fact that it is bigger than what he expected given the lad&#39;s body frame.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I&#39;m not all that bad, kid. Unlike the cunt who stole my body, I&#39;ll explain the capabilities of your new body. As you might already know, you have the body of a slime. But what separates you from the common cum stain is that you can squeeze yourself inside someone&#39;s body - be it be their mouth or up their ass, your choice - and when you do that, you can take control of their body. Getting out of their body is somewhat harder but you&#39;ll learn it with experience. Thinking about pissing through the ass makes it easier for me.<br />
 <br />
I know what you&#39;re thinking. If I could just possess people, why the hell did we swap bodies? The thing is kid, that form cages you on this island. I&#39;ve done it and failed each time. Some forcefield fries you up. While possessing bodies is fun, it could get tiring. And the more time passes, the more I want to see the outside world. So, if you got tired the same way as I did, find a gullible chump from the newcomer&#39;s list.<br />
 <br />
One last thing, you&#39;re not the only slimy cunt on this island. There are tons of them hiding in the dark or some fucker&#39;s mimosa. Befriending them makes the whole slime experience better.&quot;<br />
 <br />
The doppelganger admired his new permanent body once more, sped out of the alley. Ken tried to follow him but human legs are faster than the pseudopodia of his new body. By the time he crawled out of the alley, his body was long gone. To what destination? Ken doesn&#39;t know.<br />
