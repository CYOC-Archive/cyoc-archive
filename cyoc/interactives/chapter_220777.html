<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cael and Alex lay back in a daze for a few blissful minutes, Cael relishing the maddening full feeling of being stuffed with over a foot of orc cock and Alex still basking in the warm afterglow of his first orgasm as a full-blooded orc man. With a deep grunt, Alex began to withdraw his length from Cael’s rear end, earning a quiet moan from the other man until his thick cockhead emerged with a lewd <i>pop</i>. In a fog, Alex grinned as he watched a river of spent cum dribble from the smaller orc-blood’s asshole, a sense of pride at his conquest filling him as he impulsively slapped Cael on the ass and smeared the still-warm orc sperm over Cael’s muscular butt.<br />
<br />
	...Pride? Pride in what? In taking advantage of Cael’s hospitality and obvious attraction to him? As these thoughts began to awaken in Alex’s head, the haze over Alex’s mind began to dissipate and his eyes went wide as he realized just what had happened.<br />
<br />
	“C-Cael, oh my god… I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to-” he said frantically, his meek demeanor at odds with his massive body and commanding voice. “Something just came over me…”<br />
<br />
	“...Huh? What do ‘ya you mean?” Cael replied nonchalantly as he rose to his feet, wincing a bit at the tender soreness he was still feeling in his ass and jaw. “I mean, it’s not like we weren’t both wantin’ to do that ‘fer a while now…”<br />
<br />
	“Well, sure… But this isn’t really the time,” Alex admitted bashfully. “...Are you really feeling okay? We both just started acting so strange…”<br />
<br />
	Cael blinked a couple of times and tilted his head with confusion, gears clearly spinning in his head for a couple moments before he too began to realize just how odd their behavior had been.	<br />
<br />
	“...Damn, ‘yer right. I remember smelling you, and somethin’ in my brain just snapped, and all I could think about was… was…”<br />
<br />
	Cael’s eyes drifted lower over Alex’s transformed body, resting on the truly massive cock and balls that was still half-erect and glistening with cum. With a cock-head nearly as big as a regular human’s fist and thick, throbbing veins running up and down its enormous length, it was truly the epitome of manliness and something that anyone (under normal circumstances at least) would kill to have. Just starting at it was starting to get Cael blushing and panting again, and he had to shake his head to keep himself from losing himself all over again.<br />
<br />
	“L-look, maybe we should just head inside and try to figure this out… Whatever my dumbass little brother found, we’d better figure a way to…” Cael started to say, but he couldn’t bring himself to finish the sentence.<br />
<br />
	“...To reverse it? Is that what you mean?” Alex prompted. Without even realizing it, he found himself flexing his arm and chest muscles, enjoying the feeling of power flowing through him. It was as though this new body was tempting him into giving in to its innate orcish instincts, to give up the absurd notion that he should try to return to his old, puny human self. But if he didn’t find a way to change back, the hopes of ever returning to his original world were quite unlikely.<br />
<br />
	“...Cael, can we go inside? I think I have some explaining to do…”<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
	“So, let me see if I got this straight… ‘Ya got scooped up from another world while ‘ya were sleepin’ and dropped off here, and in ‘yer old world there were just humans instead of all kinda different folks?” Cael said as they sat at the kitchen table. Before coming in, Alex had emptied a few buckets of cold water over his head to wash away as much of his sweaty orc scent as he could, though it was undeniable that a subtle but not necessarily offensive musk still hung around him. “...Well, that doesn’t sound too far-fetched to me, ‘cept for the part about there just bein’ humans. And I still don’t really get what ‘ya mean when ‘ya talk ‘bout ‘women’...”<br />
<br />
	“I promise, it is true. I didn’t mean to hide it, but I figured you’d just think I was crazy… Plus, I was still getting used to the idea of there only being men in this world,” Alex admitted as he sprawled out as best he could across the table from Cael. The furniture in the kitchen was built to support half- and quarter-orc men, so it was rather sturdy albeit still a bit small for his much larger body.<br />
<br />
	“Don’t worry, Alex… I trust ‘ya,” Cael said earnestly, putting his smaller hands upon Alex’s massive ones affectionately. “I just feel… Well, I just feel like a woollie’s asshole ‘fer lettin’ this happen to ‘ya though. Humans are pretty easily affected by transformation magic, and turning back takes a lotta energy…”<br />
<br />
	Cael glanced into a nearby mirror hanging over the nearby wash basin and narrowed his eyes. By now, he’d spotted the changes that had happened to him after he’d had sex with Alex, and he could tell that his quarter of orc blood had been upped to about half, like his pa. The deeper green shade of his skin, the longer tusks… it was like looking at a reflection of his own pa, albeit his pa&#39;s reflection at least 20 years younger. Cael had always had mixed feelings about his orc blood, knowing that there were always folks that would think he was some dumb brute who wasn’t good for much more than heavy lifting or possibly a rough fuck. But he’d grown up hearing his pa’s stories about the old orc kingdoms in the north, where the men were strong, sufficient, and at one with the land. Sure, it was probably mostly made up, but it helped him and his brother take pride in his heritage. Perhaps a bit <i>too</i> much pride, in Roy&#39;s case, but pride nonetheless.<br />
<br />
	“I think, if we <i>want</i> to help you turn back...” Cael said, putting a rather questionable emphasis on ‘want’ that didn’t escape Alex’s notice. “If we did, hypthetically, we’d want to find out where Roy got that amulet in the first place. Probably some druid or sorcerer that knows a thing or two about enchanting. Someone like that should stand out around here, so it shouldn’t be too hard to track him down.”<br />
<br />
	“...Hey, Cael? I was just thinking… If Roy had that thing and wanted to use it… Why didn’t he?” Alex said thoughtfully. “I mean, if all he really wanted to be a full-blood orc, he’d have used it as soon as he could instead of leaving it in his pocket, right?”<br />
<br />
	Cael tried to think of a reason, but he came up empty. He knew his little brother well enough, and what Alex said had a ring of truth to it. And the only thing that he could think of was that Roy had wanted to use it, but…<br />
<br />
	“...But something happened to him first. Damn it, I knew he was takin’ forever runnin’ that errand,” Cael growled, pushing away from the table and sending his chair flying back as he ran to the other end of the farmhouse as quick as he could. Alex was right behind him, his heavy footsteps shaking the floor. Cael had gone into a bedroom, with two massive beds against the walls, sweaty work-clothes hung up in the window to air out, and an assortment of totems and carved figures laid out on a small bedside table. “Roy’s stuff,” Cael quickly explained as he looked over the items on the table with a keen eye, trying to find any clue about where his little brother could be. “Got ‘em from a traveling merchant who said he’d bought ‘em from the orc tribes…”<br />
<br />
	After a moment of searching, Cael finally spotted a crumpled up piece of paper stuffed between the table and the wall. Snatching it up, he quickly scanned it, his eyes narrowing and his face twisting into a grimace of barely-suppressed fury.<br />
<br />
	“...Get dressed, Alex. We’re going to Dicktin,” Cael snarled, throwing the note to the floor and storming out while muttering curses under his breath. Alex knelt down and picked up the note, which was dwarfed in his huge hands as he read the short note.<br />
<br />
	<i>‘You still owe a payment. The curse on the item stays until entire price is paid. Dicktin Market, <b>NOW</b>. Or else.       All the best, W’</i></p>
