<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">What Jake couldn't know was that the products on the shelves of the sex shop were in actuality people; people who wanted a second chance at life.<br />
<br />
Most were prisoners or other people who had felt they failed in some way.  For people whose attributes would be a welcome change for another customer, this was a chance to start over.  Death row inmates or terminally ill patients or people who felt they just didn't get a fair shake in life were prime candidates.  They willingly signed themselves over to be converted into products to be used by another.  The customer would take on their attributes, of course.  However, as part of the deal, their personalities and some old and new memories would merge into the customer’s own.  They could re-live their lives and perhaps redeem their failures.<br />
<br />
Once changed by the products, the customer would be thought of as always having been that way.  Clothes and other changes such as sexuality and living conditions would match the new life.  In essence, it would combine the two lives into one seamless continuum.<br />
<br />
The condom Jake had picked up used to be an ex-pro football player named Ralph Hanson.  Ralph was a huge hairy, well hung, bearish straight man with everything going for him, but who'd also been somewhat of a fuck up outside of his football career.  He'd got drunk one night after a fight with his wife, got in his expensive custom sports car and run over a young mother and child in a crosswalk, killing them and thus earning him a seat on death row.  <br />
<br />
He was truly repentant, hated himself for having done it but that didn’t matter to the jury or the judge.  With his in the toilet he sincerely wished he could just have a do-over.  Six months before his scheduled execution, after he'd exhausted all of his appeals, the owners of the sex shop had approached him a deal.  The warden, getting a kick back of course, had cleared the deal.  No one would be the wiser that Ralph hadn't died by lethal injection.  Ralph knew that he would cease to be, mostly, but that he as a condom would merge into another man and become one with him and so live again.  He’d pass on his 'gifts' and get his 'do over'.<br />
<br />
The lube Jake had picked up used to be a hardcore cigar/leather/S&amp;M fetishist.  Michael Lawrence or 'Master Mike' was a regular at the Eagle in LA.  He would arrive on a Friday night on his custom Harley decked out in full biker leathers and leave in the wee hours of Saturday morning, usually with some young cub on the back of his Hawg ready to be willingly punished for whatever minor crime of which Master Mike had accused him.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Master Mike was diagnosed with liver cancer in the bloom of his life.  At thirty-nine, he was given a month to live.  The sex shop owners approached him too, assuring him that though he could not be cured; he could escape death and live on, merged with another.  Master Mike chose to be distilled down into a small bottle of leather scented, smoke flavored lube.<br />
<br />
The process required the customer to combine himself; his seed, his blood, his skin or some other part of his essence, with the product.<br />
<br />
Jake walked into the Change Room with both Ralph and Master Mike.  The change room was odd; it was like a hotel room. There was a freshly made bed, a shower and a small closet.  There was a full sized mirror against the wall opposite of the bed.  Jake supposed it was there so customers could watch themselves as they used the products.  A sign on the closet door read, &quot;Remove clothing.  Hang clothing in the closet while using product&quot;. <br />
<br />
Jake thought it somewhat odd; couldn’t you just throw your clothes on the floor or over the chair?  Still he obediently did as the sign had directed him and placed his jeans, sneakers and t-shirt neatly on the provided hangers and shoe rack.<br />
<br />
He then turned his attention to the condom and lube.<br />
<br />
He opened the bottle and took a sniff.  The scent of warm new leather and expensive cigar filled his nose and his cock gave a twitch.  Jake was straight, but the scent filled his mind with an image of some hairy, cigar smoking, leather bound guy getting his ass paddled.  The thought, was mildly disturbing, but oddly it was only mildly disturbing to him.<br />
<br />
Master Mike, taken directly into the core of Jake's brain through the primal sense of smell, calmed his fears and convinced him to continue with the process that would transform him.<br />
<br />
Jake squirted out a portion of the lube on his right palm and rubbed in on his stiffening cock.  And urge overtook him and he began squirting more of the lube on his genitals, rubbing it all over his cock and balls, then his chest and belly, emptying the bottle completely, rubbing it all over himself.  Jake felt a warm tingle all over his lube coated body.  He put his lube coated fingers to his lips and tasted cigar smoke, which filled him with lust and the want for a stogie to be clamped in his jaw as he jacked.<br />
<br />
Tossing the empty bottle aside, he tore open the condom wrapper and immediately rolled it onto his stiff six inch cock.<br />
<br />
Now, Ralph was awakened: Ralph liked the feel of Jake’s young body.  His youthful virility, his under-developed masculinity would soon bloom in full with Ralph's merging.  But Ralph sensed something; dualities which he didn’t understand and only as he was mostly merged with Jake did he become fully aware of the truth.  There were TWO personalities and now Ralph was the THIRD!<br />
<br />
He and the other were fully merging into Jake's mind, blending and becoming one with the young man.  If Jake shot his load in the condom, the process would be complete and Master Mike and Football Jock Ralph would both harmoniously become the new man Jake was to be!<br />
<br />
Jake, prompted by Mike had an urge to lie down and masturbate.  Ralph, not wanting to become homosexual and not nearly as dominant a personality as Master Mike tried to fight the urge.  Mike, sensing the gifts Ralph would bring to the transformation encouraged Jake to continue.<br />
<br />
Jake, unaware of the personalities at war within him, was simply conflicted and didn't know why. He really wanted to lie down and rub one out into the condom, but at the same time he wanted to tear it off, dress and leave the room.  He stood for five minutes, vacillating between the two impulses.  Twice he'd almost reached the closet door.  Ralph fought for control of Jake's mind but Mike; having been merged with Jake first, and having dominated men most of his adult life, had an advantage.<br />
<br />
Finally a clear voice spoke in Jake’s head. &quot;If you rub one out, it'll make your cock and balls bigger, I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
The image of Ralph's oversized package attached to Jake's groin flashed through his mind and his average sized cock burned with need for release.  Jake, thrilled at the prospect of becoming that monstrously well hung, threw himself on the bed.<br />
<br />
Being young and virile, it didn't take him long despite the other in his head trying to fill him with thoughts that would turn him off.  Carrion animals feeding on rotting flesh, maggots, unattractive people ravaged by disfiguring disease; all images Ralph tried to project to turn the young man off seemed to fade as Master Mike wrestled for control of Jake’s libido.<br />
<br />
With a whine Jake shot into the condom.<br />
<br />
There wasn't much of a load at first as Ralph had tried to close off urethra so Jake couldn't cum, but as soon as the first of the hot, fresh seed hit the inside of the latex sheath, Ralph lost what little control he had.<br />
<br />
The condom was then flooded as Jake unloaded completely into it.  Jake growled in pleasure, his voice immediately dropping an octave and a half.  His cum combined with the leather-smoke scented lube that was Master Mike.  It also combined with the latex sheath and both Ralph and Mike became fully integrated into Jake, who would now forever be known as Ralph Jacob &quot;Jake&quot; Michaelson.<br />
<br />
There was a moment when everything was still.  Jake lie there in the afterglow of orgasm, his heavy breathing halted.  He looked in the mirror and for the last time saw his old, underdeveloped self.  <br />
<br />
Then, the transformation began:<br />
<br />
The lube was immediately and completely absorbed into Jake's skin.  The condom changed texture, grew warm and fleshy and began to lengthen as it absorbed into the flesh of Jake's organ.<br />
<br />
Jake’s balls and cock began to inflate as memories of being the secretly queer jock in high school trickled into his mind.  His balls and cock had started growing alarmingly larger around twelve or so and he'd been taken to the doctor by a panicked mother and a very proud father to see if it was all normal.<br />
<br />
The huge amounts of testosterone that coursed through his body had ignited the growth of fur all over and by fourteen guys in the locker-room were calling him names like 'Bear' and 'Ape'; names that were not discouraged by the growth of his muscular frame as he excelled athletically on the weightlifting, football and wrestling teams.  <br />
<br />
Jake was vaguely aware of watching his fully erect monster being gripped and stroked by what was becoming a huge, paw-like left hand.  Dazed by new memories, he watched as padded muscle exploded all over his growing body.  Legs and spine stretched him into huge proportion, slowing as his height reached over six feet.  Because Jake was a line backer, not some trim gym bunny, his gut bulged into taught roundness; a weightlifter's gut!  Thick dark hair spread swiftly over huge pecs and rounded belly connecting with fur on his back and butt.  His enormous thighs and meaty arms were similarly coated down to the tops of his furry feet and hands, his face sprouted a heavy, full beard that connected down his neck to his chest and around the back to his back.  Tattoos crawled down his arms and across his chest and back, not that they were clearly seen under all the fur.<br />
<br />
Jake had become a prime, handsome bear!<br />
<br />
Another memory flooded his vision as the beast continued to stroke while looking at his changing form.  He was reliving the first time he dominated another man.  He was a senior in college and his roommate, also on the football team, came out to him.  Jake, already attracted to the guy from their time in the showers after games, pulled him into a deep kiss.  The fun continued as he tied Greg to his bed, gagged the smaller man and made him beg Jake to be fucked.  He'd bred Greg three times in one evening, bruising him all over as he did so; then they slept together.  They continued to sleep in Jake’s bed for the rest of their college careers.  His roomie became his partner and now, even though they played on rival teams and lived in separate states, maintained their relationship; Master Bear Jake and his Cub, Greg, though they couldn’t be public about it.<br />
<br />
Jake now masturbating furiously, looking at his excessively hot body shot again, coating himself in cum.  The pro-football star, growled deeply in pleasure, rubbed his seed into his furry chest and belly, and drifted off.<br />
<br />
After a short nap, Jake awoke and took a shower to freshen up.  Toweling off he went to the closet; he pulled out his leather biker vest, his worn jeans, his engineer boots and his black Harley t-shirt.  He dressed and pulled a cigar out of the vest, reaching for a lighter in the pocked he looked up and noticed the 'no smoking' sign.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck!&quot; he growled, &quot;Almost forgot!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was time to leave; Greg would be meeting him soon.<br />
<br />
Life was good!</p>
