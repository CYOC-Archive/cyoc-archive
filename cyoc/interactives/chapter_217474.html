<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Noah got his package in the mail, and opened it excitingly. <br />
<br />
He had seen this strange coin on eBay that was said to be magic and decided to buy it just in case it might actually be real. After all, what was $15 if it actually worked! <br />
<br />
Before he could open the coin and try it out he realized it was almost time for school and he was about to be late if he didn’t hurry and get to the bus!<br />
<br />
The 16-year-old arrived at school and raced to his first class of the day. The day races by and he hadn’t gotten a chance to use the coin or even read the directions but he was hoping that could change in his final class, Math. Noah leans down and rummages through his back pack until he finds the coin, he hides it under his desk and and tries to get the instructions out. <br />
<br />
Noah was so busy trying to figure out what the instructions said, that he didn’t notice his teacher, Mr. Croston approach his desk until it is to late.<br />
<br />
“Mr. Lutson,” Mr. Croston says, causing Noah to jump in surprise, “I assume the class is boring to you?” Mr. Croston is a big 6 feet tall guy, he also looks pretty intimidating since he goes to the Gym and works out regularly. He has gray, almost brown, hair, ice-blue eyes and a light brown skin tone. His voice is deep and gruff and he always wears a mean, or at least an angry expression on his face, all in all, Mr. Croston is one scary bad-ass dude.<br />
<br />
“Um...,” is all Noah can say, still taken aback by his teacher&#39;s silent approach. <br />
<br />
Mr. Croston holds out his hand, “hand me your that box that you seem more interested in that my class,” he says sternly.<br />
<br />
“I... I am not” Noah says. He gulps, turning red when the other students start to stare. <br />
<br />
“Now. Hand. Me. The. Box.” he then says with a growl in his voice.<br />
<br />
Noah lets out a sigh, “f-fine,” he says and hands his box over. <br />
<br />
“Thank you,” the teacher says as he takes the box. “you may get it back after class,” with that Mr. Croston turns and walks back to the front of the class and puts Noah’s box containing the ring in one of the drawers of his desk. He the turns back to the class, “now that we have settled that matter,” he says, “I&#39;d appreciate no more interruptions.”<br />
<br />
&#39;Shit,&#39; Noah thinks to himself, &#39;I shouldn&#39;t have had that out. Now I have to wait until after class to get my phone back.&#39; Noah scowls, then his eyes suddenly widen, &#39;SHIT, What if Mr. Croston or the principle decide to “check” the box and make a wish? I got to get it back... I hope Mr. Croston will let me talk to him.&#39;<br />
<br />
After class, Noah decided to press his luck by asking for his box back. <br />
<br />
“May I have my box back now?”<br />
<br />
“You mean this one?” Mr. Croston pulled the box out from his drawer. “Let’s see what was so much more important than todays lesson.”<br />
<br />
He opened the box and pulls out the coin within it. <br />
<br />
“A coin? Really?”<br />
<br />
“Uhm it’s a special coin that I just got.”<br />
<br />
Mr. Croston began reading the instructions inside out loud. “Wish with for what your heart desires and it shall be. Is this some kind of joke?”<br />
<br />
“No it’s supposed to be real magic!” Noah said defensively.<br />
<br />
“Magic isn’t real and I’ll prove it. I wish I was younger,” Mr. Croston said. <br />
<br />
“ Noah gasped, held his breath and stared at Mr. Croston, but for a few seconds, nothing seemed to happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;See? I told you that magic wasn&#39;t real, now here, I&#39;ll do you a favor and take this coin and scratch away its gold foil--oh... ow!&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as Mr. Croston uttered the words, Noah felt his heart stop. He stared at the man, waiting to see if anything would happen. But for a few moments, everything was silent. The air in the room grew tense as Noah held his breath, hoping that the coin was really magical.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a strange feeling washed over Justin Croston. It started in his head, a slight dizziness that quickly spread through his entire body. He tried to fight it, to hold on to his adult body, but it was no use. Justin let out a grunt as he felt his muscles starting to shrink. His shoulders began to droop, his chest deflating, and his biceps and abs disappearing one by one.<br />
<br />
Noah watched in awe as Justin&#39;s transformation progressed. The once-hulking man was now slowly turning into a boy younger than Noah himself. He could see the man&#39;s muscles shrinking in real-time, and it was fascinating. Justin tried to resist the changes, but it was as if he was being sucked into a vortex of youth, pulling him back into his past.<br />
<br />
With each passing moment, Justin&#39;s body grew smaller and more boyish. His once tight-fitting clothes started to sag and hang loose as his muscles shrank, and his skin grew tighter around his frame. The veins that had once bulged on his arms now disappeared, leaving his skin smooth and youthful.<br />
<br />
Justin was shocked and confused as he watched his own transformation, and he couldn&#39;t help but scream out in pain as his muscles continued to shrink. &quot;What&#39;s happening to me?!&quot; he yelled out to Noah.<br />
<br />
Noah, still in shock himself, replied, &quot;I think the coin is really magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the transformation continued, Justin&#39;s face began to change as well. His wrinkles smoothed out, and his gray hair turned back into a deep black color. He looked down at his hands and was shocked to see that they were small and smooth, like those of a child.<br />
<br />
Finally, the transformation was complete. Justin Croston was now a boy of about 10 years old, his oversized clothes hanging off his shrunken body. He looked up at Noah with wide eyes, still in shock. &quot;What happened to me? How did this happen?&quot; he asked, his voice now high-pitched and squeaky.<br />
<br />
Noah picked up the coin that Justin had dropped during his transformation and replied, &quot;I think you made a wish on this coin, and it came true.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin looked down at the coin and then back up at Noah. &quot;Can I have it back? I need to turn back into my normal self!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Noah said, shaking his head. &quot;I have another idea.” <br />
<br />
As Justin was reeling from his transformation, Noah seized the opportunity to take back the coin. He saw the shock on his teacher&#39;s face, and he knew that he couldn&#39;t waste any time. &quot;Give me the coin,&quot; he demanded.<br />
<br />
Noah grinned, a mischievous glint in his eye. &quot;I&#39;m going to make a wish,&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
Justin looked skeptical. &quot;And what are you going to wish for?&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah looked at Justin with a smirk on his face, &quot;You know, Mr. Croston, if this coin can make you younger, it can make me stronger and older.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin&#39;s eyes widened in surprise, &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah took off his shirt, revealing a small build with nearly no muscle mass. Justin raised an eyebrow, confused by the sudden display.  Noah held the coin in his hand and closed his eyes. <br />
<br />
At first, nothing seemed to happen. But then, slowly, Noah felt his body start to change. He felt a warmth spreading through his veins, and he knew that the wish was starting to come true. Suddenly, Noah&#39;s muscles started to grow. His shoulders broadened, his chest expanded, and his biceps bulged.<br />
<br />
Justin&#39;s mouth hung open in amazement as he watched the transformation. Noah&#39;s abs became more defined, and his legs grew thicker. He could see the veins in Noah&#39;s arms and chest popping out.<br />
<br />
Noah grunted as his muscles continued to grow, his body becoming more muscular and toned by the second. He could feel the power surging through his body, and he felt more alive than ever before.<br />
<br />
Justin was speechless, not believing what he was seeing. He had always thought that magic was just a myth, but here was proof that it existed. He watched as Noah&#39;s muscles grew larger and more defined, his body transforming into that of a muscular adult.<br />
<br />
Finally, the transformation stopped, and Noah opened his eyes. He looked down at his body in amazement, admiring the massive muscles that now covered it. He was no longer a scrawny teenager, but a powerful and muscular man.<br />
 &quot;And now, I have another idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin looked at Noah suspiciously. &quot;What is it?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Noah couldn&#39;t believe the difference in size between him and Justin. He towered over his friend, looking down at him with a mixture of amusement and awe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, I can&#39;t believe how big I&#39;ve gotten,&quot; Noah said, flexing his muscles and grinning.<br />
<br />
Justin looked up at him with a mix of envy and concern. &quot;I don&#39;t know if this is such a good idea. You look like a bodybuilder, and I look like a child.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah chuckled as he looked at Justin in his now-too-big clothes. &quot;Wow, Mr. Croston, you really did get younger,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Justin crossed his arms, looking a bit uncomfortable in the ill-fitting clothes. &quot;I still can&#39;t believe what just happened,&quot; he muttered.<br />
<br />
Noah grinned, feeling the weight of his new muscles as he flexed his biceps. &quot;Well, believe it or not, we just witnessed magic,&quot; he said. &quot;And now, I want to compare our muscles.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin looked at him skeptically. &quot;I don&#39;t know about that, Noah. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really necessary...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, come on,&quot; Noah said, a playful tone in his voice. &quot;You used to be the bigger one, Mr. Croston. But now, it&#39;s my turn to show off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin sighed, realizing he couldn&#39;t really say no. &quot;Okay, fine,&quot; he said. &quot;But let&#39;s make it quick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah nodded, and the two of them stood facing each other. Noah flexed his biceps again, and Justin couldn&#39;t help but notice how much larger they were than his own. &quot;Wow, Noah,&quot; he said, shaking his head. &quot;You really did get stronger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin hesitated for a moment before lifting his arms in a feeble attempt at a flex. His biceps barely bulged, and Noah couldn&#39;t help but laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like I win, Mr. Croston,&quot; he said, flexing again.<br />
<br />
Noah picked up Justin with ease and hoisted him over his shoulder, laughing as Justin squirmed and protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Put me down!&quot; Justin yelled, but Noah just laughed and carried him around the room like a sack of potatoes.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes of playfully tormenting Justin, Noah finally set him back down on the ground.<br />
<br />
Noah couldn&#39;t help but smirk as he looked down at his new, muscular body. He felt like a different person now, and he knew that things between him and Justin would never be the same. He turned to his friend, who was still staring at him in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Justin,&quot; Noah said, his voice deep and confident. &quot;I think it&#39;s time we switched clothes, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin looked down at his own skinny frame and then back up at Noah&#39;s massive muscles. He hesitated for a moment before nodding in agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, why not?&quot; he said, trying to hide the nervousness in his voice.<br />
<br />
Noah quickly stripped off his clothes, revealing a pair of tight boxers that barely contained his bulging muscles. Justin couldn&#39;t help but stare in awe as Noah&#39;s huge biceps flexed with every movement.<br />
<br />
As Justin took off his own clothes, he couldn&#39;t help but feel self-conscious about his own small frame. He had always been thin, but now he felt like a stick figure compared to Noah&#39;s massive muscles.<br />
<br />
Once they were both down to their boxers, Noah couldn&#39;t resist commenting on the difference in their sizes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like I got a little bigger, huh?&quot; he said, smirking at Justin.<br />
<br />
Justin tried to hide his embarrassment as he looked down at his own small arms and skinny legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess you did,&quot; he said, trying to sound nonchalant.<br />
<br />
Noah laughed, his deep voice rumbling through the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, man,&quot; he said, clapping Justin on the shoulder. &quot;You&#39;ll catch up to me someday.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin nodded, feeling a sense of both admiration and envy for his friend&#39;s new body.<br />
<br />
As they exchanged clothes, Noah couldn&#39;t help but marvel at how small Justin&#39;s old clothes were on him now. He had always been the skinny one in their group, but now he felt like a giant compared to his friend.<br />
<br />
Once they were dressed, they stood in front of the mirror, admiring their new appearances.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look pretty good in my clothes,&quot; Noah said, grinning at Justin.</p>
