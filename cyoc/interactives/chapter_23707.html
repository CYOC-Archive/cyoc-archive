<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Years later, we have had no word from the aliens, but their word spread far and fast immediately. It was a bloody and terrible change, but the world did succeed in pacifying its differences. Without disrupting the entire government, country differences were leveled. After 6 years even currency was an almost moot point, still existed in some communities, but with endless resources to come, why would we need pay? Soon we will all have just what we need and want. The governments remained intact, regulating their respective areas, but the power remained the same. Crime rates took a plunge as more and more citizens took up the belief that this will come to be. Yet, no progress had been made on the world wide unification between the humans and animals. Construction and nature destruction had been minimalized successfully, the navy of the world cracking down on  the pirates and hunters of the endangered species. Who know if maybe our endangered animals carried the cure to some alien disease? Of course, not all of the animals were saved, lifestock served a purposei n human functionality, and the aliens had made it clear though Unification was required the food chain wasn't to be broken. But animal right laws flourished. But, the story is disgressing, the problem was, we still didn't achieve consolidation between animals and humans. The British attempted a very ambitious program to try and translate between the animals and humans, but this was doomed to failure. Russia had a very good program, that yielded minimal results, simply training the animals to respond to more and more complex actions, even having a dog they were almost sure was communicating. But it too wasn't enough. No one felt enlightened. <br />
<br />
Then suddenly, something major happened. Far across the world, humans developed a rapid disease. For the first 2 days, it was like sudden food poisoning, on a massive scale but with no disruptive effects to the body save massive discomfort. It was but maybe five percent of the population, but still enough to cause a huge panic. A pandemic was sweeping the world, no connection could be traced except something had tainted the food supplies on a massive scale. One of the most publicized infections was the president of the united states. His condition had it's own website and channel, with both monitors on his life and a subsequent study of the sudden unknown disease. After the two days had passed, the true nature of the condition surfaced. On the third day, every patient seemed to flatline, causing more terror in hospitals globally. But the flatline was inconsequential, because it immediately restarted the body without any need for medical intervention (though in a few zealous cases medical teams reaction caused more problems). <br />
<br />
Then the amazing thing happened. Slowly, the bodies of each of the patients began a molecular rearrangement. Nothing minor, this was nothing short of incredible. DNA in the body breaking down and reconfiguring with the new chemicals the body began to produce for itself. From here, the DNA became similar to a tumor, attacking healthy cells but almost with a sentience of it's own, the victims never seemed to grow sick or weak, new body cells replacing the old. As in the case of the president, his body paled and thinned, though his bones were weakening the doctors were concerned. However, within 3 days the changes ceased. On the first day it was all inner body changes, all the organs retrofitting themselves to a humanesque likeness. It was ocreatures of ne of the more painful moments, and a few dangerous ones as organs conflicted. In the case of the president his entire body adopted an avian-human mix. Second was the mental changes, before any real physical notices appeared the patients all seemed to undergo their own mental changes, their minds fully remembering their past life, but new insticts, actions, subconscious thoughts showing themselves, as psychologists around the world had a field day. Within the 24 hours, it was concluded they all were adapting animal instincts with human emotion and knowledge, creating whole new fields of psychology, which they affectionately called Transmology. For the president, his eyes became much more focused, as even though his biological eyesight didn't improve, his perceptiveness and bording a precognition seemed to reach inhuman peaks. Inhuman is closer to the fact then any other word could describe, for on the third day, the physical changes happened at a very rapid pace. Over the course of the day, many psychologists were verified as the subjects began to grow body parts cooperative with their instincts and such from the previous day. All of them became anthromorphic creatures of various different animals, from dogs and cats, to insects, sharks, and birds. In the president's case, his transformation became apparent. His infection was that of a Bald Eagle, quickly growing wings of his own on his hollow structure, feathers and a bird head contouring to his body, as well as a renewed youth and a body fitter then he had in his youth. His hands remained on his wings, the disease was almost designed to leave human actions almost totally available to the &quot;Meta's&quot; as they were deemed. On the seventh day it became clear this disease wasn't going to kill anyone, as the Meta's all began to get up and about, exploring their new bodies and testing their new limits, relaxing in the change. All of them seemed pleased with the outcome. The president released an offical statement, a speech he hadn't prepared nor had written or prompted, all about the disease and how he felt upon it. The questions lasted for ages in the media room, going to the wee hours of the morning.<br />
<br />
But one question remained unanswered that day. We all wondered it, said it, debated it. How did this happen?</p>
