<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Indeed his transformation had progressed. His head was no longer human, the protruding snout and fur were that of a donkey. The fur covered the rest of his body except his hands, which though still human seemed darker in color. What was truly unbelievable was the size of his now gargantuan penis. It was at least eighteen inches long, dark brown in color, and sprang from a large furry sheath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baby!&quot; I shouted, &quot;what did they do with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
He jumped in surprise; he hadn&#39;t even heard me come in. He looked up at me with such large pleading eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sweetheart, I couldn&#39;t help it. I kept changing, and when my cock changed... I&#39;m so turned on. Honey, you gotta let me fuck you. I&#39;m so fucking horny you don&#39;t even know, please, please you&#39;ve got to let me fuck you&quot;<br />
<br />
He almost started crying in frustration, his cock bobbing about stiffly in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tayler, there&#39;s no time. We&#39;ve got to get outta here. They&#39;ve turned all into donkeys, too...&quot;<br />
<br />
He cut me off as he nearly leapt over in front of me and dropped to his knees. He grabbed at my blouse, as he pleaded, &quot;No, I can&#39;t go. You&#39;ve got to help me. Come on, I can smell how aroused you are, you want it, too!&quot;<br />
<br />
He started to grope at my crotch. My resolve and determination to leave melted away as I gazed down at him and his monstrous cock, which was glistening with clear pre-cum.<br />
<br />
I knelt down placing my hands on either side of the long muzzle that was now his face, looking deep into his large passionate eyes. Somehow I found myself even more attracted o him as he was now. I leaned in closeand this time he didn&#39;t back away as I kissed him full on his mouth. I didn&#39;t fight it as his longer thicker tongue began to push in and probe my mouth. I pulled back, short of breath, his tongue giving me a final brush on the cheek before I stood up again.<br />
<br />
I started to literally rip the rest of my clothes off, tossing the red overcoat and hat onto the pool table, and my blouse, jeans, bra and panties in the floor. I dropped down on my hands and knees, my tail swishing from side to side, as Tayler moved around behind me.<br />
<br />
He lifted my tail up out of the way and placed the warm pulsing tip of his massive rod against my pink vagina. I bit down on my lip as he started slowly pushing in. I expected the pain to be much more severe from accepting such a large organ in my petite hole, but the pain quickly dulled leaving only pleasure as he plunged deeper and deeper into my pussy.<br />
<br />
I felt the tickle of his fuzzy sheath against my butt and sighed with delight as I felt the coarse fur of his chest and abs against the skin of my bare back. Tayler started thrusting in and out, we rocked together locked in a sensual embrace of lust and love. I felt full and complete with his long thick length throbbing from with in me. I maneuvered my tail around and intertwined it with Tayler&#39;s.<br />
<br />
As he increased in speed and force, something amazing started to happen. I lowered my head and tried to look underneath myself, at first all I saw was Tayler&#39;s legs, our tails swinging about behind the both of us. Then I noticed that my pucker was starting to swell, my clitty grew larger and larger and the now familiar brown fur started sprouting.<br />
<br />
My face didn&#39;t feel any different but I could tell my hair was shorter and formed a mane trailing down onto my back. The fur also seemed to stop at my wrists although my hands had changed to black in color.<br />
<br />
Tayler persistently pounded away in my ass and I felt a surge of arousal radiating from my modified pussy that began to migrate upwards between my butt cheeks. Her tight pink flower lasted only a moment longer as her lips began to thicken, taking on a deep leathery black color of their own. <br />
<br />
By now my ass was feeling a little numb. Tayler&#39;s hands quivered on my back as he reached his climax.<br />
<br />
Tayler collapsed onto my back and I happily supported his weight, and his hot breath rushing over my neck. But before he could make a move to withdraw, he started braying again, I watched as his hands uncontrollably contorted into fists, began to turn a glossy black, and became a second set of hooves.<br />
<br />
He backed up, slowly pulling out of my womb. I rolled over onto my back and looked up at him. He had nothing left that was human, only a donkey was left. He trotted over to the mirror, stumbling a bit as he grew accustomed to walking with four legs.<br />
<br />
He barely held back sobbing, &quot; Oh... what am I gonna do? This can&#39;t be happening...&quot;<br />
<br />
Standing up I walked over to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tayler, we&#39;ve got to get away from this place. From what I heard it&#39;ll wear off. I think this stamp causes it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I showed him the partial stamp still visible on the back of my now black hand. I took a look at myself in the mirror and had to laugh. Except for my hands and face I was completely covered in brownish gray fur. My hands were a dark black, almost matching the long mane running down between my shoulder blades. My tail was still flicking about behind me, and of course there was the black and large pucker now located between my butt cheeks.<br />
<br />
I walked over to the pool table and picked up the red coat I had stolen, I went to put it on when I felt something in one of the pockets. Reaching in, I pulled out a stamp pad and one of the rubber Pleasure Island stamps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, look at this...&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then we both heard a group of people outside, our large ears perking up instantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two, check in there, we&#39;ll check the pool hall.&quot;<br />
<br />
I stuffed the stamp back in my pocket, &quot; Come on Tayler let&#39;s get out of here!&quot;<br />
<br />
I started to make for the back door when Tayler trotted up, &quot; Hey, get on, I can probably run faster than you can.&quot;<br />
<br />
I climbed up onto his back, straddling him, fortunately the fear of being caught overrode the eroticism of the situation. Tayler started off at a quick gallop, sliding only slightly on the hard floors. We breezed out he rear entrance just as a pair of men strode into the hall from the front.<br />
<br />
&quot;Head for the front gate,&quot; I shouted as I put my arms around his long neck to hold on.<br />
<br />
In no time made to the immense steel gates at the front of the park, they were locked of course but I doubted we could have opened them even if they weren&#39;t. However, it only took a few minutes of searching to find a smaller door nearby. I jumped off Tayler&#39;s back as he turned then reared up and kicked the door open.<br />
<br />
This led us out onto the docks. The main ferry was nowhere in sight but a small motorboat was tied up dockside. Though he almost fell, threatening to capsize the small craft; Tayler finally got his large frame situated somewhat comfortably in the boat. A quick pull of the cord and the motor started. The noise attracted the attention of some of the park employees who must have been just inside the gate, but all they could do is shout helplessly as we sped away into the fog.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s been a couple of days since we escaped from Pleasure Island. We managed to find a small abandoned shack on the beach to stay in while our bodies returned to normal. Tayler is finally standing upright again and if I conceal the tail, ears, and huge penis, I can go out in public again.<br />
<br />
The only reason I can figure I didn&#39;t change all the way is because of the incomplete stamp I was given. Tayler is still horny as hell and we find ourselves having sex several times a day. He says that when he gets all the way back to normal he wants to play a little with the stamp to see if he can get and keep the huge cock.</p>
