<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty decided he wanted to see what would happen if he made all the different ingredients cause different changes.<br />
<br />
He wished he had a pen, and one appeared in his pocket. He used it to write down some ideas on a napkin, crossing out a few of them and correcting them until he was satisfied. All the while, he ate his second sandwich. Then, he checked over his final list:<br />
<br />
<i>Food transformations:<br />
<br />
Chicken / turkey - lose weight<br />
Bacon - gain weight<br />
Ham - grow muscle<br />
Beef - grow a lot of muscle<br />
Cheese / milk - grow taller<br />
Salami / pepperoni - shrink shorter<br />
Tuna - grow(?) younger<br />
Onions - grow size of hands and feet<br />
Green veggies - grow more attractive<br />
Tomatoes - increased sexual characteristics</i><br />
<br />
He knew there were other ingredients and sides he could include, but he felt that this list would be good enough for some interesting transformations.<br />
<br />
He whispered, &quot;I wish that the ingredients they serve in this restaurant, and only this one, would cause these transformations in people. There can be a bit of a delay before the changes start. The changes should happen slowly. The more of any ingredient a person eats, the more they will be effected.&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked around the sub shop, feeling excited to see what changes would happen.<br />
<br />
His attention turned to a mother, who led her two children to a seat at the table next to him. Her son looked to be about 11 years old. Her daughter appeared to be 8 years old. She seemed to be in her mid thirties.<br />
<br />
Ty wished that other people would ignore him looking at them for a little while.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so hungry,&quot; the boy said. &quot;I could eat a whole pig.&quot; He unrolled a small ham sub with green veggies, onions, and tomatoes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; his little sister said, unrolling her own chicken sub with the same toppings.<br />
<br />
The mother unrolled her sub, a larger tuna sandwich with green veggies and tomatoes. &quot;Don&#39;t eat too fast, and chew your food,&quot; she said. &quot;Or, no desert tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy took a bite of his ham sandwich and then took a sip from some apple juice. His sister ate some of her chicken sandwich and took a big sip of her milk.<br />
<br />
Ty watched closely for their changes. The first thing he noticed were the boy&#39;s changes. The 11 year old had begun to grow some muscle. It was subtle at first, but soon the boy looked to be a young gymnast in a tight T-shirt, holding his sub in a pair of thick hands.<br />
<br />
The next changes Ty noticed were with the little girl, who was rapidly becoming less little with every sip of her milk. As she surpassed her brother&#39;s height, Ty noticed there was a faint curve forming at her hips and her chest. Her bare belly was exposed more and more by her lengthening upper body. Otherwise, she was rail thin and still had the innocent face of a young girl. Though, each of the children&#39;s faces seemed prettier in some subtle way.<br />
<br />
The mother&#39;s changes were visible only after she had finished half her sub. Her breasts had swollen much larger, but overall, she seemed to be getting smaller. She was now as attractive as a model, but she seemed to be more of a sexy young woman now, instead of a mature mother of two.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; the boy said. &quot;My shorts feel really tight, so does my shirt. And, my shoes are killing me.&quot; He popped his shoes off of his growing feet and looked over at his sister. &quot;Whoa,&quot; he said. &quot;Are you sitting on something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A chair,&quot; she replied with heavy sarcasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; he said. &quot;I mean, look at yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked down at him. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; she said and gasped when she realized how tall she had become. She looked down at her stick like arms and her growing breasts and cried, &quot;Mom, what&#39;s happening to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Both kids gasped when they saw the teenage girl sitting across from them where their mother had been sitting. She was beautiful and sexy looking, but she was much too young now to be their mother. Still, despite all of her changes, they recognized her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom!&quot; the boy said. &quot;What happened to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; she said as she chewed. Even her voice sounded younger, practically childlike.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at yourself,&quot; the tall young girl said. &quot;You&#39;re getting younger, Mom. You&#39;re almost a kid again.&quot;<br />
<br />
She swallowed and said, &quot;That&#39;s ridiculous.&quot; Then, she looked down at herself just in time to see her breasts flatten out as she became too young for them to exist anymore. Then, she realized her feet had slipped out of her shoes, and her toes no longer even touched the floor. She looked up at her muscular son and her bean-pole daughter and realized that they both were taller and likely older than her now. &quot;Oh my God,&quot; she squeaked. &quot;I&#39;m tiny!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty smiled in satisfaction to see his spell working so well. Cries of shock and amazement drew his attention to the other customers around him.<br />
<br />
A teen boy, who had been eating a  BLT, now sported a thick beard and a beer gut. There was also a noticeable bulge in the crotch of his too-tight pants.<br />
<br />
The girl who had been sitting across from him, probably his date, had half finished her club sandwich. The conflicting meats had left her looking like a female bodybuilder, showing off ripped muscles with not an ounce of fat to be seen. Her cute face and large breasts, seemed out of place on her otherwise manly body.<br />
<br />
A younger boy the next table over, had eaten most of his steak and cheese sandwich. He was now over six feet tall and a total muscle monster with beefy hands and feet. Most of his clothes had torn apart as he grew. Above all that bulk was the scared, innocent face of a middle-school kid.<br />
<br />
The boy&#39;s father sitting across from him had shrunk into a dwarf bodybuilder after eating his Italian sub with its salami and pepperoni. He was hardly even four feet tall now but still covered in taught muscle thanks to the ham he had eaten.<br />
<br />
All around Ty were beautiful people of extreme shapes and sizes. He sat there watching as a giddy spectator of his own magic, amazed at how simple it had been. Just a few ideas scribbled on a cheap napkin and a touch of magic had led to all of this.<br />
<br />
And, it had all been so easy, like a silly game.<br />
<br />
&quot;What game should I play next?&quot; he wondered.</p>
