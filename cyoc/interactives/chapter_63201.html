<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt awoke the next day, at least happy that now he reach the floor without jumping off the litter. He thought <br />
that since yesterday he must be returning to his natural age just like Jack. Speaking of Jack he didn't return <br />
on all the night.<br />
<br />
He was hungry, the day before he was on constant guard trying not to get violated by some random feral <br />
inmates, or the allegedly harmless missing-links, that he didn't have a lot of time to scavenge for food. <br />
Today however he was schedule to be in the Farm. If was going to be into hard labor at least they would feed <br />
him.<br />
<br />
After a while the guards came to take him into the strange room again. And soon the projector displayed <br />
another movie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings inmate, today you have been schedule for the first time into Thorback Farm Section. Now let tell <br />
you that in this section of the facility is where all the food of the inmates is harvested, with the exception <br />
of the Jungle inmates of course, so is of special necesecity that you get familiar with the operations on the <br />
Farm. Normally the non-lifetime inmates are assigned either Agriculture or Barn labors, but you will do half <br />
of both today.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a pause again in the video before it resumed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since the readings in your collar signal that you're famish, you will start with the Barn labors.&quot;<br />
<br />
And like the last time the projector disappeared into the wall before it started working. Matt razionalized <br />
that they where only going to return him to his proper age, or perhaps older, since as a little kid he <br />
wouldn't be able to do as much work.<br />
<br />
Indeed he was getting bigger, and older, and soon he was his old fourteen-year-old self, for the most part, <br />
his pubes didn't return. But the machine didn't stop there soon he felt a pain in his groin, and his balls <br />
started to swell to the actual size of volleyballs, the same with his penis that began to enlarge and engorge <br />
until it was one foot and a half long and three inches wide. Now his limbs were getting the same pain, while <br />
they distorted their original shape, and in a quick movement his knees and elbows bend in the opposite <br />
direction. Soon he was on all fours, finally at the end of his back a bovine tail erupted to crown his <br />
transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whaaaaaa...aaaah...Wuahhat huuu... huuuppann?!&quot; he tried to speak but found it rather difficult.<br />
<br />
Unlike the last time, a guard came to him, he again tried to escape but his new limbs found him landing on his <br />
engorged jewels.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whahhaaaaaaaaaaa!&quot; Cried in pain. The guard simple approached him and secure it by the collar. He also <br />
produced a gag-ball which quickly put in place.<br />
<br />
&quot;There, that's better.&quot; Said while he lead Matt out of the barn and unto the facilities of the Farm, and by <br />
every stretch of the imagination it looked like a farm, there was a barn, silos, and of course the labor force <br />
on the fields. Still to Matt his current transformation crippled him worst than before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well boy, or cowboy as we affectionally call you. You might wonder what the bloody hell happened to you. I <br />
heard you where in the Jungle before, well things are different around here. Here we expect you to work. And <br />
you are no difference. Well, since you are taking a helluva time to learn how to be a quadruped, and I'm kinda <br />
contractually obligated to, let me explain you about the Farm. First of we are the Farmers, and by we, I mean <br />
the guards, you the inmates would be the cattle, but I'm getting ahead of myself.&quot; said while leading him to a <br />
fence where some bodies move inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;First the Lifetime inmates on the farm have it quite easy, depending on your definition of the word also. Of <br />
course we tried to reserve this fate to the worst criminals on our facility. We call them Pigs&quot; Matt got <br />
close, but his nose told him to get the fuck away, since the stench were revolting. It turns out to be a pig <br />
pen, for people, there the inmates in their almost unchange bodies, the ears and the nose the shape of a pig <br />
and a curly tail, where rolling on their own shit, while trying to sink their heads on the slop while tainting <br />
it with the feces. All the while shitting and rolling. Matt would trow up right their if it wheren't for the <br />
gag.<br />
<br />
&quot;Disgusting, isn't it. And you know the worst part. They're just as disgusted as you or me, their nose and <br />
taste buds are actually enhanced... look that one is trowing up too.&quot; And surely it was, but it wasn't the <br />
worst some of the other pigs that couldn't get to the slob actually were fighting to eat the regulgitated <br />
material. &quot;Man that's gross. But they have no choice, they're striked with a maddening hunger. Their skin was <br />
also made more resistant but more sensitive also, meaning they don't actually get burned from the sun but they <br />
are compulsive trying to cooldown, and the only cool stuff in here is well... but don't think we do it without <br />
a reason, their and your shit is used to power some kind of generator or something like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You will be a Pony later this evening so I might as well set you up in your stall.&quot; He was instructed into <br />
the barn. The smell was barely more tolerable that on the Pigpen. He was latter strapped into a stall, so he <br />
couldn't move. Then his gag was removed but it was replaced with a feeder. Some sort of grains were forced <br />
into his mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;If you wonder why you couldn't talk before is because your throat were modificated to better fit this <br />
dohicky. Now relax eat, shit and oh I almost forgot.&quot; said while holding an oversized cow milker that were <br />
soon obvious of its purpose.<br />
<br />
&quot;UUhhhhhhhmm&quot; tried to yell Matt when the machine strapped to him started to stimulate him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your balls were modified also to create an enriched solution of proteins., and let me tell you kid, even if <br />
you enjoy this part believe me soon it would be your worst nightmare. &quot; Said the farmer while leaving Matt in <br />
his stall. But far from enjoying it Matt were left with the most awful sensation of quasi-climax.<br />
<br />
<br />
After six hours he was relieved of his duties as a Cowboy, but lead again into the chamber. This time he <br />
regained his posture, but was left with the hind-legs of a horse, and his cow tail mutated to match his new <br />
hooved complexion. Also all the sexual craze he felt before vanished. In fact he felt no sexual drive <br />
whatsoever, the process had for all purpose neuter-him.<br />
<br />
Soon he found himself doing the hard labor work in the farm, along with other Ponies under the vigilance of <br />
the Farmers. By the end of the day, they return him his lower half to normal, almost dragging Matt back to his <br />
cell. <br />
<br />
Jack was already there, but fast sleep. Soon he did likewise, hoping his next day wouldn't be as traumatic.</p>
