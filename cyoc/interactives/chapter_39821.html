<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was a shortcut through a grassy field that could get Jared home faster. Why he chose that path on that day is anyone's guess. Some would say fate, others would say luck. Yet others would say this was going to happen to someone and Jared just happened to be that someone.<br />
<br />
Either way, Jared went through the field. The grass was waist high and had a sweet scent to it. It was a warm day, not too hot but warm enough that Jared wished he was wearing shorts and going shirtless rather then a tee-shirt and jeans.<br />
<br />
Jared wouldn't dress like that though, even if he were somewhere that people would allow it. <br />
<br />
You see, Jared (like many boys and girls his age) wasn't happy with his body. He wasn't fat by any means. He'd tried working out but he could never get much done lifting wise. His schoolmates could lift things four or five years ago that Jared was just starting to be able to lift.<br />
<br />
Jared was also shy around girls. Oh, he could speak to them just fine. But, he wasn't gung ho for them like all of the other guys at school were. Perhaps the things they said were just an act, or perhaps there was something wrong with Jared, he just didn't know. Either way, he just didn't seem to have the natural instincts that other boys his age had.<br />
<br />
As the somewhat damp ground squished under Jared's boots, he had a fleeting worry about his sexuality but pushed it aside. He found girls attractive; he just wasn't the so called walking hormone that the other guys seemed to be.<br />
<br />
Something pulled Jared from his thoughts. There was a rock that jutted out from the grass in the middle of the field. It seemed out of place. A slight breeze blew through the field as Jared neared the rock.<br />
<br />
Now, Jared was no fool but he was also a curious lad. He for example, knew enough not to mess with curses even if a part of him wondered what would happen if he did. Some risks just weren’t worth taking.<br />
<br />
The cool breeze that blew through the field reminded Jared of ghost stories. He considered turning back for a few moments. When the cool breeze subsided, Jared wondered it was just a feeling.<br />
<br />
He reached the rock and saw something sitting on top of it.<br />
<br />
Jared gulped when he saw a skin bikini. It was like something out of a typical guy's fantasy of a cave dwelling woman.Jared half expected a naked woman to run out nowhere and yell at him or to find out this was all a lure to turn him into a pig.<br />
<br />
When no one showed up, Jared risked picking up the top part of the skins. They were soft and had a somewhat sweaty odour to them. Jared wondered where the person that wore these was and what they were doing here.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better leave them alone, I don't want to piss anyone off,&quot; Jared said.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, at that moment, the skin he was holding made contact with the amulet. Magic or other forces that Jared never knew existed came into play.<br />
<br />
A surge of electricity shot through his body! He dropped the skin and the amulet and yelled out in pain. His vision blurred, he felt dizzy and fell to the ground.<br />
<br />
Jared risked standing when the vertigo faded and he could see properly again. He first stood on his knees. The damp ground had dirtied his pants and shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell was that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared stood up using his arms to steady himself.<br />
<br />
Fearing what else the skin would do, Jared reached for it and bolted his hand as if repelled by a magnetic force. It took three other tries before he worked up the courage to pick them up and put them back on the rock. <br />
<br />
He then picked up the amulet before putting it in his pants pocket.  It seemed dangerous but he didn't want to get rid of it in case he ended up sick from the shock and needed to show someone what caused it. He considered taking the skins with him as well. <br />
<br />
A bizarre thought saying to put them on ran through his mind. The idea turned him on a little, which made little sense to him. He'd never considered wearing women's clothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I'd better bring them. But then whoever put them here might get mad,&quot; Jared said.<br />
<br />
Jared's entire body was starting to tingle and he could swear that the grass at his waist was getting taller. He'd never seen grass grow that fast. <br />
<br />
Without thinking, he put the amulet on the rock, removed his shirt, threw it to the ground and picked up the bra part of the skins. He'd done it like he'd been doing it for years. <br />
<br />
Warmth appeared on his chest around and under his nipples. He felt dizzy again for several seconds. Feeling overdressed, he reached down, removed his shoes and socks, then his jeans and finally his boxers.<br />
<br />
That's when things really started getting strange.<br />
<br />
As the dirt squished between his toes, Jared saw that his legs were smooth and tanned. He gasped as he felt them only to come into contact with much smoother skin that he felt any boy should ever have. <br />
<br />
His nudity, seconds ago only secondary struck him. He'd removed his clothing without thinking as though he was supposed to be wearing the skin instead of clothes he was wearing. Stranger, he didn't feel as ashamed over being naked. There was worry over someone catching him but it wasn't a sense of shame as much as worrying he'd get into trouble.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the heck is...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared felt a sensation like something was molding his body as if it were dough. It didn't hurt, but it was an odd feeling. What should have only been possible in the world of dreams became reality as Jared's skin softened, smoothed, tanned and all of his body hair fell out! The real changes started as Jared's nipples grew all while something pressed from behind them.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way, there's just no way,&quot; Jared said.<br />
<br />
Jared's manhood, something he'd never taken pride in but definitely mattered to him was shrinking as his hips widened and waist narrowed.<br />
<br />
Panic hit Jared as he ran in hopes of escaping the force changing his body. The grass touching his now bare skin tickled and the squishy mud tickled his feet. <br />
<br />
He hadn’t of gotten far before he felt his hair touch the midway point of his back and a bouncy feeing of his chest. But, he also felt something else, strength and confidence.<br />
<br />
He stopped and looked at his body as best as he could. He'd become female, that much was obvious. There was almost the matter of well toned muscles on his arms and a four-pack on his belly where none had existed before. Even if the amulet and skins had made him a girl, at least they made him strong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I can't run around naked all day,&quot; Jared said.<br />
<br />
Even his voice was female!<br />
<br />
He walked back to the rock, saw his clothes on the ground and picked his shirt up. He couldn’t help but bring the shirt up to his face and inhale the scent of it. It had the scent of a male on it, which excited the part of him that was female even though he knew it was just he.<br />
<br />
Then he saw the skins.<br />
<br />
A sense of familiarity struck him and he put them on with the precision of someone that had been wearing them (or similar garments) for months or years. <br />
<br />
Jared felt complete.<br />
<br />
Oh, Jared was still himself but the amulet insured he'd inherited at least some of the thoughts and feelings of the original owner of the bikini to make sure he could function.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I get it, the amulet touches clothes and I become whoever wore those clothes,&quot; Jared said. &quot;Makes sense, I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
If nothing else at least, Jared enjoyed the sound of his altered voice as well as the confidence he felt. Not quite enough to be a sin, but enough to overcome any insecurity that he may have had over being in a body that he perhaps felt unworthy to have access to.<br />
<br />
“It’s not like I stole her body, I just copied it -- by accident,” Jared said. “Anyway, she can borrow my old body if she wants. Who knows, maybe she'll like having a twin sister.”<br />
<br />
Jared wondered if the amulet had also told him how it worked. Though, what happened wasn’t too much of a leap of logic to figure out.<br />
<br />
Jared was about to take the amulet and leave his old clothes when he realized that he had a problem. If he came home looking like this, no one would recognize him! <br />
<br />
A sly grin crossed his face.<br />
<br />
“I could put my old clothes on  and go to my friend’s house pretending to be lost,” Jared said.<br />
<br />
Jared shook his head. Maybe not, that would be cruel and if this body made him attracted to said friend, could lead to all sorts of other problems.<br />
<br />
But, Jared wondered, what else could he do with this body?</p>
