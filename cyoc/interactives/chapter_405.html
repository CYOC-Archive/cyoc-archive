<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Mr. Mendes,&quot; came Ric's voice from the behind the door. 
<br>

<br>
 Francisco sighed at being interrupted, drawing away from Marco's waiting body. He walked nude over to the door and opened it a slightly. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;What's up, Ric?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Well... Josh and I wanted to play with the book a little more before we went to sleep. We're not really tired, and we promise not to do anything to you or anything
<br>
 bad...&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Mr. Mendes paused for a moment in thought, and then went to get the book. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Alright, just don't do anything to us, okay?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Sure thing, Mr. Mendes. I promise.&quot; Ric smiled as he grabbed the book, and then went upstairs to the bedroom the boys were sharing. 
<br>

<br>
 As he reached the room, he looked in to see Josh's sleeping form on the bed. Ric smiled at himself. Now he'd be able to practice changes to Josh while he was
<br>
 sleeping, without having to worry about anyone getting freaked out. 
<br>

<br>
 Ric read through the book and found a spell change Josh so that he'd sleep through a sonic boom. He uttered the spell and watched as Josh's breathing slowed
<br>
 ever so slightly, and he started to snore a little. Ric smiled. 
<br>

<br>
 Flipping through the book, he found a spell that he wanted to try, and said the words. He watched closely, and saw Josh start to grow. His legs and arms extended
<br>
 just a little bit, and his torso grew to match. Once he was 5'4 inches tall, his body stopped growing and started to thicken. His small chest blossomed out, and
<br>
 became and developed into that of a young swimmer, and a light dusting of dark hair spread over his newly grown pecs. The hair swirled down in a thin line over
<br>
 his abdomen, where small abs could be seen poking through, as the last of his pre-adolescent fat disappeared. The trail of hair continued down through down to is
<br>
 crotch, and when it met his pubic hair, it began to spread as well. As the dark hair thickened around his small genetials, his penis lengthened and grew until it was 5
<br>
 inches, and erect from the pleasure of changing. 
<br>

<br>
 Ric saw a smile spread across Josh's face, and he almost started flipping through the book, but his brother's slow snore continued. Ric sighed in relief. 
<br>

<br>
 The hair continued is spread onto Josh's legs, and Ric looked on, slightly aroused, even at his brother, as he saw his thighs bulge out slightly. He could see the
<br>
 covers of the bed move slightly as his butt must have become bigger and tighter. The light dusting of hair spread down to his calves and feet, calves gaining size,
<br>
 while the feet grew hardly at all. Josh's arms grew as well, biceps and triceps becoming visible, forearms growing in proportion. 
<br>

<br>
 The dusting of hair stopped it's trek, but didn't stop Josh's face from changing. His boyish face slowly became more adult, and his jawline and upper lip grew a
<br>
 shadow of stubble. Josh's jawline hardened, and his chin grew ever so slightly out. His eyebrows became thicker and more swept up, while his nose became more
<br>
 blunt. His eyes shifted slightly in his head, their becoming a little more narrow, length-wise, and a little wider in height. Finally, Josh's cheek bones shifter a fraction
<br>
 of an inch higher and his face took on a more square shape, rather than oval. 
<br>

<br>
 Ric looked at his brother, and found that he no longer looked the part. Josh now looked like a very short, yet very cute 22 year old hispanic man, and resembled
<br>
 him as a brother not at all. 
<br>

<br>
 The new feelings that he had been having, especially for Marco, exterted themselves in Ric now for Josh's new body. Ric picked up the book again, flipped
<br>
 another few pages, and found the spell he was looking for. Before he read it, he looked for another spell further on in the book, and found one to his liking. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;I hope this works right,&quot; Ric whispered, and then chanted the strange spells, one quickly after the other. 
<br>

<br>
 He felt slightly dizzy as the first spell took effect, and looked down at his body. He could see his own chest start to swell out, and could feel his ass push more
<br>
 tightly into his underwear. His briefs stretched out more as his nearly developed cock became larger, resting at 7 inches, while his balls became bigger as well. The
<br>
 feeling was orgasmic, yet he waited to touch, at least until the spell ended. He looked at his arms, and could feel them grow as he watched his biceps become
<br>
 thicker. While his body shifted, he watched in the room's mirror as his skin became slightly lighter, nipples becoming pink instead of brown. His hair stayed as dark,
<br>
 but tips of colors, blue, green, yellow and red formed at the tips, which spiked themselves up but then shortened to 3/4 of an inch. A small tatoo of barbed wire
<br>
 snaked around his left arm near the shoulder, and his nipples became piereced with small hoops, and a small post appeared through the tip of his member. A thin
<br>
 goatee formed around his mouth and chin, though the hair on the rest of his body, except for his pubes, armpits and head, disappeared. 
<br>

<br>
 He stared at the sight in the mirror, and realized that he looked like an 18 year caucasian raverboy, though he had only grown to 5'7&quot; tall, as tall as Mr. Mendes. 
<br>

<br>
 As he gathered in his thoughts, the second spell he'd iterated came to effect, and he hear Josh's snore interrupt as he woke up. Josh sat up quickly and looked at
<br>
 his brother, but because of the second spell, didn't think they were related. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Hey Ric, I've been waiting for you all night! Were you out clubbing again or what?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Josh looked over at the other side of the bed, and Ric, smiling at how well his spells turned out, set he book on the nightstand and went to join him. 
<br>

<br>
 The two soon-to-be lovers looked at each other, fresh in their new bodies, and lust filled them...</p>
