<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The rules for the game were simple. Betting would take place and you could fold at anytime. While the loss of cups would reduce your age, gaining chips would not increase it. No age changes would take place until the completion of the hand meaning and if someone had more chips than their current age they would not regress. After a few hands everyone’s ages had changed a bit.<br />
<br />
It had taken Megan a hand or two but now the woman had a accumulated quite a haul of chips. At 40 she was also the oldest, her light brown hair still sporting a few grey streaks in her hair. Jackie was the next oldest at 35, the magically aged up teens face appeared a bit fresher than when she was 43 and her breasts seemed to have perked up yet she was still a very mature looking adult. Stephanie currently was third, being 29. While the raven haired beauty had been only too happy to leave her 40s, passing her 30s had caused her to frown. Stephanie appeared much fresher than usual with a young face, firm body and glowing, healthy hair. Stephanie glowered as she gazed at her chips, she was down to 29 meaning if she lost any more she would begin growing younger once again. <br />
<br />
Despite being the youngest now at 25, Ann was feeling confident. Ann had won the last hand increasing her total chip count to 32. Despite some early struggles Ann had managed to win a few hands and kept herself from becoming too young. Still, she was now the youngest of the four by a few years. Ann’s body was quite fit, her blond hair shining with vitality while her face was youthful and and vibrant. As the cards were dealt Ann smirked, she had been dealt a pair of aces.<br />
<br />
“Hell of a poker face Angel,” Jackie chuckled. Glancing at her own cards she sighed, she had nothing deciding to check on the betting. “Well the bets to you Stephanie,” Ann grinned. Stephanie rubbed her chin as she gazed at her cards, she had a possible flush but she needed some help. “What the hell,” she shrugged. “I’ll bet two.” The others followed suit, throwing a pair of chips into the center of the table as everyone took new cards. Ann glanced at her cards, smiling at the three aces she had been dealt. As the betting came to Ann she looked at the others, deciding she would test her luck. “I bet five more,” Ann stated as she threw her chips into the center. Stephanie and Jackie sighed, folding their hands. Stephanie shuttered as two more years evaporated from her age, leaving her 27. The raven haired beauty appeared a little more refreshed but her appearance had not really changed. Jackie, who had more chips than her age (she had started the hand with 40 chips) experienced no age changes.<br />
<br />
Megan smiled as she looked at Ann. “You must have something good,” Megan smiled. Glancing at her chips she could see her chip count was currently well over 60. “Well I have plenty of chips so might as well call,” she said. “Oh and I raise five more.” Ann’s eyes went wide as she saw Megan throw her five chips in. If Ann saw the bet she would be left with 20 chips, meaning if she lost she would be reduced to 20. As she studied Megan she now began to think things over. Megan had accumulated quite a few chips through bluffing, scaring off potential victors and amassing a hefty chip count. Ann furrowed her brow as she gazed at her friend, she wouldn’t let Megan bluff again. “I call,” Ann stated as she threw her chips into the pot. Smiling Ann revealed her hand. “Three aces.”<br />
<br />
“Sorry Ann,” Megan smiled. “Full house. Nines and sixes.” Ann groaned as she felt the changes overtake her. The young adult now began growing younger, her face becoming fresher and more innocent as her blond hair appeared to grow brighter. Ann frowned as she looked over her clothes, finding they were now quite loose around her waist. Ann even noticed her flats now appeared slightly bigger on her feet. As the college coed dug into her purse and glanced at her license she could see it now said she was under 21.<br />
<br />
“Aww isn’t she just the cutest,” Stephanie teased. “Looks Like our little Annie isn’t old enough to drink with the grown ups.” Megan and Jackie giggled as Ann stuck out her tongue. “Look who’s talking Steffi,” Ann responded, wincing at the youthfulness of her voice. “You ur not that far behind me. At the rate your going your going to be drinking out of a zippy cup sooner than I will.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah yeah whatever,” Stephanie laughed, waving off Ann before looking at Jackie. “So are you going to let your underage girlfriend keep drinking wine? I don’t think I can really approve of underage drinking.” The group now began to chuckle as they looked at one another. “We’ll talk about it in a bit,” Jackie smiled. “How about we deal the next hand. I think we’re closing in on picture time.” The girls nodded as they now anxiously gazed at one another. Pretty soon one of them was going to find themselves in diapers.</p>
