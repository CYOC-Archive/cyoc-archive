<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Can I play too?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff and Lisa gasped, scrambling to cover themselves as they gazed up into the innocent eyes of Sharon. &quot;Hey Sharon,&quot; Jeff stammered. &quot;Why aren&#39;t you with the others?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard something funny,&quot; the little girl lisped. &quot;What you doing? Can I play too?&quot; Both teens turned crimson, quickly dressing to avoid any further unnecessary questions from the curious 4 year old. &quot;Um Jeff,&quot; Lisa blushed. &quot;Why don&#39;t you get the kids something to eat. I&#39;ll take Sharon back to her friends.&quot; Jeff simply nodded, standing and making his way towards the kitchen as Lisa made her way towards the stairs.<br />
<br />
As the teenage Lisa reached the bottom of the stairs, she sealed her fate.  With so many changes taking place, the Chronovac recognized that their should be four young children within the home. With Jimmy now an underutilized egg, the Chronovac searched for another. Recognizing that Lisa&#39;s physical age had already been altered once, the program logically believed she should be the fourth member of this preschool gathering.<br />
<br />
As Lisa ascended the stairs, an odd feeling began to wash over her. The teenage girl at first believing it to be a draft. Slowly though she was retreating through high school. By the time she reached the top of the stairs, where an upperclassmen had been was now replaced by a 14 year old Freshman who looked as if she had just started high school.<br />
<br />
Lisa paused, fidgeting with her jeans. Odd, they had fit when she put them. Why were they loose around the hips? Lisa shook the thought from her head, brushing her long brunette hair behind her ear. She was actually getting a chance to date an upperclassmen, how many Freshman could say that? All she needed to do was get the munchkin back to her friends.<br />
<br />
Taking Sharon to her friends, Lisa smiled turning to leave but still unable to shake that odd feeling washing over her. Maybe it was her nerves. Heading into the bathroom, the now 13 year old Lisa looked into the mirror. Something didn&#39;t seem right.<br />
<br />
Lisa couldn&#39;t be sure what was wrong. The girls clothing felt off, her jeans were loose around her waist, the cuffs bunching around her barefeet. Even her shirt felt baggy, Lisa glancing down to notice a bra that was at least a cup size too big. What was stranger was her barefeet feeling as if they were being tickled by the bath mat she stood on. It was almost like the mat was moving.<br />
<br />
Shaking this thought from her head, Lisa glanced in the mirror raising an eyebrow. The girls reflection seemed off, Lisa couldn&#39;t figure out why. Had her reflection been higher in the mirror? Lisa now stood on tip toe leaning in to get a better look at herself. She still looked like her 12 year old self, her face round and soft with large innocent eyes. Turning she now looked for an zits, quickly shaking her head at the thought. Why would she have zits? She was only 11.<br />
<br />
Standing flat footed again, a now 10 year old Lisa frowned. Why did the mirror seem so high? She could of sworn she could see more of herself, now she could see her reflection from her shoulders up. Looking over her clothing was also confusing, she needed to hold her jeans with one hand to keep it from slipping off her thin waist as the cuffs accordioned around her tiny feet. The girls t-shirt looked baggy, descending past her waist while a useless bra hung underneath. Lisa could only sigh as she looked at her useless undergarment, she couldn&#39;t wait to have boobies like her big sister. Maybe that&#39;s why she borrowed her bis sisters clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatcha doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa turned, noticing a 4 year old Sharon gazing at her curiously. &quot;Nothing,&quot; an 8 year old Lisa replied. Sharon nodded, gazing at the slightly older gurl curiously. The tiny blonde couldn&#39;t be sure but it looked like Lisa was getting smaller. &quot;Will you play with me,&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t wanna play baby games,&quot; Lisa scoffed. &quot;I&#39;m a big girl!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you getting littler.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not getting littler I&#39;m seven,&quot; Lisa proclaimed proudly. Sharon gave the girl a look of confusion, Lisa certainly didn&#39;t look like a big girl. <br />
<br />
Lisa rolled her eyes turning back to the mirror. This didn&#39;t seem right. Lisa could&#39;ve sworn she could see her reflection before, how was the mirror so tall? Frowning the girl let her far too heavy jeans drop, the 6 year old standing on tiptoe as she tried to get a better look at herself.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t seem any different. Lisa&#39;s face was round, childish, her long brown hair cascading past her shoulders. Smiling, she giggled as she noticed her missing tooth, sticking her tongue through the hole as she made a funny face. Lisa always did like to laugh.<br />
<br />
Eventually the young girls legs began to grow tired, going flat-footed once more the 4 year old blinked as she gazed up at the mirror in wonder. She could&#39;ve sworn she had been tall enough to see her reflection a moment ago. Now, she would probably need a step stool just to see her face as the sink rested justbeneathher chin. Rubbing her eyes, the tiny brunette wondered why her clothes were so big. The moment passed though as just as suddenly she found them fitting her small body perfectly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did you find any makeup,&quot; Sharon asked.<br />
<br />
Lisa turned, seeing her best friend Sharon in the doorway. &quot;No makeup,&quot; Lisa sighed sadly. &quot;I guess we can&#39;t play makeovers.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thats okay,&quot; Sharon chirped. &quot;Lets go back and play with Mikey and Tony.&quot; The idea of playing with her friends immediately perked the young brunette up, the little girls now speeding from the bathroom towards Mikeys room.<br />
<br />
Downstairs, Jeff now emerged from the kitchen. Unsure of what to make, he considered asking Lisa what would be good for a group of preschoolers. As he made his way towards the couch, he began to feel a slight headache as he stared at Lisa&#39;s shoes and socks. Teenage Lisa had forgotten to put then back on when Sharon had interrupted them but, that was impossible. Lisa was only 4 years old, wasn&#39;t she?<br />
<br />
Jeff now began to wonder what was going on, as the teen blinked he became even more confused. One moment a teenage girls white sneakers and ankle socks lay discarded on the floor. The next, a little girls pink velcro sneakers and socks lay in its place. Jeff couldn&#39;t be sure but he was beginning to think something weird was going on.</p>
