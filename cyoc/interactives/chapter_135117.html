<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So how long have you and Sammy been a couple,” Nate asked as the group settled into their table. “Around four years,” he said non chalantly as he browsed the menu. Samantha’s eyes bulged as she elbowed her boyfriend in the side. “He means four months,” she said quickly. “We’ve known each other for four years and just started dating.”<br />
<br />
Satisfied the others returned to their menus as Mike shot his girlfriend an angry look. “The hell babe,” he hissed, rubbing his side. “Why you elbow me?”<br />
<br />
“Hello we’re 14, “ she whispered. “You need to think about that before you speak. Otherwise we blow our cover. Do you think people would actually believe it if we said we started dating at 10!?!”<br />
<br />
Mike paused as he thought about what Samantha was saying, she had more experience with this kind of thing than he did. Sighing he looked down at his menu. “So much for ordering drinks then,” he grumbled, turning the page.<br />
<br />
“So your mom seems like fun,” Gloria said, trying to change the subject. Nate and Adam shrugged as they looked at each other. “I guess,” they said. “She’s always been a bit of a fitness nut. Whatever happened when she was a kid must of had a big effect on her. Personally we always found her to be a bit of a goofball.”<br />
<br />
Gloria nodded, rubbing her chin thoughtfully. “Huh cool,” she said. “Sounds a little like Samantha, I bet she would of been besties with her if they were the same age.” No one noticed Gloria’s ring give off a faint glow, taking Gloria’s musings as a wish.<br />
<br />
Madison sighed as she parked her car. Nervously she looked back towards the restaurant where her sons were. She knew this would eventually happen however she still wasn’t ready for it. As she looked back smiling she felt a small chill run through her body. “Huh weird,” she thought. Glancing in the mirror she quickly brushed her sandy brown bangs back. She didn’t want to be vain but she had to admit she still looked good at 45. “The boys are going to be at least an hour,” she mused. “Should give me plenty of time to get a workout in.”<br />
<br />
As Madison drove she found herself feeling more energetic than usual. Curiously she looked herself over periodically. “Huh guess that preworkout drink I took is kicking in,” she smiled. “Just in time too. Today’s workout is going to be brutal.”<br />
<br />
Madison bounded out of her car as she headed towards the gym. The woman was an avid fan of both CrossFit and yoga, meaning that despite her age she was in tremendous shape. As she slowly aged backwards though she found her body beginning to tighten up even more. Entering the gym a 40 year old Madison smiled as she saw the receptionist.<br />
<br />
“Hey Maddie,” a young woman in her early 20s said. “Your looking well. How’s everything?”<br />
<br />
“Great,” she said happily. “The boys are out on a date right now so I figured I’d get a quick workout in.<br />
<br />
“Oh wow congrats on the boys,” she said, passing Madison a locker key. “Well have fun and don’t take too long. Know how you get when your focused.” Madison giggled as she headed towards the locker room. “I’ll try to be quick but can’t make any promises.”<br />
<br />
Entering the locker room a now 39 year old Madison began to change. Throwing on her workout attire she paused as she took in her appearance. “Wow girl,” she thought. “Your looking fantastic today.” Madison smiled broadly as she tied her hair back in a ponytail. For some reason she looked more refreshed than usual. Madison noticed that it appeared some of the fine lines she had begun to notice around her eyes and mouth seemed to have vanished. Looking even closer it seemed her sandy brown hair seemed shinier as well. “Guess that facial cream and organic diet is finally paying off,” she smirked.<br />
<br />
Making her way out into the gym, Madison made her way over to the free weights as she began her workout. As she did she found her body filling up with even more energy as she continued to regress. As she became 35 she paused as she looked herself over. “Wow what’s up with me today,” she thought happily. “Usually after 10 sets I’m ready to rest. Today I feel like I could do 10 more.” Glancing over her body she smiled happily. The woman’s lean muscle seemed more defined than usual as she flexed. Running her hands over her body she smiled as she found her body to be even leaner than usual. Her stomach, while flat usual had no definition now showed signs of abs. “Finally it’s about time all these crunches paid off,” she thought. “Haven’t had defined abs like this in more than 10 years.”<br />
<br />
Madison smiled,toweling herself off and taking a drink of water. As she gazed around the gym she noticed a couple of guys staring at her. Madison was used to looks at the gym, being an attractive woman in decent shape usually gained her some attention. This was different though, these guys seemed to be almost gawking at her like she was the most beautiful thing they had ever seen. Blushing slightly she gave the two a shy wave before turning back towards a mirror. “Well can’t blame them,” she thought. “I mean wow I do look great today, no one would ever think I was 45.”<br />
<br />
Madison couldn’t help gazing at her appearance, posing a little just for fun. Now only 33 she noticed how defined her abs and obliques looked. Heating up her c cup breasts in her sports bra she had to admit even she thought she was drop dead gorgeous. “Stop that,” she giggled, shaking her head. “Your acting like a goof.” Looking up at the clock she realized she had already been at the gym 30 minutes. The boys would probably be ready to be picked up in another 40 minutes meaning she needed to start finishing her workout up. Rubbing her chin thoughtfully she wondered what to do next.</p>
