<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff the 5&#39;10&quot; love dragon got to his class right as the bell rang. he soon felt another pill escape his maw. spitting into his hands he glanced across the computer class as Mr. Stienfeild took attendance. he had gotten lucky with the pill he took and barely anything had changed. however, he knew he may not get so lucky next time.  <br />
<br />
these changes were like a lottery. sometimes you got something like Tyler getting a bigger cock and sometimes it was like Danna who was a walking pile of breasts. speaking of which both were here. he could give it to one of them. while he liked changing people with this he didn&#39;t want to do it to them again unless he was out of options.  <br />
<br />
memories of Jen spraying Ms. Matthews and her growing a cock had become her growing it when she drank the contaminated water. the change had changed his personality as well. he was more respectful than his old self. checking the clock he silently gasped as he saw that his time was now half. he then saw another of his fellow cheerleaders.  <br />
<br />
Connie was currently working on her program homework. it was for a beauty simulation game. he approached her and used his charm. &quot;hey Connie. wow, your game is going very well&quot; he said making his fellow cheerleader blush. &quot;oh! thanks, Jeff. did you come over just to tell me that?&quot; she asked halting her work to look him directly in his eyes.  <br />
<br />
smiling he held out the pill. &quot;I was wondering if you would like you to take this. it helps give people energy&quot; he said as he handed her the pill. it wasn&#39;t necessarily a lie. the pill could give you energy.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t do drugs,&quot; she said even though she was slowly putting it to her mouth. &quot;I don&#39;t do them either. besides why would I be giving drugs to people in school?&quot; he said laying heavily on his charm. Connie simply nodded as she took the pill in her mouth and drank from her water. Jeff simply stepped back as Connie returned to working on her game.  <br />
<br />
As she did the changes began. first was her shoes. they began to tear open as her toes were absorbed by large black hoofs. next her body began to fill out with muscle. the button of her jeans popped off as a bulge grew.  <br />
<br />
it kept growing as it pushed the zipper apart. her hands gained pads as her fingernails turned into black claws. her lips and the bottoms of her nose turned black as her clothing began to tear. all her feminine features were now gone. her breasts sunk into her chest as dull yellow fur covered her torso.  <br />
<br />
a long lion&#39;s tail grew from her ass and became covered in muddy brown spots. muddy brown fur soon covered everything up to her elbows and just below her knees. her shorts were torn open as her monster cock kept growing. the barbed head poking out of its dull yellow sheath. his balls had now grown to where they rested on the floor.  <br />
<br />
this pushed Connor&#39;s back as his face changed. his blond hair became fiery orange as his face pushed out into a muzzle. his eyebrows followed his hair as horns grew above her ears. his muscles kept growing till it looked like he was on steroids. spots and stripes of various felines now littered the backside of his body.  <br />
<br />
his bush turned fiery orange as his cock finished growing. the hard behemoth&#39;s head was now above Conner&#39;s head. the cock was almost as thick as his waist and covered in feline barbs. Jeff also noted what looked like a dog knot at its base as the veins covering pulsed. he saw that Conner&#39;s balls had grown even more.    <br />
<br />
they were so large that he could sit on them like a beanbag chair if he wanted to. his large paw hands were currently in the process of trying to move the cock out of his view. long mud-brown fur now hung off the bottom of his forearms. he now had a large muzzle with large fangs and several canines and molars. his once long blond hair was now a shorter mess of orange fur.  <br />
<br />
orange sideburns passed his ears as his eyebrows were now thicker. eyes green felines rested on light yellow backdrops. &quot;ugh when you said it gives energy I thought it would be to my head not my cock.&quot; the 6-foot bovine/feline hybrid said before standing up. despite his balls still dragging the ground Conner was still able to move without a problem. his cock now rested at a 75-degree angle. <br />
<br />
&quot;sorry, I didn&#39;t know,&quot; Jeff said as he watched his friend walk away. &quot;your lucky the ladies all love you. ugh...&quot; he began to grunt as her cock pulsed. he soon moaned as several gallons of cum flew across the room. Mr. Steinfeld and another student were hit as the teacher was observing her school project.  <br />
<br />
a few moments passed and suddenly a sound was heard. it sorta sounded like a vacuum cleaner but more organic.  One of the two forms inside the goop became larger as the puddle became smaller. Eventually, the second form was clean of cum. he wore Mr. Steinfeld&#39;s outfit.  <br />
<br />
however, it now looked more seductive. Mr. Stienfeild was now light maroon with an off-white front, feet, hand, calves, and face. his eyes are now light blue with black pupils. a long off-white tail grew behind his skinny frame. it ended with three long maroon tuffs. speaking of several furry spikes that grew on his elbows, rear, back, and head. it sorta looked like he had several cowlicks. what looked like a spade from a card game was now imprinted on his thighs and wrists. <br />
<br />
Three maroon claws now covered his feline-like feet. two black and grey goat horns rested between his large pointed ears. his left horn extended a good foot beyond the back of his head. the right one was short and curved toward his front. he looked slightly annoyed as Conner with jagged lips. his upper canines could be seen always.  <br />
<br />
the 4&#39; 1&quot; skinny mutant spoke in a high tenor voice.&quot;Mr. Watson I&#39;ve told you not to cum in class. anywhere else is acceptable. after all, we don&#39;t want the computers to break&quot; the teacher spoke. &quot;sorry Mr. Standfun. I couldn&#39;t help myself&quot; Conner spoke to the now Mr. Standfun as his cock retreated to his sheath.  <br />
<br />
his balls no longer dragging the ground. As he spoke the student finished sucking the cum up. Jeff could not believe what he saw now. While Jeff hadn&#39;t known the former student he knew she was tall. the thing on the floor was not.  <br />
<br />
the only reason she was the same height as Conner was the cum she consumed. quickly her size shrank. She was now tan with hoofs. her stance was now like a frog. her beak slash muzzle opened wide revealing nothing but a blue tounge.  <br />
<br />
said tongue looked like a worm as it extended several feet and sucked up the remaining cum on Conner&#39;s sheath. horns wrapped around her still human eyes and back to her behind. the former student had to be less than 2 feet tall. &quot;your lucky Licker was heard otherwise you&#39;d be in big trouble&quot; Mr... wait, no, as Sammy said. new memories of their computer teacher being a cool guy came to Jeff&#39;s mind. he then saw Licker return to her seat.  <br />
<br />
using her long tongue she worked on whatever she had been doing beforehand. turning back to his seat Conner now had a red shirt and tan shorts on. the latter is now made out of stretchy material so it would rip. &quot;come on dude my dungeon is almost done come see&quot; Jeff saw Conner return to his computer. what had been a beauty game was now an RPG dungeon game.  <br />
<br />
Jeff recognized the characters as being other mutants now in their school. &quot;figured since there are not many mutants I&#39;d help out. ya know make people aware we exist,&quot; Conner said. the final boss looked an awful lot like Conner. suddenly the bell rang and it was time to get to his next class.  <br />
<br />
he hadn&#39;t even noticed Kyle was in the hall as he and Conner walked a bit before splitting off. the freshman was laughing while covering his mouth.  &#39;three down four to go&#39; the boy thought as he eyed the mutants around the school. soon he would be the most normal person in this school. well outside as most people would probably become mutants.  <br />
<br />
meanwhile, Jeff had gotten to his next class...</p>
