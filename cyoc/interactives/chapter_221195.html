<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jared waited until Jeff returned, for the next changes. Todd had fallen asleep by now, and Jeff had dropped a blanket over him, before moving to his old spot behind his friends. Jared turned towards the twins. “Now that I have a new best friend, we will need something else. As we are two, and you are also two, that will fall to you, Dennis and Colin. First you will strip naked, and while you are at it, pull your belts from your jeans for later. Next, you two will both change into cute, little golden Retriever pups. But to save you from the pain later, you will already be neutered now. Your balls will fall off and flatten into your new name-tags. They will remain blank until I decided on your new names. Your belts will then become your new collars, which will form around you necks with the name-tags attached. Any excess length from your belt will become an extendable leash.” With a satisfied grin, Jared waited to watch the changes. <br />
All eyes turned towards Dennis and Colin, who made eyes the size of dinner plates in their shock. Both thought the same. “He makes us into dogs? Little puppies?” They had seen that somehow Jared could change others with Todd. But becoming animals? It didn´t take their bodies long to strip, and their belts landed before them, the rest in a heap underneath them.<br />
Both boys grimaced as their balls simply dropped off. While it was painless, it still felt weird. Like in a cartoon, their dropping balls splashed on the ground, forming an egg-shaped, flat name-tag. Then their changes started from their feet upwards.<br />
As the group watched, both boy´s feet deformed, as their big toes moved back into dew-claws. Their other toes shortened while out of their nails grew claws. Paw-pads formed under their soles, much more sensitive than their skin had been. Golden fur grew in to cover the whole paw, before continuing up their legs. <br />
Their legs reshaped into hind-legs, bending their knees the other way painlessly, even when there was an audible crack from all four knees. Overall, their legs thinned and shortened a bit as the fur grew in. With a light pressure above their ass, their new tails started to grow, and both boys felt weird for this new limb they could feel. Forty centimeters it grew behind them, fitting their actual size. On their front, their cock was pressed back, flat against their stomach, before skin built a sheath around it.<br />
From there, it got faster, as their body reshaped into a dog´s, another crack each as their back´s bend for them to be quadruped beings. With a gesture, Jared allowed them to fall forward onto all fours, so they wouldn´t start to hurt their changed back. The changes traveled down their arms, reshaping them into fore-legs. As the changes reached their hands, fingers shortened away into stubs, nails grew into claws, their thumbs become dew-claws, and paw-pads grew on their palms. Soon, from the neck down, Colin and Dennis were golden furred dogs.<br />
But their heads didn´t take long to follow. Their faces grew outwards, forming a muzzle out of their nose and mouth. Their ears moved up their head, before reshaping into dog-ears. Their already blond hair shortened to fit in with their fur. <br />
A few seconds after their heads were finished, leaving them both human-sized dogs, the second change started. All off the sudden, both felt themselves shrinking, as their bodies regressed back from adult dogs into little, innocent puppies. It didn´t stop until they could pass for cats if only the size was an indicator. They stopped regressing at an age of six-weeks-old.<br />
The last to happen was for their shrunken and reformed belts to jump to their necks, turning into a collar each, with the extended length becoming a leash. Their balls-turned-name-tags also jumped up, connecting to the respective spot on the collar. <br />
Both Dennis and Colin had a slightly vacated look in their eyes, as their minds begun to rewrite, sending both boys awareness into a back-corner of their minds, able to see and hear, but with no control over their bodies. Their lack of real awareness, combined with their new age and how full their bladders had been before led to them pissing on their old clothes without control.<br />
Jared smiled down at them as he got up and petted both puppies on the head, satisfied with the results. He ignored the now wet clothes underneath them; Jeff would deal with them. But when he didn´t move, Jared ordered his brother: “Jeff, remove the wet clothes before they stink everything up. Put them with the rest. But give me something to laugh with them first.”<br />
Jeff walked up to Colin´s and Dennis´s clothes and carefully lifted them, keeping the remaining liquid on them. Somewhere deep within him he knew exactly what his brother would laugh over, and even without being ordered to do just that, he did. Meaning, he lifted the clothes up enough to his face and tilted them, drinking the piss with a disgusted look on his face. After doing so with both sets, he placed them above each other and went for the door, taking another deep sniff on the soaked clothes before leaving.<br />
Jared was howling with laugher for that while still petting the two puppies. Said puppies still looked dazed. Todd was still sleeping, and the remaining three people in the room looked disgusted at the display, as well as angry with Jared for doing all this. Shortly after that, Jeff returned, still looking disgusted at what he did, returning to his spot.<br />
For another little laugh, he decided how to name each puppy by simply switching their former names. Meaning, as he petted Colin, he renamed him Dennis, while he renamed Dennis into Colin. Their new names engraved themselves into their name-tags, and only the changed boys themselves and Jeff knew instantly they had switched names, while the others weren´t too sure who was who before.<br />
Jared then woke the sleeping Todd, and asked him: “Which puppy do you want to have? Colin or Dennis?” A minute later, Colin (Dennis) was Todd´s new pet, while Jared would keep Dennis (Colin) as his own.<br />
Now there were only three people to change left.</p>
