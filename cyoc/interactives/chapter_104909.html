<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">	Jack was worried about Alex. Why did he have to go to the locker room? Feeling curious, he decided to follow Coach Cameron and Alex. As he was about to peek into the locker room, a big, hairy and smelly jock came out, belching and farting as he did so. <br />
	Jack was disgusted by the strong stench of the jock&#39;s farts. Not to mention the strong BO coming from his extremely hairy pits. He squinted at the jock. Somehow, he looked vaguely familiar. With a shock, Jack realised that the jock used to be his geeky friend, Alex! But how did Alex get so jock-like?<br />
	He wanted to question Alex but after seeing the stupid grin on Alex&#39;s face, he decided not to. It looked like Alex had become a typical dumb jock.<br />
	Jack knew that he would have to confront the jocks who had changed Alex instead. He took a deep breath and barged courageously into the locker room.<br />
	When Jack entered the room, he saw three jocks lounging around. They were wearing nothing but smelly, stained jockstraps which were too small for their massive manhoods. Jack saw that these jocks were quite similar to Alex, hairy, smelly and muscular.<br />
	He also noticed Coach Cameron, also wearing a jockstrap that was also too small for his surprisingly large cock. Jack had never seen the coach of the football team shirtless before. Coach Cameron was obese, his hairy, rounded belly sagging past his cock. He also had pretty big and hairy man breasts. Jack also noticed that the coach was balding rapidly, with a bald spot and a receding hairline. He looked at Coach Cameron with disgust. He didn&#39;t know how some men let themselves go and balloon into men that were positively round!<br />
	Jack turned to face the jocks. &quot;Hey, you jerks! Turn Alex back to his normal self! And if you don&#39;t, I&#39;ll tell the whole school!&quot; He shouted bravely.<br />
	Unfortunately, all the jocks did was laugh in his face. &quot;You&#39;re threatening us?&quot; One of the jocks, Simon, laughed. &quot;A puny little geek? Besides, no one would believe you. But, just to make sure, we&#39;d better to something to ensure you won&#39;t, bro.&quot;<br />
	&quot;How do you feel about Coach&#39;s body, dude?&quot; Another jock, Devon, said.<br />
	Jack gulped and looked at Coach Cameron&#39;s fat, hairy and balding body. No way! He didn&#39;t want to become the average middle aged man!<br />
	&quot;No, please! I swear I won&#39;t tell anyone, just please don&#39;t change me!&quot; He pleaded.<br />
	&quot;It&#39;s too late, bro! Welcome to the land of mid life,&quot; smirked Simon. &quot;Now, I want you to suck Coach Cameron&#39;s cock.&quot;<br />
	Jack obeyed Simon. He pulled down the coach&#39;s stinky jockstrap and lifted up his hairy belly. Jack then cautiously started sucking Coach Cameron&#39;s cock. <br />
	Jack kept sucking, until the coach came with a deep moan into Jack&#39;s mouth. Coach Cameron looked exhausted from having his cock sucked. He was panting, and his belly and breasts wobbled with every breath. Drops of perspiration were streaming down his round face and double chin.<br />
	Jack doubled over, his stomach churning. He stood up on shaky legs and looked in the mirror. To his horror, he could see himself already starting to change.<br />
	Jack&#39;s belly ballooned. It was now even bigger than Coach Cameron&#39;s. It sagged down past his own cock and balls to the middle of his thigh. His slight pecs also inflated, until they looked like large nipple-tipped pillows.His man breasts sagged down to rest on his mammoth belly. Jack also saw his legs, arms and butt swelling with fat. His thighs were now so fat that they rubbed against each other, Jack knew that from now on, he would have to waddle around to accommodate his tremendous thighs. Jack&#39;s face also rounded out and he grew two more chins. These chins swayed with every movement. <br />
       Jack&#39;s body also started to grow hair everywhere. On his legs, arms, ass, ass and pits. He now sported quite impressive thatches of pit hair. Jack also noticed that his belly and manly breasts were growing thick brown hair. Jack turned around and saw to his surprise, hair growing on his back. <br />
       &quot;Cheer up, bro. All men eventually get a hairy back!&quot; Joe laughed and ruffled Jack&#39;s hair. <br />
       He looked in the mirror and saw that his hair was thinning as well. He had a rapidly receding hairline and an expanding bald spot. Soon, all the hair on top of his head vanished, leaving him with a horseshoe fringe of hair around his head. He reached up and touched the smooth surface of his head. Jack&#39;s hair then started greying and he saw that a greying goatee was growing around his mouth. Lines appeared in his forehead and around his mouth and eyes. <br />
       Jack&#39;s transformation was complete. He simply stood there in shock. He had become a fat, hairy and balding man in his late forties. He looked ever older than the coach!<br />
        &quot;Remember, don&#39;t tell anyone about this or else. Now get out of here, bro,&quot; chuckled Simon.  <br />
        Jack turned and put on his clothes, noticing that the trousers and shirt he had been wearing had turned into shorts, a tank top and a jockstrap with some suspicious stains on it. They had also expanded to fit his fat body. He looked at himself, fully clothed, in the mirror. The shorts showed off his hairy and fat legs. And the tank top emphasised just how out of shape he was. A pretty impressive thatch of chest hair poked out from the top of his singlet, and tufts of his sweaty pit hair was still visible even though his arms were by his side. He could also smell BO coming from him. <br />
        Turning around, he waddled out of the locker room, now a fat, hairy and balding middle aged man</p>
