<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I warned you! It’s not over yet…</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zach’s room was everything Manny dreamed of. An ocean of dirty clothes and used towels littered the floor. Across from the door stood a huge, king-sized bed with invitingly soft bedsheets dyed in the frat house’s colours. A shield with the frat house’s crest hung above it, along with various posters of either muscular men working out or scantily-clad women strewn across furniture. To the right of the door was a small desk with college papers messily piled high upon it. A smorgasbord of colognes and body sprays laid on top of them. To the left was a small door that led to an en-suite bathroom.<br />
<br />
The room smelt glorious. The inviting musk of an alpha male entered Manny’s nose the second Zach swung the door open. His already throbbing cock was begging for release. <br />
<br />
The boy was barely used to his hulking form, and yet, it was beginning to grow again. His hormones were raging beyond what his mind was capable of, and it was starting to cloud his thoughts. When Zach dragged him towards the bed, he noticed he was actually standing taller than the jock, despite being the same height when he first stepped into the frathouse. He was still growing, unbeknownst to his crush.<br />
<br />
Zach pushed Manny onto the bed, the frame creaking under the sudden weight. <br />
<br />
Manny laid on the bed, looking down at his body.<br />
<br />
It was enormous.<br />
<br />
Two pecs puffed out of his chest like rolling hills. They were so big he couldn’t see the fields of abs beyond them. He raised his arms into view, and watched as huge biceps clung to them with veins so thick they pushed through the costume. His hairy hands travelled slowly down to his crotch, where he could fed his cock stir in the tight confines. His legs were too hide to properly grasp in one palm, and had the strength of five men. He was getting overwhelmed at his transforming frame.<br />
<br />
Zach silently admired the bulging Captain America before him for a brief moment, before slowly crawling on top of him, their faces mere inches away from each other.<br />
<br />
“Damn, look at that body” he said with a toothy grin, “I bet it looks better out of that costume.<br />
<br />
Zach leaned in and kissed Manny on the lips. Manny thought he was dreaming, but even in a dream he thought Zach was coming in a bit too strong.<br />
<br />
“Hey, uh,” he said, noticing the lower timbre in his voice, “I appreciate this. All of it, really. But I’m more of a take-it-slow kinda guy. I’ve—“<br />
<br />
“Shhhh,” said Zach.<br />
<br />
“Oooh…”<br />
<br />
Manny whimpered as he felt Zach reach for his cock and rubbed it slowly. Zach looked at it victoriously, before gasping at its size. Manny tensed as his cock grew another few inches, stretching the fabric of his costume out further. His balls also swelled out and was filling with his seed. He needed to cum so badly. The costume was too tight.<br />
<br />
He needed release.<br />
<br />
“From the looks of it, I think you like it when I go fast.”<br />
<br />
They kissed again, rougher this time.<br />
<br />
“But aren’t you straight?” asked Manny in-between kisses.<br />
<br />
“That’s just a label bro,” said Zach, “I don’t want men or women. I want you.”<br />
<br />
Manny didn’t respond, instead groaning as his body grew another few inches bigger. His body ballooned and his cock thickened until it matched Zach’s arm in size. The costume ripped in several places, most notable the inner thighs and forearms, where Manny’s muscles began spilling out. His crotch grew wet as he shot out a spurt of precum from the sheer pleasurable feeling. His mind was getting cloudier.<br />
<br />
<br />
He felt his body act on its own, leaning into the kisses with more strength. His arms and hands enveloped Zach, rubbing his muscles with great eagerness. Zach went to work trying to unzip Manny’s costume , but it was stuck between his pecs, and had broken from the growing body within.<br />
<br />
Manny let his body, his urges, take control.<br />
<br />
“Need…” he muttered, “…I…need…”<br />
<br />
His body radiated the wavy air like a furnace, as it filled the room in seconds. Zach breathed it in and gasped at its intensity. <br />
<br />
“Fuck, that smell. Your musk. Bro, I can’t stop breathing it in. It’s too much! I’m gonna—OH<br />
<br />
He moaned loudly as he reached for his crotch. His breathing was loud as his face began to sweat. Manny watched as a trail of cum trickle down Zach’s leg from under his leather-skirt. Zach came just at the smell of the huge man.<br />
<br />
That was when Manny fully let go.<br />
<br />
“Fuck foreplay. I want your cock,” said Zach, reaching for it again and rubbing the tick shaft with both hands.<br />
<br />
“I need…”<br />
<br />
“What do you need? I’ll do anything, anything to you,” said Zach, stripping off his gladiator costume.<br />
<br />
“I need…”<br />
<br />
Manny sat up, topping Zach into his lap, the jock’s ass pressing against his hungry cock. He reached for his helmet and pulled it off, revealing long hair that covered his face.<br />
<br />
Zach parted it and gazed upon Manny’s face.<br />
<br />
His eyes were devoid of conscious thought.<br />
<br />
His breaths were heavy and puffy.<br />
<br />
His gaze was hungry.<br />
<br />
That wasn’t Manny anymore.<br />
<br />
Or Captain America.<br />
<br />
It was a beast.<br />
<br />
“I need…”<br />
<br />
Zach waited on the beast’s every word.<br />
<br />
“Tell me,” he said.<br />
<br />
The beast suddenly grabbed the jock’s arm and pulled him closer.<br />
<br />
There were just centimetres between the two.<br />
<br />
“I NEED…” he yelled.<br />
<br />
Their lips were so close together.<br />
<br />
“…TO FUCK!”<br />
<br />
He roared as he shoved his tongue down Zach’s throat, who embraced it. The beast wasted no time; reaching for the tight zipper that hung between his pecs and setting the beast’s chest free.<br />
<br />
“Yes! Fuck me! Fuck me with your huge, thick cock!” he spluttered between breaths.<br />
<br />
Zach wasted no time either, peeling off what remained of the beast’s costume until his entire naked body was on full display; 8ft tall and glorious. He lifted Zach Until the jock laid on the bed with his legs in the air.<br />
<br />
The jock was too busy trying to take his own costume off.<br />
<br />
The straps on his leather-skirt were tangled.<br />
<br />
“Fuck!” yelled Zach with deep frustration.<br />
<br />
Manny held the straps in his large grip, and ripped them in half as if they were made of paper, which only made Zach more awe-inspired as his own lower-body suddenly sprung into view. A nicely-sized cock was red from throbbing so hard. Two smooth thighs were rippled with muscle. But what Manny liked the most, and what his hands grabbed with great vigour, were the two bulbous asscheeks that hung behind Zach’s waist. He had an ass big enough to take a dick half of Manny’s size, but that wasn’t going to stop him. He grinded his rump against the beast’s shaft, grabbing the bottle of body oil on the desk and using it to lube the beast’s beast.<br />
<br />
“I’m ready! Do it! Fuck me!” he yelled.<br />
<br />
“NEED FUCK!” roared the beast.<br />
<br />
Zach yelped as the beast lifted him high off the ground, and placed his ass on the tip of his member. It stretched his asshole as an inch slider in.<br />
<br />
Then two inches.<br />
<br />
Then five.<br />
<br />
Then ten.<br />
<br />
The feeling was indescribable.<br />
<br />
“HOLY SHIT!” screamed Zach.<br />
<br />
The beast’s cock slid in with ease, and before long the beast was pumping the jock with everything he had. Zach could feel it travel far into his stomach. He could feel it all. The pounding heartbeat that pulsates from it into his core. The intense heat that radiated from the tip right down to the base. The sweat that poured from the beast’s hair body onto Zach’s back. It was something no one had experienced before.<br />
<br />
A world of true euphoria.<br />
<br />
“NEED TO FUCK!” bellowed Manny as another spurt of precum shot deep into Zach’s ass, who moaned as the sensation of the hot liquid tickled him. Zach hadn’t stopped cumming the moment Manny laid him on the bed and his kids collected on his abs like rockpools.<br />
<br />
“Oh my God! Don’t stop!” he cried out, with all of his strength, “don’t ever stop!”<br />
<br />
Then, something happened.<br />
<br />
Something neither were quite expecting.<br />
<br />
The beast wasn’t done growing.<br />
<br />
“FUUUUUCK!”<br />
<br />
Like a balloon inflating, his muscles swelled as he grew even taller. The bedframe bent under his weight, the legs eventually snapping off as the bed fell to the floor with a loud THUMP! The beast’s face became lost in a river of thick facial hair, as it sprouted in waves right down his neck, and covering his pecs and abs. He looked unrecognisable from the perfect Chris Evans look-a-like he walked into the frathouse as. His hands grew around Zach’s waist and he held on tighter, with hair blooming on his knuckles.<br />
<br />
Zach looked up at the 9ft behemoth fucking him. The thrusts were so vigorous it was as if his body was being thrown around from the sheer force of them. His vision grew dizzy from the intoxicating smell of the beast’s musk, as it stank up the room in moments. The air grew hotter, until it was like a sauna, and the pair were dripping in their own sweat.<br />
<br />
Then Zach looked down.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit! You’re too big!”<br />
<br />
He cried, gazing upon the monstrous manhood that was impaling him. He watched with wide eyes as it grew even longer, and winced at the feeling of the shaft thicken in his ass, stretching it out even further. Manny’s balls grew until they were even bigger than the asscheeks they were slapping against.<br />
<br />
Zach could feel hot liquid inside him, filling him up. Manny’s potent seed was trickling out of his cock like a faucet and, judging from Manny’s intense thrusts, he hadn’t even climaxed yet.<br />
<br />
Until now.<br />
<br />
Zach knew he was helpless, and he braced for what was about to come. He was afraid, but enjoyed every second of it. His mind too became dizzy, lost in the urges the intoxicating hot hair gave him. He wanted more.<br />
<br />
The beast kept thrusting. Faster.<br />
<br />
Faster.<br />
<br />
Until—<br />
<br />
“ARGHHHHH!”<br />
<br />
The beast roared louder than any lion as he shoved his cock as far into Zach as he could. He tensed his stomach and flexed his arms as he leaned his head back, screaming so loudly the walls shook.<br />
<br />
Zach felt the beast’s cock throb, as a gushing stream of his cum flooded his body. He could feel it everywhere inside him, the hot liquid travelling up his body and filling his stomach out like a water balloon. Just when he thought it was over however, Manny kept cumming. And cumming. And cumming. Zach watched his abs almost disappear as his stomach began to inflate from holding so much, something he thought was impossible. Something he didn’t know was a side effect to the cum of a Yummies customer.<br />
<br />
“Oh God, there’s so much. Feeling…so full.”<br />
<br />
This went on for only a few minutes or so, but in that time the beast produced gallons upon gallons of loads, all within Zach who was so full he was starting to taste it in the back of his throat. The pleasure was too much for him, and he passed out before the beast finished.<br />
<br />
Once the beast did, he slowly slid his flaccid cock out of Zach’s ass, which immediately began to spill out his loads, and he laid back on the bed. His mind was empty, his thoughts were gone. Manny was gone. <br />
<br />
The beast realised, as his cock began to rush with blood, that his only desire was to do that all over again.<br />
<br />
And again.<br />
<br />
And again,<br />
<br />
Forever.<br />
<br />
Someone knocked on the bedroom door.<br />
<br />
“Zach! Come downstairs! There’s a guy outside who’s fucking huge and the entire frat’s getting it on with him! I think I saw Archie bounce on his dick! Not even fucking joking!”<br />
<br />
“Come in,” said the beast, his voice gristly and almost too low to understand.<br />
<br />
“Yo, what the fuck? Are you okay Zach?”<br />
<br />
The door swung slightly open, and a tall man with pale skin stood in the doorway. He was wearing the costume of an Olympic swimmer; dark goggles and a tight blue speedo. He did not have the body of a swimmer however; it was well-built and had round biceps. They would be seen as huge if he were not in the same room as the beast.<br />
<br />
He looked at the scene before him and his eyes widened. His eyes darted to the collapsed bed, then to a passed out Zach whose belly was plump and round, and then to Manny. To the beast.<br />
<br />
“WHAT THE FUCK!?” the jock cried out.<br />
<br />
He gasped, and breathed in the hot wavy air that emanated from the beast.<br />
<br />
His pupils dilated.<br />
<br />
His body became relaxed and his knees gave way.<br />
<br />
He fell to the floor with a loud moan.<br />
<br />
“Ahhh fuck!”<br />
<br />
He grabbed for his speedo as he came in them, his load collecting like a pool in the tight blue fabric. He didn’t care, his mind was being altered by the air.<br />
<br />
“Wow, you smell amazing! I need more.”<br />
<br />
The beast gestured for him to approach, and the man closed the door behind him. <br />
<br />
The beast got his wish.</p>
