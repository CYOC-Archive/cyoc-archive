<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Julie didn't have to much trouble finding her way through the palace.  She traveled to the north section of the palace where a party was going on in beautifully decorated ballroom.  When Julie stepped through the door she could see a large group dressed in silks just finishing some kind of music number.  At the far corner of the room, Julie saw a small orchestra and that they sounded quite nice.  Julie saw the seneschal and decided now was the time to announce her presence.  She went over to the man and told him what to say.  He looked ready to bolt but after a nervous swallow he announced her, &quot;Lady Julie, Messenger of the Dark Lord Kenan.&quot;  Julie could see that the Dark Lord really got their attention.  Especially the King and Queen who were at their thrones.  As Julie drew closer she decided she wouldn't have to deal with the king.  He was sloppily dressed and the front of his shirt was stained with wine.  He had been feeling up one of the server's, much to the Queen's chagrin, when Julie had announced herself.  The Queen, however, looked like a toad on its lily pad.  Fat and squat, the woman's face seemed to be in a perpetual frown.  Julie strode across the dance floor, the nobles parting way before her.  When she was at the base of the dais leading to the thrones Julie gave the monarchs a small curtsy.  A fact that made Julie slightly grimace as she had planned on bowing but decided a curtsy would work just as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your Highness, Your Majesty.  It is a pleasure to come before you this day.  I am sorry to disturb your merry making but I felt this was too important to waste.  You see my master demands your unconditional surrender.&quot;  Julie knew she had to be blunt if she was going to get anywhere with these two but she could already tell that the Kings attention was beginning to wander as he looked down his waitress's dress.  The Queen was more than willing to talk to her though, &quot;How dare you disrupt the millennial celebration of the founding of our kingdom.  I, Lady Dolores, would never accept such terms.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think you have much of a choice.  Two days ago, my master captured the village of Facile Victum and even now, begins to build a mighty fortress there.  It won't be long till he comes here and takes what he wants instead of asking nicely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He will have a hard time taking this place no matter how strong he may be in magic.  This city holds over three thousand wizards, and together we will stand strong against any threat that comes our way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Three thousand?  My that is an impressive number but tell me, what about the civilians outside the walls.  They won't survive a serious siege to the town.  Would you sacrifice the five thousand people out there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Queen Dolores, sniffed amused.  &quot;They are mere dogs who seek scraps from the table of their betters.  It wouldn't even be a loss.  Only those with wands are important to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie eyes widened in anger at the casual dismissal of so many people.  &quot;What about the magical creatures that dwell in this land?  What measures will you take to protect them from Kenan's invasion?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Those vile beasts?  I wish this Kenan the best of luck in destroying them.  I know I haven't been able to control them.  Speaking of control...&quot;  Dolores pulled out her wand and pointed it at her husband's hand which had found it way into the waitress's top and waved it.  The king cursed as he removed a red spotted hand out of the girl's top and dark pustules oozed on the woman's breasts.  The girl cried out before running off.<br />
<br />
Incensed by the Queen's pleasure, Julie eye's turned a light red and her pupils became slits.  &quot;You know you're a real bitch.&quot;  The Queen gasped but Julie pressed forward, &quot;You mistreat the people who don't have magic.  You hate the people who do have magic.  Then you think the people who can shape magic are so special.  That's a horrible attitude to have.  Like thinking that anyone who doesn't need a crutch to walk is inferior to you because you do.  You need your wand to make anything happen, otherwise you're just like the people outside the walls.  I'll tell you again, your magic will not save you from Kenan.  Use it to see the horrors he has created from the survivors at Facile Victum and weep knowing you have refused the only hope of survival.  You have only one chance now.  Kenan demands your unconditional surrender and the two magical artifacts as the sign of your surrender.  The Cloak of Invisibility and the Shade Stone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He expects us to surrender the Hollows? He is a fool, we will protect them to our dying breath. Guards seize her.&quot;  Dolores smirked.  Her expression turned to a frown however as Julie's clothes began to change until they were a black leather tank top and mini-skirt.  Everyone froze and watched her with rapt attention as her legs stayed the same length but her torso stretched till it was two feet taller.  Two arms burst from her sides and at their ends were large clawed hands.  Julie also received a second pair of breasts below the first which made her tank top into bra.  The tight material curving along her curves.  Her face gained a wolf's muzzle and ram's horns curved out of the sides of her head.  Julie saw her feet had become large paws and a bushy tail had pushed itself out of her spine.  Crimson fur, the color of freshly spilled blood, covered her body and she drew her sword, red flames flaring across the edge of the blade.  The closest guard was unprepared when Julie shoved a lower hand through the man's breastplate while grabbing the man's sword with her free upper hand.  The blade darkened to black, in her hand, before flames appeared on it as well.  Everyone was screaming then as blood gushed from the man's chest wound.  Julie lept up the dais and shoved both of her flaming swords into Dolores chest before turning to the King.  The man had soiled himself in terror but after a calculating look, Julie lept down into the crowd and began killing indiscriminately.  Using her swords, false arms, and fangs.  Some of the guests tried to fight back using their wands but any spells they cast at her were ineffective.  Realizing the futility of it they tried to escape.   <br />
<br />
Meanwhile the guards responded to the alarms that were going off.  They responded quickly but Julie had already killed seven people in that time.  They started rushing toward her but it wasn't till after her twelfth kill that Julie received her first wound.  The man's blade slashed her thigh and with a shriek, Julie brought down a clawed false hand on the man's neck breaking it.  In the time it took to do it, her wound had already closed.  Julie took down four more before she was struck again.  This blade glowed white and cut burned.  Julie lashed out at him but the champion blocked her and forced her back.  Julie looked around to see that more troops with runed blades were coming.  Knowing her time was up, Julie feinted with one of her blades, swung with another and struck with a false hand.  The result being to much for the man, his head was cleaved off by her blade and the smell of burnt flesh filled the air.  Sheathing her weapon and tossing the other aside she charged the window to the outside and broke through, dropping 50 ft.  <br />
<br />
She landed lightly and looking side to side was surprised to see the old guard she had seen on her way in.  Baring her fangs she got ready to charge when the man grabbed his silver chain and tore it off, throwing it to the ground.  &quot;You told me I would be accepted in your master's army.  I'd like to take you up on that offer.  My one condition is that you meet my friends.  Is it a deal?&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie barely recognized her own voice when she spoke.  It was dark and powerful.  Full of rage.  &quot;If they are the local rebels, then I was planning on seeing them anyways.&quot;<br />
<br />
The old guard nodded, as if he had expected it.  &quot;My name's Remus Lupin.  I'll lead you to the camp to pick up my family and then we'll head to this army of yours.&quot;  With the words out of the way Remus changed into his werewolf form and the two of them ran off, leaving the sound of the wounded and the noble ladies weeping as they cradled their dead husbands, fathers, and brothers.</p>
