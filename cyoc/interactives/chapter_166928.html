<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Kids, we&#39;re leaving!&quot; Amy yelled up the stairs.<br />
Eric stood in the bathroom still dripping wet and was very tentatively drying his body off with a towel.  He heard Mia leave her room and the heavy foot steps as she went down the stairs.<br />
&quot;Eric?&quot; Amy yelled.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m coming!&quot; Eric yelled back and then cringed as he heard his shrill voice, amplified by the acoustics of the bathroom. <br />
Thankfully the mirror was fogged, so avoiding his reflection was a fairly simple task as he pulled the long sleeved t shirt over his wet head and pulled it down.  The hem fell low and tight around his hips and butt, clinging to the wet skin.  He picked up the black leggings and unrolled them, turning them right side out.  Curious, he put the crotch to his nose and then recoiled. The damp material reeked of vaginal body fluids and ass.<br />
<br />
Grunting and straining he did his best to pull the leggings up and over his damp legs.  The material fought his efforts and he stopped when he could only get them up around his thighs.  Panting he felt a droplet of sweat roll down his cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;This body is so out of shape&quot; he muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric!&quot; he heard once more from his mother.  &quot;I&#39;m getting dressed&quot; he yelled back, that sounds more like a screech to his new ears.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath he gave one more effort, finally getting the waist up and over his large backside and hips.  He quickly brushed his teeth, marveling at how different the toothbrush felt in his mouth and tried in vain to ignore the cool, damp material that sucked it&#39;s self  tight against (and into) his nether region.  Leaving the towel on the floor, Eric opened the door.  He felt his nipples instantly harden in the cooler air.  Walking awkwardly into his room he squinted and fumbled around on his night stand for the glasses his Dad had given him.  As the room came into focus, he grabbed his phone, a charging cord, ear buds and slid the flip flops on before leaving.  He looked back before leaving the room, hoping the next time he sees it he would be back to normal.<br />
<br />
Slowly navigating the stairs, one step at at time with one hand on the rail, the other arm across his chest in attempt to keep the movements on his chest to a minimum he met his father and mother in the kitchen.  &quot;Everything OK?&quot; Amy asked him pulling wet hair out from beneath the neck of his t shirt.<br />
<br />
Eric just grumbled.  He felt dirty, even though the shower did feel good, the dampness in his crotch was extremely annoying and with the skin tight material not giving any opportunity for the area to dry out, this was going to be a long term problem.<br />
<br />
James came over and tried to hug Eric, who pulled away.  &quot;Be good and help your Mother.&quot; James said.  &quot;Take this&quot; he handed Eric Jule&#39;s drivers license.  &quot;You might need it&quot;.<br />
<br />
Eric looked at the drivers license in his hand.  Jules Catherine Stewart.  5&#39;2 185 lbs.  Birthday 6-14-1969.  &quot;Jesus&quot; he thought.   This body was born in the 60&#39;s he mused but also intrigued with the titillating idea of being able to drive. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll hold onto that&quot; Amy said and snatched the driver&#39;s license from Eric and putting it into her bra.  &quot;You still only have a learners permit.  &quot;Go on out, I&#39;ll be right behind you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric rolled his eyes &quot;Mom, geez&quot; he whined and walked out into the garage.<br />
<br />
James looked at Amy.  &quot;I love you&quot; he said and kissed her.  &quot;I&#39;ll be talking more with Sean today, and I&#39;ll let you know if something comes up.  Lay low up there and try to not worry.&quot; <br />
<br />
Amy teared up a little.  &quot;Just be careful&quot; she said and put her arms around James&#39;s neck.<br />
<br />
The moment was interrupted by the sound of  two women arguing in the garage.<br />
<br />
Amy and James walked out to see what the fuss was about.<br />
<br />
Eric looked over at them.  &quot;Mom tell Mia to get in the back seat&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was here first&quot; Mia yelled<br />
&quot;I&#39;m the oldest and I need more legroom&quot; Eric responded.<br />
&quot;Not anymore!&quot; Mia shouted which sent Eric into a sputtering rage.<br />
&quot;Well...so... but....I am too!&quot; he finally spit out<br />
<br />
Amy sighed.  &quot;Eric, Mia was there first, you can switch later.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric slammed the door closed and opened the sliding back door and struggled into the back passenger seat.  The car seemed so much taller and he had to use the handhold to pull himself up because he no longer had the leg strength to do it without.  Finally he huffed and puffed until he flopped is rear end into the seat.  He cringed as he felt the moist flesh squish between his legs and car seat.  Reaching up he struggled again as he tried to get the seat belt to fit comfortably across his chest.  The shoulder strap felt tight across his chest and dug into his nipple with a sensation that was more of irritation than pleasant.<br />
<br />
James and Amy looked at each other and laughed.  &quot;Good Luck&quot; James said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks&quot; Amy replied sarcastically.  &quot;Sure you don&#39;t want to go and I&#39;ll stay?&quot;<br />
<br />
James laughed and opened the garage door.  It was still dark outside and would be for the first hour or so of their drive.<br />
<br />
Amy kissed James one last time and got into the car and started the engine.  She waved as she put the car in reverse and backed out into the early morning darkness.  <br />
<br />
James walked out and watched the taillights disappear out of the cul-de-sac.  He stood there for a while, just watching perhaps to see if anyone followed.  After a few minutes, satisfied that at least nobody saw them leave from the neighborhood he grabbed the morning paper and went inside.<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
All of the drama earlier was lost as Amy drove and Eric and Mia slept for the next two hours.  <br />
<br />
Mia awoke and looked around blinking in the bright sunlight.  &quot;Are we there yet?&quot; she asked and adjusted her glasses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Getting close, another hour or so&quot; Amy said.  &quot;We&#39;ll stop for some breakfast at the next town&quot;<br />
<br />
Mia nodded.  &quot;Good, and I could use  a potty break&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too&quot; Amy replied.  She looked back at Eric still asleep, his head resting on a rolled up sweatshirt against the window.  Legs spread out, one up on the bench seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy? Is there anything to do where we are going?&quot;  Mia asked<br />
<br />
Amy thought.  &quot;I don&#39;t know sweetie, it&#39;s a nice place from what Daddy said.  There is a lake, which is about all I know.&quot; she said.  &quot;We can probably play games, and I&#39;m sure there is TV&quot;.<br />
<br />
The car slowed as they approached the next exit.  Eric stirred and sat up.  &quot;Are we there?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just stopping for some breakfast and potty break&quot; Amy said.<br />
<br />
Eric stared out the window as they turned off of the freeway and onto a side road then finally pulling up to a convenience market.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are...are we going in?&quot; Eric asked not excited about being in public.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we shouldn&#39;t all go in at once.  I&#39;ll go in and order something to go.  Does anyone beside me need to use the bathroom?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
Mia jumped at the chance.  &quot;I do&quot; she said urgently.<br />
<br />
Amy looked around.  There were only 2 other cars in the parking lot.  &quot;OK, she said.  You and I will go in and Eric, do you need to go?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric was embarrassed to say yes, but he did slightly nod his head.<br />
<br />
Amy grabbed her purse and exited the car.  Mia opened the door and got out, and stretched. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll send Mia back out when she&#39;s done&quot; Amy said and closed the door.<br />
<br />
Eric sat and waited, now that the idea had been broached he did need to pee.  Grabbing his phone he tried to distract the uncomfortable feeling.  After what seemed like an eternity, Mia came out of the store and opened the passenger door.<br />
&quot;Nuh uh&quot; Eric said. &quot;Mom said we would trade&quot;<br />
<br />
Mia stuck her tongue out at him and got in anyway.<br />
<br />
Eric wanted to stay and argue but he really needed to pee badly so he got out and walked quickly to the front door.<br />
<br />
The bell rang as the door opened causing a few heads to turn to see who was coming in.  A couple of locals were sipping coffee at the register talking about the weather and politics.  Eric looked around, trying to ignore the glances and finally located the restroom...or restrooms.  He made his way and tried the knob, it was locked.  &quot;E&#39;hem&quot; he hear and looked back where a guy stood.  &quot;Line starts here lady&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Eric bit his lip and walked behind the guy.  Finally the door opened and his Mom came out.  The guy in front of him went in.  &quot;Do you want anything specific?&quot; Amy asked.<br />
<br />
Eric could only think of one thing.  &quot;No&quot; he said and pressed his legs together.  If is mom said anything else he didn&#39;t hear it.  Finally he heard the toilet flush and the guy came out.  Eric burst into the restroom and locked the door.  Practically ripping the leggings down, he turned and sat barely before the hot stream shot out of him.  He adjusted his seat and cursed.  &quot;Son of a bitch!&quot; he said as he realized the guy before him had pissed all over the toilet seat.<br />
<br />
Having learned his lesson about how uncomfortable a wet crotch can be, he wadded up some toilet paper and dried off and then stood and did the same to his butt.  &quot;Fucking asshole&quot; he muttered and pulled his pants back up then washed his hands.<br />
<br />
Walking out the lady at the register asked if he was OK.  &quot;You were just in there hon&quot; she said.  Eric paused.  &quot;Oh, that was my sister&quot; he said.  The guy who went in the bathroom before him was paying for a pack a cigarettes.  Eric walked up to him.  &quot;You need to work on your aim asshole&quot; he said.  The guy looked down at him, and then stared at his breasts.  &quot;Sorry ma&#39;am, nice tits&quot; he said.  Eric walked away  &quot;Ma&#39;am my ass&quot;  He walked up to their  car and opened the passenger side door.  &quot;Get in the back Mia&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Mia could tell he was upset and didn&#39;t argue.  Once they were all strapped in, Amy started the car and got back onto the interstate.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened in there?&quot; Amy asked Eric.  &quot;You are clearly upset.&quot; she said concerning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing&quot; he replied.  &quot;Nothing. Happened.&quot; and for the third time in two days he found himself crying again.</p>
