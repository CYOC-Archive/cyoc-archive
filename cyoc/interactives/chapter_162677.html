<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I never believed in magic, or until now, as from seeing and knowing my son is now a horse!” A sullen sounding Bob Morrison said. “I can understand how this happened and whether I was to like having again my prize stallion back in the fold, the cost was of losing my son. The bigger trouble is that before the evening diner time I must inform my wife, and Jared’s mother, that for the weekdays and nights he will be eating two of his daily served meals while stabled in the barn.<br />
<br />
This magic coin, this Medallion then spread its curse, as from Jared having the coin in your pocket and making use of a horse blanket; my Jared became as well another added to the Medallion as a cursed individual, and became as was Jasper!<br />
<br />
Do you know how fortunate you are my son?<br />
<br />
By chance or by some fool choosing you took from the pile of blankets, the one last used by Jasper. Know then as well, if I understand what this magic coin, this Medallion does, as had you taken a blanket from the top of the pile…<br />
<br />
This gray blanket I use on Tilda, she a pony mare; just imagine if you were now as another pony mare?<br />
<br />
As then this brown blanket I keep separate for use with Mildred, another mare!<br />
<br />
This rusty red colored blanket was last used by Sammy, a gelded donkey I kept for when the mares wanted to smell a male but the donkey could not impregnate; so he was for them as good company.<br />
<br />
What I do not fully understand is why this Medallion spirit would allow my Jared to bargain, authorizing the giving of him as a choice to return to his mostly human self on the weekends, now that baffles me, can the Medallion spirit explain?” A wondering father seemed to note that there had to be more as told of why his son was gifted something that others might not have had as a given.<br />
<br />
“Yes my Master, as before the curse was fully set, and while young Jared had begun his transitioning of species and form, he made a wish to gain the ability, or the power to being as his human self on the weekends. My powers and purpose was set for applying the curse as it was meant to be a curse. Young Jared made a wish to broaden the curse, and this required special authorization from the Demon who first created me and applied the curse to the Medallion’s present owner.<br />
<br />
If you would consider what Jared did, was some fast thinking to plead his desired wish before a powerful Demon! <br />
Know too, as he was already seeing his body as changing, your son did an exception rationalized bargaining with a Demon not planning ever to gifting of transition powers. Jared realized from his religious teachings given to him, that animals do not have a soul, and by his becoming an animal, a horse, a stallion, he would join the throngs in hell some day.<br />
<br />
His want for using the horse blanket was to keep warm and never had he the wished desire to become a horse, as either a mare or stallion!<br />
<br />
Jared made note as to your family history, of your grandfather being a minster, and his brother being a missionary, as was your older brother a pastor, a of you Mater teaching Sunday school and catechism classes. These facts the Demon knew were true, and as his desire being to change the path of a history, he agreed to give Jared the ability to become as human; or mostly human on a weekend.<br />
<br />
As a devil made my spirit self and as during my many centuries of existence; I must state that never, as not any of those my powers cursed had the mindset, or awareness of what Jared had to make such a request. Jared has impressed me, and that is saying something, since he was a first. As well that you, his father has since become as my new Master, I suspect you as do I would wish to try to help, as guide Jared through a lifestyle and future what neither of you had as so planned for him.<br />
<br />
His equine journey began with the animal spirit known as Jasper that when sparked to life, it did take full control, and smelling of Mildred as in estrus, he went to mate with her. The act of breeding was not by the wishes of your fine mindful son. As his life entity and the learned knowledge he had gained from being schooled, the horse mentality of Jasper gained by the merging. The two life forces made an agreement, affording the desires of Jared as blended with brute beast that was Jasper. As such they have found reasons to respect the other while residing within one body.<br />
<br />
Indeed, as from my curse has evolved a companionship and friendship that through the coming years, shall define the character of a prize stallion used as a stud!” The Medallion spirit had so well explained, but there was still the need to inform a wife and the mother of Jared, as about her son being not as he was born.</p>
