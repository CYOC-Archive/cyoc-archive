<br />
As the days went by and the major drama of November and December passed; the town of Moon lake became peaceful for a time. Eric Anderson a white furred were-panther aced his end of year exams; helping Spencer and Frieda study allowed them to pass with respectable marks. Spencer now sixteen recently got her driver’s license; bringing fear to both Eric and Frieda’s parents of her tearing up the road in a large pickup truck that her grandfather got for her. The big surprise came with the three bonded lovers when both Eric and Frieda realized they had the exact same birthdate; while the two had a small party and gathering with their families. It was later in the evening when Eric. Frieda and Spencer celebrated with a wild rut in the woods.<br />
<br />
True to her father’s words; Frieda had a limit placed on her credit card. After the three hundred grand Telsa sports car she got for her mother for Christmas, Benton wanted to make sure his daughter didn’t become a shopaholic. While Amanda was understanding of the whole credit limit; she wasn’t exactly calm when she found out Frieda now had an after school job. The job was mostly babysitting; minding smaller children while their parents go out for the evening to relax and unwind. This job allowed her to get hands on experience for when she would become a mother one day. With Eric and Spencer joining her on a few nights of babysitting; mostly to help her handle Cindy, Jasper and Yogi who despite being a little older, the three were-tiger cubs were still just as destructive as ever.<br />
<br />
Spencer, watching her mother’s belly grow and swell with a child; she was a little heartbroken upon finding out that after the first month of pregnancy it was advised to refrain from shifting into your fursona. The energy required for the change could harm the fetus as the body shifts and readjusts; possibly causing a premature birth of worse. So throughout her pregnancy; Maggie was human looking. This doesn’t mean she was alone. Her husband Evan, a black furred werewolf and their daughter Spencer; a werewolf/panther/feline hybrid were helping Maggie along with her pregnancy. Placing a paw on her belly to feel the fetus kicked both made each other pleased; emitting happy growls. Finding out that she will soon give birth sometime in mid September of two thousand sixteen; Evan with the help of his father Mike, had the spare room turned into a nursery.<br />
<br />
Back over with the Knight family; Benton was still bi-polar. He’s still a ruthless business man, but has managed to become a better father. Making time to spend time with Frieda has been a difficult struggle for him. What with work running Knight Industries, doctor’s appointments with Abigail Robinson at Moon Lake Hospital and Doctor Frances Twist to discuss his issues and undergo anger management. He has become a better person. After the mandatory thirty days imposed by the elder council passed; he and Amanda took off for a romantic holiday for two in Turks and Caicos. Leaving Frieda alone with a small house staff; Ethyl and John now married but still at their regular duties. She the cook and he the chauffeur. While Amanda could not get the rest of the staff to come back; she did manage to hire a new butler and a few maids to help keep the house clean.<br />
Lance Knight and Lila Carpenter are now husband and wife. Getting married shortly before Anton and Esmeralda had to go back to their retirement island; the wedding was a small but wonderful affair. While both Rick and Lila did try to get ahold of their parents; their attempts were not successful so they could not see their daughter tying the knot. While Lance wore a custom fitting tuxedo; it was Lila that wanted to buck the traditional white wedding. Walking down the aisle in her were-tigress fursona and wearing only a veil; being led on by Cindy who was easily elected as flower girl. The ceremony was quick and joyous as well as the reception dinner that they had at Grrrrrrr. The honeymoon was anything but quick; flying off to France to kick off a European vacation; they never got far from their honeymoon suite as the two could not keep their paws off each other.<br />
<br />
It was when they came back from their honeymoon that Lilia began working full time as a CPA for Knight Media. Her audit of KPXX revealing several questionable accounting irregularities that cost more people their jobs and charges of fraud and theft among several. Suggesting to Lance that the Were Club would turn a bigger profit if instead of open only on Saturday evenings; it would also open its doors on Friday evenings as well, was at first met with some resistance. But once word got around; the new operating hours for the “club” became too big of a hit not to ignore. With the extra money coming in; Lance was able to fund several renovation projects to help make the building safer and give it a much needed face lift and expansion.<br />
<br />
Seeing his wife belly beginning to expand; Lance soon realized he was going to be a father. While wanting to wait a bit before starting a family of his own; he was thrilled to see Lila come back from the hospital with and ultrasound photo showing the tiny embryo growing within her. Still being too early to tell if it’s a boy or a girl; Lila still in the first trimester of her pregnancy, Lance knew he had to give serious thought to moving into a bigger house.<br />
<br />
Nate Anderson now a year older and oddly enough growing a beard; has finally found his future career path, Landscaping. Mowing lawns and trimming hedges as well designing garden layouts; Nate was gob smacked at how much money there was to be had in yard work. Sure the jobs would be seasonal and work would potentially stop during winter, but the money he was making was just too good to resist. While his job did keep him away from his girlfriend Jean Talbot, she was equally busy with her work. Juggling time with her course work at the college and helping her father out at the elder council building; both werewolf and were-lioness were lucky to meet up once or twice a week. Yet when they did; the forests around Moon Lake grew still for the load celebratory roars and howls the two gave off when embraced in each other’s fur.<br />
<br />
With Martin Stovall officially resigning from Mayor to assume the duties of Andrew Curtis as the wer-mer rep; Samatha was thrust into the job of mayor pro-tem. Her first action was to bring influence peddling charges against Arnold Stewart Stevenson. The were-donkey scoffing at Samantha for trying to bare her claws at him; his bravado was soon turned into begging and pleading when he saw the footage Samantha secretly recorded of him trying to muscle in on the construction of the new elementary school. With the rest of the council and city hall seeing the slippery politician being dragged away in cuffs; they knew that the new mayor is not someone you could try and manipulate or scheme against. With her briefing with Martin before he and Melissa swam off to Hawaii; she got a complete rundown on all of the other council members and their dirty tricks. She knew most of them and thanked Martin for the info; him handing over a file with the town’s financials as well as various account numbers gave her a better sense as to how Martin was able to put the town in the black. While they went over the issues that would soon need to be discussed; it was Frances and Melissa having another chat amongst themselves. Not about Julie, but regarding the son Alyssa Cooper had.<br />
<br />
Finding out that Alyssa had a son named Darrell and now being cared for by Douglas; the only family the five year old boy has. Melissa’s first reaction was to suspect that Martin was the father. Martin vehemently denying it and Sheriff Cooper also stating to the fact; even showing the Stovall’s the birth certificate of Darrell. Seeing the name Rick Fernando as the father did not allay Melissa’s suspicions; even during their getaway to Hawaii. It was after they got back that Melissa wanted to be absolutely sure that Martin was not Darrell’s father. Demanding a paternity test and then having to deal with a pissed of were-grizzly after finding out both Martin and the sheriff were telling the truth. Her belly only beginning to show her pregnancy after Darrell’s paternity test was done in late February . She had to be rushed to the hospital for fear that the stress of the whole ordeal could result in the loss of her baby. The ultrasound later determined that the fetuses were fine and Melissa and Martin would soon have twins. The two wer-mers were blown away from what they heard. Twins was a rarity for weres. The last twins being born were from the Carpenters seven years prior. Martin thrilled that he was going to be a father again, but with twins; hugs his wife who too was also happy with the news.<br />
<br />
With the Sheriff; taking care of a rambunctious child was becoming a full time job in on itself. With Joan Morningstar helping to raise Darrell; it wasn’t long before the two started to have romantic feeling for each other. Waking up one day to see Joan in her were-tigress fursona snuggled up to him in bed, with his large grizzly paws wrapped around her; Douglas was at first worried he might inadvertently harm her. But hearing her purr as she buried herself deeper into his embrace, it wasn’t long afterwards that the two were getting to know each other on a more intimate level. Darrell who was now attending school for the first time was making lots of friends; still excited to see people in their fursonas, only now has he begun to stop calling Sheriff Cooper, uncle Yogi. Enjoying the time Frieda Knight and Eric Anderson comes over to mind him as Joan and Douglas head out now and then; he was always thrilled to see the two shift into their were-panther fursonas in front of him.<br />
<br />
Brian Walker along with his mother Emily have both had an exciting few months past Christmas. For Brian it was spending many a romantic snowy evening with his were-beaver girlfriend Patricia. The two eventually consummating their relationship; Patricia was swooning and sighing in delight as she had her very first rut. With her beaver tail slapping the water’s surface as the two made love in the lake. It wasn’t long after that everyone in school knew she and Brian were an item and that you could not tear each other apart; regardless that she is sixteen and he turning fifteen in march, both had a deep love for each other.<br />
<br />
Emily’s excitement on the other hand was more to do with her deadbeat husband George Walker and the Elder council. After listening to the threatening message he left on the machine; it wasn’t long after that the lecherous were-otter was picked up by police, prowling around town. Sitting in a jail cell, George was furious that Andrew Curtis visited him and hand the man a scroll of the elder council. In it, it stated that he had to make restitution for his son and ex-wife; only then would they assist in having him being declared dead reversed. Fuming that he could not leave town and had payback what he did; George thumbs his nose at Andrew by ripping up the scroll and telling the retiring wer-mer where to shove it. He was soon transferred to the cell in the elder council to a wait having to explain his actions to the council its self. But Emily’s fortune’s have been looking better; after taking that Saturday shift in which she bagged the biggest tip of her waitressing career, she was able to pay off all the bills that were overdue and still have some money leftover to save. Not being underwater with a ridiculous mortgage thanks to George and the council helping out; Emily slept well for the first time in decade. <br />
<br />
Speaking of the Elder council; the matter of the Seattle chapter of the Luna brotherhood going rogue with its duties. It wasn’t long before the head of the organization from Romania stepped in to help resolve the situation. Stripping each werewolf of their position within the Luna brotherhood; some of the disgraced weres to ashamed of themselves attempted to take their own lives. Requesting Tachibana’s assistance in rebuilding the Seattle chapter; the head Alpha asked if Randolph the werewolf rep would like to lead the reformed chapter. Randolph laughing as he thought this was a jape; soon said no as he had his own family to look after. His mate giving birth to their first pup on Saturday during the snowstorm, his son; it was the happiest day of his life. Howling in celebration; not caring if it is still daytime as he ran through the woods in joy.<br />
<br />
Lastly; with Jack Crawford trying to oust Benton during the annual shareholder’s meeting, the young business man was shocked to see Anton Knight present and speaking on behalf of Benton. Thinking the old man retired; Jack was unaware that Anton still had a controlling interest in the company he founded. Acting as Benton’s proxy; Jack’s attempt to remove Benton failed. Not having enough of the votes and those content to let Benton run the ship, despite his recent medical issues coming to light; Jack was forced to concede this round to the Knights. Refusing to go quietly into the night; Jack Crawford has still vowed to regain his birthright. Finding out that Crawford Computers is now held in trust for Benton’s daughter Frieda; the scheming were-panther starts planning his next attack.<br />
<br />
With it now Friday September second, two thousand sixteen in Moon Lake; a few days from the start of the new school year; Eric, Spencer and Frieda who as usual been sleeping together in either the Lawson, Anderson or Knight household begin to wake up. Each in their fursonas and purring upon seeing the other snuggled next to them; their green eyes flashing as they each sense the love from their special union. Spending the night at Eric’s snuggled up in his room as his parents were using the basement; Each file out into the hallway seeing Nate in his werewolf fursona, along with his girlfriend Jean Talbot in her were-lioness form. All five smile as they knew what each other did last night; with the waning days of summer break coming to an end, nearly the entire town is alive with the sounds of weres mating in the woods and indoors during the night.</p>
