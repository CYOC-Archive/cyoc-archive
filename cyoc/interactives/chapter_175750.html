<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh, thank God, Brandon, I was worried something had gone even further wrong than my tests indicated.&quot; That was...suffice to say not the response that Brandon expected. He...she...whatever, went into this expecting to hear the doctor gloat over her fate in becoming a woman, or, a person the old Brandon would&#39;ve pumped and dumped in a single day. But worry? Worry made Brandon actually feel scared, because it was not what he had expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doc, I need some answers ASAP, tell me what&#39;s going wrong.&quot; Brandon scowled, thinking about how in the world a drug designed to retrogress someone and eliminate cancer could possibly involve a change at this fundamental level. No silver linings, this was something she needed put to rights as soon as possible. <br />
<br />
There was a pause at the other end. &quot;Well, do you want the bad news or the worse news?&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, that was always really encouraging now wasn&#39;t it? Brandon demanded, &quot;Just...tell it all to me straight. No delays.&quot; As far as Brandon was concerned this had to be the worst it could get...well, unless it involved regressing all the way to a fucking infant. That&#39;d be pretty awful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the bad news is that in a certain percentage of transformed test subject animals the chromosomal alteration took place that resulted in complete gender inversion, resulting in male animals becoming female and female becoming male. But that&#39;s not all.&quot; Dr. Jannes seemed rather freaked out by the next part, &quot;We...may have a potential infection on our hands of the sexually transmitted sort. Because after two successive penis insertion into vagina sexual intercourse incidents, a subject not included in the test group underwent a similar transformation to what the partner it copulated with did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...English, doc, please.&quot; Brandon said in a quiet voice. Even though she was readily starting to realize what it was Jannes was talking about. Exactly what her impatience and desperation had wrought.<br />
<br />
A long sigh on the other end of the phone call, &quot;It&#39;s contagious when fully inoculated, and achieves a reduced spread through bodily fluids. In other words, you fuck someone twice, and they&#39;re going to turn female. And even one sexual episode will likely result in changes.&quot; <br />
<br />
Brandon immediately remembered Elijah, pulling him into the room...and letting Elijah fuck her in the pussy. She had been so desperate to get off, and she&#39;d pulled Elijah in on what turned out to be a significantly dangerous situation. Which she had not even known about because she...had not told the doctor after she displayed these kinds of changes. &quot;Fuck...I could&#39;ve prevented this from getting out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Getting out?&quot; Jannes audibly slapped himself upside the face over the other end of the phone convo, &quot;You fucked someone. You fucked someone already and that person is out there half inoculated...Brandon, Brandi, whatever you want to go by, you need to keep away from...whoever it was. No matter what, do not indulge any further.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Elijah left for work.&quot; Brandon gulped, wondering what would happen with Elijah, &quot;Well, I&#39;ll be in touch if anything else...happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please do. I don&#39;t want this exploding out of control. I didn&#39;t even do this on purpose!&quot; Jannes hung up, and it sounded like he was mortified by how things had progressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Brandon spoke aloud, &quot;Just don&#39;t fuck Elijah again. Simple as that. Hopefully the serum...cycled out of her body or something. She couldn&#39;t go well without sex. Brandon knew she wanted to get back to how she was, but until then, she was gonna have her needs...<br />
<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
Elijah had been feeling unreasonably warm since leaving Brandon Whyte&#39;s place. He looked in the mirror briefly, seeing his dark, wavy hair and bright blue eyes, as well as his tightly toned, muscular build. He wished he could say that he didn&#39;t do stuff like that too often. But the women who ordered from there were often single and willing to mingle. So why should he say no? But just thinking back to it left Elijah uncharacteristically feeling another erection coming along.<br />
<br />
Fuck, he thought, usually he can just get moving and head back to work. But there was no going into a swanky place like that with a boner like this. Elijah grinned and thought back to his most recent fuck. Whoever that chick was, she was rich, eager, and loved his bod. Most of his conquests did too. But she was something else. She almost seemed hungry for him.<br />
<br />
Parking his car behind a store and giving an excuse in a brief call to the restaurant that traffic was bad, Elijah fished out his manhood. He noted as he wrapped a hand around it that it was much more sensitive and seemed to twinge at the touch. &quot;Ooh,&quot; he moaned, &quot;Heavenly...heavenly...&quot; He started eagerly rubbing it, almost feeling himself involuntarily kick his leg in response to the sheer stimulation.<br />
<br />
He was sweating so much...fuck.<br />
<br />
Elijah tried to cool himself off, but it seemed his body was just hot today. Everything he tried did not really seem to work. The delivery man groaned and felt his body jerk a bit. He pushed his hair out of his eyes, pondering that he was gonna need to get his hair cut again soon. He loved his wavy, dark locks, but they always needed these cuts to keep from getting too long...surely that wasn&#39;t his hair tickling at the middle of his neck!<br />
<br />
As he felt up his own body, noting his abs seemed in particularly good condition today, his fingers happened to hit the newly more prominent set of nerves in his nipples. Elijah almost thrashed around in his seat from how good that felt. He never really encouraged his girlfriends to do nipple play on him, but if this was how he felt from it, that might well change his mind. Even as Elijah played with his nipples some more, feeling them get more sensitive still, he gasped, &quot;Fuuuuck, it&#39;s like how the women talk about their fuckin&#39; boobs...&quot;<br />
<br />
Elijah for some reason felt his manhood jerk a bit and then something changed in it - it almost seemed half an inch smaller and vastly more sensitive. Which for whatever reason was far more than Elijah could handle. He almost screamed from pure pleasure as he blasted out another heavy load all over his dress shirt and pants. He&#39;d...he&#39;d need to replace those with his spares in the trunk...<br />
<br />
Elijah breathed and wiped off his forehead. He was gonna need to get a change of clothes from the trunk - where he always kept a spare of his work clothes in case he got dirty for one reason or another - and probably...probably go find another woman for the night. But as he thought back to &quot;Brandi&quot;, for some reason she was even more prominent in his mind.<br />
<br />
The Delivery Man stepped outside and got his clothes, heading into the passenger seat to get changed. In the process however Elijah saw that his body was...different. His body hair seemed by far more sparse, his muscles delineated and more visible but slightly decreased in mass. He turned and looked in the mirror on the car. He saw his head hair was longer and thicker, more luscious. There was no hint of facial hair on him at all.<br />
<br />
And his cock, it seemed half an inch shorter (Elijah would know based on how much he used it). Something fucking happened to him. Elijah numbly got dressed again and thought about where to go from here... for some reason he was thinking about &quot;Brandi&quot; again. But he also needed to get back to his job...</p>
