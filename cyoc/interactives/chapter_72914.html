<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty and Dustin then decided to go outside and walk around. After a few minutes, they reached the soccer field. <br />
Ty quickly changed into his soccer uniform while Dustin wandered around until he noticed his girlfriend, <br />
Robyn, who was sitting in the top row of the bleachers, all by herself.<br />
<br />
Robyn was 17 years old and about 5 foot 4 inches tall. She was a cheerleader for the football team and she had <br />
also played on the girls' soccer team in high school. She had blonde hair which she often had tied in a <br />
ponytail and she liked to wear jeans and t-shirts to school. She was short and athletic and Dustin had just <br />
recently started to hang out with her because of her bubbly personality. She was very popular and well-liked <br />
in school, and almost all of the guys and girls in the senior class knew her. <br />
<br />
Dustin walked up the steps and decided to sit next to her. At first, she didn't really want to talk, but she <br />
finally opened up to him. She looked rather sad as she stared out over the soccer field before her.<br />
<br />
"Hey Dustin!" she said softly. She was happy to see him, but she had hoped to be in a better mood.<br />
<br />
"Robyn! Hey! Why the sad face, girl?" Dustin wondered.<br />
<br />
"Ohh… Isn't this the team that your little brother plays on?" she asked him.<br />
<br />
"Ty? Oh yeah! He's on this team! Sometimes he's the goalie, but I think they're letting him start out as a <br />
defender today!" Dustin replied.<br />
<br />
Robyn let out a deep sigh as she stared back at him.<br />
<br />
"All the players on his team are boys!" she groaned. "That really sucks! They got such a fun team!"<br />
<br />
"Yeah! They're undefeated!" Dustin remarked. "Look! There comes Ty now!"<br />
<br />
Looking down at the field, the two spotted Ty as he came running out of the locker room, wearing his black <br />
cleats, black shorts, blue socks and his navy-colored jersey. <br />
<br />
The boys were still very early and they had to get off the field in order to allow the opposing team to warm <br />
up. In the meantime, Ty had spotted Dustin and Robyn sitting in the bleachers, so he quickly ran up the steps <br />
and sat down next to Dustin.<br />
<br />
"Hey! We're gonna have a good game! Glad you two can stick around and watch!" Ty cheered.<br />
<br />
"No problem, bro!" Dustin smiled.<br />
<br />
"Umm well… I'd rather be playing on your team…" Robyn said sadly. "I used to play on the girls team, but your <br />
team is so much better!"<br />
<br />
"Robyn! His team is all boys!" Dustin whispered.<br />
<br />
"So, that doesn't matter!" Ty grinned. "We can always use more players!"<br />
<br />
Ty quietly wished for Robyn to have the urge to go to the ladies' locker room. Then he wished for Robyn to <br />
gradually transform into a handsome, athletic, muscular young man!<br />
<br />
"Excuse me, you guys! I gotta go to the bathroom!" Robyn said, as she stood up and quickly walked down the <br />
stairs until she went to the ladies' locker room.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ty went down to the field, knowing that Robyn was experiencing a slow, gradual change…<br />
<br />
Robyn walked into the locker room and quickly closed and locked the door behind her. She then crept into the <br />
empty stall and took a leak. Afterwards, she walked up to the sink, which was before a large mirror, which was <br />
hanging from the wall, to wash her hands, when she began to feel something strange and unusual.<br />
<br />
Although the temperature in the locker room had not changed, she felt like she had become hot and sweaty all <br />
over. Her forehead, her hands, her face, her arms and her chest were completely drenched in sweat. It was <br />
almost as if she had come down with a fever or a hot flash of some sort.<br />
<br />
"Oh crap! I hope I'm not coming down with something!" she said to herself, as she examined her reflection in <br />
the locker room mirror. Drops of sweat were crawling down her face, her arms and her chest. Was it hot in <br />
there?<br />
<br />
She began to notice that there was something weird going on with her hair. It seemed a little shorter in the <br />
front and in the sides. Her ponytail certainly felt shorter. She was sweating bullets by now and felt like she <br />
had to take off her clothes.<br />
<br />
She removed her shoes and her jeans first, before finally removing her socks, her t-shirt and her bra. It had <br />
almost become unbearable in the locker room, and just had to remove her clothes. She felt like she was dying <br />
of the heat in there, and it felt good to just be naked for a few minutes.<br />
<br />
Next, she reached over and removed the rubber band, holding her hair together in the back. When her hair came <br />
loose, it seemed… much shorter!<br />
<br />
"My hair!" she gasped. Her hair seemed to be getting shorter in the back, and in the front!<br />
<br />
As she was examining her hair in the mirror, she suddenly noticed something else as she looked around the <br />
locker room. For some strange reason, everything seemed… smaller!<br />
<br />
"What the heck? Am I getting taller?" she wondered, as it appeared as if she had grown three inches taller, <br />
out of nowhere!<br />
<br />
"What… What the hell is going on?" she asked out loud, as she looked down at her legs and her feet.<br />
<br />
Then it became even clearer that something was changing about her. Her feet, which were a woman's size 8, now <br />
looked bigger! Her toes had grown longer and her feet had grown wider! Why, her feet were at least two inches <br />
longer than before! They seemed too big to be women's feet! Furthermore, her legs seemed several inches longer <br />
and slightly more muscular. Her calves seemed to be thicker, and a fine coat of hair had begun to form over <br />
her legs! What woman has hair on her legs? Lastly, her quads were thicker and more muscular as well!<br />
<br />
"Ohmygosh!" she gasped. "This can't be happening… Can it?"<br />
<br />
While Robyn stood naked before the mirror, she was suddenly overcome by an odd tingling sensation in her <br />
glutes. First, her feet, her calves and her quads had changed and grown to become longer and hairier. Now, she <br />
felt something in her buttocks and her hips. <br />
<br />
She took two steps away from the sink so she could see what was happening to her body, gasping at the sight of <br />
her reflection in the mirror when it dawned on her that her hips were slowly becoming less wide than they were <br />
previously.<br />
<br />
"What the heck?" she shouted, as she turned sideways. "No! No way!"<br />
<br />
Her butt, which was always her prized feature that every boyfriend, past and present, has loved about her <br />
figure, slowly began to deflate before her eyes! The big, round spheres of muscle slowly deflated until they <br />
were flat! It was almost as if she was starting to gain the figure of a… Guy!<br />
<br />
"My butt! Where the hell is my butt?" she shouted. "It's GONE!"<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Robyn, that wasn't the only thing she was going to lose that afternoon. Something else was <br />
about to disappear from her body, permanently!<br />
<br />
Robyn was going crazy! She was turning to the left side, and then she turned to the right side, staring at her <br />
flat butt in the mirror. In fact, she was so focused on her butt, that she didn't even notice the weird <br />
tingling sensation in her vagina! She had become incredibly aroused for the moment. Her pussy was very wet, to <br />
the point where she was dripping cum! That weird tingling sensation had intensified around the center of her <br />
groin area as well, where a small hole and the stubble began to appear.<br />
<br />
"Uhhhh…. I feel so turned on right now…" she groaned as she closed her eyes for a moment. What was happening <br />
to her?<br />
<br />
In the meantime, her pussy began to shrink more and more, while the little stubble on her groin began to grow. <br />
It started out as a baby-penis, as it was only an inch long. But her vagina suddenly closed up completely and <br />
her inner tubing rearranged them, when she opened her eyes again.<br />
<br />
"I feel really weird on the inside…" she moaned, as she looked down at herself again.<br />
<br />
When she reached down with her hand, where her pussy would have been, she felt something…<br />
<br />
"Eeeeek!" she shrieked. "My pussy is GONE!"<br />
<br />
She quickly turned to face the mirror for the second time when she discovered that a strange appendage was <br />
slowly growing from her groin… A penis!<br />
<br />
"What is THIS???" she gasped as she reached down and grabbed hold of the growing penis, which was slowly <br />
coming out from her groin, along with two small testicles which were sprouting from the base of the small <br />
penis. "How can I have a penis? Only… Only guys…. Have… penises!"<br />
<br />
Then it dawned on her. The hair, the muscular legs, the cock and balls… is she turning into a GUY?<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, the cock reached a respectable length of about six inches, with two very good looking balls hanging <br />
underneath. She looked down and stroked her hand over the side of her new, soft dick. Right away, it sprang to <br />
life, causing her to feel a surge of pleasure coming over her entire body.<br />
<br />
"Ohhhh man!"<br />
<br />
As she looked down at her penis, she began to notice other changes! Her flat stomach no longer looked that <br />
flat anymore. Nice, deep ridges formed over her stomach, as well-defined rows and columns formed, giving <br />
definition to her abdominal muscles. <br />
<br />
Then, her breasts, her pride and glory, her C-cups, began to tingle all over. <br />
<br />
"Oh no! No no NOOO! Don't take them away!" she shouted, as she desperately tried to grab and hold on to her <br />
breasts with her hands while she saw them shrink and felt them dwindle away like deflated balloons. Within <br />
moments, all that was left of her breasts were two flat pectorals, with nipples on each one.  Now, her pecs <br />
inflated slightly, but this was due to her gaining more muscle. But the pointy breasts were completely GONE!<br />
<br />
"Oh man! I don't look like a girl at all!" she exclaimed, as the tingling sensation moved further upward.<br />
<br />
A thin coat of hair began to sprout on her armpits, causing her to feel the itching sensation everywhere. <br />
Finally, the tingling and the itching traveled down her arms, causing her biceps, her triceps to inflate into <br />
larger muscles as well. Her lats and delts inflated on her shoulders, giving her the V-taper. Finally, the <br />
tingling reached her neck and her throat.<br />
<br />
"Ohh man…. When is this gonna over?" she groaned, noticing the deeper, baritone voice. "Holy frick! I sound <br />
like a guy!"<br />
<br />
She turned to the mirror again. This time, there was no mistake. She wasn't a she. She was a HE. HE was a boy, <br />
a young man, named Robin now. Every indication that he used to be a girl had disappeared from his figure. His <br />
physique had completely changed. During the ten minutes or so that he was in the girl's locker room, he had <br />
completely transformed into a boy!<br />
<br />
"Crap! How do I get outta here? I'm naked!" <br />
<br />
He reaches down and rubs his cock, causing it to harden for a few moments until cum begins to flow. He stands <br />
there, at first, not knowing what to do. Then he slowly walks up to the mirror and examines his new body and <br />
his new, male identity.<br />
<br />
"Wow… I'm a BOY! Holy smoke! I can play on the soccer team now!"<br />
<br />
He smiles as he checks out his face, his muscles and his body. <br />
<br />
"This… This is so COOL! I LOVE this body!" he grins. <br />
<br />
Then, out of nowhere, Ty appears in the locker room.<br />
<br />
"So, do you like being a boy now?" he says.<br />
<br />
"I love it! This is the BEST body EVER!" Robin says to him, as he flexes his muscles.<br />
<br />
Ty reaches over and grabs his cell phone from the counter and snaps several pictures of Robin, who is still <br />
completely naked standing before him.<br />
<br />
"Wow! Thanks, Ty!" he says to him.<br />
<br />
"Ready to play on my soccer team? We need you!"<br />
<br />
"Sure!"<br />
<br />
Ty snapped his fingers, and Robin was instantly dressed up in black cleats, blue shorts and socks, blue jersey <br />
and everything, ready to run on the field.<br />
<br />
"Uhh… What will Dustin say when he sees that you changed me into a boy?" Robin asked Ty.<br />
<br />
"He'll get used to it! Don't worry!" Ty assured him, as both boys ran on to the field.<br />
<br />
Dustin was looking on from the bleachers, wondering where Robyn was, when he saw Ty run on to the field with <br />
another boy…</p>
