<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie’s comment lingered in Jake’s mind as he helped clean the clutter of dirty dishes from his girlfriend’s sink. It was all in preparation of a double-date that evening with Liz and her boyfriend Josh, but just what that evening would entail could only be left up to the imagination. And right now, with Katie flirtatiously prancing around in her figure-clinging PJ’s, eagerly eyeing his crotch on several occasions; Jake’s imagination was firing on full cylinders.<br />
<br />
Not only was Katie’s silent but intense stares getting to him, but he was still struggling to come to grips with his new-found five-inch flaccid dick. Any sudden movement made his upsized cock-head slap against his inner thigh as it hung loosely inside his boxers and left his dick teetering in a state of semi-arousal, resulting in a healthy bulge in his jogging bottoms.<br />
<br />
Despite the stark size difference to his usual dick, he tried to play it off, if only for Katie’s sake; after all, she was under the impression that he’d always been this size.<br />
<br />
Yet, Katie’s unabashed fascination went no further than lengthy looks of longing and the occasional foray of her hand between her legs. Jake wondered worriedly whether she was reserving judgement until she was able to match him against Josh’s ‘Really Big Cock’. Sure, he was hung well above average, but how would he measure up if Liz’s bragging wasn’t all bravado? Would the girls go for a cock-measuring contest? And what if he lost? Would his enhancement have been in vain? He found himself wondering whether he shouldn&#39;t have gone even larger - ensured that absolutely no-one could compare. He couldn&#39;t upgrade himself for several hours still; Liz and Josh would be here in four.<br />
<br />
However, in Jake’s mind, the time flew by, and too soon the doorbell rang, bringing him out of his inner conflict to the outer realization; the hour was upon him. Katie gave him a wry wink and a quick kiss on the cheek before darting off to the bathroom for a last minute touch-up, leaving Jake to greet their guests.<br />
<br />
Pausing for a second, he exhaled to calm his nerves before opening the door. He was immediately met with Liz, an attractive brunette with a bit thicker build than Katie, heavier around the waist, yes, but substantially larger in the chest and hips. Katie had a pair of pert, yet impressive D’s if not DD&#39;s, but Liz’s breasts blew her out of the water, sizing up at what Jake suspected was a whopping G-cup at the least. Her features were a little too sharp for Jake&#39;s tastes, though that did little to detract from her spectacular rack. Next to her however...<br />
<br />
Jake looked up and tried to suppress a gulp. Josh had to be close to 6&#39; 6&#39;&#39; and built, with broad shoulders and a heavy upper body that betrayed a weightlifting regimen. Already outsized in height, Jack briefly glanced downwards to try get a preview of what he may have been packing, but Josh was wearing cargo pants that could have easily hidden any length of lead pipe. Of course, that&#39;s probably what you would wear if you were hung like an elephant, he thought gloomily.<br />
<br />
As the couple&#39;s sat down for a simple dinner with light conversation, Jake kept catching glances between Katie and Liz. They&#39;d clearly agreed something over the phone - Josh, on the other hand, seemed oblivious to the two&#39;s scheming, making only cursory contributions to the conversation and spending most of his time eating.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that was lovely,&quot; remarked Liz to Katie after they finished dessert, &quot;My compliments to the chef.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate smiled graciously, &quot;Why thank you. And look, it&#39;s barely past eight o&#39;clock - why don&#39;t you two stay for a few? I’ve a nice little game we all can play.&quot;<br />
<br />
The game turned out to be a simple tabletop Katie had picked up from a second-hand store - slightly worn, with some of the pieces missing, it worked like a mix of ‘snakes and ladders’ and ‘truth or dare’. Truthfully answering simple questions or performing simple favors, a player could get an extra dice roll. However, failing to complete a task or getting caught in a lie meant that the other player could steal all their progress…<br />
<br />
With each couple playing as a team, things started mundane enough, the two men being gentlemen and asking for simple things like kisses while the women extorted various promises of housework, things soon got more raunchy as innocent favors turned to salacious teasing and idle gossip becoming raunchy inquiries. It all came to a head, as near neck and neck for the majority of the game, Josh eclipsed Katie on the final stretch to land on ‘Truth’, a single dice roll away from the finish. It was there that Katie sprung her trap.<br />
<br />
“Who’s packing more in their pants; Jake or Josh?”<br />
<br />
Though Josh was supposed to be the one to answer, Katie fixed a determined gaze on Liz making it clear she intended for her to answer. Despite the intensity though, Liz seemed totally unperturbed, “Well that’s obvious,” she returned with a smirk, “It’s Josh.” She answered matter-of-factly to which Josh nodded and gave the dice for a final roll; six, putting him well past the finish line.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like we have a winner,&quot; Josh laughed lightheartedly, reaching to move his piece, however Jake was quick to protest. &quot;Not necessarily,&quot; he said testily, realizing he was getting annoyed in spite of himself.<br />
<br />
Ignoring Jake and putting his piece past the finish line and onto the final square, Josh chuckled and leaned back confidently,  &quot;Come on dude, you&#39;re like half my size.&quot; He stretched his thick arms over the back of the chair showing off his strapping chest and huge muscles in the process, &quot;You think there&#39;s gonna be any difference in a cock comparison?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s got a point…&quot; interjected Liz, resting her massive melons on her folded arms and leaning forward, &quot;And the proof to back it up too.&quot; Not to be outdone, Katie adjusted her décolletage for a spectacular display from her higher, firmer pair. Jake found himself already getting hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m willing if you are,&quot; Jake responded combatively, crossing his arms. Who did this guy think he was? So caught up in the grandstanding, he didn&#39;t bother to check Josh&#39;s size via his watch as Katie went and got a ruler.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Liz was letting Jake know just how &#39;little&#39; of a chance he stood against Josh. &quot;You should just give up now before you&#39;re embarrass yourself.&quot; She smiled wryly, running a hand over the front of her, purposefully emphasizing her substantial breasts. &quot;I know you guys like to brag about your size if you manage to top six or seven inches, but I&#39;m telling you now, unless you&#39;re hitting double-digits, you&#39;re wasting your time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Double-digits? No way…&#39; Jake thought, but he couldn’t help but worriedly look towards Josh, particularly his crotch where a prominent bulge was already forming in deference to the baggy fabric of his cargo&#39;s… Catching his glance, the broader built man gave a smug self-assured smirk and likewise crossed his arms over his chest.<br />
<br />
Too late did Jake think of the watch and tried to nonchalantly aim it towards Josh. His measurement of 7.5 faded away and was soon replaced by the figure of 8.1. Over a half an inch more length than his own dick!  &#39;Damn!&#39; Jake thought to himself, turning his attention from the watch to Josh&#39;s crotch as the man started stroking the clearly defined outline of his growing cock through his shorts, &#39;He really is huge!&#39; With the big man already past half-way to a full hard-on, there was no way that he could reduce his size without letting on that something was up…<br />
<br />
As Jake mulled over his options, Liz caught on to his trepidation and gave a smug smile, &quot;What&#39;s a matter; having second thoughts?&quot; No bothering to wait for an answer, she moved herself closer, giving Jake a good glimpse into her deep cleavage and lowered her voice to a sensual whisper so that only he could hear. &quot;Tell you what, if you back down now and admit to Katie when she gets back that you&#39;re no match for Josh, I&#39;ll make it up to you later.&quot; She gives a wink as she backs off, dangling a safe(r) way out of this predicament.</p>
