<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I want to change back&quot; Declan whined.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanted to be a girl&quot; his mother said. &quot;Now you have to live with your decision.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I only wanted to see how it felt to be a girl&quot; Declan whined.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you will&quot; his mother promised. &quot;Now we need to give you a new name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want a new name&quot; Declan whined. &quot;I like my name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be silly&quot; Karen said. &quot;You have to have a new name. Declan just doesn't sound right for a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How about Daisy?&quot; Katie suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like it&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So do I&quot; their mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't&quot; Declan said pouting.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't have a choice in the matter&quot; his mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't answer to it&quot; Declan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will unless you want to be punished&quot; his mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No punishment could be worse than this&quot; Declan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I can think of one&quot; his mother said. &quot;I could go get some girl's diapers and make you a baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
A look of horror crossed Declan's face at his mother's words. That would be worse than the situation he was in now. At least now he could still find a way to transform himself back somehow. He wouldn't be able to do anything if he was a baby. &quot;Not that&quot; he said backing up a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you better answer to your new name then Daisy&quot; his mother said. &quot;Do you understand me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; Declan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what is your name?&quot; his mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's Daisy&quot; Declan said as he hung his head in defeat.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's good&quot; his mother said. &quot;Katie, go get your spring flower dress for your sister. Make sure to bring a pair of stockings and shoes to go with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mom&quot; Katie said with a giggle. She left Declan's room with a bounce in her step.<br />
<br />
Declan heard the front door open and his older sister shout &quot;Mom, I'm home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come up to Declan's room&quot; his mother shouted back. &quot;He has something to show you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please Mom, let me change back&quot; Declan begged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe later&quot; his mother said.<br />
<br />
Denise came in then and asked &quot;Who's this? She looks like Katie did when she was seven. And why is she only wearing undies?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She used to be Declan&quot; their mother said. &quot;Now she's Daisy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Mom, this little girl can't be Declan&quot; Denise said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes she is&quot; their mother said. &quot;He changed himself with this medallion and an old pair of Katies undies.&quot; As she said this she retrieved the medallion and showed it to Denise.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way!&quot; Denise said her eyes widening. &quot;That looks like the Medallion of Zulo.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What does it do?&quot; their mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If someone wears it and touches an article of clothing to it, it would transform that person into the person who last wore that article of clothing as they were at the time&quot; Denise said. &quot;There is a catch though. It will only transform the same person again after 12 hours have passed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then, it looks like your going to your party as a little girl Daisy&quot; their mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, please don't invite my friends over&quot; Declan pleaded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think they have the right to know what happened to you&quot; his mother said. &quot;After all, you may be a girl for a long time to come.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I never wanted to be a girl for more than a day&quot; Declan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't know what it feels like to be a girl in a day&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Karen's right&quot; their mother said. &quot;So you can plan on being a girl for a long time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; Declan said in a defiant tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Daisy, do you want to become a baby girl?&quot; his mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; Declan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then, you need to be a good girl&quot; his mother said.<br />
<br />
At that moment Katie came back in carrying a flower print dress, stockings, and black Mary Janes. &quot;I have what you wanted Mom&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good&quot; their mother said. &quot;Now, help your little sister get dressed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mom&quot; Katie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Denise, I need you to go to the store and pick some stuff up&quot; their mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going to be doing?&quot; Denise asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to call Daisy's friends for the party&quot; their mother said. &quot;Karen, I want you to go through Daisy's closet and put all the boy clothes you find in bags. After that you and Katie can get her old clothes out for Daisy.&quot;<br />
<br />
All except Katie left Declan's room. Katie approached Declan and said &quot;Alright pipsqueak, time to get your dress on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you calling a pipsqueak?&quot; Declan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why you of course&quot; Katie said. &quot;You are younger and smaller than me now. Now let's get you into your dress.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; Declan said.<br />
<br />
Katie smiled and said &quot;If you don't get dressed I'll tell Mom. Do you want to be a baby girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; Declan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we need to get you dressed&quot; Katie said.<br />
<br />
Just then Karen came back in carrying some bags for Declan's clothes. &quot;You haven't started getting Daisy dressed yet?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'm about to&quot; Katie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You might want to hurry it up&quot; Karen said. &quot;Mom told Denise to get two packages of diapers. One for a girl and one for a boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie turned white when she heard this. &quot;Mom's going to use the medallion as a punishment for us?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like she may&quot; Karen said. &quot;I think Denise thinks the same thing since she turned white when Mom said that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry&quot; Declan said. &quot;I just wanted to know what it felt like to be a girl. I didn't mean for this to happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you didn't Daisy&quot; Karen said. &quot;We need to get the stuff Mom asked us to do done. Just in case Mom is thinking about transforming us as a punishment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll help after I get dressed&quot; Declan said.<br />
<br />
Declan didn't fight Katie as she dressed him. In spite of his earlier appeal to turn back Declan really didn't want to. He had wanted to see what it was like to be a girl, he just didn't want anyone to know it. Once he was dressed he felt better than he thought he would. He had liked the feeling of wearing panties and now he was enjoying it even more. At least now he wouldn't have to pretend to be a girl on line.<br />
<br />
Katie and Karen were holding up various outfits to Daisy to check their size when their mother came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'm glad to see that you're not fighting your sisters Daisy&quot; their mother said. &quot;Your party will be in about an hour. Just remember that you'll have to explain to your friends what happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mom&quot; Declan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of party is it Mom?&quot; Katie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why a birthday party of course&quot; their mother said. &quot;Daisy now shares your birthday Katie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But my birthday was last month&quot; Katie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know&quot; their mother said. &quot;And Declan's was to be next month until he decided to become a younger you. It just seemed reasonable to have Daisy's birthday party now instead of waiting. Come to think about, those undies that Daisy's wearing disappeared around this time two years ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
Declan blushed and looked at the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Declan took them and then used them to become Daisy?&quot; Katie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; their mother said.<br />
<br />
An hour later Declan's friends arrived and started talking about what this party was suppose to be. Some of them were thinking that it was an early birthday party. Well they were right about being a birthday party. They just didn't know it was a late birthday party. Declan stood at the top of the stairs listening to his friend's conversations. He wasn't looking forward to telling them that he was now a girl. They didn't know about his fetish so he was wondering if he could pass this off as an accident. He pushed that idea away. His mother would transform him into a baby girl if he tried that. No, he was going to have to tell them that he wanted to be a girl for a little bit.<br />
<br />
His mother came up to him and said &quot;It's time to tell your friends what you did to yourself Daisy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Declan nodded and headed downstairs. Once he was on the patio he said &quot;Um... hi guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well hello there&quot; his friend Steve said. &quot;What's your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Daisy&quot; Declan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You must be Declan's cousin&quot; Steve said. &quot;You look just like Katie. Funny thing though, Declan never said he had any cousins.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's because we don't&quot; Declan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what is your relationship to Declan?&quot; Steve asked. &quot;I mean you have to be related to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Declan took a deep breath and said &quot;I was Declan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve burst out laughing. After he stopped he said &quot;What an imagination you have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's true Steve&quot; Declan said. &quot;I was Declan. I found the Medallion of Zulo and decided to see what it was like to be a girl. I held a pair of Katies undies up to the medallion and I transformed into Katie at seven years old. My Mom walked in on me and took the medallion from me. She said that I would know what it's like to be a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on&quot; Steve said. &quot;You're not Declan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Declan thought that they wouldn't believe him but he needed to try to get them to believe. &quot;I can prove that I'm Declan. Last summer we went swimming and we each had a leech attach to our dicks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I never told anyone about that and I know that Declan wouldn't have told anyone either&quot; Steve said with wide eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;What a joke&quot; Josh, another of Declan's friends, said. &quot;Do you honestly think that we'll believe this. Come on out Declan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was Declan&quot; Declan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is getting old real quick&quot; Josh said. &quot;I know that you're in on this Steve. Come on, quit trying to pull our legs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is no joke Josh&quot; Steve said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on out Declan or we're leaving&quot; Josh said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm already here&quot; Declan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Declan doesn't seem to want to end this joke&quot; Josh said. &quot;Come on guys, let's go.&quot;<br />
<br />
All of Declan's friends left except for Steve. &quot;Thanks for not leaving Steve&quot; Declan said after everyone else had left.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe you Declan&quot; Steve said.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Daisy for now&quot; Declan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You do look cute in that dress&quot; Steve said.<br />
<br />
Just then Declan's mother came out with a cake. She looked around and asked &quot;Where did everyone go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They left because they thought I was playing a joke on them&quot; Declan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well at least you told them&quot; his mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about school?&quot; Steve asked. &quot;Declan can't go like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First of all Steve, her name is Daisy now&quot; Declan's mother said. &quot;Second, I'll enroll her in first grade.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I have to go back to first grade?&quot; Declan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as you're a seven year old girl, yes you do&quot; his mother said. &quot;Fortunately we have a week until school starts. I hope that it's enough time to get the paper work in order.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What paper work are you talking about?&quot; Declan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well the paper work to legally change your name and age&quot; his mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;There wouldn't be any paper work to legally change my age&quot; Declan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure there is&quot; his mother said. &quot;I've heard of a case where someone regressed in age. She had to go through a special process to get her age legally changed but she was able to get it changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if you change me again?&quot; Declan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll cross that bridge if we come to it&quot; his mother said. &quot;Now, let's get your party started.&quot;<br />
<br />
Declan's mother lit the candles on his cake and his family and Steve sung happy birthday to him. 'I wish that I was myself again' he thought and tried blowing out all the candles. He was only able to blow out six of the seven candles with his first breath. After he blew out the candles he opened up his one present. It turned out to be a doll. The rest of his party passed with Declan enjoying himself.<br />
He knew he shouldn't be enjoying this but he was. The question now was if he would go back to his old self if given the chance. He didn't know if he'd even take being older again.</p>
