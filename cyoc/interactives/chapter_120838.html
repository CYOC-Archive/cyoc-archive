<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I woke up and tried to move. I can&#39;t move... I can&#39;t feel my arms or legs. I took stock of my body. It felt like I was only a mouth with a long throat. My lips were very puffy, bee-stung. My mouth was opened a little bit. I must be out for a while as I felt a little drool dripping out of my mouth. I tried to swallow but that didn&#39;t work. My drool was dripping out in a long string. I could feel that the string of drool was connected to the floor. The salty musky taste from before was still there. <br />
<br />
I moved my lips a bit, trying to bite hard but as soon as I released my grip my lips again opened automatically. I again tried to close my mouth. It felt so nice to do that. My whole body felt great as i opened and closed my lips. I soon found that I was starting to drool more. The string hanging from my lips was getting heavier as more drool escaped from my mouth until it was too much and the droplet fell down. Half of the string of grool shot back in my mouth and was added to the newly formed puddle of drool which I can&#39;t get rid of. It slowly dribbled down my mouth to where I think my chin must be. <br />
<br />
At that moment I was hit in the face by my memory of my transformation. Right! I am a vagina! A pussy! I&#39;m just laying on the floor leaking juices! Shit. That Jennifer cursed me without knowing it! <br />
<br />
My sight returned to me at the moment I was moved. Someone must&#39;ve picked me up. I could see two big pillars on either side and I tried to speak: &quot;Hewwosh! Helwb mwee! I canf moovv&quot;. As I did I could feel my lips, or labia as I should call them now, move and little splatters of juices spat everywhere. &quot;I havvvssj been transfjormedtsh in a pufshy!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck!&quot; I heard another voice say back to me. &quot;Wait&quot;!<br />
<br />
I felt myself being moved again. Suddenly I saw my view being moved and the two pillars moved. I had to look twice before I recognized Jennifer. She looked so skinny and small. It looked like she lost all her curves. Her breasts were small topped by tiny pink hard nipples. The skinny naked girl was looking straight at me with a puzzled look. As I moved my view from her breasts downward toward her most intimate place, her vagina. It was swollen, pink and wet. Her puffy lips were opened and I could see her labia. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jebbifer...&quot; I wanted to say. But I saw her swollen pink vagina moving it&#39;s lips as a little splatter of drool flew out of my mouth, I saw that Jennifers vagina was dripping juices. I was not looking at Jennifer directly. I was looking at a mirror. I am Jennifer&#39;s vagina! <br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle? Is That you?&quot; Jennifer asked me. <br />
<br />
&quot;I guesch show&quot; I answered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I think you look really good&quot; Jennifer said. I could already feel her arousal spreading through me. The salty taste of pussy became stronger as more grool gathered in me. I stared at the vagina I now was. Swollen brownish lips covered with a little stubble with pink wet flesh in the middle. A little juice gathered on the bottom of my vertical slit mouth and slowly started dribbling down towards the floor. I looked at it and felt it at the same time. The smell, my smell, was getting heavier in the air. The smell of pussy. The taste of pussy. But somehow also the hunger of a pussy. I wanted to be filled. I want a full mouth. I want something inside of me.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to admit that I like you Kyle. I would do anything for you. I am so sorry for what I did to you. But I&#39;m gonna make it up to you.&quot; Jennifer said. <br />
<br />
I somehow in my haze of pleasure remembered that I dared her to fall in love with me and do anything for me. So now that I am her pussy, She must still love me. This all went so wrong! I am a vagina, the vagina of the person I used to hate. Who now loves me, her vagina. How will this work? How can she love her own vagina. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle, I want to fuck you&quot; Jennifer said as she got closer to my mirror. She spread her legs further and I felt my mouth open up more. The vagina in the mirror also opened up and I could see inside myself. Jennifer was slowly moving her hands down her neck to her breasts. Her right hand started kneading her small breast and I could feel heat spreading through my lips and my labia. Her juices, no, my juices were now flowing through me. I tried to close my mouth to force Jennifer to act on my need. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh Kyle! That feels so nice! Go on!&quot; I heard Jennifer say. But that is not what I wanted. I wanted her inside me. I again opened and closed my mouth. I saw her left hand slowly reaching down her other breast, touching her hard nipple and slowly tracing her body down to me. As she reached the end of her tiny flat stomach I could feel her hand on my forehead. She slowly moved her hand through the tiny stubble and reached the top of my mouth. Her finger touched my clitoris and I saw myself in the mirror slowly contracting as pleasure shot through me. The tiny vagina in the mirror looked like it was begging for her fingers. <br />
<br />
I was begging to be fingerfucked.<br />
<br />
My grool was making a puddle on the floor. The weird taste was no longer an issue. I wanted her to fuck me. Finally her fingers were moving up and down my slit. I made her fingers wet to invite her inside of me. She kept slowly teasing my labia, gently touching my clitoris. And finally putting one finger in my waiting mouth. &quot;Hmmmffssshhh&quot; I involuntarily said while juices spat out of me over her hand. I could hear Jennifer moan too. She started pumping her finger harder and deeper in me. The pleasure was a pleasure I have never felt before. Being filled felt so good. Then she put two fingers in me. That felt even better! As she pumped away my arousal was peaking. When I thought I could not take it anymore I was moved. <br />
<br />
Jennifer turned and now I was stuck in the air. And looked at the ass of Jennifer in the mirror. I was placed between the two globes of her ass. Right in her thigh gap. Jennifer looked behind from her doggyposition in the mirror right to me. &quot;I love doggy&quot; she said. I could see her tiny tits swinging a bit while they hung from her chest. Her nipples pointing toward the ground. Her hand soon entered me again and I could only let her fuck me. Masturbating. Her three fingers inside me fucking me harder and harder my arousal reaching newer levels until we came! With her hand still in me I came pulsing with juices spraying the mirror and her hand. I contracted so fast and hard. Jennifer was moaning so hard someone must&#39;ve heard. <br />
<br />
When i slowly stopped contracting and only a little dribble of my juices dribbled out of me Jennifer took her hand out. In the mirror I could see her face with a nice smile. &quot;That was great don&#39;t you think?&quot; She asked me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeshh shatsh wash awweshome&quot; I, Kyle the vagina said back to her. Now that the pleasure was slowly subsiding I started to get my taste and smell back. Awful. I wanted to be clean. I was so salty and musky. &quot;Jenniffwer, shwall we ssshowwer?&quot; I asked her.</p>
