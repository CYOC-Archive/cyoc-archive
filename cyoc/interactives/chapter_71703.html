<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning, Don pleaded with me to allow him to grow a bigger penis so that he could pass better if undressed as a male.  With the <br />
magic ring, I thought long and hard.<br />
<br />
He plead his case.  He begged, “I’d love to have a dick!  To grip it with my masculine (actually quite small and feminine) hands, to grip such a <br />
hairy shaft and balls, it’d be awesome!  I’d love to cum like a dude, and grip the shaft like you guys!  It’s so hard yanking my little penis and <br />
balls, because I have to strut it out so it doesn’t look like a chick’s crotch.”<br />
<br />
I thought about it, and reluctantly gave in.  I said, “Okay.  I’ll grant you a fully developed male, hairy penis and balls, and do away with your <br />
uterus and ovaries, but you will have a mark above your penis so that it looks like a phalloplasty.  But you do grant me the wish that your butt <br />
will feel like a vagina, and I’ll be able to get with you anytime you want.”<br />
<br />
Don replied, “Sure.  But Jarred, I beg you have to allow me the chance to pursue girls.  At least let me try.  You know I love you, anyways.”<br />
<br />
I said, “Sure.  And when you outline a goatee on your face, it’ll feel like a real goatee when people touch your face, except for me, as your face <br />
will feel feminine when only I touch it.  And your chest will look like a normal, hairy chest with some manboobs, except to me, and will only feel <br />
different when you and I touch them.”<br />
<br />
Smiling enthusiastically, Don replied graciously while holding his hand out, “Deal.”<br />
<br />
Using the magic ring, I granted him all of these wishes.<br />
<br />
Since it was two hours before school, I took a nap on the couch, allowing my pretty boy to wake me up when it was time to go to school.  Sure I <br />
really liked him as a girl, but I’ll get used to him being a boy.  It’s just a minor adjustment, but he’s still the same height, still has some <br />
feminine features though he’s increased in masculinity, and still has the same beautifully, round shaped ass as before.  He just now has facial <br />
hair and a dick and balls between his trim thighs.  <br />
<br />
To me, only I get to see his chest as woman-like, as it appears as male to everyone else, including him.<br />
<br />
Don is still a hottie, it’s just a little odd that now he’s male.  Sam had used the magic ring to get him to become a male, and it worked.  <br />
Strangely enough, I’m still kind of aroused by Don, though I try to hide it.  <br />
<br />
His big, feminine eyes, soft wet lips, small stomach and trim abs, his small bony wrists, his beautiful, soft blonde hair…. Don still has no idea <br />
how to walk or talk like a man, but he tries hard, and it’s an experience for him as well as me, and he’s willing to be a fast learner. <br />
It’ll be weird, because I’ve always dreamt about pulling out and cumming on his stomach.  Now, he can pull out and cum on my stomach.  Even <br />
so, it’s all the more of a bonus that we have each other, and can date other women, now that we’re both males.  <br />
<br />
It’ll be nice to be able to use the same restroom and locker room with a guy who was once my girlfriend, and who is now my sexually confused, <br />
best friend and part time boyfriend.  Not that any of this makes me a homosexual, right?  Maybe he’s sexually confusing the heck out of me, as <br />
it’s hard for me to ignore my feelings for this boy.  I just want to adopt him as my younger brother, albeit he’s only younger by a few days.<br />
<br />
When I woke up, I saw Don wake me up.<br />
<br />
He said to me, “Alright, we gotta go to school, sweetie!”<br />
<br />
I grabbed his soft, albeit male ass, as he give me a kiss on the lips.   I felt his soft, short blonde hair, and kissed him on the lips for what <br />
seemed like several minutes, while he was feeling his dick and himself become aroused.<br />
<br />
Don then said, “Time for me to become the most heterosexual, ass grabbing man on the campus!  You too, sweetie!  I gotta get my male ass <br />
dressed!”<br />
<br />
When we got to the school (and three years later), the principal re-introduced Don to the class to the teacher.<br />
<br />
Principal Roberts told Mr. Savage and the class, “Today, we have a new student.  Dawn transferred out of the school, but her brother Don, will <br />
be entering the school as a new student.  His grades have carried over, so please be kind to him.”<br />
<br />
Betty was fawning all over Don.  She found the 5 foot 3, slim blonde male with a dark brown goatee, with a beautifully tan skin and small, curvy <br />
hips to be stunning.  She would’ve pursued Dawn, but felt Dawn was intensely attracted to girls, and Betty refused to believe herself to be a <br />
lesbian.  Now that Dawn has a twin brother (or is actually Don), Betty now feels the urge to introduce herself and flirt heavily with Don. <br />
<br />
Don was wearing a pink sweater and black pants, and a white T-shirt underneath.  Clearly, Betty could hear his voice trembling and breathing <br />
next to her, as maybe he was breathing hard from the hot air outside and from the lack of air conditioning inside.<br />
<br />
Betty was a 5 foot 6, 120 pound brunette, who had green highlights and wore pigtails, as she had on a black vest over a white T-shirt, had C <br />
cup breasts, and wore a black skirt.<br />
<br />
Betty said to Don, “Hello, Don!  My name is Betty.  I go to school here.  You’re such a dreamboat.”<br />
<br />
Blushing, Don said nervously as he looked down, “Thanks, Betty. I’m new here.  I um….return the favor, back to you.”<br />
<br />
However, the student next to him was Roger, who was the school’s backup running back and starting outside linebacker, wasn’t entirely <br />
convinced that Don was fully male.<br />
<br />
Roger said, “Don, you look a lot like Dawn.  You know, you look a lot like your sister.  I didn’t even know she had a brother.  She had the nicest <br />
pigtails, and ass, she was so sweet to look at.”<br />
<br />
Flustered, Don snapped, “Roger, please don’t be an ass.  Don’t object me-I mean her, like that.  Do you have a problem with me?”<br />
<br />
Roger replied, “Well how about you take off your shirt?  Pussy!  Or I’ll rip it open for you, and give you a wedgie, you little pansy!”<br />
<br />
Offended, Don replied whiningly as he got up in anger, “I am not a pussy!”<br />
<br />
I intervened, and said, “Hey, hey, hey, Roger, go easy on the boy.  Don’t be so mean to him, Roger.  Don, sorry about Roger.  Roger, he’s a <br />
good guy, once you get to know him.”<br />
<br />
Then, Roger muttered something unintelligible as he stormed back to his seat in a huff.<br />
<br />
As the class was over, Betty gave Don her number.<br />
<br />
She said, “Don, you’re so handsome, please call me!  I want your body, sir!”<br />
<br />
Don replied nervously, “Thanks, Betty.”<br />
<br />
Then, Don and I went to P.E. class, where we now had the same class, and were to go to the same locker room.  There, we ran into Roger and <br />
his friends.<br />
<br />
Roger demanded Don, “Take off your shirt, or I’ll do it for you.  Prove that you’re a manly man.”<br />
<br />
Don replied angrily, “I don’t have to be bullied!  At least, not by you of all people!”<br />
<br />
I replied, “Don, you don’t have to do anything they want you to do.  Roger, take it easy on him.”<br />
<br />
Roger said, “No!  Why don’t I give your little boyfriend a wedgie, huh?”<br />
<br />
I said hastily, “Don’t do that!”<br />
<br />
He directed his friends to hold me while I was trying to fight them off.<br />
<br />
Boldly, Don replied with reluctance, “Fine!  I’ll take off my shirt.  Right here.”<br />
<br />
The slim, blonde man took off his shirt to reveal a hairy male chest, with slightly bigger pecks than most boys.  Astonished, Roger took some <br />
time to examine Don’s body.  He ran a finger through his chest, and felt his pecks, which felt hairy and manly, before running his hand through <br />
his face to feel the hairiness of his goatee and budding beard.<br />
<br />
The three friends of Roger replied in astonished, “Whoa.  Roger, he’s a boy.  Let’s head to P.E. class.”<br />
<br />
Pleased, Roger said, “Alright Don.  You’re a guy.  But you better watch it, or I’ll make sure you get a wedgie.”<br />
<br />
He then said snootily, “Annnnnnd, one more test.   Take your pants off.  I demand it, sir!  If you pass, I’ll have to suck you dry, young man, and <br />
cup your balls so that I know you’re a guy, to the point where sweat drips off of your balls and you beat and cum into my hungry, naughty <br />
mouth.”<br />
<br />
Don responded quizzically, “Fine.  I don’t know your intentions, but if I must, I’ll take my pants off.”<br />
<br />
Don removed his short blue underwear, revealing his hairy penis and balls.<br />
<br />
Roger examined Don, and groped his shaft and balls before saying,”Okay.  You’re a real guy.  I guess I’ll have to suck your dick.”<br />
<br />
Then, the P.E. teacher came in, and said, “What are you boys doing?  Stop goofing around, we have class in a couple of minutes!  Get dressed!”<br />
<br />
So we all we got dressed, and proceeded to head to class.</p>
