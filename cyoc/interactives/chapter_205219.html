<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marriages always came with certain expectations, and things like the honeymoon was one of them. And couples consummating their wedding on the honeymoon was often one of them. And while New Zerzura wasn&#39;t their home, for Joanne and Philip and Nicole and Lars, as Fennec Fox Animalians, it was a nice place to visit, and benefitted from the fact that Egypt was a bit more open and liberal with regard to how they handled tourism and other things. Which provided plenty of opportunities for both sets of newlyweds to consummate their marriages together, and the honeymoon suites at the hotel they were at were more than made up for them.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
For Joanne, some of the romantic mood was lost as the trip had started with her drinking far more of the local coffee and not knowing the full caffeine levels in it. The result had had her becoming rather hyper and then proceeding to jog around the colony city. It soon had Philip chasing after her, trying to calm her down, and that soon brought more attention as local authorities then wanted to make sure there was no potential domestic abuse going on. By the time that everyone had been assured that it was a sudden energy rush, Joanne and Philip were released and made their way back to their hotel suite.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... I never expected anything like that to happen,&quot; Joanne said slowly as she looked out the window toward the rest of the colony south of the hotel.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you did provide a clear sign of being healthy,&quot; Philip said to her as he came up behind her, &quot;as the colony here has about the same land area as Animalia does. And we made a few good laps around it before anyone wondered whether or not something was up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but it was embarrassing to have to admit to law enforcement that I&#39;d gotten far too much caffeine in my system and was running on more energy than expected,&quot; Joanne answered, &quot;gave them all a good laugh. Out of town CEO can&#39;t handle coffee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sure they won&#39;t mind too much,&quot; Philip answered as he hugged Joanne to him and nuzzled his muzzle to her neck, their ears rubbing against each other as they did so.<br />
<br />
Joanne also soon felt something pressing against her as her husband came up behind her and that made her eyes widen at this, as she also recognized what was pressing against her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re turned on by this!&quot; Joanne gasped in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I did get a good view of a beautiful butt with a cream-colored tail wagging above it for a bit,&quot; Philip admitted and gave a few kisses at Joanne&#39;s neck, &quot;and with it being our honeymoon and you showing a lot of energy... it got me thinking on... other things.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was a bit of a surprise, but in some ways, Joanne wasn&#39;t all that offended. If this were some total stranger or a first date, she would be, but she and Philip had been seeing each other for a while even before Lars became a Fennec Fox Animalian and started dating Nicole. In some ways, the relationship helped Joanne further adjust to Animalia and find ways to relate to at times rebellious daughter, and Joanne had found in Philip a well-muscled Animalian with a kind heart and all the sorts of features that were physically and emotionally desirable. Some of the start of their relationship even came from her finding Philip working out at the Claw Coliseum. From there, love bloomed and progressed rather well, and in fact she and Philip had had sex plenty of times as Animalians before now. In this, while elements of getting too much caffeine were embarrassing, Joanne was glad to be able to hold her new husband&#39;s attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it would appear that someone has been a naughty boy,&quot; Joanne spoke while turning to face Philip and with a slightly playful tone in her voice, &quot;I suppose I&#39;ll have to take you to bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Philip smiled as he caught a rising scent of arousal growing with Joanne, which indicated to him that her thoughts were turning to that as well. It left him with an almost impish grin as he was ushered and almost pushed onto the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Note, that every time we go to bed, it won&#39;t be this way,&quot; Joanne warned, her voice still sounding playful as her paws slipped under Philip&#39;s shirt and began to lift it up and revealing the well sculpted muscle underneath.<br />
<br />
&quot;True,&quot; Philip nodded, &quot;you&#39;ll have your work... and some day in the future we&#39;ll have kits. Who will come in when they&#39;ve had nightmares and want their mother to tell them things will be alright. But that&#39;s not tonight. Tonight, we&#39;re on our honeymoon. So... why not have some fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanne nodded approvingly as she finished removing Philip&#39;s shirt and soon felt his hands lift up her breasts slightly. They were presently in her bra and underneath her shirt, but as Philip moved his hands to one of the buttons on her shirt, Joanne also knew that would soon change.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
In the other honeymoon suite, and one that was across the hall so that sounds from one suite were not heard from the other, Lars and Nicole were enjoying their own very passionate evening. And it was a passionate one, as Lars thrust his hips forward as his motions mirrored a piston as his erect member went in and out of his wife and she held his hips close enough to keep him in her. Both yiped and gave the pleasure filled cries that one would expect from a pair of young lovers enjoying their honeymoon. The lights were on low, but they provided enough like that Lars could note that some of that light glinted off of Nicoles earrings and went in all directions from there. To a degree, Lars actually felt the reflected light made things look even better.<br />
<br />
Nicole might not have come across him with the most honest of intentions. He sort of sensed that when she&#39;d talked about his son dating her mother, and Philip at times reminded him of that, but there was a lot about Nicole that Lars rapidly found himself loving, especially after he converted to being Fennec Fox Animalian as well. For converting had restored him to his youth and he&#39;d felt like many of the things that he&#39;d gotten into while in college were back. Many of the things that Lars had given up while raising Philip as a single father was back, and in that Lars saw a lot to be loved in Nicole. Sure, she may have had some games to play, but she had her own drive and rebellious streak that was in a way something that Lars was attracted to. And as they dated, Lars had also found that much of her rebellion was more against an overbearing parent with unreal expectations, and that at the same time, Nicole had many of the sorts of qualities that Joanne would respect, even if Nicole would never admit having them. That brought them closer together as the &quot;college frat boy&quot; in Lars fell for the &quot;rebel&quot; in Nicole.<br />
<br />
And as the two of them found love, they began moving on the path to where they were now, with Nicole on her back and marveling at Lars well-muscled chest and feeling her ample bosom bounce with each thrust made into her. This wasn&#39;t like the times they&#39;d had sex before, this was now as man and wife, and to both of them, this actually felt more special. There was the sense of &quot;forever&quot; between them now, and Nicole liked how Lars seemed to be able to balance the &quot;wild college frat boy&quot; side of his personality that had come from his mild case of Regressive Hypersexuality Disorder and the insurance company agent who was able to not only make a sale but provide consistent and stable service. They seemed dynamically opposed and yet worked perfectly well with Lars, and Nicole had found herself growing to love that over time. And in the future, she would happily have his kits.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... oh... I&#39;m close...&quot; Nicole managed a few yipping moans as her clit was practically buzzing with pleasure as Lars moved to suck on one nipple for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not far behind you,&quot; Lars managed to pant out as his own penis was twitching a bit as Nicole&#39;s vagina gripped it firmly.<br />
<br />
Nicole found herself smiling a bit as some of her milk dribbled down Lar&#39;s chin as he said that, but her own building orgasm was enough that her thoughts on Lars drinking her milk was forgotten. And almost at the same time, she then felt Lars&#39; knot gain entrance into her, and his own climax followed. It left them giving off a chorus of yips as they basked in the mutual pleasure felt as husband and wife. Spent for the moment, Lars fell over to his side to that he didn&#39;t land on Nicole. With his knot firmly in her, that did pull her over onto her side, but that didn&#39;t matter. It let Lars look into Nicole&#39;s eyes and that made him smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re beautiful,&quot; Lars said to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Nichole smiled back, &quot;and you&#39;re quite handsome... it&#39;s probably the ears.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of them laughed a bit at that.<br />
<br />
&quot;And mom did pick a good place to visit,&quot; Nicole commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am a bit surprised that you wanted to come here when Joanne and Philip would also be here on their honeymoon,&quot; Lars commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not that bad,&quot; Nicole managed, &quot;and to a degree... once we both became Animalians, the things that drove us apart in New York began to come down. Mom accepted that I didn&#39;t want to be a career fashion designer and I began to realize that much of what I&#39;d rebelled against was more a misunderstanding on my mother&#39;s part and that she wasn&#39;t trying to oppress me. And as mom got used to being an Animalian and having her libido shoot up... there were some embarrassing parts... but it also led to the both of us connecting in a way that hadn&#39;t been there before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lars carefully moved a strand of Nicole&#39;s hair so that it didn&#39;t hang over her eyes as his wife then gave a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;And some things have been fun,&quot; Nicole chuckled, &quot;you and Philip did reasonably well in the Set Lookalike Contest.&quot; She then chuckled harder, &quot;and of course mom getting too much caffeine on the first day here. I wouldn&#39;t have missed that for the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thankfully that was just caffeine,&quot; Lars chuckled and nuzzled his muzzle to Nicole&#39;s.</p>
