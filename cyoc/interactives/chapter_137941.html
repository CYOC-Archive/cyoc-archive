<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Jake arrived back inside his lair, everything looked as it should, untouched, unaltered from when he&#39;d left through his window hours earlier.  That&#39;s odd, Jake thought, unsure what caused his magic to fail.  Unconcerned for the moment, he&#39;d noticed it was a few minutes after 4 AM according to the blue-lit clock on the nightstand beside his bed.<br />
<br />
Glancing at his computer and the Chronivac 4.0 device attached to it, Jake wondered how to best protect the two devices.  He could summon a canine demon from Hell to watch over it, or use Franz and Travis for guard dogs once he let Travis&#39; changes be completed.  Another option was to bring Kurt inside and have him patrol his lair since the teen and demon vampire Incubus that&#39;d hijacked and merged their soul&#39;s together wouldn&#39;t change out of their Vietnamese bat form back into human form unless and until Jake willed it.<br />
<br />
Or, Jake chuckled, he could transfer his Chronivac 4.0 device and his computer to hell and give it to his Nether Agent Professor for him to use once he altered reality so that nobody could affect him and anything he&#39;d already created or changed.<br />
<br />
Thinking himself back inside the Wagner&#39;s house, to Franz&#39;s upstairs bedroom, Jake instantly spotted Franz&#39;s new clone and identical twin, still thrilled, masturbating himself.  Franz, still in Doberman form, was busy lapping at his own red canine erection without pause.  Inverted, Kurt hung from one of the exposed wooden support beams of the ceiling in his bat form, his long curved black talon-like toe claws gripping the beam that supported his teen-sized body weight, his lengthy, oily black Vietnamese hair dangling down in foot-long strands off his head, waiting for his master Jake&#39;s return.<br />
<br />
Mr Wagner stood in front of the mirror on the panel of Franz&#39;s opened closet door, admiring his reflection and new 25-year-old appearance despite looking far more like his middle youngest son but now with two-tone black and light blond streaked greasy hair styled just like his son Kurt&#39;s light blond hair had been.<br />
<br />
It was now time for Jake to decide what to do with the two younger blond twins.  Initially, he&#39;d wanted to make Kurt his Initiate Incubus mate, his BFF, but that hadn&#39;t gone as he&#39;d planned after that demon Tommy Nguyen had possessed Kurt&#39;s soul and merged his with the teen&#39;s.  And he would have turned Kurt&#39;s older brother Franz into his mate, but when Jake saw the male Doberman, it was easy deciding to even include Mad King Wagner into the fun by using his canine form and offer a complete transformed twin to mate with the nosy redheaded neighbor&#39;s useful addition, too.  Johann Wagner&#39;s transformation into a younger version of himself hadn&#39;t worked out for him that well either, and even though the 41-year-old now had his young son&#39;s teen appearance, he wasn&#39;t really a perfect mate for Jake either.  Jake had 2 more Wagner males available, but he wasn&#39;t sure if he&#39;d wanted to have one or both of the 15-year-old twins for his mate until he&#39;d investigated them a little bit more.<br />
<br />
And now that he looked like a 21-year-old, Jake wasn&#39;t sure if he wanted his mate or mates to appear to be young teen&#39;s.  It would absolutely have all those damnable do-gooders and born-again&#39;s creating their little protester signs and hate slogans his demonic-kind really enjoyed getting all riled up, spouting all of their anti-this and anti-that message of hate against all their own fellow humans.<br />
<br />
For Incubus Jake, all human males were simply cattle for him to feed on, and to have as much sex as he&#39;d wanted with any one of them.<br />
<br />
Jake chuckled.  Well, it&#39;s time I go and take a look at those two little punks and see what they&#39;re up to since I&#39;m sensing their already awake and ... weightlifting?   Maybe one or both of them will be worthwhile changing into my cute little sex slave and horny mate if either one of them was actually a muscle stud.<br />
<br />
Dietrich scratched his ass angrily, scraping acne scabs off his butt cheeks while Heinrich pumped out another set of incline-fly&#39;s on their weight bench.  Neither twin was happy about losing the bench once their family returned to Germany come Monday, but convincing their dad to get another lifting bench shouldn&#39;t be that much of a problem since Franz was still joining them.  Glancing down at Heinrich&#39;s last fly set, Dietrich hoped he could match his twin&#39;s 15-rep set.<br />
<br />
His twin was starting to get into lifting a bit more than him, but he wasn&#39;t out of his total emo phase yet.  His latest haircut still matched Heinrich&#39;s same spiky-Mohawk&#39;s, and he knew if he didn&#39;t keep up then Heinrich would end up getting bigger and stronger than him.  But Dietrich would still rather be hanging with his emo buds, and emo-loving girlfriend instead of weightlifting like Heinrich always wanted to do every early morning.<br />
<br />
But his twin&#39;s influence for them to hang out together all the time always won out.  And it wasn&#39;t that Dietrich didn&#39;t want to be hanging out with Heinrich, they were identical twins after all, and they&#39;d still always acted, and thought, and talked, and had identical matching tattoo&#39;s.  They almost always dressed exactly the same, just like they&#39;d always had.<br />
<br />
Heinrich looked up at his twin before finishing his last set, and said, &quot;Hey?  What&#39;s up?  You still spottin&#39; me for the last couple a reps or what, D-Man?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m here,&quot; Dietrich answered, nodding, switching his thoughts about already missing Julie Hayes&#39; big boobs back to his twin&#39;s workout.  &quot;Just mad we&#39;re leavin&#39; here is all.  I was finally gettin&#39; used to havin&#39; a girlfriend, one that I sorta cared about, finally, I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No shit,&quot; Heinrich said, pulling the two 30-pound dumbbells together with a plastic click above his chest for his last two reps.  He let the weights drop to the floor with a thud.  &quot;Ya,I&#39;m pissed, too, Diedle-man, but I&#39;m gonna go back and check out if Frau Helga is still babysittin&#39;.  She was one totally hot mama.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ewww,&quot; Dietrich groaned, crinkling his aquiline-sharp Germanic nose.  &quot;She&#39;s gonna be so hella old now, Heinie! Like maybe ... forty-something!  I know you was only likin&#39; her on a count&#39;a we were like 6-years-old before we left Germany and moved here, and she had big boobs!&quot;<br />
<br />
Heinrich shook his head, wiping sweat off his chest and flicking it at his twin as he sat upright. &quot;Exactly! She was one hot mama, you sheisser!  Nice bigg&#39;ums.  Jiggly, too.  What?  You liked her, don&#39;t deny it, you shit!  I seen you, how you were always checkin&#39; out all of our babysitter&#39;s, too, just like me.  Besides, D-man.  We knew Julie&#39;s gonna be with that emo freak-wad, what&#39;s his name, Ernesto Rivera soon as we&#39;d left!  You know it, just forget her, bro&#39;.  I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll both find us another babe for doin&#39; happy happys with, just as soon as we head back to the Fatherland.  I ain&#39;t worryin&#39; none about it.  You&#39;ll see, D-Man, we&#39;ll be gettin&#39; it, hard and horny again once we can both find us some hot new German babes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Dietrich said, nodding, quickly, adding, &quot;I&#39;d just like to get back at the dick for, ya know, stealin&#39; my girlfriend!  Even if we&#39;re leavin&#39; in like ... three days, ya know?  An&#39; I&#39;ve always hated Ernesto!  And why does his brother call the dumb emo shit, Diego, for?  Like ... is that his gang name or somethin&#39;?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ernesto?&quot; Jake questioned, opening the 15-year-old twin&#39;s bedroom door as the vortex behind him vanished.  He was now dressed in a mixture of clothes retrieved from his lair.  &quot;I just sorta overheard you, Dietrich, so I&#39;m here to help you two cutie&#39;s!  Who&#39;s this Ernesto Diego guy you wanna get back at so much?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa! Fag alert!&quot; Heinrich shouted as he leaped off the weight bench, backing up from the 20-something-year-old blond-haired guy standing at their door.  The guy was dressed strange, wearing a pair of familiar-looking baggy gray basketball shorts that looked like Kurt&#39;s, knee-high leather paratrooper-style jump boots, and a boyishly strange too-small T-shirt with a food-stained cartoon graphic on the front.  &quot;Who are you, man?  You ... Franz&#39;s fag friend or somethin&#39;?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or somethin&#39;,&quot; Jake replied, entering the twin&#39;s stinky bedroom.  His nostrils crinkled from the pungently sweet dirty body odor smells of both boys, immediately deciding neither would be his mate.  Normally, jock&#39;s body odor was a turn-on for Jake, but these two just smelled so damn ... filthy.  And Heinrich&#39;s fag comments would be with a very eye-opening price he was certainly going to learn how to enjoy himself real soon, for a very ... very long time to come. &quot;Franz won&#39;t say I&#39;m a friend, though!  That is, if he could say anything.  It&#39;d likely be just a bark or a growl, but ... I do wanna help you two out with this emo friend ... if you&#39;d like my help, that is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dietrich glanced at the well-built blond guy, instantly noticing his dark blond hair looked just like their Dad&#39;s dark blond hair.  Same freakin&#39; color, and same spiky blond pointy barbs.  Nodding, Dietrich said, &quot;Sure!  I-I&#39;d really like some help gettin&#39; back at him, for sure, dude.  He&#39;s not our friend, though.  Damn sheisser stole my girlfriend soon as he&#39;d heard about us goin&#39; back to Germany on Monday, like 2 or 3 days from now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh ...&quot; Jake paused, wondering why he&#39;d just found this out.  Guess I&#39;m changin&#39; that now, too, Jake thought, quickly altering reality to keep the Wagner&#39;s within the United States, permanently.  Now their family would not ever be leaving.  And Jake also made it so that they&#39;d be staying with him back in his large mountainous lair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that guy&#39;s like a total fuckin&#39; bull-headed jerk-wad,&quot; Heinrich added, lifting his sweaty T-shirt up from the carpet and wiping away streaks of sweat pouring down from his chest and face.  &quot;I&#39;d just like to see someone beat him down for us, maybe squash him like a cockroach, if you&#39;re offerin&#39;.  You want an address?  I know where he lives.  It&#39;s not far from here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You certainly gave me some ideas,&quot; Jake said, thinking of some possible options he could try.  &quot;Bull-headed you say, huh?  That&#39;d be ... interesting.  So you know where this Ernesto guy is?  Lemme check and see what my, um, my Professor knows about him, if anything.  What&#39;s his full name?  Ernesto--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ernesto Douchebag Rivera,&quot; Dietrich interrupted, laying back on the incline weight bench.  &quot;Ernesto&#39;s still a freshman, like us since we stayed back once, but the guy&#39;s like ... well, he was always like skatin&#39; with us, a total emo and shit, until his brother came back to school from like juvie hall or somethin&#39;, and sheiss, now we stay the hell away from him cause, well, ya know, his brother&#39;s a senior an&#39; all that, know what I&#39;m sayin&#39;?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, yes,&quot; Jake cackled, receiving from the Ether everything he needed to know about 14-year-old Ernesto &#39;Diego&#39; Rivera and his drug-dealing 17-year-old brother, Luis &#39;Chico&#39; Rivera.  Both teenagers were already on his &#39;To Do List&#39; of offensive young contacts to be initiated.  &quot;I need just one more moment with you boys, and then I&#39;ll go and have a little visit with those two lucky boys and say a few words with both of &#39;em.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm, ya, right,&quot; Heinrich said, leaning against the wall behind the weight bench.  He didn&#39;t know what it was, but despite the guy&#39;s strange look and ... gayness, Heinrich was starting to feel like he was getting aroused by this blond guy.  &quot;You, you go do that!  Sure.  Me and um ... Dietrich will ahh ... we&#39;ll stay right here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you will,&quot; Jake said, stealing 2 Chamber of Hell Pod&#39;s, converted teens, from Hell&#39;s Ether into the twin&#39;s bedroom in a dark red smoky vortex.  Jake knew neither twin could see the inviting sleep pods or smoky vortex. If either of them could see the two human teenager&#39;s severely altered mutated forms, they&#39;d most likely be vomiting, effectively giving the two sleep pods owners free reigns to come and possess the two human souls without much of a struggle.  Jake waved his hand, and said, &quot;Neither will you two fall asleep in your pods, unless you want your own soul&#39;s possessed like your foolish brother Kurt&#39;s soul got owned.  Now, be naked, and be sealed inside those two protective Hell Pods I have for you two boys while I take off for a moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Glancing down at Dietrich reclined on the weight bench, Heinrich was unsure what the blond guy was saying about their brother, Kurt, shrieking as his shorts and briefs suddenly vanished.  Heinrich also noticed that Dietrich was naked now, too, staring at him in shock as his brother&#39;s body disappeared inside a portal like-something that looked like the outlined shape of a tall slender human body consuming him as the thing closed around his reclined vanishing body on top of their weight bench.  Some unnatural warm and squishy &#39;thing&#39; folded itself around him, too, and had also somehow attached him--and it--to the wall like a cocoon.  Although it was not exactly wet, it was extremely muggy inside, and whatever it was immediately encased him inside its own human-shaped form-fitting suit and strange shell-like covering of skin.<br />
<br />
Within seconds, Heinrich and Dietrich struggled as the squishy interior of their pods began to squeeze its arms? or were those stretchy long ropy things across their stomach its legs? pulling uncomfortably tight around their own abdomen&#39;s.<br />
<br />
And both twins were quickly targeted by the Hell Pod&#39;s twin owners, two 14-century old feral Nightchild vampire demons instantly caught inside the two Hellcage traps Jake&#39;d left to capture them in the moment they&#39;d come after the two stolen Hell Pod&#39;s and entered the emo Wagner twins bedroom.<br />
<br />
Reappearing from his stop at the Rivera household, and the Nether in a fiery smoky vortex, Jake immediately saw both trapped feral Nightchild vampire demons striking at the barriers inside the Ethereal cages he had created.  The vampire bat demons were angry with demonic hatred, wildly feral.  Jake wondered how many parts of these two feral vampire twins body parts he should use this time when he transformed the two emo twins into the same form of weaker, blood-drinking Vampire Incubus like the Guardian Vampire bat he&#39;d made their brother Kurt become.<br />
<br />
Jake knew he&#39;d keep them identical twins, having found two weak-muscled vampire bat twins from that same gang of young Vietnamese long-haired emo vampire punks he had taken Tommy Nguyen from when he&#39;d transferred the vampire demon bat&#39;s body parts onto Kurt&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
And Jake had also decided that both emo twins should resemble their older brother Kurt a little more now, too.<br />
<br />
Triplets would have been a fun treat, but Kurt ended up looking more like an Asian teen instead of a German teen once he climaxed.  Jake&#39;d warned Kurt, &#39;wait til you see what happens once you start shootin&#39; his cum,&#39; but Kurt had mounted dog-boy Franz and instantly gained Tommy Nguyen&#39;s long black oily hair on his head, so Kurt would now look like an entirely Vietnamese emo teenager to humans, and to demons if Jake ever allowed Kurt to switch to his human form.<br />
<br />
But doing that to the two emo German twins would potentially ruin the rest of Jake&#39;s plans.<br />
<br />
They still needed to be recognizable for what would be arriving soon, Jake thought.<br />
<br />
Both the bat wings and tails were necessary, providing both flight and demon powers to cause their victims to be immobile, and to put their prey to sleep.  But these Asian bat&#39;s nearly black flesh would change their appearance far too much.  The vampire bat&#39;s fangs, tongue, ears, and eyes were required for them to function as true vampire bats without any loss of its feeding habits.  The vampire bat&#39;s own internal reproductive and digestive systems, and the entire orifice to excrete its processed wastes were also needed.  Jake realized the only human parts he could keep untouched for both of the Wagner twins were simply their blond hair and the flesh of their body.<br />
<br />
Unless ... hmm, Jake thought, maybe he would have them switch bodies with ... that&#39;s it!  Like Franz&#39;s unusual changes, from a human body to a Doberman body with sunrise and sunset, both of these two twins can be switching their body&#39;s with both of their mates body&#39;s with every sunset, or maybe with every other sunset and sunrise.<br />
<br />
That, Jake thought, would be a lot more fun to watch than just transforming Heinrich and Dietrich into two more Initiate Incubus, or two Guardian vampire bat&#39;s since neither were going to be a mate for Jake himself.<br />
<br />
With his computer and Chronivac 4.0 safe in Hell&#39;s Ether with his Agent Professor, Jake knew he wouldn&#39;t have to worry about the legendary status he&#39;d already gained in Hell&#39;s 9 dominions ... right?<br />
<br />
And thinking Heinrich and Dietrich were now allowed to see everything around them, unable to move away from the Hellcages hovering above and beside them, Jake thought a few more changes, and then thought the human twins out of their Hell Pod&#39;s and ...</p>
