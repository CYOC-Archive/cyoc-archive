<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With James left alone with her thoughts, she wondered if there was even much point in her father trying to make sure she could get to the wedding. Getting her there at this point would be a lot of effort just for an aunt who had a grudge against her.<br />
<br />
She thought about her friends back home, about her own room, her stuff... It would be much easier to just go home for her at this point... But as she thought about this, a sudden headache came across James making her clench her eyes shut. Next thing she knew she heard the sound of her travel pack being tossed around, only to open her eyes and see her own room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is someone in James&#39; room?&quot; James heard someone downstairs say.<br />
<br />
James panicked, tried to throw the covers of her bed over herself and hoped they wouldn&#39;t come close. The sheets couldn&#39;t even cover her right now, and she cursed, unable to do anything as the door opened.<br />
<br />
Standing in the doorway was Alex one of James&#39; friends, looking down at the hot mess James had made of herself. James looked up at Alex with teary eyes and it seemed Alex recognized her.<br />
<br />
&quot;James?! What happened? Why are you... This? And how did you get back so fast?&quot; Alex said in a barrage of questions.<br />
<br />
James hung her head. &quot;... A magic amulet happened... A draconic husbandry charm they called it... But they described it more like a love charm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex&#39;s eyes widened, and a cramp formed in his hands as he noticed them becoming covered in blue scales and growing talons. He looked away, letting the implications sink in. &quot;Are... Are you saying I&#39;m going to become your mate? But... My girlfriend is here, I can&#39;t just...&quot; He sighed, sounding half defeated.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; James said, tearing up again, &quot;its not just you... Its anyone who gets too close to me. They become my...&quot; James gulped, trying to thing of a way to put it. &quot;... My wives.&quot;<br />
<br />
Behind Alex they heard Alex&#39;s girlfriend Rachel coming up the stairs. &quot;Alex, something weird is going on! My hands are-&quot;<br />
<br />
She stopped as she reached the bedroom door, and saw Alex&#39;s hands, and James&#39; entire body. &quot;Oh no, James you poor thing, you look like you&#39;ve become a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
James pouted. &quot;I&#39;m not &#39;just&#39; a girl.... I have... Both down there,&quot; James said, fidgeting under the bed covers that barely covered her ass.<br />
<br />
James suddenly stopped as she felt something in the back of her mind change. She had images of herself making out with the two of them, of them intertwining in an act of passion, and bonding over their time full of eggs.<br />
<br />
She looked up and saw a glint in Alex and Rachel&#39;s eyes, the two looked nervous, like they were turned on by the sight of James.<br />
<br />
&quot;James... I...&quot; Alex started. &quot;I&#39;m not going to have much time left... and if I&#39;m going to spend the rest of my life being mated by you then... At least let me have one chance to do the same for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel blushed as she heard this. &quot;I&#39;d kind of like to be part of this... This could be the one chance to make this memorable... We should do this together.&quot;<br />
<br />
James looked at them, blushing through her purple scales. &quot;Alright... Just... Go easy on me Alex, Its going to be my first time.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three repositioned themselves, with Rachel wiggling off her pants as she presented her ass, using the bed to keep her arms supported. James positioned herself behind her, herself a bit big to really grasp onto her while she was like this, so she just kept her forelegs to either side of Rachel. With a bit of a shock to James, Alex grabbed hold of James&#39; hips and she raised her tail, exposing her virgin pussy.<br />
<br />
Alex was the first to thrust in, his member not going deep into James due to how big she was, but she was incredibly tight, and even as she was dripping with arousal from her heat it still took a lot to press it in. James couldn&#39;t help but let out a high pitched squeak, only for Rachel to take a hold of James&#39; pointy penis and try to guide the massive thing in.<br />
<br />
James looked down on Rachel, and saw she was already beginning to grow under her, bright red scales going halfway up her arms. A moment later James gasped as she felt the tip of her penis enter Rachel, and behind her, Alex was starting the speed up his thrusts, perhaps in hopes of reaching climax before he lost what made him male.<br />
<br />
James thought this was going to continue as just animalistic rutting until she felt Rachel twist around to nip at her nipples. This made tingles of pleasure reverberate in her chest as she felt the relaxing sensation of milk being squeezed through her nipples. Something began intertwining with her tail, and she looked back to see Alex&#39;s tail had already grown in, and soon it was joined by Rachel&#39;s.<br />
<br />
James felt herself being pushed forward as the weight of Alex on her increased with Alex&#39;s growing breasts, forcing James&#39; own breasts out of Rachel&#39;s mouth and pressed into her back instead, the shock caused James&#39; tongue to stick out as she moaned. She was even more shocked as Rachel&#39;s head, now apparently just as draconic as hers locked her muzzle to hers and began running her own tongue down hers.<br />
<br />
Alex soon came inside James coating the inside of James&#39; slit, making her give a light trill, only to be left needy as Alex&#39;s dwindling length began to retreat from her tunnel. &quot;I did it... My last cum as a male,&quot; Alex said panting.<br />
<br />
James wiggled her butt at Alex. &quot;Finish the job, I need... I need to be filled.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex pressed forward, squishing a newly formed pair of soft scaled breasts against a sensitive point on the base of James&#39; wings. James could feel Alex&#39;s forming vagina pressing against the top of her tail, while Alex&#39;s own tail began to probe at the entrance to James&#39; entrance.<br />
<br />
James leaned more on Rachel as the thrusting increased, groping at Rachel&#39;s breasts as she propped them up, only for Alex to begin fondling James&#39; breasts as well. &quot;I can&#39;t let you do anything to my lover that I can&#39;t do with you,&quot; she heard Alex whisper into the fins in the side of her head.<br />
<br />
James was beginning to get close, even as Alex and Rachel&#39;s draconic muzzles began making out in front of her with her between them. It was then that she felt Alex&#39;s tail dive deep into her, causing her to feel a lightning bolt of pleasure across her entire body as something inside her seemed to uncoil, and she felt something warm fill the depths of her belly even as she shot her load into Rachel&#39;s depths; both James and Rachel wailing in pleasure.<br />
<br />
James rolled onto the soft carpeted floor as she slipped out of Rachel, unable to keep herself standing after that episode; panting as she still felt her internal testicles boiling, as a thick stream of cum continued to flow from her long pointed shaft.<br />
<br />
Alex giggled, sounding more like a proper girl now. &quot;It would be a waste to not store that nectar somewhere,&quot; Alex said. Facing James, Alex sat herself onto James&#39; shaft, trapping the cum inside her folds. &quot;You are supposed to sire our young after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel sat beside Alex and nuzzled her, clear that their relationship hadn&#39;t changed much even if they were mated to you. &quot;You&#39;ll make a great mother Alex, I&#39;m sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three of them lay together on the carpet, James slowly slipping off to sleep.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
James awoke the next morning feeling bloated. She reached down with a foreclaw and pressed into her upturned belly, feeling a number of semi hard spheres inside her... She&#39;d cum inside herself, just as she was shown... She began to count, becoming contented at the feeling that she was fulfilling her role as her own mate. She could feel five, maybe six of them inside her, only to giggle as she realized she was counting her eggs before she&#39;d even laid them, an odd twist on the old saying.<br />
<br />
Waking up a little more, she noticed her room was now much bigger, and must be taking up an entire floor of the house; with a new stairwell at the edge of the room suggesting this was now a new third floor rather than just the second. Looking around it appeared there were a couple of new closets at the edge of the room, and she was no longer lying on the floor, but on a matrass that took up most of the room&#39;s floorspace.<br />
<br />
Her red and blue partners were snuggling against her, their breasts resting against her own, and their own bellies just as gravid with eggs.<br />
<br />
For a moment, she merely enjoyed the presence of the two; when Rachel began to stir.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... Good surprise party?&quot; Rachel said.<br />
<br />
James giggled. &quot; Yeah, it was,&quot; she said, &quot;is that what you two were here for when I showed up? To prepare a party for when I got back?&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded. &quot;It was our idea, but your dad liked the idea,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
James felt a pang of guilt for running off now. &quot;I should apologise to dad for running off... And I guess not being able to show up to the wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel poked her belly. &quot;As if you can show up to a wedding carrying those, take a break, I&#39;ll explain it to him if we have to.&quot;<br />
<br />
James smiled and nuzzled Rachel, wrapping her wings around her two lovers to hold them closer; drifting into a pleasant nap.</p>
