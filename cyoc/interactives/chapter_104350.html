<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">BEFORE WE BEGIN, A FRIENDLY REMINDER:<br />
For reason(s) unknown, unlike their counterparts on Earths 1 and 3, the were-mers in the Moon Lake of Earth-2 do NOT fall in love at first glance and establish soul mate bounds with those who are destined to become their significant other.<br />
NOW, ON WITH OUR STORY...<br />
<br />
Martin Stovall was beside himself.<br />
He didn&#39;t cheat on his wife Melissa, who was knocking on his office door wanting to come in.<br />
Tempted beyond all belief, yes. But for once he was faithful to his wife.<br />
Yet Alyssa Cooper was alone in the room with him, almost topless and not wearing anything under her skirt, doing her best to try and seduce him.<br />
<i>How the hell am I going to explain this, let alone convince Melissa that for once I&#39;m innocent!</i> he wondered.<br />
Before Martin could decide what to do, Alyssa opened the door to let Melissa in!<br />
&quot;Melissa, hi,&quot; said the blonde rival with a friendly voice and a huge smile. &quot;Come on in. We were just talking about you.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you were you shameless hussy!&quot; yelled Melissa, as she walked into the room. &quot;And you!&quot; she turned, shouting at Martin, while neither Stovall noticed that Alyssa had relocked the door.<br />
&quot;Listen. You have quite a man there,&quot; began Alyssa, trying to calm Melissa down. &quot;I&#39;ve done my best to try and seduce him. Even gave Marty one of my best blow jobs, without his permission, while he was on the phone talking town business with someone. I will admit, Marty tastes as great as ever, but all he kept  telling me even after I sat in his lap and tried to fuck him was that he wasn&#39;t going to cheat on you anymore.&quot;<br />
This statement made both Stovalls gape in shock, but Martin from embarrassment while Melissa wasn&#39;t sure what to think.<br />
&quot;I personally have nothing against the concept of marriage. It&#39;s just not for me right now, so whatever rocky shores you two have washed up on, I hope you find smooth waters and calm seas again soon,&quot; added Alyssa in her most sincere voice, despite the fact that her suit jacket was still totally unbuttoned, exposing her ample bosom and hard nipples.<br />
Before either Stovall could say something, Alyssa suddenly pulled Melissa into a seductive embrace and kissed her!<br />
<br />
Melissa Stovall felt the heat coming from the other woman, even as Alyssa started licking Melissa&#39;s teeth with her tongue while their mouths were still together.<br />
The married woman didn&#39;t know what to do. She had been approached by other men before, but had always turned them down (politely) because of what she believed to be a solid marriage until Melissa discovered Martin&#39;s cheating ways.<br />
Yet even in college, there had never been so much as a curious inquiry from another woman, even as Melissa felt Alyssa Cooper&#39;s bare breasts rubbing against her clothed ones.<br />
When their lips parted, Melissa just stared at her... assailant(?) while Alyssa said, &quot;However, I&#39;m still as horny as all get out and being bi, I don&#39;t have any gender preferences. What say you and me get it on, and maybe Marty will finally come to his senses and we&#39;ll make it a threesome,&quot; she suggested, before giving Melissa Stovall an even longer kiss than the last one, while her hands ran up and down the curves of Melissa&#39;s luscious body.<br />
Before Alyssa Cooper released her potential new lover, she took a quick peek and saw that, despite whatever Marty might say, his cock was straining to be released from his pants to join the action.<br />
Then, without physically letting Melissa Stovall go, Alyssa moved her lips just far enough away from the other woman to speak again.<br />
&quot;What do you say? Want to have some fun?&quot; she asked, while staring deeply into Melissa&#39;s sea green eyes.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
&quot;So, do you understand the plan?&quot; Maggie Lawson asked her daughter Spencer over their cellphone connection during Sophomore lunch at Moon Lake High School.<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Spencer, whispering into her phone to reduce the risk of any weres in the cafeteria from overhearing her.<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; replied her mother. &quot;Do your best to ignore Julie Stovall entirely,&quot; said Maggie, while beginning to repeat the instructions. &quot;Stay in public places, the crowded the better. Always be polite to her, but make sure she initiates any conversation. And if it does come down to a physical altercation you can&#39;t avoid, make sure Julie starts it so you can claim self-defense. I&#39;ve already talked to your father about this and he&#39;s in total agreement with me. So as long as you do your best and are up front and honest with us in this matter, we&#39;ve got your back.&quot;<br />
Spencer knew that, considering some of her past actions, she had earned that last line, yet smiled at the thought of still having the full love and support of both parents. &quot;Did dad have anything to say about this?&quot; she wondered.<br />
&quot;He told me an idea that might help you out, but better you hear it directly from him when he gets home tonight. When I talked to him, he wasn&#39;t sure whether or not it would work out.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay. Well, thankfully neither Eric or I have any classes with her, so hallway encounters and Freshman lunch are the best she can do during school hours,&quot; explained Spencer. &quot;But I&#39;ll call you as soon as we get home, because Eric wants to help me try to catch up with the homework I missed while out recovering from my injuries last week.&quot;<br />
&quot;Despite the fact that you&#39;re a Sophomore and he&#39;s a Freshman?&quot; asked her mother in disbelief.<br />
&quot;Yeah. Isn&#39;t he sweet?&quot; asked Spencer in a tender voice, the tone of which surprised both Lawson females. &quot;Yet he&#39;s got brains as well as good looks, so don&#39;t sell him short.&quot;<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t. After all, he&#39;s dating you,&quot; said Maggie Lawson, and Spencer thought she detected a serious note of happiness in her mother&#39;s voice.<br />
&quot;Okay. Thanks for your help, but lunch is almost over so I have to hang up now. Talk to you later,&quot; promised Spencer, before ending the call.<br />
<br />
As Spencer got up to take care of her post-lunch trash, she was approached by a boy she had never seen before.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re Spencer Lawson, right?&quot; he asked, a bit hesitantly.<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; she replied, a bit suspicious of him.<br />
&quot;Brian Walker, wereotter,&quot; he said. &quot;I was wondering if you could tell me why Julie is trying to get back together with Eric Anderson all of a sudden when she&#39;s supposed to be dating me.&quot;<br />
<i>So this is the guy Eric caught Julie with that led to their break up,</i> realized Spencer, as she quickly told him everything she could.<br />
&quot;Man, that doesn&#39;t make any sense,&quot; said Brian, after hearing Julie&#39;s actions so far trying to break up Spencer and Eric for revenge over being grounded after the Stovall/Anderson break up. &quot;I didn&#39;t know Julie didn&#39;t have permission to be at the lake, but—&quot;<br />
Just then, the bell rang, signaling the changeover between Sophomore and Junior class lunch breaks had begun.<br />
&quot;I know. Weird, right?&quot; asked Spencer. &quot;Eric and I didn&#39;t start dating until <i>after</i> he and Julie broke up, and neither of us had anything to do with her being grounded. You seem like a decent guy, but all I can tell you is to watch your back. Now I have to get to my next class,&quot; she added, before leaving the cafeteria.</p>
