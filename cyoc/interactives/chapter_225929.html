<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Starlight was busy with paperwork, scrolls and piles of parchment stacked high across her office. Queen Glitter offered for her to take the holiday off but Starlight insisted she stay to get caught up on her diplomatic work. <br />
After hours of dull paperwork and silence she thought of her sister, Spa&#39;kalth, she was with her human boyfriend and the red head thought she should check in on the human world. The queen always talked about her ancestors homeland, so she decided to venture to the human realm herself. <br />
<br />
After exiting the fairy portal she grew to human size, much to her surprise she appeared as a human teenager, her orange hair growing out with red tips, her face became splattered with freckles. Starlight summoned a mirror and found that she looked a lot like her sister’s human form, though not decked out in punk attire and heavy makeup. The human looking girl started walking down the sidewalk and was confused as to why everyone she passed seemed upset with her, they either evaded their gaze or shot her disapproving looks. <br />
When she walked by a storefront she saw her reflection and realized she was still naked. Her face went as red as her hair and she ducked behind a corner and chastised herself for forgetting that humans always wore clothes. <br />
She used her magic to conjure human clothing; she was now dressed in a reddish brown shin length midi dress with a frilled white cardigan and a thin brown belt over them. On her feet were chunky brown loafers and her hair was pulled back with a black hair band, warm natural makeup accentuated her cute face. She completed her look with a soft red scarf and brown handbag.<br />
<br />
“Now I’m a perfect human girl!” She exclaimed to herself, <br />
“See Spa&#39;kalth, you don’t have to dress like a ruffian!” <br />
<br />
Once she was dressed she continued down the street and took in the human world around her, she observed their strange rituals and behaviors, trying to decipher their meanings.<br />
While walking backwards tying not to lose sight of a butterfly she ran into someone.<br />
Starlight never understood her sister’s obsession with human males until she saw the handsome boy she ran backwards into, he caught her from falling and his strong grip made her feel fluttery and her face went hot. He had dark skin and his hair was in a half dreaded fade.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry miss, are you alright?” He asked but Starlight was lost in his golden brown eyes.<br />
<br />
“Did you hurt yourself?” He asked, his voice kind but strong.<br />
<br />
“…y-yes… I uh…I was just a little turned around.” She managed to say.<br />
<br />
“You look lost, maybe I can point you in the right direction? Where are you headed?” He asked.<br />
<br />
“…uh, I was trying to get to my sisters’… I-I actually don’t really know where she lives.” Starlight blushed when she realized she had no idea where the Morelands lived exactly, on the few occasions she visited them she always used magic gateways.<br />
<br />
“I’ve worked with less, I’m Decon by the way, and you are?” He introduced.<br />
<br />
“Oh! I-I’m Starlight, I love to meet you—I mean it’s nice to meet you.” She smiled nervously.<br />
<br />
“Starlight. That’s a cute name, it suits you.” He smiled.<br />
<br />
The fairy became even redder and ran away without thinking, her heart was pounding and when she realized what she did she shouted,<br />
“I-I think it’s this way!” <br />
<br />
Decon laughed and ran after her. Starlight was not used to running especially in her human form so after less than a minute she sank to her knees and panted.<br />
Before the red head could ask for help he had already picked her up an carried her in his arms, she couldn’t resist the urge to place her hand on his chest, she felt his heartbeat and sensed he had a good heart. <br />
<br />
“So where does your sister live anyway?” He asked.<br />
<br />
“…oh, uh she lives at the Morelands’ but I’m afraid I don’t know where that is.” She said in a shy pout.<br />
<br />
Decon chuckled and shook his head, <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, I know where their farm is. Do you think you can walk or would you rather I carry you there?” He said.<br />
<br />
Starlight’s cheeks went red again and she screamed out of his arms. She couldn’t understand why she was acting like a complete ditz like her sisters. She slapped her cheeks and recomposed herself.<br />
<br />
“I-I can walk. T-thank you—just l-lead the way.” She said.<br />
<br />
As the two walked she clasped her hands in front of her nervously, whenever their eyes met she quickly looked away. <br />
He’s just a human, sure you haven’t met very many but you’re one of the queen’s advisers! You helped broker peace with the unseelie! Stop acting like a halfwit! She told herself.<br />
<br />
“You said you were here to visit your sister, I didn’t know the Morelands had a daughter.” He asked.<br />
<br />
“N-no! I’m not related to them—well kind of—I’m Spa’kal—Spark’s sister. She’s staying with the Morelands.” Starlight explained.<br />
<br />
“Ah, Connor’s girlfriend, she’s new at school. I couldn’t tell that you were her sister right away, you’re so different from her—in a good way I mean.” He replied.<br />
<br />
“Yes, my little sister is quite the strong headed tomboy, always doing things her way and making trouble.” The red haired fairy sighed.<br />
<br />
“That sounds like her. My sister, Serena, is a cheerleader and she’s been trying to get Spark to join the cheerleading team ever since she got here.” Decon said.<br />
<br />
“Ha! My sister as a cheerleader! Now that’s something I’d like to see, maybe I can make her try out. It would be good for her to have an extracurricular activity besides loitering around on her skateboard after school.” Starlight said and smiled.</p>
