<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I have to do something... this can&#39;t be normal... I don&#39;t know what to do!<br />
<br />
I tried to distract myself from what was happening with Mike, so I spent the whole morning trying not to dwell on my altered body. Today I didn&#39;t shave, I didn&#39;t look in the mirror and I tried to take care of my body as little as possible. After my morning coffee I decided I was just going to play my X-box all day, so I sat in front of the TV in my pajamas (a pair of shorts and a white t-shirt) and a bathrobe and started playing. I think in hindsight, it was a very, very bad decision.<br />
<br />
The bell rang around 11 o&#39;clock and when I opened the door I was surprised to see Brandon standing outside. He tried calling or texting me several times in the past few days, but I didn&#39;t want to respond to his messages. Now he was standing in front of the door. He was wearing gray jeans and a brown hoodie, and his face was covered by a short stubble. I decided that if he was already here, I would let him in. I opened the door wide and signaled for him to come in with my hand. As he passed me, I smelled his scent, which affected me like a drug. All of a sudden, I could only think of what could be under that brown hoodie, what would it be like to caress that supposedly hairy muscular body? As I looked at Brandon&#39;s unshaven face and blue eyes, I felt an invincible urge. My body instinctively knew what to do, I practically couldn&#39;t control myself. I got an erection right away, but it was the strongest I&#39;ve ever experienced. It felt like my penis was constantly growing, without stopping. With my now much stronger, more muscular body, I pushed Brandon against the wall, pressed his hands against the wall with both hands, rubbed my penis against his thigh and started kissing him. I felt every muscle tensing up in his surprise, he resisted for a moment, and then he kissed back wildly. I felt his bristly face with my face, I felt with my leg that something like a snake was moving in his pants. I don&#39;t know how long we kissed, but beyond a point my body wanted more. Somehow we ended up in the living room, where we tore each other&#39;s clothes off. Brandon was even hairier than I expected. His chest and belly, from his neck to his groin, were covered in a continuous, rich, manly coat of fur. It&#39;s not animal fur yet, but it&#39;s unnaturally much for an almost teenage guy. I immediately ran my hand into his chest, as if I was petting an animal, while I felt myself getting more and more excited. My penis was dripping with precum, which I used to smear Brandon&#39;s legs. Meanwhile, Brandon was equally excited about my body. He caressed my hair, which was little compared to his, and licked my nipple, while he knelt down in front of me and began to suck me. I couldn&#39;t take it anymore, I wanted him to be more four-handed in front of me, and Brandon seemed to understand. He turned around and knelt down in front of me, and that&#39;s when I saw his tight, round ass covered in thick fur. Without thinking, I penetrated and began intercourse with him with steady, forceful movements. Meanwhile, something happened. Brandon&#39;s back, which had been mostly bare until now, suddenly started getting hairy right in front of my eyes, which of course only made me more excited. The fur began to spread over his shoulders and connect to his chest. I grabbed his newly grown back hair, which must have hurt Brandon a bit, and at this point I couldn&#39;t hold it any longer. I could feel the sperm starting from my testicles and shooting straight into Brandon….<br />
<br />
And at this point I came to my consciousness, and so did Brandon, or it seemed like. I was still gripping the fur on Brandon&#39;s back with my hand, and I noticed that my arm was much hairier than before. I turned my head to the right where I saw ourselves in the large wall mirror in the living room. I still didn&#39;t pull out my penis, I felt that my erection had not yet passed. My hand gripped the fur still on Brandon&#39;s back. Brandon&#39;s body changed, he became even more hairy than before. With his furry back, he looked like he was somewhere between an ape and a human. Now I found the situation, the hair, not exciting, but disgusting. And then I saw myself in the mirror. The hair on my arms was much thicker, as well as on my chest and stomach. My face was covered by a thick stubble. I&#39;m about as hairy as Brandon was when he walked in the door about half an hour ago. The whole situation was disgusting. I discovered a similar shock on Brandon&#39;s face, especially when he noticed how hairy he had become. I pulled my penis out of him and he started acting almost panicky. I saw fear and shock on his face, he mumbled something like &quot;this must be a side effect&quot;, that &quot;he has to go, he doesn&#39;t want to end up like an animal&quot;, but I couldn&#39;t get any meaningful words out of him. Practically when he pulled his pants back up, he ran out of the apartment shirtless...<br />
<br />
I don&#39;t know what to do, but what has happened to me and Brandon is not normal. I remember I talked him about my experiment when I met him a few days ago, I&#39;m sure he referenced that. But why did not waited some more answers from me? Why did he act so strange? What if anyone I&#39;m having sex with ends up like him. Shit, this idea, this turns me on. Changing anyone into a hairy beast while we are having sex. So much opportunity, so much...what the fuck am I thinking about! It&#39;s terrible, disgusting. It&#39;s too late for now for tiday, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;m going to the doc tomorrow.</p>
