<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After witnessing Teri dispense ten penises for her wife, you began to feel a bit mischievous.  Sneaking up behind the short hermaphrodite with one of your other bodies, you suddenly grabbed her top pair of arms and tried to pull them off.  To your surprise however, the only result was an annoyed cry of pain as Teri turned and scolded you, &quot;Ow!  What&#39;s the big idea?!  Did you forget that modular people can only separate their body parts if they do it themselves?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m very sorry, I didn&#39;t know,&quot; you responded apologetically, &quot;I&#39;ve never gotten to know anyone like you personally.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, please ask next time if you need something,&quot; the shortstack said, getting a bit calmer after knowing it wasn&#39;t your intent to hurt her.  &quot;What did you want my arms for, anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
Truth be told, you hadn&#39;t thought that far ahead.  Thinking on the fly, you responded, &quot;Oh, I was just curious what would happen if you tried reattaching them to yourself elsewhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Teri said while rubbing her shoulder, &quot;Well, it would probably just be easiest to show you, plus then these darned shoulders should heal up, no thanks to you.&quot;  Using her middle pair of arms, she grabbed her top pair and detached them, shoulders and all.  As the smooth corners of her torso started regrowing her arms, she proceeded to reattach the original pair beneath Mona&#39;s arms, giving her eight total, of which six were hers to control.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that seems useful,&quot; you remarked before asking with your left head, &quot;Will the bottom pair grow back if you remove them again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stroking her chin, Teri admitted, &quot;You know, while I&#39;ve added parts to myself on a couple very rare occasions, I never tried removing them again.&quot;  Seeing the fascination in your eyes, she shrugged and said, &quot;Well, since you&#39;ve got me curious now too...&quot;  Grabbing the arms she just stuck to herself moments prior, the shorter woman yanked them off again and watched intently to see what would happen.  To both of your surprise, a new pair started growing in to replace them, even though they weren&#39;t originally part of her body.  &quot;Well dang, guess I better be sure going forward if I really want a new part before I stick it to myself all willy-nilly.&quot;  Looking at the severed limbs still in her hands, she remarked, &quot;Not really sure if I really want a permanent fifth pair right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Holding out your hands, you offered, &quot;I&#39;ve got an idea for what to do with them, if you don&#39;t mind.&quot;  A bit hesitant at first, Teri finally handed them over after you promised not to turn around and stick them back on her body.  After thanking her, you turned your attention to the clone of Consuela who was currently entangling her slimy tentacles with the rubbery appendages and cock-tails of one of Mary&#39;s duplicates.  Wondering if Teri&#39;s limbs could stick to the maid&#39;s liquid body and if they would turn into more slime, you walked over to the veritable pile of boobs and inserted the arms right beneath where her goo tentacles emerged.  After a couple seconds, you noticed the shoulders starting to turn red and translucent.  In no time at all, the rest of the skin followed suit, giving Consuela two gooey new arms to work with.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, gracias, I always wondered what it would be like to have hands,&quot; the maid said after she realized what happened.  Suddenly you felt a pang of guilt after realizing the alterations you made meant that she no longer recalled something so basic as having hands.  Wondering if you could maybe do something to make it up to her, you had your body with the phone in another room generate a sentence about Consuela.<br />
<br />
&quot;The gooey maid is enjoying herself while using her new arms to pleasure the scylla.&quot;<br />
<br />
As you were considering your options, Mona peeked at the screen before suggesting, &quot;What if you used the word &#39;morph&#39; somewhere?  I always imagined growing up that slimegirls must have a lot of freedom with their bodies, so I was pretty surprised when I found out later how limited they are.&quot;  Agreeing with her, you changed the sentence to read:<br />
<br />
&quot;The gooey maid is morphing herself while using her new arms to pleasure the scylla.&quot;<br />
<br />
After submitting the change, noticed reality shift as you looked over at Consuela.  As her gooey tentacles penetrated Mary&#39;s vaginas and her hands fondled her bottom pair of borrowed breasts, you witnessed two more tendrils begin to push out of the goo girl&#39;s sides.  Quickly forming into arms, she immediately put them to work fingering the scylla&#39;s pussynipples on her middle breasts.  Next, her head swelled and grew sideways before splitting into three copies, allowing her to lean forward and kiss all three of Mary&#39;s top row of lipples.<br />
<br />
Satisfied with your handiwork, you turned your attention back to Teri, whose body still held so many unanswered questions for you.  Approaching her and working with Mona&#39;s two torsos conjoined to you, the shortstack started moaning as your numerous hands set about pleasuring her all over.  Leaning in, you asked, &quot;Hey, I got another question about your sexy body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, and what would that be?&quot; she asked, clearly more receptive now that you were making her feel good.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you detach something- say, Mona&#39;s arms,- can you disassemble it further before placing them on another person?&quot; you asked while continuing to massage her breasts.<br />
<br />
Amazed by how flexible your mind was, she responded, &quot;I&#39;m surprised you thought of something that advanced already, I didn&#39;t figure that one out til college.&quot;  Grabbing her lavender-toned third pair of arms and removing them, she continued, &quot;Yes, I can, so what mischief are you planning?&quot;<br />
<br />
Seeing a new pair of purple limbs already growing in, then noticing Mona&#39;s mouthless faces next to Teri&#39;s head, you asked, &quot;Would it be possible to separate your palm-mouths, then attach them to Mona&#39;s heads next to yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
Clearly overjoyed at the suggestion, one of your own Mona-heads chimed in, &quot;Oooh, yes please!  That has always bothered me about our merge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why didn&#39;t we think of that sooner?&quot; Teri concurred with an amount of confusion.  Obliging your request, she used her other arms to essentially peel the mouths off of the arms she was holding, then reattached them to her passenger&#39;s faces.  Since they were already purple-ish, it appeared that no change was necessary.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath with either head on Teri&#39;s body, Mona contentedly declared, &quot;Ahh, that feels so much better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now what do we do with the rest of these arms?&quot; the shortstack asked.  &quot;I don&#39;t know why you stuck the last pair on the maid when she seems perfectly capable of making her own arms.<br />
<br />
Overhearing your conversation, one of Sarah&#39;s scylla clones interjected, &quot;I&#39;ll take them, if you don&#39;t mind.  I could use all the arms I can get to try managing these cock-tails.&quot;<br />
<br />
Raising an eyebrow at you to see if you minded, you nodded that it was okay.  In fact, it was the perfect opportunity to see what would happen if a detached part belonging to Mona got stuck to someone who hadn&#39;t been parasitized by the succubus yet.  As the scylla-kitsune accepted the arms and placed them under her fourth pair of arms, it wasn&#39;t long before they melded with her skin.  In the process, the lavender tint drained away from them, changing to match the rest of her fair skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, I can&#39;t feel those arms anymore,&quot; Mona remarked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You might not, but I still can,&quot; Teri digressed, &quot;Not that I can move them myself or anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
As you were discussing this, the kitsune in question underwent mitosis again, clearly turning herself on with the extra pair of handjobs she wasted no time in giving herself.  After duplicating, both clones still had the extra pair of limbs, adding to the sensations experienced by the short hermaphrodite.  Wondering if there was some way to make it easier for Teri to distribute her body parts to the rest of the vastly spread out clones of everyone, you got to wondering if she could essentially &quot;build&quot; herself an extra body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say, are you game to try out one more thing?&quot; you asked hopefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps...?&quot; Teri replied warily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you split off your legs and waist?&quot;<br />
<br />
Seeing a chance to needle you, Mona commented, &quot;My, I didn&#39;t realize you were a leg woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ignoring off her wife&#39;s comment, the shortstack laid down on the floor before pushing down on her hips with her hands.  After her body had been split in two, Teri asked you to move aside her legs so that the new ones would be able to grow in comfortably.<br />
<br />
As she was about to get back up, you stopped her, saying, &quot;Wait, there&#39;s one more thing to do while you&#39;re down there.&quot;  Seeing her puzzled expression, you requested, &quot;Can you try it the opposite way, detaching your whole upper body?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean op-&quot; she started to reply before it clicked.  &quot;Uh, sure, I&#39;ll try it,&quot; she agreed.  Repeating more or less the same process, she envisioned the upper half of her body getting separated instead of her waist, then pushed.  Moving aside her torso, you both watched intently to see what would happen.  After a few moments, the smooth skin on top of her detached waist began to grow, quickly forming a new upper body.  Stunned, Teri could only stare at herself with both heads.<br />
<br />
However, you had other priorities.  &quot;Great, that means I can try this...&quot; you declared with a smug grin.  Before Teri could object, you attached her separated legs and torso to each other.  Just as you hoped, they reattached properly, creating a whole second body for the shortstack.<br />
<br />
Getting up from the floor with both bodies, Teri wordlessly reached out to touch herselves, hardly able to believe her senses.  She was having quite the out of body experience, twice over.  &quot;Wow, having two bodies feels so... different,&quot; one of her said before the other continued, &quot;But... I kind of like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll get used to it fast,&quot; her wife encouraged her as she used one of her arms to fondle their shared breasts.<br />
<br />
Nodding in agreement, you added, &quot;You&#39;ll find most of us living here enjoy the experience so much that we can&#39;t get enough.&quot;  Speaking with a different clone of yourself, you offered, &quot;If you like, we can help your assemble more bodies for yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
After showing her how good it felt to experience twice as much sex as usual, Teri became quite receptive to the idea.  Heading off to another room with both of her and a group of your own copies, you worked together to build more Teris.  As the shortstack kept splitting apart her bodies, you assembled them for her, each one joining in to increase the rate of production.  In the meantime, your own sex with your housemates and your own duplicates kept allowing you to multiply as well.  After a while, your operation had spread to encompass around twenty rooms in the limitless house, and you began putting together about 250 clones of Teri every five minutes.  As the duplicates of the hermaphrodite dispersed throughout the house, she willingly offered extra body parts to anyone who asked for them.<br />
<br />
Insatiable in her desire for more bodies of her own, as well as more variety in them, Sarah used her kitsune abilities to convert a fair number of Teri&#39;s bodies into new clones of herself, which she then used to start up her own production line and make even more of herself.  Of course, she also used the renewable source of extra body parts to enhance herself in various ways, too.  Elsewhere, she also converted a few clones of Consuela, gaining new bodies that looked like golden slime girls with gooey fox ears and tails.  Like the maid, she found that she could infuse cum with her spirit to create more slime-kitsunes that shared her consciousness.<br />
<br />
Holding the phone in one hand, you pondered what to do next.</p>
