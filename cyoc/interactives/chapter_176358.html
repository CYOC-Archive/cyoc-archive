<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Giles turned off the water and stepped out of the shower, grabbing a towel to dry his massive frame. It had been almost two months since he had met Tony in that bar and let the man convince him to suck him off. His name had been Thomas back then, but that name didn’t seemed distant and foreign to him now. He ran the towel over his chest, appreciating again his firm and hairy pectorals. His belly was large and round, a layer of cushioning fat covering the hard muscle lurking underneath. His stomach, his broad round shoulders, and his meaty arms were likewise covered in a mat of wiry hairs the same dark color as his close-shaven black hair and bushy beard. His thick, thirteen inch cock hung over a pair of baseball sized testicles; his legs and groin were a forest of bushy hair like the rest of his new body. Giles loved his hairy, muscle-daddy body though. As Thomas he had always been very athletic, but he had always had trouble putting on mass and building bigger muscle. Thomas had been prolific at tennis and even won awards at cross-country races, but he’d always wanted to player the harder contact sports. Then he met a friendly bear of a man at the gym who’d noticed the young man working out. Tony promised him quicker path to Thomas’ dreams; all he had to do was suck his big, meaty cock. It seemed like a cruel frat joke at the time, but something about the Tony compelled him to take the muscle-bear up on his offer. Giles was born that day, and the rest was history.<br />
<br />
Giles hung the towel and entered his bedroom. His wardrobe had become a lot simpler lately, consisting of mostly leather and denim and shirts that fit just tight enough to show off his heavy muscle gut to the boys. He put on only a tight T-shirt, deciding he’d free-ball it tonight and just wear a pair of faded jeans. His big cock stirred at the thought of cruising the bars, picking up some sweet young twink to take home and wreck for the night. As a straight man his sex-life had been sporadic and bland. But now, he felt a churning desire in his swollen balls that brought him out on the town on every free night his had. He found he loved fucking smaller, more submissive men. He relished at ordering them around in his deep, commanding voice, and delighted in manhandling their petite forms as fucked them hard against a wall, or bent over the couch. <br />
<br />
The thought made his shlong harden and lengthen, hanging almost down to his knees. His balls churned with a pleasurable but also uncomfortable sensation, like he had been jerking for hours with no release. Giles started to feel hot, and a heavy sense of urgency and need started to settle over his mind, different from his usual constant state of arousal. Giles realized that it had been two months and he still had yet to complete the change by passing on the virus. He cock grew fully hard at the thought of finding some poor desperate straight man, of convincing him to suck his Giles’ throbbing prick and join him. He loved his new life as a horny gay muscle-daddy, but he wasn’t sure if he was ready to subject another man to this. However, the burning need in his balls only grew stronger until they were aching and throbbing, his cock painfully hard. Giles started to get anxious, not feeling like he still had the patience find a man on the town. No, there had to be someone he could call.  He hadn’t talked to his gym bros since the first week of his change, when the thought of having his way with them in the shower stalls had convinced him to stay away while his paranoid mind had dealt with the changes. But now it was time to reach out. Giles felt his masculine confidence returning as he thought of just the perfect person to invite over.<br />
<br />
His friend Anthony had been his gym mentor, teaching him the common methods and routines that bulkers used when they wanted to develop large muscle mass. Anthony was naturally a big man, his muscular, athletic body gone ever-so-slightly to fat in the years since he’d graduated college and quit wrestling. Anthony was a big man, tall and broad with wide shoulders and a natural penchant for putting on mass. He had confided in Giles one time back when he was still Thomas, telling him he often had trouble keeping a girlfriend because his cock was usually too big for them to take without pain. He’d be perfect, Giles thought, and he pulled up Anthony’s number on his phone.<br />
<br />
“Hey, man. What’s going on?” he texted. A painful minute passed while Giles paced the room, trying to ignore his aching balls swing between his thighs.<br />
<br />
“Yo, man! Where u been? I haven’t seen you at the gym.” Anthony finally replied.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, man. I’ve been really busy at work,” Giles texted furiously. “Sorry I lost touch. Wanna come over and catch up? I was about to go out on the town.” He finished. Another throbbing moment and Anthony replied. <br />
“Shit, yeah man. I’m down to get my dick wet tonight. Be over in 20.” <br />
<br />
“Oh, baby,” said Giles, dropping the phone on the couch. “The only man getting his dick wet tonight is me.”<br />
<br />
Giles poured himself a glass of whiskey, neat as he’d started taking it now, and wondered how he was gonna walk Anthony through this. Thomas had been 5’9 and a 180 pounds; now Giles towered over 6’5’ and weighed 284 at his last check-up. Anthony would never believe that this massive beast was his former slim lifting-partner. Giles approached the mirror admiring his masculine, hairy body. His big nipples perked up through his white shirt, already stretched taught by his heavy muscle-gut. His big cock and still aching balls made a nice tight bulge in the crotch of his pants, and his firm round ass filled the seat nicely as well. Overall he had become quite the studly muscle-man, a beautiful hairy daddy that loved turning lesser men out nice and good. He couldn’t wait any longer for Anthony to arrive!<br />
<br />
Finally he heard a knock on his apartment door, and a deep bass voice shout, “Lemme in, fucker!” in a jovial tone. Giles took a deep breath and strode across the room, setting his story straight in his mind before opening the door. <br />
Anthony stood in the door, a sudden look of confusion on his handsome face. Giles had forgotten what a hot man he was, or at least now he really noticed. Anthony’s thick black hair was wet and swept back, as if he’d come straight from the shower. He wore a tight black shirt with a V-neck that showed the cleft of his hard and well-developed pectorals. His arms were corded with muscle and his six pack was visible through his shirt. Other than his close-shaven beard, Anthony had always had very little body hair.<br />
“Hey, man. Ugh, is Thomas here?” he asked, sizing up ‘Thomas’s’ massive form.<br />
<br />
“He stepped out to grab us some beer. I’m his uncle, Giles. I’m in town visiting my nephew. Come in!” He stood back from the door, puffing out his impressive chest and ushering the man in with a wave of his massive paw. Anthony looked uncertain but strode into the room confidently and seated himself on the couch. <br />
<br />
“Nice to meet you Giles. Name’s Anthony.” He reached into his pocket and pulled out a lighter and a slender little case, from which he extracted a carefully rolled blunt. “You mind? Thomas and I usually burn one down before we go out.” He said.<br />
<br />
“I don’t mind at all. I fancy a good stogie myself.” Giles replied. He cockily sauntered over to the couch, seating himself opposite Anthony and spreading his powerfully muscled thighs wide to let show his impressive bulge. Anthony didn’t seem to notice. <br />
<br />
“Would you like?” <br />
<br />
“Please.”<br />
<br />
They took a few puffs each. The pot seemed to calm Giles’ anxiety down some; he settled in and started to enjoy the hunt.<br />
<br />
“So, you just get into town?” asked Anthony, checking his phone.<br />
<br />
“Nah, been staying here a few weeks now. I’m thinking about moving out here?” Giles replied.<br />
<br />
“I didn’t know Thomas had an uncle.” Anthony looked Giles up and down again. “Don’t take this the wrong way, man, but you are jacked! Those are some serious gains.” He complimented.<br />
<br />
Giles smiled through his bushy beard, feeling his cock stir. “Thanks, son. You’re looking good yourself. Keep up the good work.”<br />
<br />
Something about this strange man seemed to put Anthony’s mind more and more at ease. He could smell a strong musk in the air, a sultry scent that seemed to be emanating from the big man sitting opposite him on the couch. It made his dick chub up some, but that was normal when it was just guys, right?<br />
<br />
His contentment growing, Anthony said, “And I gotta say, man. I’m jealous of all that hair. I’ve always been smooth; the ladies love it, but I sometimes wished I was like those hairy, muscly guys like you? You know?” <br />
That was all the encouragement Giles needed. “Well, it doesn’t take as much effort as you’d think,” he said, his grin turning predatory.<br />
<br />
“You say that. My bro Thomas has been trying for years, but the poor guy can’t put on mass. I guess its just genes, at the end of the day,” Anthony said whistfully.<br />
<br />
“Not necessarily. The method I used had me bulking up in about 8 weeks. Now I’m a beast!” he said, slapping his gut and laughing.<br />
<br />
Anthony shifted uncomfortably; as he admired the muscle-man’s efforts his eyes kept coming to rest on Giles’ bulging crotch. He was no slouch himself, but damn that thing had to be huge! However, he was interested to hear more about Giles’ routine.<br />
<br />
“So how did you do it, man?” he asked curiously.<br />
<br />
“I met a handsome member of this new men’s health company, Tony; he gave me something special that helps a man rapidly gain mass and grow hairier.” Giles said.<br />
<br />
“Like testosterone suppliments?” <br />
<br />
“Basically. He gave me an offer that seemed outlandish at the time, but now I think it was the best decision of my life.”<br />
<br />
“What did he offer you?” Anthony asked, but something inside him felt like he knew the answer.<br />
<br />
“The same thing that I’m about to offer you right now.” Giles finally unzipped himself and let his throbbing 13 inches spill out of his pants, his balls popping out with them. Anthony was frozen by the audacity of the move.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck, man?”<br />
<br />
“I sucked Tony’s dick, and gave to me a virus that transformed me into the beautiful muscle-bear you see now. Suck my big cock, and I promise you can enjoy the same benefits that I did.” Giles hefted his cock by the base of his shaft and wagged it in Anthony’s direction. Anthony seemed paralyzed, his straight-man’s instincts recoiling in disgust at the sight of this hairy bear flexing his giant shlong at him. But something in him prevented him from rushing out the door. That masculine musk filled his nose again, stronger this time now that the big cock was free, and Anthony found himself wondering how firm and warm that cock would feel in his hands. His mouth watered as he looked at the gargantuan purple head and throbbing shaft; a few drops of pre cum started to leak from the tip and Anthony found himself wanting to taste it.<br />
<br />
Giles’s balls were starting to feel like they were clamped in a vice grip. He needed to turn this young man, and he needed to do it now.<br />
<br />
“Come on, Boy.” He said, wagging his cock again. “Suck Daddy’s cock, I can see the hunger in your eyes.” He said, a lustful growl in his voice.<br />
<br />
Without a word, Anthony stood up and approached the big man, getting down to his knees and coming face-to-face with the giant throbbing member.<br />
<br />
“Pull my pants down, Boy.” Giles ordered. Anthony did as he was told, fully exposing Giles’ gargantuan cock and balls. Anthony had never seen a cock this big, not even in porn. His own nine inch cock was throbbing in his pants as he watched the schlong bob and twitch with the sexy man’s heartbeat.<br />
<br />
“Come on, Boy. It ain’t gonna suck itself.” Giles leaned back and folded his arms behind his head.<br />
<br />
Anthony took the cock in one hand; even in his big hands, the cock felt large and heavy, and warm. His fingers could barely wrap around its girth as he gave it a few experimental strokes. It felt like his own cock, hard and warm, but smooth and sensitive. He leaned forward and took the head in his mouth; the skin was soft under his tongue and the cock bucked playfully every time he hit a pleasure spot. Anthony worked the cock deeper in his mouth, encouraged by the bigger man’s guttural grunts and growls. Giles’s big paws came to rest on either side of Anthony’s head as he held him on place, slightly pushing him down further along his hard length. Anthony cough and his eyes watered; what a time to discover he had no gag reflex. He nose came to rest in Giles thick rug of pubic hair and he took a deep whiff of that strong, masculine scent that seemed to be coming from the beg bear. Anthony could feel the big man’s balls churn against his chin as he worked himself up and down, taking longer strokes and running his tongue around the head and glans wildly as he did so. One hand began to cradle and tenderly massage Giles enormous balls, while the other rested on the big man’s expansive muscle gut, running through his wirey body hair. Anthony imagined himself being muscled and hairy like Giles. He doubled his efforts and started working Giles’ cock with reckless abandon, the big man leaning back with his arms over the back of the bed as he let his new Boy do his work.<br />
<br />
Finally, Giles had had enough and was ready for release. He held onto Anthony’s head and stood up, not letting him remove his aching cock from his tender mouth. Then he secured his grip and began to roughly face fuck Anthony. He knelt there, feeling the giant schlong gliding through his mouth and down his through in rapid thrusts, the big man’s balls slapping against his face. He was loving every second of it, stroking his own cock furiously while the big man finished his work. He took one final thrust before shoving himself as deep as he could down the smaller man’s throats, dumping ounces of cum into the man’s stomach. His balls heaved and churned, pulling against his body until they finally relaxed and Giles was overcome by a wave of victorious relief. He felt a moan from around his still-hard cock and watched as Anthony finished himself off, groaning and shuddering as his cock spewed cum all over the floor at Giles’ feet. Giles smiled and laughed; he loved to see his boys get off on loving his cock. Giles held himself inside Anthony’s mouth for another few moments, making sure the young man had swallowed every last drop before withdrawing his expansive tool from Anthony’s throat. He felt like a fire-house was being pulled out of his mouth. He wiped his mouth and stared at the slowly softening cock in front of him, his post-nut clarity hitting him like a ton of bricks.<br />
<br />
What had he just done? He’d gone out to meet with his old friend and troll for pussy, but instead he ends up staying in with his muscle-bear uncle and sucking him off? Anthony was confused and didn’t know how to feel. Giles was sensing this and went over to his liquor cabinet to pour them both a drink. He neglected to put on pants, feeling proud of his new conquest as his semi-hard cock led the way through the room. He handed Anthony a glass of whiskey, who quickly pounded it and tried to avert his gaze from the schlong that had been assaulting his mouth and throat only moments before.<br />
<br />
“I know how you feel, Anthony. I felt confused too.” Giles said, sitting down and stroking himself absent-mindedly. “But trust me, with each day you’ll feel better and better.” He sipped his whiskey, and smiled.<br />
<br />
“I can’t believe I just did that. How did you…? I’m not…” Anthony’s voice trailed off. He never had a problem with the gays; his brother was gay. But the idea of curling up next to another naked man in any capacity had always made his skin crawl. <br />
<br />
“You may not be now. But you will be when the virus has run its course.” Said Giles coolly, sensing his thoughts again.<br />
<br />
“Wait, what? You gave me a std?” Anthony exclaimed in outrage.<br />
<br />
Giles laughed. “Yes and no. The virus is what transforms us inot virile, sexy men. But one of the side effects is it also makes you gay. Which seems disappointing at first but,” Giles lifted up his arms and flexed his guns, grinning through his bushy beard and holding his chest muscles taught. “As you can see it does a man damn good.”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Anthony connected the dots. “Wait…are you…? Thomas?” he asked incredulously. <br />
<br />
“And circle gets the square! Yeah, bro. Its me. And the name is Giles, now.” He remined him.<br />
<br />
Anthony looked the hulking bear up and down incredulously. Lithe, petit Thomas? Turned into this big gay hunk? Anthony shook his head.<br />
<br />
“Well, it least you finally got your gains,” he muttered, admiring the way Giles’ hairy muscled pectorals rested over his big, firm gut. “Will I get big and hairy like you?” he asked, a sense of ease starting to build within him.<br />
<br />
“Maybe you’ll come to be as big as your Daddy, maybe you’ll turn into something else.” He picked up the forgotten half of the blunt and lit it, taking it up to his full lips and pulling a deep drag. Anthony realized it made the man look sexy, powerful, to see him casually but confidently drawing on the little cigar. Damn, that beard of his frames that jaw so nicely, Anthony thought. Wait, where did that come from?<br />
<br />
“Who said you’re my ‘Dady’?” asked Anthony with a defiant tone. Giles frowned and stood up, approaching the smaller men and leaning over him. Anthony cowered a little bit, but he knew the man wouldn’t hurt him. Giles reached a big paw out and held Anthony by the back of his head, gently but forefully.<br />
<br />
“Aren’t I,” he said in a rumbling husky voice. He kissed Anthony hard on the kips, his rough tongue finding its way inside his mouth and melding with Anthony’s. He thought he would resist, but Anthony seemed to melt into the man’s embrace, the virus already beginning its work at slowly transforming his formerly straight body…</p>
