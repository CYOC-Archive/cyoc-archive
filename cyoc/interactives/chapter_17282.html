<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cindy, Kevin oldest daughter was niether blind or ignorant of what went on inside the family. My coming in the middle of the night and searching the house with Joan could have woke the dead, but instead alerted Cindy.<br />
<br />
She stayed in the shadows and watching while listening she got the drift of what I told her mother. Our hiding place for the glasses were to say the least an easy spot for Cindy to reach and take.<br />
<br />
I was informed of this by her mother even before Kevin was released from the hospital. She had taken the golden pair of glasses and wishing to try them herself she ventured foolishly outside the house.<br />
<br />
Seated in the gazebo she placed them on her face and while adjusting them was addressed by the spirit with governed the glasses.<br />
<br />
Like her father she was told and wanred as to what the glasses were normally capeable, but not everything they could make to happen. She did as had Kevin and placed them on looking at the surroundings there of the recent past.<br />
<br />
It was when she suggested the time be farther in the past and thought of their town's historic placement in the civil war era, she found something of interest to her. <br />
<br />
Told to remain still and not try to touch or move about less she be dragged into that time and place, Cindy did as it was ordered. While looking at the passing traffic of humanity she took notice of a line of infantry moving along the road in front of the house.<br />
<br />
Foolishly she moved but the glasses remained steady and set over the bridge of her cute nose. Her moevment across the open front lawn did nothing to the displacement in time. She came to stand by the front gate and watched with interest the happening there on main street.<br />
<br />
Now her seeing what she saw while her real present body was still in her own time a Mother seeing her daughter standing like some statue took a second look. Screaming her fears Joan rushed out the front door of their home having seen those golden glasses on her daughter's cute nose.<br />
<br />
As the glasses offered sights of things past or future they did nothing to offer sounds of things in the present. The screaming words of a mother fearing the death of her daughter were heard by Cindy and it made for her a mistake.<br />
<br />
Hearing her Mother's screams of worry, Cindy walked quickly back to the gazebo. As she did the spirit from with the glasses spoke to her of being with great caution less she fall and the glasses drop off her face.<br />
<br />
Mumbling to herself as she walked to the back lawn and away from her Mother, Cindy saw the rear of the house back in the 1800's. A large brown wooden barn stood some distance from where the gazebo stood now. A corral having two horses looking her way and about the barnyard were a number of other animals milling about.<br />
<br />
Cindy side stepped a Bloodhound dog laying on the ground, she walked toward the gazebo seeing those things in the past and forgetting that they were not real unless she took off the glasses.<br />
<br />
As if her own presence there was spooking the horses it made the dog get up and begin to growl and bark in her direction. <br />
<br />
Suddenly all the animals about the barnyard were on alert and standing or milling about being nervous over something.<br />
<br />
Cindy seeing the past and out the side of the glasses watching for her direction back to the gazebo she tried to pay attention to both.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beware!&quot; said the spirit in the glasses to Cindy. &quot;Walk around the animals never through them less you trip and fall. Worse too if in falling over them you fall on and into their physical aurora. I you do so that animal or its parts thereof will meld into your aurora and return to present time as part of your body!&quot; warned the glasses.<br />
<br />
Urgency, and approaching Mother, and trying to eye her way back to the gazebo all had a part in what happened.<br />
<br />
A Mother's yell for a daughter to stop and be careful not to remove the glasses, it was enough of a distraction for Cindy. Seeing the barking Hound and the horses prancing about in the corral, flock of duck and chickens flutter past, she turned to focus on the gazebo out the corner of her glasses only to see a vague form run in front of her.<br />
<br />
A side stepping action worked against her and she fell forward. One hand grabbed for the glasses so as to not let them fall from her head. The other hand reached out to break her fall, but she cut right through the passing animal.<br />
<br />
Kicking and stumbling about she made her way to the steps of the gazebo. One hand to hold the glasses she struggled to stand and climb into the small building where it would be safe to remove the acursed glasses.<br />
<br />
Joan stood not ten yards away her face white from shock. <br />
<br />
Staggering to stand up Cindy removed the glasses and told her Mother she was alright.<br />
<br />
Joan, white faced and wide eyed came to her daughter and took hold of Cindy's shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, damn it, look what you have for legs!&quot; screamed a terrified mother to her daughter.<br />
<br />
Cindy slowly looked down as she gasped from the sight. Her designer jeans which when put on were skin tight now showed her new angles and legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; cried Cindy seeing her thighs being broadened but narrow. Her leg was hunched into a half crouch as then her foot's heel stood high in the pantleg.<br />
<br />
Trembling fingers grabbed for the top button and with a hard tear she ripped them down her legs showing what was making the pants look different. Now a pair of shaggy brown haired legs of a goat were her's to walk upon. Looking perfectly like those of a goat the thighs and lower legs hunched offering her the new ability to run extra fast and jump with the movments like a goat.<br />
<br />
Cindy rubbed her fingers through the shaggy hairs and down the length of her legs to those high hocked hind feet. There the bone and muscle thinned as tendons held and gave strength to the feet. Cloven tan marbled hooves now repleced her toes and as she bent to touch them, up popped her foot long goaty tail.<br />
<br />
A mother's scream made Cindy stand up and with nimble piano playing fingers she took to feeling around and over her hairy rump.<br />
<br />
Saying No, no, no, over and over as she felt and discovered her misshapened legs and self. It was as she stood there touching and with Joan in tears Cindy started to cry too.<br />
<br />
&quot;My dear daughter, my foolish daughter, my, my, oh my God NO!&quot; said Joan as she stood hugging her deformed daughter.<br />
<br />
Whether fear, panic, terror, or what have you, Cindy was quite ensensed and with her changes to goat like form she began to react in her new goatish ways.<br />
<br />
It was Joan as she was pressing and hugging her daughter face to face that felt the realization of what could be only worse than becoming part goat. Cindy's new equipment began inching out of her sheath as the goat she tripped over was indeed a Billy.<br />
<br />
A bending down look at her daughter found as Joan expected that Cindy had lost her vagina and now sported two Kiwi fruit sized testicles hung in a long hanging furry sack. A well muscled furry sheath was part of her daughter's lower tummy and from it came this deeply shaded red penis, pointed, wrinkled, and getting ever more massive in girth and length.<br />
<br />
The removeal of cindy's blouse revealed to both mother and daughter just how much of Cindy was that of a Billy goat.<br />
<br />
Firm beastly hide and muscle went to just under her perky young breasts. The mixed brown, black, and off white shaggy hair came to just he first lower rib. A look from there down made one think she was some side show freak as it was all that of a male goat, to be sure.<br />
<br />
A wrought Mother put on the glasses and began to beg as then ask the spirit within to help her daughter regain her female human form.</p>
