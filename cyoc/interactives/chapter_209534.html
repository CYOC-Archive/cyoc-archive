<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Owen put his hands greedily on Troy’s back, “You know kid, I really can’t get you outta my head. Can’t focus on my work”<br />
<br />
Troy felt Owen’s meaty hands push into Troy’s hard back, his boss really seemed to love him. Troy couldn’t help but feel a little nervous. Owen’s presence over Troy gave him full control do whatever he wanted. Owen moved up and down Troy’s body slowly, feeling the coarse rough skin, his dick moved in and out rhythmically inside the Rhox’s hole. Troy could feel himself shake and stifled a moan, trying to keep as quiet as he could. Hot air wheezed from parted lips. <br />
<br />
Owen grinned as he made Troy his complete toy. <br />
<br />
He laughed, “Maybe I’ll call you Toy from now on instead of Troy.”<br />
<br />
Troy couldn’t think, his legs quaked with ecstasy, he was going to cum. Owen grunted as his thrusts grew deeper and more forceful. Troy couldn’t help it, he exploded all over the barrier they were hiding behind, sticky white painting the solid concrete. Owen wasn’t far behind, letting out his own moan as he sprayed his seed inside Troy. Troy felt the rush of cum leak out his hole as Owen slowed down. Owen caught he breath, leaning down onto Troy, kissing his back repeatedly.<br />
<br />
As Troy began to regain his focus, he looked around to make sure no one had seen them. He then saw a person over by their clothes, someone was fucking with their stuff! <br />
<br />
Troy called out, “Hey stop it! What do you think you’re doing?”<br />
<br />
“Let ‘em have his fun, pervert ain’t doing nothing. And I’m not done with you yet.” Owen pulled Troy back in for a tusky kiss, ignoring his struggles. <br />
<br />
Owen started pounding Troy’s ass again, holding him firm so that Troy couldn’t move. Troy struggled, fighting the returning pleasure from Owen’s cock. What if someone got his book! Who was touching their stuff? <br />
<br />
“It’s gonna be alright.” Owen nibbled on his ear, making Troy moan. “If we have to work nude, we work nude, okay?”<br />
<br />
Troy groaned and pushed back into the thick dick ramming his donut hole. He thought he heard someone say something behind him, but whatever it was got drowned out by Owen’s heavy breathing and grunts of pleasure. It didn’t matter, the only thing that mattered was the big, thick, tapered cock in his ass. Something about that last bit felt off, but the way it smoothly glided in and out of his rectum, setting off all his pleasure centers, making him want to howl in ecstasy, made him ignore it.<br />
<br />
Owens breaths became pants, and warm wetness collected on Troy’s shoulder. The day was hot and all this sex was making it hotter. The ogre was pressing against his back as he humped, and Troy swore his body hair was getting thicker by the second. It had been coarse and rough before, but now it felt dense and rather soft. The man behind him bucked his hips faster and faster, something big and round bumping against Troy’s stretched hole.<br />
<br />
His body felt so hot and tingly, a pleasant warmth suffusing his form. He saw Shiloh, the big grizzly bear, off in the distance, shaggy form carting an armload of concrete and asphalt to the dump truck. Owen let out a rumbly growl behind him and shifted, thrusts growing more and more persistent. Troy could only relax into it, enjoying the pleasant, rhythmic stretching, the scent of the construction workers on the wind, sweaty and horny, and the primal musk of Owen behind him, big and generous with his massive cock.<br />
<br />
He was just so relaxed and happy that he let his tongue unfurl from his mouth, gasps of hot air escaping his maw as it gently stretched forward. His saliva-flecked tongue lapped his cold, wet nose, then resumed its position far below his chin. Drool dripped from his forming chops and he slobbered onto the concrete barrier. Behind him, he heard another growl and rough padded paws gripped him around the waist. It took Troy a few seconds in his tingly, cottony mind, to realize something about that was wrong. <br />
<br />
Then Owen thrust into him hard, and the big round object stretched him wide and popped into him. Troy yelped, eyes bulging from the pain and pleasure, feeling nice and full. He looked behind him to see what Owen had done and his brain froze. <br />
<br />
Owen’s head was misshapen, face pushed out into a wide, blunt snout, tusks now just two big pointed teeth that protruded from his bottom lips. He looked to be a pitbull/bulldog mix, face all furry, eyes a liquid golden-brown color, staring dully into the distance, caught up in the feeling of knotting his mate. As Troy watched in horror, the dome of Owen’s skull pulsated, then collapsed, ear’s cropping themselves as his face fully streamlined into a pitbull’s head. The rest of his body remained muscular, like his owner had fed him steroids.<br />
<br />
As Troy thought of an ‘owner’, a thick, spiked leather collar appeared around Owen’s neck with his name on the tag.<br />
<br />
Owen rumbled and growled, and Troy felt warmth flood his insides as the big dog came inside him. The dog kept humping, and Troy realized he still retained Ogre Owen’s irrepressible lust. Someone must have used it on them, he belatedly realized, mind still foggy and tingly. Troy realized he needed to get away from the dog, get to his clothes, find the Book. But as he tried to pull away, he found himself caught on something in his ass.<br />
<br />
A knot! Troy realized, Owen’s knotted me! It takes, like…a while before he can pull away without hurting himself. He had to do something, get Owen to pull out himself. Hopefully he was still in there, could listen to reason.<br />
<br />
“Plwease Staap!” Troy pleaded, voice warbly, tongue getting in the way of his words. “I don’ waaana bee a dawg!”<br />
<br />
Owen grumbled and kept rolling his hips, and Troy whined with pleasure at the feeling of the hard knot rubbing against his prostate. A growing part of him wanted to give in and let his Alpha fuck him like the bitch he was, but what remained of his human self in his tingly brain resisted. He saw Shiloh again and started screaming, those his screams soon turned into howls and barks.<br />
<br />
Troy could see his hands scrabble on the concrete, fur overtaking them as his fingers shortened and blunted and they became useless paws. He could feels his face widen, jaw continuing to extend, a moist black nose wriggling at the end of it, smelling the wonderful musk of his Alpha. Troy shook his head, trying to clear the increasingly doggy thoughts from his mind. A jangle on his neck made him look down.<br />
<br />
A leather collar had wrapped itself around his neck, his name printed on the tag. Troy knew it was his name, but the words below it, while in English, were like gibberish to him. Below the tag, he could see his nipples slide down to his belly, four more vestigial nipples appearing on his stomach before white fur covered them over. His massive, dripping red rocket throbbed outside a canine sheathe between his hind legs. He felt his spine pop and a long, slender tail descended from between his cheeks. It lifted and raised out of the way for his lover automatically.<br />
<br />
“What’s all this racket?” Shiloh said, stomping around the barricades.<br />
<br />
He was saved!<br />
<br />
Troy barked, and the big bear sauntered over, inspecting the two heavily-muscled junkyard dogs. His skull began to throb, the pleasant tingles in his brain increasing in tandem with the thrusts behind him. It felt so good, Troy wanted nothing more but to give in to the tingles, let himself be washed away. He could see his skull pulsating like Owen’s had in his shadow. He only needed to hold on a little longer, then his big, horny-smelling owner could save him.<br />
<br />
“Aw, you two boys sweet on each other?” Shiloh asked, the big bear squatting down and eyeing the couple. <br />
<br />
The bear began patting Troy on his head. <br />
<br />
He struggled to stay focused, but the tingles grew as the bear’s heavy paw began to collapse his skull. There was-he needed to-but all he could focus on was how wonderful everything was as his brain shrunk and his skull began to streamline into a pitbull’s proper shape. Troy tried one last time to ask for help, but all that came out was a warbled yelp as his ears rose up the sides of his head and the cartilage crimped into a triangular into shape.<br />
<br />
Shiloh nodded and reached beneath Troy. The dog wondered why, until the big, furry paw wrapped around the back of his knot and squeezed, his other paw resting heavily on his head, unwittingly pressing down. His brain gently compacted, thoughts of being saved squashed into nothingness as he bucked his hips into the bear&#39;s meaty paw.<br />
<br />
The tingles exploded into pure ecstasy as he finally came, wiping all thoughts from his mind. His cock jerked over and over again and the dog howled happily, his jism splattering in white ropes all across the hot asphalt below. He panted mindlessly as the pleasure cleared, staring sightlessly into the distance. Shiloh patted his head again and Troy nuzzled into the big paw and licked it happily.<br />
<br />
“There you go boy. I hate being blue-balled too.” The bear played with his ears and went back to work.<br />
<br />
Troy, now a rather handsome white-furred pitbull, continued to pant, completely content, as the big dog behind him claimed him as his mate a fifth time.</p>
