<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thugs Antonio and Kevin now looked on at Miguel who now had a rinky dink white pale freckled body, a bad case of acne, and red stringy greasy hair dyed with green like a punk, and a cock only 5&quot; long when hard. Also, about the same age as a freshman in high school.<br />
<br />
First things first, Kevin decided he wanted to put him out of his human misery, yet show a little mercy by turning him into a used jock strap, and place him into a gym locker at the high school down the road, but always in the state of orgasm when worn, by a stupid lame ass bi sexual jock dude, who was on the raslin' team, and played with the other jock dorks who Kevin and Antonio used to beat the shit out of just for laughs when they came into his neighborhood! dumb ass motor heads that were not going to amount to nothing more then pot bellied bi sexual managers of Jack in the Box hamburger joints, or Walmarts in the middle of Nowheretown, USA, sorting through womens bras.<br />
<br />
However, Antonio... kind of felt sorry and wanted to give the kid another chance. So he read Miguel's mind, and saw that Miguel always had homosexual feelings for, and wanted to be another hot 13 year old punk very cool sk8ing dude.<br />
<br />
An argument ensued between whom should decide. Antonio or Kevin. Kevin said that they were both now identical twin gay Latino thug lovers, but without Kevin, Antonio would have just been another stupid jock head, drinking cheap ass keystone beer with his white hommies, and talking about belonging to the Phi Beta Kappa frat when they go to college, before all this transformation shit started about 3 weeks before. <br />
<br />
Kevin ultimately was the most powerful evil black magically enchanted  dude in the town, and Antonio was his minion!! Antonio stormed off to the tattoo parlor, but he was so pissed off, before he got there he pulled out his 44 Magnum, and capped off some ugly ass black street ho  named Shawana.  <br />
<br />
Anyhow, Kevin was a little upset, but figured he would repair their relationship later. So as Miguel stood there horrified and frozen, Kevin told him all would be better in his new life, and the pain would now be over.. Miguel could barely speak but said...wha wha wha u gonna do to me? Kevin laughed, waved his hand, and Miguel disappeared, but the boys high school locker room down the street had one more addition, a ripe, stinky, sweaty, cum soaked jock strap in the equipment room! <br />
<br />
But all this time two 15 year old skating dudes named Chris and Sean were hiding behind a dumpster, they too had magical powers, because they overheard Kevin's secret spells, and together they might be able to pull something off. So they laughed and thought it was all very kewl. They knew Kevin's younger white cousin Billy, who was their friend and a hot ass skater as well. But they decided to have a little fun with Kevin none-the-less, and asked to buy some dope from him. Kevin always liked his bad boy juvenile delinquent white counterpart skating home boys, so he invited Chris and Sean back to his house. once there, the fun began!!<br />
<br />
Kevin was totally high when they arrived and he invited them in to join him. The Chris and Sean twins now began to hatch the plan they had formulated over the past hour. Chris began kissing Kevin as he massaged his shoulders while Sean pulled down Kevin's pants and began giving him the best blow job he had ever had. As Kevin was reaching a climax, Chris cooed in his ear, &quot;Kevin, tell me some more secrets of transformation. You won't regret it.&quot; Kevin, half crazed with dope and sex, found himself saying without a moment's hesitation, &quot;I can do better than that. From now on you both have my powers. Let's go find some more homies&quot;.<br />
<br />
Chris and Sean both felt a wave of excitement as they received the ability to transform anyone magically. Before Kevin could react, Chris said, &quot;Kevin, you no longer remember how to transform anybody. In fact, you can't recall ever having that power.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean chimed in, &quot;Kevin, your IQ is now slightly below normal, and all you care about is pleasing Sean and me&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin grunted in response, &quot;What can I do to please you hotties?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris answered, &quot;Don't you worry about that. We'll take care of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris thought for a moment and Kevin began regressing, ending up at the age of 13, two years younger than the twins. His clothing disappeared as he shrunk to a couple of inches shorter than his new masters.<br />
<br />
Sean now began modifying Kevin's smaller, younger body, adding large, but proportionally attractive muscles to his entire body. Next came ink, as tattoos of intricate geometric designs circled his upper arms, lower back and the rear of his neck.<br />
<br />
Large gold rings pierced Kevin's earlobes, nose, tongue, nipples, navel and cockhead. A wide gold band circled his balls and dick, and a pair of gold slave bracelets appeared just below his arm tats.<br />
<br />
Kevin's hair turned platinum blond, complimenting his dark tanned skin. The hair lengthened and thickened, pulled back into a ponytail that reached halfway down his back.<br />
<br />
Sean and Chris decided to give some thought to Kevin's clothes, eventuallly deciding on just a dark gray wife beater, with some rad A&amp;F cargo shorts with chain and wallet would be enough..<br />
<br />
The changes finished. It was time to enjoy their handiwork. &quot;Kevin, your name is now &quot;Boy&quot;. Come service your new masters.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kevin no longer a hard core street thug, but now transformed into a 13 year old extremely hot gay punk skater, no longer remembers himself having former evil powers, nor what happened. He just always thought he was who he was. But one thing is for sure, he loves being who he is now, and being used as a bottom slave by 15 year old sk8rs' Chris and Sean! And then after marathon sessions of getting fucked, sucking, cbt, tt, and forced to do anything... Chris, Sean and the new sk8er addition Kevin go out and skate, play, and be juvenile delinquents.<br />
<br />
A few days after the transformation, after a marathon sex session one afternoon. Chris and Sean were sleeping, but Kevin was in the rec room, playing video games on the bad ass 50&quot; inch Sony plasma tv, and drawing up patterns for some rad tats he wanted Chris and Sean to ink him with. There was a knock at the door. Kevin got up and answered it. There was a 6'1, Latino 18th street gang bangin thug named Carlos standing there wondering what the fuck is up! Kevin said hey dude. whatup? who r u? Carlos identified himself, and asked the 13 year old punk skater kid who he was, and who else was there. Carlos then asked 13 year old sk8er Kevin, where his 19 year old hommie half latin/half white bro also named Kevin was? Kevin said he don't know. Carlos stepped in, pulled his silver plated 38 out, and took a look around.<br />
<br />
He looked into the bedroom and saw two other 15 year old sk8ers laying in gangsta Kevin's bed naked! Carlos was very smart and also knew that thug Kevin his home boy, was into hard core black magic, loved dope, and was also gay, but this was hella freaky. Carlos is bi, and after both him and his missing thug hommie Kevin served time up at Ely super max, they both discovered that every male is sexually attracted to every other male. So he thought, well maybe Kevin decided to have some sexual fun with the sk8er boys, after all he knew Kevin was half white as well as half Mexican, and was a little into this scene when he was younger, before he discovered his Latino side, so it was kewl and all good. But he had been missing for 3 days, and why would he leave his crib, letting these sk8ers alone in it? Ahhhh it suddenly dawned on him, that Kevin smoked too much dope and while having sex with the 2 older sk8ers, gave some secrets away. And the two 15 year old sk8ers turned gangsta thug Kevin into the 13 year old sker in the rec room.<br />
<br />
Well this was no good, because street thug Kevin was a high powered asset to the gangs financial strength, as well as magical influence, and he needed him back. But Carlos was out powered here cause if Kevin gave his powers to Sean and Chris, then just his powers were not enough! He needed to get lil sk8er dude Kevin to remember his former life and powers, so they could get things back into order, and fast, before Chris and Sean woke up. But how was he going to do this?<br />
<br />
He went back into the rec room and spoke with lil Kev. Under intense telepathic interrogation, he realized that Sean and Chris took away all of his human memory...AH HA, but his core spiritual essence, his very soul could not be tampered with! So Carlos hypnotized lil' Kevin, and found out the whole truth! He also was able to get the reversal spell out of him as well. Carlos went to work!<br />
<br />
Carlos and lil' SK8er Kev went to big thug Kevin's secret room, where they practiced black magic and gathered up the necessary things necessary for the reversal, specifically, a white candle, and a demoniacally cursed mirror. He then told lil' Kev to repeat the following incantation. Kevin sat in front of the mirror, Carlos turned off the lights, and lit the candle. He set the candle next to the mirror so the light from it hit Kevin's face, but so he would not see the candle in the mirror.<br />
<br />
He told lil' skater Kev to look into his eyes in the mirror and say:<br />
<br />
Oracle of lunar light,<br />
Send me the second sight.<br />
<br />
He stared into his reflection and did not blink.<br />
His reflection dissolved and another appeared!<br />
lil Kev looked at the face, body,clothing, and surroundings.<br />
After this Kevin had emotions he could not explain.<br />
Carlos said, don't worry they will go away in a few minutes.<br />
<br />
lil' sk8er Kev was now staring into his former life before his transformation, mischievously performed by Chris and Sean!<br />
<br />
Carlos then Called to Satan and said, My Lord, Make this mirror give this boy what is owed!<br />
<br />
With that lil' skater Kevin, was once again 19 year old hard core 18th street Latino gangsta Kevin Marquez! Standing 6', weighing 175 pounds, very close buzz faded brown hair, shaved on sides, deep brown eyes, deep tan that only a half white/half Latino dude could have. 8&quot; fat uncut cock, fully inked on his legs, arms, stomach, chest, back and neck, and one above his eyebrow.. All gang association markings, prison gang tats and an array of different shit! hard 6 pac abs, hard muscled body, with an eyebrow, tongue, tit, and cock piercing. Wow Carlos thought. Thats my fuckin homeboy that we all fuckin talk about!!<br />
<br />
The now re transformed Kevin asked his friend Carlos what the fuck happened! Carlos explained all as they made there way to Kev's bedroom, where the two naked 15 year old skers Chris and Sean lay in Kevin's bed sleeping! The nerve Kevin thought. Now both sker dudes Chris and Sean were out manned and out powered, in high powered black magic and transformation capabilities possessed by Carlos and Kevin!<br />
<br />
Without hesitation, Carlos and Kevin did a spell and snatched Sean and Chris's temporary powers away from them, that they stole from Kevin in the first place. The boys then woke up. And were now frozen with fear and panic on their faces as Carlos and Kevin looked on with sinister grins, and laughed together about what they were going to do next.</p>
