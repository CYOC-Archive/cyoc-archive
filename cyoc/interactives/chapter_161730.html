<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ann stretched a small grin on her face as she got up. Becoming 15 for the evening and sleeping over at Jackie&#39;s house left the grown down woman feeling a bit more energetic than usual. Making her way to the bathroom the goth teen examined herself before chuckling softly. &quot;Too bad  it a bit more adult me and Jackie could of had some fun this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Making her way downstairs Ann smiled as Jackie and her parents ate breakfast. &quot;Morning Ann,&quot; Hannah smiled. &quot;You get a good night sleep?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Slept great Mrs. Fisher,&quot; Ann said happily. Taking a seat she gave her girlfriend a small grin, sliding her an envelope. &quot;Happy birthday Jackie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackie blushed, thanking Ann, as she opened the envelope. &quot;What is this,&quot; Jackie asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;A disco ball,&quot; Ann smirked. &quot;You hang it on the mirror in your car. Figure you&#39;ll need it after you get your license today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a dork,&quot; Jackie laughed. &quot;But thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann and Jackie now began to chat as Jackie parents began cleaning up. Jackie would be taking her driving test early. If she passed, (and considering she had plenty of practice that seemed like a certainty), the teens planned to cruise around town in celebration. Jackie peaked back quickly, seeing her parents were out of earshot. &quot;Seriously a mirror decoration,&quot; Jackie whispered, stifling a laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;WellI could of bought you a car,&quot; Ann whispered. &quot;But how would I explain a new car to your parents? Teenagers dont exactly have enough money to buy their girlfriends a car.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh true,&quot; Jackie sighed. &quot;That would be hard to explain. I&#39;ll just keep that in mind for later though Angel.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann smiled, shaking her head as she gazed at her girlfriend. &quot;We really have the weirdest relationship darling.&quot;<br />
<br />
Showering and dressing the Ann went with Jackie to the DMV for her driving test, which she passed with flying colors. Excitedly the two teens piled into Jackie&#39;s parents car as the newly licensed teen drove them home. Pulling into the driveway the teens raced inside, not noticing the car in front of Jackie&#39;s house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom I did it I passed,&quot; Jackie exclaimed before screeching to a halt and staring at the two adults sitting in the living room, two adults she recognized as adult versions of Adam and Felicia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations Jackie,&quot; Felicia smirked. &quot;We were just stopping by to pick up Ann.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann was speechless, gaping at the two grown up teens. Teens who had pretended to be her parents not to long ago. &quot;Um hey mom and dad,&quot; Ann stammered. &quot;I, um, wasnt expecting to see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well pumpkin,&quot; Adam smirked, stifling a laugh. &quot;Hearing that your girlfriend was taking her drivers test we thought it be nice to take you two out to celebrate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like a wonderful idea,&quot; Hannah exclaimed. &quot;You dont mind taking the kids out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all,&quot; Felicia smiled. &quot;It would be our pleasure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gathering up her things Ann made her way out to the car with Jackie. As the teens piled in and pulled away she finally took the opportunity to ask what had brought her friends to her home. &quot;Okay what are you two up to?&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam stopped the car, an impish grin on his face. Looking at Felicia he nodded, his girlfriend now reversing the spell that had turned the two into adults. Ann and Jackie watched as the two adults began growing younger, returningto their proper ages. Adam now raised an eyebrow as he looked at Ann and Jackie &quot;What,&quot; he smirked. &quot;Figured it would be an opportunity to party. You weren&#39;t the only one that got their license today.&quot; Adam now tossed his own license to Jackie. &quot;By the way you two better not have been up to any funny business last night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god,&quot; Ann groaned, blushing fiercely. &quot;You cant be serious?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gotta make sure my little girl is still innocent,&quot; Adam laughed. Ann buried her face in her hands as Jackie reached over smacking Adam in the back of the head.<br />
<br />
*************<br />
<br />
Abolith narrowed her gaze as she gazed at the car. She along with Malak had been tasked with attacking the teens. They were to be frightened, possibly injured, but not killed. For the assassin it was a task she wasn&#39;t thrilled with. &quot;There they are,&quot; she whispered, gazing up at the massive creature by her side. &quot;Remember the plan Malak. Do not take their lives.&quot;<br />
<br />
The massive creature nodded, flexing his incredible muscles as he growled. &quot;Why does Lord Villar not want then dead,&quot; he grunted, his voice deep and foreboding. &quot;This was Casseus plan,&quot; Abolith sighed. &quot;Gauge the strength of the wizards of this timeline while the other timeline is distracted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We should just destroy them,&quot; Malak grumbled. Abolith nodded in agreement, she would rather eliminate the wizards but Villar said he needed them alive for now. Turning to her companion she narrowed her gaze. &quot;I trust you can handle this yourself,&quot; she said. Malak nodded, moving forward as the spell concealing him began to dissipate.<br />
<br />
Jackie and the others were so absorbed in their conversation they failed to notice the monstrous Malak making his way towards the car. The group talked of going on group dates, letting Ann or Adam drive the group around town. For the teens this milestone of growing up opened numerous opportunities. All this came to a sudden end as Malak brought a massive fist crashing into the hood of the car.<br />
<br />
The teens screamed as they gazed at the monstrous blue skinned creature. Malak growled at the teens, his muscles tensing as he punched through the hood of the car. &quot;The fuck is that thing,&quot; Adam yelled.<br />
<br />
Jackie and Felicia had no answers as they continued to scream. Malak brought his massive fists down once more, taking hold of the car.<br />
<br />
The teens tried to brace themselves as they felt the car begin to tip. Thinking quickly Felicia tightened her hand around her pendant as she conjured a portal, allowing the teens to escape the car as it flipped over. Appearing in the street the four now gaped at the creature. &quot;Anyone have any ideas,&quot; Jackie exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Abolith had watched Malak, a wicked smile upon her face. As she watched the teens teleport out of the car her eyes went wide. &quot;That girl,&quot; she whispered, staring at Ann. &quot;She survived!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackie and Felicia now slowly began to backtrack, trying to focus on any spell that could possibly help them. Suddenly they saw a woman cloaked in dark blue appear next to the creature. Although they could t see through the veil she wore, they could see her eyes. &quot;Malak stop now,&quot; she stated.<br />
<br />
Malak turned, giving his companion an odd look. &quot;What is the meaning of this Abolith,&quot; he growled.<br />
<br />
&quot;The girl,&quot; Abolith stated, pointing at a teenage Ann. &quot;If that girl is here her mother and sister will not be far. Our job is done, we must report to Villar.&quot; Malak gazed intently at Ann, snarling before and vanishing from sight.<br />
<br />
As the pair vanished the group now curiously gazed at Ann before looking at the wreckage of Adam&#39;s car. Whatever was going on they were going to need answers.</p>
