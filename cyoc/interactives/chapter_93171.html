<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking at her putting on makeup using the mirror, Ty got an idea. You see, he recognized the mirror she was holding, Ty&#39;s friend had bought it for her as a present, right before he got rejected. The story was similar for many in the school, Jennifer would lure them in, act like a nice compassionate person, get something out of it, then dump them on the curb. Rumor had it that she only did it because her family was poor and couldn&#39;t afford much, but Ty couldn&#39;t care less, she had hurt his friend, used him to get what she wanted, like a tool, so he was going to use her too, just... In a different way. He was going to turn her into the ultimate multi-tool.<br />
<br />
He wished that, while still remaining conscious and with all her senses, her body would be able to transform in such a way that it could accomplish what her &quot;owner&quot; needed it to. He owner would of course, be Ty, but it could be transferred, much like how ownership of something can legally transfer. Everyone, except of course him and Jennifer, would see her as her own person, but at the same time, still see her as a tool, owned by someone, and thus no one would object. Lastly Ty wished that the mind of her owner would specify how she is transformed, so if he wanted her to have a mouth, she would, if he was feeling mean, she wouldn&#39;t, and he wished that she couldn&#39;t get permanently injured, no matter what (pain was another matter.)<br />
<br />
Ty leaned back, pleased with himself, then wished himself visible, but not to the school cameras. Walking up behind Jennifer, he said, &quot;Hey Jen!&quot; Whirling around, she yelled &quot;What are you doing in here you pervert!&quot; Smiling, Ty replied &quot;Oh, I just needed a pencil,&quot; before allowing the power to activate. Jennifer instantly stumbled backwards, losing her balance and falling. Her look of anger changed to fear as she realized Ty was getting bigger, or rather, she was getting smaller. She tried to push herself up, only to find that her legs were much shorter than before, and still shrinking. Scrambling away from Ty, now half her normal size, she pulled herself across the floor with her arms and stumps of legs, leaving behind her pants and panties, leaving Ty with a good view as her butt flattened into nothingness, leaving her lower body perfectly circular save for her legs. And those weren&#39;t going to last much longer either as they moved slowly upwards towards her body. Meanwhile, Jennifer&#39;s arms were beginning to shorten at a much faster rate. With her shirt on, Ty couldn&#39;t tell exactly when her arms were gone, but rather quickly she lost all concept of mobility. As her body shrunk more, her head moved inside her shirt, blocking her sight and causing her to squirm wildly. Ty watched as her squirming slowly decreased in strength until it stopped. Pulling her shirt off, he watched as she continued to shrink, her upper body perfectly cylindrical, save for small bulges that her breasts had become. On the bottom of her lower half, her body tapered off into her vagina. At slightly larger than the size of a pencil, there was a pop as her neck became segmented, her hair quickly taking on a rubbery texture. In just under 30 seconds, Jennifer had gone from girl, to pencil.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, a mechanical pencil,&quot; Ty muttered as he reached down to pick up Jennifer. Holding her to his face, he saw that she was sobbing and almost felt bad for a second, then he remembered who she was. &quot;Wha.. *Sniff* What did you do to me?&quot; Jennifer&#39;s tearful face asked. &quot;I needed a pencil.&quot; Ty responds, holding a straight face for a couple of seconds before grinning, &quot;And, you&#39;ve always been a jerk to me, figured I&#39;d return the favor.&quot; With that he reached his thumb out and stroked her breasts, making the small lumps wiggle. &quot;Hey, wha.. Stop that!&quot; Jennifer squeaked. &quot;Stop me.&quot; Ty grinned, following by poking her pussy and laughing at her expression. Setting her down for a second to a muffled &quot;Ouch!&quot;, he reached into his backpack and retrieved his math homework. Picking Jennifer up again, he pressed down on her head and laughed at her yelp as lead poked out of her. Starting his problems, he watched her face as it slowly changed from a pained, tearful expression, to one of ecstasy at the feeling of the lead pushing against her, all while she sobbed. Finishing his homework, Jennifer&#39;s hair looked slightly worse for wear. &quot;Enjoyed that?&quot; Ty laughed. &quot;Please...&quot; Jennifer whimpered as tears streamed down her flushed face, &quot;Please don&#39;t do that again...&quot; Massaging her body with his thumb, Ty asked, &quot;Why not, you sure enjoyed it.&quot; For a few seconds, he heard no reply, then she said, &quot;Would you enjoy someone raping you?&quot; Ty opened his mouth, then closed it again, the laughter sucked out of him. &quot;Fine then,&quot; he said, and her arms and legs grew again, her body reforming into human shape, but without growing. Jennifer looked up at him with somewhat grateful eyes and Ty looked at her thoughtfully until she looked away as he continued to massage her entire body. Shrugging, Ty suddenly shoved her in his pocket, producing a yell, and got up. He had to start walking home, otherwise he wouldn&#39;t get home in time to do his chores, and he did not want to get in trouble with hist &quot;parents&quot;.<br />
<br />
Exiting the school, Ty began to walk home and smiled as he felt the small person struggling in his pocket, then he stopped, stuck with another idea. He grabbed Jennifer from his pocket and tossed her onto the road. Screaming in pain, she lay there until it faded, which was fairly quickly as no damage was done, then tried to get up, only to find that she was stuck on hands and knees. Her fists curled and legs began to shorten, stopping at her knees. Her hands and feet began to turn to rubber as her body grew. Her arms and legs shortened until they were attached to the sides of her body. Her butt flattened into a square shape while a pip replaced the other orifice. Her mouth sealed shut and moved downwards as her jaw flattened and her neck disappeared, merging her head and body in the process. Her eyes, too, moved upwards to her forehead before spreading and merging, while her forehead slanted backwards. Her nose widened to encompass the width of her face as everything below it moved forwards, stretching her nose several times farther forward. Lastly came the texture. Her eyes went transparent, eyebrows growing into windshield wipers, her sides getting the outlines of doors, along with windows. Her trunk getting a window, and a seam to open it with. And finally, the body of the car gained a nice metal finish.<br />
<br />
&quot;That turned out well,&quot; Ty said as he opened the door, picking Jennifer&#39;s former hair up as it morphed into keys. Turning on the car and heading home, Ty turned on the radio. Rather than music, Jennifer&#39;s voice came over the speakers, &quot;Well I guess this is better....&quot;</p>
