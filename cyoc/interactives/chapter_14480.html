<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sudden knowledge of being and feeling the new and strange sensations of being a Ram and male were almost too much. As when she was female and human the passionate desire to be touched and made to feel her womanly heritage had made her shiver with delights.<br />
<br />
Now a different feeling came over her as if it was her calling to make all females subserviant to her sexual will. Eric, as she began to refer to herself now was rubbing his low hanging balls with one hand making the lusty feelings rise to unknown heights.<br />
<br />
It was within her first hour of knowingly being a Ram Humanoid as a male that Eric began to experience cramps. Thighs were first to be a real pain as twisting and leg gripping cramps festered again and again.<br />
<br />
Rubbing his thighs and then the calves of his legs as the cramps spread even further.<br />
<br />
Soon he could only bleatingly make sounds to show his agony as the pains seemed to work into the btoom of his feet. It was maybe when the toes began to crimp and spread apart with muscles cramping that Eric got the idea of what was occuring.<br />
<br />
His lost female gender and human status was even then making new roads for him to follow. The toes crimped over rolling down and then spread apart in two groups. The big toe and the next to it went in one direction as the other three toes bunched up moving away too. <br />
<br />
Fingers on wool covered hands could not move up and down both legs fast enough to quell the severe pains Eric was then feeling. As his fingers looped through the thick wool covering his thighs, lower leg, and thinning as it had spread to sprout out his feet, he noticed his finger nails looked strange.<br />
<br />
Wham, a wild pain racked up the back of both legs and running up the buttocks into Eric's spine.<br />
<br />
As the pain struck Eric stretched his body full length his legs stiff with cramps. The buttocks too now cramped tight as his short tail wiggled franticly. A pain like nothing he or she had ever felt charged up from the legs, buttocks, and then into the spine. The pain moved in odd waves as if moving upward along the spine seemingly touching each bone of the spine and making it feel or vibrate in some fashion.<br />
<br />
Eyes wide and arms too strained out straight as the pain worked its way up and the out along his other appendages. It was as the violent paind racked into the bones of his hands that his wide and scared eyes watched a radical change begen to his hands.<br />
<br />
Whencing as he whined of the pain Eric could do nothing but watch his finger nails turn jet black in color. As if adding injury to the horrid insult of these wild pains his finger nails began to grow covering the total end of each finger. <br />
<br />
Then the pain was gone, the cramps subsided and were then too gone. Eric lay there for a moment feeling relief of his pains till one by one the bones of his neck, spine, and pelvis popped.<br />
<br />
Not a pain but generally a real discomfort form the sensation of each bone popping in that strange sort of way.<br />
<br />
Rolling over to his side Eric was about to try but slowly try to get and stand up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bleat, bleat, bleat!&quot; cried Eric as for the first time but not the last he saw his legs and feet.<br />
<br />
Changed they were, as if the perfume scent had made them worthy of a Ram now each leg and foot looked like it should belong to a Ram. Whencing with mental pains over the change and loss of her/his humanity those now hooflet fingers reached out and touched cloven hooves where toes used to be.<br />
<br />
Nearby lay one of Erika's sister books the pages open to a story of one girl and her life living on a sheep ranch near a town called Wisful Vista. It was a story which was the sister's favorite. Eric remembered the story quite well as it was about two sheep and going together their ultimate love brought forth more sheep for the farm. He thought back at how on occasion when reading the story she'd change it and make the thing read with a bit more sensuality. The young sister would get angry and make wishes for Ericka that she should some day be a sheep and know what it felt like!<br />
<br />
&quot;Odd!&quot; thought Eric as he sat there seeing his changed legs and feet being touched by hands sporting little black hooflets. The memories of Sis and the story had merged and with this perfume made or melted Ericka into Eric the ram.<br />
<br />
Now being a Ram in head, wooly hide, having the backbone and pelvic shapes of a quadrapet animal, and with complete groin, hind legs, feet, and cloven hooves Eric looked and felt extremely sensual.<br />
<br />
Standing was a real and new experience. His hooves flexed feeling the weight barring down on them. A few short steps proved his stance needed now to be placed in a all fours manner. He leaned forward placing the hands and hooflets on a window sill. The hind legs stretched backwards to the feet and bent down hooves holding part of his male Ram's weight.<br />
<br />
Taking deep breaths through fuzzy nostrils as new teeth ground upon themselves in response to a building and growing desire.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes, she'll do!&quot; thought Eric the mostly Ram.<br />
<br />
Coming his way was Mable Ann Snider, a good friend and always having a horny mind.<br />
<br />
The knock at the back door was just a passing courtesy as Mable Ann would just walk inside the house. Her dropping of school books on the kitchen table and then opening the frige she took whatever she wanted. Her normal way of doing things could be from day to day whenever she came as the same, same, and same.<br />
<br />
A hollar up the stairway to where Ericka's bedroom was had her bounding two steps at a time to come and greet her friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey what's up, up here?&quot; yelled Mable Ann as she looked about a room scattered with clothing. Some of the items like blouse and panties were torn badly. She picked one by one up and wondered what had happened up there. <br />
<br />
SLAm, went the bedroom door as from behind the door came this creature out of some XXXX rated movie. Like part man and part Ram in form the creature stood eyeing his prey.<br />
<br />
Mable, mouth open and looking at first the curving Ram's horns, larger hairy ears, nostrils breathing in and out in heavy sensual manners. The muscles bulging everywhere as wool covered the creature from head to hoofs. <br />
<br />
As the creature began to become erect and his pink maleness came out of the white wool curled and covered sheath attached to Eric's stomach. Searching eyes looked down seeing her wildest of wierd and perverted desires moving ever out into the light of day. <br />
<br />
The creature's arms came up as if to hold and caress his lover. <br />
<br />
Mable stepped backward as her heel bumped the spilled perfume bottle still on the floor.<br />
<br />
Standing there striking a sensual pose Eric let Mable get used to what she saw and the idea he knew she had. <br />
<br />
Reaching down Mable picked up the perfume bottle taking a short sniff of the fragerance. She shuddered and her fears vaporized, moving a step forward she let the Ram like creature fold his arms about her waist.</p>
