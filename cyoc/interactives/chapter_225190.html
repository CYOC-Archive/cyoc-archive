<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stepping through the portal, Darren once more found himself gazing upon the kitsune domain. A small smile cracking across his youthful face as he watched kitsune go about their daily lives. This was familiar for the Catalyst, a small comfort in the chaos that had been his life. This however didn&#39;t mean that he was unwilling to adapt as he turned to an unlikely ally. &quot;So what do you think Stella?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stella stared wide eyed as she beheld the beauty of the kitsunes homeland. She had never seen the kitsune homeland before, now taking in the beauty of her surroundings. Cherry blossoms dotted the streets, beautiful yet quaint buildings lining a cobblestone street, all around the ebony haired teenager could see kitsune of various ages going about their daily lives. &quot;Its beautiful,&quot; she gasped, watching as a four tailed vixen pushed a stroller across the street. Darren could only smile, beckoning his friend forward as they advanced on the palace.<br />
<br />
It had surprised him when Stella said she wished to come. Slowly though he began to understand. Before everything happened, Stella befriended Abolith. The teenage councilor had taken the time to get to know Abolith, so much so that she began to consider the elf assassin a friend. Perhaps even her best friend. As odd as it seemed, Stella greatly missed seeing Abolith. When she discovered that Darren would be visiting both Fukushu and Abolith, she immediately asked if she could come. Darren now hoped that the reunion would be everything Stella hoped it would be.<br />
<br />
Gazing out the window of his private room, Fukushu furrowed his brow as he took in his surroundings. After the confrontation with his father, Fukushu learned exactly of what had been transpiring within the two timelines. Wizards from the future, a fanatical group trying to change the future, whether Fukushu wanted to or not he would be needed in the fight to come. This didn&#39;t mean that his presence would be welcomed.<br />
<br />
It was to be expected honestly. After siding with Villar and nearly killing his mother he knew arriving in the kitsune homeland would be controversial. In the best of times he was feared, now he was hated. The nine tails family was smuggled inside the palace with only his family knowing he was here. This led to his siblings wanting revenge for the attack on his mother, Tatsu acting as the sole deterrent. For the moment it succeeded, especially after learning of an heir to the kitsune kingdom. Still, both Fukushu and Abolith found themselves on edge, neither sleeping well as they planned for the worse. A knock on his barred door now drawing the kitsunes attention. Withdrawing his weapon he now motioned for Abolith to hide with Raiden, the frazzled elf nodding as she hid with her infant son. &quot;Who goes there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tatsu,&quot; the voice replied. &quot;May we speak?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu slowly approached the door, his katana at the ready as he inched the door open. Peaking through the slit, he could see the golden nine tail stoically gazing at his son. &quot;What do you want father?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To speak,&quot; Tatsu replied. &quot;There are two humans that wish to speak with you.&quot; Fukushu scowled, his hatred of humans had led him to this point already. The only ones who would even know of his existence were the wizards. Whoever it was could only be an enemy. Before he could speak, Tatsu now beckoned to a pair of young teenagers anxiously waiting several feet behind Tatsu. &quot;Who are these humans?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Friends apparently,&quot; Tatsu stated. &quot;From a future they are trying to preserve. The girl is Stella, she is a friend of Aboliths. The boys name is Darren, he is the Catalyst and also a student of yours.&quot; Fukushu raised an eyebrow. The Catalyst?! He was familiar with the term, believing that the woman Katie Carlson was the only one. This boy though was apparently her successor and amazingly trained by him. &quot;That makes no sense,&quot; Fukushu growled. &quot;I would never train a human!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fukushu wait,&quot; Darren said quickly. Fukushu paused, his steely gaze causing Darren to shudder. &quot;I know about your hatred of humans. I know about your history with wizard. I know about what&#39;s happened to you in the past.&quot; Fukushu said nothing, Darren now slowly unsheathing the Dragons Tongue to present to the kitsune. The teen noticing that while Fukushu remained expressionless, his vulpine ears twitched as he gazed at the sacred blade of his people. &quot;Where did you get that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tatsu gave it to me,&quot; Darren answered. &quot;When he....passed. I held him in my arms after we repelled the Normal from destroying the kitsune. You taught me about its secrets, how I can converse with the spirits of the previous wielders. That includes your master Akane.&quot;<br />
<br />
Although Fukushu was silent, Darren could see he had elicited a response. The kitsunes eyes narrowed, his lip twitching at the mention of his deceased master. &quot;Let us say you are telling the truth,&quot; he began. &quot;Why would I train you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because we both realized the Normal want nothing more than to destroy all of us,&quot; Darren replied. &quot;And that includes Raiden. We both know that regardless of how you feel about humans, a world with the Normal in charge will do nothing but put him in danger.&quot;<br />
<br />
For a moment Fukushu said nothing, simply studying the teen carefully. Darren now feared Fukushu would ignore his warnings, remaining in hiding as the curve of history once more turned in favor of the Normal. Instead Fukushu now slowly opened the doors, a stern look on his face as he glared at Darren. &quot;Let us talk Catalyst,&quot; he said. &quot;I will listen to what you have to say but tread carefully. My faith in humanity is limited, show me why I should trust you.&quot;</p>
