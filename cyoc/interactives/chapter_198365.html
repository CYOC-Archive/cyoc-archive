<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Victor slammed his fist against the wall for the ninth time, crying out desperately, “SOMEONE! PLEASE!” He shouted, losing his voice.<br />
It had been almost an hour since he’d woken up in this dimly lit, bland, empty stone room. It was anything but small, but he could see each of the four walls. With nothing there, he felt claustrophobic. Trapped. The only think he could see was the open sky above his head, the stars illuminating the night sky, but he could barely see them because of just how tall these walls there.<br />
<br />
He slid down, falling to the ground with his back against the wall. He could do nothing, the only reasonable thing he could do was just wait. Surely someone had to come find him. What purpose does leaving him there serve. It wouldn’t make any sense to just never come back… right?<br />
<br />
Victor contemplated his situation over and over. Going to sleep in his bed, his house, with his mother, father, his sister and brother all within a single household. But nothing. Victor was alone.<br />
<br />
“HELLO!?” A voice yelled so loud, it seemed to spread just far enough that Victor could hear a faint voice in the distance. Female… she seemed to be in distress. Maybe he wasn’t the only person here! Maybe he could find her and help her escape with him or…<br />
Victor couldn’t help but feel he was getting ahead of himself. This person sounded really far away, not to mention he probably couldn’t even get through these walls, they made almost no noise when he hit them. They must be incredibly thick.<br />
“HELLO! SOMEONE PLEASE ANSWER ME!!” The voice called again, sounding even more distressed. Victor recognised this voice, not as someone he recognised personally, but he could hear his own desperation within this voice. If anyone could help him, it was her. And he could help her too. Victor took a huge breath and yelled back,<br />
“I’M HERE!” He shouted, feeling his voice struggle with just how loud he shrieked, but she must’ve heard him. There was a pause, Victor suddenly thought that this voice just be in his head. Was he already going crazy?<br />
<br />
“I CAN HEAR YOU!” The voice shouted back. Victors hope struck back, he called again,<br />
“ARE YOU TRAPPED!?” He yelled, assuming she must be in the same situation,<br />
“UHM, I’M IN A LONG HALLWAY!!” She yelled back. Victor was surprised, maybe she could find her way to him and get him out somehow.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, without any kind of warning, Victor heard a really loud noise. Something like metal clashing with stone, like a lock being unhinged or something. Victor looked around to see if he could find out what the noise was, and quickly discovered that one of the walls was rapidly falling directly downwards. His natural instinct made his back away, and that seemed to be a good choice as the wall continued to fall until it had completely opened up, revealing a huge passageway. Where it had fallen it, had created a flush bridge that Victor could walk across.<br />
Checking the small room for a brief moment, making sure he hadn’t missed a single thing. Nothing, it was totally empty.<br />
<br />
Victor stepped into the giant hallway, finding himself incredibly unfamiliar with the layout, but also feeling as though he’d been wandering around for days, months, even like he’d been there his whole life.<br />
His willpower fought against what this labyrinth was trying to make him believe. He continued on, trying to work out where he was going, but he had no idea. That’s when he remembered,<br />
“I GOT OUT!” He yelled, hearing his own voice echo very far away. Not long after, he heard a voice reply back,<br />
“WHERE ARE YOU!?” The voice yelled back. He realised the voice sounded a lot closer than before. Maybe she wasn’t far. He then had an idea,<br />
“FOLLOW THE SOUND OF MY CLAPS!” He said, clapping his hands as loud as he could, continuing to do it every few seconds,<br />
“YOU’RE CLOSE!” The voice shouted back. Victor had never been this looking forward to seeing another persons face, especially someone he had never met.<br />
He continued to clap, over and over and over. Then he finally began to hear footsteps.<br />
<br />
He stopped clapping, listening closely to the footsteps. They were coming from one of the corners he’d been approaching. Without hesitation, and without much thinking, he ran towards the sound.<br />
He ran past the corner and suddenly heard a scream of fear,<br />
“AHHH— oh my god!” A girl screamed, falling onto her ass, hitting the hard floor. She looked up at Victor and looked him in the eyes, “YOU!” She shouted, pushing herself back and wrapping her arms around him, embracing him in a hug. Victor couldn’t feel at all awkward, in fact he hugged her right back. They were both just so happy to see a person in this completely empty place.<br />
<br />
The two finally stopped their hug. They looked at each other, absorbing their likeness’.<br />
Victor himself was a fairly average height guy, being about 18 years old. He had boyish long black hair that covered his face a little, however he swept it away. He wore a t-shirt and an over shirt, jeans, trainers, and had a little satchel he always carried around. He’d checked before, everyone inside it was gone, including his phone.<br />
The girl introduced herself,<br />
“I’m Fox,” she said. Victor looked a little surprised, “it’s a weird name, but my parents were weird so…” she chuckled to herself. Victor laughed with her, lightheartedly. She had dirty blonde hair and glasses. She was wearing shorts, boots, and a white t-shirt that appeared… a little too small for her. Victor picked up on this, not sure whether to comment on it. A good portion of her belly was poking out of it. She was fairly chubby, especially with a pretty round belly. She caught him looking,<br />
“Sorry…” Victor said, looking away awkwardly. She looked down, pulling her shirt over the exposed part of her belly only for it to bounce right back up, unable to hide it, <br />
“I-it’s fine,” she said, trying to not sound too insecure, “I swear to you, I was skinny before I woke up here.” Victor awkwardly laughed at her joke… oh… she wasn’t kidding,<br />
“Seriously?” He asked, “that doesn’t make any sense…” he stated,<br />
“Tell me about it,” she replied, she grabbed her belly, her soft (yet full) dough being kneaded pretty easily, “it’s totally weird… I don’t feel heavier, I just feel feel… bigger,” she explained. She was clearly coping pretty well for someone who appeared to have gained a considerable amount of weight. Suddenly, her stomach rumbled. This made her blush pretty hard,<br />
“Hungry?” Victor said, then cringing at his comment,<br />
“In a way…” Fox started, “yeah… I’ve been pretty hungry since I woke up, I hope there’s food somewhere, I’d eat anything at this rate,” she looked at herself, “well… like I’d need it,” she joked.<br />
<br />
Before either of the two could say anything, they heard a sudden clambering of footsteps running in their direction. Victor, being a natural protector of his younger siblings (and in a way, seeing his youngest sister in Fox), he stepped in front of her to protect her.<br />
Instead of a huge monster, which is kind of what both were expecting, they saw a short, red haired girl, was considerably large… assets, running towards them.<br />
She didn’t really pose much of a threat, but she did seem pretty urgent,<br />
“Who are you?” Victor asked, trying to come across as calm and confident, maybe to prevent her from becoming agitated.<br />
<br />
“DON’T JUST STAND THERE!” She screamed as she rushed past them. Victor and Fox looked at her as she ran, very confused. They both turned to where this girl was running from and realised,<br />
“Oh shit!” Victor shouted, grabbing Fox’s arm as he did.<br />
<br />
Behind them was a creature that could potentially be called ‘human-like’, except for it had eight arms, eight legs, fourteen eyes, and was running towards them like a spider.<br />
Victor and Fox ran as fast as they could, trying not to look behind them, but they could hear the creature scuttling behind them.<br />
Fox was losing breath fast. Considering this did appear to be a new physique for her, she was really struggling to keep up. Victor really wanted to pick her up and carry her, but he didn’t know how heavy she was, and he was fairly certain he could not carry her.<br />
They ran and ran, until Fox eventually could not run any longer. She began tripping over herself, her unable to breathe properly.<br />
<br />
Victor stopped with her, making sure she was okay. He was not going to ditch her.<br />
From ahead, the ginger haired girl yelled at him, “PLAY AN ADVANTAGE CARD!” Victor was puzzled by her, but she yelled again, “PLAY AN ADVANTAGE CARD, QUICKLY!”<br />
“O-OKAY…” Victor said, looking at the creature still approaching them, “I WANT TO PLAY AN ADVANTAGE CARD!” He yelled.<br />
And suddenly, Victor could hear a voice in the air. It was all around him, it was like it was inside his own mind,<br />
<br />
‘An advantage card to save a player shows compassion,<br />
I always hear that muscularity is in fashion’<br />
Victor felt overcome with adrenaline. He felt strong, he felt powerful. He looked at Fox, who appeared to be close to fainting. He placed her hands under her back and tried to lift her up.<br />
<br />
She certainly was heavy, way too heavy for Victor to pick up, but he just knew that he could do it. Lifting with his legs, he pulled.<br />
His arms and legs suddenly bulged outwards with thick, meaty muscle. His whole body started bulking up. He could feel his stomach flatten, abs protruding.<br />
He gave Fox one more lift, and suddenly, he had lifted her off of the ground, cradling her in his arms like the younger sister he could see her as. With his last move, his height increased to make him incredibly tall. His muscles bulged even more, tightening around his (previously) large shirt. But his legs, as the muscle exploded outwards, tore through his jeans, not breaking them completely, but leaving holes where he’d torn them.<br />
<br />
With Fox in his arms, the scary spider-human-monster closely behind, Victor began to run. And he ran fast.<br />
<br />
Quickly outrunning the monster, he caught up with the slowly out of breath ginger girl, who looked up at him with her eyes widened and said, “wow…”<br />
Before they could say much more, the girl spotted a hole in one of the stone walls, filled with light. She pointed at it, “in there!” She yelled. Victor was ready to run quickly to it, but he could see the girl losing her breath, starting to do what Fox had and tripping over her own feet. Without hesitation, and knowing that his own strength could handle it, he grabbed her by the back of her really small dress. She yelped as he then sprinted to the door, quickly entering it.<br />
He didn’t realise just how close the spider creature was, but it was pretty close… and these doors weren’t closing!!<br />
“THE DOOR!” He yelled to the ginger haired girl, who realised the issue as well.<br />
<br />
Victor laid Fox on the ground, rushing over to the left door, pushing it to close. The ginger girl was clearly really struggling with her side.<br />
Jumping over, Victor grabbed grabbed the door, pushing it with her.<br />
The creature was only a few metres away before Victor finally used his immense strength to close the gap between the doors.<br />
Like that’s the doors not only shut, but they quite literally sealed themselves as if they had never been opened from the beginning.<br />
<br />
Victor stood for a moment, catching his breath. The physical part wasn’t that difficult, his body was clearly capable of handling it with ease. But he was totally overcome with adrenaline from being a moment away from… what could only be assumed as death.<br />
He placed his back to the wall where the door was. He slid down it, falling to his butt, catching his breath.<br />
<br />
“That was intense, huh,” the girl said, smirking a little, scratching her hair.<br />
She was very short, somewhere around Victor’s waist level at his normal height. The most notable thing about her, excluding her bright ginger hair, was her large breasts and butt. Victor knew a lot of guys who would kill to even see a girl like her, and he knew even more girls who would kill to have a body like that.<br />
“I’m Victor,” he said, reaching his hand out to shake,<br />
“Chia,” she replied, shaking his hand. She looked down at herself, then looked back at Victor, “I’m a guy, by the way,” she said.<br />
“W-what?” Victor said, taken aback suddenly. Then remembering not only had Fox been slim before, but that he wasn’t actually a super buff guy normally, “right… did you use an Advantage Card then?” he asked,<br />
“What?” Chia responded, “heck no. You think this is an advantage!?” She replied, grabbing her breasts and lifting them, then dropping them to show the bounce, “I used a Disadvantage Card,” she clarified,<br />
“Wait, why?” Victor asked,<br />
“Oh, well I Disadvantage Cards grant a player a disadvantage change, but you also know how to get to the centre of the game,”<br />
“The centre?”<br />
“Yeah,” Chia said, “we need to get to the centre otherwise we’re just trapped here. The only way to get to the centre of the game is to play Disadvantage Cards. Otherwise we just won’t ever find a way out,”<br />
“So what’s the downside to Advantage Cards?” Victor asked,<br />
“Uhm… I think they may affect the way we can navigate to the centre, and make those monsters even worse…”<br />
“Oh… right,”<br />
“But you used yours at a good time!” Chia explained, “it clearly worked out, otherwise we’d be flies in that things web!”<br />
“Yeah, I guess so,” Victor replied, but then asked, “is there any way to undo it?”<br />
“Undo it?” Chia sounded a little shocked, “why would you wanna undo it? You look amazing!”<br />
“I… I don’t really like the whole ‘muscle god’ look,” Victor said, awkwardly,<br />
“Wow,” Chia replied, “that makes one of us,” she said, eyeing up his body,<br />
“I thought you were a guy?”<br />
“Gay, dude. I’m gay,”<br />
<br />
On that awkward note, Victor noticed Fox waking back up from her exhausted sleep.<br />
“What’s happening?” She asked, rubbing her eyes, “Mom?” She asked, still half asleep,<br />
<br />
“NOT QUITE” a loud voice said to everyone. They all jumped out of surprise, looking up to the high ceiling, seeing a glowing light…</p>
