<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I am ignoring the last spell done by the witch and only Jake has turned into a woman<br />
<br />
POV Owen<br />
<br />
When Princess Sara was first kidnapped by the witch Morgana all the princes were notified of her plight and were asked to help free her for a chance at her hand in marriage. Of all the princesses that I knew Sara was the kindest even though she was also the most shy. I would have headed out to save her regardless of a chance at marrying her, but Prince Jake had claimed that he would save her. Jake came from one of the larger central kingdoms and had a great amount of power. Me being merely the heir to a small northern city-state I could not challenge his claim. When it had been told that Jake had failed and was back at his castle I set out, but not before getting a few items from my local enchanter. My first stop was Jake’s castle so that I could get information on the witch before I attempted to rescue Sara. What I saw when I got there shocked me. I had not been close friends with Jake but we had been on several hunting expeditions together and had gotten to know each other. When entering Jake’s court I was announced as Prince Owen the owl a title I had gotten from my owl feathered cloak and my skill of hunting in silence. I was directed to a side balcony with small table with two chairs one which was occupied by a young women. I stood there stunned I had keen eyes and while the women in front of me wasn’t the Jake I knew it was undoubtedly Jake. After I got over my shock and sat down Jake told me what happened to him. He told how he had stormed the witch’s tower just to be cursed and taken captive by his own men. Apparently during the ride back to the castle Jake had continued to scream and struggle his lead the head of the guard sir Blane to say that he would give their captive something to really scream about. Suffice it to say that he had shown Jake the pleasure that his new female body could provide over the three days ride back to the castle. It was not until they reached the castle that the spell on Jake wore off except he didn’t return completely to normal now a female version of himself. Sir Blane seeing his mistake asked for forgiveness from his former prince now princess. Jake who had over the last three days of fucking the large and quite hung guard had become slightly addicted to sex with his new body had forgiven him. After seeing his court sorcerer Jake learned that he didn’t return to normal because he had pregnant during the course of the spell. Jake who now wanted to be called Jacqueline asked Sir Blane to take responsibility for what he had done by marrying her. <br />
<br />
After hearing Jacqueline’s story she played at bemoaning the loss of her manhood but I had spotted her occasionally rubbing her belly fondly. I thought that Jacqueline was happier this way and the rest of her kingdom would be happier to. Wishing her good luck with her wedding and getting a strange invitation to stay the night, with Jacqueline saying that her and Blane were open to a third in their bedchambers I declined and set out for Morgana’s tower <br />
<br />
I was now tracking through the woods headed in the direction of the witches tower. I was being cautious as I saw the tower in the distance knowing there would most likely be a ward around the lands of the tower that would alert the witch to my approach. When I was around a quarter mile away from the tower I found a line of small mushrooms that gradually arched around the tower which I assumed formed a ring around the tower. Being carful not to touch or cross the ring of mushrooms I crouched and examined the mushrooms. While doing this and thinking about how I could bypass the ring I caught an odd scent. The scent was reminiscent of dragon urine, but Jacqueline hadn’t said anything about a dragon being here. On further inspection I found that the whole ring had the odd smell. My guess was that scent was used to scare off wild life so that they did not trigger the ward. My plan now was to cause a stampede of wild animals to pass through the ward and run in with them. Hopefully the witch would take it as a false alarm and miss that I entered her lands. <br />
<br />
I had spent most of my adult life as an adventurer because I was the second son and would not inherit the throne. This was until a year ago my older brother renounced his claim to the throne so that he could marry a lovely arachne women leaving me the first inline to inherit the throne. My adventuring days had given me a lot of experience in tracking down animals and monsters and it took only a short time to find a sizable group of dear and elk for the stampede. Next came the run of my life as I chased the large group of animals back in the direction of the tower. Panting and about to collapse I leap onto the back of a large deer and ride it across the ring of mushrooms. After a few seconds I tumble off and roll into a bush and hide myself as much as possible. To be safe I wait in that bush for an hour as the sun starts to set. I then silently get out of the bush and prepare to rescue Sara<br />
<br />
I took stock of what I had, one enchanted cloak of silence, one elven short sword, four throwing knives, one throwing axe, a lock pick set,  a pouch of common antidotes, some rope, a small tinderbox, and three things that I had gotten from the enchanter. The first item was a pair of undergarments with intricate runes woven into the fabric Calder the old enchanter claimed that their were for fighting sucubus and would prevent magic from effecting my crotch. I would have preferred something that protected my whole body but this was all Calder had. The second item was a draft of the tongueless a potion that would prevent anyone dosed with it from speaking. This would prevent the witch from casting most of her magic. The last item I had gotten, Calder had said was the most important, but I had been hesitate to take it. The item in question was a tincture of lust. Calder had explained that the most witches like Morgana had gained their immense magic through dark magic that required they be a virgin. The lust potion would cause the witch to be uncontrollably horny allowing me to take her virginity and a vast amount of her magic. I would rather I did not have to use it because it would be too close to rape for my tastes. <br />
<br />
I snuck towards the tower being sure to stay out of sight from any of the tower’s window. The sun had set by the time that I had reached the base of the tower. I didn’t dare use the front door not knowing what spells might be on it, but there were several open windows on the second floor. I was an adept climber and in little time I was quietly pulling myself through a window and was now in the tower. The room I found myself in was a small storage room with barrels of different vegetables and fruits. I left the room being careful not to let the door squeak and made my way up the tower. At the top of the tower was one door and I could hear a voice coming from the other side. “So do you want to watch our little Jacqueline again tonight” said the voice and the sound of an affirmative followed then the sound of chanting came and went and a glow came through the doors key hole. I looked through the key hole and saw Sara she had a collar around her neck and a cord trailing from it. I changed my angle and saw a woman who had to be the witch Morgana. See was looking at a mirror frame but rather than her reflection being in the mirror there was an image of princess Jacqueline getting undressed. The image was moving like we were seeing the real thing then I realized the witch must be scrying through the mirror, projecting a live feed of the princess’s bedchamber. The witch’s back was to the door and this would be my best chance. I could sneak up behind her and give her a quick end with a knife across her throat. with my lock pick in hand and my cloak’s enchantment muffling the noise I unlocked the door and eased it open Morgana was still facing away from me as I approached with knife in hand. I was almost on top of her when a yell of “behind you” came from my left. On instinct I rolled to my right jumped up and threw my knife behind where I was, but nothing was there. Too late I turned to the witch seeing her shocked face and magic gathering around her hands. I realized that the yell was not for me but the witch and cursed myself as the witch finished her spell and cast it towards me. The bolt of magic hit me dead center chest leaving me feeling very strange. A moment later my body flashed with a bright light causing me to stumble to my knees. A few seconds of blindness later my vision cleared and I could see again. The flash had not only blinded me but the witch as well. Without thinking I threw one of my potions at her hoping it had been the draft of the tongue less to stop anymore spells from being cast. My luck was against me and when the potion bottle smashed at the stunned witch’s feet a pink mist spread throughout the room. I stood up and braised for what ever came next and my chest started to throb. I begun to feel really hot all over my body and I could not stop myself from staring to strip down. As I removed my shoes then cloak my chest started to feel tight in my shirt and my hips felt tight in my pants. When I got my weapon harness and belt off my shirt started to creak with the strain of holding what was expanding underneath. I could not remove my shirt normally because the buttons were too tight and I was forced to rip the shirt open sending the buttons flying. As the shirt was violently opened a huge pair of breasts were exposed as they flopped out for both Sara and Morgana to stare at. I looked at them and they had started to strip down as well and were now staring at him and rubbing themselves between their legs. I then felt a huge urge to walk over and grope the oddly youthful and sexy witch, but before I could take a step my crotch began to strain against my pants and bulge outward. Pulling down my pants I saw the enchanted undergarments straining against a bulge much larger than my normal bulge. The runes on the piece of clothing seemed burnt and destroyed. With a groan the taxed garment ripped, exposing a wrist thick cock that was longer than my forearm and tennis ball sized testicles hanging mid thigh in a hairless smooth sac. With my whole body exposed I realized what the spell had done to me. The spell was supposed to turn me into a woman but when it tried to effect my crotch the enchantment on my undergarments had opposed it and caused it to rebound turning me into hugely hung Amazon of a women with breasts the size of watermelons. <br />
<br />
Apparently the exposing of my cock had been too much for Morgana and she arched her back in orgasm spraying her sex fluids all over the ground in front of her. Soon after and before I could react both Sara and Morgana had gotten on their knees in front of me and were licking my cock. Their tongues felt amazing as Sara was slowly licking from base to head and Morgana sucked at the tip. I found my hands reaching the back Morgana’s head pulling her forward, forcing my cock into her mouth. Morgana’s tongue still danced around my cock and Sara shifted her attention to my balls rubbing and sucking at them. I wanted to go deeper into Morgana’s throat but I didn’t want to hurt her that was until Morgana put her hand behind my back squeezing my now round and plush ass, and begun to pull herself closer to my crotch. She was forcing my cock down her throat trying to get as much cock into her as possible. When she was halfway down the cock her throat bulged out obscenely with the tip of my cock at the base of her neck about to enter her torso. Morgana began to bob her head back and forth each time she pulled down she got just a little deeper. I was rapidly approaching orgasm but I did not want to release until I was balls deep. To speed the process along I reasserted pressure on the back of Morgana’s head every time she went down. Soon Sara had to move away so that Morgana could get closer to my crotch. Sara moved behind the witch and begun to massage her breasts focusing on the witch’s erect nipples. Shortly after I had done it, I was now balls deep and Morgana’s nose was buried in the small bush above my dick. I couldn’t hold any longer and with a loud groan I released a huge load almost directly into Morgana’s stomach. I wanted to saver this feeling but the woman could only hold her breath so long so I pulled out leaving the witch to fall back and lying naked on the floor her belly showing an almost imperceptible bulge of the excess semen in her. Sara had moved closer to me and was now trying to do what the witch had just done by coaxing my cock back to it’s erect state, but the small part of my brain that was unclouded by the lust potion was telling me that I had to deflower the witch to prevent her from doing anymore harm. I didn’t like having to push Sara way but I told her I had to do it with Morgana once more then I would focus on her. Sara pouted but backed up and spread the witch’s legs making it clear the she wanted me to finish with Morgana as soon as possible. I knelt in between the spread legs and lined up the tip of my cock with the entrance of the exposed womanhood. Before I could enter, Morgana whimpered asking for me to wait. I was about to ignore her and plunge in but then shyly Morgana asked that I be gentle as it was her first time. I leaned forward and kissed her and pinched her nipples then whispered into her ear “No promises”. Morgana blushed as I started to push forward entering her sopping wet pussy. I felt her hymen break and her eyes flashed and she moaned. The sex that followed was amazing with Sara joining in by having Morgana eat her out while massaging my breasts. After I left the former witch with a noticeable swell of semen on her belly I moved on to Sara taking her in both her front and back doors. The rest of the night passed in a blur and when I woke up I found Sara sleeping on top of me her head between my breasts, and Morgana was lower in between my legs cuddling with my cock between her breasts. Cum was everywhere, my body felt sore all over, and my mind had finally been cleared of the lust potion’s effect. I now had to decide what to do with the former witch and my new body.</p>
