<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When the new mannequins came in, a lot of people at first commented on their oddly life-like quality. Unlike the majority of them, these came with a variety of shapes, sizes, eye colors, and attention paid to every sculpted curve of muscle and &quot;skin&quot;. It was somewhat uncanny, between that, the fake hair, the intense eyes and the serious, expressionless faces. Of course, despite coming in from corporate at the mall, nobody really knew who the supplier was outside the higher ups. Apparently it was some sort of store that offered a mannequin that would really fit and wear the clothes in the stores well. <br />
<br />
But then, people eventually got used to the presence of these odd mannequins. They were just another part of the shopping experience at the mall. And even with the decline of the shopping mall as a location, the young people who still frequented the place gave the location something to help it endure. And the teens even took to pictures with these odd human sized dolls. Treating them like they were props to be used for social media when the shopkeeps weren&#39;t looking.<br />
<br />
Some even joked about how weirdly life-like the things were.<br />
<br />
Though the young people there likely had no idea how accurate their jokes and memes really were. It happened one night, long after everyone left the mall for their homes - at least, the most lawful of the visitors. Even the shop runners went home after closing down. <br />
<br />
In the Allenforte Apparel store, a sporty brand aiming for young people who fit the image of jocks among the boys, and their cheerleader girlfriends as far as girls, something was happening that night. The bars, closed down in the entry to the store, prevented anyone from entering or leaving the store. The lights were dim, and only the moon showed through the ceiling window above just outside the store. <br />
<br />
One of the mannequins had the appearance of a sculpted, muscular blond young man. The picture of that stereotypical athlete to be pined for. He filled out the white tank top, green and blue vest and blue jeans abundantly well. His features would be handsome and appealing if he were real... and then, aberrant, something happened. One painted blue eye blinked open and closed, then the other. With a creak, the living posing item stretched and felt previously inanimate joints come to life. Confusion blossoming across a formerly featureless face.<br />
<br />
Speaking in a voice that sounded somewhat synthesized, the mannequin rubbed his forehead, &quot;How---Where am I? I don&#39;t remember...anything else before this. Wait...why was I...?&quot; The first moments of awareness are often rough, and if he was something or someone else before being turned into this, he didn&#39;t remember that whatsoever. As far as he knew, he woke up suddenly, awake - aware - an adult man in mind and body.<br />
<br />
There should be something before. A state to continue from. But he couldn&#39;t remember what it was.<br />
<br />
Taking a full step off of his stand, he was immediately left thinking of the humans he&#39;d seen walking through the store in some dim state of semi-waking fugue. He hadn&#39;t been able to move, or really have much of a conscious conception of himself - yet he could remember details of how people looked. The forms they had, and the differences between them and him. The living doll looked at his own hands. A slight frown passing over plastic features that now shifted like mortal flesh. <br />
<br />
Fingers divided by tiny joints. A quick dash into one of the changing rooms and yanking a cord to turn on the lights, and he stood in front of a mirror, showing the new man the details of his body. He pulled his shirt off in short order, observing the literally sculpted abs and pectorals. Here he had a physique most men literally had to train years for, yet he was seemingly just built with it. His features handsome, Ken doll-like. His broad shoulders have a visible joint at the underarm, through a black line. These lines crossed his body, delineating each part&#39;s separation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...do not have a name.&quot; He vaguely remembered guests at the mall saying names to one another. Chad, Michael, Brian, Adam, Kevin... &quot;I want---I want a name. I&#39;m awake. I&#39;m alive. I should have a name.&quot; Crossing his arms and pouting in front of the mirror, he contemplated names. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...Chase.&quot; He couldn&#39;t say that many men had that name. As far as his dim recollections on that stand went, not that many Chases went through the area. &quot;I&#39;m Chase! I&#39;m Chase! I&#39;m Chase!&quot; He repeated, overjoyed. A broad smile on his face, and as he put his shirt back on, contemplating where things would go from here, he heard a sound outside. Beyond the familiar store limits. Someone walking around the mall hallways.<br />
<br />
Curious and eager to see what might be going on, filled with the naivety of a young man, Chase walked out of the changing room and slowly walked over toward the closed down front entrance. It sounded like somebody really trying not to make too much noise, but failing in one crucial instance just enough to get Chase&#39;s attention. &quot;This could be my first real interaction. Most people just seemed to...take pictures of me or something.&quot; The new being reminisced, eager to see what was going on.<br />
<br />
It seemed someone was crouched by the box that controlled the entry into the store. She was a blonde woman with green eyes, tanned skin going by her face, a bang hanging near her left eye. She was dressed in all black, and going by her form she was both athletic and very obviously well formed. Seeing this cat burglar in the act spurred something in Chase. The first time he&#39;d seen someone, and that someone was a very beautiful woman.<br />
<br />
A flush of lust through his artificial body. Chase hardly even knew what the feeling was, just that it felt amazing, intense, and left him feeling fixated. He didn&#39;t even know how to alleviate or participate in these feelings, just that they seemed to concentrate in his crotch. She...she was beautiful, she was---hot? Hot was the word some of the guys he heard before used. Yeah, she was hot and Chase wanted to---Chase wanted to---there was something there he could not place yet. But he knew there was an end goal to his yearning.<br />
<br />
His contemplations were however cut short as a loud clack issued from the security system to the store. &quot;Siamo buoni~!&quot; The woman muttered under her breath, and as the gate lifted from the store, the sheer shock of the noise and the shift in the gate so closeby resulted in Chase falling forward and just barely catching himself in front of the cat burglar.<br />
<br />
Near immediately, Celeste found herself looking at something she had no reference point for. <br />
<br />
She&#39;d hoped to just steal some money from the register, maybe evade or elude a few pudgy security chumps, but she outright froze like a deer in the headlights when Chase landed in front of her. She saw the joints in his hands, the eyes, the mouth with a speaker built into the back. The false hair, and the clothes being modeled in the store. &quot;Holy...holy shit...! Holy shit...&quot; Celeste began to murmur, not keen on alerting the two security guards still roaming the rest of the mall as to her location but outright completely surprised by this turn of events.<br />
<br />
&quot;I---I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to---&quot; Chase started, getting himself back up and crouching in front of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are a fucking talking mannequin, just about everything about you is &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to&quot;,&quot; Celeste whispered, &quot;How? How did this---? I mean, I&#39;ve been through this place a couple times and nobody but you&#39;s ever pulled a Twilight at the Museum on me.&quot; She started to calm down - after all, you couldn&#39;t be a thrill thief without adapting fast to a situation. And besides - in movement, he was...admittedly kinda cute.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have honestly no idea. Just...I woke up tonight in the store. I can vaguely remember standing there as everybody passed by, but its kinda dim.&quot; Crossing his arms, Chase looked the young woman over, her black leather top hugging to her breasts very flatteringly. He - with no social graces - outright stared for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I must be your first woman. You know, it&#39;s officially rude to stare, but I won&#39;t hold it against a new boy.&quot; Celeste coyly stated. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Oh! I&#39;m---I&#39;m sorry I uh---&quot; Chase was starting to realize he probably made a lot of faux pas during his brief time with the first human he knew...only for her to press a finger to his lips. Calming him and making him feel like he should be blushing as she pressed her finger against his lower lip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, big boy.&quot; Celeste looked around and then figured she could play around a bit tonight, &quot;I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;ve ever been kissed...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kissed? Definitely not. I barely know what that is. I just...&quot; Chase paced a little bit in front of Celeste and recalled, &quot;I saw a guy and...another guy? They definitely put their lips on each other. And I think that&#39;s probably it. They said a word that sounded like kiss. I---I uh, I want to be kiss---&quot;<br />
<br />
And Celeste again shut Chase up by leaning in and planting her lips on him. Admittedly it was like kissing a doll, all plastic, but his reaction sealed it for her. He was stunned and stammered as she led the way. Clasping the back of his head and leading him along into the kiss, which steadily grew more steamy. Admittedly there was a thrill in giving such an introduction to a thing like this guy. Chase absolutely fell into the kiss, unsure what to do with his arms but following her lead and trying to kiss her, only for his largely immobile tongue to betray him.<br />
<br />
When she pulled away, she asked, &quot;And what&#39;s your name, dolly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Chase. I decided on the name just a couple minutes ago.&quot; If he could blush, he would be right now. The way she rubbed his bicep, let her hand trail on his chest...it was like nothing Chase could&#39;ve imagined. That heady feeling was more intense than ever. Chase&#39;s hips pressed himself against her, and it seemed Celeste noticed his erratic, intense need.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, let&#39;s see if you&#39;re even capable...&quot; She knew she was getting sidetracked, but this was buckwild enough to easily be worth it. Here she was basically giving sex ed to a living mannequin on his first night of sentience. Yet there was a vibe it seemed that Chase might have lost some memories. Somehow, something left him like this. Honestly, she was excited to see where this might go.<br />
<br />
Chase let out a whimper of excitement as Celeste helped pull down his jeans. It seemed in order to simulate a crotch, Chase was built with a curving, six inch plastic rod in his pants, and a single mass imitating the look of a scrotum. &quot;So you do have a cock, for a given definition of cock. Do you want me to help you get off, Chase?&quot;<br />
<br />
A few frantic nods from the new man told Celeste all she needed to know. Now, she was hardly inexperienced, and part of her bad girl track record was her status with the guys. If she liked a man&#39;s look, she&#39;d sleep with him. Her pleasure was her priority. So she had learned a wide variety of methods for pursuing pleasure. &quot;Now, I know these terms don&#39;t mean anything to you, Chase, but I want you to choose. Hand job? Or Blowjob? Trust me, big man, they both feel amazing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chase stammered, eager but confused and so, so incredibly excited...</p>
