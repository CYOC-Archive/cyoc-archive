<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been more than 3 days since Prince Hillbert had left the camp to rescue the Princess. His squire Billy was left to take care of the luggage with his donkey, george. Billy had always admired Prince Hillbert, he'd kind of been his childhood hero and being asked to become the Princes' squire was perhaps his proudest moment. He dreamt of becoming a brave knight one day but Hillbert's disappearance worried him. They had scarecly been separated for long since they met if the Prince had been successful he would have sent word. The only thing he could think of was that the Prince had been captured and so it fell upon him to rescue him.<br />
<br />
He rode george to the farm where the Princess was said to be on the 4th morning. He had decided to go at dawn as he'd be able to see without lighting a torch that might give him away. Keeping George quiet though had been difficult and cost him a number of carrots but that was not important. What was important was that Hillbert's horse was still here tethered to a fence in a field full of sleeping cows. He approached the horse. it appeared that most of Hillberts belonging were packed on the horse. He went to remove Hillbert's shield from atop the horse as he did not have one of his own. As he did so he disturbed a vial of green liquid hidden beneath it. The vial droppped the earth spilling open the horse bucked and neighed trying to breakfree of its tether. the green liquid turned to gas and Billy went to cover his mouth but it was already too late. He collapsed and the world drifted away.<br />
<br />
Billy awoke in the field. He was naked and his nose hurt tremendously. Looking around he couldn't see the horse but a cow was standing off to his left, grazing. He felt his nose and met awith a huge cold, metal ring far too big for his nose. No it would be more at home on a cow he thought! Looking around panicked he saw her. She was a very sultry woman. Dark haired, with an enormoous bust. The boy couldn't help but stare. He also couldn't help but be aroused. His small, boyish hands did little to cover up that fact.<br />
<br />
&quot;So tell me Billy&quot; she said, &quot;do you dream of being a big and powerful male. Your strength only matched by your bravery. Do you dream as all boys dream of sexual conquests and contests of strength. Is that what you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;um... yes miss&quot; he didn't know what was going on but it sounded like he was being offered something amazing. Something magical, Powerful!<br />
&quot;Well I can make that happen.&quot; she brought a wand up to face him and he felt a surge of energy course through him.<br />
<br />
The changes started fast. The first thing he noticed was he was growing out in all directions with muscle. The second thing he notice was his penis expand in girth and length. This woman truly was amazing. He already felt stronger. The next thing he noticed was the thick coat of fur and he remembered the nose ring that now seemed to fit perfectly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've given you what you want Billy, just like I gave Hillbert what he craved most. He thought of nothing but breasts and milk now there he is&quot; she pointed to the cow no longer grazing obliviously but watching billy's change.<br />
<br />
Billy just felt even more powerful. He knew what was happening but to turn into a bull when the man he looked upto was a cow. It seemed to billy like he had bested him. Billy felt strange looking at the cow. Moments ago he had been attracted to the witch, now he had eyes only for this cow before him. His member was so hard it was all he could do to not fuck the beast now. He felt a tail sprout from above his buttocks and horns above his head. Before long he was on all fours llike the wild beast he now was. He circled around sniffing Hillbert, now Bertha the cow. She wanted him too, he just knew it. A part of him had been waiting for permission from his former master and that scent was it. He was the master now and he would make this heiffer his. He leapt atop her surprised and  excited at how deep she went. The heiffer mooed in pleasure, she knew she was his now.</p>
