<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stacy grinned looking down at the traffic down at her highschool&#39;s completely bottlenecked parking lot. A lot of eyes were trained on Stacy... if not for the fact that a Harpy was landing nearby, but the fact that she was doing flips and twirls between building roofs, and the tops of other somewhat tall objects. One benefit of having a tiny and slim body... aside from making it easy to fly also made it easier to do stunts and gymnastics in mid-air. The girl whose status as a cheerleader was a little in the air somewhat grinned as the people stared at her for a bit... was also a little happy that her bags didn&#39;t put her over weight capacity. She managed to walk a bit better, but it still felt incredibly clunky for her especially after knowing she could just fly. <br />
Josh got off the bus, and as he was walking to where his first period class was looked across campus... and somewhere in the distance Josh noted some feathery mass doing maneuvers near the science building. His eyebrow arched a bit as he was expecting that Stacy would be a little upset or down in the dumps? But she seemed to be really enjoying herself.<br />
Josh beelined his way to the locker room so he didn&#39;t have to change in front of so many guys. One quick change later and Josh was out and ready for warmups. A few minutes later the other guys were out, and a few minutes later people were starting to get confused of what was going on in the locker room. Then a bombshell of a woman seemed to come out with a bunch of the other teen girls. Her gym clothes were in a size large which didn&#39;t really show off her curves much, but she still had this aura about her that turned heads.<br />
&quot;Sorry Coach, a little chit-chat went for a little too long.&quot; said the bombshell at which point Josh thought the voice sounded familiar and was able to look her in the face. Now that he thought about it the tail, and claw like fingers... also the horns made it all obvious that Cindy was back. Also just like Stacy she seemed to be much more comfortable in her new body. The coach was a very faithful man to his wife, but being introduced to succubus aura he blushed hard and stammered. He hand-waved it and just had us do some laps. Cindy looked at her feet for a second, but just ran laps like usually although a bit faster now that her legs were a bit longer. When we finished, and just did some basketball till the end of the period she was kind of the mvp. Sure she was taller, stronger, and faster than normal and was basically peak teenage human... but she didn&#39;t have any skills or muscle memory so she wasn&#39;t really the best player. The mvp was more she just distracted... everyone so she ended up getting uncontested shots. It was also so easy to get distracted considering the way the sweat just glistened off that flawless skin despite the pretty poor lightning in the gymnasium. <br />
<br />
At lunch Drew said &quot;No you aren&#39;t doing me!&quot; as the two boys sat next to the two now monster girls. <br />
Cindy giggled and said &quot;Aw, but you&#39;d make such a cute monster.&quot; <br />
Drew sunk his nails into his arm some more and said &quot;No Cindy.&quot;<br />
Josh curiously asked &quot;So, you two seem to be a bit more comfortable in your bodies.&quot;<br />
Stacy said &quot;Well I like my new things, but I am still feeling a little awkward walking and now my bed feels pretty awkward. May need to make some sort of nest thing.&quot; <br />
Cindy said &quot;Yeah... For sure most of my clothes don&#39;t really work with this body anymore... or if you asked some people they worked a little too well.&quot; she stabbed her food around a bit and said &quot;Also did a few things we should probably discuss more in private.&quot; One of the football jocks came nearby, took a glance at us, and then left. <br />
As we continued to eat some guy came up and asked &quot;So you can turn people into monsters of myth?&quot;<br />
Josh looked over and said &quot;I guess I did?&quot;<br />
&quot;Then do me! Those two seem to be enjoying themselves better now!&quot;<br />
Stacy said &quot;I mean I like flying, but it&#39;s a bit more complicated than-&quot; the monsterfication was a bit of a hot topic and someone else shouted the other guy down. Then another person joined in, and then another. Josh, Cindy, Stacy, and Drew managed to sneak out. <br />
Drew sighed and said &quot;Well that was inevitable...&quot; <br />
Josh asked &quot;What do you mean?&quot; <br />
Drew rolled his eyes and said &quot;Well it takes a significant amount of magic to even become an elf. Magic items are still relatively expensive, and tend to have protection to make magical changes very unlikely to happen. So unless you know magic it&#39;s hard to change, and it seems you know some sort of inherent magic.&quot; Josh thought back to the magnifying glass still on his person and wondered if he should ditch it. It just felt wrong to try that.<br />
Cindy asked &quot;Think some cult is going to go after Josh?&quot;<br />
Drew said &quot;Those are just urban myths... mostly. I&#39;m just wondering what our school is going to do.&quot;<br />
Stacy wondered &quot;I wonder if the cheerleading team can even let a Harpy be in. If we do any competition that feels like a potential unfair advantage...&quot;<br />
Josh sighed and said &quot;Well, not much we can do about it right now. I guess we just try to lay low?&quot; the four of them agreed, and tried to stay as unnoticed as possible. To which only Drew was really successful at as the only non-magic non-monster. At least in class the arguments about monsterfication weren&#39;t focused on. Sometime during 4th period the principal on the intercom stated that anyone caught arguing about the monsterfication would be brought to detention which seemed to put a freeze on discussion in-between periods. <br />
<br />
The end of the school day occured, Stacy had cheerleading practice... or at least she&#39;d go to the practice to see how everything would end up. Cindy, Drew, and Josh also found it was hard for them to get together as there were a lot of people going to Cindy and Josh to ask them for questions, favors, to give them a blow job... maybe that last one was just asked to Cindy.</p>
