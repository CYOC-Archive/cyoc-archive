<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">    When you arrived home, saying that you were slightly irritated that every stray animal you saw ran away from during your four and a half hour search in the middle of the night was an understatement. It seem as if they could feel you coming from a mile away and despite your constant coaxing using food the best you got was a long scratch on your left check from a haggard old alley cat. You gave a loud tired yawn, grumpy and irritable as you made your way to your doorstep, mumbling swear words as you unlock your the front door.<br />
<br />
   However when you opened the door and went inside, hoping none of your neighbors saw you going inside your house at such late hours you noticed something else&#39;s presence staring up at you. Almost creepily standing by the door completely motionless was your faithful latex creature Ryan, the pink anthro bunny. You give a sudden jerk of suprise and mild fright before calming down looking down at the pink rabbit boy.<br />
<br />
  Ryan looked up at you recognizing you before taking your hand with his left paw and began moving further inside. Not sure what was going on you followed Ryan noticing that none of your other latex creatures were in the living room or in the kitchen as you kept letting Ryan lead you, where were they all? You didn&#39;t hear anything upstairs either.<br />
<br />
    You pondered this as Ryan took you down into your basement which was about the size of the average living room and also functioned as your laundry room. <br />
<br />
   However when Ryan led you inside the basement you quickly saw another way it had been put into use.<br />
<br />
     You immedialy saw a sickening sight of about a dozen or so human captives of various ages all lying on the floor, some conscious others not, about eight of them males with the rest being females with all of them having mouths gagged with duct tape and limbs tied with rope (You would later know that Johnathon had taken a knot tying class back when he was still in high school before he dropped out) which had originally belonged to your grandfather who was a farmer though you doubted he would be proud of what you saw before you.<br />
<br />
    Your other latex creatures expect for Dylan were all here each of them taking their own guarding positions around the room should one of their hostages try to escape save for Delta whose intense seemingly constant lust for sex had caused her to continuously rub herself against both male and female captives alike, her feline pussy moist and dripping as you as she sexually purred. Though most of the eyes were on you especially the eyes of the captives themselves.<br />
<br />
    At first the still conscious captives saw you and were originally giving gagged cries for help though the faint hope in their eyes had been turned into fear when they saw your latex creatures bow to you.<br />
<br />
          In the corner of the room was a cardboard box that you usually used for holding laundry but was nowfilled with several electronic devices and anything else that could potentially be used as a weapon instead. The sight of all of their phones taken away from them so they wouldn&#39;t be able to call for help sickened you. <br />
<br />
    You didn&#39;t expect you&#39;d be so remorseful at the fact you had willingly sent out your soldiers to capture all of these innocent people who didn&#39;t even cause you any harm. It seems like the wand didn&#39;t take all of your humanity as you thought it did. <br />
<br />
     Looking at all of the captives, a look of regret had crossed your face for a single second and you half considered releasing them before you shook your head.<br />
<br />
   No.<br />
<br />
   This needed to be done, you needed to find out the extent of your latex wand. Being a pussy when you have to get your hands dirty would only send you falling into the hands of whoever was sent out to take this wand.<br />
<br />
<br />
           You look at Alpha who was standing in the corner and asked &quot;Has Dylan come back yet?&quot; <br />
<br />
  Alpha shook his head.<br />
<br />
    You gave a sigh, hopefully Dylan hadn&#39;t been captured you thought as you turned to Thomas who was looking straight at you.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Thomas, did... did you capture all these people?&quot; You questioned.<br />
<br />
   Thomas the red latex dragon nodded, a faint squeak as he spread out his draconic wings to show them off.<br />
<br />
   Of course. Thomas wasn&#39;t a dragon for nothing.<br />
<br />
   &quot;I didn&#39;t expect you to capture so many in such a short time. Did you make sure to cover your tracks?&quot;<br />
<br />
    A nod.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Did you all also make sure to throughly search them?&quot; <br />
<br />
   Another nod from Alpha who was standing beside Thomas.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Let me guess, Delta searched them?&quot; You sarcastically added as you see the latex tigress herself moved her hands onto the chest of one of the female captives.<br />
<br />
           Alpha gave a faint eye roll as he nodded. His tail swishing gently around him as he stood against the wall, arms crossed.<br />
<br />
        You gave him an understanding eye roll too before you turned back to Thomas and said &quot;Well Thomas, you outdone yourself on this one, good job Thomas, I&#39;ll make sure to reward you properly after all of this is done.&quot; You say.<br />
<br />
  Thomas gives another bow and a rubbery squeak of thanks before standing back up.<br />
<br />
    Now giving your attention to the twelve captives. Their eyes sickened with either fear or anger as you began to speak. <br />
<br />
   &quot;Captives hear me out, whilst I do admit that I am the one who ordered you all to be taken here against your will, know this none of you will be harmed tonight unless you try to leave. Instead tonight, you will all be given new lives here and you will all be the first to join my new empire. Though what I am saying seems confusing right now, once the experimentation begins I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll all understand. Heck depending on your personal fetishes you might even turn willing.&quot; You joked though no one was laughing expect for Johnathon the brown latex bear who gave a brief squeaky chortle.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Now let the experiments begin, Beta and Alpha both of you grabbed and strip one of the hostages and hold them as I start. Make sure he doesn&#39;t escape, if he tries something dangerous you know what to do. Thomas while they do that grab one of my tripod film camera upstairs in my bedroom and bring it down here so you can film the experiments&quot; You order watching as Beta and Alpha randomly pick one of the males, Beta grabbing him by the arms as Alpha unties and strips him, taking off his gag as well leaving him completely nude for all to see. Thomas moved passed you upstairs, closing door behind him as you heard his faint footsteps go upstairs.<br />
<br />
   Alpha and Beta brought him up to you hold him him by the arms so both you and the rest of the captives could see him as you examined his features giving him a keen inspection as he silently looked at you with fear and eventually Thomas without a word came back clutching your tripod with one arm and set it up, giving out a squeak of confirmation.as he started recording.<br />
<br />
  As Thomas did that you looked at the male and his physical features.  He was young around his early twenties with blond hair and green eyes with a faint beard on his face. He had an average build with an average penis length. (At this point you were pretty sure you were looking at his dick for the sake of looking at it.)<br />
<br />
           &quot;Occupation?&quot; You asked, not even bothering to ask for his name.<br />
<br />
   &quot;C-college student sir.&quot; He stuttered out quietly.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Alright then, what&#39;s your favorite color and animal?&quot; <br />
<br />
   The male gave a look of confusion before answering with a slightly louder voice &quot;Gray and my favorite animal is a hawk.&quot;<br />
<br />
   You nod and then take a step back before pointing your latex wand at him.<br />
<br />
   You close your eyes concentrating. So far all you knew was that atleast small animals like rats due to their lack of biomass were unable to be corrupted though you were unsure about larger animals, you also knew that you were able to choose whatever latex color you blasted out of your wand but you weren&#39;t sure if you could control  what animal would actually form from it, that would be your question as you sent a blast of grey latex goo directly onto the mans chest.<br />
<br />
  The transformation was quick like the others. The goo quickly spread all over him forming into gray latex feathers, his legs and arms turned in scaled appendages. Two giant wings began forming on his back  as he gave out a long moan as the goo started to completely cover his head and body, forming a yellow hawk beak on his face his eyes narrowing and becoming more bird moving apart from eachother slightly as the transformation ended.<br />
<br />
   Instead of the collage student there was now a completely latex anthro hawk man standing there, Alpha and Beta letting him go as he no longer gave way to any previous struggle. He looked at himself examining his new feathered body along with his two new angel like wings before spreading them out before tucking them back. <br />
<br />
    You nodded giving him a quick glance over, especially at his new avian cock which was now much longer than it had been originally before you dismiss him with a hand. The latex hawk nods before moving beside Delta who was already feeling him up with the hawk clearly likeing the new attention.<br />
<br />
     Nodding to the two, you look back at the remaining captives already noticing the looks of pure shock on their faces as they saw one of their fellow captives turned into something else. <br />
<br />
             &quot;Now I am sure you all have seen what you will all turn into now. Simply accept it because no matter what happens it will happen to you.&quot; You say to them, with them giving out muffled begs of mercy in response.<br />
<br />
     You shake your head and continue, giving a slight yawn as you spend the next hour turning almost all of your captives into new latex creatures whilst also trying to find out the limits of your wand. <br />
<br />
      Surprisingly you learned much more about what you could and couldn&#39;t really do with your wand than you expected. You learned that once you had sent a latex blast out with a specific animal form in mind you couldn&#39;t change it midway which was useful to keep in mind as you kept changing your captives into their desire animals.<br />
<br />
   In the end your ranks gained a male grey latex hawk, three male latex wolves one blue, one red, one yellow which had all been subjected to multiple blasts of the same color respectively causing them to grow immensely into hulking wolven creatures twice as tall as you with muscles that could almost rival the Hulk&#39;s in size (thankfully your ceiling had a high roof) and long cocks almost as thick as your arm as well as being able to liquefy a large part of their bodies due to most of it becoming comprised of latex meaning they could go into places any normal sized human thougj with he weakness of being much slower due to their size compared to a normal latex creature.<br />
<br />
   The remaining latex creatures you made were a single dark green male cobra, one white male polar bear, an cyan female horse, one pink female house cats, with two captives still not corrupted yet, one being male and the other female. You didn&#39;t corrupt them yet since according to them they both were two politicians in their mid thirties which meant they were too valueable to turn into the regular sort of latex creatures for now. You had another idea for them but decided not to act on it until Dylan hopefully came back.<br />
However there was another experiment you did which was what you considered to be your ultimate creation yet.<br />
<br />
You had learned from your tests that with multiple latex blasts of the same color you were able to make the corrupted form much larger as evidence of the three huye latex wolves you made. However you had yet to try using multiple colors on one test subject which had led to incredible results.<br />
<br />
   His original form at first glance already showed promise. His human name was Jack Walker and was originally a twenty five year old muscular bodybuilder from Salt City who had taken his early morning walk when he was kidnapped, according to him who was giving Alpha and Beta some trouble keeping him restrained all throughout the questioning teven he couldn&#39;t stop Thomas from kidnapping him in the middle of the night though he had managed to break Thomas&#39; arm before it had instantly mended due to the dragon&#39;s latex body. Thomas himself confirmed this which gave you some level of respect for Allen before you corrupted him like the others.<br />
<br />
   When you corrupted him, using several different colors at once,  curious at what would happen you had no idea the extent of what you would create.<br />
 Allen&#39;s body had turned into a <br />
creature with the gray latex body and head of a wolf , the right arm of a black muscular latex gorilla, the left arm of a dark blue anthro shark, the strong legs of a blood red anthro lion along with the purple dick of a powerful stallion which was surprisingly already erect and leaking his latex pre-cum. His body was virtually a version bestial perfection. He was strong and muscular but lean with latex claws that seemed to be able to rend steel itself and jaws that could easily snap a humans neck with ease. He was incredible.<br />
<br />
  This one creation which you gave the simple name of Power because that&#39;s what he radiated was amazing. Despite the different colors which didn&#39;t exactly go well together, you felt nothing but power at this beast you made. Raw primal energy filled you as you saw this proud colorful hybrid beast, his cock harder than ever  with him already slowly  jerking off infront of you with his right arm almost as if to draw you into his huge tasty cock. <br />
   <br />
      The other latex creatures also seemed to notice this and bowed down to him, looking up at him worshiping him with fear at his venerable nature. <br />
<br />
        For a moment as you and Power locked eyes you were suddenly scared that he would overpower you and claim dominance over your latex creatures and closed your eyes for a second not wanting to look. However Power did no such thing as instead when you opened your eyes you actually saw Power kneeling before you, his long canine tongue licking at the buldge in your pants submissively causing you to moan at the touch.<br />
<br />
      Then you realized that even if he wanted to rebel he couldn&#39;t you owned the wand and as his creator no matter what he would always have to serve you.<br />
<br />
   An overwhelming sense of power filled you heard as you realized all of the things you could do with Power. But for now you ordered Power to stop distracting you as you thought of a game plan.<br />
<br />
   Already the basement was getting crowded, especially with the three brute Wolves. Soon enough you&#39;ll need a new place of Operations. And as you think you hear a knock upstairs. You motion for Beta to investigate and when he comes back Dylan the green latex chameleon appears, carrying an unconscious old man in his bathrobe. Dylan set him gently on the ground of the bastement floor before looking at all of his new fellow latex creatures already making excited squeaks of joy with his brother Ryan quickly joining him, both of them jumping around together creating squeaks of cheer together as Ryan introduces Dylan to their new friends and family.  They seem almost wary of Power so they avoid him last as you look at the man Dylan had brought. He looked familiar to you. Like someone you had seen on TV. Then it hit you this was Gilliam Bluemore one of the most successful corporate farmers in the country! <br />
<br />
  Dylan may not have captured many people but he did struck it as a new idea popped into your mind as you stared at Gilliam resting on the floor.</p>
