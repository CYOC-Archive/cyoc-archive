<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your wings are just fine...<br />
<br />
Good! You have to hurry before-!<br />
<br />
&quot;Sonny! I have warned ya! Now you&#39;re gett&#39;n a TIME OUT!&quot; And by that you can assume that he means swallowing you whole!<br />
<br />
You do not have time to think! In fact you need to go right now! But as you run/float with both your wings, and your foot. This whole thing feels hopeless at that point! And Mr. Caterpillar is catching up to you! You made a silent prayer to yourself.<br />
<br />
&#39;You have to believe! You have to... You-...&#39; You keep trying to fly as you are running with your fat legs in a thick diaper. You had been hovering for a few times before you&#39;re on the ground running on one foot. You&#39;re heading to the edge of the cliff! Either way! If you can&#39;t fly, then you&#39;ll just end it! Better those odds, then to keep living with that Tickle Monster!<br />
<br />
And so you keep running until you jump off to your death...<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
But then...<br />
<br />
Mr. Caterpillar is shocked at what he&#39;s seeing!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You&#39;re flying again! &#39;Yes! Bye-bye Mr. Caterpillar! I won&#39;t be missing you!&#39;<br />
<br />
And soon after that you have flown away, hoping to never look back ever again!<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
[Mr. Caterpillar]<br />
<br />
&quot;So he&#39;s really gone?... Ya can&#39;t keep them in forever.&quot; he wipes a tear form his eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it&#39;s for the best... I can&#39;t force anyone to be my baby...&quot;<br />
<br />
As he turns back to prepare for a visit. &quot;I should at least let Belle know what happened to the former human...&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
[You]<br />
<br />
And after what felt like hours when it could&#39;ve been minutes. You&#39;re losing what&#39;s left of your energy! You then found a hollow tree that you can use to take a nap. Whatever happens, happens. And maybe you&#39;ll meet this Mystery voice guy whoever he was. And so you slowly land on your feet and-<br />
<br />
&quot;AH-UGH!&quot; You just remembered your broken ankle. You&#39;re leaning on the wall to keep the pressure off of that foot, and you saw an opened portable pocket mirror, (or it would&#39;ve been if you were in your normal size, but right now) it is about the size of a body mirror for a fairy. So you gave yourself a look, and regret it.<br />
<br />
You still have these babyish clothing! A frilly outfit, booties, bonnet, and the most attention grabbing... Your Thick Diaper! &#39;If I have to keep wearing anymore diapers it&#39;d be too soon.&#39; You thought distastefully as you see yourself. You shake your head, and look away.<br />
<br />
So you moved on to find a clear corner to sleep at. There&#39;s no bed anyway. You don&#39;t know what to do about this, or how... The best thing for you is to take a nap, think about your future, and enjoy this freedom. While you still have it.<br />
<br />
You sat down, and close your eyes...<br />
<br />
And you&#39;re about to get a gift delivered to you in the most magical way possible!<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
And as you sleep, you start to see where you are now... A dark void is now a place that resembles a white room. All four walls, and four corners... It feels claustrophobic to you, knowing there&#39;s no door. Not even windows. You were alone until you heard that same voice again.<br />
<br />
&quot;[YFNH], I&#39;m glad you made it out!&quot; That deep voice... It&#39;s him again! Now that you have made it out, you think its best to understand who you are dealing with.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! It&#39;s you again! Who are you? Or what are you?&quot; You asked. As you now realized that you are still in your baby clothes, hopefully he&#39;ll give you some better clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, It is me... Allow me to reveal myself!&quot; And then, green energy started to manifest, and takes on a prominent shape. The silhouette tells you that this guy is either a viking warrior, or a Sumo Wrestler. And after it finally finishes the image with clarity, it turns out that...<br />
<br />
His face has a slight squinting eyes giving him an asian appearance, and yet got chubby cheeks with a thick dark reddish gray sideburns. And his red hair is tied in what you&#39;d assumed was a samurai hairstyle. He wears a thin necklace that holds a green coin, or rock.<br />
<br />
His body is a mix of both Fat, and Muscles. Despite his body having the flexibility, and strength to carry his own weight, he still has the appearance of an obese man with a giant firm belly. While his arms, and legs may look like flabby water pillows, but tucked inside are solid muscles. If he needed to, he will show it. It will make anybody think twice about underestimating him, base on him, and his fat belly.<br />
<br />
He is wearing minimal amount of body armor. Each piece of armor is silvery blue in color. He wears a chest, and shoulder plate. With arm bands, and white tape for his ankles. He also wears light brown sandals on his feet. With his belly unprotected, its like this is his traveling clothes. Surely, they&#39;d make armor that can cover their bellies right? That wouldn&#39;t be pragmatic. And lastly he wears a thick silky smooth leaf green Mawashi, with an unusual flap at the front, with the bottom going over the belt. He also wears a very thick white rope around wrapped his waist, and its tied in the back in loops. You vaguely remember seeing something like this.<br />
<br />
The Mystery Voice...<br />
<br />
Is a Fairy Sumo Wrestler!<br />
<br />
That&#39;s who helped you?! You look at your visitor with disdain, thinking to yourself. &#39;Great! Another Fat Fairy in a Diaper!&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Diaper?!&quot; He shouted. He caught you off guard. &quot;How dare you call my Mawashi a Diaper! You uncultured &#39;Gaijin&#39;!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry! I-&quot; Realizing your mistake! You tried to apologize before it&#39;s too late! You already made the mistake for a calling someone who they’re not. You don’t want to make another mistake like that. But then something just occur to you. &quot;Wait! You called me &#39;Outsider&#39;?&quot;<br />
<br />
You don&#39;t typically know of any other language besides English, but you somehow know the Japanese word he used means &#39;Outsider&#39;. &#39;How did I even know what that word means?!&#39; You think to yourself, again he didn&#39;t miss a beat.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know because, you, and I... Our souls are bounded together. So we share the same body, and mind... And to my embarrassment, you also share my ability to know Japanese. Of course, knowing, and speaking are two different things...&quot; He said. You&#39;re baffled now.<br />
<br />
&quot;But-... How would-... That isn&#39;t... You can hear my-...&quot; You try to think of a question to ask for once. And you shouted &quot;What do you mean our souls are bound?!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Sumo fairy shakes his head. &quot;Now, now, let us not get ahead of ourselves.&quot; He reveals to you on what&#39;s happening to your body. A portal of some kind shows you, getting up, and sleep walking, or rather sleep flying... You stare at him now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! What are you doing?!&quot; You shouted. He looks at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m doing you a favor, I almost lost my pride, and joy of my hard earn body because of a childs carelessness. I&#39;m not gonna let that go until I fix what&#39;s left of it.&quot; He said this as you in the portal, land on a different flower, and the buds closes around you. The flower was a blue, and green color. You never seen anything like it. You don&#39;t think that was even a natural flower.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do?&quot; And then, your clothes melted away. And in its place was a shiny gold gown covering your fat body. You would&#39;ve been so glad that you&#39;ve finally got out of that diaper. But your confused state made you look pass that. &quot;... What just happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m continuing the metamorphosis... You weren&#39;t supposed to bloom yet. So I&#39;m here to finish it for you.&quot; He answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;By controlling me?&quot; You said it with a dark tone. He raised a hand in admission.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, It&#39;s not fair on my end to do that. But I needed you to be dependable, and I needed you there. As of this moment you&#39;re in your chrysalis state. You were supposed to bloom a little bit later, but that didn&#39;t happened. We have to wait for two months for you to be completed. But don&#39;t worry [YFNH], for us it will only take hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know my name?... Oh! Right! Our souls attached. But can you at least tell me who you are?&quot; You ask. And he smirks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry [YFNH], but that&#39;s your first test... Figure out my name, and say it.&quot; He said. You were about to argue, but thought better of it. So while you both wait for your flower morphing to be done, and you figuring out what the Sumo Fairy&#39;s name is. He decided to start the topic of soul connecting.<br />
<br />
&quot;So a Fairy tricked you into being inside a flower?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...And?&quot; You say plainly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just want a confirmation, who was it that put you there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... Belle, I think her name was...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That girl has no clue what she&#39;d done... So has she showed you how fairies are made?&quot; He asked, and you answer saying. &quot;Well, yeah... I saw a demonstration with two fairies, and a flower giving them a child. But after that I was tricked, and been put inside a flower. Am I missing something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... But listen, [YFNH], I take it you&#39;ve understand the first part of the process. But what you don&#39;t know, is that to have a new fairy born, you need a Seed...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait you mean like... The &#39;Make-Love&#39; kind of seed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but it doesn&#39;t have to be just that, When a fairy dies they typically turn to dust, if they didn&#39;t do anything at all worth remembering. But when a special Fairy passes on, they become a Seed, for when a day comes when they needed the spirit of that Fairy again, they can fuse both the Seed, and the seed of a newly made family. It&#39;s sort of like reincarnation in a way. Of course, not only you can do that, but you can fuse the Seed with anything you wanted. That includes animals...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In this case... Me?&quot; You asked pointed at yourself. He nods. &quot;That means... You and I are a part of each other now. Our souls are connected forever.&quot; You&#39;re frowning at that. You may not able to be back to normal anytime soon. You just say. &quot;But I didn&#39;t ask for this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That makes two of us... I do not have full control when I&#39;m a Seed, if you ever die as a fairy, and you turn into a Seed yourself. Your soul will be trap in a Seed too! That will just be the inevitable end of your life. Being contained until the day you are called again... And then you see how your predecessor does in their time as you look on as a spirit. Or you have to mentor that new fairy, like I have to do now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there a way for me to be back to being human again?&quot; You ask with hope in your voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can only say in my lifetime... No... But with luck, there could be a chance... I just don&#39;t know the magic in this current lifetime... My condolences to you... But we are together, so we&#39;ll make the most of it as well... And that prophecy was almost ruin because of her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Prophecy?&quot; And you thought you heard everything. He continues. &quot;Yes, it is said &#39;That one day the Seed will be use again. And a fairy reborn will bring peace, and prosperity.&#39; But... That girl misused my Seed, and almost ruined me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It sounds like you don’t like what Belle did to us, well that makes two of us...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nevertheless, she&#39;s now tied to this prophecy, regardless on how she feels about it. You, and Belle&#39;s futures are destine to be.&quot; You are wide-eyed at the though of loving Belle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yuck! You mean we&#39;ll be in love?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not like that! It&#39;s not one those stories where the man gets the girl. Or in this case the girl gets the man... Anyway the point is that, your futures are gonna cross over one way or another.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what&#39;s next?&quot; You ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s next is you have to form a party, meaning found yourself a group to ward off any monsters that come by... Or, find my homeland, or another Sumo Fairy they&#39;ll help you understand what you needed to be. I was a Proud Warrior back in my day, if you do visit my homeland you’ll hear stories of my accomplishments, you could also figure out who I was, and what my name is… And remember, I&#39;ve giving you some good luck if you find a full-figured creature, or rather a creature with a sumo build, you will befriend them by chance-...&quot; He shows his green necklace, his ‘good luck charm’. But you’re not understanding all of this yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hang on! Sumo Fairy? Mind telling me what I am exactly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right! I didn&#39;t finish telling this didn&#39;t I? Well you&#39;re a race of Fey Creatures known as &#39;Rikishi Fey&#39; otherwised known as &#39;Sumo Fairy&#39;.&quot; Then, he creates a portal like visual, to show you all types of fairies. A lot of these are the type of fairies you&#39;d seen before, at least in books. But what surpised you is that there are fairies with no wings(like the earth base fairies) He continues &quot;Yes! there are different forms of Fairies... From fire, water, and earth. Oh! there’s also Arthropod Fey, the one you had escape from.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, the Mr. Caterpillar... Anything else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a last few thing... The world you&#39;re about to embark is filled with magic. You&#39;ll even meet those you humans consider; Mythical Creatures even dragons you&#39;d be lucky if you only encounter a baby dragon,...and Humanoid animal otherwise known as Anthro...&quot; While he was showing you the dragons, you seen what the baby dragons looked like. They are quadruped, meaning they walk on four legs. They remind you of a particular purple dragon in your human life, was it ‘Pyro’? No, no... It&#39;s-... That&#39;s weird? You can&#39;t even remember what the name of that dragon is anymore! Has becoming a fairy made you forget?<br />
<br />
And just then the flower started glowing. &quot;Oh, It&#39;s time! Here is your new body!&quot; With the energy ball going stright at you. You have morphed. You&#39;re regaining muscles you may have lost in the first metamorphosis, but now you&#39;ve have gotten a body that just feels right! &quot;So Mr [YSNH], how do you feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
As the change started, you feel your babyish fat melting away. Gaining your maturity back, if you’ve always been fat, you would’ve looked like your original self again. You have full control of your bodily functions like an adult. <br />
<br />
Meaning you gotten back what you lost from that first flower. It’s like you’re ’you’ again. However, you now have the Rikishi Fey energy. While you are no where near as big as the sumo in front of you. You still have a fat belly, with arm, and leg muscles to carry your own weight. Besides that, You are so elated!<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel! Great! Strong! Better! But why am I still fat?&quot; You look down, and noticed you still have a belly. You wonder if this is a part of you now?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I was able to get rid of all needless fat, but not the kind thats still useful. The flower even healed anything that’s hurting you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can fat be &#39;useful&#39;?&quot; You are wondering why he would say that?<br />
<br />
&quot;Know this [YFNH], You do have a choice to be the Sumo that pushes mountains with only his muscles, or be immovable with only his weight in mass... Sumo isn&#39;t only about fat. contrary on what you think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I guess I better get going.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One more thing!&quot; He reached out his right hand, and touch your temple. And you have gotten the basic knowledge on Sumo Wrestling, the culture, the tradition... Granted, like he said there is showing, and there is doing. And you still don&#39;t know how to wrestle.<br />
<br />
And just then you feel your clothes start to morph again! You have been given a Green cotton Mawashi with a triangle fold at the front. Although very thick, this is not a diaper at all! And as long as you still have full control the better!<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, But aren&#39;t Mawashi supposed to be made out of silk?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but you have a long way to go before you can have those type of clothes!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I really am such an amateur.&quot; You say defeated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Don&#39;t lose heart! you can still get through this. And remember! If you need my help, or you want to ask me something. Just meditate, and I will help you with anything that&#39;s troubling you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Meditate?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Basically you&#39;ll be sleeping with your mind opened. Are you ready to wake up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
You have woken up, with this feeling of amazement! No longer your body feels like a burden. Instead, You feel like you can move anything!... And you are immovable! You got up like you know how to pull your own weight, and saw that you have in fact... Been inside a flower. &quot;I can&#39;t believe that he was able to help me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then you looked at your ankle it’s not hurting anymore, and thought. &#39;I wonder if it really healed it?&#39;<br />
<br />
With your wings you’ve flown to the same hollow tree with the mirror. &#39;Wow! I really am strong!&#39; You land on your broken foot and... It&#39;s healed! That flower&#39;s magic not only improve your body, it also heals it! Then you took a look at the mirror while your at it.<br />
<br />
This is really a fitting outfit for you. A Green cotton Mawashi with a triangle fold at the front. A knife in a holder attached to your right thigh. A Blue vest with holes at the back for wings, and pockets, so you can put money, or magic items in there. You are equipped with white tape on your wrists, and feet like as if your wearing socks with your front foot exposed, you have sandals too. And lastly, you have a thin necklace that holds a green coin with a symbol or a character you don&#39;t know the meaning of yet. The coin is smaller than a typical medallion. Your ‘good luck charm’.<br />
<br />
Like he said, you&#39;re at level one. With more experience, you could end up like him. You never considered then, because you never wanted to be fat. But now, with what he said to you, this could be an adventure story you wanted to be in... &#39;At least it&#39;s not cliché!&#39;<br />
<br />

<br />
So after looking at yourself over, you decided to start moving. You exited the tree, and then you heard something!<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, I never thought I&#39;d see somebody like you here!&quot; You don&#39;t know who it was, so you whip your head around, and found the source of the voice...<br />
<br />
And it&#39;s from... <br />
Where?</p>
