<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Kara and Jeff were done with the toilet they both went outside the bathroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kara I&#39;ve got a big test today on geometry which means you are going to have to go to my school and do the test for me&quot; Said Jeff. Kara replied by saying this back to Jeff &quot;Alright I will take your test but you do realise I&#39;ve got a ballerina lesson in school today which means you will have to use a tampon to hide the blood from your vagina because the ballerina lesson is going to be a live performance in front of everyone&#39;s parents and our mum and dad are going to be watching you so you better not fuck it up Jeff&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff replied to Kara by saying this &quot;I&#39;ll try not to fuck up your reputation also just to let you know my best friend Cole is picking you up today because I arranged to be picked up by Cole yesterday at school but because I am now Kara you will have to be picked up by Cole because you are now me and I am now you&quot;<br />
<br />
Kara&#39;s phone went off so he picked up the call and the caller id said Cole.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye Jeff what&#39;s up man it&#39;s Cole&quot; shouted Cole into the phone Kara replied by saying this &quot;Hey Cole dude where are you are you almost at my house my little sister is just fucking bugging me as always&quot; Cole replied by saying this &quot;I know little sisters can be fucking annoying Jeff and yeah I&#39;m about fifteen minutes away from your house I&#39;m just stuck in some shitty traffic you know what I mean right?&quot; Kara replied by saying this &quot;Yeah I know what you mean traffic is just so stupid I mean I wish we had no traffic lights so we could just drive anywhere without stopping and getting stuck in traffic&quot; Cole replied by saying this &quot;You know what Jeff I&#39;m going to do something illegal and I&#39;m just going to drive and ignore the traffic lights because I don&#39;t give a fuck&quot; Kara replied by saying this &quot;Alright Cole I&#39;ll see you in a few minutes peace dude&quot; Cole replied by saying this &quot;Alright see yah in a bit Jeff&quot; Then Kara ended the call with Cole<br />
<br />
&quot;Who was on the phone with you?&quot; Questioned Jeff to Kara. Kara replied to Jeff&#39;s question by saying this &quot;Oh don&#39;t worry little sis it was just my best friend Cole telling me he is almost here to pick me up so its nothing for a little girl like you to worry about so you should go to your room and put your makeup on and get changed into your primary school uniform&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff went to her new room and she locked the door meanwhile Kara went to his new room and locked the door inside his room Kara was looking through the clothes in the closet to find his school uniform after 5 minutes of searching through the closet he found his school uniform. His school uniform contained a blue tie, red jumper, white shirt and black trousers and black socks and black shoes. <br />
<br />
After getting changed Kara opened up his phone and took a selife, he saw that he looked exactly like Jeff would look when he got changed into his school uniform. Kara was loving every moment of this body switch suddenly his phone went off so he awnsered it and it was Cole again<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff I&#39;m almost near you house so just make sure you are ready&quot; Said Cole and Kara replied by saying this &quot;Cole I&#39;m already ready just waiting for you to come here so I can get picked up and get that stupid fucking geometry test done&quot; Cole replied by saying this &quot;I know ri- Hold on Jeff someone&#39;s knocking on my window&quot; Kara replied by saying this &quot;Cole, Cole, Cole, Cole are you there&quot; There was no reply suddenly Kara heard a gunshot on the phone and then he heard Cole shout in pain and then he heard silence.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes of that spooky silence a voiced started talking by saying this &quot;Hello there Jeff! It&#39;s good to speak to you again and I&#39;m sorry that I just murdered Cole but that&#39;s because I want to kill all of your friends because of what you did to me&quot; Kara replied by saying this &quot;What did I do to you?&quot; The voice replied by saying this &quot;Don&#39;t play dumb Jeff you know what you did&quot; Kara replied by saying this &quot;Could you just remind me of what I have done to you&quot; The voice replied by saying this &quot;Jeff you kept me away from stalking your sister and dating her and now I&#39;m so fucking furious with you which is why I murdered Cole and I will keep murdering all of your friends until you let me have your sister&quot; Kara replied by saying this &quot;No way Kai your a pedophile&quot; The voice replied to Kara by saying this &quot;How do you know my name is Kai&quot; Kara replied by saying this &quot;Because my sister told me your name when you were harrasing her you little faggot&quot; Kai responded to Kara by saying this &quot;I am not gay so that means I&#39;m no faggot oh and also Jeff if you don&#39;t let me have your sister I will just kidnap that little bitch alright&quot; Kara replied to Kai by saying this &quot;Try and kidnap her I dare you&quot; Kai replied to Kara by saying this &quot;Alright Fucker I will&quot; then Kai ended the phone call.<br />
<br />
Kara was shocked that Kai was actually going to try and kidnap Jeff. Kara realised that Jeff should of probally not swapped bodies with her but there was no point now as Kara was now him and he was now her.<br />
<br />
Kara went back to his room and got his bag and headed out the door.<br />
<br />
Kara was a bit frightened about going to high school as he had never been to high school before and he also had a test on geometry and he did not even know what geometry was which made him scared as well because he may fail.<br />
<br />
After walking for which seemed ages Kara finally arrived at his new school and at the enterance was the one and only Kai.<br />
<br />
Kai walked over to Kara and shouted this to him &quot;Oi fucker how about we fight and if I win I&#39;m allowed to data your little sister Kara but Jeff if you win I will leave you and your little sister alone how does that sound&quot; Kara replied to Kai by saying this &quot;Sure thing Kai but when will we fight&quot; Kai replied by saying this <br />
&quot;Kara how about we have a fight right now outside the school enterance&quot; Kara replied by saying this to Kai &quot;Sure thing but you will be the one who will be defeated beacuse the bigger you are the harder you fall&quot; Kai replied by saying this &quot;That does not matter to me because you are so fucking weak Jeff&quot; Kara replied to Kai by saying this &quot;We will see Kai we will see&quot;</p>
