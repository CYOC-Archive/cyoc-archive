<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The witch was going around the woods gathering herbs and different mushrooms and plants. She was further away than she usually went, but she hadn&#39;t found enough mushrooms for what she had in mind. It was getting late and darkness was covering the woods. After walking for a while, she noticed a promising spot of fine berries which would end up very nicely in potions or herbal teas, she tried to get closer but unfortunately she stepped on an old tree root that broke and she fell several feet to the ground. Her ankle was severely hurt and she stood there all night asking for help.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes, two kids around 8 years old find her and she felt so glad that she can finally get some help. She introduced herself and asked for their help but the kids just laughed and mocked her. &quot;If you truly are a witch, why don&#39;t you use your magic powers to help yourself?&quot; One of the boys told her while they keep laughing at her. They started to hit her before they left still laughing and making jokes about her. &quot;What a moron lady, she thinks we&#39;re that stupid to believe she&#39;s a witch with magical power and stuff. She is a pain in the balls, that&#39;s what she is!!&quot; She heard them saying while they leave.<br />
<br />
The witch was completely angry, so much that she ignored her hurt ankle and stood up. She took a wand out from her garments and pointed at the boys. &quot;Maybe I am not very experienced with healing magic but I definitely knew a thing or two about punishing brat kids!&quot; A wave of golden dust came out from her wand and the kids who already were a few yards away from her immediately were warped back in front of her. The look on their faces suddenly changed from happy and mischievous to afraid and shaky. &quot;You won&#39;t leave until you get what you deserve!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please lady, let us go!!&quot; One of the boys pleaded while tears started to run down his cheeks. &quot;We&#39;re sorry!&quot; However they didn&#39;t know that the witch enjoyed to see some pain and desperation in her victims. So, this fun would be enough to forget about her ankle. She used her wand again to create a dusty whirlwind around the boys which began to undress them. Taking off their shirts, then their shoes, pants and socks and finally their underwear. Now they were completely naked and at the mercy of their captor. They felt ashamed of being nude in front of a woman but the magic prevent them of moving at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard you saying I&#39;m a pain in the balls and I was planning on giving you some real pain, but those balls of yours are so small that I doubt they can feel anything I do to them.&quot; The witch said while she stared at boys&#39; testicles who hadn&#39;t developed yet and we&#39;re still attached to their abdomen. &quot;Fortunately for me, I got a solution that made you&#39;ll enjoy or maybe not...&quot; She took some of the berries and mushrooms she collected and created a puree that she put on the boys&#39; mouths. &quot;You&#39;re the first ones to try my new formula for hyper testosterone that can put a smile on every man&#39;s face.&quot;<br />
<br />
Without any chance to avoid it, to boys swallowed the puree and immediately they felt some pain in their stomachs. The world around them started to spin and they can&#39;t realize what&#39;s going on except for the witch&#39;s endless wicked laughing. From her perspective, she can perfectly notice the boys were getting taller, their bones creaking and stretching while they turn older. Meat and muscle growing under their skins and hair sprouting out like crazy from their legs and arm. Now, they didn&#39;t look like 8 years old boys but 16 years old teenagers.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? What happened to us?&quot; One of the teenagers said before he stopped after realizing his voice got deeper. Their heads had stopped spinning and now they can see what had happened to them. The witch took her time to take a sit on a fallen tree trunk and let them explore their new bodies. They started to touch every crave and corner of their new physiques, the noticeable muscles in their arms and chest, the thickness in their legs. The new size of their hands and feet, and the hair that had grown all over there. They blushed a little when they noticed the dense bushes of hair in their armpit, and even more when they notice the ones on their crotches.<br />
<br />
While they looking at themselves, the witch can&#39;t take her eyes off their newly developed genitals. Those little nubs between their legs had gotten thicker and longer until they&#39;re healthy 6 inches long cocks. They&#39;re even swaying side to side now like pendulums. However, if we&#39;re talking about swaying, definitely, their balls would win in that category. 8 years of growing were enough to make their balls drop, swell and grow hair. They looked like golf balls inside a loose wrinkly sack covered with hair. Those balls were above average and they were just a glimpse of what&#39;s coming. It wasn&#39;t called hyper testosterone for nothing...</p>
