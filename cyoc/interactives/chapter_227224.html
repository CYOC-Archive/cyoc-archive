<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Transfo-Flu Sucked. <br />
<br />
That was about what Cody Malcolm could say about it. Sure he&#39;d been partying when most people said they were supposed to be keeping apart, to minimize spread. But how was he supposed to know that babe he fucked was actually turning into an animal? Cody just sat there in bed, naked, only able to wear certain elastic clothing that could handle his new equine attributes. Coach just about read him the riot act when he saw - and heard what circumstance led to this. <br />
<br />
The Transfo-Flu was some kind of strange &quot;Geneto-Disease&quot;, affecting someone as far down as their very genetic code. He didn&#39;t know the exact science behind it - he wasn&#39;t a <i>dork</i> - but Cody understood it as far as he saw it. He had been one of the most popular, promising athletes at his school - in the varsity team, even - but this threw a monkey wrench in everything. Cody stood easily six foot three inches tall, athletic and well muscled, and if anything it seemed like ever since he took ill this time his muscles were slightly more striated.<br />
<br />
His sandy blond hair seemed thicker than usual, though that might&#39;ve just been from him isolating. His bright blue eyes stared at the ceiling. Cody kicked over the edge of his bed. He could see his legs and feet - or what had once been his legs and feet. His legs had become more powerfully muscled still, and Cody had always been very keen on squats and deadlifts. What had been his feet were now a pair of hooves, broad and tough. And his legs were covered in thick, tan fur.<br />
<br />
The first time he saw dealt with his hooves, it had taken a while to get to walking right. As it was, he&#39;d learned to handle his new hooves, but he still had to be careful when walking around or going down stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck...and I can&#39;t even get any of my girlfriends over.&quot; Cody groaned. Which made it about a thousand times worse, because the &quot;Geneto-Illness&quot; also came with an exceedingly intense libido.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s because you&#39;re sick, young man. You&#39;re turning---turning into an animal. This is serious. My god. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m actually saying that. How crazy is this?&quot; There was his mom Lily standing by the door. She didn&#39;t even wanna come in and see him like this. And besides, she was still just trying to process the fact that this was actually happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just my legs and feet, mom...&quot; Cody replied. &quot;You don&#39;t have to worry, I can&#39;t give you the flu.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m worried because you&#39;re not taking this seriously, Cody. The world&#39;s in a crisis and your only worried about not getting laid?&quot; His mom audibly sighed, &quot;Just think of it as a delayed gratification thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then he heard her walking away from his door. Cody sighed, &quot;Easy for her to say...&quot; He grumbled and reached down to scratch at his thick furred leg. It felt kinda nice actually. But the whole thing was just bizarre...<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, I bet I&#39;d be even better at running down the field with these legs...&quot; Cody&#39;s eyes then traveled to his equine crotch. His dick was freaking <i>huge</i> now, and even if he wanted to get laid, his girlfriends might not be able to handle all of it. After all, it was straight up animalistic at this point. It was about the size of a soda bottle, he guessed and his balls were massive. A few times he&#39;d tried to tussle with himself to relieve his needs, only to be blown away by just how insistent the new configuration down there was.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could probably go on for like, hours with these things...&quot; He cupped his balls and grinned audaciously.<br />
<br />
Cody&#39;s fingers started to wander across the long shaft. &quot;Mnngh, this feels weird, even after a few tries, but...feels kinda good.&quot; Cody started rubbing his equine cock with his hands, watching with some degree of satisfaction as it erected - growing even bigger. He started to stroke himself off, his hips bucking forward into his hand. He found that it was quite sensitive, and as much as Cody tried he couldn&#39;t stop himself from making some noise whenever he tried out the new equipment.<br />
<br />
His usual grunts mixed with some soft whickering noises he barely even noticed.<br />
<br />
Huffing, Cody started stroking his cock with both hands - and was immediately astonished by the sheer sensitivity. The sheer intensity of such rapid touch made him groan, and the feeling was almost unbearable. He usually had much better stamina than this, and yet, he was now immediately wavering in front of a thunderous, awesome orgasm that dwarfed in intensity anything he had ever experienced.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh fuck yes...fuck man, this is something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmph!&quot; Cody&#39;s cock was throbbing, and he couldn&#39;t help but to start bucking his hips and rutting against his own hands. He&#39;d heard a couple people registered more intense sexual experiences, but holy shit this was something else. &quot;Mnnnh...nhhh!&quot; Cody&#39;s head pressed against his pillow and his jaw clenched tight. Fuck, this was gonna be an orgasm for the ages!<br />
<br />
&quot;HNGH!&quot; Cody&#39;s eyes rolled back and his legs tensed up as his cock tensed, quaked and exploded with orgasm, spewing its load over his body with an intensity unlike anything he had ever felt before. His balls pumped thick, creamy horse jizz right onto his chest and face - the smell and flavor making his head spin and his ass clench. His muscles flexed and his body quivered with the experience.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uck...fuck...&quot; Cody groaned as he ran his hands through the mess he made on his face and chest. Grabbing a towel by his bedside, he cleaned himself up - and quickly tossed the towel into his dirty clothes hamper. It fucking reeked!<br />
<br />
He did however note how the smell...the odd flavor...it made him feel weird. In a good way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ngh...guess I&#39;m just gonna have to do this until I can find a way to turn back to normal...&quot;<br />
<br />
Most people just waited till the disease ran its course. Usually that meant spending three days as an animal, and then reverting to human overnight. That was about the duration of the change once someone fully transformed. Always three days, and then an overnight change - usually while the person was sleeping. Cody&#39;s hooves clacking on the floor as he kicked his legs up and down, he thought about his fitness. For some reason if anything his muscles seemed even tighter since he got the Transfo-Flu - even as his diet had necessarily changed. <br />
<br />
And he was pretty sure he was faster too. Maybe he could turn this into an advantage... he hoped he could keep at least some of the physical benefits when he returned to his human form...<br />
<br />
The telltale sharp noise of his phone jarred Cody and made him look over at where his device rested, by his bedside mirror.<br />
<br />
Cody&#39;s phone was ringing, incessantly. He thought about just letting it ring, but a glance at the phone told him otherwise. It was his best friend Charlie&#39;s number!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Cody, you got it too, I heard.&quot;Charlie, who he&#39;d always worked out with, and gone to parties with, and gotten---gotten... Going by his terminology...<br />
<br />
&quot;What? You got it too?&quot; Cody asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, dude. I&#39;m like, turning into a pig, or a boar or something. I&#39;ve got these big tusks comin&#39; outta my jaw, and I got so fuckin&#39; hefty...&quot; Charlie groaned. Charlie sounded like he was having roughly the same kind of time Cody was having. So, Charlie had also been dealing with a bit of a weight increase with his particular animal change... <br />
<br />
&quot;Heavy huh? Maybe you&#39;re just getting fat, and not turning into a boar?&quot; Cody smirked as he teased his friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, fuck off, asshole.&quot; Charlie chuckled, &quot;I&#39;m going for a run, but I thought you&#39;d wanna know, we can hang out, and talk shit. After all, we both got the disease - and folks who got it can&#39;t pass it more between em.&quot; <br />
<br />
So Charlie wanted to go for a run up in the hills. Cody thought about it. It would certainly be better to get in some socialization. After all, just lying around in bed all day was doing nothing but driving Cody crazy. He needed to see his friend - to talk about their mutual affliction and see if they could find some way to mutually manage the symptoms and effects.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m down, sure.&quot; Cody responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome! I can&#39;t wait to tell you about Amber!&quot; Charlie sounded excited, audibly laughing over the other end.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Charlie said, &quot;She was the girl who passed it on to me. Somehow she was turning into a cat, I&#39;m turning into a boar. Make that make sense, I dare you. Anyway, she felt bad she gave into her heat so much, so she said she&#39;d stick around - even be my girlfriend, more or less.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The pig and the cat, what a relationship!&quot; Cody teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just come on over to the hills, bro,&quot; Charlie chuckled, &quot;My folks only let me hang out with other locals with the disease.&quot;</p>
