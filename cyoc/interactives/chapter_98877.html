<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The mountain lioness looked at her reflection in the stream, admiring her new impressive anthro form. She was so strong and sexy now. She couldn&#39;t wait to find some beast that she could mate with. She hoped they would be up the challenge. But then, the cougar remembered something. &quot;I need to get back to the den,&quot; she said before putting her hands to her mouth. Did she just speak like a human? Well, she was as smart as a human now and she looked half-human, why shouldn&#39;t she be able to speak? The sound of it simply startled her at first.<br />
<br />
The cougar hurried back to her den, noting with satisfaction that she was able to run just as fast on two legs as she could on four. Her den was a small rock cave in which she had raised many cubs and while her cubs have left quite some time ago, she wasn&#39;t the only occupant. Waiting at the entrance of the cave was a fox kit, its ears perked up and looking for any signs of trouble. The cougar had found the kit alone in a small hole. Its mother obviously wasn&#39;t coming back, whether it was because she had abandoned him or she had been killed by hunters. Most predators would have just ate the little fox, but the cougar, motivated perhaps by her maternal instincts, had not only spared the kit, but brought it back to her den. To be sure, the kit was terrified of her at first, but she was able to win it over with food, reassuring licks, and allowing it to lie by her. Looking at the fox now, the cougar was glad she had spared it. It was so darling that she wasn&#39;t sure she could have ever considered killing it. Not that it was going to keep her from hunting rabbits and such.<br />
<br />
The fox took one look at the approaching cougar and quickly dove back into the den. That wasn&#39;t a surprise, she looked a lot different from when she had left the den last. The cougar crouched down and said softly, &quot;Here, little foxy, I&#39;m not going to hurt you.&quot; The fox didn&#39;t seem likely to respond to that. Of course, he couldn&#39;t understand what she was saying now. The cougar then made low mewls and growls like she used to before she drank from the water. The fox poked his head out before cautiously approaching her. She held out her hand to the fox and he stepped gingerly near it before sniffing it. Even though she wasn&#39;t the same cougar as before, she still had her old scent. The fox soon nuzzled up to her, happy she was back. The cougar picked up the kit carefully and petted him. It was so strange to have arms like this, but this felt so right.<br />
<br />
But even if the fox kit accepted her, their relationship was still going to be awkward. While the cougar was still in touch with her instincts, they didn&#39;t rule her anymore and the fox was just a dumb animal to her. But there was a way to fix that. If the stream could change her into what she was now, it ought to be able to do the same thing to the fox. She stood up and carried the fox back the way she came. Quite soon, they were back at the stream. She approached the water and gently put the fox down in front of it. &quot;There you go, drink up,&quot; she said. The fox sniffed the water out of curiosity before he started lapping it up.<br />
<br />
The cougar waited until the kit had drank his fill. As soon as he had, he staggered and fell over. Apparently whatever was in the stream had a quicker effect on smaller animals. The kit whimpered as it started rapidly changing in shape. Its front legs developed into arms while its hind legs adjusted to do all the walking. The cougar noticed that the kit was also growing bigger. She though she remained more or less the same size when she changed, but she was a full-grown adult. The fox kit quivered until his changes stopped, leaving him about the size of a young boy. The fox shook all over and tried to stand up. The cougar helped him up and soon the fox was standing up and looking at his new anthro body. &quot;Wow, I&#39;m so big now,&quot; he said before jumping at the sound of his own voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re big for a fox, but not bigger than me,&quot; said the cougar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but now I can do stuff I couldn&#39;t do before,&quot; said the fox with excitement before running off. The cougar was about to call after him, but all he wanted to do was run around and play. The cougar just shrugged before lying down on a nice large rock. The kit had a lot of energy before he had been transformed and didn&#39;t seem to have changed. Eventually, the fox pup tired down and went back over to the cougar. He sat down beside her and panted from all his physical exertion. After a bit, he looked up at the cougar and asked, &quot;Can I have some milk?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would you want that?&quot; asked the cougar in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I remember when my real mama gave me milk and you look so big now. I&#39;m kinda curious,&quot; said the fox.<br />
<br />
The cougar thought it over. There didn&#39;t seem to be any reason why he shouldn&#39;t and she was already heavy with milk. It&#39;ll have to come out sooner or later, it may as well be put to use. &quot;Ok, you can have some of my milk,&quot; she said. The kit grinned widely before climbing up onto the rock besides the cougar. He soon fastened onto one of her breasts and started suckling. The cougar gave a soft moan at that. This felt even better than when she was feeling her nipples herself. She could feel the milk flowing out of her nipple and the fox&#39;s small mouth massaging it. The cougar just laid back and let the little fox do the work.<br />
<br />
After a while, she started to notice it was starting to get a little crowded on top of the rock. This was strange, she was pretty there was enough room on the rock for both of them. She looked down and gave a small gasp. The fox kit had grown while he was suckling. His small body had been gaining height and mass, looking less like a young boy than a boy in his early teens. The fox briefly looked up at her at the sound of her gasp. A different kind of gleam was in his eye now and his face didn&#39;t look so innocent now. Then he craned his head down and latched onto the cougar&#39;s other nipple. The cougar let out a moan at that. The fox was doing more than just suckling. He was nibbling and running his tongue around the aerola.<br />
<br />
The cougar stretched out over the rock though there was less room to stretch than there had before. She moaned as the fox continued to fondle her breasts, looking more to please her than just get milk from her. She stretched her arms over her head with a sigh of pleasure. She glanced at her arms and noticed something was off. A better look made her see that her arms had changed as well. They were thinner than she remembered, being closer to a slender feminine build. As she watched, the large muscles actually shrank before her eyes. In fact, she felt smaller all over, well, almost all over. Her breasts weren&#39;t changing size, but they seemed to be getting firmer. The cougar actually felt more energized than before and she was getting more turned on as she watched the fox get bigger.<br />
<br />
With a mischievous grin, she reached one hand down and felt between the fox&#39;s legs. The fox gave a gasp at that, his voice sounding deeper than before. The cougar grinned before rubbing more. She could feel a large pair of balls that were becoming quite a handful. Her hand moved up and she could feel something stuff and covered with fur. The fox gave a low moan, his deep voice a sharp contrast with the yips he let out earlier this morning. While the fox was distracted, the cougar slipped off of the rock, easily landing on her feet. When she got a better look at the fox, she was both surprised and pleased. He was certainly not a kit anymore. He was now fully grown into adulthood and standing at a more impressive height than she would have expected. His muscles were also very well-developed, his pectorals and abs easy to see even under his fur and his arms and legs were thick with muscles. His fox head seemed a little out of place between his wide shoulders, but she thought it suited him well. His sheath was quite noticeable now and it looked like he was just on the brink of letting his foxhood out.<br />
<br />
The cougar looked down at herself to see what changes had happened to her. To her slight disappointment, most of the muscles she had when she first transformed had greatly reduced. She wasn&#39;t unfit, her stomach rippling softly with the indication of her abs, but her muscles were no longer larger and boldly defined. Still, she had a very feminine figure with an impressive bust and rear that showed no signs of sagging. She actually felt more energized now than she had when she first transformed. Then she realized what had happened: not only had the fox somehow drained her musculature while he was drinking her milk, he had also drank away some of her age. By her best guess, both of them were now young adults or so.<br />
<br />
She looked back at the fox and could easily see that he was an impressive virile specimen. The lust she had felt earlier came racing back and she was overcome with the need to mate with this mighty beast. &quot;Looks like you&#39;re a little too big for milk now,&quot; she said, her voice sounding softer than before.<br />
<br />
The fox flexed one arm and said, &quot;Well, milk does help a growing body.&quot; His voice was deep, manly, and sent shivers down the cougar&#39;s spine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your body&#39;s grown all it&#39;s need to,&quot; said the cougar, &quot;Now you can do a lot of things you couldn&#39;t before.&quot; She lied down on the grass and spread out her legs, &quot;Such as help a young puma with a bad itch.&quot;<br />
<br />
The effect was not lost as the fox looked at the cougar&#39;s open vagina. His sheath pulled back as a large, thick foxhood sprang up. He grasped his member with one hand and moaned softly. With a sly look in his eye, he said, &quot;Well, how can I refuse someone who&#39;s done so much for me?&quot; He walked over to the cougar before lowering himself over her. The fox moved himself up and down until his pointed head was pressed between the cougar&#39;s lips. The fox waited a moment before he lowered himself, pushing deeper into the cougar.<br />
<br />
The cougar let out lustful moans as the fox began thrusting into her. She&#39;s been with many mates in her lifetime, but none of them had given her more pleasure than this big fox. In fact, this fox was bigger than them in several ways. She wasn&#39;t sure if she had grown shorter as well as less muscular, but the fox was now a head taller than her. And his foxhood, oh, those other mountain lions didn&#39;t fill her nearly as much as this vulpine beast. She squirmed as he plunged in deeper, getting more and more excited. The puma reached up and pinched her nipples wanting to get all the pleasure out of this as she could. The sight of this seemed to please the fox as he leaned down and ran his tongue over her fingers and the nipples they were rubbing.<br />
<br />
The cougar groaned loudly as she started thrusting against the fox. Their speed started to increase up to a fever pitch. The cougar could feel the pressure building up again and the fox seemed to be more rigid than before. A few seconds later, the two of them let out loud moans. The fox&#39;s member started pumping out large amounts of seed while the cougar&#39;s pussy was sucking in as much as it could take. The two of them were overwhelmed for a moment before the fox collapsed, though he tried to make his weight as less crushing as he could. The cougar panted as her heart rate went down. That was the best mating she ever had and who would have thought it&#39;d be with the fox kit she had spared just a few days ago. She looked up at her new mate and felt a new impulse come over to her. She grasped the fox&#39;s head with her hands before pulling him to her until their muzzles met. The fox was surprised when the cougar started kissing her, but he soon caught on and started kissing her back. The cougar continued to make out with the fox as his member slowly started to soften inside her. She may not be the muscular amazon she was before, but had gotten a fair amount of her youth back and this handsome, muscular, virile beast of a fox for a mate. Not a bad trade-off.</p>
