<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I nodded, eager to get some guidance on the matter. As we drove home, I thort this is all going to be new for me, as I am going to have to be the one to ask her out now im the boy? I never really thort i would fall for a girl when I well became a boy today, I thort I would still like boys, but I could not take my eye of her all day? And now thinking of her, I felt what eals I has been feeling all day, I could feel my new dick hard as a stick, so I picked up my bag of the floor of the car, and putting it on top of my lap to hide the bulg, from my mom. <br />
<br />
Once we arrived home, I quickly settled in front of are computer, pushing myself right in to the desk for the same reason for this bulge still pocking out of my lap, I just really wanting hid it, with mom sitting by my side. we searched for advice on asking someone out after a gender swap, hoping to find some insights into the appropriate timing. <br />
<br />
After scrolling through various forums and articles, we found a few common suggestions. It seemed that most people recommended waiting at least a few days before asking someone out after the swap. This grace period allowed everyone to adjust to their new identities and settle into their changed social dynamics. It also ensured that any initial attraction wasn&#39;t merely a result of novelty or curiosity. <br />
<br />
I took note of the advice and decided that I can wait 2 days, before asking her. I didn&#39;t want to rush into anything and risk making Trixie uncomfortable. I wanted are connection to develop naturally and feel real. If she was interested, I hoped she would give me some signs or indications along the way. <br />
<br />
By the time I thort that through, my little brother Sam, came running in through the front door, and gasped looking up at me, and said “wow, your... your like really big and a boy!” looking down at my 8 year old brother, I could not help but smile never seeing my brother looking at me with such wonder, and envy before. <br />
<br />
And he is right, this morning I was barly as high as him and mom was like half a head taller than me, and now I was like half a head taller than her, thinking of this made me feel more.. More like a Dude, I felt bigger, stronger and more in-charge of my life! <br />
<br />
But when I looked down at Sam again, he had that smile on his face, and I knew he was thinking of doing something! And I was right because he said “I am always jealous of my friends being able to fight with their brothers, but now, now I can!” and before I knew it, he jumped up on the sofa and, at me lunching his fall weight at me and nocking me to the ground and then started to hit me with a pillow from the sofa. <br />
<br />
Suprizingly it did not hut at all, and I felt some sort of, adrenaline going throw me, as I grad the pillow he was hitting my body with, and quickly rolled him off me, and started to playful hit him with it, and when he tried to get away from me, I grabbed him with my other hand, and holded him on his back, and pushed him onto the ground saying “no you don’t! And this is what you get for trying to trick your new older brother!”  <br />
<br />
And smiled, droped the pillow and moved my hands to his side and started to tikkal him, always wanting to do this to him, seeing dad do it to him all the time, but he always was to strong and fast for me, but now I was a guy, it seems like I am strong and big enough to do it now, and hearing him bursting in to laughter, made me feel, like I&#39;m in contral of him for once,  <br />
<br />
And thought of something embarrassing for him to do for me to stop, and said “say, im a little boy, who pees his bed, and I will stop” with him struggling to get away from me, with me now sitting on him and my hand holding him still while still tickling him, and hearing him trying to say “St... HAHAHAHA.. Sto.. HAHAHAHAHA Stop please Stop HAHAHA” and carried on and I said “that is not what I said for you to say?”  <br />
<br />
I tickled him for another 10 seconds with him saying “Stop” and doing everything in his power, to get away from me, an till he finly said “im... HAHAHAHA im a li... HAHAHA im a little boy, who.. HAHA, who pees his bed” I stopped straight away and got off him but stayed on the floor, smiling down at him, feeling a different bond with him, now being his older brother. <br />
<br />
I looke at Sam and he stay lying on the floor, getting his breath back but smiling, and he looked up at me from where he was , and said “you know I nearly actually peed my pants then?” and giggled a bit, and I could not help but laugh a bit, by who stupid he seems to be acting, with never seeing him like this with me before, with him normally trying to just annoy me, or us just screaming at each other, but this was nice, seeing him smiling up at me. <br />
<br />
And then he stood up and walked towrds me and said, “you realy are big, maybe your as tall as dad?” and surprisingly, he put his hands on my shoulders and crumpled on to my lap giving me a hug, saying “I much prefer you like this, I can sit on you lap and fight with you, and we can even hung out now. And you know you look a lot like dad now as well, what I like!” <br />
<br />
I did not realy now what to say, Sam has neve, never ever even tried to hug me, and now he was sitting on my lap giving me a hug? Maybe I remind him of dad? And dad has been gone for 2 weeks now, so my guess he probably does miss him, and that is why he is hugging me? <br />
<br />
Anyway I huged him back sand said “uhhm, thanks, Sam I guess, im glad you like me as your brother” but I kind of wanted him off me, not because I do not like him hugging me, I would let this hug go on for an hour, but there is two things, what making me want him to get off me? <br />
<br />
One, I have an “boner” is that what boys call it? And I kind of feel a little, unconfutable about Sam feeling it, with him right now, sitting on my legs, and not my lap. <br />
<br />
And two I have thought of a great way to see Trixie tomorrow, and needing to message her to set it up. <br />
<br />
So after like 2 minutes I leg go off Sam, with him literally resting on me like he would do to dad, when he got back from school, and I jointly pulled him off of me, on to the floor next to me, while saying “sorry Sam, but I kind of got some stuff to do, and maybe after I will play on your gaming thing, knowing boys are obsessed with such stuff, and you can teach me how to use it, ok?” <br />
<br />
Sam looked a little disappointed, and looked like he was about to fall asleep on me, when I pulled him off, but when I mentioned I will play with him later he shot right awake, say “yes, that will be so much fun!” <br />
<br />
I just said “ok, we will do it later, but I&#39;m off to my room for now, and you should get on with your homework? <br />
<br />
And with that, I got up and headed to my room, and when I got in there, seeing all of the pink and the makeup table and like 20 girl panty&#39;s and bras” all over the floor, I knew I would need to change my room completely, if I&#39;m going to be a boy, for a whole year, living as a boy from 13 to 14, and new that is where my plan comes in to place, in seeing Trixie tomorrow. <br />
<br />
But this boner will not go away, I know how boys get rid of them, and well I am curious to feel it and see it as well as my new self with nothing on? But I should message Trixie first, but what to do?</p>
