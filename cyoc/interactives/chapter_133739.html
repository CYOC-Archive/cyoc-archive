<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It took a bit of a while to bring the drug lord&#39;s menagerie to Animalia, including all the things that was confiscated from his house. Live animals did take a while to transport. But now that they were in Animalia, they would be given the chance to have a new life as Animalians. And those that didn&#39;t come here in mated pairs would probably not have long to wait. For instance, Louise had wanted to become a ribbon seal and when she heard that one of the animals being brought from Costa Rica included an adolescent ribbon seal and his parents, she put her claim on him. Her other friends will be converting soon, with Fran getting serious with Raj and Timothy finding a fire salamander with bright red spots.<br />
<br />
Julius was waiting for animals from the drug lord&#39;s menagerie. In particular, a pair of leucistic lionesses that currently had no mates. Julius could have picked which one of the lionesses he wanted to get his dosage from, but he wanted to have both. This wasn&#39;t particularly surprising for his friends. Julius was known for being quite a lady&#39;s man in his youth and lions were known for having quite a sexual appetite. In fact, everyone was expecting him to develop &quot;regressive hypersexuality&quot; like Shyra had. So they let him indulge him this time. He&#39;ll have to figure out later which of the two lionesses he wanted for his official mate.<br />
<br />
Julius was particularly eager to meet the lionesses. He hadn&#39;t had a good romp in years. Old age was robbing him of his potency. This wouldn&#39;t be his first threesome, but it would certainly be his most memorable. He even got to see the uplifting of the two lionesses. Watching them standing upright as their forelimbs became arms was interesting enough, but it was the development of their womanly hips and full breasts that really got his attention.<br />
<br />
Once the lionesses had been acclimated to their new bipedal bodies and informed they would be meeting someone who wanted to convert, Julius was sent over to the changing room where they were waiting. He was dress simply: button-up shirt, slacks, suspenders, a pair of penny loafers that he didn&#39;t mind getting destroyed. He smoothed his silvery beard, though he doubt it would make a lot of difference. He hoped these ladies would find him a lot more interesting as a lion.<br />
<br />
Julius had heard that white lions, such as these, weren&#39;t albinos and thus completely lacked pigmentation. Being leucistic meant they retained pigmentation in their skin and eyes. The two lionesses weren&#39;t completely white, but they were a lot paler than the lion Animalians he had seen earlier. One of them had near-white, cream-colored fur and her eyes were a blue-grey. The other one was closer to normal lions, being pale gold with golden eyes. Though Julius was a bit captivated with their round tits with erect nipples.<br />
<br />
&quot;You must be Senor Tire,&quot; said the pale gold one with a distinctive Latin American accent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yes,&quot; said Julius, &quot;You sound a lot more different than I imagined.&quot;<br />
<br />
The near-white one gave a contemptuous snort and said, &quot;We&#39;ve been the &#39;pets&#39; of a Costa Rican drug lord since we were taken from our mothers. What did you expect us to sound like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Er, sorry,&quot; said Julius, &quot;I&#39;ve just been imagining how this would play out for a while and I admit I didn&#39;t think of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how did you imagine this would go?&quot; asked the pale-gold one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I suppose I ought to know your names first,&quot; said Julius.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Blanca,&quot; said the near-white lioness.<br />
<br />
&quot;I should have expected that,&quot; said Julius dryly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m Candida,&quot; said the pale-gold lioness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Candida?&quot; asked Julius.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was considering &#39;Clara&#39;, but I&#39;m told the mayor has that name and I don&#39;t want to get mixed up. You could call me &#39;Candy&#39; for short,&quot; said Candida.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what was the next part of your fantasy?&quot; asked Blanca.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it would involve some kinky foreplay while I&#39;m still transforming, but, er...&quot; said Julius. He was embarrassed of how his stiffened member was already starting to droop. Erectile dysfunction could be a bit unpredictable and had been annoyingly barring his ability to enjoy sex for the last few years.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we can do the transformation before the sex,&quot; said Blanca. She picked up a glass of milk that was on the table. &quot;This has milk from both of us in it. That&#39;ll be enough for a double-dose, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That should be,&quot; said Julius as he took the glass. He didn&#39;t hesitate before drinking it down. Lion milk tasted differently from cow milk, not unpleasant, but not what he would want to put in his tea.<br />
<br />
Julius could feel his changes happening very quickly. Old bones were losing their fatigue as muscles regained strength and mass. His clothes were soon starting to strain against his growing body. But he didn&#39;t particularly care when his shirt started to rip at the sleeves. The buttons were pinging out as his chest started to barrel out, revealing the white fur that was growing over his skin. His suspenders soon snapped as they couldn&#39;t contain his broadening shoulders. His pants were already tearing apart as they became more like a lion&#39;s, his shoes soon bursting open to reveal paws.<br />
<br />
Blanca and Candida were getting more interested as Julius&#39;s leonine features became more prominent. Obviously, there was the white fur that was growing over his body. There was also the fact that his hands were gaining pads and claws. His hair was regaining its dark color as it grew out into a mane. His beard was going to the opposite end of the spectrum, turning white as it blended with the rest of the fur growing on Julius&#39;s face as it stretched out into a muzzle. The last change was a lion&#39;s tail growing out of his lower back, a dark tuft at its end.<br />
<br />
Blanca and Candida were very impressed with the lion man that Julius had become. His black mane and tail tuft stood out in sharp contrast with his white fur. There was also the fact that he was tall, muscular, and was radiating masculinity with intoxicating abundance. &quot;Now there&#39;s someone I can mate with,&quot; said Blanca with a sexy purr as she sauntered over to Julius.<br />
<br />
Julius was definitely feeling turned on by these lionesses and his rejuvenated member was ready for action, though painfully bound by his tight briefs. &quot;I hope I meet your expectations,&quot; he said, his voice deeper and melodious.<br />
<br />
Blanca extended the claws on one hand ripped the briefs still constraining Julius. His lionhood snapped out to greet her, long, relatively slim, but covered in nubs meant to tickle a lioness&#39;s insides. &quot;All that and more,&quot; said Blanca.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, save some of that for me,&quot; said Candida.<br />
<br />
Julius grinned smugly as he headed for the bed. &quot;Trust me. I&#39;ve enough to please both of you,&quot; he said. Grabbing Candida&#39;s hips, he aimed and thrust into her. Both of them moaned as he started plowing into her. Blanca headed back to the bed, wanting some of that action herself.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Lions are capable of mating for several hours, so it was quite some time before Julius, Bianca, and Candida were feeling satisfied. But afterwards, there were still things to do. As lions were the most social among big cats, part of that behavior was retained after uplifting. The lion pride in Animalia had to meet every new lion who joined, uplifted or converted. While territory instincts weren&#39;t so strong that two prides couldn&#39;t live in the same place, it was easier and simpler for the lions to join the same pride. The wolves had a somewhat similar structure, but the increasing number of wolves may require them to break up into smaller packs.<br />
<br />
Julius felt rather nervous as the trio approach the alpha lion&#39;s house. A lion such as himself was sure to be seen as a threat by the reigning king and not be welcomed. The fact that he and his lionesses were so pale made it seem likelier that they&#39;d be outcast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Try to relax,&quot; said Candida, &quot;You&#39;re radiating nervousness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt they&#39;re gonna be unfriendly,&quot; said Blanca.<br />
<br />
Julius took some deep breaths as he tried to lower his heart rate. He didn&#39;t want the other males picking it up and thinking he was weak. Ok, they&#39;d probably be more civilized, but Julius didn&#39;t want to look weak anyways.<br />
<br />
There were quite a few lions inside waiting for them. They didn&#39;t gather that often, mostly to greet new lions of Animalia. There were a couple of recognizable lions, such as Brandy who was with her husband, Jason. Zoe was also there, though she&#39;ll be heading on another trip to Maelewano soon. The pride&#39;s leaders were impossible to miss. Aslan had been the leader of the clan when they were normal lions in the Lyre zoo and he kept that leadership after their uplifting. It helped that he was one of the biggest cats in Animalia. His mate, Lucy, kept him in balance and reminded him of the sensitivity of others.<br />
<br />
Julius gulped a bit as he looked at the huge lion. &quot;Uh, good afternoon, King Aslan, sir,&quot; he said in a meeker voice than should be heard from a lion.<br />
<br />
Aslan waved a paw dismissively and said, &quot;Oh, no need to stand on ceremony. Just call me Aslan. I&#39;m not going to chop your head off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julius relaxed, but not a lot. &quot;Er, I hope you don&#39;t mind me and these lovely ladies moving into your territory,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it is getting a bit crowded,&quot; said Aslan, &quot;But I hear some of us are planning on moving to Maelewano.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I am as soon as I graduate,&quot; said Zoe, &quot;That place is the best. You guys should really see it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps someday,&quot; said Lucy, &quot;But for these three, I think they&#39;ll be a fine addition to our pride.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;ll certainly add more variety,&quot; agreed Aslan, &quot;What are you three planning on doing for a living.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was thinking about working at the Meat Market for a while,&quot; said Julius.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s original,&quot; said Lucy with a sarcastic roll of her eyes, &quot;I swear, every other person made young wants to work there. Why is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I already have a friend working there,&quot; said Julius.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s not my place to judge,&quot; said Lucy, &quot;So, which of these lionesses is going to be your mate? I can smell you on both of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure yet,&quot; said Julius, &quot;But we&#39;re not in a rush.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not,&quot; said Aslan, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind if we were still polygamous.&quot; Lucy elbowed him in the gut at that. &quot;But all the same, you have to pick one to keep.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;ll get around to that,&quot; said Bianca.<br />
<br />
&quot;Plenty of other lions to choose from,&quot; said Candida, eying the other lions there.</p>
