<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The doll had an appointment of her own, the Manufactory where dolls are created wanted her to come in for a routine checkup.<br />
<br />
The doll began the long walk to the Manufactory. Unlike the day when she reported first to her Mistress, today was cold and pouring rain. The synthetic leopard woman didn&#39;t mind, she walked along with the rain beading up and rolling off her glossy skin.<br />
<br />
Entering the building, a couple bounces on her paws shook loose the few remaining droplets. The exotic polymer of her exterior was hydrophobic, and repelled water.<br />
<br />
She checked in with the orange and white skunk doll at the front desk. &#39;It might be a few minutes, we have a potential new sister who is seeking last minute reassurances before dolling himself.&#39;<br />
<br />
The leopard smiled at this. &#39;Perhaps I could be of assistance?&#39;<br />
<br />
The skunk nodded, &#39;Perhaps, they are in conversation suite B.&#39;<br />
<br />
After a short walk, the doll opened the door marked Suite B. Inside at a small table are a familiar cartoonish pink feline doll and a young black man. <br />
<br />
The human was in his 20s, very short for a man, perhaps 5&#39;4&quot;. Clean shaven, he had dreads that hung loose and almost touched his shoulders. Tribal pattern tattoos sleeved both firearms.<br />
<br />
The leopard smiled. &#39;I&#39;m sorry to intrude, the receptionist mentioned you were experiencing some indecision and I wanted to help.&#39;<br />
<br />
The pink cat nodded. &#39;Donte has some last minute questions about life as a doll, and we were starting to talk it over.&#39;<br />
<br />
The young man spoke up. &#39;You don&#39;t need to make a sales pitch, I&#39;m doing this no matter what. I don&#39;t really have a choice.&#39;<br />
<br />
The leopard was put off by this last part. &#39;You always have a choice, even as a doll we have free will - we&#39;re just heavily predisposed to wanting to serve someone.&#39;<br />
<br />
The man laughed. &#39;That&#39;s not what I meant. This is the best future for me no matter what you tell me. I fell in with a bad crowd years ago, did some terrible things. I&#39;m a wanted man, looking at spending decades in jail.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Pinkie here told me that even though getting dolled doesn&#39;t get me off the hook for my crimes, this happened before and the new dolls usually end up serving either the prison doctor, one of the social workers, or therapists on staff. Happy, and an inmate in name only. That seems way better than what would happen to a little guy like me in there.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Pinkie keeps telling me all dolls have to be girls. I get I gotta get neutered since dolls don&#39;t do sex, at least not for themselves. But do I really have to be some girly piece of plastic with huge tits?&#39;<br />
<br />
The leopard laughed at this. &#39;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard this already but I&#39;ll confirm it. Yes, all dolls really must be based on a feminine template. Our need to serve, help, and nurture others is actually rooted in maternal instinct. The dolling process builds an exaggerated female identity to maximize this. A doll that didn&#39;t have a rather womanly body would have a bad case of gender dysphoria.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;When I designed this body, I put my tits down to the D cup minimum. I&#39;m really glad I couldn&#39;t go smaller, heck I&#39;m glad my build is so slender so they look bigger on me.&#39;<br />
<br />
Dante laughed at this, eyeing up the doll&#39;s chest with a twinkle of lust in his eye. &#39;I guess my other question is, are you still you? What&#39;s your name?&#39;<br />
<br />
The dolls were silent for a moment.<br />
<br />
&#39;My name was... is Anya. I just don&#39;t think of myself that way very much anymore, my identity is that I am Tatiana&#39;s doll. I guess I mostly define myself in the context of my Mistress.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;But I&#39;m still Anya, even if I don&#39;t use that name. I still have many of the same interests. I loved cooking as a human, and even though I can&#39;t eat anymore, my favorite part of every day is seeing my Mistress enjoy the food I have made. I still love dogs, and I wish Mistress would get one.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I guess you could say I&#39;m Anya, just stripped of all selfishness and my old inner demons. What I&#39;ve lost, even my human self would have admitted I&#39;m better off without.&#39;<br />
<br />
There was a long silence, after which Dante spoke. &#39;That&#39;s what I needed to hear. I&#39;m ready.&#39;<br />
<br />
He stood up. &#39;Any last advice?&#39;<br />
<br />
The doll that was Anya had some. &#39;When designing the new you, be bold. Be different. The early dolls couldn&#39;t customize themselves like we can now, and had to go with a simple cartoony look.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;And sister, don&#39;t be afraid to add some major curves, the new you will love&#39;em!&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;But there&#39;s one last thing I want to do for you. You should experience sexual pleasure one last time, and no one gives head like a doll.&#39;<br />
<br />
The leopard opened her mouth wide, and stuck her tongue out... and out... and out. She extended it down into the cleavage between her tits. She snapped it back in and grinned as she pulled down Donte&#39;s pants.<br />
<br />
The doll secreted a thin coat of oil along her tongue, and wrapped it around his erect cock like a snake. Her tongue could do things he never imagined. It rippled along it&#39;s length, pulsing and squeezing his manhood; vibrating and changing textures as it went. <br />
<br />
Her ears could hear his pulse, her senses aware as he rapidly reached the brink of orgasm. No human lover could ever be this good. She brought him to the edge, and then eased up slightly. Trying new moves and tricks, she kept him in torturous bliss for long minutes. <br />
<br />
She brought over the edge, Donte&#39;s last orgasm of his life put all of those before it to shame. His legs gave out and he fell heavily to the floor.<br />
The doll used her remarkable tongue to clean off the mess from her muzzle. Her body would gather up his seed and she would discretely spit it out later as she lacked a means to digest it.<br />
<br />
The young man stood again, rubbing his ass where he smacked it on the floor. &#39;Ow, I&#39;ll have a bruise there later.&#39;<br />
<br />
The two dolls smiled and said in unison &#39;No, you won&#39;t!&#39;.<br />
<br />
Remembering what he was about to do, the young man entered the conversion booth. &#39;See you on the other side.&#39; <br />
<br />
As the door closed behind him the pink doll moved to leave. &#39;You can greet our new sister when she emerges. Dante seemed to take a liking to you.&#39;<br />
<br />
Fifteen minutes later the conversion booth door opened again. <br />
<br />
Out stepped an amazonian rabbit, an inch or two over six feet. But where Anya had designed her doll self to be slender and willowy, Donte&#39;s new body was robust. Broad shoulders and thick arms gave the impression of physical power. Her breasts were huge, probably around HH - not that she&#39;d ever wear a bra - and gravity defying. Her waist did narrow above her wide hips, giving her a very feminine hourglass. While Anya had gone for a tight bubble butt, the rabbit&#39;s booty was absurdly ample and would do Sir Mix-a-lot proud. Very thick thighs continued the plump but powerful theme.<br />
<br />
From her smooth crotch, up over her massive nippleless breasts, and to her muzzle she was a warm cream color. Contrasting this, the rest of her skin was high gloss black. <br />
<br />
Her eyes, lips, and paw pads, were a bold deep purple. Most unusual for a doll, she had hair - or rather pencil thick strands of smooth rubber - in the same purple. It was parted in the center, and hung down to her chin, framing her face. Big floppy lop ear hung down, reaching mid back. The accent color showed up one more place, the tribal pattern firearm sleeve tattoos were still there, now a purple pattern on shining black polymer skin.<br />
<br />
The new synthetic rabbit girl bounded over on big paws at the end of her digitigrade legs.<br />
<br />
The two dolls embraced, needing no words to express their sisterly love.</p>
