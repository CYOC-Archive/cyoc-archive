<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James was altogether too used to seeing this sort of thing, having had The Maker for so long.  The two men kissing on the beach hadn't heard the three young men mocking them, and that was fortunate.  Ridicule was obviously something that James hadn't liked much in the past, but at least the three had shown some restraint.
<br />

<br />
	Instead of outright humiliating them, James would show them some restraint in the changes that he was planning.  He paused for a moment, looking at the changes he'd made on the palmtop, made a few corrections, and started the process.
<br />

<br />
***
<br />

<br />
	Sean looked away from the two men on the beach, and caught a glimpse of a young man glaring at him and his friends.  He blinked and his face flushed, embarrassed at having been caught making fun of people in a public place, then turned back to Rafael and Mike.
<br />

<br />
	 &quot;Guys, I think someone's watching us.  We should walk away from these guys,&quot; he said.
<br />

<br />
	Rafael and Mike looked over at the skater, and then turned their heads back to Sean.
<br />

<br />
	&quot;So what, dude?  He's a skater, he don't care,&quot; said Mike.
<br />

<br />
	&quot;Yeah, dude, he's like, just standing there anyway, so why do you care,&quot; Rafael asked.
<br />

<br />
	&quot;Whatever, guys, he doesn't look very happy.  We should go.&quot;
<br />

<br />
	Mike and Rafael shrugged their shoulders and started walking down the beach.  After taking a few steps, Sean realized that he had to go to the bathroom something fierce.  He told his friends as much and ran to the nearest restroom.
<br />

<br />
	He entered the public restroom and hurried toward the urinal.  The feeling of release from the sudden urge he'd had to pee was a huge relief, and he sighed loudly as his piss flowed into the porcelain.  It'd been a surprise that he'd had to go so quickly after arriving at the beach, since he'd done his business just before leaving his house, and it was a scant two miles away.
<br />

<br />
	When the last drop left him, he pulled his boxers and shorts back up over his package and started to head out of the bathroom.  As he was leaving, he checked himself in the mirror to make sure all was well before he left back into the sun.  Everything looked okay, he thought, but for some reason, his shorts didn't quite feel like they fit right.  He adjusted the waistband of his boxers, and repositioned his shorts, but they still felt a little funny, a little tight.
<br />

<br />
	Irritated that they didn't feel the way they should, and forgetting he was in a public restroom, Sean pulled down his board shorts, and looked down at his boxers, gasping at what he saw.  His blue and white boxers looked more like a pair of briefs with very loose legs.  As he stared, the leg holes tightened against him and pulled up until the sides were merely an inch wide at the hips, and the front was a small, tight pouch.  The fabric of the material changed from cotton, becoming smooth and stretchy until it was a shiny blend of nylon and spandex.
<br />

<br />
	Sean, embarrassed to think that he might be seen wearing a pair of speedos, reached down to grab his board shorts, but they disappeared just before he could touch them.  Blinking in surprise, he looked up into the mirror and saw his reflection.
<br />

<br />
	'I look ridiculous,' he thought, looking at himself with is long, gray, button up shirt, slightly covering the tops of his low-riding speedos.  He turned around, looked over his shoulder, and saw that the tight swimwear made his ass look smaller than it already was.
<br />

<br />
	'What am I going to do?  I can't go out there looking like this!'
<br />

<br />
	As if on queue, he felt another change begin.  His shirt, which had hung to cover the top of his speedos began to creep upward, and the fabric began to tighten on his chest and torso.  Sean quickly reached to unbutton his shirt to take it off, but couldn’t, as the shirt had changed to be more like a tee-shirt.  He could feel movement on his shoulders and arms, and looked down only to watch as the arms disappeared and the neck hole widened into a very tight fitting tank top.  Looking down again, he saw that his midriff was bare, and the shirt fit his body like a second skin.
<br />

<br />
	Before he could panic further about his clothing, he felt warmth radiating all about his skin.  The hairs on his body began to slowly pull themselves inward, disappearing from his arms and legs.  His eyes darted around his body, watching for other changes, and he saw a small, thin trail of hair grow down his navel, and into the top of his speedo, forming a hint of a treasure trail.  His chest remained smooth, but began to harden and push outward, forming into a pair of small, yet defined set of pecs.  His abs, too, hardened and pushed out, becoming slightly toned and visible.  He could feel the fabric of the speedos pulling outward and becoming even tighter as his small ass became more firm and grew into a pleasant bubble shape.
<br />

<br />
	Looking up into the mirror again, Sean saw that his fuzzy, close-cropped brown hair had grown a little on the front, and stuck straight up, the color changing to a light blond.  He felt a slight pulling sensation as his short goatee vanished from his face, leaving him looking clean-shaven.  A pinching at his ears and right eyebrow caused him to look and see two small, sliver hoops hanging from his earlobes, and a small blue ring with a silver ball poking from his eyebrow.  Finally, he saw his fairly pale skin darken slightly, showing a hint of a tan.
<br />

<br />
	Sean recoiled from the image before him in the mirror, and turned to run out of the bathroom, before catching himself, realizing that his friends would see him if he went outside.
<br />

<br />
	He still looked more or less like himself, with a few modifications, though now obviously had the appearance of a flaming gay surfer.  His friends would recognize him, and he didn't know what to do.
<br />

<br />
	That's when his mind changed.  He could feel a pulling in his head, and suddenly a snap.  Sean shook his head, feeling a bit groggy, and looked at himself in the mirror.  He hadn't seen it before, but noticed how handsome he looked.  He had the twink body he should have been working for, and loved the fact that he could get any guy he wanted.   He laughed at his thoughts from moments before, wondering why he'd ever be afraid to wear speedos, and couldn't imagine being straight.
<br />

<br />
	'As if,' he thought.
<br />

<br />
	He looked himself once over, and paused for a moment, seeming to remember a paler, less in shape surfer having been in here a minute ago.  Sean disregarded the thought as unpleasant, since the guy obviously wasn't interested in other guys, though he had been cute.
<br />

<br />
	With that, the newly made beach twink walked out of the bathroom, looking to catch up with his friends…</p>
