<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Say, you know what we should do?” asked Pam.<br />
<br />
“What?” asked Scott.<br />
<br />
“We should be tracking your changes,” answered Pam.  She had an eager smile on her face.  That same smile quickly appeared on the faces of Rachel and Joyce.<br />
<br />
I asked, “How do you mean ‘track?’”<br />
<br />
“Pictures, dummy,” she answered.  “You guys haven’t changed too much yet, so we should start taking pictures to show your changes.”<br />
<br />
Scott asked, “Why?”<br />
<br />
“Why not?” Pam retorted.<br />
<br />
“Are you afraid of having your picture taken, dear?” teased Joyce.  “It can be fun.”<br />
<br />
“I...I don’t know,” said Scott.  “Maybe.”  He shrugged his shoulders.  “Ah, screw it.  Fine, I’ll do it.”<br />
<br />
“Do you have any objections, Carl?” I asked him.  I assumed he would, for one reason or another.<br />
<br />
Carl sighed.  “I imagine that if I raised any objections these three would beat them out of me somehow,” he said.<br />
<br />
Pam clapped her hands excitedly.  “Oh, goodie, let’s do this.  Who has a camera?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“I have one on my phone,” said Scott.<br />
<br />
“Well, duh,” said Pam.  “We all do.  I mean an actual camera, so we get good pictures.”<br />
<br />
Rachel stood up.  “I have a pretty good one in my apartment,” she said.  She took a few steps toward the door and then stopped.  She looked back at me and said, “Can you come with me, Joe?”<br />
<br />
I immediately realized she was still hesitant to go back to her apartment.  I got up and said, “Sure.”  Fortunately none of the others made any remarks of any kind.  Carl probably had an idea of how her apartment looked.  I was just glad my siblings didn’t make any snide remarks.<br />
<br />
We closed the door to my apartment behind us when we got into the hallway.  Rachel slowly approached her apartment door and turned the doorknob just as slowly.  Since it was now dark she turned on the light and as I walked in behind her I saw what I feared.  “This is worse than I thought,” I said.  Furniture was overturned, some things were broken and there was evidence of general mayhem.<br />
<br />
“Yea,” was all Rachel could say.  “Just watch where you step.”<br />
<br />
I looked at the floor as I carefully took a few steps.  “Where is the camera?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“In my bedroom,” she answered.  I followed her path as she carefully navigated her way to her bedroom.  The scene in her bedroom was sadly similar to that in her living room.<br />
<br />
As I observed the disarray I said, “I’m not sure I could be so forgiving of him.”  I didn’t say his name because I felt I’d get too angry if I did.<br />
<br />
“I think maybe that’s why I didn’t want you to come in here yesterday,” she said.  She sat down on her bed next to where her night table stood.  She opened a drawer, rummaged through it and pulled out a camera.  I heard her turn it on as I continued to glance around the room.  “Good, it’s charged and I’ve got plenty of space,” she said.  She stood up and headed for the door.  I waited for her and followed behind her.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure you don’t want me to fix this?” I asked as we walked back through the living room.<br />
<br />
“For now, yes,” she said.  “In case the police come by for some reason.”<br />
<br />
I chuckled.  “Do you really think they will after all this?” I asked.<br />
<br />
She shrugged.  “I don’t care right now,” she said.  She stopped at the door and looked back into her apartment.  “I just...don’t want to look back after this.”  She turned off the light and quickly headed back across the hallway to my apartment.  Once we were back there, she said, “Got the camera!  Who’s going first?”<br />
<br />
Predictably, none of us spoke up.  “Oh, hell, I’ll go,” I said.  “How are we going to do this?”<br />
<br />
Joyce stood up and consulted with Rachel.  “First, take off your clothes,” said Joyce.  I raised my eyebrows at her.  “You can put them back on when we’re done...if you want.”  <br />
<br />
Rachel turned to Pam and asked, “Is this going to be weird for you?”<br />
<br />
“I...guess?” Pam answered with uncertainty.<br />
<br />
“What does it matter, really?” I asked as I took off my sweatshirt and undershirt.  <br />
<br />
“Right, what Joe said,” Pam quickly shot back.  “We’ll all have tits in a few hours and they’ll be without their precious manhoods.”<br />
<br />
All of us except for Carl found that amusing.  We all looked at him and he said, “Sorry, still getting used to this.  Maybe tomorrow I’ll find it funny.”<br />
<br />
“There’s hope for you yet,” said Pam while she raised her glass and took a drink.<br />
<br />
“I’ll drink to that,” he said and likewise took a drink.<br />
<br />
I finished undressing and said to Joyce and Rachel, “I’m at your mercy.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, goody,” said Rachel.  “This will be fun.”  She and Joyce took control.  Pam, meanwhile, got off the couch and stood behind them to observe.  They positioned me up against a bare spot on the wall.  They said it would make everything look obvious.  They proceeded to put in me in several different poses and snapped pictures of me from head to toe.  They took a few full body pictures and then took pictures of individual body parts.  I admit I felt really weird when they focused on my penis.  <br />
<br />
It took about ten minutes for them to get all the pictures they wanted.  Once they were done, I redressed.  I still wanted to observe the full effects of my wish for clothes to become obsolete in the way it had occurred so far.  I hoped that Scott and Carl would do the same.  I also wasn’t comfortable sitting naked in front of them right now.  Considering the wishes I had made, I certainly hoped that feeling would eventually go away. <br />
<br />
Scott and Carl obliged the girls as well.  They both appeared very reluctant and a bit more nervous than I was.  Even so, they went through with it.  As Carl finished putting his clothes back on, he asked, “How often are we going to do this?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, we’ll see,” said Rachel.  “Maybe once every hour or two.”<br />
<br />
It was only 8:00.  This could be a long night.</p>
