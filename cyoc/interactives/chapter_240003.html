<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Unconcerned with what he&#39;d done to his cousin, such notion of being so no more crossed his mind than it bothered him how much he was breaking the law by filching stuff off porches to sell. Had Damon given it any serious thought, he&#39;d been surprised to know, even though he had enough money to live comfortably for the rest of his life, he still engaged in the same profession which he had done so before he acquired the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
His mind instead on other matters, such as whether it&#39;d be his mother or his aunt who came home first, he did wonder briefly what either would say about Tanya, if anything at all, before he put the matter from his thoughts. Having prepared the programme on the laptop and set up the emitter, he turned his focus to the internet. Browsing various webpages, he scrolled through his favourite sites, all depicting images of female cats and animated cat-girls, with quite a few rather risqué. Thinking of when next he could become a cat again and go on the prowl, he cleared and closed the browser when he heard a door close somewhere in the apartment.<br />
<br />
Remote in hand, he left his room to see who&#39;d come home first. Fiddling with the remote, pretending he was working with it, trying to make it do something, he saw it was his Aunt June. Wondering how best to scan her without her realising it, Damon was caught off guard when she asked, &quot;Is Tanya home yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Of all the things she could&#39;ve asked him, this wasn&#39;t one he&#39;d considered she would. Wondering how it was she still remembered Tanya, he shrugged and commented, &quot;Don&#39;t know. If she isn&#39;t in her room, I guess she might be at a friend&#39;s place.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a sigh, his aunt muttered, &quot;She better have her homework done,&quot; as she took off her coat and hanging it over the back of the chair at the head of the table, she turned to head for the kitchen, and asked him, &quot;What are you working on now?&quot; as she headed for the attached room, where she began going through the cupboards.<br />
<br />
Another shrug and Damon replied, &quot;Just a project I&#39;ve been considering for a bit now,&quot; figuring it was best to hedge what he said.<br />
<br />
His aunt not saying, she instead pulled a large pot from a cupboard under the counter. Thinking this would be his best chance, Damon aimed the remote at his aunt and pressed the scan button. The device humming and vibrating, he soon found himself looking at his aunt&#39;s profile. Turning and heading back to his room, even as Aunt June called after him, &quot;Knock on Tanya&#39;s door and see if she&#39;s home yet,&quot; he didn&#39;t do as she requested, as he already knew she wasn&#39;t, nor would she ever.<br />
<br />
Back in his room, he plugged the emitter into the laptop. His aunt&#39;s profile popping up on the screen, Damon began to scroll through it. Not changing anything, he studied the readout, learning what he could about his mom’s sister. Seeing it still listed her as having one daughter, Damon was flummoxed as to why this was. Clicking and deleting the option, he shifted it so, instead of dying almost eight years ago, her husband, his Uncle Nelson, had left her. Seeing information on her likes, dislikes, hopes and dreams, he played with the options, and before too long, he had managed to alter her so she now ran a successful business selling various plants, as well as a pottery shop, which made a lot of the pots for her greenhouse.<br />
<br />
Satisfied with what he&#39;d done, he altered a few things more, including making the changes permanent and only he being aware of them. Saving the profile and sending it to the attached device, he ejected and unplugged the emitter. Exiting his room, Damon didn&#39;t even bother knocking on his cousin&#39;s door, but instead pushed open the bedroom door, clicked on the overhead light, and stepped in. Seeing the familiar room, decorated in shades of pink and purple, along with white, with everything looking exactly as it had before, he frowned. Wanting to know why this hadn&#39;t changed when he&#39;d altered his cousin, he turned away, turned off the light, and left the overly feminine-looking bedroom. Heading back to the dining room and kitchen, he stopped short of entering.<br />
<br />
In the kitchen section of the room, Aunt June was peering at a cookbook as she measured out things into a pot. Her attention focused on the meal she was preparing, Damon aimed the remote at her and pressed the button to initiate the changes.<br />
<br />
From where she stood, June breathed in the aroma of the meal she was preparing as she reached for a spice. Blinking, thinking the steam coming off the boiling water was getting to her, she shook her head as she felt a twinge of discomfort. This not helping in the least, she stopped what she was doing and placed her hands in a way which allowed her to grip the edge of the countertop. The twinge spiking to become a full-blown migraine, June gasped and almost dropped to the floor. Worried something was wrong, she might be having a stroke or something, she tried to call out to her cousin.<br />
<br />
Not liking the young man, as she thought him nothing more than a punk, a slacker, and a bit of bully, among other things, she couldn’t articulate a single thing as the pain in her head seized up her vocal cords, leaving her only to gasp and gurgle. Feeling as if someone was squeezing her brain, her skull, she was alarmed as memories of Nelson vanished and the man went from having died to having run out on her. Information fading as other bits of knowledge replaced it, she was confused when her mind went from insisting she had a daughter, age ten, to never having had a child, but always having wanted one. Struggling to make sense of this, even as she gained insight into owning and running two successful businesses, she was oblivious to how the apartment was rearranging to look as if there was only three people occupying it. Her transformation finishing, June gasped out a final time and after a minute or so, straightened up.<br />
<br />
Uncertain what had happened, the pain in her head diminishing as fast as it had appeared, she blinked as she stared at the recipe she&#39;d been preparing. Then, almost like a computer which experienced a hiccough in its programme, June reached for the spice she&#39;d been about to measure out. Forgetting everything which had just happened, she turned her focus entirely to the cookbook and resumed what she&#39;d been doing as if nothing out of the ordinary had transpired.<br />
<br />
From where he stood, Damon watched this. Unconcerned with any of the pain his aunt might be in, he waited to see what she&#39;d do once the change was complete. And when it was clear she wouldn&#39;t do anything except go back to preparing the meal she&#39;d been working on before he&#39;d used the Chronivac on her, he turned and headed back to his room. Stopping to peek in Tanya&#39;s room, he wasn&#39;t surprised to see it was now a home office, sewing, and storage room. Shutting the door, he returned to his room, where he plugged in the device. Sending his aunt&#39;s profile to the laptop, he proceeded to delete it, telling it before it vanished to keep the changes and not revert the subject back. Done, he prepared the programme for its next transformation as he heard from somewhere in the apartment the sound a door opening and closing. Knowing which door it was, Damon figured his mother was home, and ejecting the emitter, he went to see.</p>
