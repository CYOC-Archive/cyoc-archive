<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">you felt so alive to be a female while being in a body of an anthro raccoon that as you step out of the transformation booth with your belongings however, a different anthro steps out of the booth next to you. you figured that it was Lily dew to the belongings it had, but Lily was more of an anthro male raccoon like you. you stood up crossing your legs with your tail in between them, even if you were dressed up for you started to whimper while looking up at Lily that was transfixed on his own new cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m a guy?&quot; Lily asked while looking over at you with an expression of complete shock as you were looking down at his member, which thankfully was in a small brief of blue speedos that the thought of it being hung out of a sheath made you wish he wasn’t thinking with his dick right now. still, you gave Lily a slow nod as you whimpered timidly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I.... I’m a.....&quot; You begin to say as you whimper at the sound of your voice, but then Lily walks towards you. you wince and cry in fear as the larger, yet hansom raccoon man now towers over you that you only come up to his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey now, calm down now. everything&#39;s going to be ok. you have to be so afraid of me.&quot; Lily said as he then knelt down on one knee and wiped your tears away, hoping it would help on calming you down while gently holding you in his arms.<br />
<br />
You pause slowly as you were looking up at him that you later caught a glance down to see his cock bulge under his speedo retreating back into a sheath, but still noticeable. this kinda gave you some reassurance that you weren’t going to be raped. Lily then smiled down at you warmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;There we are. I know what animal you were going to pick out as I picked the same. please hear me out, you said you had a fascination with them back when you were a child as you also wanted to be a girl.&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;W...well, you look like me too...mostly, but your obviously bigger....so...&quot; you said as you paused to look up at him. then you take a deep breath to compose yourself.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can get around that.&quot; Lily said smiling, but later let go of you as he notices that you were feeling uncomfortable about this now. so he lend out his hand as you were hesitated to grab it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You uh....never said that you would be a guy.&quot; You said to him in a shy and timid way as you felt about this. Lily let out a small chuckle about this while trying not to be mean about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;true, I never said I would. come with me, and I will make you feel better.&quot; he said with an offer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Real funny. just because I&#39;m a girl now, doesn’t make me one to begin with.&quot; you whimpered as you then accepted his paw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, technically you are. so don’t take it as an insult if I call you a slut, bitch, or any female names for it comes with the trade mark.&quot; Lily said that you knew he was right as you let out a small sigh and nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you so....happy about this?&quot; you asked while hearing Lily laughed. Lily smiled at you as his tail was wagging for it showed him to be too excited.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I kind of wanted to know what it felt like, but at the same time that I didn’t really expected this. so, you know why I also chose this.&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...um....okay.&quot; You said running your hand/paw along your arm as it felt just how soft your fur was. It was then Lily swept you off your feet in the most literal fashion. he brought you into his strong, masculine arms as he was carrying you in a bridal fashion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! Lily, what the hell are you doing?!&quot; You Barked at him for doing it, but then covered your mouth as you blushed at the sound of your startled raccoon sound you shortly made.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don’t worry, I&#39;ll carry you for a bit right now until I get tired. It&#39;ll be quicker this way that I even promise as i&#39;ll everything I can to help you get used to your body your in. So please, just try to relax for now as i&#39;ll take care of everything.&quot; he said as Lily then smiled down at you that he then laughed up a bit.<br />
<br />
he then nuzzles your cheek while your face flushed even harder now, but you soon after didn&#39;t care about it. as you both walked down the trail that Lily smiled. you couldn&#39;t help it, but you felt snug in his arms as he was somehow giving you comfort that you felt like you were having feelings for him while being protected by him.<br />
<br />
After a while of walking down the trail that you soon both arrived at the resort, as it was mentioned before. It was populated by a bunch of other anthros that Lily gently set you down on the ground and allowed you to walk inside together. The two of you entered as you were greeted by an anthro hyena girl at the desk for she looked at the two of you with a lovely smile on her face that you both could see her fangs from where your standing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the island resort. I see you both turned out nicely as raccoons.&quot; The hyena said while smiling that her tail was wagging too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...how did you know that we were coming?&quot; You asked with a slight whimper to your voice. hiding a little bit behind Lily as he to wanted to know that the hyena then chuckled a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;why, The computer of course. you know, when you chose your new forms?&quot; she passed to say as the two of you looked at each other in confusion and surprisement while she was peering at the screen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways, according to the system of ours that partners of the resort have to share rooms. here&#39;s your keys, as we hope you enjoy your stay here. keep in mind that Your transformations are temporary until you leave for you&#39;ll have unlimited services for as long you stay here as our guest.&quot; she said while handing both of you two cards.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, okay. so, um, what exactly can we do here?&quot; Lily responded as he nodded to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;uh, well, we do have a lovely pool close by for both aquatic and  for land guests that we also have them open 24/7 hours a day. we also have a shop that sells souvenirs, fur-friendly clothing, even cosmetics if you want to wear those type of things that they’re optional of course. There’s a world class spa to relax in that we even have a gym for physical fitness. there&#39;s our local diner stand, which isn’t too far south of the resort as it&#39;s called The Animal Pit.&quot; she said as Lily got the idea of what we could do here.<br />
<br />
&quot;so, basically we can do almost anything we want to here? anything at all?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;pretty much that to top everything off, we also have a beach as it&#39;s always open for residents. even if you&#39;re in a romantic relationship with somebody. if you want to remain here and stay, then please talk to our boss management for he&#39;s the only one who can make things permanent for you. we have an event going on right now between two fur groups in a war.&quot; she said as the hyena again smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;come by and talk to me whenever you ready to leave.&quot; she said. Lily then turns and looks at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we&#39;re here. what should we do now?&quot; Lily asked as you soon decided what you wanted to do and told him first.</p>
