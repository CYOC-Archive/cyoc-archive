<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a while of thorough thought you decided to choose a creature that seemed similar to a bunny. the creature had thick legs and quite long ears which bendt over in a sad fashion, It seemed to have two pairs of eyes while the muzzle appared to be quite long. looking at one of the creatures paws you see that it was quite big, almost like a bigfoot. It&#39;s arms were like a human with 5 &#39;fingers&#39;. Each with a stubby claw, you guessed it was blunt for digging maybe? The creature had fur too, just like it&#39;s bunny counterpart, the fur seemed to be a bit thick (but you can&#39;t really tell how thick fur is when its freely floating around) but it wasn&#39;t part of your worries.<br />
<br />
Unlike bunnies, this creature appeared to have two wings 1/3 the size you guessed was needed for something its size to fly. Although it might have been incredibly light or strong. Also unlike bunnies, you noticed it had to be at least 3 times the size of a fullgrown adult! &#39;jeez&#39; you thought. but the size might not be something i&#39;ll get for being a half human. You thought back on some of the possibilities though, and you wondered how you&#39;d look like but a cold shiver quickly causes you to snap back to reality. You stand steadfast by your choice.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;Iiiiiii choose that one.&#39;&#39; you point at the bunny-like creature. you expected an immediate answer from lisa but when it didn&#39;t come you looked back at Lisa who, to your surprise, looked quite surprised with open mouth. &#39;&#39;uuuh. Lisa?&#39;&#39; you ask her to attempt to break her surprised daze. Lisa snaps out of her momentary daze upon hearing you and releases an excited giggle. &#39;&#39;ooooh, you choose the Daryc-Harion? I&#39;ve heard they look very cute! Not that i have seen a half Daryc-Harion myself.&#39;&#39; Lisa excitedly says.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;o-ok then?&#39;&#39; you reply . &#39;&#39;shall i just enter the pod then?&#39;&#39; you ask. Lisa just nods to you with a big smile on her face and rushes off to the console, presses a few buttons then gives you a thumbs up. guessing she wants you to enter the pod now, you walk into the pod. once inside of it, the cylinder closed up, looking back you noticed that the entrance was unnoticeable as the entire cylinder wall appeared flush and without a scratch. you look around inside of the chamber, the floor appeared to be plain white with a thick gray metal ring inbuilt to the floor.<br />
The cold floor inside the pod sent shivers up your spine as your naked form appeared trapped within. after a little while you began hearing a sort of mechanical noise, then two half circles with light blue lights popped down into view from the pods ceiling. the two half circles then projected a sort of light blue net. not knowing what you should call them you thought back to some of the sci-fi movies you watched back on Earth. when the two half circled contraptions began moving to the bottom of the pod you finally guessed they were a sort of scanner. Not paying too much mind to the scanners, you tried to recall some of your more comforting memories.<br />
<br />
when the scanners had finished &#39;scanning&#39; you, you heard a new mechanical sound. this time it was more akin to the movement of robotic joints. you then felt something securing your feet to the floor of the pod, looking down you see a pair of what seemed to be robotic shackles with what looked to be a quite sharp needle. you get a bit nervous, another pair of robotic shackles come into view as they seem to be going for your wrists. the robotic shackles latch onto your wrists tight and securely. You try moving your arm but the robotic wrist shackles refuse to budge an inch. <br />
<br />
You look up to see another pair of robotic shackles, but this time they weren&#39;t really shackles. one of them was just an odd breathing mask while the one going for the back of your head just seemed to be meant for securing the breathing mask. you didn&#39;t really care much about them, so you just let them secure themselves to your head. A question popped up into your head. &#39;what was the breathing mask for? Am i going to need to breathe another gass?&#39; your question would soon be answered visually as you felt the pod descending.<br />
<br />
A mechanical click and the feeling of liquid touching your naked body, indicated that you were going to be submerged in some sort of strange feeling liquid. the rising liquid felt cold to your smooth skin and it sent shivers up your spines. when the liquid reached your breasts you felt them tingling and it too sent shivers up and down your spine. you squint your eyes as the liquid reached your eyes but when it rose above them, you opened up only to see that the liquid seemed to be completely see-through and didn&#39;t cause any harm.<br />
<br />
now that you were fully submerged in the strange fluid, you felt something sting you where the shackles were. Then without warning, a sharp pain shot through your body as the sharp needles in the robotic shackles were thrust straight into your flesh and bone. you felt something like a strange tingle where you had just been litterally penetrated, and soon you felt all drowsy and sleepy. struggling in futility to stay awake, you manage to notice your chest shrinking before you lost consiousness.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Your entire body felt weird and odd. you heard mechanical humming much louder than before. you managed to notice that all the robotic shackles except for the one securing the breathing mask to your face, were gone. but oddly enough you felt as though you were almost floating. It took a while before you managed to regain your senses, when you did you felt that you had what seemed like two odd appendages on your back and on top of your head. you opened your eyes. everything was fuzzy, you couldn&#39;t manage to focus enough as you felt as though you were having a massive headache. realising the current futility at hand, you closed your eyes again.<br />
<br />
after a little while you noticed that your &#39;feet&#39; was touching the bottom of the pod, and then you noticed that you were being pulled up, almost like an elevator. then you felt the waterlevel dropping. when the pod stopped, you heard a quite loud click as the grates allowing the liquid in, closed. Oddly enough you didn&#39;t feel wet at all. then the two remaining robotic shackles released their hold on you, allowing you to drop to the floor and hit your head on the floor.<br />
<br />
the feeling of the cold metal floor caused you to reawaken in a daze. you crept your shaky hand over to rub your head. Upon rubbing, you felt something. your ears were now long and thick bunny ears, and they were now on top of your head. wondering if you&#39;ve recieved a muzzle you feel after your nose, a small muzzle, certainly not as large as the muzzle of a full Daryc-Harion, but still, a muzzle. you drowsily open your eyes and immediately notice that you&#39;ve gotten much sharper eyesight, although everything was still a wee bit fuzzy. <br />
<br />
You decide to inspect your new body with your eyes now. Looking at your hands, you seemed to have dark-blue fur and looking at your belly, gray fur covered your underneath in a sort of stripe. Speaking of your belly, you almost didn&#39;t notice but for some reason, you didn&#39;t have the female trademark breasts. where you male now? Or does this species just not have female boobs? regardless you decided to ignore it and carry on with your exploration. your legs were now thick and furred, but they didn&#39;t feel too wierd, instead they felt very strong and you felt like they weren&#39;t hindering at all.<br />
<br />
Your feet were thick with pads underneath like most animals. The surface area had to be as large as snow shoes or more from just looking at it. your hands were almost entirely with animal-like paws with small stubby digging claws. the rest of your body had changed to some  little degree but its too much to bother with. oh. not to mention you also got a small puff of fur where your tailbone is. in some way you could say that you looked like a short anthropomorphic bunny that was also quite cute to some regards.<br />
<br />
You work your way up to standing properly. Upon exiting the cylinder, it seals back up and lowers back down into the floor. with confidence you ignore the disappeared cylinder and instead consentrate on walking properly. slowly but surely, you regain balance and you can self assuredly hop and sprint around the place. The sound of an opening mechanical door and a wheeze of excitement, announces that Lisa has returned. Upon turning around to face hear, you are immediately picked up and hugged. You then notice how easily lisa picked you up, almost as if you didn&#39;t have any weight at all.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;Soooo, cuuuute!&#39;&#39; Lisa excitedly giggles. &#39;&#39;and soooooo comfy!&#39;&#39; Lisa remarks as she hugs you like how a child would hug their favourite teddybear. (or something like that.) You don&#39;t mind being hugged, somehow it makes you feel relaxed, but you reckon Lisa might be hugging you a bit, too hard. &#39;&#39;Uh. Lisa? Might you not crush me?&#39;&#39; you say to Lisa who loosens her grip on you. &#39;&#39;Sorry my little Daryc-Harion! You were just so fluffy i couldn&#39;t contain my cuteness emotions!&#39;&#39; Lisa spews out appolagently. &#39;cuteness emotions? what&#39;d she mean by that?&#39; you wondered.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless she dropped you onto the floor after a while of cuddling. &#39;&#39;so. what now?&#39;&#39; you ask Lisa. &#39;&#39;Now.&#39;&#39; she replies.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;we...&#39;&#39;</p>
