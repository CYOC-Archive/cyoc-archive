<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harry ended up following his father home and the two parked side by side on the driveway at the Jenkins home. The night sky had come out with stars twinkling down on them, though it obviously wasn&#39;t too late. A part of him really wanted to be with Jenny, to give her comfort and love and everything else she needed, but there was another part of him that was very curious over what his father had said when he appeared at center where the Skulk held its meetings. That Huck was &quot;home&quot; and wanted to see him and that there were other things that were to be shared. On some level it struck Harry as a bachelor party, but Huck was still recovering from a gunshot wound and Harry had never heard of such parties being held at home. Plus the fact that his bond really wouldn&#39;t allow for any attention to be given to anyone but Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how&#39;d your meeting go?&quot; Henry Jenkins asked to him as Harry came around his father&#39;s car.<br />
<br />
&quot;It went fairly well,&quot; Harry answered, &quot;I can&#39;t say anything about the planned games for Halloween... but I can say that everyone voiced support for Jenny with regards to the wedding tomorrow. Professor Anderson and his wife were especially supportive. I&#39;d think that if things go bad with her family... I&#39;d think that between you, mom, and the Andersons... Jenny will have a family to support her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about you?&quot; Henry asked to his son.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d be her husband, I can&#39;t be &quot;family,&quot; if you know what I mean,&quot; Harry gave a small chuckle to which his father nodded and smiled.<br />
<br />
They made their way in and made their way into the main living room, where Harry found that the couch had been set up to function as a fold out bed. The couch&#39;s main cushions were presently leaning against the wall on the far side of the couch with a large white blanket there and covering up Huck&#39;s legs. Huck was there in his weredog form and was presently sitting up on the fold out couch/bed with his back resting against the back of the couch, and he did look a lot stronger than he did the other day in the hospital. Sitting beside him in a set of red and black flannel pajamas was Betty as she was offering Huck snacks. Harry also noted that Huck seemed happy to have the attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have returned with the hero of the hour!&quot; Henry gave a pleasant announcement as they came into the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, I&#39;m no hero,&quot; Harry said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it is your wedding, baby brother,&quot; Huck gave a smile as he looked up at Henry&#39;s announcement, &quot;and you&#39;ve done quite well in finding that happiness in your life. Everyone is happy for you in that regard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It would seem that you&#39;re not too far behind,&quot; Harry commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks to being too blind to see past my own muzzle,&quot; Huck glanced over to Betty, who was still sitting close to Huck, &quot;and not knowing that you saw me as more than a friend...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Better late than never,&quot; Betty said to him, &quot;and even if you fell in love with someone else... I&#39;d always want to at least be your friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And now both of you have bright and happy futures,&quot; Henry gave a smile as Lisa came out of the kitchen carrying a few mugs of what smelled to Harry like decaff coffee.<br />
<br />
Harry calmly took the mug from his mother and moved to sit on a part of the couch that was open and close enough to Huck that they could shake hands if they wanted to. He made sure that his grey fox&#39;s tail was out of Huck&#39;s way. Lisa offered a mug to Betty and then to Huck before moving back into the kitchen. Harry sipped the decaff coffee while his father moved to sit in one chair and waited for Lisa to return with another two mugs of decaff coffee. It appeared as though she&#39;d been readying all this for this supposed talk/party. Harry noted that everyone looked rather pleasant and even happy, though Betty seemed more focused on Huck than anything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I am proud of you both,&quot; Henry said to both Harry and Huck, &quot;you&#39;ve both done well here in Moon Lake and have followed the same principles that your mother and I taught to both of you growing up. That gives both your mother and I a great deal of pride, as it lets us feel confident that you will treat your respective loves right...&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry smiled as he thought of Jenny and Huck held Betty&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve seen you happy and in love,&quot; Lisa said to Harry, &quot;and that will go a long way. It makes us happy to see you happy and happy with such a nice girl like Jenny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, mom,&quot; Harry answered, &quot;Jenny feels the same about you and dad... feels glad that you&#39;ve both so friendly to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry noted that both his parents smiled and nodded, before pausing to take a drink from their decaff coffee. Things then continued to move along with the sort of impromptu party and likely advice session. Harry kept his focus on his father, who picked up from Lisa with his next comment.<br />
<br />
&quot;And to keep that love, son, remember that the thing you&#39;ll need to remember is compromise,&quot; Henry spoke, &quot;compromise will get you through just about anything...&quot; Henry then paused and turned his glance over to his older son, &quot;and that will go for you too, Huck. Compromise will go a long way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we are both happy for you, Harry,&quot; Lisa spoke, &quot;and hopefully, you and Jenny both have long and happy lives together with as big of a family that you can support.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that goes for me, too,&quot; Huck said to Harry, &quot;The doctors may be wanting me to take it easy, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not glad to see you happy. I am greatly happy for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, mom, dad, Huck,&quot; Harry gave a smile, &quot;I know that Jenny will want a family... though at the moment, I think that will likely wait as she wants to at least provide an option for her younger siblings to get out of a bad situation that her parents and likely her father will put them in... as her older brother isn&#39;t going to be close enough to protect them... or at least that&#39;s what Jenny&#39;s told me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we can help where we can,&quot; Henry spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rescuing her younger siblings?&quot; Huck asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, a younger brother and younger sister,&quot; Harry nodded, &quot;in theory when you&#39;re better and our apartment is done... they can be moved into mine and your old rooms... so that isn&#39;t a problem. It&#39;s just something that Jenny feels needs to be done. She&#39;s told me that her parents and particularly her father have been that way with all of the Harper children. Her older brother tried to be a shield when and where he could... and Jenny chose to leave. But... even if her parents accept that they can&#39;t change her...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They might take it out on her younger siblings!?&quot; Betty finished in horror, &quot;I mean... that... there are weres here that well more than a hundred and that&#39;d be...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wrong even when they were children?&quot; Harry nodded, &quot;Yes. And that&#39;s Jenny&#39;s concern. Her older brother is in theory capable of making his own decisions and from what Jenny&#39;s told me has his own job lined up already. In that... he should be fine... but he wouldn&#39;t be able to protect the younger siblings. It&#39;s why Jenny wants to rescue her younger siblings. In a way... it&#39;d probably help her family. As if her parents are ultimately so obsessed with money...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, but that doesn&#39;t make their position right or a good one,&quot; Lisa said with a somewhat sour face, which she then shook free, &quot;but let&#39;s not dwell on that. That will depend on how things go at the wedding. And for the moment, let us focus on cheer that the wedding will bring.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry noted the nods from the others. In that there was agreement, which made him feel good. They supported Jenny, and that had his support. He couldn&#39;t help but wag his tail a bit. Huck watched and smiled as well, as he was quite happy about his brother having found someone. He glanced over to Betty and was glad to have her as well. She&#39;d always been a good friend and they&#39;d shared interests, and while it may have taken a gunshot wound to reveal it, Huck felt he&#39;d get the same happy future with Betty that Harry had with Jenny. They&#39;d obviously have to wait until he&#39;d fully recovered and at least until after Harry and Jenny were married, but with the recognition that Betty had loved him since high school now in the open, Huck figured both of them could wait a little longer. That way they wouldn&#39;t be in the way of Harry and Jenny&#39;s happiness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... congratulations, Harry,&quot; Huck said to his brother, &quot;be happy with Jenny and don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m sure everything will turn out fine in the end.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Harry nodded, &quot;I&#39;m sure things will turn out well... the Skulk and the police and even some volunteers will be making sure there will be no fighting at the wedding itself. All the rest... is really up to Jenny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... hopefully she&#39;s ready,&quot; Huck commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think she is,&quot; Harry answered with a small and confident smile.</p>
