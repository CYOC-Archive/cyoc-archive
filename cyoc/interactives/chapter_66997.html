<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Pascal's naked body rotated slowly on the screen, covered in grey-silver fur from head to toe. Bigger than average...an even 7-feet-tall with a <br />
cock that hung heavy and thick past his knee, atop plump full balls. He was listed as &quot;Married, monogamous&quot; which made Dan frown. How had <br />
he missed the ring?! Still, a partner wasn't totally a bummer, if he changed things correctly... He altered the status to read &quot;Married, open <br />
relationship.&quot; Then...in a moment of crass greediness, &quot;Recently single, on the rebound for someone younger.&quot; Dan was feeling creative, pulled <br />
up the freeform field and quickly typed, &quot;Over the next hour, Pascal will grow to the average size of a redhead.&quot; He left the &quot;Alter-reality&quot; <br />
checkbox toggled and hit save... <br />
<br />
&quot;No cell phones during class--&quot; A meaty paw swiftly grabbed Dan's phone, pocketing it as Pascal returned to his lecture. Dan's cock throbbed <br />
as he accidentally leaked some precum into his shorts over what he'd just done. He could already see the professor swelling, his traps traveling <br />
up his neck, his pecs broadening, his biceps thickening, his stance getting wider and wider as his package got heavier. Dan couldn't <br />
concentrate on the classwork as long as Professor Pascal strutted around in front of him, mentally sizing up his students to see who would be a <br />
fun romp after breaking up with his husband of many years.<br />
<br />
The air around the classroom shimmered and rippled as reality caught up with the professor's growth. His mug doubled in size, his desk rose <br />
taller. The class felt more full as a couple students suddenly materialized in the empty seats. &quot;Please see me after class to get it back,&quot; Pascal <br />
loomed over Dan, nearing 9-feet tall and about as wide, his package had grown enough that it protruded as far as his bloated muscle gut, and <br />
hung low enough to still rest on Dan's desk. Growing bigger by the minute, he could see the professor's clothing rebuilding itself on his <br />
swelling frame, changing styles slightly to accommodate his growing mass.<br />
<br />
He couldn't afford to custom-tailor his clothes on a professor's salary, after all, so his clothing become less professional-looking, a stretchy t-<br />
shirt and baggy pants. His charisma still demanded respect as an elder, however, and he was even more intimidating now that his salt and <br />
pepper fur was bursting out of his collar, his biceps on full display. Dan wondered if he had to buy special undergarments to harness the beast <br />
that Pascal was carrying around in his pants.<br />
<br />
A chime rung throughout the campus as Dan's class came to an end. The professor stood by the door, nodding as his students left...only half-<br />
way through his growth and he was a couple inches taller than Chad, the massive redhead, and still growing. Dan gulped wondering just what <br />
&quot;average&quot; entailed for the Celtic giants. His attention was brought back to Pascal as he lumbered towards Dan, inching closer to the ceiling with <br />
each step. He now wore a collar and a tie, shirtless, with a kilt that barely covered his growing equipment...now so big that the tip rested on the <br />
floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you were saying we could talk about stuff that didn't relate to computer science,&quot; Dan smiled shyly, watching his professor continue to <br />
loom larger and larger, his belly softly, quietly expanding, his pecs puffing out, his arms bloating, his cock unfurling inch after luscious inch...<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps some extra credit...&quot; Dan stepped back, his cock painfully erect and probably very obvious &quot;...Sir?&quot; That was all that Pascal <br />
needed...with a swiftness Dan wouldn't expect from someone his size, the professor hefted Dan up into a bear hug, kissing him deeply and <br />
making him squirm between his swollen, meaty pecs. Dan groaned into the kiss, taking the opportunity to feel the hairy mass of his teacher, <br />
rubbing the ruddy skin and feeling the cool hair slide over his fingers. Pascal's muscles were enormous and apparently still inflating by the <br />
moment. What had he done to the man?! Far from the desperate, longing kisses he got from Marcus and Patrick, Pascal's kisses were dominant <br />
and experienced... much like the man himself.<br />
<br />
With deft precision and a strong assertiveness, the professor pulled Dan's shorts off while he kissed him. His meaty hands so thick and large <br />
that one cupped his entire ass while the other wrapped ahold of his head and neck. &quot;Mmm, the perfect sized cock--&quot; His voice was deeper <br />
now...Dan's entire body reverberated with it's power. <br />
<br />
Dan felt his body being lifted up high into the air as the professor easily elevated his student, bringing his erect genitals to his bearded face <br />
and swallowing them with gusto. Dan gasped and moaned, having to stifle the urge to yell out his excitement and lust as his teacher pleasured <br />
him. Professor Pascal was apparently quite adept at pleasuring a man, as well! Dan curled his toes, moaning in fits of pleasure. As the hour-<br />
transformation came to an end, Dan felt the heavy, warmness press into his backside. Pascal's cock had grown massive, arching up over his gut <br />
and pressing into Dan. Big enough for the cub to straddle. The professor rubbed a thick finger along Dan's rump, it felt as big and thick as <br />
Dan's own cock, the thought alone pushed him over the edge, cumming hard into the professor's throat<br />
<br />
The experienced man drank it down hungrily, growling for more as Dan continued to shoot, almost as if his cock was afraid of disappointing <br />
the giant man. Finally, though, he'd reached his physical limit and came down from his orgasm, still dripping a few drops into his professor's <br />
throat. Pascal slowly removed him from his mouth, sucking gingerly at the head of Dan's cock, making sure he got all of his seed.<br />
<br />
Grinning, he pulled off and took Dan for another deep kiss, &quot;Thank you,&quot; his giant body glistened with sweat, filling the classroom with a rich, <br />
heady aroma. &quot;I can tell we're going to have a good semester, you and I.&quot; The professor set Dan down letting Dan finally see just how massive <br />
he had grown. Sitting against the wall, Dan came up to Pascal's oversized balls. He guessed the man was nearly 20-feet tall, and just as thick <br />
and wide. He had the same bloated proportions as Patrick, only supersized, with a cock that rose up between his pecs.<br />
<br />
Dan's head spun. THIS was average for a redhead?! What sort of freakish monsters had he created?! But he couldn't deny the raw sexuality that <br />
oozed off of his professor, even now, moments after being serviced by him. &quot;Yes, sir. Very good! I think you'll find that I'm an eager student.&quot; <br />
Maybe he had gone too far... <br />
<br />
&quot;Again, thank you, boy. Most men are turned off by someone of my size not being completely submissive.&quot; Dan started pulling on his clothes, <br />
listening to his professor intently, &quot;Perhaps, if you're interested,&quot; he fastened his kilt back around his waist, just under his massive gut, &quot;we <br />
could grab dinner sometime...?&quot;<br />
<br />
“That'd be lovely, sir,&quot; Dan smiled, his cheeks rosy with excitement. He really liked what had transpired between him and Prof. Pascal. He <br />
wondered if there would be something more besides just hot sex if they decided to get to know each other better... Having two oversized sex <br />
kittens waiting for him back in his dorm was hot, but an enormous bear with a mind of his own was a turn-on, too!<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, call me Dave.&quot; He smiled down to Dan, his face warm with the wisdom of his age, &quot;you better get going to your next class, and be sure <br />
to say hi to your Alpha Bear for me, Dan.&quot; The professor winked, preparing his classroom for the next session. Dan shivered as he nodded <br />
dumbly, taking his bookbag and toddling out of the classroom, completely shaken by the sexual encounter he'd shared with that huge <br />
professor. Would all his teachers be so sexy and handsome and willing to couple with him?<br />
<br />
Dan looked down at his schedule for his next class...</p>
