<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Oakmoss:<br />
<br />
&quot;As two tall trees, us two grew close, entwined<br />
together. I a gentle oak and you<br />
a mighty cedar. I threw down my wealth<br />
for little creatures down among our roots<br />
to thrive upon, and you spread wide your shade,<br />
providing shelter from the sun and rain.<br />
<br />
Beloved Karyu, if I instead<br />
became a vine of roses snugly coiled<br />
around your mighty trunk, would you conceive,<br />
among my petals, little ones to fill<br />
this lush and gentle land with songs of joy,<br />
or would we cease to be what we&#39;ve become?&quot;<br />
<br />
Karyu:<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, mossy oak you would remain, my dear,<br />
for it was never just your seed which fell,<br />
from time to time, among my sprawling roots<br />
that always made you dear within my heart,<br />
for you have been, for me, the Star of North,<br />
and you have guided me when I was lost.<br />
<br />
My darling Oakmoss, if you chose to be<br />
my hen, then you would still remain the oak<br />
that I have leaned against when I was tired,<br />
that always set me right when I was lost.<br />
Within you, though, there always dwelled a rose,<br />
and fantasies of that have filled my dreams.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have fantasized about me being a hen?&quot; Oakmoss breathed out in a strangled whisper.<br />
<br />
Karyu blushed. &quot;Sometimes, you let me on top, and I have indeed fantasized that you were a hen as I filled you with my seed. I have dreamed of you being a hen and crying out under me in beautiful song. I have wondered, occasionally, if you did the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oakmoss smiled and kissed Karyu on his blushing cheek. &quot;I have fantasized about us both being hens and lying together in the sun as friends,&quot; he said, &quot;and perhaps we will, someday, allow ourselves that tender friendship hens can have together, based on mutual nurture. I would not loathe you, Karyu, but I would love you for reasons more pure and kind than lust, for a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karyu broke out in a chagrined smile. &quot;I would have to turn, then, to Astrid and Hilda to get any action if I were a hen,&quot; he said, &quot;and those naughty hens put you up to this, didn&#39;t they?&quot;<br />
<br />
Oakmoss ducked his head shyly. Instead of betraying the hens, he quietly initiated the spell that would change his body into that of a hen, which he would remain for the next five years unless Vrackie or Anija worked their transformation magic on him. It was the first time he had worked this particular piece of dragon magic, and he still had no idea what it was going to be like.<br />
<br />
The first thing that happened, though, as he transformed slowly before Karyu, was that his outer oblique muscles drew themselves inward. This left him more flexible in his waist, and he found that he rather enjoyed this fact. With a relieved giggle, he sprawled his hindlegs out to the side, with his chest still flush with the floor and paws spread out in front of him, in a sexy feminine pose.<br />
<br />
Karyu whistled softly. &quot;Already looking sexy,&quot; he said with a grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you objectifying me already?&quot; Oakmoss giggled, his voice reaching a higher pitch as he spoke. &quot;You&#39;re going to end up addling my wits if you keep ogling me that way!&quot;<br />
<br />
At this, Karyu leaned his head down and kissed his mate on the head. &quot;Maybe you want your wits a little addled, sometimes,&quot; he growled humorously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps I do,&quot; Oakmoss said in his...her...new feminine voice. &quot;Just don&#39;t carry it too far, or I&#39;m canceling the spell! I swear I&#39;ll do it!&quot;<br />
<br />
The black and red demonic dragon curled his body around that of Oakmoss, hovering dominantly. &quot;You like being owned, you hussy,&quot; he hissed. &quot;Just admit it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oakmoss whimpered submissively. Ever since Karyu had become a demonic dragon, a terrible but sexy dominant side of him had emerged. Oakmoss yelped a little as his balls got sucked into his body, unleashing a tide of mild nausea and some butterflies in his...her...body. She wriggled a little bit and unleashed a series of &quot;owowowow!&quot;s as her penis began to transform into a highly sensitive clitoris. &quot;Yes, it turns me on! It turns me on so much!&quot; she cried despairingly.<br />
<br />
Karyu assumed a mounting position over his shrinking, now incredibly feminine lover. &quot;Get your ass up in the air, hen,&quot; he growled, his voice stern and meaning business.<br />
<br />
Oakmoss cried out helplessly as she scrambled up with her hindpaws. Her scales were swiftly becoming a slightly more pinkish gray, and the color of her scales became a brighter, more living shade of green. She now looked, for all of the world, like a bush of that &quot;early gray&quot; variety of rose, although she still could match her name. &quot;P-p-p-please,&quot; she stammered.<br />
<br />
Karyu hissed and took Oakmoss&#39; neck in his teeth dominantly. &quot;Please what?&quot; he hissed around her slender neck. He held that neck in a way that made it clear that he could end her life with a single twist of his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, Karyu, breed me! I submit my womb to you, to do with as you please! I beg you submissively, my lord, if it be your will, breed me full of your spawn, so I can belong to you forever, my demon lord Madurai!&quot;<br />
<br />
Therefore, Karyu&#39;s gorgeously masculine, sexy hips closed in around his beautiful, soft, pretty, gray rose like a fisted, black glove. His gigantic demon cock invaded that virgin pussy and instantly tore away its virginity.<br />
<br />
Oakmoss cried out, her jaws dropping open and eyes flying open with shock as she realized what it felt like for her female virginity to be claimed. The last fragile vestiges of her masculinity were torn away like bothersome spiderwebs, and her hips spread out wide as her body was transformed into a vessel for bearing the fruits of a drake&#39;s loins. She was and would remain a hen. She wailed the dire yet beautiful wail of a young hen that had just realized her purpose in nature. Her hindpaws clutched in a mixture of pain and pleasure and fear and longing. She knew, in that moment, that doom and fulfillment were one.<br />
<br />
Karyu&#39;s hips began fucking his fat, black cock in and out of his obedient hen, sliding with sloppy, wet slurps as it pounded its way home. With each thrust, his fat, black testicles smacked against his Oakmoss&#39; underbelly, and it was as if each smack was a scornful slap against any remaining shreds of masculinity that might remain in the hen. He didn&#39;t plan to be in any rush to climax, either: he would fuck this hen until she had truly learned her place for good, and only then would she have a right to receive his seed.<br />
<br />
At first, Oakmoss could still feel a little bit like she loved to feel whenever Karyu would take a dominant role with her, when she had been a drake. It felt similar in many ways, and even the slapping of the balls against her was familiar. However, her outlook on sex changed radically when it began to bump against her clitoris, and she howled with burning, hot pleasure that she had never felt before. &quot;MY LORRR-ORR-ORR-ORR-ORR-ORR-ORR-ORRRRRD!&quot; she cried out like the baying of a hunting hound, her mind being reduced in that moment to that of a pure animal.<br />
<br />
Karyu realized how much he liked having Oakmoss&#39; mind shattered by pleasure. Whenever Oakmoss would get shattered to pieces by the pleasure he could give her, he felt so much more dominant. He loved to feel her writhing helplessly under him. He loved knowing that he had reduced her to pure bestial instinct. He loved the way that her hips would spread out and her hindfeet would stretch up onto their tip-toes whenever her voice would get choked in screams of pleasure, so Karyu shifted his stance in just such a manner that he could get the little hen permanently rocking in violent, mind-shattering orgasms.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Oakmoss&#39; mind truly did break, and she was lying limp and catatonic as she was overwhelmed with pleasure. Her eyes were perfectly glazed over, and her body had turned into that of a fuck-doll. Every time she would start to come down from an orgasm, Karyu would send her over the edge again, and eventually, her mind just became exhausted from the sheer effort of attempting to come back to sanity. Therefore, she remained with her mind locked in a coma of pure overwhelming pleasure.<br />
<br />
As Karyu&#39;s orgasm approached, he changed his stance again, widening it a bit to let the blood flow more freely to his cock. His toes stretched out, and his hips bucked now in hard and fast regular strokes. Soon, with a satisfying rush of pleasure, his loins began releasing his seed into his hen. In time, his orgasm subsided, and he collapsed heavily upon his hen, whose mind was still locked in its torpor, and began licking her affectionately.<br />
<br />
Together, they drifted off to sleep.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
The next day, Oakmoss was lying together with Hilda and Astrid, and they were having some girl-talk. Hilda said to her, &quot;I noticed your scale color changed a little bit with your sex, so have you thought about taking the name Grayrose, perhaps?&quot;<br />
<br />
Oakmoss cuffed the wheat colored dragoness gently on the shoulder. &quot;You silly hen! You will still need me as a guide among you, so I think that I will keep my drake name. A hen can show you the way north just as well as a drake.&quot;<br />
<br />
Astrid chuckled and nuzzled her neck. &quot;That&#39;s the spirit, girl!&quot; she said. &quot;Karyu might be the lord of his harem, girlfriend, but you remain our north star, be you drake or hen. You have given us morality, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
At this, Oakmoss flushed. &quot;I-I-I...no, I deny that there is absolute morality,&quot; she said hastily.<br />
<br />
Hilda laughed a laugh of pure joy. &quot;That&#39;s why you have guided us so well, Oakmoss,&quot; she said happily. &quot;You don&#39;t go looking for morality from some other source. You don&#39;t ask for someone else to tell you the answers. You have realized something that us stupid fools could never have figured out on our own: virtue is not something we ought to go looking for or hoping for, and a sustainable sense of meaning will not be revealed to us in a moment of epiphany on a starlit night. These are things that we need to make from scratch, and once we have, we have to keep inspecting them, revising them, and repairing them as we go. You never put away your compass and call it done, and you convey the truth of this in beautiful words. You are a philosopher poet, Oakmoss.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even though I am also a silly, little hen?&quot; said the little hen.<br />
<br />
Hilda kissed her on her head. &quot;You&#39;re adorable, girl, but we know what you are on the inside. No matter how much we want to munch you until you scream, we&#39;ll always know what lies under that hot twat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Astrid fixed Hilda with a stern look. &quot;You know that Oakmoss only has eyes for the drakes, Hilda,&quot; she warned. &quot;Speaking of, though,&quot; she said, turning her attention to Oakmoss, &quot;perhaps...since we have become such good friends...could you please, please, PLEASE talk Karyu into giving us another clutch?&quot; She made great, big puppy-dog eyes.<br />
<br />
Oakmoss blushed hotly and tucked her pretty hindfeet up against her into a defensive ball. &quot;You two aren&#39;t going to leave him alone, are you?&quot; she asked resignedly.<br />
<br />
Hilda beamed. &quot;We have been very happy with the little ones he has already given us, though,&quot; she said. &quot;Annie is a natural born mother hen, and she has been loving them, too. By the way, Hadad is a bisexual sort of drake. Maybe, one of these days, Karyu could give each of them turns with him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A harem of five???&quot; cried Oakmoss. &quot;Is there going to be any left for me???&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Hadad&#39;s a good fuck,&quot; Astrid said. &quot;He gave me and Hilda are first clutch, didn&#39;t he?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hilda nodded. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Oakmoss. You&#39;ll like being part of a harem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I want to be his bride!&quot; Oakmoss whined.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you would be,&quot; Hilda assured her, taking Oakmoss&#39; left forepaw in hers. &quot;We just want to be concubines. Karyu will never owe us anything. He gives excellent clutches. His seed is a benefit to any household. He gives strong warriors to any family that takes his essence.&quot;<br />
<br />
Astrid took Oakmoss&#39; right forepaw and squeezed it gently, smiling warmly and supportively. &quot;We won&#39;t force it upon you, though. We will respect you. Just know that we would be honored to be your harem sisters, Oakmoss. We would love you as we would a member of our family.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oakmoss was presented with a choice, then.</p>
