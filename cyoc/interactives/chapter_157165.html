<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The creepy woman left momentarily before returning with a clear spring in her step. Jenkins looked up to see that she was carrying another bird; in fact it was a budgie just like him. This made the former man recoil in terror. If the Aviary operated anything like the Stables then the arrival of this other bird surely wasn’t a coincidence.<br />
<br />
“Stop… bwark! Get away… bwark!” Jenkins was pleasantly surprised to find that he, like many budgies, was still able to talk to some degree. However his vocabulary seemed to be very restricted, almost as if he had forgotten most of the words that he knew as a human. Despite this, Jenkins still managed to make his feelings known as he continued to protest amidst more angry squawks.<br />
<br />
“Now, now, that’s no way to greet someone.” The Aviary’s boss grinned as she sauntered up to the birdcage with the other budgie perched on her outstretched arm. She then bent forward to whisper something into the budgie’s ear. <br />
<br />
The bird seemed to nod in understanding as it received some careful instructions from the strange woman. “Bwark… yes mistress. Bwark… thank you mistress.”<br />
<br />
With that, the woman opened Jenkins’ cage before gently lowering the bird inside. The newcomer hopped onto a twig that decorated the enclosure before the woman withdrew her arm. “Now I’ll let you two get to know each other while I tend to some of my other pets. Have fun!”<br />
<br />
Jenkins watched as the evil woman descended the ladder that led to her tree-based office. With her out of the way, Jenkins desperately tried to communicate with the other budgie who the doctor suspected was once human as well.<br />
<br />
“Bwark… you human?” Jenkins asked in his strange squawking voice.<br />
<br />
The other bird said nothing as it watched Jenkins, seemingly with an amused look in its eyes. Instead the other bird subtly puffed out its chest and spread its wings, showing off its plumage to the confused doctor.<br />
<br />
However, while this display meant nothing to Jenkins, he couldn’t stop his body from reacting positively. He started to feel slightly flushed as he studied the other budgie. He couldn’t help admiring the bird’s bright colours and confident attitude. The doctor seemed to derive a great deal of enjoyment just from looking at his new companion. Shamefully, the sensations sent jolts of excitement lancing into Jenkins’ new avian sex, causing it to swell and drip with fluids as his arousal inexplicably grew.<br />
<br />
The doctor’s questions soon trailed off as his head became fuzzy. He couldn’t explain why, but he couldn’t help feeling attracted to the budgie in front of him. “Bwark… hard to …think. What’s happening to… bwark… me?”<br />
<br />
Again there was no answer. Instead, the mischievous budgie approached with that same knowing look in its eyes. Before long the two birds were rubbing their bodies together as they studied each other up close.<br />
<br />
Dr Jenkins was struggling to process what was happening as he rubbed up against the oddly attractive budgie beside him. The feeling of the bird’s warm feathered body and the strong scent that filled the air was completely captivating. The throbbing in his cloaca intensified as his lust built; with the natural urge to reproduce quickly eroding the man’s human doubts.<br />
<br />
Jenkins’ resistance was steadily worn down as he courted with his new companion. His body’s desires drowned out his protests as the need to mate quickly filled the former-man’s jumbled mind. “Bwark… mustn’t give in” he said to himself in a trembling, squawky voice. “So horny… bwark… need… mate! Bwark! Need to cum!”<br />
<br />
With his resistance shattered, Jenkins surrendered to his body’s instincts. He turned from his soon-to-be mate, making sure to bend down low whilst raising his tail so that his dripping sex was on full display.<br />
<br />
These urges added to the confusion that engulfed the doctor’s mind. He somehow knew that something wasn’t right. Why was he bending over like this? He knew enough about avian mating to know that the male normally dictated proceedings by mounting his mate. An uneasy feeling quickly settled inside Jenkins’ stomach as he suspected he knew the answer to his own question.<br />
<br />
However the transformed doctor refused to believe his theory; that is until he felt a pair of bony feet gripping his back and the other budgie’s form looming above him. “NO! I can’t be a… not a… a fema-BWARK!”<br />
<br />
Jenkins was cut off abruptly as the two birds joined their sexes together. Terror gripped the former man as the true extent of his, or more accurately ‘HER,’ punishment started to sink in. Haunting visions of laying countless eggs and living as the Birdwoman’s caged pet raced through the doctor’s mind.<br />
<br />
However, Jenkins’ distress was accompanied by a wave of wild animalistic lust that surged through her body as the mating truly began. She squawked and flapped her wings in joy as she and her mate passionately rubbed their sexes together. Her avian vent felt hot and slick as various juices mixed together to help lubricate the two lovers as they ground against each other. Something about bending over and submitting to this virile male was deeply arousing to the former doctor. Worryingly, those visions of laying eggs and joining her mate as the woman’s pet didn’t seem all that bad anymore.<br />
<br />
Jenkins shut her eyes as she worked in harmony with her enthusiastic mate. The friction against her sensitive vent sent jolts of intense pleasure shooting through her body as her mate rhythmically rubbed against her. She unwittingly released several squirts of warm feminine juices as they shot from her swollen orifice. These fluids ended up dribbling down her thighs as they coated the soft feathers on her underside.<br />
<br />
The mating steadily built in intensity as the two budgies fully embraced their bestial urges. With Jenkins seemingly starting to surrender to his new instincts, the male budgie finally spoke, simply repeating the phrase: ‘serve the Zoo! Serve the Mistress’ over and over in a strange sort of chant. <br />
<br />
With Jenkins’ human consciousness struggling to hang on, this subliminal message quickly permeated the former-man’s warped mind. The words reverberated through the female’s head as they settled into her subconscious; mercilessly bending the former-man’s will to suit her new form. Before long, Jenkins was steadily convinced that serving the Zoo and her new Mistress was her new purpose in life. She had to help preserve the Zoo’s operation in any way she could; and donating her eggs seemed like a good place to start!<br />
<br />
“BWARK… Yes! Serve the Zoo… Bwark… serve the Mistress.” Jenkins’ voice became much louder and shriller as the couple neared their climax. “Need to cum- BWARK! Need to lay for the Mistress! Need your seed! Need to… BWARKAWK!!!” <br />
<br />
Both birds screeched out in relief as they came together. The male budgie shoved his cloaca right up against his mate’s opening before a torrent of cum started erupting inside her. Jenkins was quickly filled to the brim as the male’s sticky, sperm-rich semen fired into her in several powerful squirts. The feeling of her mate’s jizz as it coated her inner passage was deeply satisfying to the former man, who responded by adding more of her own juices to the mix. By the time the male dismounted, Jenkins’ cloaca was left stretched open and dripping cum, while the feathers beneath her tail were thoroughly-coated in various sexual fluids.<br />
<br />
The two budgies were left breathing heavily as they recovered from their wild love-making. It was during this interlude that the Aviary’s boss reappeared. “My, my, I see you two lovebirds had a fun time; I could hear you both from outside!” Just to confirm her suspicions, the woman bent down to examine Jenkins beneath the tail. She was delighted to see a small stream of cum still oozing out of the female’s swollen vent.<br />
<br />
The woman smiled as she turned to address the freshly-bred Dr Jenkins. “Well I’m pleased to see that you have embraced your changes so enthusiastically. I hope you understand that I am your Mistress now and that your only purpose is to serve me and the Zoo, is that clear?”<br />
The female budgie was still too overwhelmed with post-orgasmic pleasure to really think about her reply. “Yes Mistress. Serve you… Bwark!” Her reply slipped out almost unwittingly; it somehow just sounded right to the brainwashed bird.<br />
<br />
“Good to hear,” the Birdwoman said with a smile “you’ll make a fine addition to my collection!”<br />
<br />
“Bwark… thank you mistress” came the former-man’s reply.<br />
<br />
“So subservient already,” the woman grinned as she continued “I would have expected more resistance from someone so cruel. Oh and that reminds me, I have decided that you shall be known as ‘Jen’ from now on, since that seems to be more appropriate given your new gender.”  <br />
<br />
“Understood Mistress” Jen replied. “Serve the Zoo, serve you… bwark!”<br />
“Brilliant! You seem to be getting the hang of your new position already, however, just to make sure; I think we’d better let Max here have a bit more fun with you. He too was a bit reluctant when he first arrived, but he eventually came around, didn’t you Max?”<br />
<br />
“Bwark… yes Mistress,” the male budgie replied eagerly, “love to serve you Mistress. Bwark! Much better than being human… bwark!”<br />
<br />
“Such a loyal pet” the woman smiled as she still vividly remembered the day that the troublesome employee joined her collection. “I think you deserve a reward for your service. Feel free to have fun with your new mate as much as you like; I want to make sure that Jen here is fully broken in by the morning.”<br />
<br />
“Bwark! Thank you Mistress!” both birds squawked out excitedly.<br />
<br />
Now, eager to satisfy her desires and those of her Mistress, Jen turned away from Max like she had before. She spread her legs and raised her tail feathers, practically shoving her still-dripping cloaca into the male’s face. Max accepted Jen’s open invitation without hesitation. Before long the treehouse was filled with more lustful squawks as the two budgies rigorously fucked, hoping to please their Mistress as she watched on in delight. <br />
<br />
The two former-men passionately ground against each other as their lust crescendoed out of control. Before long, Jen was receiving a fresh dose of Max’s seed as she and her mate climaxed together again. <br />
<br />
However, the couple’s burning desire wasn’t quenched for long. Soon Jen was being mounted for a third time as the cycle repeated itself again and again and again, deep into the night.<br />
<br />
As this was going on, the Aviary’s sadistic boss watched on in amusement, clearly satisfied with the latest addition to her growing collection…</p>
