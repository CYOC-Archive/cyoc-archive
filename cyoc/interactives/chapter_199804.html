<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Alright... just... one...more!&quot; With one final grunt, Randy completed his last rep and dropped the weights to the ground. It was five days since Sandra had cast that spell, and Randy had been reaping the benefits. At first, the mechanic thought he was getting fat, but once he saw the beginning of his abs, he realized he was putting on muscle, not fat. <br />
<br />
It was so invigorating to wake up and find more muscle on his body. Randy started to actually use the gym machines rather than just fix them. Usually, he disliked working out, but now that he had the strength now, he just loved challenging himself and seeing how much weight he could lift. Sure, the mechanic had no idea why this was happening, but at this point, he didn&#39;t care.<br />
<br />
The man went to the mirror and started flexing. No longer was he a lanky mechanic, but now a regular gym-goer at the very least. He started with the classic double biceps and watched his former non-existent biceps were now the size of baseballs. He then turned sideways and flexed his pecs. They were causing the fabric of Randy&#39;s tanktop to strain as his pecs bulged against it. He needed to buy another tanktop soon; his abs were showing through, but he wasn&#39;t buying one now. The way the tank top hugged his body made him look so rugged and sexy. In fact, Randy wondered if he could finally get a boyfriend his body now. Just thinking about that made him happier than he had ever been in a long time.<br />
<br />
Speaking of boyfriend, there was something else that Randy had observed over the last 5 days. He wasn&#39;t the only one changing, as it seemed like every man who went to the gym was changing. Most men were getting more athletic and muscular. However, some were getting older, others were getting younger, some were changing races, and one person was, oddly enough, getting thinner. All of them, however, had one change in common, and that was the fact that men were becoming gayer. It started out with people being a bit bi-curious, being a bit more touchy-feely with each other. However, after five days, most of the men Randy thought were straight pretty much were bisexual. Men were kissing each other when no one was looking, having escapades in the sauna. Things like that. Even the top personal trainer of the gym and the straightest man Randy had ever seen, Bradley Channing, was now casually sleeping with guys. And proud of it.<br />
<br />
It was a bizarre experience for the young mechanic. Since he was already gay, his sexuality wasn&#39;t changing but experiencing those who used to look down on him for it was interesting, liberating even. What was even stranger, though, was the fact that a good majority of people didn&#39;t even notice it happening. There were a couple of people asking around if anyone noticed any changes, but Randy always said he didn&#39;t. Sure, he could have joined forces with them and figured out what was happening, but Randy didn&#39;t want these changes to stop. The mechanic was pretty buff, but he wasn&#39;t satisfied with just that; he wanted to look like Bradley. Not only that but there was something else that he wanted out of this magic gym. He wanted revenge.<br />
<br />
Randy had already figured out that the body and sexuality changes were tied to going to the people who went to this 20 Fitness gym. So, if there were people that Randy wanted to change, all he had to do was take them to the gym, and its magic would do the rest. And Randy had a few people in mind that could use a change. The people who fired him and ruined his life just because of the people he wanted to date. Getting those people to use this gym and then getting them hooked to it because they see their bodies change. Then when they finally realize that their sexuality has changed, it will be too late. Provided that they were some of the few people who noticed in the first place. Yeah, Randy couldn&#39;t think of a better way to take revenge. Now all he needed to do was get those people to the gym. Better talk to Bradly, he thought. Luckily, Randy had access to the staff room, where Bradly hung out between sessions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, Randy. You&#39;re looking good. Glad you&#39;re finally using this gym like I suggested,&quot; Bradly greeted as Randy walked in. Honestly, the mechanic felt himself starting to blush. To be complemented by someone like Bradly? No, come on, Randy, you have an image of being a grumpy mechanic. He couldn&#39;t let the public know he was secretly soft on the inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I needed to look more intimidating to put those frat bros in their place.&quot; Randy flexed an arm to prove his point and observed the appreciative look Bradly gave to him. &quot;I appreciate the compliment, but that&#39;s not what I wanted to talk about. Do you remember when I said that I worked for a computer company?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah. It&#39;s the same company that made the computers at our gym, right? Are you planning to go back there or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?! Hel- Er, I mean, no, don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m not planning to back there anytime soon.&quot; Whoa, best not get too heated on the topic of his old company. The plan won&#39;t work if he did. &quot;Well, they don&#39;t have a company gym, and I&#39;ve heard they&#39;re looking for a good deal for company benefits.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, I get what you&#39;re saying,&quot; Bradly was grinning. More clients were something the trainer always was looking for, and a rich client like that? &quot;I&#39;m all ears, Randy. What do I need to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hooked line and sinker.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just need to make some gym passes for some people, and I&#39;ll take care of the rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice, but who do I make out these passes to?&quot; That was a good question. The correct answer was probably someone influential enough to bring the rest of the company here, but who? There was Harvey Martins from the marketing department. He was blond, thin, rich, and haughty. Someone like him was not only a prime candidate who could influence the company but also someone who could be taken down a peg.<br />
<br />
Then again, there was also Alec Brooks. The guy who outed him in the first place. That homophobic sleaze-ball really deserved what this gym would do to him. Brooks, huh? Now that he thought of it, didn&#39;t someone who went to this gym have the same last name as him? Maybe a relative of his?<br />
<br />
Finally, he could always go for the head of the company, Viktor Page. A portly older man; who probably was looking to lose weight. Page was the person who fired him, and Randy was interested in how the gym would change him, but would it be wise to go for the head first?<br />
<br />
Quite a decision to make, but after thinking it over, Randy came to a decision.</p>
