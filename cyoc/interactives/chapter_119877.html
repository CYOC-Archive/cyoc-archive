<br />
The throng of reporters milling at the front of the court house looked confused as an ambulance came barreling towards them. A few of the reporters jumping out of the way as the ambulance entered the parking lot and drove to the back of the court house; the one area security and police have kept the press from since they arrived. Moments later a dozen police cruisers all arrive at the same mad pace that the ambulance just did. The reporters realized something was up and a few with camera crews started rolling; interrupting their stations current feed with a live update as to what was happening.<br />
<br />
 *******<br />
<br />
Back in Seattle, Jack Crawford was sitting on his sofa watching a review of the day’s stock market gains and losses. Listening to the analysis while a ticker scrolls on the bottom of the screen displaying the numbers for the major publicly traded companies. Seeing Knight Industries stock up three points from close of the day’s last trading, Jack grumbles as it is further ammunition against him in trying to prove that Benton Knight is unfit as CEO and President. Looking at his cell phone to see a message from Jose; Jack picks it up and looks confused. Not getting the cryptic meaning of ‘Target dealt with; going to ground.’ Jack was about to call the man when the news station started flashing with a breaking news story.<br />
<br />
“We apologize for this interruption but our news crew in Moon Lake has just reported a new development in regards to Frederick Parker’s arrest and extradition.”<br />
Jack snaps to the screen as he sees the court house in the background of t.v screen with a dour looking man holding a microphone droning on how a few minutes ago an ambulance and police cars all of a sudden showed up.<br />
“…with police so far refusing to divulge any further information at the moment,” Jack listening to the man speaking; “all we can report at the moment is a court officer was shot and killed in the back of the court house. No word if this was an attempt from Frederick Parker to escape custody after being arrest the previous day for role in assaulting the town’s police station.”<br />
<br />
Jack’s eyes were wide and bug faced at the breaking news story. The aimless banter from the onsite reporter and station news anchor as they rehash what happened during the Labor Day Monday and giving those that just tuned in a brief synopsis on who Frederick Parker is. Flipping to another station; Jack is treated to the same breaking news story airing from a different station. In fact all the major stations are airing what just happened.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Douglas Cooper got the call just as he watched Darrell made a mess of himself eating the sloppy Joes Joan made for supper. His mood instantly turning foul as he had to rush into the bedroom and puts on his Sheriff’s uniform. Coming out of the bedroom and looking at Darrel and Joan; Douglas just shakes his head.<br />
“Is it bad,” Joan looking at her were-grizzly mate.<br />
“Shooting at the court house,” Douglas responding; “a court officer is dead and Frederick Parker is being rushed to the hospital. I have to be there,” Douglas finishing getting ready by grabbing his sheriff’s hat; “the press are swarming the court house. Fortunately the deputies had the good sense to lock the court house down,” Douglas grabbing the nearby bottle of aspirin and taking a few pills. “I don’t know when I’m going to be back,” Douglas grumbling; “but this is serious and I have to leave.”<br />
“Go,” Joan looking shocked as she had the television turned on and looking at the breaking news story; “just be safe.”<br />
“I will,” Douglas approaching Joan to give her a kiss; turning around to see Darrell is still a mess, Douglas just pats the kid on the head and rushes out the door.<br />
<br />

<br />
“Holy Shit,” Nate shouts as he was currently the only one watching t.v. at the Talbot household. “You got to come see this everyone,” Nate shouting.<br />
Regina, Jean and Helen were the first to show up in the living room. Being in the kitchen and cleaning up after dinner; the two were-lioness’s and lone were-rabbit gasp as they read the headline.<br />
‘At least one dead and another seriously wounded in Court House shooting.’<br />
“….At this time, Moon Lake police are still refusing to divulge any information. But what we can confirm is that a court officer was killed as he was escorting a prisoner to a deputy. Whether this the result of a possible escape attempt from Frederick Parker… Wait the sheriff has just arrived on the scene!”<br />
<br />
As Leon, Peter and Andy enter the Talbot living room, they witness the scene of Sheriff Cooper being mobbed by reporters badgering him with questions. Updates on the situation; whether Frederick Parker is still in custody. Seeing the Sheriff ignore their questions as he crosses the police tape an heads to the back area of the court house.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
“I want an update,” Sheriff Cooper looking at the deputies; examining the crime scene and seeing a large pool of blood. A white sheet over the body of one man and the ambulance that was here earlier already at Moon Lake General Hospital.<br />
“It wasn’t an escape attempt,” a deputy speaking; “talking with officer who witnessed the events, one shot has fired from the woods over there. It was muffled,” the deputy lowering his voice; &quot;but as a were...we can hear more acutely then a regular person.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sheriff Cooper turns to see several other deputies combing the area in question, nodding as he listens to what his deputy is currently telling him.<br />
“Call agent Brooke Reed,” Sheriff Copper telling the deputy; “tell her I want her and the entire FBI Seattle field office helping us on this. Frederick Parker was their whale; they are going to want the person who orchestrated this. And mobilize every deputy,” Sheriff Cooper shouting; “I want roadblocks in and out of town. We need to catch this son of a bitch.”<br />
“On it,” was all the deputy said as he watched Sheriff Cooper head back to the throng of reporters.<br />
<br />
As he looks at the mob; Douglas takes the bottle of aspirin in his pocket and pops a few pills. Not caring that his actions are being broadcasted live for people to see on television, the sheriff had a mounting headache brewing and he knew it wasn’t going to go away anytime soon. Approaching the throng of waiting reporters, Sheriff Cooper raises his hand to silence the din.<br />
“Moments ago,” Sheriff Cooper speaking to the throng; “an unknown person or person’s attempted to assassinate Frederick Parker, killing a court officer in the process. Currently,” Sheriff Cooper still speaking, thus preventing the reporters from interrupting; “Frederick Parker is at the hospital were the doctors are doing what they can to save his life. I do not what his status is,” Sheriff Cooper speaking loudly so as to keep the reporters still silent; “what we have so far uncovered in our preliminary investigation is that one shot was fired from a distance. This leads us to suspect a powerful long range weapon was used in an attempt to kill him. Currently we are searching the wooded area behind the courthouse and we are setting up roadblocks at the various entry points into town. The FBI have been call to help assist us in this.”<br />
<br />
*********<br />
<br />
&#9835;…Mama put my guns in the ground<br />
I can&#39;t shoot them anymore<br />
That cold black cloud is comin&#39; down…&#9835;*<br />
<br />
Driving at the speed limit in a desperate attempt to get out of town; Jose held his breath as a half dozen police cruiser approached him with their sirens wailing. Slowing down as they drive past him, Jose exhales as they are heading to the court house. He knew he had to get out and fast.<br />
<br />
&#9835;…Knock-knock-knockin&#39; on heaven&#39;s door<br />
Knock-knock-knockin&#39; on heaven&#39;s door…&#9835;<br />
<br />
Speeding up as he drives on, Jose silently swears; shutting the radio off as the song being played on KCML was a distraction to his concentration. While the town’s layout made it easy for him to stay hidden when he shot Frederick Parker, its layout is almost maze-like in trying to get to a main road that leads out of town. Despite memorizing his escape route; Jose was now drawing a blank as to which turn he needs to make at the next intersection. Opting to take a left; Jose doesn’t realize that his turn will eventually have him loop back around to the front of the court house and what will be one of the first of many police road blocks.<br />
<br />
*Knocking On Heaven&#39;s Door being sung by Bob Dylan</p>
