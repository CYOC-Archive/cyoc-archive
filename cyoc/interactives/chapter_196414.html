<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Clark woke up the following day, he started looking for his old winter coat in the closet, but he couldn’t find it anywhere. <br />
<br />
“Mom? Where’s my old winter coat?” he asked his mom.<br />
<br />
“It’s at the dry cleaner’s, sweetheart. You’ll get it back tomorrow!” she responded.<br />
<br />
Clark realized this forced him to wear the magic jacket for one more added day since he had nothing else to wear for the cold weather outside. He had to get the mail outside and he had to deliver some packages to a neighbor down the street. <br />
<br />
He also wanted to visit his grandparents, who immediately took note of how big and how muscular he had become. All he could say was that he started working out in the gym for several hours every day and that he has been making steady progress. <br />
<br />
Next, Clark went with his mother to the grocery store, to the drugstore and finally to the hardware store. They had several errands to run, and it was on several occasions where Clark had to use some muscle to help carry the potted plants which his mom had purchased at the nursery. In the past, he had to ask for help. This time, he was able to carry all the heavy potted plants himself, thanks to his added strength. <br />
<br />
During lunch and dinner, Clark noticed that he also ate a lot more food than he did in the past. He ate twice as much as before, often having seconds and finishing his plate. For a guy who used to hate eating his vegetables, now he ate everything and more. He even got extra helpings of salads and beans and soup. He wanted to have all the protein that was available to him during every meal. <br />
<br />
That night, when he finally examined himself before the bathroom mirror, Clark just stood in amazement.  His pecs were massive, and his arms were bulging. He couldn’t believe how wide his shoulders had become. His quads were thick and wide, plus he now had a six-pack that was just ripped all over. <br />
<br />
He was afraid he was becoming too big, too wide, and too muscular. Luckily, his mother had come into the room with his old winter coat from the dry cleaner’s. <br />
<br />
“Time to give this thing to good old Jax!” he said, as he sat at his desk and held the jacket on his lap. “All I want to do now is go to the gym and lift weights all the time. I guess, Jax needs to be the next guy to grow and become big! And it’s all thanks to this thing!” <br />
<br />
Clark woke up feeling amazing the following morning. He was 6 feet tall and over 240 pounds of solid muscle. The only thing on his mind was to study hard in school and to lift weights like an animal in the gym. He didn’t care about anything else. He just wanted to become as big and as strong as possible, and the jacket had changed his body in such a way that it became easy for him to fulfill those dreams. <br />
<br />
Clark showered and got dressed before he texted his buddy. Then, he put on his old winter coat, while carrying the jacket in his gym soft bag. He walked over the large park which was down the street from the gym. He was planning on meeting Jax there. <br />
<br />
When Jax spotted him from the distance, he could barely recognize him. Both guys were known as the biggest nerds in school, but Clark was now bigger, taller and way more muscular. <br />
<br />
“Whoa! Clark? What the hell, man? Look at you! You’re massive!” Jax gasped as he looked up at his bigger and taller friend from school. <br />
<br />
Clark set the bag down and unzipped it, removing the jacket. <br />
<br />
“Here, put this on and wear it over the next week or so. Wear it as long and as often as you can!” Clark ordered him, as Jax removed his old coat and slipped into the jacket. <br />
<br />
The jacket fit too big on the skinny, shorter boy, but that was to be expected. As Jax closed the buttons and pulled up the zipper, he moved his arms around a bit. <br />
<br />
“Oh, it’s nice and comfortable. It’s just too big for me!” <br />
<br />
“You’ll grow into it, the same way I have!” Clark grinned. “Anyway, I’m heading out to the gym. Let me know when you’re ready to come and work out, okay? I’ll refer you so you can come and sign up and get a membership for free during the first month!” <br />
<br />
Clark turned around and walked towards the gym while Jax just stood there, admiring his new jacket. Already, he began to feel a warm, tingling sensation all through his body as he began to walk home. Of course, he was planning on going to the mall, then the park, and then go grocery shopping with his family. He would end up wearing the jacket pretty much the entire day!</p>
<hr/><h3>
So, how much would Jax change during his first day while wearing the jacket?</h3>
