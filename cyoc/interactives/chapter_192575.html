<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Should be another one incoming.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake packs up his stuff when the class was over, stacking his notes onto his books to be brought home and reviewed. Jake is still a Straight-A student after all, even with his mind being changed to better fit the new jock body that he now has. Out of the corner of his eyes, he sees Tim walking out of the classroom but there was an uncertain gait to him. Jake speeds up and speed walks to the door with the other students giving him a path. It was good to have respect like that as he catches up to his geeky friend. “Tim!”<br />
<br />
With his name called by a deep voice, Tim jumps from the unexpected call, turning around to see none other than his jock friend Jake. “Oh, Jake. What’s the matter?”<br />
<br />
Jake could see some sort of uncertainty in his friend’s eyes, and somehow there was an inkling as to why. His flex earlier did get a reaction from Tim where his eyes widened. Jake thought he was shocked at the flex, but, thinking back then that Jake realizes Tim had been bullied by the jocks at school before, along with pretty much the previous Jake and his friend Mason. <br />
<br />
Jake frowns and Tim averts his gaze. Realizing it, Jake catches up with Tim before assumptions were made. “Hey man, don’t be scared. I’m not gonna hurt you bro.” Jake reaches out and gave him a strong hug lifting the smaller male a few inches floating off the floor, chuckling. “I’m still gonna be your best friend! Follow me, we need somewhere much more private than the hallway.”<br />
<br />
Tim sighs and nods in the hug when he was set down, Jake taking the lead. School’s over and most students are now packing up to go home. Jake however had another plan. Taking Tim to the courtyard and finding the furthest seat from the school doors, Jake sits down and waited for his best friend to settle beside him. <br />
<br />
The size difference was noticeable when Jake now looks down at Tim, his new height making him feel the need to do something. Jake takes Tim lightly in a headlock and gives him a good noogie. “How’d you like me now, man?”<br />
<br />
“Jake, you’re making me uncomfortable.” Jake once again was confused but connected that he’s now identified as part of the jock clique, and while Tim was fine with fistbumps before, Tim was still scared.<br />
<br />
“Ah, sorry man. Just the urges because you’re my bro.” Jake chuckles a laugh almost common from the jocks and then pats Tim’s head. “I want to stay as your friend Tim, with Mason too. I’m not gonna forget you, and I have plans to still go for our planned university majors and that’s not gonna change.”<br />
<br />
Tim shudders unexpectedly and turns to look at Jake with a sort of recognization in his eyes. “Uh, Jake, I have two sets of memories about the university major… When you told me that, something lifted in here and I remember you before the jacket…” Tim motions his head, shock in his eyes. “The current you told me that you were planning for the health science major…”<br />
<br />
“Oh?” Jake found the notion intriguing. Smiling brightly, Jake laughed it off. “Weird how the jacket changes people’s awareness of things, even memories. The school, everything, even my parents only remember me as this big successful Straight-A jock of high school.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I have memories of your freshman years. The jock Jake reached out to me to be friends for a mutual passion, even when you were busy with soccer. I still found it weird why you stayed playing soccer when you grew up to become bigger, fitting for football than soccer’s need for a lithe build.” Tim’s face shows contemplation as he remembers the memories of Jake the Jock, comparing it with his memories of Jacob the Nerd. “There’s not much that changed, it’s like a retroactive alteration where you lived differently, with key things kept, like our friendship.”<br />
<br />
“That’s awesome man!” Jake beams with joy, causing Tim to smile too. “I’m going to make sure we stay friends, the best of friends. Mason, Jake, and Tim, the trio. Where’s Mason by the way?”<br />
<br />
“As usual, he goes home first.” Tim shrugs, looking more comfortable. <br />
<br />
“I have a plan to do today. I’m thinking of changing sports to football. As you said, you were confused as to why a big guy like me is playing soccer, when I’m better fit playing football.” Jake grins as Tim’s eyes widen. “I’m making the application today.”<br />
<br />
“Are you sure?” Tim’s face shows genuine worry, “Most of the jocks that hurt us were from that sport.”<br />
<br />
Jake nods, a resolute grin on his face. “I have plans to make changes from inside. See if I can make the jacket to make me captain of the football team and pretty much make sure they help nerds and geeks rather than hurting them.” Patting the comfy varsity jacket, Jake flexes his arms growing slightly bigger than his softball mound. “Don’t worry about me, I’ll stop when I get to that point and give you, and then Mason the jacket so that you can join me.”<br />
<br />
“The jacket. I have a theory on how it works.” Tim takes on a thinker pose, thinking hard and comparing what he has. “It’s like an accelerator and a retroactive changer. My memories of you when you were a nerd were overlaid with memories of your current jock self. Yet, it’s only been five days and you’re already this big and strong.” <br />
<br />
“I feel it in my mind too, you know,” Jake speaks up his experience, knocking on his thick skull. “I’ve changed for both good and bad.”<br />
<br />
“I noticed.” Tim frowns, worried about his friend going poof.<br />
“And don’t worry about it, I don’t intend on losing sight of myself. Pinkie promise that I will make sure we stay friends at the end of this journey.” Jake reaches out his thick digit, and Tim hooks it with a nod. “I promise, and I don’t intend on breaking it. On my name as Jacob Tristan Vandersteen and Jake.”<br />
<br />
Jake gives him another bro-hug, standing up and pulling Tim up too. “Stay safe on your way home, I’m going to go apply for a spot on the football team. If the jacket works as it should, I’d be in the team no problem.” <br />
<br />
Tim nods and gives Jake another hug, the shorter male hugging his abs. It was a nice show of trust though as Jake returns it.<br />
<br />
“Bye Jake.” Tim waves him off and runs home.<br />
<br />
“Alright bro, see you tomorrow. Tell me about myself when things change!” Jake waves him goodbye and turns around. “Applying for the team, let’s go.”</p>
