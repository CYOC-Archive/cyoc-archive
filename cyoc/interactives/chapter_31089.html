<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">"What's it, bro?" Ty said.<br />
<br />
Dustin remembered sumo, he learnt what sumo was some time ago. He enjoyed becoming a champion that day and wanted to repeat it. He was starting to think if becoming a sumo wrestler could be a good idea. But he automatically erased the idea on his head, maybe he wouldn't like being so fat.<br />
<br />
"Oh... Nothing. It's just a bad idea." Dustin smiled to his brother.<br />
<br />
Ty knew his brother has hidding something but he decided to ignore it. He made a wish, returned to their normal bodies, disappeared and quickly re-appeared in their home.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Next day...<br />
<br />
"Ty! Look at these people!" Dustin said.<br />
<br />
"What's it, bro?" Ty ran downstairs.<br />
<br />
His foster brother was watching a weird TV program. Two fat men were wearing strange diapers and wrestling on a round stage.<br />
<br />
"Who are these fat men? They are wearing diapers! Aren't they ashamed?" he said amazed and his brother started to laugh.<br />
<br />
"You don't know what's sumo, don't you?" Dustin said between laughs.<br />
<br />
"They aren't diapers, these things are called mawashis. A mawashi is a thick belt that wraps around a rikishi to protect his genitals and his dignity. As you can deduce a rikishi is a sumo wrestler. And sumo is something like the wrestling we know here, it shares a lot of similarities. A sumo wrestler must throw off the ring his rival." Dustin explained as Ty nodded his head.<br />
<br />
"It's very cool! I love sumo! Next week they are starting the World Sumo League and...!"<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Dustin stopped talking and gasped as he felt a tingling coarse through his body while Ty just stood there and watched. He knew immediately that Ty had made some kind of wish for him to change again.<br />
<br />
First of all, he made Dustin's clothes disappear. As he looked down, he realized that his legs were growing thicker and thicker. He figured that this was needed in order to support the additional upper body weight of what was yet to come.<br />
<br />
As his calves and quads nearly doubled, no... tripled in size, he could almost imagine what Ty was going to do with his upper body!<br />
<br />
Then, his torso started to stretch out. Dustin was normally a tall and skinny guy. Well, not anymore! He looked ridiculous, standing there, with these huge legs and skinny upper body. Of course, Ty wasn't finished yet.<br />
<br />
Next, his stomach started to blow up. Pounds upon pounds of fat started to accumulate, pushing his belly further out forward and sideways! His stomach was blowing up like a balloon, and so were his pecs! He was gaining several hundred pounds of fat in just a few seconds! In moments, his huge belly was hanging out by more than a foot in front of him, making him wobble as he tried to walk. He was like a big, round trash can!<br />
<br />
Lastly, his arms thickened as well, adding to the additional weight to his body. He now became a 500-pound sumo wrestler!<br />
<br />
There was a silence...<br />
<br />
"You want to be there, right?" Ty said smiling to his brother.<br />
<br />
"What... What did you do to me?" Dustin said very nervous. Both noticed that the voice of the fat man was louder and had a lower pitch than before.<br />
<br />
"It's obvious! If you want to participate on that championship you must be a sumo wrestler. I turned you into one of them!" he said.<br />
<br />
"No! I wanted to be there, but I never wished to participate!" he said angry. He took his brother with his giant hand and raised him easily. "Look at me! I'm a monster! TURN ME BACK!!! NOW!!!" he shouted and started to shake his brother in the air.<br />
<br />
"Calm down, bro!" the small Ty said. "Pleaaaseeee! Calm down!"<br />
<br />
Dustin finally left him in the ground.<br />
<br />
"Ok. Now transform me into a normal human." he said.<br />
<br />
"Why don't you stay like this?"<br />
<br />
"What!? NO! I can't stay like this! I hate this body... Look at me! All my muscles bounce when I try to move!"<br />
<br />
"I know you now hate it. But you will be used to it later, and then you will love it. We are always turning into muscular bodybuilders, aren't you tired of transforming on those? Your actual body is totally new, and you should learn to appreciate that. You have a totally new life in front of you!"<br />
<br />
"You don't know what are you saying. Turn into a fat man like me and you will understand me. I hate my own body, so... what people will think about me? They'll laugh at me!"<br />
<br />
"Of course not! With that body you can be a sumo champion and become a famous person. You will become an hero for every little boy! Everyone will want to be like you!<br />
<br />
"Really? But... What will happen to mom & dad? And what about school? I can't go to school like this!"<br />
<br />
"Thanks to my magic mom & dad won't notice anything on you, they will think you have been always a sumo wrestler. And... School? Forget about school now! You are 26! You are free! The only thing that must worry you is your training. Next week the World Sumo League will start and you are participating there! Now, please, go to your room and put on your underwear. You can't go naked like this!"<br />
<br />
Dustin went upstairs and to his room. He was still unsure about that but maybe his brother could be right and he would start to like his body after all. He opened his wardrobe and noticed that all his clothes had been modified to fit his new wide body.<br />
<br />
He tried to find his old black jammers. They were his favourite swimming trunks, and he used to wear them even as normal underwear.<br />
<br />
"Whoah! They're like 20 times bigger!" he said amazed. He stretched to the maximum his jammers. "What an ass I have!" he said laughing. He put on them and went to his mirror. He started to examinate his new body.<br />
<br />
"It isn't so bad after all..." he thought and smiled. His jammers were giant, but they were still tight for him and he felt the same old comfort wearing them. He looked at the mirror. He couldn't believe that fat man was really him. He seemed a professional sumo wrestler wearing only his jammers. "I'm stronger than ever!" he thought as he rubbed his new round big belly "...and fat too..." and then he smiled "...and I love it!"<br />
<br />
It was true. He was fat. But he was a new man too, and being so different was very 'cool' for him. Now he could see his brother and his old schoolmates as small kids, and that made him happy because he was going to be their strong giant hero and he would never have any problem reaching high places or lifting heavy things. He couldn't wait for testing his body on the World Sumo League. He went downstairs very happy.<br />
<br />
"I see... You are starting to like your body, right?" Ty said when he saw his brother.<br />
<br />
"I don't like it... I LOVE IT!!!" he said excited "I never felt so good!" he said.<br />
<br />
Dustin raised his little brother and gave him a big hug. "Thank you, bro!" Ty felt squashed, but tried to hug happily his brother too.<br />
<br />
Next day, Dustin started his hard training. He didn't have so many days like the other wrestlers so he had to work very hard.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
And finally the day arrived.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
"Yes... I'm here..." Dustin thought "My wish was granted."<br />
<br />
He looked around himself. He was surrounded by a lot of fat men like him, they were his rivals on the World Sumo League. In front of him there were a lot of spectators, and between them he knew his parents, Peter, Allen and Ty were waiting there to see him in action.<br />
<br />
He was a bit ashamed. His family never saw him wearing only his mawashi and his giant buttocks were very noticeable.<br />
<br />
"No! No! I can't be ashamed! My bro gave me this body, this is now my body and I should be proud of it as he must be proud of me."<br />
These were his final thoughts, because his first match was about to start.<br />
<br />
"Ok bro. I won't disappoint you. Let's go..." he thought as he crouched down at the starting line.</p>
