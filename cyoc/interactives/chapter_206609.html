<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A rush of steam exited the bathroom as Finn opened the door. He saw Jeff laying on the bed, staring at him. &quot;You look so cute like this,&quot; he smiled. If there wasn&#39;t so much orange fur covering Finn&#39;s face, he knew it would have turned bright red. Even more when Jeff stood up and started undressing as he crossed his room and went into the bathroom. One of his big hands rubbed the damp fur on Finn&#39;s head. &quot;Maybe next time we can save some water and shower together...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;M-maybe,&quot; a stupid smile filled Finn&#39;s face as he nodded along. He couldn&#39;t believe all this was happening. And somehow it was even better than he imagined. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good man,&quot; Jeff rubbed his head again as he stepped into the bathroom and started to shower. Finn almost had an urge to join him right then and there. He held off. Jeff was hot. Too hot. And this all still felt unreal. The feeling he was having right now just felt like a dream. He plopped down onto the large bed and took in a deep breath. The smell of their sweat and musk still stained the sheets.<br />
<br />
&#39;It was real,&#39; Finn squeezed the pillow hard, twirling on the bed as he silently cheered. However, a beep from the computer drew his attention. The screensaver had disappeared, and a program took its place. [Process complete. Please type what you would like to change.] Finn felt a bit of anger at himself for snooping, but couldn&#39;t deny that he wanted to know what was on the computer. Besides, Jeff needed help with his homework. <br />
<br />
The flimsiest of reasons would have worked and he went over to the computer. Finn clicked the &#39;Ok&#39; button and the box disappeared. He looked at the screen. &quot;Hmm?&quot; curiosity was really taking over when he saw his name typed into the program several times. But reading the sentences was odd. &#39;Finn is a small red anthro fox. Finn has is gay but still in the closet. Finn has a strong infatuation with me.&#39; Each of these sentences were accurate but seeing them typed out felt weird. Especially about his sexuality. It was a bit of an open secret, though no one ever called him on it.<br />
<br />
He did his best to ignore it and focus back on the program. [Type what you would like to change.] A bit of a mischievous grin filled Finn&#39;s face as he started to type. &#39;Finn satisfies me sexually like no one else ever has. My loads are twice as large as usual and feel better with each time I cum with him.&#39; He clicked enter. A loading bar appeared on the screen. &quot;Oh shoot!&quot; the little orange fox exclaimed. He quickly shot a look at the bathroom door, hoping that Jeff wasn&#39;t finished yet. Looking back at the computer, the green bar quickly filled up and another window popped up. [Process complete. Please type what you would like to change.]<br />
<br />
Finn clicked the &#39;Ok&#39; button again and the same words appeared at the bottom of the screen. Only his addition was there as well. &quot;W-weird...&quot; Finn stared at the screen. Then felt a strange memory worm its way into his mind. He thought back to the shower and how difficult it was to clean all that cum out of his fur. He really had to scrub at it to actually get it off. Then looking down at his shirt. A strange bit of disgust and arousal seemed to mix as he saw the massive mess coating his clothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way...&quot; awe quickly turned into a giddy laugh. &quot;This thing works?&quot; But he remembered that Jeff had used it on him. Part of him wondered how upset he should be about this. If at all. But he also didn&#39;t like the idea of anything about him changing either. He was perfectly happy that Jeff was paying attention to him now. He went back to typing into the computer. &#39;Finn has this exact app installed on his phone.&#39;<br />
<br />
The loading bar barely appeared before it was gone again. Finn went to his shorts and fished out his phone. There it was. An app with just the letter C on it in a silvery color. &quot;So cool...&quot; Finn muttered as he opened it up. It was just like it was on the computer. But that&#39;s when he noticed the additional settings. He instantly changed it to target being unaware and the user being aware. Then quickly added a line where it asked him what he would like to change. &#39;Jeff doesn&#39;t like using the Chronivac anymore. He had his fun and is exceptionally satisfied with his changes he&#39;s made so far.&#39; Finn started giggling. Excitement filled his entire body as he had such a powerful device in his pocket.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s so funny bud?&quot; Jeff stepped out without anything on. His heavy cock and balls were on full display. &quot;Hmm?&quot; With each step close to Finn, his tail swayed. He leaned down into a wet hug with the fox. His face buried into the nape of Finn&#39;s neck and he nibbled it softly. &quot;Is someone keeping secrets?&quot; Jeff&#39;s eyes went to Finn&#39;s phone. &quot;Oh? You have the Chronivac?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I--I do,&quot; Finn admitted. He wasn&#39;t sure what was going to happen next.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Hmmm... You know it was kind of fun to use but I got bored really quickly,&quot; Jeff&#39;s hug tightened. &quot;Seemed to have found something I&#39;m more interested in.&quot; He dove back into more kisses to Finn&#39;s sensitive neck sending the small man into a bit of a frenzy. Finn wiggled and writhed in the grasp, trying to get out of it. Just not very hard. <br />
<br />
&quot;Finn!&quot; Dave&#39;s voice called up to him. &quot;You guys almost done up there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff let out an angry grunt. Then released Finn. He waited a second before giving back a disgruntled, &quot;yeah!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Dave called back. &quot;Finn let&#39;s get going.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; Finn called back. He went over to his shirt, then picked it up. The massive glob of cum still on it. &quot;Shoot!&quot; he whispered the exclamation. <br />
<br />
Jeff smiled. &quot;It&#39;s funny what you do to me... Here. Take this one,&quot; he pulled out a shirt and tossed it at Finn. It had to be at least XL maybe even XXL. On Jeff it would fit tightly around his furred muscle. Finn wore a small. But he slid it on over his head. Even though it was a bit of a dress, he leapt over to Jeff and climbed up his body for one final kiss before he left. There was a bit of a surprise to see the little fox face to face causing Jeff to pause and then smile. &quot;See you tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t wait,&quot; Finn replied back as he jumped out of Jeff&#39;s grasp back to the ground and headed downstairs. &quot;See you later Mike,&quot; he said to the big tiger and headed to his dad&#39;s car. He hopped into the passenger seat and buckled up.<br />
<br />
&quot;You help Jeff with his problem?&quot; Dave asked as he pulled out of the driveway and started towards home. There seemed to be a bit of a raised eyebrow as he said &#39;problem.&#39; But it was more of the knowing smile that his dad gave, that made Finn squirm. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh... Yeah,&quot; Finn sunk into his seat a bit. He squeezed his phone tightly, thinking about the Chronivac. Wondering if he&#39;d need to use it.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good bud. He&#39;s a good guy,&quot; Dave said. &quot;Maybe it&#39;s good that you&#39;re branching out. I mean you&#39;re in college now. Make some more friends. Get drunk. Have sex. Maybe all three at once.&quot; He added another raise of his eyebrow as though he was basically telling him what to do. &quot;You&#39;ve always been such a wallflower. Try to branch out a bit. It&#39;ll be good for you.&quot; There was a bit of silence before Dave continued. &quot;And based off that little smile of yours I think you know what I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finn nodded a bit more and the faint smile on his face only grew. He tried to look away, but that only made his dad give him a few soft punches to the arm. &quot;Hey now...&quot; Finn retreated as much as he could. Obviously in the small space that wouldn&#39;t get him away from his dad&#39;s taunts. &quot;I didn&#39;t say anything about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t have to,&quot; Dave said. &quot;It&#39;s not like you&#39;re watching football for the game. Don&#39;t think I can&#39;t tell where you&#39;re looking or why you want to go over and see Mike and Finn so much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I watch,&quot; Finn shot back. His dad gave him a sarcastic &#39;uh-huh.&#39; &quot;I know you like the rams.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not exactly hidden information,&quot; Dave said. <br />
<br />
Finn laughed as he was so obviously called out. He held onto his phone again, thinking about the app. &quot;Did you want to be one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell yeah I&#39;d want to be one. I&#39;ve been following them since they were in St. Louis. I&#39;m no fair weather fan. Just cause they went to a shit state like California, don&#39;t mean I&#39;m going to drop them like that. But I&#39;m a bit too old for that now,&quot; Dave said. &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No reason,&quot; Finn said. He pulled up the Chronivac again and started to search through the settings. He made sure that he was the only one who would notice anything different. Then quickly added the few changes that he wanted. Mostly making his dad an anthropomorphic ram, while also playing for the Rams. Only for a year or two but making sure to keep his workout regime pretty well. Then adding that the rest of his life would stay the same. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm... No reason?&quot; his dad sat silently not noticing the small changes starting to happen to his face. He had always been a bit hairy of a man. A full beard always seemed to wrap around his face. But those edges seemed to be filling out even more as more hair started to grow higher than it ever had before. It wasn&#39;t like his normal beard hair, rather it was far thicker. Closer to coarse fur than just hair. It continued to grow thicker completely covering his face.<br />
<br />
Finn watched in awe as he saw the changes to his father&#39;s eyes. The blackness of his pupils lost their round shape as the black color turned more into a line. Dave wiggled his nose, almost like he could feel something changing. It was rapidly growing wider and full. The stretched out from his face. His upper lips rose and Finn could see a set of blunt teeth filling his mouth as it pushed further out in front of his skull. Round nostrils turned more into slits as his face continued to elongate into a muzzle. However, Finn&#39;s eyes instantly went to the two points sticking out of Dave&#39;s head. At an unbelievable speed they grew into horns. Bigger and bigger until they fully rounded around his ears that were now pointing to the sides instead of resting on his face. Those ears flickered a bit as Dave adjusted his seating.<br />
<br />
The older man didn&#39;t seem to notice as his body was starting to bulk up. The fat that he always had resting around his belly was rapidly turning into muscle. Each bit of it was adding onto his body as it stretched closer to the ceiling of the car. Dave&#39;s driver seat naturally pushed back as more height was added to his frame. His ram horns pressed against the roof of the car and obvious indentions where they rubbed were formed. He didn&#39;t seem to notice as the space on his side of the car was shrinking around his body. Wide shoulders rubbed up against the window and breached the arm rest. Thick bulky biceps filled in his arms and firm forearms that looked absolutely packed with muscle.<br />
<br />
Dave&#39;s already wide hands only seemed to grow wider. Thick fingers clenched the steering wheel. Each one growing wider and thicker to easily grip a football. His large hands could palm a basketball if he really wanted to. But at the tips of his fingers, little black hoofs formed around where his nail had been. They calcified and hardened into powerful appendages, making it so much easier to grip the ground as he stood in front of the other team. <br />
<br />
The same seemed to be happening to his feet as they seemed to shift out of his normal shoes. Those no longer seemed necessary as hard hooves carried his hefty weight. Finn looked up and down his father as short, ruff fur grew out of his skin. It covered every bit of his burly body. <br />
<br />
&quot;No reason? Really?&quot; Dave continued the conversation as though nothing had happened. &quot;Not because I look like the mascot?&quot; Then he bleated out a bit of a laugh. Finn joined him, chuckling far more conservatively. He&#39;d seen the mascot hundreds of times and Finn couldn&#39;t deny the resemblance. Though, there was a good 100 pounds of muscular bulk that a normal human couldn&#39;t easily get. &quot;C&#39;mon buddy. That&#39;s what all the guys said. Basically said I had to join the Rams or they&#39;d be the ones missing out.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;True,&quot; Finn said. The Chronivac pinged. He clutched the device a bit tighter, wondering what else he&#39;d want to change.</p>
