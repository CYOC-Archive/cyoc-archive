<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Eric wasn’t sure what to make of Spencer’s surprise kiss. Naturally it had caught him off guard. But did she mean anything by it? Or was that just a friendly kiss? Was that even a thing? Eric’s head started to spin a little as he tried to make sense of what happened. <br />
<br />
Inside the house, William came back from running his errands, and found Martha alone in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Where’s Eric?” was the first thing William asked once inside. <br />
<br />
“Outside.” Martha said, hiding her smirk as best she could. She’d been in the bathroom when Eric slipped outside. When she emerged, she heard friendly chatter from the backyard. Assuming it was Ben and Alex next door, she initially thought nothing of it. Until she realized one of the voices was distinctly female. <br />
<br />
Then she peered out the window, and found Eric having what seemed like a very pleasant conversation with Spencer Lawson. <br />
<br />
“Outside? Eric?” William rarely heard his younger son’s name and the word “outside” in the same sentence. Ever since he was a toddler, Eric preferred the indoors to the outdoors. <br />
<br />
“Yes.” Martha was about to say more when they heard the backdoor open and shut. Eric walked in, with somewhat of a confused look on his face. <br />
<br />
“Are you alright Eric?” William also noticed Eric’s odd expression.<br />
<br />
“Huh? Oh ya, I’m okay. Just thinking about something. When did you get back Dad?” <br />
<br />
“A few moments ago. What were you doing in the backyard?”<br />
<br />
“Nothing. Just needed some fresh air.” Eric darted upstairs after that. To which William gave Martha a bewildered look of his own. <br />
<br />
“Care to explain?” he asked, sitting down at the kitchen table. <br />
<br />
“Glad to.” Martha gave William a brief summary of her afternoon with Eric. From her heightened suspicions that something happened between Eric and Julie last night (due to their conversation over lunch), to her catching Spencer and Eric chatting in the backyard. That last bit threw William for a loop just as it did Martha. <br />
<br />
“Spencer really? I wonder why he wanted to talk to her?” <br />
<br />
“Me too. They barely spoke a word to each other last night. Of course lord knows what might have happened between the time dinner ended to the time Eric got home.” Martha said. <br />
<br />
“You don’t think he and Spencer…?” <br />
<br />
“We both know he’s still normal. Apart from that, I seriously doubt he would have done anything with Spencer. She doesn’t really seem like his type, you know? Then again Julie is hardly the kind of girl I’d expect Eric to go for so what do I know.” <br />
<br />
“True. Well, at the very least it’s nice to see Eric is making friends with Spencer. I got the feeling she didn’t have many friends either.” Whether that was because of her father’s high risk job that sent them all over the country, or because of Spencer herself William didn’t know. But the vibe she gave out screamed lone wolf, ironically enough. <br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Elsewhere…<br />
<br />
Ben and Alex were spending their Saturday afternoon in each other’s company. As it was well into the afternoon, and they couldn’t be out and about in their wolf forms during the day, the two strolled downtown looking for something fun to do. <br />
<br />
They inadvertently ran into Nate, who was walking around town with his mystery panthress. The two were stunned to see the incredible woman Nate had on his arm. Not in their wildest dreams could they have pictured her to be this exotic model. <br />
<br />
“Ben, Alex hi! Didn’t expect to see you two around.” Nate said. <br />
<br />
“What did you think we’d spend the entire day inside?” Alex scoffed. <br />
<br />
“Well ya. And more to a point in bed.” Nate smirked. Even though he was just as “smelly” as they were, he teased his friends about the strong sexual smells they had on their bodies. <br />
<br />
“It’s good to get out and stretch your legs.” Ben said, before turning slightly to address the woman to Nate’s side. <br />
<br />
“Hi. I’m Ben Twist, this is my boyfriend Alex. It’s nice to meet you.” Ben offered a hand to the panthress standing beside Nate. <br />
<br />
“Kenya, it’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I take it you’re friends of Nate’s?” Kenya smiled at the young wolves before her. Had Ben not said the two were gay, she might have offered to include them in the fun. <br />
<br />
“Yes. I live next door to the Anderson’s.” <br />
<br />
“I see. Are you by any chance related to…”<br />
<br />
“Samantha Twist? Yes. She and Frances are my mothers.” Ben got asked that all the time. It raised a few eyebrows, a werewolf the son of two werecats. But once he explained the circumstances by which he came to be their son, it made sense. <br />
<br />
“Huh. I remember your mother, Dr. Twist that is, coming to the college to give a lecture on practical psychology. It was very interesting. Had I not been such a dunce at science I might have pursued a career in that field.” Kenya said. <br />
<br />
That was news to Nate. In the past eight or so hours the only thing about Kenya he’d gotten out of her was her age, and her address. She lived in one of the apartment buildings not far from the high school. In a way, he was glad they’d run into Ben and Alex on their walk. Nate had been hoping to drag some more information out of her just by striking up conversation about anything they walked by. But Kenya had no interesting memories or life events to share until now. <br />
<br />
The two couples parted ways soon after, Ben and Alex heading towards the local diner, and Nate and Kenya going back to her apartment. Once out of ear shot, Nate started firing off questions again. <br />
<br />
“So, you’re in college?” he asked. He’d already guessed she was in her twenties. How far into them he couldn’t say. <br />
<br />
“Was. I graduated almost four years ago.” Kenya replied. Nate did the math in his head, and then almost let his jaw drop. She was at least ten years older than him. <br />
<br />
“And you’re bad at science.” Nate commented. <br />
<br />
“Well I’m not bad. But I was never good at it either.” Kenya remained tight lipped. Nate wondered if she thought of him as a quick hookup, or as a potential romantic partner. Because while the sex was gratifying beyond words, Nate did want something more. Something like what Ben and Alex had, or even Eric and Julie. <br />
<br />
Of course Nate couldn’t know that Eric and Julie’s relationship hit the rocks. Hard. <br />
