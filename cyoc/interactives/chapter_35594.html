<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny entered the room still a little shaky from her experiences outside with Mrs Styles, the taste of the combination of her own milk and pussy juice lingered on her lips. <br />
<br />
Principal Pierson’s office was a spacious room with a number of book cases and student artwork lining the walls. The lush carpet muffled the sounds of Jenny’s heels and the loud ticking clock in the corner chimed for 9:30 as she entered. The room had a long table in it for meetings and the large desk at the other end was faces by 3 leather chairs. The room was nothing like the rest of the building; it was very ornate and grand. Pierson himself was sitting behind his large mahogany desk, with a number of charts and tables showing test scores and other statistical information. He was a very serious man and despite his strangely athletic build his greying hair showed his years.<br />
<br />
He looked up from the paper when he heard jenny enter, and frowned at her as she moved across the room towards him. He nodded towards a space next to him; Jenny guessed she wouldn’t be allowed on the leather chairs considering her ‘condition’.<br />
<br />
But as she round the desk she realised that where she thought was an empty spot was actually a low stool, about 2 feet high, with a vinyl cushion on top. Jenny tried to sit down on it in as dignified a way as possible but this attempt failed as she heard the sound of her wet but cheeks squeak against the plastic pillow. This position made her feel like a naughty child about to be punished by her parents.<br />
Pierson sighed and removed his glasses, Jenny gulped,<br />
<br />
“Miss Smith, you don’t mind if I call you Miss Smith do you? Only if I call you by your first name... well I’m sure you know better than I do.” He spoke very slowly and Jenny felt even more naked than she already was in the presence of this man, especially when he talked about her new problem like that. “Anyway,” he continued, “You’re here for a dress code violation... I see no dress code violation so I presume it has already been rectified. Hmm?” Jenny nodded, he sat there in silence so she presumed she was to explain herself, she couldn’t tell him the truth so she tried to lie about it. “You see sir I was dared to come into school this morning... er... dressed sir, and well... just as a joke you understand sir.”<br />
<br />
His eyebrows raised and he leaned back in his chair, “can I ask who dared you to come into school dressed and what the punishment would have been if you hadn’t?”<br />
<br />
“I’d rather not say sir, and the punishment for failing to do the dare was...” she gave up and just said the first thing that came into her head, “Have to listen to a recording of people saying my name for 3 hours sir.”<br />
<br />
He chuckled, and clasped his hands. “You see Mis Smith with you I have a slight problem, punishing the others is easy, a dress code violation earns them having to change out of the offending garment and into something more suitable from lost property. But with you I have to be slightly more imaginative, because that is not an option.” Jenny gulped again, she could still taste herself on her lips and her pussy was absolutely pouring with juice now, she needed to get a tissue or something ... and fast.<br />
<br />
“So here’s what I propose, in this school we have always treated offenses with appropriate punishments so... Miss Smith you will hand over your shoes to Mrs Styles when you leave, and we’ll put you in a more ... suitable pair. After you have your new footwear you will report to the staff room for coffee duty at this lunch break. You can have your old shoes back at the end of the day.” Jenny was stunned; he wanted to take her shoes? Since she’d lost her clothes she’d become used to wearing just her heels and losing those would be like being stripped naked all over again. She stood to leave and sullenly walked back across the room to the door out, Pierson called after her.<br />
<br />
“Miss Smith your parents will be informed of this infraction and I will advise them to provide suitable punishments at home as well. See you at the end of the day.”<br />
<br />
Jenny closed the door behind her and Mrs Styles smiled at her, “You’re producing some real great milk today Jenny,” Jenny whimpered, “do you mind if I get some more for later?” <br />
<br />
Jenny backed away from her and then smiled politely and said, “Actually I’ll be serving coffee in the staff room today, you can get some more then.” <br />
<br />
Why had she said that?! Was she going to let everyone milk her all lunch time?!<br />
<br />
Mrs Styles smiled, “oooh goody I can’t wait! Was that your punishment?”<br />
<br />
“Part of it yeah, I also need to change my shoes for a more ‘suitable pair’?” Jenny said in a way that conveyed the sense that she had no idea what that meant.<br />
<br />
Mrs Styles smiled again, “I’ll just get them, and I keep them over here. Ever since you first arrived we decided we’d need a different approach to punishing you so we brought these...” She produced what looked like a pair of ballet slippers but they were bent in a really funny way and had what looked like a cuff attached to the heel of each. Jenny stared in disbelief. “Sit over here and we’ll get these on” Mrs Styles guided Jenny to the chair she had been sitting on earlier, the wet towel felt sticky against her but cheeks.<br />
<br />
Before Jenny could protest Mrs Styles had removed her heels and was replacing them with the strange ballerina shoes. Only then did jenny realise how they worked, the sole was rigid forcing the foot into a position that it would be in if it was wearing a 7” heel. Only there was no heel, which forced the wearer to stand on the tips of their toes without support! Not only that but the leather cuffs surrounded her ankles and were locked in place meaning Jenny couldn’t remove them without the key, and she had no idea where that was!</p>
