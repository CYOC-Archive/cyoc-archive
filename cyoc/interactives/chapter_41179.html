<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harken knew of a spot at the school which was away from prying eyes so he wouldn't reveal that he had magic. He concentrated on that spot and in seconds he was there. It was a strange feeling disappearing from one place and appearing at another. It felt like each of his cells were being torn apart causing a tingling feeling then being shoved back together. Well he supposed that he would get used to the sensation the more he did it. He was amazed to see that he was clothed in what he had planned to wear today. Then again maybe he shouldn't be surprised by it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Harken&quot; a familiar female voice said behind him.<br />
<br />
Harken spun around to see Miranda Moss leaning against one wall of the school. She was eighteen, had jet black hair that came down to her mid back, emerald green eyes, stood five foot five, had B cup breasts, and a slight hourglass shape. She was wearing a white sleeveless tank top, a white pleated skirt that came down to mid-thigh, and a pair of white sandals. Her white book bag and white purse were sitting on the ground at her feet. He had been friends with her since first grade and had considered asking her out. &quot;Hi Randi&quot; he said trying to appear as normal as possible.<br />
<br />
'Did she see you?' Infel asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I did see Harken appear out of thin air&quot; Randi said.<br />
<br />
'She couldn't have heard me' Infel said surprise evident in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I did hear you&quot; Randi said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you talking to?&quot; Harken asked hoping he had a quizzical look on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;The woman in your head&quot; Randi replied nonchalantly. &quot;I can see the magic coursing through your body so don't try to pretend that you're your old self. What's the woman's name anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harken knew that this wasn't good. He had to do something to diffuse the situation. He started making motions in the air and barely audible words came tumbling out of his mouth. Before he could finish however Randi's lips moved and she flicked her hand at him. Immediately he stopped moving and speaking. No matter how hard he tried he couldn't move or speak.<br />
<br />
'A paralysis spell' Infel said with a note of awed respect in her voice. 'It's been so long since a chosen one had been caught with one of those. What's more, she pulled it off faster than I've ever seen without hesitation.'<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you&quot; Randi said. &quot;Harken, I'm not your enemy. Now I'll release you but you need to stop what you were doing. If you continue then I may be forced to take it up a level and I really don't want to do that to you.&quot; Her lips moved again and she flicked her hand at Harken again.<br />
<br />
Once the paralysis was lifted Harken asked &quot;How did you do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have magic too&quot; Randi said. &quot;I've been able to use magic since I was six.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have?&quot; Harken asked astounded. How could he have not known that?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; Randi said simply.<br />
<br />
&quot;How come I never knew?&quot; Harken asked a little annoyed. Here he had just gotten his powers and already someone knows about them. Randi had been able to keep her's secrete for twelve years.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have been very careful&quot; Randi said. Suddenly she stiffened and her eyes went wide. &quot;Oh no&quot; she said in so soft of a voice that Harken barely heard her.<br />
<br />
'There's a creature heading to the school' Infel said horrified. 'This one is too powerful for you at this time.'<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to get everyone out of the school&quot; Harken said thinking frantically. &quot;Perhaps if we pulled the fire alarm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm on it&quot; Randi said. Instead of dashing off to pull the fire alarm she closed her eyes and snapped her fingers. Her lips moved and she made a little motion with one finger. The air around them rippled and she said &quot;Don't move and don't say anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
'She's hidden you' Infel said.<br />
<br />
A couple seconds later the principal came over the intercom and said &quot;Attention all students and faculty. This is such a fine day that I hate to keep everyone cooped up in the school. So please, go home and enjoy your day off. Have a good day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Students started to file out of the school like rats abandoning a sinking ship. Harken couldn't understand what was going on until Suzy and her friends walked past. &quot;No way!&quot; one of Suzy's friends said as they passed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's true&quot; Suzy said. &quot;I was in the office when the bomb threat was called in.&quot;<br />
<br />
It couldn't have been a coincidence that a bomb threat was called in right when they needed everyone out of the school. He opened his mouth to say something but Randi held up a finger to silence him. He couldn't believe it, she still had her eyes closed. After a few moments she opened them and said &quot;Everyone's out. We can go take care of the evil now.&quot; She muttered a few words and twirled her finger in the air again. The air stopped rippling and she moved toward a side door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn't we go in a different door?&quot; Harken asked. &quot;This door can't be opened from the outside.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't have the time&quot; Randi said. &quot;The police and bomb squad will be here in a few minutes and this is the closest door to the evil.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Randi used magic to open the door Harken took out the mirror and asked &quot;What creature is it Infel?&quot;<br />
<br />
'One that you can't handle' Infel said sadly appearing in the mirror. 'I suggest you don't go in.'<br />
<br />
&quot;You want me to run!&quot; Harken said shocked. &quot;I thought I was supposed to be a hero. I thought I was supposed to protect this town.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't have to run&quot; Randi said holding the door open. &quot;It may be true that you couldn't take this evil on by yourself but you have me by your side.&quot;<br />
<br />
'She could be leading you into a trap' Infel said. 'It just can't be a coincidence that the creature is coming here now.'<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't have much time left Harken&quot; Randi said. &quot;You have to decide what you're going to do. Will you fight the evil alongside me or stay here?&quot;</p>
