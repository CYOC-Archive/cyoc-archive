<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Adam was overjoyed as he suddenly felt what could of been the start of his only transformation, the start of his new life. &quot;This is it! I&#39;m starting to transform! I&#39;m becoming an animal&quot; Adam yelled as there was a silent wait that lasted about half an hour, but nothing happened.<br />
<br />
Noticing that something was wrong, his dad was staring to wonder if the serum was actually active and not a dud that he decided to go and check it out. His mother on the other hand, started to go and start the day by making breakfast as it was pancakes and sausages. Adam was a bit disappointed and went back to his room to get dressed, considering he ran around the house naked. Once dressed as he ate his breakfast, he got a call from one of his friends to wish him a happy birthday.<br />
<br />
The day went as far as any day goes, even on his birthday that his next door friend and neighbor gave him a surprise birthday party. All of His friends came with a cake, presents, a pinata, games, balloons, a small petting zoo, even a two person suit as they were dressed up in a pink horse with a horn on the head... A unicorn. Despite not getting what his parents had given him on his birthday, or so he thought, Adam decided to have a bit of fun while celebrating his birthday his friends set up for him. But getting back to the two person unicorn horse suit that half of the parents in which Adam&#39;s friends were also dressed up for this party as this was the list of people who were dressed up as animals, and what costumes they were for while on the job.<br />
<br />
Two men - pink unicorn suit for basic acts tricks while acting like any horse with a bridal on the head mask, like someone who&#39;s into pony petplay.<br />
<br />
Man - Easter Bunny suit (something like critters 2 film) for fun egg hunts while acting like a pet bunny who&#39;s into pats, hugs, and pictures for the kids to take with him.<br />
<br />
Women - realistic kangaroo suit for basic kangaroo acts that despite being in a cramped enclosed space of a small farm house, she has very little space to hop and jump in.<br />
<br />
Man - gorilla suit for handing out balloons, acting like a clown, and sometimes dance on the dancing floor with the kids.<br />
<br />
Women - a black latex cat style costume that covers the sculp head down to her ankle and wrist as they were covered in black boots and claw like gloves. Although she has a rope like tail that she looks like a black cat style of Catwoman from Batman. she was mostly in the kitchen cooking while serving the party guests with juice, pizzas, cake, chips, fruits, hotdogs with buns, fries, baked beans, a few vegetables upon carrots and broccolis, even a few cookies and frosted crackers. She later comes out to set up for the movie scene tent area at sun set hour.<br />
<br />
Women - squirrel suit for dancing on the dance floor while the light goes off on on as her husband is handling with the dj music. She was also a teacher and helped them learn how to dance their own way.<br />
<br />
Man - velociraptor suit for handling the dj music while his wife was dancing on the dance floor. With the mask on, it was hard to see through the eye holes while also balancing his tail feather for it was a little heavy that he had to bend and hunch over like a real raptor would. Although it was his job, he would also get the kids attention to sometimes play around with them while not being to scary for them.<br />
<br />
Women - although she wasn&#39;t in an animal suit, but she was wearing a blue jean overalls with a white sleeve shirt while wearing a straw hat as she was in charge of watching over her animal pals for the petting zoo. She mostly brought out were ducks, chickens, goats, a young calf, a dalmatian, along with a few border Collie and husky puppies, not to mention guinea pigs, piglets with their mother, and a few ponies for the kids to ride on instead of the two person suit of a unicorn.<br />
<br />
Women - gray seal for the swim pool area while at times playing a game called place the ball on the seal&#39;s nose as she interacts with the party guests. Although she was wearing a swimsuit and a snorkel mask under the suit, she was in a high school mascot costume from Anderson&#39;s as she had it ordered with the function of having it being waterproof for protection of juice stains and other things that might damage it with liquid items.<br />
<br />
Everything was almost an overwhelming experience as there were a few uninvited kids to Adam&#39;s party, but did bring gift cards and presents for he gladly invited them in to enjoy the party while some brought extra swimwear to those who didn&#39;t bring theirs. There were also a few people of the neighboring streets and town to call the police as they issued it a dismissed case and didn&#39;t do much than just a small talk, before driving off to handle real police cases. Over then a few small issues of other people in the town disliking the idea of a party being thrown for just a 9 year old kid&#39;s birthday, even went like it was the best birthday of his life as the party quickly started at nine and was a long hour of a party to reach sunset hours.<br />
<br />
Of course, some of the costume users did had a bit of fun on their own way that the wife of the bunny did make out in the bedroom guest area for it was her idea in the first place. The husband of the black cat lady was so turned on by her looks that he did get clawed up by her, but made up for it in a sexist way possible as they were following the idea of the Easter Bunny man and his wife... Through sex. The kids did wondered as to where they have gone, but was told to not go into the house for a while that there were a few porta potty stalls for this reason.<br />
<br />
The party was great to see it went even longer than expected, so great that it was now five o&#39;clock as it was supper time for everyone was having fun. Although, the petting zoo had to pick up and return back to the farm and back home. The two person unicorn horse suit had to also go because of work issues on tomorrow&#39;s day, plus they have family to take care of that this includes their wifes. The gray seal girl left by six for she was in charge of teaching school&#39;s swimming class that even the man in the gorilla suit felt like he had enough to call it a night to head home.<br />
<br />
The only people who were still in animal costumes that stayed longer were the latex black cat girl, the squirrel girl with her husband of a velociraptor, the Easter Bunny as this included his arrived wife, even the realistic kangaroo suit the girl was still in for they visited and petted her long enough all day to have her fall asleep. eventually, everyone forget about her being in the suit the next day to call animal control to take her away and send her off to the real zoo that this included herself to even think like a real kangaroo. Little did they each know that anyone who was in costume for the party, even the kids with their hand made mask from paper plates as there&#39;s a wolf mask to a raccoon mask, they would become real beast by Adam&#39;s contact by his touch.<br />
<br />
As it came time set up the tent at 6:30, the cat lady and her friends had it set up within ten minutes for the movie that night was featuring Sheep & Wolves from 2016. Although it was maybe an hour and a half long that it was soon 8 o&#39;clock, yet it was soon bedtime as everyone had to go home to get some rest for tomorrow for this included Adam himself. Adam did stayed up late till an hour later for it was now 9 o&#39;clock as he looked out the window for the clouds finally moved away enough for the moon was now clearly out, and it was a full moon none the less. With no less then a minute to stair at the moon for it was a beautiful sight that suddenly, Adam felt a jolt of energy shot through his entire body. He started to feel his body bulk up slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on now?&quot; Adam said as his voice got deeper as the changes continue. He thought for a moment to realize that the morning potion must be working on its effect by now, so he quickly stripped naked again. Once off that he looked down at his body, to look back at the moon again.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t believe this, his birthday present was finally happening to him. It didn&#39;t take him a genius to know he was turning into a were as he will be back to normal by sun up, but what kind of were was he though?<br />
<br />
(This is where you decide on Adam&#39;s transformation of a were he&#39;ll be as. He could be a werewolf, a werejackal, a weredragon, almost anything you can think of as this includes a wereunicorn. Feel free to add your own story line ups as there is a few listed down below to choose from. Again, thank you and happy reading.)</p>
