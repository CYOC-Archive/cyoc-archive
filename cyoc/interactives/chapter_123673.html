<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Sophie was just leaving Roland&#39;s room at the hospital when she was stopped by a tall man in a dark black suit. He wore dark sunglasses and she was immediately reminded of the mythical &#39;men in black&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I help you?&quot; she asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sophie, may I have a word with you?&quot; asked the man.<br />
<br />
Sophie backed away, taking comfort in the fact that her friends were around to support her this time.  Her previous encounter with a stranger who knew her name ended badly.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you know my name? Who are you?&quot; Sophie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you just come with me, I can explain everything,&quot; said the man, reaching a hand out to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, back off buddy, &quot; said Malice, slapping his hand away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, the girl asked you a question,&quot; said Jessica.<br />
<br />
The man sighed. He knew he should have done this when she was alone.  But he didn&#39;t want to scare her.  Now he had no choice. He reached into the breast pocket of his jacket and pulled out his credentials.  He flipped them open for the others to examine.<br />
<br />
Sophie looked down at the black leather wallet with more curiosity than fear.  The badge identified the man as a member of the National Security Agency. Amusingly, even in the picture of his photo id the man was wearing sunglasses. He was also careful to keep his thumb over his name, blocking it from her view. The man flipped it closed to prevent further inspection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does that answer your question?&quot; he asked dryly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to me.  What is NSA?&quot; asked Malice.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want with Sophie?  She hasn&#39;t done anything wrong.  She is the victim!&quot; said Jessica angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, &quot; said the man. &quot;We need her help.&quot;<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you crazy?  Forget it!  No way! I mean, you have to know what she did ... not just to me, but also to Roland. Everyone knows by now!&quot; said Sophie, pointing up to the television on the wall of conference room.<br />
<br />
A large television sat in the back of the conference room.  The sound was muted, but she could see another news broadcast about the attack on the screen. It had been all the talking heads on television had been discussing since the attack.  Once again, the footage from the sky drones showed the Rhino squad successfully apprehending Heather.  It was followed by pictures of human and Animalian representatives shaking hands with members of the Rhino squad.  The rumor was that they going to receive medals for their heroic actions.  The scroll running along the bottom of the screen repeated the party line - how cooperation between humans and Animalians had led to the successful capture of a dangerous rogue criminal. <br />
<br />
They never showed any footage of Roland or her, probably because the drones had arrived too late to record it.  Or maybe it was too gruesome to air on television.  Sophie didn&#39;t care.  She didn&#39;t want credit or fame and she certainly didn&#39;t want to be reminded of the attack in graphic detail.  She was just glad that Roland was going to be okay.<br />
<br />
The man reached up and turned off the television.  He sat down at the table next to a very excitable older man in a white lab coat. Sophie was the only other person in the private conference room in the hospital.  Malice and Jessica were not allowed to attend the meeting, shooed away in the interest of &#39;national security&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you don&#39;t understand, my dear.  We desperately need her help with the Thylacine Project.  And she refuses to speak to anyone but you, &quot; said the man in the white coat pitifully.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not just that,&quot; said the NSA man.  &quot;We need to know exactly how she was able to get a hold of the Animalian virus.  We know her contact in the lab, but we need to identify the whole network she used to transport the virus.  We need the names of the people and companies that helped her smuggle it out of the lab and overseas.  It&#39;s possible that someone else may have secured some of the virus or that someone else may try to use the same network.  Surely you don&#39;t want anyone else to get injured by a rogue uplifted animal or human?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man didn&#39;t tell Sophie the whole truth. The government was desperately afraid of another country weaponizing the Animalian virus.  Other governments were already demanding access to samples of the virus.  China and Russia were being particularly vocal, rattling their sabers in frustration. But the government had refused to give in to anyone&#39;s demands so far, fearing an attack by a foreign army enlisting creatures like Heather - or maybe something even worse.  The NSA man was under intense pressure to secure the virus and plug any potential leaks.  Heather&#39;s little attack had made his job all the more difficult.  The Animalian virus was now worth a fortune on the black market, much more than the pitiful price Heather had paid Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;But why me? She hates me!&quot; said Sophie.<br />
<br />
The NSA man sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, I don&#39;t know why. But does it really matter when lives are at stake?&quot; asked the NSA man.  &quot;We recognize how hard this must be for you, the risk you are taking.  But this is important, Sophie.  You have a real opportunity to help people, maybe change the world.  But we also care about you, Sophie.  We aren&#39;t just going to throw you to the wolves, like some kind of primitive sacrifice.  We will take every precaution to ensure your safety. She will be chained at all times, with an armed Rhino guard just outside the door...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d have to be alone with her?&quot; asked Sophie incredulously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunately, yes.  It&#39;s part of the deal we are working on.  We cannot have any audio recording devices in her cell.  But the cameras will be operating at all times, closely monitored by trained professionals ready to respond at a moment&#39;s notice,&quot; said the NSA man. &quot;Listen, I know this will be difficult. I wouldn&#39;t ask if I didn&#39;t think it was absolutely necessary. But the government will be grateful.  And it would like to reward you for your help.  I understand you have an interest in the Thylacine Project.  That you would like become a pterodactyl, but not a pteranodon, if I am not mistaken?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;How did you .....&quot; began Sophie with shock.<br />
<br />
The NSA man smiled.  <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s our business to know things, &quot; said the NSA man.  &quot;If you agree to help, you would essentially become a member of the Thylacine Project team, working alongside some very influential scientists.  Experience like that might help get you an edge in your application. A good word from the right people can go a long way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes, &quot; said Dr. Stein with enthusiasm.  &quot;I would personally recommend you be placed at the top of the list, provided you pass the physical and mental requirements.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie perked up a bit a that.  Could it be true?  Could she really get to be one of the first new test subjects? Could they really uplift her with Pterodactyl DNA?<br />
<br />
&quot;What would I have to do?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Both men visibly relaxed, grateful she was considering their offer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just talk with her, write down everything she says.  Anything about any special procedures she used. We are particularly interested in her DNA extraction technique and the method she used to preserve the DNA ...  &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And any friends or contacts she had in Costa Rica.  Preferably people involved in the shipping industry....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, sounds easy, &quot; said Sophie sarcastically. &quot;Anything else?&quot;<br />
<br />
The two men looked nervous. Dr. Stein stared down at the ground, avoiding eye contact.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there is one thing, &quot; said the NSA man.  &quot;Heather&#39;s trial will be very soon.  She has agreed to a plea deal, but the sentencing will be up to the judge.  We need to insure that she ends up in a mental health facility.  If she ends up in prison or gets executed, we will never be able to get access to her body or her mind.  We have lined up a number of pretty good mental health experts to testify about her diminished mental capacity, but the technical stuff doesn&#39;t always play well in court.  We need use the human angle in order to garner some sympathy.  We need a character witness, someone to testify on her behalf .....&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie slammed her palms on the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, and I guess that person is supposed to me? You must be even crazier than she is! &quot; yelled Sophie. &quot;Forget it! I hope they lock her away and throw away the key!  I hope they fry her for what she did to Roland!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie pushed away from the table and stood up, turning her back on the two men. The man slowly stood up, walked over and put a hand on her shoulder.  He could see that she was crying a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sophie, I understand your feelings.  You are hurt and angry.  But you aren&#39;t thinking very clearly.  You are letting your emotions cloud your judgement.  Killing Heather will not do anyone any good.  It won&#39;t help heal Roland and it won&#39;t mend the growing rift between humans and Animalians.  It will just make it worse, creating more fear and animosity, &quot; said the man.  &quot;But if we use Heather, instead of killing her, at least some good can come from it.  Her body and mind hold the key to advancing the Thylacine project by years, if not decades.  Without her, it may never be possible.  Destroying her doesn&#39;t just punish her - it punishes everyone who would benefit from this research. Not to mention the good it would do if we could prove that even an uplifted monster like Heather could successfully be reformed. Or that a human like you could forgive her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie sighed. The man continued to gently pat her on the back.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a difficult choice, especially for a girl your age.  We won&#39;t force you to do something against your will.  But I think you are a good person, Sophie.  And I believe you will do the right thing, regardless of how hard it might be, &quot; said the man.<br />
<br />
The man slowly walked back to his seat and sat down.  Sophie remained silently standing, her back still facing the two men, as she quietly contemplated her choices.  Finally, she turned to face the two men.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I&#39;ll do it. I&#39;ll talk to her, &quot; said Sophie.  &quot;But I can&#39;t promise anything else, not until after I meet her face to face. Can you set up a meeting?&quot;<br />
<br />
The NSA man and Dr. Stein smiled at one another.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we can arrange that,&quot; said the man.</p>
