<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brian sadly waved at the new does as they were came from the transformation chamber that was the only way in or out for guests hidden in the rock wall. &quot;Hey girls, there&#39;s a large rock we use as a gathering place. I think you&#39;ll all have lots to talk about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Better make room, there&#39;s gonna be lot more of us,&quot; Sighed one new doe. &#39;I have no one to blame but myself. I signed that pledge, no one forced me to.&#39; <br />
<br />
++++<br />
<br />
There were does who were there in the park for completely separate reasons who were watching the show, and found themselves being turned on by the sight of the clashing bucks. And of course for the instinctive need of the bucks to prove to all the does watching that they were worth whiles stock. <br />
<br />
Vinny didn&#39;t care, Vinny cared about Vinny. And he proved that he was NOT just some idiot with a good face like Chad and managed to outsmart his first couple opponents. Then he matched Naoki. <br />
<br />
Unlike the other bucks, Naoki&#39;s body wasn&#39;t chiseled to perfection. He looked downright overweight! The others had laughed at him, but he had kept a straight face the entire time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look on the bright side Naoki, now you&#39;ll get a pretty body as a doe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The pledge I signed meant I have to serve the Order as a doe instead of a buck for the rest of our stay here. Nothing more. If I lose, I&#39;ll serve the herd to the best of my ability, as I&#39;ve pledged I will, it&#39;s the only honorable thing. But are you willing to do the honorable thing if you lose twice Vinny?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I lose? Look. Just forfeit now, I don&#39;t want you to get a heart attack.&quot; Vinny was a lot of things, but a sadist or a killer (even an indirect one) wasn&#39;t one of them. <br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Naoki put his hands on his knees and assumed a more squat position. <br />
<br />
Vinny sighed. &quot;Fine. Just don&#39;t blame me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be dishonorable to blame you if I lost. My father was part of the order of the stage too, I&#39;m simply doing my family proud.&quot;<br />
<br />
The buck began to feel an instinctively growing sense of wrongness that bucks were referring and judging the fights rather than does deciding who was the winner and who was the loser for each fight. But they had to make due for now since none had offered their service. <br />
<br />
One of the other bucks made the gesture. &quot;Begin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vinny was ready for a mighty glacier, or a tub of lard, not the orient express. <br />
<br />
Naoki knew SUMO?! All that flab hide muscles maybe even more nasty than the ones the rest of the Order stages were packing! <br />
<br />
And Sumo fighting . . . was ironically a rather good fighting style to have for this kind of contest. As Vinny realized as he was stuck looking at the sky . . . with both horns intact unlike Chad. <br />
<br />
Naoki bowed to his knocked down opponent. <br />
<br />
Vinny would have growled if he was still human. No way was he ending up like Chad! <br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings Jeremy-Sama, will you be entering this tournament as well to unite the two herds? You are not a pledge, so you&#39;d not be legally obligated to become a doe if you are disqualified.&quot; Villy heard Naoki said. Oh no. <br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
Naomi sighed and pressed the button on the intercom next to the house&#39;s front door. <br />
<br />
&quot;WHO TRESPASSES UPON THE LAIR OF THE MINOTAUR?!&quot; Boomed a voice that even made Charlotte tremble a little.<br />
<br />
Naomi stood her ground. &quot;We don&#39;t have time for theater, Minotaur.&quot; She said in a no nonsense tone. &quot;It&#39;s Naomi and a guest of mine.&quot; A video camera next to the door swerved in their direction. &quot;We have important information about bribes, insider trading, and under the table deals that [i]aren&#39;t[/i] part of any scheme of yours that could seriously jeopardize the cause.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; . . . My maid will be there to be greet you shortly,&quot; Said the same voice but with much less volume.<br />
<br />
&quot;Charlotte.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Naomi?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What cause?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll tell you later.&quot; Naomi didn&#39;t feel like explaining to Charlotte right now that Terry had been for the most part correct. While there was no mind control drugs or genetic tampering to make them chose their new forms over their humanity, the Company had used every sociological trick in the book to make every guest who stepped into the park want to step out of it in their new bodies to build the social front the Management didn&#39;t want to risk their success for but still reap the benefits of being able to become non-humans and keep their wealth and power. <br />
<br />
The large double doors in front of them unlocked and swung upwards to reveal a PINK cat girl anthro dressed in a maid uniform custom made for her species and made for extra ventilation for her fur. <br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings!&quot; She grinned. &quot;Welcome to the house of The Minotaur. I&#39;m Usagi, and yes I&#39;m fully aware of the irony of my name. I was born with it. Please follow me.&quot; <br />
<br />
The cat girl turned around began to walk down the huge hallway, everything had been custom made to suit the extra large size of its own. Her tail swayed almost hypnotically behind her. <br />
<br />
The two canines looked at each other and followed the cat girl maid. They past by a few others as Usagi led them on. <br />
<br />
After having heard of some much corrupt business Charlotte found herself asking. &quot;You&#39;re all willing right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? . . . &quot; Usagi blinked and looked at them not slowing down her steps. &quot;Our species and gender is spelled in black and white in our service contracts. We&#39;re turned to normal when our contract with our master expires.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He doesn&#39;t . . . try to force himself does he?&quot; Naomi said, just because she trusted the Minotaur not to be part of this human-male conspiracy didn&#39;t <br />
mean he wasn&#39;t a male. <br />
<br />
Usagi looked at them like they were crazy. &quot;Do we LOOK like cows-women? And the master is honorable. He doesn&#39;t act that way. I can assure you. You think I&#39;d be working for a rich bull-man if I was worried about THAT?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. I apologize.&quot; Naomi found herself saying.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright. The master and company will see you immediately.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And company?&quot; Naomi asked as Usagi pushed the large (like everything here) doors in front of them opened, bowed to the owner of the house hold, walked backwards out of the room. <br />
<br />
There was the Minotaur, naked as they were and laying on a extra supported couch. He was reading a copy of Atlas Shrugged. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Naomi,&quot; he said flatly, &quot;It&#39;s been a long time.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello to you too.&quot; Naomi said with a flat face. <br />
<br />
&quot;I certainly never expected to see you here Naomi.&quot; The two dogs turned to see another cat anthro, but this one was all woman, and was [i]mostly[/i] naked, except for the jewelry she was wearing that was not even trying to hide anything private. She was looking over a stock portfolio. Naomi realized she was another of the Management (none of the ones at the top of the company&#39;s food chain were human anymore). <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think you met Miss Cleopatra before Naomi.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;At least she didn&#39;t change her name to Bastet.&#39; Naomi thought. &quot;Greeting madam,&quot; She said and bowed slightly.<br />
<br />
Not only were the Management no longer human, they would never be human again. As part of the Management&#39;s pact with each other: their human templates had been erased from the data base. <br />
<br />
&quot;So what is this business about [i]our[/i] business threatening The Cause? WOuld you say it&#39;s severe?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very.&quot; Naomi said honestly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then I think it&#39;s best we share with our brothers and sisters, don&#39;t you Minotaur?&quot; Cleopatra asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Said The Minotaur and pressed a button hidden underneath a panel of fake marble that made of the majority of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Madam! I came here because The Minotaur is the only remember I management I felt I could trust!&quot; Naomi blurted out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Believe me husky, our brothers and sisters would have no reason to betray The Cause. We&#39;re all business-creatures who know better than to betray long term goals for short term gain.&quot; <br />
<br />
A number of plasma TV screens, either turned on, changed what they were displaying, or slid out of predictable hiding spot. One was a projection on an indoor water fall.<br />
<br />
The Minotaur truly loved his theater. <br />
<br />
As the minutes clicked by, a new figure appeared on each of the screens. None were human. And all were naked or effectively so.<br />
<br />
One screen showed a stallion and mare anthro-horse, both brown with a diamond shaped white patch on their facial fur. Naomi caught the name of the woman as &#39;Epona&#39;, (which had been the name of the protector goddess of horses long before being used in pop culture). Two sat sat next to each other as equals and Naomi realized they were a married couple.<br />
<br />
One screen was blank that had an egyptian motif to it that Naomi assumed belonged to Cleopatra when she was not visiting.<br />
<br />
Another made Naomi gasp! The figure being projected on the waterfall, HAD GILLS AND FINS! It was clearly a woman, her hands were webbed and her ears were fins and her eyes had an inner eye-lid and her skin ton was greenish. Naomi couldn&#39;t see much of her lower body, but she could swear it ended in a tail! And she seemed to be under water. She was tapping on a water proof keyboard that produced text and a female voice for her. <br />
<br />
Another showed of all things an male anthro gorilla, sitting in a plush chair in a rather stereotypical corporate office looking rather calm and collected.<br />
<br />
There were a half dozen others, each a different species, some of templates that Naomi didn&#39;t know EXISTED. <br />
<br />
But it was the twelfth screen that made her jaw drop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hiiiiii Naomi!&quot; Jessica cheered from her screen. &quot;Oh, and can you call me Ninisina here?&quot;</p>
