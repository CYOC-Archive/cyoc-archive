<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He ought to give Joe an experience of what true manhood was like. At least, that is what Jeff had contemplated, the scheme appearing in his head as he went about to click some edits onto the Chronivac. He had to admit, the device was amazing at carving and creating an entirely new reality, a new massive body for what used to be Joe, and he wanted to go further in... But thinking on it, stealing Joe&#39;s time and handing him John&#39;s age seemed almost, selfish, if not for the fact that time had to march on at some point. <br />
<br />
The world, or rather, the Chronivac would work out logistics in order to make the changes he punched in to exist. Jeff supposed for what the present was now, he may as well have some fun with Joe, or at the very least, let Joe have the fun. What harm could be if he simply made him out to be a stronger father? A better father? None, and as Jeff looked over at John&#39;s dazed confusion and realized another venue of experimentation, he decided to see the fruits of his results as he began to type information and allowing Joe to have some much needed time to himself.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Joe slowly found himself rising from bed, naked and particularly groggy as he stretched his arms and rubbed his eyes. The day was Friday, Cheryl had work, the kids had to have had school, and he was off from work again thank god. Of course, work didn&#39;t concern him, the Chronivac had already begun to forge weaved webs of paths Joe could take, and his new goal of bodybuilding his new found mass had become the stepping stone it needed to kickstart the new pending changes. Groaning, Joe cupped his massive pec and gave it a heft, scratching at the hairy slab and realizing with his free time, he could spend it with some exercise, maybe a jog.<br />
<br />
 Tired eyes lingered at the clock reading 9:00 am and Joe sighed a breath of relief, he had the day alone and he could do as he pleased until the family arrived home. Unbeknownst to Joe, however, was the Chronivac essentially taking time out of the equation and applying its editing to Joe only, the other occupants need not be affected nor be attending the &quot;experiment&quot; and as such, Jeff had taken John out to better figure out their predicament while Cheryl attended her job as always. As he yawned and flexed his arms for emphasis, Joe contemplated between slowly shifting into his bed once more to reintroduce himself to his body, or move on with the day, but as his stomach growled for his breakfast, Joe grumbled and opted to save his session for later.<br />
<br />
He fixed his posture, sitting up straight and rigidly as he felt slightly off balance, it was as if he could see more from his view, but chalked it up to failing to keep his posture right for some years. &quot;Kids, stress, all of it weighs down if you aren&#39;t careful...&quot; Joe murmured to himself, wiping his eyes once more to instill some sense of stability as he peeled the covers and slowly got out of bed. He didn&#39;t mind the soft creaking of the floor as his larger feet had found purchase in the adjusted slippers for the man of the house. Joe could feel himself well with pride as he felt his entire body wake up slowly with him, stepping into the mirror as he flexed and treated himself to a one-man show meant for him and him alone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, oh yeah, work on the tri&#39;s, add in some bi&#39;s and hoo, don&#39;t think Cheryl&#39;ll keep her hands to herself again...&quot; He spoke, confidant in watching his once previously chubby, herculean physique bounce on display. It felt primal, no, manly to worship himself, he told his thoughts as he felt his hands glide up and down the rugged canvas. &quot;A man&#39;s got to have pride in himself, got to keep himself in shape to keep up...&quot; Joe reasoned, feeling his toned body and beginning to feel his arousal tempt his thoughts. He wanted it. He wanted all of it, to feel himself be worshipped up and down by a firm pair of hands that knew they wanted him too. He wanted to fill out so much that a person couldn&#39;t help but give him a feel just to tell it was all real. <br />
<br />
As he leaned back, fingers gently touching his growing member, Joe hissed as he remembered it wouldn&#39;t help anyone if he stayed in bed all morning taking care of &quot;personal&quot; business. He wasn&#39;t meant to be this pent up, but it practically felt like years since he had a real good rub out... And he cursed himself mentally as he had showered and lathered up his body with a musky body wash that wouldn&#39;t let his hands leave any inch of his body. Brushing his teeth shortly after, Joe looked into the mirror and scanned his handsome feature as he smirked cockily in the mirror&#39;s reflection. <br />
<br />
He felt accomplished, as if life was set for him so quickly, and he&#39;d just have to coast with the best of it, though he had to admit... The thought of being a father, a husband, and a soon to be massive man was truly going to get him off if Cheryl didn&#39;t throw herself at him when she got home after a rigorous workout.<br />
<br />
He gently prodded his cheek and noticed how they had retained some vitality in them, and his entire jawline covered in a faint stubble that reminded him to shave. Joe sighed, deciding against it as he lifted the razor, Cheryl would dig his rougher exterior, and where&#39;d she feel it most, would count the most, he chuckled, flashing a double biceps and feeling slightly heavier as he walked back into the master bedroom and threw the towel onto the rack as he looked back at the full length mirror and marveled at his lower body. <br />
<br />
It had appeared that his glutes were carved, smooth sloping circular mounds, the two of them, but where they were round, &quot;...They&#39;re gonna need more mass&quot;, Joe thought as he pinched the muscles and watched them go from a slightly flabby bounce to a more firmer hold.<br />
<br />
He opened his drawer, formerly John&#39;s drawer, and found instead of white briefs or colored boxers, Joe had gotten himself an ample supply of jockstraps, and even a small collection of posers or swimsuits. He pulled one up, a shiny pink one, before considering the accessory before shaking his head and pulling up a classic red jockstrap to wear. He&#39;d stick with classic, and when Cheryl came home... She&#39;d have the pick of the litter, he mused.<br />
<br />
Breakfast was the same, albeit the same as it could get for a newly &quot;born&quot; 44 year old man who began to become as hungry as a young lion. Joe had eaten an omelette with 4 eggs, a shake to drink, and a side of sausage links to start his day... And he could feel himself divided between eating so much to fuel his workout, to almost eating too little to fuel his body. As he fished for a pair of shorts and found in his drawer a black tank top that gave a pleasing view of his new canyon like chest, Joe smirked as his eyes drifted back to his old friend, the mirror. <br />
<br />
His previously prominent crow&#39;s feet receded, and his wrinkles had become smoothened over, but he was still Joe, fuckin&#39; handsome Joe. Little Joe twitched at his reflection, and grunting in agreement, Joe leaned back for another unscheduled meeting of the minds.<br />
<br />
By early noon, Joe had slipped into his sneakers and entered the garage, finding his workout equipment, strangely still with the new &quot;metal&quot; smell as he adjusted the bench to his body and loaded up the weights. The tank top clung to his body as he tested the bench press, lifting the bar enough to slide himself under and begin his exercise without much delay. Choosing a light 60 lbs, He felt slight resistance as he finished one set, then almost nothing on the second set, to his confusion, he sat up and found himself wondering if he had simply been working too hard before and needed a new addition to challenge himself. <br />
<br />
Getting up and unloading the weights, he didn&#39;t notice the newly created heavier weights appearing next to his foot, neatly organized for a seasoned weight lifter, one Joe was easily mimicking as he lifted a 30 lb weight with one hand and loaded it, just as a hardened glove materialized on his previously naked appendage. Joe huffed, grabbing another 30lb weight with his other hand, it too became a matched set as it was encased in a black fingerless glove, and he set to work, lifting another 2 sets. More weight began to appear on his press, Joe grunting as he continued to lift the bar with some struggle before easily surpassing the next challenge until he went to failure, slick with sweat and feeling the draft of a now opened garage door.<br />
<br />
Had he opened the door...? Yes, he must have, he was so into the workout he must have not realized how hot he was getting and let open the draft to cool down. Pulling himself up, Joe breathed in deeply, grabbing a water bottle that had helpfully found its way near him, and drank from it greedily, shucking his tank top to capture some of the cool, balmy air. Deciding he had enough of the bench press, Joe lifted himself off after a few minutes of rest and stumbled onto his weight rack that had been &quot;hidden&quot; under a tarp that had previously held some knickknacks of another man. Nothing to be missed, as Joe hefted a 45 lb dumbbell and began to lift it up and down in curls as he felt a challenge arise. As he continued, Joe felt his shoulders push farther out, happy that he was finally working out the kink in his shoulder from the exercise when in reality his shoulders seemed as if he was hiding a small melon underneath them. His arm followed suite, plumping up nicely as they began to bulge and grow defined, veins pulsating as new mass was being built simultaneously with fervor.<br />
<br />
Joe groaned as he finished his next set, attempting lunges as his lats flared out and tightening the once loose tank top that had clung to his physique. Chalking it up to tension and being rusty to the workout, Joe powered through like a true soldier, his back broadened that his silhouette took to the stimulation the Chronivac was giving despite the mismatch of exercises. Joe took his rest minute, unconsciously cupping the engorged chest that had beautifully sloped up from the abdominals that were taking form from his paunch. As he breathed deeply, gloved hands slammed down onto his thighs, the lower body jolted into the process as they had taken the impact of Joe&#39;s act and bunched up under his guidance, the newly ballooning muscles quivering as they grew to mighty proportions. <br />
<br />
His calves took their cue and had rounded up, mimicking the tree trunk thighs that decorated and tightened his changing sport shorts to a loose but skimpier short shorts. Feeling energy well up into him again, Joe fell back onto the bench press, little Joe attentive to his workout, but as it tried to garner attention, Joe was more than ever focused on finishing his last rep on the press, he was going to be all the man he needed to be. Today would be the day he&#39;d make sure of that.<br />
<br />
As Joe determined to finish his workout, his titanic body was laid bare for all to see, and as neighbors politely looked away or realized their acts of voyeurism and moved on, Joe could feel eyes linger on him. He enjoyed working out for both his benefit, and to see the ashamed, envious face of a single father that was jogging by his home only to stop and gawk at the beast finishing his workout. Yeah, he wanted him. Joe chuckled as he pulled himself up, winking at the jogger and watching him awkwardly run away with his tail between his legs. <br />
<br />
He could get used to this, and used to it he would, as he closed the garage door and pulled himself into the house to prepare for the rest of the day. He heard the door close upstairs as he entered from the opposite side of the kitchen and assumed the boys were home once more. Joe tugged at his tank top as he shook it for air, the sweat still slicked on his skin as he went and prepared a new protein shake, it wouldn&#39;t be long before Cheryl came back and would give him her patented kiss before inviting him to a meaningful night yet again. As he set the blender, he felt a familiar softness wrap around his tight waist and heard a husky purr vibrate in his ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone&#39;s looking real fine, Joe...&quot; She teased, caressing his groin as she tried to maneuver around his bulk. &quot;Real big too...&quot; She laughed, Joe looked around and found Cheryl ogling his larger back and flexed a mighty bicep for her to see. &quot;Like what you see, babe?&quot; Joe prodded, watching her &quot;ooh&quot; and &quot;ahh&quot; as she placed her arms on the surging mass. &quot;My my my... Looks like my young stud&#39;s really been pumping iron, eh?&quot; Cheryl cooed as she rubbed his large biceps. Joe flinched slightly, &quot;I&#39;m not that young, Cheryl...&quot; Cheryl looked at him oddly, before smiling and leaned in closer as he crossed his arms. &quot;That may be so... But for a 38 year old, you really look your best, handsome...&quot; She giggled, winking before turning on her heels and grabbing a water bottle before going her way to retire to a shower or bed for a nap. Joe mused as he leaned against the counter, brawny arms still crossed over his heroic chest. 38 years old... Was that right?<br />
<br />
He felt at one point it was both older, yet, radically younger than that number... But as he tried to think on it, he couldn&#39;t find any more reason to fight what he couldn&#39;t answer. Joe sighed, drinking out the rest of his shake and finding a black snapback waiting on the Kitchen chair. His mind still questioning his age, Joe brushed his bed head hair and took the cap and put it on backwards, feeling slightly familiar thanks to the hat that now allowed his previously messy hair to form underneath. <br />
<br />
He decided not to question his feelings further, and while they still lingered uncomfortably, Joe began to make preparations for dinner, setting packs of sausage to defrost so he could have dinner done in a timely manner. Believing it be best to join Cheryl in the shower, or better yet, to take a nap himself, Joe made his way to the stairs as he began to conform to the reality&#39;s altering, feeling himself adjust slowly to his new bulk and life as a 38 year old man that was practically a bodybuilder in every way but name. It was just the path the Chronivac took for him out of countless possibilities, and perhaps, in a way, this was the best as he was left unaware to the sheer might the device had carried, being the creator that made Joe into what he was today.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Jeff smirked as he saw the Chronivac delivering its completion notification on the monitor. Realizing the success he had from the tweaks of his edits, Jeff had his work cut out for him. And devilishly, he acknowledged that the occupants of his home were more than ample supplies for his further changes. With gusto, he figured...</p>
