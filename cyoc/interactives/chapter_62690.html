<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>The day had started out good for Rick. Dan had invited him out to the coast to stay at his place for a week and this morning they set 
sail on his yacht. Everything was going great until the pirates showed up. It happened so fast that Dan wasn't able to get a distress call 
off. He had hoped the pirates would just hold them for ransom but that wasn't in the cards. Instead they forced him and Dan to watch as 
they took turns raping Dan's wife Catherine and their two daughters, ten year old Hanna and six year old Jenna. He wouldn't forget their 
screams for the rest of his life which wasn't going to be much longer. Dan and his family have already been sent to the bottom of the 
ocean, the girls the first ones to be thrown overboard with iron balls attached to their feet with iron chains.</p>
<p>"Well you're the last one," one of the pirates said as he tied the chain around Rick's ankles. "Say hello to Davy Jones for me." He 
laughs as he throws the iron ball and Rick overboard.</p>
<p>Rick had taken a deep breath before hitting the water but he knew he was dead. There was no way he would be able to get out of 
the chains before he ran out of air and drowned. In fact after a minute he couldn't hold his breath any longer and he inhaled water. As 
water filled his lungs he started convulsing from the lack of oxygen. Just as he thought he was going to drown he felt a sharp pain 
behind his ears and his body started getting oxygen again. He couldn't figure out why but he was grateful for it.</p>
<p>As he settled onto the bottom he saw Dan and his family laying there already having drowned, their vacant eyes staring at him as if 
accusing him. It was an unsettling feeling.</p>
<p>Rick felt the chains binding him loosen and he was able to wriggle free. However he also wriggles out of his clothes giving himself a 
view of his body. How he could see down here he didn't know but he could. What he saw was a younger body devoid of the body hair 
he was used to. From the way his body looked he guessed that he was ten. Things didn't stop there though as his dick shrank right 
before his eyes until it disappeared. His nuts had pulled up into his body and he watched as a slit appeared between his legs. As he 
was looking at his new equipment a couple of mounds started to push out of his chest. They didn't get very big but there was no 
denying that they were breasts. They looked about the same size as Hanna's which she had proudly told him were a double A cup. He 
reached up and felt that his hair had grown longer and he guessed that it was probably down to his waist when out of the water.</p>
<p>He didn't know what was going on or how long this would last. All he knew was that he was a girl now and that he should probably 
start thinking of himself as one. It might well be that Rick was dead so she had to think of a new name for herself. Looking at Hanna 
she decided that her name would be Hanna as long as she was a girl. She had thought that her changes were done but they weren't 
finished yet. Blue scales started to form about halfway below her bellybutton and work their way down. Her legs started fusing together 
as the scales reached them causing her new genitals to be pushed out toward the front though they were also covered in scales. Once 
the scales reached her ankles her feet flattened into fins and spread out on either side of her. She realized that she was a mermaid now 
and that the pain before were gills forming. She couldn't understand why there would be pain for that but not for the rest of the 
transformation.</p>
<p>Now she had to figure out what to do with her new life. She should probably see if there were any other mermaids around. If there 
were they would be able to help her adjust. Then something seemed to be calling to her. An image of a man flashed through her head 
and the calling seemed to increase a bit giving her a direction to go in. Should she follow this calling or ignore it?</p></p>
