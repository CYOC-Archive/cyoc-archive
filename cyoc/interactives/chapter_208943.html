<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Roger felt himself shrink. Or more accurately, he saw the brunette start to loom over him as the floor got impossibly near fast. As the spell stopped, he fell down on his butt and looked around, stunned. Everything was out of proportion! The girl was a giant now. Roger attempted to stand up but his muscles just did not respond. He did manage to hoist himself up on his two feet by pushing with his hands upon the floor but he fell back on his tummy after not even three wobbly steps. As he lied on the carpeted floor, he took full measure of his body. His new puny body. Chubby. Weak. Uncoordinated. His fingers unable to do anything. And even though the fall wasn&#39;t that hard at all, he starts bawling. He hurts and he doesn&#39;t want to be a baby! That&#39;s not possible! <br />
The girl just giggles and picks him up, cooing.<br />
&quot;Oh, is little baby fussy? Don&#39;t worry, Mommy&#39;s here.&quot;<br />
She takes Roger to the backroom of the store, which is much different. All kinds of boxes filled with various things are there. She places Roger on a table and rummages around, all the while talking, as Roger hiccoughs and calms down.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, little Roger. I&#39;ll explain. I&#39;m a witch, you see, and this is my shop. I specialize in giving people entering rewards or punishments. My main power is to know what bad things people have done. And the good too, although I must say since you always were aa big bully, it&#39;s mainly bad. Then, depending on the toy the customers grab, I decide which spell will brig them happiness or a lesson.&quot;<br />
She smiles widely at him.<br />
&quot;And when you grabbed the rattle,I just knew I had to throw a regression spell at you fast! What a naughty boy you are!&quot;<br />
Roger whimpered. It couldn&#39;t be possible! It just couldn&#39;t! <br />
&quot;You are now an adorable nine-months-old baby. And you&#39;ll be slimmer and a tad more handsome as you grow up. The little belly you had will just remain as a tickle magnet in your babyhood.&quot;<br />
To emphasize her point, the witch walked over and tickled Roger&#39;s belly, resulting in high-pitch squeals and a pouring out of giggles, much to his shame. He just couldn&#39;t help laughing, racked by the most delicious sensations. And he couldn&#39;t do anything about it! The witch them turned around again.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll give you the right clothes, settle some administrative technicalities and then, you&#39;ll be off to meet you new family. Aren&#39;t you happy?&quot;<br />
Roger could only gurgle his protests. What? A new family? What was that horrible witch on about? His protests fell on deaf ears as she arrived with bottles and a pieced of cloth. To his horror, he understood it was a diaper! She laid the cloth under your butt and then sprinkled it with talcum powder and lotion, spreading it all gently and generously.<br />
&quot;Now, baby won&#39;t have a nasty mean rash and turn his chubby bum like a baboon&#39;s,&quot; she cooed, pinching Roger&#39;s butt cheek.<br />
To his utter mortification, he squealed happily. It tickled! And worse, he had enjoyed feeling the products and hands on his tiny butt! But the witch wasn&#39;t over yet. She deftly gathered the corners of the diaper and secured them with a safety pin. Roger now looked like an old-fashioned baby. But it was only the start. The witch selected a bib with a cartoon bunny rabbit, a frilly blue bonnet and blue and pink booties. Afterwards, clapping her hands in satisfaction, she held a mirror out to Roger. He was mortified. He looked like a real baby with typical a baby attire seen only in popular images or old cartoons or movies! He started screaming his frustration again but the witch pressed a pacifier in his mouth and tied it ribbon to the back of his head.<br />
&quot;There,&quot; she smiled. &quot;Much better. And what a cutie you are! Yes you are!&quot;<br />
She tickled him under the chin, which made Roger laugh uncontrollably.<br />
&quot;Now, the administrative papers.&quot;<br />
She waved a bit in the air and official-looking papers appeared. With another flourish, a pen appeared in her hand.<br />
&quot;Now, what should we call you? I don&#39;t like Roger, so...&quot; she frowned.<br />
Then her eyes lit up.<br />
&quot;I know! Timmy! It&#39;s so cute, don’t you think? Not Tim, it&#39;s too adult. Timmy, like that your new parents can see you as the chubby little darling that you now are all your life.&quot;<br />
Roger, now Timmy, could only move helplessly as he was given a name he did not want at all. It sounded like  sissy&#39;s name!<br />
&quot;Your two daddies will love that!&quot;<br />
Roger started at that last piece of info. What did she just say? Were his new parents a gay couple? A gay guy couple? No! No, no, no, no! That couldn&#39;t be true! It could not! <br />
&quot;Is poor baby not happy to have two daddies just for himself?&quot; the witch mock-pouted. &quot;Well, one mommy or two would have been bad for you, since you always made fun of women and treated them badly. You always were a little brat to girls, making fun of them. So you must not like women very much, right? Well, fear not! With two daddies, the problem is solved. And since you were extremely mean and intolerant with male homosexuals, I think it&#39;s only right that you make two of hem very, very happy.&quot;<br />
The witch added that the two men could sign the rest of the papers and she prepared the means of Timmy;&#39;s transportation. An old-fashioned wicker basket with frills and plenty of cushioning. Of course, little Timmy was getting incredibly fussy. Well, the last part of the spell would take care of that. The witch went to him.<br />
&quot;Now one last thing before we go.&quot;<br />
Roger was furious. He didn&#39;t want to go! He did not want to be raised by two fags! He&#39;d be a little brat for them, all the time! And he&#39;d make their lives miserable! And...<br />
&quot;Do you know what my other great power is, Tickle Timmy?&quot; she smiled.<br />
He stared at her after she elicited quite a few more giggles for poking at tummy and underarms. <br />
&quot;I&#39;m also called Mesmero,&quot; she whispered, tapping and kissing his nose. &quot;So let&#39;s make you a special little bundle of joy for your new daddies, shall me?&quot;<br />
She let a pendulum dangle in front of Roger&#39;s eyes and it was impossible to tear his eyes rom it. The witch&#39;s voice became melodious and soft as she explained to him he just a little baby, innocent and so, so eager to please. He loved teddy bears and soft toys and being hugged and held in people&#39;s arms. Her words became his own thoughts. After all, it was fun to play with plushes and toddle towards awaiting arms. Back when he was a baby, the first time, he liked to play with lots of toys. And then he had switched for video games. But... But why? Soft toys were so much better. And the witch was right, it would be so much fun to return to his first year, when he had no worries  and when being tickled was such a pleasure and when big strong arms were there to protect him and love him and make him bask in love... When he was cradled, safe and warm and with a belly full of yummy food, listening to lullabies and sweet voices in protective arms and against a warm chest with a big beating heart... When he could sleep and be cuddled and listen to fun stories.... Thinking about napping and listening to a twirling mobile made him feel sleepy, in fact. As he closed his sleepy eyes, the witch picked him up, wrapped him in a blanket decorated with teddy bears and settled him in the wicker basket. Timmy was deep in sleep when she stepped out of her magical shop and went to see the two expecting fathers.<br />
<br />
Timmy was exactly what they had hoped for. Even more, actually. They thanked profusely the social worker who came to deliver their little baby angel, making them sign the adoption papers and happy to take in a poor innocent who had been the result of the tragic mistake of a teenage mother. And the baby was certainly deserving of his nickname Ticklish Timmy. He loved being tickled. He loved being rocked to sleep and held in the large arms of his two daddies. And he was such a good eater! After a meal, his belly created a bulge that was impossible to resist tickling! He slept all through the night a long as he was snuggled with teddies or a daddies. Adorable! And the first time he fed, instead of grabbing a bottle, he went straight to the nipple of the bare-chested father holding him. His face when he had realized no milk could come out, no matter how much he suckled! Nothing quite as enchanting, clearly!<br />
As for Roger, the memories of his past life receded ever more from his brain, more concerned by much more interesting impulses. He did wake up from his new states once in his playpen and had thought of escaping these two deviant crazies wanting to play house with him in the worst role but as he approached on all fours the door of the playpen, his mind had been distracted by a big blue teddy bear. He had thought that touching its soft fur could not do any harm, even if he shouldn&#39;t give in to such childish thoughts. Five minutes later, he was kissing and hugging it, on his way to a sweet dreams and the reason why he should escape such a pleasant place utterly forgotten.</p>
