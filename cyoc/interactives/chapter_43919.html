<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben's lip trembled in fear and anticipation of the unexpected change.  He could try to stop the software from finishing its work by closing the browser, possibly even shutting down the laptop, but there was no guarantee it would work.  This was a website after all.<br />
<br />
...96%...<br />
<br />
All of the data was probably already being processed server-side.<br />
<br />
...97%...<br />
<br />
He had already experience one error so far.  Trying to interrupt it might only make it worse.<br />
<br />
...98%...<br />
<br />
&quot;Then again...&quot; Ben grunted to himself, flexing a huge leathery bicep.<br />
<br />
...99%...<br />
<br />
Maybe it wouldn't be so bad.<br />
<br />
...100%.  Transformation commencing.<br />
<br />
The pain started small, in the center of Ben's sternum.  Realizing he'd already grow over a foot and a half and that shutting down the laptop would probably be a bad idea, he moved as quick as possible.  He grabbed the laptop and it's power supply and tried to run out of the bathroom.  Not accustomed to locomotion in his new form, he stumbled, almost falling.  However, it was enough for him to gore the door frame and painfully slap his tail against the wall.  He continued moving as fast as he reasonably could, but he couldn't help goring another wall, tripping shoulder first into yet another (putting a sizable hole through the drywall), and scraping the carpet and flooring with every hoof-fall.<br />
<br />
The trip had taken 20 seconds at most, but by the time he made it to the living room and plugged the laptop back in, it was as though he had been skewered through the chest.  Ben buckled in pain, dropping to one knee and grabbing his chest.  &quot;The first change was all pleasure.  No pain.  What the hell is happening?!&quot; Ben thought to himself. &quot;This must have been something the software had never encountered.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben had a fairly high tolerance for pain, bolstered by the strength he had gained with the transformation into a minotaur, but as the change began and his ribcage began to shift, he almost passed out.  Extra ribs began growing near the center of his sternum, forcing the upper ribcage and collarbone higher.  Having dropped to both knees at this point, Ben had to constantly, painfully readjust his hands on the ground as he grew.  The pain was blinding as bone after bone force him to crawl forward with his hands while his knees remained motionless.  Once it had began, the process only took about two minutes, but it had felt like an agonizing eternity.  As the skeletal growth stopped Ben adjusted his head as best as possible, fighting his deltoids, to view the change.  He had a brief glimpse of a too-tall torso, his waist seeming dizzyingly far away for having only grow about a foot, before the changes began again.<br />
<br />
This time muscle and flesh felt as though they were being shredded apart across his over-sized chest.  A disturbing shifting was occurring across his entire pectoral region.  A horizontal line in the center of his chest burned as though it had been sliced open.  Ben longed to move his hand there, both to satisfy the horrific itching that accompanied it and to make sure there wasn't a gaping wound.  However, keeping his hands planted firmly on the ground was all he could do to keep from collapsing as his elbows and knees trembled violently.  A minute later the disturbing shifting of his tissue was subsiding, but without pause there was a newfound pain on each side of his torso, just below where his pectoral muscle had seemingly ripped in half.<br />
<br />
Unable to open his eyes out of suffering at this point, Ben wondered how he had reached this point.  He was trapped in his thoughts, oblivious to the world around him.  Had he acknowledge the pain he was enduring it would have driven him insane or unconscious.  He prayed for release to anyone that would listen, and rage to-wards Transformation.net and its creators filled him.<br />
<br />
As his anguish subsided ever so slightly, he came back into awareness.  Only moments had passed since his pectorals had ceased their modifications, and he was now aware of a growth where his sides had begun to burn.  A growth perpendicular to his torso.  In spite of the stress clouding his mind, and yet unable to see what had actually happened to his chest, he had a moment of clarity.  Longing for the change to be completed, Ben began to flex his chest, not pushing downward at the ground, but outward.  He realized he had been struggling against the transformation in his anxiety, unsure of what was coming, but now he was working with it.  The pain was still excruciating, but his new awareness made it tolerable.  Bone and muscle had grown significantly in the moments he had nearly blacked out; the same moments he had stopped actively fighting the alterations.<br />
<br />
Slowly, his pushing took on meaning as his center rib shifted to take on collarbone-like qualities.  Ben continued pushing, feeling the change had passed its apex, as his new arms emerged from his sides and took on definition.  His upper arm first, as the humerus bone snapped into place; biceps, triceps, and tendons attaching themselves and growing to match Ben's upper arms.  Then the lower arm.  The radius and ulna snapping painful into place with the elbow, sending shock waves of pain through Ben's body and almost causing his to collapse again.  Finally the hands and wrist painfully took their place as each joint snapped into place with sickly popping sound.  Another wave of pain hit him as the last of the nerves in his new appendages came to life, and his heart skipped a beat as newly formed arteries connected to his circulatory system.  Goosebumps raised along every pore as capillaries flooded with fresh blood.<br />
<br />
The room was still.  The change was complete.<br />
<br />
Ben slowly opened his eyes.  His vision was blurred by tears that had forced their way out during the excruciating process, and some of the fur on his snout had been slicked from it.  As his sight cleared, he noticed a trail of drool which had escaped through his clenched teeth during the change, ending in a puddle underneath where his head had ended after his change in height.  His jaw hurt from painfully grinding his teeth, but he had managed to not scream or shout during the process.  Tears in the carpet ran vertically next to pool, freshly scratched as he had attempted to clutch the floor for security.  Exhausted from what had just occurred, Ben slowly pushed himself up, placing one of his upper hands on the wall for support as he shifted each hoof under his bulk.</p>
