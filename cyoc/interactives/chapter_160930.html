<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There were no words capable of describing the amount of dread I felt, and every mild inch my body moved was a constant reminder that it wasn&#39;t mine. The only thing that felt natural were the tears in my eyes, at least until they slipped out and traversed and defined the much different shape of my cheeks. Nothing was the same. I couldn&#39;t even cover my own face to hide my emotions, as my boy upbringing had taught me without feeling the differences. I practically ran my longer nails through my eyes I was so unaccustomed to the shape and distance of this body, from point A to point B -- it&#39;s arms, height, even the lengths of her fingers -- everything, it was all wrong!<br />
<br />
I think the worst part of it all, was my less than sympathetic companion, who had only just now put my own penis way to talk to me. &quot;Come on now, it&#39;s not that bad. I wonder if it&#39;s the hormones? You are a full fledged woman now.&quot; I didn&#39;t even have to remove the hands from my eyes to know he had spoken those words with a quirky smile on his face. Slowly moving my fingers from my eyes, I was greeted to my own face, with curled eyebrows, sure, but a smile more built on amusement than sympathy. It was as if his expression was saying... &quot;I had to put up with that for 41 years, now it&#39;s your problem. Get over it.&quot; In-fact, you were 100% certain that&#39;s what he was thinking, as he quipped... &quot;It&#39;s a pain, but at least you didn&#39;t have to deal with it for more than a few minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W--why are you so happy about this? Can&#39;t you see I hate this?&quot; I asked her while pushing this long hair of hers out of the way as it bellowed over into my eyes. It was so telling that even now, rather than dip into a somber forgiveness, he simply quirked his lips to the side and thought about how to answer. I knew my mother had been looking forward to this -- it was obvious. Yet I somehow wanted to believe it was pressure from my father, but it was clear that from the moment it was announced, she was eager. I even remember the delight on her face when it was her name that was drawn after mine. She never even feigned sympathy, yet I tried to overlook it. She even unveiled her body to me the day of, as if to rub in and haunt me that that old body would be mine and not hers.<br />
<br />
Now HE stands before you, shrugging and once more smiling along with it. &quot;I get to live life all over again as a handsome boy, what&#39;s not to like about that?&quot; Spoken as a matter-of-fact, as if there couldn&#39;t even be another side of himself he could be portraying. <br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of mother are you? Don&#39;t you feel guilty at all for... for turning me into you!?&quot; I exclaimed at her, but all I was returned was this blank stare. &quot;First off *Mom* we discussed this, my name is David. Second, why would I? It was random, it could have just as easily been your sister, or your father or whomever.&quot; Of course what he said were facts, but they were so cold and heartless. &quot;You don&#39;t feel guilty at all for... for taking my age, or my sex, or... EVERYTHING!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, we HAD to do it for money, we needed it. Am I happy to switch with you? Yes, I am, I&#39;m super excited about being young again, it feels AMAZING. Put yourself in my shoes -- heh, should be easy now -- but, imagine you had the ability to swap with your son David, me, you&#39;d be delighted, wouldn&#39;t you? That&#39;s how I felt, and how I feel now. Listen, getting old sucks, and getting old as a woman is even worse, everyday you start to feel like you could have some huge medical issue, and your body just doesn&#39;t work right. I mean, just listen...&quot; He stopped himself and pulled me up to my feet for the first time. As I rose onto my tiny new feet, I felt one of my ankles crack, then twice in my back, which was sharp and painful, to the point I had to let out a sharp noise. <br />
<br />
Seeing me bent over, trying to get comfortable standing up straight, with one of my eyes shut from the sudden sharp pain, he simply smirked and said... &quot;...I rest my case.&quot; Standing there, you knew what he was trying to say, and you started to understand why she would be delighted to leave this body behind. Even if your mother was still attractive for her age, the body itself just did not feel comfortable at all. &quot;Try and tell me you feel comfortable. I bet your chest feels like it&#39;s being dragged down to the center of the earth because my -- your already big breasts decided to grow a size with each kid, I bet your feet are still hurting from yesterday, and you have this kink in your back that just NEVER goes away, like you have a crack to crack, but you can just never work it out. Am I right?&quot; Everything he said was the exact annoying details you were picking up on, and it was just the surface layer. <br />
<br />
&quot;I stopped liking being a woman after my first kid, and I started hating being old around thirty-three.&quot; He said, leaving you only wondering how to respond. You got it, you understood where he was coming from, but you also couldn&#39;t. &quot;I&#39;m your own son, you should at least feel bad about turning me -- or at least not continue to smirk like that!&quot; My statement crumbled to simple annoyance at his continued amusement at my constant squirming in HER damn body.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I know I shouldn&#39;t be rubbing it in, but when you&#39;re truly happy, it&#39;s hard to hide it. Besides, I feel like an advocate for all women and mothers, when I say that... we&#39;ve all been kind of wishing a boy and especially their son would have to deal with our problems just once.&quot; He said with a satisfied smirk as he panned his gaze up and down the body he used to inhabit, taking extra interest in your livid face. &quot;You really do want this? You want me to be miserable!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, in a few days, I think you&#39;ll understand it better. All those times you talked back to me, even calling me lazy and &quot;just a stay-at-home mom,&quot; I bet you wouldn&#39;t have made those comments if you knew the body I had to lug around. This is a good experience for you. You&#39;re part of the reason that body looks and feels the way it does, you know.&quot; He had a response for everything, but it always sided with himself. &quot;I&#39;m not your only kid, why doesn&#39;t Mariah and Lucas have to go through this!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I could let you all experience being me, I would. Except...&quot;</p>
