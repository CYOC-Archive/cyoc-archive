<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Okay ladies, pack it up!” Ches calls out as she ventured outside wielding a broom, swatting at the menagerie of animals that had gathered outside her store until they high-tail it out of there. A few swipes of her managed to scare most of them off, save for a dog, her mouth agape, panting in the throes of heat.<br />
<br />
Was it rabid? Ches didn’t have a clue, but it might explain the inexplicable behavior of this thing. Ches stabs the bristle-end of the broom towards the brave fox to shoo it away, the vixen slowly retreating, her hindlegs taking small steps backwards until a she suddenly springs up. For a moment Ches catches the glint of desire in the Doberman’s eyes, enough need for the boy inside that she’s willing to stand up to that fearsome broom. Ches flinches as she braces for the lunging canine to strike her, but nothing comes of it. The animal disappears into thin air, not a trace left behind.<br />
<br />
“What in the…” Ches double-takes, spinnng around twice just to make sure her eyes didn’t deceive. “God, I’m just tired, that’s all.”<br />
<br />
The 28-year-old convenience store attendant headed back inside and manned her post once again, leaning against the counter as she watched the boy peruse their selection of energy drinks. She flashed a thumbs up at Zack letting him know he’s not gonna be bothered by those weird animals anymore, receiving one back in return. She shouldn’t have offered him some free food, but seeing the kid happy is worth it.<br />
<br />
Ches rests her cheek on her hand as she keeps a close watch on the boy, feeling somewhat responsible for him now that she’s done so much for him tonight.<br />
<br />
 “… Friday girl, get on her… dah nah-nah, nah nah nah… give it up ‘n’ get me… dun-nuh nuh… crank up the radio…” She hums along to the awful pop song playing in the background of the store.  Ches idly nods her head along with the music. She must have heard that stupid song millions of times and still didn’t really know the lyrics, but trying to mumble along with it is a welcome respite from the mind-numbing night shift at the 7/11.<br />
<br />
The hum of the incandescent lights mix together with the whir of the nearby hot-dog spinner, Ches zoning out again as her eyes lids droop.<br />
<br />
“Really… what was up with that dog.” Ches mumbles under breath, unable to get the thought of it out of her mind. What could have given that thing the nerve to try lunge at a human ten times her size? Was it really after Zack? “Heh… wish I felt like that about something…” She chuckled, groaning a little as she feels a cramp in her belly.<br />
<br />
“Damn… shouldn’t have snuck that jalepeno dog…” she sighs, holding her tummy as it rumbles with a tinge of pain. Ches can’t help but start sweating in her store-issued polo shirt, her lips parting as she blows out a huff of warm air to cool herself down. She shifted her hand from her cheek, undoing the top button on her shirt as she felt a bead of sweat trickle down her chest, dribbling in between her breasts. It sorta helped, but for some reason, sweating just didn’t seem to cool her off. <br />
<br />
“Jeez. Did they fix the heater?” Ches asked, wiping her forehead, as her tongue lolled out a few times, dribbling a few stings of drool on the counter. “The damn thing doesn’t work for half of winter, then it turns back on like it’s making up for lost time…” She turns around to check on it, only to find the radiator is just as cold and broken as ever.<br />
<br />
“Uah…” she sighs, leaning over the counter again to resign herself to her sweaty fate for the rest of the shift, wondering if this was karma for stealing a snagging food from the store. She crosses her arms and contemplates what’s made her sick, only for her eyes to train back towards her only customer. She stands up, sauntering over to Zack as he compares the size of a bag of M&Ms to a bag of Skittles. <br />
<br />
“Just take both!” She giggles, “It’s my treat, really. I can pay for stuff if ya wanna get a lot!”<br />
<br />
“You really wanna do that?” Zack chuckles back at her offer, “If you’re offering me all the stuff I can carry home, I might make you go broke!”<br />
<br />
Chess pats the boy on his back, snickering back at him. “I’m good for it! Don’t you worry!” Maybe she would live to regret it like Zack said she would, but for some reason she really wanted to give stuff to him. Seeing him smile back at her made her feel really good, a tingle shooting down her spine like a dose of dopamine was just injected into her back. Her tongue lolls out proudly as she tries to dissipate more heat, wondering how she could up her generosity to get even more of that lovely feeling. As Ches thought out a idea, another heavy belly cramp wracked her over-heated body, making her embrace her upset stomach.<br />
<br />
“Oof, one to many jalapeno dogs you like, huh? I’ll get some Pepto Bismol too!” Zack jokes, only to see Ches wasn’t laughing back. “Oh, hey… are you alright?” He asks, looking worriedly at Ches.<br />
<br />
“Mnphf… fucking… stomach ache…” Ches surmises, lifting up her shirt just enough to reveal her sweaty tummy. It certainly looks a bit bloated, the skin blushing a reddish hue as Ches rubs it. She’s not fat per se, but a few too many snacks swiped from behind the counter here and there did give her a bit of pudge. “I think I… just caught a stomach flu or something. D-don’t worry too much, I think I can make it through my shift, little guy.”<br />
<br />
Ches suddenly lets out a hot chuff of air as she feels the boy’s hands softly knead at her tummy flesh, her thoughts racing as she feels Zack trying to soothe her.<br />
<br />
“Yeah… you do look a bit bloated.” Zack comments, running his hands along her sweat-soaked belly. “You’re sweating like a pig too, maybe you really should call off.”<br />
<br />
Ches doesn’t say anything, frozen in place by the sensation of irrational delight flooding her mind. Having him rub her belly is the best thing ever – there wasn’t anything to compare. Her legs starts to twitch as she starts audibly panting, a smile appearing on her face again as her butt begins to waggle like an excited puppy.<br />
<br />
“W-whoa… that feels really good!” Ches huffs loudly, beaming down at the boy. “You’ve really got the magic touch! Go on – rub it more, it really helps!”<br />
<br />
Zack nods, not questioning helping his friend even if it’s a little weird. Ches seems to like it a whole lot too, her whole body is twitching and shaking under the attention of his hands, the convivence store clerk’s waggling butt giving way to a nascent nub of flesh pressing out from the back of her jeans.<br />
<br />
“Yes… keep going…” The 28-year-old gets a dreamy look in her half-lidded eyes as she sinks lower and lower to the ground. Her belly heaves as she hyperventilates with deep breathes, her tongue lolling out as she suddenly drops to the floor, sprawling out as she presents her tummy to Zack.<br />
<br />
She’s in heaven, feelings of simple bliss hijacking her executive functions as she thinks about the dog she was shooing off from before, wondering if she tried to get to Zack just so he could pet her like this. If so, she understands now. It really is worth it. She zones out again, slipping into a Zen state for a few wonderful moments, just imaging she was that dog. Imaging she’s Zack’s good girl.<br />
<br />
“Ughh… Ches!?” Zack’s hand swiftly retracts backwards as if her belly had just turned into a burning stove. He’d just touched something weird. Breasts… but not like girl breasts, plump little mounds of softness running in two rows down her belly, tipped by erect nipples. He’s never seen girl tits in real life until now, but he knows that they aren’t supposed to be like this. A velvety tidal wave of black fuzz envelops them, giving her peach-colored skin a dark, velvety recoloring.<br />
<br />
“Hah-… why’d you stop?” Ches looks up at Zack, scooching across the floor towards him, offering her animal-teat-ladened belly to him once again. “More. Do it more.”<br />
<br />
Zack backs away slowly, a look of shock in his eyes as he stares into hers, watching her blue eyes shift into a dark brown, two pointy ears peeking out from underneath her auburn hair.<br />
<br />
Ches didn’t seem to notice at all, the woman giving the twelve-year-old boy a pleading look as she picks herself back up on her hands and knees and approaches him.<br />
<br />
“Pet me. Please…” She pleads, looking at Zack like an addict, managing to stand back up onto two legs, yet shaking like she’s never walked before.<br />
<br />
The boy doesn’t speak, backing off more as he spots further changes rack her body. Her shoes crinkle off her feet as two distinctly canine paws peak out from underneath her jeans. They look big, as if they’re sized up to fit a fully grown woman. Beneath her jeans, Zack sees bumps and grooves poking hard against the fabric, as if her bones jutting out, reshaping into something less than human. It’s then Zack realizes something’s terribly wrong. He takes more steps backwards, trying to wrest his eyes away from the horror show of Ches’s changing body only to feel the cold glass of the drink freezer press up against this back.<br />
<br />
Zack gasps in panic as he feels ice-cold goosebumps tingle down his spine. His eyes dart this way and that, trying to find a place to retreat to as the mutating Ches closes in. Despite all those changes to her legs Ches can still advance towards him as a biped, the panting woman thrusting her belly right up against the young boy’s head, those sweaty budding canine tits slapping  against his face with a wet “plap”.<br />
<br />
“Hah - YES!!” She whines as she feels Zack’s skin smoosh against her new bestial skin. “Touch me! Please… I’ll be good… I’ll be a good girl!”<br />
<br />
A long, dark-fuzzed tail slips from back of her jeans as it starts whipping around with wild excitement. Her tongue dips down lower as her face expands to accommodate it, her head crackling and snapping as her nose and mouth extrude out into a fuzzy canine muzzle. But as Ches’s humanity gets distorted and warped, she doesn’t show the slightest bit of care at all. She’d tasted the bliss of having Zack touch her and it’s all she wanted now. Through hot, lusty huffs and pleasured yowls, she’s begging to change more – begging to turn into something she thought Zack would want.<br />
<br />
Her belly softly rubs against Zack’s face as she pins him against the freezer, the girl yipping in bliss as she begs him for anything - anything – anything at all that he could possibly want. “Rub my belly. Rub your cock on them. Bite my tits. Suckle them. Call me ‘good girl’. Oh God! Please please PLEASE call me ‘good girl’!”<br />
<br />
Ches practically howls the phrase ‘good girl’ as damp femininity strains the crotch of her tightening jeans. She orgasms as she howls, that denim getting pressed out into a thick, inhuman camel toe as her cunt visibly shifts underneath it – turning into something befitting a ‘good girl’ like her. Now, everything is shifting and crackling, her transformation accelerating as her new purpose in life is sealed with a long howl of lust.<br />
<br />
All the while, Zack almost chokes as one of those perky mounds of canine tit wriggle between his lips, the bouncy, rubbery nipple flesh kissing him with a musky tincture of Ches’s sweat and the smell of wet dog. As Ches howls subsides, Zack is able to force himself away, breaking out into a sprint as he runs down the isle trying to reach the exit. Just as he escapes, he hears Ches’s paws clatter on the tiled floors as she takes on after him on two legs, only to stumble, sliding headfirst into the warming rollers, sending taquitos and hot dogs flying all around the store. Zack reaches the exit, looking back one last time only to see Ches writhing in a pile of shifting limbs and darkening hide, a hand-changing-into-a-paw as she held it outstretched towards him, pleading for him to come back.<br />
<br />
She looks like she’s in intense pain, but not due to the changes – but because Zack is leaving her.<br />
<br />
The boy doesn’t waste another moment on her, not looking back as he runs outside into the parking lot, pulling out his phone to call his mother. For a few agonizing moments the dial tone rings, the woman on the other end eventually picking up.<br />
<br />
“Mom!” Zack shouts into the receiver, his voice shaking.<br />
<br />
“Zack, what’s wrong?” asks a groggy voice in the other end of the line, his sudden call having just woken his mother up.<br />
<br />
“I’m at the 7/11! Something really wrong is happening here! The girl who works here, Ches, she just-“<br />
<br />
Zack feels his feet fly off the ground as something tugs at the back of his shirt, hoisting him in several feet in the air. He pauses, unable to say anything to person on the other side, leaving all for his mother to hear was the loud huffing of the giant dog that just snatched her son.<br />
<br />
“NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!” Che says with an inhuman growl as she violently shakes Zack back and forth like giant chew toy. “DON’T CALL! DROP IT!”<br />
<br />
The shaking leaves Zack with whiplash, the boy’s phone clattering to the ground as the screen cracks and the call disconnects. Ches snuffs out the phone,  stomping on it with a paw the size of a dinner plate just to make sure the thing threatening to take Zack away from her was dead, pulverizing it into a pulp of plastic and aluminum. She growls at the remains of the phone before turning tail and heading back into the convenience store, the huge dog ducking her head down to fit inside the human-sized entrance.<br />
<br />
Even if Zack knew about the Chronovac and the fate he’d accidentally brought on himself, he wouldn’t have believed it –  wouldn’t have imagined that Ches could have turned into a monster like this. Her hot, heaving breath puff like a fiery mist onto the his squirming body, forcing him to taste more of her canine scent mixed in with the sickly-sweet smell of dog in heat. Ches’s huge body slams against the sides of both shelves as she walks through them, the isles far too small to accommodate her proud new form. Hundreds of bags of junk food clattered to the ground as her massive body forces the isles apart, the metal shelves screeching as they topple over, sending their contents flying everywhere. Ches doesn’t care in the least, drool still slipping down her muzzle as she eyes the spot that Zack pet her first, the giant dog rolling over onto her back as she sets Zack down on top of her belly.<br />
<br />
“Do-rr it…. ” She says with a slight growl, arching her head back, forcing Zack’s face against her belly, begging him to make her feel like a “good girl” again.<br />
<br />
Zack is face to face with dog tits for the second time today, but this time they’re ten times larger, the soft canine breasts feeling like giant, plush bean-bag chairs as Che’s muzzle pushes against his back, shoving him into them. Fear racks the young boy’s body as he realizes her muzzle is big enough to swallow him whole now. Her tongue flicks out a strong lick tearing the T-shirt from his back as his face is pressed up against a single nipple, urging him to suckle on it like the puppy she wishes him to be.<br />
<br />
But he can’t – he physically isn’t able to wrap his lips around it the huge, taut blossom of feral dog teat. Zack tries to endure it as her pleading grows less cohesive, all her words slipping into bestial barks and yips as she grows more and more desperate to feel the touch of her boy. In between licks and being buried in doggy breast, Zack manages to look up at his former friend, seeing that her visage lacks any trace of the Ches he knew. She’s a giant, black-furred German Shepard of impressive pedigree, molded by the Chronovac to fulfill that wish he unwittedly asked for.<br />
<br />
Ches presses Zack as hard as she can against her belly, desperate to feel that rush of love she got when the boy rubbed her tummy before. In the back of her mind the Chronovac whispers to her, warping reality and her remaining sense of humanity, promising all sorts of ways to sate her bestial desires. A thought pops into her head that makes her tail wag, whipping down another row of shelves – the reason why she’s been made so big - an idea that will keep her Zack’s ‘good girl’ forever.<br />
<br />
The giant dog nudges Zack from her belly to over top her rear, the boy sputtering in a sea of ebony dog fluff until he topples over her flank. For a shining moment, Zack feels himself free from the giant dog and is ready to hightail it towards the emergency exit… that is, until he feels a steaming hot drop of something gooey ooze overhead.<br />
<br />
He shivers as he realizes Ches is squatting over him, that steaming drop of musky bitch scent originating from Ches’s own body. A gooey lube of dog lust spills all over his head, drenching him in a clear, viscous slime. Zack tries to wipe it off, but it keeps coming. Ches’s tail wags just above his head as she lowers herself until Zack is met square with her new canine sex starring back just a foot inch away from him. Her lips look like oversized jet-black inner-tubes origamied into the shape of a fortune cookie. Her dark pussy flesh smacks together like two, giant slimy slugs black slugs, rippling and writhing as they neared closer and closer to his forehead. <br />
<br />
“Plap – plap – schlliipp-“<br />
<br />
A cacophony of flesh slapping against flesh queefs out of her over-sized doggy vulva. Feral need oozes out of her jet-black canine spade in a thick puddle on the ground, all that rubbing against the freezer door ensuring every inch of that giant ebony doggy vulva is sloppily glazed with bitch cum.  Zack tries to back away from that black hole of doggy bliss, but he’s cornered against the freezer, the heat radiating off her oozing sex steaming across the cold glass as the rim of her spade drags along the ice cold door closer to his head.<br />
<br />
Che’s lips sizzled as they rubbed against that glass, so much steam erupting from her slimy pussy lips that being underneath Ches feels like a hot Swedish sauna. The air is so thick with wet dog smell Zack has to drink it in, almost choking on it. Very soon the acrid musk of steamy doggy sex wafting through the air gave way to her actual steamy doggy sex plapping against the top of the poor boy’s head.<br />
<br />
Zack shudders and scrunches up as much as he can to avoid it. The dog squatting over him wants him to touch it – needs him to pet her – needs him to satisfy her itch. That black, swollen doggy spade feels like a huge, weighted blanket draping over his head with a texture like velvety, squishy rubber. The boy’s arms dart up in the air to try to force it away only for his hands to disappear under that tidal wave of slime and luscious black canine spade. Each groove of her cunt flesh is enlarged, stroking along every inch of Zack’s flesh that it could touch as the excited dog lowered herself more and more on top of him. Despite Zack’s best efforts to resist, he can’t get away, that loud slurping sound of humid air squelching in and out of her hot folds rush against his scalp as those black canine pussy lips sloppily kiss him.<br />
<br />
“Ches… n-no, girl…” Zack mutters out a plea through clenched teeth, his face soaked in her irresistible bitch love, the biting animal scent making it hard to think. Zack’s eyes widen in fright as his hands disappear deeper into that giant sleeve of dog cunt. He tries to pull away, but he can’t. Those muscular vaginal walls are designed to hold in stud dogs and can easily grip him tight like a fleshy Chinese finger trap.<br />
<br />
Ches feels it vividly, her bitch senses tingling as she squats back hard, howling as she feels her boy begin slip inside her soft, velvety pussy. Her motherly, bestial flesh strokes along Zack’s shivering form, welcoming him to his new home whether he wants it or not. She was going to be a mother! A bitch dog with a Zack the puppy there to suckle her teats. She needed it more than anything, thoughts and memories of her old life disappearing in a flash of lust as maternal instinct took hold, her body ready to accept her new puppy.<br />
<br />
Zack’s lips are forced against Ches’s slimy pussy, the young boy making out with her slimy canine labia as his face slips inside. The sounds of cans getting crushed and the freezer door cracking underneath Ches’s weight were obscured by the sloshing sounds of the huge German shepherd’s innards. His hair is matted down in bitch cum, his cheeks smooshed from all sides by her slick birth canal. All he could hear Ches’s panting and howling from inside her,  her heartbeat pounding away at an excited cadence. Every wayward twitch of canine muscle begins to squeeze against him, drawing him in deeper with every move she made.<br />
<br />
Her smooth muscles undulated around him, as he sinks in through peristalsis, sucking his torso in like a limp spaghetti noodle. Steaming-hot bitch juice leaks from her engorged bitch pussy like a fire hose, the entire store becomming foggy with the acrid heat of dog musk. Zack struggles with all his might as his dick pressed against her rubbery, black dog lips, his bare cock grazing across her over-sized vulva as it gets coated with sizzling hot bitch juices. The twelve-year-old is no match for it, the boy grunting as his first orgasm into a woman slathers across the bottom of Ches’s oversized doggy clit. Zack winces and cries, heaving in heavy puffs of pussy-drenched air as his butt slips inside, dog cum coating the contours of his ass cheeks. His legs kick as he struggles in a last-ditch effort to break free, only for them to at last to sink inside as well with a wet, meaty “slop” sounding from Ches’s pussy lips as they seal Zack inside her rear.<br />
<br />
Now Zack is trapped in the dim cavern of Ches’s birth canal, satiny soft pink walls gripping his body tight as if it were another dog’s cock. Suddenly, his head struck something shaped like a giant rubbery donut without a hole, an exceptionally powerful sphincter making sure nothing got in or out. This flesh-safe was Ches’s cervix - the entrance to her womb. As Zack’s head is forced to nudge against it, the muscle relaxes, opening wider as it tightly kissed the boy’s lips… then his face… then his head. Ches’s supernatural desire for puppies pries her womb open, just enough to tug Zack inside, her cervical sphincter hugging him extra tight as it accepts him into her maternal chamber. Amniotic fluid blasts Zack in the face as soon as he entered, the boy forced to swim in it as he was sucked into the fleshy pouch of her womb. The pinkish confines were as big as his bedroom… but there was nothing there, not even air – just Ches’s womb fluids.<br />
<br />
“N-no! Let me out!” The boy shrieks as he begins to bash against the lining of the canine’s womb, desperate for escape before he drowns! Outside, the huge German Shepherd lays down, stroking her engorged, pregnant belly with her muzzle, licking and kneading her taut flesh as she adored the little bouts of kicking coming from inside her. She’s in heaven, her cookie leaking out bitch cum onto the floor as her chest heaves with maternal pride.<br />
<br />
Zack, however, was panicking, his air running low as he slams and punches against the thick, fleshy walls of the dog’s womb. Just as things start to look grim, Zack feels something slither along his inner thigh. He recoiled away from it, but it came right back at him, palpating his lower body – trying to make a connection. The twelve-year-old swims feverishly, banging his head against that rubbery womb as the tentacle pursues him, the long organ sliding against his butt, stroking along his penis before finally striking gold at his belly button. The opening at the tip fused to his stomach, Zack gasping in a yet another unwanted orgasm and he and Ches became one. His meager sperm stains the inside of Ches’s canine womb as he gasps took in his first breath of amniotic fluid, finding that he no longer needed to breath – the umbilical cord he was just attached to is doing that for him. It finalizes it. Ches is his new mother now. And he was going to be a puppy!<br />
<br />
The mere thought of it sends out a pulse of shock through the boy’s spine, Zack tying to tug the umbilical cord off only to feel a hose of canine nutrients flood inside him in response. It feels so warm, his mother’s love streaming into him without his consent – feeding him, sustaining him, promising to change him. He hates it, knowing what’s going to happen to him, but he can’t fight it anymore. He penis squirts out a last spurt of cum at the blissful feeling of getting fed from the umbilical cord, his sperm dissipating in the amniotic fluid before he finally relents, curling up for a well-earned nap.<br />
<br />
Ches feels Zack’s protests die down inside her, her boy now curled up in fetal position, resting inside her womb. She rolls on her belly and rubs it against the floor, the new dog yowling as a deluge of female doggy cum blasts from her cookie, covering the 7/11’s floor in her acrid love. Overjoyed with her new life as an animal, she relaxes in the dirty aisle of the seven eleven, belly happily heaving in heavy breathes of air as she falls asleep with her soon-to-be puppy.<br />
_________________________________<br />
<br />
“Z-zack!” Zack’s old mom calls out as she enters the now ruined 7/11, only to be met with a blast of animal stink assaulting her nostrils. Doggy cum leaked out the entrance as the sliding doors open, the aisles looking like a warzone as crushed packages of snacks sit soggy in the putrid flood of bitch juice.<br />
<br />
As Zack’s old mom looks on in sheer confusion, an ordinary-sized German Shepherd pops her head out of one of the aisles, her tail wagging and her belly pregnant and swollen as she arches her head down to swallow a whole hot dog from the toppled-over roller in one bite; after all, she was eating for two now.<br />
<br />
Zack’s old Mom doesn’t know what to make of it as the dog walks up to her and rolls over on her back, offering her belly for a rub. Starring down at the panting dog, she capitulated and reached down to stroke her, petting along the dog’s swollen belly, feeling up her engorged nipples as the German shepherd looked back up to her with a sly, almost human grin. Ches knows her son was inside her – she just wants to give her one last goodbye to Zack.<br />
<br />
After a few drawn out seconds, the dog scampers back up on all fours, trotting out of the gas station feeling like a prized-show dog. She peers back towards Zack’s old Mom with the same mirthful, toothy canine smile, the new German shepherd eager to begin her new life as a bitch.</p>
