<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the kitchen making breakfast while getting ready for her job as a nurse; Emily could not help but look up as she hears her son Brian growl as his girlfriend sighs and a loud dull thump could be heard. Emily knows what that thump was; it was Patricia slapping her tail on the floor as she experienced her orgasm from Brian’s furious thrusting into her eager fur covered sex. Hearing several more slaps from the were-beaver as she has a few more orgasms thanks to Brian. Emily shakes her head regretting ever giving her son permission to share his bed with his girlfriend. Knowing that the two are madly in love with each other; Emily originally reasoned that it was better for them to rut in the privacy of a home then risk exposing the existence of weres, doing it outside. Not that it stopped the two from frolicking in the lake every night or early morning, when they got the chance.<br />
<br />
She continued making breakfast as she hears her son, ever the enthusiast go again for another round.<br />
“God I hope that girl is taking her were-birth control pills,” Emily wondering; “I don’t want her to go through what I did when I was pregnant with Brian.”<br />
<br />
Emily was still in high school when her boyfriend then George Walker got her pregnant. Mistiming the length between doses of her were-birth control pill, she was soon with child. Her parents and George’s being old fashioned, told the two they had to get married. While the wedding was quick and pleasant and George was kind and caring at first; Emily had the nagging feeling in the back of her mind that George resented the fact that he was father and a husband, before graduating. Unaware at how resentful he was; Emily was soon beside herself when she came home one day from her day job as a waitress, to find Brian alone in front of the t.v while George ran off while everything of value. Finding out that her husband of only four years left her with more debt than she could possibly manage; she broke down and cried as she had to beg for help from her parents and George’s. While both felt sorry for her predicament; both parents agreed that she was partly responsible for her ordeal. They did help in the end for the sake of their grandson Brian. Both families adoring the child and felt he did not deserve the cruel trick that was just played on him.<br />
<br />
With their help; Emily was soon able to complete her night courses and certifications to become a nurse. The money decent; it was however not enough to get her out of debt and was forced to get a second job. That job as a waitress; like she was doing back when she and George were still together and he was working at the grocery store. Having an affair with a young girl before running out on her and Brian.<br />
<br />
Breaking out of her depressing trip down memory lane as she hears once again Patricia squealing in delights as her body reaches its climax yet again.<br />
“That was awesome,” Emily hearing Patricia moaning.<br />
“If you two are done,” Emily speaking up so they can hear; “come down for breakfast, we have to have a talk.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Brian was a happy were-otter; eager to please and pleasure his were-beaver girlfriend Patricia as the two weres in his room in the throes of ecstasy. Finding that she has an insatiable appetite for his prick and the stamina to match his own; Brian was all too happy to dam her up with his spunk as he affectionately mentioned the first time he laid eyes on her. Seeing her take her were-birth control pill late last night; ensuring there is a healthy overlap between doses. Brian and Patricia knew all too well how easily a were can get pregnant; neither eager to be parents at their age but liking the feeling of pleasuring each other; both agreed to make sure they did not go at it like a couple of rabbits in heat until at least an hour after she took her pill.<br />
<br />
Knowing she was safe from getting knocked up; Brian was once again plunging into to Patricia’s willing folds. Finding her sex clamping down on his member a joyous feeling as he shoots his load in her; filling her hungry womb with his seed. That sensation is coming again as he feels his furry scrotum tense and clench. His latest explosion about to spill forth as he looks straight into Patricia’s eyes.<br />
“Get ready,” Brian whispers; “here I cum again.”<br />
Patricia smiles and moans; her eyes rolling in the back of her head as she feels Brian twitch and spasm with in him. The warm feeling flowing into her, as her body clamps down; milking Brian as he makes a few final thrusts in time to his ejaculating. Her flat tail smacking the floor as she moans in pleasure; “That was awesome!” <br />
<br />
Brain breathing heavily as he enjoys the sensation of his orgasmic release. Staring at Patricia intently, a smile on his muzzle as he stares as his lover sighs in pure contentment; neither wanting the moment to end.<br />
“If you two are done,” Emily speaking up so they can hear; “come down for breakfast, we have to have a talk.”<br />
“Guess mom heard us,” Brian grinning; “but to be fair, it’s kind of hard not to with our enhanced hearing in and out of our fursona’s.&quot;<br />
“I couldn’t resist,” Patricia still swooning; “I instinctively slap my tail during any intense emotional moment.”<br />
“Well,” Brian grinning; “I’ve definitely given you multiple reasons.”<br />
“And each one,” Patricia kissing her were-otter lover; “better than the last.”<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Coming downstairs a few minutes later both were’s sitting at the table; with smiles on their muzzles and an unmistakable glow. Emily could not help but get blasted with the intense smell of sex coming off of the two lovers. Her son’s musky scent intoxicating; it took Emily every fiber of her being to remind herself that Brian is her son and to think such desires is un-natural and taboo; even for weres. Placing palates of food in front of her son and Patricia; Emily gives them a few moments to eat before sitting down to talk with them.<br />
“Before you two run off to do what I think you are going to do,” Emily rolling her eyes; again. I have to ask you, “looking at Patricia; “you are taking your pills to prevent being pregnant correct?”<br />
“Don’t worry mom,” Brian speaking up; “Patricia here took it an hour before we started going mad with love last night.”<br />
“I’m good for another eighteen hours there abouts,” Patricia grinning; “we just had to have another go this morning.”<br />
“I heard,” Emily answering; “multiple times in fact. I ask because I don’t want you to make the same mistake I did.”<br />
 “Mom,” Brian sighing; “we know better, so let us enjoy each other please.”<br />
“I’m not going to stop worrying over this,” Emily speaking; “you know how difficult we have had. What with your father and all that.”<br />
“I know,” Brian answering; “dad’s mood hasn’t changed much after finding out he has been declared dead. In fact,” Brian speaking; “he is still locked up in the elder council building refusing to help us.”<br />
“Anything else I should know,” Emily asking; “you have been pulling quite the long hours over their working during the summer break.”<br />
“We do need the money,” Brian answering; “the council is helping, but they can only do so much.”<br />
“I’m not arguing that,” Emily responding; “but I’m referring to your father. Anything new I should know?”<br />
“Only that he is royally pissed after finding out I was the one that had him declared dead,” Brian taking another bite of his breakfast; “and that I have a half-brother. Although dad could be lying in an attempt to get some council members to be sympathetic with him.”<br />
“What,” Emily shouting; “he said you have a brother?”<br />
“I don’t think George,” Patricia chiming in; “knows the cells in the council building are wired for sound. If he did; he wouldn’t be so forthcoming with information,” Patricia sighing; “I’m not thrilled that Rachael Gauldet is using me to pump the slimy were for information.”<br />
“Your not,” Brian looking at Patricia; “getting-“<br />
“No,” Patricia knowing what Brian was about to say; “I would never let him penetrate me. Not after what you told me he did to you and your mother.”<br />
“So those names Rachael asked me to look up,” Brain looking glum; “they are dad’s aliases?”<br />
Patricia nodded as Emily looked on horrified about what was just mentioned. “I’m going to have to talk with the were-otter rep regarding about using you two,” Emily looking distraught; “to deceive and trick George.”<br />
“He deserves,” Brain growling; “to get screwed mom. He nearly made us both homeless; I have no sympathy or pity for father and the plight he is currently in.”<br />
“I take it you both will be working again at the council building again today,” Emily sighing.<br />
“There are still werewolves from the Seattle Luna Brotherhood chapter still locked up,” Brian answering; “but they will soon be handed over to this real creepy looking dude from Romania from what I heard.”<br />
“Romania,” Emily looking confused; “who from Romania would want to involve themselves with Moon Lake affairs?”<br />
“Only the head of the Luna Brotherhood,” Patricia answering; “Ever since I greeted Rachael Gauldet in French when I first met her, she has filled me in on lots of juicy tidbits. Always in French though because I think this is stuff that shouldn’t be shared.”<br />
“Well out with it then,” Brain looking interested; “why is the head of the Luna Brotherhood from Romania?”<br />
“Because that is where the order originated,” Patricia answering; “way back when the Romanian province of Wallachia was still a vassal principality ran by Vlad Dracul.”<br />
“I find that hard to swallow,” Brian rolling his eyes.<br />
“I was skeptical at first,” Patricia answering; “but you can read up on it in the archives if you want. Ever since they had those scrolls restored and then digitized; a lot of the town’s history and history of weres was rediscovered. The big thing being how the Luna Brotherhood was first formed to help protect the citizens both normal and were alike from the brutal machinations of Vlad and the Ottomans he was at war with. It kind of became the birth of the myth in how Werewolves and Vampires were brutal blood enemies,” Patricia giggling; “of course though vampires don’t exist.”<br />
“Perhaps that is the surprise the town is preparing,” Emily thinking; “for this labor day picnic.”<br />
“I doubt they would make the history of weres,”Brian finishing his breakfast; “public knowledge mom.”<br />
“I’m talking about the town’s history,” Emily answering.<br />
“Won’t know until Monday then,” Patricia also finishing breakfast; “I guess we should get ready now.”</p>
