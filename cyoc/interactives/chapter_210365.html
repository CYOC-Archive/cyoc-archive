<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Mandy finally got home she was disappointed to see that Paul had made no attempt to start on dinner. As she started to prepare she asked Paul about his experience at the shops. Mandy listened eagerly. She wanted Paul’s relationship with Melissa to blossom. <br />
<br />
When Paul had finished summarising the afternoon Mandy was not surprised to hear that Melissa had been disappointed. This was only confirmed when Paul told her the message that Dave had passed on about Paul being a jerk in Melissa’s eyes. <br />
<br />
‘Sounds like you need to do a bit of bridge repairing’ <br />
<br />
‘But why? What did I do wrong?’<br />
<br />
He really didn’t understand when Mandy tried to point out all the little mistakes he had made.<br />
<br />
‘How am I supposed to fake enjoyment when they just go to shops that sell girly stuff. She didn’t follow me into the gaming store. She’s just as much at fault as I am!’ said Paul defensively.<br />
<br />
‘I think tomorrow morning will do you good. You might learn how to interact with women’<br />
<br />
Paul was totally puzzled by his mother’s cryptic remark. He didn’t understand women at all. He stormed back to his room in a foul mood. <br />
<br />
Paul did re-emerge for dinner. He finally remembered to pass on the message from Mr Cook. His mother was looking at him strangely. She was also speaking funny ‘Shall we change straight after doing the dishes?’ <br />
<br />
‘What do you mean?’<br />
<br />
‘We need to use the medallion to change for tomorrow morning. I’m going to be Madeline remember? I’m thinking I might do it as soon as we have done the dishes. I’m looking forward to being a little girl. It sounds like it will be a bit of a party’<br />
<br />
‘Whatever’ Paul was still in a foul mood.<br />
<br />
As soon as the dishes were done Paul returned to his room. Mandy was happy that Paul actually helped, she also went to her room and began selecting the clothes that Paul would wear to the play date in the morning. She decided on a yellow tiered skirt and a white T-shirt with a floral motive. She matched those with some simple brown leather sandals that were very comfortable and a brown leather handbag. She also got out a lacy white bra and panty set that she had only bought on Monday and had yet to wear. She thought Paul might prefer previously unworn underwear. She also collected a clean nightgown and the robe to change Paul with. <br />
<br />
She placed these items where Paul would easily find them then went to the spare room and selected some little girl clothes for herself, from the collection Kimberly had bought over. She couldn’t go past the pink lace dress for tomorrow but for tonight she choose a blue sundress that had looked cute when Paul had modelled it. <br />
<br />
Only then did she retrieve the medallion and touch it to the blue dress. She returned to her own bathroom to watch her change in the mirror.<br />
<br />
30 minutes later Madeline was back. She put on the blue dress then went to find her cousin.<br />
<br />
Paul was back in his room once more playing video games. ‘Hello cousin. What do you think?’ Paul turned to see the little girl he had been for less than a day. It was hard to believe this little girl was his mother. Paul had been this same little girl in this same dress only a few days ago.<br />
<br />
‘What am I meant to say? You look cute?’<br />
<br />
‘Well yes. Saying something like that would make me feel better. The way you said it though just makes me upset. With that attitude it’s no wonder Melissa is mad at you’<br />
<br />
‘She’s not mad at me. She gave me a kiss. She wouldn’t do that if she was mad at me’<br />
<br />
‘And from what you told me before you didn’t respond at all. She will be mad at you alright’<br />
<br />
‘What am I supposed to have done?’<br />
<br />
‘Kiss her back. Give her a cuddle. Show some affection for her. Be enthused when she shows you something in a shop. She was showing you off to her girlfriend and you embarrassed her’<br />
<br />
‘I don’t understand women’<br />
<br />
‘Clearly’ The little girl continued to stare at Paul.<br />
<br />
‘What are you staring at?’<br />
<br />
‘How about you turn off the computer and come and play a board game with me. A simple game from the cupboard that you used to enjoy when you were my age. How about Operation? That used to be a favourite of yours. Come on, help me remember the fun of being a kid again. I want to get into character’<br />
<br />
&#39;No. I don&#39;t feel like it&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;You being such a grump&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;ve had a big day and I&#39;m tired. Amuse yourself. Why don&#39;t you read one of those books Kimberly left you&#39;<br />
<br />
That was actually a good idea Mandy thought. She would at least have to read several chapters to know the plot and characters in the book. &#39;Good thought. I can do that. Come to my room when you are ready to change. I have everything ready for you&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yeah Yeah! Look I&#39;m busy reading something myself. Maybe later&#39; Paul was speaking to Mandy as if she was a pesky little girl. He had not been listening to what Mandy had been saying.<br />
<br />
Mandy returned to the spare bedroom and collected the books Kimberly had lent to Madeline. She returned with them to her own room. They were all recently published books. Mandy could recall vaguely reading some of this series 25 years ago when she had been a tween herself. She choose the earliest published of the books and started one the first chapter. She hoped memories of the characters would return to her.<br />
<br />
2 hours later Mandy had finished the second of the books. She decided that would do. Paul had not come in tp change yet. If he wanted to be able to change back to himself as soon as the play date was finished at lunch time tomorrow he was cutting it fine. Time for Mandy to remind him.<br />
<br />
Paul had gone to bed an hour earlier. Mandy found his door slightly ajar, with the light off. She peeped in to see her son asleep on top of his bed wearing only his boxers. She didn&#39;t have the heart to wake him.<br />
<br />
She went back and retrieved the medallion and her robe. She figured if Paul left his change until the morning he would be stuck as “Ma<br />
ndy” until tomorrow night. In contrast if she changed him now then he would be able to change back as soon as the play date was over. <br />
<br />
But then she had second thoughts. If she used the robe then Paul would feel refreshed and feel like he had just woken up. Better that she used her own adult clothes she had just taken off. That way Paul would be tired and get a good nights sleep. She returned to her room.<br />
<br />
This time she returned with the bra she had taken off earlier. She touched the bra and the medallion to the sleeping teenage boy. He twitched slightly but didn’t wake. Mandy wasn’t interested in watching Paul change. She knew her own body well enough. Instead she went back to her own room and crawled into her own bed. The Queen bed felt huge, but she must have been tired because she soon fell asleep.</p>
