<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The arrival in Idaho had concluded a long and tiring day, and to a degree, Tuxing probably could have slept longer as a result of all of that, but morning did come with the rising sun and the sounds of activity did get her to roll out of bed. She dressed herself and listened carefully to the activity that was going on downstairs. She came down to find Lenard frying eggs while Mikey was seated on a stool by the sink eating from a bowl of cereal, a cereal that had a very chocolaty scent to Tuxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning!&quot; Mikey called as Tuxing entered and alerting Lenard to turn to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;We didn&#39;t mean to disturb you,&quot; Lenard said politely.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine,&quot; Tuxing answered, &quot;I am rested, and it would do well to get up anyway. The eggs smell good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And they should be ready soon,&quot; Lenard answered, &quot;after that... I can show you around... at least what would be my territory. Mikey has little league practice in the afternoon, and I can show you around town then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds good,&quot; Tuxing answered.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The tour was the thing that Tuxing most enjoyed after breakfast. Much of it related to things that then came after breakfast and came with some measure enabling Tuxing to get some look at the land around Lenard&#39;s cabin and fit with some of the things that Tuxing had found herself observing on the drive to the cabin. Mikey had gone out to a living room and was watching some cartoons, or something like that, while Tuxing had gone out into the backyard and at least started the main part of her day with some stretches and base exercises while also looking out over the lawn and other things to observe. Heading out had brought to her the scent of pine or spruce and Tuxing found herself liking that.<br />
<br />
She settled onto a soft patch of grass that wasn&#39;t too far from the back door before going into her set of warmup exercises. It felt nice and let her also look over what was easily visible to her. There was a large pool that wasn&#39;t too far away, and she could see some water in it, which probably saw some action in the heat of the summer, as the air was already feeling rather warm. Toward the edge of the mowed lawn was a large wooden shed, and Tuxing guessed that Lenard kept tools and things for maintaining the lawn there. Beyond that there were plenty of spruce, fir, or pine tries that formed part of the forest that was behind Lenard&#39;s cabin. It was only to the northeast corner of the lawn where there seemed to be an open field with some modest grass that went down a bit of a slope and let Tuxing look out over it. It provided something that Tuxing didn&#39;t have at home, it made her feel at ease as she began her exercises. After a few moments, the door opened again, she noted Lenard coming out. He made a small smile as she looked to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that part of your style?&quot; Lenard asked as he approached, being sure to step over a mat that was at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... this is more just some warmups,&quot; Tuxing answered, &quot;they help with mental discipline and readying for practice regarding my style. I could show you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lenard nodded, but said nothing of that for the moment and then asked, &quot;what do you think of the view?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s nice... open...&quot; Tuxing admitted, &quot;different from what I know at home. And strangely... some of it feels quite nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve liked it for that too,&quot; Lenard agreed, &quot;even when I was Human. There is a certain level of the &quot;wild&quot; that is here that is something worth enjoying. Something that people in New York have long lost.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tuxing nodded. There were areas of China that had lost that kind of &quot;wildness&quot; as well. Places like Taiwan didn&#39;t have the space to expand in that way and it was only in the western parts of China where fewer people lived that something like this was present.<br />
<br />
&quot;But that wilderness can come with its own risks,&quot; Lenard continued and began to escort Tuxing on a bit of the walk to look over the grounds, &quot;as occasionally some wildlife comes out around here. And even herbivores can be dangerous. People going into Yellowstone have been gored by bison at times. The bigger threat... and particularly to Mikey... would be cases when bears, wolves, or mountain lions come out of the park.&quot;<br />
<br />
They walked along until they came up to a large post that looked the scratching posts that had been built up for the Cat Animalians, though it looked like it was also wrapped with ropes. Looking up to the east, Tuxing also noted more of these scratching posts set up.<br />
<br />
&quot;You said that was why you converted,&quot; Tuxing said slowly, catching a scent that smelled something like buttered popcorn from the lower parts of the post and below the rope.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Lenard nodded, &quot;and for the most part it&#39;s seemed to keep the mountain lions and wolves out. As I&#39;ve set up these scratching posts that can let me keep my claws sharp and leave scent behind that they&#39;ll smell. That I could physically do easily.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I trust you haven&#39;t actually been peeing on these posts,&quot; Tuxing commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;As in opening my fly and doing that? No,&quot; Lenard explained, &quot;though I do use a water spritzer bottle that I fill when necessary. And it&#39;s to play to how a lot of animals look at territory. They look for scents and things like that. It keeps the mountain lions and wolves from coming in and may even give bears some room for thought. The real deterrence for them is for some electric mats I have under the windows and before the doors. Any bear that steps on them gets a bit a jolt and won&#39;t try again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To protect Mikey,&quot; Tuxing said slowly.<br />
<br />
Lenard nodded and continued to show Tuxing along his property line. It let Tuxing get a look at more of the ground around Lenard&#39;s cabin. And even in the woods, there were some aspen trees in places. It was something that Tuxing liked, and the back of her mind actually thought on hunting as Lenard showed her around. Though the reference to &quot;protecting Mikey&quot; reminded Tuxing of some other things that she was curious on, and which related to what she&#39;d observed in the drawings that Mikey had left for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;That makes you quite noble, Mr. Bearstone,&quot; Tuxing spoke, &quot;it&#39;s something I like about you. But... there are some things where I&#39;d have questions how your brother has handled things that relate to your parents&#39; death.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We both took it hard,&quot; Lenard answered, &quot;we both loved them...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Tuxing commented, &quot;it&#39;s something that can be comparable to what my sisters and I went through. But it&#39;s something that strikes me something where Mikey might have some pains of his own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pains?&quot; Lenard asked with his eyes widening and his ears alert.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... he left some drawings for me,&quot; Tuxing said slowly, &quot;and they are quite cute. But it seems like he&#39;s drawing pictures of us... on dates, getting married, one where we&#39;re all a family and almost positioned as if you and I would be taking your parents&#39; place with Mikey between us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think he likes you,&quot; Lenard answered as he put his hand on Tuxing&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I like him, too,&quot; Tuxing answered, &quot;in part it&#39;s something that makes me like you, too. But... it&#39;s where I know that hardships and things like that can hurt in ways more than just physical pain. My sister, Muxing, took a lot of pain through our ordeal and has made her somewhat... uneasy around men and strangers at times, as I think they did her more harm than any of us. She&#39;s been getting better...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you think Mikey might have some psychological pain?&quot; Lenard asked, &quot;Pain he&#39;s healing by... wanting us to be together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s my best guess,&quot; Tuxing answered, &quot;and on some level... us being together might not be a bad thing... But if there is pain and damage there, it might be best to talk to him about it. Maybe not right now, as that would get in the way of your Fourth of July holiday coming up. And for the moment, it may not be a major thing to worry about... but it will be something that will still be there in the future. And handling them would be something that be good for both of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The tour of the town later in the day came later and worked out fairly well. There were some that took fairly curious interest in Tuxing&#39;s presence, and they seemed happy at her being with Lenard. There were some that were uneasy with Tuxing&#39;s name, but none really pushed it, and ultimately there was an invitation to the parade the next day. From there, they then returned to the ballpark where Mikey was practicing. They didn&#39;t have long to wait before practice ended and Mikey came running up a dirt path from the ball field with another young lad, both smiling happily. There were brief introductions and Mikey&#39;s friend was quite pleasant, though there were of course promises on meeting up at the Fourth of July Parade, which Lenard agreed to and created a fairly hectic morning the next day.<br />
<br />
And that morning was hectic. For Lenard didn’t live in town, and that meant he had to drive a little way to get into town for the parade. But Tuxing didn’t mind, and to a degree, she was even more rested on the morning of July 4 than she had been on the third. And the parade was fairly fun. To a degree, Tuxing was well aware of America&#39;s fondness for Independence Day and had noted some of Lyre/Animalia&#39;s celebrations before, though the parade in Idaho was a bit different. It had more of a western theme to it with local ranchers riding horses and carrying the American flag. One came through with a float being pulled by a tractor. Some waved to Lenard and Mikey as they went by.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do you think?&quot; Lenard asked as Mikey darted out to collect some candy that was thrown his way and then moved back to the sidewalk where Lenard and Tuxing were seated.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s nice,&quot; Tuxing commented, &quot;different from what they do in Lyre/Animalia, but nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about on Heiya Island?&quot; Lenard asked, only earning a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;The colony there is part of Japan,&quot; Tuxing told him, &quot;July 4 there is just the fourth day of the month. The big thing that will be coming up there will be Animalia&#39;s &quot;birthday,&quot; which is more a local holiday for Animalia and its colony cities. All celebrating the start of Animalia. Heiya Island&#39;s version would have a more... oriental feel to it. About the only one who would really be into the Fourth of July would be Nate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Natexing?&quot; Mikey asked looking up to Tuxing and his brother. Earning a giggle from Tuxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nate Bowman,&quot; Tuxing gave a laugh, &quot;He is originally from Wisconsin and met my sister when Animalia sponsored the first martial arts showcase. They then fell in love and got married last summer. You probably met him and Shuixing during the Year of the Tiger tournament.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Water Buffalo Animalian?&quot; Lenard asked to which Tuxing nodded, &quot;that&#39;s all amazing...&quot; he paused and Tuxing figured he&#39;d have to be blushing under his fur, &quot;hopefully I can do as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep being the good man you are, and you will,&quot; Tuxing smiled which led to a couple of chuffs between them as she nuzzled her muzzle to Lenard&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;And this birthday is his?&quot; Mikey asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it isn&#39;t Nate&#39;s birthday,&quot; Tuxing answered, &quot;it&#39;s Animalia&#39;s birthday. When Animalia got its start. Why don&#39;t you two come out then... it&#39;d be relatively calm, and you could meet the rest of my family, Jinxing, Huoxing, and Muxing. As they weren&#39;t at the Year of the Tiger competition.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about... well... some of the other things that have gone on there?&quot; Lenard wondered nervously, &quot;like the people that Interpol has rescued?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tuxing noted Lenard putting a protective hand over Mikey&#39;s while nervously tapping the other on his own thigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re doing well,&quot; Tuxing answered, &quot;there are counselors there that have been helping them adjust and things like that. They wouldn&#39;t harm Mikey. Some of them might be more interested in being your fan girls than anything with Mikey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;m afraid of,&quot; Lenard answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;A big strong Tiger Animalian like you?&quot; Tuxing commented, &quot;you&#39;ll be fine... and I can show you the exercises that can help you prepare...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We should go!&quot; Mikey declared, &quot;I bet there will be cake, like at my birthday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... the exercises may be fun,&quot; Lenard commented, &quot;and it would be nice to meet the rest of your family... and perhaps better converse with Nate and Shuixing... as things at the Year of the Tiger contest were busy. And the exercises will be something to practice before the fireworks tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fireworks!&quot; Mikey cheered.</p>
