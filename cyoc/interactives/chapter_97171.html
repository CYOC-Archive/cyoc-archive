<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">William felt a bit grateful that Martha was going to give him a chance to redeem itself. It would in a sense set things up for the new start that he had originally hoped Moon Lake would be. He wasn&#39;t fully sure on how it would work, but he wanted to prove to her that he was more than who he had been, and that had nothing to do with what had happened to him. He didn&#39;t care how long they would live, he wanted to spend his days with her and show that he did love her. He could admit that he had cheated on her, yes, and he was ashamed of it. Ashamed that it had happened and that he had been too easily drawn in, especially when he did love her. A part of him couldn&#39;t understand now how he had been so easily lead into the affairs he had had. And he felt new instincts in his mind tell him that Martha&#39;s unhappiness was his fault, and that made him ashamed. He had to make it up to her, and show her that he was more than what he had been.<br />
<br />
&quot;To be honest... I don&#39;t want to lose you,&quot; William said, &quot;When my transformation completed, all I could see was you and all the good times we had. The dates... the things we&#39;ve had in common... raising Nate and Eric. And how you stood by me after all the stupid stuff I did and let myself get pulled into. You showed me far more love and faith than I did... and that made me ashamed... I could have done better... I SHOULD have done better... I can do better. I want to show you that... that I do love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha felt William grip her hands firmly yet gently. In many ways she did still love him and remembered the good times they had had before the issues with William&#39;s infidelity to her had come about. And she knew that William was a horrible liar. When the incident in Minnesota came about William had tried to hide it, but Martha had caught on almost immediately and called him on it. The shame he showed at that, however, had been enough to show that hiding it had been more to hide his shame rather anything else. In this, Martha could tell that William was being completely honest in getting a new start and being faithful and that he was ashamed of his infidelity. But being ashamed of a mistake didn&#39;t change that a mistake had been made and that William had too easily been lured away in the first place. She could give him the chance to prove that he loved her and prove that he could be better, and for the sake of their marriage, she would.<br />
<br />
She knew Samantha hated him, probably for his attempt to rape her while he was still transforming, but a part of that was probably her own fault. She had called in a nervous wreck and made mention of William being led off. Samantha in her effort to try and help Martha then set off and interrupted the completion of William&#39;s transformation. And she remembered reading in the handbook that the completion of the transformation from normal to were-beast was not one to be interrupted. In this, she found Frances&#39; explanation that William wasn&#39;t in control of himself because of the need to complete his transformation at the time, and THAT was why he made the threat. He might have started to come out of the haze of what was forced on him, but he still wasn&#39;t in control of himself. She was fairly certain that Frances didn&#39;t really like him either, and again for the same reason that she knew Samantha did hate him, but Frances seemed more understanding. More willing to accept giving William a chance to prove himself. Martha could only guess that that was Frances&#39; experience as a therapist coming into play.<br />
<br />
However, none of them knew how bad William was at lying. And neither of them had known the good that William had done. Yes, he had been lead astray, and yes, some of those women had sent him lewd photos, and as much as William pretended she didn&#39;t know, she had always known, because he was a bad liar. And when the incident happened that got him fired, she forgave him for ALL of his dalliances because the shame he showed was at the realization of what he&#39;d been lead into and was truly honest. He hadn&#39;t displayed any of the obvious ticks and twitches or even odd excuses that she had easily picked up on in the past. In this, she knew he had admitted that he had done wrong and was truly sorry. <br />
<br />
And there was the good he had done. Despite his infidelity, he had provided for her and protected her. He was sexually attentive to her needs, though the fact that she hadn&#39;t been that needy as much may have contributed to his infidelity in the past. But above all, he had been a good father. He had always been there for Nate and Eric when they were growing up. Little league, school events, and even indulging their hobbies. Nearly every single one of Nate&#39;s werewolf movies were birthday or Christmas gifts from his father. William had directly intervened in Minnesota to deal a group of bullies that been rather aggressive toward Eric for Eric&#39;s own likes and dislikes. And Eric had come back bruised and even in tears once over the bullies actions. And that was not a sign of a bad man or a jerk. William could be over-protective at times, but he was still a good father. And that was more than worthy of at least one last chance.<br />
<br />
Though the chance wouldn&#39;t be easy, after all, both of them were now were-beasts themselves and weren&#39;t the same species. He was a werefox and she was a werecat. She had been nervous about seeing him, but it wasn&#39;t really fear of him or anger at his infidelity. The Twists may have thought that, but that wasn&#39;t it. It was more the concern as to whether or not she would still be attracted to him as a werecat. The handbooks she had read stated that werecats were at least bisexual and most were lesbians, and that any heterosexual woman who became a werecat would find herself either bisexual or a complete lesbian. It even mentioned that heterosexual women becoming werecats might need additional care and support from their respective prides in adapting to their new sexuality. Now, Martha had been bisexual before, which could mean that nothing would change regarding her sexuality... but since becoming a werecat could make a heterosexual woman a lesbian, she wasn&#39;t sure. And if the change did change things in that regard, being with William wouldn&#39;t work. She wouldn&#39;t be attracted to him and he wouldn&#39;t get anything out of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Martha said softly, but she also had to admit that some of their problems had come from her. &quot;But let&#39;s take it slow and on a day to day basis... as we&#39;ve BOTH changed greatly since we came to Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
She had hidden the fact that she was bisexual and had even repressed it to the point that she had been shocked and surprised when she had her fantasy with Samantha and Frances. Now, as a werecat, she was finding herself far more comfortable with that, at least with being attracted to other females. And her night with Samantha and Frances was wonderful, and if any werecat events included enjoy their company, she would take it. But as she sat with William, she found that her transformation hadn&#39;t changed her sexuality in the slightest. She was still bisexual as she mentally found herself attracted to William&#39;s more muscular form, which looked rather good with the drops that were rolling down his chest and arms from his shower. He was built like much more like a male model now or a top level athlete, and she remembered seeing his sheath when Samantha had brought him back. In his fox form it was at LEAST twice the size it had been before, and a part of her mind wanted it. She actually found herself growing warm between her legs, but she put that aside. But she figured right now was not the time for that and she wanted to wait until find a way to balance her desires.<br />
<br />
&quot;In many ways,&quot; William agreed with a chuckle, &quot;though... though, maybe for you it&#39;s more accepting what makes you you. Me... all it&#39;s done is ruin my life and highlight how stupid I was.&quot;<br />
<br />
She watched him look down again, looking hurt and even angry at himself. A part of her though was more curious about the first part.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re... you&#39;re okay with my being bisexual?&quot; Martha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I suppose I am,&quot; William answered, &quot;to be honest... there is nothing wrong with who you love... or who you&#39;re attracted to. And I suppose this will be a thing we&#39;ll have to work through.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if you feel you need a night with the Twists rather than me...&quot; William said slowly, &quot;I&#39;m fine with it. I&#39;d be a hypocrite if I demand you remain loyal to me when I&#39;ve been anything but loyal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That will only be with official werecat gatherings,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;They are happily married to each other and I&#39;m not going to purposely go them because I&#39;m horny. I can be comfortable with being bi... but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m going to just throw off men altogether and move in next door... which I think Samantha wants me to do... and both of them admitted loving me... but they are married to each other. I&#39;m simply a member of the pride, and while they are wonderful... I&#39;m not simply going to go next door because I&#39;m horny.&quot;<br />
<br />
William looked up for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong... if you can&#39;t prove to be faithful now, I will file for divorce and move in with them if they&#39;ll let me,&quot; Martha warned, &quot;As I said, this past incident may not be your fault... but it still opened old wounds concerning the coed in Minnesota... and the other women you&#39;ve seen when I wasn&#39;t in the mood.&quot;<br />
<br />
William only blinked, &quot;You... you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a bad liar, William,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;Just about every time you covered up one of your affairs you mention of going to other places that were either A) closed at the time you said you were going there or B) places you had no realistic reason to be there for... not to mention that I caught Nate with your phone once flipping through naughty pictures that the other women had sent you. I did ground him for going through your phone, but I did still find out. If your phone had a delete function for those messages, you might have been safe... but it doesn&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
William only looked down again.<br />
<br />
&quot;But as I said... I am giving you a last chance to prove yourself,&quot; Martha continued, &quot;You want to prove you are the man I fell in love with? You want to prove that you are more than the man who too easily slipped into bad habits when he was horny? Then be faithful now. Avoid that vixen that scratched you. Be a good father to the boys. Be on my beck and call when I want you...and we can take this day by day to truly see where we stand.&quot;<br />
<br />
William nodded and leaned forward. His hands moved from her hands to her shoulders and pulled her slightly forward. For a moment her heart fluttered at the idea that he might want to mate, that he still found her beautiful, and a good part of her was extremely willing to give it a go, even with what she had said about taking it slow.  But his scent didn&#39;t carry arousal. It smelled nice, but it wasn&#39;t aroused and as William leaned in he kissed her on the forehead and then backed away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything for my bonded mate,&quot; William said to her, &quot;because in spite of all my mistakes... I do LOVE you. I was just stupid...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bonded mate?&quot; Martha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; William nodded, playing to what his instincts were telling him about the new him, &quot;We werefoxes may be hunky and dashing playboy males... or voluptuous and very seductive vixens, depending on the gender, but once we find one that we love and bond to... we bond firmly to that love, and cherish it always. And I loved you when we conceived Nate. I loved you when we got married... I loved you when Eric was born... even though you wanted a daughter... And I love you now. I will always love you and I will do better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d better...&quot; Martha answered, though she was surprised he remembered that she had hoped that Eric was a girl. Not that she didn&#39;t love having a second son, but she had wanted a daughter. She figured that once and if they could fully reconcile and Nate and Eric had grown up, maybe they could try for a daughter, since their lifespans were now longer.<br />
<br />
Both of them jumped when suddenly William&#39;s cellphone rang. William lost the grip on the towel and ended up giving Martha a full view of his naked butt and his flaccid penis and scrotum hanging down between his legs. Even flaccid, it was larger than it had ever been and a part of Martha wanted to see how big it would be when erect and when when he was in his were form, but she reminded that their reconciliation was to be slow, and jumping him with his phone ringing wouldn&#39;t work in that regard. Controlling herself and remembering the plan to take things slow, she watched him bend down and pick up the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; William answered, &quot;Who is this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha then felt herself hiss as she heard a feminine voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey big boy,&quot; came Yvette&#39;s voice, &quot;I... uh... I kinda need your help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha hissed at the voice, as she figured this was the werefox that was the cause of the present problems. What surprised her though, was that William paid no attention to her hiss. He looked to his phone, red creeping into the brown of the irises of his eyes and he actually gave a low growl.<br />
<br />
&quot;You!&quot; William growled at the phone, recognizing Yvette&#39;s voice, &quot;I thought I&#39;d heard the last of you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... uh... I need your help?&quot; Martha heard Yvette repeat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; William answered, &quot;Why should I help you? You came onto me, I said no. You attacked me and tried to rape me... clawed me... made me turn into a fucking werefox! Got me in trouble with the woman I love and probably earned the eternal hatred of my neighbors... when I&#39;ve come here for a new start... not to have my old mistakes come back even harder... So, WHY WOULD I HELP YOU?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you are a werefox as I am,&quot; Yvette answered, &quot;and I am in trouble...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You got yourself in trouble,&quot; William answered, &quot;Get yourself out!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As a member of the Skulk, you are required to to come to my aid!&quot; Yvette answered.<br />
<br />
That sort of reminded Martha of what Samantha and Frances had told her about werecat activities with the Pride, and figured that a group of foxes or werefoxes would be a Skulk. However, neither Frances nor Samantha had made any mention unquestioned support if a member of the Pride got into legal trouble.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what trouble are you in?&quot; William said with a sigh, but the tone of his voice was still such that indicated that he wanted nothing to do with the vixen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... you left me all alone, and when I got up... this weredog cop was at the door,&quot; Yvette answered, &quot;said he got a call from the College dean with reports of evidence that I attacked you.&quot;<br />
<br />
That had to be the security camera footage from the parking lot.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to come down to the station and say that it was all a game,&quot; Yvette answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; William answered, &quot;You did attack me. I didn&#39;t ask to be a werefox. I&#39;d think that&#39;d be more than enough justification to NOT help you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... but the Skulk!&quot; Yvette protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;If need be, I&#39;ll find out who&#39;s in charge and report to them that you attacked me and that I didn&#39;t want to be a werefox,&quot; William answered, &quot;it may have been a game for you, but it certainly wasn&#39;t a game for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, William hung up with Yvette and gave a heavy sigh. &quot;I hate her. She ruined my life...&quot;<br />
<br />
That made Martha blink. She had come to like being a werecat, but something in that line seemed to indicate that William wasn&#39;t happy with being a werefox.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you happy with what you are?&quot; Martha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d be happier if I had an honest choice in the matter, like you and Nate got,&quot; William answered, &quot;the musculature...&quot; He paused to look down at his penis, which was still hanging flaccid penis, &quot;and I suppose the enlargement of willy is nice... but I didn&#39;t get to choose to be a werefox... and all it&#39;s got me is the threat of divorce and the hatred of our neighbors.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... you did try to rape Samantha,&quot; Martha pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I barely had any control!&quot; William answered, &quot;my mind was hazy and all I wanted was to complete what had started... she caught us before that could happen!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know... but people take rape seriously,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;You may not have been in control at the time, but that doesn&#39;t mean Samantha wanted to be raped... and it&#39;s like the incident that the werefox that scratched you put you in. She tried to rape you... did you take that personally?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose,&quot; William admitted, &quot;but she was in control of herself. She had come onto me in human form and was quite calm and flirtatious and had fully shifted and stripped when she came at me. And when my transformation finally completed... she took pot shots at you... I spent most of the night trying to get my knot OUT of her and get her to apologize for what she&#39;d said about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She didn&#39;t, I take it?&quot; Martha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She seems to think I&#39;d suddenly love her because she raped me,&quot; William answered, &quot;She doesn&#39;t understand that I love YOU and that I want to be better than I was... that I was stupid and that my bond is to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha guessed that&#39;s where William&#39;s growl came from. If his instincts were truly recognizing Martha as his bonded mate, according to the handbook Martha had read, William as would be fiercely loyal to the one he&#39;d bonded to. Of course, normally this was the in cases where a man or woman married a werefox or two werefoxes found each other. The handbook actually made little mention of what would happen if one who already loved someone else became a werefox. It actually relieved Martha a bit more that William&#39;s new instincts would lead to him being fiercely loyal to her, but she also knew that simply being loyal wouldn&#39;t be all they&#39;d have to work through.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I am glad that you wish to be faithful now,&quot; Martha answered calmly, &quot;but that still wont&#39; change what happened between you and Samantha. You may not have been in control, but it was still a personal attack on her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t... I don&#39;t,&quot; William began, uncertain, and his eyes beginning to tear up.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be hard, William,&quot; Martha told him, &quot;but that&#39;ll be one thing you&#39;ll need to do... as while I&#39;m not going to just go over there because I&#39;m horny, that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not going to be friends with Samantha and Frances... which means if you want full reconciliation with me... you&#39;ll need to demonstrate that you are not the man you were in Minnesota with regards to your fidelity... especially if Nate decides to blab about what he knows about what you&#39;ve done in the past in that regard...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nate knows?!&quot; William blinked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You left your phone out and he apparently decided to follow you on a walk,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;I was tired that day... and to be honest... I think I was a bit flustered over a woman I saw at the grocery... and was didn&#39;t want to be into anything while trying to convince myself that I was heterosexual... but Nate followed you and caught you in the act. I later caught him going through your phone... He was grounded for that, as he did have no right to spy on your privacy... but at the same time... it did reveal that you were being too easily lead by your dick and not your head... Your boys look up to you, William. I&#39;d bet that Nate was hurt by that and was afraid...&quot;<br />
<br />
The thought of Nate in pain of his actions made him drop to his knees. He had loved his family, his mistakes didn&#39;t change that, but he had been too easily lead by his dick as Martha put it And that fact brought things down on him. He found himself giving a low whine. He didn&#39;t want to hurt his family. He didn&#39;t want to lose his sons. He didn&#39;t want to lose Martha. He truly loved them dearly. Martha did notice and held him to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Show that as a werefox you&#39;ll be loyal and faithful,&quot; Martha said to him and addressed what he likely felt, &quot;embrace those instincts that bond you to me and to your family... and you won&#39;t lose your boys. And show that you are faithful to me as a werefox... show that you are apologetic to Samantha for your lack of control when she came to rescue you at MY request, and in time she may forgive you. I&#39;ll help where I can, show her the photos where you&#39;ve had your good moments... and honestly... you&#39;ve had MORE good moments than bad ones...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The bad ones have had greater impact,&quot; William whimpered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we&#39;ll get through it,&quot; Martha promised, &quot;One day at a time.&quot;</p>
