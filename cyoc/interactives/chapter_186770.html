<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Sorry about the exposition awkwardly crammed in the middle there, but I felt like with the way the story was going it would be useful to establish exactly why the characters were going to the hospital and a bit more about how the mutation liquid is treated in this world. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Flora, Sophia and their father cleaned Margret&#39;s room, the process going much faster thanks to the fact they didn&#39;t have to worry about being infected anymore. The much harder part, it turned out, was figuring out how to fit the abnormal body of the fused sisters into the family van. After spending several minutes taking out and storing all of the back seats, all the while hoping a neighbour didn&#39;t walk out and set off their desire to infect others, the sisters manged to squeeze their massive arachnid lower body and all of its sensitive bits inside just far enough for the trunk door to close. Once their children were inside, the two parents got in the front seats, the sisters feminine moth-person father sat in the drivers seat, his giant insectoid abdomen-tail folded behind him uncomfortably. His wife, no longer possessing any sort of upper body, let alone arms, sat with her trio of head-tipped cocks being held up by the seat-belt her husband put on for her. Now inside the car without incident, the four mutated family members began the drive across town to the hospital.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, already on their way to the hospital was the rest of the family, Margret and Issac, as well as Issac&#39;s girlfriend Gemma, the one who&#39;s cum transformed Sophia and set off the chain of infections that transformed the other three family members left at the house. While Margret drove, Issac and Gemma were in the back, trying their best to keep Gemma&#39;s ten horsecocks from going off in the enclosed vehicle. Unfortunately, the drive to the hospital was taking a lot longer than normal, due to the massive outbreak of mutations caused by some of the fast food sold by a restaurant (the same one that Miranda works at) having been spiked with the mutation liquid. The streets were full of ambulances carrying infected people as well as people in a similar situation to Gemma, driving or being driven to the hospital.<br />
<br />
It had been several years since the outbreaks caused by mutation liquid had begun and while the first several had had been massive disasters, usually requiring the local government to quarantine massive areas off to ensure no one who was infected made it out. After the initial outbreak, doctors spent years researching ways to fight back against the mutation liquid, and while they never managed to figure out a way to prevent people from being transformed, they managed to create a medicine that makes infected people no longer contagious. With this new advancement of medical science, it was now possible for those transformed to interact with untransformed people safely. Unfortunately, the medicine spoiled easily so it had to be kept at local hospitals. This meant that whenever an outbreak happened all of the infected people had to be brought to a hospital to be given the medicine and quarantined overnight so that the medicine could take full effect.<br />
<br />
Despite their ability to re-enter society however, many mutated people suffered from discrimination against, or a lack of accessibility for, their new forms and enhanced libidos. Luckily, things changed rather quickly when several outbreaks occurred in major government building and corporate parties, forcing the now mutated world leaders to enact policies to help mutated people adjust to their changed lives. One of the more common policies was paid time off for those transformed, allowing people the chance to get used to their new body. It was also made much easier to get your IDs updated, so that people who were fused with someone else or had other drastic bodily transformations didn&#39;t need to wade through miles of red tape just to avoid strange questions when they went to buy alcohol or were pulled over. There were also programs to make important buildings accessible for those with unwieldy bodies, mainly by making entryways and interiors larger and more open.<br />
<br />
It was for this reason that Margret was to get to the hospital as quickly as possible, so that Gemma could be given the medicine and begin the process of learning to live with her mutation. The fact that Gemma was a ticking time bomb of lust desperately attempting to hold herself back from filling the car with her infectious cum was also a good reason to hurry. Unfortunately, the amount of traffic  meant that what was normally a twenty minute drive had already taken half an hour and would probably take several more minutes at the speed they were going. In the back seat, Gemma was desperately panting, her ten cocks hard as steel and her ballsack stretched to the size of a pumpkin by her twenty testicles. Beside her, Isaac was using his phone to look up pictures of various things that he hoped would help cool her arousal. Unfortunately it seemed that fate would not be kind to the trio. A moan of pleasure echoed across the street, causing Gemma&#39;s focus to break for a moment and pushing her past the point of no return.<br />
<br />
“OH GOD, IM CUMMING!” The mutated woman screamed as she felt her balls begin pumping her infectious semen through her bushel of horsecocks. As soon as he noticed his girlfriend had lost her composure, he made a snap decision and unbuckled his seat belt and placed himself in front of Gemma in an attempt shield his sister from being infected. Gemma threw her head back in ecstasy, her cum, thickened due to the nearly half hour of edging she had endured, burst out of her cocks like a cannon. Isaac was instantly coated in several layers of his girlfriends semen, with plenty of it getting into his mouth and nose, ensuring that he wouldn&#39;t escape transformation. Soon the cum that had been bouncing off of Isaac&#39;s body had completely covered the back end of the car, and Gemma&#39;s cocks still showed no sign of stopping. Margret had leaned forwards, covering her face with a hand as she continued to inch forwards through traffic. She was worried about what was going to happen to her brother, but she also knew that it would be better for him if she continued towards the hospital. <br />
<br />
By the time Gemma&#39;s orgasm had ended, they had just arrived at the hospital parking lot. Margret rushed out of the car as soon as she turned it off, wanting to be as far away from her sister&#39;s infectious cum as possible. Gemma meanwhile stared at her unmoving boyfriend, now covered in so much cum that she couldn&#39;t see any part of him. Suddenly, Issac fell forwards. Instead of landing on Gemma however, his entire body burst like a water balloon, adding another layer of Gemma&#39;s cum to the already saturated car. Both Gemma and Margret, who was looking in through the now cum-splattered windshield, began to freak out.<br />
<br />
“Isaac!? ISAAC!” Gemma shouted, staring at the pool of cum that her boyfriend had become, hoping that he was somehow still there. Reacting to her voice, the cum began to flow together into a puddle where Issac had been before. The cum that formed into a four foot tall blob which slowly began to shape itself into the body of a skinny woman. This woman, made entirely out Gemma&#39;s still liquid of cum, had a cute, round, face with neck length hair. Her breast were barely noticeable bumps around her nipples, and her waist and hips showed only the barest hint of womanly curves before turning into a puddle of goop below her thighs. She was also short, standing eye level to Gemma despite the fact that Gemma was still sitting in the car seat.<br />
<br />
“Hey, I passed out for a moment there, what did I transform into?” The woman asked, her question, as well as her mannerisms, identifying her as Isaac. Instead of answering the question, Gemma lunged as far forward as her seat belt would let her and wrapped the the cum-girl in a hug, relived that Isaac hadn&#39;t somehow been killed by her cum. Gemma and Isaac got out of the car and let Isaac look in one of the side-view mirrors.<br />
<br />
“Wow, you really did a number on me. If I&#39;m gonna look like this from now on I think it would be easier to go by feminine pronouns. If your fine with having a girlfriend instead of a boyfriend that is.” Isaac said after taking in her new form completely.<br />
<br />
“You were still willing to have sex with me even after my transformation, so what kind of girlfriend would I be if I broke up with you over yours?” Gemma replied, wrapping her newly transformed girlfriend in a gooey hug.<br />
<br />
All right you two, we should get going. You still need to get the medicine so something like that doesn&#39;t happen again” Margret said, pointing towards the hospital&#39;s entrance.<br />
<br />
The two lovers pulled apart, and obediently followed the older woman, planning on exploring Isaac&#39;s new body while quarantined.</p>
