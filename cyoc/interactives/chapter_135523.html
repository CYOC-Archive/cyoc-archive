<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When you opened your eyes and saw that you has six limbs with a latex bright yellow exoskeleton covering your body completely. You placed your hand on your bed and slowly stand yourself up on two legs feeling the heavy latex weighing you down. Your mind was still intact, and you intended to keep it that way but first you needed to see how bad things were with your body. You looked down to see how things looked initially and your eyes widened as you were immediately drawn to  a large abdominal appendage right below your torso. This appendage was longer than any of your legs, and it hung between your legs with a large but flat stinger on the end.<br />
<br />
As shocked as you were by this you couldn’t seem to produce an audible scream, and this only concerned you more, so you decided to make your way towards the bathroom to see how you looked in the mirror. It was then you saw that your hands weren’t human anymore as you only had three fingers on each hand that were large and not very flexible with one that finger acting as a thumb on each hand, and what’s more is that you had four arms like this. You wanted to scream as loud as you could, but again you couldn’t make much of any audible sounds except for clicking.<br />
<br />
You shook your head then took a step forward, desperately grasping the walls and furniture for support as you made your way towards the exit to your room. You then felt a tingling sensation throughout your entire body and you paused and wondered if this meant that your changes weren’t done yet. You figured this was a good sign, but also an even greater motivation to see what was happening to you and more importantly to see if you could break it.<br />
<br />
You made it to your bedroom door and opened it, stumbling forwards into your hallway before you looked up and saw all sorts of swarming yellow latex insects have infested your home. The sight surprised you, and also made you a bit fearful, but the majority of the insects almost seemed like they didn’t care for you at the moment. You took this opportunity to move your way down the hall, ignoring the massive amounts of insects as a few occasionally flew by and landed on your body as you made your way to your bathroom with the large stinger of your abdomen dragging against the ground. <br />
<br />
The tingling seemed to be intensifying now and for some reason this made you feel unnaturally horny for something. You didn’t even know what it was about, but you knew for certain this lust was a bad thing. Your chest even seemed like it was getting heavier with each step you took as you leaned up against the door to your bathroom and turned the knob slowly.<br />
<br />
The door swung open and you fell forward, but managed to catch yourself on the sink before pulling yourself up to see your reflection. You peered in the mirror and paused absolutely stunned as you looked at your body in disbelief and your facial features were that of a common honey bee, and your ears and nose were replaced by a set of antenni on your head that you could move freely. The surprise of your appearance caused you to emit a buzzing sound from your back, and you looked back to see two wings that were transparent with a yellow tint.<br />
<br />
However the most shocking features of your form were just now developing on your body as two blossoming mounds appeared on your chest and two nipples appeared on each. You let out an alarmed buzz by this and you cup these mounds with two of your free hands and feel a wave of pleasure enter your body from them. It was then to your horror you realized that you had breasts and between your insect-like body and your stinger you could only conclude that you were a bee now, a humanoid latex abomination of a queen bee.<br />
<br />
You needed to run, get help while you still could from anyone at this rate. But then you peer down and you see a set of lips at the base of your abdomen that almost seem to draw you towards them. Was that a pussy? Where was your proud cock at? Most bees were female by nature so you are afraid to also conclude that this latex had turned you into a female bee, although it was the most likely scenario in this case.<br />
<br />
Being drawn to your folds you reach a hand down and penetrate yourself with one of your large fingers and your wings buzz and you let out a series of blissful clicking. The next thoughts you had were of mating with countless dromes and living in a hive colony of bees. It was then you paused and realized what you were thinking and you shook yourself back to your senses then made a mad dash for the window. You opened it and jumped through, but got stuck due to your massive abdomen, and with all the insects about you had to pull yourself through or else you feared that they would do something to you that you would never forget.<br />
<br />
After about 5 minutes of furious pulling and buzzing you manage to free yourself and get outside of your former home and you land on your all sixes and slowly get to your feet again looking down at your abdomen and it’s stinger. You looked out into the surroundings and meandered as fast as you could into the dense forest looking for someone no matter if they were human, or a latex creature that still had its mind.<br />
<br />
However you should feel a strong wave of pleasure from your pussy enter from it and your eyes widen as you look down at it and see a large lump move from it towards the rear of your abdomen. You feared for the worst as you already knew what was going to happen, and you tried to run, but the pleasurable lust soon was accompanied by a large amount of pain as you felt several large objects forcing themselves out from your abdomen.<br />
<br />
You felt your abdomen open up and your wings buzzed furiously as both pain and pleasure filled your entire body. You looked back and watched as a large rice shaped object emerged from your rear and all you could think to do was push it out, and that only sent immense surges of lust throughout your body. <br />
<br />
You barely cared about the lust now, if you wanted to run you had to get these things out of you so you kept pushing as hard as you could while buzzing as you felt one...two...three white rice shaped objects emerge. You felt like you had to masterbate now so you rolled over and leaned up against the outer wall of your cabin as you watched your abdomen expand and deposit eggs. You cupped and groped your breasts joyfully and penetrated your pussy trying to get as deep as possible as you counted for your sanity as each egg slid out stubbornly eight....nine...ten. You block out all surrounding noises at this moment and your mind becomes that of pure bliss as you plunge deeper into your sex and click with excellent with your mandibles, thirteen...fourteen...fifteen. Your breasts started leaking a gooey yellow substance that you even tasted and found it was quite sweet, and soon you were feeling pretty close to climaxing, twenty-one....twenty-two....twenty-three. Then finally the last egg was pushed out and you felt yourself climax and you let out a loud buzzing sound from your wings, and you had your first official female orgasm, and breathing heavily you stare down at a pile of rice shaped eggs and think to yourself,&quot;....twenty-seven....&quot;<br />
<br />
You couldn’t believe what you just did, or how you managed to do it, but you didn’t care. The lust was still trying it’s best to feed away at your mind, but wasn’t this form what you always wanted? The latex did make you the most desirable thing in your soul, and what’s more you now were going to start a colony. No, you needed to reverse this somehow, or find a new place where you can elude such repulsive lusts. But, you were a queen, were you not? You deserve to be treated until death by your royal army and change as many humans as possible into members of your colony, and mate with as many drones were available to you.<br />
<br />
Your mind was spinning in circles on whether you should succumb to this or not, but ultimately you....</p>
