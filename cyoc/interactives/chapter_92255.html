<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Waiting for his physical manifestation to show itself, Marty could feel the demonic power in him grow, giving his mind a flood of chemicals that opened his thinking to much darker places.<br />
<br />
“Fuck this!” Marty growled, having decided to let his physical manifestations show completely, not caring what would happen from it.<br />
<br />
“What’s that Marty?” Eric asked, hearing Marty speak.<br />
<br />
“How about you come stand next to me Eric and see the glory of your Lord?” Marty said grinning, feeling his teeth changing in his mouth as the iron filled crimson fluid began to bathe his tongue as the lining of his gums shifted.<br />
<br />
Eric simply nodded, smiled and stepped quickly closer to Marty. Eric wanted Marty to have his space, but he also wanted to be close enough to bask in what was happening to his once friend and now Lord. Seeing Eric obey, Marty grinned and inspected his teeth in the mirror, noticing that the top and bottom set of his bicuspids were only slightly longer, but definitely thicker and sharper than they ever were when he had been human. Thinking about that, the fact that he was once human and was now something beyond, made Marty chuckle. As Marty continued to focus his will on releasing the darkness to be made physical, his lips curled into an evil sneer as he watched the area above his eyebrows begin to swell. Slowly the swelling grew and filled as the small bumps that looked like small pimples, formed about an inch above the hairs at the ends of his brow near his temples. Grinning wickedly, Marty watched as the small bumps grew into nubs as the skin stretched and tried to remain intact. However, within moments, the nubs grew larger to the point where the growth beneath caused the skin to split as the growth was revealed to be the very sharp tips of demonic horns. Slowly the tips began extending outward, the horns lengthening while the skin around the protrusions clung to the new appendages and trying to remain sealed against the new exposed bone.<br />
<br />
“Fuck…” Eric moaned as he gasped from the sight, feeling himself becoming freer suddenly.<br />
<br />
Simultaneously Marty grinned and blissfully moaned, “Fuck yeah! You like seeing your Lord like this, don’t you Eric?”<br />
<br />
Eric smiled deviously and nodded, as if with the horns breaching the flesh made Marty’s power all the more influential. Without saying anything, Marty focused back on his reflection and thought about how the mall had become his playground, a testing area for what he was truly capable of. The wicked grin that was still on his lips grew as the clefts of his lips turned upward further as Marty decided that those he chose there would become the beginning of his army. He would use the men there to go out and corrupt others who were worthy into his demonic minions that were similar to himself… though Marty still wasn’t sure what kind of were “The Powers That Be” made him into. He was nearly certain that he would be a demonic version of a werewolf, but that had yet to be seen. With the tips of his horns being exposed, Marty closed his eyes and focused on the building, sensing all of the men there totaling one hundred including himself, Eric, store employees, two mall security guards and two male cops having lunch in the food court. Sensing the cops, more than anyone else, made his now dark heart jump in excitement because they were definitely more of an asset than anyone else. They were his access point to corrupting the precinct and beyond to gain a level of control in an “easier” way. Knowing that there was the perfect mix of subject and fodder, Marty grinned while Eric just looked at him, fawning over him, wanting nothing more than to please his Lord any way he wanted.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to lose his opportunity with this perfect mix of male specimen, Marty grinned while closing his eyes for a single moment and focused on the mall itself. Focusing his mind on all of the doors that could provide a means of escape, Marty drew on his power and focused it into a ball in his hand. Swirling and fiery, the ball of energy grew and developed growing large to the point where it filled the palm of his upturned hand. Now his mind and powers concentrated on the intended targets, Marty grinned sinisterly and clenched his fingers into a fist as the ball of energy exploded in his hand. Marty kept smiling as he walked toward the door while Eric followed, ensuring that he didn’t stray too far from his dark Lord. Marty quickly exited the private bathroom and walked down the hall back into the bulk of the mall, with all of the men around slowed or stopped to focus their attention on him while the women looked on in terror, not knowing what to make of him. Not giving those men the time of day, for the moment, Marty focused his attention on the nearby exterior doors. As he looked on, Marty saw that what was once a means of escape had been replaced by a solid wall from the ground up. Those who were there to witness the mall exits change were distraught, screaming, pounding on them with their fists while drawing other people there as well. Marty grinned from the enjoyment the chaos was bringing him. Now that the mall was sealed and no one could escape, it was time to further become what he was meant to and develop his army.</p>
