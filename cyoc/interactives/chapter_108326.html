<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary wasn&#39;t sure when she drifted off, but she awoke to the sound of birds chirping.  Surprised by how loud they were, Mary wondered sleepily if she had left a window ajar.  Still drowsy, she reached out a hand for her bedside alarm clock...and nearly fell off the sofa.  Shocked awake by the sudden rush of adrenaline, Mary blinked a few times, then lifted her head, but something was still protruding into her vision.  Absently, she raised a hand to push it away...and saw a paw land on the end of her nose...no, her muzzle!<br />
<br />
The memories of the day before came rushing back, and Mary&#39;s tail started wagging involuntarily.  Finally alert, she couldn&#39;t help but wiggle with anticipation at the day ahead.  No chores, no responsibilities, and best of all, John waiting on her hand and...well, paw.  Too excited to sit still, Mary hopped off the couch and trotted confidently over to the kitchen, where the chair still sat near the sink.  Jumping up the counter, she expertly opened the tap and sated her thirst, after which she easily jumped down and pushed the chair back to the table. <br />
<br />
Impatient for her adventure to begin, Mary bounced over to the window, which had a low enough sill for her to peer outside while on her hind legs.  She was astounded by how sharp her hearing had become, as despite the closed window, she could still hear birds outside and vehicles passing with astounding clarity.  Even when a neighbor exited and called out to a friend, she could hear his words as though the glass did not exist.  She was brought back to reality by the sound of a key in the lock of her front door.  <i>  John! </i>  Mary thought with a joyful yip, and bounded towards the front of her apartment.  Stopping before the door, she looked up with tongue lolling and tail wagging at the entrant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you must be the distinguished guest,&quot;  John said gently as he carefully slipped inside, making sure he didn&#39;t open the door wide enough for the gleeful spaniel to bolt out.  Closing the door behind him, he slowly walked over to the seemingly friendly dog, and lowed his hand in front of the dog for it to sniff.  Mary was astounded by the range of scents which she was able to distinguish just from John&#39;s hand.  Soap, butter, bacon, coffee, aftershave, and an undertone of something else.  Curious, Mary nosed John&#39;s hand eagerly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, no treats for you.  At least you don&#39;t bite,&quot;  John observed, then lifted his hand to scratch behind Mary&#39;s ears.  The sensation of sheer pleasure was something that caught Mary by surprise.  Her lower lip quivered slightly and her eyelids drooped as she surrendered to the feeling.  She couldn&#39;t help but whine softly when he stopped.  Walking over to the table, he spotted the note Mary had written.  &quot;Missy, huh?  Nice to meet you, Missy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary wagged her tail happily, sitting back on her haunches and looking up at John expectantly.  John stepped over and reached under her chin to finger the &quot;collar&quot; which Mary had quickly fashioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not much of a collar;  really should have a talk with your owner about that,&quot;  John straightened up and gazed around.  &quot;Looks like there&#39;s no leash either.  Wonder how your owner expected Mary to walk you.  Not very good pet care,&quot;  he grumbled, but his eyes softened as he looked down at the pooch.  &quot;I guess we&#39;ll have to use my extras.  C&#39;mere girl,&quot;  John called as he squatted down.  Mary stood up on all fours and padded over, but was surprised by what happened next.  Reaching around, John scooped her up in his arms.  &quot;I&#39;ll just have to carry you for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
When Mary came to her senses, she couldn&#39;t believe her good luck!  She was actually cradled gently in John&#39;s arms, something she would never have had the courage to do had she been in human form.  She couldn&#39;t stop her tail from wagging with happiness, and she finally determined what that unique undertone was she had smelled on John&#39;s hands.  Now that she was right up against him, she realized that it was John&#39;s own body scent, and breathed deeply to imprint it upon her mind.  She was so engrossed that what happened next caught her completely off guard.  Turning her a bit, John lifted her slightly and looked under her lower abdomen, using his free hand to stroke her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t see a scar;  not even spayed, huh?  Some owner,&quot;  John frowned, but then sighed.  &quot;At least Max is neutered, so he shouldn&#39;t cause too much trouble.&quot;  Mortified, Mary froze up, not resisting when John moved her about in his arms.  She hadn&#39;t even thought about the fact that as a dog, she was fertile.  What if Max was not neutered?  Technically, she might have puppies!  Or was that even possible since she was human?  What if she became pregnant as a dog and then took the human vial?  Would the embryos become human too?  Or would they grow inside her as canines?  Realizing she may have bitten off more than she could chew, Mary couldn&#39;t help but whine anxiously and tuck her tail between her legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, it&#39;s okay girl,&quot;  John said soothingly, petting her, and assuming her reaction was to his prodding.  Although still nervous, John&#39;s ministrations definitely had a soothing effect, and while not exactly carefree anymore, Mary snuggled closer against John&#39;s chest.  Satisfied that he could control his new charge, John stood up and exited Mary&#39;s apartment with her in his arms and locked up behind him.  Turning, he headed down the hallway with Mary.</p>
