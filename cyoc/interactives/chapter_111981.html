<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Aeuhhh...&quot; Cassie shrugs, trying to not show the repulsion she felt at being talked to that way by her boyfriend. &quot;Hi Nate.&quot; She says, unable to maintain eye contact with him. &quot;And yes, I went in my diaper just a few minutes ago...&quot;<br />
<br />
As Nathaniel takes her hand and gives her reassuring encouragement as he guides her into the laundry room, Cassie is questioning if she has the resolve to go through with this.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;And wait, why are we going into the laundry room?&quot;</i> Cassie thought to herself. <i>&quot;Well, I can&#39;t ask about it. They all think I&#39;m as used to this as they are.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
The two of them walked in, and Nathaniel put his hands under Cassie&#39;s arms and hoisted her up onto the washer and dryer. The cold machines gave her an uncomfortable chill through her clothes as she was laid down. Her neck/head was bothering her as well; not having any pillow on this metallic surface wasn&#39;t very comfortable, but then, the process of having one&#39;s diaper changed was probably going to be uncomfortable for a number of reasons. Including, for example, your own boyfriend (well, now-former boyfriend) being the one to perform the change.<br />
<br />
Cassie tried to avoid looking at Nate as she felt the pressing of hands against her pelvis, followed by the sound of tearing. She felt air creeping into her diaper-area now that the seal had been broken. Right as this happened, Nicholas came into the room behind them. Cassie was upsetted by this.<br />
&quot;What are you doing in here, Nick? Don&#39;t watch!&quot; She glares at him.<br />
<br />
Nicholas chuckles and walks in, hands in pockets.<br />
&quot;What &#39;ya talking about, sis? I watch &#39;ya get your diapa&#39; changed all the time! I&#39;s gotta learn how to do it myself some time. Every time I try, it turns into a disaster, ya&#39;hear?&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Oh lord, Nick changes my diapers sometimes? This transformation is getting worse every second. And <b>oh my god</b>, Nick still does that fake tough-guy accent when he&#39;s making fun of me in THIS version of reality too? I swear to god, nick, I&#39;m going to fucking kill you...&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Cassie&#39;s furious monologue was cut off the moment Nate reached over, grabbed the front of her diaper by the hem and unfolded it. The moment that Cassie had to face truth had come: her private parts were exposed, in front of two guys no less, both of whom are close to her. Oh, and her privates are covered in her own mess.<br />
<br />
&quot;So hey, you want me to show you my techniques on getting a bottom cleaned up?&quot; Nathan asks of Nick.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Please don&#39;t...&quot;</i> Cassie silently pleads.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmhm!&quot; Nicholas nods, getting in closer to his exposed older sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okie dokie.&quot; Nathaniel says, pulling out a wipe and arranging his fingers into it. &quot;The first thing we wanna do is get the primary clump off of the skin and separated from the rest of it.&quot; He explained, doing just that.<br />
<br />
While she was almost dizzy from how much blood had been pumping up to her head in the form of blush, Cassie did certainly feel extremely relieved to have that very uncomfortable lump no longer stuck to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Next, we need to do a good preliminary wipe.&quot; Nate looked over at Nick, who he could tell didn&#39;t know what the word &#39;preliminary&#39; meant. &quot;...we need to do another wipe to get the big, bulky sections of poop now.&quot; He re-explained.<br />
<br />
Nick watched as Nate swooshed his hand around with deft precision around his girlfriend&#39;s regressed bottom.<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of times, these first two wipes I just did aren&#39;t necessary.&quot; Nate says. &quot;But since it&#39;s obvious Cassie sat down in her poop at least once, it made the job a little more complicated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mhm, yeah. Cassie is always doing stuff that makes her mess messier.&quot; Nicholas nods.<br />
<br />
Cassie&#39;s face feels so heavy and hot that she thinks her nose might be running. She realizes now, that she&#39;s been staring right at them for the last 30 seconds. She decides to pull herself away, stare at the ceiling and try not to think about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now you gotta get the more specific spots.&quot; Nate continues, applying another wipe that Cassie has to wince and hold her breath through.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, ooh, are you gonna do the step I&#39;m not allowed to do now?&quot; Nicholas asks.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;...not allowed...?&quot;</i> Cassie thinks. The room suddenly feels deathly quiet, to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep.&quot; Nate answers. &quot;In juuust a bit...&quot; He wipes up a few more spots.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; Nick says, turning around and facing the wall.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;What are you going to do, Nate...?&quot;</i> She thinks to herself, wincing and closing her eyes.<br />
<br />
The wipe won&#39;t be described here. Just go on the record that the female anatomy has one troublesome area that must be cleaned in a situation such as this.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Uh... well, that wasn&#39;t much worse than the rest of this, really.&quot;</i> Cassie thought to herself. <i>&quot;I&#39;m glad Nick didn&#39;t see it though.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
Her brother then turns back around the second Nate tells him that the move is done.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Though I WISH he didn&#39;t see ANY of it!&quot;</i> Cassie groans to herself.<br />
<br />
Nathan swaps the old diaper for a new one, pops off the last few wipes to polish her off a bit, and balls all the wipes up into the diaper.<br />
&quot;Can you throw that away for me, Nick?&quot; He asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot; Nick says, grabbing it with an astonishing two-hands and carrying it to the diaper disposal device on the other side of the room.<br />
<br />
There&#39;s a first for everything, and Cassie can confidently say that was the first time her younger brother had carried away her dirty diaper to the trash. Well, the first time from her perspective.<br />
<br />
Cassie had to admit; she felt incredibly relieved to be free of that mess she had made for herself. And while it would have been vastly less demeaning, she is confident that changing it herself would have been nightmarishly difficult. And plus, if there were anyone on earth she would feel comfortable doing this for her, it would be the man she&#39;s trusted with her body already.<br />
<br />
Cassie feels a sprinkling on her skin, reminding her that it&#39;s not quite over yet.<br />
&quot;Now be sure, when doing the powder, to get it on the skin, and not on the diaper. Okay?&quot; Nate explains.<br />
<br />
What follows is another strange moment; that of Nathan rubbing the powder into Cassie&#39;s privates. Every touch of her he had made before now, at least had the touch of a baby wipe in-between. This time, however, it was unfiltered skin-to-skin. Cassie was numb to the humiliation by this point; she was just glad to have it over with and glad that her lover was the one who did it.<br />
<br />
She would have thought that Nathaniel would be the <i>last</i> person she&#39;d want doing it, but that would have more to do with what Nate would think of her, seeing her in this state. Because of the influence of the transformation, however, Nate did not think less of her or have any reservations about her. He had no recollection of having been her boyfriend; he was just a babysitter, and she was just a little girl who had never been toilet-trained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heyyyy!!! What&#39;s going onnnnn???&quot; An overly-excited chippy voice belts into the laundry room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Raytch.&quot; Nick says. &quot;Nice dress.&quot; He remarks.<br />
<br />
From Cassie&#39;s position, she isn&#39;t able to see Rachel. But she hates the fact that Rachel can probably see <i>her</i>. It won&#39;t matter in just a second, though, as Nathan is finally folding her diaper up and over her, reclaiming at least some of her dignity. She feels a series of firm, deft tugs against her pelvis--as well as a tightening around her crotch--as Nate tapes her diaper closed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alrighty, that&#39;s it. Good girl~&quot; Nathaniel says, patting the front of her diaper and walking over to the laundry room sink to clean his hands.<br />
<br />
Cassie sighs in relief and sits up, seeing Rachel standing there in a green dress with pink flowers, which goes down to her thighs. Her mom is also there; standing in the hallway outside of the laundry room. More notably, Rachel&#39;s got this ridiculous grin on her face. She&#39;s at first annoyed by it, but as Rachel keeps on staring at her like that, Cassie ends up uncontrollably grinning back at her. As the two of them exchange this stare, it becomes clear that they are connected on a wavelength invisible to everyone else.<br />
<br />
Cassie leans over and looks at the floor. She planned on sliding down there herself, but it turns out to be a lot more of a jump than she was prepared for. Adjusting to her new size wasn&#39;t easy. She sees Nate about done drying his hands, though, and she wants to reclaim at least a little independence for herself, so she holds her breath, slides her diapered bottom forward and lets her feet fall to the floor.<br />
<br />
Nathan and Grace start talking about an array of random things as everyone walks out of the laundry room, with Nicholas circling around them, trying to be part of the conversation as they walk into the kitchen. Rachel, conversely, opens the door leading to the garage, looks over at Cassie, and sticks out her finger.<br />
&quot;Hey. Com&#39;ere.&quot; She says softly.<br />
<br />
Cassie, wanting to break away from the others, follows her lead and walks into the garage. As soon as the door is closed, Rachel turns around and faces Cassie.<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t this the most cool thing ever created??!&quot; She exclaims, trying to not be too loud, shaking both of her fists.<br />
<br />
Cassie bites her lip.<br />
&quot;What, this transformation? I dunno.&quot; She holds her hands together behind her bottom. &quot;I just feel gross and embarrassed. And weird. And childish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey that reminds me,&quot; Rachel said as she walked over to one of the foldout chairs sitting in the garage, &quot;when I came over, why were you wearing a diaper in the first place? Something about your mom right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, she was just being really annoying about my history grades.&quot; Cassie mumbled, sitting down on a large rolled-up carpet; taking notice of just how comfortable it is to sit down in one of these diapers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh haha.&quot; Rachel nods and giggles. Cassie&#39;s history grades were a constant source of gratification for Rachel, as Cassie did better than her in every single subject, except in history where she often did worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up.&quot; Cassie said, looking down at her feet. &quot;It&#39;s not a big deal. My mom was totally fucking overreacting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you&#39;d better watch your language! That would sound really weird coming out of a ten-year-old, lol!&quot; Rachel yells at her, saying &#39;lol&#39; out loud.<br />
<br />
Cassie chuckles.<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess we should be trying to role play little kids a little better than we are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Totally. What are all the kids into these days? You have a brother who&#39;s <i>actually</i> a little kid. You should know this stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t really know. All my brother does is play Smash Bros and watch Cartoon Network all day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well!&quot; Rachel leaps to her feet. &quot;I guess we aren&#39;t going to be like &#39;normal&#39; kids, anyway!&quot; She says, lifting up her dress and poking her diaper in front of Cassie.<br />
<br />
Cassie just looks at her.<br />
&quot;...you are so energetic now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude! I have so much energy in this body you won&#39;t belieeeeve it!!&quot; Rachel spreads out her arms and starts running circles in the garage. &quot;I wanna do something!! I wanna do something FUN, RIGHT NOW!&quot; She yells, running out of the garage, heading straight for Grace and crashing into her, then immediately tugging on her clothes. (While Cassie had tugged on her shirt earlier, Rachel now came up significantly lower and was tugging on her pant leg.)<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom! Mom! Mom!&quot; She says, completely interrupting her and Nathaniel&#39;s conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, what is it sweetie?&quot; Grace takes a second to shift gears and look down at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s do something fun! I wanna do something RIGHT NOW.&quot; She exclaims, tightening her grip on Grace&#39;s pants.<br />
<br />
Grace and Nate look at each other, thinking about what kind of activity they could do.</p>
