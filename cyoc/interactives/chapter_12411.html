<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Drake stood staring at his new reflection in the mirror.  He decided<br />
to summon the Djinn once more to &quot;tweak&quot; his new body.  The Djinn <br />
granted the wish and Drake began to transform again, just not as<br />
radically.  His skin on his chisled face sprouted a thick growth of<br />
beard reaching several inches in length.  His scalp began to tingle.<br />
Drake stroked his hands across his head, brushing away clumps of <br />
hair until his entire dome was completely bald.  the dense patch of<br />
pubic hair also fell away from his groin.  Ethan had mentioned before<br />
that his perfect man was a Bald-headed muscle-god.  Drake was now<br />
Ethan's perfect man. And Drake would then turn Ethan into his own<br />
perfect man.  And as he pulled some stretched out sweat pants from<br />
the closet, Drake heard Ethan's car drive into the garage.<br />
     Drake yelled from the bedroom for Ethan not to come back there,<br />
because there was a surprise for Ethan.  Drake came from the<br />
bedroom and slowly walked the hall to the den and Ethan.  The second<br />
Ethan saw Drake, he asked who Drake was, and where was Drake.  Drake<br />
grinned huge beneath his beard, then told Ethan it was he.  Ethan<br />
was dumbfounded.  He slowly circled around Drake looking closely,<br />
and trying to process all the changes.  Drake told Ethan that now Ethan's biggest fantasy was coming true...Ethan had his perfect man.<br />
Ethan just continued to grin and stare.  Finally, he reached up and<br />
fondled Drake's Bald head.  Then he turned to face Drake and said<br />
that he didn't have the words to say how he felt, but he wanted to<br />
know what he could do for Drake.  Drake said that the Djinn already<br />
had the instructions.  Drake asked Ethan if he had any idea what<br />
was about to happen to him.  Ethan said he sure did, and couldn't<br />
think of any change Drake would wish for him that would give him pause.  He just wanted to make sure that he got his clothes off first, and that he would get to be bald-headed also.  Drake grinned and said, absolutely.  He declared that it was time to begin, and<br />
heard the Djinn state as usual, It is done.  Ethan swayed a bit and<br />
leaned against the door frame.  His entire body began to expand and<br />
grow.  Drake brushed Ethan's scalp until all the hair was gone from<br />
Ethan's head just like his own.  Ethan noticed more intense sensations in his belly and chest.  He looked down and watched his once-taut pecs balloon into mantits, while his mid section expanded<br />
into a huge firm and taut ball belly bearing an extremely large<br />
bellybutton, large in diameter, and several inches deep.  His new<br />
gut must be at least 55-60 inches around.  Drake pulled out his<br />
own newly enhanced prick and balls.  Ethan gasped, they were huge,<br />
and Ethan had grown a foreskin.  Drake said, Your turn, Bud.  Ethan's<br />
genitals grewto the same huge size as Drake's, even growing his own<br />
foreskin down over his fat cockhead, hanging about two inches below<br />
the tip.  Ethan felt his body subside, and realized he was done for now.  He immediately began to feel his new shape and size, finally being joined by Drake.  Even with his huge new uncut cock and egg-sized balls, Ethan realized he was most intrigued by his enormous<br />
new gut and mantits.  He turned every direction at the mirror checking out his new body from every angle he could.  Finally he<br />
turned to Drake.  They stood together at the mirror, both in awe of<br />
what the were seeing.  Drake pulled away and got them both beers from the kitchen.  Ethan was still getting used to balancing his new<br />
gut, so Drake pushed him to the couch.  He fired up one of his<br />
special 10&quot;, 60 ring, dark madura wrapped Honduran cigars, locked it<br />
in his jaw, then set to posing for his admiring partner.  During the<br />
session, Drake noticed that Ethan was unable to sit upright on the sofa.......he had to almost recline because of his new gut. PERFECT!<br />
And to his absolute pleasure, Drake stared as Ethan used his hard<br />
gigantic ballbelly as his table.  Ethan's beer bottle set securely<br />
on top of the firm gut, just as Drake had wanted.  Drake brought more beer, and heard Ethan request one of Drake's good cigars as well.  As Ethan was clipping the end, he told Drake that he would now be a fulltime cigar smokin' man, just as Drake had become.  <br />
Drake let Ethan talk, as he picked up the big glass ashtray from the counter.  Without a word, Drake set the ashtray on Ethan's gut.  It<br />
never even wabbled, just sat even and secure.  Drake found the digital camera and took pics of Ethan and his gut laid out on the sofa, as his gut held his beer and the ashtray.  Drake helped Ethan to stand and took more pics of his new ballbellied partner.  He had<br />
Ethan to pull on the slacks he'd worn earlier.  Surprising to both<br />
of them, Ethan managed to get them up, but was unable to fasten them<br />
even at his &quot;waist&quot; underneath that big belly.  He replaced them with<br />
sweat pants that stretched enough to fit the waist.  Ethan pulled on<br />
a tee shirt, and it wouldn't pull down over that new gut.  It just<br />
bunched-up about midway down.  Ethan grinned,and Drake felt his just <br />
enlarged and uncut prick jerk and begin to stiffen at the sight of<br />
Ethan's ill-fitting clothes.  Ethan took the camera and set about<br />
making pics and pics of Drake's new &quot;muscle-god' body.  Ethan got them both fresh big maduro's and kept making pics of Drake.  <br />
    Ethan put the camera down, and pulled a cloth tape measure from<br />
the cabinet.  He motioned for Drake to join him at the mirror, and <br />
told Drake that it was time to see just how big this new ballbelly<br />
of his measured.  Drake could not reach around Ethan, so they worked<br />
together to make sure the tape placement was right so they'd be <br />
accurate.  To Drake's obvious elation, and Ethan's wonder, his newly<br />
grown ballbelly was exactly 59 1/2 inches around.  Ethan also had<br />
Drake measure the circumference of the taut gut jutting out from<br />
Ethan's middle.  The ballbelly measured 59 inches as well.  Drake<br />
measured Ethan's bellybutton opening at 1 3/4 inches across, and<br />
5 inches deep.  Ethan's new enlarged chest with those big old mantits<br />
measured 52 inches.  Drake moved the tape beneath the big belly.  <br />
The 'waist' measured just 44 inches, showing that that big new gut<br />
jutted out 16 inches from his body.  His thighs were 28 inches,<br />
and his flexed bicep measured 18 inches.  Then it was Drake's turn.<br />
His neck was 18 1/2inches, his biceps were 23inches, his unflexed chest measured 56 inches, and his waist 32 inches.  Ethan put the tip of the tape at Drake's chin and measured the length of his beard.<br />
The thick hair was 6 inches from the tip of the chin to the end.<br />
   Drake grabbed more beer and Ethan went to get more maduros.  The<br />
maduros were gone, so he took two of the Macanudo's 6' 50 ring from<br />
the humidor.  Drake declared it was time to make a run to the tobacco store.  They needed to try out all the new changes in<br />
public anyway.  That would be a good place to start.</p>
