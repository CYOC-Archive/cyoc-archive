<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;…with a weather front brewing, we can expect a moderate rainstorm to unleash upon the Washington State later this afternoon. In other news; Frederick Parker’s status has be upgraded to stable. Still not out of the woods after being shot at; the mobster is currently in a medically induced coma. Meanwhile, the individual Jose as per Police reports, identified as the man who tried to kill Frederick Parker was apprehended late last night after trying to evade police in the woods. Now in the custody of the FBI, Jose is currently sitting in a holding cell in the county lockup in Seattle. An investigation is pending as to who hired the man to commit this foul deed in our town…”<br />
<br />
A tawny furred paw touches the alarm radio; silencing the KCML news report as the waking were-lioness slowly rises from her slumber. Opening her maw to yawn as she struggles to remain awake; a gruff moan could be heard next to her. Turning her head, she smiles as the slumbering man next to her was trying to keep her lying down in bed.<br />
“Come on Nate,” the were-lioness chuckling; “it’s time to get up.”<br />
“But I already got up to deal with him,” Nate mumbling; “It’s your turn to see why our son is so fussy.”<br />
<br />
“Son,” Jean looking at the Adonis next to her; completely dumbfounded as she looks at Nate still sleeping. “Wake up you sleepy werewolf,” Jean covering Nate’s nose with her paw; “dream time is over and we both have school today.”<br />
<br />
Watching Nate struggle to breath, Jean chuckles as she wonders what kind of dream Nate was having. Now with his eyes wide open and his hands flailing about; Jean giggles as she lets go of him, leaping out of bed before Nate could react.<br />
“Not funny,” Nate coughing; “you could have killed me.”<br />
“Hardly,” Jean smiling; “besides we can’t spend the entire day in bed.”<br />
“We did a couple of days ago,” Nate slowly sitting up in bed; “it was quite fun as I recall.”<br />
“We were on summer break,” Jean getting a robe and putting it on as she starts to de-fur. The tawny fur retreating; giving way to smooth porcelain like skin and curly auburn hair. Her muzzle shrinking back into her face; cat whiskers disappearing and the black triangle nose reverting to a more human like appearance. “You and I both have school today,” Jean exhaling after shifting out of her fursona; “despite getting attacked Monday, you are not missing your second day.”<br />
<br />
“Well look who’s turning into mom,” Nate rolling his eyes; “are you going to badger me to eat my vegetables? Brush my teeth and do my homework before playing?”<br />
“If I have to,” Jean giving a malicious grin; “I got the shower first, you can have it after I’m done. Later you can tell me all about that dream you had.”<br />
<br />
“Dream,” Nate looking puzzled; watching Jean leave the room as he slowly moves to the edge of the bed. Grabbing his cane to help him up, Nate notices that the vertigo feeling he got when standing up was not as bad as yesterday. Getting attacked by two were-panthers Monday evening; Nate had to spend the night at the hospital after losing consciousness in the Emergency Room. Finding out later that his inner ear was damaged; Nate was told to forego shifting into his werewolf fursona for at least a week, giving his body time to recover from the attack. Having to walk with a cane for the time being; Nate trudged to the door before stopping in his tracks. Looking at himself in the mirror, Nate realized that he was naked. Seeing his well-endowed manhood and powerful six pack abs; Nate couldn’t help but growl in approval as he absently flexed his free arm and twitching his pectoral muscles.<br />
<br />
Pausing as he grabs his robe; a present Jean got for him as Nate spends as much time with her at her parents place as Jean does at his parents place. Putting it on, Nate looks closely at the beard he was growing; a goatee without a moustache.<br />
“A slight trim today,” Nate smiling; “The side burns must go as well.”<br />
<br />
Taking a step back and turning around, Nate opens the door to the silent and slightly dark hallway. Walking past Peter’s room; Nate can’t help but wonder if Jean opened the door to check up on her older brother. A were-lion recovering from a gunshot wound; a wound given to him by Daniel Parker, over his ’66 mustang. An incident that set off a violent chain of events perpetrated by Frederick parker as he came storming into town; determined to get Daniel out of jail.<br />
<br />
Opting not to tempt danger, Nate kept walking to the bathroom; Knowing that Peter has a were-rabbit who he is sharing his bed with. Both he and Jean heard the were-lion roar proudly as he rutted with the willing were. Finding out through Jean and the rest of the Talbot family, that the were-rabbit in question is not only his doctor Helen Tompkins, but also his mate. Not wanting to go over how the two hooked up in the literal sense, Nate arrives at the bathroom. Hearing the shower running, he smiles as he walks right on in.<br />
<br />
“Ready or not I’m coming in,” Nate closing the bathroom door; removing his bathrobe as he heads to the shower door. “Room for two,” Nate grinning as he sees Jean’s back turned to him; “I’ll do your back if you do mine.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
In the next room, Peter slowly opens his eyes as he hears Jean’s alarm clock going off. Looking in front of him, Peter rumbles as he smiles; lying on chest and hugging him was Helen Tompkins. The grey furred were-rabbit slowly rising up and down as he breathed, Peter places his large leonine paw on the small of her back; cupping it gently as he can still feel is member inside her.<br />
“She must have passed out right after we rutted,” Peter thinking to himself; watching her small furry tail twitch as his he feels himself getting hard.<br />
<br />
Resisting the temptation to start thrusting as Helen was still sleeping; Peter carefully removes her from the position of being spread eagle and face down on top of him. A loud shlurp could be heard as his now hard feline member slides out; the fleshy barbs digging into Helen as he pulls out, causing Helen to moan from the unintended sexual stimulation.<br />
Carefully laying her down so she doesn’t fall off the bed; Peter slides over some so the two could lay on their side while staring at each other.<br />
“Such a beautiful pink nose,” Peter quietly speaking; looking at Helen as he sees her nose still twitching, despite Helen still sound asleep. Wondering if it is a trait passed over from the rabbit strain of the were-virus; Peter keeps staring for a little while longer. Unable to resist himself; Peter licks Helen with his large rough tongue, letting it roll up from Helen’s furry mouth and scraping her sensitive nose. Peter keeps this up, determined to wake her up.</p>
