<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John thought quietly on the things that Jenny had told him as he moved through the Jenkins home. The fact that Jenny still had her old worries and fears over things that their father had done to them was something of a surprise, as after all, she looked happy and healthy with Harry at her side now. It was a perception that she was better when it came to her marriage, and perhaps she was, but the reminder that some things still lingered was a surprise to John. Though, in some ways it was a bit of relief and he also felt glad that Jenny had his back when it came to things related to both whether or not he became a were or who inducted him. That was all good and eased some of his own worries as he moved to carry out his assignment to get Janice to set the table for dinner.<br />
<br />
The hallway was fairly dark as he made his way through it, but he could see light coming from the room that he and Janice were essentially sharing while waiting for the project to turn the attic space above the garage into an apartment for Jenny and Harry. It wasn&#39;t a large room by any means, and Henry Jenkins Senior had had to set up a cot for John to sleep on, but it was reasonably comfortable, and John supposed it would make sense that Janice would be there if she wasn&#39;t anywhere else in the house. He thus came to the door and looked in, only to find that there was no one there. The light was on, but no one was in the bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Janice?&quot; John called into the room as he entered, wondering if Janice was hiding somewhere for some prank or was looking for something, &quot;are you in here?&quot;<br />
<br />
For the moment there was no answer, and John continued to make his way in, wondering if there was something else going on. He came around his cot and found that Janice was not laying on the floor between the bed and the cot. He sank down to one knee and looked under the bed and she wasn&#39;t there either. He stood back up and came around to the other side of the bed and found that Janice wasn&#39;t on the floor of the other side of the bed either. This only puzzled him a bit more as he looked around, trying to figure out where his younger sister was. The window was shut and the inside latch was closed, which meant that Janice couldn&#39;t have climbed out the window, but yet the light to the room had been on and she wasn&#39;t in the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Janice?!&quot; John called again, this time raising his voice a little, only to have it interrupted by the sound of the toilet flushing in the bathroom that was on the other side of the wall that was behind the headboard of Janice&#39;s bed. A few moments after that, Janice appeared in the doorway to the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up, John?&quot; Janice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where were you?&quot; John wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was in here working on the crochet project that Mrs. Jenkins was helping me with when I had to go to the bathroom,&quot; Janice said as she approached the bed and then lifted up a small bit of cloth or yarn that was there. &quot;What&#39;s up, John?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny said you&#39;d promised Lisa Jenkins to help set the table,&quot; John commented as he looked to what Janice had been putting together as part of her crochet project.<br />
<br />
It was largely blue, though John also thought it went in a sort of waiving up and down, sort of like it was to look like water drawn on paper, but so far that was about as far as Janice had gotten on the project. That reminded him of the fact that while he had his own issues that related to things like whether or not he was gay or bi or straight... and how he would relate to Ginger O&#39;Toole... that in some ways he wasn&#39;t alone in that. Janice seemed a bit more sure of who she was than John did, but with that had also come her own desires as well. Janice had spoken frequently enough on them that John knew that a good part of Janice&#39;s mind was focused on Moon Lake&#39;s weremers, though they hadn&#39;t met any, yet. In this, John figured the project was likely going to be something related to Janice&#39;s desire to be a weremer. Janice nodded in response and then picked the yarn and other materials and then set them under her arm and nodded to John, who recognized that she was ready and followed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what did you think I was doing?&quot; Janice asked as John turned the light off as he left the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know... hiding or trying to play some prank,&quot; John answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I did... it&#39;d be in good fun and I&#39;d expect you to get me back,&quot; Janice commented, &quot;all part of our happy ever after here in Moon Lake. Jenny with Harry. You with Ginger and me with a weremer... at least to become a were, anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s what you&#39;re working on with this project?&quot; John asked as he gestured to the project Janice was working on, &quot;you making out with a weremer?&quot;<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t necessarily a good joke, but given some of the stuff that Janice had pulled regarding him and Ginger, John tried to see if he could get one joke of his own in. Janice only smiled back and took it in stride.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was mostly thinking I&#39;d put in a mermaid&#39;s tail and so on,&quot; Janice answered, &quot;people could then think of it as some fantasy design. You know, since Moon Lake wants to keep all the were stuff secret...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For now,&quot; John corrected, knowing about a lot of the other things going on in the background of the town they would now get to live in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Regardless,&quot; Janice answered, &quot;the idea was to show a generic mermaid. Nothing that would be too out of place. Though so far I&#39;d only put the ocean part in. I hadn&#39;t gotten as far as putting in the mermaid, yet. Lisa will help a bit when I get to that.&quot;<br />
<br />
John nodded as they walked along as they came into the living room. Janice moved to set her things down on the couch in one area where know one would sit on them and they would also stand out. With that done, the two made their way into the kitchen where Janice was to collect the plates and other dishes to set the table. John tagged along and figured he&#39;d help with things as they progressed. They had to dodge their way through some traffic as Lisa was still working on dinner and Jenny was there to at least pass things to Lisa as they were needed, but it wasn&#39;t too difficult for the youngest members of the Harper family.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad that you&#39;ve found things to be happy about here,&quot; John said to her after a moment and their entrance into the dining room with the first set of utensils that would be needed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we&#39;ve both found things to be happy about here,&quot; Janice commented, &quot;mom and dad can&#39;t bully us anymore. You&#39;ve made a friend and we&#39;ll all get to be happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
John sort of half nodded at that. Some things weren&#39;t perfect and he knew he had his own private issues to wrestle with and answers that he sought, but he ultimately did have to agree that things were actually going rather well, all things considered. Jenny was happy and despite his worries, he felt some relief that he and Janice wouldn&#39;t be a burden to the Jenkins family. All that remained was figuring out where he stood with regard to his own leanings, which set his mind wandering to a certain weretigress that had been teaching him how to play chess... but he wouldn&#39;t see Ginger again until after dinner.</p>
