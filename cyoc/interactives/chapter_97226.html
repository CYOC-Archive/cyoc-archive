<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">"Well I figured we could set up our avatars to be sixteen year old girls," Jared said almost laughing.<br />
<br />
"Are you serious!?" you asked your jaw dropping almost to the floor. Jared was one of those guys that would never have a female avatar for fear of someone thinking that he might be transgendered, or not normal in his words. He avoids anything that might give that impression even going so far as to clarify something as simple as an answer to one of his girlfriends asking if he liked the outfit she was wearing. So for him to suggest that almost melted your brain.<br />
<br />
"Of course I'm serious," he said shaking his head.<br />
<br />
"Ok who are you and what have you done to Jared?" you asked not believing this could be Jared.<br />
<br />
Jared laughed and said, "Nothing has happened to me. I just thought it would be a great joke. No one will expect me to have a female avatar and will go crazy trying to find me. And I thought that since we were friends that you might want to join me in this."<br />
<br />
"So you really want to have a female avatar this time?" you asked being s bit skeptical.<br />
<br />
"Sure," he said nodding. "I can always set up a new one once I'm bored with this. Now I've thought about the names that we should use. I'll be Jennifer and you'll be Rose and we'll each be sixteen. Other than that you're free to create your avatar how you want."<br />
<br />
"Alright," you said shrugging and started to create your avatar. You still couldn't believe that Jared was going to create a female avatar. Of course the thought occurred to you that he was just saying that to pull a prank on you. The more you thought about it the more that made sense. Oh well you'll deal with it later if that's the case.<br />
<br />
"Are you ready to create them?" Jared asked looking up from his phone.<br />
<br />
"Almost," you said holding up a finger and finishing your avatar. You had set your avatar's height at 62 inches and weight at 120 pounds. You set the race as Caucasian because frankly you can't see the name Rose fitting any other race, not that it couldn't of course, and because you're Caucasian yourself. You had given her bra strap length (see  for hair lengths) light ash brown hair and gray eyes. For her breasts you had made them what you thought was a b or maybe a c cup. You had given her a nice floral sundress, white wedge sandals, and pink heart shaped earrings for her pierced ears. "Ok I'm ready now," you said smiling.<br />
<br />
"On three then we'll both hit create," he said smiling. "One... Two... Three."<br />
<br />
On three you hit the create button and felt a warm tingling spread all through your body. The first thing that you noticed was the slight gut that you had developed was shrinking. Then you felt an itching sensation on your cheeks and raising a hand you noticed that the stubble you had was withdrawing back into your skin. You quickly got up and went to your bedroom where you had a full length mirror. As you peered into the mirror you saw that you looked like you had when you were sixteen. You could hardly believe your eyes but then the next stage of the transformation began. Your clothes kind of became translucent so you could see flesh starting to pile up behind your nipples forming breasts. While you were staring at your growing breasts you failed to notice your hair getting longer and lightening a bit. Once your breasts were finished growing you noticed that your face was rearranging a little becoming softer and a little rounder. You watched your eyes go from blue-green to gray. You watched as you grew shorter and your arms slimmed a bit. With you looking so much like a girl you focused your attention on your dick which was growing smaller now as your balls pulled up into your body. As you watched your dick finished shrinking down until it was barely visible and then moved down so it was between your legs. You could just see a slight swelling between your legs which you took to be your new pussy. With the changes to your body done your clothes were next. Your shirt and pants merged together and your pant legs billowed out before they shortened to just above your knees while the sleeves on your shirt shortened as well until it was sleeveless. The extra material seemed to make it's way to your chest and form a bra while your briefs smoothed out and became smaller forming a pair of panties. Your socks seemed to melt into your shoes as the top mostly opened up keeping a toe strap and ankle strap with the extra material seeming to go into the wedge. The last thing to happen was two pink heart shaped earring appeared in your pierced ears. With all the transformations complete your clothes became opaque once more.<br />
<br />
You stared at yourself in the mirror for a moment wondering at the marvel of the transformation. You turned around to get a look at yourself from different angles and as you did you discovered that you were more comfortable in this body than you had been in your own. You were so much more comfortable that you didn't want to change back. Of course that was just you and wouldn't be Jared. On that thought you went to see if he really had made a sixteen year old girl avatar or if he was pulling a prank on you.</p>
