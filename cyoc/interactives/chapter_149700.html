<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Two weeks had passed and a new routine had started to settle in our house.<br />
Every morning Aaron would wake me, and proceed to suck a load out of my balls, and then he would continue to edge himself in my room as I completed my homework.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, his presence helped me focus. <br />
Or maybe it was the clear head after busting my nut first thing in the morning.<br />
When I  completed my homework, I would allow Aaron to blow his load all over himself, sometimes with my second load added to the mix.<br />
 <br />
Aaron would then clean himself up, consuming whatever cum was plastered on his body, before leaving to shower.<br />
<br />
Watching this made it very hard to restrain myself. Watching my brother work himself into a cock drunk horny mess, eating both our cum without any prompting or hesitation, but I needed to continue the twisted delusion that his edging was helping me become a better person...<br />
<br />
...for now at least.<br />
<br />
At this point I would head downstairs and make breakfast.<br />
For the entire family.<br />
<br />
Mother and father both were shocked the first few days, but had started into the new routine. Clearly enjoying the fresh coffee, and the variety of yummy foods I was making. <br />
I always enjoyed cooking breakfast foods, and watching them scarf down the waffles, pancakes, omelets or the bacon and eggs I was cooking felt good in a weird way.<br />
<br />
Also, I was hungrier now I was quitting smoking.<br />
It had taken my mother a week of delicious breakfasts to cave in and get me the prescription to quit smoking, and combined with the self hypnosis tapes, I was sure I would never pick up another cigarette again.<br />
<br />
My parents had each approached me for one of my old tape recorders, and had started their own self improvement tapes, not realizing the idea came from me, and that the entire process was really heading towards my own goals.<br />
<br />
Looking back those two weeks, the trade off of quitting smoking had seemed larger at the time, but looking at how Aaron, my Mother and my Father had responded so well over the last few weeks, I almost couldn&#39;t believe I hadn&#39;t acted sooner.<br />
<br />
Over the course of the two weeks, Sharon&#39;s mood had changed. My mother had gone from constantly frowning and complaining, into a happier version of herself. She was smiling, humming to herself, and throwing herself into her work.<br />
<br />
I had even found her reading fashion magazines, practicing new stitching patterns and even drawing out designs for her own clothing ideas. She had also become less interested in Sean&#39;s actions, not noticing or caring that he had spent the last 3 nights sleeping in the spare room, but also not noticing he was not drinking as much, and was coming home earlier.<br />
It probably helped that she was able to sleep without my drunken father trying to throw himself on her in the middle of the night.<br />
<br />
My father had changed as well, although much slower and subtler then the others.<br />
I had seen Sean on the couch in the evenings, nursing a beer far slower then he normally would, squirming slightly every now and then, and scratching himself. <br />
My theory was the programming had started to settle in, however it had been significantly slower, likely due to the Sean&#39;s drunken mind struggling to process the instructions. Yet as Sean drank less, his mind would be more malleable to the instructions.<br />
<br />
I had even modified my own tapes, making it easier to go to bed earlier at night to ensure I could get up early enough to induce everyone, reinforcing their instructions. I would have to hide myself from Aaron as he left for the gym in the morning, and then return to my bed and pretend to be asleep so he could &#39;wake me&#39; to study.<br />
<br />
Even the school was laying off my back a little, as I had been completing homework and putting in what I felt was a token effort in class. Clearly enough of an effort that most of my teachers were no longer picking on me, and my grades were trending upwards slowly towards a passing level.<br />
<br />
Even Aaron had started to change his thinking, revealing to &#39;god&#39; in our nightly sessions that his thoughts and dreams were no longer on girls, but on reliving the events occurring every morning, masturbating himself into a frenzy in front of me and consuming our spent seed.<br />
<br />
Every morning Aaron was waking with leaking a hard on, forcing him to take a quick cold shower before the gym, and he was finding himself getting hard remembering the taste of cum. I made no attempt to force his new hunger, instead reminding him that he should not be ejaculating for his own pleasure, but instead trying to absorb all of his brothers perverse desires.<br />
That such self serving thoughts were a sign of him falling.<br />
<br />
This had meant the last few days that Aaron had protested more as he edged himself in my room, his cheeks flushed red with humiliation and shame as he fought his bodies own lustful desire to cum even harder. Initially two weeks without cumming had been torture for Aaron. Now cumming daily was a spiritual torment for him, and watching his shame and humiliation as he debased himself for me got me so rock hard.<br />
<br />
But after two weeks it was time to take another step forward.<br />
<br />
<br />
That night I introduced a few new subtle commands into my families minds. They could see the improvement in me and so were going to start thinking more highly of me and be more open to my requests and suggestions.<br />
<br />
Additionally, every time they accepted a command or suggestion from me, they would feel a little bit happier. My hope, was that this positive feedback loop would make them more malleable to me without having to induce them at night.<br />
<br />
Aaron was already obeying my commands when alone, but for a different reason. He believed god was telling him to do this to &#39;save me&#39;. This wasn&#39;t enough for me. I wanted more complete control to humiliate my brother. My parents still treated him as if he could do no wrong, and a couple of weeks of smiles and small compliments was not going to undo the years of resentment I had built up.<br />
<br />
<br />
The next morning after completing a history project and dumping a load down my brothers throat; I went down stairs in just a jock strap to make breakfast. Although by the time everyone came down for breakfast, I had donned a small white apron in front, as the sizzling bacon grease caused small drops of hot oil to leap onto my exposed flesh, causing me to jolt with the surprised stinging.<br />
<br />
I noticed the surprised looks on every ones faces as they sat down, my bare ass exposed to them as I served them breakfast, but I ignored it, acting as if it was the most normal thing in the world.<br />
<br />
I could see my dad itching under his shirt as he shuffled in his seat, but was surprised by my brother being the one to question me.<br />
<br />
“Um Bro. Why are you only wearing a jock this morning?” Aaron asked timidly, casting his eyes down as I turned, locking our gazes.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s normal for guys to be comfortable in their own home. I&#39;m still wearing underwear, and I&#39;ll put clothes on before I go out. What&#39;s the big deal?” I casually asked, not pausing as I served everyone their scrambled eggs.<br />
<br />
“Damn it. Chris is right. Life&#39;s too hard not to be comfortable in your own home.” My father replied, lifting his shift over his head and placing in on the table next to his breakfast.<br />
“Ah. Much better.” He sighed, his hands gently rubbing over his beefy chest, through the dusting of short, dark hairs covering his torso before flashing a toothy smile my way and digging into his food.<br />
<br />
Aaron briefly looked over at Sharon, receiving a small shrug from her as she started eating, a small smile lifting the edges of her mouth. Aaron sighed before digging into his breakfast, still casting the occasional side eye my way.<br />
<br />
“Hey big bro?” I asked just as everyone was finishing their meal. “You don&#39;t have anything to be ashamed of, so why don&#39;t you try getting a little more comfortable after school today?” <br />
Aaron froze for a moment, staring wide eyed at me as he fought internally over his answer.<br />
<br />
“Come on Son. It&#39;s not a big deal. In fact, I was gonna ask you to help give me some workout advice, since I&#39;m going to rejoin the gym.” Dad interjected, causing Aaron to stare at him for a long moment, before sighing and nodding.<br />
<br />
As everyone stood from the table, Aaron hesitantly removed his shirt. <br />
“That&#39;s my boy. Look at those muscles, just like I used to have. You should be proud to show that off around the house.” Dad said as he patted Aaron on the back.<br />
<br />
“Um, thanks Dad. I&#39;ll uh. I&#39;ll get started cleaning up the breakfast dishes.” Aaron stammered, as the family dispersed. Dad staying in the kitchen to chat with Aaron about his exercise plans.<br />
<br />
I was almost ready to head out the door from school, as Aaron and dad left the kitchen, still shirtless and chatting away. My dad still occasionally scratching his thighs uncomfortably.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, these damn clothes have been feeling really tight and uncomfortable lately. That&#39;s why I thought I would start working out again. I must have gained a bit of weight or something. So before dinner tonight we&#39;ll both go to the gym together?”<br />
<br />
“Um, yeah Dad, just promise me we don&#39;t have to go topless there.” Aaron replied shyly, drawing a huge resonating laugh from our father.<br />
<br />
“I can make that promise. Don&#39;t want to be showing this beer gut off outside the house to anyone...”<br />
Dad replied, patting his belly.<br />
“...But afterwards, I&#39;m gonna get comfortable. Chris might just have the right idea with the heat this time of year. Walking around in our under wear. Your gonna &#39;join in&#39; right?” <br />
Dad taunted with small air quotes as Aaron struggled with his response.<br />
<br />
“Um, well, I-I guess if its just at home, and-and Mom doesn&#39;t mind... Then I&#39;ll do it too.”<br />
Aaron replied, looking downward, unprepared for the sudden contact with Dad&#39;s bare flesh as he wrapped him in a manly bear hug.<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s the spirit, my boy! Part of the pack. Now don&#39;t it feel good to join in on our family activities?” Dad said smiling widely.<br />
<br />
I watched Aaron struggle with his own emotions a bit before lifting his head and smiling back at dad. <br />
“Yeah. It does feel kinda good Dad.”<br />
<br />
“Come on bro. We&#39;re gonna be late to school.” I called Aaron over. I laughed as he barely remembered to put a shirt on before heading out the door, my smile never fading as I waved goodbye to dad.<br />
<br />
It appeared everything was going according to plan.</p>
