<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff opened the door and saw Todd, Mike and Dave having a three way. <br />
<br />
The fat ram was absolutely wrecking Finn’s stepdad’s ass. Mike, Jeff’s father was slamming his hips into Todd’s mouth. Todd himself, a rather tubby panda, was looking lost. The look in his eyes was one Jeff recognized. Blissed out and fuck-dazed. Jeff chuckled to himself and shook his head. He couldn’t believe all the shifts would make his most hated day-Football Night-into his favorite.<br />
<br />
He walked up the stairs, down the hall and into his room.<br />
<br />
It was just as he left it, though the roller chair that had been under his desk was in the center of his room for some reason. His dad or maybe Todd had been up here, then. The [Process Complete. What would you like to change?] notification was flashing on the screen. Jeff pulled the chair back to the desk and sat down, minding his tail.<br />
<br />
Downstairs, he heard Finn, Chuck and Greg come in. Jeff smirked, knowing exactly what Chuck and Greg would be seeing. He kinda wanted to see the looks on their faces but at the same time, it would be best to discuss it up here. <br />
<br />
Chuck came in first, a pudgy black kid he used to play DND with. Greg followed, a big and tall kinda guy, white with glasses. More of a fellow gamer than a friend-not that he was offensive or anything. He just wasn’t the kind of guy who had time for best friends. They were both looking weirded out, and Jeff could tell he’d need to explain a few things very quickly or they’d bolt.<br />
<br />
Finn, the hugely muscled ram, followed in after them, a grin on his face, and closed the door behind him. <br />
<br />
The room was silent for a moment as Greg and Chuck collected themselves.<br />
<br />
“Dude, what the fuck was that?” Greg asked. “Your dads are fucking!”<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Jeff nodded. “They are now. Thanks to the Chronivac.”<br />
<br />
“Why would you want to make your dads fuck?” Chuck asked, disgusted. “That’s fucked up in so many ways…”<br />
<br />
“The point is…” Finn inserted himself into the conversation. “…We can do anything we want. And we want you two on the football team.”<br />
<br />
The room fell silent again.<br />
<br />
“You guys get to choose what you become.” Jeff said. “I know you’re both broke and your parents can’t pay for college. You want to get a degree, you’d need a scholarship, and neither of you are actually smart enough to get one. If we win nationals, you guys get a full ride.”<br />
<br />
“Pitbull.” Chuck said instantly.<br />
<br />
“For real, bro?” Greg asked.<br />
<br />
Jeff smirked, realizing what he was going to do with Greg if things continued the way they were.<br />
<br />
“Got any animal in mind, Greg?” Finn asked.<br />
<br />
“No! Guys, this is fucked up. Come on, bro, let’s get out of here.” Greg took Chuck’s hand and made for the door.<br />
<br />
“Stop, man!” Chuck pulled his hand out of Greg’s grip and turned to Troy. “Pitbull. Linebacker.”<br />
<br />
“What are you-” Greg protested.<br />
<br />
“I’m getting on board.” Chuck said. “Jeff is right. We’re in the muddy middle. Too poor to afford college but too well-off to qualify for a scholarship. Plus, I wanna be a star. I’m tired of being a nerdy loser no one talks to.”<br />
<br />
Finn smiled and shot Jeff a look. Jeff nodded and began tapping away at the computer. The program had some relatively complicated menus, so it would take him a few minutes to navigate it and set everything right. They could argue all they wanted, neither of them were leaving human.<br />
<br />
“How do you know reality will alter the way you want it too? We’re not talking about changing our hairstyles or growing bigger dicks.” Greg argued.<br />
<br />
The debate raged on for another three minutes. Jeff altered reality in the meanwhile so he had a coffee and pain relievers on his desk. He took a sip and downed the aspirin. God, Greg could be so annoying when he thought he was in the right.<br />
<br />
“So you have no preferences? Bear, badger, hippo, elephant, reindeer….” Finn prodded Greg.<br />
<br />
“No! For the last time, I’m not interested in becoming an anthro.” Greg said, exasperated.<br />
<br />
Jeff finished the sequence and looked it over one more time before pressing enter.  An error code popped up. [Change not able to complete while temporary shift in place. Make shift permanent or wait to finish. Time left: 22 hours, 35 minutes.]<br />
<br />
The white tiger frowned. <br />
<br />
He pulled up active shifts and saw that Todd had done something. What the hell was Finn’s stepdad doing? Giving himself a bigger dick, maybe? He tried to check, but the boxes were grayed out. Whatever he’d changed, he didn’t seem too upset when he was downstairs. With a shrug, Jeff shifted the time limit from temporary to permanent. [Mental Adjustments: Yes/No?]. He didn’t want to have Todd come up all angry so he clicked yes and hit enter. {Processing Time: Three minutes remaining]<br />
<br />
Jeff scoffed. This thing could do awesome stuff, but it sure took awhile. He took a sip of his coffee and smiled. Sumatran blend was amazing.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Downstairs, Todd was still getting porked by Jeff’s dad and his new husband.<br />
<br />
The sensations had him moaning, both holes filled with thick, throbbing meat, but he had to concentrate. He needed to contact Jeff somehow, but Mike, Jeff’s overly muscular white tiger father, currently had his paws on Todd’s head. The panda bear’s nose twitched and sniffed the older tiger’s musky pubic fur.<br />
<br />
Dave’s belly rested on Todd’s wider ass as though it were a shelf, the heavy weight strangely turning Todd on. The panda could barely breath, each forceful thrust of the older ram’s hips pushing his beer-can thick dick further and further into Todd’s rear. It all felt so good, but he needed to think of a way to talk to Jeff before he messed with the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
Todd’s eyes fell on his pants, which lay discarded on the carpet near the sofa. His phone! He still had Jeff’s contact information, if he could just reach it in time, he might be able to tell him to stop or cancel the transformation. The ramifications (no pun intended) of turning back into a teen when he knew Mike was likely to kick him out were no longer a big deal. He’d figure a way back into Mike’s good graces later.<br />
<br />
He reached down and caught his jeans with his hand. Todd couldn’t see what part of it he was holding, maybe the belt. The only thing he could see was the slightly yellowed white groin fur in front of him. He patted the jeans, searching for the hardness of his phone. <br />
<br />
There! <br />
<br />
He felt around for his pocket and slipped his hand in, grabbing the phone and pulling it out. As he did, a strange surge of energy jolted through him and fizzled in his brain. He blinked, wondering if he’d gotten static shock.<br />
<br />
The tiger in front of him kept forcing his cock further back into Todd’s throat. For some reason, he wasn&#39;t even giving the guy a proper blowjob! Todd briefly wondered how he knew what a proper blowjob was, but shook it off. He let his throat muscles relax, letting the shaft ease in, then swallowed. The tiger above moaned and pre shot down his throat. The panda used his tongue and lapped a figure 8 under the head of the big cat’s cock. Todd managed to unlock his phone with one hand. With the other, he fondled the kitty’s big, furry nut-sack, rolling the orbs within.<br />
<br />
“There we go, that’s the head game I remember!” Mike panted.<br />
<br />
Todd idly wondered what the tiger was talking about. This was how he’d done it for years now, without any complaint. He felt the ram plowing his loose hole. Why the hell was he letting these guys down, fucking like a cold fish? With a grunt, he clamped down on the intruder and tightened his anal ring, bucking back into fuck while he pulled the phone into view. This whole texting thing had him distracted from a great fuck session. He needed to finish it fast.<br />
<br />
>This is Todd, don’t mess with the temporary change.<br />
<br />
The panda paused, fingering hovering over the send button. What change had he entered into the Chronivac again? He stared at the text, dumbfounded. Todd had gone up there after Finn left and...done something. He&#39;d been desperate a few seconds ago. Mike and Dave were pounding him. God, he loved them both!<br />
<br />
Memories of marrying his fellow football player and high school crush, Dave, filled his mind. They&#39;d started dating just after Dave&#39;s wife had died and the ram had come out of the closet, much to Todd&#39;s delight. He&#39;d managed to grow close to Finn-closer than he ever thought possible-and now he was coaching his football team. As the years of working and living with his new husband piled into his mind, Todd relaxed the muscles around his belly. At first he’d been embarrassed of his little gut, but Mike and Dave had been so enthusiastic, he’d decided to just let himself go. Pandas looked good with a Buddha belly, which was his new goal. A wave of relief flooded through him as he stopped sucking in his gut, letting it wobble freely beneath him, jiggling with each buck he made.<br />
<br />
As if to reward him, the ram reached a hefty arm around the Panda’s love-handles and gripped his pre-slicked shaft, pumping his fist up and down. They fucked in tandem with eachother. Todd could have cum immediately, but he held back. He felt pressure growing inside of him and it was an effort to shove his oncoming orgasm back down.<br />
<br />
“Fuck! Todd…finger my hole.” Mike panted.<br />
<br />
Todd dropped the phone without hesitation. The text could wait. The horny kitty in his mouth needed to get off now. With his hand now free, he brought it behind the cat and deftly inserted a thick finger in the tiger’s hole. Mike moaned, cock burping precum down Todd’s muzzle. The panda expertly rubbed the tiger’s prostate. He felt the ring tense around his knuckle.<br />
<br />
The hand on the back of Todd’s head pressed him firmly into the base of Mike’s shaft. The panda could feel the tiger’s balls tense and draw up second’s before the cock in his mouth twitched bucked, sending loads of hot virile tiger semen down Todd’s throat to pool in his beergut.<br />
<br />
Todd felt the ram buck hard into him and he squeezed down. With a cry of pure pleasure, the ram’s cum flooded the panda’s guts. The ram kept bucking his hips, pumping semen further and further into Todd’s sloppy hole.<br />
<br />
Feeling his ram cum inside him, own his hole, was enough to push Todd over the edge. With a cock-muffled moan, he shot his wad on the couch. It felt like the best fuck of his life.<br />
<br />
The three men panted and basked in the afterglow. Eventually, his ram pulled his sweaty gut off Todd and rolled back onto the couch. Todd dutifully licked Mike’s cock clean as he pulled it free of Todd’s maw. Eventually, they all ended up panting and sweating, watching the game. Mike got up and went to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
There was a beep from upstairs. Probably something to do with the Chronivac his stepson was playing with. That reminded him! He bent over the couch and spotted his cell under the coffee table. <br />
<br />
The 42 year old panda-a year older than Dave, actually-picked up his phone and wondered why he’d texted gibberish to Jeff. With a shrug, he erased it. Let the kids have their fun. <br />
<br />
Mike came back from the kitchen and set down a bowl filled with something that had the panda’s nose twitching. <br />
<br />
“Got a present for you, Todd. Deep-fried bamboo shoots!” Mike grinned.<br />
<br />
Todd patted his beergut. “You really shouldn’t have. Gotta watch my figure.”<br />
<br />
“Watch it grow.” Mike muttered under his breath, then smiled as the panda dug in.<br />
<br />
The three men settled back into beer swilling and eating while the game entered the final quarter. Cum leaked from Todd’s hole and onto the couch, but no one cared. They could always just use the Chronivac to clean it all up later.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
There was a beep as whatever changes Todd had done fully solidified into reality.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled and looked at the blinking message at the bottom of his screen. [Processing Complete. Ready for next input] appeared on the screen. He leaned back in his chair and cracked his knuckles. Now for Greg and Chuck.</p>
