<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">By the time Alex had reached the base of the stairs her face was almost as red as her hair, sweat dripped from her brow as she wiped it away with her free hand, her other hand was currently the only thing keeping her somewhat balanced, cradling her translucent glowing womb, letting out another groan as Lilly once again tested how far she could stretch out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Lilly, cut me a bit of a nnnngggh, brake here&quot; groaned Alex as she rested up against the wall, looking up at the stairs as they spiraled up and up, from what she could gather from looking up at the balcony, the chamber that Ryka and Chronos were in was on the third level, Alex let out a small whimper at the thought of climbing so many stares like this, getting another nudge from Lilly.<br />
<br />
As Alex turned her attention to bonding with her new womb occupant she became blissfully unaware of the figure walking up beside her, suddenly Alex&#39;s sweating seemed to become allot worse, her entire body now glistening as she fanned her face in a desperate attempt to cool off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dorry about that mam, most people aren&#39;t as used to the heat as me&quot; came a rough voice, Alex let out a yelp of surprise before slipping and falling backwards, only to be caught by someone&#39;s arm, then another, and another, and another which even by how odd things had been for Alex lately was a bit bizarre.<br />
<br />
When she looked up at the saviour of her dignity, she was greeted by a giant of a man, standing at an impressive 9 feet tall easily, his skin was pail, with scars over his chest and neck, with another large scar over his sholder, he was a rather skinny build, not muscular like Chronos, not by a long shot, but that didn&#39;t make him any less intimidating, his eyes glowed red, like two sun&#39;s in his eye sockets, and his hair was golden blond, cut short and scruffy, he wore a black leather trench coat, with a white button up shirt beneath, and trousers fit for a 3 piece suit, quite the odd combination, yet his coat had no sleeves, and for good reason.<br />
<br />
From his torso sprouted four arms on each side, each with nimble, spaced fingers, yet each finger and palm looked rough as a grind stone, except for one, the arm over his large scar seemed to be made completely of bronze, with gears and pistons to make it work, and glowing runes along its bicep.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you OK mam&quot; asked the giant man, and Alex was brought back from her thoughts, clearing her throat and making herself stand &quot;yes I am, thanks to you, with this little one now I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to stand on my own if I fell&quot; chuckled Alex as she padded her translucent middle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see, well I&#39;m glad I was of good service to the future second queen&quot; he said, bowing low, folding four of his arms to his chest, before his head snapped up to look at Alex&#39;s belly, he then gave an annoyed sigh &quot;young lady, what were you told about using the moon strings&quot; he said to her pregnant belly, Alex then looked down to see Lilly stur from her sleep and lazily rolled over to look at the firey giant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry mystro, but she came back see!, I told you she would come back&quot; cheered Lillys voice, her movements becoming fluttery and light, Alex smiled and traced her fingers along the outlines of Lillys feet, getting a giggle in response, when her movements and giggles became drowsy and slow &quot;that....tickles......mommy&quot; muttered Lilly before once again falling asleep, cirling up against Alex womb wall.<br />
<br />
Alex then looked up at the giant &quot;so ummmm Mystro was it?, you two know eachother?&quot; Asked Alex as she gestured to the sleeping child within her, Mystro gave a booming chuckle &quot;well in a way yes, quite the troublemaker you have there, but also quite the musical genius too, well besides myself&quot; said Mystro proudly before a look of shock covered his face &quot;oh my, where are my manners, I haven&#39;t even introduced myself, the names Mystro, god if music and guardian of the moonstrings&quot; he said before saluting with his mechanical arm &quot;at your service&quot; he said before they both burst into laughter at his performance.<br />
<br />
When Alex suddenly had an idea &quot;Hey Mystro, since you&#39;ve made the offer, there is one thing you could do for me, it would realy help me out&quot; Pleaded Alex, looking up at Mystro, who smiled widely, clearly glad to be of service &quot;whatever the task my lady, I shall do all I&#39;m my power to see it through&quot; he declared <br />
____________________________________________<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I said I&#39;d see through any task, and those words still stand, but I wasn&#39;t expecting this&quot; said Mystro as he reached the second floor halway, and began to climb the stairs to the third level &quot;I know but thank you Mystro, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have made it half way up the first flight with Mrs wreckingball here&quot; chuckled Alex as she petted her belly with one hand,  and holding onto one Mystros arms with the other, Alex&#39;s only request at that time, was to be carried up the stairs to her room.<br />
<br />
It was then that Alex&#39;s attention was drawn to the stairs carvings along its walls, various images of different styles and times decorated the walls, telling stories of great battles, tragic loss, new life and lost lands &quot;what is all this&quot; whispered Alex as she brushed her hand against the stone wall as they climbed, Mystro then looked down at his passenger, marveling at their history before coming to a stop at a certain carving set.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah here&#39;s my one&quot; he said with a pained tone, as he raised Alex up on his palms to become eye level with him, Alex was lost for words as the images told their story, of how a god with a giant hammer and chisel carved a giant with eight arms from the sun, forging him like a blacksmith crafting a sword, until the young Mystro arrived on earth and met a mortal called melody, a woman of greate musical talent far beyond her time, but on the day they were to be wed, a jealous mortal attempted to strike down Mystro, and melody, not knowing of his godly nature, fell cold upon the floor.<br />
<br />
When Alex reached the end of the carvings story, her eyes were wet with tears &quot;so that&#39;s why a song is called a melody, so they would remember her&quot; whispered Alex as they continued walking, Mystro now placing Alex on his sholder, his expression distant and blank &quot;I made sure two things happened that day, one, that my loves name would forever be at the heart of music, and second, is that jealousy is a tune no being should dance to&quot; he said, reaching around to scoop up Alex and place her in the hallway of the third floor &quot;well then mam, and littler mam, I believe this is your stop&quot; he said with a smile, using one hand to pet her head with his fingertip, and the other to do the same gently to her belly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Mystro, before you go, may I ask one more question of you&quot; Asked Alex, looking to the giant who only gave a nod as a reply &quot;what are the moon strings?&quot; She asked curiously, Mystro only gave a small chuckle before striding over to the window facing the stairs and drew its curtains open, revealing the moon in all its glory amoung the stars, its beams of light danced accros the sky, but Alex still didn&#39;t understand, waddling over to the window &quot;the moon strings are the light from the moon, the world&#39;s first harp, only ever played by our beloved Queen aurora, and apparently the moon princess as well&quot; said Mystro as he thundered down the hallway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Mystro, I could use a hand in the forge, came a booming voice, before Mystro turned on a dime and angrily marched down the stairs &quot;how many times do I have to tell you, I&#39;m a musician, not your forge stoker!!&quot; Cried Mystro as his voice grew further and further away.<br />
<br />
Alex was left in thought, her hands tracing over Lillys hands as they seemed to pluck at something that wasn&#39;t there, before a chime echoed out across the sky, Alex had questions, more than ever now, but as far as she could tell for the time being her life here looked bright, verry bright indeed, she sighed, before more notes chimed out through the stars.......</p>
