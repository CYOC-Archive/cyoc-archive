<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">This time it was Alicia’s turn to wake first. Firstly she looked at her arms. Alas she still had Henry’s fat, hairy arms. She then felt her hair. It was still long and clearly attached to her scalp. The hair swap would not come into effect until tomorrow morning. Missing taking the satchel before midnight had delayed their return to normalcy for an additional 24 hours.<br />
<br />
Alicia looked at Henry lying still asleep on the bed. Henry had long blonde hair as well but she guessed he had forgotten to remove the wig when he went to bed. Henry also still had a copy of Alicia’s torso and face. He had feminine arms, shoulders and breasts. Alicia guessed Henry also still had a thin waist. He would be disappointed when he woke. The face and waist should have reverted this morning. His four days as ‘Rachel’ should be over. It seemed missing yesterdays satchel meant he would retain those arms, face and waist until the doll was fully consumed. She suspected Henry would be disappointed.<br />
<br />
Alicia decided to leave Henry sleeping and learn his fate when he woke. Meanwhile she went to the bathroom, found a razor and began to shave her arms. She was going to feminise them as much as she could.<br />
………<br />
Henry quickly observed that his body was unchanged from yesterday as soon as he woke. He took that as fate. Sure it delayed his return to being his normal self by a day but it wasn’t all bad. He had actually enjoyed yesterday. It had been fun. He checked to see if his genitals were intact. They were. His mind quickly figured out he would need to remain as ‘Rachel’ for the remainder of the holiday. He left the bed to find Alicia, aware that she had been pretty distressed last night.<br />
<br />
Henry didn’t say anything when he found Alicia shaving her arms. He knew that meant he would inherit hairless arms when he finally reverted. His initial instinct had been to chastise her but he held his tongue. For all he knew she was still very upset.<br />
<br />
Alicia was surprised that Henry stayed silent when she was caught shaving the arms she now possessed. Perhaps he had come to realise how much nicer it was to have smooth skin? She commented ‘Looks like you are stuck as Rachel for the duration’<br />
<br />
‘It seems so’ the deep voice coming out of Henry’s throat seemed incongruous with his feminine appearance. ‘My own fault. I should have learnt from earlier’<br />
<br />
‘So what do you suggest we do? Isn’t today our check out day?’<br />
<br />
‘Yes. We either extend or go somewhere else’<br />
<br />
‘We should find somewhere else to stay. I don’t want to run into Alex or anyone else I know, when I have these arms’<br />
<br />
‘I’m sure by the time you have finished shaving those arms will look quite womanly’<br />
<br />
“I’ll have tuckshop lady arms. I will have to confine myself to long sleeves’<br />
<br />
‘It could be worse. You could look like your wife’s little sister’ Henry made his face look as glum as it possibly could<br />
<br />
‘I suppose’<br />
<br />
‘I suggest we stay here. We are still the same as yesterday and if we do the hair swap tomorrow we know that could be easily disguised. If we run into Alex we just say that your husband&#39;s return is delayed. We should not have any trouble extending our stay only that you will have to do it. Remember Rachel is mute’<br />
<br />
‘I’m worried about that other satchel, the white one. What do you think it will do?’ Alicia asked<br />
<br />
‘I don’t know. I don’t even know whether it is a part of the doll we will need to consume. I’m thinking we leave it till last. We should wake up with swapped hair tomorrow. The next morning will tell whether we need to consume that last satchel. If we have not reverted we take it then’<br />
<br />
‘But that would delay us yet another day. Didn’t you change our flights so that we leave tomorrow? I say we try to dissolve that last satchel tomorrow. If it dissolves we drink it’<br />
<br />
‘It could be poisonous for all we know’<br />
<br />
‘Well why don’t you ring the witch who made it and find out whether we need to drink it’<br />
<br />
‘She warned me not to ring her again. She was annoyed that I was bothering her’ Henry meekly replied<br />
<br />
‘Well give me her number and I will ring her’ Alicia was slightly pissed off at Henry. He was acting like a wimp, not the big alpha male she had married. She glanced disdainfully at her husband still clad in her blue chemise. Yes, Henry was acting like the blonde bimbo he currently was. There was not a lot of alpha left. <br />
<br />
‘She doesn’t have a phone. When I spoke to her it was with Gillian’s phone. She just told me to follow the instructions on the note’<br />
<br />
‘Well in that case get the note. There may be a clue we missed’<br />
<br />
Henry did and they both re-read it:<br />
<br />
“Sugar Doll”<br />
<br />
“Choose a part of the doll each evening. Dissolve it in a glass of water and share the drink. The crystals have an aura of magic which will make the two of you closer”<br />
<br />
“The magic from each sachet will last for 24 hours. Taste a new sachet before midnight or the effects of the previous one will linger until all the doll is consumed. The candy stick is a good one to start with as it will demonstrate how powerful this magic is”<br />
<br />
There was nothing on the reverse side. ‘Well it says we need to consume all the doll’ was Alicia’s comment ‘And the white sachet was certainly inside its head. So I say we risk it’<br />
<br />
Henry decided he needed to come clean ‘The witch said the whole process would take 14 days, more if we missed a day. I remember when I made my list I only counted 13. I thought that was funny at the time. I thought the arms or perhaps the ears were two separate sachets. I guess the white one is number 14’<br />
<br />
‘You’re telling me this now!’ Alicia was pissed ‘Clearly the white sachet is number 14 and we need to consume it! Either change our flights yet again or Rachel will be flying home with me’ She walked into the bathroom and closed the door. Shortly after he heard the shower running, clearly Henry was not welcome. <br />
<br />
Henry put the note back in the safe and had another look at the white sachet, wondering what changes it would cause.</p>
