<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sophie had enjoyed a reasonably good time in the set homes that had been set aside for married couples attending either SMU or SMU Dedman School of Law, in Sophie&#39;s case. She and Roland also got along quite well with Maya and her husband, Jackson who Maya referred to as &quot;Jackie.&quot; They&#39;d also learned that Maya had kept her maiden name, though not that Sophie or Roland minded. It was something that provided for a good sense of close friendship, and in part made up for the fact that she knew that she and her group of friends that had grown up together in Lyre/Animalia were ultimately moving in different geographic directions.<br />
<br />
It was also something that took some pressure off of Sophie that she felt as she was getting started through her law school courses. There were a lot of things that were a lot more complex than what she&#39;d dealt with before. It often had her studying a lot more than she did while going through SMU&#39;s main courses and which she&#39;d graduated from the past May. Talking with Maya and Jackie, in addition to Roland, had proved to be a good way for Sophie to relax and recharge after the day&#39;s lectures or assignments were tough, and Sophie did like that. It didn&#39;t entirely make up for being able to hang with Abbie, Jessica, Sarah, and Malice, but it did do a lot, as her childhood friends had their own lives to live.<br />
<br />
Though, that didn&#39;t mean she didn&#39;t stay in touch with her friends or with JC and Pauline, though communication with the latter often required some pre-planning through email to make up for the time zone difference between them. She was pleased to hear that Malice had gotten a job as one of the managers for Animalia Ambassadoria. She knew that Malice had liked the show as they went through high school and enjoyed the travel and segments that were often done, mostly to be friendly and that sort of thing. The job was more in planning and organizing than actually being on the show, which had created a surprise when Sophie checked an episode to find Malice hosting it again and largely hosting it alone. She was then further surprised that Malice had listed her and Roland as going to look over the new colony city in Argentina that was being built up and designed and that presently is what had her dialing Malice&#39;s number on a Saturday evening while Roland was busy with cooking dinner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Sophie, I was just getting ready to let you know that I think I got all the flights and things arranged,&quot; came Malice&#39;s voice as she answered the phone. Sophie noted that Malice sounded very optimistic and cheerful.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s kinda what I&#39;m calling about, Malice,&quot; Sophie answered slowly and softly, not wanting to sound angry with her friend, which she wasn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s great... and don&#39;t worry on the cost,&quot; Malice began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Malice... I know you&#39;re new to your job, but do you remember all that it entails?&quot; Sophie asked, cutting Malice off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, all the scheduling, arranging hotel reservations and other related provisions if needed,&quot; Malice answered, &quot;I&#39;d be hoping to get the new team up and running... but some things have been hectic and to a degree, I&#39;m actually learning a few new things with the job. And the report that they&#39;re mapping out a new Dinotopian Colony in Argentina was something that came in quick. Both from Horizon and some of the local farmers and ranchers in the area. One of the things that came across my desk was that if some of the people in the area became Dinotopians, they could better protect their livestock from Mountain Lions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And wouldn&#39;t you think that discussing things with WHO you want to send might work?&quot; Sophie asked as she sat down on the bed she and Roland shared.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it is a Dinotopian colony... and no one on the new team are Dinotopians,&quot; Malice commented, &quot;besides, you&#39;ve agreed to help with some elements... like with what we did when we were all in college.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Malice, we left Animalia Ambassadoria to attend college because their schedules would be different from WSA&#39;s and because the colleges may not give us the excused absences that we got while in high school,&quot; Sophie pointed out, &quot;about all we provided for Animalia Ambassadoria while we were all in college were surveys and things on how our classmates responded. And I can keep doing that sort of thing while at the law school... but between the course load, the difficulty of those courses, and the fact that Roland and I are also having to balance budgets with what we made while in high school on the show and with what we earned over the summer after our respective honeymoons. I really can&#39;t be flying to Argentina.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t?!&quot; Malice&#39;s voice almost whimpered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not without missing out on a lot of information that could hurt my grades and the ability to pass the bar in four years,&quot; Sophie answered, &quot;and while Roland doesn&#39;t have the same class load as I do this year... but what he has is INTENSIVE. Neither of us can really help with the sort of travel requirements. Maybe one of the new crew could do it. Just because it&#39;s a Dinotopian colony, that doesn&#39;t MEAN the person sent has to be a Dinotopian. Shoot... it may not have to be all Animalian. The show still has an even balance between Human and Animalian members, and they often pair off depending on the subjects they&#39;ve been covering.&quot;<br />
<br />
What Sophie heard next was an actual whimper. This was something that got her attention more clearly, some of it jogged some memories on how Malice felt at the revelations that she might be the only one of their group of friends to actually stay in Lyre/Animalia, with Sophie and Roland off to Texas, JC and Pauline to Africa, Jessica and Roger to Las Vegas, Sarah and Travis to Reno, and ultimately Abby and Samson to Montana. Sophie understood that, and a part of her wished that JC and Pauline could have stayed closer, but also knew those things to be unavoidable.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were hoping that you&#39;d be able to see me and Roland, weren&#39;t you?&quot; Sophie then asked as she tapped one finger on the side of her beak.<br />
<br />
After a moment, there was a weak answer, &quot;Yeah... I was. I thought I would fly down to Dallas to hand over the material and the tickets for the flight to Argentina and we could go someplace nice to eat at and catch up a bit. Particularly when Sarah and Travis have their work schedules... JC and Pauline are on another continent. I think the play Jessica is in should be doing performances by now... I&#39;ve been trying to get tickets, but that then conflicts with Simon&#39;s work schedule. So... I was just hoping to see a friendly face.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know how you feel,&quot; Sophie admitted, &quot;I miss JC terribly and while we&#39;ve been able to talk... the scheduling for it often gets complicated with all the time zones. But he says he&#39;s doing well. And I would like to see you and Simon... and I&#39;m sure so would Roland...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you&#39;re busy,&quot; Malice said weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Sophie answered, &quot;though when we get to the larger breaks for things like Thanksgiving and Christmas... those would be long enough where Roland and I could come up to Lyre/Animalia and see you. We probably will for things like that. Sort of a last &quot;college hurrah&quot; for us, given that by this time next year, Roland will be teaching at Dino City and all that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you will come to visit for those longer breaks this year?&quot; Malice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll try to... though you have to put up with me looking over course work and all that,&quot; Sophie replied back with a chuckle hoping to add some humor to things.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll hold you to it!&quot; Malice declared, &quot;though... now... I&#39;ll need to figure out new flight arrangements and who to send.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If the report is just an introduction, it shouldn&#39;t require too much specialty,&quot; Sophie answered, &quot;as I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have a whole new team to look after. And I&#39;m sure all the agreements that WSA and Animalia still have would allow for them to travel without as much issues with their grades.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... though with some of the Human members, and an increasing number of the Animalians, now,&quot; Malice commented, &quot;that may then require there being a chaperone. We got away with it because me, Sarah, Abby, Pauline, JC, Travis, Samson, and Simon were all double dosed. In that sense, we were you, Roland, Jessica, and Roger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll manage,&quot; Sophie commented, chuckling at the idea of Malice as the &quot;chaperone&quot; of their group, &quot;and if not... maybe ask around to see if any of the parents of the members might be able to arrange some time off to do it. Though, you&#39;d have to be sure to let them know how long they&#39;d be on the trip for and the schedule so they can handle all sorts of work-related issues.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Joy... that makes my job harder,&quot; Malice grumbled at that, &quot;but I suppose it works... and if not, I could chaperone again. I&#39;ve done well with Belle and Bash.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the spirit,&quot; Sophie found herself chuckling, and hoping it didn&#39;t sound like she was laughing at Malice.</p>
