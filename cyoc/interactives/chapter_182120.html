<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Excitement gathered in front of the church as Francis and her new husband stood outside the church getting their picture taken. Lara was content to just stand off to the side with her family but her parents had other ideas.<br />
<br />
“It’s tradition,” her mother beamed while shoving her up against a bunch of other ladies who were yet to receive a ring on their finger. A couple of Francis’ husband’s cousins, a few family friends, her twice divorced aunt Helen, it was all the women who like her had yet to be married off and actually believed that catching a bouquet meant you were next to be married. It didn’t matter that she’s seen her cousin Jackie earlier who’s wedding was planned for two months from that point, if she caught it she’d be next.<br />
<br />
“I kind of hate tradition,” Lara complained as she was slid into place. “Besides, I don’t even have a boyfriend, how am I expected to get married next.”<br />
<br />
“Just hush dear,” her mother urged before she was shoved between her aunt Helen and an eighteen year old girl with a dreamy look in her eyes as if her one and only high school fling would work out.<br />
<br />
Then Francis threw the bouquet, her aunt Helen bashed her aside like it was made of solid gold, it bounced from finger to finger, and slapped Lara right in the face. Leaves, flower petals, and thorns all sprayed into her face and made a few light scratches across her skin. Her aunt Helen then stole the bouquet from her fingers and some of her new cousins in law helped her up while asking if she was hurt. All she could do was sneeze due to the pollen, a new set of memories flowing into her brain.<br />
<br />
First there was the boy she’d been crushing on in sixth grade. He’d been a year ahead of her and they’d felt so far apart she’d never worked up the courage to ask him out. Then there was the weedy boy who’d stood her up at an eight grade dance. That was the first time she’d cried over a boy. She could recall her first boyfriend, if that word could even be used. It had been an in name only relationship with one of the guys on the volleyball team. They’d never even held hands and she’d just found out he was dating a different girl one day.<br />
<br />
She let out a big sneeze and felt water stream from her eyes as she recalled losing her virginity in grade eleven, it had been out at a party in the back of a car. At the time she’d felt so accomplished and womanly but looking back the guy had finished in five minutes and left her alone to get back to drinking. She’d just been another conquest to him, something to brag to his buddies about. The guy she’d gone to prom with in her graduating year was a different story. They’d dated all the way up to college and it had been really good. They’d gone on dates, she’d met his parents, and they’d had a lot of sex. She’d been on the cusp of adulthood and he’d been pretty good at it, working to please her and talking about their future together. Then he’d dumped her first week of college and hooked up with another woman two days later. Bigger boobs, slimmer waist, prettier hair, that was the person she’d been dumped over and since then it had just been small flings in college.<br />
<br />
She’d go to the occasional party, be hit on by a guy from the chemistry department and simply think, why not? They’d sleep together, sometimes multiple times, and then they’d move on.<br />
<br />
Lara spat out some leaves from the bouquet and shook her head at all her new memories. Why couldn’t she just find a guy she liked for more than his boner that was serious? If that happened maybe catching that bouquet would mean she’d get married next. She’d surely love to do it, but unlike her older sister she’d never exactly had a long lasting relationship.<br />
<br />
“Oh my gosh, are you okay Lara?” The woman in question demanded as she hurried over in his wedding dress with her heels clacking on the pavement.<br />
<br />
“I-I’m fine,” Lara replied while shaking her head, the new memories settling into her mind. Her last relationship had been with a guy from finance. He was on the basketball team, he’d had a hot body, and they’d had amazing sex every weekend. Unfortunately he wanted a plain Jane, stay at home wife because of his religious beliefs and had tried to coerce her into leaving school. She was kind of glad they weren’t together anymore, because she’d hate to be getting married to a guy like that who believed women belonged in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Guess who’s getting married,” aunt Helen grinned while waving her newly acquired bouquet in her boyfriend’s face.<br />
<br />
“You know, she may have it but you technically caught it,” Francis commented with a cheery grin.<br />
<br />
“Maybe that’ll help me find a new boyfriend,” Lara grinned back with an equally cheery grin, her eye squinting a little from the scratches the thorns had left. “Didn’t you meet Greg at one of Aunt Helen’s wedding?”<br />
<br />
“Yep, and I caught the bouquet, though it didn’t hit me in the face,” Francis mused.<br />
<br />
“Well, I’m outta luck, no guys going to go after allergy face,” Lara sniffled before letting out a noise that was halfway between a cough and a laugh.<br />
<br />
“You’ll clear up by the reception, I’m sure there’s at least one cut boy you’re not related to here,” Francis laughed before walking off and leaving Lara to sniffle from her allergies and clutch her forehead at all her new memories.</p>
