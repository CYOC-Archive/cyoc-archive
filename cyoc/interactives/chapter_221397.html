<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Having dealt with her first thief, of the store anyway, Selicia returned her focus to her original plans. Making those lovely “wishes” come true~ As per usual, a number of the wishes were quite boring… Power, money, beauty, etc… The one to pique her interest this time came from a rather well to do business woman. In fact, the woman hadn’t even left yet, so much was she stewing in her frustration.<br />
<br />
She had her brown hair pulled back into a messy bun, half rimmed glasses resting in front of sharp green eyes, and even her facial features were noticeably sharp. Moving on down her business attire really tamed her physical curves and sizes… Always a boring aspect, but one Selicia had to suffer… For now~ Overall she looked very physically average, if one didn’t take her face into account… She was speaking again, so Selicia made certain to return her attention to her words.<br />
<br />
“I can’t believe he would do this to me! After all that smooth talking and ‘wanting to step in’ after my ex-husband left… He goes and makes passes at my own daughter! This is just ludicrous! What’s worse is… She’s accepting his advances! They don’t even know that I know yet… I hired a private investigator on the suspicion of him…” She paused as if trying to gather herself. “Just to find out the woman he was seeing on the side was in my very household!”<br />
<br />
“Now now, Victoria… Let’s remember where we are…” Selicia warned Victoria gently, but firmly lest she lose control completely.<br />
<br />
Victoria seemed to take a moment to do a breathing exercise before continuing. “Just to think I raised Cassandra to be better than this… Yet, here I am, enlisting the aid of some supposed ‘magic woman’ to do something about this… You can help me? Can’t you…?”<br />
For the third time this meeting, Selicia nodded affirmatively with little vigor. “If it would help to appease you, I can expedite my services… For the right cost~”<br />
<br />
“Anything… You want it, it’s yours… Just help me deal with that little adulteress… Him… I’ll just throw him in the garbage like he did me…” Victoria grumbled the words darkly under her breath.<br />
Seemed like she might be the type to go too far for their own good if left to their own devices… With a fourth nod, Selicia stood from her seat and beckoned for Victoria to do the same. As she made her way out of the room, she paused next to Marina placing a hand on her shoulder. Having the smaller woman’s attention already, Selicia imbued a portion of magic into the young woman. “Marina… I have one last appointment for today, but<br />
I’m going to perform an expedited request. I’m placing you in charge of handling this final appointment, should it be a simple request. I’m placing my trust in you, can I do that?”<br />
<br />
As expected, Marina’s eyes lit up joyfully and spoke excitedly. “Of course, Mistress! I’ll do you proud! I promise!”<br />
<br />
“Excellent, Dear. I’m sure you will.” Patting Marina’s shoulder, she led Victoria to the door even as Marina was excitedly dancing in place behind them. “Now, Mrs. Victoria, if you would take me to your home~”<br />
<br />
At Victoria’s residence, Victoria pulled the car into the driveway of the home and almost breathed a sigh of relief. “He’s not home yet… So… My daughter should be home and alone. You’re certain you…” Victoria was hushed by Selicia’s finger pressed to her lips and a grin.<br />
<br />
“Of course, Dear~ Now take me to the problem daughter~” Selicia stepped out of the car and waited for Victoria to take the lead into the house. Once the door was opened Selicia could see the signs of a well-to-do lifestyle right away. It wasn’t extravagant nor was it a standard fair… Before she could take further stock of the surroundings, the problem woman made her appearance.<br />
<br />
Cassandra was almost a spitting image of her mother… If she were a punkish rebel… The younger woman’s body must’ve been a glimpse of what her mother hid having slender, but noticeable curves. Her bust and waist were roughly equal in size, shape, and firmness. Though, she seemed to have dyed her hair a deep red color with bangs hanging just over her hawkish green eyes.<br />
<br />
“Who’s the rich bag, huh?” Cassandra spoke from the top of the stairs leaning on the rail with arms crossed. “Bringing home, a new wife this time? Couldn’t just keep to your new husband?~” Cassandra taunted Victoria as she strut down the stairs. She continued her strut all the way up to Selicia, giving her what would pass as bedroom eyes… Seemed she would take whatever she could get her hands on… Before she stopped in front of Victoria, herself. “Well? Am I right?” She snickered with a flourish of her hair and a glance back to Selicia.<br />
<br />
Fuming, Victoria must’ve forgotten Selicia was there because her temper was let loose. “You little harlot! I know I didn’t raise you to be such a nasty bitch! I most certainly didn’t bring you up to be an adulteress, who steals away other’s lovers!” Victoria’s voice cracked in anger as she tore into the uncaring Cassandra.<br />
<br />
In response, Cassandra’s face broke into a wide toothy grin. “Oh… Oh~ You knew! Ahahaha” Cassandra’s laughter burst out of her as she held her sides. “Yeah! You’re Prince Charming was giving me those looks long before I made a move! You never even noticed!” Laughter paused Cassandra’s confession again. “Ever since I took him to my room the first time, we’ve banged every time you left for work. Where haven’t we done it too?! I wanna say, the hood of your car is the only place we haven’t~”<br />
<br />
Victoria was about to reach her hands out to her daughter before Selicia stayed them. Stepping forward, Selicia sashayed toward Cassandra making sure to catch her full attention. “You are such a bad girl aren’t you?” Selicia ran a finger under Cassandra’s chin with a purr. “Would you like to know what I do with bad girls?~” Cassandra’s eyes flitted between Selicia and the now shocked Victoria before the mischief overtook her own surprise.<br />
<br />
“Oh~ Why don’t you show me?~ Are you going to punish this bad, bad girl?~” Cassandra purred the line as much taunt as it was an attempt at seduction.<br />
<br />
“If you insist~ Why don’t you show me what you’ve got going on underneath those stuffy clothes?~” Selicia made the suggestion imparting a little magic to ensure Cassandra’s compliance.<br />
<br />
With a naughty little chuckle, Cassandra started by stripping off her shirt and locking eyes with Victoria as her nipples can into full view. Next was an unzip and drop of her pants, unveiling a bright red trimmed bush over tan lips. “I was going to do it with him, as soon as he got home, so… I wanted to be ready for him, but you’ll do~” Cassandra stepped forward leaving her discarded clothing behind. Another step and she couldn’t move any further… She seemed to struggle to take another as Selicia came face to face with her.<br />
<br />
“Now, time for that punishment, you were so desiring~” Selicia purred as she stroked Cassandra’s cheek forcing the spell into her. The magic slowly drew her arms into her torso and her torso down her thighs toward the floor. All the while, Cassandra’s eyes darted about her in a silent panic. Victoria’s rage was suppressed by awe with what she was seeing before her. Cassandra’s limbs were half absorbed into her body by the time Victoria managed to say anything.<br />
<br />
“Am… Am I hallucinating? Have I truly gone mad…?” She stepped forward slowly staring further down at her daughter’s changing body. She stopped beside Selicia, understandably gawking at the fantastical sight before her. Cassandra’s limbs had totally vanished within her torso as it balanced itself mysterious on her ass. “This isn’t real… Is it?” She looked toward Selicia, who only grinned in response before the next changes took place.<br />
<br />
Now Cassandra’s torso seemed to crumple in on itself as her shoulder sunk in to her breasts. “Oh no~ It’s quite real. You asked me to deal with her and I am~ She’ll never be able to do anything again… At least, not without your permission~” Selicia remarked as Cassandra’s stomach buckled leaving her breasts above her hips and wet vagina. Seems she really had been excited before or maybe even during this~ With a tilt of her head toward Cassandra, Selicia watched Victoria’s slow, astonished approach.<br />
A step further and Cassandra’s breasts were absorbed into her waist, leaving her neck attached just above her red bush. Another step closer, Cassandra’s ass was fully drawn into the back of her vagina. Only her head and her vagina were left of her as she looked up toward Selicia and Victoria with unbelieving eyes.<br />
<br />
“Anything left to say for yourself?” Selicia returned her ability to speak with the question rendered.<br />
<br />
Cassandra looked between the two women in shock before speaking. “What is happening to me?”<br />
<br />
“Punishment for a bad girl~” Selicia finished the transformation swiftly leaving a brief moment where Cassandra’s pleading eyes hovered just above that red bush before vanishing entirely. All that was left of the former woman was a slightly damp vagina with a bright red bush, a small piercing on the left lip. Victoria paused just in front of it and with a look toward a nodding Selicia, she picked it up.<br />
<br />
A trickle of fluid alighted Victoria’s palm as she held her former daughter in her hand. She stared in wonder at the disembodied organ in her hand. An intrusive thought later, she squeezed the vagina in her hand causing it to tremble and twitch excitedly. “Is… Is it really her?” She tore her eyes away from the vagina to look at the sneering Selicia.<br />
<br />
“It is everything that she was and now ever will be~” Selicia confirmed with an accomplished grin. “What you do with it now is up to you.”<br />
Gears were turning in Victoria’s mind as she turned her gaze back to the still slightly twitching part in her hand. A tight squeeze causing it to tremble fiercely in her grasp, even dribbling slightly. “I’ll give it to him… They wanted to be together so bad? Well fine… He can have her for all I care… I…”<br />
<br />
Cutting her off, Selicia made to steer her to another direction. “After all those times of them screwing around behind your back? You’re just going to give him his prize to leave with, hmm? If that’s what you want to do~” Selicia sighed with feigned disappointment.<br />
<br />
“What… What do you suggest I do…?” Victoria released her grip on the trembling vagina fiddling with the piercing on it’s left lip. “Not much else, I can think of to do with them… Are you saying I should keep her like this and send him away? Why would I wa-“ She was hushed again by Selicia.<br />
“I could make it a part of you, you get a youthful part, she can’t sleep around without your say, and you deny him his prize~” Selicia calmly suggested with a shrug.<br />
<br />
The frazzled Victoria’s face lit up as she processed the idea, not thinking quite clearly. “Do it… He wants her so badly? Well, we can just let them have one last hurrah… Under my supervision~” She chuckled madly as she eyed the dribbling vagina in her hand.<br />
<br />
With a wave of her hand, Selicia stripped Victoria’s clothing away into the ether. “Place it in front of your own, Dear~” She waited until Victoria placed the back of Cassandra to her own vagina. With a gesture, the two became attached and Cassandra was slowly drawn into Victoria’s body. The older woman did have a similar, yet more mature figure as her daughter did after all. Victoria gasped and buckled as the pleasure that Cassandra had felt poured into her upon their merging. A few brief spurts of fluids on the floor and the merger was complete.<br />
<br />
Sitting up into a kneeling position, Victoria experimentally pulled on the lips of her new vagina shuddering as she did so. Her head shot up in surprise as she must’ve heard Cassandra’s voice moan in her head. “What… Where? Is she…?” Victoria looked about their surrounding as if she expected it all to be a prank.<br />
<br />
“It’s a minor side effect of the merger. Soon she’ll either disappear from your mind or you’ll get used to it. Pay it no mind~” Selicia dismissed the worry of the woman before glancing toward the door. “I suppose, now we wait, hmm?”<br />
<br />
Hours passed before the door to the outside opened an a fairly average man stepped through. Selicia stayed out of sight using magic to hide herself as she watched the surprise on the man’s face. There standing before him was a nude Victoria with a wildly contrasting bush that hadn’t been there before. Even the piercing would be new to him… At least, it would be as it was now on Victoria. Before he could say much more, Victoria pounced on him like an animal.<br />
<br />
“You’re finally home… I bet you just couldn’t wait to see Cassandra, could you?” The man was flabbergasted beneath the normally reserved woman. Before he could even speak, she hopped forward kneeling over him with her vagina hovering over his face. A thin line of fluid stretched down and alighted his nose as Victoria spoke. “Well? Aren’t you going to say hello? Kiss her? Maybe even fuck her?!” Shock grew on the man’s face as the situation flew wildly out of control, he made to get up… Victoria slammed her waist down on his chest knocking the wind out of him. “No! You’re wanted the little cunt! You’re going to have her! Right here! Right now!”<br />
<br />
A little “help” from Selicia saw the obstacle of the man’s fly removed as his member sprung traitorously outward. Another little assist from Selicia as she set the spell to work on the man himself. Victoria settled herself on his tip and thrust downward taking all of him in one go. She pumped her hips on the man without even realizing or maybe even caring that he was dwindling in a similar fashion to her daughter… Only faster… Ravaging his member was untimely as she could, she gripped his ever-loosening collar. By the time she was ready to orgasm, she held an empty suit jacket, the wearer long since transformed. One final thrust and her lips kissed the cold stone floor. The shock of the floor’s temperature causing her to lose her control and orgasm forcefully, causing a small puddle beneath her.<br />
<br />
Victoria rested on what was left of the man for several minutes before sliding off the dildo suctioned to the floor. It was as unremarkable as the man himself had been. Some veiny ridges and a large soft tip, but that was the most it had. Huffing from exertion, she plucked it from the floor with a pop and walked it over to the trashcan by the door. “Goodbye, you cheap bastard…” Victoria unceremoniously dumped the newly made and freshly used toy in the trash. Just as she remarked she would earlier.<br />
<br />
Seeing Selicia come out of her hiding, she sat on a nearby chair uncaring of the fluids dribbling onto its cushion. “It’s over… I can move on knowing that neither of them will get in my way again… How… How can I repay you for this?” She sighed leaning back in the chair keeping her eyes on Selicia.<br />
<br />
“Well, there is my fee for the expedited service~” Selicia cooed seeing the exhausted woman uncaringly flaunt her nudity.<br />
<br />
“Yes… I did say anything you want… Fine then, name it…” No sooner did the words leave her lips than she felt something odd within herself.<br />
<br />
“Fantastic, in that case, I’ll be taking you~” Selicia grinned with false benevolence as she set about changing Victoria herself.<br />
<br />
Victoria&#39;s Brief Perspective:<br />
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br />
<br />
Victoria watched as her limbs shrank away similar to what Cassandra’s had done except in the opposite manner. Her hands and feet drew inward toward her limbs. The outer most extremities become nubs on the ends of her limbs. Her limbs drew upward into their upper halves slowly in her perspective as she mentally struggled against it. Soon those upper portions of her limbs melded into her torso… Was she about to become a vagina just like her daughter?!<br />
<br />
No… Wait! Her daughter was her vagina now and if that happened… She’d be left inside her own daughter! No… No! It wasn’t fair! She wasn’t the one who deserved to be punished! It was those two, it was…<br />
<br />
“Poor mother… Kindness begets kindness, doesn’t it?” Cassandra spoke slowly almost drunkenly in Victoria’s mind. “Just accept that you’re going to be a part of me forever now… You’ll love it~” Cassandra giggled drunkenly, malice dripping off her words.<br />
<br />
No! No… She wouldn’t let this happen! She’d stop that witch from doing this to her somehow! She’d… Victoria was already shrinking into the chair she rested on. It was already too late… Now, she was going to be her daughter’s vagina to the end of her days… She felt her body soften as she shrank but, it was her entire head and torso shrinking together… It was different… It was different! Victoria reveled mentally in the realization that whatever she was, it would still be her and her daughter would still be her vagina!<br />
<br />
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br />
<br />
The now six inch tall toy was so excited at it’s final form, Selicia could just feel it as she picked it up. At least… The main personality inside of it was~ She held in her hand a squishy Victoria torso and head in her hand. Giving the toy a squeeze, the toy bulged outward on either side of her grip. It’d make a wonderful stress toy for future meetings like Victoria’s had been… Of course, the vaginal cavity was still there, mostly as a novelty, should she, or if she sold it later, whomever felt like adding a naughty bit of fun to it~ For now though, it belonged to her~ As she walked out the front of the now vacant house, she eyed the trash can and it’s resident… “It’s already where it belongs~” Selicia stepped out the door and as it closed, she stepped into her own manor. Ready to give herself, her own deserved reward… A hot bath and a good rest~</p>
