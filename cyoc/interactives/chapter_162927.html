<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A huge yawn escapes your mouth as you stretch out your arms after a long night. Sunlight is pouring in through your window and you can hear birds chirping outside. Your prominent morning wood beckons you from under your sheets to start jerking off, but you ignore it, knowing you have a big day ahead of you. <br />
<br />
You’ve always had a pretty large member and have always prided yourself on it. It reaches almost seven inches in length when hard. You are pretty muscular too and have a slightly above average amount of body hair. It’s your balls that you always are embarrassed by. Your boys are only about the size of ping pong balls. They aren’t extremely small but they look that way under your penis. They seem to mock you just as much as the boys in the locker room.<br />
<br />
Suddenly your alarm clock goes off and makes you jump three inches into the air. “Why do I always wake up right before my alarm goes off?” you think curiously. You reach towards your nightstand to shut the alarm off, knocking over something in the process.<br />
<br />
You turn on the light and further inspection makes you realize it’s a bottle of pills - no, just one pill. One large, blue pill. The container says “Have a Great Day! Love, Dad.”<br />
<br />
Your father and you are very close, but he spends a lot of time in the basement of your house in his lab. You don’t see him very often because he is always working on experiments - both beneficial and detrimental. His last experiment had increased your muscle mass but the one before that had given you a mustache that lasted almost two weeks. <br />
<br />
You’re not sure if you should take the pill since you have junior year semester testing today and you’re honestly kind of scared of what this pill could do. Nevertheless, you decide you shouldn’t mess up your dad’s schedule. He probably needs to know how his creation works by the end of the day. <br />
<br />
You leave your room and enter the kitchen. Your father is already downstairs, your mom is at work, and your sister is already at the school studying. No one is around to bother you, so you take the pill with a large glass of water.<br />
<br />
The pill goes down surprisingly easy for its size, and you don’t feel anything at first. But after eating pancakes and having a glass of chocolate milk, you begin to feel it’s effects.<br />
<br />
The most prominent one: extreme horniness. You can feel the hormones racing through you body. “This pill could literally be doing anything to my body,” you think fearfully.<br />
<br />
You grab your bags and head out the door even though you’re worried about your current situation. <br />
<br />
                                   *          *        *<br />
<br />
Your second period chemistry test goes fine. Just like your father, it’s your favorite subject, so you feel like you’re in your element. You breeze through  the questions and are almost done when you feel the intense feeling of horniness you felt earlier that morning. <br />
<br />
Something in your pants feels amazing. You can barely focus on your chemical equations. Something down there is... growing. “You have to focus,” you tell yourself. “Six carbon, twelve hydrogen, six oxygen is gluco-”<br />
<br />
Your brain is cut off as you let out a tiny moan. A couple people turn to look at you and you try to play it off as a yawn. Something had definitely happened down there. <br />
<br />
You ask your chemistry teacher for a bathroom pass and then sprint down the hallways. Your underwear seems almost... heavier. You rush into a stall and lock the door, immediately pulling your pants and underwear down. <br />
<br />
Your balls are larger than they used to be. What were once ping pong balls are now about the size of golf balls - maybe a little bigger. The horniness has gone away, and it has been replaced with happiness. The size isn’t perfect, but it is a great improvement. You walk back to chemistry and finish your test with a newfound confidence. <br />
<br />
                                 *           *        *<br />
<br />
Fourth period rolls around and no more changes have happened. “It must have been a one time thing,” you think. You’re thankful but also kind of disappointed. <br />
<br />
History also comes easy for you. You complete the problems with speed and accuracy, finishing the test before anyone else. Proud of your work, you get up to turn it in, but you falter. The feeling is back. You are as horny as ever. <br />
<br />
You turn the test in and head to the bathroom again. This time you want to see the growth happening. You enter the same stall and prepare yourself. Suddenly, your testicles begin to move. You can’t believe your eyes as they stretch and expand. The growth feels amazing and your balls are the now the size of baseballs. Even a little hair had began to sprout on them. <br />
<br />
Your confidence is back, but if it happens again, you don’t think you’ll be able to get to the bathroom in time. The upcoming tests were the hardest. <br />
<br />
                                *           *        *<br />
<br />
It’s sixth period for there’s any more action. Personal finance is one of your least favorite classes, and the teacher is one of your last favorite humans on the planet. When the horny feeling returns and you ask to go to the bathroom, she glares at you and forbids you from speaking again. “I’ll just have to sit this one out.” you think.<br />
<br />
Trying to differentiate between bank accounts is not an easy thing to do when your testicles are growing. You estimated they had to be as big as softballs now, and they were beginning to bulge out of your pants.<br />
<br />
The small tent in your pants suddenly makes you scared. “What if they never stop growing?” you ask yourself. “What if Dad made a mistake?”<br />
<br />
                                *           *        *<br />
<br />
The feeling comes back immediately the next period. You are suffering through an English test, pronouns and hyperboles mock you from the test paper, knowing English is your worst subject. <br />
<br />
You stifle a moan as the feeling increases. Then something strange happens. Your teacher, Mr. Davidson, looks... hot? You noticed his bulging biceps and his noticeable bulge peeking out of his pants. His chiseled jawline and bald head had never looked more attractive.<br />
<br />
“Wait a minute,” you think. “I’m straight. What did that pill do to me?” <br />
<br />
Just then the growing began. Your balls grew outward, pressing against your pants. You wanted to stop or run away, scared that they were going to rip through your pants, but the feeling chains you to your chair. It feels so good you can barely move.<br />
<br />
Luckily, the growing stops, but the giant bulge in your pants will inevitably be noticed by everybody who sees you. It looks you had stolen two giant volleyballs from the gym and stuffed them in your pants.<br />
<br />
                                  *           *        *<br />
<br />
Finally, you make it to the last period of the day - math. You’re pretty good at math, but it still challenges you. Probability and geometry you can manage, but trigonometry and calculus are just out of the picture. <br />
<br />
The horny feeling arrives only a few minutes into the test and you know right then that it is hopeless. There is no way you are going to be able to finish this test. Sure enough, you are right.<br />
<br />
Your pants bulge and expand outward as your balls grow ever lager. You’re in ecstasy and you can’t help letting out a moan. Heads turn and give you weird looks, but you can’t hide what’s happening anymore. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, a ripping sound marks what you feared would happen. However, your pants are still intact. “My underwear,” you think. “My underwear were just ripped to shreds by my ball sack.” <br />
<br />
You let out another moan. People begin getting worried. The teacher walks over and asks if you are all right, to which you respond “never better.” It was true. You had never felt this incredible feeing before. It was like all your best organisms piled up into one amazing feeling. Wet spots appear on your pants and you realize you’re cumming - a lot.<br />
<br />
Finally, it happens. Your pants can’t hold your balls anymore. Your testicles rip through, spilling out on top of your legs. They must be the size of basketballs, and they were covered with hair.<br />
<br />
People begin screaming and racing out the door. Even the teacher leaves you alone. You’re fine with this, knowing you can now do what you were resisting all day - jerk off. <br />
<br />
You slide your hand up and down your throbbing 7 inch shaft. Your balls are still growing and must have be the size of beach balls. You let the moaning roar out of you, louder than ever. It doesn’t take like to climax, and gallons of warm, sticky liquid blast all over the classroom. The encouraging cat posters on the walls and the maker board are now covered in your seed. <br />
<br />
You’re suddenly aware of where you are and what just happened. You try to stand but your massive balls are too heavy and make you unbalanced.<br />
<br />
You hear a knock on the door and look up to see your father. He was smiling. “I’m so proud of you,” he said. <br />
<br />
“You are?” you ask extremely confused. <br />
<br />
“Of course!” he replies. “Only my son could clear a room like that.”<br />
<br />
You both laugh, enjoying the father-son bonding moment. <br />
<br />
“Let’s get you home and get you cleaned up,” your dad says. “Maybe you can finish your math test some other day.” <br />
<br />
Smiling, he helps put you in a wheel chair and he pushes you home, you ball sack reaching to your knees and your dick still leaking cum. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, you cross paths with Mr. Davidson. His huge bulge and massive pecs make you release one last load of cum. You immediately blush. “I’m so sorry, sir,” you say.<br />
<br />
“That’s quite all right,” he replies. “Those things are mighty impressive.” Then Mr. Davidson walls away, rubbing his crotch. <br />
<br />
“What an incredible day,” you think. “Now maybe if I had a penis to match...” you say out loud.<br />
<br />
You and your dad share a laugh as he pushes you out of the school and towards home.</p>
