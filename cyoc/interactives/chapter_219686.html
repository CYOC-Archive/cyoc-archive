<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> Cruciata was familiar with purgatory; visiting from time to time. Mostly out of sheer boredom when she was younger. So portalling there from the prison cell she was in just recently was a simple affair. It was getting to Heaven that she was finding, wasn’t as simple as it sounds. Trying to think of the types of buildings that would comprise of heaven or picturing what her father once described only earned her a headache. As she was born a demon, Cruciata was limited to the locations of Hell, limbo and Earth respectively.<br />
<br />
“Oops, my bad;” a voice chuckles inside Cruciata’s head. “I was so enjoying the love you poured forth to Pava,” the voice continuing; that I forgot to open a portal for you.”<br />
Before Pava could ask who was talking to her; a portal of Holy light opens up before her. Feeling the warmth radiating from it; Cruciata, with tears flowing from her eyes enters.<br />
<br />
******************************************************************<br />
<br />
“Do you believe in what Nergal told you,” Enoch sipping the scotch that his father just poured; “about pretending to work with Beelzebub in order to take him down?”<br />
 “It is a coincidence,” Lucifer looking pensive as he observes Dis below and the volcano belching its usual torrent of smoke and sulphur. “Yet not once did he bring up the explosion we both heard and felt,” Lucifer turning around to stare at his Wolf-Taur son.<br />
“You did cause it,” Enoch finishing his scotch and then getting up; “One of Loki’s little tricks?”<br />
“He left a stash of his metal boom balls,” Lucifer pouring himself another scotch; “despite being a prankster, he is inventive when it comes to contraptions.”<br />
“Well I’m going to turn in,” Enoch opening a portal; “You don’t mind if I crash in my old room?”<br />
 “Go get some sleep,” Lucifer waving his son off; “You going to need. I feel it’s going to be busy tomorrow.”<br />
Enoch just nods as he pads though the portal to his room. Lucifer turns back around to continue to stare outside.<br />
<br />
**********************************************************************<br />
<br />
Beelzebub pursed his lips as Nergal reported to him. Informing the recently revived demon, that his daughter Cruciata Carronfly has fled hell from her prison cell after talking to Lucifer. Beelzebub not so concerned that his welp of a child fled but more concerned of what she said to Lucifer. While Nergal did manage to get snippets of the conversation; the portions detailing what she saw in the east tower. What he failed to hear was the beginning of the talk; the talk where Lucifer confirms Cruciata did pray and it resulted in her new angelic form.<br />
<br />
“So you felt the need to just admit to Lucifer that you have been helping me,” Beelzebub quietly answering through the communication portal Nergal created.<br />
“He doesn’t know your alive,” Nergal answering nervously; scrambling to expend his logic. “Plus I made it sound like I was investigating you and on the verge of arresting you.”<br />
“And he bought it,” Beelzebub looking unamused; “What about his irritating walking flea bag for a son.” Beelzebub referring to Enoch; the only demon Taur in the Morningstar family. Beelzebub tried to convince Lucifer to kill the child shortly after birth; claiming that a half animal demon would only be a burden to him. An unintelligent mindless creature with his youthful visage; Beelzebub can still feel the sting of the punch he received from Lucifer when he utter those words. One of the few times he couldn’t manipulate the fallen angel for his own machinations.<br />
<br />
“I doubt it,” Nergal shaking his head; “he wanted to investigate the allegations. Fortunately I was able to prevent that,” Nergal feeling proud; “now that he is the new Chief of Justice.”<br />
“This complicates things,” Beelzebub gritting his teeth; “no doubt that welp will find all the loop holes I employed when imposing sentences on the human souls. Adding the addictive tendencies the sap developed when they were alive to their souls, ensuring their sentences in hell endure in perpetuity.” Beelzebub seething; “Add that to the fact that the wards are locked up my plans have clearly taken a big hit.”<br />
“What do you need me to do then,” Nergal asking; “Kill Enoch?”<br />
“Not the worst ideal you’ve had,” Beelzebub pondering; “But since my chaos thrall failed to kill him, I doubt you’ll be successful. Stick to him instead,” Beelzebub stating; “keep an eye on him, be his friend. I want to know what he knows” Beelzebub closing the portal in a huff.<br />
“First Adrammelech gets caught performing the ritual needed to bring me back,” Beelzebub waving a clawed pincer; opening a portal of pure chaos; “now Nergal tries to think and nearly exposes us all.”<br />
<br />
*******************************************************************************<br />
<br />
Semyaza was enraptured with sounds coming from the sitar he was strumming. Using chaos magic to keep the cherubs at bay, he needed to regularly play the instrument if he was to keep the singing monsters at bay. Never liking them to begin with; Semyaza was careful when using his forbidden skills. He was still playing when a communication portal opened up and the head of a vile demon poked out.<br />
“You’re looking lively for someone who is dead,” Semyaza stating while not looking; opting to keep playing his sitar.<br />
“The Iron Knights were a complication,” Beelzebub responding; “hiding them from Lucifer was a mistake.”<br />
“A mistake you learned the hard way,” Semyaza responding; “they are nothing more than a tool to use. Your words all those centuries ago;” the angel adding as he finished playing.<br />
“And what is the lesson regarding Enoch Morningstar,” Beelzebub snarling; “What of the interfering he has done?”<br />
“And what interference has Lucifer’s oldest son caused,” Seyaza finally turning around to look at Beelzebub; “Does this have something to do with the wards keeping back chaos?”<br />
“The same,” Beelzebub grumbling; “with the tampering I did that he undid, my control in summoning chaos has been cut off.”<br />
“Then maybe you should create chaos,” Semyaza smirking; “Tiamat did teach you the rituals to create shades.”<br />
“They are weak,” Beelzebub growling; “The dammed souls down here are not strong enough to keep one around for long.”<br />
“Then use an ally,” Semyaza sneering; “surely you have one or two fellow demons you can sacrifice for the required life energies.”<br />
<br />
Beelzebub was silent; a little jealous that he didn’t think of it first. Yes he had demon allies he could use; looking out the window of his secret tower, Beelzebub spots Adrammelech whipping several humans into the keep. All were the Iron Knights that were killed during the joint heaven and hell venture the other day. There were dead but they did have use. Adrammelech however, was practically wanted and stripped of his titles; this made him useless. Yet Beelzebub smiled; Semyaza’s words making sense.<br />
<br />
“You keep surprising me my heavenly counterpart,” Beelzebub chuckling; “always thinking outside the box.”<br />
“Yes,” Semyaza smiling; “everyone thinks it was Kusheil that created the Iron Knights. Ha,” Samyaza laughing; “I just told him what he wanted to hear. Just like how you used your honeyed words on Lucifer.”<br />
“So when shit goes south on your end,” Beelzebub sniggering; “that nitwit gets the blame. I’m genuinely jealous,” Beelzebub laughing; “as a demon, I’m supposed to be the devious one.”<br />
“Well we can’t let you have all the fun,” Semyaza smiling before getting serious; “Its best you bid your time until the weddings. You are after all dead;” the angel adding.<br />
<br />
**************************************************************************<br />
<br />
Cruciata entered a room of crystalized opulence. A cacophony of lights in all colour spectrums cascade from the various windows and reflective surfaces. With the portal closing behind her a voice interrupts her awed trance.<br />
“Are you Cruciata Carronfly,” The large angel speaking;  causing the young angel to turn around.<br />
“You are,” Cruciata feeling apprehensive.<br />
“My apologises,” the angel bowing in greeting; “I am Raphael; I helped Jehovah tending to Pava.”<br />
“Pava,” Cruciata sounding excited; “where is she? I need to see her.”<br />
“She is this way,” Raphael escorting the butterfly angel; “Jehovah is with her but Pava is still sleeping so we will need to keep the reunion short. I also believe you have information the Jehovah needs to hear.”</p>
