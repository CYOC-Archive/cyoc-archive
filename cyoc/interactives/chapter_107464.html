<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Time passed as Jared sat and tried to gather his thoughts. Eventually, Jared stood up and felt his sweatpants fall down to his ankles taking his underwear with them. He quickly grabbed them and pulled them back up to his little waist. He felt like saving what little bit of his dignity he had left after what had just happened to him however futile the effort seemed.<br />
 <br />
Looking down at his absurd feet, he took one careful step forward toward the pile of Sora&#39;s clothes. His foot felt heavy, but his legs seemed to be up to the challenge of moving it. He took another step. Strangely it felt natural for him to walk in this body, even with a pair of huge feet.<br />
 <br />
Jared reached Sora&#39;s clothes and picked up the torn jacket with one of his large hands while the other hand held up his sweats. As Jared considered if he wanted to wear the nearly destroyed jacket or not, the torn seams began to glow. Jared dropped the jacket like a hot potato and watched as it magically repaired itself. When Jared picked it up again, it looked brand new.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ll be damned,&quot; he said as he turned it around in front of him. &quot;Magic clothes. Makes sense, I guess. In spite of all of the fighting he was doing, nothing he was wearing ever got ripped or even dirty.&quot;<br />
 <br />
He hesitated a moment as he looked at the pile and considered what to do. On the one hand, there was the impulse to resist going along with Sora&#39;s plan. He wanted to be Jared as much as possible in spite of what he looked like now if only to spite Sora. He wanted to just leave the clothes there and try to get by in his oversized clothes. On the other hand, it was already a real headache to walk around holding up his too large sweatpants while his T-shirt hung off of him like a dress, letting one of his shoulders poke out of the neck hole. At least in Sora&#39;s clothes, he would be comfortable, even if he did look silly.<br />
 <br />
He walked over to his couch and hopped up onto it leaving Sora&#39;s clothes behind. His big feet dangled off the couch in front of him. He needed help he decided. He needed someone to help him figure things out.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Liz,&quot; he said, as he the idea hit him. His girlfriend. She could help him. Like him, she was a bit of a geek. Her big obsession was anime, though. She loved shonen series, and he figured that an anime fan like her would have enough imagination to help him out.<br />
 <br />
He grabbed his phone off of the end table and started to call her, but stopped himself when he realized that she wouldn&#39;t recognize his voice now. He typed out a text to her instead:<br />
 <br />
&quot;Liz,&quot; he wrote. &quot;something very strange just happened 2 me. i need u to come 2 my place right now. please.&quot;<br />
 <br />
He hit send and waited for a reply. Seconds later she responded:<br />
 <br />
&quot;uh oh. i&#39;ll be over in a just a bit. hang tight.&quot;<br />
 <br />
He put down his phone and just sat there and sighed. What a mess he was in. He looked down at his relatively big hands and flexed his fingers. &quot;This body is going to take a bit of getting used to,&quot; he said, still feeling weird about his pubescent voice.<br />
 <br />
After what seemed like an eternity, the doorbell rang and he stretched up behind him to the button to buzz Liz into his building. As he waited for her to arrive at his door, he considered just what he was going to say when she saw him. Would she even believe him when he told her what happened to him? He worried. What if she didn&#39;t?<br />
 <br />
Liz knocked and said, &quot;I&#39;m here,&quot; a minute later. Jared took a deep breath, slipped off the couch, and reached up to unlock the deadbolt. Then he opened the door and took a couple of steps back, carefully holding up his sweatpants in one hand.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Hi, Liz,&quot; he said as she stepped inside. She seemed so tall compared to him now. Normally, he had a good 6&quot; inches on her in height, but now he was eye level to her lower chest.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Um, hello,&quot; she said uncertainly in return. &quot;And, who are you?&quot;<br />
 <br />
Jared frowned. &quot;It&#39;s me, Jared,&quot; he said. &quot;This is the strange thing that I texted you about.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;What?&quot; she said. &quot;Is this a joke?&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;It&#39;s not a joke,&quot; he said. &quot;Listen, Just close the door. I&#39;ll tell you how it happened.&quot; She closed it behind her and leaned against the door as she listened. He went in to the whole story then, about playing the videogame and switching bodies. Liz just stood there listening quietly until Jared wrapped up the story. &quot;...And, now he&#39;s out there somewhere with my body doing who knows what. I just didn&#39;t know what to do now, so I texted you.&quot;<br />
 <br />
She took a breath and thought a moment, while Jared held his breath. &quot;I&#39;m not sure if I believe that,&quot; she said at last, sounding unconvinced but still open-minded.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Well, I mean, just look at me,&quot; Jared said gesturing to his body with his free hand. &quot;Look at my feet for Christ&#39;s sake. Have you ever seen a kid with feet like these?&quot;<br />
 <br />
She looked, and her eyes went wide when he wiggled his big toes. &quot;Wow, no. I guess you kinda do look like an videogame character or something. That hair sure seems like it&#39;s straight out of an anime.&quot; She stepped up to him and probed his pointed hair. Then, she put a hand on his shoulder. &quot;Jared?&quot; she asked with a half excited smile. &quot;Is it really you?&quot;<br />
 <br />
He nodded, and she smiled fully. She wrapped her arms around him and hugged his face to her chest. She didn&#39;t have the largest breasts in the world, only modest B-cups, but he felt them pressed against his forehead then and sighed, relieved that she believed him.<br />
 <br />
She let him go, putting her hands on his shoulders, and they looked at each other past her breasts. She smiled reassuringly. &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; she said. &quot;We&#39;ll figure this out somehow.&quot;<br />
 <br />
He smiled back. &quot;Thanks. That really means a lot. I don&#39;t think I could handle this alone.&quot;<br />
 <br />
She put a hand on his face and said, &quot;Wow, your eyes are so blue. You know, you&#39;re kinda cute now.&quot; After a second, she realized what she had just said and went into damage repair mode as Jared&#39;s face fell a little. &quot;Um, I mean... in a way. Not like you weren&#39;t cute before, I mean. You just look really... I dunno... sweet and innocent now I guess.&quot;<br />
 <br />
He sighed, &quot;I&#39;d rather just be me again.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Well,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m just saying that it could be worse. At least you look good.&quot; She smiled at him, and he replied with his own weak smile. She noticed the clothes on the ground next to him and picked up one of Sora&#39;s huge shoes with both hands. &quot;Wow,&quot; she said. &quot;He sure has some big feet.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jared replied. &quot;Now, they&#39;re my big feet. Though, I thought they&#39;d be more awkward than they are really. I don&#39;t seem to have much trouble walking with them.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Liz thought about the shoe for a few seconds and said, &quot;Um, Jared...&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br />
 <br />
She looked a bit awkward then. &quot;Well, you know what they say about guys with... um...&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;...big feet?&quot; he supplied.<br />
 <br />
She nodded and blushed. &quot;Is that...? I mean, is it...? Um, did you check if it is...?<br />
 <br />
&quot;...bigger?&quot; he said. Now he was blushing too. &quot;I didn&#39;t look,&quot; he said.<br />
 <br />
She knelt down in front of him and put down the shoe, avoiding his eyes. &quot;Want to try on his clothes?&quot; she asked, nervously.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Um...&quot; Jared said as he realized that what she was really asking was for him to take off his clothes for her. Though reluctant to let go of his old identity, he was just as curious about what he had between his legs now as she was. &quot;Sure.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Liz watched in anticipation as he let his sweatpants and underwear drop, but his shirt still covered his body down to his knees. He took a deep breath and pulled it over his head.<br />
 <br />
Liz gasped.<br />
 <br />
Jared dropped the shirt to his side and looked down at himself. Hanging down there between his skinny legs was the biggest penis he had ever seen. It hung down almost to his knees and was as thick as his arms.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Holy shit,&quot; he said, amazed.<br />
 <br />
Liz was dumbfounded.<br />
 <br />
Jared gently grasped his enormous member, lifted it up, and felt its warm weight in his hand. He noticed that all of his body hair had vanished except for a light patch of brown hair around his dick. He literally gulped.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Figures,&quot; he said. &quot;Everything else about this body is out of proportion.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Liz managed to speak at last. &quot;I guess there are some benefits to having videogame proportions.&quot;</p>
