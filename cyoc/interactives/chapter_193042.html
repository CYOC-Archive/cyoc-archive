<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luca’s birthday party will happen 13 days from now. In the meantime, the agency had me stay at the van Erwick estate for a while. The head of the house is in close association with the agency and allowed us to use his eldest son for this mission. He knew the dangers of the drug Hebrew Russo would unleash on the world. A few days without his son is a sacrifice he’s willing to make to save the world. As for the real Alphonse van Erwick, he’s under a chemical coma in the facility. He won’t remember anything about his incapacitation. All of this will just be a lapse in memory. A fleeting dream.<br />
<br />
When the agency mentioned that Damien would stay at the van Erwick estate, they did not specify which. Damien would only come to find out as he boarded a private jet that he’ll be staying at one of the many vandErwick residences. To be specific, a luxurious penthouse in uptown Manhattan, New York. <br />
<br />
The job as a spy pays well but you have so little time to enjoy that money. While he may still be considered on the job, Damien took ample time to enjoy himself. Although, this childish body is proving difficult to find whatever form of entertainment he could have. There’s a large private bar but he’s disallowed from ordering anything but milk, even though his father owned everything in the building. He wanted to sightsee around New York but the agency advised him against doing so. The child of a billionaire mogul is a prime target for people who want to take him hostage. Although Damien could easily mitigate such threats, the agency doesn’t want unwarranted attention while the mission is underway. <br />
<br />
The only recourse he received is through his young and supple butler. Marcus, he calls himself. The 20s or something raven-haired lad followed all of his orders, except bringing him a martini or sneaking him out of the building. When asked to bark like a dog, he’d howl like a wolf. With a flick of a finger and request for street food from Bangkok, he’d have it served on a platter a few minutes later. Even when he asked him to undress in front and let him see the perfection underneath, he followed. Did not even complain. Just stood there and unbuttoned right then and there.<br />
<br />
Two days into their relationship, Damien would have him kneel while salivating on his pre-pubescent penis. Marcus said that he wasn’t surprised when he was asked to undress before. He’d done it before to satiate Alphonse’s childish curiosity of what an adult’s body looks like. What surprised him are the utterly vulgar requests Damien made of him. He was surprised that innocent Alphonse already has his mind defiled by adult vices. <br />
<br />
Marcus is skilled, Damien gives him that. Even more so with pleasuring him with his tongue. He mentioned that he learned most of his skills from Butler school. His father, a head butler himself, refined the rest. So, Damien wondered if the skills he’s displaying with his tongue are something he learned from these places as well. Marcus would lick in the spaces between the legs and the balls, between balls and the shaft, and the head that hasn’t broken out of the foreskin. Then there were times where he would lead his tongue elsewhere. On the nipples, even on the lips. <br />
<br />
What pisses Damien the most is that their intimate moments together are always ruined by how quick he’d cum. These hormones, let me tell you. A touch from Marcus alone and Damien’s mind goes into overdrive. Although, every release of his seed felt like something new. Like the act of release is something that isn’t experienced. It is always raw and personal. Damien would find himself screaming every time, begging for more even though his stamina could not keep up. Then he’d always feel like a newborn babe by the end. Just an old man in a kid’s body, bare and easily gobbled up by the world.<br />
<br />
Then something strange happened mid-way before the birthday party. Damien was taking a bath in one of the seven luxurious bathhouses in the building when he felt something tugging between his legs. When he divided the foam in the pool to see his penis underwater, he swore he saw something slithering down there. When he stood, he realized he was stupid for scaring himself with his own penis. And by ‘own’, it was his original adult-sized penis. When given thought, he could revert it to his child-like penis. It wasn’t a problem, far from it. Nonetheless, he contacted Ted about it.<br />
<br />
Ted replied a few seconds later and acted like it was normal. Other agents experienced the same thing, often at the site where stimulation always happens. Usually, it’s the feet because of walking. But for a penis? Damien ended the call before Ted could ask.<br />
<br />
Afterward, Damien’s moments with Marcus have become more enticing. Marcus saw his engorged penis and was about to call for an in-house doctor before Damien asked him not to. He made an excuse about inflammation or something experienced when growing up. Marcus is well-versed in biology and he knows penile erection cannot reach such length. But the master told him that it was fine and he wasn’t in pain, so there’s not much left for him to contend with. What changed, however, is that Damien has taken a liking when it comes to penetrating Marcus’ behind. The guy was as tight as the tightest maidens Damien copulated back in his late 20s in Naples. Marcus did not make much noise except for a few quips and squeaks here and there. Just as Damien would release his seed, he’d transform it to his childish penis and release cupfuls of sperm. It’s like a hose. An endless stream of pleasure that always rendered him weak at the end of the day. <br />
<br />
These last few days have been a paradise for Damien, and he’s sad that it would come to an end a day later. He prepared himself and pulled his mind back into the game. He gathered the devices Ted had prepared for him and waited until the time was right.</p>

What did Damien do next?</h3>
