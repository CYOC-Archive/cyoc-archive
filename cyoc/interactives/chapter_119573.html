<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff browsed for a few minutes before he found one he really liked. Antonio Russo, an Italian-American World War II vet. He was far more handsome than Jeff&#39;s original grandfather, his strong form and square face closer to Elias&#39; type of attractiveness. His stocky figure was even hairier than Elias&#39;, his digitally-deaged form already holding a thick outgrowth of curly dark hair. While Elias was tall and toned Antonio was broad, his muscles bulky and olive-skinned. The biggest difference, however, was the fat cock which hung between his legs--proof that some stereotypes had their reasons.<br />
<br />
Jeff barely hesitated before clicking on the man. If Elias&#39; genes had enhanced him into the impressive figure he was now, what would Antonio&#39;s do? He&#39;d enjoyed his newly muscled, hairy form but the prospect of adding some size to his figure was deeply appealing. A part of him was getting off on altering his ancestry this way; this was way more fun than just doing it himself!<br />
<br />
The thoughts vanished as the changes began. While Jeff took after Elias strongly, it was clear that Antonio&#39;s genes were significantly more powerful than his original grandfather&#39;s. This was obvious as a pang of heat shot through Jeff&#39;s groin, a startled moan bursting from his lips as one hand curled around his cock. He could feel it swelling in his pants, fattening and lengthening, and a startled moan burst from his lips as he began to get hard. While before he had been comfortably large--around 7 in. soft and almost 9 erect--now he was pushing 11 hard, his penis as fat as a water bottle. Before his eyes his foreskin regrew, covering the now-larger head of his dick.<br />
<br />
His body began to expand as size layered itself onto his body. His shoulders grew broader, toned muscles becoming bulkier and harder. His chest pushed out, pectorals pushing out until they could be seen through his shirt. His arms and legs swelled until they were essentially stuffed into his sleeves, the bulging fabric leaving little to the imagination.<br />
<br />
Finally came the hair. His pubes thickened, hair racing partway up the underside of his cock and surrounding it like a forest. The hair raced downward, thickening on his legs and feet until they were indistinguishable from a grown man&#39;s. His chest hair followed suite, the previously-separate patches of hair combining, his treasure trail thickening and connection to the patch of hair which now stretched from nipple to nipple. The chest hair grew upward until it tickled the base of his neck, almost connecting to the facial hair which, while previously patchy, filled in until the thick stubble rivaled any man&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Jeff examined himself in the mirror, watching his facial features alter a tiny bit. The difference was minimal, previously blue eyes turning brown and his skin pigment turning more olive, but it only enhanced the Mediterranean genes he&#39;d inherited from both sides of his family. He grinned as he ran a hand over his jaw, admiring the thick stubble. By the looks of it he could actually grow a full beard to rival Elias&#39; if he wanted, an option which intrigued him. His altered figure made him look even older, the increase in muscle mass made him look like someone who worked hard on their appearance rather than the casual gym-goer he&#39;d been before. And the body hair--while more than he&#39;d had before--complimented his figure nicely.<br />
<br />
Jeff wrapped a hand around his cock, hefting it casually. It was definitely larger than most, though thankfully it hadn&#39;t hit the point where it was monstrously big. The addition of his foreskin made the head more sensitive and he moaned as he pulled it back, running his thumb over the red head. Precum leaked out the top, the slick texture aiding him as he began to fist his cock up and down. His free hand ran across his chest as he felt the deep canyons between his muscles, tugging on the thick chest hair and groaning at the feeling. He jerked his cock faster as he examined his form, running a hand over his face and admiring the raw manliness of it. He grabbed onto his fat, hairy balls and squeezed, gasping as he finally lost control, thick white cum splattering all over his hairy torso.<br />
<br />
Jeff panted as he dropped his hands, feeling positively wired by the experience. He knew his new family was waiting for him to go down to dinner but his cock was still hard, balls full and ready to go again. Still horny, Jeff hurried to the computer and typed in a few commands, his cock trembling at the thought...</p>
