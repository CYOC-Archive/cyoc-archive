<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sure enough it was baking; Tyler could feel himself start to sweat almost immediately. He crossed his front lawn over to his beat-up old Toyota pick-up and hopped inside. He started the car and put into gear, rolling down the windows as this POS didn’t have working air conditioning. Their usual spot, a gravel-strewn river bank shaded by tall willows and oaks, was only a fifteen minute jaunt away. Tyler decided to take the backroads, passing vineyards and farmhouses as he made his way through the hills. When he pulled up to the strip of asphalt that preceded the riverbank, he saw his friends familiar red Sentra parked there as well. <br />
<br />
Tyler cut the engine and sat there in his hot car seat for a moment, one of his hands absentmindedly reaching over to feel his bulge, or rather his lack of one. The heat of the day was making his flaccid cocklet relax and his balls sag against his legs, but together they were still small enough to cup with almost one hand. Once again he was hit with the same erotic thrill of anticipation, countered by a spark of fear and apprehension. He took a deep breath, remembering what his father had said to him earlier. As he was grabbing his sunglasses and his pack, he looked up to see none other than his friend Colby, striding out from the tree-line and making for his car. The man paused when he looked over and saw Tyler, his face breaking out into a smile before heading over to Tyler instead.<br />
<br />
Colby was a good looking man, he realized. He was shirtless, his lithely muscled and hairy chest exposed and shining with sweat. He wore a bucket hat over his shaved head, and his face was obscured by the messy beard he must have cultivated during his vacation. Tyler’s eyes were drawn to the large shape moving about in Colby’s swim trunks, making him bite his lip as his cocklet grew hard at the sight. Colby trotted over to the driverside window.<br />
<br />
“Hey, man! Where you been? I’ve been waiting all day!” he said in a deep and jovial tone. “You okay?” he asked, noticing Tyler had just been sitting there.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I was responding to a text,” he lied. “What’s up, man? How was Mexico?” he asked, stepping out of the car. <br />
<br />
“Oh, dude it was a blast. C’mon, I’ll tell you all about it. Hang on, though; lemme grab my lighter.”<br />
<br />
Together they trudged through the tangles of dead grass and blackberry, Tyler keeping pace slightly behind Colby, until they broke through onto the river bank the familiar river bank they’d been coming to since they were kids. A pair of folding chairs and a cooler were already parked under a shady spot right by the water. Tyler followed behind Colby as he chatted on about great food and beautiful vistas. When they approached the chairs, Tyler made a careful move to sit down first, while Colby plopped himself down in the other chair, leaning back and spreading his long legs. <br />
<br />
“So long story short, that’s not the phrase for ‘where’s the bathroom’, but I guess that’s one way to learn Spanish.” He chuckled. <br />
<br />
“Or another way would have been to just pay attention in Spanish. Which you took for three years” Tyler quipped, reaching for the cooler and pulling out a bottle of beer.<br />
<br />
Colby huffed and said, “Okay, Archimedes,” making Tyler giggle; he was terrible at math in all its forms.<br />
<br />
“Did you meet any small-dicks while you were down there?” Tyler ventured.<br />
<br />
Colby frowned. “No. I was kind of hoping that I would. I’ve always wanted to meet one.”<br />
<br />
“Really?” he tried not to keep his tone even.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, you know. We’ve talked about it before. I mean, its hot, and its…I dunno. Its interesting. I wanna meet one but I also kind of wanna, you know, have my way with one.” Colby said, his big hands fumbling with his beer. <br />
<br />
Tyler’s chest fluttered at those words. He took another sip from his beer but said nothing.<br />
<br />
“Damn. Talking about small-dicks has got me chubbing up.” Colby chuckled, looking down at the seat of his trunks. “You know,” He turned his head to Colby with a grin. “I measured this morning, and guess how big I am now?” <br />
<br />
“Um, ten inches?” <br />
<br />
“Nope.”<br />
<br />
“How long?”<br />
<br />
“Twelve inches! Three inches in three days, dude! I’m gonna be huge by my birthday.” Colby laughed and leaned back against his chair, taking a deep swig from his beer. Tyler was grateful that he chose to wear sunglasses or Colby would have seen his eyes roll up and close with lust. “What about you, man? How is your transition going?” he asked. Tyler could see him sneak glances at his crotch; Tyler’s own trunks were dark and ruffled in such a way that his bulge was hard to discern.<br />
<br />
“It’s been,” Tyler chose his words carefully. “Slower than yours, I’ll say that.” He finished his beer and reached for another. <br />
<br />
“What do you mean? You know what they said in health class; some guys start early, some guys transition almost all at once.” Colby said, his eyebrows knitting in concern. “Don’t worry, buddy. You’re not a small-dick.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but it happens. What if…what if I were?” Tyler asked, his voice shaking a little.<br />
<br />
Colby gave him a pondering look. “What are you talking about, dude?”<br />
<br />
“I think….” Tyler took a deep breath. “I don’t think I’m becoming a large-dick.” When he said it, Tyler couldn’t help but feel a little bit of weight come off his shoulders. <br />
<br />
Colby put down his beer and sat up. “What do you mean?” he asked, his brown furrowing.<br />
<br />
“I mean, its gotten…smaller. My cock. And I’m starting to feel other changes as well.”<br />
<br />
“How small?” Colby inquired, with a strange glint in his eye.<br />
<br />
“It’s not that small…” he lied to himself. “I don’t wanna say.”<br />
<br />
“Then show me,” Colby almost demanded. Even he looked shocked at how forceful and commanding he’d sounded. Tyler’s legs stiffened, his hands twitching, as the impulse to do what the man, no, Colby, told him to do. But he resisted the impulse.<br />
<br />
“No way, man. Its hard enough to even talk about this.” Tyler set his beer down and looked away.<br />
<br />
Colby’s face softened and he reached up to pull off his bucket hat, exposing his bristly scalp. “Sorry. Can you show me, though?” he asked in a lighter tone.<br />
<br />
“Do you really wanna see it?” <br />
<br />
“I don’t know if you’re fucking with me or not,” Colby confessed, but he still had that same strange glint in his eye. “But if you do have a tiny, shrinking cock,” he said, watching Tyler take a deep breath, “then I’d like you to prove it.” When he noticed that Tyler still hesitated, he said. “If you show me yours, I’ll show you mine.” He promised, his hand reaching down to rest on the lump running down the length of his thigh. Shit, he’s getting hard, Tyler thought.<br />
<br />
“Okay, fine. There’s no one else around, right?” Tyler scanned his surroundings before getting up with a sigh an undoing the drawstrings of his swim drunks. He took a deep breath before grabbing the waist of his trunks and pulling them down from the front just enough to expose his crotch. <br />
<br />
“Holy shit! It is smaller!” Colby half chuckled. Tyler looked down to see his cock must have softened up from his trepidation. It stuck out maybe three or four inches from his body, his olive sized testicles sagging loosely between his legs from the heat. “Are you hard right now?” <br />
<br />
“No,” Tyler blushed. “I’m just nervous.” He became even more nervous when Colby actually leaned forward to get a better look. “What are you doing?”<br />
<br />
“Its just so small. Its almost pathetic!” he guffawed. “How is that even supposed to work?” he laughed as he looked up at Tyler, but his laughter stopped when he saw that Tyler almost looked like he was on the verge of tears. “Shit, Tyler. I’m sorry, it just came out of me.”<br />
<br />
Tyler pulled up his pants and sat down, reaching again for his beer and draining it in one fell swoop. “Its not just you,” he said, trying not to notice how easily the beer rolled down his open throat. “It…it turns me on a little bit, when you talked like that. I’m still processing it.” He wiped his eyes.<br />
<br />
Colby stayed leaned over his legs, fumbling with his hands and not looking at Tyler. “Yeah. Seeing your nub, er, your cock. It just brought something out of me. It made me feel dominant, superior.” Colby admitted. He was, Tyler’s cocklet reminded him as it began to harden again. “Shit, I can’t believe it. Me best friend is a small-dick.” He whistled and took another drink. “Well, I guess a deal is a deal.” He said, standing up from his chair and gripping his trunks.<br />
<br />
“Wait, Colby, you don’t have to,” Tyler began, but Colby had already pulled down the front of his boxers, reaching the other big hand inside to fish out the length of his cock. Tyler gasped when he caught a glimpse of the base of his thick shaft, growing from a nest of dark and wiry pubes. Colby let his cock flop out over the waist of his trunks; it was almost fully hard, and twelve inches long as Colby had said. His hand held onto the base of the shaft to support it, but his fingertips didn’t come close to touching as they wrapped around his girth. He reached into his shorts again and plopped out his big, heavy balls, looking like a pair of oranges between hi legs. Tyler marveled at the sight. He’d seen large-dicks naked once or twice before on accident, but this was different now. This was a superior man looked like, Tyler realized, drinking in the sight of Colby’s hairy muscles all leading down to his beautiful length of cock. He’d never thought of cocks as beautiful before; maybe a little awkward, kind of ugly. But this; the round head throbbing as it emerged from its foreskin, the throbbing veins delicately winding along his shaft, the way his balls hung heavy and potent. Tyler was in awe.<br />
<br />
“What do you think?” he asked, his tone sounding a little nervous himself despite its deeper tenor.<br />
<br />
“I think, you’re one lucky son of a bitch.” Tyler laughed, taking off his sunglasses. <br />
<br />
Colby’s face brightened. “Dad says it runs in the family,” he said, as he pulled his cock up like a length of rope to grip the head. He pulled back his foreskin, making the bulbous head flare before Tyler’s hungry eyes. He was hungry, he realized. Not just the sight of it, but the scent. There was a musky, manly aroma emanating from his friend’s crotch. It made him want to draw closer.<br />
<br />
“What are you thinking about?” asked Colby, noticing Tyler’s silence.<br />
<br />
“I’m kind of embarrassed to ask this, but can I touch it?” Tyler ventured.<br />
<br />
Colby raised his eyebrows, but said, “Sure, I guess,” he let his released his grip on his cock and let it fall between his legs. Tyler pulled himself from his chair to kneel down on the sand and get closer. He reached out with one hand and lifted the shaft; it was heavy, and warm. Tyler could feel the faint thump of Colby’s heartbeat. The skin was soft and smooth, but Colby was firm and hard underneath. Feeling confident, Tyler reached out for the head of Colby’s cock with his other hand, his own cocklet hard and straining against his shorts. Holding Colby’s twelve inch rod in his hands really laid bare the reality of his life now. He was a small-dick, or at least he would be in less than two weeks. Colby was a large-dick, a real man, with a big, beautiful cock and heavy balls full of potent seed. Tyler slid his hand down Colby’ shaft to meet his balls; he could only fit one in his hand, and Colby wasn’t even finished transitioning yet! They seemed to swell in his palm, and Colby began to groan when Tyler gently massaged them. <br />
<br />
“Damn, that feels so good.” He shuddered, looking down at Tyler. “Bet you miss what having a real pair of balls feels like,” he said.<br />
<br />
Tyler’s moaned as his cocklet released a little but of precum, a wave of pleasure rushing over him. “Oh, god.” <br />
<br />
“Shit, should I not talk that way? I’m…”<br />
<br />
“No,” Tyler interrupted him. “I think I’m starting to like it. I don’t have to miss it; I have a pair of real balls right here in my hands.”<br />
<br />
Colby smirked. “Good. I’m starting to come into my size, if you know what I mean,” Colby leaned his head back and closed his eyes as Tyler began to stroke the length of his shaft while manipulating the head with his other thumb. “Pull your pants down.” he said, with force.<br />
<br />
Tyler reluctantly took his hands off of Colby’s cock and pulled down his trunks.<br />
<br />
“All the way, small-dick,” Colby demanded, his voice stumbling a bit but his face remaining hard and cocky. Tyler shuffled himself out of his trunks until he was naked before Colby. God, if anyone walked in on us right now, Tyler thought to himself, but the idea of being exposed somehow made Tyler even harder.<br />
<br />
“I’m not gonna lie, buddy,” said Colby, looking down at Tyler’s straining, five inch cocklet and back up to meet his eyes. “That is a small dick.”<br />
<br />
“It is,” Tyler agreed.<br />
<br />
“Its not going to be much use for you anymore. But we’re best friends, and I’m willing to share what I’ve got,” he hefted his cock in front of Tyler’s face. Tyler’s stomach gurgled, and Colby noticed. “You know, small-dicks usually have a feeder, sometimes more. I don’t know how it works, if my balls are ready yet or whatever. But you’re my best friend, and if you are a small-dick, then I want you all to myself.”<br />
<br />
“So, you’ll be my…” Tyler searched for the word. “My feeder?”<br />
<br />
Colby looked a little awkward, but said, “Yes. I think I need it too. Ever since I started growing, I’ve been hard all the time. My balls feel like lead weights.”<br />
<br />
“I read on the internet that its healthy for large-dicks to drain their balls on the regular,” <br />
<br />
“And small-dicks need their nutrition.” Colby said, sitting down in his chair and gesturing to his cock to invite Tyler in.<br />
<br />
Tyler almost rushed up to Colby’s lap and once again took the hard, throbbing length in his hands. He brought the flared head up to his lips, savoring the smell once again, before opening his mouth and bringing the head of his best friend’s cock in. His cocklet spurted and throbbed as the head of Colby’s cock glided into his mouth. For a moment, it was too girthy and Tyler’s eyes streamed as his jaw strained around it. But Tyler began to feel the muscles around his jaw gradually relax and slacken. He invited himself further onto Colby’s shaft, surprised and stimulated by the sensation of his throat dilating and then constricting around it. With each inch that Tyler took in his mouth, he was met with resistance for only a moment before everything eased up, until Tyler found his nose buried in the tangled mess of Colby’s pubes; He’d swallowed all twelve inches of Colby’s cock. The realization made Tyler come right there, his small cock spurting a few shots of cum between Colby’s hairy legs. Tyler took a deep breath, the man’s musky scent assaulting his nose so hard he almost came again.<br />
<br />
“Did you just come?” Colby huffed.<br />
<br />
“M-hmm” Tyler hummed. He felt Colby jerk and laugh when he did.<br />
<br />
“Shit, that felt good. Damn, Tyler. You took my whole dick on the first try. You really are built to take a man’s cock.” Colby admired, his hands coming to rest on Tyler’s head. “I bet that pathetic cocklet of yours barely shot anything out, didn’t it?” Tyler groaned and began to rock himself back and forth on Colby’s shaft; as a small-dick, he must have erogenous points inside his mouth and throat, because Tyler was reeling from the pleasurable sensations reverberating from within him.<br />
<br />
“I hope your cocklet gets smaller,” Colby asked, as Tyler continued his work. “You’re barely even hard.” he grunted, stopping Tyler’s motions so that he could stand up again. “You don’t need your cocklet anyway,” he growled as he began to slowly drive his cock in and out of Tyler’s throat himself. “You’re a small dick, now. You get your pleasure from your ass, and your throat,” he said, picking up his pace while Tyler moaned and shuddered under his assault. “And from Men like me. I’ve got all the cock you’ll need, buddy.” He taunted. But Tyler was loving it. As Colby began to face-fuck Tyler, hard, Tyler had a moment of catharsis. There was nowhere else he’d rather be, nothing else that he would rather be, than a small-dick at his station, servicing his man. With free hands he groped Colby’s ass and thighs, feeling them flex with power as he drove his pelvis against Tyler’s face. His friend had become a real stud, Tyler realized. The kind of man that made him grateful to be a small-dick.<br />
<br />
“God I almost wish you knew how fucking good this feels,” Colby groaned as he slowed down to take long, deep, penetrative strokes into Tyler’s body. “I hope you’re hungry, buddy. I haven’t blown in a while.” Colby tightened his grip on Tyler’s skull as he began to drive himself into the small-dick with force and gusto. Tyler moaned but held himself in place, his cocklet almost forgotten as [pleasure radiated from his mouth and ass. Colby wore a masculine look of hard concentration as he drove himself to the edge. Finally, he growled and rammed himself against Tyler’s face, groaning as his balls seized and churned against Tyler’s chin. As Colby’s orgasm washed over him, Tyler could feel load after load of thick cum pumping through Colby’s schlong and deep into him. His own cock erupted again as his stomach began to warm and fill with Colby’s promised load. It made Tyler feel full, satiated, almost sleepy. Colby held himself there for a moment, his hand almost tenderly running through Tyler ‘s hair before he began to extract himself. Tyler relaxed his throat, losing his breath and the cock slid out of his throat and out passed his lips. He coughed a little bit as he felt the muscles in his throat and jaw adjust back to normal. Colby took a step back and fell into his chair, taking deep breaths while staring out at the river. Tyler let himself fall backwards onto the sand, his mouth turning into a smile while his hand came to rest on his warm, slightly bulging stomach.</p>
