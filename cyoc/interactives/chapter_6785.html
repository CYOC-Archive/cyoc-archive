<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hank found that he rather liked sharing in the new shifter’s orgasmic bliss.  He was a horny old man and had needed release for years.<br />
<br />
Graham lay in a post orgasmic stupor.  His body was completely drained and he was barely conscious.  Further, energy consumption from the change had left him in semi-hibernation.<br />
<br />
Usually it took several months to years of repeated exposure to shifters to change but Graham had made it easy for Hank to force the change on him, though he felt it wasn’t really forcing the man into anything.  Graham had consumed probably a gallon and a half of grizzly bear semen over the last year alone and still had no results.  He was sure he was ‘cursed’ to be one of the ‘immune’ monoforms, never knowing that he was on the very edge of becoming what he’d desired since childhood.<br />
<br />
Hank rifled thought the semi-conscious bear man’s memories.  He had to know what made this man tick and he got much information on shifters, encyclopedic information, in fact.  Graham Millian had done extensive research and had burned facts into his memory by spending most of his free time in study, all that he might one day become a Grizzly Werebear.<br />
<br />
Some took in the genetic material of many different species, and as a result, would not change even if they were likely to.  Others were immune and wouldn’t change if they took pure DNA from the same shifter all their lives.  Some would shift quickly after a random sampling of many species (usually after a multiple species orgy with the monoform).  For some reason they would become a purebred of a particular species and it was thought that the DNA of a particular shifter was very compatible to the particular monoform’s DNA.  The bonding was almost immediate and indeed, this was the fastest kind of transformation; happening in the space of only a few weeks with but a single exposure.  Others, in taking in a majority of the same ‘family’ of shifter’s DNA over a long period, became hybrid shifters.  You didn’t get horse-bears or camel-leopards, instead you got a blending of closely related species in the same family.<br />
<br />
There were a few buffalo/bull hybrid shifters and preferred the term ‘Beefalos’ to describe themselves.  Some Mule shifters who had mixed horse and burro and hybrid horse/zebra or ‘Zeborse’ hybrids.  There were some very striking Tigon or Lyger hybrid shifters or combinations of the various big cats.  <br />
<br />
One such Tigon, with a flowing orange and black stripped mane was even a TV star and was born as such due to his father had being a tiger shifter and his mother a lioness shifter.  Chet Lyons formerly known as Ronald Agustus Pitman, played a very muscular, extremely hip private eye who shifted when he needed his special abilities to dig up the dirt on a mob boss or protect some frail monoform female client who just didn’t quite trust him or worse, was overtly accepting of the shifter.  It was rather trite and candy coated, but Chet Lyons was the first shifter to be accepted as a serious actor in the industry and not merely some bit player in a low budget monster flick.  James Parsons, PI was prime time all the way.<br />
<br />
Many shifters looked to Chet now as a ground breaker.  He was to shifters what Sidney Poitier or James Earl Jones had been to African Americans some forty years before; breakers of barriers in the industry.<br />
<br />
Hank noted with interest that Graham was an avid fan of the show.<br />
<br />
A great number of the hybrids bears; polar bear/black bear hybrid shifters or some mix of grizzly and other bear, like panda.  Graham had particular interest in this area of shifter culture, bears were a favorite of Graham, but being a hybrid wasn’t what Graham wanted.<br />
<br />
Graham was a specialist, he liked Bear shifters exclusively and he was even more exclusive than most, he liked grizzlies. Graham wanted to be a pure breed Grizzly.  He would hang out at the Bear bars and offer any grizzly who was willing a night of service; unquestioning service.  The Bears called monoforms like Graham a ‘Fur Gropee’.  Most of the time a blow job was all the Bear would allow Graham and to sleep next to his shifted form; sometimes only a hand job.  Graham would collect the seed at those times and lick it off his hands and the Bear usually didn’t care as long as he got his nuts off.  On very rare occasions, he found a grizzly who would fuck him.  One such bear even had begun to take him as a mate but, Graham drove the Bear away by being too needy, too clingy and what other reaction would there have been from such a tortured soul?<br />
<br />
Poor Graham was pathetic and he knew it, but he lived in hopes that perhaps someday his consumption of Grizzly seed would change him, that he too would be a massively muscular, fur covered grizzly.  It became an obsession that had overridden school and later what menial labor he found.  He couldn’t even keep a simple job doing repetitive, laborious tasks like washing dishes.  Graham would give anything to become a grizzly and that had led him to steal to support himself and to feed his obsession.  <br />
<br />
This latest heist, here at the yard, was supposed to net him enough cash so that he could go to a special DNA clinic in Switzerland that promised to make a shifter out of any monoform, for the right price.  It was rumored that a certain Austrian actor, formerly a body builder, was a Weregorilla and had been treated at the clinic so that his muscles would remain glorious until he died of old age, but that was tabloid bull shit and Graham knew it.  But perhaps…<br />
<br />
Supposedly, the clinic had a special technomagic procedure that would change even immune monoforms.<br />
<br />
Since childhood when Graham had seen the strongman at the circus change into a gloriously robust, muscular Grizzly, his brain had been on fire with the need to be a Grizzly.  Graham had snuck back to the tents for of duty performers.  The big man had made the boy feel strange inside.  Graham felt a longing just looking at him and he resolved to see the man away from the stage.  Bruno was huge and hairy, with bold tattoos.  He watched the great man through an opening in the tent flap around the back.  He saw the big man strip naked and change before his eyes.  Graham saw the huge penis grown even larger and it gave the boy his first woody.  Scenting out the youth, the Bear left the tent, circled around and had caught him by surprise.  At first the great Bruno was angry, but the child pleaded, said he just wanted to touch his fur.  The bear’s eyes grew gentle, he took the lad back into the tent and told him stories of the old country and his family and how they had been all but wiped out in the war, because they were bears.  Young Graham fell asleep in the protective arms of the Strongman who was also the circuses Bear act.<br />
<br />
Graham’s parents were not pleased to find their son in the arms of a monster and threatened to sue the circus.  Graham was heartbroken for the bear and how his parents had called him such bad names  Graham was furious at his parents.<br />
<br />
Now, years later, after consumption of a great quantity of Werebear DNA, he had finally shifted.  He had merely needed that one last push over the edge to change.  The addition of the DNA left on the clothing and sex toys and, of course, Hank’s presence in his body had done the trick.  Something about the co-occupation of Hank in his ursine astral form with Graham had been the trigger.  Graham lay in a sort of hibernation induced by lack of fuel.  His body had changed but awaited more food to change further; his body was in an energy conservation mode.<br />
<br />
Hank felt a certain pity for Graham and sensed the small boy’s wonder at Bruno’s change within the desperate man.  Graham kept replaying that time at the circus over and over in the his head.  It was a cherished memory that had been stored repeatedly all over the man’s brain.<br />
<br />
He also felt the void of longing within him, the need and Hank replayed the cruel rejections from first his parents when they discovered his desires and then from the very Grizzlies he worshipped.  Yet still Graham hadn’t blamed the shifters, he blamed himself for being a worthless twink.<br />
<br />
Hank felt compassion, yet he also felt that Graham was in need of some sort of correction.  With Graham’s police record, there was no way he could earn an honest living and now that he was a shifter, it would be doubly hard for him.  <br />
<br />
Hank decided to make a few adjustments to Graham’s mind.  He increased his loyalty and obedience, not really hard to do to a submissive personality like Graham’s, and attached that loyalty to Tim, Kelvin and Richard.  Doing this insured that he would obey them and over time he was sure that Tim would rehabilitate Graham’s personality completely.  <br />
<br />
Hank then adjusted Graham so that he was not likely to lie unless it was ‘morally’ right to lie for a greater purpose, according to the new set of ethics Hank was fashioning for him.<br />
<br />
Tim was a soft touch, just like his Papa, he would take this man in because he was now an outcast.  Tim collected strays.  <br />
<br />
Next, he changed Graham’s distaste for physical labor and rewired his brain so that such labor gave him a sense of euphoria and well being; a feeling of purpose and accomplishment.  If Graham was to stay in the junk yard as an employee and roommate to Tim, he’d have to earn his keep and it might as well be rewarding for him.  Hank quickly scanned through Graham’s current criminal records and found that, he was ‘clean’.  This had been the first heist he’d attempted since getting out of the slammer.  This was good; it gave him a chance to make a fresh start.  <br />
<br />
Finally, Hank hunted down Graham’s tendency to take the easy way out and steal rather than earn his money and made it morally and physically painful for him to steal what wasn’t his.  Hank chose that his balls should ache like he’d been kicked in the crotch as well as feeling so guilty that he simply couldn’t steal anymore.<br />
<br />
That being done and seeing that what he’d crafted was well wrought; he left Graham a changed man in more ways than one.  <br />
<br />
Once again, Hank manifested physically.  He picked up the unconscious bear man, placed him in the sling with the rubber cock still in his ass.  Graham deserved some embarrassment for his attempted crime and so Hank strapped him into the sling.  <br />
<br />
He wrote a quick note and placed it on the snoring bear’s chest that read “Feed Me Papa, I’m Yours”.  Hank had just finished cleaning everything up and putting the house back in order when he heard his Son and his lover and Richard come through the door.  How Hank wished he could see Tim and Richard again and meet the man his son loved so much, but that would have to wait.  Hank went back into his astral form and headed down toward his statue.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, after Richard and his wife had said goodnight and left, Tim and Kelvin found Graham and they were puzzled, shocked and amused.<br />
<br />
Kelvin exclaimed, “Who the Hell is this guy and where the Hell did he come from?”<br />
<br />
“Feed Me Papa, I’m Yours.”  Tim said incredulously, “Whoes idea of a joke is this?”<br />
<br />
Graham stirred at the outraged voices, still only partially changed.  His stomach growled quite audibly and Tim and Kelvin examined the half changed man.  He seemed very thin for a Werebear.<br />
<br />
“You don’t suppose the note is serious do you?”  Kelvin asked, “Would someone dump a  starving Werebear on you, Tim?”</p>
