<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emboldened by Suzy&#39;s help and confident that she would be able to handle this awful curse, Jen went on with her day like everything was normal, or, as normal as it could be. She made sure to wear her baggier clothes to dinner with her parents and little sister, nervously hoping they wouldn&#39;t notice that Jen had gained about twenty pounds due to Kyle&#39;s penalty. After dinner, she went back to her room, hoping to unwind before bed. The homework could wait. She just had one of the worst days of her life, she deserved to relax.<br />
<br />
And she did.<br />
<br />
Until she felt an awkward rumble in her guts. A rumble that told her she might need to use the bathroom too.<br />
<br />
Jen&#39;s heart sank. Why here? Why now? Of course, Jen knew that the curse didn&#39;t suddenly make her not have to shit, but she had hoped beyond hope that somehow the magic would allow her to avoid such a horrible fate. But, of course, it hadn&#39;t. Jen clutched her stomach in a panic. It was clear from the way she felt that she wouldn&#39;t just be able to hold it until the morning. What could she do? She thought about trying to make a run for Suzy&#39;s house, but she knew it was too far. Besides, she didn&#39;t even know how she would act will she was temporarily babyfied: last time she just spoke in a childish manner, but what if she forgot how to walk, or even speak? <br />
<br />
Jen rushed for her phone and dialed Suzy&#39;s number. It rang once, twice, three times, and went to the answering machine. Jen felt her stomach groan once again, this time sending a small amount of pain up her abdomen. She dialed again, then again. She sent Suzy a text, messaged her on facebook. Offline. No answer. Had she gone to sleep already?<br />
<br />
Jen was panicking, and sweating. She nervously hopped from foot to foot, which only made her stomach feel worse. What was she going to do? Who was going to help her? <br />
<br />
Her stomach rumbled again. Jen was out of time. She rushed to the bathroom and shut the door, as quietly as possible so no one suspected anything was wrong. Then she stripped naked of all her clothes and put them to the side, so that they wouldnt be transformed like her skirt. She put up the toilet seat and sat down. She put her hands together and prayed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, God, if you&#39;re out there, make this curse go away.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen sighed, did her best to relax, and pushed.<br />
<br />
And as she pushed, she felt her new, cloth diaper filling with shit.<br />
<br />
&quot;YYEAAA!&quot; she gasped. It felt horrifying, to have the warm mush spread across her butt cheeks.<br />
<br />
Jen let out a screech and stood up, smooshing her backside as she did so. Every little squish made her gag. She let out a few coughs before catching a glimpse of herself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
The hair on her head, usually lucious and wavy, was pulled into childish pigtails. To make matters worse, she was wearing a pink tank top with a picture of a flower on it. And then, barely being covered, was her white diaper. Thankfully, it was blank, without any decorative shapes on it. But she gagged again when she noticed the slight, lumpy bulge in her backside and the seat of her diaper stained brown. <br />
<br />
She started violently trying to rip the diaper off, tumbling around the bathroom as she struggled to yank it off, but it was in vain, and all her thrashing around did was spread it out. She fell down, sitting right on her butt and squishing it even more. Then, she started crying. She had just pooped her diaper, like a little baby, and now she was stuck in it until someone changed her. This day couldn&#39;t get any worse.<br />
<br />
And then, a small drip onto the front of her diaper. Than another, oozing down from her chin. Jen gasped. &quot;What the fuck&quot; she said, her mouth a little too moist, as she stood up. She could talk ok, but looking in the mirror, she realized she was uncontrollably drooling! She tried all she could, but she couldn&#39;t stop it!<br />
<br />
Jen took a few deep breaths so she wouldn&#39;t panic. Thankfully, she had taken her phone with her into the bathroom. She texted Suzy again and she called twice. no answer. Nothing. Shit. Jen thought about her options: she could still walk just fine, and talk just fine, so she could still get around. Maybe she could walk to Suzy&#39;s house? but it was pretty far, and if Suzy was asleep, it wouldn&#39;t do her any good, she had no way of waking her except banging on a window and risking waking up the neighborhood.<br />
<br />
Then, she thought about Kyle. Fucking Kyle, if it wasn&#39;t for his stupid curse. Jen thought about calling Kyle. Of course, he said that he wouldn&#39;t change Jen anymore, but nobody could be THAT heartless, right? Jen had suffered enough, Kyle owed it to her to take care of this most embarassing situation. Jen stood up, shuttering again as she felt the poop squish between her legs, and dialed Kyle&#39;s number. <br />
<br />
Kyle picked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Jen. Feeling a little wet again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen sighed. more teasing and barbs. Kyle was such an asshole. But she couldn&#39;t risk getting on his bad side. Not now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle, i&#39;m sorry.&quot; Jen said. &quot;i was a real jerk to you, and i deserved what you did to me. I just fucking shit myself and i need to be changed. Please help me. I get it, I learned my lesson.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a pause at the other end of the line. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that&#39;s really  big of you to say, Jen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen let out a sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;ll change me then?&quot; <br />
<br />
Kyle just laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah.&quot;<br />
<br />
and he hung up.<br />
<br />
Jen felt her body tingle, and she closed her eyes, knowing that another penalty was coming.</p>
