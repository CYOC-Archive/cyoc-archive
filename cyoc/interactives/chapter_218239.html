<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aaron read the sentence and blushed at the thought of getting plowed by his taller friend. A part of himself that came from his original reality wanted to deny that he was attracted to the possibility of getting fucked by Rita wielding an huge sexy cock but the greater part of himself had to admit to himself that he wanted it to happen. It still felt too soon for him to make that change to Rita but he promised himself that when the time felt right he would try to fulfill her fantasy. Before more could be contemplated the bell rung and Aaron and his friends had to go to class.<br />
<br />
The rest of the school day was about the same as the day before except that a good portion of the student population had fake breasts and bulges under their crossdressing uniforms. Aaron was surprised how normal everybody was about it all. Nobody seemed to care wether one was wearing them or not, but it wasn’t like they weren’t noticed. There were compliments made and recommendations about size and style but nobody seemed to be pushed into it or being pushed out of it. The worse thing that happened that Aaron saw was a teacher reprimanding a freshman who had started playing with his large breast forms during class. The teacher didn’t even force the boy to loose them just recommended that he wear a smaller pair if he was going to be distracted by the larger pair. Aaron wondered how this oddly peaceful environment would be effected by the new clubs that had started this year. <br />
<br />
With the last class of the day ended Aaron went to where Sam’s club was supposed to be held and found a group of boys waiting outside of the classroom. Most of the boys had fake breasts on underneath their uniforms and they all seemed a little anxious. The boys welcomed Aaron to their group and after only a minute of waiting the classroom opened up and Sam gestured everyone inside. The classroom was like any other except for a row of desks covered by a dark sheet. There was also a large box on the teacher’s desk. <br />
<br />
Sam started the club meeting by explaining the goals of the club and the meeting times. The goals listed by Sam were the same as the ones on the club list and Aaron was interested to see how the club would achieve them. After Sam’s introduction he asked the other gathered boys to remove their shirts and bras so that the club activities could start. Aaron and the other boys complied with the request and were soon bare chested and those that had been wearing false breasts were holding them in their hands. Sam was the last of the club members to strip and when he did there was a gasp of excitement from others. <br />
<br />
What Aaron had assumed to be a false set this morning turned out to be a hundred percent real. Sam had legitimate B cup breasts that were completely natural. B cups my not seem very large to anyone but seeing them on Sam who hadn’t had them a few months ago, they looked huge. Something that was huge regardless of perspective was Sam’s nipples that jutted out from the breast’s puffy areoles. They were as wide as pennies and almost an inch long. All the boys gathered around Sam and some of them asked to touch the miraculous breasts. Sam agreed and everyone got to feel their authenticity. <br />
<br />
After everyone had gotten a turn Sam backed up from the group then went to grab the large box off the teacher’s desk. His excited steps caused his breasts to jiggle in a way only real breasts could leaving the other boys to either feel jealous, aroused, or both. Setting the box down on the ground sam looked up to see several tented skirts and felt a surge of pride and a surge of pleasure in his own tented skirt. <br />
<br />
“Ok everyone the first thing you guys need to cultivating our ideal breasts will be this” said Sam pulling out a tube from the box. The tube looked like a tube of toothpaste but had nothing but medical jargon on it.<br />
<br />
“This is a hormonal primer that will allow the growth process to start. If I could get a volunteer to help me demonstrate how it’s used” asked Sam while taking the cap off the tube. All of the boys volunteered but Sam picked Aaron to help him. Still shirtless Aaron stepped up and watched Sam squeeze a large glob of pink translucent gel out of the tube and into each of his palms. With no warning Sam stepped behind Aaron reached around and smeared the primer right over his chest. Aaron gasped as the cold gel was smeared on before it was warmed by his skin and Sam’s hand. Sam continued to massage Aaron’s now slick chest as the primer was absorbed into the skin.<br />
<br />
The feeling was pleasant for Aaron but nothing extraordinarily special until his chest began to heat up. The warmth spread through his chest and  built up more acutely in his nipples. Sam noticed the hardening of the nipples and switched from massaging the whole chest to focusing on the nipples. Aaron let out a moan of pleasure after a particularly strong pinch of his nipples and Sam stopped his work and came around to Aaron’s front. <br />
<br />
“Watch closely everybody it is about to start” said Sam getting everybody focused on Aaron’s chest. Before Aaron’s very eyes he witnessed his nipples and areola expand and grow. Their former negligible size gave way to full eraser numbs. The rest of Aaron’s chest also seemed to swell but not to the degree that his nipples had. <br />
<br />
Sam then walked over to the sheet covered desk and with a flourish pulled the sheet away to reveal five strange machines with tubes coming off them.<br />
<br />
“These here are specially designed breast pumps that will the growth now that you are primed” explained Sam before he attached two cups to one of the machine’s tubes. Sam then got Aaron to hold the cups to his chest while he turned the machine on. The suction of the machine was strong and Aaron groaned at the tugging it caused on his now very sensitive nipples. To Aaron’s and the other new club members surprise Aaron chest began to expand to fill the cups stuck to his chest giving him the first sign of real breasts. <br />
<br />
Sam set a timer for Aaron and left him on the machine while it began to tick down. He then got all of the other boys to either prime themselves or get help from himself or another member to prime themselves. In less than a minute later all of the pumps were in use with a few boys waiting for one of the timers to run out. Aaron being the first to start had his timer come up first and he turned the machine off and removed the cups. At the end of his time Aaron’s breasts had made it to what could be called actual A cup breasts but after the cups were removed the swelling diminished. It would be hard to call what he now had breasts but it was definitely progress and if Sam was anything to go off of there was true potential in this process. <br />
<br />
Aaron could wait for another turn on the pumps, look at what else was in Sam’s large box or check the app. </p>
