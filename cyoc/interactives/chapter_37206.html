<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Now we wait for my friends to come over&quot; I said. &quot;Then we'll go to the pool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Harry?&quot; Laura asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;His name is Harrietta now&quot; I said. &quot;And he is Sam's little sister now. You should have those memories.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do&quot; Laura said. &quot;Why did your mother insist that I'm her daughter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you are her daughter&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But shouldn't she have memories of having only one daughter?&quot; Laura asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; I said. &quot;You see the ring I'm wearing alters reality and that includes memories. The only reason that we remember what you did is because I made sure to state that we would.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would you have me remember though?&quot; Laura asked. &quot;Aren't you afraid that I'll tell somebody?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And who would believe you?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My parents would&quot; Laura said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to understand something&quot; I said. &quot;When I made you my little sister reality was altered. This means that you were never born as Larry in this reality. Instead you were born as Laura. Do you understand that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so&quot; Laura said.<br />
<br />
Just then the doorbell rang and I went to answer it. When I opened the door I saw Sam standing there with Harrietta. &quot;Come on in Sam, Harriette&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Allison&quot; Sam said and then gave me a kiss. When she was done she said &quot;I like what you did. You know that I've always wanted a little sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You've told me enough times&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh and thanks for hiding our dicks&quot; Sam said. &quot;Harrietta had thrown a punch at my dick but it didn't land as reality shifted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had seen a problem with our dicks hanging out&quot; I said. &quot;We don't have to worry about Laura or Harrietta grabbing our dicks. Plus now there are no bulges showing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a bonus&quot; Sam said.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Harrietta said &quot;Turn me back you bitches!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry about that&quot; Sam said. &quot;She's been difficult this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Laura was just as difficult&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Change me back now bitch!&quot; Harrietta demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't demand that!&quot; Laura said. I didn't know that she had come downstairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't tell me what to do little girl!&quot; Harrietta said. &quot;I'm actually older than I look.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not anymore Harry&quot; Laura said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you know my name?&quot; Harrietta asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you forget what she had said already?&quot; Laura asked. &quot;She said that I would be her little sister and you would be Sam's little sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that really you Larry?&quot; Harrietta asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Larry doesn't exist nor has he ever existed now&quot; Laura said. &quot;That was a different reality. I am Laura now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That bitch has fucked with your head&quot; Harrietta said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be careful&quot; Laura said. &quot;She can turn you into a bitch like she did to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Laura&quot; I warned. &quot;You know Mom doesn't like cussing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laura sighed and said &quot;I know. Please don't change me again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't if you don't slip up again&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
Harrietta had a strange look on her face and suddenly said &quot;I remember playing with a poodle named Laura when I've been over here before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was me&quot; Laura said. &quot;Allison changed me back after a few minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then she can change us back to our old selves&quot; Harrietta said.<br />
<br />
&quot;She won't though&quot; Laura said. &quot;If she does they're right back on the verge of death.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who cares!?!&quot; Harrietta asked. &quot;What gives her the right to mess with other peoples lives!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean like we did?&quot; Laura asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We didn't have much of a choice&quot; Harrietta said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We did have a choice&quot; Laura said. &quot;We could have killed them quickly. Instead we dragged it out and tortured them. Allison could do something far worse than leaving us as girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what is that?&quot; Harrietta said.<br />
<br />
&quot;She could give us their memories of what we did to them&quot; Laura said. &quot;I think she could even make us live it if she wanted to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You've got to be yanking my chain&quot; Harrietta said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe that she can do it&quot; Laura said. &quot;I don't want to find out for sure though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I should just accept this!?!&quot; Harrietta asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It will be easier&quot; Laura said. &quot;Besides, we may actually get dates when we're older instead of raping people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean with men?!?&quot; Harrietta asked. &quot;I'm not gay!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not gay if you're female&quot; Sam said.<br />
<br />
Just then the doorbell rang again. When I opened the door I saw Danny, Jen, Rayna, Bandor, Jack, and Amy. &quot;Come on in guys&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
After they were all inside Jack asked &quot;What the fuck happened to you two? And why the fuck do you two have sisters now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know where they have been the past few days&quot; Amy said. &quot;We've been hanging out with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I tried to explain it to you&quot; Jack said. &quot;Reality has been altered though you don't know it since your memories changed too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Jack&quot; Amy said. &quot;Reality can't change as much as you say or as fast. Even if it did I think people would notice.&quot;<br />
<br />
I wanted Amy to be under the same conditions as the rest of us. I knew I could do it but the question was could I give her memories of the past few days of the reality where me and Sam were raped. There was only one way to find out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amy, you retain your memories when reality is altered&quot; I said. &quot;You also gain new memories that fit the new reality.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok whatever&quot; Amy said. &quot;This must be a joke. Come on, admit it. This is your way of breaking me into your group.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is but not the way you think&quot; Danny said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how are you going to alter reality?&quot; Amy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Amy&quot; I said. &quot;You have memories of the same realities that Jack has.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy swooned a bit and Jack grabbed her to keep her from falling. After a second she said &quot;Ok now I'm confused. These new memories have me meeting you for the first time today. But that can't be right. I met you the next day after I met Jack at the carnival.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Both of those memories are right&quot; Sam said. &quot;They're just different realities.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can that be?&quot; Amy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My ring has the power to make whatever I say the truth&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Amy said. &quot;I understand that. With these new memories everyone was worried sick about you two.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what the fuck happened to you two?&quot; Jack asked.<br />
<br />
Since Jack had asked a question I could answer without worrying about reality being shifted back to that. I started to explain and Sam provided details of what fingers and toes were cut off of her. By the time we finished everyone had looks of horror on their faces. Laura and Harrietta just looked down at the ground.<br />
<br />
Finally Amy said &quot;I don't get it. Why hasn't reality changed again? I mean it should have since you were talking and you said that the ring would alter reality to make it true.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's because Jack had asked a question&quot; I said. &quot;The ring doesn't change reality in response to a question.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder what would have happened if you had died&quot; Danny said.<br />
<br />
&quot;More than likely the ring's power would have passed on to whoever wore the ring next&quot; Amy said. She was a witch so she understood more about magic than I did.<br />
<br />
&quot;That could be a problem&quot; Jen said. &quot;The next person wouldn't know about the ring's power and could inadvertently fuck up the world royally.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If only there was a way to insure that that wouldn't happen&quot; Jack said.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is a way&quot; Rayna said. &quot;All you have to do is say that in the event that you die the ring will come to one of us. That way you know that someone who knows about the ring's power gets it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good&quot; I said. &quot;If I die the Ring of Truth will pass onto one of us here excluding Laura and Harrietta. If all of us are dead then reality will be altered so that at least one of us is alive. Then the Ring of Truth will pass onto them. If anyone here dies while the Ring of Truth and it's power is in their possession it will pass onto another one of us here, again excluding Laura and Harrietta. Again if all of us are dead, the ring will alter reality so that at<br />
least one of us is alive and it will pass onto them. Laura and Harrietta are excluded from getting the ring and it's power under any circumstances.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that should do it&quot; Bandor said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Laura and Harrietta are the ones who raped you&quot; Amy said. &quot;Why did you make them little girls?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I figured that it would teach them a lesson&quot; I said. &quot;Maybe by growing up as girls they'll learn some respect toward women and girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to be myself again!&quot; Harrietta said. &quot;I don't want to grow up as a girl!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Too bad&quot; I said. &quot;This is your punishment for what you did to us in that other reality.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I don't have to like it&quot; Harrietta said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I bet that you'll like it after awhile&quot; Sam said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So are you ready to go to the beach?&quot; Jen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My mom wants us to go to the pool instead&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Sam asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My mom was called into work today so I have to watch Laura&quot; I said. &quot;She feels better about Laura going to the pool with me when she isn't there to watch her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well ok then&quot; Sam said. &quot;The pool is good enough for me. How about you guys?&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone agreed that the pool would be good enough. At least they would be able to swim and lay out in the sun.</p>
