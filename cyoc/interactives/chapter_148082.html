<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>From the Keith/Greg branch from my page.<br/>
<br/>
Ps.  If others post more gay to straight Cyoc stories, I may choose to post more frequently (depending ;) )</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Keith finished up, he tried to search-to no avail-for his missing boyfriend. Of course, this was not a surprise for whichever reality his boyfriend will soon become. Of course, regardless of which, one was further off in the distance in person, and the other one was face to face via social media.<br />
<br />
————————————————<br />
“BLOODY FAG! MOVE IT WILL YA! SOME OF US AVE’ PORTANT’ MATTAHS TO TTEND’!”<br />
<br />
Goes the Posh filled, highly intelligent Goodenough in UK.<br />
<br />
“Oi Fags, stay straight, stay cool, in the summer waves of Hawaii, from yo baws, GriZily!”<br />
<br />
Comes buzzing in a nearby radio from a certain well renowned Hawaiian rapper. <br />
<br />
Either way, from his former boyfriend, who either turned into someone far intelligent or someone far too Hawaiian for his own good. In both realities....<br />
<br />
Keith will meet the same fate, as someone who is far too intelligent and Hawaiian for his own good.<br />
————————————————<br />
<br />
As for Keith, he rolled his eyes at the homophobic man, completely not ‘buying’ the remarks as he had to search for his boyfriend, thinking about him-his member could only rose in concern as it triggered the curse’s next move-<br />
<br />
‘HELA G IN DA HOUSE YO!’<br />
<br />
A large billboard over at the top of the entrance of the airport displayed itself, something that definitely screams sponsored as the bright lights and shining special effects were not the only thing capturing the cursed Keith’s attention.<br />
<br />
‘She was....hypnotising, and those...boobs of hers...so darn f...fine.’<br />
<br />
He watched her swish her hips, rubbing the lotion down as she spouted those sick raps...it was so raw...The Aussie slang of hers was just perfect...he loved....he...<br />
<br />
He had to get outta here!<br />
<br />
Dragging his luggage along, he snapped out of the trance in the nick of time. Running, barely drowning out the loud rap as he paced out of the doors of the airport to-<br />
<br />
~SWOOSH~<br />
Huh?<br />
~Welcome to the waves of California~<br />
<br />
Ocean crashing down, <br />
It felt so relived...like...<br />
<br />
He was home<br />
“Hakuna Wasiwasi”<br />
<br />
Mouth involuntarily mutterinh to himself, as the waves from the ocean began to cleanse his mind, and soul.<br />
<br />
It was cool, no worries, after all-<br />
<br />
“Hakuna Wasiwasi”<br />
<br />
Polished dress shoes degrading to a far more comfortable material as the head split open-revealing those bare toes of his. Wiggling stronger, larger feet hanging on those flip flops as those socks of his fell and turned into shells belonging to the great coast of Cali...<br />
<br />
‘Though nothing beats Hawaii...’<br />
<br />
Relaxing the soles of his feet on those sandals as dark asian...yet not asian, islander tan granting a soothing warmth which caused the man to let out a slight moan as he slouched, collapsing under a gorgeous relaxing massage from where he once came...<br />
<br />
‘Radical man...’<br />
<br />
Height rising upwards to the Scorching sun, skin being baked effortlessly as though he had always been out in the outdoors his entire life. Melatonin sizzling onto his skin, and so did his stress and anger as they melted away.<br />
<br />
Though it was not the only thing that was melting away....<br />
——————————<br />
Back in the scientist’s lounge that belonged to the newly made asian patriarchs, another section and layer was growing. <br />
<br />
Accommodating to a more relaxed...Hawaiian section as the race was respected as a branch of asian. A wave...chill theme took hold without question, as though it was its own form of dominance and masculinity-balancing his colleagues.<br />
<br />
In the pictures of the Riches and Percival, comes a newcomer in many of them. The muscular...dominant figure swinging both his arms around his colleagues with a big wide grin on his face which caused several annoyed looks from their respective wives on the sides.<br />
<br />
Numerous posters of marine time technology engulfed his section, spilling over to Mark and Percival’s side as they were his co-members on the project. Percival was in charge of the research, Mark was in charge of the organization-budgeting and all of it, while he...<br />
<br />
He preferred the hands on approach.<br />
<br />
A nameplate on the front, spotting the new name of a certain, Marine Biologist in the research theme.<br />
—————<br />
<br />
Those jeans of his rolling upwards until they are hanging just below his knees-straining and stretching hard over on his thighs as the epitome of masculinity they oozed, tanned muscular vitamin D from the blazing hot sun merge a couple grey rubber layers to the stretchable ocean wear he now possessed, splashing a green wavy line and a pair of straps around the waist as his swim trunks were the only thing concealing his tanned Surf N Turf special.<br />
<br />
Not brief fish N Chips but Sausage and Meatballs as they surged commando underneath, a sense of freedom, like a tight ass loosening up into a surfer’s chilling, firm and solid bubble butt-not a hard ass but surely can repel anything that seeks to penetrate his coolness.<br />
<br />
“Its the professor!”<br />
“Oh my God! He is so hot!”<br />
<br />
His member throbbed as he heard a couple of womanly voices which seemed to echo nearer and pumping testosterone around where as the waves came crashing down at every gay thought that tried to surface. <br />
<br />
“Heyyyy professor~”<br />
<br />
He immediately turned around and gave a winning smile at those who approached him. His white collar shirt saw the same way as it unbuttoned and split apart. Hanging at the sides as it grew longer and longer waist down, and rolled up further and further at the arms. The Professor had to always have his trusty lab coat on-even on vacation...wait was it his vacation?<br />
<br />
Ah well, working with marine life and surfing on the waves was his vacation.<br />
<br />
But yeah...he felt incredible..passion over these incredibly gorgeous surfer chicks flocking around him...tracing all the way down his washboard abdominals, caressing in between every groove in his six packs...breaking through into a cobblestone eight pack.<br />
<br />
Pectorals were round and hard as the ladies rubbed against them, denying any essence of gayness as they were erect with heterosexuality. His back was not exception, as they cockily carried the ladies on broad shoulders and muscular wings, he was far from gay as he allowed the ladies to-<br />
<br />
Mound him, sculpt him, into the adonis he oughta be. Some of which leaped unto his arms as they miraculously hung from them...initially. Being twigs before they appropriately grew in muscle, biceps straining against the sleeves of his lab coat which dispelled any rumors that science is just for nerds.<br />
<br />
“Bogus, man...”<br />
<br />
His voice dropped an octave lower, like a tidal wave crashing, as he gulped a large bob down his thick neck. And grinned deliciously.<br />
<br />
As he returned the favor, extrovertedly gripping and fondling their boobs as they blushed even greater. His thick meaty forearms were on display as the professor’s coat rolled onto the elbow, while as palms grew rougher and rougher as they extended wide into those of a professional surfer. Doing handstands and splitting through the waves with ease as this Hawaiian Hunk was no pushover.<br />
<br />
In waves, in his field, in his sexuality.<br />
<br />
These were grown women who knew how to appreciate a man’s touch when they got one. Not like those groups back in his school...and especially not the guys who were...did he really need to say it?<br />
<br />
But he felt something off...like something was missing and that these babes would not do it...didn’t he love someone else? Someone whose-<br />
<br />
“Get away from my man you dinguses!”<br />
<br />
A loud, Aussie accent came from in front, strutting in an exposed bikini top with long blonde waves of perfection. Her sunglasses concealed the intense power within as the other ladies giggled briefly-before skipping off to the other hotties on the beach.<br />
<br />
“You be giving dem the Hawaiian greetin’ aren’t cha?”<br />
<br />
The tone of this...woman, was intense. Like a tsunami ready to devour if the man does not meet her expectations, her man...he was her man...<br />
<br />
And he loved every single bit of it.<br />
<br />
“Course....I’ve gotta give n&#257; w&#257;hine the aloha.”<br />
<br />
He immediately scooped her up, and flashed a competitive leer in contrast to his cool and chill persona. Pearly whites almost seemed to be pointy, as though he has already set in mind his prize.<br />
<br />
And he intends to win first place, always.<br />
<br />
“But as for you, my akua wahine...you deserve the full Luau...”<br />
<br />
He pressed his tongue deep in his lover and idol like it was his last surf. The gay boy plunging to the depths of the ocean while the certified hunk breathed a warm serenity even amidst the storm, his movements as swift and skilled as the storm as they intwined with one another like it was ‘man vs goddess’.<br />
<br />
And both intend to win.<br />
<br />
While wrapping her with one arm, her palms expertly pressured those jugs as moans escaped those lips amidst the kiss, her left palm rubbed against the man’s jaw, like a reward as she chiseled his edges into a tight angular jaw, with a stylish diamond goatee that rests directly below his lower lip.<br />
<br />
Her right GRIPPED his rod like no other, PUMPIN’ IT.<br />
<br />
Almost instantly, his actions were pumped into over drive as he could not resist his babe. An intelligent brain, a killer bod. A cool Koi from hawaii as the fog of relaxation hit levels of pleasure.<br />
<br />
He needed....needed his akua wahine.<br />
<br />
He was hot, she was hot, and they were sizzling ta’gather. She really brought out the man in him as his messy waves flowed back into a raven splendor, as they tied back into a tight man bun. Topping it off was a reverse white snapback, with the state of Hawaii as its logo, which spun to the front as though he gained IQ instead of losing it.<br />
<br />
Facial features perfecting with every tug, a defining shape for his ears, nose, and a dark neatly shaped brunette for his brows. An unblemished existence as though he too-was transcending, to join her where she is at.<br />
<br />
She got brighter and brighter as the lenses of his spectacles cracked, taking on a darker, UV protective hue as the hot model now proceeded to gyrate around his hard on...<br />
<br />
He deserves this, he was just like her-Both in hotness, surfing, and most especially pleasure with a long rod who cannot resist da woman. Vision clearing up as the degrees only existed in his qualifications, a dark brown relaxed trance as he joined her at where she’s at, blowing every ounce of his old self for the new champion to come in.<br />
<br />
“Hakuna Wasiwasi~”<br />
<br />
PSSH~<br />
He knew she....<br />
She was what he has been looking for.<br />
<br />
“Now now Keani, you knows I be deservin’ every last bit of your cream dontch’a?”<br />
“Always ready for round 2, Hela...Always...”<br />
<br />
Like a self hypnotic chant as they walked down to the ocean, the tall and hunky Professor Keani, had piggy backed his Aussie as though they were ‘A God and his Goddess’.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here at Uni, doin&#39; my jam<br />
Ain&#39;t no pressure for the cram<br />
Gotta be baller, gotta be hype<br />
Hey, that guy&#39;s just my type...&quot;<br />
<br />
“Waka Waka this ain’t a lie<br />
My babe Hela G’s pretty sly<br />
And this prof digs the baller<br />
Specially when we go at it, in da water”<br />
<br />
Like Hawaii and Australia merging, they smiled lovingly at the other. The Hunky Prof tilted his muscular neck, noting his Aussie Babe’s wide grin one more time as they both entered the water.<br />
<br />
Knowing he did her proud as they went about it like a couple of sharks in the ocean.</p>
