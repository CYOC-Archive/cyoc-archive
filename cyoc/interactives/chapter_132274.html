<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
I woke to the alarm at 6.30. I don&#39;t know what I had been dreaming about but for some reason the number 241668 was on my mind. I wondered what it meant. An inspiration hit me. I got out of bed and took out the iPad. Typed 241668. It opened! I had broken the code. I grabbed a pen from my handbag and wrote the number down before I could forget it.<br />
<br />
However some things are priorities, my bladder was bursting. I went to the toilet and relieved myself. I was pleased also to see my period was easing. It was Friday. Tomorrow I would need to start the contraceptives again. <br />
<br />
As I washed my hands I looked in the mirror. The turban on my head actually looked quite fetching. It had been quite comfortable to sleep in as well. It had stopped my hair wrapping around my neck - something else that had been a new experience for me. I pulled the turban off and watched my hair tumble out. My curls did look tight, more like an afro than Taylor Swift’s picture, however when I shook my head as Sarah had instructed they fell nicely to around my shoulders.<br />
<br />
I had seen a collection of shower caps in one of the bathroom drawers so put one on and had a warm shower. I realized my legs and underarms could do with a shave. It made me wonder whether I should go down the track of waxing, but that had not been a pleasant experience. Shaving once a week or even less was not onerous. I picked up a disposable razor and did what was necessary.<br />
Today I wore the same wrap around skirt I had worn on my 1st day of work. However this time I matched it with a white knit top with thin horizontal black stripes.<br />
<br />
Dad was having breakfast when I went into the kitchen. He made a comment to Mum &quot;I didn&#39;t know Meg Ryan was visiting&quot;<br />
<br />
Mum said &quot;Don&#39;t tease&quot; Then turning to me &quot;You look lovely Jenna&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Mum, Good morning to you both&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah rang earlier. She will be over for dinner and will stay the night. Will you be home for dinner?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s so good to see you girls getting on&quot;<br />
<br />
I had my usual muesli then made a cut lunch. Before returning to the bathroom and applying makeup. I was very tempted to brush my hair but remembered what Sarah had said and resisted.<br />
<br />
I only had 5 minutes to check out the iPad.  I opened it up and quickly looked through what was on it. There was a Facebook account but Jenna was not a big poster. Her best friends appeared to be Shaz, Em and Gabby. They were going to meet up tonight. Em and Gabby had posted commiserations to me about Rod. I quickly replied thanking them for their thoughts and wished them a good time tonight. There were two other friends Anna and Lauren who also had shared messages in the last week, however further investigation would have to wait. I didn&#39;t want to be late for work again.<br />
<br />
I ended up getting to the practice at 8.15. No one else was there. I decided to walk down to the ATM at the shopping center. The round trip took less than 10 minutes. I was happy to see I had been paid. I withdrew some cash to give to Mum as board and to Sarah for renting the car.<br />
<br />
As I was entered the practice Linda and Millicent were in the front room and made complimentary comments on my new hairdo Linda said she had been contemplating getting a perm herself and asked where did I get it done? She knew of Amy&#39;s Salon. My perm was a real conversation starter and all the staff had to give their opinion on the pro&#39;s and cons of perms and curls.<br />
<br />
In the afternoon Millicent officially offered me the 6 month maternity contract. I verbally accepted then was given some papers to look through and sign, then return next week.<br />
<br />
I volunteered to stay later as Amy had a late patient and would likely not be finished till 5.45. Maria and Linda both had engagements tonight and were eager to leave. <br />
<br />
By the time I got home it was nearly 6.15. Sarah was already there and was helping Mum in the kitchen. Mum asked me to go and get Dad. She had some dips and a bottle of wine we could share as lamb cooked.<br />
<br />
I stepped out the back door. Biddy was in the yard and jumped on me &quot;Hi Biddy, you really need to learn not to jump on people. I gave him a scratch. He settled down and walked to Dad&#39;s shed. The table setting was really coming together well. I said to him &quot;Mum says to come in for wine and dip&quot; I pointed at the table &quot;This is really looking good&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was making it for Rod and Sarah. Sarah will still get to use it I suppose&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;She will love it I&#39;m sure&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenna, before we go in. I just wanted to say thank-you for being so nice these last couple of weeks. It has been hard on everyone but we are particularly happy with the way you have handled yourself. It makes your mother so happy that you and Sarah are getting along. In short, well come and give your father a hug. It&#39;s so nice to have you back Jenna&quot; He held his arms out. I walked towards him and he gave me a fatherly hug and a kiss on my forehead. It made me feel good. I realized I had never really had a father before.<br />
<br />
He turned the lights off and we walked back towards the house. Mum and Sarah were sitting at a table just outside the back door. Sarah was opening a bottle of wine. Mum had some dry biscuits and a selection of dips on a platter. &quot;A wine&quot; asked Sarah We both nodded/<br />
&quot;I just have to get something from my bag&quot; I said. I went back to my room and grabbed some cash from my purse. I returned and handed $100 to Mum &quot;For board&quot; and $50 to Sarah. &quot;For the car&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank-you Sarah&quot; said Mum<br />
<br />
&#39;Thanks&quot; said Sarah. She kicked me under the table and had a disapproving look in in her eyes.<br />
<br />
We sipped the wine and tasted the dips. It was a very pleasant evening. Mum updated us on the latest arrangements for the upcoming cruise. They would be leaving from Melbourne and cruising as far as Fiji and New Caledonia over 19 days. They had paid a bit extra to get a cabin with their own balcony.  <br />
<br />
Sarah told how she had been offered an opportunity to do a sales course with Mazda. She would spend two nights in Melbourne everything would be paid for by the company. ‘Why not?’ was the consensus view.<br />
<br />
I told how I had been offered the 6 months work with the dental practice. That prompted Dad to refill everyone’s glass and propose a toast to me and my newly found work ethic.<br />
<br />
Dinner was ready so we moved inside and ate a delicious roast lamb dinner. I helped Dad to clean up afterwards. I was part of a happy family, something I had wanted all my life. It made me think of my original Mum. I wondered if she was looking down from heaven and seeing where my life had led. What would she make of it?<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenna. When you finish come to my room I&#39;d like to show you something&quot; said Sarah<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. Nearly there&quot; I just had to put away a few pots that I had just dried, then get the dishwasher going.<br />
<br />
5 minutes later I knocked on Sarah&#39;s door &quot;Come in&quot; I opened the door. Sarah was on the ladder looking at items on her top shelf &quot;Which hat&quot; she asked. She came down with several hats and started trying them on. <br />
<br />
I told her &quot;That one&quot; pointing to the 2nd hat she had tried on. &quot;That reminds me can you come to Monique’s room and point out the hat Jenna wore to your grandmother’s funeral&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could. But only if you take this $50 back. That car is yours, you don&#39;t need to pay for it. I understand why you gave it to me in front of Mum and Dad but please take it back&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; I wasn&#39;t so flushed with funds that I could afford to pay Sarah $50 a week for my own car. I took the money she held out and without thinking stashed it down my top and into my bra. Oh by the way I broke the code to Jenna&#39;s iPad. I&#39;ll show you later.<br />
<br />
We went to Monique’s room and I showed her the hats. She pointed to a broad brimmed black hat. &quot;That&#39;s what you wore to the funeral&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Mum suggested I put a mauve ribbon on it to match my nails. What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mm. I have some ribbons that could work. Wait here&quot; She went to her room and shortly afterwards came back with some ribbons. One was a black ribbon with mauve spots that matched my nail colour, She wrapped it as a band around hat, tied a bow and pinned it in place. &quot;How&#39;s that&quot;<br />
<br />
Brilliant&quot; I pointed at the wardrobe &quot;While we are here can you show me which clothes are mine&quot;<br />
<br />
She started going through the clothes. Withdrawing about every fourth item and placing them on the bed. All up there were about 15 articles ranging from a scarf to dresses and a coat. I recognized the lacy black dress Jenna had worn when she tried to seduce me the night I had dinner here as Rod. &quot;These are mine but they are all items that Jenna &#39;borrowed&#39; from me. I didn&#39;t want them back. The rest are yours as far as I know. The may well be &#39;borrowed&#39; from someone else&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are welcome to take anything&quot; I said. I could see Sarah was upset. &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
She shut the door &quot;I&#39;m sorry. For years I was scared of you. Not you, the old Jenna. She had me intimidated. If ever I bought home a new article of clothing she liked it would disappear. Frequently she would get to wear it before I could. This dress&quot; She picked up an expensive looking black and blue patterned dress &quot;This dress I bought to wear to my own 21st. When I came home from work the night before my party, you were wearing it. You returned it to me the next morning, with semen stains on it. Mum had it dry cleaned but I didn&#39;t want it back. The rest of these clothes all have similar stories, maybe not so extreme but I don&#39;t want them back&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah&quot; I hugged her &quot;I&#39;m so sorry. Jenna was a bitch. I may look like her but remember I am Zach inside&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, Leave me be for a while. It&#39;s just looking at these clothes brings back so many bad memories&quot; She went to her room and closed the door.<br />
<br />
I hung up the clothes back in the cupboard. The 21st dress was beautiful. It felt like silk.<br />
<br />
I turned off the light and went to the kitchen to make myself a cup of tea. Mum and Dad had gone to bed. Mum was moaning again. Embarrassed I decided to forget the tea, turned off the light and returned to my bedroom.<br />
<br />
I put on some red satin pyjamas and the turban over my perm. Then went to the toilet, removed the remains of my make-up and cleaned my teeth. The whitening treatment really had made a difference.  While I was admiring my smile Sarah slipped into the room and gave me a hug from behind. For a minute she said nothing and neither did I. I just enjoyed the feel of her arms around me. Eventually she said to me &quot;It&#39;s nice to have a sister who I can love. Goodnight&quot; She broke the embrace and departed the bathroom. I put down the toothbrush I was still holding. Rinsed my mouth and went to bed.<br />
<br />
I wasn&#39;t in the mood for journals or exploring the iPad. I turned off the light and lay in the dark. I listened to Sarah going to the toilet and cleaning her teeth. I was thinking of how horrible Jenna had been to her. Eventually I fell asleep.</p>
