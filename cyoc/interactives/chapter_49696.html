<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Little Red Riding Wolf leaned back against the door that was the poor man's only way out <br />
that wasn't through even more wolves. Crossing her arms over her chest she watched <br />
intently as Alice would finnish up the last of the grounds keepers and they could then <br />
move on to preparing for the main staff's arrive and their assimilation into the pack via the <br />
game (she honestly didn't like the idea of sharing Master, but the twins had made it all <br />
good fun and they pleased Master, and she had been created to be submissive to him after <br />
all). <br />
<br />
Jenny and Marcy flanked their father, who had to sit down on a crate that barely supported <br />
his mass as the room was a too low him to stand at his full height. After having seen Jack <br />
and Marcine begin their twenty four hour march to deer-hood, and the other two men <br />
become simple puppets, they were interest seeing a true transformation right here and <br />
now! <br />
<br />
Alice looked calmly up the man, her paws together and her arms behind her back, her <br />
entire posture being one of innocent curiosity and plain observation. <br />
<br />
The ultimate problem all the transformations faced was really quite simple. How to make <br />
sure no one ever came looking for them? O at the very least never even remotely came to <br />
the estate to look for them?  Jensen been on enough dates to vampire movies to know <br />
what happened when people started vanishing after going to the Count's castle. <br />
<br />
They had provided good enough instructions for Marcine and Jack. On the plus side the <br />
staff wouldn't have any other jobs they'd be missed from (Bart had made sure of that), and <br />
Adam of course had neither friends nor enemies who'd miss him everyone would assume <br />
he had simply drifted onto the next town. And of course the shadows could clean up <br />
personal matters themselves. <br />
<br />
That left the rest of staff themselves who weren't total loners like Adam and wouldn't be in <br />
a position to really clean up their affairs after their absorption into the pack. The near <br />
incident with the police who had become the twins had taught Jensen to be careful. Well, <br />
at least a little cautious. <br />
<br />
It had taken quite a bit of brainstorming on Bart's part to come up with a proper solution <br />
for their scheme of filling the estate with wolves and creatures to serve them while <br />
remaining legally invisible. But there was one thing that could be possible but needed to <br />
be tested. <br />
<br />
The poor man had a name, he had parents, he had dreams much beyond working here, he <br />
had friends, but all of that was about to not matter anymore. <br />
<br />
&quot;You shall turn into a beastie that stands up as if it fancies itself a man that is one half <br />
wolf and one half dragon. You'll be made out of stone and as such you won't really be able <br />
to eat or breath, but being stone you won't really need to either will you? Rocks can roll <br />
down a hill or fly went spat out of a volcano and all that, so you'll be able to move about <br />
and fly too. <br />
<br />
Rocks remain at their post without fail, and never retreat from the enemy, and so being <br />
made of rock you'll be loyal to the pack and Master and never grow bored or tired with <br />
standing still all day and all night without so much as blinking.  <br />
<br />
Also. No one besides us wolves and who us wolves have played this game with shall <br />
remember who you were. It will be as if a Snark that was a Boojum had found you. Double <br />
goes for any records of you since we have not played the game with your records and the <br />
records of you would not be able to play the game anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen, Marcy, and Kaylee all blinked at this one. <br />
<br />
&quot;Read the poem.&quot;  Jenny said proudly at having known what it meant. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have...&quot; The poor man was barely able to croak out hearing of... the murder of his <br />
memory. <br />
<br />
&quot;You do not count.&quot; Alice said simply. &quot;This all won't happen for about five minutes and <br />
won't happen for precisely four minute and forty four seconds. You really should use that <br />
time to wish your parents fair well and friend if you have the time. But you really shouldn't <br />
mention they won't remember you soon, nor should you mention games or wolves. That <br />
could cause trouble for the pack, and this is the absolutely last thing you want to do really <br />
so you really should give a very good reason for them not coming to the estate to look for <br />
you. When all is said and done, you will have no name nor identity beyond your purpose <br />
and function.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jensen had no idea of the last part would work or not of the man's records vanishing and <br />
thus the need for the clause there too. But made a point to memorize the phone number <br />
he called to ask later about the son the parents had working at the Smith estate. Their <br />
answer would decide a lot. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm surprised you didn't have Alice include him becoming a lady.&quot; Kaylee said eyeing the <br />
doomed man and the glass wolf child. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted our gargoyles to all be female but Bart figured that a male one for starters would <br />
add some contrast.&quot; Jensen said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Actually,&quot; Jenny corrected, &quot;He'd be a Grotesque, gargoyles are statues that poor water <br />
out of their mouthes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcy gasped, &quot;You mean the disney cartoon -lied?-&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny turned to Marcy and solemnly nodded. Marcy whimpered and put her face in her big <br />
sister's shoulder as Jenny hugged her. <br />
<br />
The man meanwhile felt the thoughts overwhelm him, and hammer into his brain. Like <br />
needing to breath, he -needed- to call his parents and friends and tell them good-bye <br />
and that they'd never find him if they looked at the estate. He didn't really understand -<br />
why- he had to do so only that he had to like he needed to blink his eyes!<br />
<br />
The man went to a nearby telephone set aside for staff use and pick up the receiver and <br />
dialed the number of his parents' home. He waited fifteen seconds before it picked up. <br />
Sadly, in the short time he had, and not being a man of that grand an imagination on so <br />
short a term, he did the only thing he could think of to fulfill his NEED and duty to do as <br />
the game had directed him: and said the most horrid and hateful words he possibly could <br />
think of into the receiver. <br />
<br />
Kaylee in a blur was away from the door and covered her daughters' ears while Alice <br />
covered her own ears. <br />
<br />
After thirty seconds of this, he hung up, soft crying being heard on the other end. He <br />
called his best friend and girl friend in very quick succession and briefly explained he had <br />
a conflict with his parents and needed to move away and find himself and before they <br />
could offer more than the most brief of protest he hung up. <br />
<br />
The need gone now, he felt horrid for having done so. <br />
<br />
He didn't have to feel horrid long as he hugged himself as his muscle mass suddenly <br />
doubled, then doubled again, his clothes bulging as he grew some inches in height to <br />
book. Finally his muscle mass doubled more one more time and his clothes exploded off <br />
him effectively, his bones increasing in size and strength to keep up. Black fur flooded <br />
across his entire body as his hands turned into five clawed killing tools with black scales <br />
on the front as three clawed black scaled talons grew as his toes fused together and <br />
relocated. Then a tail looking like a kimono dragon erupted from his spine and muscular <br />
batwings burst from his shoulders. He felt a third lung grow inside his chest. His manhood <br />
vanished behind protective reptile scales between his legs. His face pushed into a long <br />
muzzle filled with fangs and his canines became like the front jaws of a saber-tooth tiger. <br />
His ears moved to the top of his head becoming triangular and his eyes became yellow <br />
gems almost in their gleam without visible centers. And then in one blink of an eye, he <br />
stopped breathing and his body was stone the same color as the walls and other outside <br />
structures on the estate. <br />
<br />
The stone beast looked this way and that, it's eyes centered on Jensen and bowed it's head <br />
so lowly that it touched the floor. <br />
<br />
&quot;So properly horrid a creature it does be.&quot; Alice commented. <br />
<br />
Jensen ordered, &quot;Go outside and stand in front of the front door where the stone dividing <br />
wall is, I always felt it needed a statue. Stay perfectly still until order otherwise. If anyone <br />
tries to flee the estate or cause harm to the pack, break their arms and legs. You will use <br />
your turn only when there is no other option for the pack or ordered otherwise.&quot; <br />
<br />
Then beast did not speak but merely nodded again and exited the house the way it came <br />
in barely being able to squeeze through the door  and almost cracking the frame in the <br />
process. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now that that's settled, let's introduce Alice to everyone before the staff proper shows <br />
up.&quot; Kaylee said. <br />
<br />
++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The study was not the business office, so the two wolf boys did not get in the way of the <br />
shadows as they went about their task of preparing to be Jenny and Bart's unwitting <br />
proxies in the outside world.  <br />
<br />
Bart had Kevin write down all his personal information from when he was Karen and Marcy <br />
was Mark. This was so Bart could have the banks have Karen and Mark legally exist long <br />
enough to sublimely move their holdings to some relatively anonymous accounts (totally <br />
private bank accounts weren't allowed to exist sadly), it was too ugly a waste in Bart's <br />
opinion to let all the Perkins hard work go up in smoke to be assimilated by their bank. <br />
Still, Bart knew to be more than careful: true this wasn't identity theft since Kevin and <br />
Marcy were legally giving their holdings, but Bart didn't want it to slip that the Perkins <br />
were now Bart and Jenny's little brother and little sister and had switched genders. <br />
Explaining that to the taxmen would be simply more trouble than it was worth. <br />
<br />
The moment the pups heard the door to the study being opened, Bart put the papers in <br />
the desk in desk front of him and began to read Moby-Dick (which he had been meaning <br />
to read for twenty years anyway). Bart knew he had been technically reading, but didn't <br />
want to gamble Martha would see it the same way. <br />
<br />
Kevin meanwhile had found a copy of Adventures of Alice In Wonderland, and still <br />
wrapping his head around the preface (after he realized the study had no Captain America <br />
comics). <br />
<br />
Martha did indeed come in, spotted them and went behind Bart and whispered in both his <br />
ears at the same time, &quot;Next time, time how long you'd have gotten by the time I got <br />
here.&quot; <br />
<br />
Bart's heart skipped a beat at Martha's words. He expected a swift whack on the tail but <br />
Martha left him only with a cold sweat on his noise and his ego ever so slightly taken down <br />
a peg. <br />
<br />
Martha then took Kevin and put him in her lap and began to explain the nineteenth <br />
century phrases and terms he didn't know (and wouldn't have known as an adult anyway), <br />
one left hand on the chair arm. One right hand around Kevin's, and her other two arms <br />
holding the book with Kevin, one head looking down at him, while the other head kept a <br />
watchful eye on Bart.  Her former employer now her Alpha female's pup and Martha's <br />
charge. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Darla and Fran sat on the chairs sideways assuming mirroring lady like poses without <br />
giving it a first thought.  Thinking the same thing, <br />
<br />
'I hope we don't get an overload of Dares, then again, maybe it's an overload of <br />
Transforms we'd need to worry about. After all, we can just use the 'dare you to dare me <br />
to ask you transform or dare and chose transform' clause to transform those people.' The <br />
twins thought. 'We can work out the ratio of new pack members and others that way a lot <br />
easier.' <br />
<br />
That was when they saw the stone wolf/dragon beast thing climb in top of the decorative <br />
short wall ahead of the front doors, the thing the same color as the stone it was sitting <br />
on. If the twins had not seen it move, they'd have thought it just a statue.<br />
<br />
Darla and Fran looked at each other and echoed at each other, &quot;I really hope Master leaves <br />
room for some new regular pack members with all the customized ones he's making.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;HEY~!!!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Both twins turned their heads at the same time to see Jenny having hopped up the stairs, <br />
the black furred wolf pup looking excited. <br />
<br />
Jenny waved. &quot;There's somebody the Master wants us to all to meet!&quot;</p>
