<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Erika loved her new body. She loved the fact that at 6’2, she was taller than most men, and the vast majority of women. She loved her more mature appearance.<br />
And she loved teasing her older sister.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Erika’s older sister, Maria tried to avoid her younger sibling whenever possible. She still couldn’t bear the thought of being smaller than her. And the worst thing is, that she knew it was only a matter of time until Erika would have stood higher than her, heels or not.<br />
<br />
And after a week, Erika tapped Maria’s shoulder.<br />
Maria turned around by surprise, and saw Erika staring at her back, looking slightly down by an at her from about an inch higher.<br />
Maria despised the fact that now, the thing she feared from was the truth. Even in her heels, she had to look up at Erika…<br />
She could have gotten higher heels, but even her current ones were uncomfortable, and she knew that higher ones won’t help her for that long.<br />
<br />
But Erika still wasn’t the tallest person in her family. Her 6’4 father still had an inch over her. But she still measured herself every morning, and knew it was only a quick matter of time.<br />
<br />
A few more days have passed, and in during dinner (Maria was eating at a friend of hers), Erika asked her father during dinner about burrowing a pair of his shoes.<br />
“Dad, can I please use your flip flops?”<br />
“What’s the problem, dear?” He asked. “Don’t you prefer a more feminine type?”<br />
“I do, but they don’t have any of these in store for my size” she replied<br />
“But wouldn’t my shoes be too big for you?” He asked<br />
“Stand up and I’ll show you” Erika said.<br />
<br />
And as the father and his daughter stood up, both barefoot, he looked at her directly in the eyes.<br />
“I’m as tall as you now, dad!” Erika said, extremely excited<br />
“This… this can’t be…” her dad said.<br />
“Mom, can you please compare mine and dad’s heights?”<br />
Her mom was also a bit scared of that fact, but she agreed. As Erika and and her father stood back to back, she put a book on top of their heads to see to what side it will lean.<br />
The book was perfectly straight.<br />
<br />
“Erika…” her mother said, shocked. “I can’t believe I say this, but you’re both the same height…”<br />
Erika beamed in excitement. She knew about it due to measuring herself at 6’4 that morning, but that confirmation from her parents was amazing.<br />
<br />
“And now, dad”. She said. “Remember that I asked to burrow your shoes? Look at our feet” she continued while putting her feet next to her father’s.<br />
Although her feet were thinner, and far more elegant and feminine next to her father’s masculine ones, they were almost as long as his.<br />
“See why I asked that now?” She added<br />
<br />
Both of Erika’s parents were scared about their growing daughter. She grew far too much over such a small timeframe. Their little girl was now stood as high as her tall father, with a body and looks far beyond anyone her age should have.<br />
But they already knew that they couldn’t do anything. The doctors weren’t able to find the source of her growth, and there somehow no health problems that should be associated with it.<br />
And their daughter loved it so much. Even if there was a way to stop it, she wouldn’t have agreed for it.<br />
This meant that they had to adapt to the changes, and act accordingly while hoping it will stop.<br />
Thankfully they were fairly wealthy, so they managed to handle the costs of the clothing.<br />
<br />
Erika herself knew what the cause was. After so many months of insane growth, she was more and more certain that it was the liquid that she spilled right before this all started. What else would even affect her that way?<br />
Still, she told no one. The worry that the discovery of the cause may somehow may make others find out how to stop it deterred her.<br />
And she knew it wasn’t going to stop soon. Quite the opposite in fact, as she noticed herself growing slightly faster this month than in previous ones.<br />
<br />
A few more weeks have passed, and it was June, the six month anniversary for Erika’s insane puberty.<br />
Erika celebrated that day reaching the height of 6’7. She grew that month five inches instead of four like in previous ones, putting her at a two full feel and an additional inch taller than she was when the incident with the salve happened.<br />
<br />
Her breasts were huge, with her and her mom buying her F cups yesterday.<br />
Her body was long, leggy and skinny, yet with curves, including a thin waist and a bountiful bottom.<br />
Her dark, smooth hair reached past her shoulders, yet it didn’t cause many problems and was easy to take care of.<br />
And her face has matured so much. If people had to compare her to her sister with their faces alone, they would have mistaken them for twins, as her face looked like a beautiful 17 year old.<br />
And her mind was like that of a 17 year old too, both in intelligence and in behavior.<br />
She was so intelligent in her class, that school considered moving her up to 12th grade next year.<br />
<br />
The dynamic at home changed. Now, she wasn’t just the tallest female around, but the tallest person, period. She found herself no longer teasing only Maria, but her father too slightly (but he was far less frequently at home, also making it rarer), using her superior height advantage over him.<br />
“Welcome back dad” she once said to her father a day prior when he returned home after two days when he was away at a work trip. “Did you miss your big girl?” She continued while bending slightly to look at him directly in the eyes. “You look a ‘little’ tired, don’t you?”<br />
<br />
Unlike Maria, Erika’s father took it far more lightheartedly, both because it was less frequent, and because Erika didn’t tease him in the same manner as her sister. There wasn’t revenge involved.<br />
Still, the father was very worried about his daughter outgrowing him, the vast majority of men and almost all women. The thought scared him, about the well-being of his daughter, and about the family dynamics shifting even further…<br />
<br />
And Maria, she hated being dwarfed by her sister, but also started to kind of accept it. She still generally avoided Erika, and always wore heels when encountering her, but she realized that at the end, she had to accept the fact that her little sister is going to dwarf her and have a hotter body than her no matter what she does. The difference was just too drastic to fight against…<br />
Still, it was very difficult to accept the bullying by her “little” sister.<br />
<br />
Erika herself was loving it.<br />
She loved how she absolutely towered over the crowed whenever she was outside, dwarfing all women and most men.<br />
She was the center of attention, with most people looking at her. Sometimes in curiosity, sometimes in lust and occasionally even in slight fear. She took it all with pride.<br />
She had to be careful to not hit her head on the house’s doorframes when she didn’t notice, but growing so tall to have to worry about bumping at doorframes if in the wrong position while walking (standing straight barefoot, she still had an inch away from the frame) was an achievement to her, proof of how enormous she got.<br />
While many people would have hated the inconveniences and being the center of attention in public, Erika absolutely adored them.</p>
