<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After returning to their hut, Vect and Sara found it difficult to find some clothing to wear. All of Vect&#39;s pants felt too tight on him and most of Sara&#39;s clothing would not work. After the initial shock from their bunk mates, they helped them search for clothing. Vect was able to wear the fur loincloths though he opted to keep to the longer ones that ended below his knees. What made him uncomfortable was the side glances he caught everyone making at his crotch. <br />
Sara was a bigger issue. No women&#39;s underwear could fit her enlarged package, thankfully some of the stands from the caravan came to sell clothing and they found them both something to wear. Sarah wings were in the way at times until Carl stepped in and showed Sara how to dress with wings. &quot;Fold them like so, good. Now pull the shirt over your head like normal but pull the back over the wing and let it find the hole in the back like your arms do with sleeves. Now you&#39;ve got it,&quot; Carl instructed her.<br />
Pants were a little harder problem to solve as most styles did not have the proper dimensions for them. Sara&#39;s tail was so wide that even if a hole was made for it, it would be uncomfortable and possibly chafe some. Until they came to one particular stall. The dark skinned man described his home as a large desert region with large cities that thrived on trade from a number of areas. He motioned to his wares, a collection of items from clothing to tools, weapons to baubles. Sara motioned to some kind of pants she hadn&#39;t seen before that were very baggy. &quot;What are those?&quot; He held them up, &quot;these are called harem pants. Comfortable and they don&#39;t hinder your movement. But they may not be suited for this climate. If I had known how it was here I wouldn&#39;t have come.&quot;<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve gotten used to the cold here so that won&#39;t be a problem. I&#39;d like to buy one to try out,&quot; said Vect.<br />
&quot;These are actually an eastern version. There are others if these don&#39;t suffice.&quot;<br />
They made the transaction, with the vendor giving them a discount to get rid of his stock, Vect ran to his bunk to change. The strangest part was the ankle straps, but they helped the legs keep close to his skin instead of flapping every direction with every step he took. He ran back to his friends who were still looking at the stall, Jack examining a curved sword, the vendor called a kopesh. &quot;These feel great. A little cold, but I can make these work,&quot; he explained as he took a fighting stand and gave a few experimental kicks and side steps to show he wasn&#39;t being hindered. &quot;I&#39;ll take a few more pairs,&quot; said Vect. Hearing this, the vendor brightened up at the prospect of selling something.<br />
&quot;Me too if you&#39;ve got some in my size,&quot; chimed in Sara. <br />
&quot;May I suggest this for the lady if you want something special,&quot; he held up a pair of light blue pants and bikini top. Gold designs like leaves covered the bra portion  pelvis area of the pants and part of the legs. The legs were see through save the pelvic area that was thicker and opaque. It looked like a dancer&#39;s outfit. &quot;Just for a special occasion,&quot; he added. <br />
Sara looked at them, &#39;gods they look beautiful. But I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll have a chance to wear them here.&#39;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take some like my friend did. That&#39;s it.&quot;<br />
He nodded, &quot;and what do you think of that sword.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take it,&quot; Jack smiled. <br />
After making their purchases, Vect left of get ready for tomorrow. Jack tagged along to help, and Beverly and Carl needed to go and prepare tonight&#39;s dinner. Sara made sure she was alone and headed back to the stand. &quot;Those clothes, could you alter them slightly?&quot;<br />
He looked suprised she came back, &quot;yeah I can make alterations to any clothing if necessary, what do you need?&quot;<br />
Sara shifted slightly, &quot;I need you to make so this can fit out the back,&quot; she held up her tail, &quot;and the top to fit around these,&quot; she flapped her wings,&quot; and... one last thing.&quot;<br />
&quot;Of course, you&#39;ve been my only customers this whole sordid venture.&quot;<br />
&quot;Can you make the crotch area a little roomier?&quot;<br />
&quot;May I ask why, if it isn&#39;t too much.&quot;<br />
Sara looked left and right then, &quot;I have a slight.....problem and need the extra room.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll need some dimensions to make the adjustments. Sorry. I know it may be a bit much.&quot;<br />
&quot;Can you visualize it?&quot;<br />
&quot;From just looking once? Of course otherwise I&#39;ll give up my vocation right now.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok, here I go,&quot; Sara pulled up her dress to show her member to the vendor, who after a brief moment he nodded and asked, &quot;for a special someone?&quot;<br />
Sara remained motionless.<br />
&quot;I can have it in 2 days. I&#39;ll be discrete. Thank you for your business.&quot;<br />
&#39;Maybe I&#39;ll work up the courage to put on a show for Vect.&#39; Sara smiled to herself as she left to talk to Carl about flying lessons.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Vect and Jack headed to the training field to test out Jack&#39;s new sword. <br />
&quot;So what exactly happened last night?&quot;<br />
Vect kept his head turned away as he answered looking for a training weapon he wanted to use, &quot;nothing really. We talked and she changed steadily as it progressed.&quot;<br />
&quot;You may fool most here but not me. I know something happened last night. You looked a little tense when you got back, like you were afraid someone saw you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Nothing happened, and even if something did happen, I&#39;m taking it to my grave.&quot; Vect selected a large heavy 2 handed maul and nearly lost his balance when he used too much strength to lift it up. &quot;What the hell! Has someone replaced the training weapons again?&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey what&#39;s wrong,&quot; asked Jack as he came over to help up his fallen friend.<br />
&quot;I expected this to weigh a ton as usual and over estimated the strength I&#39;d need,&quot; Vect lifted up the large hammer over his head and then passed it to Jack. Jack reached for it one handed, and nearly had his arm disconnected as it was yanked down with the maul when Vect let go.<br />
&quot;Jack! Are you ok?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah I&#39;ll be ok,&quot; Jack brushed himself off and paused. &quot;Vect, pick it up. I wanna see something.&quot; Vect bent down and slowly lifted the maul up with both hands, he felt the weight now but lifting it was no problem for him. <br />
&quot;Vect how long have you been able to do that?&quot; <br />
Vect set it down, &quot;not since today. Why?&quot;<br />
Jack took a deep breath, &quot;let me show you what I discovered this morning.&quot; Jack held up his kopesh and drew the blade across his hand, sucking in air through his teeth at the pain.<br />
&quot;Jack what are...you...doing?&quot;<br />
Vect watched as Jack&#39;s blood came out of the cut and then the wound slowly sealed itself up leaving a spot of blood in Jack&#39;s hand with no visible source.<br />
&quot;I was sharpening a knife this morning when I cut myself, it healed up just the same.&quot;<br />
&quot;But why? The only thing that I can think of that&#39;s happened recently is Sara&#39;s.....&quot;<br />
Vect&#39;s eyes narrowed, &quot;you don&#39;t think its because of Sara do you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Maybe not her alone, I&#39;ve never heard of succubi having healing powers.&quot; <br />
&quot;I think we should keep this to ourselves for now. No telling how everyone will react.&quot;<br />
&quot;But what about your fight tomorrow? Are you really going to hold back?&quot;<br />
Vect smiled sadly, &quot;you&#39;re assuming I can actually hit him.&quot;</p>
