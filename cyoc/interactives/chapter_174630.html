<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Right before it reached, Jeff snapped back to her senses and quickly pulled her hand away. That was too close. A few seconds longer and she would have started masturbating. But it didn&#39;t settle down or end her ever building arousal. If anything, it just made her even hornier. Knowing a single wall seperated her family from her, and that all it took was a simple noise to bring one of them around to look for her, was just too stimulating. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, I don&#39;t know if I should be aroused even more or concerned that my husband&#39;s idea of a perfect wife is one that gets aroused by the risk of being caught masturbating by one of our kids. Haha, damn it Mike&quot; Jeff said while giving a halfhearted laugh to herself. She quickly respun her clothes to fit her better, using her webs as easy as if it was second nature to her already. Quickly, a fancy lace loincloth looking garmet had been fashioned and wrapped around her waist to cover her puasy. She made a quick top that was just big enough to cover her boobs, but not much else. Clothing still felt way too restrictive for her. Having gone years without wearing them had made it currently a challemge to suddenly 180 that lifestyle and get comfortable wearing them. She took a deep breath and returned to the table, where a chair no longer existed for her to use. Not that she could use one. Standing next to her husband, Jeff felt a sudden comfortable feeling wash over her. A warmth knowing she had a complete family now. <br />
<br />
They all continued eating for a while. Jeff found that she still enjoied it, even though it mostly was normally would not have been her choice of food. She rather would have gladly prepared them something. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, it seems I know how to cook pretty well&quot; thought Jeff as she continued to searched through her new memories.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt a chill and looked over towards her stepson. Internally she let out a sympathetic sigh. The boy was stuck staring at her chest, again. She couldn&#39;t blame him entirely though for doing so, as her top was quite strained to contain them as it was. The cool air confirmed that the lower half of her breasts were exposed, and likely was forming quite the sight. &quot;I&#39;m sorry that your new Mom is so bad at wearing clothing, but please stop staring&quot; Jeff both appoloized and begged for in her head, hoping he wouldn&#39;t get the wrong idea.<br />
<br />
On the other side of the table, David was struggling. On one hand, his stepmother was terrifying, but on the other, she was extremely hot. In the past few days a since she had fully moved in with them after the wedding, had taught David what exactly is a fear boner. However he was trying his hardest not to upset her. He didnt realize though that as he tried to distract himself in his head, his eyes were staring directly at his stepmother&#39;s breasts. <br />
<br />
David had arachnophobia, but didn&#39;t want anyone else to know. For the most part, this had never once caused an issue. But now it was an almost daily occurrence. Slowly he was getting use to it, but now she was giving him strange looks. When dinner was over, David went upstairs and hid in his room to unwind a bit, while Katie just stayed at the table and watched TV. Mike and Jeff had gone into their own bedroom as well to &quot;talk&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mike, you need to speak with him about this&quot; said Jeff as she finished uncovering Mike&#39;s cock which she then took into her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dont worry honey. The kid is just getting use to you is all. Did you know that he had at one point almost crippling arachnophobia? Back then, a spider 2 rooms over would keep him up at night. Now he can sit across from you and have a normal dinner.&quot; Said Mike while enjoying his wife&#39;s blowjob, that was abruptly cut short as Jeff quickly had left the room and headed towards her office. Once there, she booted up the Chronivac and erased David&#39;s arachnophobia completely. She checked over her own profile quickly too, and made a change to her name, setting it to Jenna, before quickly closing the program and returning to her bedroom. &quot;Sorry, I forgot to send something in for work, but it is all taken care of now&quot; she lied. Lucky for her Mike didn&#39;t care and just let things resume where they left off. <br />
<br />
David, who was still in his room, suddenly no longer feared his stepmother in the slightest, and was now wondering just what had been so scary about her.</p>
