<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary was happy that the triplets had on occasion trusted Mary to look after their <br />
daughters. At least they acknowledge Mary's sense of responsibility. And of course... there <br />
was Ulysses. He felt no shame or humiliation at getting tutor tips from a girl around six <br />
years his minor. Mary had enjoyed fantasies of him being a Leoman so she took take him <br />
as her Prime Mate when she turned eighteen. <br />
<br />
She wondered 'Now that Kurse is gone... does that mean the game can be used safely <br />
now?'  At the same time however, 'That thing, it killed Elise and Fox... and... I just want <br />
this to be all over.. Ulysses is my best friend! Weather we're the same species or not!' <br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like you'll be meeting with Trevor at school by yourself Mary.&quot; One of Martha's <br />
head said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; The eldest of the four dark female cubs said, &quot;Can she stay here? Please? I, we don't <br />
want her to go!&quot;<br />
<br />
In all her life, Mary had never once heard Moja, 'little miss woman' herself, sound like that. <br />
She looked sympathetically at Miss Omega-Martha.<br />
<br />
The shiva-she-wolf said, &quot;It's... it's not my choice to make... if Brian and Felicity are awake <br />
right now, you can ask them... if not, you're to go to school as normal...&quot; She'd have <br />
normally just gone straight to Mother Glen on this matter, after all Mary was a member of <br />
the Pride after all. However Mother Glen was having apparently a reunion with a very dear <br />
friend and Martha was left with a contradiction there to her normal maid creeds. <br />
<br />
Mary nodded, and hugged each of her half sisters before running off towards the medical <br />
wing. <br />
<br />
The pups meanwhile, stood in shock and confusion and looked at each other not sure <br />
what to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. P, can you please take the pups to the dinning room for breakfast?&quot; Martha asked her <br />
and Ryan's hands full with the grieving pride cubs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Omega-Martha.&quot; Mr. P said, and looked at the pups, &quot;They'll catch up, come <br />
along, now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay and Pence looked at each other and followed along their tails low. Giselle and Gretchen <br />
gave Nane one more hug before coming along and one last look at their mother. Laura and <br />
Zulema hugged each other and they followed along. Toni and Paula gave Sita a hug before <br />
loyally following. <br />
<br />
Kevin and Marcy were very confused at what was going on, what they did get was that the <br />
two sets of similar looking cubs were very very unhappy and there was nothing the seven <br />
year old pups could do about it.  Alice and Abbey were already at the dinning room via the <br />
mirror world. As for Bart and Jenny, the two were hit again with how stupid and selfish <br />
their stunt with the 'extra' omegas really was.  Jenny and the gold pups didn't even <br />
exchange rivalry glares as they practically marched down to breakfast.<br />
<br />
++++<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It was like time stopped. Gillie looked around confused, everything seemed to be in slow <br />
motion. Or maybe her new brain chemistry was driving her mad. <br />
<br />
A little lupman pup with fur as white and snow but with marks as red as blood covered her <br />
body like brush strokes. She also looked like she had just finished a morning bath. She <br />
was sitting in a chair in the main entry wall looking at a scroll. Gillie noted the cuts at the <br />
tips of her fingers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Because... &quot; Amy's said calm and even like a maiden giving spiritual advice, &quot;Starting a <br />
blood feud, over the crime committed by a man already dead, is not civilized. And thus <br />
not the Leoman way. It's part of the condition of their transform that every Leoman born of <br />
the power of 'mutual love' be civilized. Reality rules there must a reason for this, and thus <br />
the Leoman mentally is much greater removed from the mentality of their unevolved <br />
cousins than that of humans or Lupmen or Felmen or Dragons. Since your curse prevents <br />
your mind or memories from ever being altered, you are effectively the least civilized <br />
Leoman currently in existence.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gillie shivered remembering when at the peak of Kurse's game seeking to spread to every <br />
human on Earth he had been turned into a penis tentacle squid man thing... still <br />
completely with his own mind intact... She was VERY glade that had been only a few <br />
minutes... <br />
<br />
&quot;You... you're that weird pup girl from day before yesterday... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe I introduced myself as Amy... since you are cursed so your mind never adapts to <br />
existence's changes, I felt it was proper that you be told the answer to your question <br />
sooner than later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what are you? A witch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Not in the least. Any pallor tricks I am able to pull off don't come from 'magic' as <br />
witches would define it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am fairly certain I am the reincarnation of a miko who begged for peace during the <br />
second world war, and died when the bomb was dropped. Beyond that, I think I am not <br />
supposed to know. Penny for a while held onto her memories as Penn, and managed to <br />
write down precious amounts of them... but now those memories are gone. She is simply <br />
another lioness. Though she is aware of her power to restore victims of the game, but they <br />
shall always be Leoman after she's done so. For me on the other hand, for a little while  <br />
more at least, Ryan remains yet another previous life... Maybe Zelipe and I will be husband <br />
and wife in our next lives...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;-believe in reincarnation, I know, I'm getting sick of people saying that as a reaction. I <br />
simply felt you had a right to know Gillie-San. Your grandfather is waiting...&quot; <br />
<br />
Time started up again if it had ever stopped and Amy was walking along to the dinning <br />
room along with other wolves who were stuck sleeping, looking after the infirm, or <br />
recovering. <br />
<br />
Gillie sighed yet again, feeling a big bad headache coming on. 'Why... why do things <br />
always have to be so bloody complicated! I know you're going as fast as you can Serenity <br />
but please! Let's get this game dead already!'<br />
<br />
Gillie walked into the room, not even glancing at the naked wolf people and little naked <br />
wolf children as a naked wolf woman with a sun fur pattern and one with a moon fur <br />
pattern bringing in trays of meat for everyone to dig in. <br />
<br />
He saw her before she saw him. A leoman with copper fur just likes hers with a brass <br />
mane. He was at least two feet taller than her at eleven feet! He was built like a tank, even <br />
when compared to the other Leoman Gillie had seen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is it you.&quot; He said.<br />
<br />
She turned to him in shock and surprise. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is it really you? I can smell it but please tell me first... is your name, your name Gillie <br />
Daleson?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gillie looked at the Leoman silent for several seconds as silence fell in the dinning room. <br />
Instead of answering, &quot;Is your name Gillian II Daleson?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That is my name.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gillie let it all go. &quot;GRANDPA!&quot;  She leapt and hugged him, misjudged her own strength and <br />
tackled into him making him hit the floor. <br />
<br />
&quot;OOF! Gillie! I-I'm so happy to meet you! I-I'm just so happy! Gillie! You're as beautiful as <br />
your great-grandmother!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gillie did her best to ignore that but continued to hug him, &quot;You're alive, it's, I'm so glade <br />
to finally meet you! I tried to find you! I really did! But I never could! I'm so sorry!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's nothing to be sorry for! I'll trust that you did your best!&quot; Gillian hugged back. <br />
<br />
A giant snow white lioness on all fours trotted over and licked Gillie behind the ear, &quot;Yes <br />
dear.&quot; She whispered, &quot;Your grandfather is with us again, we're a family again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gillie shuddered, and looked. 'This woman?... But why? This animal? How is this possible?' <br />
Gillie fainted. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Trevor and Sabrina were dropped off at school by their mother Marie without a hitch that <br />
morning. The two children having no idea that the pride had lost two of it's members in <br />
the One-Day-War two days ago. <br />
<br />
Four boys came over to Trevor at once, three were Leoman cubs like him. One was a <br />
human lad who had a nice smile and was perfectly friendly, but in his mind was thinking, <br />
'Glade to have him back. He's very useful.' He would be diagnosed as having lack of <br />
empathy issues by middle school. But he was able to play act emotions well enough. <br />
<br />
All four boys hugged their friend, though the human lad had to stand on his tip being big <br />
shorter than the rest of them. <br />
<br />
The three new leoman cubs were the ones Trevor had called the other day about his return <br />
home. They had already unwittingly converted their families into their 'new' species. Their <br />
parents meanwhile would chat to their friends about daily troubles and maybe one of their <br />
children's friends apparently coming back from the dead and convert them as well. The <br />
three's siblings would also interact with their friends, who would convert their families. <br />
<br />
Sabrina meanwhile greeted one of her friends before heading into class, the girl greeted <br />
her without so much as a eye-blink. <br />
<br />
The girl's blond pigtails would vanish, leaving her utterly as baled as Sabrina. Bronze <br />
colored fur would covered her body as her mini-skirt and pink velcro shoes would vanish <br />
along with the rest of her clothes. She'd gain several inches as muscles grew underneath <br />
her furry skin. Her tail would grow from her rear and wave about like a tassel, still learning <br />
how to NOT knock it into things when distracted which some had tried to use as an excuse <br />
to get her on medication for ADD. The sparkle flower stick on her face remained even as <br />
she grew a short muzzle and her eyes became as gray as stone. Of course she kept her <br />
backpack, she didn't have a pocket universe to keep her stuff after all.  The two little <br />
leoman girl giggled and chatted as they headed to class.<br />
<br />
None of the teachers changed, as Gill and his men had shown, the love of a  'leader' and <br />
those that followed didn't count as the right kind of love for the changes to trigger. <br />
<br />
By the time of pick up, all of Sabrina's friends would have changed species, who soon after <br />
they were picked up by their parents would change to the new rising species as well (save <br />
one unlucky girl who was considered a business investment rather than a child to her <br />
parents). <br />
<br />
Both Marie and Amy had figured it would take a thousand years for the complete <br />
conversion of all people on Earth, question was if that took into account the exponential <br />
rate of changes. Then again, there was the question of cultural and national borders <br />
holding back a complete conversion not to mention how many would actually chose to <br />
leave Glendale to seek their fortune or love elsewhere. <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
The little witchling thought, 'Of course 'Jack' wasn't the member of his line that would <br />
become the ripper, and his prophecy was wrong, it wasn't one of his male heirs who would <br />
become the most horrid on-hands murderer of a century...'  But Glass Marie's audience <br />
had request she side step this particular course of events. <br />
<br />
1681 fall. <br />
<br />
&quot;They're all dead now...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What are all dead now Kathrine?&quot; Asked one of the other women in the room as she <br />
looked up from her book. <br />
<br />
&quot;The dodos, they're all dead... they were such silly birds... and now they're all gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A bird called a 'dodo?' That's making that up! All gone? Count on a cat to lie. Pst! That's <br />
impossible! Things don't just die out! You're being silly, as normal, then again, you said <br />
they were silly, just like you, so I guess it makes sense you'd sympathize with them in all <br />
nine of your lives.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathrine said managing to smile as was expected of her by her family, &quot;Only Marie is <br />
allowed to say that to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nine lives, nine lives.&quot; The woman barely any older than Marie replied. <br />
<br />
Kathrine fought the urge to frown. <br />
<br />
&quot;And how would you know that anyway? Some stupid cat told you? If that's what you want <br />
to talk to then you should drink milk off the floor and make room for  PEOPLE.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot; Kathrine nodded keeping her smile. <br />
<br />
Said another teenage girl to the first looking eager to spread interesting news, &quot;Did ya <br />
hear? Some woman got flogged in england for trespassing in politics!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you start making such things up too. No woman would ever get involved in <br />
something so man-like!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Marie!&quot; Said the second teenage girl, &quot;You were in London right earlier this year! Did <br />
you see the flogging? Tell Abigail I'm not making this up!&quot;<br />
<br />
 Marie didn't look up from the book she was reading, she had her 'blind' eye to them <br />
anyway. <br />
<br />
&quot;You think she didn't hear me?&quot; The second girl asked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;She's blind in one eye, not deaf dummy.&quot; Abigail replied.<br />
<br />
Marie looked out the window, almost sunset, 'Can't come soon enough.' Her father had <br />
promised it wasn't blood hungry corpses they were going to be exterminating (Marie <br />
preferred not to have to fight those), so Marie distracted herself by guessing at the <br />
possible targets: 'Another Zoophilia on the run maybe?'</p>
