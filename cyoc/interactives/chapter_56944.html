<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Slowly Brian made his way down the street, his mind mixed up as he realised that his thoughts where slowly shifting as well and that he was having more and more thoughts that he was sure would be common for a sixteen year old girl. And just to test the theory, he silently began to ask himself question he was sure that only a girl would know, surprised at how easily some of the answers came to him.<br />
<br />
Behind him, the car continued to follow and after a moment, the woman inside rolled down the window on the driver side and leaning out, she called out, &quot;Aimee.&quot;<br />
<br />
To his surprise, Brian found himself turning, sure that this woman was calling for him. And then he shook his head, telling himself that his name was Brian, not Aimee and that it was only coincidence and shock, nothing more, which made him turn and nearly respond to the woman in the black car.<br />
<br />
And then he did respond by explaining, &quot;Wrong person,&quot; hating how feminine his voice sounded.<br />
<br />
The woman pulled even and stopping the car, she opened the passenger door and looking at Brian, who was standing with his arms crossed, weight supported on one foot, looking like a sixteen year old girl. After a moment, she said, &quot;I think I know what is happening to you and I can offer an explanation. But you must first get into the car and come with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure, suddenly hesitant and being really fearful, Brian asked, &quot;How can I trust you?&quot;<br />
<br />
A pained look crossed the woman's face and then she said, &quot;Because I am your, Aimee's mom. And Aimee is my daughter. And it is mine, my husband's and a couple friend's fault as to why you look like her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Backing up, Brian asked, &quot;You turned me into your daughter?&quot;<br />
<br />
A nod and the woman said, &quot;If you get in and come with me, I can explain everything. But, you have to trust me,&quot; and then she sat back, looking at Brian, waiting for him to make a decision.<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Half an hour later, Brian found himself sitting in the car, listening to the Hydrem engine silently purr, watching as the forest slowly slid past as the woman drove them down what looked like it might have been a logging path. The journey up until this point had passed in silence, something Brian was glad for, and casting a surreptitious glance at the woman, he realised that he felt comfortable next to her, almost as if she could be his mother and he, her daughter.<br />
<br />
Looking forward, Brian thought this ridiculous as a large, three-story house came into view. Next to him, the woman smiled as she put the car in neutral, telling him, &quot;Nathan apparently is home yet. Would you like something to eat while we wait or would you like to look about?&quot; as she turned off the car<br />
<br />
Brian, uncomfortable with all that had happened to him and to top it off that he was having more and more problems thinking of himself in the pronouns of he and him, responded that he wanted to look about and opening the passenger door, he stepped out and looked at the house, a feeling of being in a familiar and safe location, creeping over his mind. Next to him, the woman asked, &quot;Would you like me to show you where Aimee’s bedroom is?&quot; to which Brian shook his head and muttered he knew where it was, which disturbed him because he did.<br />
<br />
Strolling away from the car, the thought of taking a shower and getting into something fresh crossed Brian's mind and he smiled at such a comforting notion as he stepped up onto the porch.<br />
<br />
Crossing the threshold of the front door, Brian barely took in any of the foyer, knowing where everything was. Behind him, he registered that the woman was talking on a cellphone, but choose not to pay attention as he continued forward, taking in the open room that was past the foyer that served as both a living room, television room and a place to entertain guests.<br />
<br />
As he started moving toward a flight of stairs going up, knowing automatically which room was belonged to Aimee, the woman explained, &quot;Nathan is working late and will be home around nine. Would you like to wait? If not, I am sure I can tell you a fair bit of what and why this has happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian shook her head, and immediately replied, &quot;I think I will go up and lay down for a bit. Maybe take a shower,&quot; as she started up the stairs.<br />
<br />
Nodding, the woman told her, &quot;If you need anything, just give a holler. Dinner will be at whatever time you come down and feel like having a bite. I left Aimee’s room the way she left it six months ago, with the exception of minour cleaning.&quot; and then, turning, she started to make her way across the living room, Brian watching her as she opened the patio-door and disappeared out onto a deck.<br />
<br />
Gazing up the stairs, Brian took a deep breath and continued up. At the top, he was greeted by the sight of five doors, but knew exactly which one belonged to Aimee and moving down the hall, passing what he knew to be a bathroom, two guest rooms and Aimee’s parent's room, Brian stopped at a door, hesitant about entering. After a moment, he pushed open the door, taking in the girl's room on the other side.<br />
<br />
The first thing that caught Brian's eye was the mirror directly across from, reflecting back what he was now sure to be Aimee Foxhoven. Blinking, Brian closed the door, taking in the white walls, the bed with the light-purple comforter, knowing the sheets underneath were light-blue with dots. Next he took in the two dressers, one long and the other tall, the vanity and the door he knew went to a walk-in closet and allowed private access to the bathroom via a back hallway.<br />
<br />
Walking over to the closet, Brian opened it and stepped inside. After a moment, he clicked on the light and looked about, taking in the clothes, coats and other items placed neatly on the shelves. After a moment, he reached down and grasping the hem of the sweatshirt, he pulled it up and over her head. Next, she removed her sweatpants, and tossing them into the laundry hamper, Brian remembered how his grandparents had brought them back, along with a couple items, as a gift from their holiday in Britain, Ireland and Scotland.<br />
<br />
Naked, Brian looked about the closet and after a couple moments, she automatically selected a two towels, a wash-clothe, a sponge, body wash, facial wash, shampoo and conditioner and moving across the closet, she opened the door and began to make her way toward the bathroom, her mind in a right state about what was happening to her and what had happened and what was surely to come.</p>
