<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dinner was tasty and Henry approved of the wine as well. Henry did not eat as much as he normally would have. Probably because his stomach was so squeezed by the corset.<br />
<br />
Alicia made the comment “I should have done you nails as well. I didn’t start early enough”<br />
<br />
“Lucky me” said Henry. <br />
<br />
“Well it would have completed the effect. You just look so sexy”<br />
<br />
“You are supposed to find the old me sexy, not the drag queen you have turned me into”<br />
<br />
“I find both versions of you sexy. Especially your normal version”<br />
<br />
“Even the short-ass version I’ve been this last week?”<br />
<br />
“Even your short-ass version”<br />
<br />
“I’ll be happy to get my height back”<br />
<br />
“Yeah and I’ll be happy when things are back to normal as well, but I must admit it has been fun to tower over everyone” <br />
<br />
“I haven’t particularly enjoyed feeling short”<br />
<br />
“You’re not actually short you know. I was well above average height for a woman. Lots of men are shorter than you are now”<br />
<br />
“I’m just not tall anymore. And I’m used to being taller than most people in the room”<br />
<br />
“Well just consider yourself lucky you didn’t swap heights with someone really small. Imagine if you had married Harriet (one of Alicia’s bridesmaids). She’s only 5 foot. Lucky you didn’t swap heights with her or you would know all about being short”<br />
<br />
“Yes, it’s hard to imagine being that small” Harriet was not only short. She was skinny as well.<br />
<br />
“Another glass of wine?”<br />
<br />
“I’ll have to open the second bottle. I ordered some desserts as well. Do you know where they are?”<br />
<br />
“That must be what went into the fridge. I’ll dish it out, while you get the wine”<br />
……..<br />
After the meal Alicia wanted to do Karaoke once more. Henry got You-tube up on the TV and they tried a few songs. Singing in their own voices was fun but they could not create the magic of the other night when they had exchanged voices. After a song each and a version of ‘Islands in the stream’ together, Alicia suggested they just select a song they could slow dance to.<br />
<br />
Henry found himself with his head resting against Alicia’s shoulder and feeling his breasts pressed against her torso while Alicia enjoyed wrapping her arm around Henry’s narrow corset bound waist. They rocked gently backwards and forwards to a series of songs.<br />
<br />
Henry lowered his arms so they were wrapped around Alicia’s wide hips and the leather skirt. He felt his penis try to push into her but thanks to the heels she was wore, his penis was only at the height of her mid thighs. <br />
<br />
“Let’s make out on the couch” Alicia said and led him over to the settee. There she sat and pulled Henry onto her lap. “Now I can see your pretty face” she told him before embarking on a long slow kiss. She enjoyed the thought of kissing Henry’s made up face. She regretted not applying flavoured lipstick to him. Maybe she might get another chance? As she kissed her left hand found Henry’s ample bust and located his nipple. She felt it harden. Then with her other hand she reached for his fly, unzipped it and felt for his member. It was very easy to find.<br />
<br />
She exited the kiss and said to him “I’ll prove that I can do two things at once” So with her left hand she gently massaged his right breast and with her right hand released Mister Marvellous from his confines so that he peeped out of Henry’s fly, standing to attention. “Lucky you” she said in a sultry voice. “You have all the responsive bits”<br />
<br />
Henry didn’t reply. He was just enjoying the experience of getting his breasts and his penis fondled at the same time.<br />
<br />
Soon Alicia had undone Henry’s belt and pushed both his trousers and boxers down below his knees. Her fingers were massaging both his penis and his balls. She knew exactly how much she could stimulate him without him blowing his load.“I think we need to move to the bedroom Honey” Alicia told him.  She was ready to receive him.<br />
<br />
Henry took the opportunity to remove his shoes and socks so that his lower half was totally naked as he followed the Amazon into the bedroom.<br />
<br />
Alicia waited for Henry to enter the bedroom. She had turned on the light so she had a good view of him. His make-up was slightly smudged but he still looked totally a woman from the waist up. Below the lace top his penis was standing up 30 degrees from the horizontal.<br />
<br />
She faced him, still wearing her heels. “I think you need to help me out of this skirt” She indicated the row of buttons down the front of her black leather skirt.<br />
<br />
There were six large buttons so Henry moved forward and undid them from the bottom up. After 4 he got a view of the tops of the stockings and the straps from the garter belt that held them up. After 5 he got a view of the G-string panties. Alicia stopped him as he moved to the top button. “Actually, Get down on your knees for the last one”<br />
<br />
Henry did so. As soon as he had released the last button the skirt fell to the floor.  Alicia, still in her heels, took a step closer to him. Kneeling, Henry was just the right height for what Alicia wanted. She put a hand on the back of his blonde head and pushed his face into her crotch. She said two final words. “Eat me”<br />
<br />
Henry did so willingly. His tongue had to work around her G-string but soon he was licking her moisture out. It didn’t take long before he felt her muscles spasm. She moaned. <br />
<br />
That was the cue for Henry to stand up and push her back onto the bed. Very soon he was on top of her and still with his feminine upper body thrusting into Alicia.<br />
<br />
Alicia lay back and temporarily satiated, enjoyed watching Henry&#39;s tits wobble as he thrust into her.  His hair was all mussed up by now but that didn’t matter. He still looked to be a woman, better yet a woman with a penis. She felt another wave of tremors in herself just as Henry squirted into her.</p>
