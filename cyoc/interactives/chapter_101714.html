Wednesday proved to bee quite the day for the various families of Moon Lake. Thanksgiving was tomorrow, and people were out and about, scrambling to prepare. <br />
<br />
In the Anderson house, Martha had woken up at six o’clock, like it was a normal work day. But instead of making breakfast and then making sure her sons were awake, she started cooking. Most of what she needed to get done today was the baking. <br />
<br />
When the Anderson men came downstairs, they were greeted by the sight of their matriarch scrambling around the kitchen, with at least three different bowls of some sort of batter going. She was still in her pajamas, with a smeared apron hanging from her shoulders. <br />
<br />
“Uh, morning Mom.” Nate said, afraid to get in her way. She was a woman possessed. <br />
<br />
“Oh, morning. Do you think you could give me a hand and stir that?” Martha said, totally preoccupied in what she was doing. Nate didn’t argue, just sprang into action. Eric and William started picking up used dishes, and putting them into the sink while Nate stirred whatever was in the bowl. <br />
<br />
“How long have you been up dear?” William asked, placing a dirty baking sheet in their sink.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know, what time is it?” <br />
<br />
“Close to nine thirty.” William said, worried his wife had spent the entire morning cooking. And while everything did smell great, it wasn’t worth Martha pulling he hair out. <br />
<br />
“Then I’ve been up for about three and a half hours.”<br />
<br />
“Okay. Why don’t you take a break? I’m sure Eric can take over for you. He knows what he’s doing.” William looked pointedly at Eric.<br />
<br />
“Huh? Oh ya, I can handle this. You finished making the pie crusts, and most of the fillings. I can do the rest Mom.” Eric said quickly. He jumped into action, taking the bowl from Nate who gladly resigned to the living room. <br />
<br />
William didn’t give Martha a chance to protest, just takes her aside. They sit down in the living room, and William takes the initiative to ask Nate how his evening with Kenya was.<br />
<br />
“Great! Really great.” Nate said. <br />
<br />
“You talked to her about things?” William asked. Nate nodded, and gave a light version of their conversation. Excluding the bits about the two one day getting married of course, but he told his mom and dad how they both agreed to move at a pace they were both okay with.<br />
<br />
“I’m glad to hear it. So, we’ll still be seeing her for dinner tomorrow?”<br />
<br />
“Definitely. Though she did say she wouldn’t be able to make it to the football game. Going over to see her aunt and uncle before they go to a relative’s in Yakima” Nate said. <br />
<br />
“Her parents are…”<br />
<br />
“They passed away a number of years ago. They had her fairly late in life, even for weres. Her aunt and uncle are the only immediate family in the area.” Nate said.<br />
<br />
“I see. Is she a student around here? You said she was older…” Martha asked. <br />
<br />
Nate swallowed and said she was working right now. His parents could see that he wasn’t telling them the whole story, but again decided to wait to pass judgment. But their curiosity was certainly building. <br />
<br />
“Hey, can someone give me a hand! Like, say, a ten foot tall werewolf who can reach the top shelf?” Eric called. <br />
<br />
“Guess that’s my cue.” Nate said. He walked into the kitchen, relieved his brother called for him when he did. Nate didn’t think he’d be able to field too many questions like that for too long. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
At the hospital, Spencer was finishing getting ready to leave. After the last round of x-rays, she’d been cleared to heal at home for the next few days. <br />
<br />
“You should be able to go back to school come Monday. I wouldn’t shift until then though, just to be on the safe side.” Dr. Henderson advised her. <br />
<br />
Spencer was glad to be out of that place. Stuck in the hospital for the three days, two of which she was pretty much strapped to the bed, was a new kind of torture. <br />
<br />
Evan pulled his jeep around to the backdoor, so Spencer could slip out while still in her fursona. <br />
<br />
“Is that everything?” Evan asked when he saw his daughter and wife in the stairwell. Spencer was carrying one backpack, and was wearing the largest sweatshirt he’d ever seen. Another equally gigantic sweatshirt was tied around her waist. <br />
<br />
Pants were kinda an impossibility, as were underwear. Not that Spencer really cared. She’d just spent three days with nothing but one of those uncomfortable hospital gowns on. And even then, it didn’t fit right given her size. <br />
<br />
“Yup.” Spencer said, popping the P with her lips. Maggie gave both a kiss, and said she’d see them later. She still had work to do. Evan and Spencer left, with Spencer lying down in the back. Evan had folded the backseats down earlier, which gave Spencer enough room without feeling claustrophobic. <br />
<br />
“So, what’s the plan for today?” Spencer asked, sticking her head forward a bit so she could see her dad’s face. <br />
<br />
“You mom has to stay at the hospital until late tonight, putting in hours so she can take tomorrow off. I’m going to Seattle with a couple guys from the base.” Evan said. <br />
<br />
He didn’t enjoy just going out and idly drinking. Two Bud-Lights over a three hour time period, that was his “wild night out”. <br />
<br />
“Should have known, you love being the party pooper on Blackout Wednesday.” Spencer snickered. She’s never tell her father, but she’d partaken in a few blackout parties herself in the past. Granted she never got wasted, but she didn’t stop herself from having a good time. <br />
<br />
“Does this mean you’re going to chain me to a wall, or put a tracking collar on me?” <br />
<br />
“I thought I already told you I’m going to try and not be so suffocating.” <br />
<br />
“Tigers can’t change their stripes. They can paint over them, but they’re still there.” <br />
<br />
“I don’t have stripes, that would be your uncle.” Evan pointed out. <br />
<br />
“It’s a metaphor Dad.” <br />
<br />
“I know. Scouts honor, no chains, collars, or handcuffs. Provided you promise to behave.” Evan winked. Spencer smiled and pulled her head back. But not before licking her dad’s cheek. <br />
<br />
“Spencer!” he exclaimed. <br />
<br />
“Sorry, cats can’t kiss, and neither can dogs.” <br />
<br />
Evan wiped the saliva from his face, smiling, and then  focused on driving. He started to slow when he realized he was driving past the Anderson and Twist houses. Both families appeared to be awake. <br />
<br />
He kept going though, but made a mental note to call them when he got home. He’d be going out later, and if Eric was there Spencer was less likely to get into trouble. <br />
<br />
“We really should have gotten her tested when she was younger.” Evan thought. As smart as Spencer was, she certainly had a knack for getting herself in trouble. At least with Eric with her Evan could rest easy knowing his daughter wouldn’t burn the house down.</p>
