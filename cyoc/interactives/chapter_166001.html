<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty enjoyed the following silence, as well as the feeling of power, for a few more minutes. Dustin wouldn´t be a problem anymore, but after thinking about it Ty got another idea. Yes, Dustin would suffer in the sewers for a few days. Ty wished for Dustin to be trapped in them until he wanted his rat of a foster brother back outside. Dustin would, whenever he was near an exit, be ported somewhere else deeper in the sewers to make sure of that. Afterwards Ty made some notes on what he wanted to do next.<br />
--<br />
Meanwhile Dustin was in panic. Just minutes ago he had been showering, then Ty had used whatever power he had gained now and transformed him into a small, dirty rat, and now he was lost somewhere in the sewers smelling even worse. What could he do now?<br />
When the panic has lifted a bit, so Dustin could think more clearly again, he was quick to decide his first step was to get out of here, to fresher air at least. And maybe once outside he could find a way back home. So he started to move in one direction to find an exit.<br />
--<br />
Ty decided that both Marc and June would remain human. But he wished they would show him the affection the had showed to Dustin, like him as if he was their child by blood. Maybe he would later search for a new, better family, but for now that should help. And if it didn´t work out he could still tweak smaller things before doing anything more drastic.<br />
Before he could enjoy being the only child in the house more, however, the doorbell rang. June let their guests, three of Dustin´s friends in. That made Ty realize that, right now, nobody thought of Dustin as not home. Even if June and Marc would be better to him now, others wouldn´t be.<br />
Ty heard the trio come up the stairs, going over to Dustin´s room. When they didn´t find him there, they came to Ty next. “Hey weakling, where´s Dustin?” asked Alex in an annoyed tone. He was around a head bigger than Dustin had been, with shoulder-long, brown hair, grey eyes with showed a mean gleam, and a built frame. He was sure more muscles than brain, which was one of the reasons for the weakling comment.<br />
The other two boys behind Alex were Colin and Steve. Both had more brain then Alex, but weren´t that much less muscles to him. Colin had short, blond hair, blue eyes and was the same height Dustin had been. He was also the nicest and most curious out of their group. But for whatever reason he didn´t like Ty, maybe it was the influence of the others. Steve had short, brown hair, green eyes and was a bit taller than Dustin and Colin were.<br />
“Oh, he was in the bathroom last time I checked.” Ty answered calmly. While Steve, who was nearest to the bathroom moved to knock, and the other two just stood there in the door, Ty was thinking about his plans and how to fit these three in.<br />
Just as Steve returned, stating that Dustin didn´t answer, Ty made a silent wish for them to come into his room and close the door for some privacy. After they did close the door, Ty grinned at them. “What are you grinning at, shrimp?” Colin asked. “Oh nothing. It´s just that I realized why Dustin isn´t in the bathroom anymore.” Ty half-lied.<br />
The trio didn´t realize they had started to take of their clothes, all thanks to Ty, when Alex replied angry: “And why isn´t he there, weakling?” By now the only remaining cloth on them was their underwear, which Ty didn´t need to be removed right now. It wouldn´t be in the way of seeing them change that much. But maybe next time he would see if he found someone shrinking out of their clothes was as pleasuring as seeing the whole change.<br />
Ty laughed a little as he answered: “I realized earlier that he was nothing but a dirty rat, and so are you. All tiny, smelly rats. And shortly after he disappeared to a location more fitting for him to live.” They looked at him as if he was crazy, and right now it would be right of them to think that. All three started scratching themselves as an unbelievable itch started all over their bodies. Ty watched them getting short fur while they scratched, as well as slowly getting shorter. Each moaned in pain as with a couple of audible cracks their forms shifted, dropping them down on all fours while their faces reformed into a snout. The only things growing bigger while their bodies shrunk were their ears, as well as the newly formed, naked rat-tails above their asses. Another moan of pain came as their fingers merged, reforming their hands into rat fore-paws, while the same applied to their feet, reshaping into rat hind-paws.<br />
It was only a minute, but to each of them it felt like an eternity in pain. Before either could react, Ty had moved over and grabbed them all, pressing Colin into Alex left side and Steve into Alex right one. “You can share Dustin´s fate for now, you little pests.” Ty said with a grin and wished them into the sewers as well. A short extra wish made sure they wouldn´t recognize each other or Dustin down there.<br />
Soon it was four human-minded rats in the sewers, all a bit away from each other, all trapped to remain inside the foul smell for as long as Ty wanted them. And while Alex, Colin and Steve had known that all three of them, as well as the unaware Dustin, where down here, they were completely unable to find each other. Each of the four rats tried to stay away from other rats, both turned and natural, trying to escape the sewers, only to be brought back deeper each time they saw an escape to fresher air.<br />
--<br />
Ty made sure that nobody would look for either of the four missing boys. He planted in everyone´s mind that they run away together some time ago, and that was it. Then Ty enjoyed a week with his now more loving foster parents before setting the next part of their destiny into motion.<br />
“Mum, can I get a pet?” Ty asked June after the week as the only child in the house, while willing it to be accepted. Soon they were at the nearest pet shop, and Ty showed only interest in a small family of rats they had. The father had been sold a couple of days ago, but the mother and her two, around a month-old, children had remained.<br />
Ty used his powers so he got the whole family, together with a nice, big terrarium for them to live in. At home all was built up for the rats to live, and when Ty was alone with them he continued with his plans.</p>
