<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tony struggled with all his now lilliputian might but couldn't even budge the grip of Emma Chase.  She had her right hand around his velvet ballet top, effortlessly holding up 7 inch high Tony. She brought him closer to her face.  For tiny Tony, it was like being inspected by one of the faces on Mt. Rushmore.  <br />
&quot;This is about the relative size of things, isn't it, boy?&quot; she said and laughed heartily.  Jeff's sister Suzy moved in close again, reaching for Tony's doll sized body.  <br />
&quot;Let me see his little rear again&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure&quot; Emma chuckled and Tony saw her giant, malevolent eyes looking at his discomfort with delight.  Jeff's sister Suzy ran the end of her index finger all over the white spandexed surface of Tony's rear and hips, tracing figure eights over Tony's grape sized buns and giggling with delight.  She was only a willowy girl, but her mere index finger had the force of a push from a weight lifter on tiny Tony's ballet tights.  <br />
&quot;I always wanted to do this with his-with his full sized buns but there was like no way an 11 year old girl could like get it on with a boy like Tony&quot;<br />
&quot;See how silly it is to put boys up on pedestals like that or think they're important&quot; Emma cooed to Suzy.  She turned the doll sized Tony around to face her.  &quot;How about his teeny tiny package?&quot; Emma laughed.  Suzy giggled and giggled and then tentatively reached forward.  With one hand, she grabbed Tony's squirming legs and held them together.  With the index finger of the other, she rubbed up and down across the now pea sized bulge at the junction of Tony's legs.  <br />
<br />
Suzy looked a bit disappointed.  She rubbed Tony's tiny package some more.<br />
&quot;Hey!  He's not getting bigger or . . what's the word?&quot;<br />
&quot;Erect&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah.  Nothing's happening&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, boys are crude mechanisms but even boys don't always work like the flip of a switch.  You see, tiny Tony here is probably all scared and maybe angry too&quot;<br />
&quot;He should be&quot; laughed Suzy.  &quot;He's only the size of a doll!&quot;<br />
&quot;You wanna hold him?&quot;<br />
&quot;Can I?&quot; asked Suzy breathlessly.<br />
&quot;Sure&quot; said Emma and she passed 7 inch high Tony to her.  Tony thought he might get a chance to escape but Suzy had her hand over his body from the waist to below his knees before Emma let go of his torso.  As Tony watched with trepidation, Emma went to the laptop and started typing.  Meanwhile, Suzy bent Tony over with the little and ring fingers of her hand.  They pressed against Tony's tiny shoulder blades while her middle finger was in front of his hips and her index finger and thumb pressed against the back of his thighs.  With Tony thus immobilized, she indulged her fixation with his rear end.  Over and over she rubbed his round but tiny ass till Tony was almost painfully sore.<br />
&quot;Leave me alone you big bully!&quot; Tony shouted at Suzy.  But this didn't phase her.  She decided to experiment with her toy.  She put Tony down on the bed and released him but immediately slammed one bulldozer like hand into Tony sending him flying off balance twice the length of his little body.  Just as he was getting to his feet, he got slammed in the butt by her hand again, sending him flying again.  Suzy laughed at the ease with which she manipulated diminutive Tony.  Finally, she tossed Tony into the air.  It seemed to him like he'd been rocketed a hundred feet high.  He windmilled his arms and legs frantically but Suzy caught him just above the bed, the impact of the sudden deceleration being like a body slam to doll sized Tony.<br />
&quot;Okay, put your boy down on the bed&quot;<br />
&quot;What're you gonna do?&quot;<br />
&quot;You'll see&quot; said Emma and Suzy obeyed.  But the instant she did, a quickly recovering Tony ran away from her and toward the laptop.  Emma was a foot or so away from it now but Tony barely had time to place press his entire hands onto the laptop's touch pad before Emma picked him up by the collar of his ballet top.<br />
&quot;See how silly boys are, Suzy?  He had no chance of getting to change from his itty bitty size but he tried to anyway&quot;<br />
&quot;And he's like the smartest one, too!&quot; laughed Suzy.<br />
&quot;And look where it got him?  He's the size of a doll!  Now put him down on that open spot on the sheets and let's have some more fun&quot;<br />
Suzy obeyed and the instant that Tony had been put down he felt his ballet outfit shifting and changing.  As he watched in shock, first his top quickly morphed into the naked and also 7 inch high body of his best friend Jack.  Then, almost as if bursting forward from his waist and crotch, the naked and similarly sized bodies of his friend Felix, brother Mark and girlfriend Claire were lying atop him.  Finally, the naked and similar sized bodies of his friends Jeff and Eric were atop his feet.  <br />
<br />
Everyone scrambled to get off each other and had just done so when all of them, Tony included, started to find the tights, tops and shoes or slippers of male ballet dancers or a ballerina forming on their bodies.  In just a second, Tony found himself attired exactly as he had been before only with his clothes not being the transformed bodies of his friends.  While Claire was attired as a prima ballerina in white tights, tutu, pink top and a tiara, all the boys were dressed exactly like Tony in white tights, only with different colored tops.  Jack's was burgundy velvet.  Mark's was gold.  Felix's was orange.  Jeff's was navy blue and Eric's was green.  Their heights were all in their previous proportion to Tony's.<br />
<br />
Tony thought there were enough of them that they might be able to make a run for it with the confusion that seven of them could create, but Emma and Suzy squeezed them all together into a ball of tiny, ballet attired human beings, with ease.  Emma took out a package of elastics, and to Tony's dismay showed Suzy how she could easily double wrap an elastic around their torsos and trap their arms helplessly at their sides.  Emma first wrapped a rubber band around Tony's arms and ankles and set him aside like a piece of cordwood.  Suzy set all of them aside except for Jeff.  She played with her brother the doll sized human being for over a half hour, not seeming to tire of the delicious irony of her big brother now being such a ridiculously small squirt.  <br />
<br />
Mark shouted angrily at her and Emma.  Felix complained politely to Emma &quot;I never did anything to you!  I tried to help you!  I wanted to help you.  Why should you do this to me and my friends?&quot;<br />
Emma just laughed &quot;You've attained your true stature in life.  Why fight it or plead with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Because it was getting late, Suzy took all her fascinating new dolls and stuffed them into her 2 story, 30 inch high Barbie Malibu beach house.  With Emma's help, she crazy glued shut all the doors and windows except for one front and one back door and she used elastics to tie those doors shut.<br />
<br />
As Tony watched from his stomache, still bound with elastics on the living room floor of Barbie's Malibu beach house, Emma turned off the laptop and took it away with her.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Great.  Even if we can get out of here, the laptop's not here and we're 6 or 7 inches high, just to make travel even harder&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm sorry&quot; said an almost tearful Felix bound and lying right next to Tony in the toy beach house's living room.  On the other side of Tony was Claire, her white tighted legs rubbing against Tony's and once he realized it was her, he found it a bit exciting.  <br />
<br />
As the lights went out, he shouted to the other four on the floor above them.  &quot;Are you guys okay?  Mark? Jeff?  Eric?  Jack?&quot;<br />
One by one they grumbled in the affirmative.  They were all working at their humiliating rubber band bonds, but Tony, who'd had the most time at them, was first.  He gradually worked the elastic around his torso up and over his shoulders.  He sat up and quickly worked the other elastic over his feet and was free.  He freed Claire and then Felix and they went upstairs to the Barbie Malibu beach house bedrooms to free the others.<br />
<br />
But even now free to move about, they couldn't get out of the beach house.  The windows were crazy glued shut and the two doors bound with elastics were immovable.  Even as tiny as they were, they couldn't slip out the slivers of openings they could create when all of them pushed at once.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Great.  I'm stuck in a dollhouse.  I think there's some humiliating Ibsen or Todd Solondz message to this but there's something humiliating in everything about this, isn't there?&quot; grumbled Tony.</p>
