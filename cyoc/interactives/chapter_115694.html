<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tad was grateful that his afternoon went quietly.  Some of the rumors that went on about this supposed fight between a teacher and a wereraccoon from the previous day was, thankfully, the &quot;biggest&quot; thing that seemed to attract a lot of attention. Tad understood it related issues that weres didn&#39;t like, particularly when a were went rogue, but for the moment that seemed to be rather small in the grand scheme of things. This issue would blow over. If either the teacher or the wereraccoon had broken the law, they&#39;d likely see trial and end up behind bars. That was the way of things and they would surely blow over once that happened.<br />
<br />
The biggest thing that Tad was concerned with was with regard to Dymixious and the likely investigation that could very well draw attention to the existence of weres to the world. Revealing the secret might be something that would have to come sooner or later, and Tad had put in his Government class&#39;s assignments his ideas to let that go easily and successfully, but things wouldn&#39;t go well if the revelation of weres came as the result of either a rogue were or a confrontation between weres and police where the secret couldn&#39;t be kept. It was why the arrest of Lionel Ulysses had been such a big thing when it first happened and why Tad got the sensation that Dymixious&#39;s over-sized ego wouldn&#39;t make it easy for the secret to be kept so long as the police were investigating his involvement in Ulysses&#39; murder. That would be especially true if the police agencies hunting Dymixious were outside Moon Lake agencies. So far, there had been no sign of further problems from him. In fact, neither Tad nor Amy noticed any sign of him as they walked home from school.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... today proved to be good and quiet,&quot; Tad commented as they walked along.<br />
<br />
&quot;And a good thing too,&quot; Amy agreed, &quot;between all the other stuff going on... more excitement was not something that could be wanted or needed at the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad nodded as they walked along, crossing a street to get onto the street that ran out toward where the Decker and Howler houses were located. The two shared some smiles, and Tad let the fact that the day had been generally quiet to offer a question that came to his mind. It might be the fact that he was with his girlfriend who was beautiful, but Tad figured that was something everyone did when they were with the people they loved.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... do you want to do something together this afternoon? Homework or something like that?&quot; Tad asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d love to do something,&quot; Amy smiled and then sighed, &quot;but my folks want me to help with some things that we&#39;ll be doing to get things ready for when Jay and Leon transform. So, I can&#39;t do anything this afternoon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad sighed and looked down for a moment. Amy caught onto this and placed a hand on Tad&#39;s shoulder as they walked along.<br />
<br />
&quot;However, by this evening,&quot; Amy then spoke, &quot;I&#39;d be free...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You would?&quot; Tad looked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Amy smiled, &quot;by then, we&#39;d be through with dinner and we could go out for a nice fury walk in the woods... for some other sorts of fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
That REALLY peaked Tad&#39;s interest and he couldn&#39;t help but give a fairly goofy grin at that, which made Amy laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it you&#39;re interested, then?&quot; Amy gave a laugh, to which Tad nodded.<br />
<br />
By this time, they&#39;d arrived at the sidewalk that lead directly up to the front door of his home. Tad nodded and moved to head up to his home.<br />
<br />
&quot;See you tonight!&quot; Tad called to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Amy smiled and moved on toward her own home.<br />
<br />
Tad walked into his home and found his mom quietly reading in he living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, mom, did you have a good day?&quot; Tad asked to.<br />
<br />
Jen looked up from the couch and nodded, &quot;Sure. It went well. I could have wished there were some answers to my job applications... but they may only be looking through them at the moment. It may take time for them to actually make a decision on who they wish to interview.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll do well, Mom,&quot; Tad said to her, &quot;I&#39;m going to work on my homework, you&#39;ll let me know when dinner is ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen Decker nodded.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Across the area of woods that separated the spokes that were Moon Lake&#39;s streets that had the Decker house on one spoke and the Twist house on the other, evening had settled quietly with Agent Teddy Green and his wife Marci arriving. They were there on vacation and for Teddy to become a were so that he and Marci could finally be together. Thankfully Samantha Twist had found a weretiger that was willing to transform him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for doing this for me,&quot; Teddy spoke, &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;re not used to this sort of thing with other people&#39;s husbands...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually... open marriages can be more common in Moon Lake than you think,&quot; Lila Carpenter, the weretigress that had volunteered for the job, &quot;bisexual werecats like your wife may enjoy a situation where they can be with both their male husband and from time to time with women  that strike their fancy... some will even share their women with their husbands if they&#39;re also bisexual.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting,&quot; Teddy said slowly as he looked over the bedroom, which looked fairly spartan, but then it was a spare/guest room. He figured the Twists didn&#39;t use it all that often.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can be fun for those that do it,&quot; Lila commented, &quot;but our purpose... is to give you the chance to truly be with your wife...&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
In Seattle, Tom carefully carried Alice toward the bedroom they&#39;d shared the night before. Thankfully, he&#39;d somehow managed to remember the way and how many steps it&#39;d need to take, because as he walked he found himself locked in a very passionate kiss with her. She was a very beautiful woman and his mind marveled in many ways in how his life had changed since meeting her and how much more it would change very soon. It was amazing and he truly felt something in his heart as his tongue wrestled with Alice&#39;s as they kissed.<br />
<br />
The issue of the were-secret was something that would still need to be solved. They couldn&#39;t hide forever, and if they waited for an incident that did expose them, negative responses would be likely. There might be some justification for some of the fear, but if handled well, weres could could out, gain equal rights, and would be treated fairly. It was all very possible and doable under the right circumstances, and as a reporter dedicated to the truth, Tom would do his best to make sure weres got that. But that would take time. Alice had told him that she had grown up in a town that was something of a were sanctuary and that if weres were to be revealed, he&#39;d need to talk with them first. Tom had agreed, as he didn&#39;t want things to go bad and figured he would need their help to make sure the &quot;big reveal&quot; came off as a success.<br />
<br />
However, that really wasn&#39;t on his agenda at that moment. His only real goal, was at the moment to join were society and bond with his vixen.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;This looks good, mom,&quot; Tad spoke as he and his mother sat down to dinner, &quot;Smells good too...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I do my best,&quot; Jen smiled, &quot;and we&#39;ve been here long enough now that we&#39;re not having to live off of dried foods that could survive the move to Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad nodded and began eating.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how&#39;s Amy doing?&quot; Jen asked, &quot;you both seemed a little nervous yesterday...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We were nervous yesterday because of all the weird stuff that Dymixious guy was ranting about,&quot; Tad answered, remembering stumbling into the were-komodo-dragon the day before, &quot;but today was far more quiet...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I take it she&#39;s fine, then?&quot; Jen asked, glad to see her son doing well and actually having someone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Tad answered with a nod, &quot;we plan to go out for a walk after dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Jen raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;A furry walk,&quot; Tad gave a small smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see...&quot; Jen smiled, &quot;Well... just remember your curfew. You do have school tomorrow.&quot;</p>
