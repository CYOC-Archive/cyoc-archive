<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hang on, you said my little clone put some kind of spell on this, didn't you.  Perhaps I should try it on in a less public place,&quot; she told me as she walked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wasn't it you who said I had a magic ring?&quot; I teased back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but I like my job here and I can wait to find out what my little self asked for.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded in agreement.  &quot;I'm not about to tell the world I have a magic ring.  It would be like announcing I won the lottery.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you haven't asked to be rich, have you?&quot; she asked as she put the bathing suit in her workout bag.<br />
<br />
&quot;Na, I'm comfortable with what I have.  I don't need lots of cash to be happy,&quot; I honestly said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  I like that.  So, can that teleport you other places?&quot; she wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know.  It's not something I've tried yet.  I wish I was behind Amanda&quot;  Instantly, I was looking at her back.  <br />
<br />
To Amanda I just disappeared.  I tapped her on the back.  She jumped.  &quot;Oh, I guess that answers that question.  What about me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can it move me, too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know why not.  Want me to try?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure!&quot; she said.  She then braced herself for some kind of queasy force to act on her.<br />
<br />
I silently wished her into the shower room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Amanda's voice echoed.  She ran back to her locker and I had a smug look on my face.  &quot;That answers that question.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep.  There's lots of things the ring can do.  Are you wanting me to send you home?&quot; I inquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure...  I rode the train in.  Give it a try,&quot; she encouraged.<br />
<br />
&quot;How will I find you?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not coming with me?&quot; she said somewhat perplexed I wouldn't go with her.  &quot;What if you put me in the ocean or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn't sure I should.  It's your home,&quot; I said with a blush.<br />
<br />
&quot;At this point, what does it matter?  I mean, if you wanted to turn me into your slave, you could do that.  Heck, we could easily turn me into a nude statue to admire.  You haven't yet, so I guess that's a good thing.  I'm surprised you are shy to go to my house.&quot;<br />
<br />
I smiled at those possibilities, although I had not really considered doing them to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joe, of course you can come to my house,&quot; she concluded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I wish you were at your house.&quot;<br />
<br />
Instantly, Amanda disappeared.  Her locker remained open and nothing remained where she stood.  I walked to where she was and waved my hand through the air.  &quot;Wow,&quot; I exclaimed.  I looked down to see Amanda's lock on the bench.  I picked it up, closed her locker and secured the lock in place.  A spin of the lock kept the combination secret even from me.  I made a wish that the lock unlocked, and the shank dropped out of the lock.  I relocked her locker and was smug.<br />
<br />
Amanda was home for two minutes looking around and wondering where Joe was.  She was standing in her living room before the entertainment cabinet.  She whispered for me but never got a response.  When I reappeared about 2 feet behind her she screamed.  I was startled as well and almost wished that she shut up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joe!  There you are.  What took you so long?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You left your locker open.  I locked it back up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That took a minute?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I made sure I could unlock it and that you had really disappeared,&quot; I said quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm all here.  I must say I felt little moving here.  It was like I instantly went from one place to another.  The weird part is the sudden change in surroundings,&quot; she described. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it certainly is a change in environment.  Nice place, by the way,&quot; I commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.  I hope to do more with it or even move outside the city.  It's enough for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked around to see pictures of family.  Although I didn't know Amanda, I was a little disappointed to see a picture of her embracing another guy.  Amanda saw a slight sigh as I looked at the picture.  &quot;Joe, that's my brother.  He died a few years ago,&quot; she said, gulping a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; I said solemnly.  <br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright.  I'm not seeing anyone,&quot; she added with a smile.<br />
<br />
I smirked.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, about this bathing suit,&quot; she changed the subject and drawing us to the reason we came here, &quot;what does it do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your little self asked me not to tell you.  Just put it on and try it out,&quot; I said, trying to suppress a smile.<br />
<br />
Amanda tilted her head from one side to another with a frown.  After rolling her eyes, &quot;Okay, fine.  I assume I'll be living after I put it on?&quot;<br />
<br />
I knodded.  &quot;Yes, you'll be living.  It doesn't turn you into anything,&quot; I assurred her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright...  This better not do anything weird,&quot; she charged.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing too weird,&quot; I teased.<br />
<br />
She rolled her eyes.  &quot;Fine!&quot;  With that she walked off into a hallway and shut a door carefully.  I made myself at home, sitting on the couch and admiring the view of the sky out the window.  An aquarium of tropical fish sat to the right of the window.  A dozen or so of fish darted around the 20 gallon aquarium.  A wall covered in books was behind the couch.<br />
<br />
I heard a faint gasp come from the hallway and then silence.  I wasn't sure what happened.  I waited for a few minutes, called for Amanda and heard nothing.  I heard Amanda say &quot;cool&quot;.  &quot;Amanda, you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
She came out of her room and went into the living room, holding the metallic blue bathing suit and wearing a bathrobe.  &quot;Fantastic!  She wanted me to shrink to a foot tall, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, or even smaller if you wanted...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Smaller!  Being a foot tall was quite small.  I couldn't reach the door knob, otherwise I would have come out here.  That was really freaky when I realized I was so short,&quot; she paused and added, &quot;smaller?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; I replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh.&quot;  Amanda appeared to be thinking that over.  &quot;How?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You just wish or think it.  That was your double's request.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Turn around,&quot; she ordered.<br />
<br />
&quot;huh&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Turn around so I can put this thing back on,&quot; she demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you go into your room?&quot; I questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because it takes a few more steps when you're a foot tall to cover the same distance.  Just turn around and don't peek!&quot; she charged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; I said with a sigh.  I turned around, making sure I couldn't see anything by reflection.  I heard something fall into a clump on the floor and slipping of clothing over skin.  Then I heard Amanda go &quot;ooh&quot;.  It was then quiet until I heard a high pitched voice scream &quot;Joe!&quot;.<br />
<br />
I turned around to see Amanda about where she was before, but she was just under the height of the couch's mattress.  She was a slender, just about the size of a Barbie doll, wearing an alluring blue bathing suit.  She looked a little disoriented, too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amanda,&quot; I spoke.  Her eyes went wide open and she covered up her ears.  <br />
<br />
&quot;STOP SHOUTING,&quot; she screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;STOP SHOUTING AT ME,&quot; she screamed.<br />
<br />
I then realized that her tiny ears couldn't handle normal sleep.  I wished silently to talk to her without hurting her ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amanda, sorry.  The size difference causes a few problems,&quot; I spoke.  At first she looked like she was grimacing that I'd speak.  Her face changed as I spoke and she realized there was no pain as I spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;How come you can talk and my ears are not ringing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I made a wish, Amanda.  A wish for you to talk without hurting your ears.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; she said, feeling a little giggly inside because I made a change for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, the suit fits well?&quot; I said, grinning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, for my size, yes,&quot; she giggled.  &quot;It doesn't even give you a chance to put it completely on before it shrinks you.  I had just gotten the suit slipped up my thighs when I felt the buzz.  For some reason, I felt compelled to get it on rather once I started.  I must say, it's a different perspective being a foot tall.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet it is.  How do you feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; she exclaimed and spun around.  &quot;I really don't feel any different.  I still feel the rush that came on when I shrunk.  It almost feels like the suit is alive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is magical.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I need to try something.&quot;  Amanda stood straight and said something I couldn't hear.  Her height instantly halved.  She appeared to be hopping.  &quot;Joe, this is awesome!&quot;<br />
<br />
Before I could say something, she disappeared.  <br />
<br />
1) Amanda and Carpet Fiber<br />
2) Amanda goes into another dimension<br />
<br />
Amanda wondered how small she could go and never expected a wish to be a millimeter tall would be granted, but she quickly went from 150 mm to 1 mm tall in one step.  She felt herself falling through the forest of her carpet until she sat on a strand of fiber that provided the backing of her carpet.  Joe was no were to be seen as light was filtered by the trees that stood 15 times her height.  <br />
<br />
This new size was somewhat alien and surreal.  Dirt unpicked up by the vacuum cleaner were boulders to her.  She saw fibers taller than herself running everywhere.  She closed her eyes, realizing she was far smaller than she had ever imagined.  The iridescent blue suit still fit her body like a glove and she could still feel a buzz from it.<br />
<br />
The ground rumbled slightly to her as I walked closer to where she was.  Minor earthquakes jostled her.<br />
<br />
I looked down on the spot where Amanda had stood.  'Where did she go?' I wondered.  &quot;Amanda?&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
Amanda smiled when she heard my voice, recognizing that I was concerned.  &quot;Joe,&quot; she said.  To anyone else, her voice exceeded any normal hearing range, but somehow Joe's wish let them talk.  &quot;I'm fine.  I wished to be a millimeter tall, and whoops, I am.  It's quite a change,&quot; she admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're a millimeter tall!&quot; I exclaimed.  I had wondered about being the size of an atom, but the fact that she was so small was mind boggling.  &quot;That's, what, 1600 times smaller than  normal!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, something like that.  I wonder if I should go any smaller,&quot; she tempted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd never find you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have a magic ring, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; I responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll find me,&quot; she assured me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you tried to make yourself bigger?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; she said uneasily.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know you can grow back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully if I take the suit of I'll go back to normal.  I did before,&quot; she reasoned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll test it.&quot;  With that Amanda wished she was an inch tall.  She was half immersed in fibers and pushed a few out of her way.  I could see her sticking up from the carpet like a matchstick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi there,&quot; I whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, this is quite an effect.  I wish I was normal size,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Amanda grew back to her shrunken size of 12 or 13 inches.  &quot;This is normal?&quot; she questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is while you wear that suit,&quot; I snickered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha Ha,&quot; she said.  &quot;I wish you were my size.&quot;</p>
