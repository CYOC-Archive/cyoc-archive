<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Max was having the time of his life! He could smell everything, no one minded that he was naked, and he had a strong bushy tail to wag around as he pleased. Being a dog was already as good as he&#39;d always thought it would be, maybe better! But it wasn&#39;t quite good enough yet, because he wasn&#39;t really a dog yet. Sniffing around on all fours was already starting to take a toll on his 30-year-old hands and knees! He wanted to keep himself close enough to the ground to smell things easily from now on, but he was going to need some more changes for that to be realistic.<br />
<br />
He found a dried up patch of ice cream that had been dripped by some gluttonous volunteer a few days ago, which smelled delightful. It was time to try out that long, floppy tongue he could feel in his muzzle. Just need to wipe it across the floor like a dog does... ah! There it is, the taste of cream and vanilla. Time to wag that tail again! The audience laughed at the dog man licking the floor, but he didn&#39;t mind. He just kept licking the days-old ice cream stain. Then he looked up and licked his nostrils for the first time, wetting them down some more and covering them in the scent of the ice cream. The audience laughed again.<br />
<br />
Madame Illusia vanished and reappeared at the far end of the stage. The audience ooh-ed and ah-ed. Max could smell that she was farther away now, and he could also smell something new over there with her, something that made him sniff the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Max, you want a treat? Come and get it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Max&#39;s stomach growled. The meat smells coming from the brown thing in her hand were overwhelming. He tried to waddle over on his hands and knees, but his knees were aching like daggers at this point and he had to stop and rest. He whimpered, disliking the pain and wanting to get to his treat already. He heard his girlfriend out in the audience calling out in his direction: &quot;Damon! Are you okay?! What&#39;s wrong baby?&quot; Max wondered who &quot;Damon&quot; was. Was that what his name used to be? Max decided it didn&#39;t matter, but he did glance over at her and muster a few tail wags to put her at ease. She smelled nervous even from where she was sitting, and Max hoped he wasn&#39;t the reason.<br />
<br />
Suddenly his hind paws, I mean, his feet felt funny. They felt a bit puffer toward the front and oddly compressed near the back. Something was going on with his thighs and kneecaps, too. It was getting to hard to stand, even on all fours, so he sat down on stage and spread his legs out in front of him. He could feel his tail stretched out for behind him on the floor, and he had to be careful not to pinch it at a bad angle right at the spot where it joined his back. He found himself leaning forward a bit to accommodate it.<br />
<br />
Max was surprised to find that his feet were longer and already much, much thinner! The puffy feeling turned out to be some jet-black rough regions that looked like pawpads. His toenails looked way different: they were narrow, thick and pointed, just like dog claws! The rest of his legs were starting to get shorter but thicker and closer to his torso, so his knees were basically getting tucked up into him. He tensed one of his ankles/hocks to raise one of his new paws off the ground so he could feel it over with one hand. It really did feel just like touching a dog paw!<br />
<br />
He had to let go of his paw, though, when he felt his hand losing dexterity and his elbow getting tucked back up closer to his rib cage. He felt some more pads sprout and watch his new front claws grow in. Brown fur covered both his arms and his legs at once. Unable to make any sort of grasping motion anymore, he stuck his long tongue out again and ran it across one of his new front paws to try to feel it. Dragging his wide tongue against his fresh fur and rough pads amazed him, which he somewhat expected, but he wasn&#39;t ready for the sheer pleasure of grooming one of his paws like this. He eagerly slurped at it several more times before moving onto the other, thumping his hairy tail against the ground as he did so. Being a dog was giving him feelings he couldn&#39;t live without if he changed back!<br />
<br />
Finally, he sniffed the air again and saw the treat in Madame&#39;s hand. He sprinted over to it on four legs, listening to the steady click of his own claws against the stage, feeling his pads take his weight for him with each step. He chomped the thing down in a few bites before licking the crumbs off the floor. The audience cheered again.</p>
