<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh, well, so much has happened to me,&quot; Jessica said, &quot;I may be the stress of change or something.  I was <br />
working in the garden, and I heard a buzzing.  I thought at first it was a dragonfly, but it wasn't.  It was <br />
bigger than a dragonfly, and it hovered there just at the end of the row of wolf's bane. But it couldn't have <br />
been - could it?  I swear I saw a fairy? Is that even possible?&quot; <br />
<br />
Mother Goode stood up straight and stiff.  Her eyes got a faraway look in them, and she said in a hushed tone, <br />
&quot;Oh, there be fairies alright. Evil, soulless creatures that live to torture us mortals.  They live outside of <br />
time, and you may see one before it was even born, and after it was destroyed.  You cannot kill such monsters <br />
as fairies, you can only destroy them with iron. You were using the small steel spade, I gave you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why yes, I was!&quot; Jessica said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It may have saved you.  Only thing that can harm a fairy is iron.  That's why people hang iron horseshoes for <br />
good luck.  It's not the shape or the fact that it belongs on a horse, it's because the iron is a ward against <br />
the fairies. You are fortunate it didn't speak to you or worse yet touch you,&quot; Gretel Goode said with a <br />
shiver, &quot;It was undoubtedly attracted by my transformation spell and your latent magic. Fairies are notorious <br />
for abducting children.  Their magic glamors are very powerful.  Did you ever see a Midsummer Night's Dream? <br />
They made a man appear to have the head of an ass, and made mortals fall in love with the wrong people for <br />
sport.  They make themselves appear harmless and beguilingly beautiful, but they aren't.  They are the Old <br />
Ones, the fallen gods, the fates - the name Fairies or Fair Folk are a euphemism to conceal their evil more <br />
sinister nature.  Cthulu is one of the Old Ones, one of the fairies.  His true horrible nature was revealed by <br />
Lovecraft.  All nasty tentacles and things, but when I saw him he looked like the sweetest little creature,&quot; <br />
she spoke getting wistful in her memories, &quot;He called himself Gold Tear.  That's what the human soul looks <br />
like when he extracts it - it's a golden tear. He tried to get me to leave my brother Hansel and run off with <br />
him, but fortunately I stayed.  If I hadn't that evil witch you used to live here would have eaten him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mother, you're Gretel from the story Hansel and Gretel?  But you can't be!  That was so long ago, you can't <br />
be that old!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, child, it's true, I am Gretel.  In the months that the witch Griselda kept Hansel locked up in the cage <br />
in the pantry - I've since gotten rid of that nasty thing,&quot; she interjected, and then continued, &quot;I learned to <br />
be quite a good apprentice witch.  I discovered that she and her familiar Gold Tear were up to purely by <br />
chance.  All the gingerbread men surrounding the garden back that had been people that she had snared. She <br />
used her witchcraft with Cthulu's dark fairy magic to extract gold tears from her victims and turned their <br />
soulless bodies into gingerbread,&quot; Gretel said with a shudder and closed her eyes.<br />
<br />
Jessica stared with a bite of sandwich in her mouth.  She didn't know what to believe or what to say. She was <br />
glad that she had food in her mouth, so she had an excuse not to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chew your food, dearie, and I'll tell you more.  See over in this corner, you can see an indentation in the <br />
floor.  That's where the evil sacrificial altar was set with a brick oven built on top of it.  She had me <br />
stoke the coals into the stone opening underneath Cthulu's altar. When the fire was hot enough, she would put <br />
her dough into the oven to cook.  One day, I was tending the ginger plants that grew outside that window,&quot; <br />
Gretel said pointing, and that foul fairy Gold Tear flew in through the other window. It was angry, and I had <br />
never heard it speak so before.  Like you, I had thought it was a beautiful gentle creature, but my eyes <br />
widened as I heard its own words reveal its evil nature.&quot;<br />
<br />
She sighed and shuddered.  &quot;I really wish we could have pushed that fairy into the oven along with the old <br />
witch, but it would have just consumed her gold tear and been none the worse for the baking. Fairies can <br />
withstand tremendous heat and cold.  It's said that's why fairy swords and armor are best.  They cannot be <br />
forged by man or dwarf for the heat's of hell's fire is too intense, and fairy metalwork is all forged in <br />
hell, or at least hellfire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry I digress, Gold Tear was angry with the witch for not offering up Hansel and me on his altar yet.  He <br />
wanted to consume our souls.  I learned that the gold tear was forced out of the witch's victims while they <br />
baked.  She would give it to Gold Tear Cthulu, and then devour the gingerbread man or at least its heart which <br />
she would replace treacle and frosting.  Hansel and I had eaten her gingerbread before we knew that it was <br />
really transformed humans. I suspect that's why I have lived so long and only aged a fraction of what I <br />
should, but eventually I too will die, and that's why I need you to be my apprentice, my daughter to continue <br />
the battle for good against the forces of evil like Cthulu Gold Tear,&quot; now the witch spoke fervently.<br />
<br />
&quot;As I was outside the window, I heard the dialog between the Griselda and Gold Tear.  That's when I learned <br />
that Gold Tear was Cthulu.  You'll learn about that evil creature in my grimoires.  Mind you, I had no idea <br />
that Gold Tear was Cthulu until Griselda called him that. She thought I was at the market.  I had gone there <br />
early that morning to sell herbs and remedies, and usually I would spend the day, but there was so much work <br />
to do in the garden, I had hurried back early. I was going to surprise her, but weeding the entire garden. I <br />
thought if she was pleased enough, she'd let Hansel out of his cage. She had said it was for Hansel's own good <br />
that she kept him in the cage, and I learned that part was true. Let's see I think I can remember what was <br />
said word for word.  Gold Tear spoke first,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;He said, &quot;Mother of Grendel, be quick about it.  The young huntsman I bewitched should be here forthwith, and <br />
you must bake his soul out of him, and be quick about it.  I am starving!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She replied, &quot;Oh, Great and Powerful Cthulu, calm yourself, all is prepared.  You and I shall both dine on <br />
huntsmen ere the day is out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He answered, &quot;Bah, I'll settle for huntsman, but I wouldst rather dine on the child's soul.  Why do you keep <br />
him in that iron cage instead of baking him? I guided the two children here, and sent my crows to eat their <br />
breadcrumb trail so that you could cook them.  Instead you have adopted them.  Do you do this merely to taunt <br />
and torture me?  Such succulent young souls,&quot; he sounded sickening glutenous,&quot; Gretel added with another <br />
visible shudder.  It seemed hard for her to tell this story, but she seemed compelled to tell it too.<br />
<br />
Jessica listened intently not even tasting the venison sausage or bread which she was eating. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then there was the sound of someone munching gingerbread by the door, and Mother Griselda went to the door, <br />
and flung it open. She said, &quot;Nibble, nibble, mousekin, who is nibbling at my housekin?&quot;  The young man bent <br />
over chewing at the pastry shingle looked up.  He was not just your average hunter.  He was a nobleman, <br />
perhaps even a prince.  He was clad in yellow hose and green doublet. Now mind you, even in my day, such garb <br />
was archaic.  That's how I learned that fairies wander back and forth through time the way you and I walk to <br />
and fro.  The old evil witch interrogated the young man at length to determine who he was and from which time.  <br />
She was greatly concerned that Cthulu hadn't altered certain aspects of the timeline by fetching the young man <br />
too her.  He was a handsome man.  If only I could have done something to save him, but I was just a girl, and <br />
I didn't realize what was happening until it was too late. I peered at him through over the window ledge.  I <br />
had never seen a codpiece before, I must confess I was slightly in awe of his manhood,&quot; Mother Goode confided.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before I knew it he was naked and lying on the kitchen table covered with flour, and then she produced a <br />
rolling pin. I'm not sure if I even was aware of the spell that transformed him into dough.  I had been so <br />
disappointed to see that codpiece made his manhood look far larger than it was - oh, I shouldn't talk of such <br />
things to a ten year old girl.  I was thirteen at the time, and I had started thinking about men. <br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, the hunter whose named was Edward was really only 13 too.  His boots had lifts in them, and besides <br />
padding his codpiece, his tailor had given him puffy shoulders on his sleeves to make him look broader in the <br />
chest and shoulders than his 13 years belied. Griselda laughed as he lay their mesmerized by her or Gold <br />
Tear's magic. She said, &quot;Now I know what happened to one of the lost princes. Ah, but in your case your <br />
highness, I should say king.  I've never baked a king cookie before, this is quite an honor.  Was your brother <br />
Richard with you when the fairy pooka'd you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He moaned as if trying to form the words in head full of dough, and that's precisely what he was by that <br />
point.  He was living, breathing, immobile dough.  I honestly don't recall his answer.  I had sat down and <br />
pressed by back against the wall of the cottage, and pulled my knees up to my chest. That fluttering glittery <br />
monster Cthulu had started to turn to look toward me.  I'm sure it sensed me, but maybe not clearly, as I was <br />
holding a iron trowel. The magnetism of iron clouds the fairy's powers.  He may have thought I was miles away <br />
coming back from the village, and not just outside the window...<br />
<br />
It was all so confusing.  The witch was Gretel Goode.  But was she the good Gretel from the story, or was she <br />
the monster Gold Tear described. Gold Tear was a fairy, but could she be the good beautiful creature she <br />
appeared or was she the evil Cthulu in disguise.  The wrong choice could lead to Jessica's downfall.  She <br />
needed to make the right decision, but how.  Perhaps she could ask a question?  Rick's memory drifted back to <br />
logic class, and the story of the missionary at the two tribesmen.  One always told the truth, one always <br />
lied. He needed to know which one was the truth sayer, but could only ask one question.  Except that didn't <br />
apply here, both the witch and the fairy could tell truths and lies. Obviously, one or both of them were, but <br />
how was Jessica to decide.<br />
<br />
If she was wrong, she would end up either with her body stolen or as a gold tear in Cthulu's belly.  Neither <br />
prospect was too inviting. She stared soberly at her sandwich.  She forced herself to take another bite.  She <br />
would need to keep her strength up.</p>
