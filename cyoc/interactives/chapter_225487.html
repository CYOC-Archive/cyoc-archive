<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I had just gotten caught by Kelly, my stepmom, while I was trying on her clothes while she was out and about, and now she was going to use magic to change me into whatever form she liked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, well, you wanted to wear my clothes so badly and pretend to be a mature woman, how about I make you as curvaceous and full-figured. Do you like that? Maybe a bit more heavy set too, giving you a thick and wide body with big jiggly boobs.&quot; Kelly said as she moved each part of her body as she mentioned them.<br />
<br />
I blushed and stuttered out an, &quot;I-uh-well-&quot; before she placed a finger on my lip to silence me.<br />
<br />
I looked at her and she had a smirk on her face and said, &quot;I know! How about I give you all of that and you and me can go out and have a night out on the town. Maybe we can even go to the beach. And I can invite my friends over so you can see some hot moms in bikinis. Then you can get a sense of what life is like as a hot mom from multiple people. Oh, Lana, Elise, June, Bridget, and Emma are gonna love having another woman to talk to. Now prepare yourself sweetie because you&#39;re about to become a milf!&quot; Kelly said as she waved her hand, starting my transformation.<br />
<br />
As the magic swirled around me, my body started changing. My hips and ass expanded, stretching the white panties tight against me and making the grey pleated skirt ride up on my wide, expanding rump. I could feel the fabric of the pink blouse on my breasts grow tighter as they got bigger. My lacy white bra was filled out more and more until it finally ripped apart and I felt the air against my nipples. The magic kept flowing into me, and I could feel my stomach getting bigger and rounder, pushing the tight blouse to its limits.<br />
<br />
After a minute, the magic stopped flowing, but my body was still expanding a bit. When it stopped, I looked and saw I was even larger than before. My ass was huge, almost the size of a car tire. My breasts were massive, even bigger than my head, and they hung off my body like water balloons. My stomach was huge and rounded out. My whole body was jiggly and wobbly. I turned around and my ass smacked into the bed and nearly knocked it over. I could feel the skirt ride up more and show more of my ass.<br />
<br />
Kelly was looking me up and down and licking her lips. She walked up to me and said, in a low, seductive tone, &quot;So, how do you feel? Is your body as beautiful as mine?&quot; She asked as she pressed her boobs into my own and wrapped her arms around my thick body.<br />
<br />
I blushed at her question and said, &quot;Uh, yeah. I&#39;m feeling better now.&quot;<br />
<br />
She let go of me and went to her closet and grabbed a large red blouse and some dark blue jeans. She tossed them to me and said, &quot;Get changed. We&#39;re going out and if we&#39;re lucky, we can get you some nice clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
I put the clothes on, but they were so small and tight. The pants were squeezing my legs, but thankfully they were stretchy and had some give, and the shirt was barely containing my boobs. It was a good thing I had a thick layer of fat over my stomach because the button of the jeans would&#39;ve burst if I fastened it.<br />
<br />
Kelly took a look at me and nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look good, but the clothes need some adjusting. Now, I&#39;m gonna get changed and then we can go.&quot; Kelly said.<br />
<br />
Kelly changed into a short white skirt and a purple tube top. The skirt was riding up on her, showing a lot of her plump rear.<br />
<br />
I couldn&#39;t stop staring at her ass and boobs and Kelly caught me staring and chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what you see? Well, don&#39;t worry. You&#39;ll have plenty of fun tonight staring at milfs. Now let&#39;s get going.&quot; She said as she walked past me.<br />
<br />
I followed her out the door and down the stairs. My stomach was rubbing up against the sides of the staircase, and the jeans were riding up slightly, accentuating my ass.<br />
<br />
Once we got down the stairs, I turned around to close the door, but the doorknob slipped out of my hand and bounced off my stomach, hitting the floor and rolling away.<br />
<br />
I bent down to pick it up, but I was struggling with my plump body in the way.<br />
<br />
Kelly was watching me, and she said, &quot;Oh my, are you really that out of shape? We need to get you to a gym.&quot;<br />
<br />
I finally managed to pick up the doorknob, but my back was aching from all the effort.<br />
<br />
We left the house and headed towards the city.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, where are we going?&quot; I asked Kelly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, first we&#39;re going to get you some clothes. Then we&#39;ll see what else there is to do.&quot; Kelly replied.<br />
<br />
We walked into the mall and headed to the department store.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, let&#39;s get you some clothes.&quot; Kelly said as she looked through the racks of clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;These should work.&quot; She said as she handed me a couple of tops and some jeans.<br />
<br />
I took them and went to the dressing room to try them on.<br />
<br />
When I came out, every top looked close to tearing to shreds if I moved wrong and the jeans couldn&#39;t even go over my giant ass. Kelly had a frown on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;They don&#39;t fit. Let&#39;s try another store.&quot; She said as she left the store.<br />
<br />
I followed her, but my stomach was rubbing against the abnormally small doorway.<br />
<br />
We went to a couple of different stores, but none of the clothes fit me.<br />
<br />
Finally, Kelly got fed up.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it! We&#39;re going to Victoria&#39;s Secret.&quot; She said as she marched off.<br />
<br />
I followed her, trying not to knock anything over.<br />
&quot;We&#39;re here. Let&#39;s see if they have anything that fits you.&quot; Kelly said as we walked into the store.<br />
<br />
I was embarrassed at the thought of shopping in a lingerie store, but Kelly seemed determined to get me some clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, how about this one?&quot; She asked, holding up a black lace bra.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s way too small.&quot; I said, shaking my head, knowing it&#39;d be too small through new womanly instincts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, then we&#39;ll get the next size up.&quot; She said as she continued browsing.<br />
<br />
She picked out a few more bras, all in the next size up and handed them to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, try them on.&quot; She said, leading me to the dressing room.<br />
<br />
I tried on the first bra and it fit perfectly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it! You&#39;re getting that.&quot; Kelly said as she smiled.<br />
<br />
I was glad she found something for me, but I didn&#39;t really like that it was lingerie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, how about some sexy underwear? Something that&#39;ll really accentuate your figure.&quot; Kelly said as she browsed the shelves.<br />
<br />
She found a pair of red lace panties and handed them to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go try these on.&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
I went into the dressing room and put them on. They fit snugly and showed off my ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s see them.&quot; Kelly said.<br />
<br />
I came out and turned so she could see all angles of my ass, I mean the panties, and she was smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect! Now, how about a skirt?&quot; She asked as she found a short, tight, and thin, black leather skirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on.&quot; She said as she pushed me into the dressing room.<br />
<br />
I reluctantly put on the skirt, and it was tight and barely covered my ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s see.&quot; Kelly said.<br />
<br />
I walked out, and the skirt was barely covering my ass, and the fabric was digging into my fat.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is ridiculous. It&#39;s too small and tight.&quot; I said, trying to cover myself up despite the fact that I was with another woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll find something that fits.&quot; Kelly said as she continued looking.<br />
<br />
After a while, she found a couple more pairs of bras, panties, and a few skirts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, try these on.&quot; She said as she pushed a stack of clothes into my hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I-&quot; I started to say, but Kelly cut me off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just try them on. We&#39;ll see if they fit.&quot; She said as she turned me around and pushed me into the dressing room.<br />
<br />
The clothes she had given me were just barely too tight and didn&#39;t fit me.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is impossible. I can&#39;t wear these.&quot; I said as I struggled to pull up the tight black leather skirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you can. Just squeeze in and zip up.&quot; Kelly said as she pulled the zipper up.<br />
<br />
The skirt was very tight and didn&#39;t fit.<br />
<br />
&quot;There, see? It fits. Now come on, we&#39;re going to go find some more clothes for you.&quot; Kelly said as she dragged me out of the dressing room.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when she found the bikini section and looked at me before saying, &quot;Hey, we can buy you a bikini too for tonight! I just texted my friends and they all said they&#39;d love to meet a new girl! So pick which bikini you want and I&#39;ll buy it for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
I blushed and stuttered out, &quot;I-I-Uh-But-Kelly, I can pay for the bikini. You don&#39;t have to-mmph!&quot; I tried to tell her, but she placed a finger on my lips and shushed me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhh. No arguing, okay? Just choose a bikini. I&#39;m paying.&quot; She said as she removed her finger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, fine. I&#39;ll let you pay for the bikini. But don&#39;t spend too much money on me.&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t. Now, which one do you want?&quot; She asked.<br />
I looked at the rack of bikinis and chose a cute white bikini.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the one I want.&quot; I said, showing her the bikini.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. Now we have to find a nice top and some bottoms to match.&quot; She said as she took the bikini from me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, let&#39;s look at the tops.&quot; She said as she took my hand and led me to the top section.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which one do you like?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
I was embarrassed and said, &quot;I don&#39;t know. How about you choose one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. How about this one?&quot; She asked, pulling out a skimpy red top.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not that one.&quot; I said, shaking my head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. What about this one?&quot; She asked, pulling out a pink, frilly top.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, that&#39;s too girly.&quot; I said, shaking my head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. Then how about this one?&quot; She asked, pulling out a skimpy and revealing silver top.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess. There&#39;s not a whole lot of concealing options here anyways.&quot; I said, sighing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great. Now let&#39;s find some bottoms to match.&quot; She said as she dragged me to the bottom section.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm. Let&#39;s see. Oh, how about this one?&quot; She asked, taking out a pair of red booty shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way. Not that one.&quot; I said, shaking my head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. Then how about this one?&quot; She asked, pulling a silver pair of short shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe.&quot; I said, shrugging.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take that as a yes.&quot; She said, chuckling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go pay for these.&quot; She said as she led me to the cashier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, I&#39;d like to buy these please.&quot; Kelly said as she handed the items to the cashier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, let me just ring those up for you.&quot; The cashier said as he rang up the items.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, that&#39;ll be $80.&quot; The cashier said.<br />
<br />
&quot;$80!? That&#39;s ridiculous! Kelly, I can pay for these.&quot; I said, shocked at the price.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shush. It&#39;s my treat. Consider this one of the few bonus gifts I&#39;m giving you since your change. Now, I&#39;m buying them.&quot; Kelly said, handing the cashier her card.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. Here&#39;s your receipt. Have a nice day.&quot; The cashier said as he handed Kelly her receipt and the bags.<br />
<br />
&quot;You too.&quot; Kelly said as she took the bags and left.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I could&#39;ve paid for those.&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not going to win this one. Let&#39;s just drop it.&quot; Kelly said as we left the store.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, let&#39;s go home and get you ready for the beach.&quot; Kelly said as we walked back home.<br />
<br />
We made it home and Kelly helped me unpack the clothes and put them away.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, are you excited to go to the beach with all my friends?&quot; Kelly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A little, but I&#39;m nervous Mom. What if they don&#39;t like me?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, they&#39;ll love you. Don&#39;t worry. Now, go get dressed and we&#39;ll leave. And don&#39;t call me Mom anymore, even in private, now you&#39;re just my new friend that may become something more~&quot; Kelly said as she shooed me upstairs.<br />
<br />
I went upstairs and changed into the bikini and the silver short shorts, just to cover my ass, which I was kinda self-conscious of.<br />
<br />
I went downstairs and Kelly was waiting for me.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ready?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I think so.&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great. Let&#39;s go.&quot; She said as she took me outside and to the car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I invited some people to join us, and I&#39;ll let you guess who. We&#39;re gonna have a big time. Trust me.&quot; Kelly said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kelly, please, can you just tell me who we&#39;re meeting? You&#39;re starting to make me nervous.&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry. It&#39;ll be fun.&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. I guess. As long as it&#39;s not that crazy.&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be fine.&quot; Kelly said as she continued driving.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still a little worried.&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop worrying. We&#39;re here.&quot; She said as we arrived at the beach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who did you invite?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just follow me.&quot; She said as she led me towards the beach.<br />
<br />
&quot;There they are. Come on.&quot; Kelly said as we walked up to a group of women.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, everyone. I&#39;d like you all to meet my new friend, Sammy. Sammy, these are my friends. Lana, Elise, and Bridget. Emma and June had some other plans.&quot; Kelly said.<br />
<br />
I was nervous, but I did my best to smile and be friendly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi. Nice to meet you all.&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sammy? What kind of name is that? You&#39;re a mature woman. Shouldn&#39;t you have a more feminine name like Samantha?&quot; A tall blonde woman with large breasts and an hourglass figure, wearing a red bikini and sunglasses said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lana, don&#39;t be rude. She&#39;s still adjusting to her new life. Kelly said she&#39;s only been a mom for a few months, and her baby daddy left her before she even gave birth.&quot; Another woman, this one shorter with curly brown hair and a voluptuous body, wearing a dark blue one piece swimsuit, said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Come on. Be nice.&quot; A third woman, a black-haired, olive-skinned, busty and curvaceous woman wearing a white bikini, said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, I&#39;m just saying. She should have a better name.&quot; The blonde woman, Lana, said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should be ashamed. How can you say that?&quot; The short woman, Elise, said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? It&#39;s the truth.&quot; The blonde woman said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay. I was named after my mom, so I&#39;m used to it.&quot; I lied, trying to think of fake life stories to tell them all if they asked more about my life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry. We didn&#39;t know.&quot; The black-haired woman, Bridget, said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright.&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, how about we head to the water and go swimming? It&#39;ll be fun.&quot; Kelly suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good.&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too.&quot; The other women said.<br />
<br />
We all went down to the water and started swimming and splashing each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Sammy, what&#39;s it like being a hot single mom like the rest of us?&quot; Bridget, asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not bad. I&#39;m still getting used to it, but I like it. I could go without all the stares though.&quot; I said, hoping she didn&#39;t mean that in a way that she knew I was Kelly&#39;s stepson.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, me too.&quot; Elise said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re lucky. You&#39;ve got a great figure.&quot; Lana said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
We continued swimming and playing for a while until we decided to go get some food.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, let&#39;s go get something to eat.&quot; Kelly said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What would you like, Sammy?&quot; The short curly haired woman, Elise, asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, I&#39;m not sure.&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, there must be something you like.&quot; Elise said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really.&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, how about pizza? Everybody likes pizza.&quot; Lana said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pizza does sound good.&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, let&#39;s go.&quot; Kelly said as we all left the beach and headed to the nearest pizzeria.<br />
<br />
When we arrived, the women were all chatting amongst themselves.<br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of pizza do you want?&quot; Lana asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure. Maybe pepperoni?&quot; I replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good.&quot; Elise said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, then. Pepperoni pizza it is.&quot; Lana said as she ordered the pizza.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes, the pizza arrived, and we all dug in.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is delicious.&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Told ya you&#39;d like it.&quot; Lana said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it&#39;s very good.&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
After a few slices, we were all full.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m stuffed.&quot; Lana said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too.&quot; Elise agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m good too.&quot; Kelly said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, me too.&quot; Bridget said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about you, Sammy? You done?&quot; Lana asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, I&#39;m done.&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let&#39;s go.&quot; Kelly said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, where are we going?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My place.&quot; Kelly replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; I asked, confused as to why she&#39;s want people back over to the house when there&#39;s a full room of my old manly stuff.<br />
<br />
&quot;So we can have some fun. We&#39;re gonna have a sleepover.&quot; She replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, come on. It&#39;ll be fun.&quot; Kelly said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, okay.&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yay! Now come on, let&#39;s go.&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
We left the pizzeria and all got back into our respective cars to head back to my house, or is it just Kelly&#39;s house now?<br />
<br />
&quot;This is gonna be so much fun.&quot; Kelly said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it will.&quot; I said, excited to finally have fun with Kelly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it will. We&#39;re gonna have a great time. Trust me.&quot; Kelly said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure about that?&quot; I asked, worried that Kelly was trying to set me up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I&#39;m sure. Don&#39;t worry. You&#39;ll have fun. Now come on, let&#39;s get ready. Besides, you&#39;ve always wanted to be at an all girls sleepover.&quot; Kelly said as she got out of the car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, we&#39;ll be back with our clothes Kelly.&quot;<br />
Bridget said as her, Elise, and Lana all continued to drive further up the street.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. We&#39;ll be ready for you.&quot; Kelly said as she and I walked inside and closed the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ready for a night of fun?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I guess so.&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on. Let&#39;s get ready.&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
We both went upstairs and into her room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, let&#39;s pick out some clothes.&quot; Kelly said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;First, what&#39;s your favorite color?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, yellow, maybe.&quot; I replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, then how about this.&quot; She said as she pulled out a yellow t-shirt and a pair of shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess.&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, now put them on.&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
I got undressed and changed into the clothes which barely covered any of my large body. And when I looked up, I saw Kelly had changed into a lacy red nightgown showing a lot of her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow. You look amazing.&quot; Kelly said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think so?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely. Come on, let&#39;s get downstairs and get ready for the other girls.&quot; She said.</p>
