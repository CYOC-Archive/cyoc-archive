<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Nick, or whoever this guy actually was, drew closer, I desperately grabbed the handle of the drawer and attempted to pull it open while spinning around. What actually happened, however, was that my sweaty hand fumbled the handle, my awkward new arms which felt all together like noodles twisted incorrectly, and my pirouette landed me on my ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;You idiot, what are you doing!&quot; Nick screamed, lunging forward, a fist poised to strike me.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Mercy! Please, don&#39;t hurt me!&quot; I begged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, you coward. I won&#39;t hurt you. But I need to know you&#39;ll leave well enough alone.&quot; He glared at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yes.&quot; I stammered. &quot;I won&#39;t say a word about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You should get ready to go. I trust you remember the way to Nick&#39;s house?&quot; He said coldly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I d-do... Wait... you can&#39;t really leave me like this though!&quot; I pleaded. I gestured down at my much skinnier, wimpier body.<br />
<br />
&quot;On the contrary, &#39;Nick&#39; I can and will. And here&#39;s the kicker. This body-&quot; He gestures at his own &quot;-is going away. My nephew may be a handsome lad, but he&#39;s far too conspicuous and even I believe in letting his memory rest. So if you think you&#39;ll find this face in a crowd, you&#39;re wrong. If you think you&#39;ll find the socks on a rack somewhere like you did before, you are so very wrong. And most of ALL, poor little nerdy &#39;NICK&#39; you will never, ever leave that body.&quot; The Mad Impostor cackled with glee, making sure to drive home my powerlessness to stop it.<br />
<br />
&quot;But why... I wouldn&#39;t even try to stop you. I had my fun... Now I just want to be me again, you can have the socks and all the shoes I got for them. I didn&#39;t even get to try them myself.&quot; I bargained.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you see this is perfect. You stay as this geek, which prevents his parents from asking around. And when your body is reported missing, well there&#39;s a strange quirk in the justice system... people care a lot more about children than they do adults. By the time your sad, wretched body is reported missing, I&#39;ll be miles away... and in a form no one would ever suspect. And you, you&#39;d do well to play your part. Shall I explain, you dolt?&quot; He jeered. &quot;Swap clothes with me, by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-why?&quot; I asked, terror rippling through my already quaking body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because, kids you say &#39;but I&#39;m actually a 50 year old man trapped in a kids body&#39; go to the loony bin. And if you think being a teen boy going through puberty and high school isn&#39;t hard enough, now imagine being tossed into a mental hospital clucking about saying you&#39;re someone else altogether.&quot; The Impostor said, darkly.<br />
<br />
&quot;But they have to believe me... I&#39;ll tell them things no one else could possibly know!&quot; I cried, desperately.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps... But that&#39;s a pretty big &#39;if.&#39;&quot; He snarled. &quot;If they believe you, even then... what happens? You go on the hunt for... who? You already know I won&#39;t look like this. So you&#39;ll have no leads except for the socks. And if you think I&#39;d wear those out anywhere, well you&#39;re as dumb as a brick. And then you&#39;d also alienate Nick&#39;s parents. On the off chance they believe you aren&#39;t their child... will they house a 50 year old man masquerading as their precious little boy?&quot; The Mad Impostor postulated. <br />
<br />
&quot;So... basically I have to be this &#39;Nick Sinclair&#39; or else I die, or I become locked up in a psych ward?&quot; I asked, the realizations dawning on me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, exactly. I am glad you are picking it up now. So get your stuff... and leave.&quot; He hissed.<br />
<br />
I had no choice. In this body, I was a weakling. I was uncoordinated and clumsy. I could hardly see if the glasses I now needed were knocked off my face too. I was literally a high school geek now and it seemed I would be that way for good. <br />
<br />
I gathered Nick&#39;s stuff, I guess mine now, and took off for his family home. It was dark and cold out, being so late. Although I had wandered about late at night as myself, I felt surprisingly vulnerable now. No one would have kidnapped adult me, but I supposed someone might snap up a teen boy. It was definitely far-fetched, but I suppose that was where my mind was going... assuming all the worst possibilities.<br />
<br />
Indeed, even my physiological responses were confirming what I was feeling in a way. For one, although I am wearing the sweatshirt Nick wore over to my house, I could feel the biting cold of night through it. The thin, awkward limbs and flat tummy of this body provided no natural protection from the cold, and even only halfway to my new home, I was shivering. What&#39;s worse is I didn&#39;t even feel the youthful energy of the other teen body. It was likely that body was at least somewhat active, with a bit of muscle and fat to fill out his frame. This body was just frail and weak in almost every way. My eyesight was atrocious in this form, too. I took them off for a moment to try and see, but even my hand was a blur inches in front of my face.<br />
<br />
The worst part was yet to come, because I was magnetically drawn to one room as soon as I arrived at Nicks. It was imperative to me that I put eyes to my own body. So I stumbled about looking for the bathroom, making sure not to disturb my new parents from their slumber. And with luck I was able to find the bathroom without too much trouble.<br />
<br />
I flicked on the lights in the small room, and a yellowy glow cascaded over me. I turned to the mirror, my eyes jammed shut to prolong the inevitable. After a few moments where I nearly twisted my guts into a knot, I threw my eyes open to look at myself properly.<br />
<br />
It was like a grimmer replay of the first transformation. I looked at my face, appraising each feature one by one. Dark green eyes, behind thick glasses in rectangular, silvery frames. Parted dark hair, that gave a conservative, nerdy framing to the slightly acne-dusted forehead below and behind the bangs. The noise a small mousy thing sat nestled above a small, thin mouth that hid slightly bucked-teeth. I realized when I opened my mouth that the teeth bore braces, and that above everything else truly sealed the absoluteness of this transformation.<br />
<br />
Flicking my tongue over my braces, I looked at my clothes. A two-tone zip-up sweatshirt over a simple black t-shirt wasn&#39;t the worst look. I at least could control the clothing, and maybe the hair to some degree. I also had jeans on, and underneath that briefs. I pulled off the sweatshirt and the jeans, and revealed my new torso. Looking in the mirror... I realized I really was a high school nerd. The glasses, the pathetic body... this was going to be rough.<br />
<br />
I swiped across my body in frustration, my thumb trailing my stomach when I suddenly felt something. My skin felt extremely sensitive... my member jumped to attention. It was bizarre, but it seemed this body was sensitive to slight touch or tickling... or maybe transformations always build up some level of sexual energy? Whatever the case, I had to make it back to my new room and take care of this.</p>
