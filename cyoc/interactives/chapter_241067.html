<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You knock on the door. It takes a second but eventually you hear a gruff voice shout from the other side. “WHAT DO YA WANT?!”<br />
<br />
“Uh, I&#39;m here to fix your leaky shower?” You say in a concerned way.<br />
<br />
“YEAH! IT&#39;S BEEN LEAKING FOR A FEW MONTHS NOW! WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN!?” The door swings open very violently and slams against the door stopper, luckily not damaging the wall. Standing before you is a very angry old man. Bent over the way he is makes it hard to judge his actual height and his clothes are too loose and all-covering to tell his physique. He quickly leaves the front door and marches over to the main bathroom. He points into the room. “FIX IT!” He shouts.<br />
<br />
You amble past the small living room and kitchen. You look around and see lots of military memorabilia. Has this guy been to war or is he just a fan? You also see a couple guns. Old and hung up on the wall but still disconcerting. You walk past the man as he huffs at you, placing your toolbox on the floor. He grumbles something under his breath and goes back to the living room to watch television.<br />
<br />
You look at the faucet. It just needs to be tightened up. You do that and it immediately stops dripping. Thinking about how you are going to change this man makes you come up empty. He is kinda just an ass. You grab your keys and step out into the living room. The man is already asleep, lying in a shitty chair in an equally shitty apartment. You point the keys at him and click lock with nothing really in mind except the environment around you and your pent up horniness.<br />
<br />
After the flash dissipated, all that was sitting in the chair was a foot tall nutcracker in old-fashioned soldier garb. You shrug. Good enough for a start. Picking him up, you notice that his lever isn&#39;t on his back like you&#39;d expect. Instead a small gap in the front of the uniform pulls forward and down to make it look like his cock is out. This lever opens and closes his mouth. You jiggle it around a bit, as you think out what to do with him. Suddenly you notice a bit of slipperiness on the fingers fondling his lever. Inspecting your fingers and the lever show a translucent sweet-smelling lubricant. Is he actually aware of what is going on and… enjoying it? You quickly hit yourself with the keys to give yourself the ability to read minds.<br />
<br />
*Oh. Why&#39;d you stop you giant sexy fuck. I was getting close. It&#39;s been so long since I had a man touch me in that way. I don&#39;t even care about being paralyzed like this if you would at least let me get off to you.* You look down at the doll in awe. Your fingers rub together and begin working the “shaft” of the wooden soldier once again. *OH! THAT&#39;S THE TICKET, SOLDIER! GOD IF ONLY I COULD SHOW YOU HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE THIS! OH FUCK!*<br />
<br />
You stop again, despite his mental protests. You place him on the ground standing up. Gripping your key, you fire at him with the trunk button, putting to mind some machinations. The nutcracker began growing back to full size. As he did, several changes overcame his wooden form; His uniform poofed up into an actual set of fabric that wasn&#39;t just painted on; His hands grew from simple spheres to more complex blocky jointed hands; His body reshaped itself into a more realistic silhouette of a bulky soldier. The last thing that changed was his head which lost a bit of roundness but kept its general form and function. His hair still looked to be nothing but fabric attached with pin holes and glue but now it formed a true salt and pepper mustache and goatee with bits of synthetic body hair as well on his chest and arms.<br />
<br />
“Ah. This feels… Like being young again.” He rubbed his squared fingers along his wooden barreled chest. “No pain. No weakness. Just a strong, solid body.” He sighed in relief. Then he looked over to you. “And to think, it&#39;s all thanks to the sexy old man I was so rude to.” He leans into you and lifts you slightly off the ground. He is stronger than you had assumed given he was a wooden toy no more than a few seconds ago.<br />
<br />
Once he puts you down you immediately start taking off your overalls. Your fat form juggles as it is released from the form fitting clothing. The soldier follows suit, removing the fabric covering his painted wooden body. As his pants fall to be around his boots, you notice the same lever setup sitting at his crotch. You grope at it and are rewarded with a moan and a glob of lubricant. You turn the toy man around and find a perfectly cylindrical hole between the joints at his hips. You bend him over his chair, slather your cock in the lubricant and lower yourself into the man&#39;s hole. Disappointingly it&#39;s an easy fit. Without the fleshy pressure, a hole isn&#39;t all that useful for getting off.<br />
<br />
Then he pulls his own lever. Suddenly the hole your dick is inside pulsates. He yanks it back up. It pulsates again. Soon both of you are moaning as his mechanism pleasures you. You wrap your arms around his surprisingly warm chest as you hump the incredible sex machine. As you stroke his chest, you feel two raised buttons where his nipples are. Pushing them in causes the man to grunt with a hollow reverb and his back to open up to show his inner workings.<br />
<br />
“Oh. Oh god. That&#39;s better.” He says half moaning. You can feel the heat coming off his various gears and rods. The lubricant is plentiful in there keeping the man well oiled. As you look into the man&#39;s internals, your eye catches on a small crank. It turns slowly by itself but seems very easy to make it go faster. You reach in and turn the crank yourself. “Ooahh”<br />
<br />
“Aaah. &#9829;” You echo the hollow man as he redoubled his stroking on his wooden cock, sending his hole into even higher levels of pleasuring you. You crank faster. This wonder-filled sex engine is practically revving. Before long you just can&#39;t hold out anymore and ejaculate deep into the quivering wooden hole. The resulting moan from the beautiful toy and the gush of translucent tan liquid, showing he too had cum.<br />
<br />
You held the man tight and took a small taste of the tan substance. It was a sweet, nutty taste like pecan pie filling. He slowly closed his own back panel before replacing his rod back against his crotch. “God. that was wonderful. We should do that again sometime soon.” He slowly got out from under you. As soon as he was free he snapped to attention. “Captain Lorraine reporting. What are your next orders, General?”<br />
<br />
“Hmm…” You slowly take everything back in. The room is still adorned with military medals, tech and guns, though now several of them are obviously merely large toy parts. You also see a couple of framed pictures of the Captain in the army and at least one with whom is presumably his wife and daughter. All edited to include the new nutcracker man you see before you. “Do you have a wife and daughter… Captain?”<br />
<br />
“Not anymore, sir. Wife has been dead for 10 years. My daughter is currently living in North Dakota and doesn&#39;t see me very often, sir”<br />
<br />
“I see… Well in that case would you mind me moving you and your apartment?”<br />
<br />
“Not at all, sir.” You go over to him and press his nose. Suddenly the man collapses back down into an immobile nutcracker. Perfect. You lift him up, wrap him in a cloth and set him in your toolbox. Once he is safe, you open the maintenance app and move on to the next apartment, locking the door behind you.</p>
