<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The group dragged their feet through the endless jungle. The trees looked identical, with similar patterns of branches coldly reaching out towards the path they walked along. The sun poured its heat as if it was liquid metal. Benji felt like he was going to melt. His newfound energy had eventually transformed into exhaustion, forcing him to trod along in the middle of the group. He found himself walking alongside Reggie, whose typical outfit of an oversized shirt and trousers remained unchanged, despite the hostile climate. The man’s clothes looked completely dry, absent of any sweat patches. Benji wished he could have said the same.<br />
<br />
The whiteness of the boy’s vest had darkened as the day progressed. The wetness of the fabric only tightened around his torso. It left a small portion of Benji’s stomach exposed, allowing some of his abs and a treasure trail stretch out into the thick jungle air. The gold necklace was hidden underneath the vest, resting comfortable between the teen’s pecs. He was dumbfounded at how much his clothes had shrunk, or rather how much he had grown. Benji’s shorts left very little to the imagination. They once reached his knees, and now barely covered his thighs. Unfortunately for him, there was no way to effectively hide his boner, which bulged out obscenely and refused to go down. Benji had never been hornier, the constant rush of hormones only making his hardon more ferocious. It had grown even more during the day, and having such a large appendage in such a tiny prison began to hurt. Benji needed to do something. He checked behind him; the twins were too busy re-organising their backpacks to watch him. Alistair was way too far ahead to even notice. Finally, he made sure Reggie’s attention was fixed on that map. Then, as quickly as he could, he reached in and re-adjusted his shorts. His ass tensed as the fabric grinded against it. He breathed a sigh of relief as he no longer felt any discomfort. The outline still looked obvious. He thought he was in the clear, until-<br />
<br />
“You know you don’t have to wear what he tells you, especially when it doesn’t fit.”<br />
<br />
Benji quickly held his hands over his crotch, seeing Reggie glancing at him under his glasses. The man laughed as he looked back at the map.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone.”<br />
“Thank you.”<br />
<br />
Benji, embarrassed, kept his manhood out of view, growing red as he felt it throb beneath his palms. Reggie’s voice could be heard from behind the map.<br />
<br />
“I bet you didn’t think exploring would be 90% walking, and 10% actually exploring.”<br />
“I’m used to it. My dad used to take me on long walks across the hills. There was never really a destination, just walking. I kinda liked it.”<br />
“I’m sorry about what happened. Alistair told me. He seemed like an alright bloke.”<br />
“Yeah, he was…”<br />
<br />
Benji found himself drifting off, the familiar shapes of the hills that surrounded his childhood home played back in his mind like a film reel. Reggie folded the map up, and took his glasses off, cleaning them with his shirt.<br />
<br />
“So why did you join?”<br />
<br />
Benji paused for a moment, taking the question in. His breathing suddenly grew quick, and shallow. <br />
<br />
“A lot of reasons, but mainly I just like the walk.”<br />
<br />
Reggie let out a chuckle as the two locked eyes, sharing a brief moment together before Benji broke away. <br />
<br />
“What about you? What made you want to become an explorer?”<br />
“Me? Oh, I don’t know. It’s just nice to get away from home. Away from everything…”<br />
<br />
Reggie’s voice drifted off. Benji turned to realise the man had stopped walking, gazing longingly at the floor. After a few seconds Reggie jolted, shifting his eyeline to Benji’s muscular body. He quickly unfolded the map and buried his face into it as he continued walking.<br />
<br />
“Anyway, once we get back to civilisation I expect there’ll be plenty more assignments for us. You’ll be an experienced explorer in no time.”<br />
<br />
The two smiled at each other. Benji felt the straps to his rucksack slowly slide off him, and so used both hands to hold them in place, his tented shorts in full view. Just then Alistair approached the two, his face bright red and lamented with sweat. Benji couldn’t help admire his physique, whilst Reggie felt a twinge of worry at the man’s sudden appearance.<br />
<br />
“Reginald, where are we?! We should be back at the village by now.”<br />
“Apologies sir. The map says it’s this way.”<br />
“How long now?”<br />
“A few more hours.”<br />
<br />
Alistair sighed with frustration, and leant on a tree trunk. Benji felt two large shadows cast over him. The twins had caught up, their breaths falling onto the teen’s shoulders. Alistair dropped his axe. He was tired. They all were.<br />
<br />
“Right, rest here for a bit lads. Where are you off to Benjamin?”<br />
“I just need the toilet.”<br />
“Again? That’s the sixth time today. Anything we should be worried about?”<br />
“N-no sir.”<br />
“Very well, don’t wander off now.”<br />
<br />
Benj hurled his rucksack into the ground and practically ran into the jungle. He could feel his balls ache in his shorts. The moment he was out of sight he leant against a tree trunk and pulled his cock out into the open.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit!”<br />
<br />
He said aloud. His member had grown considerably since the morning. It was easily a foot long, and thicker too. It wouldn’t be long until it was too thick for Benji to fully wrap his fingers around. It throbbed under his grip as he worked the shaft desperately. A short of his precum spurted out, smacking a tree log. It felt like Benji hadn’t jerked off in months. He writhed about in pleasure against the tree. He let out a huge groan as he could feel he was getting closer, and closer, until-<br />
<br />
“Hey, we heard noises coming from here so Alistair sent me to-WOAH!”<br />
<br />
Benji crooked his head to see Reggie standing there with his jaw wide open. He stared in awe at the teen’s member. Just as the boy went to stop and reach for his shorts, he knew it was too late.<br />
<br />
“OHHH FUCK!”<br />
<br />
He thrusted his hips as load after load of his seed shot out like bullets, flying a few metres before splattering the jungle floor. All Reggie could do was watch. When Benji finally stopped, he almost lost his balance, his knees weak. Allistair’s voice could be heard in the background.<br />
<br />
“Is everything alright Reginald?”<br />
<br />
Benji looked helplessly into Reggie’s eyes, before the man turned his head.<br />
<br />
“Everything’s alright! He’s just finishing up!”<br />
<br />
Reggie started walking back to the group, only to feel his hand being grabbed by Benji. The boy still had his shorts around his ankle. Reggie took a second, taking in the sight of the buff, mostly naked teen before him. Benji’s cock was still hard, ready for another round.<br />
<br />
“Please d-“<br />
“Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone.”<br />
“Thank you I..I’m sorry. I can’t control it, it’s like I’m always…h-hello?”<br />
<br />
Reggie stared behind the boy, drawn to a sunray that lit up a small opening in a thicket. Small blades of grass littered the opening, as the man drew closer, he laid his eyes upon a familiar sight. He traveled through the thicket.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Alistair and the twins waited on the main path, sitting on one of the large rocks that protruded from the jungle floor. Matt and Tom were massaging their leader, rubbing his toned shoulder blades and legs with glee. They had somehow persuaded him to take off his vest and ‘enjoy the heat.’ As the three shirtless men waited, they could hear a peculiar sound amongst the usual soundscape of the jungle. The sounds of twigs snapping, as if someone was stepping on them. They looked into the jungle to see no one there, except for a few broken twigs. Alistair grew nervous, and impatient.<br />
<br />
“Bloody hell, where are the boys.”<br />
“They’re probably off, y’know…”<br />
<br />
Matt smiled at his twin. Alistair waved his had dismissively.<br />
<br />
“Nonsense. The boy wouldn’t do something like that. He’s always been the reserved one, and Reggie’s nowhere near as bold as the two of you.”<br />
“That’s true sir.”<br />
“Quite right sir.”<br />
<br />
Then, just as Matt’s hands were about to slide up Alistair’s thigh, the sound of another branch snapping pierced their ears, as they drew their vision into the jungle. The could see movement from behind the trees. Then, Reggie and Benji stepped out from the shade. The boy had one hand on his crotch, and the other holding onto Reggie, who guided him across the terrain without falling over. He was carrying something shiny. Alistair stood up and put his hands on his hips, scowling at the pair.<br />
<br />
“What took you two so long?”<br />
“Sorry sir. We found this on the way back. Here.”<br />
<br />
Reggie handed his leader a bracer made out of solid gold. On it were similar symbols to that of Benji’s necklace, except it looked heavily worn. It was littered with small dents and scratches, however it still shone under the sun. Alistair studied it closely as Reggie continued.<br />
<br />
“We found it in a clearing exactly like the one where we found that necklace. Same stone pillar, same type of grass. Everything. There must be more scattered around the jungle.”<br />
“What makes you think that?”<br />
“Well it looks like we’ve got two pieces of some sort of outfit. Maybe some armour worn by the tribe? There have to be more out here. We could even find the whole set!”<br />
<br />
The twins inspected the bracer as Alistair thought deeply, sitting back down on the rock. Benji notice a trail of sweat slide between the man’s shoulder blades. After about a minute, Alistair stood up, wiping the sweat off his chest. Benji could feel his member already in need of another release. <br />
<br />
“How much food do we have left Matthew.”<br />
“About a week if we ration.”<br />
“And water?”<br />
“The same.”<br />
<br />
Another pause. Reggie waited with bated breath. The leader inhaled deeply.<br />
<br />
“Right, I say we find a clearing and set up camp for tonight. Then, tomorrow morning we’ll split up into search parties and find the rest of them! Even if we don’t find anything, it’s worth a shot. Has everyone got that?”<br />
<br />
The boys all nodded silently. Alistair smiled.<br />
<br />
“If we find the whole set, we’ll be heroes! Now, let’s get going. Reginald, look after this one.”<br />
<br />
Alistair chucked the bracer to Reggie before speeding off into the jungle with a new sense of determination, forgetting the vest he left on the rock. The twins followed after him with their heavy rucksacks. Reggie wrapped the bracer around his wrist, and as it clamped down he felt a sudden rush of energy. He turned to the teen.<br />
<br />
“C’mon, we don’t wanna be at the back of the group!”<br />
<br />
And so, grabbing Benji’s arm, the two ran towards the others. After a short while, once they were out of sight, a large figure crept out from behind a tree. It approached Alistair’s vest, and picked it up. Then, like a flash, it and the vest were gone.</p>
