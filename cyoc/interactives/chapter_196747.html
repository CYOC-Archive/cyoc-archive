<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vicky felt ridiculous.  The outfit Sam had shoved her into was way too sexy for her little girl body.  She was wearing skinny black jeans and a long sleeved shirt that let her shoulders bare.  The strap and the top of a lacy black bra were visible, and she was wearing a white plastic hairband.  At least Sam had agreed heels would be a disaster, so Vicky was wearing a pair of white canvas shoes.<br />
<br />
Sam, on the other hand, was wearing a short-sleeved white top that barely covered her breasts, a super tiny black skirt, and thigh-high black leggings, leaving a portion of her upper thighs uncovered, something she called &quot;the absolute zone&quot;, whatever that meant.  Her toned abdomen and healthy tan were on full display, and she was getting a lot of attention.<br />
<br />
Vicky simply tried to hide in her friend&#39;s shadow, hoping no one would ask why she was carrying a duffel bag around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.  My God.  Who invited you two?&quot;  Alison, one of Georgia&#39;s friends, walked up to them.<br />
<br />
Sam just smiled.  &quot;Brad did, of course.  This is his party, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alison bared her teeth.  &quot;Why would he invite a tomboy and a baby to a party?&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then, Brad Morgan walked up and put an arm around Sam&#39;s shoulders.  &quot;Hey Sam, glad you could make it!&quot;  He gave her a kiss on the cheek.  &quot;And wow, you managed to get Vicky here?  Vick, you should dress up more often, you look cute as hell!&quot;<br />
<br />
Vicky just blushed at the attention.  Brad may be a jock and a frat boy, but he was handsome and super nice.  Even if she didn&#39;t have any real physical attraction to him (well, maybe a tiny little bit), it felt good to be treated like a human.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey now, I thought you were dating me?  Are you hitting on my roomie now?&quot;  Sam gave Brad a light punch in the arm, and he winced.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, I don&#39;t want you to try and fold me in half!  Oh hey, Alison, you know Sam and Vicky, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alison looked like she&#39;d just bit into a salted lemon.  &quot;You&#39;re...dating...Samantha?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, well we have a lot in common.  Anyways, go enjoy yourself, I&#39;m going to show Sam off.  Vicky, stay close, we&#39;ll keep any sharks from snapping you up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alison walked off in a huff, and Brad chuckled.  &quot;That felt good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It did!  You know she&#39;s going straight to Georgia, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad nodded.  &quot;Of course she is.  Georgia has only been asking me to go out with her for weeks.  But I won&#39;t be another notch in her belt.  She&#39;s had just about every guy I know, if you can believe locker room chatter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, she&#39;ll probably get pregnant or catch a disease.  I mean, other than her Bitch-itis.&quot;  Sam laughed.<br />
<br />
Vicky was quiet.  As much as she hated Georgia, she found herself not liking the way they were talking about her.<br />
<br />
She eventually detached herself from Sam and her new boyfriend, and sat on a couch, alone.  That&#39;s when Georgia came up to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe they let children into a place with alcohol.&quot;  She sneered.<br />
<br />
&quot;What difference does it make?  You&#39;re not 21 yet.&quot;  Vicky replied, noticing the glass of beer in Georgia&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well at least I have the body of an adult!  You look like you&#39;re 11~&quot;<br />
<br />
Vicky just shook her head.  &quot;Sure, sure.  So are you here to bully me?  Maybe dump your drink on my head?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh!  You&#39;re such a doormat!  Would it kill you to stand up for yourself for once?  Anyways, I&#39;m here to ask about your trashy slut roommate.  How long has she been hanging on Brad  like that?  I can&#39;t believe he&#39;s dating her!  She must put out on the first date.  Does she let him fuck her in that dump truck ass?&quot;<br />
<br />
Georgia started seeing red.  Despite her mixed feelings about Georgia, she was insulting Sam, and that could not stand!  Getting up to her full height of 10 inches shorter than Georgia (actually shorter, if you take the taller girl&#39;s heels into account), she gave Georgia a swift kick to her ankle.<br />
<br />
Vicky wasn&#39;t strong, but it was simply applied physics.  Georgia lost her balance due to her stupidly high heels, and fell flat on her ass, spilling her beer all over herself.  Vicky didn&#39;t stop there, and she slapped Georgia as hard as she could.  Which wasn&#39;t hard, but the sound caused everyone to turn and look in their direction.<br />
<br />
&#39;You fucking whore!  How DARE you!  Everyone knows you&#39;ve let half the football team gang bang you, and you want to call MY FRIEND a slut?!  You must have every STD on the planet!  No guy would want to touch your diseased cunt, let alone stick their dick in it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Vicky had never been so furious in her life!  She expected Georgia to get up and kick her ass, but instead, she got a very different reaction.  Georgia&#39;s eyes were wide, and she looked near tears as she scooted backwards on her behind.  <br />
<br />
Alison and the other cheerleaders quickly showed up, helping Georgia to her feet and shielding her from Vicky.  Alison was about to deliver a mighty slap, when her wrist was caught in a grip like a vice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me you weren&#39;t about to hit my friend?&quot;  Sam made that low growling sound again, and even though Vicky still found it sexy as hell, it apparently had a very different effect on Alison.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let go, you&#39;re hurting me!&quot;  Alison whined.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh this is hurting you?  What a delicate little flower you are!  So how does this feel, then?&quot;  Sam tightened her grip, and Vicky thought she heard bones grinding.<br />
<br />
Alison screamed, and then Brad was there.  &quot;Ok Sam, that&#39;s enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam let go, and Alison backed away.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I told you all not to fuck with Vicky if she came tonight.  One simple rule, and you couldn&#39;t manage to not be bitches for a few hours.  Go clean Georgia up, and get out.&quot;  He crossed his arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;You...you can&#39;t make us leave!  If we leave, everyone will come with us!&quot;  Brandy, another one of Georgia&#39;s minions, protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that so?  Joe, are you leaving?&quot; <br />
<br />
Joe, who was a fullback, and Brandy&#39;s date, shook his head. &quot;No way, Cap.&quot;<br />
<br />
One by one, Brad called on his teammates, some of whom were dating the cheerleaders.  To a man, they said they would stay.  There were a few comments of &quot;bros before hoes&quot; from the team.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well there you have it.  The only people leaving are you bitches.  Now git!&quot;<br />
<br />
The cheerleaders retreated to the bathroom with their sodden captain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Vick, are you ok?&quot;  Sam held her friend by her shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y...yeah.  I&#39;m ok.&quot;  She was shaking though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus, Vicky.  You&#39;re a real tiger when you&#39;re mad.  Where was all that fire every other time Georgia was a bitch to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...I don&#39;t know.  She was saying bad stuff about you...&quot;  Vicky mumbled.<br />
<br />
She was rewarded with a kiss on the forehead.  &quot;Dummy.  You were the one telling me not to beat her ass!&quot;  She smiled though.  <br />
<br />
And just like that, the party got back into swing.<br />
<br />
Once all eyes were off her, however, Vicky slipped to the bathroom.  She heard Georgia sobbing from inside.  Too bad for her, her life was about to get worse.  She pulled out the Lesbianizer.  She was going to blast the lot of them when they came out.  But at what setting?</p>
