<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Young Dahlia, as she was known around her realm, was the youngest sister of the highly respected twin siblings, Sister Lydia and Brother Emmanuel. Being that they were both second-in-command to the Lord herself, their youngest sister had to be placed in check. <br />
Despite their best efforts, Young Dahlia was a hot-headed, easily jealous and particularly gloomy individual, more akin to a human than a demon. So to fit their needs as second-in-command, they decided to let her live within the human realm, disguised as one of them.<br />
The twins had left Young Dahlia so long, quickly forgetting about her as they climbed the ranks and becoming some of the most recognisable and respected in their realm. What they didn’t account for was the fact that Young Dahlia would begin to develop as a human, with the emotions and drama that came with it.<br />
Although she could her powers under control, that didn’t mean she’d keep her emotions the same. After a number of fights and arguments across her adolescent life (all of which she would inevitably turn out victorious), nothing prepared her for the worst mistake any human has ever made.<br />
<br />
— — —<br />
<br />
“Hey Timmy!!” Dahlia called from her boyfriends front door, slamming it behind her. She held a pizza box in her hand, “you’ll never guess I brought for us!” She said.<br />
She was suddenly greeted by Timothy’s mother, “hello Dahlia, so pleased to see you again,”<br />
“Thanks,” Dahlia said blankly. She was never much of a family person and never really liked Timothy’s parents, let alone his annoying little brother… or sister now,<br />
“Timmy’s up in his room with a friend, you might want to knock first,” his mother said. Dahlia was immediately caught off guard by this statement,<br />
“Excuse me?” She said, puzzled, making eye contact with Timothy’s mother for what could easily be the first time in her whole life,<br />
“Y-yes… he went up with someone a little earlier,”<br />
“Who.” Dahlia asked, fire seemingly burning in her eyes, jealously building,<br />
“I-it’s…” she stammered, getting more and more uncomfortable as Dahlia’s stare became even more intense,<br />
“WHO!?” Dahlia demanded an answer, almost dropping the box of pizza she held in her hands,<br />
<br />
“Uh-uh… NICO!” Timothy mother yelled, holding her hands up to her face as if preparing for some kind of explosion,<br />
“Oh okay,” Dahlia said, suddenly very calm. Without saying anything else she walked upstairs, no apologies or condolences, simply disappearing into the second half of the house.<br />
<br />
“Timmy?” Dahlia called out, approaching her boyfriends room, “I heard your nerdy little friend is over,” she said idly, “I know you probably want to play those little virtual games but you gotta ask him to leave, it’s our time now!” She said, expecting him to always do what she asked… which is usually what he did.<br />
She finally got to his bedroom door, hearing quite the calamity from inside. The sound of things being thrown onto the ground, bedsheets being waved around and an odd number of whispers… that didn’t seem right.<br />
She burst open the door!<br />
<br />
“Heeeeeeyy!” Timothy said awkwardly, lying on his bed… obviously hiding something. He could tell she was already suspicious, it was painted all over her face. Her eyes.<br />
“Don’t ruin the surprise!” Nico said from right behind her, making her jump in the process, “you’re gonna wait to see this!” He said with an energy she’d never seen before, even from this weirdo,<br />
“What in the hell’s is going on here?” She asked Timothy,<br />
“You’re gonna need a minute,” he said, “w-we’ve got something planned for you! Just you! No one else!” He said incredibly awkwardly.<br />
As much as Dahlia did not want to mess around with Timothy’s weird little friend, she was definitely intrigued by the idea.<br />
<br />
“Alright fine,” she said, defeated, “but don’t make this too long,” she finished, prepared to do what they asked,<br />
“Alright! Cover your eyes.” Timothy said very simply,<br />
“Why?” She asked quickly,<br />
“Because it’ll ruin the surprise!”<br />
“Fine,” she said. She approached the bed and placed the pizza box right in front of Timothy. As she did, she heard a faint rustle from the bed, “uhm,” she said, looking at Timothy, his face had gone as pale as a sheep’s wool, “what was that?” She demanded,<br />
“It was me!” He blurted out, “I really need you to cover your eyes now!” He said, “please!”<br />
“FINE!” Dahlia growled. She slapped her hands against her face, blocking her vision completely.<br />
<br />
A variety of mumbling and shuffling began as Dahlia struggled to hide behind her increasing frustration,<br />
“Can I open my eyes yet?” She moaned,<br />
“NO!” Three voices said in a panic.<br />
Dahlia sighed, keeping her hands over her eyes, making sure that… wait a second… three voices?<br />
<br />
“THREE VOICES!?” Dahlia yelled, turning immediately to face all three of the voices. <br />
Stood by the doorway, almost entirely exited was Timothy, her boyfriend. Nico, her boyfriends annoying friend. And Blair McArthur, the girl with the biggest tits in school.<br />
Fuming, Dahlia screamed, “WHAT IN THE HELL’S IS GOING ON HERE!?”<br />
<br />
“SHE’S MY GIRLFRIEND, I SWEAR!” Nico yelled, grabbing Blair by her face pressing his lips against hers. She quickly pushed him off,<br />
“Get off me, asshole!” She groaned, but quickly looking directly into Dahlia’s anger-filled eyes, she grabbed Nico’s face again and kissed his one again, forcing a make-out with him.<br />
Despite everything, Dahlia looked over at her boyfriends face, seeing nothing but fear, confusion… and jealously.<br />
<br />
“Y-you…” Dahlia said, falling to her knees, staring at the ground in dismay, “I-I can’t… b-believe…”<br />
<br />
“Dahlia, it’s not what you think!” Timothy said, trying his best to convince her he truly wasn’t cheating on her. But he didn’t even make an effort to come close to her. To put his hand on her back, to look her in the eyes to console her.<br />
“I swear, I’m totally cheating on Nico!” Blair said, trying her best to make herself seem as innocent as possible, but messing it up even further in the process.<br />
“Seriously! You have to believe us, we’d never lie to you Dahlia!” Nico said, hammering the final nail into the coffin.<br />
<br />
“CHEATING!?” She screamed. Behind all three of them the door began to close on its own,<br />
“What the fu—”<br />
“LYING!?” The door slammed behind them. A sudden breeze began to pick up entirely in their room. It was insane. Unreal!<br />
“Dahlia, I-I!”<br />
“I’ve heard enough,” Dahlia said, the wind growing more and more intense. Dahlia began to stand up, her eyes pinned to the ground, but they weren’t normal. They were glowing… “ENOUGH!!” She screeched, causing all three to cover their ears.<br />
As they looked back at the young woman, if you could even call her that, they saw deep into her eyes, staring right into their souls.<br />
“You’re going to tell me EVERYTHING!” She demanded, the room glowing red as they watched Dahlia lift off of the ground, spreading her whole body outwards, glowing a dark silhouette of what she was.<br />
<br />
A monster.</p>
