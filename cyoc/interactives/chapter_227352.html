<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Preset 05 seemed to stick out to John. It would allow him to experience what he knew he was meant to be without giving up his human life or sentience. Turning into a penis for two days each month seemed to be rather frequent, but not so frequent that it would disrupt his life entirely. Before he committed to this, however, he wanted to know more about his old host. Since they were going to share a mental connection and be aware of each other during the process, John wanted to know if Nathan was a suitable partner for this, or if he should change Subject 002 to someone else. <br />
<br />
He started out with the usual social media snooping. He discovered that Nathan had moved on to be a college athlete at the local university John was planning to attend in the fall. John didn’t keep up with sports, so he hadn’t been aware of his high school cohort’s career. He seemed to be a very successful and talented quarterback on the school’s football team. Nathan would be a junior in the fall, whereas John would be a freshman. At least that would make their initial encounters easier. That thought made John realize that he would have to keep following Nathan for the rest of his life so that he could be near his host when that time of the month came. This almost made him reconsider, but he was too deep now and he wanted to see this through. <br />
<br />
Some additional digging turned up photos of Nathan at his fraternity house, pictures of him traveling to lots of different places—often even abroad—and a suspicious lack of pictures of him with any women besides his family. It wasn’t a guarantee, but someone as popular and good-looking as him usually had a partner by now, or at least exes that might show up in old pictures, but there was nothing. John had his suspicions but put that aside for a moment. He’d have to be able to travel with Nathan too, but that didn’t sound so bad. John had been working and saving up money during his year off, so he had a bit of dough to spare. It was supposed to go towards his loans, but he would have to make do. He realized the risks, but with a combination of his desperation to experience his origins and a teenage lack of foresight, he was too committed to be turned away now. <br />
<br />
His internet research didn’t turn up anything immediately alarming about his old and future host, and from what he could find it seemed that Nathan was a pretty normal guy, albeit a rich and privileged one. If there were someone he had to be the dick of, John supposed he could do worse. He only had one final thing to check before committing. By going into the settings for Subject 002, he was able to see Nathan’s stats, and what he came across was both surprising and enlightening. <br />
<br />
••••••••••••••••••••<br />
Chronivac 4.0 (trial version)<br />
<br />
Name: Nathan Goodwin (Subject 002)<br />
Species: Human&#8232;Sex: Male &#8232;Age: 21&#8232;Height: 6’-0”&#8232;Weight: 210lbs&#8232;Hair: Blonde&#8232;Eyes: Blue&#8232;Gender ID: Male&#8232;Sexuality: Homosexual (closeted)&#8232;Libido: High&#8232;Special Notes: previously changed by Chronivac 4.0 (full version), unaware of change<br />
••••••••••••••••••••<br />
Additional Stats Relevant to Subject 001<br />
<br />
Penis Length: 2” flaccid, 4” erect (formerly 5” flaccid, 10” erect)<br />
Penis Girth: 3” circumference (formerly 6” circumference)<br />
Testicle Size: 1.75”x0.5”x1” or 0.875ci (formerly 2.25”x1”x1.5” or 3.375ci)<br />
Semen Production: 0.34oz (formerly 2.4oz)<br />
Circumcised: No<br />
Sensitivity: Low (formerly High)<br />
Dominance: Submissive (formerly Dominant)<br />
••••••••••••••••••••<br />
<br />
So, Nathan was currently a bit underdeveloped. Judging by the stats though, he used to be very well endowed. He was changed by the Chronivac before, and John doubted that Nathan had willingly given up his pornstar level size, so that must mean that his mysterious benefactor was someone else. Nathan had no idea that he used to be so hung, and it seemed as though he would only be that way again as long as John was connected to him. <br />
<br />
Some other things stuck out to John as well, judging by the current and former stats of his host, it seemed Nathan had been quite the stereotypical jock before: big, arrogant and dominant. Now it seemed he was subdued and submissive, perhaps a sort of punishment for his old lifestyle. Interestingly, it seemed he was a closeted gay in both the old and current realities, something that ought to make their first encounter interesting. John wondered how he was going to get a closeted and submissive Nathan to penetrate him for the changes to occur, and decided to look into the presets further. According to the Chronivac, there was no downside to not being near Nathan or not being able to convince him to be the penetrator: it would happen regardless. It seemed that, no matter where John ended up on the night of the change, he would find his way to Nathan within 24 hours—perhaps by some unnatural means—and the changes would be irresistible whenever they met. <br />
<br />
John considered his options. If he stuck with Nathan, this was certainly going to be an interesting scenario. He was the piece that would complete Nathan as a stereotypical jock. And when he wasn’t busy being the guy’s dick, John might actually be able to be the dominant one in their relationship, which excited him. On the other hand, Nathan had clearly been punished for something he had done in his old life. Maybe he didn’t deserve to get that back and instead John should find a more worthy host to bequeath his impressive size to as a penis. One of his friends, maybe? He was going through with this either way, but who should he pick?</p>
