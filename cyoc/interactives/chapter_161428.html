<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite the back and leg pain Mike was marching next to the road very determined. The day went by, he wanted to check the time but it his watch was not on his wrist... he is missing that arm, but quicly noticed he has a watch on his right arm. Instead of the steel watch he used before it was a cheap watch with faded fake leather and scratched face.<br />
&quot;5 P.M. I walked about half a day now and not even traces of a town.&quot; frowned Mike.<br />
After another hour of walking he realized 2 things.<br />
First: he was able to walk hours in his old aged body most likely his soldier training made a lot of muscle under the layers of fat.<br />
Second: his chest was in pain. Quickly realizing that with the 1 week limit the not dieing part was gone too.<br />
He sat down in place taking a long break opened up one of the can (with a lot of problem considering he had no can opener and only one hand). The pain slowly faded the sun started to set and the food was... acceptable.<br />
Mike picked up his stuff and started walking again, this time slower watching his heart.<br />
Walking, deep in his thoughts he bumped into something.<br />
&quot;Well, this fat bumper is getting more and more handy.&quot; exclaimed while looking up.<br />
It was a commercial sign.<br />
            -Motel SandCastle-<br />
 -Cable, Washin machine, Cheap-<br />
                      -1 mile-<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot;<br />
Excited he sped up and in no time he was at the motel. Realizing the problem that he is homeless and most likely has no money.<br />
Going troughhis pockets he found a few bucks, but it was no where near enough for a room.<br />
&quot;... I hope at least they let me rent a washing machine. My clothes are reeking, and icky.&quot;<br />
It was already night and the office was lit like a christmas tree, made it easy to find it even without his glasses.<br />
Opening the door it was felt like a 5 star hotel. Not because of the looks it was a dirt simple, mainstream motel you would see in movies, insted the cool air the sound of a radio these was godsend after walking all day under the scorching sun and silence.<br />
At the desk was a 20ish year old woman, giving a suspicius look.<br />
&quot;Good evening, sir. Can I help you?&quot; asked the woman in a tired voice.<br />
&quot;Good Evening. Yes, could I use one of your washing machine?&quot; asked Mike with a very conserned face.<br />
&quot;Excuse me?&quot; the women picked up her head and her eyes just wide open.<br />
&quot;Not for free of course!&quot; said Mike trying to save the situation.<br />
&quot;Oh, that is different. Yes, sure we have washing machines in every room.&quot; pointing towards a white board explaining the prices.<br />
&quot;I-I don&#39;t have that kind of money. Can I just rent the machine? after the wash I would leave immediately.&quot; said mike torning back to the woman.<br />
&quot;No.&quot; said the woman as cold and quick as possible. &quot;If you can&#39;t pay please leave the building.&quot;<br />
Mike was disappointed, but understood it, he would do the same in her place.<br />
As he turned back towards the door to leave the woman shouted.<br />
&quot;Wait! Come closer.&quot;<br />
Mike dumbfounded just did what she said.<br />
The women touched his chest and pulled out a dog tag.<br />
&quot;My grandfather has the same dog tag.&quot;<br />
The dog tag was not the standard style. It had thicker edges and the color was dark gray instead of the normal steel.<br />
&quot;The platoon is the same. You served with my grandpa!&quot; she exclaimed excitedly.<br />
Mike was thinking about how she even noticed it. His shirt was unbuttoned sure, but with the forest of bodyhair in the way it was a miracle that she was able to see it.<br />
&quot;Maybe?&quot; said Mike unsurely.<br />
&quot;Totally! His name is David Sel...&quot;<br />
Mike didn&#39;t even heard the full name, but he didn&#39;t need to. Instantly his mind was flooding with new &quot;old&quot; memories of the guy he served with.<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, I remember now.&quot; said Mike while staring in front of him, still cruising in the memories.<br />
&quot;Gramps said he was blessed with his team...&quot; she put the dog tag back and looked in the eyes of Mike.<br />
&quot;Because of he I will give you a room for free until tomorrow noon.&quot; said while walking towards the keys on the wall.<br />
&quot;Are you sure. Aren&#39;t you going to get in trouble with the boss?&quot;<br />
&quot;I am the boss. Room 19.&quot; holding out her hand with the key in it.<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; said Mike trying to hold back his tears.<br />
 &quot;Good night.&quot; said the woman getting back to her business.<br />
The room was on the 2nd floor. Just seeing the stairs his knees started to hurt, but quickly went up on them.<br />
The room was as excepted from a motel in the middle of nowhere. Small bed (might be problem for his big body), black and white TV, a bathtub and the washing machine was almost as old as he now.<br />
&quot;Yeah now I understand why every room has one, these are probably cheaper than the room for a night.&quot;<br />
Mike started to undress putting all his clothes and the extra pair of underwear and shirt from his backpack.<br />
The washing started, he just sat in the bathtub let the lukewarm water fill the tub. It was fast considering Mike himself filled it pretty well.<br />
Relaxing  for the first time in almost 2 days he just popped another boner.<br />
&quot;Seriously? I was not this horny even when I was a teen.&quot; complaining while trying to reach his pubic area again.<br />
&quot;This ball of lard will surely make it compliceted to get out of the tub.&quot;</p>
