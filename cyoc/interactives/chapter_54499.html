<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Kimmy, how many girls are there in this house?&quot; Mike asked as he moved up the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;About twenty, I think, Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I've already done four, that leaves sixteen.  Count two for Pisces ... I would have enough to do a complete Zodiac set.  Hey can you do macros?  That might save some time.&quot;  Mike was bouncing as he made his way up the steps.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think that is going to work,&quot; Kimmy said sashaying her way behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got a real theme going here.  Big-bare tits, wild hair-colours and a few tid-bits from a creature or animal.&quot;  Mike looked back at Kimmy and smiled that such a hot girl was following him around.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems a little predictable actually,&quot; she said a little bored.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nonsense.  It's classic.  I'm giving these girls ready-made Halloween costumes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh.&quot;  Kimmy smirked at Mike and pushed him up the stairs.<br />
<br />
As they made the second floor a girl rushed past with a towel around her body as she ran down the hall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who was that?&quot; Mike asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Knock and find-out, Master,&quot; Kimmy said sardonically.<br />
<br />
Mike followed moving silently and found the door she had disappeared behind.  He knocked softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a minute, I'm changing,&quot; a sweet voice called from with in.<br />
<br />
Mike waited patiently looking about the hall.  It was a quiet place and rather bland.  Various random furniture was placed about offering people places to sit.  Kimmy chose a padded bench to lay on.<br />
<br />
&quot;When you mentioned your stone penis, were you kidding?&quot; Kimmy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish,&quot; Mike said while drinking in the lovely girl.  He could almost see through her shear pants and guessed that the curse had not bothered to give her underwear.  &quot;It really is made of stone.  I got it from the girl that gave me the curse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did she do it on purpose?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.  She turned into an anime-maid character before I left.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kimmy snorted her derision.  At that moment the door opened up and a young girl peered out at Mike.  &quot;What?&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm, Mike.  What is your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Grace.  Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Grace, I dare you to let me into your room and to sit on your bed quietly frozen in place.&quot;  Kimmy sat up and pointed her finger at the girl and Grace found herself doing just as Mike had said.<br />
<br />
Now inside the cluttered and messy room, Mike chose to sit in the desk chair while Grace sat on her bed.  Her hair was still wet and messy, she had apparently not bothered to brush her hair before opening the door.  Kimmy flopped down on the other bed in the room.  The new girl was stunned at the sight of Kimmy the genie and this guy that forced her to remain still.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grace, I am going to change you.  Don't worry it won't hurt.  It doesn't hurt does it Kimmy?&quot;  Kimmy shook her head and Mike continued.  &quot;You live here?&quot;  Grace was able to nod her head.  &quot;Who is your room-mate?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Danni,&quot; Grace whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright.  Grace here is what I want to happen to you ...&quot;  As Mike spoke, Kimmy twiddled her fingers.<br />
<br />
Grace found her breasts growing.  It was one of the things that she had never thought possible.  But her breasts grew and grew.  They seemed to inflate like balloons.  She wished that she could have taken her top off before this started.  Her breasts were round and light and tightly crammed inside her t-shirt.  She swore she could hear seams tearing before they stopped growing.  Then she felt her waist shrinking.  It was pinched and pulled in ward. and she felt like she was in a vice.  Grace could not look down but she felt her waist becoming waspish and thin.<br />
<br />
Then her clothing became clouds.  It was something she could not believe but there was no other way to describe it.  Cotton stopped being fabric and started being white, wispy, gas that wafted about her body but never too far and always covering her just enough.  Her nipples were stiff in the cloud, but she could not see them.  Grace wore no underwear but thatch was covered enough.  Top and bottom were censored by drifting clouds.<br />
<br />
Mike grinned at Kimmy but she simply frowned.<br />
<br />
Grace felt a something on her back.  Something was growing from her shoulder blades.  She could not turn to see what it was but if she had to guess it would have been wings.  White-feathered wings unfolded and remained propped out.  With a pair of costume wings from a famous bra-line, Grace was now adorned permanently.<br />
<br />
On her head she felt some new weight.  Later she would find it was a lighted ring that hovered over her hair.  She could not remove it even though it did not touch her body in any way.  Grace's hair became white and grew short and slick and was parted on the right.<br />
<br />
&quot;There, Grace, you are now a lovely, sexy angel.  You can't fly so please don't try.  Now because I am nice, I am going to make this body only come out on Sunday after the sun goes down and for the full day when the Moon is full.  How does that sound?&quot;<br />
<br />
There were a few more instructions that Mike made as dares but Grace was not really listening.  She looked down at the huge breasts on her chest.  The tips were always covered in clouds.  Ironic, tiny mountains.  She could almost laugh.<br />
<br />
Then Danni walked in.<br />
<br />
********************<br />
<br />
Five minutes later, Mike and Kimmy had left to find others and Grace looked at her friend Danni.<br />
<br />
Danni was almost exactly her complement.  Danni now sported the same huge breasts but her nipples and crotch were hidden by dark gray smoke clouds.  On Danni's head hovered a red, glowing pair of horns over the black slicked hair parted on the left.  Her wings were black-feathered and just as majestic as Grace's.  Mike had made Danni like this on Saturday nights and days with the new Moon.<br />
<br />
Uncomfortably they stared at each other.  Being room-mates may have just become more difficult.</p>
