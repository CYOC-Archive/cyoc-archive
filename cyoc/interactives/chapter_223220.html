<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After so many years in the Marine Corp the forty two year old Master Sargent Kenny Smith stood behind a thin curtain with only a shower head on the wall and a mirror. He had fought so many battles both growing up as a poor African America boy growing up in the gang ruled streets of New Orleans Louisiana and second actual combat as a marine around the world. Then fighting in the streets of the nation he loves against transformed citizens before finally hiding in his bunker for five years.<br />
<br />
He was tired of falling back constantly from the animal people who had defeated the most powerful nation in the history of humanity. He was tired of hiding in this bunker, that is why he had volunteered for this mission. He knew the risk, he knew it meant becoming the enemy, becoming an animal hybrid but if it meant finding a cure and winning this war, he would do it. <br />
<br />
When the needle broke his skin, and the transformation agent entered his body he knew it was possible that he would lose his humanity in both mind and body. He knew the doctors and researchers believed that while his body would become some animal hybrid his mind would remain human, he wouldn’t give in to the animal nature of those infected naturally. But that was only believed, it wasn’t for sure and even if he kept his human mind for now he could loss it over time. <br />
<br />
Still, he was tired of hiding, he had to do this and if he felt his mind going he planned to kill as many of those furry SOBs as possible.<br />
 <br />
The injection happened and for a moment nothing happened as Sargent Kenny Smith prepared himself for what he believed had to be a wave a pain as he would transform.<br />
<br />
He had seen others transform and almost everyone he had seen extremely painful, a few he had seen in mid transformation in sweeping operations had been lost in sexual pleasure but it still looked painful to him.<br />
<br />
To his amazement instead of pain it felt like his arm had instantly gone to sleep. He looked at his arm and watched in a strange horror and fascination as his pitch black skin began to change. Around the injection site the skin hardened and began to change color into a darkish brownish green before forming scales.<br />
 <br />
So he was becoming some kind of lizard he had seen a good number of them in the field. They weren’t as common as mammals but they where far more common than birds furry.<br />
<br />
He felt some discomfort around his throat as his neck ticked to the point it was hard to say he really had a neck. He turned toward the mirror, his eyes widened as he watched all his hair fall out, then the flesh around his ears disappeared leaving only hole remaining. Before he could process that, his vision began to change as he watched his eyes begin to move on his head, they moved upwards and outwards expanding his range of view. His mouth began to push out as well into a long snout, his teeth falling out as it expanded, new sharper teeth appearing out of his gum line. <br />
<br />
He grew up in the south, so he recognized what he was becoming.<br />
<br />
An Alligator <br />
<br />
His body began to grow in mass, he had been a large and strong man but now he began to add muscle mass at an unnatural rate. His shoulders spread apart as scales covered his arms which would have put a body builder to shame. He finally stopped growing when the top of his head touched the ceiling, and considering his eyes had moved to the top of his head that was a good thing. His legs also saw the same rapid change as they too got covered with scales. Scales of a slightly lighter color began to cover his chest and down to between his legs. <br />
<br />
He caught one last look at his human manhood, he had never married but his manhood was nothing he felt ashamed about and none of his girlfriends or one-night stands had ever complained about the size. It rapidly began to grow in size to match his new body before covering with an animal like sheath. It remained rock hard to the point of almost being painful before suddenly the stiffness released. That release happened at the same moment that a massive tail began to push out of his tailbone as the long alligator tail began to form. His manhood slipped back into his body leaving almost no sign of how large it really was. <br />
<br />
The among the last changes was his fingernails turning into short claws along with his toe nails, they still remained mostly human looking more so his hands. Ridges formed along the scales which ran down his back toward to his tail making him a full alligator furry. <br />
<br />
He could tell everyone was on edge as his breathing seeded as he felt his transformation come to a stop and he began to take in his surroundings.  He had to be at least 8 foot tall but his tail had to be at least another 8 ft as well meaning if he measured himself like a normal alligator he would be at least 18 ft long. He felt so powerful, he knew he could rip apart solid metal and he knew he could bite people in half with ease. He could see things he could never see before, and he couldn’t smell anything that he couldn’t as a human he could somehow sense everyone’s nearby heartbeat. He was powerful and he liked it, however one thing was more important than the new power he had. <br />
<br />
“I am still me.” Said Sergent Smith, his voice deeper but still him, as he turned to see what everyone else had become, the transformation was supposed to be almost random like the natural furry virus so he wondered what happened to everyone else. </p>

What did the others transform into and did they keep their human minds?</h3>
