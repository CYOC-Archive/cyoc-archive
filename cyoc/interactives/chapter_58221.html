<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Leigh's attempts at reassurance were of meager comfort to Cara.  She was still wearing the punk girl's sweatshirt with the hood clinging tightly to her face as though it would somehow protect her.  Just as hiding under the covers protected her as a child from the boogie man.<br />
<br />
But it was a futile notion as she could feel the tugging sensation in her already pointed ears causing them to painfully press ever more insistently at the hood's taut fabric.  She continued to stare stupefied at her hands, as the thick claws at the ends of her aching fingertips continued to increase in length and sharpness.  The writhing, dark hairs on the backs of her hands becoming thicker by the moment as suddenly more dark hairs began to peek out from under the cuffs of the hoodie.<br />
<br />
&quot;But how?  Why?&quot; Cara whimpered as water once again began to well in her eyes as uncontrollably as the rest of her changes.  &quot;I-I thought you had to be bitten!  This shouldn't be happening to...Ow-oooo!&quot;  Her attempt at denial cut short by a howl of pain.  She began to rub at her sneaker-clad feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here let me help you,&quot; a still unchanged and in-control Leigh gently offered as she removed the brunette's shoes and socks, revealing her clawed feet to the room.  At their exposure, they immediately began to issue forth fine, dark hair as if in greeting to the moonlight seeping through the open windows.<br />
<br />
Emily, left unattended thus far, took this as her cue to begin removing her shoes as well.  She did so with trembling, aching hands which were just now starting to sprout the same lengthening claws Cara had. Although she was still several steps behind Cara in her own transformation, she wanted to be prepared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please make it stop... please...&quot; Cara pleaded as she tightly squeezed her eyes shut, due in equal parts to the pain and to the desire not to watch herself uncontrollably transform.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shh, shh... try not to fight it.  It'll be ok.  You're doing great.&quot; Leigh tried to encourage as she began to soothingly rub the increasingly distraught girl's shoulder in an attempt to calm her.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this had the opposite effect, as the blue-haired girl's gentle touch almost seemed to stoke Cara's change.  She cringed as she felt first the tingle and then could almost hear the disconcerting rustle of hair rising from her back and shoulders.  She couldn't help but let out a less-than-human sounding whine through her now inch-long canines.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was the... the flower.&quot; Emily attempted to explain through her own transformation.  &quot;It was...magic...Unngh!&quot; she winced as she felt a sharp pain shoot through her limbs leaving a fierce cramp in its wake.  &quot;When you... touched it, it made you one.  Both of, ungh, us. P-please forgive me...&quot;  she struggled to apologize through the pain once more.<br />
<br />
Cara only glared and growled through clinched fangs and darkening lips in response.<br />
<br />
Although Emily lovingly embraced the change, in stark contrast to her roommate, she still found it somewhat painful as well.  She had dreamed of this moment for so long, wished for it, tried to imagine it.  But nothing could have prepared her mentally or physically for actually experiencing it.  With shaking, clawed hands she began to take off her sweatpants and shirt as her own slight beginnings of coming fur had just began to bloom and bunch up awkwardly under her clothes.  Especially between her breasts, under her arms, and betwixt her legs.<br />
<br />
Emily's cheeks flushed even more than they already were as she realized she was now almost entirely naked in front of her two clothed companions.  She desperately wished to remove her panties, which were almost pointless at this point. They were doing a horrid job of containing the dense ruff of fur the hair there was blossoming into anyway.  She began to paw uncontrollably at the prickly cotton, wanting to fully explore the area.<br />
<br />
Of course, at this moment, Leigh decided to finally look over to Emily to check on her progress.  She beamed proudly at how well she was coping and also at the sight of her nearly naked, fur-blooming body.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, kiddo, no need to be modest on my account.  You know, if it makes you more comfortable...&quot; and with that she promptly and expertly threw off all of her own clothes without the slightest hint of inhibition.  There was no need to remove panties as she never wore them.  &quot;Ta-da!&quot; <br />
<br />
Emily relished the vision of seeing Leigh naked for the first time.  Although the punk girl had still not yet succumbed to the full moon, Emily could see via the natural libertine growth of hair on her friend, that Leigh was a actually natural blonde.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like the carpet definitely does not match the drapes!&quot; Emily managed to joke, her voice now infused with a growling edge. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, yeah.  You're all about finding my secrets lately huh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leigh grinned lustfully as Emily gladly cast off the last scrap of clothing in response.  Suddenly, both of their attention was promptly returned to Cara, who had begun hyperventilating and scratching like a caged animal at the sweatshirt, slashing it with her claws.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I can't take anymore!&quot; And in a sudden fit of strength and willpower, the still-changing girl let out a bestial growl and made a frantic dash for the nearest window...</p>
