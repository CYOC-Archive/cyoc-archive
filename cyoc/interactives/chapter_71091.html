<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...His legs wrapped around the waist of one of the male strippers, Calvin could feel himself being penetrated in an area he was quite he didn't have. A moan of pleasure of escaped him as he felt himself stimulated. And than he squealed, &quot;Oh yeah,&quot; in a voice he knew wasn't his. Somebody in his peripheral vision caught his attention. Turning, he saw...<br />
<br />
...Somebody was gently squeezing the left breast insert. Only Calvin realised that it wasn't a breast insert, but a real breast. And he was enjoying the sensation he was feeling. Another moan escaped him as he heard the sounds of what sounded like a party raged around him. Glancing at the owner of the hand, seeing the face of the male dancer who'd been dressed like a fire man, he told him, &quot;Oh, yeah. Help me extinguish this fire that's consuming me,&quot; as a familiar face appeared just behind the stripper. Blinking, Calvin thought it was the Roman who'd given him the ring...<br />
<br />
...He was watching the male dancers going at it with a couple other girls, cheering on with the rest of the girls crowding around him. Somebody gently bumped into him and glancing in their direction, he realised it was the Roman. Blinking, he realised it wasn't a man, but a rather dirty woman with short hair. As he attempted to sort out what he was seeing, the Roman smiled and asked, &quot;Are you seeing now in a proper context?&quot;...<br />
<br />
With a start, he awoke, the dream he'd been dream he'd been having vanishing before he could really remember what he'd been dreaming. Somebody close by said, &quot;Don't mind me Allison. I just want to borrow,&quot; stopped and than said, &quot;Excuse me. I didn't realise somebody else was here,&quot; and looking in the direction of the voice, Calvin blinked at a young woman in nothing more than a teddy. Shifting, he blinked and attempted to piece together all that happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know where Allison is?&quot; the young woman asked and shaking his head, Calvin listened in a half-interested tone as she said, &quot;Well if you see her, tell her I'm borrowing a few things. She'll know what I'm talking about. Just say Janet borrowed them,&quot; and smiling she disappeared.<br />
<br />
Groaning, not sure who Janet or Allison was, Calvin rolled over on his side, the softness of the sheets and comforter drawing him slowly back to sleep. Seeing the poster of a half-naked guy brought him back and remembering the stripper and the previous evening, Calvin sat up, looking wildly about and holding the top sheet and comforter up. Letting him drop, seeing that he was wearing a white tank top with spaghetti thin straps and what was clearly a cleavage, he gasped, &quot;No,&quot; and cupped his breasts.<br />
<br />
As he realised that he couldn't feel anything it slowly came back to him the two artificial breasts Tanya had affixed to his chest. Another groan escaped him and pushing away the comforter, he started to struggle out of the bed, but stopped when he saw the boxers he was wearing. And than he noticed that the front was horrible flat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Flat like I've got nothing down there, in front,&quot; Calvin thought as he struggled out of the bed.<br />
<br />
Looking wildly about he spotted a small cosmetic mirror and was about to get up when the young woman came back, asking, &quot;You say something?&quot; as she hurried through the room.<br />
<br />
As he violently shook his head, Calvin remembered the male dancers and how they'd taken him as the young woman disappeared. A concerned and confused feeling coming over, Calvin practically leapt from the bed and grabbed the cosmetic mirror. Heading into the room Janet had gone into and come back out, correctly guessing it was a bathroom, Calvin closed the door and began fumbling with the boxers he was wearing.<br />
<br />
Unsure where he'd gotten the tank top and boxers, he pushed the boxers down and first breathed a sigh of relief and felt like screaming at what he saw. Reaching down with his free hand, he whispered, &quot;What the hell,&quot; at his tiny penis and testicles.<br />
<br />
Fumbling with mirror, he placed it between his legs. Failing to see anything properly, he kicked off the boxers and squatted down. Placing the mirror between his legs, he shifted it about until he could clearly see and believe that he did not have a set of female genitals. Breathing a sigh of relief, he sat down on the toilet and thought, &quot;Well than what the hell,&quot; as he pondered over whether he really had a dick up his butt or if he'd imagined it because of too much to drink.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to get out here,&quot; he decided, but than stopped as he realised he didn't know where his clothes or Tanya where.<br />
<br />
Retrieving the boxers, Calvin looked at them, sighed and than put them back on, hating how high they rode up on him and how they made it look like he didn't have a penis or testicles. Thinking, &quot;Though it really doesn't matter. I've got the equipment of a boy of about two years old or less,&quot; he opened the door and exited the bathroom.<br />
<br />
As entered back into the bedroom, Calvin almost turned around when he found himself looking at a young woman in nothing more than a pair of underwear. Instead, he asked, &quot;Allison?&quot; amazed that he still sounded like a girl when he spoke.<br />
<br />
The young woman nodded as she slipped off her underwear and turned to her closet, commenting, &quot;You can keep the boxers and shirt, if you want. I never really wore them. Not my style and they look great on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Calvin said and than asked, &quot;You haven't seen the girl I came with? Tanya?&quot;<br />
<br />
Throwing on a bathrobe, Allison shook her head and replied, &quot;You were pretty drunk last night when I spoke with you. You wouldn't even allow me to help you out of your clothes,&quot; and giggling, she added, &quot;Though there wasn't much of the dress you were wearing. Those dancers got kind of rough, didn't they,&quot; as she tied the front of the robe shut.<br />
<br />
Glad that he hadn't been seen naked, Calvin nodded and said, &quot;Somebody was in here a moment ago. Said her name was Janet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, she's always borrowing stuff from me. I don't mind,&quot; Allison replied as she headed for the bathroom Calvin had just left and as she started to close the door, she told him, &quot;Listen. If the dress is too far-gone, you can help yourself to anything of mine. My mother is always buying me clothes and I have to much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thanking her, not really liking the idea of wearing clothes suitable for the opposite sex, Calvin wondered what other choice he had and walking over to the dresser, he stopped when he passed a mirror affixed to the inside of the closet door. Blinking, Calvin thought he appeared ridiculous as everything to how he was standing and holding himself to how his butt stuck out to how round and feminine his face looked made him look like a girl.<br />
<br />
As he took a step closer Calvin turned his head to the one side and than the other, noting that he couldn't even tell were the hair extensions started and his hair ended. Realising he was still holding the cosmetic mirror, Calvin stepped away from the larger mirror, placed the smaller one back were he'd found it and thought, &quot;I got to find Tanya.&quot;<br />
<br />
Going through Allison's dresser, Calvin selected a pair of capris he thought would look great with the tank-top he was wearing and glad that the shirt was a little thick around the nipple region, he slipped on the pants and fastened them. Glancing down, running a hand over them, he stopped as when he noticed he was still wearing the ring the Roma had given him. Thinking, &quot;It must be the Roma,&quot; Calvin slipped his feet into a pair of sandals that he decided complimented his shirt and pants, took a spritz from one of Allison's perfumes and hastily left the room. <br />
<br />
As he headed down the upstairs hallway, Calvin decided that what he needed to do was to return to the carnival and confront the Roma. As he hurried along, he noted, but decided in the long he didn’t care that the way he was walking and holding himself was how a young woman would.<br />
<br />
When he reached the bottom of the stairs, he was just about to head for the front door when a young woman’s voice called, “Your not leaving just yet, are you Sandy,” and turning, Calvin watched as the Pamela approached him, saying, “We were just about to have breakfast. I know you’re not a member, but still. After such an impression you left us with how you can party, I think we can make the exception and let you hang out with us. After all summer classes don’t start for another couple hours.” as she reached out, grabbed his hand and led him to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Forcing him down into an empty seat, Pamela asked, “So where is Tanya. I want to congratulate her and welcome her to our little sorority.”<br />
<br />
As Calvin shrugged and muttered, “Don’t know,” somebody set a bowl, spoon and a box of cereal down in front of him. Finding himself to be hungry, and deciding it would be rude to just dash off, he reached for the cereal.<br />
<br />
Pouring himself a bowl, Calvin listened as the Pamela and the others at the table resumed whatever conversation they’d been having before Calvin came down. As he ate, one of the girls began talking about a problem with a friend of hers and how this friend kept wearing underwear that was clearly a size or two small. Before he could really stop himself, Calvin piped up and said, “I know what you mean There’s this girl I know who is a bit on the husky side and she keeps insisting on wearing thong bikinis.”<br />
<br />
When another girl chimed in, Calvin suddenly realised what he’d just said. And than it came to him that he didn’t know any girl like what he’d just described, he wondered where the comment had come from. Next to him, Pamela commented, “You don’t need to ask her that. After last nights performance, I’m sure Sandy feels comfortable in multiple positions,” and glancing about, Calvin asked, “What?” and than added, “Sorry. My mind drifted to something I have today.”<br />
<br />
Several of the sorority girls giggled and one announced, “We were just talking about sexual positions and we were wondering what each preferred. Taken from the back? The front? Some other way?”<br />
<br />
“I usually prefer to first wrap my legs around his waist and let him run and than thrust at me that way,” Calvin replied and than added, “But any position works for me. So long as he knows what he is doing and doesn’t try to screw me in the wrong hole.”<br />
<br />
Next to him Pamela groaned and commented, “I hate when that happens. Especially when you try to explain and they don’t understand,” and than the conversation shifted once again and before Calvin could another thought, he found himself easily keeping up in every topic the young woman broached and even forming a couple topics himself. As he talked and ate his breakfast, the matter of the carnival slowly got pushed to the back of his mind until he forget about it.</p>
