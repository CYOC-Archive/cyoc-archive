<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emily was confused, just a few minutes ago she had her life on the right track - a wonderful boyfriend, a beautiful apartment, a nice job. Now she wasn't sure how to proceed any more. Her boyfriend reduced to a fetus inside her belly, kicking madly, surely conscious and trying to get out. The taunt skin of her stomach getting distended by his weakly attempts on escaping his predicament. "Rick, please...", she begged through tears, "you're not helping, you're hurting me...", she tried to reason with him, sitting on the floor, hugging her tummy. It seemed to work, he stopped kicking and started moving his small arms, examining the inside of his prison.<br />
She had enough of all of this. The camera was clearly cursed and it needs to be destroyed, maybe then everything would get back to normal, that is how it worked, right?<br />
She stood up, her belly jiggling from the sudden motion. That wasn't a good idea - she should have taken into account how heavy her belly became with her boyfriend inside. "Oh Rick, you're one big baby...", she sighed, feeling a sudden stab of pain, putting on of her hands on her lower back which felt overburdened by her pregnant tummy, "...carrying you around will be a workout.". Rick seemed to hear and understand what she said, since he gave her a single light kick in response, almost as if to disagree.<br />
She went to the kitchen, her belly making it a lot more difficult than it should be, and grabbed a container of lighter fluid. That ought to be effective, burning it with fire! She grabbed the camera with a quick motion of her hand, searching for a perfect spot to place it upon, to watch the wretched thing burn. Unfortunately there was no such spot, she didn't want to burn the place down trying to exact revenge on this stupid cursed thing.<br />
She stopped for a second, taking a few deeper breaths. Rick choose the moment to give her a light kick again, "I am calm!" she shouted to the empty room, but she knew she couldn't convince him, he heard her pounding heart of course.<br />
She left the lighter fuel and returned to the kitchen searching through the drawers for any alternative safer solution. Aha! She found it!<br />
The mallet felt perfect in her hand and it was splendid at making the meat tender in the various dishes she prepared for Rick. Now it got a new use case in which it will also perform a wonderful job! She set the camera on the kitchen drawer and corrected her grip on the hammer handle. Oh how sweet it will be, a dish served cold!<br />
With one swift motion the hammer connected with the camera... and broke into pieces. She looked at the broken wooden handle with disbelief, the metal hammer head was blown into smithereens and thrown all around the kitchen.<br />
While she stood there in total surprise, a single piece of paper slowly slid out of the camera and proceeded to fly down to the floor, disappearing under the kitchen drawer.<br />
Oh no... she was so stupid! She could have at least pointed the camera the other way! The rage blinded her better judgement - she wanted to look straight into the eye of the accursed thing while proceeding to destroy it, and of course she had to hit the shutter button with that single failed blow.<br />
She quickly got down to her knees, her belly jiggling like crazy. Nervously she searched around under the drawer, fearing what new horrible fate the camera prepared for her. Finally she found it! Slowly she took the picture out and... it was completely dark! Oh no... what... was that supposed to mean?!<br />
She was sitting there on her knees and one hand, the other gripping the picture so hard it wrinkled, her belly hanging down a quarter of the space to the floor. Her heart was pounding like crazy and her mind was racing, trying to find some sense in that darkness... She sighed when she finally understood she was looking at the back of the photo. When she reversed it the first thought that came to mind was that maybe that darkness wasn't the worst outcome.<br />
The picture showed her holding the broken mallet handle. The difference wasn't that obvious at first, but her belly was far, far larger. It looked as if she was a long time overdue. Her shirt was so stretched on her belly it looked like it was barely holding. Her breasts were also swelled to the point they looked unnatural and clearly leaked... milk? As two black splotches were visible coming of off them down her clothes.<br />
It was then she felt her belly inflating, slowly but surely. It did cause her pain, but she couldn't stop the growth although she dropped the photo to the ground and tried to push her descending belly back up. She surrendered her attempts when her hand got squished between it and the floor and her tummy grew bigger still.<br />
Soon her shirt just gave up and broke, followed by her bra, which caused her enormous breasts to flop out on the sides of her belly, sending a short stream of milk to the floor when they bounced. It hurt a lot, they were just too heavy and clearly full of milk, droplets forming on the large almost teat-like nipples.<br />
With a strong push she managed to sit on her butt, her legs spread to the side to make room for her gigantic belly. She could barely close her hands around the taunt skin, her bellybutton became an outie from the pressure inside, and her breasts were hanging on the sides of her body, reaching to her elbows, the nipples dripping milk slowly.<br />
She tried to get up, but her belly was so heavy she could barely move. Her frame was too frail for it to let her move. Women with pregnant bellies like hers were usually bedridden until birth. "Rick?" she asked through tears, happily he was still there - she felt movement from him... just far larger than before... The stupid cursed camera must have listened and used her own words against her.<br />
With the help of the kitchen drawers she managed to slowly stand up. She had to use one hand to support her belly, otherwise it hanged, stretching her skin uncomfortably. She found relief in the form of a chair, on top of which she rested her tummy to support it from below, which made moving a lot easier. She waddled around the apartment, pushing her belly on the chair in front of her. When she passed the mirror she could finally realize she looked so overdue it seemed she was pregnant with twins or triplets even, although she could feel only one big Rick inside her belly.<br />
The only logical thing she can do in this situation is...</p>
