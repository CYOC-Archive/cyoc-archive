<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Dustin finished with the first boy, another kid walked into a different changing room. The boy looked around 13 years old, and on the verge of puberty. He looked to be about 5&#39;4&quot; or so. Dustin grinned when he looked through the boy&#39;s athletic shorts and realized that the boy was a little underdeveloped in the lower region. But I can fix that, Dustin grinned as he stared.<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
Jayden was bored. His mother had dropped him off while she was dress shopping, and he had wandered off to have some private time here. Pulling out his phone, he began to text his friends. He was a bit insecure, knowing that some of his friends were developing ahead of him, he had seen them in the locker room at school. Jayden was secretly bi, but never let on to his friends for fear of being made a fool of. It didn&#39;t help that he was slightly &quot;impaired&quot; in the size department, with a cock that barely reached 4&quot; when hard. It was bad enough that Jayden usually padded his underwear out just enough to make it seem normal for a boy his age.<br />
<br />
Although, he grimaced as he looked at the bulge in his shorts, the padding seemed to have slipped down into an unnaturally big position. Great, last thing I need is someone to accuse me of padding, he thought. Reaching his hand into his shorts, he grabbed the tissues and pulled them out, intending to reposition them, when he froze, staring at the front of his shorts.<br />
<br />
Jayden always wore tight underwear. This was because it held the padding in place well. It had never really constrained his junk at all (considering its size) and was usually able to almost completely conceal his cock, even when it was erect. Jayden knew this because he had, on multiple occasions, had to hide erections from his friends. But this time, Jayden&#39;s underwear wasn&#39;t even close to concealing: There was a clearly defined tubular bulge that ran about a quarter of the way down Jayden&#39;s left leg.<br />
<br />
Not only that, it had grown. Jayden knew his cock had been 4&quot; that morning. The bulge in his pants had to be at least a couple inches longer than that. And, as Jayden stared with a startling realization, it was getting bigger, slowly inching down his leg and thickening up as well. For a moment, Jayden tried to remove his shorts, but then he realized that it was useless; although the material was stretching, the waistband itself was not. Try as he might, Jayden could not bring the waistband down over the enlarging tube of flesh that was traveling down his left leg.<br />
<br />
His eyes darting over the room, Jayden found a measuring roll, left in the drawer by the attendants. Quickly unrolling it and placing it next to the now-enormous bulge in his shorts, he gawked when the long tube reached the 8&quot; mark. No way could that be right, he thought, people don&#39;t just double their dick length in one minute. And yet as he stared down at the still-growing bulge in his pants, he couldn&#39;t think of another explanation.<br />
<br />
As the growth continued, Jayden began to worry. This might be too big, he thought, I might not even be able to wear normal things again. Then, he suddenly felt cold metal on the tip of his penis. Glancing down, he saw why: his cock was so long that it had actually grown out of the left leg and was touching the metal bench that he was sitting on. This sent him into even more of a panic. Dustin, noticing this, finally stopped staring.<br />
<br />
Jayden breathed a sigh of relief. His cock seemed to have stopped growing, though it was still incredibly enormous. How was he going to explain this? Slipping off his shorts and severely-stretched underwear, he gawked at what he found.<br />
<br />
Gone was the 4&quot; cock that was there this morning. In its place was a massive python cock, as thick as a coke bottle and almost as long as a mini-baseball bat. Grabbing the tape, Jayden was awestruck by the measurements: his cock was 12 inches long soft. Sitting below his cock were two huge balls, the size of the largest apples Jayden had ever seen. They hung low, and banged together whenever he walked.<br />
<br />
The stimulation from the walking, however, also stimulated Jayden&#39;s new balls to begin their production of both semen and a massive testosterone burst began to hit the boy. Jayden&#39;s cock began to harden, stiffening into a 16 inch steel rod jutting out from his pelvis. With a yell, Jayden exploded and his cock burst out streams of cum across the room. As Jayden&#39;s cock softened back down, things started happening...</p>
