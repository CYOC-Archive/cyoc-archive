<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Alright ladies, let’s get those beautiful bodies moving,” a cheery woman’s voice called out, making Dan open his eyes and try to adjust to the light. He was in a room, a fitness studio maybe, he hadn’t seen one before but the clear space with mats on the floor kind of gave it away.<br />
<br />
He was rigid in place, unable to move his body or even his eyes, he could only stare forward, a single woman in his sight before him. She was dressed for exercise with yoga pants and a neon green shirt on that lacked any sleeves.<br />
<br />
“Where am I?” He tried to ask but all he could do was stand there smiling, staring ahead, no control over his body.<br />
<br />
Music started up and out of the corner of his eye an instructor was visible. She was doing all sorts of stretches but strangely wasn’t facing her class, she was standing in line with them. She explained her stretches to a blank wall before starting to perform them. Then everyone in the room, it was hard to tell how many, began to move with her, doing the stretches themselves. Dan followed suit, his body on autopilot and not giving him the controls, he stretched and crouched and moved from left to right with sweat heading on his face. He got the occasional glimpse at the people around him. All women dressed in yoga pants or workout shorts with tight sports bras, breathable exercise shirts, and their hair tied back so it was out of their eyes.<br />
<br />
He didn’t really understand what was going on, his body just did some stretches and proceeded to run in place and get his muscles moving. The instructor shouted out about the importance of fitness and “keeping your body moving for these next nine months.” Whatever that meant. He just grinned in the background, utterly confused as he stretched and worked his body alongside all those women for about an hour. Then once the lesson was done everything just jolted.<br />
<br />
Everyone was in different clothing, they had their hair tied slightly differently, and the instructor stared at the wall happily and spoke to no one.<br />
<br />
“Alright ladies, one month in, you should be feeing a bit of stiffness as your body prepares, we’re going to focus on our legs to prepare for all that extra weight for the next while. Lesson two, let’s go,” she called before they all started moving again.<br />
<br />
“Extra weight?” Dan wanted to ask but he was just grinning like all the women around him. He felt tired and his legs were cramped and there was this pressure on his stomach. He get like throwing up.<br />
<br />
They worked for another hour before just like before everything jolted and their instructor claimed it was lesson three. Dan was just confused, he didn’t get what was happening, he just wanted to stop exercising, he just wanted to get control of his body again. Every time the world jolted he tried to catch onto what was changing but never could, at least until he was a few lessons in and his body turned and he realized all the women I. That studio had little bumps on their stomachs. Each and every woman in that room was pregnant, and he get a weight on his own stomach. He couldn’t reach down to check or gaze at it, but he had a horrible feeling he was in that moment pregnant. He didn’t know how, he didn’t really want to know how, but somehow he was trapped in a pregnancy exercise video as an extra in the background.<br />
<br />
Each lesson was an hour, and each time reality jolted he felt heavier and heavier, eventually his hands confirmed it, rubbing across a pregnant belly that made him want to scream. It got heavier and heavier and the exercises got simpler and less intrusive on his growing bundle of joy. Then eventually it was just gone, there was a flabby emptiness as the next few lessons made him do squats and try to get that baby fat burned off. He was so awkward and uncomfortable, he wanted it to end, but instead at the end of lesson twelve and a go ahead to resume normal physical activity the universe jolted and the instructor introduced lesson one again.<br />
<br />
Dan tried to keep track at first, of how many cycles he went through, but it just kept repeating and he lost count. He stretched and worked his muscles and body over and over again going through a pregnancy every time and weirdly it became easier and easier the more he went along with it until it wasn’t even that strenuous. He burned his fat off, becoming slimmer and fitter, but with that fitness came a horrifying revelation. He get his body rearranging, and his pants felt emptier with each cycle, his dick getting smaller and smaller with each loop.<br />
<br />
He wasn’t sure when he became a she, but it happened, maybe it took hours, maybe it was months, maybe it was even years. At the start of each cycle he was a little shorter, a little skinnier, and a little bigger in the busy area. His breasts swelled like the instructor said they would, his hips needed to be worked out so he could carry the weight of his child. Eventually he stopped referring to himself as he. She was one of the ladies in the pregnancy exercise video and every loop she swelled up with child, then did some post birth stretched and fitness activities. Then she started again. It became normal, it became reality, it became who she was. She was a woman who’d just gotten pregnant that needed to keep herself in shape during her pregnancy. It would be good for her and her baby.<br />
<br />
So Dan smiled, her name short for Danika, her pregnancy looped over and over again as she displayed the exercise women would need to perform to keep in shape. She couldn’t do anything but let those lessons and that workout music melt her mind away until there was nothing left, just an extra on an old workout video, forever to repeat her pregnancy  whenever someone needed exercise tips.</p>
