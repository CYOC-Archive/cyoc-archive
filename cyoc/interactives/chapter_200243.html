<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Death was in complete blackness. Swirling shapes of her mists caressed her as she floated in midair, encased in a cocoon of sorts, meditating on the endless facets of ending at her beck and call.<br />
<br />
After their escape, she had teleported herself and her sisters to one of the high-rise apartment buildings they had scouted out in the past for a hit. Needless to say, the residents didn&#39;t last very long as she released her sisters to try out their new powers on them. After that it was only a matter of redecorating and Famine brainwashing everyone in the building to believe they had always lived there.<br />
<br />
But there was no time ti wait around. Even with her endless might, she could feel frustrating limits blocking her path to true goddesshood. Her fairly limited reach of fifty meters that her mist could stretch out. And her amount of power over abstractness. Unless something was closely related to her, her control over killing its abstract aspects was limited by time and complexity. A fact evident by her hospital gown popping back into existence where she had left it, something that greatly confused the investigators. Timelines and other things she killed just &quot;snapped&quot; right back after a few hours, minutes or even seconds depending on the complexity of the task.<br />
<br />
And that they had to work on. She had thus spent her time meditating in an effort to speed up the natural evolution of her powers, while her sisters assisted in other ways. Famine was out establishing powerful contacts, seducing her way to upper classes while War was out providing funding, easily ripping out bank vaults, jewelry, anything they could sell for cold, hard cash. And Pestilence was hitting a DNACE facility, to steal their classified research on power development.<br />
<br />
Her peace was broken by the loud footsteps of War stomping in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Death! We got a big problem!&quot;<br />
<br />
She sighed, and uncoiled as her mists began to dissipate, revealing her  godly form as it extended like a butterfly, her flowing dress touching the floor as she levitated towards her brutish sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; she snapped.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s been captured!&quot;<br />
<br />
Death&#39;s face darkened further as War explained to her the fight inside of DNACE and showed the press reports of the dispatched heroes, all the while Death&#39;s fury grew. Watching the smiling, triumphant face of the man in skintight uniform set prickling through her entire body as her mists flared up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hyper-Man.&quot; she spat out, voice full of loathing. &quot;And who&#39;s that other bitch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently a newbie. Goes by the name of Wellspring.&quot;<br />
<br />
That made her even less amused. A fucking NEWBIE had been taken along to beat up her sister. Did they think they were being funny? Did they not take them seriously?<br />
<br />
Well, so be it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come here, War. You&#39;re going wherever they&#39;re holding Pestilence to bust her out.&quot; she said, beckoning her sister. She took a step back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now? I&#39;m all for a good fight, but isn&#39;t she surrounded by Supes now? Why can&#39;t you come with?&quot;<br />
<br />
Death smiled, and extended her tendrils that gripped War tightly, lifting her up to be showcased to their mistress. She struggled, but even her immense strength couldn&#39;t fight against Death.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t you worry. I won&#39;t be needed there. Since I just figured out something new to kill about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
War&#39;s face fell as she remembered that awful, cold feeling of Death &quot;enhancing&quot; her, literally ripping out parts of her existence to make her prettier. She didn&#39;t want to go through that again, she didn&#39;t she didn&#39;t she didn&#39;t-<br />
<br />
&quot;How about I kill your... weakness?&quot;<br />
<br />
Death whispered, and gripped the said abstract part of War, mercilessly snuffing it out.<br />
<br />
War&#39;s breath got caught in her throat, as a huge part of her was ripped away. As if half of her soul had been torn off. All her fears, all her insecurities, all of it flowed down the drain as her body heated up, violently mutating under this fundamental change.<br />
<br />
Already toned muscles bulged, desperately trying to outgrow each other as her frame swelled larger and larger. Several large CRACKS were heard, as blood burst out from massive open wounds that formed along her growing muscles, before sealing up in seconds, her bellowing strength testing out the limits of her enhancing durability. All of her organs SQUELCHED and bulged, her internal processes growing more efficient and advanced than any other living organism. Her heart hammered, desperately pushing blood through her perfecting body as she grew another one to help with the task. Her stomach acids could soon melt literally anything, combining with her unbreakable teeth to make her a truly universal omnivore. But all this evolution was ultimately for naught as she was pushed towards true immortality, eventually loosing the need to eat, sleep, drink, breathe, or even think. Weakness to psychic attacks was weakness after all, and that word had just been removed from her vocabulary.<br />
<br />
War grunted, her body becoming too much for her mind to handle. It felt so alien. Now stretched from merely toned into a female bodybuilder, her physical growth was slowing but far from abating. Her muscles were still hardening, entwining around themselves, still occasionally bursting through her skin but rarer and rarer as her cells went through levels of hardness. Iron, Steel, Tungsten, Titanium, Iridium, Diamond... until finally they bust our of the periodic table and all of its mixtures to arrive at something so alien it didn&#39;t have a name. Well, that wasn&#39;t really true. War&#39;s Cells, the first truly indestructible material in the universe. Her new state of being as well as ultra-dense muscles increased her weight ten-fold, leaving visible crack on the floor as Death finally let her go, admiring her now immortal sister. She had joined her in goddesshood.<br />
<br />
But it wasn&#39;t over yet as her dual hearts began working overtime, her body reddening from the abundance of blood flowing through it. Sweat, a redundant but ultimately harmless function, coated her as she began to pants, despite her body no longer requiring oxygen. Her subconscious mind was scouring through knowledge. Despite being utterly unstoppable, there were ways she could still be trapped. That was weakness. Thus, one last mutation was in order.<br />
<br />
Steam began to rise off of War&#39;s reddened body as her internal temperature rose. Brand new organs, fueled by her soon boiling blood, popped up, optimized towards a single purpose: Heat generation.<br />
<br />
She had curled into a fetal position, rocking back and forth as her rapidly heating up body was sizzling on the marble floor, much to the amusement of her floating sister. She hadn&#39;t foreseen this possibility while enhancing her sister, but it was quite welcome, Death though as she watched at War, slowly beginning to glow red, then yellow, then white from inner fire before-<br />
<br />
&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
War literally exploded, engulfing the penthouse in flames as Death sunk into shadows to protect herself. She was a living inferno, a being of fire, her red hair flaming and flowing with her, her veins pumping with nuclear might. She was a core being, she was a Sun. Absolutely nothing could stop her now. She could melt through any obstacles, fly out from outer space, swim out of lava, and naturally incinerate anything that dared to defy her. <br />
<br />
Then it stopped, War&#39;s flames cooling off as Death snuffed them out. In the gentle embrace of darkness, she slowly calmed down, until she was let out, a changed woman.<br />
<br />
Her skin had darkened, as if turning into a literal living sun had tanned her to perfection, finishing off her Amazon look, a being of pure might. Her red eyes were orange now, as well as her hair that was still crackling with flame, now a permanent part of her. She breathed evenly, almost robotically. She had no weakness anymore. Nothing could pierce her skin, she didn&#39;t need to breathe, her eyes had heat vision, her muscles could crush anything, and her fire powers were the hottest in the universe. Gone was the mere superhuman, War was now approaching an Apollyon-class. <br />
<br />
Death smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;War, you look amazing,&quot; she said, caressing the hot cheek of her sister, who didn&#39;t blink an eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now give them hell.&quot;<br />
<br />
In a second, War was whisked away, thrown to decimate the police force and free Pestilence. The experiment was a grand success.<br />
<br />
Death couldn&#39;t help but wonder... what would happen if she did the same with her other sisters?</p>
