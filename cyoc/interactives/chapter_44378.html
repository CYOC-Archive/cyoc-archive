<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">My name was... let's leave it at that, as it's pretty long, so I go by Mark. I didn't live in the best of neighborhoods and I needed some cash. I had some sources that told me that the guy a few blocks down was big into drug dealing, so I figured I'd be able to get in, grab some, and leave before he noticed. I started to watch the guy's house, so I'd an idea of when I could break in without him home. After awhile, it seemed like Saturdays at 9PM til midnight he was off making drug deals and getting shipments. So one Saturday, I walked down to his place, wearing a plain black hoodie, hood up to help hide my identity. at 9:15, I went alongside the building and kicked at the lock to his outside-basement entrance. Surprisingly, it was unlocked, so I just walked down the steps inside, quietly as I could. As soon as I turned on the lights, I knew I'd hit the jackpot. There were bags of drugs on every table. I didn't know what was what, so I randomly grabbed a few bags and stuffed them in my cargo shorts' pockets. That's when I realized I wasn't alone.<br />
<br />
	In the back room working on his next drug was the dealer himself. He came out into the main basement room &quot;HEY?! Who the hell are you?&quot; Asked the rather large dealer. Even though he was a dealer, breaking and entering was still a felony. “Shit!&quot; My eyes wide at being caught. The dealer was blocking the entrance. He was a pretty big guy, looked like he could've been a bouncer. I looked around for an exit, but I couldn't find any good ones. Keeping a table between us, I looked for an opening to the stairs up and outside. I saw what looked like a large pestle, probably used for grinding the dope. I picked it up and ran up to him. He expected me to make a run for it, not attack him, so his hands were down to grab me instead of protecting his head. I knocked him on the side of the head and ran out while he was dazed. He wasn't knocked out and he followed me up. The basement door closed in on itself after we were outside. I started beating on him with the large wooden pestle until I heard sirens. 'Fuck! He called the cops!'  I thought, wildly hitting the guy's face until he fell over. He wasn't dead, but was pretty bruised up.<br />
<br />
	The next door neighbors had actually called the cops around the time they noticed someone lurking in the back yard, just so happens the timing was perfect. With the basement door shut and the dealer on the ground from my frantic poundings, I had nothing to worry about from him until two cops ran into the scene. One of which being Andrew and his buddy, David. Andrew took off to the east while David tended to the dealer, who up till now has kept his dealings private and exclusive. He later said you hadn’t taken anything. Leaving him in the clear for any further questions at the time. Andrew went after you.  Drew wasn’t the cop that normally chased down the suspect, but it just happened to end up this way. He was physically fit, being around 6’2” more buff than the other cops at the station which in effect made him slower, but he could easily take down any guy of equal or even greater size. He caught up to me easily enough, only because I found myself at a dead end. He pulled his weapon and ordered me to stop. Soon enough he had me against the wall and patted me down for weapons. I was clean except for the paraphernalia he found on me. “What’s this?” He breathed into my ear holding me against the wall with his chest and arm. &quot;N-nothing!&quot; I stammer out, never before having had any trouble with the law. Then again, I had never done anything to have gotten in trouble before. He took a quick look at the assortment of pills and bags. &quot;Looks like a drug charge to me punk!&quot; he cuffed my hands behind my back as David returned &quot;Take these to the car,&quot; he handed the bags to David, as he informed Drew that the 'victim' will be alright and the paramedics were looking after him now. <br />
	<br />
	I was so scared that I didn't say anything as Drew shoved me to the squad car and I complied with every demand as he pushed my head down and then into the backseat. Drew almost felt bad to see another 'kid' fall on the wrong side of the law, I just seemed scared and struck him as the type who wouldn’t do it. However, it could also be an act for big baby cops like himself. He had been on the force since he was 21 after training camp. He wasn’t considered a rookie anymore, but he wasn’t a vet, either. He had been around for almost 5 years now. I was silent in the back as Drew drove, David next to him. My eyes looked terrified as I looked around at my surroundings. Out the car, at the two of them, the inside of the car, the metal grating separating me from you. We drove off. Drew was quiet and David questioned me asking the generic questions like my name etc... &quot;Come on Dave we can do that at the station,&quot; &quot;Like hell I want to go home for once. You can do it at the station,&quot; Drew let out a sigh &quot;Fine but there aren’t many on-duty cops now-a-days,&quot; &quot;Like it matters.&quot; &quot;It could. All hell could break loose as soon as you go home!&quot; David let out a hearty laugh &quot;Just because you spend all day at the station gym doesn’t mean I have to too, you fruit,&quot; Drew got quiet not liking being called gay or anything similar. Which is probably why he often got teased in that way.  I just watched as the two pulled into the police station. I didn't know what would happen to me. Although I lived in an area where this was common, I had done my best to stay away from doing things like this and I was amazingly innocent for my age. &quot;Alright,&quot; Drew opened the car door, grabbing me firmly by the shoulder as he guided me to the station and read me my rights. He sat me in a chair in front of a desk and took his seat on the other side. The station was pretty empty. Usually only one or two cops will stay late. Drew was one of them. Paul and Darla were the other two, they worked in a rotation. Drew got in just as Darla was leaving and David escorted me in with Drew and then went to the locker room. <br />
<br />
	Drew pulled up some forms and began to fill out. &quot;Name?&quot; He began to question me, where he took me to the back room for a mug shot and finger print. I was just terrified. &quot;Mark...&quot; I had answered before giving you my full name. I didn't move unless Drew directed me, not wanting to get into any more trouble. My finger still showing the ink from the fingerprint, I just watched as he filled out the paperwork on me. &quot;First time offender, hmm. You’re not in the system&quot; he said looking through the computer database &quot;You understand why you're here right?&quot; &quot;Y-y-yes, sir..&quot; I say, presuming he meant what I had stolen. I didn't think to elaborate on what I had done. &quot;Well... The assault and stolen property. However Darnell said everything was intact and you didn’t take anything. So it’s only a possession charge.&quot; Darnell being the name of the drug dealer. I nod silently, a bit surprised Drew didn't make mention at how badly I had beaten Darnell within an inch of his life. I expected it was more than just 'assault.' &quot;Well you and I are in for a long time. The court system wouldn’t hold your case as high priority, I don’t think you will need a lawyer, but you get your phone call if you want it, let me know. Otherwise, welcome home for the next few nights,&quot; He lead me to a small cell with a cot. I would most likely just get fined, but it seemed they usually held 'kids' like me for a few days. However, I didn’t think like I was a threat. I sat down on the cot in the cell, worried about what was going to happen to me. I lived alone, didn't really have any family to speak of. I was scared about how this would only worsen everything in my life. I would only have less money than when I started with and the only thing I'd have to show for it was a police record.<br />
<br />
	Drew sat at his desk typing. His was adjacent from the cells, so that he could see me if I needed anything. There were only two cells, probably big enough for maybe four people each, but Drew never had even one cell full at a time. &quot;Ah&quot; He grunted reclining in the chair. It was around midnight. I was tired, but I had the feeling that I wouldn't be getting any sleep regardless. I avoided eye contact with Drew, not wanting to provoke him or anything. The only thing I was glad about was that other than Drew, I was completely alone. Drew’s life was his work, single and pretty alone in a lot of ways. He burnt excess aggression in the small gym room in the station when he had the chance. He caught me out of the corner of his eye &quot;Cryin?&quot; He noticed that I was clearly upset  I shake my head, &quot;No. Nothing.&quot; I said, but my eyes were bloodshot. It had been several hours now and I was exhausted, from both lack of sleep and worry. &quot;Heh,&quot; he chuckled in his dark uniform. Drew had a soft spot for people in my situation, but he didn’t like it and hardening that soft spot has been a five year long task. &quot;Did you eat anything?&quot; &quot;No. Nothing.&quot; I said, a moment later realizing I had just said the same thing hardly a minute ago. I frowned, thinking about what would happen. I was almost in my own little world of fear. <br />
<br />
	&quot;It won’t be so bad, Kid.&quot; Drew didn’t realize how old I was. He had never bothered to find out, he just figured everyone smaller than himself was younger and therefore called 'kid.' I managed a small, &quot;Heh..&quot; not really believing him. All I could think of was how badly I had fucked up my already fucked up life. 'I bet the cops will sell, or just use whatever I stole, too...' &quot;Right then…&quot; Drew reclined his chair back leaning against the wall, closing his eyes and fell asleep for a few hours giving me some time to think. I leaned my back against the wall staring at the ceiling for.. I don't know, for as long as Drew was asleep, I didn't move much. In fact, I only moved in surprise when I heard Drew move as he woke up. It must've been very early in the morning, I guessed around 2 or 3.</p>
