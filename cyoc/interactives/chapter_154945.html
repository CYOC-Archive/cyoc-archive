<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">*Beep* *Beep* *Beep* At six in the morning Connor&#39;s alarm went off. He quickly shut it down and got up from bed. He stretched his body and with a jump in his step went downstairs. &quot;Morning Mom.&quot; Connor greeted his Mom as he went to get some cereal to eat. &quot;Morning Honey... That&#39;s rare. You look like you&#39;re happy.&quot; &quot;Yep! I really can&#39;t wait for school!&quot; &quot;Now that IS rare. I hope you enjoy then.... Sam! Wake up or you&#39;ll be late!&quot; Connor&#39;s Mom called out to his younger (but now older) brother. The app worked really well it seemed. Sam was a middle schooler now and nothing was wrong with that. Connor took the Fruity Pebbles from the shelf and ate into it with gusto. &quot;Don&#39;t eat to fast now.&quot; &quot;Nom... nom... Sorry!&quot; Connor realized he was maybe acting a little too chipper and slowed down. Sounds of footsteps coming down were heard as Sam came into the kitchen. He wore nothing but a wife-beater and boxers as he scratched his balls. A boner was evident above. &quot;Sam, watch your manners. You&#39;re at the breakfast table.&quot; Connor&#39;s Mom scolded Sam. &quot;Yeah, yeah...&quot; Sam replied indifferently, but he did as he told. &quot;Sup bro! You look like you got a chick!&quot; &quot;Not quite, but I guess it&#39;s like that.&quot; Gage had a girlfriend didn&#39;t he, Connor thought as he finished his breakfast. He left the room to get changed. Finishing up, he looked around his room one more time. &quot;I&#39;m gonna miss this place, but at least I&#39;ll be getting a much better deal.&quot; And with that he went downstairs. &quot;Bye Sam. Good luck at school! &quot;Yam, Yam!&quot; Sam replied with food in his mouth. &quot;Bye Mom. Love ya!&quot; Connor gave his Mom a little hug. &quot;My, my! What has gotten into you?! Don&#39;t tell me you really did get a girlfriend?!&quot; &quot;No, no. Nothing like that at all! Just wanted to do it is all.&quot; Connor said no more as he left the house. It would be the last time he would set foot in it again. He had decided last night what he would do. He would switch bodies with Gage and take his life for himself.<br />
<br />
Twenty minutes later, Connor had arrived at school. Usually, this gave him nothing but an ulcer, but now he wasn&#39;t afraid of what lay beyond. He walked in through the front. &quot;Connor Watkins?&quot; a man in the front hall asked. &quot;Hello Mr. Smith.&quot;  Connor went up to his homeroom teacher, Mr David Alex Smith. He made it a habit to hang out at the front to make sure his student came in on time. That made it sound like he was an asshole teacher, but Mr. Smith was just looking out for them. &quot;Just so you know, Gage is in the locker rooms right now. You can take the long way to avoid him.&quot; Got it. Thanks, Mr Smith!&quot; The school could do nothing about Gage, but Mr. Smith did his best to help soften the blow to his students, by making sure they could avoid him. It was a band-aid at best, but it did mean a lot to Connor. &quot;You look chipper. Did something good happen?&quot; &quot;Oh nothing really... By the way, is Gage alone right now?&quot; &quot;I think so...? Why do you...?&quot; &quot;No real reason! See you at homeroom sir!&quot; Connor left Mr. Smith&#39;s side. He took out his phone and opened the app. &quot;I wish Mr. Smith could get a wage raise.&quot; &quot;Hmm... Connor, that way&#39;s the...&quot; &quot;Oh Mr. Smith, could I have a moment of your time?&quot; &quot;Hmm... Oh Principal Deerling. What is it?&quot; Conner wanted to do Mr. Smith a solid for his help and it got him distracted, so in the end it worked out fine. He walked towards the men&#39;s locker room and got ready for for his last moments as Connor Watkins.<br />
<br />
Connor opened the door and stepped inside. He could hear the sounds of someone changing clothes and talking. &quot;Hmph! Hmph! Oh yeah! Looking mighty fine!&quot; Connor peaked from out of the corner. There he was, Gage Matthews, flexing at the mirror. He was definitely alone. &quot;God, what an ass!&quot; Connor thought to himself. Here he was, a man who ruined lives as he pleased, admiring himself with not a care in the world. &quot;Well enjoy this moment Gage Matthews. It will be your last.&quot; Connor summoned all his courage and walked out from the corner. &quot;Hey Gage!&quot; &quot;Wha?!&quot; Evidently Connor&#39;s outburst had freaked him out. &quot;Well look what we have here!&quot; Gage yelled, trying to regain his composure. &quot;If it isn&#39;t Connor the Nerd! What&#39;s brings you here? This is a room for men, not for sissies like you!&quot; &quot;Hey, don&#39;t talk in front of the mirror!&quot; &quot;You look pretty happy there!&quot; Gage replied, looking just slightly pissed that he was being talked back to. &quot;Come to think of it, I thought I beat you up pretty badly yesterday. You look pretty un-beat-up there. &quot;Oh I have my ways.&quot; Conner couldn&#39;t believe he was actually taking back. He was getting a hard-on just thinking of what was happening. &quot;Well, since you were so kind to come to me, I guess I can help beat ya up again!&quot; Gage started to walk up to Connor. &quot;Wait right there! I have something in my hand that will make it so you can&#39;t hurt me again!&quot; &quot;Oh really?!&quot; Gage replied again. Evidently he wasn&#39;t too worried. &quot;What if I had a gun?&quot; Connor thought, but he left that to conjecture. &quot;Yeah! And here it is!&quot; Connor took out his phone from his pocket. &quot;Oh no, a phone! I&#39;m shakin&#39; in my boots!&quot; Gage still wasn&#39;t scared. What an idiot! &quot;Not just any phone! See this screen. It&#39;s an app called the Wish Granting App and with it I can have any wish, reality be damned. &quot;Wha... Ah-hah! Ha, ha,ha,ha,ha,ha! What the hell?! Ha,ha,ha,ha! Jesus! You crack me up. I could use a good laugh. Ha,ha,ha! Tell you what? In honor of your new found sense of humor, I&#39;ll let you go with ONE punch for TODAY. Ain&#39;t I magnomion?!&quot; &quot;Magnanimous... dumb-nuts!&quot; &quot;That&#39;s it! Now you&#39;re getting it!&quot; <br />
<br />
Gage winded up for a punch. &quot;I wish!&quot; Connor shouted. &quot;That Gage Matthews couldn&#39;t move!&quot; Even though he knew it worked, Connor braced himself for the punch, but it never came. &quot;What... the hell?!&quot; Connor heard Gage suddenly in a panic. He opened his eyes and sure enough, Gage&#39;s body was frozen in place, punch mid-air. His body shook as his arms fell down and to his side. His legs moved inwards until his body was standing straight. He could wiggle a bit, but Gage was stuck in that one spot. &quot;What is this?! I can&#39;t... I can&#39;t move at all! What the fuck did you do to me?!&quot; &quot;I told you Gagey-boy! This app grants my wishes. &quot;Don&#39;t fuck with me! You... You must have gassed me with something!&quot; &quot;Sorry, but no such gas exists. Especially one which only affects one person.&quot; &quot;Screw you! Give me an antidote!&quot; &quot;Unconvinced huh? You know for someone as dumb as you, you&#39;re not one to believe in the supernatural. So let&#39;s do some experimenting. First... I wish this room was locked!&quot; Sound of doors locking could be heard. &quot;Second, I wish no one besides Connor Watkins and Gage Matthews can be in this room!&quot; Nothing happened. &quot;Hah! You think this is enough to convince me?!&quot; Connor slapped him. &quot;Wha?!&quot; &quot;Of course not, dummy! I just need to make sure no one blows my cover!&quot; &quot;You... You sissy-ass bitch! When I get out of here, you&#39;re fucking dead, you hear me?!&quot; &quot;Sorry, Gage, but I&#39;m not afraid of you anymore, but when I&#39;m done with you, you&#39;ll definitely be afraid of me. I wish... that Gage Matthews was fully naked!&quot; Gage was looking at Connor talking when he suddenly felt a chill. He looked down. &quot;What... the fuck...?!&quot; Gage had been wearing clothes. He knew he had them on. But when he looked down, his dick was out in the open, flopping up and down. &quot;Wow! I could always tell, but you really do have the ideal male body.&quot; &quot;Oh god! Fuck!&quot; Gage squirmed in horror. He was bucked naked for Connor to see. &quot;Let&#39;s see... Damn! Do you have muscles!&quot; Connor moved up to Gage and moved his hands over his biceps. &quot;What are you doing?! Don&#39;t touch me!&quot; &quot;And your hands are so firm too. How many pounds can you lift?&quot; &quot;Fuck off dude! I ain&#39;t telling you shit!&quot; Connor slapped him again. &quot;You really don&#39;t understand the position you&#39;re in, do you? Now let&#39;s see... Hmm... Your teeth are absolutely perfect. Oh god! I can&#39;t wait!&quot; &quot;Mmf, mmf... spit!&quot; Gage&#39;s mouth was being handled by Connor next so he spit on him in response. &quot;Heh... I&#39;ll give you credit. You didn&#39;t become a bully by being a coward.... I wish Gage couldn&#39;t spit.&quot; All of the sudden, Gage&#39;s mouth felt completely dry. He tried to smack his lips, but no saliva formed. &quot;I wish the saliva on my face was gone.&quot; And just like that the saliva dripping from Connor&#39;s forehead was gone. At this point, Gage had to accept this wish granting app was the real deal. <br />
<br />
&quot;H... Hey, Connor. Listen, buddy. I&#39;m sorry. Please... Please let me go.&quot; &quot;Ah,ha,ha,ha,ha! Holy shit! The big bad Gage Matthews asking a lowly nerd for help. What a riot!&quot; Connor burst into laughter as he rested his hands on Gage&#39;s body. Nice pecs you got there dude. There just big enough that they don&#39;t look like breasts. Although your nipples are pretty hard right now.&quot; Connor was handling his upper body now as he played with Gage&#39;s nipples. &quot;Ah... Ah... Oh god! Please...&quot; &quot;Oops! Look&#39;s like your getting hard down there too.&quot; &quot;Ah... Of course I&#39;d get hard... It&#39;s natural right?&quot; &quot;So you do know that. Thought you were the type who thinks if girls were turned on, it meant they wanted it. I really am getting to know a lot about you... Ah. A ten pack. A motherfucking ten pack. This is just grand!&quot; Connor knelt down and grabbed Gage&#39;s leg with both hands. &quot;Damn, your legs are massive! Can&#39;t even... wrap both my hands around them... Even your feet are perfect. Bet you could crush a watermelon with them. And lastly...&quot; Connor got up and stared at Gage&#39;s now erect dick. &quot;No! No, stop!&quot; &quot;It&#39;s humongous! It&#39;s got to be at least over a foot long!&quot; &quot;Ah.. Ah.. Oh god!&quot; Connor grabbed Gage&#39;s dick and tired to measure it with his eyes. He then lifted it up so he could get a good look at his balls. &quot;They&#39;re huge of course. The size of a tennis ball maybe?&quot; He placed them on his palms to weigh them. &quot;Heavy too... Hey Gage, how long is your dick anyway?&quot; &quot;Why the hell do you wanna know, homo?!&quot; &quot;What was that?&quot; Connor suddenly grabbed onto his balls. &quot;Agh! Oh god!&quot; &quot;So what were you saying?!&quot; &quot;Ah! Ah! It-It&#39;s eight inches soft, fourteen inches erect! Agh!&quot; &quot;Holy shit! Hee-hee!&quot; &quot;Oh god, gotta....&quot; &quot;Hm?&quot; But before Connor could ask, Gage pissed all over him. &quot;Ahh...&quot; Connor stood there, not moving. &quot;Shit! Connor, that wasn&#39;t my fault! I just couldn&#39;t hold it in!&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t worry... I understand completely.&quot; &quot;Oh thank god!&quot; &quot;I wish Gage couldn&#39;t pee.&quot; And just like that, what dribbled out of Gage&#39;s penis dried up. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. It&#39;s only temporary. It&#39;d be pretty bad for me otherwise.&quot; &quot;What are you talking abo...?&quot; &quot;But I do need to punish you for this. &quot;But you just said!&quot; &quot;And how many times did you promise you would leave me alone, only for you to change your mind the next second?!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m sorry!&quot; &quot;Sorry doesn&#39;t cut it! I wish I was clean of Gage&#39;s piss!&quot; And just like that, Connor&#39;s shirt was completely dry. &quot;First things first... I wish Gage could cum for me!&quot; &quot;Huh?! Wait!&quot; Before Gage could object he could feel movement in his hand again. But that feeling was short lived, as it grabbed onto his dick and pumped it up and down. &quot;Ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah!&quot; &quot;Not half bad. You jerk yourself off pretty well. So while I&#39;m waiting....&quot; &quot;Ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah! What are you... Ah,ah... doing now... ah,ah,ah,ah?!&quot; &quot;This is a fine ass you have here!&quot; Then without warning, Connor grabbed onto Gage&#39;s ass. &quot;Ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah! Wait! Ah! Sto... Ahph!&quot; Connor ignored Greg&#39;s pleas and opened his ass wide. &quot;Cute little ass hole you got here too.&quot; Connor looked at it for a few seconds and then slapped Gage&#39;s butt cheeks back together. &quot;Ah! Ahhhhhhhh!&quot; And at the same time, he finally ejaculated. Big, thick cum shot out from the tip of his dick very quickly. &quot;Wow! Look at you go!&quot; &quot;Ah,ah,ah,ah,ah... Why?&quot; &quot;Hmm?&quot; &quot;Why are you doing this to me?&quot; &quot;Now now. I&#39;d hate to ruin the surprise. And besides, you still need to be punished first.&quot; &quot;What! What the fuck was that then?!&quot; &quot;Huh?! I just needed to see how could you cum, duh?!&quot; &quot;You... You&#39;re fucked in the head! You have to be!&quot; &quot;The guy who bullied people into depression really has no right to say that... You&#39;ve been nothing but bad boy. Now what is something bad boys do....? Oh yeah! Bad boys shit their pants!&quot; &quot;Ah... Please don&#39;t!&quot; &quot;I wish Gage Matthews would shit himself!&quot; &quot;Ah... Ah! No! I won&#39;t... Ugh... My stomach... Ugh... No... I don wanna!&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t fight it. You&#39;ll just hurt your ass.&quot; &quot;Ah... No.... Nooooooo!&quot; But Gage&#39;s pleas were to no avail as he finally pooped all over the floor. The big pieces of doody smashed down dirtying the back of his legs. &quot;Blegh!&quot; Apparently the attack on his stomach was too much as he threw up on the floor too. &quot;Ew! The bad boy made a messy-wessy! Now then... I think I&#39;ve done everything and then some. I wish this room was all clean again!&quot; And no sooner had it happened, was the shit and vomit all gone, like nothing had happened. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... Wah! Wah! Daddy! Help me! Blegh!&quot; Gage was done with everything now as he cried out like a baby. But Connor paid it no mind and just grabbed his mouth. &quot;Daddy isn&#39;t gonna help you here. In fact, he won&#39;t help you ever again. So shut it... Unless you need to... loosen up a little more.&quot; Hiiii! I&#39;ll stop! I&#39;ll stop!&quot; &quot;There, there. Good boy! Head pats!&quot; Connor treated Gage like a dog and made another wish. &quot;I wish Gage&#39;s body was working properly, but make sure he can&#39;t move.&quot; And just like that, saliva formed in Gage&#39;s mouth and he could feel like peeing again. &quot;And now for why we&#39;re REALLY here!&quot; &quot;Oh thank god!&quot; &quot;Now don&#39;t thank God just yet. How tall are you?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m... six feet five inches.&quot; &quot;And you&#39;re weight?&quot; &quot;Two... 225.&quot; &quot;Damn! And you&#39;re in THAT great of shape too! Well as you can see, I&#39;m basically a string bean.&quot; Connor said as he started to take off his clothes. &quot;I&#39;m 6&#39; 2&#39;&#39; which isn&#39;t that bad I suppose, but I weigh only 125 pounds and my body is as white and light as can be. And of course...&quot; Conner said as he took off his underwear. &quot;... My dick is Pa-The-Tic!&quot; &quot;What... What are you saying?! Why are you telling me all this?! Just please let me go! I promise with my life that I&#39;ll never so much as touch you again! So please!&quot; &quot;Well of course you won&#39;t Gagey-boy, because...&quot; And as Connor gave an evil smile, &quot;You and I are gonna swap bodies.&quot; &quot;Huh?&quot; &quot;That&#39;s why I needed to check out your body.&quot; &quot;Wait.&quot; I needed to know everything about you.&quot; &quot;Stop it.&quot; &quot;And now I know everything about you.&quot; &quot;You&#39;re joking, right?&quot; &quot;I even know how you pee and poop.&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t.&quot; &quot;And now everything is ready.&quot; &quot;I&#39;m begging you.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s time for...&quot; &quot;Anything but that.&quot; &quot;...Me to do the honors.&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t take my life away from meeeeeeeeeeeee!&quot; &quot;I, Connor Watkins, wish I could be Gage Matthews. And Gage Matthews will become Connor Watkins in return... of course!&quot; &quot;Nooooooooooooo! Agh... Hack... guh... blegh!&quot; Suddenly, Gage&#39;s body jutted back as an unpleasant feeling arose from his throat. And out from his mouth did a lone shining ball, his soul, fly out of his body. He could feel himself fall down onto the floor as he lost consciousness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; &quot;Ugh...&quot; &quot;Hey, wakey-wakey Gagey-baby!&quot; &quot;Ugh... Hmm... Who is that?&quot; &quot;Rise and shine, sleepyhead.&quot; &quot;Ugh... That voice... It sounds... familiar....&quot; Gage Matthews slowly opened his eyes as he adjusted to the light. &quot;Finally! Took you long enough, Gage!&quot; &quot;Why am I...&quot; &quot;Oh sorry I should be saying, took you long enough... Connor!&quot; &quot;What?!&quot; Suddenly, Gage&#39;s eyes shot wide open. In front of him was his body peering over him. &quot;Co... Connor...? Is that you?&quot; Hey, is that anyway to treat your senior, Connor?!&quot; &quot;I... Hm... What the heck?!&quot; Gage tried to move, but found himself unable to. He looked around and saw he was laying down on one of the benches. He was still naked as his arms and legs were tied behind him with locker chains. &quot;Finally noticed huh? Hope you like your first time being bullied!&quot; Conner, now in Gage&#39;s body, moved towards the exit. &quot;No! Wait! Don&#39;t leave me here!&quot; Gage, now Connor, struggled in vain to get loose, but to no avail. &quot;Sorry Connor! But Gage Matthews doesn&#39;t help nerds like you! Oh yeah. And one more thing. I transferred the app to your phone. Of course its my phone now, so don&#39;t think you can make wishes now. Buh-bye!&quot; &quot;No wait! Connnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnner!&quot; And just like that Gage Matthews left Connor Watkins to his life.</p>
