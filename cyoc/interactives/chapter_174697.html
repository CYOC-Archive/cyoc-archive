<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Both Jack and Hank took little John from the geriatric Paul and got him to calm down. After placing the dice in his hands, and then making sure that John didn’t try to eat them, the father/son duo got the baby-minded boy to toss the dice on the board. <br />
<br />
“I’m not sure if I want him to be younger or older at this point,” Jack remarked, “Especially if he’s going to act like a baby regardless.”<br />
John’s character moved on the board by itself, and landed on a positive space. <br />
<br />
“Plus nine,” Hank said. “Welp, we are going to have a bona fide adult baby,” he said as they backed away from John on the floor. <br />
Still wearing only a diaper, John began to grow from his real age of ten up through puberty. He grew a bit of a mustache, and then a bit of a happy trail. His legs lengthened, his arms too, his hands growing more manly. The hair on his head turned curlier and stayed as a bowl cut, keeping his ever babyish. As he settled into adulthood, he wasn’t very manly at all, actually. At nineteen, John was a twinkish babe, growing little hair on his lithe body, a far cry from the grizzly 96-year-old that was his “baby” brother. Any true indicator that he was mature was covered by the thickest diaper anyone had ever seen. <br />
<br />
John himself watching as his frame grew larger, and not able to comprehend it, started to wail again; this time, in the tambor of a young man. It was certainly no more pleasant than before, but it didn’t keep Paul from joking to himself. <br />
“Whaaat…happeeeeeennnn?” John wailed in Paul’s direction. <br />
“Well, he did want to grow older when we started,” Paul said. “I guess this was what he thought it would be like! If this is actually how he turns out, he’ll likely look more kid like than me at that age!”<br />
“It’s probably from the game,” Bobbie said. “I mean, I certainly wasn’t going to grow up like this before the game started. It’s probably just keeping him on the path of a hairless, small, baby adult.”<br />
As soon as she said that, an unmistakable blurt came from John’s direction. Crying throughout, the smell of John’s involuntary indiscretion filled the air, causing the rest of the group to groan wildly. <br />
“Nope, nope, nope,” Jack said. “This is not why I bought this game. I’m not being around my best friend’s dirty diapers. I’m out.” <br />
Jack started to walk out of the room, but Hank grabbed him. <br />
“You’re not leaving, son,” Hank said, sternly. “You want to be an adult so badly, well, part of that is taking care of messes that you create. You wanted your friends to play this game, so now you have to take care of them, whatever state they are in.”<br />
More noises were made as John expelled…whatever it was that was inside him before. <br />
“Please, andale,” Ellis said, pinching his nose. “I’m not playing the rest of this game with poopy-pants stinking up the room.”<br />
Everyone looked at Hank and Jack, the two most capable bodies in the room. <br />
“Why do I have to do it?” Jack whined to everyone. “This is not fair. I just want to be older and have fun being older, not change diapers and take care of shit like that.”<br />
“Jack, language,” Hank snapped. <br />
“Yeah, yeah. Whatever, ‘dad,’” Jack said, walking out of the room. <br />
 Hank shook his head. He didn’t expect to be put in this position when he joined the game with the rest of the kids, but he was so surprised that his son would act like this. They might have looked the same age, but everyone could tell who was more mature. He’d have to have some talks with the boy once this whole ordeal was over…that is, as long as Jack didn’t win the game and mess up his age.<br />
“Okay,” Hank said, above the noise of the still wailing John. “I’m going to need your help, Paul. I know it’s a bit hard for you to move around, but maybe you could roll and get a bit more spry?”<br />
“Glad to try,” Paul said. “Could someone hand me the dice? It’s a bit hard to bend over at my age.” <br />
Bobbie handed Paul the dice. He threw them towards the board, and his piece moved to a negative space. The orb revealed “-5.” <br />
“Well, not much of a change, but something,” Paul remarked as he started to get a bit younger. “Early nineties here I come!”<br />
Not much changed, Paul hunched a bit less, and looked a tad more lively. The changes were over soon, so Paul and Hank started to hatch a plan to take care of the adult baby in the room. <br />
“I have no clue what we are going to change him into,” Hank said. He looked over at Paul, trying to remember that the person he was now relying on as a mature figure was actually the youngest person in the room. “We will have to think of something though. I’m sure I have baby wipes, but certainly no diapers that will fit him the same as this adult sized one.”<br />
<br />
“I think I am going to leave the room while you two figure this out,” Bobbie said. “It reeks in here.”<br />
“Yeah,” Ellis agreed. “I’ll come with you.”<br />
<br />
--<br />
Jack had enough of that game. Honestly, at the moment, his best friend could stay a poopy baby if he had the chance to be an adult for a bit. It seemed like the game was against him, trying to make him younger, even when he had a brief chance to be older. <br />
He ran away to his dad’s bedroom to snoop around. He knew that his dad had to have some fun…adult stuff? Somewhere? Looking in his dad’s drawers, all he could find was some clean tighty-whities. Maybe he could put in on? What fun would that be? They would be too big for his 18-year-old frame. He tried digging deeper in the drawer, but nothing. <br />
He looked under the bed, in the closet…all his dad had was normal boring adult clothes and books and junk. Then Jack looked in the side table drawer. Boring papers, cords…ah! Condoms! That was something new. He looked in the drawer underneath…and to his surprise, found a dildo. <br />
Questions ran wild inside. Was his dad gay? Was this someone elses? Did he use it? Did he use it often?<br />
Should he use it?<br />
Jack looked at the condoms, the dildo, looking further, he found some lube…he stared at the objects, and even as his brain told him to put them away, his hardening penis suggested otherwise. <br />
--<br />
Bobbie and Ellis made their way downstairs to the kitchen and sat next to each other at the table. At first they were quiet, but then, Ellis spoke up.<br />
<br />
“It’s been a crazy game, for sure,” he said. <br />
Bobbie nodded along. “Yep, for sure.”<br />
“It’s kind of cool that we are both thirteen, though. Finally teenagers together,” Ellis added. <br />
“It’s certainly not what I expected, even after being an adult for a little while,” Bobbie said. <br />
“Of course, I mean,” Ellis said, fishing for the right words. “It’s a bit different now. For you, I mean.”<br />
“You don’t have to remind me,” Bobbie replied, rolling her eyes as Ellis’ awkwardness. There was something about being a girl that was making her more confident. And even though it was true that they were both thirteen, Bobbie knew she was more mature for her age. The body she currently was in had been through puberty for a bit already, whereas Ellis was just starting. That being said, she could also tell, Ellis had the hots for her. <br />
“What is it like,” Ellis asked, coming out and saying it bluntly. <br />
“Being a girl?” Bobbie finished his question. “Different. Strange. Comfortable. I don’t know. It scares me a bit, but it also feels, right?”<br />
Ellis’ eyes went wide. “Are you saying you’d rather be a girl, Bobbie?”<br />
“It wouldn’t be that bad,” Bobbie said. “It’s just a different set of parts, right? I mean, I guess I couldn’t be one of ‘the boys’ anymore.”<br />
“I think, if you were a girl,” Ellis said, leaning in a bit closer, “I’d like to hang with you still.”<br />
Bobbie noticed Ellis getting closer to her. <br />
“Oh my gosh, Ellis,” Bobbie said. “You’re not sly.”<br />
Ellis pulled back, “Wuh, what do you mean?”<br />
“What do you want, to kiss me? Feel by boobs?”<br />
“No! No! I mean,” Ellis said, shirking away. “You’re my friend. My guy friend.” <br />
“With boobs and a vagina,” Bobbie said. <br />
They sat there in silence for a moment, and then, Bobbie leaned over and kissed Ellis on the cheek. <br />
Ellis looked at Bobbie with shock. “Why’d you do that?”<br />
Bobbie shrugged. “Wanted to see if I liked it.”<br />
“Did you?” Ellis asked. <br />
“I’ll have to think about that,” Bobbie replied. <br />
They sat in silence, then…<br />
“Can I try,” Ellis asked. “Kissing your cheek, I mean?”<br />
“Sure,” Bobbie said as strongly as she could. But when Ellis moved in closer, she turned her head to meet his lip with her own. Ellis jumped back for only a second, and then he went back to kissing her again. Soon, they were making out with the awkward fervor that comes with every teenage makeout session. <br />
--<br />
“It was bound to happen at some time,” Paul said. “With his baby brain, plus with all the growing and shrinking, probably does something to your bowels.”<br />
The two men looked down at the grown John on the floor. He was still whining, but had mostly calmed down, sucking his thumb while waiting for his dirty diaper to be changed. <br />
“I’ve got the wipes,” Hank said. “You undo the tapes and peel it back, then get ready with the make-shift bedsheet diaper.”<br />
“You got it. Don’t forget to powder my baby brother, now,” Paul replied. He leaned down and un-stuck the tapes, holding his breathe as he pulled back the diaper to expose his brother. “Keep your hand out of the way, Baby John.”<br />
Soon the men assessed the damage. It wasn’t a total mess, but the stick and the sheer size of it, due to John’s grown up body, was the hard part. Hank grabbed John’s twinkish legs and lifted them up as best he could. John’s body was technically a year older than Hank’s current one, so it felt like he was changing a peer. <br />
It took a fair bit of wipes, but soon John was clean. Hank taped up the disposable diaper and walked away to dispose it, leaving John naked on the floor. <br />
“Go ahead and position that cloth diaper underneath him,” I’ll throw this away in the trash outside.<br />
“Will do,” Paul said as Hank left. Just as he started to finagle the bed sheet mess underneath, Hank noticed something in John’s original spot. It appeared as if a new disposable diaper had just spawned for them. Paul shuffled over to retrieve it. Unfolding it, he realized it would be a lot better an option for any future accidents. <br />
“Look here, Baby John,” Paul said. “It looks like the game wants us to keep you diapered up good and tight.” He looked back over at his brother and saw John sucking his thumb with one hand and absentmindedly stroking his dick with the other. Shocked, he shuffled over to John to catch him in the act. “No, John! Stop that! Babies don’t play with their peepees!”  <br />
John didn’t seem to care, so Paul swatted his hand away. This started John crying anew. Paul ignored as best as he could laying the diaper underneath him and trying to get John to keep his legs open. It started to become a bit of a mess as Paul sprinkled a very liberal layer of baby powder over his genitals. White dust went everywhere, causing Paul to cough and a layer of powder to cover everything. Even though baby John was still quite erect, Paul did the best he could to get the man-baby’s dick back where it should be. <br />
“Now, be a good baby,” Paul said, trying to prop up his brother. “You can have fun like that when you are older.”<br />
--<br />
“Care to explain what you two were up to?” Hank said to Ellis and Bobbie, still holding the stinky diaper. <br />
“We are sorry, Mr. Jack’s dad,” Bobbie said, fessing up to their canoodling. There wasn’t much to confess, since Hank had caught Ellis on top of her with their tongues in each other’s mouths. <br />
“We were just having some fun,” Ellis said. “It was my idea anyways.” Bobbie noticed as Ellis took the blame, doing his best to protect her. <br />
“You two are, well, kids,” Hank said. “I guess it’s not that big of a deal in the larger scale of things. But Bobbie is a girl, if things could have gone further, you could have both been in big trouble.”<br />
Both teenagers looked at Hank with confusion. “What do you mean,” Bobbie asked. <br />
“Like, if you two had sex,” Hank clarified. “I wouldn’t put it past this game to get you pregnant.”<br />
“She’s not old enough to get pregnant, right?” Ellis asked, suddenly scared that he had done something terrible.<br />
“Maybe not usually, but these bodies are,” Hank said. “You should be fine. Just, please be careful for now. I don’t want to stop you two from getting close, but we should probably finish this game.” He held up the giant diaper for extra emphasis. <br />
Ellis thought about what Jack’s dad said, about getting close. Before Bobbie had turned into a girl, he would have never thought of her that way. But now, he wondered what would happen at the end of the game. He’d just made out with one of his best friends…<br />
“You two go upstairs. I’ll be up there as soon as I get rid of this and find Jack,” Hank said. <br />
--<br />
It had taken a condom, or three, to figure out how to put one on his dick, but Jack had figured it out. He stood in the mirror, buck naked, looking at his eighteen-year-old body, what he’d look like at his prime. He much preferred his older, bald self, but even this was better than being his original age. Before starting this game, he’d never thought about sexual stuff, but something about the new hormones flowing through his body was making him want to try all kinds of things. <br />
He had to win this game. He needed to skip to this age. Knowing what he now knew, there was no reason for Jack to waste time growing through puberty. Skip all that stuff! Bring on the fun!<br />
The point of having a condom on his cock illuded him, but from his earlier adventure, he knew it would catch what he would soon create. He put another condom on the dildo he found. He’d never though about having a guy penetrate his hole before, but now looking at the silicone cock, he wondered what it would feel like. <br />
He stepped into the shower and mounted the suction of the dildo to the wall. He took a bottle of lubricant he found and slathered it on. Slowly, he tried to back up onto the cock. He felt the pressure of his first time of penetration. It started to hurt, so he backed off. Not wanting to come this far and quit, he tried again, and this time, he felt as the dildo entered him. <br />
His cock was extra hard now, and he began pumping it as he slowly pumped his body on the dildo. He felt a new pressure build inside him, something he’d never experienced before, growing more and more pleasurable as he fucked himself. He started to sweat, wondering what he was building to. <br />
Then, he heard as the door started to open. In a panic, he pulled the show curtain to cover himself from being seen in the act. He turned on the water to make it seem like he was just getting in the shower. <br />
“Jack,” his dad said. “What are you doing? We need to finish the game.”<br />
“I’m taking a shower, Dad,” Jack replied. “Lay off, I’ll be done in a while.”<br />
Under normal circumstances, Hank wasn’t going to invade his son’s privacy. But he’d had enough. Not only was Jack being suspicious, he was acting like a baby. Hank walked over to the shower and peeled back the curtain. <br />
Frankly, he had expected to find Jack naked, but not with his dildo up his ass. <br />
“What the fuck are you doing,” Jack screamed, covering himself as best he could. <br />
Hank said nothing. Instead, he turned the shower water to freezing cold and watching as Jack jumped off his dildo with a pop, lunging for a towel to warm and cover himself.<br />
--<br />
A few minutes later, Hank and Jack walked into the game room. Jack’s hair was still wet, but he was wearing new clothes from his father’s room. <br />
“What happened here,” Paul asked, noticing the grimacing Jack. <br />
“Nothing that needs repeating,” Hank said. He noticed the disposable diaper on John. “Where did that come from?”<br />
“Seems the game is providing everything we need to keep playing,” Paul replied. “Which, I believe it is now time for Ellis to roll, since we’ve cleaned up our mess here.”<br />
Ellis looked over at Bobbie. He was nervous something would happen to the both of them. He wanted to keep spending time together like they were, since it seemed to be the perfect age for both of them. But, he also knew that the game had to end sometime. Conflicted, he picked up the dice and threw them on the board.<br />
His piece began to move a far distance. A knot formed in his stomach as he landed on a negative space, with the orb showing “-11.” <br />
“Mierda,” he said, looking at Bobbie. He began to shrink down to what was going to be his youngest age this game. He grew less tall, going past his original nine years old. His hair grew shorter, his baby fat came back. He felt as his penis and balls sucked back into himself, his weenie getting smaller. His clothes shifted too, getting younger looking, and then finally as his pants turned into little toddler shorts. He looked up at the others as the smallest in the room, a little latin toddler now. His undies turned into a pull-up, and he found that he was now barefoot, running around just like his mamí let him when he was two. <br />
“Aw,” Bobbie remarked. “My little Ellis is so cute as a toddler.”<br />
“Don’t be mean,” Ellis replied in a high pitched voice. “For all you know, you’re about to join me.”<br />
Bobbie didn’t waste time. She picked up the dice and threw them down. She didn’t move far, but she did move onto a positive space. <br />
“No such luck for you, Ellis,” Bobbi said as she watched the orb showed a “+9.”<br />
The group watched as Bobbie grew into a woman, her height increasing, her face growing more mature and her hair growing longer, her orange locks flowing down her back. She felt as he hips grew wider, her clothes turning into a knee length grey dress, filled out nicely by her expanding breasts. She felt herself sit up straighter, and as she settled into a 22-year-old woman, she gave herself an obligatory pump of her breasts. <br />
“Wow,” Bobbie said. “These are super cool. I wish you guys could try this.”<br />
Ellis looked up at Bobbie. Before, he had thought of her as attractive, and he still did. But now, she was like the most beautiful person in the world to him. Someone to give a big hug to, rather than someone he wanted to give an icky kiss to. <br />
“I feel very alone down here,” Ellis said. “I know I’m not the only one in diapers, but I’m the only small one.”<br />
“You’re too cute,” Bobbie said. “Without asking, she picked him up underneath his arms. “Why don’t you sit on my lap for a while.”<br />
Ellis’ eyes lit up. “Okay.” He nestled his head in Bobbie’s neck as she began to cradle the toddler. <br />
Everyone turned to Jack, but Jack just shook his head. “Aren’t you guys happy like this? We could just stop now and stay!”<br />
“Nice try, whippersnapper,” Paul said, running his hand’s through his older brother’s hair. “How am I supposed to explain to our parents that I’m an old fart and my brother’s now an adult baby? Hm?”<br />
“You better roll, Jack,” Bobbie said. “I know you guys can tell, I do like this body, but we have to finish the game.”<br />
“Listen to your friends,” Hank said. “If you aren’t going to respect me, respect your friend’s wishes.”<br />
He knew there was no way out of rolling, but maybe there was something else Jack could do. He got down on the floor and pick up the dice, but instead of rolling them, he positioned them in his hand just so…<br />
“What are you doing, son?” Hank said, clearly spotting foul play. <br />
“Making sure things are a bit more ‘positive’ for me,” Jack replied. He counted out how many spaces he needed to get to a positive spot, and then, he positioned the dice in his hand so, that when he rolled it…<br />
The dice landed on the board, moving Jack long and far to the positive space furthest away from his character. His character started to move, and landed on the space he wanted for only a brief moment. Jack’s eyes went wide as his character keep moving, on towards the end of the game. It looked like he would win, but he was one space short, and landed on a random space.<br />
“Oh, fuck,” Jack said. “What did I do?”<br />
“Cheated,” the little Ellis chimed in. “Like a cheater.”<br />
The orb showed the words “Bad Attitude Birthday Boy,” and then the random space seemed to swallow Jack’s character into the board itself! The ? on the space now read “STUCK.” And then, the changes began. <br />
As the whole group expected at this point, Jack began to shrink down in age. He descended back through puberty, gaining his baby fat back. His clothes disappeared, leaving him in his own snow-white diaper. Jack could feel his genitals shrinking as well, smaller than was they had been before. All the built-up horniness he had been experiencing earlier faded with a snap, and though he couldn’t confirm it, his once adult cock was now a baby nub and tiny nuts on a smooth crotch. <br />
He kept shrinking and shrinking, his legs and arms getting baby fat, his hair getting thinner and shorter. He thought he’d change all the way, but he settled around a toddler age, about where Ellis was at two. Just when he though his punishment was over, the diaper he was wearing grew in volume, thrusting his legs apart, until he was forced to sit on his bum. A onesie appeared on him in baby blue, accenting the new diaper he wore, a bonnet was tied around his head. Finally, mittens appeared on his hands and a little baby pacifier was locked on his head as well. <br />
It was clear from what everyone was seeing, Jack was going to be staying like this for the rest of the game. In fact, it looked like the game was putting him in complete timeout for cheating, which meant he probably couldn’t win either. <br />
“I think we will let that speak for itself,” Hank said. “I suppose the game is trying to be the authority figure that I was failing at being.”<br />
“Don’t be too hard on yourself,” Bobbie said. “Jack was being a nuisance, anyways. I’m sure this will help us finish, now. He’ll just have to spend a few rounds like this.”<br />
“It looks like one of you will probably win here pretty soon,” Hank said. “Time for my roll, anyway.”<br />
Hank rolled and his character moved, landing him on a positive spot. He saw a plus four on the board, and watched as he started to grow up again, finding again that he was mostly bald, chubbing up just a tad bit, and seeing his first tattoo showing on his upper arm. <br />
“Hey, now I’m twenty-two,” Hank said. “Look at up, Bobbie. Two twenty-two-year olds with two terrible twos in their ward.”<br />
Everyone except John and Jack laughed as the round ended. John had grown to adult-babyhood at 19, Paul got a bit younger at 91, Ellis shrank to 2 years, Bobbie grew to 22, Jack was stuck permanently at 2 years, and then Hank grew to 22 as well.</p>
