<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I bit my lip. <i>How am I going to answer this?</i> I hated the thought of lying to Kelly. I had always been a pretty honest guy, and now, with this special bond, the idea actually hurt. On the other hand, how could I say that oh yeah, I&#39;d made her naked in the street? How would <i>that</i> affect our bond?<br />
<br />
<i>Everything was so nice... why&#39;d she have to ruin it?</i> But no, I shouldn&#39;t blame her. I was the one who&#39;d messed up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joe?&quot; she prompted, a hint of worry in her voice.<br />
<br />
<i>Well shit.</i> I drew a shaky breath, I had to say something, and fast, or she&#39;d get suspicious. In a way, I almost wished she would -- that she&#39;d just use the ring on me so I wouldn&#39;t have to confess.<br />
<br />
<i>Wait.</i> I had refrained from mentioning her sandals for just this reason, so I could cite them as the thing I&#39;d experimented on. There was something else I could mention too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I uh... remember how you were wearing shoes earlier earlier? And then sandals? I, uh, wished them on you. The sandals, I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
I could feel her body shift as she turned her head to look down at me. I did not look back, just kept staring up at the sky.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that all?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A-actually, no, I also made your key appear in your purse. Remember when you couldn&#39;t find it? I think it was, um...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My mail key?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a moment of silence. Then, &quot;Joe... I can feel you tensing. Your heart is racing. What&#39;s wrong? Are you...&quot; A note of doubt slipped in. &quot;Are you telling the truth?&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Damn it!</i> My tactics hadn&#39;t worked. Of course I couldn&#39;t fool a big, smart wolf girl like Kelly. Her senses were too keen. And now I was back where I started -- worse, after trying to dodge the truth. My fingers curled, my claws pricking into my palm-pads. Again, I found myself wishing she&#39;d just use the ring -- it would be so much easier!<br />
<br />
But... she didn&#39;t. She... <i>trusted</i> me to answer without coercion. I grit my teeth. I would have to man up... vixen up...? and tell her. As hard as this was -- as much as I feared what it would do to our new-found relationship -- I just couldn&#39;t lie. Kelly deserved the truth, and <i>I</i> wanted to be worthy of that trust. I needed to be honest with her if I wanted to be worthy of being her mate. Of carrying her babies.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-well... mostly.&quot; Her grip on me tightened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joseph Waverley. <i>What did you do?</i>&quot; Now she sounded tense, as well as worried.<br />
<br />
Drawing a deep breath, I turned my muzzle away from her. &quot;I... I made your clothes disappear,&quot; I whispered. &quot;I... I&#39;m sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Silence. I was still too afraid to look over at her face. Then, in a flat tone of voice:<br />
<br />
&quot;You did what?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry!&quot; I burst out. Suddenly I found myself shaking, wrapping my arms and tail around myself, almost sobbing. &quot;I -- I know it was a bad thing to do, and I... I should have told you sooner, but I was scared. I d-didn&#39;t want --&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Joseph. Joe.&quot; She rolled onto her side, and her powerful arms gently grabbed me and moved me onto my side as well so that I faced her. I turned my muzzle towards her, and then I saw it. The smile pulling at her lips. And I realised her response had not been one of anger. Just incredulity. As she stroked the backs of her claws across my cheek fluff, I relaxed a bit. &quot;It&#39;s okay, Joe. Just... seriously?&quot; She snorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re... you&#39;re not... mad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pfff, no. Well... maybe a little. You need to ask a girl before you undress her, you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I -- it&#39;s not like I <i>wanted</i> to see you naked!&quot; I blushed under my fur, thinking back to that awkward moment. It almost seemed unreal; back when we were human, and our positions reversed. &quot;Well, okay I guess I <i>did</i> but... I wasn&#39;t <i>thinking,</i> the idea just sort of popped into my head and --&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were such a naughty boy that you couldn&#39;t resist.&quot; She giggled in her low, sexy voice, then playfully flicked her tongue across my nose. &quot;I understand. It&#39;s not that big a deal -- how can I be mad about you seeing me naked after you let me fuck you? Although.&quot; She became thoughtful for a minute. &quot;Hm. I actually... can&#39;t quite remember what happened. Like, I <i>do</i> know I was naked for a moment or too, but it&#39;s really fuzzy. You messed with my memories?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; My ears dipped again. &quot;Yes. I made it so everyone wouldn&#39;t notice. It,,, it was a clumsy attempt to spare you embarrassment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Joseph Waverley.&quot; She sighed in exasperation. &quot;I&#39;m more pissed about <i>that</i> than I am about the nudity. But... it all turned out okay. I&#39;m a big sexy werewolf, and you&#39;re my little vixen. I forgive you.&quot; She punctuated that with another, longer lick across the top of my muzzle, and I wrapped my arms around her, pulling myself in to snuggle against her soft breasts and solid body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Kelly. I <i>am</i> really sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
~ ~ ~ <b>Kelly</b> ~ ~ ~<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, Joe. I know.&quot; I chuckled, feeling my breasts quake, making hers jiggle in response as I held her to me. &quot;You don&#39;t have to keep saying it.&quot; The poor thing was still kind of tense, and I stroked her comfortingly. <br />
<br />
She pulled her head from under my chin, and met my eyes; her golden irises still a bit shimmery with tears. &quot;You&#39;re really not mad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, sweetie.&quot; I nuzzled over her again, then began licking and kissing until she began to giggle and squirm to get away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heehee, stahp!&quot; I relented, and she finally relaxed. &quot;Thanks, Kelly. You really <i>are</i> the best. Much better than I deserve.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hush. How many guys would give me the chance to live out my fantasies like this? Would just <i>give away</i> all that power? We all make stupid mistakes, Joe, and I think you&#39;re a wonderful boy. And an even better girl.&quot; My lips quirked a bit. &quot;Though it is a good thing I have the ring now. It needs someone responsible to look after it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another foxy giggle. &quot;You know what?&quot; She nuzzled me back, and continued in a softer voice. &quot;I agree. I&#39;m much happier that you have the ring. My big bad sexy wolfess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop calling me that!&quot; I laughed. &quot;It&#39;s so corny!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, but I like it. It&#39;s so true! You <i>are</i> the biggest, baddest, <i>sexiest</i> werewolfess I&#39;ve ever seen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re the sexiest werevixen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have you to thank for that.&quot; She pressed herself up against me, rubbing her tits into mine. &quot;Want me to thank you <i>properly?</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haven&#39;t you had enough of that?&quot; I protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re the one who wished for a slutty vixen in heat,&quot; she purred. &quot;You can&#39;t blame me for wanting that big, bad wolfess cock in me again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I -- suppose not.&quot; Maybe a good fucking was just what we both needed after that tense moment. And her big, firm melons squeezing against mine was starting to feel pretty good. So did the still-new feel of my groin tensing and pushing out that big, fat, hard shlong. Still... there were some things I wanted to address before I gave myself to another round of passion, and I said as much to Joe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? Such as?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorting out the mess you made with the ring, for one. Proper rules for lycanthropy for another. I don&#39;t want it to stay with just -- just us, you know.&quot; I meant simply to spread it around to people who wanted it. However -- maybe it was due to the armful of sexy vixen grinding into me, but my mind immediately jumped to the idea of accumulating more hot anthro girls <i>for myself.</i> A harem, if you will. &quot;Hrrrm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Hrrrm&#39; what?&quot; Joe stopped her grinding for a moment, cocking her head. She looked so cute it made me laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just something that occurred to me. I&#39;ll tell you later. But yeah, settle down and let me think.&quot;<br />
<br />
First I wished for my memory to be restored, thinking about the blur surrounding my meeting with Joe earlier. And man, was it restored. I grimaced as I remembered screaming in shock, and embarrassment, all the people looking at my hot, nude body. And I realised how much I had changed -- now I&#39;d revel in people looking at me naked. Especially in my wolf form.<br />
<br />
Everything followed from that, playing out in crystal clarity in my head. I raised an eyebrow at one detail. &quot;You wished the sandals on me while I was still naked?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Err-- uh, yeah.&quot; The vixen&#39;s ears folded down again. &quot;I-I was afraid you&#39;d hurt your feet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hahaha. You were so sweet even as a pervy boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;H-hey!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you made my clothes reappear before letting me in on the ring.&quot; I nuzzled her. &quot;Like I said, hon, you&#39;re sweet. Remembering all this, I&#39;m not mad at all. Lots of boys would have...&quot; I growled. &quot;I don&#39;t want to think about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me either.&quot; She shivered in my grasp, and we hugged each other tight for a minute.<br />
<br />
<i>So let&#39;s see...</i> I wished for the sandals to turn back into my old shoes. While I was at it, I wished for our ruined clothes to mend themselves and appear folded neatly on the bench where I&#39;d counted down. Might as well, right? The next thing...<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Shhii-oot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe gave me another cute, quizzical look as I frowned. &quot;What&#39;s wrong, Kelly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing you did, hon. Well, sort of, but at my request. I just realised in my eagerness to &#39;set the stage&#39; for being a werewolf, I basically had you erase an afternoon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Oh. Well... couldn&#39;t you just... rewind if it you wanted?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope. I wished to know if I could and, while I could technically make it four o&#39;clock again, I can&#39;t <i>undo</i> what&#39;s happened. All the people who left work and went home to bed because it was suddenly 9 would still be asleep. At 4 P.M. So no, I can&#39;t really turn back time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh. So it does have limitations. And...&quot; She stuck her tongue out at me. &quot;Nice to have confirmation.&quot;<br />
<br />
I blinked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Confirmation... of what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That we do <i>all</i> make stupid mistakes.&quot; And just like that, she swiped my nose with her tongue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tch! You... <i>touché,</i> Joe. <i>Touché.</i> Anyway, I guess there&#39;s nothing to do but be more careful about future wishes. Speaking of...&quot;<br />
<br />
I pondered. I was about to set up the parameters of my fantasy, and I wanted it to be <i>perfect.</i> After severat minutes, I was satisfied that I had everything lined up in my mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish...&quot;</p>
