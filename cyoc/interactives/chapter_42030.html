<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jasmine saw her work, and knew she had done the will of Allah, for unlike those Nazarene <br />
angels, she could do no less, and she was proud of that fact, and satisfied unlike -some- <br />
Angel at the dawn of things, her pride wouldn't make her forget her place in the chain of <br />
command nor blindly believe that she knew better than her superiors. The fact that the <br />
remaining two thirds of Nazarene angels still loyal to Allah could act and react more <br />
dynamically than her Islamic kin was something Jasmine begrudgingly admitted and <br />
equally begrudgingly admitted to the need for their existence in the expressions of Allah's <br />
Will. <br />
<br />
Jasmine's work had not ended with the dismantling of the kingdom of illusions, she had <br />
much work left to do. As for why she had chosen to keep a female shell after having her <br />
body made into a human once again, well, what better way to prove she was no <br />
misogynist? Her shell was just that, a shell, it wasn't her so she didn't have a mortal's <br />
warped fixation on two parts of their gene sequence. <br />
<br />
The toppling of the circular walls of mirrors surrounding human beings had not ended the <br />
conflict between the faiths... technically. With Allah and his Messengers finally free to <br />
speak to His People again freely, the feud between Islam, Jews and Christians had ended in <br />
a day in a half. Jasmine smirk, 'Just needed to remind them that they were all worship <br />
different facets of the SAME God!' It was hard to tell your men that you were fighting for <br />
the will of your god when Messengers of said god appeared to say otherwise... of course <br />
there were plenty who DARED call Jasmine a rebel messenger in disguise... she changed <br />
their minds quickly enough via methods that none of those men would admit to any other <br />
man for as long as they lived if they wished to save face (Similarly amusing and rather <br />
poetic given current events tactics had been applied by her counter parts on male and <br />
female dissenters of the Jews and Christians).  The irony of the angel of the jihad ripping <br />
away the self righteous 'religious' mask of a terror group wasn't lost Jasmine knowing the <br />
modern association with the word of her station. <br />
<br />
When the KKK were told in a divine vision that were all mass excommunicated at first they <br />
all laughed since none of them were Catholics... then it was made clear that they wasn't <br />
exactly what they were being excommunicated from... Now the hate group was trying it's <br />
hardest to keep from imploding! <br />
<br />
Jasmine was realistic enough to see mythicals who were murdered for the 'crime' of being <br />
mythicals by paranoid humans, but she was also practical enough to know these same <br />
humans would have simply murdered a homosexual or a negro instead of Project Return <br />
hadn't happened.  Then there were the mythicals who could now show off their <br />
'superiority' without fear of blowing their cover... Of course 'species' had been added to <br />
police data basis and ID profiles along with skin color and weight... It was easier to prove <br />
you couldn't have been at that murder scene when you could honestly say you were <br />
visiting a 300 year old point eared relative, and harder to say there was no way you could <br />
have been at the murder scene when you had the ability to open gates from one location <br />
to another within a certain radius...  <br />
<br />
Of course, the peace between the three facets of The Truth and advent of project return, <br />
didn't end the healthy competition with all the OTHER theologies.... except for <br />
Sciencetologists and a certain religion LITERALLY made as a comical wit satire mockery of <br />
other faiths.  Jasmine actually found herself looking foreword to the Struggle with the <br />
Buddhists and the Hindus...  <br />
<br />
A cynical or overly pragmatic person would instantly jump to the conclusion that when <br />
Jasmine said 'struggle' she really meant 'war'..... such people would have been dead <br />
wrong.  <br />
<br />
On an almost amusing The Satanists, having chosen the name for organization originally <br />
out of irony rather than any demonic devotion, due the revelation that yes, Jehovah and <br />
Lucifer were indeed actually entities, VERY quickly changed their name to 'Human Self-<br />
Actualizer' and then after about a few dozen or so irritated letters the next day changed it <br />
again to 'Mortal Self-Actualizers.' <br />
<br />
&quot;You know.... all things considered... it almost a shame that the four new Nazarenes  and <br />
the cherub, Kyriel,&quot; 'I hate to admit it... but her true self really is as cute as her shell.'  &quot;It's <br />
almost a shame we couldn't work together more, but I am of Islam and they are of <br />
Nazareth, they have their place and their role and I have mine...&quot; Jasmine allowed herself to <br />
smile knowing no one else would see it.   <br />
<br />
That was when Jasmine's divine senses went off, like a human singling out one snowflake <br />
during winter she sensed it... And her gut twisted in disgust. She knew this feeling and her <br />
smile evaporated in an instant. <br />
<br />
'Imps, pst, I guess in their way they're the opposite of Vicki and her sisters.... they were <br />
mortal souls transmuted into Messengers aligned with Allah. Imps, these vermin were fae <br />
who signed a contract with the rebels and transmuted into Messengered aligned with <br />
Iblis.' Jasmine blood boiled at the mere mention of these revolting creatures. 'They do <br />
nothing but disrupt order, or twist order backwards upon itself twisting fate's cloth until <br />
it's nothing but knots... Good this imp ran into me before it could cause any more trouble.' <br />
Allah had created mortals to forgive each other and themselves... Allah had created <br />
Jasmine as the Angel of the Jihad, whose true translation was not holy war but 'The <br />
Struggle' the struggle to be a good member of the faith.  And that struggle... was hard <br />
enough without loathsome -cheaters- ripping up the rule book! <br />
<br />
Normally Jasmine wouldn't even waist her time on such filth. While a formable warrior to <br />
say the least, Jasmine knew she made a better commander than a shock trooper. However <br />
this scum had made the mistake of desecrating with her very presence of one of the tinny, <br />
tiny insignificant pin point of the universe on this relatively extra-ordinary life producing <br />
orb Jasmine had been momentarily assigned to aid with the reconciliation of the devoted <br />
of Allah and their religious siblings after the naturally occurring little cracks between the <br />
devoted had widened into canyons after the divine had begrudging conceded to cloak itself <br />
from the world when the kingdom of illusions had first been constructed. <br />
<br />
AND... now that the kingdom of illusions was destroyed... she had no reason to simply let <br />
things be as the imp reek havoc to it's own amusement and occasionally the will of it's <br />
masters for the sake of people holding onto their precious ignorance... <br />
<br />
From the mountain peak Jasmine was standing on her true form, she slip into her shell and <br />
took with her the new toy she had been granted as a reward for her part in Operation <br />
Return (as round about backhand as it was...). In under a minute she was zooming through <br />
the air faster than a jet but with a lot less chance of causing secondary damage from a <br />
second boom. <br />
<br />
She spotted the imp with her true senses and her body's eyes. Small fae size, pointed ears, <br />
tinny aerodynamically worthless wings, a squash between a childish body and an adult <br />
face was the shape the imp has chosen to manifest as. <br />
<br />
Jasmine was not super specialized for war, and thus had a more diverse set of abilities... <br />
and she saw it... the threads of fate that had been out and now floated useless... She saw <br />
the statue of a woman holding her child. She also sensed the souls inside the statues, <br />
thinking themselves always having been carved from stone. <br />
<br />
She did a quick look through the two threads... picking out the thoughts along where they <br />
had been pulled out,<br />
<br />
'Mom and dad are getting a divorce... hello, who are you? You're an imp? What that? You <br />
want to grant me a wish? Okay, I wish me and mom could stay together forever.... '  And <br />
now the husband was now a lonely bachelor.  And the imp was laughing off it off. <br />
<br />
Someone else would have assumed the imp could approach the girl openly due to project <br />
return... this was false, the imp would have approached the girl weather or not return had <br />
occurred. Jasmine wondered if an outside observer would have considered such <br />
happenstance to be a one sided argument in defense of return devoid of a meaningful <br />
voice from the opposing point of view. And Jasmine knew she didn't care. Someone else <br />
might have announced themselves to the imp, someone else might have let themselves be <br />
the new item of attention to the imp letting the time it was distracted slip by.... Jasmine <br />
was none of these. <br />
<br />
She drew her weapon more silent than falling snow, this was Her Own weapon, she didn't <br />
need to worry about the imp somehow turning it on her.  <br />
<br />
Jasmine faster than any true flesh and blood could hope to move and impaled the damn <br />
imp!   The stabbing weapon went in one one side and out the other in the same second, <br />
the blade shimmering different glowing shades of white, emitting a slight ring.  The imp <br />
found herself one of her heart chambers pierced and the weapon's own blade having <br />
burned away the entrance and exit wounds bleeding.  She didn't move a muscle. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now,&quot; Jasmine leaned in and whispered in the imp's ear, &quot;Listen very carefully, this sword <br />
was forged in the Lake Of Fire, the final oblivion reserved for the rebel angels after the <br />
universe has run it's course. That means, if you so much as sneeze, this blast cut your <br />
heart and spirit in two, and you'll be obliterated, deader than dead, you try to teleport or <br />
invoke any curse or reality warp... this blade will react to it, and the result will be exactly <br />
the same... Do you understand what I just said?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes....&quot; The imp whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is your name? Your original one. Lie and this blade will do it's job.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Imaus...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll remember that name forever... any of your 'creative implementations' and I WILL find <br />
you, there won't be a plane of existence obscure enough or a level of Jahannum low <br />
enough for you to hide in... and I promise to make final nothingness the LEAST of your <br />
worries...and you know how we angels are about our promises...fate will not allow you to <br />
end yourself somehow before I find you... Do you understand?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.... yes I do...&quot; The imp said deathly afraid. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Now listen very closely imp.&quot; Jasmine then spoke in the language of the <br />
Messengers, for which there is no room for misinterpretation, if translated into crude, <br />
limited english, it would come across roughly as, 'undo every reality warp and curse and <br />
double sided contract you have done and do no more... or else.' <br />
<br />
&quot;But... but you said if I did a reality warp with this blade inside...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When I remove it.. a tiny fragment of it is going to break off... it'll return to my weapon <br />
once our agreement is reached... try to teleport away, any of your games, or turn on me, <br />
you know what doesn't await you. So, do you wish to cease to exist... or do we have an <br />
agreement?&quot;<br />
<br />
 Imps were like the natural majority of manipulative sadistic bullies... their cowardice <br />
always shone through when the tables were turned. <br />
<br />
&quot;We have an agreement?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's that?&quot; Jasmine said calmly. <br />
<br />
&quot;A CONTRACT! We have a contract! There I said it!&quot; The imp said almost crying from the <br />
humiliation. A demon (even a tiny recruited one) being forced to make a deal with a <br />
Angel... it was -almost- enough to make Imaus desire the Lake of Fire blade did the job <br />
right now... <br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; Jasmine in a flash pulled the blade out of the imp's back side none too gently. <br />
<br />
A look of clashing fear and hatred in her eyes, Imaus snapped both her fingers... the <br />
human population increased by the hundreds as statues, paper weights, pizza ovens, <br />
paintings, figurines, dolls, mannequins, fountains, and clothes around the globe <br />
spontaneously became human beings again, retroactively having their lives restored to <br />
them as well... of course, those who had been who had been buried or lost at sea or <br />
dismantled or melted down were teleported to the nearest safe place upon their <br />
restoration. This had the retroactive effect for some of having not aged since their <br />
imprisonment while others died of old age having lived their life long ago. The difference <br />
depended on how long the imprisonment had been and if that person had been in a <br />
position to resume their life or were simply retroactive placed back properly into their <br />
place in the time stream. <br />
<br />
&quot;There! DONE! Happy!?&quot; Imaus snarled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good, now go back to Jahannum!&quot; In one swift motion switch to her other sword she cut <br />
the imp's head off which went flying but Jasmine caught it as the imp's lifeless lower body <br />
hit the ground and stank of sulfur even as the child and her mother watched in awe, the <br />
girl's duel set of memories telling her had transpired. Jasmine regretted that a child had to <br />
see it and would have done it different if she could have it over (but that was against one <br />
of creations most basic rules). The rest of the imp's body vaporized as Jasmine held Imaus' <br />
head.   &quot;Tell this to your superiors, inferiors, and fellows Imaus The Imp. Your fun and <br />
games are OVER! Understand? You are NOT building up the kingdom of illusions again just <br />
to make this planet back into your personal playground. You no longer have the loopholes <br />
and the technicalities of the kingdom of illusion of hide behind! No Angel has the slightest <br />
obligation to tolerate your presence... now back to where you belong!&quot; Jasmine incinerated <br />
the head in white head in a flash. Imaus, with no shell to inhabit for the moment, had <br />
nothing to anchor her to this plane of reality, and was pulled into what was now her native <br />
plane.<br />
<br />
Jasmine breathed in deep and then out slowly. 'That felt better than it should have.' <br />
<br />
The high ranking angel took one look at the child and mother and knelt down to the <br />
child's eye level after taking a quick look at the threads again. <br />
<br />
She whispered in the girl's eear. 'Your father has been seen what life would be like without <br />
you or your mother... he no longer wants to be without either of you... don't worry child... <br />
your parents will remain together.'<br />
<br />
The girl surprised Jasmine somewhat with a hug when the angel accepted before bowing <br />
to the two humans and teleporting away.<br />
<br />
'Heh. Kyriel... Your parent wanted a world where truth was not hidden by illusions so all <br />
could make choices based on truth... This makes this your world too I suppose <br />
somewhat.... heh. This is the new world, nay, the true world with the mask removed that <br />
Allah too it seems desires.... so I shall protect it as well.' With that Jasmine returned to her <br />
task that was both her purpose and meaning, and that was enough. 'Vicki. Erica. Luna. <br />
Lisa. Kyriel. May Allah be with you all.'</p>
