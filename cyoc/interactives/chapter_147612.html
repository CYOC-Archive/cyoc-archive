<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alan watched through the window as his dad and Megan drove away. While doing so, he accidentally caught a glimpse of his own reflection. At first, he didn&#39;t even recognize it. He thought he saw soon girl outside. Then he realized what he saw and he just sat down on the couch, feeling worse than ever. Janet noticed and walked over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh honey, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; She asked concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think Mom!?&quot; Alan yelled. &quot;Look at me!&quot; He said as he grabbed his breasts. &quot;I&#39;m a fucking girl! I lost my dick, and all my clothes are basically dresses!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Janet yelled back. &quot;Watch your language! I know what you&#39;re going through, trust me, I do, but we&#39;re all going through the same thing Alan. How do you think you little sister feels with growing a penis?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
Alan just sat back annoyed but unable to come up with a counter point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look,&quot; Janet  continued. &quot;It&#39;s gonna be alright. We just can&#39;t think about this right now. We have a job to do. If we are going to change back, then we have to figure out what this thing does and how it works... okay?&quot; She asked softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Alan regretfully agreed. He swished his hair back and strutted away towards his laptop. Janet nearly laughed out loud as he did so, as Janet was surprised at how girly he was acting. Of course, saying that would just enrage him, but Alan was acting very much like Janet did when she was that age.<br />
<br />
The two got to work scrolling through the web, looking up anything that could be related to the book. Janet was looking up ancient symbols, trying to match it to the book, while Alan was trying to find anything magic related that didn&#39;t involve cards or a rabbit coming out of a hat. <br />
<br />
Finally, after about an hour of searching, Alan found something that peaked his interest.<br />
&quot;Mom?&quot; He asked. &quot;There isn&#39;t a magic shop in town right?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, why do you ask?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was searching through magic related stores, trying to find anything that wasn&#39;t phony, but I found something weird.&quot; He explained as Janet came up to see. &quot;When I started searching, the closest shop was a few hours away. After all this searching, however, I exited out of my other tabs and suddenly google maps says there&#39;s a magic shop in town.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Janet said confused, staring at the map. &quot;But... there&#39;s never been that kind of shop in town. Where it says there is one on the map is supposed to be a space between shops.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.&quot; Alan agreed. &quot;So I&#39;m thinking that this might have something to do with that.&quot; He explained as he gestured towards the book.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you&#39;re on to something sweetie.&quot; She agreed. &quot;Grab the book, let&#39;s get in my car and pay a visit to this mysterious shop.&quot;<br />
<br />
They hoped in the car with the book held tight on Alan&#39;s lap as the two drove into town. They parked a block away and walked with determination to where google maps had directed them. Along the way, Alan and Janet were quickly reminded of reality&#39;s change as they ran into &quot;Alana&#39;s&quot; friend Tif. <br />
<br />
&quot;O.M.G. Hi Alana!&quot; Tif squealed as she gave Alan a hug. <br />
<br />
Alan was thrown off guard as Tif was a girl from school who barely talked to him, if ever, but apparently they were friends now.<br />
&quot;Oh, uh, hiya?&quot; Alan awkwardly responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Hi Mr. McCoy.&quot; Tif said with a bit of attraction in her voice, with threw Janet for a loop. &quot;What are you two doing here?&quot; She asked happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I uh, was just, like, helping my m-DAD, return this book.&quot; Alan awkwardly explained, trying his best to sound like a teenaged girl. &quot;Uh, shouldn&#39;t you be in school?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lol, I could say the same to you Alana.&quot; She laughed. &quot;Well, good luck with that boring book thingie! I got shopping to do!&quot; She yelled as she kept strutting down the street.<br />
<br />
&quot;As much as I would have loved to have another daughter, judging by the friends you would have had, I am VERY glad that you were a boy.&quot; Janet half joked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah no kidding.&quot; Alan replied. &quot;She has less brain cells than I thought.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two continued walking for another minute before they found the shop. It looked as if it had always been there. The walls were connected to the other shop, there was a little moss growing between it and the other shops, and even the color of the building matched. The sign simply read &quot;The Magic Shop&quot; and both Janet and Alan were sure no shop like this had ever existed here.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, this might have been another reality alteration that happened when we changed, so play it cool for now.&quot; Janet commanded. Alan nodded and the two walked in. It was a strangely CVS looking stores, except with each aisle being filled with random nonsense. There were remotes, rings, and the nicknacks that actually looked like they belonged in a magic shop. The old man behind the counter, dressed in a stereotypical wizards robe, turned to them with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, hello Alana. Hello Jake. Welcome to the magic shop!&quot; He greeted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello!&quot; Janet cheerfully greeted. &quot;Sorry to bother you again but we found this book and thought maybe you&#39;d know something about it?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry again?&quot; He asked confused. &quot;Aren&#39;t you two... wondering how I knew your names.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait.&quot; Alan said confused. &quot;So you didn&#39;t change with reality?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Reality changing.... Oh dear oh my you&#39;ve run into a more powerful object than I thought.&quot; He replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait what?&quot; Janet interrupted confused. &quot;Do you or do you not know us?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m terribly sorry, allow me to explain.&quot; He began. &quot;I am the owner of the magic shop. This shop magically transports around the world. It usually appears exactly where people need it to appear, and then I provide people with magical items. I know the names of all who enter the shop, a little backstory about them, and a little info on what they are going through. Sadly, as you walked through that door, I fear I may have learned the wrong information.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Alan asked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well my dear lass, it told me you were a 15 year old girl on the cheer team.&quot; He started before Alan frowned. &quot;But since you mentioned reality changing, I likely only know things about you from this new reality, not the old one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s why we&#39;re here.&quot; Janet explained. &quot;We want to change us back to normal and fix reality.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I assume the book is involved?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
Alan handed him the book. He only held it for a second before he placed it on the counter and stepped back.<br />
&quot;My God.&quot; He proclaimed. &quot;This is powerful magic. I haven&#39;t seen something like this in eons.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Can you undo it?&quot; Alan asked hopeful.<br />
<br />
The man turned to them both....</p>
