<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Susan and Tim stood looking at each other standing in the changing room of one of the furry convention clothing. Susan stretched out her now fur covered hand and ran down her boyfriend’s now more muscular and fur covered chest. That earned her a purr from him before his hand shot out and wrapped around the small of her back and dipped her down as he kissed first her lips and then moving down her neck earning purrs and moans from her. One of her hands rested on his back by the shoulder blades to help keep her up while the other went down and brushed Tim’s now Snow Leopard manhood which was back at full attention. <br />
<br />
They were about to get it on, not caring if anyone heard them when both stopped as their ears twitched. They could hear footsteps coming toward them before knocking on the door to the changing room.<br />
<br />
“Listen, I know what you two are doing so get dressed and pay for anything you brought in there and we can just go about our day.” Said a male voice on the other side of the door. “If you don’t, I will have to call security and bane you.”<br />
<br />
Both Susan and Tim shared a look with each other, before nodding their heads and moving toward positions. They could hear the man on the other side of the door waiting for them to come out.<br />
<br />
“Give us a moment.” Said Susan, her voice was slightly different but unless someone knew her beforehand, they wouldn’t have noticed. Then she reached for the handle of the door and pulled it in, opening the door. At the same time, Tim’s arms shot out grabbing the man. He had to be in his mid-to-late 20’s and before he knew it Tim’s fangs sank deep into his throat. <br />
<br />
The man tried to scream but couldn’t as Tim’s now much stronger jaws crush his air, however something told Tim not to finish the man. He kept the man from breathing as the man’s fist pounded against Tim as Susan closed the door and pinned him down as well. Sinking her own fangs into a spot between the neck and the shoulder blade. Right as the man was about to pass out, Tim released him causing Susan to look at him, slightly confused.<br />
<br />
“We need more of us.” Said Tim as Susan noticed the wound on the man was healing at an impossible rate as of all things scales began to appear on his body. The man had been infected by a large amount of the virus and was in the process of changing. A massive growth was already growing off the man’s back becoming hard shell of some kind as the man’s face began to turn into what looked to be a snapping turtle.<br />
<br />
“I get it.” said Susan as she focused on what was happening outside, she couldn’t hear anything out of the ordinary, but she heard movement a few feet away. Judging by the sound there was a single person in one of the changing rooms only a few feet away from them. <br />
Susan sulked down the lines of clothing, bending over a bit to better hide her new taller form. She reached the door and heard someone humming from the other side of the door. She extended a claw and put it between the gap between the frame and the door. These changing rooms had been set up on a temporary base, so the gap was large between the door and frame. The simple lock was easily pop as Susan opened the door.<br />
<br />
It was a woman; Susan knew that because she could smell the perfume before she opened the door. She was a rather large women and was easily in her mid-40s but was dressed like she was in her 20’s. Her eyes widened as Susan leaped on his unknown women. Even though the women were much larger then Susan, she pinned her down with ease and following Tim’s example she bite down on the women’s massive neck and choked her nearly to death. Susan released her bite, the women’s blood dripping off her fangs even as the women’s wounds began to heal even as the women’s face began to push out into what looked to be a type of horse furry however a pair of thick horns also began to grow out of the women’s brown hair.  <br />
<br />
Susan sniffed the air; she could smell things she couldn’t before. She could smell that only a few rows of clothing away from her Tim had taken down two more people. From behind her she could hear the man whom they had first taken down getting up. She could hear soft moaning from him and the sound of ripping clothes, he was transforming just like the two of them had. <br />
<br />
The store was mostly empty because it was near lunch time so most of the people were down at the massive dining hall or at one of the nearby restaurants by the convention center. <br />
<br />
“Let’s head across to the next store.” Said Tim as he appeared beside her, Susan eyes widened, there was no cover between where they where and the next booth selling stuff. Then to her amazement Tim just got up and walked out into the open and headed toward the shop.<br />
<br />
“Great costume.” yelled someone as Tim gave a wave before walking into the store and jumping on the man behind the register. Following his lead, Susan followed suit. Everyone who did see her just assumed she was in an outfit and not that this was her flesh now. <br />
<br />
She and Tim split with her headed along the other side of the store by the changing booths, just like they had before. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow.&quot; said a girl about her age coming out of a changing area. She came out in what looked to be normal street cloth with only a fox tail hanging on her belt. &quot;Where did you get that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want one?&quot; inquired Susan with a playful grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; confirmed the girl as Susan smiled<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let me give you it.&quot; stated Susan as she pinned this women to the wall and bite down on her neck cutting off a scream as Susan infected her. She was still holding this women in place as Tim came up behind her.<br />
<br />
“What now?” inquired Tim as he licked his hand clean of blood like a cat would do even as both of them crouched in the booth as people began to change around them. <br />
<br />
So far, they hadn’t been discovered yet but the more people they changed the more they risked being discovered.</p>
