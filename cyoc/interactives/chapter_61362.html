<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>Shawn was glad that his plan had worked so well, in fact, he honestly never thought that would ever create another of his kind. He had 
tried biting humans before, but all that had happened was that the bitten had turned into feral and savage beasts, much like normal wolves, 
just being bigger from having the original human size. He even tried to bite humans at different times, both during a normal night and a full 
moon... but it turned out that it didn't matter. For a long time, Shawn had given up the hunt and began the approach he took with Kris. He had 
this store open for a couple years now, hoping and waiting for someone to take the idea of being a werewolf to the next level, like Kris had. 
Shawn knew that Kris was his best shot and as we all well know... Kris drank the vial. All that was left was to wait and see what happens 
now.</br>
<br>"Ach! Laddie, lemme go an' get a chair fer yoo so ya don' hurt ya self. I don' be wantin' any lawsuits oer nothin'." Shawn said, 
chuckling.</br>
<br>"Man... thanks Shawn... I just don't get it..." Kris said, pausing mid sentence.</br>
<br>"Somethin' wrong wit yoo lad?" Shawn asked, with a concerned tone in his voice.</br>
<br>"I... I'm not sure. I feel funny, like my whole body is tingly all of a sudden. Man... I..." Kris said, pausing mid sentence again, startled by his 
own voice... sounding like it got deeper the more Kris talked.</br>
<br>"I think tha' potion worked! I can see some changes with yoo alreadae!" Shawn said with excitement, excited to see how well his first 
werewolf potion worked.</br>
<br>"Really!?" Kris asked with excitement, "How long do you think it will take before anything begins happening?"</br>
<br>"Well laddie, yoor voice alreadae got deepah an' ya got a nice, thick stooble on yer face where ya were smooth jus moments agu. Soo I 
hav'ta think it will be soon! It's definitely workin on ya." Shawn said, letting his teeth lengthen to fangs to the point where they broke the seal 
of his lips.</br>
<br>Either not noticing or not caring about the oddity of Shawn's teeth, Kris smiled at Shawn. "Man... this is going to be so cool! I'm going to 
be a werewolf!" Kris said as he rubbed the thick coating of stubble on his face.</br>
<br>Suddenly, Kris shuddered as he felt something wash over him. When the feeling passed, Kris looked at Shawn differently than he had up 
till now. Kris felt a strong pull towards Shawn, like he needed to be closer to him for some reason. Wanting to fulfill that need, that desire, Kris 
approached Shawn as his fingernails darkened, turning black. As Kris stood next to Shawn, so much that their hands made contact with one 
another, Shawn wanted to see just how much had changed.</br>
<br>"Aye laddie! Whatcha' be doin' there?" Shawn asked with confusion in his voice, even though he knew exactly what was happening.</br>
<br>"Hmmm... I just felt that I needed to get closer to you..." Kris said pausing, feeling another odd wave of emotions wash over him.</br>
<br>"Ach... is that so laddie..." Shawn said, pausing for a moment and quickly wrapped his densely haired and quite buff arm around Kris's 
midsection, bracing him like a brother. "How ya be feelin now?" Shawn asked with a big grin on his face with his fangs showing.</br>
<br>Kris looked at Shawn, smiled and showed off his own slightly pointed teeth. From what Shawn saw, things were coming along quite nicely 
for Kris, seeing that his fangs not only came in on his top and bottom teeth, but they developed into full fangs like Shawn's in the moments 
that they were looking at one another.</br>
<br>"I feel really good about it actually! I feel warm, cared for, strong and secure! I'm not exactly sure why that is, but that's truthfully how I 
feel being next to you!" Kris said in his new deeper and manly voice.</br>
<br>Shawn smiled, happy to finally have his beta after having been a lone wolf for all those many, many years. As Shawn looked at his beta, he 
could see other physical attributes changing. Kris's muscles went from being nearly non-existent on his pretty average body to that of a 
seasoned athlete; the hair on Kris's body where his skin was exposed grew to be much fuller, thicker and more dense giving Kris a definitely 
manly and more rugged look. Curious to know how Kris would react to the new him, Shawn quickly formed a plan in his head.</br>
<br>"Hey laddie, looks like tha' potion is workin on ya! Care ta take a look?" Shawn asked smiling.</br>
<br>"Really!? Yeah, I wanna see... I wonder how much more is different!" Kris said, more excited than he had ever been!</br>
<br>Side by side, with Kris still wrapped in Shawn's manly arm, they walked over to the nearby full body mirror so that Kris could see the 
newer him. As Kris saw his reflection, he barely recognized himself. HIs heart soared, just for that moment, happy with the results thus 
far.</br>
<br>"Hey Shawn..." Kris started, a tone of concern in his voice, "... am I going to be the way I look now when the potion wears off and I turn 
back into my human self?"</br>
<br>"Ta be honest with ya Kris, I dun'na know. Maybe ya will look like tha' way ya doo now. Maybe you will jus' be more muscled or jus' maybe 
ya will go back to tha old yoo. I canna say since ya are tha firs ta get this gift like I tol ya earlaer!" Shawn answered honestly, wondering what 
would happen himself.</br>
<br>"Oh... ok..." Kris replied, not knowing what else to say since there wasn't much that he could even do. </br>
<br>As they stood there, while they both watched Kris's slow transformation, they did so with apt intent. Suddenly another wave came over 
Kris, eliciting a little bit of a moan of pleasure. It was very intense and erotic. Kris could see his reflection and that he was growing more 
muscle, stretching his clothes and making them outline Kris's growing muscles.</br>
<br>"Laddie! Looks like ya may wan'ta take off yer clothes so ya have somethin ta wear when ya turn back!" Shawn said matter-of-
factly.</br>
<br>"Yeah... you are probably right!" Kris said as he started to undress, finding it difficult since the fabric was pretty much at its tearing point, 
being plastered against his skin, but he was able to manage.</br>
<br>With the majority of his clothes off, now wearing only his skin tight boxer brieds under his straining jean shorts, both Kris and Shawn 
looked at the adonis Kris had become. From his average, little muscled body, Kris stood in amazement to see his twenty four inch arms; his 
sixty inch, pillow-like pectorals that were dusted in dense, but trimmed medium brown chest hair; his thick neck muscles; his flat, hairy and 
trimmed abs; his tree trunk thick thigh muscles that were nicely coated with hair, as well as his equally muscled and hairy calves. Approving 
very much of the new Kris, Shawn patted Kris on his nicely muscled back.</br>
<br>"Well laddie, ya are a very impressive specimen!" Shawn exclaimed while smiling his fanged smile, while Kris returned the smile, fangs and 
all.</br>
<br>"Yeah... looks like I'm slightly under your size!" Kris said with a wink.</br>
<br>"Aye laddie, that ya are... that ya are!" Shawn said as he rubbed Kris's head hair in a playful notion, taking note that Kris's ears now came 
to a point like that of their ilk. Shawn then continued, "Well, looks like ya are needin ta be makin a decision here. Ya can leave yoor clothes on 
an' hope for the bes', ya can go ta tha dressin' room and take off yer clothes there to save'em oer ya can jus drop trau here... that is if ya 
aren't bashful oer anythin'!"</br>
<br>Kris looked at Shawn in the mirror smiling, paused for a second to think and said, "I think I'll..."</br></p>
