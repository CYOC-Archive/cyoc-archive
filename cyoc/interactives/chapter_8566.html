<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty’s Power- Dustin’s Body Swap Sunday – by scriptboy<br />
<br />
It was a Sunday afternoon and Ashley had come over to visit with Ty and Peter. Ashley was the tall, shy kid who had recently become good friends with Peter, and he came over just to surf the Internet using Peter’s laptop. He rang the doorbell and Ty opened up. “Hey Ty, what’s up?” he said. “Hey Ashley, come on in!” Ty responded, as Ashley slowly walked into the hallway. “Is your cousin, the mighty wizard, in the house?” Ashley asked with a grin on his face. “Oh yeah, Peter’s home. Just go into our bedroom, he’s sitting behind the laptop now, hacking away at it!” Ty responded, knowing perfectly clear who he was referring to.<br />
<br />
“Well, you guys have fun; I’m going to shoot some pool. See you guys later!” Ty said as he walked out the door. Ashley ran up the stairs and quietly walked into the bedroom where he saw Peter, typing some text in a chat window on his laptop. “Hey, quit writing more computer viruses okay?” Ashley said, as he walked into the room. Peter just grinned when he walked in. “You don’t mind me using your laptop, do you? Since I don’t have Internet at home…”<br />
<br />
“Can’t your parents get you a new computer? They’re so inexpensive now!” Peter said, as he got up from the chair, making room for Ashley. “Well, my mom is not doing too well, and my father hasn’t been sending his child support payments, so you know how that goes…” Ashley responded, as he sat down while Peter crawled on his bed, laying on his stomach, and facing Ashley. <br />
<br />
Ashley worked on the computer for awhile, as Peter actually dozed off and fell asleep. When he was done, he got up from the chair, and Peter woke up because of the sound of Ashley moving the chair. “Wouldn’t you like to have your own computer with Internet? Then we could chat online…” Peter wondered out loud. “Of course, but where am I going to get the money?” Ashley responded. <br />
<br />
“How about we buy a lottery ticket tonight?” Peter said. “No, that takes too long. I would love to get a computer as soon as possible. Could you win it in a casino?” Ashley asked. “Yeah, but I’m not old enough to go in, and neither are you!” Peter responded. “But you can change that, if needed! Can’t you make me older, using your powers?” Ashley wondered, as he gave Peter a wink. He knew about Peter’s powers from school.<br />
<br />
“Yeah… I know! Dustin can get in anyway! He is old enough, and he can drive!” Peter said, as he snapped his fingers. He concentrated on Dustin, as he got off his bed, and Dustin walked into the room. “Hey Dustin, I need to you to go to the casino and win a few thousand dollars so Ashley can buy a computer with Internet!” Dustin looked at Peter with a grin and responded “Yes, but who says I’m going to win anything in the casino?”<br />
<br />
“I’ll go to the casino, but I need to swap bodies with you because you’re older!” Peter said out loud, as he grabbed Dustin’s hands and concentrated. Within seconds, Peter was now inside Dustin’s body, while Dustin was now Peter. But Peter also transferred his powers to go with him, for he can’t make his own powers disappear from his own soul. <br />
<br />
“Alright Ashley, let’s go get you some money!” Dustin said excitedly, while Peter looked at himself in confusion. “Hey, what about me?” Peter protested, since Dustin was now in the body of the 15 year-old, but without his powers! “Take a nap, big guy!” Dustin said, as Peter started to become drowsy and dozed off on his bed. “This is so weird! So, Peter, you are using Dustin’s body now?” he asked Dustin. “Yeah, I swapped my body with Dustin’s, so now I’m old enough to drive! Let’s go!”<br />
<br />
Ashley followed Dustin down the stairs and out the door, leaving the real Dustin inside of Peter’s body, sound asleep in the bedroom. Ashley and Dustin got in Dustin’s little Beetle, and he cranked the engine and drove off to the casino. <br />
<br />
Since Ashley was too young to go in, Dustin concentrated on him, making the teen grow until he looked like he was 18 years old. The 6 foot teen suddenly grew to 6’4” inches, and he became a little more muscular. Dustin parked the car and the older version of Ashley walked behind him towards the entrance of the casino, fully enjoying his Sunday afternoon with his powerful buddy.<br />
<br />
Dustin played poker and used his powers to control the dice and to see all the cards that the other players had, making several easy wins in a row! Then he played the slot machine, and he won several hundred dollars in quarters. In the end, Dustin and Ashley walked out of the casino with over $1,500 in cash!<br />
<br />
After Ashley and Dustin got back to Dustin’s house, they went straight up to the bedroom to wake up Peter. “Alright Dustin, you can have your body back now” Dustin said, as he grabbed Peter’s hands, while Peter was still lying on the bed. Dustin closed his eyes and concentrated, three seconds later he opened his eyes again and asked “What happened?” Peter was on his bed, and laughed. <br />
<br />
“You just won $1,500 for Ashley in the casino, Dustin! You were there, but you didn’t know it for we swapped bodies!” Peter said, looking at Ashley, who still looked like an 18 year-old. “Oops, I had better change you back!” Peter said, and immediately Ashley began to shrink back to his old self, at only 6 feet tall, now looking like a 15 year-old teenager again.<br />
<br />
“I can buy my computer now! This is awesome!” Ashley said out loud, while holding the money in his hand. “I hope you didn’t get me into any trouble, Peter!” Dustin warned Peter, who just smiled back. “Don’t worry; Ashley was with you the whole time! You played poker and you won! Nobody knew that it was me, in your body!”<br />
<br />
Ashley went home, carrying the money in his wallet. Monday afternoon, after Peter had gotten home from school, he received his first email from Ashley! Ashley had bought his new laptop, and he had his Internet hooked up. And Peter was pleased to be there for his friend. He loved using his power to help his friends, and this had been one body swap that was worthwhile to him!</p>
