<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Felicia and Adam gazed at their adult appearance, still stunned that they had gone from 15 to 45 in only moments. Adam ran his hand along his five o’clock shadow taken aback at the amount of facial hair he now possessed. “Damn I think I need to shave.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know,” Felicia smirked. “I kind of like it.” Adam turned towards his girlfriend, a small smile on his face. “You look great,” he smiled. Felicia could only blush, shyly turning her eyes away from her boyfriend.<br />
<br />
“Hey focus,” Ann exclaimed. “We should probably talk before we go to see Jackies parents. Probably not a good idea that you don’t know anything about your so called daughter.” Adam and Felicia apologized as they now made their way towards the living room. An awkward silence now descended on the three of them as they searched for words. “So,” Adam said quietly. “Did you, um, play any sports as a kid?”<br />
<br />
“No,” Ann frowned. “I was never an athlete, that was Lisa. I was more artistic as a kid. A painter actually.”<br />
<br />
“Oh wow,” Felicia said. “We’re going to have to check those out sometime. What kind of pictures did you paint?”<br />
<br />
“Umm they were kinda dark,” Ann said sheepishly. “I wasn’t the most confident kid in the world. Kind of went through a dark period and it showed in my paintings.” Felicia and Adam nodded, unsure what to ask Ann as a follow up. “Sorry you had it tough,” Adam said quietly. “I mean, you seem cool. If I had been...um...your dad. I would of looked out for you.” Felicia smiled sweetly ast her boyfriend as Ann blushed.<br />
<br />
“I appreciate that Adam,” Ann smiled. “To be honest my dad was very supportive growing up. He wanted me to be me, no matter what. My older sister Kellie also tried to instill confidence in me as a kid, I just never listened.”<br />
<br />
“Why is that,” Felicia asked.<br />
<br />
“Thought I knew better,” Ann shrugged. “When your growing up you never think your parents knew what it was like to be young. It doesn’t hit you til later that they have experience in these things. Probably would of saved a lot of fights I had with my mom.”<br />
<br />
“You and your mom didn’t get along,” Felicia said nervously.<br />
<br />
“Not really,” Ann mumbled. “To be honest, I was scared of her. Mom was this over the top personality, like Lisa. She didn’t put up with any crap. Unlike my sisters though I kept quiet. Lisa and Kellie stood up for themselves, I just stayed quiet. Kept things bottled in, kind of why I went with the whole goth look. I couldn’t rebel against my parents with words because I was so shy. I decided to rebel by dressing like this.”<br />
<br />
“So,” Felicia said. “When we meet with Jackie’s parents is that what you want to show? A quiet goth girl that quietly rebels against her parents?”<br />
<br />
Ann thought for a moment. No, she didn’t want that. She had spent her entire childhood being the quiet, odd sister in her family. Now that she and Jackie were a couple she found herself more confident than before. Ann’s goth look wasn’t a rebellious thing anymore. It was simply her fashion. She was happy, confident, more full of life than she had ever been in her whole life. If she could shape how her family life would turn out than why not have it so that she came from a happy family that supported their daughter no matter how they appeared.<br />
<br />
“No I don’t want to be the rebel,” Ann said. “Look, I don’t know how you feel about goths but I want us to be able to get along. Right now, I’m happy. I’m happier than I’ve been in my whole life. This...this is just something I like to dress in.”<br />
<br />
“I can deal with that,” Felicia said. “Hw about you Adam?”<br />
<br />
“Well if were being honest I never understood the whole goth look,” he stated. “I mean it’s kinda freaky.” Felicia shot her boyfriend a disapproving look. “Hey I’m just being honest,” Adam said defensively. “You wanted my honest opinion I’m giving it but that doesn’t mean I’m going to disown my kid or anything.”<br />
<br />
“You know Adam,” Ann smiled. “I think I can deal with that. You sound like you would be a pretty good dad.”<br />
<br />
Adam blushed, thanking Ann as she now stood to look at the two teens impersonating her parents.”Well mom and dad,” Ann said. “We should probably get going. Just be honest with Jackie’s parents, talk a little bit about me, and make it seem like we come from a good family.”<br />
<br />
“Definitely can do that Ann,” Felicia said warmly. “From what I’ve seen your a good person and you and Jackie seem to make each other better. Definitely support you too being a couple.”<br />
<br />
“And I promise I won’t say anything embarrassing,” Adam said with a smirk. “Can’t ruin my little girls night.”<br />
<br />
Ann laughed in spite of herself as she grabbed her car keys. “I think we might actually pull this off,” she said. “Cmon Jackie lets go meet your parents.” As Ann turned to walk out the door, she felt Jackie grab her arm. “Darling what are you doing?<br />
<br />
“Driving angel,” Ann replied, slightly confused. Jackie shook her head, taking a deep breath as she looked at her girlfriend. “Your only 15 right now remember,” she sighed. “How is that going to look if you drive your parents to my house? It could bow our cover.”<br />
<br />
“But they can’t drive,” Ann exclaimed. “None of you can. I’m the only one that actually has a license.”<br />
<br />
Jackie rubbed her neck as she sheepishly looked at her girlfriend. “Yeah I know,”she said. “But we have to be careful. I want to try something but I have to run it by you first. Your going to have to trust me though Okay?”<br />
<br />
“Why do I get the feeling I’m not going to like this,” Ann groaned.<br />
<br />
Jackie blushed as she looked down at her Ring of Age. While she had never tried what she was about to do, something told her that it was possible. Before she did it though she wanted to let Ann in on her plans. “Okay Angel,” she said quietly. “What I want to do is give your driving knowledge to Felicia and Adam. I think I can take your adult experience to them but, it means you wouldn’t know how to drive anymore, like any other 15 year old.”<br />
<br />
“You can do that,” Ann exclaimed. Jackie nodded, causing Ann to groan. She already felt like a teenager, did she really want to feel like more of a kid by giving away more of her adulthood? Groaning sheslumped her shoulders as she turned towards her girlfriend. “Okay fine,” she moaned. “But this better not be permanent Jackie.”<br />
<br />
“It won’t Ann I promise,” Jackie smiled. “Now hold still.”<br />
<br />
Ann watched as Jackie’s Ring of Age began to glow. As it did Ann held her breath, glancing at her hands. At first nothing happened, which relieved her greatly. After a few seconds though Ann began to feel weird. Ann swooned slightly as she braved herself against the wall with her hand, Ann’s mind felt odd as the magic began to work its magic. The grown down adult could feel knowledge slowly disappearing from her mind, fading away like smoke. Ann tried to hold on to her driving knowledge as she felt it disappear. Slowly but surely Ann began to forget how to drive. At first it was complicated things she had learned over the years, like changing a tire or basic engine repair. That knowledge vanished, leaving Ann  without the faintest idea of how to perform those tasks. Soon though the knowledge that vanished became simpler. Ann forgot how to maintain speeds, make turns, even turn on the car. In only seconds Ann felt all her driving experience disappear.<br />
<br />
“You okay Ann,” Jackie asked as Ann rubbed her eyes. <br />
<br />
Ann blinked as she looked first to Jackie and then Adam and Felicia. “Um I’m okay,” she said shyly. “I mean I can remember that I’m an adult. I’ve just forgotten how to drive.<br />
<br />
“Yeah now we know how,” Felicia said as she rubbed her eyes. “Geez that felt weird. How are you doing Adam?”<br />
<br />
“Ugh I need a Tylenol,” he groaned as he rubbed his temples. “But now I know how to drive to Jackie’s.”<br />
<br />
“That’s good cause, um, I forgot.” Jackie smiled, leaning into Ann giving her a gentle kiss on the cheek. “You’ll be fine Angel I promise.” As the four of them filed outside, Gloria and the others wished them luck. Ann and Jackie piled into the backseat as Adam and Felicia got into the drivers side. As Adam started the car he turned to smile at Jackie and Ann. “Alright girls,” he smiled. “Let’s go meet the parents.”</p>
