<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Rick was going upstairs, he felt numb all over, as if his brain suddenly stopped, but he was still alive...
He dropped down the stairs and fell on his numb and painless side. He got exposed to the gas, which was endlessly going into every pore in his body, especially into his nasal cavity, and into the lungs. Slowly, He was being numbed no more, as he could move his head, to see what was going on. Suddenly, brown fur was growing out of his lower back, as an extra set of legs was forming, and his upper body extended, and his lower body curved downwards. His legs began to grow bigger and longer, and his feet were reshaping, as all the toes were merging together, and becoming as hard as stone. Suddenly, his being started to grow very slowly, but progressively working. When he was able to stand, his head just barely rubbed the ceiling, hairs rubbing against it. The gas still entering his system, was making his muscles grow slightly bigger, and growing 2" taller every breath he took. He realized soon he would break through the ceiling. He just laid down on his side which was somewhat awkward to him now. But he wasn't low enough to escape the gas, and he was still getting bigger!
"This is bad..." He said to himself. "Gotta find a way out of here. Fuck it..." He stood up, and he was about 7' 2" tall, and his legs, arms, and his entire being were getting bigger. He took one deep breath, and didn't know what he was doing. He immediately grew 1.25x his current muscle mass and at least 4-6 inches taller, and his lung capacity increased, making it possible to suck in more of the gas.
"Wow, this power is overwhelming, but- Oh fuck! The ceiling! I forgot Tabitha's cooking tonight! This is bad... Might as well "surprise" her..."
*CRACK, CRACK, BOOM!!!!* "Hey, Honey..."
"HOLY SHIT!" She spilled her stew on her foot. "FUCK!!!" She reached for the phone on one foot, and dialed 911 while holding her foot with another, and she tripped and fell over right before hitting "Send".
"No, wait! Don't!" he said. Immediately he smashed the phone. Little did he know, the gas was escaping and he was still breathing it in, and getting bigger, again! His muscles grew to massive proportions, as big as freakin' overgrown watermelons! They were so damn huge! And his legs, oh, don't even get this writer started! THEY, were about the size of big giant boulders, and growing! His tail looked like it was growing faster than everything else on his body, and it twice as big as him, and still growing! He was now standing at least 9 feet tall, and weighing in at over a ton of muscle and weight combined. With nothing else to do, and nothing left TO do with his frightened family, he runs away, with the gas trailing behind him. "I'm sorry honey... It's for your own good... You can't live with a freak like me..." He said to himself, as he rode away, never to be seen or heard from again...
-------Later,----------------
With the gas still trailing behind him, Rick reached the Great Plains, or, in meteorologist terms, "dead center of Tornado Alley". He tried to stop for some air, but instead, got caught in the path of the gas that turned him into the creature he's become, a centaur. He took many pants, and grew about a foot taller (10' 2" is his current height), and twice his muscle mass. His tail is still growing faster than he is, and it's about three times bigger than he is...
"Damn tail... I wish that I would grow as fast as my tail, so long as I'm in this gas..." And he started to grow even faster! What's happening?  Did his wish actually come true? Well, at any rate, he was already about 11' 4" tall, and double his current muscle mass, and that added extra height, so combined, he was about 13-15' tall... He could lift a tank and throw it all the way to Japan!
"Hmm... I wish I would gain an extra pound of muscle spread all over my body every second I'm in this gas..." And the muscles in his human half and mare half began to inflate even faster, as he looked like the world's best bodybuilder multiplied by 3 stacked on top of each other!
"These wishes are working! I wish for these things:
1) My human head to grow in proportion to this body...
2) I wish these legs were as big as two t-rex's combined!
3) I wish that this gas has twice the strength and potency than now!
Immediately, the wishes all came true! First, his entire head and all the organs inside it started to inflate to proportionate itself to the rest of his muscular body. Next, his legs became only 50% bigger, but he was standing at about 23' 4", before the last wish kicked in... The gas had gained strength, and his height and muscles started to grow even faster, with him gaining 20 pounds all over his body every second! He was also getting much, much taller, to about 30' 6". He weighed as much as 3 tons now, with the force to destroy an entire country, like Hiroshima, Japan in 1945. He'd be the military's ultimate weapon. Will he succumb to the military, or stay around and get even bigger before the military decides to kill him? Tune in next time.</p>
