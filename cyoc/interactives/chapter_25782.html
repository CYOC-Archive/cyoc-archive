<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James went into the kitchen, quickly grabbing a beer, he didn't know if he would be able to handle his best friend being his wet dream. He opened it up and walked back out to Will he didn't even have it in his hands for more than a second before Will grabbed it out of his hands and gulped it down. She drank too much for her to handle and some of it started to stream down from her mouth. James grabbed it. &quot;That's enough for you...&quot; He said, obviously getting turned on by the sight of her wet body.<br />
 <br />
At this point, Will was in a state of delirium. He felt great, unlike he'd ever felt before. But because his mind was so cloudy, it just hadn't registered that he was a 10 on the hottie scale. He could feel his nipples become erect in the cold air of the apartment. He went over to the couch and plopped down, causing his large breasts to jiggle in the process. &quot;All right, big man, if I can't drink, then what can we do?&quot; She said, spreading her legs as she sat, in the way that would be normal for a guy, but not proper for a woman.<br />
 <br />
James' hard on strained the fabric of his pants as he saw, Will's sex, it was everything he'd ever wanted and since he went to Japan he hadn't had any sex, he was feeling the effects of being single and horny. He shook his head, regaining his composure once again. &quot;Mate, lets get you into some clothes, don't really need you sitting around naked.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Will grinned, biting his lower lip. &quot;What's the matter, having a hard time concentrating?&quot; In his mind he was still a guy, so he felt as though he was making fun of James' predicament, when in fact it was reality. &quot;Fine, I'll get dressed.&quot; He said standing up, which was more difficult because of the alcohol, he fell forward into James.<br />
 <br />
James grabbed at Will, helping him steady himself, without noticing it, James had grabbed Will's perfect ass and had begun to grope it as he would any woman's. It was nice and plump in his hand, after a moment he finally realized what he was doing, and moved his hand to the mid of his smooth back.<br />
<br />
Will felt a flush of enjoyment as he felt his rear being touched, especially because it was James for some reason. It felt almost as though Will couldn't help himself around James. It had to be the beer, he'd just push it off and not talk about it. But Will just kept looking, and James didn't stop holding him. James was looking attractive tonight, his rugged good looks, those abs that he knew he had and that big ol' cock between his legs, he was a veritable stud.<br />
<br />
James held Will close, he was getting a major hardon just by holding her...er...him, he had to remind himself that this was his best friend in the world. Damn was she hot though, just standing there buck naked and not even trying to cover herself from him. In fact, it seemed like Will was getting turned on by the fact that she was naked around him.<br />
<br />
Will's hands began to wonder, she began rubbing the outside of James' pants around his crotch, causing him to become even more aroused, Will was feeling flush once more as she was enjoying this too. Will moved his hands up, and behind the waistband of his pants and the boxers James was wearing. She stroked his rock hard member gently, up and down. She looked up at James, who had begun to close his eyes as he felt the pleasure from her touch. <br />
<br />
James' hands wondered too, moving one hand to Will's full C-cup breast, he began to fondle it, teasing the nipple, he heard a slight moan come out of Will's beautiful lips. His other hand groping Will's fine ass, feeling how wonderfully plump it was in his hand. &quot;No...we...shouldn't...you're&quot; He tried to say but his words fell on def ears as the female Will continued her escapade, for reasons not even she could understand, yet.<br />
<br />
She broke from his grasp, gently. She pulled his shirt off of him with exquisite grace and quickness. Then she grabbed on either side of his pants and yanked both of them down and off in one quick swipe. Now James stood in the middle of the living room, naked for the most part, she changed that, taking off his shoes and socks. She could feel her heart pulse with excitement as she saw his erect member, just bobbing there. The Will that was the real Will was present but wanted nothing more than James in her. <br />
<br />
James stood there, looking at the naked female, the woman of his dreams was right in front of him...was right in front of him. The exact perfect woman he always dreamt of was right there for him. But it wasn't all focussed yet, he was still too inebriated to figure out the rest of it.<br />
<br />
Will walked slowly, seductively over to the now naked James, she grinned sheepishly as she got onto her knees, looking up at him with those beautiful aqua blue eyes. She grabbed the shaft of James' penis, stroking it a few times, she kissed the tip of it. Then, she began to lick it playfully, seeing James shift his head back in pleasure. She began to massage the tip and the shaft with her tongue, and after a few more moments of playing, she began to suck on his gorgeous cock, deep throating it. As she played with him, she began to rub herself, sticking a couple fingers into her vagina and massaging the clit as she stood on her knees.<br />
<br />
James just stood there, feeling how great a good blow job always felt. But this was better than anything he'd ever had in the past, it was perfect. After a few moments, he began to push on her head, going in rhythm to the bobbing of her head. Those beautiful lips looked amazing wrapped around his cock. Finally after what seemed like an eternity, James wanted more...needed more. He made her stop (even though he didn't exactly want that), picking her up off the ground, making her wrap her legs and arms around his waist and neck so he could carry her. He brought her to the bedroom, where he laid her nicely on the bed.<br />
<br />
Will smiled, she knew he wasn't able to resist him. But why was she so fixated with him, they were best friends, she just felt he deserved to know her appreciation. She lay on the bed, holding herself up with her elbows. She bit her lip once more, showing her anticipation. She spread her legs wide, giving him a good view of her hairless crotch, along with a perfect inviting view of another set of lips.<br />
<br />
James wasted no time, not even to put on a condom, he slid onto the bed with her, inserting his member into her virgin cunt. Slowly, so as not to hurt her in the least. He inched his way in slowly, causing her to moan with each passing inch. He began to play with her boobs, teasing the nipple, he even drew in close to lick and suck on the nipples, causing her to have to bite her lip show she wouldn't moan so loud. Finally, he was in all the way and it was a perfect fit. They began to match each other's thrust, they stayed up close to one another, even kissing, with passion.<br />
<br />
Will took her tongue out of James' mouth, she moaned even more as he thrust a little harder, hitting her g-spot. She wrapped her legs around his waist to hold him closer, she kissed him again. It was at this time that it finally dawned on Will that he was really a woman, but it didn't change the fact of what she wanted at this point. She could feel her body shudder in orgasmic waves, but she hadn't yet climaxed completely. &quot;Oh god James, deeper....I need you...&quot; She pleaded with him between gasps of pleasure.<br />
<br />
James obliged and began to thrust deeper and harder than he had been. He could feel her walls pull on his cock, making his body feel like it was in heaven. He played with her large boobs, feeling content in every way imaginable.<br />
<br />
She slowed her thrusts, making James stop. He looked disappointed, but she put a finger on his lips. &quot;Trust me.&quot; James stood back on his knees, backing away from Will, to give her room. Will smirked as she got off the bed, then got back onto the bed, her ass facing him, she stood on all fours, turning her head to face him, she gave him a sheepish look. &quot;I want you to bang me as hard as you can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what you want...you want it doggie style, don't ya beautiful?&quot; James said, nearly forgetting that was once his mate, his pal. With little thought into it, James inched over to the inviting ass of the beautiful young lass before him, his hand massaged the bottom, she moaned slightly. He slid his member back into the wet, tight orifice. He felt up the sides of those lovely smooth legs, gripping her thighs, he began to thrust, slowly, then harder and harder.<br />
<br />
Now she moaned uncontrollably, waves and waves of unimaginable pleasure just rushed through her body. &quot;Oh god, James...don't stop...&quot; With each thrust, Will could feel her hanging breasts sway back and forth. She could also feel his balls up against her ass with every thrust of their hips.<br />
<br />
James grabbed Will's hair, pulling her head back...for some reason he knew she would enjoy that, and she did. Finally after what seemed like and eternity, James shot his load into Will's hot, sopping wet cunt. Will in turn, began to buck her hips as she orgasms with waves and waves of heat/pleasure. &quot;Oh god, that was fantastic.&quot; She said, staying in her position, she could feel James' member slowly start to soften, and she liked it. <br />
<br />
Will laid on her back, as did James, she then turned and laid on her side. They spooned there, just naked on top of the bed. Will could feel James cock glide into her ass crack, she smiled. &quot;You were amazing....just let me know when you're ready for round two.&quot; She said, moving one hand to play with his softened member. James kissed her neck in return. Placing his hands on her breasts. What would happen next?</p>
