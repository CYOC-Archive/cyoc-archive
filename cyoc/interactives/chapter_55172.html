<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Abbey gasped as Marie caught the latest to arrive up on the story of the witches <br />
and Marie Cruz, &quot;to be honest I can't really see either group as heroes. The witches seem to <br />
break every possible rule to defend the position that children are inherently good and <br />
adults are inherently evil...&quot;<br />
<br />
She then paused for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;But Marie Cruz does not seem to be that much better,&quot; Alice picked up, &quot;She has tortured <br />
people, she has killed others, and she has pushed others away...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. P has killed people,&quot; Marie reminded them, &quot;remember that. Also remember that this <br />
was a LONG time ago. The world that Marie Cruz and the witches lived in was very <br />
different from the one we lived in today. You can not just say that Marie Cruz was bad <br />
because she had killed people. Many of the humans and and those of &quot;race&quot; of &quot;man&quot; that <br />
she had killed were vile attackers that had sought to unleash horrors on the world, and it is <br />
likely that if the three witches had tried to unleash their curse on Rome rather then a then <br />
small town on the very edge of what the Western world then considered &quot;civilized&quot; her <br />
Godfather, Gabriel, would have killed them before they even had the chance to do what <br />
they did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Marie Cruz and her Godfather largely sought to preempt most things before they <br />
became worse?&quot; Alice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way, but because gathering news back then was not like gathering news today, most <br />
times they couldn't learn about many of the forces they would fight before they they <br />
happened. And in fact, much of what Marie knew of the witches and their actions before <br />
they did them was only possible through Marie's second sight, which is not necessarily as <br />
certain as one would think. Marie didn't know entirely what would happen, and second <br />
sight can only show those that happen what could happen. Various superstitious &quot;seers&quot; <br />
would tell both Hitler and Stalin that they would conquer the Western world. Most of them <br />
only showed a rather short sighted world... Hitler conquered the Western world from 1939 <br />
to 1942, after 1942, Hitler's Empire fell apart and was gone by 1945...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the events of the war that destroyed Hitler's Reich ended up dividing Europe between <br />
those that would support the USA and those that the Soviets conquered, which meant that <br />
Stalin was never successful at conquered the world,&quot; Lawrence commented, &quot;though, the <br />
Cold War that resulted wasn't something that made the world better...&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie nodded, &quot;we're getting distracted though from the point of the story.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Alice and Abbey spoke together, as their interruption was the cause for it.<br />
<br />
Glass Marie sighed at her infinitely growing audience. 'I don't know if this makes things <br />
easier or harder.'   Now she had five cubs, and three adults now all listening... This was <br />
proving to be a headache... Maybe it was better the way the game often altered reality... it <br />
saved people from going stark raving mad. <br />
<br />
Lilly had to ask, &quot;Marie are you going to die?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; The blond blue eyed lupman pup in her black and red dress blinked dumbfounded <br />
at the Carnelian colored twin.  <br />
<br />
&quot;uh... if the game is killed, does that mean anyone with a connection or effected or altered <br />
by the game will die too?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie looked at her incredulous, &quot;Of course not! The game is an INFECTION... it's killing the <br />
disease for the cure, not killing the patient to cure the disease!&quot; <br />
<br />
The other pups looked at Lilly, &quot;What do you mean 'killing the game'?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilly shook her head, &quot;I dunno.&quot; <br />
<br />
Glass Marie sighed. <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Amethyst led the pups into a living room area, partially with the hopes of letting them &quot;veg <br />
out&quot; in front of the television for a while. She had left Bart, Jenny, Kevin, and Marcy in the <br />
arms of their mother, and Abbey and Alice remained in the mirrorverse. The purple she <br />
wolf, with some sparkling luster in her fur guessed they were searching for their sister. <br />
Amy had departed for her shrine area with Zelipe tagging along. Amethyst didn't worry <br />
about that, though it could be argued she didn't worry about anything. If they truly needed <br />
supervision, one of the Omegas would take up the task. Amethyst's main concern was the <br />
gem twins. She'd help the gem teens whenever possible (much to Garnett's annoyance <br />
when she became &quot;trapped&quot; in Amethyst's bosom).<br />
<br />
As they made their way in, they found the present Omegas dancing for nine very depressed <br />
looking cubs.<br />
<br />
&quot;There has to be something we can do to make them happy,&quot; Jay said weakly.<br />
<br />
Amethyst sighed at the sight of the Pride's cubs. While little could shake Amethyst's cheery <br />
demeanor, the sadness radiating off the cubs came close. She then noticed how the cubs <br />
were fascinated by the Omega's dancing. It did give Amethyst a slight idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we can entertain them too,&quot; Amethyst said with a smile and took Martha and <br />
Whitney's paws and joined in. The pups were close behind her.<br />
<br />
Mary looked up slightly as stroked the fur on Moja's back to see Amethyst and all of the <br />
gem twins joining in.  <br />
<br />
Amethyst began her dance, and the gem twins followed close behind. Amethyst began at <br />
the center of the living room without even thinking about it, miracle or miracles avoiding <br />
walking into the TV.  The gem twins danced in a pattern that never repeated itself, twisting <br />
about the omegas like wind. <br />
<br />
Amethyst let her body do what came naturally as did the twins. The dance of chaos, the <br />
dance of absolute freedom, not as living crystal as they had been, but they danced all the <br />
same.  The left the grieving cubs entranced at the hypnotic movements, forgetting their <br />
sadness for just a little while, forgetting their loss for just a little while, leaving only the <br />
dance to look upon. <br />
<br />
Martha and her fellow omegas found the dance Amethyst and her charges were doing was <br />
proving greater than the ones the Omegas were doing.  Even her own daughters Giselle <br />
and Gretchen moved so naturally, so enveloping, that Martha found herself following <br />
THEIR steps. <br />
<br />
The nine cubs eyes were all glued to the dancing gem wolves. <br />
<br />
When Kaylee came in with her pups a short time later planning on playing the Wii console...  <br />
The moment she and her pups saw the dance they forgot all about that. And almost like <br />
zombies they sat down on the floor the coach having been taken and just watched the <br />
lovely dance, their own worries and problems forgotten for the time being. <br />
<br />
As much as the gem twins themselves wished it, this dance couldn't last forever, they were <br />
flesh and blood now, their muscled burned from use and now knew tiredness. But they <br />
would dance as long as they could. <br />
<br />
'Was Kurse evil?' Amethyst thought, 'Is it good that the witches' shadow is gone? Is the <br />
world a better place without them? Yes. Yes. Yes.' But like the yacht victims who had been <br />
turned into beasts free to express their vices without limit, Amethyst secretly admitted to <br />
herself, if the circumstances had been different, she wouldn't have minded the beautiful <br />
dance lasting forever. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatcha Doin' Amy?&quot; The light pink male asked his sister at her little shrine built <br />
specifically for her.  <br />
<br />
Amy said before ringing the bell, &quot;I'm praying for families who no longer exist and people <br />
with loved ones that no longer consciously know they even had. I'm praying the gods show <br />
them kindness and mercy for the unwilling sacrifice they've had to make..&quot;<br />
<br />
Zelipe scratch his head, 'Ever since this mess with the Game started, sis' has been making <br />
less sense than normal....' It made Zelipe almost wish he had paid more attention when his <br />
sister had explained in depth her theology. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Mistress, if you feel Yomato's wrongness upon you cost you being there for the deaths of <br />
your best friend, then I'll gladly submit myself indefinitely to your service in raising and <br />
protecting your-&quot; Umeko began. <br />
<br />
Penny turned at her once getting a face full of over-sized she-wolf bosom in the process, <br />
&quot;Now let's not go overboard here!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
With his mate Fran on one arm, Jensen looked at his packmates, and the police who had <br />
fought so bravely at their side. <br />
<br />
&quot;To ALL of you...&quot; He began, &quot;June, Hope, Grace, Zack. Nicole, Alexandra, Isabelle, Megan, <br />
Ashley, Margot. Chiyoye, and Yamato. And of course you too   Millie. As your Alpha, I wish <br />
to say here and now, that you honor the Big Bad Wolf Pack with your courage, dedication <br />
and your sacrifice. Yet WE suffered in loses, so you the Pack, you honor us as well for your <br />
own sarfice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just doing our duty.&quot; Brian said simply. <br />
<br />
&quot;All the same, thank you.&quot; Jensen said.</p>
