<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After some very sexually charged moments, Gabe finally found Terry again before they left for the after-party. It was then he noticed that Terry seemed happier for some reason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, there you are. I&#39;ve been looking all over for you. Uh, did something happen? You look very relaxed or something?&quot; Gabe asked. Actually, it sort of felt like the whole air around was different somehow, especially when Terry giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehe, I just got something out of my system,&quot; Terry said, and the way he said it made it clear to Gabe what he had just done. Although the part that he left out was that he ended up getting the straight out of his system. &quot;You should do the same. You&#39;re interested in Danny and Jackson, right? Well, I doubt they&#39;ll agree to a threesome with all that drama they had, so why don&#39;t you choose one to fuck at the party?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabe nodded but gulped while he did it. Anxiety was creeping upon him. He wanted to get the gay out of his system, but how on earth was he going to ask one of them to help him with that?<br />
<br />
-----------------------<br />
<br />
So, after a day of showing off, experimentation, and not too much swimming, oddly enough, Danny&#39;s swimming pool party was done, and Gabe&#39;s after-party was about to start. While on the drive to Gabe&#39;s house, Jin decided to remind his younger brother a couple of things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, remember tonight is a school night, so no drinking, and we need to leave by your curfew, okay?&quot; Danny just rolled his eyes. Gone was that cool bro that fucked Terry, and back was the lame one. Granted, if Danny was in Jin&#39;s shoes, he would have said the same thing, not that he would admit that. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah, I know, bro. My body is a temple, and I&#39;m not going to ruin it by binge drinking and staying up super late.&quot; This statement seemed to have pleased Jin as he nodded and resumed focusing on driving. It was then that Danny got a notification on his phone from the Chronivac. Well, it looks like Sasha officially infected Tristan, the Waterpolo captain. Man, that was fast; then again considering, how quickly Terry hooked up with Jin, maybe it wasn&#39;t fast enough. Probably shouldn&#39;t mention anything about watching them fuck and jacking off to it, though.<br />
<br />
Man, there were so many transformations to keep track of, so Danny took this moment to refresh himself on all the changes he made. Luckily he transferred his notes over to his phone for this reason. Gabe and Terry were about to enter the 5th day of their week-long transformation. Not long now until they&#39;re fully Asian twinks. Meanwhile, Jackson was about to enter the 6th day of his two-week transformation. Almost halfway there, huh? Ah, Danny couldn&#39;t wait to see him panicking when Jackson starts to get really old. Sam, the soccer player, was also on that list and was on day 3. Darn, he should have had Gabe invite him to do some inspections. Oh well, maybe he&#39;ll see him at school tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Jin was at the halfway point of his transformation. Looking over at his brother, that seemed about right. Pretty hunky but still had a ways to go before he reached his level, and what a sight that will be. His father was only on day one of five of his fat loss transformation. Danny didn&#39;t take too much note before leaving for the pool, but his dad did look a bit thinner. Finally, there were all the nerds that he was going to transform into jocks. They were all transforming at different rates but, it was going to be interesting to see how the school will look tomorrow. Anyway, after refreshing himself, Jin piped up once again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, by the way, Danny ... uh... want to work out together sometime? I&#39;ve been feeling pretty... energetic lately, but I don&#39;t know a thing about working out. So, think you can show me the ropes later?&quot; Danny looked elated when he heard those words coming from his brother. He always wanted his jock older brother to work out with him when he was younger, and now that wish was coming true. Maybe he can even rope their father into this when he&#39;s further along with his transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course we can, bro. I&#39;ll let you know when I have time after we get home!&quot; Jin smiled at how excited his little brother sounded. Honestly, though, Jin was really going to ask if Terry was going to be at the party, but then he figured that he would just simply see for himself if he was there or not. Not to mention he really didn&#39;t want to explain to his brother what happened between him and Terry. Honestly, Jin was still a bit frazzled at what he did with Terry. It was so unlike him to do something like have sex in public, but he had to admit, it was pretty exciting. Maybe if Terry was there, it probably would be nice to enjoy his newly realized sexuality a bit more slowly in a room with a lock. Then again, he was also thinking of what it would be like to have sex with someone more muscular than Terry to see what that was like. Probably shouldn&#39;t look for that at a high school party but maybe when he gets back to college tomorrow, he can get looking.<br />
<br />
-----------------------<br />
<br />
At the party, Danny couldn&#39;t help notice that all the people that Gabe invited were all men. It probably was a subconscious decision on Gabe&#39;s part, but geez the when the Chronivac makes you gay, it really hits you hard. It was a surprisingly quiet after-party since everyone was tired from the day at the pool, and it was a school night as well. They mostly just had pizza and talked for a bit while watching sports. Honestly, it was a nice change of pace for Danny, who was more used to the wild teen parties. Plus, it gave him time to observe more changes. Jackson looked annoyed that everyone invited was a guy. However, later in the night, he decided to regale his greatest achievements on the field. Wow, he was already talking like an old man, hehe.<br />
<br />
Terry continued being his cocky self but become a bit flustered when he and Jin made eye contact. Jin meanwhile flirted a bit with Terry when he thought no one was looking. Just wink here and touch there, but more flirting than he usually does. If those two end up disappearing during the party, it was safe to say Danny will know exactly what they were doing. Thinking back, Danny should have figured that Jin was into men as well as women. Jin looked at Batman and Superman the same way as he did Wonder Woman back in the day, but Danny was a bit too young to really process that. Ah, Batman, now that Danny thought of it, Batman was one of Danny&#39;s earliest inspirations to work out. Although he wasn&#39;t conscious of the fact, maybe he too looked at Batman the same way as Jin...<br />
<br />
Finally, there was Gabe, who was acting a bit strange, if he had to be honest. He always seems to want to do something but suddenly shying away after a second. Danny didn&#39;t know what to make of this other than the mental changes making him shyer. <br />
<br />
Little did he know Gabe acted this way because he wanted to talk to Danny or Jackson about sex, but it was hard to with everyone around. It was now that Gabe was regretting the idea of an after-party with all these watching eyes. Not to mention he still had to figure out exactly what to say to them. Thankfully for him, later in the night, one of them had to excuse themselves to go to the bathroom. This was his chance to ask!</p>
<hr/><h3>
But who did Gabe ask, and what was their response?</h3>
