<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">About 50 feet underwater, Gretta finally found the circular grate she was looking for. The titanic crocodile woman grabbed the wrought iron bars in her mighty hands, braced her huge feet against the riverbed, and pulled with all of her might. In the dingy water, bubbles of air exhaled in her exertion. She gritted her teeth, put all of her powerful muscles into it, and with relief she felt the half rusted metal start to give out *around* the grate. She gave it everything she had and was thrown back against the rocky floor of the river as the huge grate gently floated free and clattered to the ground below.<br />
<br />
The crocodile looked up the the surface of the water as the sun began to set and carefully rose to the top of the river. Only her head bobbed up, a trail of rippling water behind in, as she exhaled slowly, sucked in air again, and submerged.<br />
<br />
The crocodile lady swam into a narrow (to her) tunnel that emerged into a fetid storm drain. There, she found the heavy water lines and the pump system leading to the zoo. With a grin, she raised her container, disconnected a hose, and fed the pink liquid into the water lines.<br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
Boss and her newfound friend Sandra began to tour the zoo. They ran into other reptile people leisurely exploring now that everything was safe, and stumbled onto the giant komodo dragon with her whole snout stuck into a large 5 fallon pail of ice cream.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thif if pwetty gut,&quot; the komodo grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Too bad I&#39;ll never get to try any.&quot; The cobra laughed, and continued on her way. Eventually, the reptile stopped at the &quot;African Savannah&quot; section and her jaw almost fell. &quot;Holy mammalssss.&quot;<br />
<br />
The snake blinked several times as she observed a family of tall giraffes, round hippos, zebras, ostriches, two rhinoceros, an elephant, lions, gazelles, and some colorful African birds of varying shapes and sizes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh.&quot; She thrilled, looking up to little Sandra. &quot;We&#39;re about to make some new friendsssss. Quite literally.&quot;<br />
<br />
Standing in the center of the sprawling exhibits, the snake raised the remote and began scanning. She had to keep moving close to keep the device&#39;s operating range, but eventually she had all of the animals scanned in and ready to be changed.<br />
<br />
&quot;My goodnessssss.&quot; The snake realized. &quot;Heh, if we got ssssoooo big from being ssssooo sssssmall, how big are thesssse guysss gonna get?&quot;<br />
<br />
The anole gulped on top of the cobra&#39;s head and looked around nervously. &quot;Great. More things to step on me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not for much longer.&quot; The snake grinned. The devious wheels inside her head began to form something for Sandra, but it wasn&#39;t quite the right time.<br />
<br />
The cobra woman stood back and tried to decide where to start. She checked several options on the remote and was amazed to find that there was the ability to raise mental awareness. In fact, she could have individuals share memories and experiences. This was an all together startling revelation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ssssandra darling,&quot; the snake reached up and made the little anole woman yelp as she brought her off of her head. Sitting in the snake&#39;s arms, the much tinier lizard woman stared up nervously. &quot;I need to try sssssomething, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;D-Do I have a choice?&quot; The former human gulped loudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not particularly.&quot; The cobra shrugged. She scanned little Sandra and decided she wanted to experiment with the anole&#39;s mental state.<br />
<br />
First, she slid the anole into &#39;sharing&#39; mode and then selected herself. The lizard woman let out a cry and began shaking as suddenly she knew everything the cobra knew, experienced all of her memories, emotions, feelings, and her current perception. The anole could see from both her own perspective and the snake&#39;s, watching herself squirming while simultaneously experiencing herself and the snake. This proved far too much for the little anole and she began screaming.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-No! NO! Make it stop! Make it stop! I... I&#39;m you! I&#39;m me!&quot; She looked around desperately as she heard her own voice and thought it at the same time as the cobra experienced it. It was the most screwed up sensation to feel everything the snake was feeling as well as herself. She was literally two people at once. After a while, the anole laid back overwhelmed and watched as the snake watched her, which meant somehow she was watching herself. Her entire concept of &#39;self&#39; have been divided into two selves. Not two halfs in the same body. She was literally two beings at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make it stop.&quot; The anole gasped, her chest falling quickly. She felt the snake&#39;s fascination and responded before she had a chance to finish thinking the question. &quot;I&#39;m you right now. I&#39;m both of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
The snake blinked as she realized the anole knew what was she was thinking and thought something else involuntarily. The two exchanged horrified glances. The snake realized the anole was literally experiencing the world as the snake and Sandra at the same time. The concept was mind blowing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to feel what thissss isssss like.&quot; The serpent kneeled carefully and placed Sandra on the ground. The overwhelmed reptile woman sat with a mild headache as she felt herself moving to grab the remote as well as watching the snake move to grab the remote. She realized she felt Boss breathing. The gentle rise and fall of her chest. The sensation of arousal at the power she had in the remote. Her plans for the zoo. Her attraction to Sandra. Simultaneously, Sandra started to gain the ability to make sense of the cobra&#39;s memories and began to remember them. She was literally growing more intelligent as she began to assimilate the cobra&#39;s intellect and knowledge into her own mind.<br />
<br />
The snake tumbled back onto her ass and hit the dirt with a thud. Sandra winced as she felt a sharp blow to her butt. The remote twirled out of the snake&#39;s hand and hit the dust beside her unharmed as the two lizards now experienced each other live. Every thought, every feeling, every seperate sensation, they were two linked minds seeing the world from each other&#39;s perspective. While Sandra was clearly Sandra, and Boss was still Boss, they were somehow each other at once, still individuals, and not a joined consciousness.<br />
<br />
The snake sat and began to converse with Sandra entirely through her own mind. The anole did the same. They shared lighting fast discussions that is was not possible to share through speech. Their intellects and their memories and their skills simultaneously bled into each other&#39;s minds. For a moment, and just a moment, they considered physically joining into one entity with the remote and sharing the bliss of joining their two consciousnesses into one whole, but they decided that was terrifying. They didn&#39;t want to lose themselves completely.<br />
<br />
Finally, overwhelmed after mere minutes, the anole managed to crawl over to the remote, feeling the cobra growing heavily aroused and becoming aroused herself as they exchanged dirty sexy thoughts, and managed to turn off their uncanny experiencing of each other. With a startled gasp, the two almost fell backward as suddenly they were no longer linked. They had certainly retained each other&#39;s memories and experiences, thoughts, feelings, and personalities, though. It was just no longer live.<br />
<br />
&quot;A-Are you okay?&quot; The snake finally sat up and stared down at the Anole. The little green lizard stared up at the snake in contemplative curiosity and blinked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do... do you still remember... everything? From me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I do.&quot; The snake blinked. &quot;I have your memoriessss. Everything you&#39;ve ever known and learned.&quot;<br />
<br />
The anole stared at the snake quietly and they began laughing like two kids that had done something particularly bad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh noooo.&quot; Boss put her hand to her mouth. &quot;W-What did we do? I-I feel sssssad that we aren&#39;t together anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;M-Me too. I&#39;m... I&#39;ve never felt that kind of... emotion... before. Can... can we try that merging thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yesss, yesss!&quot; The snake grinned wildly. &quot;Later, ssssweetheart. Later.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two stared at each other in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you.&quot; Sandra said softly.<br />
<br />
The snake stared down at the anole of her blush went deadly white. &quot;I... I love you too, Ssss-Ssssandra. I can&#39;t wait to... to... merge ussss.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was an awkward silence as the two creatures stared at each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, do you want to raise these mammals now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yesss.&quot; The snake stood. The anole staggered onto her feet and carefully cradled the remote as Boss wobbled on her feet, groggy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unnnh. All right. So, if we can join oursssselvessss like that, can we not share piecessss of our knowledge with othersss?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve found it.&quot; Sandra stared at the remote and typed carefully. She grinned at her success. &quot;It&#39;s already set. I made it so that in addition to the transformation we... uh, you, you went through from Todd, the animals we change will gain certain knowledge. Like, the process, what it is, what the remote does, what happened to the reptiles, just a general sense of what&#39;s happened so far. So they won&#39;t be starting from a blank slate, you see. They&#39;ll already be aware of what&#39;s going on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Incredible.&quot; The snake knelt down and took the remote carefully, marvelling at the complicated routine that Sandra had developed. The snake, now infused with the former human&#39;s knowledge of computers and technology, began to modify some of the routine to streamline it and incorporate it into their already existing transformation settings.<br />
<br />
The two reptiles stared at each other in shock. They realized that even now their minds were melding together. With each other&#39;s thoughts and memories their personalities were changing to become identical. They were losing their &quot;selves&quot; and mentally merging into one being just by the virtue of having bonded to begin with. It was mentally like mixing primary colors to make something else. The two halves were there in a different form.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m you.&quot; Boss blinked suddenly, startled. It wasn&#39;t even an upsetting sensation. She had become Sandra. It made perfect logical sense to be her new friend and lover. Sandra, meanwhile, had assimilated all of &quot;Boss&quot; into Sandra to become the exact same thing. Suddenly, the thought of gifting these lowly animals with intelligence and humanoid form seemed almost godlike. They understood the gravity of it all.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t stand it any more.&quot; The anole suddenly lept forward and grabbed the snake&#39;s arm. &quot;Please... please... let&#39;s merge. Let&#39;s join ourselves together.<br />
<br />
&quot;O-Okay.&quot; The snake blinked, startled as the tiny anole assertively took the remote. The meek Sandra side in Boss was dominated by the dominant Boss side that Sandra felt. The two were growing more fractured by the second... they both knew they had really messed themselves up.<br />
<br />
&quot;What form do you want?&quot; Sandra touched and typed frantically.<br />
<br />
&quot;T-The sssssame you do.&quot; Boss gulped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two heads?&quot; Sandra looked up. The snake grinned in toothy amazement and nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right. Here we go. Let&#39;s fix this before we both go mad.&quot; Sandra hit the button on the remote.<br />
<br />
The two of them suddenly felt compelled to intertwine their fingers. Sandra took the snake&#39;s giant hand in her own and gasped as she began to grow in size. The snake locked fingers with the growing anole and shivered as those fingers now blended and melted together into a lumpy mass. The mass in turn shrank smooth. It was now impossible to tell where the growing Sandra began and the now shrinking Boss ended. Their blood vessels and muscle joined together. Their nerves joined. There was a sense of relief as their minds began to send signals to each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re merging!&quot; Boss/Sandra said excitedly, her nipples going hard as their sizes began to even and they pulled further into each other, joined awkwardly at the elbow and starting to take on a similar color. The snake moaned as her snake features began to decrease and the human sized anole moaned deeply as she felt everything Boss felt. The two leaned in and began to kiss each other on the lips, playing with each other&#39;s pussies, as they merged to the shoulder and their torsos began to meld together.<br />
<br />
Now, their forms began to really twist. The cobra could no longer be called a cobra. She was partially anole and partially snake. A hybridized cross between both Sandra and Boss. Sandra, too, was taking on the same form. Their torso was merged down to the thigh and still they were pulling into each other, flesh bonding, merging. The two halves were becoming a whole.<br />
<br />
Kissing and making out with themselves passionately, the two twinning females laid back and let themselves melt into each other. At one point, as their genitals began to pull together, both experienced the sensation of both masturbating and playing with another woman at the same time. The thrill of this was beyond anything anybody had ever felt. They continued to warp and change, becoming less of a cobra and more of a lizard woman, genes twisting and blending.<br />
<br />
As their tails and asses merged together, their colors changed, their bone structures altered, and they began to settle into their joined two-headed snake lizard form. Something like a cross began a long nosed monitor lizard and a deadly cobra began to emerge as their being began to settle.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll need a new name.&quot; The left head grinned, as the right hand continued to masturbate frantically, the right head eager to cum.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re Sister.&quot; The right head smiled dreamily on it&#39;s long neck, as the left took control of the right arm experimentally and tried to stop it. The right fought back as muscles seized and the right arm tried to fight against itself. They both laughed hysterically as the left arm plunged into their pussy and began to finger. The right head began to moan desperately. The left began to pant. The two of them cried out in unison as they orgasmed there on the dirt path and their joined body gyrated, legs kicking frantically from climax.<br />
<br />
Finally, sitting up, the left arm raised to the right mouth and let the other lizard head lick off the fluids from their fingers. They kissed gently, embracing each other in their own arms, and blinked several times.<br />
<br />
The left head laughed coyly and licked the right&#39;s sinewy neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Sister said in unison. They stood up, finding that it was hard to move if they didn&#39;t jointly want to. They spent several moments getting used to just moving the body again and practiced walking. As they simultaneously experienced each other&#39;s knowledge gaps and filled them, it really only took seconds to relearn motor control.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, this is interesting.&quot; The left head said. She smirked and split herself from control of the body. The right head let out a yelp as she suddenly gained complete control of the form. They fell back onto their delicious reptilian ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;So much more flexible this way.&quot; The right head smiled. &quot;Think of the possibilities!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I am...&quot; The left head grinned lustfully. &quot;I know you are too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I?&quot; The right head considered, and nodded. &quot;Yeah, I am. We&#39;re such perverts.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two giggled, stood up, and grabbed the remote.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, then.&quot; Left cocked her head and turned to the other animals. Right looked the other way and they had a perfect 360* view of the savannah exhibit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where were we...&quot; Right finished.</p>
