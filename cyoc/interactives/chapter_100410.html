<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sebastian is a shy, tiny  little nerd with very few friends but after a trip to the magic gym to try and track down his old acquaintance Robert, things start to change.<br />
<br />
The transformation is slow at first. You wouldn&#39;t necessarily notice the slight advance in height or change in character as Sebastican become a bit  less withdrawn. Less likely to redden like a beetroot or hide his head in shame anytime anyone approached him. He was so skinny to begin with that even the few extra pounds in muscle didn&#39;t really show.<br />
<br />
As the changes started to increase, he was more likely to be found wandering around without a shirt at home, not that there was much of his body to show off. Yet. But it certainly caught his family a little by surprise who had already found that their darling son was suddenly more likely to answer back and quicker to anger.<br />
<br />
At school he still hung out with his old &#39;crew&#39; of misfits and nerds but Sebastian was now one of the more dominant members of the group, calling the shots and teasing the quietest members. As time went on and his interests started to shift from computers, sci-if and comics to girls and sports, he began to become disdainful of his old friends.<br />
<br />
His height and muscle mass was still increasing and now Sebastian was most likely to be found in front of a mirror after school as he took in every small change. He would flex each growing muscle in turn and mark his new height against the wall. It was looking like a cm or two every week. Then he would lean into the mirror to inspect his slowly improving face.<br />
<br />
Sometimes aspects of Sebastian&#39;s life would shift and he would shrug them off like it had always been so. Like the time he woke up in a different house, the smell of freshly cooked pancakes drifting up to his room. It was still pretty much the same mom and dad downstairs, just better dressed and more polished. Prouder of him, somehow, and with a bigger home and better cars.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t even really feel strange that the girls at schools were paying him more attention and he was flirting back with ease. Hadn&#39;t this always been the case? And his first kiss, outside the school gates with the French transfer student, was just the latest in a long line of encounters. When she begged him to accompany her home and take it further, he didn&#39;t need much persuasion. Suddenly he found himself knowing all the right moves, like they were second nature. Can&#39;t wait to tell the guys about this tonight, he thought to himself.<br />
<br />
Now his body was pretty impressive and it wasn&#39;t just at home he was showing it off. Every morning there would be a new item of clothing in his wardrobe, like it had always been there. He had all the best labels, all the right styles. His punk of a little brother would sometimes sneak in when he wasn&#39;t around to take the odd item and then Seb would wrestle him to the ground until their dad yelled at them to break it up. He loved to show off his strength and his athletic prowess, on and off the pitch. In and out of the bedroom. His brother was going to be the same. They both took after their handsome fucker of a dad, after all<br />
<br />
His friends at school were much different now and day by day Sebastian found himself rising to the top of the high school food chain, picking up some of the hottest girls at school on the way. He was notorious for not keeping his expanding cock in his trousers for long. Not that the girls took much persuasion.<br />
<br />
His grades had dropped but mom and dad didn&#39;t really seem to give a shit about that anymore. It&#39;s not like he&#39;s ever been the smartest guy but he&#39;s get into college via a sports scholarship alone.<br />
<br />
One day he passed one of his old nerd friends in the corridor. Seb was horsing around with one of his new bros, both acting like the overly confident, overly loud muscle studs they were. As he caught the nerd&#39;s eye, for a second memories of a different life, a different path hit him, only to be quickly consumed by the sex filled hormone fuelled existence that was now his own. He quickly shrugged it off, with his large muscle filled shoulders.<br />
<br />
When he woke up the next morning, his incredible brawn taking up most of his large bed, his hot face still grinning from his sexual hijinks the night before, it was as if something had suddenly permanently clicked into place. That constant sense of everything and everyone around him changing suddenly seemed to have ceased. His world was still again.<br />
<br />
He sat up in bed and rubbed a masculine hand over his right pack set of abs. Flexed his enormous biceps, one adorned with a barbed wire tattoo, and then brought his hand up to his perfect face and jaw. What a fucking life. <br />
<br />
His phone went off. A message from Rob. &#39;Bro at the gym, c u there?&#39;</p>
