<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Jen arrives at biology class, she is already feeling out of place with her cow udders sticking out. The classroom is filled with the usual murmur of students getting settled, but the moment Miss Walters enters, the room goes silent. She strides in with her majestic lion mane around her waist like a grass skirt and her lion cock tongue lolling out of her mouth, a clear indication of her excitement for the new chapter.<br />
<br />
A pair of furry balls hung from her chin, swinging gently as she walked. She cleared her throat, her lion&#39;s cock tongue flicking in anticipation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, class,&quot; Miss Walters began, her voice deep and resonant. &quot;Today, we&#39;re going to start a new chapter in our biology textbook, focusing on mammals. Can anyone tell me what distinguishes mammals from other classes of animals?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen&#39;s hand shot up, eager to participate despite her embarrassment. &quot;They have hair, or fur, and mammary glands for feeding their young!&quot; she exclaimed, trying to ignore the squishy feeling of her swollen udders.<br />
<br />
Miss Walters&#39; eyes lit up, a proud smile spreading across her human face. &quot;Very good, Jen. And speaking of mammary glands, let&#39;s talk about cows!&quot; The room grew tense as all eyes turned to Jen. She felt a cold sweat forming on her forehead, her udders growing heavier by the second. The classroom&#39;s usual smell of disinfectant and chalk dust was now tinged with a faint scent of animal musk.<br />
<br />
Miss Walters clicked to the next slide, displaying a detailed diagram of a cow&#39;s udder. &quot;As you can see, cows have four teats, which are used for milking. Now, I know this is a bit unorthodox, but since we have a live example in class today, I think it&#39;s the perfect opportunity for a practical demonstration.&quot; The class leaned in, some with curiosity, others with a hint of amusement.<br />
<br />
Jennifer felt her face burning as Miss Walters beckoned Cassie over with the stool and bucket. She swallowed hard, trying to ignore the sensation of her udders filling with milk. The furry wolf head on Cassie&#39;s midriff wagged its tails in excitement, and Jen had a sudden, irrational urge to just tell the truth about everything. But she knew that would be social suicide. So instead, she took a deep breath and sat down on the stool, her knees spread apart awkwardly.<br />
<br />
Miss Walters approached her, her human hands surprisingly gentle as she began to explain the milking process. Jen felt a mix of embarrassment and strange arousal as the class stared at her, their animal parts seemingly oblivious to the spectacle. The teacher&#39;s lion cock tongue slithered out of her mouth, already semi-erect as she spoke, and she had to keep swiping it aside to avoid drooling on her notes. &quot;Now, class, as you can see, Jen&#39;s udders are quite full. This is a sign that she&#39;s ready to be milked,&quot; she said, her voice taking on a clinical tone.<br />
<br />
Cassie took her place at the front, a look of determination in her human eyes. She picked up one of Jen&#39;s heavy udders, the wolf head on her stomach tilting up to sniff it curiously. &quot;Okay, Jen,&quot; Cassie murmured, trying to keep her voice steady. &quot;I&#39;m just going to squeeze like this.&quot; Her human hand wrapped around the base of one of the thick teats, and she began to gently squeeze and pull downwards. Jen bit her lip, her eyes watering at the sensation. The first stream of milk shot out, spraying a few students in the front row. They giggled and held up their notebooks to shield themselves, while the rest of the class watched in fascination.<br />
<br />
Miss Walters&#39; lion cock tongue grew harder, making it difficult for her to continue speaking. She took a step back, leaning against the desk as she tried to control herself. &quot;Ah, yes, quite the... natural process,&quot; she managed, her voice strained. The room was filled with the rhythmic sound of milk squelching into the bucket as Cassie milked Jen. The rest of the class took notes, seemingly unfazed by the sight before them.<br />
<br />
As the bucket began to fill, Jen felt her arousal grow. It was a weird sensation, being the center of attention in such a vulnerable way, but she couldn&#39;t help it. Her body was reacting to the situation. She looked down, watching the milk spurt out, feeling the relief as her udders emptied. The room was silent except for the occasional click of a pen on paper and the sound of her milk hitting the bottom of the bucket.<br />
<br />
When the last drop had been squeezed out, Cassie stepped back, her wolf head panting slightly. Jen felt drained yet oddly satisfied. The class clapped politely, and she managed a weak smile, her cheeks still flushed. Miss Walters cleared her throat, her cock tongue was fully erect now, making it impossible for her to speak without risking an accident. She gestured for Jen to stand, the bucket of milk sloshing in Cassie&#39;s grasp as they walked to the front of the room.<br />
<br />
Miss Walters took a deep breath, trying to compose herself. &quot;As you can see,&quot; she began, her voice cracking slightly, &quot;milking is an essential part of maintaining a cow&#39;s health. Now, let&#39;s discuss the... the... the... &quot; She couldn&#39;t hold it in any longer. Her cock tongue spasmed, and a thick rope of cum shot out of her mouth, splattering on the board behind her. The class gasped, not at the sudden display of fluid dynamics, but because they hadn&#39;t seen Miss Walters so flustered in a while. She tried to apologize but only managed to spray more jizz across the room with every attempt to form a word.<br />
<br />
Jen couldn&#39;t help but feel a smug satisfaction as she stepped off the stool, her udders now deflated. She knew she wasn&#39;t the only one who had to deal with weird stuff in this world. Miss Walters was usually so poised, so in control. It was almost refreshing to see her lose it like this.<br />
<br />
The class looked at each other, unsure how to react. Some snickered, some looked horrified, but most just scribbled notes in their books like nothing was out of the ordinary. &quot;Ah, yes,&quot; Miss Walters said, trying to regain her composure. &quot;As you can see, the body&#39;s response to stimulation can be quite... unexpected.&quot; She wiped her mouth with the back of her hand, smearing cum across her cheek.<br />
<br />
Miss Walters took a deep breath and grabbed a tissue from the box on her desk. She carefully cleaned herself up, her cock tongue slowly deflating as the awkward moment passed. It took all of Jen&#39;s willpower not to laugh at the sight of her usually unflappable teacher wiping cum off the board with a wet wipe.<br />
<br />
As the class continued to go on, Jen couldn&#39;t help but keep glancing around the room. Her classmates were all engrossed in their notes, some even sipping from the bucket of milk that Cassie had filled up from her udders. The sight was so absurd that it was almost mundane in this bizarre reality.<br />
<br />
Brad, the school&#39;s star quarterback, had a pair of antelope horns sticking out of his back, while a nerdy girl named Becky had a full set of squirrel tails and ears sticking out from her lower back. She saw that gender didn&#39;t seem to matter for the animal parts as she saw with Miss Walker. A girl had a cock of a stallion, which was visible through her tight shorts as she sat at her desk, playing with the furry tail that was sticking out of the back of her pants. Another boy had a pair of peacock feathers that grew from his shoulders, fluttering every time he moved.<br />
<br />
Jen sat back down in her chair, her mind swimming with questions she didn&#39;t dare to ask out loud. Why was she the only one who seemed to think this was strange? Why did everyone else just accept it? Was it because they had grown up with it, while she was thrown into it all at once?<br />
<br />
The bell finally rang, signaling the end of the biology class. Jen gathered her things, her udders feeling lighter now that they were empty. She made her way to her locker, her eyes scanning the hallways for any sign of Kyle. She needed to talk to him, to make him understand what he had done. But when she turned the corner, she saw him, surrounded by his friends, all of them laughing and joking.<br />
<br />
Kyle had a bear head replacing his left arm and his torso was a bear but reversed, his back was the bear&#39;s stomach. The rest of his body was extremely muscular, but his right arm remained human, making his physique look all the more bizarre. He was laughing at something one of his friends had said, not noticing Jen&#39;s approach. She felt a strange mix of anger and fear, knowing that she had to confront him. She took a deep breath and stormed over, pushing through the group of students.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle,&quot; she growled, her voice firm. The laughter died down immediately, and all eyes were on her. &quot;What the hell did you do to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle looked at her, his bear head arm hanging awkwardly at his side. &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; He genuinely seemed confused. &quot;Is this about last week&#39;s prank?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look I know taking your milking machine was wrong but I gave it back to you,&quot; Kyle said. Jen couldn&#39;t believe this, in this world Kyle had pranked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not that,&quot; Jen replied, trying to keep the frustration from her voice. &quot;It&#39;s... everything. The animal parts, the... the everything!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle&#39;s expression changed from confusion to concern. &quot;Jen, are you okay?&quot; His friends exchanged worried glances, clearly thinking she had snapped under the pressure of finals or something equally mundane. &quot;You&#39;re not still mad about the prank, are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen took a step closer, her udders swaying slightly. &quot;You don&#39;t remember calling me? Asking me to choose between &#39;Transform or Dare&#39;?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle&#39;s face palled and his friends ran away. &quot;Oh shit, Jen I&#39;m being honest with you I have no idea what you&#39;re saying&quot; Even Kyles left Bear&#39;s head looking upset.<br />
<br />
Jen realized with horror that this wasn&#39;t the Kyle she knew, not the one who had cursed her. This Kyle had no idea about the game, and her outburst had just painted a target on his back. She slapped her hand over her mouth, her eyes wide with fear. &quot;Too late,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Now you get both.&quot;</p>
