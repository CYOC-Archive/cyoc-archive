<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa and Ben are set to be married soon. They already live together in a house up in the country. Lisa was happy being with Ben, but there was only one shortcoming.<br />
<br />
Lisa was much taller than Ben. She was 6”4 and Ben was 5”. He also was extremely skinny and barely had any muscles. Lisa never told Ben but she wished he was taller.<br />
<br />
One day, Lisa saw an ad for growth supplements. They would make the consumer gain muscle mass and height, all in one day. Lisa decided to buy it for Ben.<br />
<br />
She received it a week later and she made sure Ben didn’t see it. He was in their room so Lisa made Ben a coffee.<br />
<br />
She put 1 pill in the coffee and it dissolved. Lisa brought it up to Ben and he happily drank it. He went to take a nap so Lisa went downstairs. The effects should take place soon.<br />
<br />
Lisas friend Amy had come to visit so she went to hang out with her downstairs. She told her about the supplements and they both hoped they’d work.<br />
<br />
Back in the room, Ben was asleep in nothing but his red underwear and the effects of the pills were happening. As he started growing. He gained almost 2 feet in height, he was now 6”10.<br />
<br />
He also gained more muscles. A six pack, bigger calves and biceps and ballooning pecs.<br />
<br />
His growth didn’t show any signs of stopping though. He kept growing and soon his bed couldn’t handle his weight and collapsed. His legs stretched from one side of the room to the other. His arms were being pushed against the wall.<br />
<br />
Amy and Lisa heard sounds upstairs and they thought Ben had woken up. Amy went upstairs to check on him.<br />
<br />
Ben had already filled up the room at that point. The moment Amy opened the door, his giant foot which was as tall as her, pushed her agains the wall in the hallway. <br />
<br />
The walls of the room were destroyed and Bens growth accelerated. His body continued to destroy the house. His legs along with Amy were pushed through the walls. His arms as well.<br />
<br />
Lisa was still downstairs. She looked up and saw the ceiling crack and break which was followed by a lot of red and then she was crushed.<br />
<br />
Ben had crashed into the first floor and squished Lisa. The house finally gave in to Bens growing body and got completely destroyed. <br />
<br />
Ben kept growing still. The roof of the house just rested on his crotch. Bens growth stopped and he started waking up. He looked around and saw he was in his underwear and the rubble of his house surrounding him. He was taller than the trees around him even sitting down.<br />
<br />
Amy had finally come to and looked up to see Ben. Ben asked her what happened and she told him about the growth supplements.<br />
<br />
Ben couldn’t see Lisa anywhere but then felt something under him. It was Lisa so he picked her up. He placed her on the roof.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Ben felt another growth spurt coming. He started growing again and this time so was his dick. He got a hard on and the roof along with Lisa was hoisted up in the air. His erection kept getting larger and larger. He also kept on growing in size.<br />
<br />
The roof of his house perfectly fitted on his tip now. He carefully picked it up and placed it on his nipple. He could see the tiny Lisa. Ben then started rubbing his erection and almost immediately came. Cum sprayed through his underwear almost everywhere. <br />
<br />
Lisa finally woke up and looked around, she was on the roof of her house which was on a gigantic nipple. She looked up and saw Ben, absolutely gigantic. That was from 1 pill? Lisa couldn’t imagine if he had gotten a larger dosage. Speaking of supplements, Lisa still had the little box with her.<br />
<br />
After coming, Ben was still hard. His growth had stopped but he still wanted more. He looked at his nipple and saw Lisa waving at him. He picked her up with on finger and brought her to his face. Lisa wasn’t expecting this, and ended up dropping the box into his mouth.<br />
<br />
Lisa was worried what would happen. Her soon to be husband was already as big as a mountain from 1 pill. If he ate the entire box, god knows what would happen.<br />
<br />
And then it’s started again, Bens growth. He expanded in every direction. His underwear also gave in and snapped off. Ben carefully placed Lisa on the tip of his dick. It it itself was probably as big as a foot ball stadium. She had the perfect view of his growth.<br />
<br />
His body completely demolished the surrounding areas. Cities were crushed instantly. Lisa could feel his body getting bigger, she could see the lines in his skin getting bigger and bigger. She eventually fell in between them and she couldn’t see anything going on anymore.<br />
<br />
Ben was hard throughout his growing. He kept rubbing his dick and coming over and over again. He was already as big as a continent. Then he was as big as the planet. Ben penetrated the earth with his dick and came inside the core. Soon it was smaller than a coin to him. He shoved it into his penis hole. He went to other planets bigger than earth. But he immediately outgrew them and he shoved them through his dick hole.<br />
<br />
The sun was next. Ben was as big as it but soon he was bigger. He rubbed his dick and came all over the sun and extinguished it. He then outgrew the solar system. He continued his growth. He outgrew almost all the celestial beings. He was even too big for a black hole. <br />
<br />
He then hit his head on something. And then he started getting cramped. It was like outgrowing a room again. But once he broke through, he was somewhere else. It was all white, and he looked up and saw other big and strong guys much bigger than him. They didn’t notice him but he was still growing so he would soon catch up to them.<br />
<br />
Lisa had wanted Ben to be big, and she got her wish and then some.</p>
