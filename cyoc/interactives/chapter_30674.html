<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On that note the three of us made our wishes silently.  We all wished that as we massaged the boys they would slowly turn into attractive, buxom females and that they would be in too much pleasure to care or notice what was happening to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll take care of you,&quot; Rachel said as she began to rub Mike's back and shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're mine,&quot; stated Kim as she reached for Brad.<br />
<br />
I acted like I was disappointed and said to Steve, &quot;Guess that leaves you for me.&quot;  He looked like he took me seriously.  &quot;I was just kidding, sweetie,&quot; I said to reassure him.  His expression quickly changed again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, this is going to be a full body massage,&quot; Rachel said.  &quot;And I do mean full body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you think we need,&quot; Mike chortled.  <br />
<br />
Rachel said something that Mike must have been thinking.  &quot;Don't worry, we save the best for the last.&quot;<br />
<br />
We had worked out a very specific pattern for their changes.  We'd get them to relax a little just by rubbing their backs and shoulders.  Then we'd start at their feet and work our way up.  It didn't hurt that we had also wished we'd have the skills of an expert masseuse, so getting them to relax on their tables was no tough task.  <br />
<br />
&quot;We're gonna start at the bottom and go up,&quot; I said so that they would be less likely to fidget as we started on their feet.  The three of them were resting on their tables and weren't looking at us as we started to rub their male feet.  Rachel, Kim and I shared knowing glances and winked at each other.  As we thoroughly rubbed their feet the changes began very quickly.  Their feet all began to shrink in size.  They grew both smaller and thinner.  Their toes changed as well.  I lifted up Steve's legs a little to look at his toenails and found they had acquired a layer of purple nail-polish.  Rachel's and Kim's victims were changing similarly.<br />
<br />
With their feet having been changed we moved up to their ankles and then to their legs as a whole.  Again their pars thinned and reshaped themselves into feminine shape.  Their legs did retain evidence of being supremely fit, just as we hoped they would.  They seemed to lose a slight bit of length, presumably to make them shorter overall in their female versions.  They weren't moving at all as we did this.  They were definitely overcome thanks to our wish.  At a few points I could hear them sighing and moaning with content.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time to give you what you want,&quot; Rachel said as she moved up to Mike's hips and ass.  She pressed her fingers down into Mike's rock hard, muscular behind and soon felt it getting softer, fuller, and much more supple in her hands.  &quot;Does this feel as good for you as it does for me?&quot; she asked him while doing her best to contain a laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don't stop,&quot; he said.  &quot;Your fingers are magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim laughed.  &quot;If you only knew,&quot; she said.  All three of the boys just chuckled.  Good, I thought, they're not thinking the least bit is wrong.  <br />
<br />
I found myself having a slightly harder time with Steve.  The more I looked at his naked body, the harder my nipples became.  I was worried that I might start to feel moist and damp between my legs.  I wanted to wish myself to not react, but decided not to do that.  Something inside me told me I had to know how I was going to react in this body.  Besides, I just reminded myself of what an asshole he'd been to me for a long time.  I did like putting my hands all over his skin, and also liked that I could feel the changes when he could not, however.<br />
<br />
We finished rounding out their now feminine asses and expanded their hips to curvy shapes.  &quot;This part might hurt a little,&quot; Kim warned.  &quot;You might feel a slight pinch in your breathing.&quot;  Our hands moved up to their waists, which promptly contracted several inches.<br />
<br />
All three of them did breathe in sharply.  &quot;Thanks...for the warning,&quot; Brad said in between short, abbreviated breaths.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't mention it,&quot; Kim said.  &quot;I'm just hoping it gets me a better tip.&quot;  Everyone laughed at Kim's offhand remark.<br />
<br />
When I finished with Steve's waist, I took a few seconds to admire what a lovely hourglass figure he now sported.  We said &quot;buxom&quot; in our wishes.  It certainly looked like our gifts weren't disappointing again.<br />
<br />
We moved next to their shoulders, which narrowed and thinned just as their waistlines had.  After their shoulders were done, we moved down to their arms and hands, which changed much as their legs and feet had changed.  Their fingernails all extended out and acquired a polish color that matched their toenails.  Steve's was purple, Brad's was red, and Mike's was pink.  A part of me smiled that the most &quot;macho&quot; one of them was getting the most girly color.<br />
<br />
Next we had to move onto our first truly challenging part of this process.  This was really going to test the power of the wishes.  We all began to run our hands over their heads.  It didn't take long for the hair on them to start growing out.  In Brad's case, his hair didn't need to grow much longer, but it developed a rich fullness that made his locks appear brighter.  In the case of Mike and Steve, however, their was a definite growing out of their shortly cut hair.  Their hair grew longer and fuller beneath our fingers.  We had to do our best to make sure that our fingers wouldn't get tangled among the lengthening locks.<br />
<br />
Our three victims were now female on one side.  But now the more difficult side remained.  This is where the most dramatic changes would occur.  &quot;OK,&quot; I said.  &quot;We're done on this side.  Time for you to flip!&quot;<br />
<br />
The boys looked at each other somewhat nervously.  They must have known they were about to show us something rather embarrassing.  They dutifully got off the beds, which gave their longer hairstyles a change to bounce against their backs and shoulders.  They did not even bat an eye at this, however.  I was satisfied in knowing that the wish was working perfectly.<br />
<br />
Sure enough the three of them were all sporting erections.  Now I was never one to know how big a guy's cock was &quot;supposed&quot; to be, so I couldn't tell you if they were big or small.  All I knew was that the way they looked now, they appeared capable of satisfying any woman alive.  I did my best to prevent my eyes from going wide at the sight.  My nipples were probably hard enough to cut someone's skin open, and I did feel a warmth in my pussy.<br />
<br />
I took control of the situation as quickly as I could.  &quot;OK, lie on your backs,&quot; I instructed them.  They did just as quickly as they could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, about...uh...&quot; Steve stammered.  &quot;I mean...y-you're not...&quot;<br />
<br />
I raised my hand to stop him.  &quot;Don't worry, honey,&quot; I said.  &quot;It's not the first I've seen, either.&quot;  He smiled out of one side of his mouth, not sure if he was supposed to laugh or feel more uncomfortable.  &quot;Let's put those facial muscles at ease,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
Rachel and Kim had already started to smoothen the faces of Mike and Brad.  Their skin was becoming totally blemish free.  At the same time their cheeks were rounding and their chins softening.  Their noses grew smaller and their lips fuller.  Rachel particularly seemed to enjoy changing Mike's face.  He also had a goatee which receded into his face in a matter of seconds.  Their body hair had also receded as we'd moved over their individual parts.<br />
<br />
By the time we were finished with their faces, they were all drop dead gorgeous.  If they were seen only from the chin up, any man would immediately lust for them.  We then slid our hands down to their necks and throats.  Their Adam's apples vanished from sight.  As we did this they all had to clear their throats a few times.  They did not notice that the pitch of their voices was raising to feminine levels.<br />
<br />
The only things that remained were their chests, stomachs, and cocks, which were still fully at attention.  We worked on their stomachs next.  Their six-packs all softened, but their stomachs remained fit and flat, just as we hoped.  Only the two most drastic changes remained now.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you all enjoying it so far?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking awesome!&quot; Mike said in a voice much too high in pitch to have said something as crude as that.  Rachel quickly stifled a laugh at the sound.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wonderful,&quot; said Brad in a voice dripping with honey.  It was smooth and soft, with a dream like quality.<br />
<br />
Steve nodded and said, &quot;This has been incredible.&quot;  His voice was very smooth and calming.<br />
<br />
I smiled and said, &quot;We're not done just yet.&quot;  With no hesitation I placed my hands over his chest and worked at them furiously.  Rachel and Kim followed suit on their counterparts.  Their pecs all softened and receded, just as the rest of their muscles had.  Before too long they were unremarkably flat-chested, with no definition to be found.  It didn't stay that way for long as their nipples and areola increased in size.  In just under a minute small buds were pushing out from their chests.  After a few more seconds they all had conical-shaped, A-cup breasts.  A couple more seconds of our rubbing passed and their breasts began to fill out and round.  Their nipples were being pushed further and further away from their chests as their breasts swelled and expanded to the proportions we had wished.  C-cups pushed out into D-cups, and then finally into massive DD-cups for all three of them.  They all looked real and spectacular.  I admired Steve's impressive bust and felt slightly jealous.  His were a little bigger than mine.<br />
<br />
Now came the time for the last change.  But first we had to do something else.  We walked over to the counter and the three of us each coated our hands in some kind of lotion.  The three of them looked at us somewhat confused.  &quot;We don't call this place 'Happy Endings' for nothing,&quot; Rachel said as she winked at them.  Their looks of confusion changed to dumb grins.  If only they knew what their faces looked like, I thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now,&quot; I said, &quot;we need to you all to close your eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Mike said, appearing somewhat upset.<br />
<br />
Before he got a chance to argue, Kim said, &quot;Oh, I just wish you guys will close your eyes like we ask.&quot;  It came out so fast that she didn't even realize what she had said until it was done.<br />
<br />
However, that was the best thing she could have done, for all three of them said in unison, &quot;OK,&quot; and closed their eyes and put their heads down flat on the beds.  <br />
<br />
To make sure that nothing else could happen during this, I added, &quot;And I wish you won't open your eyes until we say so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK,&quot; they all replied again.<br />
<br />
Kim and Rachel took this opportunity to wish themselves back to their normal appearances.  I also made the wish that they would now remember me as always having been a female.  When the changes were becoming apparent on the two of them, we nodded at each other and wrapped our hands around their cocks.  Instantly they moaned with pleasure.  I was afraid that a mess would shortly ensue, so I wished that no matter how badly they might need to, they would not climax as we did this.  Something told me that Kim and Rachel did the same thing.<br />
<br />
We massaged their cocks as lovingly and tender as we had the rest of their bodies.  It took only a few seconds for their proud members to lose first their stiffness and then their size and girth.  Now we had the opportunity to grin like a trio of idiots as we watched our hands reform their cocks.  Their cocks became very small, probably no bigger than that of a very young boy.  We stopped massaging their cocks briefly and started to rub their testicles.  They emptied and then pulled back to their groins.  The empty sac split apart and took place on either side of their tiny cocks.  Their pussies formed and opened, and awaited us to complete the process.  We rubbed on their cocks again and they soon shriveled completely and disappeared inside their virgin pussies.  To be certain the change would finish, we placed our fingers inside of them and continued to rub until we felt safe knowing the task was completed.<br />
<br />
Kim and Rachel were now back to their normal bodies.  We stepped back from our victims for a moment and admired the combined effort of our wish and our gifts that made it possible.  We scurried to pick up our robes and put them back on.  Even though they had seen me naked, they didn't actually know who I was.  Kim and Rachel didn't want to be exposed to them, however.  We also wished that the robes would be longer so that accidental exposure would be prevented.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, boys,&quot; I said.  I had to stifle a laugh now myself, as they were anything but boys at this point.  &quot;I wish you could open your eyes and sit up now.&quot;<br />
<br />
They did so in a split second.  &quot;I know that voice,&quot; Steve said.  He caught sight of the three of us smiling back at him.  &quot;Jo?  Kim?  Rachel?&quot;  We just nodded at him as we continued to smile at him.  &quot;What the fuck is going on here?&quot;<br />
<br />
We laughed.  &quot;Who wants to tell them?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, ooh, me!&quot; Rachel exclaimed.  I gestured for her to go ahead.  &quot;I wish you three would all now realize what has happened to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Our three victims all shook their heads violently for a few seconds.  Then they felt certain differences in their bodies.  They all stood up from the beds, looked at their bodies and the bodies of each other and screamed at the top of their lungs.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck have you done to us?&quot; yelled Mike.</p>
