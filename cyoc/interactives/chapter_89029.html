<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jessica&#39;s aunt had passed away a few months ago and in her will she had left the house to her as she was her only surviving family member. Jessica&#39;s father had died when her mother was pregnant and her mother died in birthing her so Jessica had lived in foster homes until she was 18 when she left for college. She could have lived with her aunt but she was deemed an unsuitable carer.<br />
<br />
All Jessica knew about her aunt was that she was an ex burlesque dancer. So she wouldn&#39;t have been very interested in living with her had she been given the chance. Yet she was grateful enough to have been given everything she owned.<br />
<br />
Jessica fumbled with the keys for a minute before she opened the door. She stepped inside to find a note on the ground in front of the door. Jessica picked it up and read it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear Jessica. <br />
If you are reading this then I am dead and have given you my house. I hope you enjoy your inheritance. I&#39;ve given you all you could need to live here, furniture, utilities, electronics, even some of my old clothes though I doubt they&#39;ll fit you. Lets just say I was always quite a big girl. <br />
Though what I hope you enjoy most I a surprise I&#39;ve left for you, you&#39;ll figure it out eventually, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.<br />
I&#39;m sorry I was never there for you Jess but I&#39;m hoping this makes up for it.<br />
Your aunt Eve.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica put the note down and explored the house for a minute. Everything her aunt had said she&#39;d left for her was there. She checked the bedroom and opened the closet, inside were tons of clothes, she pulled some out and tried them on. Her aunt had been a big girl it seemed, the clothes were absolutely huge on her especially around her chest and rear.<br />
<br />
She looked through all of the clothes to see if there was anything she could wear. There were a few corsets that were the right size but that was all. She did however check the make-up table. Everything was perfect for her, she had only ever seen pictures of her aunt&#39;s face and had noticed how similar they both looked. Especially in skin tone and facial features. She had received letters from her aunt telling her how she was on her side of the family for looks but her mothers side for body, basically she was calling Jessica flat, bit she knew it was true.<br />
<br />
Jessica decided to keep the corsets but put all the other clothes in the attic for now in case she ever grew Into them which she doubted would ever happen. <br />
<br />
She went about the rest of her day relaxing as she didn&#39;t have to sort anything out, it was all already sorted for her: WiFi, electricity, water and gas bills were all paid for for the next ten years apparently giving Jessica alot of spending money to buy whatever she wanted.<br />
<br />
As she was going about her day however she kept feeling this burning sensation whenever she ate or drank anything she ignored it for the most part though and just went off to bed  at the end of the day.<br />
<br />
<br />
When Jessica woke up she felt an unordinary weight on her chest she looked down to see a pair of small almost flat breasts on her chest, they were barely noticeable through her shirt bit they were definitely there. Jessica thought it strange but didn&#39;t pay it much attention so she sat up. She found a note on her bedside table that hadn&#39;t been there the night before. So she picked it up and read it.<br />
<br />
Dear Jessica<br />
You may have noticed some small changes to your body, don&#39;t worry they&#39;ll get bigger. You may have also noticed some changes to your wardrobe, If not go check&quot;<br />
Jessica got up and opened the closet, sure enough there were all the clothes from yesterday but a smaller size in order to fit her.<br />
Jessica went and read the rest of the note.<br />
&quot;Jessica I wasn&#39;t only a burlesque dancer, I was also a witch. Not a bad one, like the one from wizard of oz, a good one. But I&#39;m dead now, well undead. I&#39;m a ghost, in fact I live In this house. And I&#39;ve cursed you so you will slowly, but surely look exactly like me when I was your age. If you look down there&#39;s a picture.&quot;<br />
That was all the note said but a second later a picture appeared on the page, Jessica assumed it was her aunt.<br />
<br />
The woman was big to say the least she had extremely large breasts and ass, and also a small stomach to say the least. The woman did however look a lot like Jessica from above the neck, except form her hair which was dyed a bright pink.<br />
<br />
Jessica was shocked, she tried to leave the house, even when she put her keys in the door it wouldn&#39;t open. She sat on her bed crying, she didn&#39;t want to be fat, she had always loved her skinny frame.<br />
She ran into the bathroom and stripped off of all her clothes. She checked her entire body. Beside her breasts both her ass and stomach had expanded slightly and her hair was a slightly lighter colour, only borderline black.<br />
<br />
She was so scared.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going to happen next&quot; she said to herself.</p>
