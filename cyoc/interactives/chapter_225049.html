<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To Mad Moxie, it&#39;s okay. ;]<br />
<br />
Nancy was a bit upset that Charlotte had slept through the whole day as a cat girl. But as an owner of a cat herself, even she knows how lazy cats can get. So between the various programming that she has to do for her work, Nancy added another code to make sure that there wouldn&#39;t be another chance for Charlotte to sleep past the day. It wasn&#39;t until Nancy got home that she received her feline friend&#39;s text messages about how sorry she slept the day away. Nancy replied with a text back stating that it was okay and that don&#39;t do it again.<br />
<br />
Fast-forward to the dawning of day 2, Nancy was woken up by not her alarm clock but her phone. Willing to look at the glaring screen of her phone to see who the caller ID was showed that it was Charlotte. Seeing her name flash across her phone woke Nancy up a little more and she answered it. &quot;(yawning) Hello Char-,&quot; were the only words that Nancy said before she was rudely interrupted by Charlotte&#39;s frantic voice.<br />
&quot;Nancy! Oh my god, you would not believe what happened to me when I woke up this morning! I was lying in bed, still surrounded by my massive amount of fur. But it wasn&#39;t FUR!! Instead, the hair on the top of my head grew out of control. It seems that not only the nanomachines have taken everything from my brief time as a cat girl, but also all the hair below my head. God damn it, my legs and arms feel so smooth!&quot;<br />
<br />
Curious about how much hair Charlotte has gained overnight, Nancy asked her panicking friend to Facetime her to see how long it is. If she manages to find a word in edgewise. Once Charlotte received the message, she hung up and immediately called back via Facetime. &quot;What the ...&quot; and then Nancy burst out laughing at the bizarreness of her friend on her screen. &quot;What? Why are you laughing?&quot; Nancy laughed a bit more until she had a chance to reply to Charlotte. &quot;Dude, you look like Cousin Itt from the Addams Family.&quot; and then laughed yet again when she faced the camera once more.<br />
Sure enough, Charlotte&#39;s gigantic amount of hair that flowed down from her head does resemble the character from the movies and shows. It also doesn&#39;t help that Charlotte&#39;s natural hair color is similar to the famous cousin&#39;s, brown. All she has to do is to get a pair of sunglasses and a hat and she will be ready for the Addams family reunions.<br />
&quot;Not funny Nancy. There is so much hair around me that I may need a dozen hairstylists to get it under control.&quot; After laughing a few minutes more, Nancy calmed down enough to address the elephant in the room. Or for Charlotte&#39;s case, the mammoth in the room. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Charlotte, I&#39;ll help you out. I tell you what, you try to get yourself ready and I will bring someone to come over to help you out.&quot; The living hairball moved and turned about as if Charlotte was nodding her head. &quot;Okay, just make sure that it is someone that we can trust.&quot; <br />
<br />
A few hours later, Nancy and her plus-one arrived at Charlotte&#39;s home. Standing outside the door with her tools in hand, the dark-skinned woman looks annoyed being out.&quot;It&#39;s better to be a good reason to wake me up on my day off Nancy. And why are we at your friend&#39;s house.&quot; Nancy rang the doorbell by the door and looked back at her friend that she dragged over here. &quot;Let me just say that I brought you over here because you always asked for a challenge whenever we meet.&quot; Before the friend had a chance to question her friend&#39;s choice of words, she could hear noises behind the door and then it opened.<br />
&quot;Quickly, come inside!&quot; said the towering pile of hair with two smooth arms coming out of it. Nancy pulled her gobsmacked friend inside the house, to which the latter of the two became aware of the pool of hair that extended behind its owner. &quot;Roxie, this is my friend Charlotte, who is having slight hair problems. Charlotte, this is my hairstylist Roxie. She will help you out on how to maintain that mane.&quot; <br />
<br />
When Nancy finished introducing the two ladies, Charlotte the Wookiee, grew slightly annoyed that the near-endless amount of hair was just a &quot;slight hair problem&quot;. As for the pudgy hairstylist, Roxie just stared at her potential customer. After such a pregnant pause that everyone thinks that Roxie has just died, she slowly approaches Charlotte to consider how to handle it. &quot;Do you mind if I ...?&quot; Roxie asked permission from Charlotte. &quot;Knock yourself out but I am going to sit on my couch if you don&#39;t mind.&quot; As such, the pillar of fuzz moved toward the couch in the middle of the living room, with a trail of hair following right behind.<br />
The Latina bent down to grasp a few strands of her client&#39;s hair, feeling how thick it was. &quot;Amazing! It feels so silky smooth and there is so much volume in it too. What product do you use for it?&quot; Nancy spoke up to answer the loaded question. &quot;It&#39;s a product from my workplace. Unfortunately, Charlotte is the only one who received the prototype. While yes, her hair is gorgeous to look at and touch, the problem now is that it leads to an unprecedented amount of hair growth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, and if I guess that by cutting a little bit off?&quot; To which Roxie took out her pair of scissors and cut a strand of Charlotte&#39;s hair off. Everyone in the room stared at where Roxie cut the hair off. Like watching fast forward, the area that was cut grew back to its regular size. &quot;You think I haven&#39;t tried that!&quot; Charlotte yelled at the hairstylist. &quot;The damn thing won&#39;t stay short no matter how much I cut off. There are three trash bags full of hair that I cut off before I called Nancy, and they are not the small kinds!&quot; The two ladies looked around and did find the three bags of hair in the bathroom. &quot;Well, let&#39;s get started on pulling your hair back so that you can see better.&quot; While Roxie began to fust around with Charlotte&#39;s biggest feature of the day, Nancy took out her phone and started to type down some more notes.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Not only did the nanomachines manage to completely transition Charlotte&#39;s cat girl appearance from yesterday back to her normal form again, but the newest change made sure that her hair would stay in its newer, longer state. The fact that a licensed hairstylist can confirm how rich and thick the hair is means that if I can isolate the programming in the nanomachines, I can give it to people who want to regrow their lost hair or revitalize it. Granted, I do need to terminate the amount of growth before handing it out to the masses. We don&#39;t need everyone to become Rapunzels.&quot;<br />
<br />
A couple of hours later, and a few of Roxie&#39;s tools breaking, Charlotte is no more a walking wig. Instead, Roxie forces Charlotte&#39;s wild hair into submission and makes them into thick, tight braids that wrap around themselves so that they no longer dragging on the floor. &quot;So, what do you think?&quot; Roxie, being worn out from the endeavor of making Charlotte&#39;s braids, fell into the nearby chair due to being taken through the ringer. &quot;It&#39;s perfect. Thank you Roxie, huh?&quot; Charlotte looked over where the hairstylist was lying and saw that she had fallen asleep.<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s a good thing that I don&#39;t have work today,&quot; Nancy said as she walked over to Charlotte and sat next to her. &quot;Don&#39;t you have work to do?&quot; Charlotte&#39;s joy was shattered by the realization that she may miss out on work for two days in a row. &quot;Crap, what time is it!&quot; Nancy pulled out her phone. &quot;It&#39;s almost 1 pm.&quot; &quot;Double crap!&quot; Charlotte then zoomed out of her seat and went to her bedroom to find her forgotten phone and to get ready for work.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about this Charlotte,&quot; Nancy announced to the air while she still sitting on the couch. &quot;I will pull some strings from my work so that you have an excuse to not attend work. It could be that you are in a study group or that we are researching you for a paper. That way we can keep doing our bet while you won&#39;t be in trouble.&quot; Charlotte rushed past her friend again and said, &quot;That sounds good. Can you do that, please? Oh, and can you take out the bags of hair on your way out too? I would do it but I am running late.&quot;<br />
Nancy agreed to do it while the hairy boulder of an updo kept on rushing about until she left her home for work, slamming the door loud enough to wake up Roxie. &quot;What happens? Where did my Godiva go?&quot; Nancy got up from her seat and walked over to the confused Latina. &quot;She left to get to work. Don&#39;t worry, I will pay you for not only the service but also for your tools.&quot; Roxie was upset that she didn&#39;t have the chance to say goodbye to her. &quot;Do you think that you could bring her to my salon, I wanted to show her off to my co-workers.&quot; Nancy lugged the heavy bags of hair that Charlotte had cut off to the front of the house. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know that&#39;s the reason why her hair is that long. It was because the product that did it was a temporary effect. I&#39;m sure that by tomorrow, Charlotte will no longer be the record holder of the world&#39;s longest hair.&quot; Roxie was stunned to hear that as she made her way to the door. &quot;So you mean to say that Charlotte will be bald tomorrow?&quot; Nancy finally got the last bag of hair past the doorpost and replied to Roxie&#39;s concern. &quot;Let me just say that Charlotte is hair today, gone tomorrow.&quot; And then she closed the door behind her and locked it up for Charlotte.</p>
