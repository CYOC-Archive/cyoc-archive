<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;It will be, because it&#39;s a day off. Be a mannequin at home!&quot; Douglas says happily. Quinn sighs in relief, &quot;Thank goodness.&quot; He then blushes after the thought of his lower body being naked after his shift. Douglas can tell by his blushing and asks, &quot;You like the feeling of showing you black plastic naked body huh?&quot; he smugs as well. Quinn, feeling flustered replies, &quot;Wh-What?! No! Y-you got it wrong! I... I...&quot; He darts his eyes hoping to find an answer. Douglas laughs, &quot;Haha! It&#39;s cool man. Anyways, I&#39;ll check out that warehouse full of those featureless mannequins that cursed you that way for instructions tomorrow after my work tomorrow.&quot; Quinn thinks it is a good idea and decides to head to the back as his brother finishes closing up.<br />
<br />
Quinn waits on his bike, holding his brother&#39;s as Douglas exits and locks the backdoor and pedal their way back home as they talked about some random stuff.<br />
<br />
The next day, Quinn looks at the clock on his wall and only has less than ten minutes before he goes back to his featureless mannquin state. Douglas, who lives across the hall knocks on his door. &quot;Come in!&quot; Douglas opens the door and peaks his head out. &quot;Hey, Quinn, I just wanna apologize the other day about pantsing you.&quot; Quinn sighs.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright bro. Just don&#39;t do it again, or if you run out of options for clothes, put me in a private room to take the clothes off of me and get me another one. Otherwise, leave me there until I can move again after five.&quot; Douglas let out an embarrassed chuckle, &quot;I&#39;ll try to remember that.&quot; He then asks him something else, &quot;So anything you want me to do after I go to work?&quot;<br />
<br />
Quinn wanted to record his changes and see it from the camera&#39;s view, &quot;Yeah, can you get me a camera? I want to see myself change in a different perspective.&quot; Douglas nods and ducks his head back out until Quinn called him back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doug, wait!&quot; Douglas peaks his head back into Quinn&#39;s room as he confesses about yesterday and blushes, &quot;Y-you maybe right about me wanting to be naked as a featureless plastic mannequin...&quot; Douglas chuckles as Quinn tells him his plan after five, &quot;I&#39;m going to test out my theory if it is true of me not having my flesh and blood back.&quot; He nods and goes off to get the cameras for Quinn.<br />
<br />
Five minutes left, Douglas said goodbye to Quinn as he returned his goodbye. Douglas then closes the front door and locks it and bikes his way to his work. Naked, Quinn goes back to his room and stands in front in one of the cameras, now recording as he waits for his inevitable change.<br />
<br />
The clock now strikes nine as he looks down and sees a patch of deep black plastic on his left arm and some on his hand and slowly spreads, his genitals soon become a shiny deep black plastic bulge (a bit bigger than the standard mannequins he was along sides with) as he groans in pleasure as the plastic too spreads from there. His asshole seals up as the same color of plastic spreads there too, now fully changed his crotch and ass area as it now spreads up and down his body. Quinn&#39;s changes increases as more appear on his chest, stomach, and back and spreads. His muscles soon becomes reduced to smooth black and featureless plastic, but shows some to very little evidence of a six pack. He then groans as his mouth seals up and lets out his last muffled groan before it smooths away, his nose and ears too smoothed away and can only smell plastic, and his hearing is muffled. Hair soon disappears leaving him bald as plastic too takes over his head and his eyes seal up and smooth as well leaving a faceless head of deep black plastic of a man that is forced to look straight to the camera, but not forcing him to dart his mental eyes as it spreads to his remaining flesh to finish his change. As a bonus before he started changing, he brought a full length mirror and placed it in front of him beside the camera, just in case he wants to see his change through a mirror, and it did startle him how he is becoming a faceless and featureless freak just standing there. His deep black plastic fingers, fingernails gone, soon merge into one, saving his thumbs as they become featureless plastic mitts as his feet soon follows as the last of his skin color become deep black like his plastic body qnd his toes merge into one and smooth away as both his hands and feet no longer have any evidence of fingers or toes as the changes complete itself as the last remaining flesh is changed to plastic and now hollow on the inside as he wobbles last time for the duration of his curse.<br />
<br />
Half way through the duration, Douglas apologized to the community store manager the father complained to and to the reasonable dad for his mistake and promises it won&#39;t happen, and continues his work shift. Meanwhile, back at their house, Quinn mentally groans realizing he should&#39;ve turned on a radio or tv to listen to something for the last half hours of his duration, but no, he has silence and muffled sounds from the outside world as his faceless head continues to stare straight and darts his mental eyes for something to look at. Suddenly, his gaze meets his featureless mannequin reflection in the mirror. It feels so strange, yet, awesome to be this way. He doesn&#39;t know why, but it does. He then thinks to himself, &lt;Maybe staring at my featureless mannequin self will help kill time.&gt;<br />
<br />
In fact it does, away from his view, the clock says 4;42 PM as he then looks left and right to the camera and mirror and manages to deal w/ this silence... Quinn knows his mind will forever be intact during his curse as it was stated on the paper he read in that warehouse of featureless mannequins a day or two ago, but he is starting to like his featureless self. Two minutes left to test his theory and he can wriggle his mittens and toeless feet. He wobbles a bit realizing a portion of his curse is almost over. Finally, it strikes two and his body moves as he falls back and lets a silent gasp hitting the floor. He then sits up and looks down on his mannequin self but doesn&#39;t show any signs of turning back. &lt;Just as I thought. I don&#39;t fully turn back.&gt; He mentally says as gets up and ends the recording.<br />
<br />
Quinn the stands in front of the mirror to look at his featureless self again as he can&#39;t help it and stares up and down his plastic body. He then taps his chest and hear a hollow sound from inside him with his right mitten hand and then claps his mittens together as it makes a different tone. &lt;I think I may be like this for awhile...&gt;<br />
<br />
Back at the store, he closes up for the day and bikes to the cursed abandoned mannequin warehouse at the edge of town. However, he wanted to check on Quinn and see how he is doing before going. And maybe ask him to come with him. Or ask their friend to go with him and find some clues.</p>
