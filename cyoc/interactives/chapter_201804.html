<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenn showed Rex his favorite ball before tossing it to the other side of the room, and Rex run after it, ass held high. His body was human shaped, but for his mistress had recognized it, his hidden desire to be treated like a dog he was mentally. He wagged his whole behind to let his tail move a bit, and hit the ball with his left paw, for it to roll around. That way, he slowly brought it back to his mistress. <br />
Rick was helplessly watching his body making something so embarrassing. He wasn´t a dog, dammit. He also was disgusted at how submissive his body acted towards this girl.<br />
When Jenn picked it up, he petted Rex head. “Good boy. Who is my good little puppy?”<br />
Rex, while his cock throbbed within its cage like before, mostly ignored it. Another part of his changed name was his higher tolerance for his need for release. At the same time, the puppy, while sapping his strength, also eased his desire to get horny. After all, a young puppy like he was wouldn´t be as active as an older, more mature dog with his cock.<br />
So, to answer his mistress, Rex answered a bit shyly: “Me, mistress”<br />
Jenn petted him a little more, saying: “Yes, you are, Rex. You are my good boy. And do you know what good boys do id asked something, huh? They don´t speak human words, but “Bark” like a proper dog. Now, are you a good boy, Rex?”<br />
Rex felt the shudder run through him, but didn´t really acknowledge it. Instead, he wanted to be a good boy, so without a thought he did as he would normally do, at least after the command had taken effect. “Woof woof” he barked, and wagged his ass like before.<br />
Rick was horrified at that. Had she just taken his voice from him? Would he, if he got his control back, be stuck with barking? <br />
Jenn petted him again, before throwing the ball again. Rex run after, and slowly rolled it back. They continued for another three rounds, before Jenn acknowledged the light problem for Rex. “Now Rex, how about a reward for being such a good boy? Sit.”<br />
Rex promptly did sit down on his haunches, eagerly rubbing his ass over the carpet in an attempt to make his tail wag while sitting. Calmly, Jenn took something out of her bag, which stood by the door, and presented it to Rex. It was a hood, resembling a dog´s muzzle, strapped to the back of the head. It also had dog-ears on top, which had built-in microphones, more sensible than normal human hearing would be. They connected to little speakers inside the hood, fitting for the ears of the wearer.<br />
Rex calmly waited as his mistress placed the hood over his head, making sure the speakers where in his ears, while the muzzle connected to his mouth. It would work like an extension of his mouth, as it would open and close as he did that with his mouth. His nose smelled the light rubbery smell of the inside of the muzzle. To anyone looking, it was a full muzzle, and that would cover the nose as well. With everything in place, Jenn fixed the hood in position, making it look mostly natural. The whole hood was covered in the same brown fake-fur as the rest of his suit, fitting nicely to the overall picture of a dog. The only naked part of the hood was around the eyes. <br />
She had to stop. How would he ever have any dignity again if someone saw Rick right now? He would never live this down. <br />
Jenn again petted Rex, stroking his “fur” a bit along his sides. “You are a really good boy, aren´t you, Rex. Now you look just like a real dog would, a “Natural” one.”<br />
Rex didn´t know what had changed with that shudder, but he happily barked at his mistress calling him a good boy again. He loved being praised. To Rex, his hood was now seen as normal, as being part of him. He also now knew how to work with it, as was soon seen by him grabbing the thrown ball with his muzzle. <br />
After another few rounds of throwing the ball for Rex, Jenn decided on finishing her pet puppy Rex now. “Come here, Rex. I have another little present for you?”<br />
“Not another object to degrade me, you bitch” Rick mentally screamed, not that he would be heard by anyone. Not even his own body under the control of “Rex” could hear him. He could hear her giggling at him, and felt her petting his head again.<br />
Jenn produced a collar for Rex from her bag, showing it to him before fixing it around his neck, making him shiver once. She took an extra second to show him the key next to the dog-tag, knowing that while Rex didn´t know what it was, Rick would. “There, Rex, now we are ready to move out. I wouldn´t want you to be mistaken for a stray, would I? And it added a more permanent solution to your commands. As long as my good boy wear his collar, he will remain my good boy, right? But to be safe, let´s “Hide” it, okay?” It only affected Rick on the inside, Rex would know he wears his collar.<br />
Rex, happy about his collar, barked happily for his mistress, gaining another few scratched behind his ears. Rick, at the same time, curses loudly in his mind. What had this witch done to him? And she had placed the key to his locked-up cage with his collar, just to tease him further. When the “hide”-command took effect, Rick forgot the collar was there. It and the key were invisible to him, both physically as well as mentally.</p>
