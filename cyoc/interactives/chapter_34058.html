<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick peered behind the dimly lit space behind the couch and saw the iguana’s familiar form lying deathly still. He gulped, and placed his hand on the protruding length of her long tail, which gave him no reaction. Not a good sign. Upstairs, Brendon’s music continued to blare, but Rick was now completely fixated on his pet.<br />
<br />
He gently kneeled down and reached behind the couch to extract Jo, placing both hands on her scaly midsection, and slowly pulling her out. When he had her lying beside the couch in plain view, Rick began a thorough examination of the iguana. She was breathing, though slowly, and seemed to be unconscious and unresponsive.<br />
<br />
Rick turned her on her side and checked her skin for burns, pulled open her eyelids and checked her pupils with the penlight he had in his pocket. Jo seemed all right, besides being limp and unmoving. He was just about to run for the phone to call her veterinarian, expecting to have to rush her in, when Rick noticed something strange.<br />
<br />
He had to do a double take, kneeling down closer and blinking. It seemed that Josephine was bigger than normal. Rick stared steadily, his scientific mind demanding proof of such an absurd claim, and to his sudden wide eyed astonishment he realized it was true. His three foot long pet iguana was slowly growing bigger right before his eyes. He gasped in amazement, placing his hand on her side and watching as the bumpy reptilian pattern stretched out beneath his palm.<br />
<br />
“Oh my God!” Rick gasped, his amazement turning to delight. “It’s working! It’s actually working!” In frantic amazement, he placed both his hands beneath Jo’s side and gently hefted her limp form up in his arms, marveling at the feeling of the lizard getting bigger and heavier in his arms. Changing in his grasp. Soon Josephine was quite hefty and Rick found she was nearing four feet in length, from snout to tail.<br />
<br />
Slowly, carefully, Rick carried his growing pet against his chest, arms supporting her thighs, and gently slipped her down onto the soft cushions of the couch, spread out on her back. She was still completely still, though her breathing was beginning to speed up. Rick didn’t dare to breathe, kneeling down in front of the couch to watch the animal’s metamorphosis.<br />
<br />
Josephine continued to grow, her body increasing and swelling in perfect proportion, gaining an inch or so every minute that ticked by. It was so slow, so perfect, and Rick couldn’t help but feel pride in his handiwork. Now closer to five feet long, the reptile was an impressive size. Rick was grinning like a child, and with a trembling hand he reached up and stroked Jo’s belly, tracing the scaly contour of her stomach with his fingers and thrilling as he felt them growing still bigger. He reached up and scratched her under the chin, stroking the loose flap of flesh between her neck and jaw, and simply watched the process run its course on the iguana’s body.<br />
<br />
There was a sudden crackling noise that emanated from deep within Jo’s body, and Rick’s eyes went wider, shooting down to look for the source of the noise. As she continued to grow, Rick could see her back thighs were starting to inflate in disproportion on either side of the base of her tail. As her thighs thickened up and grew, so too did her back legs, the limbs and feet gaining size and proportion that more closely matched the general shape of a human being. Rick gasped sharply and his jaw dropped. That wasn’t supposed to be happening at all! What was going on?<br />
<br />
As if to answer his question, Josephine stirred slightly, thrashing her tail and body from side to side and growling. After a moment she calmed back to stillness, her breathing even more shallow and quick. Her growth continued relentlessly, to the point her now six foot long body covered the couch. Rick watched as her shape began to change. Her back thighs widened, her torso seemed to stretch taller, waist thinning, chest growing thicker, even as her back legs continued to grow and lengthen. Her front legs snapped suddenly, lengthening, turning to arms. Her five fingered paws contorted and writhed, changing into precise claw tipped scaly human hands.<br />
<br />
Rick stared with pure astonishment, butterflies twisting in his stomach. This wasn’t possible! What had he done to his poor pet?<br />
Josephine continued to grow, neck stretching out from her shoulders, muzzle growing less blunt, sneering slightly as teeth sharpened from her gums, her body shifting and changing to a generally humanoid shape. In no time, she was perfectly formed to an anthro iguana, long tail held above a scaly heart shaped rump and soft pink anus, female cloaca tucked neatly between her legs. Shapely feminine torso, long seductive legs, dainty feminine arms. She was still growing, now at seven feet tall from head to toe, her large reptilian feet pressed against the arm of the couch and gently pressing up onto it as she grew, and grew.<br />
<br />
Rick got up from his kneeling position by his pet’s side and took several wary steps back, watching her stir again, right arm falling to the floor, legs pushing up the arm of the couch then dangling over the edge. Her head began pushing up the opposite arm of the couch, resting on it like a pillow as the iguana woman reached seven feet tall. Her tail lazily pressed away from her, sliding off the couch.<br />
<br />
Rick was now trembling in a combination of fear and amazement, watching helplessly as Jo continued to grow up, getting even scalier, even bigger, even more feminine and humanoid. Her muscle seemed to be expanding dramatically, filling her lithe shape with tight and toned shapeliness, but she remained unquestionably womanly. She was now eight feet in height, her head resting on the one end of the couch, her legs on the floor of the basement and reaching out with her size. Her great weight was pressing down the cushions as she spilt over the side more, tail reaching closer to Rick, a low growl reverberating from her muzzle and her fists clenching tight as she unconsciously altered.<br />
<br />
The chemist gulped, his eyes locked amorously on the giant still swelling pet as two tiny protrusions raised on either side of her chest, pulling upwards into a tiny peaked shape that rapidly began to grow. Soon, two circular mounds of flesh began to rise beneath the protrusions, ballooning into the unmistakable shape of two large, pert, and shapely female breasts. Rick gasped again, and felt his pants tent painfully. Everything stopped but the growth, Josephine growing bigger and bigger, the couch straining to hold her, her leg falling off the side to join her arm and tail, the entire iguana dumping from the couch and rolling onto her back in the middle of the study, near Rick’s feet.<br />
<br />
Nine feet tall, then ten, Josephine began to thrash again, a soft whimper and sigh as her tail wagged from side to side. Rick became distinctly aware of a throbbing between the reptile’s thick muscular thighs, and stared open mouthed as she spread her legs apart to reveal a moist pink cunny aching with arousal. Rick nearly passed out, watching his much loved pet and now test subject turn into a giant and undeniably sexual humanoid version of herself.<br />
<br />
Jo’s breathing became heavier, her large breasts raising and falling in time to her quick pants, and she thrashed more, whimpering, and then crying out as she became a solid 12 feet tall, orgasming wildly with hot white fluids dripping between her legs and onto the basement floor. She stopped growing, her arousal gently faded, and Rick was left standing against the wall staring at peacefully still 13 foot tall giant iguana woman in the middle of the floor. A massive, muscular, feminine, softly breathing reptile with vaginal juices still pooled beneath her rump and thighs.<br />
<br />
Jo’s yellow eyes flicked open, and her black cat-like pupils adjusted to the light. She blinked several times, then sat up gently, a hand reaching up and scratching the back of her head and her long iguana spines.</p>
