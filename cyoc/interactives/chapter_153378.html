<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kat, his sister, seemed to grow taller. It didn&#39;t take long, before she was looking over him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wha- what happened?&quot; His voice! It sounded different! Higher-pitched!<br />
<br />
Looking around, everything seemed larger. No. He was shorter!<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaww...you&#39;re so cute! Look!&quot;<br />
<br />
She held out a mirror to Dan. He went to take it, but stopped. His hand! His arm! They were both much smaller and skinnier! They were also baby-skin smooth. Perhaps a shade darker? A bit more? <br />
<br />
Looking down at himself further, the clothes he was wearing was different as well. He had on a gray graphic T-shirt of Spiderman in an action pose in mid-flight! He had on a pair of blue jeans that seemed tiny, and a pair of small little black Doc Marten-style shoes with their boot-like thick soles on the bottoms. At least his shoes and jeans were cool.<br />
<br />
She was giggling. &quot;What the heck!?&quot; Dan said in his high-pitched kid&#39;s voice. &quot;What did you do to me!?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
She continued trying to hand him a hand-held mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here! Look!&quot;<br />
<br />
He grabbed it and looked . He gawked at the young boy staring back at him. It&#39;s the kid she babysits sometimes that is dropped off at their house on most weekends! Staring back at him is that kid!<br />
<br />
Wide-eyed, he feels his face with his right hand, while holding the mirror with his left. <br />
<br />
Short Sandy brown hair that&#39;s a bit messy. Hazel-grayish eyes.  Skinny oval-shaped head. Small little bump of a nose. The eyebrows cocked at a slight angle in an innocent, angelic, almost sad, puppy kinda way. Which made the face even cuter. It was a spitting image of that kid, Jacob, only in reverse!<br />
<br />
&quot;You turned me into Jacob!?&quot; He in his little boy voice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I decided to take some mercy on you and turned you into his twin brother instead of an animal, so you better be grateful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?? Greatful!? For making me into a little boy in second grade!?&quot; he nearly shrieked in his high-pitched little voice<br />
<br />
Also, Jacob doesn&#39;t have a twin! How are you going to explain this to Mom and Dad. Or to his parents, for that matter, if they see me and think I&#39;m their son?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom and dad won&#39;t care. Matter of fact, they wanted me to practice by turning you into an animal instead. Even though you&#39;re such a jerk, I couldn&#39;t be THAT mean! At least you&#39;ll still have some human dignity left.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As for Jacob&#39;s parents; now YOUR parents as well; mom and dad will take care of them. She&#39;s a much more powerful witch than I am. She can alter peoples&#39; minds. Give them new memories. And dad, being a security computer expert, will go in and change your birth certificate, your social security number, and your school registrations, while Mom will work on your teachers&#39; and principal&#39;s minds. Not just your current second grade teacher, but your &quot;old&quot; first grade and kindergarten teachers as well. They&#39;ll remember you and Jacob, the cute little mischeiousvous identical twin boys in their classrooms  from last year and the year before.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Your name will be changed as well. It&#39;s now Michael. Michael Bennett. Everyone will refer to you as &quot;the Bennett twins,&quot; and also call you &quot;Jake and Mike.&quot; Jake will be the &quot;older&quot; twin, and he is now slightly taller, heavier, and stronger than you, so he&#39;s going to think of you as his &quot;younger&quot; or &quot;little&quot; brother! Hehe!&quot;<br />
<br />
So many questions, complaints, and fears ran through poor Dan&#39;s 16 year old high school teenage sophomore mind, now stuck in the body of an 8 year old second grader. He was rendered speechless. <br />
<br />
&quot;Besides. You like Jacob. You and him get along very well.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was true. Dan always had a fondness for that little twerp. He had fun knocking him to the ground with one arm. He would laugh, get up, and try to tackle Dan with all the might in his little second grade body. Which was never enough to overcome a single arm of Dan&#39;s.<br />
<br />
But Dan didn&#39;t WANT to be his brother! Much less his TWIN brother! He was a 16 year old high school student, star of the baseball team for chrissakes! Not some skinny little 8 year old kid stick in the second grade who couldn&#39;t even take on a single arm of someone bigger than him. Now MUCH bigger than him.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, their parents pulled into the driveway. Turning around with a worried look on his young little boy face wide-eyed, he watched as his parents got out of their car. Feeling vulnerable, Dan took a couple steps back behind his sister that gave him his demotion, in an automatic attempt at finding some refuge without much thinking. He didn&#39;t want his parents to see him so shrunken down. <br />
<br />
His mom was also a witch! Kat said so! He was now afraid and feeling unusually shy. He automatically felt like a puppy that was trapped, and his only defense to use was his adorable little innocence while cowering away. So totally out-of-character for the confident 16 year old high school teen with a lot of friends and a successful high school baseball career so far.<br />
<br />
His parents walked up the steps leading from the driveway to the front door. Still standing on the patio, their parents greeted them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! I didn&#39;t know you had Jacaob tonight! On a Friday afternoon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t Jacob, mom. This is his twin brother. Mike. Formerly known as Dan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooohh...you did it! You transformed your brother? But you turned him into a little boy that looks just like that boy whom you babysit. You were supposed to turn him into an animal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking UP at his mom and sister with his now wide gray eyes, he couldn&#39;t believe what he was hearing! <br />
<br />
His dad then stepped up, and ruffled his hair, &quot;why, hello there little guy!&quot; he cheerfully said. &quot;And what brings you here?&quot; <br />
<br />
Still shy, shocked, speechless, and now intimidated, all he could do was stand there and look up at two of the people he used to be taller than, and at eye-level with his dad. Now, all three easily loom over him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Being shy now, huh?&quot; his dad said in a friendly manner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, this is Dan I turned him in Jacob&#39;s little twin brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You what? Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I figured turning him into some animal was a little TOO cruel. And besides. I wanted to start learning from Mom about mind-alteration spells. I wanted an excuse to practice it on his new parents and brother, and his teachers and principal over at the elementary school he will now be attending.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s actually a good idea!&quot; said her mom. &quot;I&#39;m so proud of you thinking outside the box like that! And taking charge of your own education!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about all the school records, his birth certificate, and his medical records and so forth?&quot; said dad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well. You&#39;re a computer security expert....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no! I ain&#39;t doing that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But honey, this is an excellent learning opportunity for your older....now only...child,&quot; said mom.<br />
<br />
Wife and daughter looking directly at him pleading. Former son who used to be slightly taller than all of them except his dad, looking up at him worried. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, fine. I&#39;ll do it!&quot; knowing just how important it was for his daughter to learn, and to learn quickly on how to be a witch. <br />
<br />
&quot;Right. Let&#39;s get to it, then!&quot;<br />
<br />
And so, they parted ways. Dad went inside to get to work on hacking. Kat went to the garage to pull out the car booster seat she would sometimes use for Jacob (now everyone will call him by his short name, Jake, instead,) whenever she drove anywhere with him. That booster seat now apparently, intended for Dan...or rather, Mike now....instead. And his mom stood there with &quot;Mike.&#39;</p>
