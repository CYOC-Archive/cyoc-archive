<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Runt, I might regret this later, but I...&quot; I hesitated, looking at my new and gorgeous reflection. &quot;Fuck it. Make me a demon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Runt plunged. I tried to scream out in pain as his ginormous goat dick filled my ass, but no sound escaped my lips. I stumbled back against his body, which felt like lava on my back, searing my skin. I swore I could actually smell myself cooking. Runt’s hand crept under my arm and clutched at my heart while his furry chin came to rest on my shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;No turnin&#39; back now,&quot; he whispered into my ear. &quot;Now, tell me, how d&#39;you want to look?&quot;<br />
&quot;Make me a beast,&quot; I gasped. Somehow, it was very easy to speak my innermost desires to Runt. &quot;No more weedy human. I want horns. I want a tail. I want muscles and body hair. I want to be huge in every department. I want people to scream when they see me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Runt laughed a gleeful, sadistic cackle before clasping his hands around my waist and thrusting so hard my feet left the floor. This time, I did scream, but as the pain intensified so did the pleasure. He pounded my ass, and I swear the force of it broke my pelvis. My cock grew so hard I was scared it might burst from all the blood my body was pumping into it. I lost all control of my body, falling limp, flailing on Runt’s dick like a damp towel. I begged for it to end and I didn’t want it to stop.<br />
<br />
Then, I felt Runt relax, sighing in satisfaction. The red hot heat of his body flowed into me and I burned from the inside out. I can be certain, but I felt as though smoke was brimming from my mouth and nose. The pain was such that I felt like it should have killed me. For all I know, perhaps it did.<br />
<br />
‘See you on the other side,’ Runt chuckled. <br />
<br />
I slid off his dick and collapsed on the floor, completely paralysed, battered and broken. But as the remains of my human body began do crumble away, I felt something growing in the pit of my stomach, something hot and powerful, something hungry. That was the last thing I remembered before blacking out.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
I remember snippets of vivid and feverish dreams. <br />
<br />
I was standing behind the counter of the diner where I worked. It wasn’t the same, though. It was more like a huge, grand temple built out of pieces of the diner. At the time, this didn’t seem strange, though.<br />
<br />
I was back in my old human body, before Runt had altered it, still pudgy and pale. I was also completely naked. At first I was shocked and tried to cover myself, but as I looked around the place, I realised everyone else, all the customers and my workmates, they were all naked too. Unlike me, though, their bodies were flawless. The men were all muscular and handsome, with inhumanly huge cocks and all at least twice as tall as I was. The women had perfect, smooth skin and breasts that defied physics.  Even my boss, Rodriguez, who was normally on overweight, Mexican man, was a monstrous, chiseled God.<br />
<br />
Two of these perfect creatures, a man and a woman, came to my counter and ordered some food. I barely understood a word they said, but soon a tray was handed to me. But on it was no food I had ever served before. Though I could hold it in my hands, it was stocked like a sumptuous banquet table, almost overflowing with suckling pigs, stuffed fowl and basted meat. Spices and sauces and smells overpowered my senses. The customers watched me impatiently, they may have even said something, but I didn’t want to serve the food to them. Instead, I plunged my fist into the centre of spread and pulled a handful of delicious flavours out, stuffing it straight into my mouth. <br />
<br />
The couple gasped in shock. My boss yelled in surprise. All around me angry voices chattered and nagged but I didn’t listen. I just kept stuffing my face with the gorgeous collection of flavours, letting the juices run down my naked body. My appetite could not be sated and I felt my body swell to accommodate what I was adding to it. My already unimpressive physique was quickly ballooning. My belly distended, my chins tripled, my pecs sagged and I didn’t care. It was all too good.<br />
<br />
The man was so enraged he reached over the table to try and stop me. Without a thought, my hand grabbed at his chest as if he were just another morsel. He immediately seemed to deflate, becoming just a hollow rag of skin in my hand. His body was just a costume and now it belonged to me. I turned to the woman and did the same to her.<br />
<br />
Rodriguez was furious. He was yelling so hard he had turned purple. I couldn’t pick out any distinct words, it was just an irritating din, but I had been yelled at like this enough time before to know I’d had enough. I’d held back my tempter so many times before, but now I didn’t. I lifted my huge, oversized and punched him right in the face. There was no resistance and my hand went straight through. He burst, and out of his body came a fountain of gold coins, jewels and stones. I was showered in riches.<br />
<br />
The walls of the building began to crack. I was dimly aware of the other customers screaming and running out the door. I was distracted, for my cock had suddenly begun to swell. I marvelled in aware as it came up to meet me. It passed a foot in length, two feet, four, until it rose up higher than my head and thicker than a tree trunk. And when I touched it, every square inch of it was so sensitive it made me shiver. I pumped it like a butter churner, and as I did my fingers fused into it. I couldn’t let go of my cock. But why would I want to?<br />
<br />
It wasn’t long before I climaxed. A torrent of cum fired up and onto the ceiling, blasting it away. More cracks spread through the building and pieces of it were falling away. But I was beyond caring. I fell back, and as I did I seemed to melt. My body coalesced into a wide pool of skin coloured liquid. I couldn’t move, but I had no reason to. The room around my was disintegrating, leaving nothing but a dark void beyond. And as the floor beneath me vanished and I fell into the nothing, I felt truly at peace. <br />
<br />
I had given in to every impulse. And I wasn’t ashamed. All my old concerns were just drifting away. And now what was left of me was being poured into a brand new mould.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
I opened my eyes. Daylight was drifting in through my bedroom window. I could hear pigeons cooing.<br />
<br />
As the memories of my dreams swirled around my groggy brain, I wondered what I’d been drinking last night. Although, I didn’t feel hungover. I felt… different, but actually pretty good.<br />
<br />
I realised I was lying on the floor of my bedroom. I sat up, and that felt weird somehow. It took a few moments for me to realise that my eyes were higher than I was used to. I glanced over to the full-length mirror on my bedroom door and was greeted by a face I didn’t recognise. I lifted my hand to touch it. It was definitely mine.<br />
<br />
I looked down at my body. It was huge. I was somewhat wedged into the space between my bed and the wall, and my feet were so far my legs were bunched up against the door, as if I were stuck in a small bathtub. And I was ripped. My pecs were like trashcan lids and my abs like cantaloupes. A thick coating of hair covered my chest. Even so, I still had a visible treasure trail. Starting at my neck, running down between my pecs and disappearing into my pubic hair was line of bushy… I had to call it fur, because no human had hair this thick. I found myself fingering it playfully, which is when I discovered my huge, manly hands at the end of hairy, muscular arms.<br />
<br />
Of course, I couldn’t fail to notice my cock. The giant was poking out a bushy nest of pubes, with two bulging balls to match. It was nowhere near as long as it had been in the dream, thank God (or whomever else). And since I hadn’t quite grasped my new proportions I couldn’t tell you precise measurements. But even taking it in my new meaty hand, it was… well. I blushed. And only flaccid.<br />
<br />
Slowly, I got to my big, hairy feet. My head almost touched the ceiling, and it took me a moment to maintain my balance. I tried to get a look at myself in the mirror, but I had to stoop to fit. My hands played up from my crotch, up my chest to my head. My face was completely different. Big, striking eyes beneath a thick brow. My nose was a bit animalistic, sort of half human, half dog. The trail of fur from chest spread out across my chest into a luscious beard. However, instead of covering my face, it spread around my chin and connected with my shaggy, dark hair, creating the appearance of a lion’s mane. And protruding from my hair were a pair of impressive horns, curled and pointed like a ram’s.<br />
<br />
I flexed a little, admiring my new body in every position. Then I turned and peered over my shoulder to view the back. My mane spread thickly down my back, tapering into a narrow line that traced my spine. It stopped just above a gorgeous, fuzzy butt, where it turned into my tail. My eyes bulged and a grasped it in my hand, pulling it round to see it properly. It was a little like a bulls tail, covered in dark hair and with a bulge of fur at the end. But it was much thicker and long enough to just about touch the floor. As I examined it, I found I could move it with ease. And not just from the base, I could curl and twist any part of it. I experimented by using it to pick up a nearby glass of water. I wrapped my tail twice around it and tried to grasp, but it immediately shattered, spilling water everywhere. Oh well, I reasoned. I would practise.<br />
<br />
It was a body completely unlike my old one and I was falling in love with it.</p>
