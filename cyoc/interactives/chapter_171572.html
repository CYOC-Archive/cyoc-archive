<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, uh... Let me just get a quick shower and then properly dressed...&quot; Mia gently grabs your arm before you managed to slip back inside. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but there just isn&#39;t time. The sooner we figure out what is up, the better&quot; she said in a much smoother, deeper voice. You felt that even her voice sounded sexy too. Calming even, as you no longer felt as flustered. &quot;Ok, just let me at least put on a pair of shoes first.&quot; <br />
<br />
You step back inside and went to get your shoes from last night, only to sigh at your shit luck. All you had there were the pair of 4 inch, pencil heel, sandals that you had jokingly bought yourself yesterday. And, you had forgot that you were currently washing your sneakers after stepping in some dog poop on your way home. So now that they were still soaking, these heels were literally all you had. So you carefully slipped them on and stumbled your way outside again, much to Mia&#39;s amazement. <br />
<br />
&quot;What, these are all I have at the moment.&quot; You snap when she gave you a judgemental look. But all she does is laugh and offers you a hand to help you balance better, which you gratefully accept. With Mia&#39;s help, you managed to hobble your way into the car as Mia hops in besides you. You can actually feel your ass open itself up expectantly, since whenever you sat lately, it was either while sitting on the toilet or stuffing your ass with a dildo. The empty feeling made you squirm a bit too.  That is until you felt your balls slip inside your own ass hole. The moment you felt that, your asshole tightened up around your scrotum, sealing your balls inside your own asshole. You could feel their warmth inside of you, which made your almost nonexistent dick leak out even more precum as a small wet spot started to form on the front of your yoga pants. <br />
<br />
Mia noticed your squirming and placed one of her larger hands on top of your right hand and began to calmly hold it. A gesture that normally you would have found creepy if it was any other person. But because you knew that the man next to you was actually the woman Mia, you felt reassured instead. <br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
When you arived at the clinic, Mia helped you walk to the designated room, holding onto your hand the entire time. You must have looked like a loving couple based on the looks you both were given by many of the other personnel in the clinic. The two of you were escorted to one of the lab rooms, where you were innitially asked to take a seat, but the staff quickly realized that there was just 1 chair. However Mia took the initiative and sat down in the chair. Then to not just your own, but also the staff member&#39;s surprize, lifted you up onto her lap, and held your narrow waist. You could feel her hard thigh muscles through your cushion of an ass, and admittedly was turned on a bit by them. <br />
<br />
Before too long, the professional entered the room and immediately began to prep both of your left arms to draw some blood. <br />
The staff never even brought you another chair, so you just continued to sit on Mia&#39;s lap. Mia on the other hand, was absolutely freaking out. She felt so hot to be around you. Seeing your boobs in only a bra had <br />
Made her clit stiffen and hurt a bit as it tried to stretch slightly longer. Now she could feel your bare ass through the dildo hole you had cut, sitting right above where her clit&#39;s tip was. <br />
<br />
The oddest thing though was how she kept having this constant urge to help you. She felt like she should become someone you would need and often depend on. And she had to admit that she found your body to be alluring. She liked men, but there was something about your body that just did it for her. <br />
<br />
Over the next hour, you both were subjected to various medical exams and screenings, and then after a short break, two &quot;women&quot; came into your room. You said women, but they were not entirely normal shaped.<br />
<br />
The one lady had mostly the upper half of her body as a normal human, but the lower half was 100% a cow&#39;s. Like some kind of cow centaur, complete with an udder between her hind legs, and 4 inch long nipples on each of her 4 basketball sized breasts. The other lady had a human body, but a multitude of various sized tentacles comming out of her sleeves instead of her normal arms. Her legs were normal, but the back of her pencil skirt had been cut out near the top to allow for her over 7 foot long lizard tail, which was flicking back and fourth idly. <br />
<br />
The cowtaur lady spoke first. &quot;Good morning, I am Dr. Anna, and this is Dr. Jill. The both of us will be taking care of you two from now on as you have both been listed as being a special observation case.&quot; <br />
<br />
Dr. Jill followed her up by saying &quot;That is the good news though, since we are the best this clinic can offer. Unfortunately that is most of the good news. The bad news is that we have confirmed that the both of you have become victems of an unfortunate mishap. Durring your last swap, one of the inner guiding systems seemed to have short circuited and blew a fuse. And, since it happened in the middle of your swap, some of the details that this particular system was monitoring failed to be properly aligned throughout the transition. This brings us to the issue you both now are faced with. Your swap of body parts went through completely perfect. So no issue there. However, the hormonal data didn&#39;t. And instead, actually had gotten set to be maintained. So Mia, your overies, now produce testosterone. And you sir, your testicles now are producing an enormous amount of Estrogen, given their size. This is why you both have seemed to have nearly become the opposite gender. Specifically you sir, you could be considered to be practically a genetically accurate female. And from what our tests have found, your former penis now connects to what looks to be the beginnings of a womb. And as for you mia, you have lost your womb entirely, but a small tube has started making its way through your clitoris, and should soon open up near the tip, as your clitoris becomes more and more like a penis.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute, so what? I am becoming a biologically accurate woman?&quot; You exclaim in your very feminine voice.<br />
<br />
Dr. Anna was the one who answered you this time. &quot;Actually, it is more accurate to say that you are now a woman. Not becoming one. Your charts shown that all the way down to the genetic level, you are unmistakably female. You should expect to begin your menstrual cycle soon as well. But I am sure Miss. Mia can help you out with that, as the both of you will be living together for the next few months while we monitor your bodies. Unfortunately this is required, and non-negotiable. It was included in the contracts you signed. And as this has never happened before, you will both be our first instance of handling this. We apologize for the inconvenience though, and have briefed you areas of employment about it for you. You both have recieved 6 months of paid leave as well. Lastly one of our teams are currently gathering to bring you both your belongings, if there is anything specific we should bring you, please let us know right away.&quot;<br />
<br />
You and Mia both were speechless. It was quite a lot to process. You were a woman now for all intents and purposes. And she soon would be a man.  Then both of you would be living together under direct monitoring by specialists for half a year. It was a heavy load. But Mia seemed to take it a bit better, as she asked next what, for the both of you, was the biggest question. &quot;Is this reversible?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t know&quot; said Dr. Jill. &quot;From what we could understand, you may be able to be fixed with enough time and research.&quot; Then both of the doctors turned to face you. &quot;As for you, outside of castration, which we definitely want to avoid at all cost, we are not sure. You are significantly further developed than Mia, and it may be too late for you, even if we pumped you full of testosterone. You have to understand, your balls are honestly huge. And their size allowed them to produce so much excess estrogen, equal the amount collectively produced by over 6 women, than your body may have undergone a mutation of sorts. We are still looking into it, but you may want to prepare yourself as you are quite possibly permanently female. If I had to set an odds, I would say you have a 70% likelyhood.&quot; Explained Dr. Jill. Dr. Anna the further added &quot;but in that event, we will assume full responsibility and handle all paperwork for you, plus ensure your living expenses are paid for in full for the rest of your life as compensation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, at least your life wouldn&#39;t be to hard going forward you thought. The both of you were shown to a room, which was like a 2 story appartment with full amenities. With a large, master bedroom as well. It was a huge step up from you house in terms of luxery. Mia was concerned though. &quot;Is there really only 1 bedroom?&quot; She asked the home keeper. &quot;Correct, 1 master bedroom with a king sized mattress.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mia turned to you and asked your opinion. Honestly you never considered it before. But this setting was almost like you both were married, or at least dating. Well, calling you strangers wasn&#39;t right either as she has already made you cum last week in the showers. After another few seconds of mulling it over in your head, you finally answered. &quot;I don&#39;t mind sharing a bed if you are fine with it.&quot; <br />
<br />
This was how the two of you began living together.</p>
