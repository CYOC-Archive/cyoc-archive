<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer's eyes lit up as she caught sight of Daniel's computer across his room, &quot;Hey, maybe we could try looking online to see if anything else was changed around from the curse!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think that we'd be able to find anything?&quot; Daniel followed her as she bounced over to the computer and turned the monitor on, admiring her curves and the soft accents given by her longer fur.<br />
<br />
Jennifer didn't look back as she replied, too busy opening up the browser and bringing up a few search engines, &quot;Sure, I mean, we're remembering things that hadn't happened to us before we were changed, and we've been checked out by doctors and all, right? There must be some information out there about us or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniel's ears perked, &quot;Yeah, that's right! There should be something there, even if it's just medical info. I wish I could remember exactly what my dad was talking about with our last visit. I mean, your aunt had puppies without any problems, right?&quot; His tail stopped wagging as he realized what he had just said, &quot;Wait, your aunt had puppies?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I, I remember that, too.&quot;  Jennifer looked over to Daniel with surprised eyes, &quot;You should come over here and look at this,&quot; she cocked her head towards the open webpage.<br />
<br />
Daniel stood and walked to his desk, seeing the browser open to what looked like an encyclopedia page, &quot;Homo Canid Sapiens? Is that what I think it is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so. There's a lot of info here, as well. Looks like around one in a thousand people or so are born partly as dogs,&quot; She scanned down through the page, &quot;General features.. common breeds.. reproduction?&quot; She shifted slightly in her seat as she read that last heading.<br />
<br />
Daniel leaned over her shoulder, not noticing her move as he read aloud, &quot;Most are unable to bear young normally, though medical discoveries around the turn of the century have been able to remove the infertility problem, allowing greater numbers of Canids to flourish over the years.  So you could have puppies, eventually?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer skimmed some more, shifting again as she sped across a section on estrous cycles, &quot;Yeah, it just takes some medication according to the article.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniel smiled, &quot;Well, that's good. I guess that's why my dad didn't sound too concerned, and why he said it wouldn't get in the way of my school.&quot; he rolled his eyes, &quot;I get a B on one of my tests, and suddenly my dad mentions schoolwork as often as he can. At least all he does is tease me about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Daniel! Jennifer! Dinner is ready if you want any!&quot; Mr. Gibson's voice called from downstairs, grabbing the attention of the two.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be right down, dad!&quot; Daniel's tail wagged as he headed to the door, Jennifer following behind after shutting down the computer.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
The table was set for three, a platter of steak in the center surrounded by two large bowls containing mashed potatoes and a salad.  Daniel and Jennifer could smell all of this from the upstairs hallway, and were panting excitedly by the time they rushed downstairs and to the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Smells great, dad.&quot; Daniel said, his tail wagging back and forth as he took the seat on the far side of the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Mr. Gibson,&quot; Jennifer added as she took the seat on the near side, her tail wagging with equal enthusiasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem, you two. Dig in, I'll be there in a moment,&quot; Mr Gibson called over the sound of a running faucet, &quot;I've just gotten off the phone with your parents to let them know you're here, Jennifer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks again,&quot; she said, cutting a piece of steak while Daniel piled his plate with potatoes.<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem. They said you could stay the night, as well. They'll call tomorrow and let the school know you would be out for a couple of days, and to prepare some make-up work for you.&quot; The water cut off, and Daniel's father could be heard pacing in the kitchen in search of a towel.<br />
<br />
Jennifer shifted in her seat as she put some salad on her plate next to her potatoes and steak, Daniel already digging into his food, &quot;Out of classes for a couple of days? Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, since you're going into heat now, you'd probably have a hard time concentrating in classes. I'll call in for you too, Daniel, since you'll probably want to be around Jennifer now. Just be sure you do your schoolwork after I pick it up!&quot; Glasses clinked as Daniel's father reached into the cupboards.<br />
<br />
Jennifer's fork dropped onto her plate, as Daniel stopped chewing and made an odd noise around all the food in his mouth, &quot;Oh, umm, thanks Mr. Gibson.&quot; She felt her face flush as she shifted in her chair again. She realized that she had started feeling slightly aroused as she was looking over the article, especially with Daniel leaning over her shoulder as he read.<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem, no problem,&quot; Daniel's father appeared with three glasses, which he proceeded to put around the table. &quot;like I said before, you're lucky the doctors said you couldn't get pregnant without help.  You and Daniel can spend some time together this way, which I understand is a lot better than being alone when you go into heat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer looked into her plate, memories of being alone during previous heats suddenly coming to her mind. Locking herself in her room, her frustration and desires driving her mad as she was unable to fully relieve herself. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she slowly resumed eating, though food was hardly the only thing on her mind right now. Her new memories were slowly rekindling the fire in her from before, and she found herself looking over Daniel's spotted features more and more as he sat, eating.<br />
<br />
Mr. Gibson returned again with two bottles under his arm, &quot;Well, you two were hungry, weren't you?&quot; He said as he looked at their nearly finished plates. &quot;Well, before you two head off for the night, here.&quot; He uncorked the two bottles and began pouring. &quot;Sparkling cider for you, and champagne for me. Your family wants to take us all out to eat once your cycle is over since you two are together now, but I figure we can have a small celebration before then.&quot; He smiled as he re-corked the bottles and sat down, raising his glass.<br />
<br />
Daniel and Jennifer put their forks down, finished, and raised their glasses with him, &quot;Cheers,&quot; Mr. Gibson said with a wink, before taking a sip of his drink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, cheers,&quot; Jennifer said, before quickly downing her drink.  Her hunger taken care of, she was quickly being reminded of a different craving that was begging for her attention.  She shifted once more in her seat as she looked over to Daniel, who was sniffing in her direction with look of lust coming over his face, &quot;I'll just go up and..&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Gibson waved to her absently as he started eating, &quot;Go ahead. I'll take care of the dishes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer got up and all but ran back to the stairway, looking back and moaning slightly to herself as she saw Daniel get up from the table, trying to cover up his penis from his father's view as it stood halfway out of its sheath. Her tail wagged faster as Daniel looked across the house at her, before she sprinted up the stairs and into Daniel's room. &quot;Ooooh,&quot; She cooed as she flopped onto Daniel's bed, writhing on the sheets as his scent came off of them and started driving her wild, &quot;He better get up here soon.&quot;</p>
