<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason looked over the numerous, oddly named beverages.  They all sounded so strange to him, unlike any label he&#39;d seen before.  Note to mention the crazy things Tina claimed they could do.  He looked down at his own forlorn expression.  His brown hair was a mess and his graphic tee and flannel shirt hung off his skinny frame.  He absentmindedly tugged at the sparse scruff on his chin.  He&#39;d never really been able to grow decent facial hair.  All he&#39;d ever been able to manage was some scruff on his chin.  Though, he&#39;d always wished he could grow a full beard.  He admired guys who were lucky enough to have the genetics to grow full, thick beards.  He looked back up to the labels again, his eye seemingly drawn to one in particular.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s a Fuzz Muster?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tina smiled at his question, leaning on the bar toward him, her mischievous grin reflected in hits surface.  &quot;You know, I could tell you the answer, but wouldn&#39;t it be more fun just to try it yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason grimaced.  &quot;What kind of bartender are you, anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her grin only widened.  &quot;The best kind.  You want some Fuzz Muster or not?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason shrugged.  &quot;Fine.  What the hell, why not?&quot;<br />
<br />
She whipped a bottle out from under the counter and tossed it, spinning, into her other hand.  &quot;That&#39;s the spirit!  Want to mix it with anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I think I&#39;m good with just the, ah, Fuzz Muster for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason didn&#39;t even see her whip out the pint glass, but it was suddenly sitting in front of him as she perfectly poured the dark brown elixir.  She then placed the half-empty bottle next to it.  &quot;Just as well.  Newbies should probably just stick to one drink at a time before they start mixing things up.  Enjoy.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then turned and made her way to the opposite end of the bar, serving more drinks to other patrons.  Jason tentatively eyed the pint of Fuzz Muster.  It looked like it could be some sort of ale, or perhaps a stout.  Jason was no expert on various kinds of alcohol.  Heck, if these brews were as unique as Tina said, then this could even be a unique brew all its own.  He lifted the glass and sniffed it.  It smelled rich, and oaky.  He decided to go for it and took a careful sip of the liquid.  It had an immediate, bold flavor.  It was like drinking strong, sweet coffee.  He put the glass down and grimaced.  That&#39;s when he realized a lot of the patrons were staring at him closely, many of them smiling.<br />
<br />
Luckily, Tina was already on it.  &quot;Alright, people, leave him alone.  Let him drink in peace.  That means you too, Frank.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other patrons looked away and the old man from before grumbled into the large glass Tina had given him earlier.  At least, Jason thought it was the old man.  His hair seemed to have less gray in it than before, and his back less hunched.  Jason took another sip of the Fuzz Muster.  It wasn&#39;t bad, just bold.<br />
<br />
Tina wiped her bar rag along the counter, passing by Jason.  &quot;Don&#39;t mind the others.  They love newbies.  The first few drinks are always the most entertaining.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason took a deeper drink of the Fuzz Muster.  Not only had he gotten used to the flavor, but he was starting to like it.  &quot;Why&#39;s that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tina grinned again as she watched him.  &quot;Oh, no reason.&quot;  She stifled a laugh.  &quot;Just let me know if you need anything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
He glanced at the odd woman as she wandered away again.  There was something very peculiar about her, but not off putting.  He scratched his neck at a sudden itch.  He stopped when he felt stubble at his fingertips.  His eyes shot to the mirrored counter.  There he saw about a day&#39;s worth of stubble coating his cheeks and front of his neck.  It was the kind of stubble he would never be able to grow, full, thick, and not at all sparse.  The sparse scruff on his chin had even filled out some, looking closer to a fluffy chin beard.  He tentatively ran a hand through it, feeling the coarse hairs.  He pulled his hand away and stared at several brown hairs that had appeared on the back of it.  He quickly pulled up his sleeve to see a decent smattering of hair along his forearm, petering out before passing his elbow.  Curious, he pulled up his shirt, just in time to see several hairs poke out of his skin and surround his belly button.  Not wanting to be indecent in public, but put a hand up his shirt to feel his normally hairless chest.  He could feel a smattering of new hair in the center of his chest, as well as some more spreading out around his nipples.  He heard bouts of chuckles around the room and realized several people were staring at him again, chortling at his wide-eyed expression.  He reddened in embarrassment and immediately pulled his hand out from under his shirt.<br />
<br />
Tina glared at the crowd.  &quot;What did I just say?&quot;  The crowd looked away again, but continued to giggle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, come on, Tina.&quot;  Frank grinned at the bartender.  &quot;You can&#39;t really blame us.  Just look at the kid&#39;s face!&quot;  Frank looked different to Jason.  His once-gray hair was now black, with only a few streaks of gray at his temples.  His back was now straight and there was almost no grizzle in his beard.<br />
<br />
Frank was quieted by a single glare from Tina.  She looked at Jason encouragingly.  &quot;Go on, newbie.  Don&#39;t mind them.  Pretty cool, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason rubbed at the new stubble on his cheeks.  &quot;This is amazing!  How come nobody knows about this?&quot;<br />
<br />
She leaned her back on the counter and turned her head towards Jason.  &quot;Because I don&#39;t want them to.  Nobody can find this place unless I let them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason took another drink of the elixir.  &quot;How?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tina winked at him, her mischievous grin widening.  &quot;Magic.&quot;  She looked down at the hand holding his drink.  &quot;So, newbie, what&#39;s it like being fuzzy?  Looks like you&#39;ve almost got half your drink gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason looked at his pint.  She was right.  He&#39;d been drinking it right up.  He was startled to see the hand holding the drink was growing more hair.  He had reached average body hair, and was now starting to pass it.  He pulled off his flannel shirt, so he was just down to the graphic tee.  He felt a chill as the shirt tugged on his new arm hair as it slipped off.  The smattering of hair had become longer and thicker, the covering seeming to darkening his arm by several shades.  The growth of hair seemed to run right up into his tee&#39;s sleeve.  He felt up the sleeve to find more hair growing on his upper arm as well.  He looked down at the reflective counter, seeing the stubble thickening around his cheesy grin.  While it had been full at thick before, even his short stubble was dense enough to start looking like a beard.  He also noticed several chest hairs poking out over the collar of his tee.  He now had a full-blown chin beard, full and thick.  He couldn&#39;t even see his skin under it anymore.  He looked around, seeing several people still watching him, including Tina.  He decided to plunger his hand under his shirt anyway, and was surprised to feel a full, thick coating of hair on his torso.  It was thickest on his chest and stomach, but there was a thick trail connecting the two, as well as a light covering everywhere in between.  Feeling up, he found a decent covering of hair all the way up to his shoulders.  Curious, he felt around to his back, finding hair on his lower back, and on his shoulder blades.  He pulled his hand back out, shaking slightly with adrenaline.  He&#39;d never been hairy in his life.  Now he was, and it was amazing.<br />
<br />
Tina continued to grin.  &quot;You like that, newbie?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason felt his face flush.  &quot;It&#39;s just so... It&#39;s just so amazing!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tina laughed.  &quot;Yeah it is!  Tell you what, you can keep experimenting if you want.  We&#39;ve got plenty of drinks you haven&#39;t tried yet.  Or, you can finish that Fuzz Muster.  Just a warning, you&#39;re getting pretty fuzzy as it is.  Any more and things could get... interesting.  Or, you could leave if you want.  Just remember, all drinks wear off at sunrise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason ran a hand along his new arm hair, studying it.  Did he really want more?  She was right, he was getting pretty hairy as it was.  Though, he still had half a pint left, and then some.  Or, he could try out some of the other beverages.  Or, he could leave the bar for the night.  Tina eyed him, waiting for his answer.</p>
