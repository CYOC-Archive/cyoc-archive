<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kim has just closed her door, when Jeff emerges from the bathroom, ‘aaaah, that was good,’ he thinks to himself, entering his room, ‘now, where was…,’ the boy is suddenly cut off by a strange sensation, a tingling feeling running all over his body, which even causes him to shiver.<br />
<br />
“What was that,” Jeff asks himself, he then suddenly feels weird, his head starts spinning, which causes Jeff to drop to the floor on his knees. Next thing he knows is his clothes start to feel baggy and bigger on him, ‘am… am I shrinking,’ he asks himself. Jeff also starts to feel all his strength seeming to leave his body, the boy weakly wriggles out of his oversized clothes and just lies on top of the pile.<br />
<br />
Jeff suddenly feels his legs and arms bend backwards, which causes him to groan in discomfort, he then feels his hands grabbing his feet, then he feels his hands merge with his feet. While his torso stays the same size, his head continues to shrink in between his shoulders, ‘wh-what is happening to me,’ he asks himself, ‘I… I feel so weird.’<br />
<br />
The transforming teen is still able to see, feel, smell and hear, even as his head changes form, becoming a tiny bow, which is seen between his shoulders. Suddenly his chest puffs out, while his back hollows out, his cock merges with his skin, which has changed into nice soft light blue silk, as lace starts to cover the silk, the lace having been his cock, soon a beautiful and brand new blue lace bra is lying on Jeff’s floor.<br />
<br />
Jeff then hears his door open and someone walks in, the teen is shocked when he finds himself being suddenly lifted into the air and is suddenly staring at the giant face of his sister, who has an evil grin on her face, even her eyes look evil, “hello, Jeff,” she says, “I must say: you really turned out amazing! I am certain you’ll love your new role in life, after all: this is why you have been born in the first place: to be nothing than more MY bra!”<br />
<br />
‘I’M A WHAT,’ Jeff mentally yells.<br />
<br />
Kim grimaces, “no need to shout… bra,” she says, then smirks, “I can hear you perfectly!”<br />
<br />
Even though it is not noticeable, since bras have no way of showing “emotions”, Kim senses Jeff’s confusion and shock,’stop calling me a “bra”! I am NOT a bloody bra! I am a 16 year-old human boy! And my name is Jeff!’<br />
<br />
Kim just giggles, “well, not anymore you aren’t,” she says.<br />
<br />
Jeff ignores Kim’s reply and instead asks, ‘I assume, by the way you are acting, that you have something to do with my… situation?’<br />
<br />
Kim grins, “you really are smart for a bra,” she says, giggling when she hears Jeff grumble.<br />
<br />
‘Okay… you had your fun,’ Jeff says, ‘now, transform me back!’<br />
<br />
“Nope,” Kim says, “you are much better and far more useful as you are right now, and I’m planning to keep you like this… at least, until I decide to change you into something else!”<br />
<br />
“What,” Jeff asks, “why?”<br />
<br />
Kim’s grin turns evil, “YOU and Max have both taken MY parents attention away from me,” the young woman says, “MY parents were supposed to only focus on ME!”<br />
<br />
‘What the hell are you talking about,’ Jeff asks, sounding confused, ‘me and Max haven’t done ANYTHING!’<br />
<br />
“Fine! Keep on denying what you have done,” Kim says, “at least, once I have also dealt with Max, MY parents will finally give me the attention I deserve!”<br />
<br />
‘Y-you are sick,’ Jeff says, ‘there is really something wrong with your fucked up mind! I demand you transform me back right now!’<br />
<br />
Kim just laughs manically, “HAHA! I told you: I will NOT,” she says, “from now on, you will be nothing but MY bra, until I decide to change you into something else! Hehe… I am your OWNER! You are nothing but an item, which is MADE to be worn! Hehe… you always wanted to get near to your girlfriends boobs, well… hehe… if you desire boobs so much, you WILL enjoy your new role!”<br />
<br />
Jeff is speechless, ‘how come neither of us realized how… broken you are,’ he asks.<br />
<br />
“Broken,” Kim asks, “me? Haha… no Jeff, I am NOT the one that is “broken”! YOU were the one that was broken and I fixed you: I gave you your true form! Hehe… sooner or later you WILL thank me! But for now, I am done listening to your whining,” and before Jeff is able to protest or argue any further, Kim cuts the link to her former brother, &quot;oh, yeah. If you are thinking that mom and dad will find out the truth: hehe... they never will! So, if I were you, I&#39;d simply accept my new role! Hehehe,&quot; she says, of course recieving no response, but the girl doesn&#39;t mind.<br />
<br />
Kim happily heads to her room, lying her new “bra” on her bed, before stripping out of her top and bra she had been wearing.<br />
<br />
“Time to try my new bra on,” she says with a happy smile, picking the “bra” up and slipping her arms through the straps, then fastening the “bra” behind her back. Kim turns to look at herself in her full length mirror, she grins, “damn, this “bra” is amazing,” she says, “it not only looks so good on me, it also makes my breasts seem larger! I am so happy with my “purchase”, they are also so nice and snug… and the silk is so soft!”<br />
<br />
Jeff is shocked when he sees himself strapped on his sister, feeling his sister’s breasts inside of him, ‘I can’t believe this shit,’ he thinks to himself, ‘this has to be a nightmare! I hope I’ll wake up soon!’<br />
<br />
Kim continues to smile at her reflection, “now, all I need are a pair of matching panties,” she says, “Max will do nicely! Hehe… I love the feeling of being soo powerful! I am able to do anything I want! Hehe… I’ll fix sooooo many people… give all oof them their true forms! After I dealt with Max, I’ll focus my attention on Jeff’s and Max’s friends! Those poor boys and girls… they always seem so miserable… hehe… but soon they’ll be happy, once I gave them their true forms!”<br />
<br />
Jeff is horrified as he is forced to listen to what his sister is planning, the teen already trying to come up with a plan to stop her, but he knows that she has won, because: what is a “bra” that is unable to talk and move on its own able to do?<br />
<br />
Kim looks down at her phone, which is lying on her bed, “you know,” she says, more to herself than to her “bra”, “the Chronivac is amazing and all, but… it’s so much work scanning the broken “items” before being able to “fix” them. I think the easiest way would be to give myself some transformation, hypnotic and body controlling powers! With unlimited powers like that, I could do so much good deeds! And I think it’ll be best, once I have my powers, too delete the program from Jeff’s Laptop! I don’t want anyone finding out the truth!”<br />
<br />
Jeff becomes more and more horrified, if he’s unable to stop her NOW, before she is able to do as she plans, then NO ONE will be able to stop her and save all of her victims! No one would ever know! With all his willpower, Jeff tries and tries to get control over his new body, or at least find some way of breaking free!<br />
<br />
Kim meanwhile is already walking towards Jeff’s room and Jeff is aware that he hasn’t got much time to try and stop his sister before she makes herself a… EVIL goddess!</p>
