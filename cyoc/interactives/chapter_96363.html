<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The afternoon sun shined into the classroom. Students in the back row, bored, slept, using their arms as pillows. Diligent students took notes, but it wasn’t like English class was too complex, so their note-taking was rather sparse and succinct. Jennifer yawned as the day nearly came to an end. Only one period left, gym, then the highlight of her day — cheerleading.<br />
<br />
She stretched as if protesting the teacher’s rather unexciting lecture. Suddenly, she felt constricted. She clenched her shirt, as if her heart ached. She bent down in pain, a throbbing pain which stabbed at her heart, but nobody seemed to notice. “Help… me,” she whimpered, her back arching down, her head below her desk.<br />
Jennifer tried kicking, pushing her desk into the next person in front of her, and even yelling—<br />
<br />
But to no avail.<br />
<br />
The girl felt her toes feel odd. She took off her shoes… only to see something pink replace her toes. Globs of liquid pooled onto the floor. “What’s happening to me!?” the cheerleader exclaimed. Nobody turned around as they listened to the teacher’s continuing lecture. The rest of the girl’s feet disappeared as the pink mass took over. It first went through the toes, the feet, the shin— it kept running up.<br />
<br />
Jennifer looked on in horror as she couldn’t do anything to stop it. She tried kicking off the pink liquid, only for it to stay in place. Only a few droplets splattered on the guy’s hair in front of her. She even tried punching it, but stopped immediately after feeling the punch as it landed on the goo. She realized that she was changing. Her ‘skin’ became slightly deformed after the punch, but Jenny arched her back as she felt something pierce straight through her… and somehow boosted her innate warmth.<br />
<br />
Skin and bone became slime as it raced up her legs and thigh, and Jennifer slowly slipped out of her chair and onto the floor as her legs melted into an amorphous blob. The girl tried picking herself up with her arms in panic, but the change quickly went through her waist, chest, and arms. She collapsed, with only her head intact. The rest of her clothes stewed within her slime.<br />
But that didn’t take long to disappear, either, as she felt warmth bust through her neck. Jennifer wildly tried to move any part of her body, but couldn’t. She could feel her brain dissipate, as she felt all sorts of different emotions randomly fluctuate within her. It was not long until her head could only face upwards, her face being the last part of her to liquefy.<br />
And then it was all dark — for a moment.<br />
<br />
A form was marked in her mind. It was a goal to reach. The status quo. The ideal that must be obtained. Jennifer felt as if her pile of flesh decided to reach that idealized form.<br />
First, her head returned. A lovely pink composed her head. Her features, soft and youthful, became human-shaped once more. Her hair flourished behind, gooey strips of hair dripping with slime. Her hair shook as she regained her neck, and she looked at everyone around her.<br />
<br />
Once again, the students paid no attention. Angry, Jennifer tried yelling — only to see bubbles and pink goop to drop out of her mouth, “Glrrr… Blar, glurble.”<br />
Her body continued to gain form, with thin arms, petite hands, enlarged and breasts thick with a gooey pink mesh. A red heart-shaped core came into existence as Jennifer tried to understand her circumstances.<br />
<br />
Her heart raced with relief as she saw her waist return — albeit a good deal thinner — along with decently large hips. She continued to move upwards as she reclaimed her form and even gained the strength to push her desk out of the way.<br />
<br />
Her hips curved very well, her ass heart-shaped. Her womanhood formed once again, and she erupted upwards with meaty thighs that curved along with the rest of her legs. In the end, her feet finally formed, nice and cute. Her clothes were still lodged in her body, but whatever, it was still progress.<br />
…But then, after taking but a step—<br />
<br />
She collapsed. Up until Jennifer’s mid-thighs, Jennifer’s body lost sense of structure. Her legs melted back into a blob of sorts. She repeatedly reformed her feet, but each time she took a step, her legs fell back into a glob of slime. Frustrated, she yelled “Glr! Glr! Grklrlrlr!” with pink goo slipping out of her mouth. A few students turned to watch.<br />
<br />
In the end, she gave up and began sliding about the room. The cheerleader found that she could slowly glide across the floor if she just willed it. She was about to find a way to return to her seat when she felt something inside her. Hands touched where her legs should have been, a strong tingling sensation that tried to make her buckle due to her sensitivity invaded her body. She turned to see her friend, Becky, looming down on her. It seemed that Jennifer was now a great deal shorter due to the issue with her legs. With a groan and whisper, Becky hoisted her atop the seat. “Be a good girl and don’t try to make legs.”<br />
<br />
“And with the theory explained, class has ended. Are you alright there, Becky, Jennifer?”<br />
<br />
“We’re alright,” Becky answered.<br />
<br />
“Good. If there’s anything I can do to help, just ask.” With that, the teacher left as students started packing up their bags. Some other students ran after the teacher asking questions. Boys stared at Jennifer as they walked out of the classroom.<br />
<br />
“Shoo, shoo,” Becky waves away the other students before focusing on the slime girl. “I know you want to have legs like everyone else, but it only ends up making a mess.” The girl takes out a large wipe from her bag and begins wiping the floor. “The goo, you see, you’re made of is filled with pheromones. It really attracts others and it’s very addicting to consume. So we can’t just leave it around. And how’d you get these clothes by the way? They’re no good anymore.”<br />
<br />
“Grlrlr! Arrlrlrlr!” Jennifer protested as Becky threw the clothes out.<br />
<br />
“But as long as you glide, there isn’t really any cleanup necessary. Your body is stronger, so it can keep the goo in it without leaving a mess wherever you go,” Becky continued. “Unless you want to go back to the stroller. A few shots and you’ll be right back in.”<br />
<br />
“Rlrlrlr…? Nealrlrlr…!?” the cheerleader exclaimed in surprise.<br />
<br />
“Yes, the stroller,” Becky placed threw the wipe away into the trash. “But if you’re a good girl, I’ll allow you to watch gym and cheerleading practice without it.”<br />
<br />
She could watch cheerleading practice. Watch. That means…<br />
<br />
“Arlrlrlrlryu? Gurrlra!? Larrghuullrla!”<br />
<br />
“Honestly, I have no clue what you’re saying. Here, we have to get to the next class,” Becky reaches out her hand. “What? Take it. I already said last time that if you try to make legs without your father’s approval, you would be punished. If not… do you want the stroller?”<br />
<br />
“Arululu…” Jennifer, standing one foot shorter than Becky, deflated as she took her friend’s hand.</p>
