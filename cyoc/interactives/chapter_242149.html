<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;...I turned into a replica of you, and you turned into a replica of me, with us only keeping our memories of being who we were before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha!&quot; your Mom scoffs off, &quot;what a silly wish Jake. Why would ever want to be me?&quot;<br />
<br />
As the words came off her lips and tongue, Mom immediately tried to fall back on the couch, making Penny hop off the couch and run away from the living room. You see her grabbing ahold of her stomach, and within a second&#39;s notice, you too start to feel immense stomach pain, making you hold your stomach as well. You start feeling like your organs are shrinking and rearranging themselves in a gruesome, painful way. Your body mass turns thinner, making your once masculine body type look feminine. At this time you also feel your body&#39;s bones crunching thin with an even more intense force, making you scream and wince in pain. You also feel the couch supporting more and more against your body, having only a flick of your head stick up above the seat.<br />
<br />
You get a short moment to breathe with quick grasps, looking over to your mom who grew bigger than you, with more muscle and bone mass. You hear Mom getting in between her breaths, &quot;What... the... URGG!&quot;<br />
<br />
You also start to scream with some pain, as your feet quickly crunch intensely inward, turning smaller and feeling more dainty. Your now small and more normal legs fatten up, forming on the calves and thighs. You can feel that leg fat push against each other and your crotch, while also on itself against the sofa seat and gravitating hard against the floor. Continuing its way upward, you feel a similar bone crack just above your butt, but this time way too minute to feel any pain, as it expands outward, readjusting your skin and now thighs to be farther away from themselves and crotch, feeling them be in their proper position. As you look down at your new, more dumpy legs, you start feeling the belly turn its curves well, as that leftover excess goes straight into more fat against the sofa, this time from your new, fuller butt. Touching your belly through your still unchanged shirt, feeling that new curvy structure, you could see your chest press inward and more narrow, leaving some big room between your semi-still lanky arms and broad shoulders. But luckily for you, those would be changed next, bringing your arms closer to your new thinner frame, and having your arms shorten to where your arms are just next to your femur bone. You also see your hands turn delicate, with softer palms, thin petite fingers and thumbs. Now feeling the impact turn back onto your chest, you start to sense your nipples turning hard, but not from being cold. Feeling them burning hot, you look down to start feeling them grow more and more plump against your body, realizing you are forming breasts without even having a bra. As it finishes that work, it goes back down and starts numbing your penis and testicles. Taking a grab against them, you feel them rapidly going back within your body, having nothing even to grab anymore, and feeling a slit formation take their place.<br />
<br />
During this whole process, you hear Mom softly cry as her body turns against her, likewise yours, as you look down to see a part of your new breasts sticking out against your shirt. But you start hearing Mom&#39;s voice go lower-pitched than her mature feminine voice, and you instead feel your Adam&#39;s apple grow smaller and less pronounced on your neck, feeling that new higher range within your vocal cords. And as your neck turned lighter and less expressed, you knew the last physical changes happening. You feel your head shape crack into a more perfect sphere, bringing your facial structure downward. Feeling your chin also turn less pronounced, you start to feel the force of blood flowing through your lips, making them take the attention from your chin with their fullness. Your cheeks lose their physique and your nose turns small and thin. Your eyebrows turn thin as the eyelashes turn thick, and your ears turn small and lobed against your head, with a couple of piercings on each ear. As you feel minor wrinkles form on your forehead along other areas of your body, you reach the final physical change. You bring your head inward, as your head pushes out new, luscious hair down to your new butt, which also shaded a darker brown and a few strands of gray.<br />
<br />
You now grab your new hair, feeling its&#39; soft and smooth texture against your new sense of feel through your hands. Looking to your left, you see Mom now staring with fear at herself. The once sweater and loose jeans were starting to look cramped on her, squishing her new bigger body build, but that was not the fuel of her sudden anxiety. Looking at your clothes, you also realize how ridiculous they look on you. Your shirt was touching and slightly flattened on the couch, and your legs and feet were within the denim of your jeans. Your pair of Converse were even sitting on the floor and you could feel your socks barely holding against your feet. As then, you immediately see the Converse dissipate and feel the socks on your feet no more, Looking at your now ridiculous clothes, they start to change themselves entirely. The once-long pants were simply shrinking up towards just above your new ankle joint, seeing some light purple nail paint on your toes. And your shirt now transforming into an entirely new sweater, the one you made your ring form up for Mom earlier, not fitting well against your body. You also feel your boxers turn more elastic and more around your hips, turning into basic briefs, as well as your new breasts now held up with some cupped bra. You then feel your face making additions, feeling some lipstick, blush, and mascara on your face.<br />
<br />
Now looking down, you definitely look like Mom just a moment ago, and your Mom looks like you a moment ago. Like a pure body switch, but you were handling it well, and she, well he, wasn&#39;t, with the same state of anxiety he was stuck up during this. One more thing hits you hard, however, your brain. You bend down and grab your brain through your hair, feeling an intense numbness washing through your mind. You suddenly start to lose everything you remembered, your friends, your education, your experiences, all of your memories were just flushed out of you, except for one thing. That you were once the seventeen-year-old boy named Jake. You whisper to yourself, &quot;Who am I?&quot; before being flashed back with a completely new set of memories. Being named Cecile, growing up with an above-average family, doing ballerina and some gymnastics as a little girl, dreaming of working in business, becoming a cheerleader and party girl during your high school years, getting knocked up by an attractive soccer player named Jack, Making an agreement to raise your child on your own with child support, giving birth to Jake, going into college with a degree in Finance while raising Jake, getting a well-paid job working for a state bank firm. All the memories Mom could have had, you were getting them through your mind. As that moment of headache pain goes away, you look up to the now Jake, and that Jake looking down at you, saying one three-lettered question.<br />
<br />
&quot;What just happened?&quot;</p>
