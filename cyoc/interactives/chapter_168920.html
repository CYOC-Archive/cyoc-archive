<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Oliver began jumping up and down in place, filled with childlike wonder and anxious anticipation over his fantastic idea for what felt like his first big wish.  He was so filled with such happy energy he ended up screaming his big wish &quot;I WISH ALL MY HOUSE&#39;S STUFFED ANIMALS CAME TO LIFE AND WERE MY PLAYMAAAAATES!!&quot;  And as soon as he said it, multicolored sparks like living fireworks shot out of his chest and split apart, flowing to every single stuffie in his two-story house with a basement and garage ( I know that was a bit forced, but no one else established Oliver&#39;s house&#39;s layout) and swirling around each of them, each individual spark giving each of them a bit more life and awareness.  His mouth was agape as he stared wide-eyed at the five stuffed friends that were coming to life the the living room adjoining the kitchen.  The first of the five to stir to life was a grey straight-eared rabbit wearing a black bow-tie, white satin gloves on his dexterous hand-paws,  and black vest with buttons, two of which were buttoned near where vest met his collarbone area (not that a stuffed animal has a collarbone, but I think you get the idea), and a gold fob watch tucked into his vests right breast pocket that would he would presumably check on every once in a while to make sure he is keeping all his appointments.  The bunny butler sprung to his feet and began to hop his way towards young Olly at measured, dignified pace.  He stood in front of the boy, a good head taller than him and began to mine a coughing gesture with his right hand-paw as his left was held behind his back. <br />
 The next stuffed friend to come to life was situated on the couch sitting across from his big 75 inch 4K HDTV, it was a round green frog with blue overalls and long noodly limbs, a plastic slingshot sitting in the overalls back pocket, two bulging white googly eyes situated on the front of his body over the nostrils that adorned his tiny pointed amphibious snout, and a big toothy grin that ran across his whole face from ear-hole to ear-hole, with a tiny bit of his long tongue sticking out his mischievous grins left side.  The frog began jumping up and down, holding his arms wide across his ball shaped body like he was doing jumping jacks.  Then he jumped to the ground and fell into his side and rolled his way towards Oliver and sat in front of him, cross legged as he used his long noodly limbs to make broad pointing gestures towards his perma-grin.  Olly could swear he heard the frog make muffled &quot;hmphing&quot; noises as it frantically pointed at it&#39;s face.  <br />
On the other side of the couch was an orange stripped anthro cat with square sunglasses like Ray Bans, a leather bomber jacket looking and a orangish blond pompadour haircut.  As soon as it came to life it make magically brought out a comb and hair gel that seemed to appear out of nowhere and run the comb through it&#39;s hair.  It then did a backflip off the couch onto the hardwood floor facing Oliver and did double fingergun motions to the kid, making Olly spontaneously giggle at the cool cat.<br />
  By the entryway to the kitchen sat the fourth of Oliver&#39;s stuffed friends, a grey raccoon with red t-shirt with a picture of a metal garbage can on the front and no pants.  The raccoon wasted no time to use his dexterous hand paws to open his kitchen cabinet, and climb up to the third row where Oliver&#39;s family keeps the small bags of brand name flavored potatoe chip bags.  As soon as it opens it, he sadly lowers his head and begins to sulk when it realizes it can&#39;t open it&#39;s mouth to eat the tasty junk food.<br />
  And the last of his stuffed friends to come to life was the biggest of all of them, a stuffed strawberry colored kangaroo that was about the size of a real one with dexterous hand-paws, a real working pouch that a small child could fit in, and small black witch hat laying on top of her head, which also sported long red hair that ran down to her neck.  She sniffed the air, looked at Olly, then looked to the baby supplies that were still situated near the houses front door.  She smiled and picked up a container of baby wipes, powder, and a pack of diapers then stuffed them in her pouch and she hopped over to Oliver.  When she got Oliver&#39;s side of the room she began to hold her big circular nose with her thumb and forefinger and make playful broad waving motions with her other arm.  <br />
It was then Oliver realized he forgot one crucial detail when he made his earlier wish &quot;Oh yeah!  I guess I shoulda said I wish you all could talk, huh?&quot;. And as soon as he finished his sentence they all began to magically open their previously sewn tight mouths to cheer and clap sincerely for him, causing the boy to blush as he shyly scratched the back of his head, lowering his eyes so he can avoid direct the contact from his cheering new friends.  &quot;Allow us to introduce ourselves, master Oliver&quot; , said the rabbit butler.  &quot;I am Jeeves, your gentleman&#39;s gentlemen!  Or rather, your gentlebunnies, gentlebunny.&quot;  &quot; I&#39;m Billy-Bob from down by the bayou!  Y&#39;all will have great time playin&#39; wit&#39; me, I gau-ron-tee that.&quot;, Said the round frog with a cartoonist Cajun accent.  &quot;I&#39;m Johnny B. Goode the coolest cat that ever rode a motorcycle!  Speaking of which, did you get the wheel adjusted on my cool mini-Harley yet?  I&#39;m supposed ta take Sally to make-out point Friday night, and I needs my wheels to do that!  Aaayyyyee!&quot;.  &quot;Why does he keep pointing his finger guns at me when finishes speaking?  Wait, is he talking about Sally, my elderly next door neighbors mini-poodle?&quot;. The raccoon walked up to Oliver as he was lost in thought, he then snapped his fingers to get the boy&#39;s attention.  &quot; Hey focus kiddo, I needs yah help wit somethin&#39;!  No matter how hard I try to stuff dese delicious chips down my gullet, said dumb things just seem to crumble an&#39; break up rather den dem goin&#39; down inta my tummy like dere supposed ta!  Da names Ricky, by th way. &quot;. &quot;Oh, OK.  Um... I wish that .... Um... Oh!  I wish that Ricky and all my stuffed animal friends could eat like regular people of they want to, even though they can&#39;t go potty like me!&quot;   &quot;Eeeeww!  Eeeyuw!  And I would certainly not want ta &quot; go potty&quot; like yew, cause den I be walking&#39; wit&#39; my crudder b&#39;tween my legs!  Tanks for the chips, friendo. &quot;. Oliver began blushing and looking down at his feet with shame.  &quot;Now, now, Ricky, you shouldn&#39;t say stuff like that to little Olly!  He&#39;s only four years old and he&#39;s still learning!&quot;. Said a sweet, motherly voice.  &quot; Up here sweety! &quot;. Oliver looked up at the Kangaroo with a witch&#39;s hat and realized she might actually be BIGGER than a real kangaroo.  &quot;My name is Kirsti the Kangaroo witch in-training and I&#39;m here to make sure little joey&#39;s like you don&#39;t want for anything while their parents are away.&quot;  She said as she bent down closer to his level with her hands on her pouch.  &quot;And speaking of tending to someone&#39;s needs, let Kirsti take care of that stinky mess for you.  Abra-cadiaper!&quot;. Suddenly Oliver was lifted in the air by neon-green sparkles, his diaper was then un-tapered from his side, then folded, and then he was wiped by baby wipes that seemed to appear from nowhere in one swift clean motion, his rear was powdered by a cylinder of baby powder that seemed to appear out of nowhere, and then a new pull-up was lifted up in between his legs.  As soon as the sparkles let him down he ran to the &#39;Roo with an excited look in his eye and said &quot;Whoa!  How&#39;d you do that!&quot; as he bounced a tiny bit up and down, his tiny fists pumping excitedly with the rhythm of his body.  &quot;I&#39;m magic too, sweetheart.  I&#39;m a witch in training, and anything I put in my pouch can become an ingredient of component of a spell.  Though I&#39;m still working out all my spells and rhyming schemes.&quot; She said with a slight blush. <br />
 Suddenly Oliver&#39;s eyes felt very heavy.  Maybe it was the big wish, maybe it was eating that whole tub of ice cream, maybe it was both, but suddenly his tiny body was exhausted.  He let a big yawn.  &quot;Oh my!  Do you need to take a nap, sweetheart?</p>
