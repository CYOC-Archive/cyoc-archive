<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">	Cael’s description of what needed to be done as ‘a little farm work’ soon proved to be a harsh understatement. There was nearly a mountain of firewood to be stacked (“We just cleared half an acre of forest to make room for adding a few extra heads to the herd,” Cael explained), and the wall around the grazing field likewise needed to not just be mended, but also extended by a few yards.<br />
<br />
	“No worries, you’ll be just fine, city boy,” Cael called over as he easily hefted at least two dozen thick logs into his arms and hauled them around the back of the farmhouse to the woodpile. “Just take it easy at first, figure out what you can handle and go from there. You’ll know when you hit your limit...”<br />
<br />
	Alex, for what it was worth, was starting to trust Cael to know what to do. He figured the big orcblood wouldn’t have drugged him with something dangerous, especially if he was genuine in his offer to pay Alex for doing farm work. Alex ran his hand over his inflated bicep, a little grin forming in the corner of his lips as he saw clearly every single muscle twitch as he flexed it. The warmth that he had felt when he had drank the vigor potion began to build again in his arm when he tested his new muscles, focused most strongly in his bicep bit spreading farther into his shoulder and down toward the middle of his back.<br />
<br />
	“Alright, Cael… Let’s see if this really works…” Alex murmured, feeling suddenly much more confident now that he filled out his borrowed clothes a little better. He reached out and grabbed a log, seeing his hands had grown a bit larger to better match his larger body, then he quickly balanced one log after the next in his arms until they were piled nearly to his chin level. He’d stopped counting after fifteen logs, and since they were cut from the huge trees in the surrounding forest, each log was thicker than his leg, making them considerably heavier than Alex had expected.<br />
<br />
	And yet, despite the weight, Alex barely felt winded at all. Sure, they were heavy in his arms, but rather than feeling exhaustion building in his muscles, he just felt more and more of that lovely warmth up his arms and down his back and legs.<br />
<br />
	“Well, well, what happened to that city boy?” Cael laughed as Alex caught up and heaved his armload of wood onto the pile. “Starting to see how the potion works now? It makes you stronger, sure, but mostly it just keeps your muscles from getting tired.”<br />
<br />
	“It’s great!” Alex shouted, unable to contain his excitement. “I’ve never felt like this my whole life, Cael! Hell, you don’t even need to pay me, just give me another bottle of that stuff!”<br />
<br />
	“We always pay our workers at this ranch. In coin, too, not potions,” Cael replied coolly. “...You’ve really never had vigor potion before? At your age? I figured everyone experimented with it a little bit…”<br />
<br />
	“Um… I-I’m not really from around here, so I guess I’ve never come across any…” Alex stammered, quickly making an excuse for his lack of knowledge about seemingly ordinary aspects of life.<br />
<br />
	Cael raised an eyebrow at that, his lower lip curling suspiciously and revealing another inch or so of his enlarged lower teeth. “...Fine then. If you say so,” he finally said before returning to the work.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
	A few trips back and forth to the woodpile later, they’d managed to stack enough wood to last for nearly the entire year, plus a bit extra that Cael’s family could sell in town if they needed to. With that finished, Cael beckoned Alex to follow him toward the forest.<br />
<br />
	“Riverside’s down this way, there’s usually plenty of big stones there that’ll work to mend the wall,” he explained, putting one hand to his ear and listening closely. “...No werewolves. You can usually hear ‘em barking and moaning for miles when they’re fucking. And they’re usually fucking. Main reason we gotta get the wall fixed up, since they’ve got a nasty habit of breaking into the barn to screw each other. Takes weeks to get the smell out…”<br />
<br />
	Alex bit his lip and kept quiet hearing that, although he felt a twinge of arousal as he thought back to the wolves he’d seen mating earlier. “They’re not… dangerous, right?” Alex asked as they made it to the small river and Cael started to dislodge a few big rocks from the riverbank.<br />
<br />
	“Define ‘dangerous’. If you mean ‘are they gonna try to eat any of my farm’s bulls’ then no. If you mean are they gonna try to pick a fight with a big orcblood like me, then also no,” Cael grunted, unearthing a small boulder the nearly size of his torso from the ground. “But, if you mean, are they gonna look at a city boy like you and see easy prey to screw and try to make into their new packmate…”<br />
<br />
	“...I suppose the answer to that one’s ‘yes’?” Alex said nervously, glancing around to the surrounding woods.<br />
<br />
	“Yes. But, I wouldn’t worry too much. Werebeasts usually keep those instincts in check. It’s only during rutting season that they get a little unpredictable.”<br />
<br />
	“Great. I’ll just assume that rutting season isn’t for a while. To keep myself from going insane with worry,” Alex sighed, bending down and gripping the rock that Cael had dug up. Feeling the vigor potion’s warmth building in his legs and back, he lifted with all his strength, slowly hefting the boulder up and steadying himself to support it.<br />
<br />
	“...You think you can handle that one? You still gotta haul it back to the farm, you know,” Cael warned, although he was honestly quite impressed how well the young man was handling a stone that probably weighed as much as Alex had before taking the potion.<br />
<br />
	“Quit. Talking. And get out… of the… way…” Alex grunted through gritted teeth as he started to haul the massive stone back out of the woods while Cael laughed and grabbed an equally heavy rock. Once he was a little over halfway back to the farm, Alex was beginning to regret his decision. The gentle warmth in his muscles was starting to grow hotter, like a bonfire that had grown just a bit too large, but he tried to ignore it as he was still able to keep moving without slowing his pace thanks to the magical effects of the potion.<br />
<br />
	Just as he finally reached the spot in the wall that would need to be mended, he (just as Cael had warned) reached his limit. The combined warmth in his entire body surged downward toward and his dick stiffened to be just as rock-hard as the stones he was hauling, pressing itself almost painfully into his borrowed trousers and leaking a dark spot of precum across the front. The white-hot warmth found a spot to settle right in his prostate, sending blasts of pure electric pleasure echoing throughout his whole body as the heat built up and waned in seemingly random waves. Alex managed to hold on long enough to put the rock he was holding safely on the ground, then with a final groan he felt his cock twitch and unleash a torrent of cum down his leg to ooze down into the boots Cael had loaned him.<br />
<br />
	“Too… much…” Alex panted breathlessly as the heat dissipated from his prostate and once again found a place in his muscles. He heard Cael approaching from behind him and quickly straightened himself up, glancing down and hoping the big orcblood wouldn’t spot the damp stain across the inside leg of his pants.<br />
<br />
	Of course, even an quarter-blooded orc had a much more sensitive nose than the average human, and Cael just grinned his tusky grin as he set down his own stones alongside Alex’s.<br />
<br />
	“Enjoying the ‘work’?” Cael chuckled slyly. He knew first-hand exactly what happened if a person pushed themselves too far on the vigor potion; like a tree branch under too much pressure, all that pent-up energy would have to get out somewhere. Casual users of the potion knew quite well that trying to go beyond their personal limit would almost inevitably lead to a truly mind-blowing orgasm, and nothing could ever compare to their first time taking the potion.<br />
<br />
	“...Not a word, Cael. I mean it…” Alex sighed as he wiped off his leg as best he could, still a bit buzzed in the afterglow of his massive climax. “Roy’s got extra clothes I can borrow, right?”<br />
<br />
	In a huff, Alex stomped back down to the riverbank, deciding to take it a little easier for the next couple trips back and forth, if only to avoid making a complete mess of himself in front of Cael…</p>
