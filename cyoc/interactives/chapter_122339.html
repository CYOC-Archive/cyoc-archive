<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The lineman automatically handed him the gun, and the coach nodded at him in happy satisfaction. &quot;Now what position do you like playing?&quot; The player shouted &quot;lineman!&quot; Almost to the rooftops! Coach laughed and said &quot;I can see your excited about playing lineman, but would you like to be like Bullowski? Or do you want to be even bigger then him?&quot; The lineman looked nervous when he answered, saying &quot;coach I love Bullowski, but I&#39;d like to be 4x his size one day! But that&#39;s not possible? He&#39;s been genetically altered with a bulls sperm to get that big!&quot; The coach laughed and began fooling with the gun.<br />
<br />
When he finished, he chuckled and said &quot;son I&#39;m about to make your wish come true! Get ready to be my biggest lineman on the team, even bigger then 4 Bullowski put together!&quot; And with a flash, the player was soaked in light! He felt it in ever poor of his body, like he was being soaked in something! &quot;Wooh! Coach that was weird!&quot; The coach laughed and told him to look in the mirror. His uniform clanked and shook as he walked, and when he looked in the mirror he saw why! His whole uniform was practically swallowing him, from being so oversized! &quot;Coach, whatcha do to my uniform!?&quot; He said as he looked at his waste size &quot;waste 110&quot; he was astonished! A 110 waste! He&#39;d never fit! <br />
<br />
As he checked himself out another sensation took over, almost a fullness like eating a large thanksgiving dinner. He rubbed his tummy, burping, as coach stood back and watched in enjoyment! &quot;Ooooh! Coach I&#39;m so full I could burst out of my pants!&quot; The player said, as his gut rumbled and began to rise and overlap more. His arms began to shake and grow, swelling up like his tummy, and soon his waste and legs took the same speed! His shoulders and chest began to barrel and swell, his pecs beginning to sag down and look powerful, almost like breasts. His neck and traps, along with his shoulders, began to widen as well, pushing his uniform around, filling it in more and more.<br />
<br />
All the time the player just kept feeling his expanding tummy, not seeing any of the muscle growth. Every so often his uniform rattled less, as more of his body filled it up, and soon his weight was at 500lbs. He walked towards the coach, his thighs and ass practically the size of two basketballs with a crack, and tried to reach him for help. &quot;Don&#39;t worry son! You&#39;ll feel full for a while, but that&#39;s what happens when you eat 4 chicken roasters and 3 pounds of potatoes!&quot; The player looked confused, until his memories began to get effected. &quot;Oh yeah! I did, but coach, it feels so full! Will it ever stop groaning?&quot;<br />
<br />
By this time his pads and uniform barely rattled, his new form filling it in nicely. His face filled out becoming slightly obese looking, his chest now huge under the breast plate of his pads, and his helmet now starting to just fit snug. And yet his body still grew, even though he exceeded 890lbs at this point. He slowly walked, then waddled, then a step at a time, towards the coach. &quot;I feel funny? I suppose to be dis big?&quot; He said, his iq the same as Bullowski now. &quot;Yeah son! Your body grows from the food! Just relax and stand there, let it do its magic!&quot; And he put his hand on the huge pads, barely even covering a part of them. By this time his ass and thighs were so wide, they were ready to burst outa his size 110 waste pants! His stomach overlapping to the point he couldn&#39;t even see his legs, that is if he could see his stomach with the monstrous chest he now had! His huge grilled face now had a blank expression, as he stood there, the cement cracking under his now 1,000lb weight.<br />
<br />
Finally it stopped at 1,200lbs and the equipment he wore groaned and creaked with all the pressure this behemoth now pushed onto it with his body. A loud pop came over the locker room, followed by some snaps, and the lineman gasped! &quot;I gone popped! Help coach! Don&#39;t let me spill out!&quot; The coach laughed as he unstrapped the breast plate that had its straps snap, and undid the buttons on his pants. He was just lose laces now, and his gut spilled out even more, the weight almost tipping him. &quot;Danks coach! I thouts I pop!&quot; The coach just helped him walk out the double doors, giving him a few shoves since he no longer fit them without getting stuck on his ass or gut. &quot;Chief, you are my biggest player yet, now go play with your brother bull out there!&quot; He gleefully slowly waddled to his new brother, the two of them wrestling each other, and sharing another 20 sandwiches they packed.</p>
