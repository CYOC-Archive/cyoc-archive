<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sound of a key turning in the door leading out of the kitchen to the garage told the now transformed Oscar and Lindsay where the people who where about to come into the darkened house was coming from. The sound of footsteps told them there was only two of them but the scents where unknown to Oscar, he could smell the remains of scents from Lindsay’s sister/roommates so he knew it wasn’t them.<br />
“It’s my mom and dad.” Whispered Lindsay “Hide.”<br />
They moved a lot quieter then they could have as a human and they had no cloths to pick up either, so within moments they had moved into the shadows of the darkened living room. It was then that the back door opened and from the shadows Oscar could see two people entered. <br />
One was an older woman in her late 40’s maybe early 50s, she was fit for her age and looked like an older version of Lindsay. Her red hair wasn’t as bright as her daughters with a few grey hairs he could see and she looked to be a little taller and heavier in the chest area but no where near the size of her oldest daughter. She wasn’t as thin nor as fit as her daughter but still looked damn good for her age. <br />
Behind her walked in a man about the same age, he was taller with blonde hair the same shade as Barbara and he muscular but one could see that he had some fat along his belly. It wasn’t a beer belly more like a six pack with a covering of fat from age over it. <br />
“Lindsay! Barbara!” yelled Lindsay’s mom<br />
“They may be out.” Answered her father “Neither of them are answering their phones. I just hope they don’t come back drunk.”<br />
“Lindsay would never drink underage.” Said her mother as her father rolled his eyes. <br />
“Sure, like you and I didn’t do that when we where her age.” Stated her father as her mother playfully slapped his chest. “Why don’t you go out and see if you can use some of the tools to figure out why the car is making that sound.”<br />
“Sure.” Said her father before wrapping his arms around his wife’s back and squeezing her ass. “Or we could do something else.”<br />
“You…” said her mom in a playful tone “I don’t want to explain to our daughters or worse our daughters’ friends why we are having sex in the house they rent from us.”<br />
“True.” Said her father with some annoyance as he kissed her and headed back out the door to the garage.  <br />
“Stay low.” Whispered Lindsay as the two of them crouch down while her mother got herself a bottle of water from the fridge. She opened it and while taking a drink from it, walked toward the living room. She flipped on the light with one hand while the other held the water. <br />
It was at that moment Lindsay stuck, with speed which would have been impossible as a human she darted out of the darkness. Her mother had just enough time for her eyes to widen in confusion and in fear before Lindsay sank her teeth into her mother’s neck. She tried to let out a scream, but Oscar had only been a second or two behind Lindsay and got there in time to cover the older woman’s mouth, while the other hand grabbed her. Lindsay didn’t bite down long but drew a lot of blood from the wound but as Lindsay pulled away the wound sealed up leaving no sign it had ever been there aside from the blood dripping off her neck. As the wound healed there was a slight glow from the back of her mother’s neck and then she began to change. <br />
Fur began to ripple across her body starting around the bite area, it was a grayish red tone and lacked any spots like her cheetah daughter. She grew in height and in size, her muscles seamed to get bigger as claws tipped her fingers, the fronts of her shoes split open as claws poked out. <br />
As her face began to push out into a muzzle, she was no longer struggling so Oscar removed his hand and his grip from her and stepped back as did Lindsay and watched. Lindsay’s mom purred/moaned a bit as she grew in size, the grey top she had been wearing was now too tight on her body and using her claws she ripped it off. Seeing his girlfriend’s mom strip before him should have freaked him out but it didn’t, maybe that was part of whatever he had become. He noticed that white fur covered her breasts which where now freed as she pulled off her bra and then ripped off her blue jeans as a long powerful tail grew out of her tailbone. She was not a cheetah like her daughter but instead a cougar, she ran her hands down her knew body and let out a deep purr. <br />
“Mom….you look wonderful.” Said Lindsay as she rushed forward and hugged her now transformed mother.<br />
“Lindsay…what is this? Why do I feel so good?” inquired her mother as she pulled her daughter close while her tail wrapped her up from behind.<br />
“We aren’t sure, but I just had to.” Started Lindsay <br />
“Had to share this gift with your mother.” Said her mother, the same instinct to spread this gift was now within her when a moment before she would have screamed to remain human. “I understand but let’s get your father before he walks back in here and we have some trouble.”<br />
With that they broke apart and moved into the kitchen and out into the garage it was all too easy. Her father had his back to them and never noticed under his wife’s new fangs bit into her neck that there was any threat. Oscar closed the garage door even as the transformation washed over Lindsay’s father. He had expected that since Lindsay was a cheetah that her father would be a cheetah as well, however that was not what happened. His body did not lean out to a frame built for speed, instead it got more muscular as blondish fur grew over his body. There were a few spots but not that many, the major change came with his ears being very pointed with tuffs of fur at the end. <br />
When it was done, Lindsay’s father looked even stronger, like able to be a professional boxer stronger, he did not seem to have grown in height <br />
“Well, I like this.” Said her mother as she ran her hand down her husband’s new muscles. “Can’t wait to test them out.”<br />
“Same here.” Answered her father as one of his hands brushed his cougar wife’s larger breasts.<br />
“Mom dad, we have some explaining to do.” Said Lindsay as she brought attention to her.<br />
“You do, first who is that.” Said her father pointing at Oscar, “Where is your sister and what happened to us?”</p>
