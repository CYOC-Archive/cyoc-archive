<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie paused as she began to think about her relationship with Josh. She enjoyed being with him and thought she might be falling in love with him, unfortunately her childish instincts could not comprehend what love was supposed to feel like. The tug of war between the adult knowledge and her childish instincts was maddening. Katie now considered doing something she had only done with her girlfriends, share the knowledge of the ring. Part of her told her that if she truely cared about Josh she would share her secrets while the more mature part of her told her to keep her secret.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Josh,&quot; she said cautiously. &quot;What if I told you I was a little younger than 21?&quot; Josh looked down at her with a curious look on her face. &quot;Are you trying to tell me your not 21?&quot; He asked. &quot;You are in college right, I mean your not a senior in high school are you cause if that&#39;s the case I don&#39;t thnk we can have a relationship.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No I&#39;m 21,&quot; she said quickly. &quot;I&#39;m a senior in college....I&#39;m just asking a hypothetical question. What if I wasn&#39;t what would you think.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh continued to look at the 21 year old beauty whose head was resting in his lap. &quot;Well you seem like a nice girl,&quot; he said. &quot;And you are cute, I guess I could deal with it.....hypothetically speaking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie sighed and stared around the park, she was trying to think of a way to explain the ring without totally freaking him out. She sighed as nothing came to mind deciding her best option would be to just tell him the truth. &quot;Josh,&quot; she said tentatively. &quot;What if I told you I could control my age. Not just my age but the age of other people as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d say that sounds pretty wild,&quot; he said. &quot;Cool but very wild. Katie what&#39;s with these weird questions what are you trying to tell me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie bit her lip and looked at Josh with a worried look. &quot;Josh...I can control people&#39;s ages. Not that long ago I was a little girl then I met you and now....well I like you and well I, I want to tell you the truth about me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh laughed and looked at Katie. &quot;Yeah okay Katie,&quot; he chuckled. &quot;And yesterday I was a kid too. You know your a little weird sometimes, I kind of like that. You wouldn&#39;t happen to be into role play or some other kinky stuff would you cause I&#39;ve always wanted to date someone who was into that kind of stuff,&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie gave Josh a confused look. She was still naive when it came to things of a kinky nature. She decided that it would be best not the ask about it but instead show Josh what she was talking about. Glancing around the park she noticed an elderly couple sitting on a park bench. &quot;Look I&#39;ll show you,&quot; she said. &quot;You see that elderly couple sitting on the bench over there, watch as I make them younger.&quot; Katie then made a wish for the couple to become children again.<br />
<br />
Josh chuckled and looked towards the elderly man and woman sitting on the bench. Josh now thought about how he always seemed to fall for the weirdest girls. Katie seemed really nice but the age stuff was a little weird for him. As he looked at the couple he guessed they were probably close to 80. The woman&#39;s grey hair was up in a bun while the man&#39;s thinning grey hair was cut short in a style that made him think of the forties.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Katie,&quot; he chuckled. &quot;Ill humor you. What exactly am I looking for.&quot; &quot;Just watch okay,&quot; she said. &quot;In a minute you should really start seeing some changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh watched the couple closely. Nothing seemed to be happening at first but after a few moments he thought he noticed something. The elderly couple seemed to be a little bit more refreshed than before. The couple looked closer to 60 than 80. As Josh continued to watch he was amazed at what he saw. Brown hair was beginning to creep into the mans hair while the woman&#39;s hair began to turn black and come loose from its bun. The couple looked closer to 50 now looking like middle aged adults instead of senior citizens. &quot;Katie,&quot; he said with concern. &quot;Are you seeing what I&#39;m seeing.&quot; Katie shushed him as they continued to watch the couple regress.<br />
<br />
The couple left their fifties and reentered their forties. Most of the grey on their hair had been replaced by their natural hair color. Their faces had smoothed so that most of the wrinkles had vanished. The couple now removed their glasses and rubbed their eyes as they could see better without them. As the couple entered their thirties all of the grey vanished and their faces became smooth. Both of their bodies began to firm as they regained loss muscle tone. Josh noticed the woman&#39;s double c up breasts rise under her clothes. A couple looked at eachother and gave eachother a tender kiss.<br />
<br />
The couple continued to kiss as they reentered their twenties. Now newly weds with renewed vigor the reached his hand behind the woman&#39;s back give her butt a squeeze. The now 25 year old woman&#39;s body jerked in response as she looked seductively at her 25 year old husband. The two then began passionately kissing again as they re-entered college. <br />
<br />
As they began reliving college in reverse the two young lovers began to become more aggressive in their make out session. When they reentered their teens Josh and Katie began to notice changes in their bodies. The man was beginning to lose sme of the muscle he had redeveloped during his regression while the woman was losing the mature curves of college. When the two young lovers broke their embrace for air the two were little more than high school seniors. Their faces were smooth and young, the woman&#39;s raven colored hair now descended down to the middle of her back while the mans hair had re grown and appeared shaggy. The two once again embraced eachother as they began the to relive high school in reverse.<br />
<br />
Josh stared dumbstruck at the teenage couple making out in front of him. The couple were reliving puberty in reverse gradually losing height and the assets of puberty, before long the two high school freshman stopped vigorously making out with eachother and stared at eachother awkwardly. Most of the mans muscle ten had been wiped away leaving him a skinny teen of 14 while the girl was an innocent looking girl with a pretty face, wide eyes and small b cup breasts. As the two left high school and reentered junior high their kissing became less aggressive and more innocent. Josh watched as the couple left their teens and became 12. For a moment the boy was shorter than the girl who leaned her head on his shoulder tenderly. The couple continued to hold hands as they became 11. Their heights were now the same and they gave eachother an innocent peck on the lips before blushing slightly. Finally the regression stopped at 10. The two children now hopped off the bench in their over sized clothing and began walking towards the swing set in the park. Josh watched as the couple mingled with some of the other children at the park. The two now played innocently with the other kids. To Josh&#39;s amazement no one seemed to notice the ill fitting clothes the two wore, to everyone else in the park things seemed perfectly normal.<br />
<br />
Josh stared in awe at what he had just seen. He would not of believed it if he had not seen it with his own eyes. Now he looked at Katie in amazement and silence.<br />
<br />
Katie could see the look of wonder in Josh&#39;s face and hoped she had not frightened him. She sat with baited breath as she waited for his response.</p>
