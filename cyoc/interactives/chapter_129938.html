<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the day began to wind down Kellie now found herself in Ms. Morgan’s English class. Kellie remembered this class fondly as it was one of the few classes that her and her friends all attended. As she entered the classroom she could see Katie’s friends towards the back of the room. Kellie was surprised to see that both Kumiko and Lisa were both in this class as well. Smiling politely and waving she made her way towards the group with her friends.<br />
<br />
“So how’s the first day going,”Lisa asked. Kellie shrugged as she gazed around the room. “Okay so far,” she said. “Katie has been a big help.”<br />
<br />
“That’s my sis for ya always the happy helper.”<br />
<br />
“Knock it off Lisa,” Katie giggled. As the girls now laughed and talked Kellie glanced around the room. Quickly she noticed a lone figure sitting by herself in the front of the room. Mary Elise was sitting quietly at her desk, not engaging anyone in the class in conversation. As Kellie scanned the room she could see Sebastian was not here, Mary Elise was alone and judging by her body language very unhappy. Kellies heart felt like it was breaking as she looked at the miserable introverted teen.<br />
<br />
In the previous reality Kellie remembered how the two had been close friends. While Kellies best friend had been Katie, Mary Elise was a clear second. The girl had previously been a very kind and friendly girl. As Kellie looked at her now she was amazed how much she had changed. Mary Elise now looked like a miserable person that seemed to loathe the other students around her. Her previous best friend, Claudia, would not even give her the time of day. Kellie wondered now what had happened to change things so much. “By screwing up reality did I destroy Mary’s friendship with Claudia,” she thought. Almost on instinct Kellie now found herself walking towards Mary Elise.<br />
<br />
“Hey where’s the new girl going,” Samantha  asked. The girls turned to see Kellie walking towards Mary Elise. “Hey Kellie come here,” Katie called quickly. Curiously Kellie turned and made her way back to the girls. “What’s up,” she asked. The girls now gave Kellie an odd look. “Why were going to talk with Mary,” Kumiko asked. Kellie gave the girls a look of surprise, noticing the disdain on their faces. “Just wanted to say hi to that girl,” she said confused. “Is that so wrong.”<br />
<br />
“Misery over there isn’t the nicest person around,” Lisa grunted. “She’s kind of a weirdo too. Trust us your probably better off not knowing her.”<br />
<br />
Kellie gasped as she looked at the girls. The group obviously had a lot of animosity towards Mary Elise. Considering how close the girls had been previously it was a complete shock. “She seems okay to me,” Kellie muttered. “So what exactly is her deal.”<br />
<br />
The girls looked at eachother somewhat annoyed to be talking about Mary Elise. It was finally Claudia who decided to speak up. “We um used to hangout a bit back in grade school,” she whispered. “But then something changed with her in junior high.” Claudia now trailed off as she lowered her head.<br />
<br />
“What changed,” Kellie asked.<br />
<br />
Clauida just hung her head sadly as the girls looked at her sadly. “Misery over there thought she was such hot stuff,” Lisa said through gritted teeth. “She got in a fight with Claudia here. Beat her up pretty good too, never did find out what it was about. All I know is she just started acting mean and stopped talking with everyone.”<br />
<br />
Kellie shook her head, that made no sense to her what so ever. Mary Elise was always so levelheaded, why would she get in a fight with Claudia of all people. Turning to Katie for answers she now gave her a pleading look. Katie shrugged as she looked at Kellie. “Honestly I don’t know,” she shrugged. “Mary Elise mostly talked with Claudia and Mika when we were growing up . They pretty much just grew apart.”<br />
<br />
Kellie shook her head sadly as she now stood. “Well I’m still going to talk with her,” turning Kellie now strode over towards Mary Elise, trying to ignore the looks of disdain the girls now gave to Kellie. <br />
<br />
As Kellie approached Mary Elise she could see the auburn haired teen quietly looking at a book of poetry. “Hi,” she said meekly. Mary Elise turned slightly as she frowned up at Kellie. “Hey,” she muttered. Kellie stood awkwardly looking at her trying to decide what to say. “Umm anyone sitting here,” she asked motioning towards the empty desk. Mary Elise shrugged as she dimly looked at it. “Not yet,” she mumbled. Kellie took this as an opening and no what sat next to Mary Elise.<br />
<br />
“I’m Kellie,” she said. “Kellie Pendragon.” Mary Elise raised an eyebrow as she looked at Kellie. “Mary Elise McKinnon,” she said. “Interesting last name, is that old English?”<br />
<br />
“Ummm Yeah,” Kellie blushed. The two teens now sat in silence as theysnearched for words, it was finally Mary Elise who broke it. “So what brings you over here,” she muttered. “Aren’t you with the them.” Kellie turned to look back as Mary Elise gestured towards Katie and her friends. The girls all had looks of disgust as they looked at Kellie and Mary Elise. Kellie felt herself flush, not realizing the animosity between the girls. “Ummm Katie is showing me around today,” She stammered. “She seems okay. How come you don’t like them.”<br />
<br />
“She’s the only decent one in the group,” Mary Elise spat. “The rest of them are just a bunch of manipulative fake bitches. That sister of hers Lisa is a bully, so’s Kumiko. Samantha is just a giant clod they keep around to intimidate everyone. Mika and Claudia are just manipulative little bitches, those two put on an act like their all innocent but deep down their bullies too. They just fool everyone into thinking their nice.”<br />
<br />
Kellie gaped in shock as she’s listened to Mary Elise spew venom about her former friends. Mary Elise now turned as she looked at Kellie. “They have nothing better to do than call me Misery,” she mumbled. “Bet that’s what they called me when you decided to come over here. Do yourself a favor new girl, go back over there. Trust me the longer you stay here the worse it will be....for you.”<br />
<br />
Kellie got up slowly looking at Mary Elsie’s in shock. She was stunned how angry and bitter Mary Elise seemed towards the girls. As she made her way back towards the others she was equally surprised at the looks of betrayal the girls gave Kellie for even talking to Mary Elise.<br />
<br />
“Well,” Mika asked looking angry. “What did she say?”<br />
<br />
“She really doesn’t like you guys,” Kellie whispered. “And I mean really doesn’t like you. Why?”<br />
<br />
“Misery is just...well miserable,” Samantha shrugged. “She just hates anyone that isn’t exactly like her. No idea why.”<br />
<br />
“She’s just lonely,” Katie said sadly. “I mean her only friend is Sebastian. She doesn’t have any girlfriends at school.”<br />
<br />
Kellie looked back sadly before turning to the girls. “Wow that’s just...sad,” she whispered. Lisa snorted as she turned towards Kellie. “Told you it was a waste to go over there,” she grumbled. “You should of listened to us there new girl. We’re trying to help you out.” Kellie looked at the girls curiously noticing for the first time a bit of maliciousness in the way the girls looked at her. Kellie gazed at them slightly fearful. “Could Mary have been right,” she thought in alarm. “Are these girls just bullies putting on a convincing nice girl act?”<br />
<br />
As Ms. Morgan entered the girls now took their seats giving Kellie an odd look before turning to face the teacher. As the class wore on Kellie noted that Ms. Morgan seemed to be having an difficult time teaching. The woman was quite elderly and was beginning to show her age. Ms. Morgan had a difficult time trying to get her points across. Despite this everyone’s was attentive and as the bell rang made their way out of the class. “You coming,” Katie asked. Kellie nodded as she slowly stood up, as she did she could see Mary Elsie and Ms. Morgan talking. An idea came through Kellies head as she looked at her ring. “Hey give me a sec I want to ask Ms. Morgan a question,” she said. Katie nodded as she exited the class.<br />
<br />
Kellie could see that Ms. Morgan seemed to have a bit of a soft spot for the miserable girl. The elderly woman seemed to be comforting the red haired teen, actually forcing a smile from her. Kellie now focused her magic on Ms. Morgan as her ring began to glow.<br />
<br />
Kellie watched as Karen’s Morgan began to grow younger. Karen’s body seemed to regain a great deal of vigor and energy as it raced out of her 60’s and 50’s. As she reentered her 40’s Kellie could see her d cup breast and lose their sagginess as her hair returned to it she original black. Kellie admired just how beautiful Karen was. Still Karen grew younger racing through her 40’s and  30’s. The woman had incredible curves with long flowing ebony hair. Soon a beautiful dark haired girl with glasses stood in the classroom. Kellie didn’t stop there as she made Karen even younger. Karen reentered her teens as she now began to lose the curves of adulthood. Karen’s regression completed her as she now stood before MAry Elise as a shy dark haired girl of 16. Karen’s possessed an impressive c cup chest with narrow hips and a pretty face. Shyly she pushed her glasses up her face as she smiled at her friend. Happily she now talked with Mary Elise who for the first time cracked a smile. The two outsider girls now exited the class, making plans for the evening.<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled warmly as she exited the class to see Katie airing. “Sorry,” She’s said meekly. “Had to get something.” Katie smiled and nodded as the two headed towards their lockers. Kellie turned to see Mary Elise slightly happier than she had been. Hopefully she could repair the damage s she had done to reality and reunite her friends.</p>
