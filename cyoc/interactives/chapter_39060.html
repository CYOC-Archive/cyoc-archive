<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Although Jay's 300 pound muscle body would normally have been more than a match for any man or woman in terms of strength and stamina, Jay found him self overwhelmed. Sean was insatiable. At 7'3&quot; tall and 600 rock solid pounds or pure brutish brawn, Sean was clearly superior to Jay. And his huge new body craved sex. He mounted Jay and used him as a sex toy for hours, enjoying the feeling of Jay's foot-long cock up his pussy. Despite the arrangement of Sean and Jay's respective genitals, it was clearly Sean who was in control-the big brute rode Jay hard, using his 600 pound body to full advantage. On more than one occasion, Jay feared he would be crushed by the muscle monster that was riding him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please, Sean, you gotta give me a break...&quot; Jay pleaded, his tool aching as Sean used it. <br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you said you had 'balls that can go for days'&quot; came Sean's mocking reply. For emphasis, he squeezed his monstrous thighs which were around Jay's legs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck, please, no...&quot; Jay groaned, but Sean laughed in response. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck?&quot; Sean taunted, &quot;That's what we're doing, hot stuff. Fucking.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jay groaned as Sean laughed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, big guy. You know you love this!&quot; Sean grunted, as brought his monstrous pecs right to Jay's face. &quot;Look at how fucking big and powerful I am!&quot; Sean flexed his huge chest, which exploded with power, the two massive slabs of his pecs jutting outward freakishly, big and hard, cut through with deep striations. <br />
<br />
As much as he wanted to, Jay couldn't resist the urge to lean into that enormous chest, pushing his face deep into the deep cleavage between the huge pecs. Jay's tongue flicked about, tasting Sean's manly, musky sweat, as the big man started sliding up and down Jay's rock-hard fucktool. Jay groaned loudly as Sean used him, unable to deny how hot it was to feel his cock inside Sean's musclecunt. <br />
<br />
Ultimately, Jay came again and again, as Sean used him, over the next four hours. Finally though, Sean's raging libido was sated, and the huge musclefreak rolled over, falling asleep. As quietly as he could, Jay arose. He ached from the intensity of Sean's mad lust, and he ached from the intensity being fucked by such a huge freak. Jay was exhausted, but he quietly padded off to where the Chronivac was. <br />
<br />
Clearly, Sean had used it, but hadn't managed to disable it in any way that Jay could see. He sat down, wondering what to do. He thought of returning Sean to his old size, but then reconsidered. Instead, he opened his own profile. Sean would outgrow him, would he? Jay became a bit angry, as be began boosting his profile. Sean thought he was so big and hot and strong--Jay would put that nonsense to rest! He adjusted the sliders on the program. Sean was 7'3&quot;? Jay set his height to 8'.  Sean was 600 pounds? Jay added muscle to his frame until it reached 1200. For good measure, he made sure his pecs were magnificent: big, thick, ripped, jutting. <br />
<br />
And of course, there was his cock. Jay considered whether to change it or not. At a foot long, it was already rather big. He wanted something he could use, if he wanted to. But then, he thought of Sean. Sean humping him with that big body of his. Sean using his cock as a toy. Sean dominating him utterly. Jay's face darkened, and he went into the settings. He only increased the length a bit, from twelve inches to sixteen. But thickness. Oh thickness. He had been a rather thick eight inches around before. But now, he increased that to sixteen. Fuck yeah. Thicker than a beer can, his cock would be a fleshy log. Let's see Sean take that. And while he was at it, Jay doubled the size of his nuts. He couldn't leave them behind, after all. And then he punched up his libido, his stamina, and his energy. Oh fuck yes. <br />
<br />
Jay grinned as he stepped back, and hit enter. He could feel the changes start immediately. His body began to swell, getting bigger, thicker, more massive. His frame stretching taller, wider. His muscles growing freakishly, quickly enlarging, big and hard and powerful, packed onto his tall, thick body. He let out a low groan of pleasure, feeling his body grow to its new size, feeling his huge new cock get oh so very hard, fueled by the testosterone that seemed to rush through him from his big new balls. <br />
<br />
Jay turned, and was barely able to squeeze out of the door into the next room. Slowly, he thudded down the hall, turned sideways, his massive body a tight fit here. The absurdity of his new size making him laugh even louder. <br />
<br />
Sean awoke groggily to the sound of Sean's laughter and footfalls.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What the...?&quot; he began, but his voice died in his throat, as Jay entered the room, and stretched to his full, eight feet of height. Jay was grinning wickedly, and he raised his arms and flexed, the monstrous biceps rising freakishly, massive beyond Sean's comprehension. <br />
<br />
&quot;I- I don't believe it...&quot; Sean babbled, trying to stand, to get away. But Jay moved forward smoothly, grabbing ahold of Sean with his big hands. <br />
<br />
&quot;Believe it, Sean. I figured you needed a bod that could keep up with that sex drive of yours...&quot; Jay's wicked grin became positively evil. Sean shuddered, and shrank back, but Jay held him tight. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no you don't, Sean. You wanted a good fucking... now you're gonna get one!&quot; <br />
<br />
At that, Jay pushed his huge cock up against Sean's hungry pussy. Sean went pale, protesting, &quot;No Jay... Fuck... It's too big!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No such thing...&quot; Jay drawled in reply. He pushed Sean against the couch, and with a brutal thrust, rammed his huge rod into Sean. &quot;OH FUCK YEAH!&quot; Jay roared, as Sean whimpered, overcome by the sublime combination of pain and pleasure. Jay fed more and more of his huge cock into Sean, pounding the now smaller man with his huge fucktool, pushing Sean down onto the couch. The couch groaned under their combined weight, and finally collapsed, unable to bear the strain of the two behemoths fucking. Jay didn't let up one bit, despite the collapse. He just kept fucking Sean in the debris.</p>
