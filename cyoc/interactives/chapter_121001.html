<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
You grumble as Brooke drags you down the street, but she just ignores your complaints.  You have long since giving up trying to cover yourself up.  It just slowed you down and caused Brooke to pull hard on your leash, choking you painfully.  Besides, no one outside the store seemed to mind your nudity.  But quite a few people asked Brooke if they could pet her adorable pet.  You were annoyed at first, but gradually you have come to appreciate their admiration and the pleasure a good scratch can bring.<br />
<br />
That doesn&#39;t mean you have given up hope of becoming human again, however.  As soon as Brooke lets down her guard, you are out of here and headed right back to the store to demand that the old man fix you.  You just need the right opportunity to escape.  Maybe after Brooke takes you home and removes the leash.  Yeah, right after she goes to sleep...<br />
<br />
Brooke stops in front of her dorm, a large old building on the campus of the University.  Although you have been dating Brooke for quite a while, you have never been inside.  It is a girl&#39;s dormitory, with a strict Resident Advisor who insures that no man sets foot inside.  But given your current circumstances, that is no longer a problem for you.<br />
<br />
Once inside it takes forever to reach Brooke&#39;s room.  It seems like every girl in the building wants Brooke to stop so they can pet her cute bunny.  You are afraid that the store might be closed by the time you can get a chance to slip away from Brooke&#39;s grasp.  Finally, Brooke opens the door to her dorm room. <br />
<br />
You are surprised to find someone already inside.  Has she stopped to visit another friend?  Then you notice two beds and realize she must have a roommate. Her half of the room is dark black, adorned with posters of gothic art and bands, a stark contrast to the bright and cheery things on Brooke&#39;s side.  The girl is pale white, wearing dark colored baggy clothes.  She has short black hair, arranged in a pixie style cut, and can&#39;t be more than 5 feet tall.  She looks like the typical goth or emo kid.  You had no idea that this was Brooke&#39;s roommate.  Or that she even had a roommate for that matter.  Then again, you have never been in her dorm room before. <br />
<br />
The girl is sitting on her bed, reading a book, probably something by Edgar Allen Poe or whatever the creepy kids are into these days. She looks up from her book and her eyes go wide.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck is that?!&quot; she says pointing at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s my pet bunny, Claire, &quot; says Brooke coldly.<br />
<br />
Claire quickly regains her composure, feigning disinterest.  <br />
<br />
&quot;We aren&#39;t allowed to have pets in the dorm,&quot; says Claire without emotion as she resumes reading her book.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what? Who cares? Nobody but that stupid RA! Are you gonna narc on me, Claire?  We aren&#39;t allowed to have incense and candles, but I let you keep that shit around,&quot; says Brooke angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever,&quot; says Claire without interest. &quot;As long as I don&#39;t have to clean up after it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please!  You have to help me....&quot; you begin, but Brooke cuts you off by pulling tightly on your leash.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit!  It can talk!&quot; says Claire with renewed excitement, dropping her book.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, &quot; says Brooke as she struggles to pull you into the bathroom. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where did you get it?&quot; asks Claire.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, I need to train it to use the restroom, &quot; says Brooke.<br />
<br />
Once inside she loosens her grip on your leash, allowing you to breathe again.  You gasp loudly for air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now listen, little bunny.  You better not try to tell anyone how I got you.  It&#39;s not like anyone will believe you anyway, especially that little weirdo out there.  And if you try I will have to punish you.  I&#39;ll take you to the vet and get you fixed.  Or maybe just have you put down.  Better yet, I could just drop you off at the pound.  If you are lucky, they will just put you to sleep forever.  But I think there are a lot of perverts out there that would love to have their own little bunny pet. Just imagine all the fun you would have if one of them was your owner, &quot; says Brooke evilly.<br />
<br />
You shiver a little at the thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I will be good, Brooke, &quot; you say softly.<br />
<br />
Brooke happily pats your head.  <br />
<br />
&quot;That is my good little bunny.  See, now that wasn&#39;t so hard.  I can be a very good and loving owner.  As long as you respect and obey me.  Now keep your mouth shut around my stupid roommate and let me do the talking, &quot; says Brooke as she opens the door.<br />
<br />
Brooke takes off your leash and you rub your sore throat.  She starts preparing a small nest of clothes for you to sleep on at the foot of her bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t hear the toilet flush, &quot; says Claire dryly.<br />
<br />
&quot;She didn&#39;t have to go,&quot; says Brooke.<br />
<br />
&quot;If she made a mess, you have to clean it up.  I don&#39;t want to step in a bunch of pellets of rabbit shit when I am trying to use the bathroom tonight,&quot; says Claire.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said she didn&#39;t take a shit!  So can you drop it already!?&quot; says Brooke angrily.  <br />
<br />
You have never seen this side of her before and you don&#39;t like it.  You guess she must have been hiding her aggressive angry nature from you.  Claire remains impassive as Brooke continues to get ready for bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You never answered my question, &quot; says Claire.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about? I said she didn&#39;t take a shit!  Can&#39;t you get that through your thick skull?&quot; says Brooke angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;That wasn&#39;t a question.  That was a statement, &quot; says Claire calmly.  &quot;I asked you something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What then?! What was your question?&quot; says Brooke angrily, her face flashing bright red with fury.<br />
<br />
&quot;No need to  get upset.  I just asked where you got that thing,&quot; says Claire.<br />
<br />
You turn pale with fear.  You are afraid that Brooke might explode with anger and take it on you later.  But instead she gets oddly calm.<br />
<br />
&quot;I went to that magic store off campus just down the street.  I bought the last one so there&#39;s no point in going there to get your own.  But if you are nice, I will let you play with mine,&quot; says Brooke proudly.<br />
<br />
Claire scoffs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I would want to play with some dirty animal.  I was just curious, &quot; says Claire.  &quot;But I thought you had a date with your boyfriend - ole what&#39;s his name.  Where is he anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, he didn&#39;t show up for our date so I went shopping instead.  But I am sure that he is around here somewhere, &quot; says Brooke, giving you a wide smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever, &quot; says Claire as she lays down in her bed and turns off her light. <br />
<br />
After changing into her nightgown, Brooke does the same thing.  <br />
<br />
You look around the room for some way to escape.  There is a window, but you have no idea if it is unlocked, much less how far a drop to the ground it would be.  You think you are on the first floor, but it still could be quite a large fall for a small bunny.  You could make a break for the door, but could you really open it without alerting Brooke or Claire?  And even if you got out, where would you go?  The store was undoubtedly closed by now and no one would recognize you.  It&#39;s not like you could just stroll into your own dorm building looking like this.<br />
<br />
You are still plotting when you spy the book that Claire dropped.  You read the title - <br />
<br />
&#39;Witchcraft for Beginners&#39;  <br />
<br />
You doubt she is really a witch, but at least it seems like she really does believe in magic.  Maybe if you could somehow covertly slip a message to her without Brooke&#39;s knowledge, she could help you.  But Claire did seem a little off.  There is no guarantee she would be any better than Brooke.  She might keep you as her familiar or use you for some kind of weird spell.  <br />
<br />
You continue to weigh your options and finally decide.....</p>
