<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Arthur pestered as he turned on the lights of his bar&#39;s dance floor. The last customers had left five minutes earlier, when he&#39;d flashed the lights and ordered everyone out. Those that had stayed till then had staggered their way out, and he wasn&#39;t sure if they had passed out right outside, but so long as they hadn&#39;t collapsed in his bar, it wasn&#39;t his problem.<br />
<br />
No, his problem was that he was left to clean and do the closing time! That wasn&#39;t his job! He was the owner, not the barman or the janitor! Damn that lazy employee of his! Pablo had called in sick, saying his boyfriend needed him. Ah! As if! The man was just using the first excuse he could not to work, leaving Arthur to take over his shift at the last minute.<br />
<br />
Well, he had no intention to let such disrespect slide! he thought darkly as he picked on the empty glasses left all over the tables. He hadn&#39;t worked for years investing to be forced into menial labor every time some ingrate bailed on him. He had started writing that termination email right after the phone call, but had decided to wait until after shift to send it, just in case Pablo miraculously developed a conscience.<br />
<br />
Miracles don&#39;t happen, unfortunately. So, tomorrow, Pablo would wake up (if he bothered) to see that he&#39;d been fired for making Arthur do his job for him.<br />
<br />
Arthur&#39;s mood didn&#39;t improve after he had wiped the tables and hid the glasses for the afternoon shift. They&#39;d have more to do, but they could blame Pablo for it.<br />
<br />
Urgh, the bathroom. He hated that part. The disadvantage of owning a gay bar was that every drunken fool would run to the toilet stalls to nut all over his walls. And normally, that was Pablo&#39;s job to clean up. He wondered if he could just keep his last paycheck for himself, just to teach him reliability. God knew Pablo could use the lesson.<br />
<br />
With that satisfying thought in mind, Arthur entered the bathroom stalls, and was unsurprised but annoyed to find his prediction had been correct. The smell alone told him a bunch of horny men had used the bathroom for some fucking. One day, he might have to install a camera here just to have the proof he needed to sue them.<br />
<br />
Grumbling, Arthur started with some sweeping, leaving the trash cans for later. He started quite furiously, but the rough sticky texture on the tiles just made the whole thing impossible. What was it with this shitty broom? The mop better not have been rendered useless like the broom. Why hadn&#39;t Pablo told him about this before? Giving up, he pushed the broom against the wall and instead began to pull the trash can&#39;s bags out.<br />
<br />
Midway, a wallet fell to the side and landed flat open. The lack of cards was disappointing, but curiosity now stoked, Arthur peeked into the bag, and noticed two full sets of clothes, including wallets and some old phones.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who threw this?&quot; Arthur wondered, too surprised to be mad.<br />
<br />
There was no way any of his customers had left his bar naked. He would have noticed. Still puzzled, Arthur backed away from the bathroom&#39;s trash can. Maybe someone had dropped their cards elsewhere. He had no return and lost and found policies. If the drunks lost their stuff, that was their own fault. With a certain anticipation, Arthur checked into one of the stalls.<br />
<br />
He heard something go &#39;crunch&#39; under his foot.<br />
<br />
Then a bright flash of light blinded him.<br />
***<br />
<br />
Pablo rubbed his eyes as he entered &#39;The Rainbow Scene&#39; for his evening shift. His poor Ben had caught the flu and had needed someone to check his temperature all throughout the night to make sure he didn&#39;t need to go to the hospital. The fever had thankfully broken during the early morning, and he&#39;d been able to sleep a little better, but even a nap hadn&#39;t left him in the best shape.<br />
<br />
He had called Mr. Arthur yesterday to explain the situation, but his boss wasn&#39;t usually very understanding. The sort that went on and on about &#39;team spirit&#39; and &#39;letting down his colleagues&#39;. Still, if it came down to his job or Ben, the choice was pretty easy. He would have to work extra hard tonight to make it up to his boss, to show it had been exceptional circumstances. He needed something to help him pay for their new apartment.<br />
<br />
He turned his keys into the bar&#39;s door, only to be surprised when he realized they weren&#39;t locked. That... that was strange. Had Mr. Arthur forgotten? His boss hadn&#39;t worked a nightshift in years, even if he asked that all his workers pull double shifts for &#39;big events&#39;. Yeah. Mr. Arthur could be a bit of a dickhead sometimes. Very anal about everything being cleaned just right, to the millimeter, according to the schedule.<br />
<br />
Pablo bit down on a groan, remembering &#39;the schedule&#39; from Hell. Nope. He wasn&#39;t going to think of that when his shift was about to start. And when he saw that the dance floor had been left half-cleaned, Pablo forgot the schedule entirely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, what the fuck? Did no one stay after closing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Arthur wouldn&#39;t have been that petty, right?<br />
<br />
With a sinking feeling, Pablo checked behind the counter and noticed a lot of unwashed dishes. This was going to take a while. He was so going to be late opening today. If he was right, then Mr. Arthur would have left without even cleaning the bathroom. Deciding that was his best bet, Pablo pushed the door open.<br />
<br />
Great. A trash bag had been left lying on the side, old pairs of pants and shirts spilling out of its mouth. One set of clothes laid crumpled by the opening of a stall, clearly someone in too great a hurry to fuck to consider much else. Must have been a middle-aged Daddy, judging by the taste in fashion.<br />
<br />
Sighing, Pablo leaned down to pick the clothes and threw them away with the rest. As he did though, he noticed an odd bulge. Huh. That almost felt like...<br />
<br />
With a startle, Pablo jumped back when he saw a dildo flop out of the pair of jeans and land on the cold hard tile. Even after a few months of working in a gay bar, that was a first. People didn&#39;t usually forget their sex toys here, even if they went for a quickie.<br />
<br />
Objectively, it was a... pretty vanilla model? Looked about five inches at a glance. Cut, with a reddish head and some nice, low hanging balls. Wait, there were a couple of greyish black hair attached to the balls, and no base to help it, you know, stand up. Pablo knelt. That skin texture was a bit pale, but, not silicon-like at all. And was that just him, or had the shaft gotten longer since he’d first looked at it? With a hesitant hand (who knows where that had gone?), he brushed against the base of the shaft, a safe spot, and was shocked to feel it twitch against his fingers. Scratch that &#39;vanilla&#39;. The more he looked at it, the more *real* it seemed. It couldn&#39;t have been cheap.<br />
<br />
Grinning, he poked the pieces of electronics that laid shattered on the ground around it. He hadn&#39;t noticed the first time around, but... Was that a high tech dildo? A broke one? Was that why someone had left it lying around? It felt warm to the touch, like real skin, and quite rigid once in his grasp.<br />
<br />
Pablo chuckled to himself, rubbing his fingers around the dickhead&#39;s tip. The texture was incredibly realistic. The way it throbbed, hot and needy reminded him of Ben&#39;s, on a smaller scale. To his amazement, he saw a drop of clear liquid squirt out of the dildo&#39;s slit.<br />
<br />
His own cock aching, Pablo decided to pull on the toy&#39;s ballsack, feel it for its stretchy, bouncy realism. He really wanted to find whoever had made this dildo, because he was going to buy the biggest model in their stock if this boringly average model felt this nice to play with.<br />
<br />
And then, out of nowhere, the dildo tightened in his hands, and a string of white liquid Pablo would have sworn was cum flew out of the dickhead to splatter on the toilet&#39;s stall. Oh, Mr. Arthur would be so pissed... But even that thought couldn&#39;t stifle his breathless laugh. Even more so when the dildo softened in his grasp, going limp with cum drizzling from its head as if it was the real thing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, that&#39;s nuts. Ben has got to see this thing!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then, after a second, he deflated.<br />
<br />
&quot;After I finish up all the work left behind...&quot;<br />
<br />
And, casually, he shoved the dildo in the pockets of his coat for safekeeping, so he could get to work for the night shift. But, just in case, he would use his locker tonight to make sure no one saw his new toy.</p>
