<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amid her frenzied worry over what Emma was being dragged off to, Millie felt a familiar sensation gnawing at her: guilt. No matter how many times people had told her that the whole mermaid pandemic wasn&#39;t her fault, that she couldn&#39;t have known what sharing her gift with Emma would do, she&#39;d never been able to stop feeling responsible. The whole time since, she&#39;d been convinced that she&#39;d screwed up and caused Emma a ton of grief - and now she felt guilty again, knowing her fiancee was getting dragged off to undergo something horrible.<br />
<br />
No! A flood of resolve hit her as she stood up from behind her cover. Not again! She wasn&#39;t letting somebody do something to her sweet Em! No way was Millie going to be at fault yet again for some problem or headache for the girl she loved so much - and no way were those bimbos going to keep putting their hands all over Emma! <i>Nobody</i> got to touch her wife-to-be or lust after her, nobody except for Millie herself, and no force in this universe was going to change that!<br />
<br />
She had only moments to act, but lucky for them both, Millie was still one hell of a sprinter. Just as Adie was preparing to bathe Emma in the light of the amulet, there was a grand yell as Millie charged in, shoving herself into Emma and knocking the pink-haired girl away from the arms of her captors. She stumbled ahead, slamming into Adie and sending the witch sprawling, the sudden disturbance causing her to drop the amulet - but as she did so, Millie was hit with the full brunt of its light, crashing into her like a runaway train made of pure lust.<br />
<br />
The shock of sexual energy had her reflexively transforming to her mermaid form before she hit the ground, her sparkling tail covered in a rainbow pattern of scales, plus a new pink stripe, just like her hair. She moaned as her mind was flooded with desire, all aimed squarely at her gorgeous lover, currently scrambling to her feet. Just the sight of her had Millie shoving a hand into the slit that emerged from her scales, the other grasping at a chest now swelling to enormous proportions. Her eyes had glazed over, but the sheer, uneding adoration she had for Emma was evident even in their glossy state.<br />
<br />
&quot;Emma... run....&quot; She forced out between moans as she felt her ability to think about anything but sex dragged away from her mind. &quot;I... love you...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tears welled up in Emma&#39;s eyes as she scrambled for the amulet, grabbing it by the chain as Adie and her girls marveled over the mermaid on the floor in front of them, touching her scales. She wanted to scream, she wanted to punch them and shove them away before they touched her beloved any further, but she knew sticking around would only get them both hopelessly trapped. &quot;I love you too,&quot; she choked out, swearing to herself that she would come back before raising the amulet and focusing on just... <i>leaving</i>.<br />
<br />
After a few moments, she felt that magical spark within herself ignite, a new beam of pink light shooting out from the amulet and blasting what looked to be a hole in reality itself. A swirling rift that she was sure would lead somewhere else - it was her best bet. &quot;I&#39;ll be back for you!&quot; she yelled to her lover before hurling herself through the portal, a death grip still held around the chain of the amulet.<br />
<br />
Instantly, she found herself stumbling onto the ground outside the mall - and just as instantly, the whole world felt... foggier. And she felt... heavier? Groaning, the girl brushed aside some shoulder-length pink hair from her face, struggling to try and get up with the enormous weight of her giant chest pushing her down. She could feel the grass beneath her butt - mostly because it had stretched out so much that her pants ripped. She kind of liked it though, just because she knew Millie would like it. Where was Millie? She was having trouble remembering as she glanced down at the amulet in her hand.<br />
<br />
This thing, it was... very important. She remembered that much. It was just... kind of a struggle to recall <i>why</i>. She was pretty sure she had done something with it just now, and that it had done something to her in turn, which is why she felt all funny, but also really hot. Like she was sure she was the hottest she&#39;d ever been. But it sucked, because Millie wasn&#39;t here, and Millie was the only person she cared about being hot for. She totally didn&#39;t care about any of the bimbos out near the mall&#39;s entrance trying to batter their way through the weird blue runic force field around the mall, or the weird ladies with really tiny titties and ugly black outfits who were now rushing towards her.<br />
<br />
But she did start to care about those last people as one of them fired off a bolt of some crazy blue energy, wrapping around her arms and forcing her to the ground. &quot;Heyyyyy, that&#39;s meannnnnn!&quot; she shouted. Millie didn&#39;t even like bondage stuff, no way she wanted to do it with these ugly ladies. Wait! She recognized them! Something flitted in her cloudy mind, a recollection brought back to the surface. &quot;Hey wait! I know you guys! You&#39;re, like... Sal... Sam... Salmon...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;SALEM,&quot; one of them, a dark-skinned, dark-haired woman with Indian features, finished the thought for her, hands glowing as she approached donned in a military uniform. A few more women were with her, armed with magic rather than firearms, and one of them carrying a long stick-like device, promptly used to poke at the amulet. &quot;Can you tell me who you are, and how you got through that barrier?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bar-ee-are?&quot; There were no bars around here. &quot;Oh! I&#39;m, like, Emma! I.. I got... out...&quot; Her eyes darted to the pretty pink gemstone. &quot;That thing! It&#39;s important... it&#39;s super important!&quot;<br />
<br />
The uniformed woman sighed. &quot;Yeah, figured as much.&quot; She nodded to the one with a stick. &quot;Bag that thing and get it back to the FOB. I bet the lab girls are gonna have a field day poking at it.&quot; Her attention turned back to Emma, who felt herself pulled to her feet, dragged away from the force field and the mall by the bindings around her forearms. Now that she was up on her feet, she could see that the mall was surrounded by more ugly-outfit ladies and tons of ugly cars and tanks and helicopters, all with a pentagram logo emblazoned on their shoulder patches or painted on the vehicles. &quot;Emma, I&#39;m Olivia. I need you to come with me, okay? We need to get you somewhere safe, and talk to you about what happened in there.&quot;</p>
