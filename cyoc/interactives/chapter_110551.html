<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As days passed, Mark&#39;s routine was basically the same. In the mornings, almost everyday, he was on a quick test where the scientist took some samples, usually pee or sweat, but in some cases they needed small amounts of poop which were really embarrassing for Mark. Actually, most of those samples were taken when he and Jack were still sleeping, so them were mostly discreet.<br />
<br />
After them, he and Jack used to play with an old videogame console that they have on their room. It had a few games but they were enough to get them distracted until noon. Later, they have to participate in some social activities arranged by the Human Resources department who used to made sport and cultural activities. Mark liked to play soccer or playing the bass with his new friends. Then, they went to the dining hall where they took the same table to take their meals. The food was actually very good and Mark loved to eat their pizzas, tacos and sandwiches.<br />
<br />
&quot;Today I learnt to whistle.&quot; Taylor said one day and after that he always whistled when he was happy.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m too proud of myself, I almost beat Grant&#39;s production!&quot; Zach said one day.<br />
&quot;I made to little today...&quot; He said another day.<br />
&quot;We were playing Pong for almost an hour!&quot; Jack said grinning.<br />
Mark was too accustomed to his new life that slowly he was forgetting about his older friends, his past and the life outside the facilities. But he used to remember them briefly when they went to the night testings.<br />
<br />
Losing his bladder control was just the beginning, after several days they modified his pee&#39;s production. Some days he was like a fire hose and some other he was completely dry. When those test were done, they begin to inhibit his poop control. That was way more disgusting and embarrassing than losing his bladder control, but he got used to it after some days. Using his diapers and getting changed was almost normal to him now. He wasn&#39;t too worried about his testing until the day when he heard that the basic functions testings were finally done.<br />
<br />
&quot;What does that means?&quot; He whispered to Jack.<br />
&quot;No idea.&quot; The other guy answered him. &quot;Maybe they will give us back our basic functionalities.&quot;<br />
&quot;I hope so.&quot; Mark replied.<br />
&quot;Since tomorrow we&#39;ll begin to make your test at different times.&quot; A scientist said. &quot;We&#39;ll continue some basic functions testings with you, Mark and Jack will be in our new project at midnights.&quot; He indicated to the other scientist to take note of that and kept speaking. &quot;Aditionally, we will need that you were in different rooms, so we will transfer Mark to Zone 03: Mind temporally for a few months.&quot;<br />
&quot;Months?!&quot; Mark can&#39;t avoid to shout.<br />
&quot;Any problem?&quot; The scientist questioned with an expressionless face. Mark just shook his head. &quot;He won&#39;t have any Mind test but he won&#39;t be allowed to have any contact with the other test subject.&quot;<br />
<br />
That night, Mark was transfered to the Mind Zone. It looked almost exactly that Body, except that it was more populated by boys. There were way more rooms that in Body and they were full of guys at different ages.<br />
&quot;Room 103&quot; He said as he remembered the instructions that he received from the scientist. He found a door with numbers 103 and he entered. In the room were four boys, two of them really quiet, almost like statues. One was sleeping and the other one was singing in front of a mirror. The last one was the most accessible to talk, so Mark went to meet him.<br />
&quot;Hi! I&#39;m Mark. I was transfered here temporally from Body, so I hope we can get along.&quot; He said as he got closer to the boy who was completely distracted by the mirror. When he was enough close to him, Mark was finally able to see his face and he was amazed of what he discovered.<br />
&quot;Jimmy!!&quot; He shouted completely surprised.<br />
&quot;Uh?&quot; Jimmy said as he broke from the trance he was. &quot;Mark? Is that you, Mark?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes! I was looking for you for a long time!&quot; Mark replied.<br />
&quot;Where are we? What happened?&quot; Jimmy said. &quot;The last I remember is that I went to my aunt&#39;s home because my mom went to a date and I fell asleep on Raul&#39;s bed. Talking about him, where is my cousin?&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a long story but I can tell you he&#39;s fine. I had met a guy who knows where is Raul and he has been telling me he is ok.&quot; Mark said. &quot;This place is really weird. Haven&#39;t you heard something about it around here?&quot;<br />
&quot;Boys here aren&#39;t very communicative and I don&#39;t know where to go, so I stay here all day.&quot; Jimmy said. &quot;Some people bring us food three times at day and we have a bathroom through that door.&quot;<br />
&quot;So, have you been here, on Mind, since we arrived?&quot; Mark said, Jimmy nodded. &quot;I asume you were on testing, right?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh! Those testings are awful!&quot; Jimmy said. &quot;I always fail!&quot;<br />
&quot;Fail?&quot; Mark asked interested. &quot;What kind of test do you have?&quot;<br />
&quot;Like the school ones.&quot; Jimmy said. &quot;We have three at day and if we failed one we need to take a recovery class to learn why we failed it. Just now, I was trying to memorize my face muscles names. Tomorrow it will be my first test!&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh. I thought that testings here were more like brainwashing or something like that.&quot; Mark said. &quot;And what about those guys?&quot;<br />
&quot;The one who is sleeping is exempt for the first testing of tomorrow. He is really clever but he don&#39;t speak a lot.&quot; Jimmy said. &quot;Those other two were punished for failing too much testings consecutively. They are in a blank state right now.&quot;<br />
&quot;Blank state? What&#39;s that?&quot; Mark asked.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not completely sure.&quot; Jimmy said. &quot;I heard is like intense lessons that are introduced into your brain. Some guys said it could take days, even if you are sleeping. It&#39;s frightening, that&#39;s why I&#39;m studying so much.&quot;<br />
<br />
After some less important talking, Mark and Jimmy finally finished.<br />
&quot;I will be here for around a month.&quot; Mark said. &quot;So, I&#39;m happy that I&#39;ll be with you. I want to introduce you my new friends. We reunite all days in the same table at the dining room. You can join us after your tomorrow test.&quot;<br />
&quot;That sound good.&quot; Jimmy said. &quot;I was getting bored of being here.&quot;<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t expect that Mind was like a school.&quot; Mark said. &quot;I&#39;m happy that I&#39;m on Body. Although I hate this diaper.&quot;<br />
They both laughed but then Jimmy&#39;s smile dissappeared in a worried expression.<br />
&quot;Mark...&quot; Jimmy said. &quot;I was wondering... When will we go back to our houses? Do our parents know where are we? I was a little bit worried for my mom.&quot;<br />
Then, Mark remembered that he was getting too accustomed to the facilities that he almost had forgotten about the outside world.&quot;I... forget about it...&quot; He said. &quot;I don&#39;t know if they will give us back to our homes but I&#39;m sure we aren&#39;t here with our parents&#39;s permission.&quot;<br />
&quot;Are we kidnapped?&quot; Jimmy said but Mark kept quiet for a moment until he said.<br />
&quot;We need to escape.&quot;</p>
