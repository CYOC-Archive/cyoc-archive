<br/>
Edited as of 7/6/2024</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the sunset hues overcasting the whole region in its golden light, Drevor Nicolaus Scott the Third was lounging across the side porch of his grandparent&#39;s farm house in a valley somewhere in rustic United States. The roof of the buildings were discolored with the reflected reds of the sun, streaks of the vibrant color moving over the black tiles. Outlines for the corn fields glowed with yellow, their tassels shimmering in the flowing winds.<br />
<br />
The humanoid shape that began from the neck part of a large dire wolf continued upwards, his rather large waistline widening to a set of powerful pectorals. The wide shoulders of the wolf-man peaked with heavy trapezius muscles, one arm pulling away as he blew a large cloud of cigarette smoke with a sigh.<br />
<br />
“After all that fiasco, and you come back like nothing gone wrong.” Drevor finished the tobacco in another inhale, keeping it inside of his four lungs for a moment. He exhaled the smoke along with a suffering sigh. “And I had just finished the farm work!”<br />
<br />
Drevor audibly growled at the Author in question, before focusing on the matters that had plagued him when Holly gave him a beatdown thinking he was Trevor.<br />
<br />
“Nope, I’m not gunna bother with acknowledging the presence of you Authors.” Drevor didn’t really care about the fact that the familiar yet new Author came back again. He pulled out the Chronivac emitter and connected it to his larger tablet, seeing the UI pop up.<br />
<br />
“Took me a long while to get the whole farm reacquainted with me you know, had to do the same thing I did with Thor and run around the whole place to get them all.” Taps on the tablet screen brought up the large direwolftaur on screen, his stats bare to the Reader to look at. “Now all of them have familiarity with me instead of ol’ David, which makes me feel a bit bad but it had to be done.”<br />
<br />
The fading light of the sun gradually decreased until darkness blanketed the night sky, turning the fields into gray hues in Drevor’s sights. Fields of corn swaying in the wind, the treeline far away with its darkness pierced by his sight.<br />
<br />
He tapped his hairstyle that immediately became highlighted, opening a drop down list of much of the available preset hairstyles. “Right now I’m gunna do some physical editing, turn me into my own person.” <br />
<br />
“Buzzcut, necessary for police work and very clean, not my thing though. I want a mullet to stay…” Gone through multiple iterations and even going so far as to model it himself, the dire wolf settled on a rather stylish mullet, handsomely combed back with the sides buzzed away. <br />
<br />
The preview of himself on the screen still showed a huge dire wolftaur creature, muscles the combination of two men merged as one. Staring at himself, Drevor felt his blood go down and harden his red rocket and moisten his clit. <br />
<br />
“Sheesh, muscles are staying then.” He continued as he removed all of the scars on his body. The IED and such from Trevor and the glass cut from David, along much more he didn’t realize or forgot he had. Each tap of his meaty fingers left more of his skin pristine from any marring, removing everything that made him less approachable.<br />
<br />
At a whim, he turned his eyes into a beautiful, forest green. Then, a harsh gold of a predator, then a blood moon red. After all popular combinations and even heterochromia, Drevor settled on the forest green and nodded with satisfaction.<br />
<br />
Removing the auburn from his coat was a good idea after all, return all of it to the normal timberwolf grays that David liked so much and made it look more healthier and natural, cleaner too.<br />
<br />
“Alright, I think that’s enough for some makeover changes for now,” With a tap of the finger-pad on the screen, the changes traveled up his paws and over his head, the smooth style change updating himself to his new look just in time for him to reheat the pizza for dinner. <br />
<br />
He could feel every change settle into his skin, the scars on his body mending up, the auburn in his fluff receding and leaving behind grey. When the smooth change passed over his face, he suppressed a shudder when his headfur rapidly shifted about and settled into a new configuration. <br />
<br />
He gave himself a smirk. &quot;Now that&#39;s one handsome wolftaur.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>“With Holly back to work with her double shift, she’s not gunna come back till midnight.”</i> Drevor thought to himself as he entered the door to his grandparent’s house, hearing his children downstairs once again playing on his console. He smiled, heavy paws stalking to the kitchen to reheat pizza. <br />
<br />
<i>“Dinner, then straight to the home gym that grandma had which was far better than the stuff Trevor had before. Interrupted earlier, resuming it tonight. Then, some much needed shower.”</i><br />
<br />
The check-list set in his head, Drevor went to work. <br />
<br />
_____________________________________<br />
<br />
With the pizza reheated and served, the pack ate.<br />
<br />
Tom and Alice enjoyed eating the fast food for the second time today. Sure, it’s not that healthy but who cares. The old Trevor would have cared, but he is part of this merge now and he says it&#39;s good for them. Drevor sat together with the kids eating the pizza down in the basement, letting them play and eat at the same time.<br />
<br />
Earlier when Drevor came downstairs with plates of reheated pizza, Tom and Alice were quick to notice the creak of the wooden stairs as a large weight bared down on them. The changes he did to himself did not go unnoticed by the two.<br />
<br />
“Where did your scars go?” Tom had asked when he realized that their new Dad looked a lot different when the big wolftaur laid down with them in front of the plasma TV.<br />
<br />
“I removed them to appear friendlier, Tommy.” He chuckled and gave the 11 year old a heavy pat on his head.<br />
<br />
“Whoah, you gave yourself green eyes!” Alice gleefully remarked while shoving another slice like a chipmunk as she looked at the emerald hues of his new irises.<br />
<br />
“The better to see you both my dear,” He gave them both a light kiss on their foreheads, in actuality simply giving them a lick with the end of his long tongue. &quot;I like it myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice&#39;s eyes noticeably widened and she grinned. &quot;Green eyes see better in the dark?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tilting his head to the side like most confused canines, Drevor closed his eyes with his right hand&#39;s index fingers pointing up to explain. &quot;Well, not really. The irises of a wolf&#39;s eyes-&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice gave him a pat on his abdominals, bringing focus back onto the young child. &quot;I-I was just kidding dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drevor could only balk with an appropriate, &quot;Oh, right.&quot;<br />
<br />
His children giggled as they played the games on the console and got pizza grease all over the controllers. <br />
<br />
<i>Can easily be fixed with a quick change on the Chronivac.</i><br />
<br />
Drevor didn’t really mind it, his heartbeats pounding becoming a light massaging backrest for the pups as they gamed with abandon and laughter as they played TimeSplitters 2.<br />
<br />
Too much gaming, too much food, a comfy floof, and a strong, calming beat lulled the two into slumber. Drevor gladly carried them both in his muscular arms to their beds on the second floor with no problems at all. He looked at the beds, placed his kids on his back and made some edits in the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
<i>After the hectic day we all had, they need the comfiest beds I can give them. Not the steel frame beds, those are creaky. Wooden for sure, sturdy and homely.</i> He thought as he swiped through many models, glaring at them with keen eyes. <i>Basic queen beds for each would be good…</i><br />
<br />
The beds shifted form so quietly with the smooth change, becoming two new clean and comfortable beds.<br />
<br />
Drevor tucked them both in as gently as he could, making sure the tiny humans compared to his massive dire wolf body slept well in their guest beds upgraded with the Chronivac. He then shut off the lights, closed the doors and walked back downstairs to his basement.<br />
<br />
Perks of having such powerful muscles comes with the need to work out to burn away the itch to move it. He didn’t waste much time, once more upgrading the equipment and basement to fit his new needs. He murmured to himself once the changes settled down. “Grandma’s sets aren’t bad, note to self, probably ask her if I can buy these and bring it home.” <br />
<br />
The empty space was rapidly filled with up-to-date machines he could remember from Trevor’s memories. “Power racks, weight bench, rowing machine, oh... fuck yes.” <br />
<br />
Drevor had an interesting time figuring out how to include his tauric lower half in the sets. <i>All four of my legs are gunna be exhausted for all the missed leg days, hoping my regeneration heals any of the soreness.</i><br />
<br />
Around the usual time, which he could starkly remember because he had been stalking her work schedules and from David’s own memories of when she became available to talk. He didn’t want to give Holly a wave of musk and pheromones from his sweat as much as that excited him, so he decided to have a shower.<br />
<br />
It took him a while, mostly from his fur deflating and also him turning something into a large canine-equine dildo and enjoying himself in the shower as he basically knotted himself with a model of his own cock, he finished right as Holly opened the front doors of the farmhouse.<br />
<br />
Drevor jumped out of the showers and dried his hands enough to use the tablet without messing up the screen with his wet paws, taking the device from the table and selecting himself. <br />
<br />
He removed the “Wet” status effect from himself, immediately removing excess water from his fur and then cleaning up the wet floor both in the toilet and the basement. Including the wet dog smell that permeated the entire underground space.<br />
<br />
<i>Just in time, hopefully Holly’s not too tired from work.</i> Drevor thought as he bounded up the stairs from the upgraded basement, spotting Holly in the living room just as spirit fire burned her work clothes off. Drevor piped up with a smile. “Clothes beam?” <br />
<br />
Her flames reformed her clothes into bath robes, turning around to face the large dire wolftaur as a towel coiled itself up her head. “Mhm, the magic so far was a quality of life addition. I can sense the kids are asleep upstairs, feels like... contentment, yeah?” <br />
<br />
Drevor nodded, sitting down. It was only then that he realized he was naked… He inwardly shrugged, fur’s still valid as a covering anyway. “Gave them some dinner and they gamed themselves to sleep, I think they’re going to do fine going forward.”<br />
<br />
&quot;Really now,&quot; Holly questioned as she let the wolftaur help her with her belongings, her satchel retrieved and hung away. &quot;I guess the kids are doing just fine with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
He smiled, giving her a view of his pearly whites. &quot;Now that the kids are in bed, I&#39;d want some time to poke you about something.&quot; <br />
<br />
The vixen chuckled as teal flames restored her to her human form, &quot;Oh, I&#39;d have to bet you would now, won&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
He gave her a chuckle in response as she walked past him, Drevor following closely behind as she went to the upstairs guest bathrooms to clean up with a good shower. Her magic definitely cleaned her up, Drevor could smell her cleanliness, but nothing beats the feeling of water flowing down the body.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not all about that... maybe.&quot; He grinned as he split from her destination, opening the doors to the room Holly would sleep in. &quot;I&#39;ll wait for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Holly nodded her confirmation as the solid oak door closed in front of Drevor, he himself waiting outside like a good hound, before he thought of something better to do while waiting.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take much time if he was keeping track of time, which he didn&#39;t. Instead, he checked up on Tom and Alice in the other guest rooms and gave them good night kisses and light licks. <br />
<br />
His pups were at least content to sleep peacefully tonight.<br />
<br />
When Drevor heard the showers shut off and the bathroom door creak open, he was already taking his steps towards Holly&#39;s room. <br />
<br />
The big and bulky wolftaur sat in front of her room&#39;s door, respecting her privacy despite being spouses.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can hear you on the other side, come in!&quot; Holly&#39;s melodic voice pierced through the hollow door, beckoning him inside. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, comin&#39; in.&quot; Twisting the doorknob, the first thing that entered his eyes was, of course, the lamplit guest bedroom. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, what was it that you wanted to poke me with?&quot; Holly&#39;s voice swiveled his ears towards her, turning to focus his emerald-yellow eyes on her voluptuously clad, panties and bra covered body. <br />
<br />
Practically half naked, human as well. Drevor felt his Trevor half rise, a whistle escaping his maw in appreciation and his mast sliding out of his sheath. It had been a while since he saw her in a bedroom with almost no clothing. Bonus, she was posed with the lamplight highlighting her curves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holly, damn. Sorry for the whistle, just came out of me-&quot; Drevor sputtered out as he looked away. &quot;It was habitual.&quot;<br />
<br />
Holly&#39;s chuckle made him return to look at her again. &quot;That&#39;s okay, Drevor. Making new habits take at least 30 days.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drevor nodded fervently in agreement, gulping his anxiety away. &quot;Yeah... Gunna be some time before I become Balto, not just Trevor or just David.&quot; Drevor walked in and closed the door behind him, making sure his tail didn&#39;t get clipped by the door. The muscular beast was now alone with his wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;Balto? Is that your new name?&quot; Holly quirked an eyebrow as she strutted to the bed and sat down, patting beside her for Drevor to sit as well. &quot;I&#39;d have to guess there&#39;s a reason, the Balto animated movie notwithstanding.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drevor did smile and chuckle, trotting to where she was and laying his quadrupedal half onto the floor. He couldn&#39;t sit on the bed after all.<br />
<br />
&quot;The full name would be Balthazar Nicolaus Phillips. I knew I had to really bring about a good new name for myself rather than something hodgepodge between my old names, and the name fits too.&quot; Balto flexed his right arm as he pointed to himself, the peaks rippling under his thick fur. &quot;Balto was a wolfdog, two different natures combined into one and choosing to live with his savior. I&#39;d like to live with you, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Balto was half excited and half worried, both parts could see a conflicted look flash across Holly&#39;s human eyes. Enough for his warning bells to gong and his ears to perk up in concern. &quot;Was... was there a problem with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Holly sighed, though it wasn&#39;t a long, suffering one.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know how I said making new habits gonna take some time? The same applies to me, Balto.&quot; Holly looked at her half-husband, the big wolftaur looking into her eyes with concern, and dare she say it, love. Nothing obsessive like Trevor&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;It took me months to distance myself from Trevor, to detach from him and plan about how to get a life going with Tom and Alice under my care...&quot; Holly glanced down to her human hands, the very ones she saved lives with. &quot;I had to make sure custody wouldn&#39;t drop to Trevor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor&#39;s life was set up,&quot; Balto flinched when Holly focused her gaze onto him, eyes ablaze. &quot;Not saying yours wasn&#39;t, but if the judges were involved and they cared about which parent would have an easier time paying for both, it would have been Trevor...&quot; <br />
<br />
Balto watched as Holly shifted into her kitsune form, her three tails splayed onto the bed as she spoke downcast. &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
His own tail wagged upon seeing the vixen form again, sexy and alluring. She continued unabated but her eyes returned to normal. &quot;Before you gave me this form, I would have run out of energy trying to work and provide the kids. School, food, housing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Holly growled out lightly. &quot;Trevor had everything already prepared.&quot;<br />
<br />
Upon that statement, memories came unbidden to his mind about the plans Trevor had set up. The big house in the suburbs, his high paying job as a police lieutenant, the nearby school he had already got them registered up to. The judges would have given him custody, no doubt about it. The whole plan Trevor had set up was going to wrest the children away from Holly, legally.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, Balto, let&#39;s move on from this somber topic. I obviously can&#39;t just have sex with you again for some time,&quot; Holly smiled and gave him a cheeky side-eye, letting out a giggle when Balto&#39;s eyes dilated and ears flattened. &quot;That time in the forest, you fucked me like Trevor did, I loved it of course, can&#39;t forget that, so that&#39;s why we need to chill out on the sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
Balthazar Nicolaus Phillips chuckled in mirth himself, crossing his thick arms over his chest. &quot;Does that mean I can&#39;t have you dick me down and fill me with your kits again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Holly gave him her best, mischievous smile as she held out a clawed hand. &quot;That probably should be a treat for you, paw.&quot;<br />
<br />
Balto chuckled and played along, placing a thick paw much bigger than hers into her waiting paw and then he leaned down, giving the back of her hand a kiss.<br />
<br />
Balto retreated as his gaze hardened with a sigh, turning serious. &quot;It&#39;s the punishment for Tommy that&#39;s the harder topic, for essentially ending two lives to make one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Holly and Balto both talked it out, harsh and soft punishments, up until Holly was tired, the discussion finished and a course of action was selected.<br />
<br />
Tomorrow, a new dawn would literally shine upon this family.</p>
