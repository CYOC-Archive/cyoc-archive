<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a minute or two of Jerry stretching his thin teenage body out and breathing deeply to come down from his orgasm, his thinner penis sprang right back to attention with all the vigor that a young teen&#39;s dick can easily recover from.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess I&#39;m not done yet,&quot; laughed Jerry as he reached down and started a second round of stroking his dick and thrusting with his hips. Shrink spurts seemed to have more impact on the young teen as he went from 14 to 13 rather quickly and lost what looked like a foot of height. What remained of his pubic hair now was gathered at the base of his shrinking dick, and Jerry&#39;s hands and feet were starting to look a little big for his increasingly childish looking pubescent body.<br />
<br />
&quot;c-Come on!&quot; cracked Jerry as his voice was losing its deeper register, ascending in pitch as he groaned. <br />
<br />
His pubic hair retreated at the same time his shrinking balls pulled back up into the sockets which they all rest in prepubescent boys and Jerry&#39;s once might penis had now shrunk to a veritably childish nub--which was still aroused with the confusing arousal of preadolescence when anything and everything could set it off for what seemed no reason. Ethan vaguely remembered those days himself and the confusion of what it meant until the puberty video was played in class. Jerry&#39;s strokes now became more tentative and more about curiosity rather than with any knowledge of what they meant. In fact the boy, as Jerry&#39;s prepubescent body could now most certainly have him be labelled as a boy, now just formed a hole with his hand and curiously thrusted his stiffie of a nub in and out of the hand, continuing to regress Jerry until even the random stiffie of preadolescence was too much to expect out of his boyhood. With the alter reality feature still checked, Ethan noticed that the semen that Jerry had expelled as a teenager all over his chest now was gone as his body hair. Ethan looked at the age counter and was surprised to see that Jerry had gone straight through middle school only to land up being 8 years and 3 months old--a third grader. Jerry had regressed himself all the way back to Elementary School--and Ethan&#39;s new memories now were hazy on the boy on his screen, until he saw the woman who had been adult Jerry&#39;s girlfriend re-enter the room, now wrapped in a robe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy&#39;s finished and now it&#39;s time for good little boys to take their baths,&quot; said his former girlfriend and now apparently his new mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I hafta?&quot; whined Jerry as he kicked his feet for her approach--which apparently the motion of which counted as a &quot;thrust&quot; or two with how his body moved and now Jerry was 7 years and 9 months old.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit, he&#39;s still getting younger, gotta stop this,&quot; said Ethan to himself, but even as he said it out loud there was another part of himself that wanted to see just how young Jerry could get.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if I don&#39;t have a good little boy, then I guess the... tickle monster will have to punish him,&quot; tutted the woman as she tickled Jerry a little on his rounding tummy that was starting the accumulate baby fat as his body and limbs were starting to bulk up again while shrinking--only this time with baby fat. Jerry giggled and kicked wildly at just a little tickled. Another four tickle assaults on Jerry&#39;s sides and feet, only caused him to kick and buck his hips even more, shrinking him further into young childhood and back into Kindergarten.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now are we going to get into the tub ourselves or do we want Mommy to pick us up?&quot; asked the woman to the boy on the verge of toddlerhood.<br />
<br />
Jerry, seemingly having given completely into the heady giddiness of a little boy coming down from a tickle attack defiantly declared &quot;No!&quot; while stretching a large smile across his face. That more than anything sealed his fate. This returned the tickle attack and pushed the boy back firmly into being a toddler as his laughs acquired an increasingly baby-like squeal of appeal that grew higher as he grew smaller and the woman soon scooped up her baby boy to fuss with as she tickled his shrinking feet until he looked almost as small as a newborn. Ethan looked at the age counter and saw Jerry was now only 3 months old. One last kick though caused Jerry to vanish and the woman to bend over and grab her belly as it swelled up like a balloon until she looked 9 months pregnant with Jerry. Though that seemed to not last long or Jerry wasn&#39;t an inactive baby fetus as the woman&#39;s pregnant belly seemed to shift before shrinking first to 6 months and then to 3 months along, and just barely looking pregnant at all, and it was there Ethan found the &quot;Accept Transformation&quot; button and clicked okay, before Jerry could get any younger and potentially not exist at all.<br />
<br />
Ethan sat there wide eyed and in disbelief and just how young Jerry had caused himself to get, and just how young he&#39;d waited until hitting stop. The implications of power behind this device caused Ethan&#39;s hands to shake as Jerry&#39;s former girlfriend, now mother named Alyssa placed a hand on her belly briefly before going back to the bathroom once again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got to be careful with how I use this...&quot; said Ethan.</p>
