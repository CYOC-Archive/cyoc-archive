<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Off in the distance, you saw what looked to be a rather large, brawny-looking guy in what looked to be some sort of security officer uniform or possibly a cop for the island to keep all the tourists in line... should they need it. You didn&#39;t think that a place like Pleasure Island would need any sort of policing, given its name... no police meant all sorts of pleasures to be had, whenever and wherever it was to take place. However, as you walked closer to him, it made sense that he was there to make sure things didn&#39;t get too out of hand and if they did, he&#39;d handle it. At the same time, you also thought that uniformed officers of all types needed to get some rest and relaxation from time to time... and what better place than Pleasure Island... if he was truly off duty that is. You were curious to know why he was there, what he was doing with his time there, and if there was anything he would recommend for a pussy hound like yourself. One of the reasons that you even came to Pleasure Island was because you heard that the place was where anything and everything was allowed there. Whatever your pleasure was, it was allowed, and even the most risque or taboo things were not off-limits. Not that you enjoyed things like that, but you knew there were others who were bound to. Being a relatively younger guy yourself, eighteen years of age, there were so many things that had been considered to be off-limits for you in the rest of civilization when you were younger. Your dad, the awesome guy that he is, allowed you to do things that he knew he shouldn&#39;t... like drinking alcohol and trying drugs... especially as a police officer, but he would always say that as long as it was under his roof and in a way that it could be controlled where you could experiment and get shit like that out of your system, he was fine with it. The one thing that you never really understood was why he would take stashes of drugs from lock up, when that could have meant his job, especially having been on the force for as long as he had been. A twenty-year veteran should know better, but it also meant he knew how to skirt the system to work on his behalf.<br />
<br />
As you get closer to the man in question, you started to notice things about the way he looked along with his uniform. You had never been there before, yet things about his size, his dominance, his profile, and even the way he held his thick and hairy-looking arms seemed familiar to you. You started to question whether you knew this person or not, wondering if you had ever seen them before or if they had been someone you passed on the street and never, consciously, took notice of. Another few steps closer and you could see the actual police uniform of the city where you lived was tightly plastered to his hulkingly massive body that was perfect for competing in a &quot;strongman&quot; competition, which you were honestly a bit jealous of. You were no slouch yourself when it came to the body department. You had taken care of yourself; you worked out daily, but you were never really able to make your body grow to be anything other than what people would call... &quot;athletic&quot;... even though you did have a little fat on your bones as well. You weren&#39;t someone that was into bodybuilding competitions where they would have nearly zero fat on them, tanned to the point where their skin looked like bronzed leather and showing every muscle sinew, or vein that laid just beneath the surface of the skin. That was actually a look that made your stomach queazy just by even thinking about it. There was just so much that seemed wrong about that, but if there was anything interesting about it... it was just seeing how a person could push the human body so far... like those actors who would put on or lose so much weight for a particular role. You just shook your head at the thought, knowing that something like that wasn&#39;t something you could ever even imagine yourself doing. Hell... you figured that there was no way doing such extreme things to your body could be even remotely healthy or just plain good to do. However... a strongman&#39;s build... man... that was always quite impressive to you! The fact that there was fat on the muscle just had a softer, more appealing look to it compared to the bony and rigid look not having fat had. Then there was the sheer power and strength that came with it and even though you weren&#39;t gay by any means, it was something that just turned you on and made you wish you could have yourself.<br />
<br />
Getting even closer to the man in question, you started to be able to see more and more of him clearly, and the faint nagging that you had earlier about how he looked like someone you knew was now like a persistent hum in your ear, buzzing around in your head like a gnat that got stuck in some earwax in your ear canal and was valiantly, though vainly, trying to use what little time and energy it had left to flutter its wings to get unstuck and survive another moment. &quot;Where and how do I know this guy?! I know I know him from somewhere!&quot; You thought to yourself not really being able to see his face clearly. Thinking there was no other choice and you had to know now, you increased your speed in your gait and made your way closer to him until you were in clear view and finally able to see exactly who it was standing there, which was...</p>
