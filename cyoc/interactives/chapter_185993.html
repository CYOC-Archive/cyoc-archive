<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I&#39;ve decided to redact the idea of the park being focused on changing people and then returning them back to normal once they left. I thought it would be more fun to explore the consequences of a more permanent change in an isolated incident. That&#39;s not to say the original idea wasn&#39;t good, just that this is the route I was more interested in, thanks and enjoy! </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Light enveloped the party as they ascended from the shadowed halls of the mirror maze. It was bright and hard to see, but as their eyes adjusted it became clear that the light before them was not sourced from the sun, but in fact a couple street lamps before them in the park. It had turned night somehow while they were inside, which was odd considering it had only been for ten minutes at the most. As Sam decided to take role call, he looked around but did not see the girls. Instead close by him were three pretty college coeds that looked super tall from his perspective.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shauna-&quot; He immediately clasped his hand over his mouth. Was that him? He heard a kid&#39;s voice just now as he spoke. A little kid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes who-wait is that my voice!? Wait Sandra is that you!? You look just like in the mirror!&quot; One of the women before Sam spoke, her voice oozing with a smokey sex appeal. Her skin was a rich brown with thick lips, a gorgeous face, and wide hips. Her butt was very large and round forming a heart shape, it seemed to jiggle each time she moved and looked like it was trying to rip open her tight orange capris. Her eyes were a deep forest green and her hair was up in a well maintained and sizable fro. Her whole body was thicc, curvaceous, and looked soft to the touch. As she turned to face Sam completely he could see that her breasts were quite large as well and looked like they might try to escape her ocean blue floral shirt, a floral shirt that was reminiscent of the one little Shauna had been wearing though more elaborate and with a deep v cup to display said generous cleavage. Sam knew at once, this was his little sister, albeit not so &#39;little&#39; anymore. It was her from the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy cow, Shauna you look so pretty! How did you-&quot; The even taller blonde next to her exclaimed, her voice was that of a stereotypical valley girl. &quot;Whoa I sound so different, this is so cool! Are we grown ups now!?&quot; Her skin was a tawny gold, an obvious sign she had been out in the sun often. Her hair was very thick and lush, streaming all the way down to the small of her back in a semi wave. Her hips wide, smaller than Shauna&#39;s, but with her tiny waist Sam really couldn&#39;t tell. As she turned to face him it was revealed that her tits were massive, quite noticeably larger than Shauna&#39;s, and somehow still quite perky; they looked as if they were trying to escape the white cropped tank top that contained them, and with here nipples showing directly through the shirt, it was apparent that she wasn&#39;t wearing a bra and might in fact have had them pierced. Her ass was tight and well shaped, a decent size but looked small when compared to her giant breasts, the cheeks were well framed in her short shorts which left little to the imagination. Her face was that of a runway model with high cheek bones and more angular features. Her eyes were large and a deep icy blue, the minute they met Sam&#39;s they seemed to pierce his very soul. Her lips were thick as well, not quite as much as Shauna&#39;s though but definitely what one would call &#39;blow job&#39; lips. &quot;Where&#39;s Sara? She&#39;s got to see this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right here...&quot; Out from the dark corners of the frontage of the ride stepped out a beautiful Asian woman. Her voice was soft and soothing, quite high on the register but definitely more mature than little Sara&#39;s. Her face was soft and glowing with not a mar on it. A small mole rested just above her thick reddish lips. Her eyes were an amber color that seemed to shimmer and catch the light at every angle. Her skin was a pearlescent white. Her smooth umber hair was straight and framed around her face with chopped bangs on her forehead. The purple knitted sweater she wore could not hide that she was infact stacked, the buttons on it seemed to strain against her robust bosom, ready to pop off at any moment. Her proportions were well balanced as her hips were also quite pronounced and her butt full and round in her stretched blue jeans. Sara looked to be the middle ground between the other two girls. Second place for bust, lip, and butt size. Also coming second in height and overall thickness. &quot;Were&#39;s Sam... I&#39;m scared...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you scared about!? You&#39;re a pretty grown-up too!&quot; Sandra bellowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, wait... is that you Sam!? You&#39;re so little!&quot; Shauna giggled, her assets shaking in the excitement. There was Sam, her older brother perhaps now her younger. Small, looking just like the little boy in the mirror. A semi-buzz cut for his black hair just like mom used to make him wear since it was easy. His frame was skinny and undeveloped, not a hint of puberty in his body. His t-shirt was now a red and white horizontal stripe pattern and his jeans were baggy and washed out since they always had a hard time finding something that fit him when he was younger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look guys, here&#39;s a height chart at the front entrance!&quot; Sandra rushed to the spot, her giant breasts hopping up and down the whole way. Kicking off her heels she called to her friend &quot;How tall am I Shauna?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;6&#39;2, whoa you&#39;re taller than my dad!&quot; Shauna ran over to swap with Sandra whose eyes were beaming at her new found height. Shauna didn&#39;t bother taking off her Prussian blue flats &quot;What about me!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Says 5&#39;7!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that tall?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It kinda is for a girl.&quot; Sam interjected, immediately regretting it by the expression that it put on the girls&#39; faces.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my gosh you sound like a little boy!&quot; Shauna laughed<br />
<br />
&quot;And look like one too!&quot; Sandra joined in.<br />
<br />
&#39;Hey I&#39;m still you&#39;re older brother!&quot; He squeaked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not even, I&#39;m definitely you&#39;re older sister now I mean look at you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, check his height on the chart!&quot; Sandra chimed. Sam tried to run as the two much larger woman came to grab him but it was no use, they were way stronger, in fact as he was held in Sandra&#39;s and Shauna&#39;s arms he could see that they had some muscle definition as well, though it was much more prevalent in Sandra. They forced off his light up sneakers &quot;No way, you&#39;re only 3&#39;7, that&#39;s way shorter than any of us were!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on guys you don&#39;t have to tease him, I&#39;m sure this is really hard for him.&quot; Sara pulled Sam away from his tormentors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait you&#39;ve got to go next Sara, let&#39;s see how tall you are!&quot; Sandra insisted as she nudged Sara towards the chart. Sara took off her white ankle booties.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like 5&#39;9&quot; Shauna checked.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is so cool, we&#39;re all tall and pretty adults now, we should go do grown up stuff!&quot; Sandra jumped up and down yet again, her knockers flinging this way and that.<br />
<br />
&quot;No you guys, we need to get back in there and fix thi-&quot; Sam began<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, that&#39;s not happening.&quot; Sandra approached him, towering over his form. Sam only came up to the bottom of her hips when she was wearing her heels. Sandra was the tallest, the strongest, and the most confident of the bunch. Her breasts were so big that when the two stood close enough he could not as see her face as he craned his neck to look at her and a shadow was cast upon his form by her generous bosom.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we should listen to Sam, I mean what are our parent&#39;s going to say?&quot; Sara&#39;s ghost of a voice blurted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who cares!? We&#39;re adults now, they can&#39;t tell us what to do.&quot; Sandra chuffed. She grabbed Sam by the wrist. &quot;Besides, I like Sam like this, he can&#39;t push us around any more. Don&#39;t you prefer having a little brother more Shauna?&quot; Although they were still acting like children, Sam could tell their vocab was getting better by the minute.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very much so! You can&#39;t boss us around because I&#39;m the older sister. I&#39;m in charge of you now.&quot; Shauna smirked and stuck her tongue out at her brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just because you look like adults, doesn&#39;t mean that you are adults!&quot; Sam spat. Sandra was forming her rebuttal until something caught her eye from a dark corner of the maze front. She gave Shauna Sam&#39;s arm then strut over into the darkness in her 3-inch red heals and in seconds returned with two handbags and a very small back pack. She began to rummage through the bags and found wallets in each, each with an ID for one of the three girls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, then explain this dummy!&quot; She presented the three IDs to Sam, then handed the blue purse to Shauna, the black mini backpack to Sara, and took the red designer bag for herself. Sam scrutinized the documents and discovered with great fear they were driver&#39;s licenses, all which stated the girls were 21 years of age, old enough to drink in his state. Sandra then grabbed him by the arm again as Shauna let go.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are, ok sis, we&#39;re all done.&quot; It was Josh, along with Tom and Ashley, Sam&#39;s friends and his girlfriend. Sam was relieved to see them at first until he realized they didn&#39;t look surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my gosh, Josh you look so small now!&quot; Sandra fawned over her once older brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? I&#39;m still growing, just you wait, I bet I&#39;ll be taller than you when I grow up!&quot; He swung back his blonde hair out of his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean you don&#39;t remember me smaller...?&quot; Sandra furrowed her brow.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, maybe like five years ago, what are you on about now Sandra?&quot; He scrunched his face, ready for some sort of prank to be revealed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... nothing...&quot; The gears in Sandra&#39;s head began to turn. &quot;Well then yeah, I think its time to go... little brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! Ashley don&#39;t you remember me!? Its Sam, we started going out three months ago?&quot; Sam became desperate and emotional, he felt like he was about to cry, unable to escape Sandra&#39;s grasp. He looked on to Ashley, Josh, and Tom pleadingly but Ashley looked at him like a sad puppy, Josh looked annoyed, and Tom hadn&#39;t looked up once from his DS since the whole exchange began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, that&#39;s a sweet thought  little Sammy,  you&#39;re awful cute but-&quot; Ashley bent down her long red curls draping around her face like curtains to a window with a lovely view. Light strawberry freckles were scatter along her pretty porcelain face. Her eyes were a mix between emerald and sapphire, and she was a bit precocious at 13 having already grown a nice pair of full 33C cup breasts; this Sam knew from their exploratory make out sessions. She also had some recognizable curves with a decent butt and burgeoning hips on a tiny waist. Sam now only came up to waist height of the 5&#39;2 woman in the making.<br />
<br />
&quot;But she&#39;s got a boyfriend.&quot; Josh, his old best friend, intercepted with great self satisfaction. &quot;Just be happy she spends her time babysitting you bud, its nothing more than that kid.&quot; Josh stood only an inch taller than Ashley, though quite tall for a 12 year-old boy. He started school a year early and always had a crush on Ashley. He was jealous of Sam, at least back when Sam was her boyfriend but that obviously was the case no longer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you don&#39;t have to be a dick about it Josh.&#39; Ashley protested. &quot;When you&#39;re older little guy, Im sure you&#39;ll be breaking all kinds of girls hearts.&quot; She pat Sam on his head and ruffled his short curly hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for giving her a break on watching him by the way, the alone time was appreciated.&quot; Josh pulled Ashley in close and copped a little at her breasts, but only for an instant. Ashley shot him a wicked side eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.. of course... anything for you little bro.&quot; She grinned devilishly at Sam who now had visible tears in his eyes. &quot;Ladies, I think I need to use the potty, come with?&quot; She began walking with Sam still in her grip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait I&#39;m not allowed in there, why am I coming with?&quot; He struggled with all his might but couldn&#39;t escape her grip as she dragged him into the woman&#39;s restroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re allowed where ever I say you&#39;re allowed, got it?&quot; She tugged him into the bathroom and stood before her friends with a wicked grin and wide eyes. &quot;Ok, so... between the ID&#39;s and my old-&quot; She stopped herself, &quot;Well once older, now younger brother acting like this is how it has always been, I don&#39;t think we have to worry about anyone. Isn&#39;t that right little Sammy?&quot; Sandra bent down far just to look Sam in this face, a vindictive gaze drawn upon her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine I get it, you want to be adults but, there&#39;s a lot of stuff you don&#39;t know. And if you don&#39;t know that stuff then its going to get you into trouble!&quot; Sam was trying with all his will to make a plea to the girls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then we&#39;ll just figure it out as we go.&quot; Shauna responded, looking at her gorgeous face in the mirror with deep fascination. &quot;I felt a weird buzz in my purse and found out I have a cell phone so I can just Google something if I need it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok fine but... why can&#39;t you just let me change back!?&quot; Now he began to bawl. &quot;My own girlfriend thinks she&#39;s just my baby sitter and my best friend is dating her!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now whose acting like a child?&quot; Sandra laughed<br />
<br />
&quot;You never cared when I cried because you wouldn&#39;t share, or you wouldn&#39;t let me do something I wanted to do so, let this be a lesson!&quot; Shauna swung around to face Sam. &quot;Besides, no ones going to listen to a kid so you won&#39;t be able to stop us!&quot; <br />
<br />
Sara charged forward and took Sam from Sandra&#39;s grip, holding him in her engorged bosom as she knelt down to hug and comfort the boy &quot;Guys stop! You&#39;re just being jerks for no reason! Let&#39;t just take him back and-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you try that Sara, we&#39;ll-we&#39;ll&quot; At first Sandra looked panicked but again the devil soon shown in her cold blue eyes and a calm befell her form &quot;We&#39;ll take you both back and force you into infants, right Shauna?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shauna twitched for a moment from that last part. She looked over Sandra. She was so much taller than her and her arms and legs looked strong. &quot;Yeah, hes not worth it Sara.&quot; she hesitantly agreed. <br />
<br />
Sara brought her rich red lips very close to Sam&#39;s ear and began to whisper &quot;Don&#39;t worry, its only for a little while, I&#39;ll get you back here somehow, just give me some time.&quot; Sam&#39;s tears began to dry, between the soft and familiar matronly warmth of Sara&#39;s body and her gentle voice which carried such kind words, he found the strength to continue on and compose himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then that settles it! We&#39;re leaving! Time to start our new lives girls.&quot; Sandra led the group out of the restroom and grabbed onto Sam&#39;s arm right as he and Sara were exiting the door frame.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sandra its fine I&#39;ve got him-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No Sara, I&#39;m not going to let you pull anything stupid. He&#39;s under MY watch now, got it?&quot; She looked down upon her quiet friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine.&quot; Sara rolled her eyes and moved on. As the girl reunited with the younger teenagers, the group headed towards the parking lot. Sandra began to walk towards the bus stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sandra uh.. where are you going. You drove here!&quot; Josh bellowed, the gap between then halting as he did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah right, sure.&quot; She scanned the parking lot and was at a complete loss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you forget where you parked again?&quot; Her brother groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uuuuuhhhh, yeah-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well pull out your dongle thingy and find it, I have to take Ashley home soon or her dad&#39;s gonna kill me!&quot; Ashley uncomfortably shrunk into herself, mouthing a &#39;sorry&#39; to the much taller Sandra. &quot;Gosh your such a ditz sometimes.&quot; Josh continued<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah! Like mommy does!&quot; Sandra started rummaging through her purse, her brother squinting in her direction after hearing his sister say &#39;mommy.&#39; After a thorough search, she found keys in her bag and pressed the button that looked like an unlocked lock. A beeping sound could be heard in the east along with a red and white flash of lights. The party followed it over to a large white Suburban and began to load themselves into the car. Shauna took shotgun, Ashley and Josh took to the very back, while Tom and Sam sat to either side of Sara in the middle row. &quot;Ok ummmm, yeah, alright.&quot; Sandra&#39;s hands were now clammy. She have no idea how to drive a car. Sure she&#39;d seen her mommy do it tons of times but this was different. Sam watched on, now somewhat amused, he could tell what was going on in the front seat simply by the fact that the car had not been moving for a minute.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we get a move on please!?&quot; Josh groaned from the back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up and give me a minute dork!&quot; Sandra turned in her seat and shot daggers at her now younger brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey.&quot; Shauna nudged her best friend with a hushed tone. She put her phone in Sandra&#39;s face with a pdf on its screen. &quot;I googled how to drive and then this popped up, maybe you can read it real fast?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Read it? But I hate reading...&quot; Sandra looked exacerbated but with no other course of action began to read through the document. Weirdly enough, she kept running into words that she didn&#39;t know but they just seemed to register anyways. The topic felt familiar as if she did learn to drive before and that all this was just a quick refresher. She also found that she read a lot faster than she used to, only really glancing at the important words and phrases. The next thing Sandra knew, everything just clicked. Any info she needed from the task that had been missing from what she read just seemed to fill its own gap, and once again a self satisfied smile brimmed on her face. She put the keys in the ignition and started the car. Turned on her headlights, adjusted her seat belt and  &quot;Alright, what&#39;s the address again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I already texted it to you!&quot; Josh once again decided to show just how irritated and impatient he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right.&quot; Sandra checked her phone, copied the address, then put it in maps. Sam was incredibly anxious by this point, was she just going to drive without knowing anything? She could crash and get them all killed! But much to his surprise, she pulled out of the parking spot with relative ease, checking all her blind spots, it was as if she have been doing this for years. Shauna, Sara, and Sam sat with their mouths agape as Sandra drove on. The drive was strange for all of the now adult woman. The way their well endowed bodies would shake and sway with any bumps or major vibrations felt so foreign, and none of them really had time yet to understand or truly explore who they were now. Sara especially felt awkward. Sam kept looking at her which was unusual. When she was still her small six year-old self, Sam only really looked at her to make sure she was alive and alright and she had always lived for those moments. But now he kept glancing at her huge chest. He kept staring at her thick thighs and her sizable butt and hips, and whenever she caught him doing so he would look away with flushed cheeks. As she held his hand through the car ride, the little boy&#39;s hand began to sweat a lot and felt cold. Sam felt strange the whole way too. The girls were so incredibly beautiful now, especially Sara. Sam had never noticed how kind and beautiful she was, I mean how could he when she looked like a little kid before? But he didn&#39;t ever think for a moment that she would grow into such a perfect sculpture of a woman. She was warm and soft and smelled really nice too. Shauna kept looking at her new body. Everything on her felt so big. She noticed too that if she brushed her chest, her inner thighs, or her crotch it felt really good. She wanted to learn why and she couldn&#39;t wait to get home to take her clothes off and really get a good look at how beautiful she really was. Just glancing in the mirror she could tell that she was prettier than her mom even. Sandra was also feeling new sensations almost constantly. Her crotch felt wet and she wondered if she might have wet herself accidentally when she was panicked earlier. She kept having to adjust her new breasts because they kept slipping out of her shirt. She also found that when her nipples slipped around across the fabric it made her wetter and it felt really nice. She just wanted to rub herself all over and kept having images of something going her in and out of her vagina pop in her head. It was strange but somehow seemed really nice to her.<br />
<br />
Much to the transformed children&#39;s surprise Sandra stopped at every stop light and stop sign that she needed to, the turns and breaks were pretty smooth with the exception of a couple and within a matter of 10 minutes, the car had safely arrived at its intended location, parked without scrapping on the curb. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you so much for taking me with you guys, I had a lot of fun!&quot; Ashley got up from the back and opened one of the side doors. &quot;Thanks for driving me Sandra, I&#39;ll try and teach your brother to be less of a dick!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Josh interjected<br />
<br />
&quot;You were a dick...&quot; Tom, for the first time since Sam had seen him post transformation, finally spoke in a low and tired voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please do! Have a good night!&quot; Sandra waved at Ashley with her whole face in a smile<br />
<br />
&quot;Ill walk you to the door...&quot; Josh exited the door along side his girlfriend and began to walk into the darkness of the night, their path set on the front porch light. Tom got up from his seat next to Sara and moved to the back row.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sandra that was so cool! I can&#39;t believe you did that!&quot; Shauna praised the busty blonde.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was soo easy, it was like walking, nothing to it.&quot; Sandra bent herself around the drivers seat, her face close to Sam&#39;s, her cavernous cleavage splayed out before him with her eraser head nipples slipping out the top of her tank into view. Sam&#39;s tiny dick began to harden, as much as he hated her, his body was right, she was really hot now. &quot;See little Samuel.&quot; Her voice stayed low. She noticed his eyes were glued to her chest. Something inside her instinctual knew that he wanted to touch them, that maybe boys liked what was on his chest, that her body gave her even more power than just brute strength and age based authority. &quot;I&#39;m in charge now, I&#39;m the older one, and you&#39;re just a little boy who wishes he could touch my boobies.&quot; She shook them in his face making all the blood in his body boil to his dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sandra... How did you drive the car like that... how did you know?&quot; Sara&#39;s face was puzzled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we just googled it.&quot; Shauna shrugged<br />
<br />
&quot;No. You were 6 years old, all but maybe 30 minutes ago, we all were. And of all three of us you were the worst in school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you calling me stupid? And anyway, I don&#39;t know, it just came to me.&quot; Sandra shifted in her seat, she wasn&#39;t sure if she wanted to tell Sara. Sara was always the smartest one of them. if she could figure out enough stuff, then maybe she would find a way to turn Sam back. Or even worse, maybe she would find a way to turn herself and Shauna back as well. It was best to keep her in the dark whenever possible she thought. Suddenly the door shifted open. Josh had returned with a red mark on his neck. He sat in the back with Tom, who now that Ashley had finally left, became very talkative with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok then, whose next?&quot; Sandra scanned the seats behind for a response.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d be me.&quot; Tom finally lifted his head from his DS, revealing a face with one brown eye and one green. His face was still somewhat obscured by his long black hair that was choppy at best. He was pretty skinny, and definitely less athletic looking than Josh but the two surprisingly had a lot in common. &quot;Oh and my address should still be in your messages I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool sounds good.&quot; This was staring to get easier and easier by the second for Sandra. She pulled the car out of park yet again and drove off, aligning herself with the GPS&#39;s directions. The longer she drove, the more the new sensations of her body called to her, it was beginning to make her breath somewhat heavier. She kept adjusting her hips. She just needed some time alone to explore these feelings. Luckily Tom&#39;s house was only 5 minutes away from Ashley&#39;s. Tom just kinda waved to everyone and hopped out of the car after giving Josh a fist bump. &quot;Ok then. Looks like we&#39;re taking you home next Sara.&quot; Sara knew this was on purpose. Something told her Sandra did not want to be alone with her. She wanted her out of the equation as soon as possible so that she could prevent her and Sam from returning to the park to fix this. &quot;Oh and look at that, I have your address saved on my phone already.&quot; Sandra boasted at her, her chest puffed out making her tits look even larger. As Sandra followed the GPS directions though, all of the girls started to realize that they were not headed for the house that they knew Sara lived at.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are you going Sandra?&quot; Sara was starting to get really concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look I&#39;m just following the GPS directions.&quot; Sandra pulled into a drive way with two cars and a porch light still on. &quot;It says this is your house.&quot; Sara was very nervous now but some instinct inside her told her that Sandra was actually right. Had she moved out of her parent&#39;s house already?<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummm. Ok.&quot; Sara reached into her bag and search out her keys but then a thought occurred to her. She found a pad of sticky notes and a pen as well inside and quickly scrawled out the phone number of her new cell phone. She then slide it in Sam&#39;s pocket while Sandra and Shauna looked at the GPS inquisitively. &quot;This is my number. Call me when you&#39;re alone and we can make a plan.&quot; She pulled her keys out, zipped the bag up and headed for the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait Sara are you sure!?&quot; Shauna hung a worried expression on her face.<br />
<br />
&#39;Yeah... something is telling me I live here, its ok.&quot; Sara tried to hide her nerves. When her long thick legs made contact with the ground outside, Sam couldn&#39;t help but feel any hope left inside him die. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Sam, it&#39;ll be ok.&quot; She held his chin smiled and kissed him on the forehead, it was genuine and sweet and suddenly filled Sam with a familiar warmth. The warmth of a childhood crush. Oh no, was he crushing on his little sister&#39;s friend? That wasn&#39;t right, he was 13 and she 6... well not anymore, but still! The door behind her shut and Sara ventured off to the front door of the house, dreading each step as she did, completely unsure as to what would await her when she stepped inside. She looked through her keys and found one that felt right. She placed it in the key hole and turned the lock. She could hear it click. She touched the handle and with caution quietly opened the door. She stepped inside the realm of uncertainty and shut what was left of the familiar behind her deep into the night.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man I hope she&#39;s ok...&quot; Shauna turned to Sandra. &quot;I mean we were really mean to her and now she&#39;s in some place we don&#39;t even know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well maybe she lives alone.&quot; Sandra postulated, trying to bury any guilt she had.<br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt it, there&#39;s two cars.&quot; Sam sweat. &quot;We can&#39;t just leave her there without making sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine I&#39;ll text her.&quot; Sandra pull out her phone, but before she even could open the messenger, she already had an answer. She had received a text from Sara herself with a picture of her and a furry little ball of cuteness &#39;I have a puppy!&#39; the text read. &quot;Oh she&#39;s fine see.&quot; She displayed the photo to both Shauna and Sam which eased their anxiety a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about the second car?&quot; Shauna asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t know, maybe its the dog&#39;s&quot; She stuck her tongue out, revealing a stud on it, pulled the car out of park once again and drove onward. Another 10 minutes and there they were at a familiar site. The same house that Sam and Shauna had lived in since the two could both remember; porch light beckoning them to return. &quot;Ok, so. Keep an eye on your little brother,&quot; Sandra stressed those last two words &quot;and keep me posted on anything new ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely, I won&#39;t let the little guy get into any trouble,&quot; Shauna mused, her voice ringing like a bell &quot;Ill text you tomorrow!&quot; The two girls hugged, and despite him knowing better, Sam watched on as their large mammaries smooshed together and partially fell out of their revealing attire. Shauna grabbed her purse and exited the vehicle. She swung open the side door and put her hand out. &quot;Alright little bro, get out, its bed time for you.&quot; A smile was stretched upon her inflated lips. Sam couldn&#39;t do more than sigh and simply follow his &#39;big&#39; sister&#39;s orders. He just needed to buy time and find an opening by which Sara could take him to the park, or maybe he could somehow hop on a bus or something. For now though, all he could do is plot and plan, bide his time before fixing everything. He held onto Shauna&#39;s hand. It was much larger than his now and had blue nails. He only came up to the top of her hips, and what hips they were. They were soo wide and her ass was huge, especially with how small her waist was. He knew it was his sister but he couldn&#39;t help but pop another boner at the sight of her. She honestly looked so much like the girls he would watch online on porn websites, maybe even better. As Shauna unlocked the door, the two entered and were out of sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did she just call him her little brother?&quot; Josh yawned in the back seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh what was that little bro?&quot; Sandra lazily turned, the yearning sensation in her groin growing stronger and more distracting.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought she just called him her little brother... I could have sworn he was her nephew.&quot; He yawned again, having dozed off after Tom left. &quot;Any way can we stop for a shake on the way home?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sandra snorted, almost laughed. With a quick text to Shauna she let her know this newest detail and then drove off towards a drive-thru, and eventually home.</p>
