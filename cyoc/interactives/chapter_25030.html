<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">"...Go Fish!"
<br><br>
"Okay," Peter said.  "But what are the special rules we should play by?"
<br><br>
Mark piped in, "What about for every set of four cards you collect, you grow how ever many inches the cards add up to be.  
<br><br>
"So if you have four fives, you get twenty inches?" Ty asked.
<br><br>
"Exactly,"  Mark said.  "But if you do take a card from someone, you don't get another turn."
<br><br>
"What about face cards?" Dustin asked.
<br><br>
"Hmm..."  Mark thought.
<br><br>
"I know!" Toby shouted.  "For every set of face cards, you get older.  One year for every Jack, Two for every Queen, and Three for every King."
<br><br>
"Sounds fair,"  Ty said.  "Lets begin!"
<br><br>
Toby ran to get a deck of cards, and they all sat in a circle in the living room.
<br><br>
"Boy, if anyone dominates at this game, they have the chance to become absolutely huge!" Ty said.
<br><br>
"Yeah, but if they get all the face cards, they'd become 24 years older,"  Peter said.  "That'd make me almost 40!"
<br><br>
"Let's hope it's balanced, then."  Dustin said.  
<br><br>
Toby shuffled the cards, and dealt seven cards to each player, leaving 17 cards for the 'pond.'
<br><br>
Mark went first.  "Toby, do you have any tens?"  "Go fish," Toby replied.  Mark drew a card from the pond.
<br><br>
Peter was next.  "Dustin, do you have any threes?"  "Go fish," Dustin said.  Peter also drew a card.
<br><br>
Ty's turn.  "Toby, do you have any twos?"  Toby handed Ty two cards.  Ty then put four twos down.  "I win the first set!"  Ty said.  He started growing eight inches, filling out his shirt a little and having his legs stick out a couple of inches from his pants.  He was now 6'3".
<br><br>
"Yeah, but it's just a small growth."  Dustin said.  "My turn.  Peter, do you have any Jacks?"  "Go fish," Peter replied.  Dustin drew a card from the deck.
<br><br>
Toby's turn:  "Dustin, do you have any fives?"  "Go fish," Dustin replied, and Toby took a card.
<br><br>
Back to Mark:  "Dustin, do you have any Jacks?"  Dustin handed him a card, and Mark put it down with three other Jacks.  "Dude, Mark, that's four years of aging.  Are you ready for it?"  Mark giggled, "Yeah!  Here I go!"  His facial structures began to change, and he slowly grew from being 4'2" to 5'0".  His clothes started to rip at the seams as he stretched the fabric.  Finally, he stopped at twelve years old.  "This is so cool," he said, his voice a little bit deeper.
<br><br>
It was now Peter's turn.  "Toby, do you have any nines?"  "Go Fish," Toby said, and Peter drew a card.
<br><br>
Ty: "Toby, do you have any Aces?"  Toby handed Ty a card, and Ty added it to his hand.
<br><br>
"Ty, do you have any Kings?"  Dustin asked.  "Go fish,"  Ty replied, and Dustin took a card.
<br><br>
Toby:  "Mark, do you have any Queens?"  "Go fish", Mark said.  Toby took a card, and then took it and three from his hand and put them down.  They were all Queens.  "Woohoo!  Puberty here I come.  I'm going to stand up for this."  He did so, as he began to inch taller, from 4'0" to 5'0", as his facial structures grew into that of a young teenager.  His clothes stretched out, and his shirt began to reveal a well-defined stomach as he lost his baby fat.  He then hit a growth spurt and sprout up to 6'0" in a matter of seconds, nearly losing his balance as he did.  His feet expanded and burst out of his shoes.  His pants ripped at the waist and fell down, revealing a pair of very-tightly stretched boxer-briefs barely hiding a well-sized package. He peeled off the last shreds of his shirt and looked down at himself, admiring his new body as the transformation came to a hault.
<br><br>
"Wow," Ty said, "You're a pretty good-looking fifteen-year-old, Toby."
<br><br>
"Thanks," Toby said.  His voice had deepend considerably.  He sat back down at the game, still wearing only the boxer shorts.
<br><br>
It was Mark's turn now.  "Toby, do you have any fours?"  Toby handed Mark a card, and he played it with three others.  He grew 16 inches, becoming 6'4" and also being reduced to his underwear, a pair of white briefs.
<br><br>
Peter:  "Ty, do you have any threes?"  Ty handed him two cards, and Peter put them down with two of his cards to make a set.  "Allright, another foot taller!"  He grew to 6'5", becoming the largest in the room.
<br><br>
Ty:  "Dustin, do you have any Aces?"  Dustin gave Ty a card, which he then added three cards to make a set.  He set them down and grew another four inches, topping Peter at 6'7".
<br><br>
Dustin: "Ty, do you have any Kings?"  "Go fish", Ty replied, and Dustin took a card.
<br><br>
Toby's turn: "Dustin, do you have any fives?"  Dustin handed Toby two cards, and he took two from his hand and made a set.  "Wow,"  Peter exclaimed, "another twenty inches of growth!"  Toby smiles as he started stretching upward.  As he did so, his underwear finally gave way and burst apart.  He stopped at 7'8", towering over everyone else even while sitting, and completely naked.
<br><br>
Mark had one card left, so he asked, "Peter, do you have any tens?"  Peter shook his head and said, "Lucky dog," and handed Mark three tens, and Mark put the set down.  "All right, 40 inches, the biggest growth yet!" Mark exclaimed.  He stood up and stretched for the ceiling, growing rapidly as he did so, while still retaining his twelve-year-old proportions.  His growth forced his shaggy red hair into the ceiling, and created a little crater as he grew a few inches more.  He finally stopped, the tallest twelve-year-old in the world at 9'8".  He laughed as he looked down at his massive body, and the other puny boys around him.
<br><br>
"Well, I think I won the game, guys."  His voice boomed through the house.    
<br><br>
"Yep, you sure did,"  Ty replied.  "So what do you want to do now?"
<br><br>
"Hmmm..."  Mark pondered this for a moment.</p>
