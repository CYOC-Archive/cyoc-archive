<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave thought hard about his decision whichever form he picked would be what he used at work for his first day, and maybe even the coming weeks. He didn&#39;t know when or what he would switch his next form to be.<br />
&quot;The boss said i should pick something &quot;eccentric&quot;, I doubt it would ever happen but I&#39;ve got to pick something I won&#39;t get bored with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave walked over to a small rack with what appeared to be full body suits. Some were furry, some had scales, some had feathers, some where completely smooth to the touch. As he went down the row he noticed something different about one of the body suits. Almost every other one on the rack had two legs for, of course, the wearers two legs. Dave however found one that was just essentially a giant sock, It was long too.<br />
<br />
Out of curiosity Dave took the body suit off of the rack. It looked and felt like any other cheap artificial scale pattern. &quot;How could this possibly have any transformative properties?&quot; he thought to himself. Dave then decided to take a look on the inside of the suit which just happened to  look like a bright pink moist rubbery sheath. &quot;Very inviting.&quot; he thought.<br />
His curiosity was getting the better of him. Dave continued to look around the room at other things, but he couldn&#39;t get that body suit off of his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can try it on for a bit, I doubt it does anything, and if I don&#39;t like it I&#39;ll just take it off.&quot; He checked his watch. &quot;Yeah, I have plenty of time before we open.&quot; <br />
Dave walked over to the bench he put the body suit on. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, here goes nothing.&quot; Dave whispered<br />
<br />
He undressed himself down to his bare skin, the room wasn&#39;t cold but it did have a draft from an air vent, only encouraging Dave to get into the suit faster. First went in his right leg, than his left. The damp pinkish rubber lining the interior immediately made Dave cringe a bit. It felt like used sweaty gym clothes, though it didn&#39;t smell like such. So he kept going.<br />
Dave found the two arm holes and hoisted them up to his shoulders. They felt the same as the single leg hole. The torso also clung on to Dave&#39;s belly and back with the &quot;sweat&quot; like fluid.<br />
There was a full body mirror in the room.<br />
Dave hobbled over to it like a kid in a potato sack race. He looked in the mirror to see what looked like a potato sack.<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew this wouldn&#39;t do anything&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave decided his efforts where in the wrong object and prepared to take off the hideous suit. He began to pull on the gloves on the end of the sleeves, however they wouldn&#39;t budge. Dave thought he knew what was going on. But just to be sure he gave a second even harder tug on his right glove. As he went in to grab the scaly glove he realized he felt it! Not felt it through the material, but as if the gloves where his own skin!<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, that&#39;s trippy.&quot; Dave thought he had never had any transformation experiences of his own. Only things he read about online before the Trans-F business started and hearing online friends talk about their Trans-F gear.<br />
The sensation went from his finger tips all the way up to his forearms, than his elbows, than his shoulders. The whole suit seemed to be getting tighter, hotter, and more comfortable at the same time as if it was melting away. <br />
The interesting thing though is that the suit wasn&#39;t really melting, but rather he was inside of the suit. <br />
He felt his legs getting hotter and sweatier, as if they were under enormous pressure. The major bones within his legs seemed to feel like they where dissolving and moving towards his spinal cord. They just felt like a thick soup in a sturdy bag.<br />
Dave was far too occupied with his legs that he didn&#39;t even notice his arms and torso. The fake looking rubbery scale material had morphed into a beautiful spectrum of black green and gold scales! Real scales!<br />
Dave pinched himself in the hip and sure enough he felt as if he was pinching his own human skin. Just then something horrifying happened, something Dave wouldn&#39;t have expected. His fingers where elongating, by many inches.<br />
<br />
His once normally proportioned 19 year old boy finger have expanded up to six inches long, Turned into grotesque monster hands. And to make things even more creepy his hands started to grow nails. Long, sharp, black, nails. Dave had never had painted nails or anything, so this came at a somewhat interesting surprise. The sight of his hands was a little too much for Dave, so he decided to go back to looking at his legs.<br />
<br />
By now his legs where almost one whole appendage, though it was still quite short, shorter than his normal legs. Then Dave did see something that totally caught him off guard. His torso, specifically his crotch remained unchanged, as if they where still just inside the cheap scale material. It certainly felt that way as well. <br />
<br />
Dave felt an eruption in where his feet used to be. He turned around to see that his new tail had increased in many feet, and was growing at an alarming rate. The tail was already longer than his original legs and it seemed to no longer feel like mush. While looking back Dave remembered about the mirror in the room. He wanted to get a better look but wasn&#39;t at the right angle and he felt too uncomfortable moving with a single tail.<br />
<br />
Dave tried his best to twist his newly formed muscles to slither him across the room to look at what he&#39;s become. He only got a quick glance before he slammed on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT WAS THAT!&quot; Dave thought as he tried to recompose himself.<br />
<br />
He hoisted himself up using one of the benches in the room and noticed in the mirror  a face identical to his own staring back at him with scales creeping up his neck and cheeks. &quot;How did I not notice this earlier, or feel it at the very least.&quot; He got closer to the mirror and observed the scales spreading. He could actually watch them slowly consume his face. The scales began accelerating after they had taken his whole neck, and his chin and his lips, soon with the rest of his face following after.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe any of this, It&#39;s just too crazy.&quot; he thought as he plopped himself up on one of the benches. His tail seemed to stop growing at about 7 feet, possibly a little longer, leaving him with a greenish-gold body with black stripes across his back and down his tail. Dave watched as his eyebrows and short dark brown hair where sucked into his face and scalp respectively, leaving him entirely bald as the scales enveloped the last of his head.<br />
<br />
Dave looked down to see that his front torso, from collarbone to penis had still remained unchanged. &quot;That sure is confusing, why haven&#39;t any of those things changed yet.&quot; He pondered to himself, scratching the back of his head with his long black claws. It was then when Dave realized that there was something protruding out of the back of his head. It felt hard as if it was made of cartridge or some other thick fleshy substance. He looked back into the mirror to see a now fully scaley face and what appeared to be a cobra hood slowly fanning out from the back of his head.<br />
<br />
Then all of a sudden two places of interest became active at once, his face and his torso. His ears on his head shrunk until nothing remained but two black holes, while his nose and mouth appeared to be jutting outwards in some sort of semi-snout, and his eyes went from the rich chocolate brown colour to a more sinister golden yellow as his pupil changed from a more mammalian shape to a reptilian. It no longer looked like his face, but Dave still found the face very attractive for some odd reason. He never really considered himself as a type that enjoyed antrho animals, he&#39;s not even sure why he decided to go with a Naga suit.<br />
<br />
Then he looked down to see that most of the rubbery scale material had since changed into living reptilian scales. He looked closer trying to determine what would become of his penis. He couldn&#39;t see it through the still changing fabric. He couldn&#39;t feel it either. Dave reached out his clawed hand down to his nether regions. he poked at the flesh and felt nothing. He raised his hand slightly higher to where the fabric was still mostly rubber, and not flesh. By now his naval had also been converted to scales as well as everything above it. The only place untouched by his new form was the spot where his penis was, no, is supposed to be. Dave stared at it for a while before he made his move, until he saw something emerging from the corner of his eye. Two mounds of burgeoning flesh started growing where women&#39;s breasts usually are.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO NO NO,&quot; Now Dave was really against having worn this suit. He watched in horror as the breasts grew from being non-existent, to decently sized, round, perky, sacks on his torso. The breasts where getting way too big &quot;STOP! STOP!&quot; Dave prayed. Eventually the the breasts did stop at a large, but not unbearable or inconvenient size. After his two new pillows where done inflating, Dave took a peak at where his penis used to be. It wasn&#39;t there, but something else was. He took one of his clawed fingers and poked the mystery spot. His, now her, worst fears have been confirmed.<br />
<br />
&quot;How could have I been that dumb! To get a f*cking female naga suit! I could&#39;ve picked any other thing in the store!&quot;<br />
Dave did not recognize the voice coming out of her mouth. It was the first time she talked since he became a she.<br />
&quot;How am I looking on time.&quot; Dave said as she looked up at the clock. &quot;IT&#39;S ONLY BEEN 10 F*CKING MINUTES!&quot;<br />
&quot;THAT FELT LIKE A F*CKING ETERNITY!&quot; Dave thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, It looks like I have enough time to switch to a different costume if I really want to.&quot; She thought &quot;Or I could just go up right now, as I am, and see Mr. Gregor, I still have to do the rest of my Orientation, and meet my fellow coworkers.&quot;</p>
