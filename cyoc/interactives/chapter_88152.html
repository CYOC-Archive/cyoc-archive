<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shannon squealed in delight as her BFF Bella stepped out of the car and they gave each other a big hug. More of her childhood friends spilled out of the limo and she gave each one of them a hug. They had agreed to her wild idea to have a &#39;normal&#39; bachelorette party, most of them hadn&#39;t been out to the human world before. They had rented some cabins out in the woods and were going to have some &#39;girl&#39; time and were picking her up. They were loading up when a car pulled and parked next to the limo and out stepped Jay&#39;s sister Jenifer. Shannon felt her stomach sink at the sight of her, Jay and her had discussed inviting her but she was just so uptight that they decided it would be a bad idea and set the weekend when they knew she was busy.<br />
&quot;Shannon, I was able to get off work at the last minute.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, wow&quot; Shannon was trying to think fast but was unable to come up with an excuse for her not to come. &quot;Will grab your stuff and hop in.&quot;<br />
Jennifer grabbed her bag and climbed in the back with the others. Everyone was silent looking at Jennifer awkwardly before Shannon finally broke the ice.<br />
&quot;Everyone this is Jenifer, Jay&#39;s sister. She was going to have to work this weekend but she was able to get off at the last minute.&quot; Shannon went around and introduced everyone and conversation slowly resumed. Jennifer kept her answers short and didn&#39;t join in on the jokes and laughter. Shannon sat there looking at Jennifer thinking about what to do with her. Jay really did not want to have his sister to convert even though it would do wonders to remove the stick from her ass; she would have to talk with her friends to keep things &#39;boring&#39; this weekend. <br />
Jennifer sat in the limo not really wanting to be there, she just was there out of spite. Looking over at Shannon she felt a thrill of revenge as she remembered her face as she pulled up in her car. She knew as soon as they booked this party on a weekend that they knew she worked that they didn&#39;t want her here but she was able to switch with a friend. They pulled up to the resort and she almost changed her mind, it was a collection of small cabins around a main building right next to a beautiful lake. They talked about getting massages and swimming today and then having a party tonight, none of it really appealed to her but maybe kicking back would be ok. The lifeguard welcomed the group to the resort and gave them directions to the cabins. Shannon grabbed Jennifer and wanted to share one with her, which annoyed her as she thought she was just trying to suck up to her. As they walked off towards the cabins some of the girls looked back at the tan muscular life guard with lust in their eyes till they met Shannon&#39;s gaze and looked forward.<br />
	Jennifer unpacked in her room and Shannon came in and wanted to go for a massage with her. They go into a room and are greeted by two guys that have them undress and lay on the tables. Jennifer feels herself relax as one of the guys starts to knead her muscles and she rethinks coming here just out of spite. The massage finishes and they head back to the cabin to get ready for the party tonight. They arrive at the main house to cheers as the alcohol has already been flowing and drinks are put into their hands. Jennifer pretends to sip her drink feeling awkward and out of place. Music starts to play and more and more alcohol is consumed everyone becomes louder and crazier. Jennifer stands in a corner, smiles and pretends to drink and enjoy herself but looking for the first chance to get away. Someone knocks on the door and in walks a shirtless cowboy wearing chaps and a leather vest.<br />
&quot;Howdy ladies, I understand someone needs a sendoff&quot; All the ladies erupt in cheers as Shannon is pushed forward and embraced by the stripper who starts to dance with her. Jennifer rolls her eyes and trusting that everyone’s attention is elsewhere she slips out and goes back to the cabin. She listens to the noise from the main house as she crawls into bed and goes to sleep. Waking up suddenly she registers a change in the noise level and looks out to the main house and sees someone leaving followed by a crowd waving goodbye. The person passed under a light and Jennifer blinks to try and make sense of what she is seeing, he is a muscular clown cowboy with peach colored skin, green hair, clown face, a large red nose, and a cartoonish clown outfit with lasso included. Jennifer shakes her head as she sees him climb into an impossibly small car and drive off. Did they order a second clown stripper as a joke? Jennifer shrugs it off and climbs back in bed and sleep.<br />
	Waking up with a pain in her neck from the crappy bed Jennifer gets up and makes her way towards the main house for some food not really expecting anyone else up after last night’s party. Walking in she enters a disaster zone, balloon everywhere, some in very odd shapes, two cream pies splattered on the floor and confetti everywhere. The place smells strongly of tequila and a sweeter smell she can&#39;t identify. She shakes her head and hopes the person how rented this didn&#39;t want their deposit back. Grabbing some food she sits down, massaging her still sore neck, to the sound of a loud fart echoing through the room. Jumping up she looks around and spots a whoopie cushion that someone had left on the chair as a joke, rolling her eyes again she shoves it off and sits down to eat. Feeling the pain in her neck and now a tightness in her jeans she decides to go for another massage and see if that helps, might as well take advantage of all the services. Finishing she throws her bowl on to the ground adding to the mess and walks over to the massage building. Walking in she stops dead in her tracks.<br />
&quot;HA, Ha. Good morning miss, back for another massage? It will put a smile on that face.&quot; She just stares at the two guys in front of her. Both of them were made up as clowns with white around the eyes and mouth, pink skin, clown noses and colorful hair. Somebody’s idea of a joke as they were dressed in the white uniforms of the masseuses but they had cartoonish large white gloved hands with four fingers on each. This may be funny to Shannon&#39;s friend but it just creeped the hell out of her as she turned and walked out without saying a word. Was this some inside joke she wasn&#39;t in on she pondered as she walked quickly back to her cabin. Other girls were waking up now a little blurry eyed and were making their way down to the lake suits on towels in hand. Thinking that was a good alternative she changed into her suit which now was very tight in the butt and top and followed the girls down. When she arrived at the lake she waived hello at the lifeguard and looked for the other girls. Finding them on the barge in the center of the lake she shielded her eyes from the sun and squinted at them, they were laying out in odd white swim suits that covered most of their bodies. She shrugged and went the opposite way and laid out on the beach, she watched as the lifeguard turned and watched the girls on the barge with a curious look on his face before diving in and swimming out to them. Rolling her eyes, which was becoming a common occurrence, she stretched out to soak up some sun. Hearing laughter echo across the lake Jennifer looks up and sees the lifeguard sitting next to the girls talking and laughing before one of them pulls him down for a long kiss. Not wanting to see a love making session on open water she shuts her eyes and tries to think of other things and slowly drifts off.<br />
&quot;Yo, Babe.&quot; Jennifer wakes up at the sound of the lifeguard’s voice, which is slightly higher than she remembers, not wanting to wake up or open her eyes as she was enjoying her nap.<br />
&quot;You want me to apply some sunscreen on you before you burn yourself?&quot; A guy with his hands all over her creeps her out but he does have a point.<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;ll......&quot; The words freeze in her mouth as she opens her eyes and sees the lifeguard holding out a bottle of &quot;Happy Sunscreen SPF 5000&quot;. He too was now made up to look like a clown, unnaturally tan skin with white around the eyes and mouth, a red smile, colorful board shorts, curly sea blue hair and green clown nose. &#39;Ok this joke is going too far&#39; Jennifer thinks but she takes in the details of the shirtless clown, his whole body seems to be made up from his toes to his head, his green nipples hard in the breeze were small balls on his chest. This was an elaborate joke and a uneasy feeling started to develop in her stomach.<br />
&quot;Uh, no thanks I think I will go in.&quot; As she jumps up and starts to run back to the cabin. Looking out at the lake she sees that the barge had drifted closer and even at this distance she can see the girls chalk white skin was not a swimsuit and made up faces, sun bathing like nothing was wrong. The feeling in her stomach increases and she increases her speed up the path. Passing the massage build she sees two girls coming out, they two were made up as clowns. When they see here they start to laugh.<br />
&quot;(*laughter*) Oops (*laughter*)&quot; they exclaim before looking at each other and turning back to Jennifer &quot;Oh well, it looks like you need a smile on your face&quot; and start to walk towards her. Jennifer takes off running now as fast as she could.<br />
&#39;What is going on? Is everyone turning into clowns? Was it that stripper? This is impossible.&#39; Thoughts run through her mind as she races back to her cabin. &#39;Maybe Shannon still is ok&#39; Jennifer has always been very logical and uncreative and she was close to full out panicking at this series of events. None of this could be happening in her limited logical world. Busting into the cabin she calls for Shannon before running into her room and finding her groggy but still human.<br />
Standing there panting and out of breath she tries to explain &quot;Shannon...... Clowns..... Lifeguard.... Your friends....but,&quot; she finally starts to feel stupid, this must be a joke right? She hears the door open to the cabin and turns back to Shannon who sighs and gets out of bed. Relief floods through Jennifer as she sees this reaction from her. &#39;She knows this is a joke.&#39; Jennifer thinks and lets out a little laugh. Shannon friends file into the room all made up as clowns.<br />
&quot;Girls I told you to be careful and not to do this.&quot; Shannon says sternly to them. Jennifer lets out another laugh as she looks at all the girls, looking back at Shannon she stops laughing. Shannon was now made up as a clown now too.<br />
&quot;Shannon......&quot; Jennifer squeaks out <br />
&quot;Skeeter is my name.&quot; Skeeter replies. Jennifer just stands there with her mouth open not knowing what to say.<br />
&quot;We weren&#39;t going to tell you but my family is a bit different, we are clowns from Clown City&quot;<br />
Jennifer stutters &quot;But that is ridiculous there is no such thing.&quot;<br />
&quot;I asked your brother Jango to convert over and he agreed, he is a clown now too.&quot;<br />
&quot;What....&quot;<br />
&quot;We didn&#39;t want to convert your parents but, well, when my parents met them it just sort of happened.&quot;<br />
&quot;My mom and dad.....&quot;<br />
&quot;And we didn&#39;t want to ask you which is why we really didn&#39;t want you to come this weekend but then you did. And then the girls were supposed to behave themselves but you know.&quot; Jennifer at a loss for words at this statement.<br />
&quot;But I think it would be good for you to loosen up and get the stick out of your ass and relax and learn to have fun.&quot;<br />
&quot;NO, I am not going to be a clown. I am not putting makeup all over my body and parading around making an ass out of myself. You can&#39;t make me.&quot; She starts to back up but runs into the other girls who start to run their hands over her body.<br />
&quot;Oh you don&#39;t have to do that.&quot; Skeeter states and starts to move closer.<br />
Jennifer looks down at the white hands finding her tits and ass that have been growing larger since this morning and watch as they slip into her suit and start to massage her. Looking up she find Skeeter in her face, nose to clown nose before she moves forward and kisses her. She feels the clown nose brush her cheek as Skeeter’s red lips met hers, a tingle starts to form on her lips and she feels herself relax. Her suit falls away and she feels warm hands on her nipples as well as her legs being forced apart before a hand is buried in her crotch and starts to massage her clit. Skeeter forces her lips apart and a tongue enters her mouth and start to explore the inside, tingles start to spread from the hands on her body. Skeeter breaks the kiss and looks her in the eyes.<br />
&quot;You want to be a silly clown don&#39;t you? We&#39;ll have so much fun.&quot;<br />
Jennifer is lost in the bliss but her logical mind considers the issue. She always has been jealous of everyone having fun and relaxing like at the party last night and the rest of the family has done it too and she didn&#39;t want to be the odd one out. Yes, it would be the right decision she concludes as a strong jolt of pleasure races through her reinforcing the choice.<br />
&quot;Yes, please&quot; The girls squeal in delight as Jenny lies down on the bed. A smile forms her lips as they turn lilac and her smile grows larger, white blossoms on her body and spread outward, her short pixie cut grows out to pink curls that flow down her back, glittering blue eye shadow fills her eyes up to her new eyebrows and pink circles appear on her cheeks. She arches her back in a orgasm before with small pops her nose, nipples and clit expands to pink balls. The room erupts in applause and cheers and they help her off the bed. Jenny looks in the mirror at her new appearance and marvels at the feeling of silliness and freedom that course through her.<br />
She turns to the girls and announces &quot;Let&#39;s have some FUN!!&quot; Thinking about what fun things to do now she pictures the lifeguard and looking down and she decides she won&#39;t need her suit for the lake and she leads the girls out.</p>
