<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It&#39;s no big surprise that people use Animalia to reinvent themselves. One good example would be Hatsane. Everyone expected her to become a spinster and maiden aunt since high school. Hatsane could never put herself out and draw attention, not like her sister. She was always the energetic sunny one, which made her much more popular than her bookish, reserved sister. So it was little surprise that her sister was able to find a husband and start a family while Hatsane preferred quite secretary work.<br />
<br />
That wasn&#39;t to say she didn&#39;t have her fun side. As her nephew and niece grew older, Hatsane spent more time with them. She found herself liking the pop music that they introduced her to. Her nephew and niece in turn saw her as the cool aunt and tried to push her into being more outgoing, to minimal effect. As much Hatsane would like to be like that, she didn&#39;t have the inner drive for it. And as Animalia grew, her nephew and niece tried to push her into joining, though Hatsane resisted. Coming out of her shell was one thing, but changing her species was an entirely different thing. However, a tiny part inside her was warming up to the idea and it was growing day by day.<br />
<br />
When the announcement went out for the Retreat to Beat the Heat was announced, her nephew and niece were finally able to convince her to join Animalia. Hatsane wasn&#39;t sure about taking part in an orgy, but her niece (now a teenager herself) told it would be a surefire way of breaking out of her shell and she should fuck the biggest guy he could find there. Hatsane was a bit concerned about her niece&#39;s opinions on sex, but she did want to be different. Her nephew told her that she should become a super-cool animal like a shark. Hatsane balked at the thought of becoming a great white shark, but a mako shark would be better suited.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Hatsane was aware that she stood out in the crowd of people awaiting their dosage. Not that she was wearing a frumpy one-piece swimsuit while other women were wearing two-pieces, but because she didn&#39;t take it off after she got her injection. Part of it was because of shyness, but she was also a bit curious about what it would be like to grow out of her swimsuit. While not as gigantic as the great white, the mako is still a large shark, with the females typically large than the males. It certainly felt strange for Hatsane to start growing, her skin becoming covered with cobalt blue scales on her back side and white scales on the front. Before long, her swimsuit was ripping, particularly at the shoulder straps as she grew taller and her breasts filled out more. It soon gave out completely as her tail grew out.<br />
<br />
It was strange for Hatsane to watch as her fingers became webbed while her fingernails became claws. She wasn&#39;t sure why she should have claws, but her ears shrank into her head instead of becoming long and pointed as some furry art that her nephew had shown her. Her feet growing into flippers made more sense though. But things became harder to focus on as Hatsane&#39;s head began changing. Her glasses were already eschewed by her ears shrinking down to small holes, but now her nose was growing out. Hatsane soon had to grab her glasses to keep them from falling off and was surprised to see her vision was improved. Though her view most dominated by the large snout that her nose and mouth was becoming. There was a pain in her scalp as the bun she kept her hair in was growing uncomfortable tight. But then her hairtie snapped as her dorsal fin grew out of the back of her head. Finally, new slits opened in her neck as she became capable of breathing both air and saltwater.<br />
<br />
Hatsane looked around uncertainly, wondering where where she should start. Already, several people were starting the orgy. They had either just became Animalians themselves or they were changing other people as they fucked. For instance, she could see one man deep in the pussy of a snake, her tail coiled around his legs as they started merging while his upper body grew scales. Hatsane was sure there would be other mako sharks here, but she didn&#39;t need to have sex with another to achieve her second dose. Any Animalian would do and Hatsane was going to take her niece&#39;s advice to fuck the biggest guy she could find.<br />
<br />
That wasn&#39;t hard to find as she expected. There was a huge Komodo dragon with blue-green scales and white hair, already surrounded by female dragons that he clearly just converted. Hatsane hesitated upon approaching, but her Animalian libido was already awakening and she wanted to step out of her old mold. She walked over, watching him thrust into one of the dragonesses. She soon let out a satisfied hiss as her body quivered.<br />
<br />
Hatsane hesitated before her sex drive plucked her courage and made her march forward. &quot;Excuse me,&quot; she said, speaking louder than she usually did to make herself be heard. The Komodo dragons looked at her with interest. &quot;Is it possible for me to have a...turn?&quot; asked Hatsane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was in the middle of-&quot; started the male.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s ok, Aomidori,&quot; said the dragoness before pulling herself off, &quot;I just had my second orgasm and I can wait a bit longer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I kinda wanna see what your seed can do for her,&quot; said another dragoness before turning to Hatsane, &quot;You are on your first dose, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and I was looking for the biggest-&quot; Hatsane&#39;s brain stalled when she finally got a good look at Aomidori&#39;s rod. No, it was more like a scepter. If she were still human, it might have split her in half if he tried to put in her. The dragonesses giggled at Hatsane&#39;s gaping expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;d say she definitely found it,&quot; said one of the dragonesses, &quot;This your first time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; started Hatsane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you need a little help getting ready,&quot; said the dragonesses before leaning down and stroking the cleft between Hatsane&#39;s legs. Hatsane gasped before she started moaning. She played with herself a few times, but she never had anyone touch her like that. She was shocked when another dragoness started playing with her nipples. These larger breasts were much more sensitive than the small handfuls she had before. Hatsane&#39;s pleasure was peaking faster than she&#39;s ever experienced before. Almost as quickly as it started, Hatsane was climaxing into these dragonesses&#39; hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-sorry,&quot; she gasped, &quot;I&#39;ve never-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone was a beginner at some point. This is where you get experience,&quot; said the first dragoness. She nodded to Aomidori and said, &quot;She&#39;s ready for you now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aomidori approached Hatsane and carefully grasped her ass. His scepter touching her wet hole. Tilting her head up, Aomidori planted a kiss on her lips, which wasn&#39;t easy given the shape of their respective snouts. And while they were kissing, he plunged in. Hatsane&#39;s cry of surprise was muffled by Aomidori&#39;s lips, but she was soon moaning with pleasure as he began thrusting.<br />
<br />
The dragonesses watched with interest as Hatsane changed as she was fucked. She was around the same size as them and didn&#39;t grow much taller. But what did grow was considerably more muscular. Her arms and legs became toned before swelling. Her back broadened as her muscles grew. Her ass became even more supple as her gluteius bulked up while her breasts grew larger still and even more perky as her pectorals strengthened. Hatsane thrust back with growing vigor as an energy she never felt in her life filled her body. Soon the dam broke and the shark and lizard flooded each other.<br />
<br />
Hatsane moaned with pleasure before pulling herself off of Aomidori&#39;s shaft. &quot;I feel great,&quot; she said, rubbing her stomach with one hand, feeling the rippling abs that were present now.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look great,&quot; said one of the dragonesses, taking Hatsane&#39;s picture on her phone and showing it. Hatsane didn&#39;t see anything of the reserved mousy woman she had been. She was a sea mount of muscles and curves, clad in white and blue scales.<br />
<br />
Hatsane flexed her arm, marveling at how thick it was now. &quot;This is better than I imagined,&quot; she said, &quot;But what should I do now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I hear that male sharks pack twice the heat,&quot; said another dragoness.<br />
<br />
Hatsane grinned, showing her many sharp teeth. &quot;I&#39;m going to find out myself,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
After the party was over, Hatsane was quick to turn in her resignation to her old job. She had been quiet and shy for all her life, now it was time for a change in direction. Fortunately, listening to her nephew and niece&#39;s music gave her a pretty good idea of how Japanese pop music sounded these days and with a little of Animalia&#39;s help, she made the right connections to begin her career. Hatsane Mako soon became very popular, though some may say that most of her popularity was her penchant for wearing revealing swimwear that showed off her curvy, muscular body, with a gold slingkini being her signature.<br />
<br />
Still, Hatsane Mako was proving to be a very popular icon in Japan and had been on tour through most of the provinces. Eventually, she was going to do a special show in Lyre/Animalia during Spookyville. And as thrilling as her new body and career were, what really made Hatsane happy was truly being the cool aunt her nephew and niece thought she was. And she always made sure to send some gifts from her stops to her #1 fans.</p>
