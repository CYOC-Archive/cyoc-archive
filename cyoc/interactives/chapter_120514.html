<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hanging up the phone after contacting the Lawson’s and letting them know that Spencer is staying over due to the police searching for an assassin; Benton swiveled his ears as he picked up the sounds of intense rutting upstairs. Hearing Spencer’s moaning in between her growls and yowls; Benton turns to look at Amanda as she just finished contacting the Anderson’s.<br />
“That boy doesn’t waste any time,” Benton shaking his head; “first he ruts our daughter…”<br />
“Better they do that inside,” Amanda interrupting as she sits down on the sofa in their living room; “With the were-alert and a killer on the loose…”<br />
“Assassin,” Benton correcting Amanda; “and a poor one at that from what the news is relaying.”<br />
<br />
Amanda snorts as her were-panther tail twitches; adjusting her position on the sofa so as not pinch her tail, the were-panthress looks at the large flat screen t.v. An image of the town’s court house, followed by an image of Moon Lake General Hospital. While the volume was low; both Benton and Amanda were able to hear what was being said clearly. With both in their fursona’s; Benton a ten foot tall black furred were-panther. For Amanda, while not as tall as her husband when in her fursona, the red headed woman was no less imposing when in her black furred were-panthress form. At her feet, which resembled the hind legs of a panther, sat three Doberman puppies that she adopted earlier in the day, dozing after spending the evening exploring the large house while following Amanda about.<br />
<br />
“OOOOOOOOHH YEAH ERIC!”<br />
Both were-panthers swivel their ears and look up at the ceiling; both trying to peer through the various layers of plaster, drywall, ductwork and other materials separating the ground and second floor. Hearing their daughter Frieda also yowl shortly after; Benton looks back at the television. With the news channel displaying the time on their program, Benton snorts in surprise at what the time is displaying.<br />
<br />
“Thirty minutes,” Benton shaking his head.<br />
“What’s that Benton,” Amanda turning her head to look at her husband.<br />
“It took that boy thirty minutes to make Spencer orgasm,” Benton shaking his head; “and that is right after him and Frieda…” Benton struggling to speak the words, “…Rutted each other silly. No pausing between the girls.”<br />
“Jealous,” Amanda placing a paw on her husband’s furry thigh and slowly traveling her clawed finger towards Benton’s furry sheathe.<br />
“Hardly,” Benton grabbing Amanda’s paw a stopping her from reaching the prize. “Now that those three are done,” Benton letting his furry fingers interlace into Amanda’s; “we’ll have a quiet moment to ourselves before bed.”<br />
“Nothing stopping us from going to bed right now,” Amanda twitching her tail; noticing Benton’s feline member slowly peak out of its sheathe, causing her to lick her lips in carnal desire.<br />
“Well you’re in the mood,” Benton watching Amanda maneuver her paw and wrapping it around his semi-hard member and stroking it lovingly.<br />
<br />
Amanda didn’t answer; with the heady rutting smell from upstairs finally wafting downstairs and trickling into the living room, Amanda was unable to key her eyes off the prize. Getting off of the sofa; Amanda repositions herself so the were-panthress is in front of her mate. Getting down on her knees; Amanda has her wet pink nose pressing on Benton’s now hard and lightly twitching shaft. Inhaling his scent as it mixes and mingles with the intense aphrodisiac smell now permeating the entire estate; Amanda takes a quick lick with her rough feline tongue. The salty taste of Benton’s pre-cum ignites a fire inside the were-panthress. Getting up a little higher, Amanda opens up her maw and slowly envelops Benton’s shaft into her muzzle.<br />
<br />
The feeling of a tongue dancing around his shaft as it is being sucked on was amazing for Benton. The times when Amanda gave him a blow job were few and far in between. Able to count the instances on a single paw when she started a session like this; Benton just growled in pleasure as he watched Amanda bob up and down on her shaft. Placing his paws on her head so as to help guide her; Benton feels the typical pressure build with in, signaling that he is about blow his load. With his grip on Amanda’s head tightening slightly; Benton starts to subconsciously make Amanda speed up by forcing her down on his shaft.<br />
<br />
Panting as he is trying to hold back the flood gates; Benton growls as Amanda’s tongue action on his tip causes him to force her down in the entirety of his shaft. The fleshy barbs flaring as he blows his load in her muzzle; causing Amanda to slightly gag as she is forced to swallow the first few spurts of his hot seed before savoring it’s salty texture.<br />
<br />
With his eyes fluttering and his tongue lolled out; Benton was clearly enjoying the orgasmic release Amanda brought him too. So lost in the moment he didn’t hear his name being called several times until after a distinct cough brought his attention.<br />
“I apologize for interrupting yours and Mistress Amanda’s intimate moment,” Benton seeing it was his were-tiger butler George speaking; “but there is a deputy at the front door wishing to speak to you both. He says it is a matter of urgency.”<br />
“Normal or like us,” Benton growling as he clearly did not enjoy the interruption; “no matter, just pass us our robes so we can see this person off as quickly as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
The deputy was made to wait in the front entrance as he watched the overly brusque butler walk off to fetch his employers. The smells of heavy rutting invading his nostril, bely to the deputy that he came at an ill time and those he interrupted were not going to be happy to see him. That thought proved true as the deputy observed a six foot tall man stomp towards him in an overflowing red robe. His female following behind in a similar blue robe, only with a hood that allows them to conceal their face if the so wish. Fortunately the hood was down and the deputy could see the red headed woman also none to amused at him being here.<br />
“Well I clearly came at a bad time,” the deputy seeing the anger in Benton’s eyes; “but I’m here on orders from Sheriff Cooper.”<br />
“Then say what you need to say and get out,” Benton growling; “I and my wife were busy.”<br />
“I know,” the deputy sniffing the air; “were-dog by the way. But thank you for greeting me out of your fursona,” the deputy continuing; as he pulls out a picture of a greasy haired Latino.<br />
<br />
“Have either of you seen this person today,” the deputy handing Benton the photo.<br />
“No,” Benton clearly not hiding his anger; “I have not seen this person. Why are you here?”<br />
“I have,” Amanda looking at the picture. This caused Benton’s anger to change to one of curiosity as he looks at Amanda continuing to stare at the photo. “Earlier today when I was at café Luna having my usual coffee and croissant.”<br />
“You still go there,” Benton looking at his wife; “even after you got sick from their coffee.”<br />
“It wasn’t the proprietors fault that the civet coffee was tainted with hookworm eggs,” Amanda snapping back. “I saw this person,” Amanda handing back the photo to the deputy; “leering at me as I was sitting at the café’s street side patio. He quickly turned away after we locked eyes and I never saw him again. Why are you asking us about him?”<br />
“We suspect this is the person who tried to assassinate Frederick Parker,” the deputy gauging the two were-panthers; seeing if any reaction forms before continuing. ”Searching the room he rented at your motel,” the deputy continuing; “we discovered he had a laptop that had a list of names on it. Your name was on that list Benton,” the deputy being serious; “as well as your address.”<br />
<br />
The rage within Benton bubbled up with renewed vigor as he clenched his fists tightly; ready to lash out at a moment’s notice.<br />
“Who hired this man,” Benton seething at the deputy; “who would dare send this fool after me?”<br />
“That is what we are hoping you could tell us,” the deputy pulling out his note book; “if it is not too much trouble the sheriff would like to speak to you as soon as possible. Is tomorrow morning good?”<br />
“No,” Benton controlling his rage; “I have an appointment with a doctor tomorrow morning.”<br />
“If it is a quick chat,” Amanda interrupting after sensing Benton’s building anger; “the sheriff can speak to us around noon.”<br />
“Alright,” the deputy jotting down the time; “if it would be alright, I would like to search your grounds. Just in case this man is prowling about; looking for an opportunity to attack you or your family.”<br />
“Fine,” Benton quickly responding; “if it will go any faster I’ll have my butler George assist you.”<br />
“No need,” the deputy responding; “just keep your window blinds drawn. The man dropped a sniper rifle after his failed hit on Frederick parker; but that doesn’t mean he might have another one.”<br />
“My windows are polarized to prevent people from looking in,” Benton showing the deputy to the door; “even if a person presses their face to the glass, they can’t see inside.”<br />
<br />
Watching the deputy leave but not heading to his car; Benton closes the door. Re-assuming his were-panther fursona and seeing Amanda do the same as she lets her robe pool about her digitigrade paws; Benton just stares at his wife for a moment before noticing the three Doberman puppies behind her.<br />
“How soon can you get them trained to be vicious guard dogs?”<br />
“So now you are warming up to the idea of having guard dogs,” Amanda scoffing at her husband as she gathers them up into her arms. “What changed? The possibility of someone placing a hit on you perhaps?”<br />
“I consider it a slow day at work,” Benton scoffing; “if I don’t get at least a half dozen death threats over the phone or by email. A would be murderer on the loose… that is another story.”<br />
So you want to finish what we started upstairs in bed,” Amanda looking at her husband; “or are you too angry to ravage me?”<br />
“Oh I’ll ravage you,” Benton leering at his wife; his feline member becoming engorged and erect. “A good fuck is just what this were-panther needs right now.”</p>
