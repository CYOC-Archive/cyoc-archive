<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>For now, this is the last planned chapter of Mary&#39;s jungle adventure, as I have plans for other stuff. Cool that you&#39;re still here ;) and hopefully enjoying the story. It&#39;s been a bit of an experiment, I&#39;m really happy with some passages, others feel a bit clumsy. Feel free to contact me for any feedback or ideas, you&#39;ll find a way...</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The initial frustration was quickly washed away as Mary decided to make the best of the situation. After all, these were her last hours with Juan, so why not make the most of them?<br />
Juan&#39;s leg was still weak. He was not yet used to the crutch he was trying to use. Gentle as always, Mary didn&#39;t want to humiliate him, so she decided not to carry him. She simply put her left arm around him, supporting much of his weight. Slowly the couple entered the cave, Juan hopping on one leg while Mary walked elegantly beside him. Her hard form pressing tightly against him.<br />
<br />
They chatted nicely as they walked, reflecting on the events of the day. But Juan had a hard time concentrating on the conversation. He remembered the previous night when they had explored each other&#39;s bodies. He could feel his rod shifting in his pants as he recalled her fiery touch. Mary was just so beautiful and sexy, her feminine muscle tone, her firm breasts, even the fact that her natural heels raised her height a little above his own turned him on.<br />
<br />
Mary was certainly determined in her actions and could feel Juan&#39;s growing excitement. She felt an inner urge for some relief. As they entered a large chamber, Mary suddenly turned 180 degrees and stood in front of Juan, sliding her left arm further around him.She began to press him harder against her perky breasts as she wrapped the four spider legs around him, pinning him tightly. With all his strength he would not be able to break free, but why should he? Juan felt more comfortable, safe and aroused than ever before?<br />
<br />
Once she had him firmly in her grasp, Mary raised her right arm to the ceiling and shot out a thin string of silk. Like in an elevator, they were both lifted. Juan knew she could easily carry him, but instinctively wrapped his arms around her for an extra sense of safety.<br />
<br />
When they reached the ceiling, Mary leaned back, unwrapped her legs from Juan and placed them at the ceiling. She let go of the silk and crawled several feet to a nice spot on the ceiling. Juan, facing down, felt a little dizzy as he was moved horizontally by Mary, who wrapped her now free hand around him.<br />
<br />
It was a nice and comforting feeling to feel gravity pulling their weight together. With each passing second, Juan felt more and more comfortable even at such a great height, and eventually he relaxed his grip on Mary, who in response loosened her grip a little. Juan rested on her firm chest and abdomen. Mary lifted her human legs to complete the human mattress, Juan could feel her abdominal muscles contracting beneath him. With no way to slip or slide off Mary, Juan let go of her completely and began to explore her body. He slid his hands down her back, feeling her cold, hard, chitinous exoskeleton. He grabbed the two upper legs where they came out of her back. He exploratively tried to push them apart a little, but even though they were only an inch in diameter, he could not move them the slightest bit.<br />
<br />
Mary just grinned with satisfaction as Juan played with her new body. He continued to work his hands down her back until he reached her butt. He immediately started massaging her buttocks. Mary&#39;s reaction told him that she liked it and that he should continue. He felt his chest being pressed a little tighter against Mary&#39;s prominent breast as she also began to move her hands along his spine.<br />
<br />
Juan felt his pulse rise as the wound on his leg began to throb. But the painkillers and his growing arousal soon washed the pain away. Without warning, Mary leaned forward and pressed her lips to Juan&#39;s in a deep, lingering kiss. Their tongues danced together, teasing and probing until they both moaned with pleasure. Juan&#39;s hands slipped further down, exploring her thighs from behind. He seductively rubbed a hand along her exposed abs to her firm tits. Mary arched her hips into his touch, feeling the familiar heat pool deep in her belly. She felt cherished, wanted, desired.<br />
<br />
Mary felt his rising member pressing against her abs. She slowly lifted him up with one arm, Juan protesting in his arousal but he didn&#39;t stand a chance. With her free hand she sliced through his belt, trousers and shorts, exposing his rock hard cock. Mary pulled down her own panties and pushed Juan down a little. With that movement, they were both on fire. Everything was now on autopilot. The experience of having sex with him lying on top of Mary was a whole new level of pleasure. Mary also experienced the best sex of her life. Feeling so strong and in control brought pleasure beyond imagination.<br />
<br />
All the stress, pain and chaos of the previous day was soon forgotten and replaced by pure joy. It didn&#39;t take long for both to come. Juan almost fainted from the pleasure he was experiencing. They didn&#39;t exchange many words that night and he soon slipped into a restful sleep on top of Maria.<br />
<br />
Mary used her hands to weave something similar to a hammock and gently placed the sleeping Juan in it before lying down next to him. Satisfied, she allowed herself to drift off into the land of dreams.<br />
<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
The next morning, Mary awoke early, feeling that her spider-like features had receded, leaving her with a renewed sense of normalcy. She could still feel her enhanced strength and agility, but her extra limbs and chitinous armor were gone. &quot;Must be the sleep,&quot; she mused, beginning to grin, &quot;or the sex...&quot;<br />
<br />
After Juan had woken up and been cuddled a bit, Mary let them down and they walked towards the exit. A little embarrassed, Juan had to hold on to his torn panties to keep them from slipping down. Mary just giggled, being responsible for his ruined clothes.<br />
<br />
With everything settled, they finally prepared to leave the jungle. The army had arranged transport back to civilization and the helicopter was ready to take them home. Mary took a moment to say a heartfelt goodbye to Juan. Their bond had been deepened by the trials they had faced together, and it was difficult to part.<br />
<br />
Juan looked at Mary with gratitude in his eyes. &quot;You saved my life, Mary, in more ways than one. If you ever need anything, don&#39;t hesitate to find me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary smiled warmly, her heart heavy with mixed emotions. &quot;Thank you, Juan. You&#39;ve been a true friend, and I&#39;ll never forget you.&quot;<br />
<br />
With one last hug, Mary boarded the helicopter alongside her father. As they climbed into the sky, leaving the dense jungle behind, Mary couldn&#39;t help but reflect on the extraordinary journey she had been on. As they flew back to their old lives, Mary knew she was forever changed, both physically and mentally.</p>
