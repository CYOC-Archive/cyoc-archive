<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Still recovering from her masturbatory exercises, Jen's figurative eye caught sight of her hastily discarded shirt and remembered what she'd been doing before that fateful (was it perhaps too early to call it that?) phone call.<br />
<br />
She needed to get to class.<br />
<br />
She was definitely going to miss most of her first class at this rate, but she could probably get out of it. Her main problem was, as it had been earlier, getting dressed, especially now that she had to compensate for her shirts having neckholes. Wearing those now with nothing else would probably be indecent exposure. So, after much searching, Jen found not only the clothing she'd been looking for, but also an extra pair of panties that she decided to slip on like a shirt. It covered her well enough, but it was only underwear – was there anything else she could put on over it? In the end, she decided not to worry about it now.<br />
<br />
Once Jen finally made it to school, she found Kyle's declaration true – while everyone noticed that her head was gone today, nobody paid it much more attention than if she'd had a cast on her leg. Those who dared speak to her to begin with (she wasn't quite an approachable person) asked what happened, did/does it hurt, what's it like now. A few noticed the panties and queried about them; an unusually suggestive Jen told them it was private, but she could show them after school.<br />
<br />
Sometime before lunch period, though, Jen began wondering why she wasn't angrier at that Kyle dweeb for doing this to her. Sure, it was great in private, but in public, it was inelegant in many ways and a magnet for all the wrong attention. Since she had no face, people talking to her would either look at her chest, her neckhole, or sometimes not at her at all out of embarrassment.<br />
<br />
Once lunch came around, Jen pulled a few strings to find her transformer. She remembered her own powers as well as the standard Transform-or-Dare curse; she just had to figure out what to do with him.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Kyle was easily found – there was a quiet area he often stayed in with his laptop when classes were over. He glanced up from his screen at the sound of a passerby, but his eyes widened upon seeing the altered Jen. He hadn’t planned out what to do in this situation.<br />
<br />
“Come on, dork,” she said, mentally smirking as she extended her hand. Her voice came from where her mouth had been, and it was delightfully intimidating now. “I’ve got something more fun than that.”<br />
<br />
Limply, Kyle set his laptop aside and let her drag him into the nearby girls’ restroom. Nobody came in this area at this time of day, so there was little danger of his stuff getting stolen or him being discovered in the girls’ room. Though, he realized, his presence there would likely not be unwelcome for much longer.<br />
<br />
The girl led her captive into a stall and locked it. Jen began to remove her pants and both pairs of panties. “Congratulations, dillweed. You get to fuck one of the hottest girls in school. After that… we’ll see how you end up.” She nudged him toward the toilet seat. “Now let’s get going.”<br />
<br />
While there wasn’t much she could do to him on her own if he somehow didn’t orgasm, she still had the curse, which had no such limitations. Besides, Kyle was never good at dealing with these kinds of people to begin with, which is why he’d used the curse on her from a relatively safe position and hoped she wouldn’t find him for revenge. Not feeling any way out, the nerd pulled down his jeans and boxers and sat on the toilet, letting her lower parts envelop his prick.<br />
<br />
Jen was underwhelmed by the experience, even though she’d guessed she’d have to do all the work. He was inexperienced, even if he had an idea of the basic erogenous zones, and he was a slow learner from the feel of it. The pulses of pleasure were irregular and unsatisfying, and Jen was quickly getting frustrated. Grasping a breast in one hand, she began manually stimulating herself. The other was needed to steady herself as she tried to make him come.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, Kyle’s body tensed, spurting a load into his captor. Jen slowed to a stop, unfulfilled as she felt her pleasure slip away. That wouldn’t last much longer, though. “Now,” she panted, “we work with you. Maybe as a girl you’ll have a better idea of what to do with one.”<br />
<br />
Before Kyle knew what was happening, he was feeling weird all over. His body softened, much of his body hair disappeared, his hips widened, his face shifted, and his chest and crotch felt the most off. His nipples sprung to attention and grew, being pushed out by the small mounds forming there. Down below, his testicles receded into him as his sack split down the center, reshaping into labia. His dick was quickly shrinking into a clitoris, and its urethra tore away to settle just below in Kyle’s new vagina. His belly rumbled as his insides changed and arranged to accommodate Kyle’s new situation.<br />
<br />
“You’re pretty cute like this, Kyle,” Jen murmured, looking at the adorable messy-haired girl she’d formed. She wouldn’t have thought so the day before, but those clothes looked oddly charming on the boyish geek of a chick - well, her jeans and boxers were still around her ankles, but that somehow added to the charm. Shame Kyle probably wouldn’t fit in them in another minute. “Yeah, let’s keep going from here.”<br />
<br />
Kyle looked up. “Keep going?”<br />
<br />
“Of course, you silly girl. This is way too vanilla for you – and for me, really. Let me think up a more suitable body for you…”</p>
