<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I began to feel numb… well not numb, exactly, but disconnected. I looked Cooper up and down, but I didn’t see anything differently, so I shrugged and decided to head back to the living room.<br />
Except I didn’t move.<br />
I instead watched Cooper shrug and turn as he began walking toward the living room. My arms, against my will, shot out to the sides and tried to brace myself in the hallway… but I had no idea why.<br />
“Woah woah slow down!” I heard Cooper yell as he walked off. My arms dropped to my sides and I began chasing after him - again, not under my control.<br />
“The fucks going on?!” I asked, my body reaching and grabbing for Cooper on its own. I tried to fall backwards to stop the jogging, but nothing I did changed, and instead Cooper fell into me as I grabbed him.<br />
“Calm down, dude, relax, let’s go sit down, I can explain for you. I think.” I calmed down and Cooper’s breath slowed for some reason, I felt myself let go of him and he walked over to the couch to sit. Which I meant to do. Instead, I stood in front of him with my hands in my pockets.<br />
“So… I guess the best way to explain it is that I own your body, and you own mine. It’s still yours, but I own it, I control it… you get what I mean?”<br />
Cooper’s face turned to confusion. “What?” I said. “That doesn’t make sense. And aren’t you supposed to be aware? Shouldn’t you be as lost as I am?” I felt my eyebrow raise.<br />
“First,” Cooper began to explain, “I’m aware of the changes, but that doesn’t make me like you. It’s more like I know what changed but I also know what’s normal now. Like this.” I felt my arm point between the two of us, again not by my own doing. “I remember how things are with this change.”<br />
“Second, it’s like… so it’s still your body. You feel it, you have it, but when I go to do something I use your body to do it. Like if I want to dance…” My body danced on its own for a moment before stopping and turning back toward the couch. “… or take off clothes.” I felt my arms grab the front of my shirt and begin ripping it down the middle, tearing it in half until it fell to the floor, my hairy pecs and stomach exposed. <br />
“Or lift my left arm,” my left arm raised, “bury my face in my armpit,” my vision turned downwards as I felt my armpit hair on my face, “and lick it sensually,” my tongue began to push through my armpit hair, licking the sweat and skin of my armpit. I moaned, both from disgust and arousal, and reached down toward my hardening dick, only to not feel myself get touched at all, yet I continued trying, reaching under my shorts to grab my stiff rod for… yet still I felt nothing. By the time I was done licking and my face exited my pit, I saw Cooper’s right arm digging into his shorts and tugging on his hard-on like I had been trying to, and that’s when it clicked for me. This was my body, but Cooper had all the rights to it.<br />
“Only thing I can’t do is talk for you, but I can have you do some things like grunt, make faces, eat, cum, things like that. It’s kinda interesting, I have more control over your body than I did my own… and of course it’s also true for you.” Cooper was still stroking his cock, as I still was making him do, and he contorted my face into an “O” face as he was enjoying the sensations.<br />
“So what are things like here for us then?” I asked, arousal still on my face from Cooper’s whims. <br />
“Well, we’re really codependent. We’d have to be, given the circumstance. We’re a lot closer… a lot closer. We sleep together, it’s just easier that way. We do pretty much everything together, even showering, eating, getting dressed. Relationships with others are harder though. We usually fuck each other, it’s easier than participating in sex but not feeling it. Um… what else…”<br />
I was alarmed. I could see the shocked expression on Cooper’s face. My face? Cooper’s hand slowed as I became distracted.<br />
“H-hey, don’t slow down. I’m having a good time.” I refocused and continued having Cooper masturbate. That was when I realized that Cooper was having me flex for him. I guess giving himself eye candy. My left hand reached up to my chest and began squeezing my pecs, and my dick flared in response. <br />
“I also know how to get you turned on too.” I felt myself smirk unwillingly as my breathing became heavy with arousal - whether it was Cooper’s or mine was unclear to me. <br />
My mind began to fog as blood rushed from my head downstairs. “What if… I wanted… to have you suck my dick…?”<br />
Cooper chuckled. “I think you mean have you suck my dick, technically. But yeah, we’ve done that before.” I rolled my eyes, and moved Cooper’s body - the body I owned - to kneeling in front of me. I had him deftly pull his shorts down, and I felt my freed dick forward, slapping him in the face. I felt my right hand reach down and grab Cooper’s hair as I thought about placing his lips around my cock, and I felt his mouth slide down the shaft. Meanwhile, my left arm continued to play with my new, massive, hairy pecs, my fingers traveling through the forest of hair to find my nipple before giving it a rub, further engorging my dick - the dick Cooper owned - further down his throat - the throat that I owned. I made Cooper reach up and grab my ass, and felt his hands caress the thick globes of muscle that were there. I felt my pec get one last squeeze from my left hand before moving into a bicep flex, my face moving toward my flexing bicep and licking it. My right hand continued holding Cooper’s head into the blowjob - the blowjob I was giving. I wanted to cum. I needed to cum. But I couldn’t. Cooper didn’t want me to cum yet.<br />
“Cum.” I pleaded between licks of my bicep. “Cum in my mouth. Please.” I stopped licking, and felt Connor’s smug grin plaster my face. He moved his left arm - the one attached to me- down to grab my head, and used both his hands to push my head - the one attached to Cooper - until my lips reached the base. Then I finally felt release. <br />
I felt semen explode out of Cooper’s cock and into my mouth. I was lost in the throes of ecstasy. I swallowed, getting every drop of seed into my belly. I felt weak as I dropped Cooper’s hands from around my ass and into his lap. Cooper released a loud, primal growl from my chest and smiled triumphantly. As I finally felt the last of the cum escape, Cooper finally let me let go of his head and Cooper’s body - the body I controlled - slumped to the ground. Cooper had me take a step back and, looking past my pecs with damp hair clinging to them, I could see a large wet spot at Cooper’s crotch - caused by a hands-free orgasm that I must have given him while lost in the strange new encounter. <br />
“Looks like I’ll have to clean you up.” Cooper’s body said, as I unwillingly bent down and picked up the drained body off the ground and held it in a bridal carry as I walked us back to the bedroom. It was odd, feeling too tired to move yet feeling my body move anyways, feeling what was technically my body press against my pecs. <br />
Cooper had me lay the body down on the bed - our shared bed, I assumed - and walked over to a dresser where he had me pull out a pair of baggy grey sweatpants and put them on before walking me over to a new dresser that hadn’t been there moments before. He pulled out a pair of briefs and a pair of jeans and walked them over to my body.<br />
I pushed my body up, and the body on the bed responded in kind. “I can dress myself.” I said, and Cooper chuckled. “Suit yourself.” Cooper crossed my arms over my chest as I watched from 3rd person, me making Cooper’s body change out of his cum-stained shorts and into the clean briefs and jeans. Once I was done, Cooper had me walk over and wrap my arms around Cooper’s body - technically mine - in a tight hug.<br />
“Thanks. Glad to know we’re gonna be alright.” I heard Cooper say and a smile formed on my lips. <br />
<br />
I wasn’t sure if I liked this. It was strange, still feeling everything but having no control over the body I was in, instead controlling Cooper’s body through what was realistically my first gay experience. So, I decided to reply with…</p>
