<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I’d like you to become a Chevrolet Malibu in a nice blue metallic with a snake scale design,” Ben says, “I want the interior to be a combination of wood, leather and plastic. I’d love anything made of leather and wood to also have a snake scale design”.<br />
<br />
“Alright,” Jeff says, starting to set up the transformation, “I guess you’d like the license plates to also have some lizard or snake design?”<br />
<br />
Ben nods, “yup, I’d like the image of a blue python-like snake on both plates, framing the name “Fang” which should be in black bold letters”.<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “got it,” he says, the teen continues to type, after a few minutes he leans back, “alright, I think I have everything,” he says.<br />
<br />
“So, what exactly have you entered,” Ben asks.<br />
<br />
“I chose the exact model and manufacturer of your “car”, I then chose the snake scale design and color for the paintjob and interior,” Jeff says, “I set the transformation to take an hour, so keep that in mind when you need your “car”, for example, you have a date at 3pm, you’d send me a text at 1:30pm so that there is enough time for me to transform and for you to get to the destination”.<br />
<br />
Ben nods, “alright,” he says, “what else?”<br />
<br />
“I set it so my paintjob will become a body-hugging jumpsuit whenever I transform back into a human, which I can easily hide under clothes”.<br />
<br />
Ben nods, “I get it,” he says, “that’ll help to keep your decency when in public”.<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “correct”.<br />
<br />
“Cool,” Ben says.<br />
<br />
“I also included, that when you send me a text and add your current location, it will automatically be stored in the GPS, so once I’ve fully transformed, I’ll come straight to that location”.<br />
<br />
“Sweet,” Ben says.<br />
<br />
“I decided to not set a duration for the transformation,” Jeff then says, “instead, once I hit confirm, a key fob will appear, you will be able to transform me into a car and back into a human whenever you don’t need your “car”, no matter how far apart we are. I won’t be able to transform without your help, all you’ll need to do is to press twice on the Chevrolet logo on the back of the fob to activate the transformation. When I’m human and you activate the transformation, I’ll get a signal and search for a suitable place to transform into the car”.<br />
<br />
“Cool,” Ben says, “I promise to only transform you into a car when necessary, mostly on weekends when there isn’t any school”. However Ben is already thinking about leaving Jeff as a car for multiple days, or transforming him into a car to get to school, “anything else I’d need to know,” he then asks.<br />
<br />
“I think that should be all,” Jeff says, “should I have forgotten something, or if you should have any questions, you can always ask”.<br />
<br />
“Alrighty,” Ben says, “hit it!”<br />
<br />
Jeff grins, “yes, boss,” he says and confirms the input, a loud crack is heard and a key fob appears on Jeff’s desk, which Ben immediately grabs.<br />
<br />
Ben grins, “let’s head to the garage,” he says, already getting to his feet, “I want to see if this really works”.<br />
<br />
Jeff nods and gets to his feet, grinning, “can’t wait to take your “car” for a test drive, eh?”<br />
<br />
Ben grins, “hehe… you got me,” he says as they make their way into the garage, when they enter the garage, Ben gets an idea, “hey, I just need to check my messages, why don’t you get into position and start stripping?”<br />
<br />
Jeff blushes a little, “a-alright, it’ll feel weird stripping naked in front of you,” he says.<br />
<br />
Ben, who is already taking out his phone, chuckles, “well, cars don’t wear clothes,” he says, “besides, it’s not the first time I see you naked”.<br />
<br />
Unaware to Jeff, Ben had used his phone’s Bluetooth to copy the program, creating an independent app. While Jeff strips out of his clothes, Ben quickly makes some changes:<br />
<br />
1. Ben deletes the setting that the “car’s” paintjob becomes a skin tight jumpsuit when Jeff transforms back into a human, instead, whenever Jeff transforms into a car he’ll begin to strip, once having found a suitable area to transform.<br />
<br />
2. To prevent Jeff’s transformation to happen indoors and to prevent from anyone witnessing the transformation, Ben sets it so, once Jeff receives the “signal to transform”, Jeff will automatically first search for a suitable location to transform: an abandoned warehouse, hanger or any other abandoned building with a large garage, an alleyway, a forest.<br />
<br />
3. He syncs his phone with Jeff’s brain, which will become the “car’s” computer, and when Ben sends a text like “pick me up at 100th Pine Street”, that location will be “stored” in the “car’s” GPS and also would trigger the transformation, should Jeff be a human, once Jeff is transformed into the car, “it” will immediately drive to the location Ben had sent him. And when Jeff is already the “car”, and is parked not near the location of Ben, the “car” will drive automatically to that location. Anyone witnessing this will simply assume that the car is controlled by an AI, since there are already a few vehicles out there which can be controlled remotely.<br />
<br />
Satisfied for now, Ben confirms the changes he had made, just as Jeff finishes stripping.<br />
<br />
“I’m already, Ben,” Jeff says, “you can start the process!”<br />
<br />
“Alright,” Ben says, holding up the fob and pressing down twice on the emblem.<br />
<br />
Once Ben had pushed twice on the emblem on the fob, Jeff feels a tingling run through his body, shortly after he begins to slowly lower himself to the ground. Jeff clenches his hands to fists, as he places them on the ground, his arms and legs spread slightly in a “V” shape, as his hands and feet seem to swell and turn black.<br />
<br />
Ben crouches down to get a better look and smiles, “looks like your tires are forming,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it feels so weird,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
“I can only imagine,” Ben replies.<br />
<br />
“You better step back, bro,” Jeff then says as he feels his body begin to widen and grow, “I don’t want to crush you!”<br />
<br />
“Oh… right,” Ben says, straightening up and stepping away, watching in amazement as his twin brother continues to become a car.<br />
<br />
As Jeff’s body begins to widen, grow and lengthen, his arms and legs shorten, causing Jeff to slowly lower to the floor, as his arms and legs become the hydraulics and shock absorber. Jeff’s skin takes on a metallic appearance as his skin color begins to take on the car’s paintjob and snake scale design. Doors and tainted windows, except for the windows on the driver’s and passenger’s side, allowing Ben to witness the creation of the interior.<br />
<br />
“Okay, that’s creepy,” Ben says as he watches the steering wheel, front and back seats, dashboard and other “parts” form and take shape.<br />
<br />
Jeff is unable to respond as his mouth is forced into a toothy grin, his mouth becoming the grill of the car. The teen’s eyes merge together, becoming the windshield, his ears become the mirrors and his butt merges, becoming the hood.<br />
<br />
Ben continues to watch in amazement as front and rear lights appear, and in just a few moments, Jeff is gone and in his place stands a brand new manufactured Chevrolet Malibu. Jeff’s brother lets out a whistle as he walks around the “car”, before opening the driver’s side door and grinning as he sees the interior in snake scale design, just as he wanted it, before climbing in and closing the door, running his hand across the steering wheel. Ben turns on the radio, “yo, Jeff, can you hear me?”<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah, I can hear you,” Jeff’s voice is heard coming from the speakers.<br />
<br />
Ben smiles, “how are you feeling,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“It’s weird having someone sitting inside of me,” Jeff replies, “but it’s not unpleasant. Though it will take time to get used to being unable to move on my own, except when you “call” me”.<br />
<br />
Ben chuckles, “you’ll get used to it, bro,” he says, “I must say, you make one hell of a car!”<br />
<br />
“I’m glad you like it… I mean… me,” Jeff chuckles.<br />
<br />
Ben chuckles himself, “I LOVE it,” he says, “hehe… I’ll be turning so many heads, and I have no doubt in my mind, that I’ll soon catch the attention of a hot chick!”<br />
<br />
“Just don’t “mess around” inside of me!”<br />
<br />
Ben grins, “no promises,” he says, “are you able to talk on every radio station?”<br />
<br />
“No, I’m only able to talk if the radio is set on 0.00,” Jeff says, “and since no one usually sets a radio to that station, I thought it would be the perfect station for me to be able to talk when needed”.<br />
<br />
Ben grins, “so, whenever I have the radio set to a normal radio station, you’ll be unable to make a sound?”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Jeff says, “also when you insert a CD or attach your phone to listen to your playlists, I’ll be unable to talk”.<br />
<br />
“Cool,” Ben says, he then notices a blue button near the shifter, “what’s the blue button for?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, that’s to remotely open and close the garage doors,” Jeff replies, “go ahead and try it”.<br />
<br />
Ben presses down on the button and grins when the garage doors open, “awesome,” he says, “that’s really useful”.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Jeff says, “you won’t have to get out of the “car” and punch in the code to open the garage doors”.<br />
<br />
Ben smiles, “are you also able to activate and deactivate our house’s security system, you know the alarm and surveillance cameras?”<br />
<br />
“Yup, for example, after driving out of the garage, first you press the blue button to shut the garage, then you press down on the red button to activate the house’s security,” Jeff says, “to deactivate the house’s security, you press down on the green button”.<br />
<br />
“Cool,” Ben says, “I assume you created the three buttons from the codes of the garage and security system?”<br />
<br />
“Correct,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
“Sweet,” Ben says, “but don’t you think that’s a little bit risky?”<br />
<br />
“Nah, no one else will drive me other than you,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
“What if I decide to “lend” you to a friend,” Ben asks.<br />
<br />
“You shouldn’t,” Jeff says, “but if you should, just don’t tell them about the buttons”.<br />
<br />
“Alright,” Ben says, “how about you create a secret compartment only I know about?”<br />
<br />
“You mean like some kind of “James Bond” car?”<br />
<br />
“Yup,” Ben says.<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckles, “sure, since I am linked with the Chronivac, I am able to tap in and make a small adjustment, just give me a second”.<br />
<br />
Ben watches as the three buttons seem to lower themselves into the wooden shifter panel into a hidden compartment, and a piece of wood in the same color as the rest of the panel slides over the opening. The teen smiles, “yeah, much better,” he says, “so, how do I get to the buttons?”<br />
<br />
“Just press down on the emblem on the steering wheel and the hidden compartment will open,” Jeff explains.<br />
<br />
Ben tries it out and smiles when the buttons seem to melt through the wooden panel of the shifter, and by pressing the emblem once again, the buttons sink back down into the hidden compartment.<br />
<br />
“Happy,” Jeff asks.<br />
<br />
“Yup,” Ben says, “I think I’m ready to take you on a test drive,” he then says, fastening the seatbelt and starting up the car, his smile widening at the sound of the engine, “damn, bro! You sound really powerful!”<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckles, “well, I’m a powerful model of car,” he says.<br />
<br />
Ben slowly rolls out of the garage and down the driveway, he then presses the emblem on the steering wheel and the buttons appear, he then presses the blue button to close the garage doors and once they are closed he presses the red button to activate the security system of the house, and with one more press on the steering wheel’s emblem, the buttons sink back into the shifter panel, before starting to drive down the street.<br />
<br />
 After driving for a while, Ben says, “I must say, Jeff, you are pretty comfortable to drive. I barely feel you jump when I drive you over uneven parts of the road, your engine is also pretty silent and I feel completely safe”.<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckles, “I’m glad to hear that,” he says over the speakers, “I must say, you are really an amazing driver. You are driving carefully and following the speed signs, I really was worried that you’d be speeding to show off your new car”.<br />
<br />
Ben chuckles, “I don’t need to speed, bro,” he says, “you make everyone turn their heads just of your paintjob”.<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckles, “well, you’ve chosen an amazing paintjob design,” he says.<br />
<br />
“It looks amazing, Jeff,” Ben says, “almost 3D and it even looks like real scales instead of metal”.<br />
<br />
“Hehe, I’m glad you like it,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
“By the way, what happens when I lock the car, you,” Ben asks.<br />
<br />
“I’ll enter a sleep-mode,” Jeff replies, “meaning I’ll fall asleep, when you unlock me, I’ll begin to wake up, but will still be pretty groggy and when you start up the engine I’ll immediately be fully awake”.<br />
<br />
“Alright,” Ben says, “I’ve been driving for an hour, and I must say I am really pleased with how you perform, so I’d suggest we’ll drive home”.<br />
<br />
“Sounds good, but you should fill up my tank, I’m almost empty,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I noticed,” Ben says, “I’ll fill you up once I find a petrol station. By the way, how will petrol taste to you?”<br />
<br />
“Like soda,” Jeff chuckles.<br />
<br />
Ben chuckles himself, “alright,” he says, and once he had filled up the tank, he drives home, opening the garage with the blue button after deactivating the security system of the house.<br />
<br />
After parking the car and turning off the engine, Ben says, “I’ll keep you a car for the rest of the weekend and transform you back on Sunday, before mom and dad return”.<br />
<br />
“That’s fine with me,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
Ben smiles, “thanks for doing this for me, Jeff,” he says.<br />
<br />
“No problem, bro,” Jeff replies, “just don’t forget to transform me back on Sunday”.<br />
<br />
“I won’t forget,” Ben says, he then turns off the radio and steps out of the “car”, closing the door, then using the fob, he locks it, sending Jeff into sleep-mode and activating the car’s alarm. Ben smiles at his “car”, “hehe… maybe I’ll keep him as a car for a while,” Ben mumbles to himself as he walks into the house, “as a car, he has no track of time, so he’ll have no idea what day it is. When our parents should ask where he is, I’ll just tell them he’s spending some time at his girlfriend’s, and I’ll use the app on mom and dad to make them think that I have won the car in some contest”.</p>
