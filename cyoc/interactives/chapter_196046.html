<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">William sat staring at his computer screen, staring at the blank white expanse of his unwritten assignment. First creative writing assignment of the year and he had fucking writer&#39;s block. He tapped a hoofed finger on his desktop, chin propped in the other hand as he stared. It didn&#39;t help that he had to figure typing out again with less fingers. Instinct or memories hadn&#39;t taken over there yet. He kept hitting extra keys and grunting in annoyance. <br />
<br />
Guy was still passed out on his bed, purring loud enough to wake the dead. He must be having a nice dream, William of course hoped it was about him. He wanted to climb into that bed and into the lynx&#39;s arms, but he couldn&#39;t spend all his time there, not and still pass his classes. He had a future now, and he had to pass these things. It didn&#39;t help that the feline slept on top of the sheets completely naked, and whatever dream he was having he was obviously enjoying, his cock free of his sheath and laying on his stomach.<br />
<br />
His eyes flicked back to the screen, then to something sitting next to his computer. He furrowed his brows at the picture frame. Where had that come from? He reached out to pick it up, bringing it closer. As soon as he made out the picture the memory came back to him. Sitting on the couch next to Milo, they must have been 11 and 9, Milo still had his baby stripes though William&#39;s had started fading. Milo held a newborn fox kit in his arms, beaming proudly. Their sister the day she had come home from the hospital. He was so happy to get to be a big brother.<br />
<br />
He ran a finger along the frame, the memories were coming more and more lately. He could remember Milo getting his first camera one Christmas, he had gotten a bike himself that year.  Was it to early to write a Christmas story? Maybe something about reindeer?  Was that silly?<br />
<br />
&quot;Something wrong, Will?&quot; He looked up, he hadn&#39;t heard Guy waking up but the lynx was looking at him with those golden eyes of his. Concerned. He suddenly realized how he must look, sitting there staring at a photo. He sniffed and wiped his eyes. When had he started crying?<br />
<br />
&quot;No, nothing&#39;s wrong. Just thinking about this assignment.&quot; Guy looked skeptical and slid out of bedm walking over to lean over William&#39;s shoulder and look at the screen then down to the picture.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right..&quot; The lynx said, sounding just a little skeptical.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just some writer&#39;s block. I think I have an idea.&quot; William scratched at the fur growingin on his face. Other than his cock, part of his head was the only human left on him. The former part seemed to surprise Guy. Stranger, his headfur had come in long enough he had to pull it back into a short tail, and while he may not have gained Milo&#39;s bulk, his stockier build did leave him bigger than Guy now.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what you need?&quot; Guy said, his accent soft and he muttered into Will&#39;s ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going to say sex, aren&#39;t you?&quot; William  chuckled. The Lynx was insatiable and really did take every opportunity he could to wrangle William into his bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want, but I was going to suggest the next best thing. Pancakes.&quot; Despite saying he didn&#39;t want sex at the moment, he nibbled a little on William&#39;s ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;The cafeteria closed an hour ago, you slept through breakfast, as usual.&quot; William leaned into that soft silvery fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll go to the diner in town. I&#39;ll get dressed.&quot;<br />
<br />
------------------------<br />
<br />
Forty minutes later the pair of them were sliding into a booth. The place was pretty crowded due to it being a Saturday, a mix of locals and college students with a little extra spending money. They were already tucking away into some coffee as they waited for their breakfasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, my family is going to come visit in a week or two.&quot; William began, looking over to Guy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve heard the first meeting can be a little emotional, just be ready, chou.&quot; The lynx watched him over the rim of the coffee mug, as if expecting more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I told them about you, just a bit, and hey invited you out to dinner with us. Don&#39;t worry, mom and my sis are carnivores, so I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll pick a place with some good options for you.&quot; William added in quickly, grinning across the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moufette morne invited too? And are we at the meet the parents stage?&quot; Guy set down his mug, not looking upset, but maybe a little hard to read. William bit his lip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, the moody skunk is invited, too. My brother likes him, and I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll settle down. As for meetint he parents, I like you, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll like you, and you get a free meal out of the deal. But..&quot; William reached across the table and took Guy&#39;s paw in hoof, giving it a sqeeze. &quot;I&#39;mnot going to use the L word yet, but I can see myself with you for a long time, Guy. And that&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve been able to say that in a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want me there, I&#39;ll be there. I&#39;ll even wear a vest.&quot; Guy said, a smile forming on his muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be still my heart.&quot; William joked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guy!&quot; The suden voice was soft but deep, and a little excited. William turned to see the slimmest bear he had ever seen. Not that the guy was thin, he was all muscle, and tall, he was just thin for a bear. A squirrel stood nearby grinning at the pair of them, then at William, at which point he blinked. &quot;No way, thought you were someone else. Two new boars on campus, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The other one was bigger, Keith.&quot; The squirrel chimed in. &quot;He found himself a new workout buddy this morning, thank god, he can let me go back to sleeping to a normal hour.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Keith, Terry.&quot; Guy&#39;s voice sounded a bit more friendly on the first name than the second. &quot;This is William, he just transferred in this year.&quot;<br />
<br />
William grinned at the pair. &quot;You must have met Milo, he&#39;s my brother.&quot; He grinned at that, he really did like having family about, and it ws weird how proud he felt over his little brother.<br />
<br />
Keith grinned. &quot;That&#39;s awesome. So are you two.. oof.&quot; He grunted as the squirrel jabbed him in the side, playfully but enough to elicit a grunt from the bear.<br />
<br />
&quot;What does it look like? Of course they are, and you&#39;re interrupting. Now come on. You made me go to the gym, and you promised me a day out on the town. I want to hit the boutique before it gets too busy. Have fun, you two.&quot; Terry flicked his tail and sauntered off.<br />
<br />
Keith just shot them an apologetic grin. &quot;Sorry, he&#39;s in a mood because I woke him up early. I&#39;ll catch you guys later.&quot; The bear lumbered after the squirrel, catching up and putting his arm around the smaller anthro&#39;s shoulders.<br />
<br />
William just stared after them, until Guy spoke up. &quot;Do they remind you at all of..?&quot; He kind of trailed off, looking back to meet William&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, he&#39;s not that demanding. I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm..&quot; Guy just shook his head, not sounding convinced. &quot;Bookstore after this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, homework after this. I know you have a paper you need to write.&quot; William squeezed Guy&#39;s paw, we can find a place outside to work and suffer together.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess. Deal.&quot;</p>
