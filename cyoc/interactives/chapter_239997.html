<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Zack sprinted toward the school, his focus locked on Blake walking up to *his body*—his mom and them just making out only after like two words,  he felt a surge of desperation. *No more! This ends now!* Without hesitation, he tapped into that strange power, willing himself forward, jumping and going head ferst into his body surprising just well being absorbed in with no one knowing seeing with pushing that tingling sensation outward with everything he had. He didn’t even know what he was doing, only that he had to get back into his body. He felt the now-familiar falling sensation, like diving into a deep pool, and when he blinked again—<br />
<br />
He was back feeling a lump being shot out of his back what was his mom in Molly&#39;s small body.  <br />
<br />
Zack felt the strength and familiarity of his own body return, the lean muscles, the height, the control. But then he noticed something else. His lips. His lips were *still pressed against Blake’s*.<br />
<br />
Blake hadn’t even noticed the change. Zack froze for a moment, utterly panicked, his heart pounding as he processed the situation. The kiss was... actually kind of nice? Warm, soft, and oddly comforting. A small part of Zack didn’t hate it, he even could like this, but this wasn’t the time to dwell on that. He quickly pushed Blake away, his face turning bright red.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa... Zack,&quot; Blake said, blinking at him. His voice was soft and full of surprise. &quot;That was... I mean, wow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack stammered, his brain scrambling for words. &quot;Uh—yeah, sorry about that. I—I need to go. Right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
He glanced around, and his stomach sank further when he saw *Molly’s body*—or rather, his mom in Molly’s body—standing awkwardly nearby, looking completely disoriented... and *completely naked* with it seems when you jump into people your cloths do not go with you. Her tiny hands were attempting (and failing) to cover her small chest and lower half as she stared down at herself in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, god&quot; Zack muttered under his breath, rushing over to her and scooping up Molly’s discarded clothes from the ground. Blake was still standing there, clearly trying to figure out what was happening, his brow furrowed in confusion.<br />
<br />
Zack whirled on him. &quot;Uh, Blake! I’m so sorry, but, uh, my *sister*—&quot; he motioned to Molly’s small, naked form— &quot;she followed me here, and I need to, um, take her back to her school before anyone sees her like this. I’ll explain later, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your sister?&quot; Blake said, his confusion only deepening as he glanced between Zack and Molly’s body. &quot;What the hell is she doing here naked?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She’s just... weird and annoying like that,&quot; Zack said quickly, forcing a nervous laugh. &quot;You know how kids are.&quot; <br />
<br />
Before Blake could ask any more questions, Zack grabbed Molly’s wrist and shoved her clothes into her arms. whispering &quot;Mom, put these on! People are going to see you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Maddie, still adjusting to the shock of being in Molly’s small body, stared at Zack with wide eyes. &quot;Zack... Molly? What’s going on? Why am I in—?&quot; She glanced down at her tiny, preteen frame, then back up at Zack, her face pale. &quot;Why am I in Molly’s... your body? What did you do?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just get dressed!&quot; Zack hissed, his voice low and urgent. <br />
<br />
Realizing the attention she was drawing, Maddie quickly obeyed, fumbling to pull on Molly’s panties and jeans with her small, clumsy hands. The childish clothes barely felt like clothes to her—they were tight and awkward, and the fact that she now had to wear *her daughter’s* glittery pink sneakers made her want to scream. But she wasn’t about to argue, not when she was *completely exposed* in front of so many people. <br />
<br />
Once Maddie was fully dressed, Zack grabbed her arm and dragged her away from the school entrance, out of sight of Blake and any other curious eyes. Maddie stumbled after him, still trying to process what had just happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zack! Stop pulling me! What is going on?&quot; Maddie demanded, her high-pitched, bratty voice making her sound more like Molly than she intended. &quot;Why am I in this body? And why do you—?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack finally stopped, spinning around to face her. His expression was firm, his voice sharp. &quot;Because *you wouldn’t stop messing with mine!* I had to do something, Mom. You’ve been in my body for the past week, running my life like it’s some kind of game! I just wanted my body back, and now I have it. So you’re stuck in Molly’s body, okay? At least for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maddie’s jaw dropped knowing now at lest that s Zack in his own body. &quot;You did this to me?&quot; she asked, her voice filled with disbelief. &quot;You *swapped me out with Mollys* on purpose?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I did!&quot; Zack snapped. &quot;And honestly, after everything you’ve put me through, you *deserve* it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maddie stared at him, her tiny hands clenched into fists. &quot;Zack, you can’t just leave me like this! I’m your mother! I can’t stay in Molly’s body—this is wrong and... i don&#39;t like it, And what about Molly? Where is she?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack smirked, feeling a small sense of satisfaction. &quot;Molly’s back home, in your body. She’s probably loving it, too. So maybe now you’ll understand what it feels like to have your body hijacked by someone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maddie’s face flushed with anger, and she pointed a tiny, accusing finger at him. &quot;Zack, this isn’t funny! You need to fix this right now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not happening,&quot; Zack said, crossing his arms and smiling. &quot;You’re always telling me I need to take responsibility for my actions. Well, now it’s your turn, *Mom.* You’re gonna stay in Molly’s body, and you’re going to school. Maybe then you’ll realize how annoying it is when someone else takes over your life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maddie’s eyes widened. &quot;You’re sending me to middle school?! Zack, you can’t be serious!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I’m dead serious,&quot; Zack said with a grin. He turned and started dragging her toward the direction of Molly’s middle school, ignoring her protests.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zack! Stop this right now! I’ll—&quot; Maddie tried to focus her power, attempting to jump back into Zack’s body. But nothing happened. Instead, she stumbled forward and accidentally headbutted him in the chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow!&quot; Zack winced, rubbing the spot where her small forehead had hit him. &quot;Yeah, good luck with that, *Mom.* I told you—I’m in control now. You can’t jump into me anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maddie glared up at him, her tiny face scrunched in frustration. &quot;Zack, this isn’t over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I know,&quot; Zack said, smirking as he turned her toward the school gates. &quot;But for now, you’re going to play nice, *Sis.* I’ll see you here after school.&quot; He poshed her into the building already seeing Molly&#39;s friends starting to walk towards her, so he gave her a cheeky wave and walked off, feeling lighter than he had in weeks.<br />
<br />
For the first time in what felt like forever, Zack was back in his own body. And for the first time, *he* was the one calling the shots.</p>
