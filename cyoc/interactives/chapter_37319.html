<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Samantha told me pull up my underwear and tights and I happily complied; my mind slipping and something inside telling me, &quot;Mommy says that it is not dignified for a little girl to be running around like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
I started to pull up the tights and underwear, but a pressure on my bladder made me stop. Looking at Samantha, my mind slipping back and forth, I whined in a girl's voice, &quot;I half to pee.&quot; and told her in my normal voice, &quot;But I don't know how. Having the same privates as my sister is new to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The babysitter took me by the hand and led me to the bathroom. Pulling down the tights and underwear, she set me on the toilet and explained in a calm and gentle voice on how I should use the toilet as a girl. Feeling the urine leave my body through a new area was certainly odd and after I was done, I found that it was really hard for me to regain control of my mind.<br />
<br />
But something inside of me didn't want to regain control and so I simply let it all slip away. For the rest of the time Samantha was there, I played and acted like a girl with Katherine, who seemed happy about this. I even stayed dressed in the ballerina outfit as I ate supper, something that should have bothered me, but didn't.<br />
<br />
When mommy got home, it must have slipped Samantha's mind, because she didn't say anything about my new transformation. Instead she collected her pay, bid mommy a good evening and left. Deciding I should do it, fighting the mind slip, I started to walk to the kitchen were mother was going through the mail. I had just reached the living room, when mommy called out, &quot;Get your coats girls, we're going for ice cream and a movie. Plus I have a surprise for the both of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
My mind slipped and I screamed out in a girlish squeal, &quot;Yay!&quot; and went running back to my room, where I pulled off the ballerina costume and put on the shorts and shirt I'd worn earlier over my swimsuit.<br />
<br />
Ice cream and then mommy took us to a movie about a princess. But that wasn't the surprise. Sitting in my booster seat next to Katherine, mommy told us on the way to the movies, &quot;I've signed you both up for ballet classes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katherine and I both squealed in delight to this and the three of us talked about it until we reached the theatre. After the movie, I felt really sleepy and as mommy buckled me and my sister into our booster seats, she commented, &quot;My princess and ballerina are tucked out. It's been a busy day for my busy girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
At home, mommy woke me up and carried me into the house and into Katherine's bedroom. Something about this bothered me, but I was too tired to complain. And I was way too tired to say anything as mommy helped me into a pull-up and then into some pink footed pajama bottom and after that a pink shirt with a picture of Angelina Ballerina on the front with the words 'Ballet time' printed on it.<br />
<br />
Laying me down in my bed, she tucked the Hello Kitty sheets and comforter around me and as I snuggled closer to Angelina, she kissed me goodnight. I was asleep before she even left the room to go and get Katherine.<br />
<br />
I awoke with a start and looked around the room, my mind stuck somewhere between the girl I was becoming and the boy I'd been. The first thing I noted was that it was a shared bedroom between two girls. One side was Disney and princess and the other was Hello Kitty and Angelina Ballerina. Fighting how my mind wanted to slip, I lay on my stomach and slid out of bed.<br />
<br />
Seeing the vanity I now had, my attention was distracted to my full body mirror. Looking in it, I saw that I'd changed even more. My hair was longer and had started to take on a red tint, while my eyes had shifted from a hazel to a bluish grey. My face looked younger, almost babyish with the right hints of feminine in it. Somewhat bothered, I opened my closet and stopped when I saw the height ruler with the Hello Kitty theme on it. It now read 'Ashley, age five' and showed my height at three foot four. Next to it and just a little below it, I read 'Katherine, age four' and showed her height at three foot two.<br />
<br />
Bothered by all this, I stepped into the closet, which had been dived into two. Ignoring my sister's side, I focused on my side instead. The cubbyholes were all properly labeled now and hanging next to that were bunch of dresses. Fighting the mind slip, I saw that what was in the cubbyholes, clothes and costume wise, and the dresses hanging up were all suitable for a three year old girl.<br />
<br />
My mind slipped when I saw the Hello Kitty DvD collection piled in one of the cubbyholes and something me wanted to put one and watch it. Shaking my head, I told myself, “Knock it off!” <br />
<br />
Stepping out of the closet, sitting at my vanity, I asked myself, &quot;Is this what I'm too become, a three year old girl? If so, I need to find the amulet to change back. But how? Seeing as I don't have any of my clothes left, it's going to be difficult.&quot; At which point, I opened the drawers on the vanity and began to look through them.<br />
<br />
Before I could get far, the smell of French Toast and bacon drew my attention and as my mind tossed back and forth between Marcus and Ashley, I picked up Angelina and skipped to the kitchen; not paying any attention to what I was doing or what I was carrying.<br />
<br />
In the kitchen I saw mommy preparing breakfast and as she put another piece of bread in the skillet, I asked her, &quot;Mommy, can I invite Thomas over today?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mommy stopped and looked at me strangely. Setting down the spatula, she squatted down in front of me and in a motherly tone asked, &quot;Your mentor? Honey, you know that he comes over only on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Ashley, sweetie, what day is it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I paused, my mind slipped and I squirmed around. If I could have seen myself, I'd thought I looked like my sister whenever she was asked a tough question. Finally in a girl's voice, I told her, &quot;Fwiday.&quot; For some reason I found it difficult to pronounce the letter R. Bothered by this, I tried to get my old mind back, but was easily distracted when my mommy said something.<br />
<br />
Tuning her back in, I heard say, &quot;Been over this several times now sweetie. Monday and Wednesday is ballet class and Tuesday and Thursday is your mentor.&quot; Something in what she said rang true and I allowed myself to be led to the table, were mommy sat me in front of a plate.<br />
<br />
Suddenly my old self was back and looking at the doll I was hugging protectively, I thought to myself, &quot;What the hell just happened?&quot;</p>
