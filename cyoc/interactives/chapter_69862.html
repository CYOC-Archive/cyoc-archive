<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Will sat for a moment, unable to move completely. The doorbell rang and she resigned herself to answering it, but propping herself up on the bed for brief support she gazed at her new form in the mirror and sighed at the naked feminine beauty before her. Horridly she threw on the clothes she’d arrived home in, as the doorbell rang repeatedly, almost desperately.<br />
<br />
She jogged down the stairs to the front door, taking a moment to check herself once over. She could only guess that whoever it was were expecting her in female form, so with what little acting talent she had, she’d have to play like she was fine and not completely freaked from not having a penis, and recovering from a female orgasm mere moments ago. <br />
<br />
She peered through the door and saw a girl, not one she immediately recognised. Short, tom-boy hair, short stature and a dishevelled appearance.  “Will!? Will! Are you in there? Its Sam, I need help.” SAM! Of course it was. Despite the girlish appearance it now seemed blindingly obvious who it was. Will quickly threw open the door and gestured for her to come in. Sam stood dumbfounded for a moment at the girl before her. “Will?” She asked unsure of herself.<br />
<br />
“Of course it is you moron!” Will snapped back, still unused to her own voice. “Get in here quick!” Sam stepped inside and Will slammed the door behind her, bolting it shut. “What the hell happened to us!?” She asked as Sam sat on the sofa.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know. It must have been those lesbians!” Sam replied now staring at her own hands. “What did they do? I don’t want to be girl.”<br />
<br />
“Calm down. Let’s think calmly for a second.” Will sat down opposite her and put her hands to her head in thought. “We’ve got to figure a way to turn back.”<br />
<br />
“My Mom recognised me as a girl.” Sam said causing Will to look up at her. “I went home and she didn’t notice anything was wrong. And my room Will! My room is all changed.”<br />
<br />
Will almost chuckled. “You’re room too?” The thoughts of the boy band posters and the completely different layout flashed through her mind, along with the now slightly damp patch on the carpet. She quickly discarded the thought, there was no time for that now.<br />
<br />
Sam looked like she was about to cry. Instinctively Will got up and sat next to her, putting an arm on her shoulder. “Hey, it’s not that bad,” She comforted as Sam began to sob. “We’ll change back, no problem. We just have to find those girls.”<br />
<br />
“And what do we do when we find them?!” Sam snapped back. “What if they turn us into newts or something? I don’t think I can deal with this.” Sam now started to cry uncontrollably and had Will still been a guy, he’d have probably thought she was quite cute.<br />
<br />
“Hey look, there not going to do anything, they’ll see reason. At least for now things can’t get any worse.” Sam fought the sobs back and looked at Will with a look that just said ‘your wrong’. Will paused before asking “What?”<br />
<br />
Sam took a deep breath and leant forward. Stopping to make sure no one was listening she whispered. “I have to pee.”<br />
<br />
Will’s face turned bright red to match the sofa they were sitting on. She hadn’t thought of it, but it was going to be completely different.<br />
<br />
“Have you…” She began but stopped, embarrassed by her own question. Sam looked at her, waiting for her to finish and Will took a deep breath and sighed, “Have you seen yourself naked yet?” Sam looked horrified at the thought and vigorously shook her head in response. Will stood up and grabbed her hand. “Come with me.”<br />
<br />
She led her into the downstairs bathroom, which thankfully had a large mirror in it. Shutting the door she turned to Sam and stared at her for a moment. Will was always the leader of the group, but she was more used to teasing Sam and the others than helping them. Clearly the hormones were working over drive for both of them. She slowly pulled her top over her head and threw it to one side to let her breast free in the air. They bounced a bit but settled down and Sam could only stare, not sure what was going on. Another quick action and the tight Jeans dropped to the floor leaving Will standing completely naked in front of her.<br />
<br />
“You see this?” She said cupping her breasts. “This is what we have to live with for the time being?” She said angrily and moved over to Sam. “Take yours off.” Sam didn’t want to and fought Will but with a struggle and effort, the slightly ripped skater shirt was soon discarded and Sam’s B-Cup tits felt the cool air on them for the first time. Sam squealed and made to cover herself, but felt the shock of cupping her breasts with her cold hands. Will took the opportunity to dive for Sam’s pants. She needed to see this, she needed to know what her body was now. The pants hit the floor and Will stood up and pointed Sam at the mirror. “This is what we are now. We’re girls!” She shouted. Sam’s eyes widened as he examined the naked bodies of the two girls in the mirror. She moved her arms back up to her breasts and cupped them lightly, the slowly, stroked her hand down her midsection until she reached the light, neatly shaven, dark hairs of her pubic region. Will saw her hesitantly pause and she moved forward to reach around Sam. She grabbed her hand and forced it downwards to meet her new feminine folds, but forgetting she had breasts now, pushed them up against Sam’s back. The feeling of cold skin against them made her shiver a bit and Sam, shocked by the new sensations pushed her ass back against Will’s crotch. This was getting too weird.<br />
<br />
“I…” Sam began as she looked at her new pussy. She turned towards Will and their eyes caught briefly for a moment. “I…Still need to pee.”<br />
<br />
Will and Sam both slowly turned to the toilet and held their breath. This was going to be weird. “I should go.” Will said hurriedly turning towards the door and making for her clothes. Sam grabbed her hand. The look on her face said it all. She was scared, and as weird as it was, she wanted Will there.<br />
<br />
Will wanted to go. She had no interest in seeing her friend relieve herself but she knew what she was going through, and however kinky this may appear, they were both just as scared as each other.<br />
<br />
Sam walked slowly over to the toilet and turning for one last reassuring look from Will, sat down. It was cold, but that was nothing new. She looked down at herself, tense. “I… I don’t….” she began but felt a hand on her shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Just relax.” Will said. She didn’t know what else to say. What could she say. Sam closed her eyes, took a deep breath, lent back and let her body go limp. That did it, and Sam felt the fluid slowly begin to seep from her. A stream poured out of her new pussy and she was mesmerized by both the site and the peculiar experience. The feeling was so alien to her and she sat and let the new sensation wash over her. It wasn’t long before it was over however and Will breathed with relief. She didn’t know why it was such a scary moment for her. It wasn’t like Sam was going to explode or something, but getting it over with was certainly nice. Sam looked up at her and began to rise from the seat with a smile.<br />
<br />
“No.” Will started. Sam looked momentarily confused. “You have to wipe.” It was one of those things that she could easily have forgotten. Sam reached over and took a wad of toilet paper. She cautiously touched herself with it, dabbing herself, then stroking, she was soon finished but before she discarded it she felt a jolt and Will watched her shiver. She looked confused as she dropped the paper into the toilet, but Will knew exactly what had happened, and this was no time for it however and she turned away leaving Sam to finish. “What now?” she whispered quietly to herself.</p>
