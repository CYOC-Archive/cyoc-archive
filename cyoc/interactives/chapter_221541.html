<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You make your way back to the city, cat carrier and bag of pet supplies in hand as you squeeze into your apartment’s elevator with a large group of other tenants coming back from rush hour, making their way up the skyrise. Your lanyard clatters against a frustrated man in his late-fifties that your compacted against, the keycard reading “Alex Gartner: Associate Accountant: Male: B.D. February 4th, 1993”. For the first few floors the congestion inside the small metal cube climbing into the air is unbearable, but gradually enough people leave for the remaining travelers to be able to breath. Not a word is spoken between anyone, Covid-recommended face masks obscuring everyone’s mouths as nothing but the occasional cough and the purring from your new cat in the pet carrier can be heard.<br />
<br />
The third to last tenant steps out, leaving only you and another woman left in the elevator. She peers at you then towards the box, making you wonder whether that mask was hiding a smile, whether she is about to say something. She is a slight woman with long dark hair that obscures part of her face, always dressing in a cold, stuffy-looking suit you’ve seen on all the other office woman around the city, making you wonder what she’d look like without it. She seems like she’s around your age, maybe in her mid-twenties, and you’ve seen her countless times heading up the elevator but never said a word to her; you didn’t even know her name. The air feels static between the two of you, as if someone is about to break the silence that the two of you always shared heading up the elevator – like the spark of a conversation is about to ignite. She looks at you as if she is asking for you to say something, as if she wants to know about your now cat – wants to know a little about you. But you hesitate, standing there wondering what you can say to impress her, a bell dinging and the door opening, releasing the tension as the woman left. It’s fine. You’ll talk to her one day. Just not today.<br />
<br />
Your apartment is almost at the very top of the building, a luxury suite that you’d always wanted to have ever since starting your accounting job. The maid had been in today, leaving the one-bed living space fragrant and clean. Rarely did you ever have anyone over, normally only leaving the house to commute to work. Maybe others would say it was a lonely way to live, and maybe they’d be right, but it did work for you. Living like this let you spend all your time working then relaxing, focusing on no one else but yourself, at least… until now.<br />
<br />
Before popping the eager black cat out of his carrier, you read the instructions the shelter provided, setting up the litter box in your bathroom and laying out the cat’s food and water bowl. You empty a can full of Cat Chow in his dish for dinner and scrawl his name on the food bowl in black marker.<br />
<br />
“All right, little guy. Er… I mean, Zazy.” You say, kneeling down to the cardboard carrier as the cat rumbles inside like a motorboat, purring up a storm as he realizes he’s about to be let loose. You snap the makeshift cage open, watching the lithe night-black feline strut out, peering left and right around his new surroundings, then looking right back up to you before stroking himself against your leg.<br />
<br />
“Like your new digs? Pretty swanky, huh?” You chuckle at the affectionate feline as he circles around you, rubbing himself against your ankle then circling down for another pass, begging to be pet. “Aw, someone’s happy to be outta that shelter, huh? Just don’t rip up the couch and I don’t mind you crashing here, little guy!”<br />
<br />
It’s funny. Your first minute with your first ever pet cat and you’re already talking to him like he’s your kid. You oblige the amorous cat as you kneel down on the tiled kitchen floor and stroke the tomcat along his slender back, soft and smooth fur feeling so nice gliding along your palm. The guide mentions your new cat would go after the food and then explore his new home for a while, but strangely, his first order of business seems to be you. Zazy hikes himself up on his backlegs, pawing at your chest as you lose balance and fall butt-down on the floor. Your back is pushed up against the refrigerator as the cat saunters atop your chest and presses his nose right up against yours. A soft, churring rumbling escapes through that wet sniffer before his tongue peaks out, pecking at your lip, licking you again and again and again.<br />
<br />
“Hey, hold it boy, let daddy get up.” You sputter, wrapping your hand around Zazy’s belly to lift him up… but for some reason, not doing it. The feeling of that lapping at your lips is completely alien to you – felt good to you. Since you had not only forgone friends to focus on your career, but a girlfriend too, you were deprived of this very feeling for… well.. your whole life… and even from your pet, it feels nice.<br />
<br />
He&#39;s a cat, just a stupid, little animal and you know it. You know that his little kitty kisses mean nothing at all. Maybe at best he’s just trying to groom you, but just being touched like that… felt magical.<br />
<br />
“Good boy… good boy…” You chur back to Zazy over and over again as that black tongue dips in between your lips. Its scratchy surface stimulates the nerve endings in your mouth as some of his savory feral taste oozes onto your tastebuds. You part your lips as your own licker peaks out to meet his, Zazy’s tiny tongue starting to wrestle with yours, your new cat purring all the while.<br />
<br />
You stretch out, reclining on the kitchen floor as your breathing grew calm and relaxed, simply letting the your cat groom your mouth for as long as he pleases – and he doesn’t seem to want to stop. You feel like you’re at a spa, getting treated to a deep, calming massage as your thoughts start to get somewhat fuzzy, your fuzzy feral friend’s rumbling started to sound… different.<br />
<br />
“Good boy… good boy…” You hear, but it isnt your voice saying it to your cat, it’s your cat saying it to you. Something wasn’t right. The urge rises in your mind to get up off the ground, but Zazy suddenly quells that instinct by shoving his muzzle against your lips. Those dark feral eyes look straight into yours like a tiger to his prey, his tongue lapping across the tip of your nose as you feel it twitch… you feel it, diminish…?<br />
<br />
“I’ll make it all better.” Zazy churrs as he lays on your chest, his vibrating purring beginning to make your whole body tremble, as a sinister, alien feeling starts to wrack your body. <br />
<br />
Diminishing. It’s the only word that springs up in your racing mind as the tomcat’s sharp teeth gently grasp your lower lips, pulling them up towards your shortening snub nose as you feel your face start to crackle and extrude outward. At best, that crumpling and creaking sensation in your face is benign, like how it feels to snap your knuckles. After a few moments, however, your body seems to realize the sheer gravity of what’s happening, your shifting nerves beginning to scream out in pain as a feline muzzle begins to sprout out of your face. You wince as your human body begins sounding the panic alarms as a strange force begins to mold you in a shape you aren’t meant to have. It feels as if an existential immune system suddenly began trying to fight off a magical threat, and it’s losing!<br />
<br />
You want to fight, but your arms and legs aren’t working right! It feels like suddenly all the connections and insertions in your musculature aren’t made to move your body anymore! Your new pet hardly seems to notice, Zazy calmly lapping and churring at your face as a blonde-yellow coating of fuzz starts to appear wherever he licks. That fur color is the same tone as your human hair, spreading as fast as a wildfire across your bare skin as you watch your cat suddenly get bigger… or you smaller.<br />
<br />
“Such a pretty kitty…” Zazy murrs in a teasing tone as you felt your office suit grow four sizes too big, your body starting to swim underneath that black and white garment, arms and legs kicking as they too begin to succumb to this creature’s magic. Your pant legs and sleeves hide the changes from view, but you could feel them. Your bones become molten, snapping and shortening as form and function begin to deviate far from anything befitting a human. Your femur and humerus lose most of their length as your ankles and forearms painfully stretch out. Everything starts to bend the wrong way, your arms no longer able to extend or grip or grasp as they take on the shape of forelegs to compliment your new feral form. Plush paw pads stamp your shrunken palms as you waggle them feebly in the air, catching a glimpse of those tiny feline legs as your lower half pop free of your pants, the cat on top of your chest now just as big as you!<br />
<br />
“Aw? Feels good to be feral, huh?” Zazy purrs as he strokes his cheek against yours, a loud snap forcing you to yelp out in pain as your spine realigns to force you into a quadrupedal stance, making you feral - just like he said. You try to talk – to show some sort of defiance, but you can’t form the words! What remains of your voice box leaves any utterance coming out as a high-pitched meow, hopes of screaming for help vanishing as you curse at your pet with a series of violent mewing.<br />
<br />
Your insides begin to roil as liquid flesh boils underneath your shirt. It feels hell-hot, forcing you to mew in agony against your pet’s lips as your organs shift in shape to that of a small animal’s. Your muscles begin to tighten and compact into the lithe form of a cat, Zazy’s heft starting to weigh on you for the first time as you realize that now he was bigger!<br />
<br />
In a flurry of motion, Zazy lifts his head over yours and dips his muzzle down to your neck. He bites down, hoisting you up by your scruff as you hang limply in his grasp, completely unable to fight back or even meow as you’re forced to watch the last of the changes wrack your squirming body. Fur spreads along your feline belly before a terrible pressure begins pressing at the tip of your spine. Your hips sway in discomfort as pain greater than anything else racked your new body!<br />
<br />
All you can do is cry as Zazy held you there, a nascent tail bursting out just above your butt, waggling and writhing in pain as blood drips from the tip. It grows longer and longer, almost the length of your whole body as that prehensile addition begins to drag against the kitchen floor.<br />
<br />
“Such a drama queen!” Zazy playfully mumbles with his mouth full of your scruff. “All done! Would have been much easy if you just accepted it – just accepted that you’re a cute little kitty cat.”<br />
<br />
If you could blush, you’d be bright red. Why does he keep calling you a cat? You aren’t his cat, you’re his owner! You’d just lost your humanity, your whole life as a human! Zazy spoke with a lazy, relaxed tone as your whole life was turned upside down. Who the hell would take this so lightly!? Although you can’t move with the larger cat carrying you by the scruff, you were ready to claw his eyes out – ready to do anything to show him you aren’t going to take it!<br />
<br />
Zazy struts around the kitchen with you hanging in his mouth, the big black cat purring as he waggles you back and forth in his maw. After a little while he strides up to his food dish with that big helping of mashed up tuna and chicken cat food inside, lowering your face down until your nose is pressed up right against it. As he sets you down, his larger body dips down on top of yours, pinning you in place under his snug belly before letting go of your scruff.<br />
<br />
“GET OFF OF ME! WHAT THE HELL EVEN ARE YOU!? CHANGE ME BACK RIGHT NOW, YOU STUPID SON OF A-…!” You mew out in a language that only a cat could understand, spewing out all your pent-up anger before Zazy bites down at your scruff once again, tugging your head up and making you look into his deep, red, cat’s-eye-marble eyes.<br />
<br />
“Come on, don’t be like that.” Zazy speaks with his mouth full of your fur. “Inside voice.”<br />
<br />
You want to fight back, but with his teeth tugging you like that it was completely futile. Nature made kittens go completely quiet and limp whenever their mom tugged them up by the scruff, and your pet is using it against you! It’s humiliating, but you have to do as he says if you want free reign of your new body. After a few moments, he lets go again, dunking your muzzle into that smelly bowl of cat food.<br />
<br />
“Change. Me. Back.” You mew out a growl, “We’re locked in my apartment. We’ll both starve if I’m a cat!”<br />
<br />
“You worry too much.” Zazy purrs, his tongue lapping over your yellow-fuzzed scalp as he pushes your head down towards the food. “Just relax. Let’s share a dinner. Go on.”<br />
<br />
You struggle against the large cat’s pushing as your whole face is forced into the stinking Cat Chow. That fishy musk tingles against your nose as your whiskers smoosh up against the sides of the bowl. The smell drools through your nostrils, smearing its flavor on your feline tastebuds as it made your belly gurgle. You were about to make dinner when you got home, you’d bought a tasty piece of salmon just for tonight… but now, your new pet isn’t giving you any other choice.<br />
<br />
Zazy’s head dips over yours, his snout pushing into the food just above you. “Mmm… It’s my favorite!” Zazy purrs, licking his chops before biting down on a large chunk of tuna and chicken mush. As he eats, he nudges cat food down towards your snout, burying your muzzle in the smelly food, urging you to eat like a cat and leaving you little other choice but to succumb to your feline instincts.<br />
<br />
You open your maw wide and snap at the cat food, feeling that slushy flavor of savory meat drown your tastebuds. You hate it, it tastes so good, and you hate yourself that you like it, just like your captor wanted you to. A few tears drip from your whiskers into the food bowl as you eat more, Zazzy more than happy to give you the lion’s share of the pet food.<br />
<br />
The black cat continues to rumble and purr as he stays perched on your back, his lithe musculature stroking against yours as his head arches back up to groom your scalp, toying with your pointy cat ears. It feels good, unreasonably good. “Mmrow” he rumbles out without any intention in being understood. That meow was nothing but a relaxed, feline utterance. At least for the moment, Zazy doesn’t seem to have anything to say to you, content with letting you eat as he purrs and rubbs and meows on top of you.<br />
<br />
“Mro…ow.” You rumble back, your eyes suddenly opening wide as you realized you just did it too. What the hell’s happening? You aren’t actually enjoying this, are you? You lift your head out of the nearly empty food bowl and try to slip out of Zazy’s grasp, but he’s strong enough to hold you firmly in place, not letting you move or pull your head away.<br />
<br />
“Stop that! Talk like a person and just get off me! This is too weird…” you mew out in protest as Zazy’s hold on you tightens, his purring vibrating your whole body as his jet black prehensile tail wraps around yours.<br />
<br />
“Mrro-ow. Mrrrooow. Mrow.” Zazy continues to speak to you as if you were an animal like him, his meaningless utterances causing your body to shiver in a foreign pleasure as your stance underneath him starts to widen. Warmth stirrs in between your legs as the prickly head of your new cat cock slowly peaks out from your sheath, your pet’s inane meowing making you hotter than you’ve ever been as a gooey stream of pre leaks from the tip of your feline penis.<br />
<br />
“Mmmmrrrrowww.” You mew out a purr, the sensation of that unadulterated animal sound leaving your lips causing you to shiver in bliss. You meow again, then again and again, drawn to a new level of dizzying pleasure with each and every meow to escape your mouth.<br />
<br />
Zazy nips down on your scruff again, not so hard that you couldn’t move, but as a gentle, sensual, love bite. His rear dips down, scooping his groin up against the underside of your tail as the moist opening of his pudgy kitty sheath gives your tail hole a warm, wet kiss.<br />
<br />
Never in your whole life had you thought of yourself as gay, but then again, you’ve never had anyone treat you so tenderly before. Your touch starved-form melts underneath the jet black tomcat, a whole adulthood without a single loving hug from another suddenly imploding as Zazy covers you in his hot ebony fur. The pitch-black tapered glans of his cat prick presses against your anal entrance, drooling out several hefty dollops of pre before those spicey goo-covered barbs smooch against your sensitive ring. Your pet robs you of your virginity, his haunches beginning to push back and forth, his maleness claiming his owner’s body, claiming you as a cat.<br />
<br />
“Mroow! Mrrooowww!” You mew as more involuntary feline sounds drip through your drooling muzzle. You begin to purr just like Zazy, the infectious rumbling overtaking your body as he overtakes yours. Your tail wraps and screws around his as the tomcat’s every thrust dispells away your human cares.<br />
<br />
“Mrroww!” You purr as your pet’s feline pride slipped deeper and deeper inside of you, his warmth filling your rear as you pushed back against him. Precum oozes from your ass, coving your kitty balls and cock in his juices. You’re a cat now, the taboo realization of the loss of your humanity making your body tingle in sheer bestial bliss.<br />
<br />
A cat! A kitty cat just like Zazy said! You don’t need to work or be lonely anymore! You’re just a feral animal in need of nothing but food and petting and sex!<br />
<br />
You cum, kitten batter blasting on the kitchen floor below as your smaller body gets battered by the tomcat on top of you. You cum again and again, your fuzzy ball sack spasming as torrent after torrent of cat cum pools on the ground below.<br />
<br />
The intoxicating miasma of sweaty fur and cat sex wafts in the air around you, your pet on top of you hugging you even tighter as he tugs at your scruff, making your whole body fitfully alternate between being limp and tense, forcing your anus to clench over and over again around his hilted cock. Your insides are on fire, your body worshipping his feral penis as he stuffs you full of his kitty love. Zazy growls and purrs and meows against your neck until he thrusts your face back into that bowl of cat food, smooshing your snout into the fishy mush as he yowls out. His kitty purse spanks against your ball sack as your insides practically burst with his cum, torturously blissful hellish-heat seeping into you belly as he humps you back and forth, spurting out rope after rope of animal cum inside you.<br />
<br />
For a whole minute, the meows stop, not a sound in the air except for purring and the sloppy noise of Zazy humping against your cum-soaked butt.<br />
<br />
“Schlick… Schlick… Schlick…”<br />
<br />
Flecks of his cat jizz ooze to the ground underneath you as his heavy weight becomes too much to bear. You topple onto the ground, face pressed into your cat bowl. You’re too exhausted to understand what had happened today, and tonight you’re just content to be a cat. With Zazy on top of you, you fall unconscious, his warm licks against your neck lulling you into a peaceful cat-nap, purring as you fall asleep.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You’re awakened in the morning by your phone’s alarm clock, warning that you’ll be alter for work. Zazy is still lapping across your neck as you lay there sprawled out on the kitchen floor. Much to your disappointment, you’re human again.<br />
<br />
Had it all been a dream? No, it couldn’t have been. Your breath still tastes like pungent tuna fish, and you can feel a plug of hardened cat cum smeared across your rear. Zazy purrs as he strokes against your nude form, a voice coming from the affectionate feline just like before.<br />
<br />
“Poor kitty.” He murrs, “As much as I hate it, someone’s gotta pay for the cat food and clean the litter box! I bet you wish it was permanent, huh?”<br />
<br />
You stare blankly at the sly smirk on the cat’s face, not sure how to respond. “Well chin, up. It’s Friday and you’ve got a hot date tonight with your handsome kitty, so don’t keep me waiting.”<br />
<br />
The cat nuzzles your cheek one last time before sauntering over to the couch and hopping on top of it, digging his claws into the upholstery as he lazily sprawls out on your couch.</p>
