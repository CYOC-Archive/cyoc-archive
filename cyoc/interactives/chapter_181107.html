<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Eager to see where others think this story will go (as it hasn&#39;t been updated in a year), so please feel free to write away on this one!<br/>
<br/>
Also, this is my first attempt at writing, hope you enjoy...</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was completely dark now, with only the light of the moon and some stars twinkling away in the night sky.<br />
<br />
Tomfoolery had spent the last few hours restlessly pacing her stall, conflicting thoughts flooding her mind. Maine Starr&#39;s scent was strong in this place, making it difficult to think of much other than him. Occasionally he would kick and bang up against the wall between the stalls, signalling his eagerness to be with her. She could feel her sex winking open and closed whenever he banged against the wall, constantly driving her thoughts back to him.<br />
<br />
There was little else to hear out at these remote stables other than the occasional whinny from another horse and the scurrying of a mouse or other-such critter in the undergrowth outside.<br />
<br />
Eventually all noises died down and Tomfoolery was left alone to think about her situation abit more clearly. She was disturbed by how her mind and body had been drawn to Maine Starr. Thinking more rationally now, she was disgusted at the prospect of this horse coming after her and that her body had been willing to respond to him so easily. She resolved that she would stay away from him tomorrow, stick with Emily and hope she changes back into Tom as soon as possible. She then noticed that she was increasingly thinking of herself as female, another upsetting thought as she was becoming ever more distant to her male self.<br />
<br />
Having spent a while thinking, she realised she was hungry, having not eaten since her transformation. Emily, or one of the stable hands, who knows, had left a bail of hay inside the stall. Tomfoolery walked to the corner of the stall and smelt the hay apprehensively, slightly resentful that she wasn&#39;t able to eat a proper meal as she was accustomed to, having been a human for her entire life up to this morning. <br />
<br />
Lowering her head further, the smell was strangely appealing, so she nervously took a small bite. Chewing for a while before swallowing, which was odd in itself as her mouth automatically chewed sideways in an ovular manner, she determined that, whilst dry, the taste was not unpleasant. Nothing to write home about, remembering back to eating at a nice restaurant last year for his birthday, and how his mother would always cook an amazing roast dinner on a Sunday evening, but it was more than edible. <br />
<br />
A few minutes later and the hay was gone. Now she was thirsty. Looking around, Tomfoolery spotted a bucket hanging near the stall gate. Walking closer, she saw the wonderful sight of fresh water within. Lowering her mouth into the bucket she tried lapping up the water with her tongue like a cat or a dog would do. This did very little, splashing the water around the bucket, but not really getting any in her mouth. Becoming frustrated, Tomfoolery tried licking harder with her tongue, but all tis did was tip the bucket and the water started pouring all over the floor. The sudden splashing noise of the water hitting the floor startled her enough to raise her head quickly, lifting the bucket off the hook and dropping it to the floor, the remaining water spilling out everywhere. <br />
<br />
Tomfoolery was now feeling extremely frustrated. What had been so simple to him as a man, using his hands to raise a glass, was now such an alien concept to her as a horse. Also, why hadn&#39;t she been able to lap up the water with her tongue? Not having grow up a horse, she had very little in the way of horse instinct or know-how and was feeling ever-alienated by her new body.<br />
<br />
Not knowing how long she stood there thinking in the dark, she was eventually feeling increasingly weary. She needed some sleep.<br />
<br />
Not knowing that horses are able to sleep standing up, Tomfoolery tried lying down, a difficult movement considering she didn&#39;t want to fall over. Eventually she managed it, before realising that the stall floor was still wet. Great, she thought, another thing to add to this already bad situation!<br />
<br />
Resting her head on the cold, wet floor, she eventually managed to fall asleep, hoping that tomorrow would be a better day, looking forward to seeing Emily again and being turned back into Tom.<br />
-----<br />
Emily had a fairly normal evening at home; eating dinner, whilst lounging on the sofa, watching TV.<br />
<br />
She eventually thought back to Tom, now Tomfoolery, and how much she had enjoyed the day riding her new horse. Briefly, she considered how she was coping on her first night in the stables: was she cold? was she frightened? was she warming up to Maine Starr now she was spending the night in the stall next to his? <br />
<br />
Maine Starr. Now he was a true stallion, a good racer and would likely sire thoroughbreds, no matter which filly or mare he mates with. Thinking back to Tomfoolery, she was sure they would make champion offspring, and could be sold for quite a pretty penny. Emily&#39;s conscience chimed in for the briefest of moments &quot;but Tom is your boyfriend, you can&#39;t subject him to this. A weekend as a horse, that&#39;s what we agreed&quot;. Mulling this over for a moment, she thought about how the spell had altered reality and that no-one, apart from her and Tomfoolery, even knew that Tom had ever existed. This was a once in a lifetime chance to make some easy money.<br />
<br />
Growing less conflicted by the minute, Emily decided she&#39;d need to implant some more memories or instincts into Tomfoolery to make her comply, but that wouldn&#39;t be a problem, after all, mares and stallions belong together.<br />
<br />
Smirking at her plan, Emily made her way to her bedroom and thought about what she&#39;d need to do tomorrow to make this scheme a reality.</p>
