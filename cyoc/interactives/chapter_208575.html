<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Best friends Ellie and James, both officially 18 (as of last week) arrived at Ellie’s house after High School.<br />
<br />
“Can’t believe we’re going to college next year!” Ellie exclaimed with excitement,<br />
“Yeah yeah, you know you have to actually get in to college, right?” James said back to her, insulting her as usual,<br />
“Hey!” Ellie whined, used to James’ usual banter, “we both know I have a better shot at getting in than you do!”<br />
“Says who?” James asked,<br />
“Says everyone with a brain!” She finished, laughing along with her best friend.<br />
<br />
Ellie and James were two decent looking young students, both straight, and both not interested in each other. They’d been friends since they were young and though they’d given dating a shot (when they were like 12), they both hated it. Although their first kiss was each other, they’d never wanted to take their relationship any further than best friends. This did mean that they were both uncomfortably close, able to share absolutely anything with each other without it being awkward for them, just everyone around them. And they were happy that way. In fact, Ellie had a boyfriend… James was not a fan of him.<br />
<br />
“So what’s your problem with Seth?” Ellie asked,<br />
“I-I don’t have a problem with him…” James lied, “I just don’t really like him,”<br />
“But why?” Ellie asked, slipping off her shoes and jumping onto her bed, and staring James deep into his eyes, trying to get him to admit his real reason,<br />
“I guess its just the whole ‘macho man’ thing. You can’t seriously be into all those muscles,”<br />
“I seriously can!” Ellie said, “you wish you had those muscles…” she said, losing herself in her mind,<br />
“Hey!” James snapped, bringing Ellie back to reality, “I was the reason you got that boyfriend and you know it!”<br />
<br />
“ELLIE!!” A voice called up the stairs,<br />
“I didn’t realise your mom was home?” James said, “I’m going to say hi!!” He said, rushing out of Ellie’s room,<br />
“Don’t you dare!!” Ellie shouted, chasing after him.<br />
James was already downstairs, greeting Ellie’s mom. It was no secret between them that James thought Ellie’s mom was hot, at least he teased her about it whenever he could,<br />
“Good, this is for you,” Ellie’s mom said, handing over an envelope, “looks pretty important with the wax stamp and everything,” he noted,<br />
“Who’s it from?” James asked,<br />
“Not sure…” Ellie said, flipping the envelope over to see that the front was completely blank. Looking closer at the stamp, it had a very fancy looking ‘R’ embroidered onto it.<br />
<br />
“Open it upstairs honey, I need to make dinner for you and your sister,” Ellie’s mom said, brushing the two away,<br />
“You didn’t tell me Freya was going to be home this weekend?” Ellie asked,<br />
“Well you should’ve known,” her mom snapped back. Ellie looked grumpy, James knew not to intervene.<br />
<br />
“Well I’ll be upstairs, Ellie,” he said,<br />
“Me too,” Ellie said, pushing past James before he could even leave,<br />
“Ouch…” he said,<br />
“Just ignore her,” Ellie’s mom said, “you know how she is whenever I bring up her sister,”<br />
“I do I ever… when she starts talking about her, it’s like she never stops,”<br />
“Are you staying for dinner?” she asked,<br />
“No, sorry. I’m guessing you’ve got enough to do anyway,” James said,<br />
“Yeah… I can’t really make room for you. But feel free to come over next week!” She says, “you know we always like having you over, and you can tell me all about Ellie’s new boyfriend I’ve been hearing about,”<br />
“You’re gonna hear EVERYTHING!” James said excitedly, he loved sharing gossip.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
James walked into Ellie’s room, finding her reading the letter she’d been sent,<br />
“Hey, I don’t think I’m gonna be here much longer. I’m gonna leave in like…” he looks at Ellie, “everything alright?” He asks, but she’s lost in the letter.<br />
Finally, she looks up with very confused, intrigued, and puzzled face. She breaks the awkward atmosphere and says, “Wish for something…”<br />
“What?”<br />
“Wish for something. Anything,”<br />
“W-why?” James asks, “what does that letter say?”<br />
“Just wish for something!” She shouts,<br />
“A-alright…” James says, confused, “uhm… I wish I had…” he hesitated, then remembered what Ellie had said earlier, “I wish I had muscles like Seth,” he wished, “now what’s this all about?” He asked, snatching the letter out of Ellie’s hands. He read it aloud,<br />
<br />
“Dearest Eleanor White, and your friend James King,<br />
<br />
I would like to formally introduce myself as Rose. With the powers I possess, I have decided to pick two individuals with a bond so strong that it can truly harness an individual power. This power is that of wishing, such as a Genie or a Djinn. <br />
<br />
What I would typically bestow is an ability to make a single wish per day for one single month, however in your case I am choosing to give you both the power to make as many wishes as you want within a single week.<br />
The catch is, both of you are only able to make one wish after each other. So for example, James were to make a wish, that would mean that Eleanor is able to make a wish. Once Eleanor has made her wish, James may make a wish.<br />
Your powers are unlimited, but no wishes can be made before your opposite has made theirs.<br />
<br />
I hope this power treats you well, and your bond is truly as powerful as I believed it to be.<br />
I will be in touch in one week. Have fun.<br />
<br />
Yours,<br />
-Rose”<br />
<br />
“You really believe this?” James asked, expecting Ellie to respond with some sarcastic comment. But she didn’t instead her eyes were glued to his body. He looked down, “what the HELL!?” He cried.<br />
<br />
His whole body was built exactly like Seth’s. His arms were a lot bulkier, he had a six pack on his stomach and his chest was a lot wider. He hadn’t grown in height and his face looked almost identical, but his muscles had swollen beyond anything he’d even considered!<br />
<br />
“I-I-It worked!!!” Ellie shouted with excitement, “you made a wish! And it came true!”<br />
“Why!?” James shouted, “how!?”<br />
“Who cares why, who cares how!” She said, “we can make wishes! We can have anything we want!!”<br />
<br />
“Okay okay,” James said, afraid to even touch his new muscular body, “but why did this ‘Rose’ pick us?” He asked,<br />
“Because of our bond or something,” she said, “guess that means we do have a pretty good friendship after all,” she said, smirking, “god I can’t get over your body…” she said, jumping off her bed and grabbing James’ biceps. He flinched, tensing them, “t-they’re rock hard…”<br />
“Really?” He asked, flexing them, “wow…” he was enamoured by his muscles, “I never imagined myself so… so…”<br />
“Jacked?” Ellie asked with a smile on her face.<br />
<br />
“So if this is really true,” James started,<br />
“Which seems pretty likely,” Ellie said, squeezing James’ bicep,<br />
“Then doesn’t that mean you get a wish now?”<br />
“Yep,” Ellie said, biting her lip, “and I wish…”</p>
