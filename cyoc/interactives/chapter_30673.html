<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Go ahead and get ready, boys,&quot; Kim said.  &quot;We'll get ready for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
We turned our backs to them and pretended to get various oils and lotions ready.  We heard them stripping off their clothes behind us.  All three had similar physical characteristics.  They were all tall and muscular.  Mike was the biggest of the three, in terms of both height and bulk.  He was an offensive lineman on the football team.  He had short, fuzzy, red hair.<br />
<br />
Steve and Brad were shorter and leaner than Mike.  Based upon the positions they played on the football team, they had to be.  Steve was the star quarterback, the guy everyone else in the school wanted to be.  He was African-American, which I remember had caused him problems when we were much younger.  His family moved to this area, which didn't have a lot of minorities, and it was tough on him at first.  Once everyone realized he could play sports at a high level, he quickly became very popular.<br />
<br />
Brad was kind of a lackey or &quot;Yes&quot; man.  While he was a running back, which was a very important position, of course, he never really had ideas of his own.  He just followed the group.  He had brown hair down to about his shoulders.  His friends would sometime give him grief by calling him a girl for the longer hair.  He wasn't as dumb as Mike, but wasn't as outgoing as Steve, either.  What he did share with them, besides the physical prowess, was the fact that they endlessly hit on Rachel and Kim.  For that matter, I realized he had done the same to me.  It seemed that I had a lifetime of memories as a female, though I still had my actual, male memories, as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just lay down on a table when you're ready and let us know,&quot; I said.  Because I was really male, and knew how I'd feel if I were them, I knew they'd have massive erections by now.  I wanted them to be at ease for a minute or so and I certainly didn't want any &quot;accidents&quot; to happen.<br />
<br />
One by one I heard them get on their tables.  &quot;Guess we're ready now,&quot; Steve said.  We turned around to face them again.  I admit that I was a little turned on by their naked, muscular bodies.  Maybe this body was telling me that I really was attracted to guys.  Or maybe I was bi just like Rachel and Kim said they were.  Either way I decided not to worry about that right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, we've got a hot bunch here,&quot; Kim said with fake glee.<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys aren't uncomfortable at all, are you?&quot; asked Rachel teasingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I think we're ready to go,&quot; Steve said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, do your worst,&quot; Mike agreed while letting out another moronic laugh.<br />
<br />
Rachel strode over to Mike and ran her finger down his bare back.  He grinned and chuckled heartily.  When Rachel's finger reached Mike's bare ass, her expression turned to a disgusted scowl and she slapped him hard.<br />
<br />
I thought I was about faint as I feared the worst reaction.  But Mike just continued to chuckle like a fool.  Rachel's expression changed back to be sweet and gentle.  &quot;Now you are going to behave, aren't you?&quot; she said as she batter her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yea,&quot; replied Mike.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Kim said as she took over.  &quot;Because, boys, we don't do things like other massage places do.  We have a much healthier and much more open attitude.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite right,&quot; I said as I took over my portion of our script.  &quot;After all, it can be quite embarrassing for a customer to be naked in front of a stranger like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
They all looked a bit confused, but enticed at the same time.  &quot;So since we're all friends here,&quot; Rachel picked up from where I left off, &quot;and because we want you to be as comfortable as possible, you don't mind if we take off our robes, do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
We all reached for the ties on our silk clothing and the three boys all happily stated that they didn't mind.  We literally disrobed in front of them and let them admire our bodies for a few seconds.  Their eyes just about popped out of their heads.  &quot;Oh, come on, boys,&quot; I said.  &quot;This can't be the first time you've seen a naked girl, is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not,&quot; Brad spoke up.  &quot;Just not ones as...&quot; he paused as he searched for what he thought to be the right word, &quot;...endowed as you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nature's been kind to us,&quot; Kim said.  &quot;So let us be kind to you and give you three an experience you'll never forget!&quot;</p>
