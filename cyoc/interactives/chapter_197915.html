<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Roy was pondering what to do next, his roommate Jack came in. &quot;Hey dude, work just called. Looks like I&#39;ve got the day off. Do you need me to do your laundry while you&#39;re working?&quot; he asked. <br />
<br />
Slightly panicking, Roy pulled the blinds closed and picked up his beer can-which had formerly been a woman apparently named Ester. &quot;N-no, I&#39;m good. I did it last night. Thanks for offering.&quot; <br />
<br />
Seeing Roy holding the can, Jack smiled wryly. &quot;Drinking before work? Gonna be a tough shift, huh?&quot; he said with a laugh. Jack then went over to the box and got himself a beer. &quot;I think I&#39;ll join you. Celebrate my day off, hehe.&quot; Jack pulled the tab on his can and said &quot;Cheers,&quot; holding it out to Roy expectantly. Roy was getting nervous. What would happen if he drank this? The beer used to be a woman, after all. Would it be cannibalism?<br />
<br />
Knowing he had to make a decision quick, Roy went back to the mantra he said during his college days-&quot;Yolo!&quot; He tapped his beer against Jack&#39;s, and took a sip.<br />
<br />
The flavor was actually pretty good! It was a dark lager, with a hint of whiskey and of course, smoke. Roy was only going to take a small sip, but he ended up gulping down about a fourth of the can in one go. Jack took a relatively smaller taste, but his eyes lit up in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, that&#39;s some good stuff right there.&quot; Jack said, with a slight Southern drawl and in a higher pitch than normal. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah know,&quot; replied Roy, in a thick country accent and a distinctly female voice. He failed to notice him and Jack&#39;s new voices, however, as the alcohol clouded his mind. &quot;I&#39;m real glad I picked this beer up, I&#39;ll tell you what. They don&#39;t make &#39;em all this good ya know.&quot; Roy wiped some foam off his lips, and as he did so, they plumped up and became coated in red lipstick. Again, Roy didn&#39;t notice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say Jack, how&#39;s about you and me make a bet. Ah say I can chug this can right here faster than you. If&#39;n you prove me wrong, I&#39;ll owe ya five bucks. But if I win, you&#39;s gotta pay me. Sound fair?&quot; Roy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair? Hell naw! You ain&#39;t got no chance of winning!&quot; Jack replied, giggling to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now them&#39;s fighten&#39; words! On your marks, get set, go!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two began to chug as fast as they could, and changed in the process. First, both men shrunk down in height, with Roy ending up 5&#39;7&quot; and Jack shrinking to 5&#39;4&quot;. Their weight didn&#39;t change however, and they each became curvy in a distinctly feminine way. Jack&#39;s hips widened as his ass ballooned out, love handles appearing on his hips. Roy&#39;s legs became round and doughy, while his ass also grew, not quite reaching Jack&#39;s level. Their faces altered, becoming feminine with plump lips, long eyelashes, and not a single trace of facial hair. A pair of A-cup breasts formed on Jack&#39;s chest, while Roy&#39;s chest ballooned out into B-cups. Roy&#39;s hair also exploded into blonde ringlets, cascading down to his middle back. Jack&#39;s hair stayed black, but it grew long and straight, before a hair tie magically appeared and pulled it back into a ponytail. In their pants, both men&#39;s cocks shrank to about half their length, leaving Roy with a measly 3 incher and Jack rocking 4 inch pocket rocket.<br />
<br />
Their clothes also changed. Roy&#39;s t-shirt and jeans morphed into a red tank top and a pair of daisy dukes. Panties constricted his shrunken cock, while heeled sandals showed off his pink-painted toenails. His fingernails were painted pink as well, and his face was covered in slutty makeup. Jack&#39;s shorts extended into yoga pants, while his pajama shirt became a black V-neck with a denim vest. He was also adorned in makeup, similar to Roy&#39;s.<br />
<br />
As the last of the beer went down Roy&#39;s throat, he threw his can to the ground and crushed it with his foot. Jack finished just two seconds later, dropping his can and coughing. &quot;Fuck yeah! Queen of the mountain, baby!&quot; Roy yelled out. <br />
<br />
Jack continued to cough. &quot;Yeah yeah, you always were the best at takin&#39; up the throat. Those frat boys sure gave you a lotta practice, Regina,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hush up Jackie,&quot; Roy replied. &quot;Maybe if you was better at suckin&#39; dick, you wouldn&#39;t be-wait, what?&quot; Roy scrunched his forehead in confusion. Jack didn&#39;t suck dick, right? He was dating Sarah. Well, he sucked a lot of dick back in college. Everyone thought him and Roy were girls, so they thought it&#39;d be funny to pretend, and they actually discovered they liked doing it, so it kinda became their thing, right? Roy&#39;s eyes widened. That wasn&#39;t true at all! And yet, he now remembered it, along with remembering just being a normal guy. He ran to the bathroom immediately, and screamed. He looked like a woman! Quickly checking his pants, Roy found that he still had his penis, and sighed with relief. But still! How had this happened?<br />
<br />
&quot;Now...wait jussa minute here...that damn beer must&#39;ve had that trashy gal&#39;s DNA or somethin&#39;! Or her...essence! An&#39; so when Jackie and I drank it, we became more like her! An&#39; now I&#39;m some kinda...redneck femboy?!?!&quot; Roy said out loud, trying to process this. &quot;Aw shit! How long is this gonna last? It better not be forever, god dammit! Hey, it&#39;s beer that did this-maybe it&#39;ll go away when the beer&#39;s outta mah system.&quot; Roy looked up how long beer stays in the body on his phone. Meanwhile, Jack knocked on the bathroom door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Reggie, is you okay in there? I heard ya screamin&#39; somethin&#39; fierce.&quot;<br />
&quot;Uh-I&#39;m okay Jackie! Just slipped and spooked myself,&quot; Roy replied.<br />
&quot;Okay, just don&#39;t forget that you&#39;s gotta go to work,&quot; Jackie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Work? Shit! I gotta get ready!&quot; Roy left the bathroom, and ran over to his bedroom. He saw that his uniform was now in a woman&#39;s cut, and his nametag read &quot;Regina.&quot; Checking his wallet, he saw that his ID read &quot;Regina Milford,&quot; with his sex listed as &quot;F.&quot; Roy checked his phone, and saw that the beer would likely be in his system for 6 hours.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, so I&#39;s just gotta wait it out. By the end of mah shift, I&#39;ll be back to normal again. Although, I do kinda wanna play with this doohickey some more,&quot; Roy said, looking at the device. Should he go to work, or shine it and play with the remote? Also, Roy couldn&#39;t help but notice he was craving another beer...</p>
