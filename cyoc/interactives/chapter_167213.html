<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once he had been a Marine in Afghanistan, two tours as a corpsman he had done everything from deliver babies to literally keep a Marine alive when only bandages were holding his or her guts together. He&#39;d come home to work as an EMT for the local hospital. Hector could handle the pressure of bloody bodies. What they called the &quot;bus&quot; had arrived within a few minutes of the call.<br />
<br />
Even what he had seen with his combat experience he never expected to see it Stateside. Not in his home town. He saw two females, one white and about 30, the other a nearly headless teenager. The woman had once been stunning, even when so pregnant she was going to give birth. Her womb seemed to have been tougher than her face which a shotgun blast would have been kinder. <br />
<br />
His partner Claudia came over, fit, young and blond she was as tough as Hector was. However she vomited in horror. <br />
<br />
&quot;Claudes&quot; he said &quot;say with me man, I need you to help deliver this baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded, &quot;C-Section?&quot; <br />
<br />
She had a trauma kit out, Hector she knew had done this in some war when bombs had killed the mother or the mother was going to die. He grabbed the scalpel as he started to cut. The mother was dead but he could still save a life, he cut open the womb and through blood, mucus, amniotic fluid and other gunk. Soon the &#39;Jane Doe&#39; was cut open and twins, a boy and a girl were soon crying.  <br />
<br />
He remembered a quote from somewhere:<br />
<br />
&quot;And within each death there&#39;s always a new life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amen to that brother. <br />
<br />
Across town the war between Emily, Angel and Erika was being felt by Melissa. She sat on her bed with her corset keeping her at about three months pregnant, she could feel her babies fighting inside her. Melissa knew that she had at least twins, they were moving. She could hear the fabric ripping as her belly grew. The doctor told her that the ultra sound wasn&#39;t working or her womb had been lined with lead to stop even an x-ray. She had left the clinic saying it was bound to happen. <br />
<br />
Her tits had not grown much as she cupped them, and her other breasts or teats. Her belly had grown too.<br />
<br />
Erika appeared. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know what you did, with Cole, with Emily.&quot; she blurted out.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can&#39;t be here when you give birth.&quot; Erika said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you&#39;re a fucking killer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Emily had organized a Russian hooker to get me to fuck and cause this&quot; she indicated to her swollen belly &quot;to happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where will we go? Mexico? Canada? We&#39;re are still listed as 12 and 14 respectively.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes but we look older, a have gotten us some good stolen Canadian passports that will get us into Mexico. You will need to give birth there.&quot;<br />
<br />
She lifted up her white shirt and showed a money belt underneath a black bra. <br />
<br />
&quot;$2 million USD.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Who? When? How?&quot; Melissa touched the belt.<br />
<br />
&quot;An &#39;Olga Maria Lebed&#39; stage name &#39;Angel&#39;. When Emily sprayed Angel as the Alpha dog I touched her mind, like yours I can do like a mind trick to make you forgive me. It&#39;s Angel&#39;s life savings.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Her children survive, won&#39;t they come for us?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I made them and if necessary we have Cole.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I have the Salve and I need your permission to get his seed, think of him as a sperm donor in a bank, he is your brother same DNA.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to be the Alpha dog switching between a she and then a he. I want to be a woman and if that means getting pregnant well fuck him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa gave a curt nod.<br />
<br />
Erika slipped into Cole&#39;s room and explained the situation, he knew more than he let on. <br />
<br />
&quot;You and Mel are running away? You want me to come.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No but I want you inside me.&quot;<br />
<br />
She pulled her hand from Cole’s pants, picked up her robe and walked upstairs. Cole was just a few steps behind her, and she could practically feel his eyes burning into her ass and pussy as she went up the stairs.<br />
<br />
She turned the lock. As Cole began to fondle Erika&#39;s breasts, he lunged towards her and stuffed his tongue forcibly into her mouth. She liked the fact that Cal was a terrible kisser, that he was showing himself to have no lovemaking skills. She wanted to be fucked and used and not pleasured, just treated like the bitch she was. <br />
<br />
Cal came up behind her, undeterred, and groped her breasts, his hands blundering down her body toward her pussy, as he slipped a finger inside her wetness. She jumped on him and started kissing him violently. He jumped back a step, surprised by Erika’s sudden aggressiveness.<br />
<br />
“Fuck me, Cole,” she screamed. “Fuck me like a dog!”<br />
<br />
Cole wasn’t used to girls acting this way, so he stood there, stunned. Erika got down on all fours in front of him and started sucking on his cock, hard and fast.<br />
<br />
“Fuck your bitch Cole,” she screamed at him, saliva dripping from her mouth. “Fuck her bitch cunt.”<br />
<br />
Cole picked up his much smaller younger sister&#39;s lover and threw her on the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, I&#39;ll make you my bitch, but first I&#39;m gonna show you who the big dog is around here,&quot;  &quot;Now take it like a dog, you cunt,&quot; he said as he flipped her over and quickly drove his penis into her dripping pussy.<br />
<br />
As Cole shoved his cock further and further into her as images of dogs having sex flooded her mind.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the feeling of her Cole&#39;s penis began to change... the tip became more bulbous, and she felt more hair on his legs and stomach. His hands, which had been resting on her shoulders, suddenly got smaller and sprouted sharp claws. She could hear him shouting...<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck is happeni...oooooooooooooooooooooooooooh&quot; Cole&#39;s voice was transformed into a scared howl. She looked out of the corner of her eye and saw in the mirror that Cole had become a huge German Shepherd, and that he was driving his dog cock into her pussy.<br />
<br />
Erika arched her ass more to make it easier for Cole the dog to enter her fully as he pumped away at her. With a loud yelp he ejaculated inside her, her pussy gleaming wet with more dog cum.<br />
<br />
He slumped off of her and padded around in a circle. She stood up and looked down at him, deciding what to do next.<br />
<br />
Even as she could feel Cole&#39;s doggy semen run down her inner tights the mere view of his still fully erect cock heightened her already heavy arousal to a point were her human thoughts were eradicated by her new and indescribable animal lust.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a great stud, Cole&quot;, Erika whispered hard breathing, &quot;and you deserve a great bitch.&quot; She&#39;d be more then willing to sacrifice everything she had to be impaled by Cole&#39;s wet, hard doggy cock.<br />
<br />
While Cal observed her every move with some kind of understanding in his animal eyes, she gave into the canine side she had been fighting for months.<br />
<br />
She watched Cal, the magic of the his cum removed from his body, begin to transform back into his human self. She quickly began fucking herself with the on his semi-hard penis, and in an instant her legs grew out with fur, the nipples appeared and she began to take the shape of a dog.<br />
<br />
Cole, still hairy and partially canine, leapt at her and began something between licking and kissing with his half-dog lover. Their paw-hands groped each other as they enjoyed these fleeting moments when they were both, somewhere between human and beast. Here would be the moment when he would get her pregnant. His penis jerked and it shot enough into her to do the job. <br />
<br />
Soon, however, Erika finished her transformation, as did Cole, and the thin but toned young man stood over his sister. The dog looked up at him with human comprehension in its eyes, and took one quick lick at his still semi-erect cock.<br />
<br />
Cole bent over and began patting his lover and scratching her behind her ears, while his other hand pulled his penis out and began fingering her wet dog pussy.<br />
<br />
Erika yelped at him and turned, her tail up in the air, her pussy engorged. She turned again and nuzzled her brother&#39;s crotch, licking at his balls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now that you&#39;re my bitch, Erika, I&#39;ll give it ti you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole knelt behind the dog, Erika, and slid his penis into her dripping dog pussy. She whimpered quietly as he began to ride her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like me fucking you like this, you bitch?&quot; he taunted. Erika yelped and let out a soft howl. He rammed his thick cock deeper into her bitch cunt, grabbing the hair on her hackles to push into her harder. He slowed down every few minutes to keep himself from cumming as he jammed himself deeper into Erika, this bitch in heat he was riding.<br />
<br />
With a huge moan he shot his semen into her, collapsing across her back. <br />
<br />
About an hour later she got up.<br />
<br />
Cole would sleep deeply as she collected Melissa and left her house to start a new life in South America with their mutant babies using a dead stripper&#39;s money.</p>
