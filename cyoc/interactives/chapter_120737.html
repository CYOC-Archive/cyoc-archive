<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Martha puts down the phone; the call ending as she returned back to the living room where she and her husband William were entertaining guests. The guests in question were Jack Johnson, the town’s district attorney. As well as Jack’s father; an old man clearly in his seventies. Jack Johnson however looked more in his twenties, despite being roughly forty years in age. Jack was a were-cat; the family were, his father and mother electing not to become ones after moving to Moon Lake decades ago.<br />
<br />
“That was Amanda calling,” Martha sitting down next to her husband; “with the police checkpoints all over town, the Knight’s felt it was best that Eric stay over there.”<br />
“Makes sense,” Jack responding; all the while William just grumbles. “The less people get in the way as they look for the would-be assassin, the quicker they’ll apprehend him.”<br />
It was only a few hours ago that Frederick Parker was shot as he was being escorted out of the court house. The officer handing him off to an awaiting deputy was killed with the same bullet that tore through Frederick. By some miracle, Frederick survived the shot; while his spine was severed, rendering him a quadriplegic.<br />
<br />
“So much for having a chat with him today,” William sighing. Wanting to talk to his son Eric after his first day of school; electing to have him placed in advanced classes as well as college level courses, due to his excellent grades. William was suppose too tell Eric about being placed into senior year of high school some time during summer break; yet never getting the time, due to college course work or Eric spending the entirety of his summer break with Spencer and Frieda.<br />
“There is always tomorrow,” Martha placing a hand on her husband; both currently not in there were-fox fursonas. Yet for Martha a chance to have the entire house with just her husband, was something here inner vixen was itching to enjoy. The fact that her hand was on her husband’s thigh and slowly moving up it, despite company present was a big clue to her husband.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
 Meanwhile, at the Twist household:<br />
<br />
“Why don’t you stay the night,” Frances speaking as she looks at Alex walking to the backdoor. Ben’s werewolf boyfriend, stayed over after the two mowed a few lawns after school ended. With Alex working for Nate Anderson in his burgeoning landscaping business, Ben reluctantly joined in after his attempt to get a job at Grrrrrrr fell flat.<br />
<br />
“I only live across from the wooded area,” Alex answering; “it’s not as if I’ll be getting in the police’s way.”<br />
“It’s not the police I’m worried about,” Frances answering; “it’s you. At this moment the police have no clue where Frederick’s shooter is,” Frances sounding genuinely worried; “the man could be hiding in the woods behind our house as we speak.”<br />
“I doubt it,” Alex looking dubious back at Frances; “besides, I know those woods like the back of my paw.”<br />
“Be that as it may,” Frances getting up from the kitchen table; “it would put me at ease if you remained here. I’ll call up your parents so they don’t fret with worry.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
“We should get going,” Jack getting up; “we can always get together another day. Perhaps mom will be well enough to join us,” Jack helping his father up.<br />
“I’m not so sure about that,” old man Johnson responding with a not so subtle wheeze from his breath; “after she broke her hip, your mother’s health has deteriorated quite a bit.”<br />
“What about the physio,” Jack looking at his father; “the nurse that comes by three times a week.”<br />
“She and your mother,” old man Johnson looking at Jack and stifling a cough; “had a nasty scrap. To make a long story short and to spare our hosts an embarrassing situation,” old man Johnson looking at Martha and William; “your mother accused the nurse of trying to seduce me. Believing her to be a sex starved were…”<br />
“You got to be kidding,” Jack groaning as he interrupted his father; “when did this happen?”<br />
“Last month,” the old man answering; “you know how your mother is, especially after…”<br />
“After I became a were-cat,” Jack shaking his head; “or is it the no grandchildren thing?”<br />
“Does it matter,” Jack’s father responding; “I’d rather we not have this conversation here.”<br />
<br />
Jack was about to answer when he looked at both the Anderson’s as they say on the sofa looking back at him. Shaking his head and sighing, Jack helps his father to the front door.<br />
“It was nice to meet you both on a more informal nature,” Jack speaking; “we never had a chance to talk, not since the whole situation with Julie Stovall.”<br />
<br />
Watching the two Johnson’s leave through the front door and closing it soon after, William turn’s to his wife.<br />
“Was it just me? Or did you also hear a subtle sucking sound?”<br />
“I heard it,” Martha answering; “I’m sure Jack also heard it as well. I may not be a doctor,” Martha sighing; “but it sounded like old man’s Johnson’s heart. I didn’t know a were’s hearing can be that acute,” Martha getting close to William and hearing the steady rhythm of his heart; “even out of our fursona.”<br />
“Speaking of fursonas,” William turning around; “what say we slip into ours and head upstairs?”<br />
“I’d like that very much,” Martha crooning as she started undoing buttons on her dress and blouse; “but let’s have fun downstairs. I want to hear you and you alone. No police sirens, no neighbors. Just you and me,” Martha letting her clothes fall to the floor just as she murrs in delight as red and black and white fur envelops her body; the were-vixen coming out just as William shifts into his were-fox fursona. Martha’s vulpine ears swiveling and twitching as William’s heart beat picks up in tempo.<br />
“Lead the way then,” William yipping happily; his vulpine member out at full mast as he can smell his wife’s arousal emanating from her furry snatch.</p>
