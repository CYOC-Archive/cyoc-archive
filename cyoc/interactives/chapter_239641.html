<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The three of them stumbled out of the frat house, the early morning light stinging their eyes. The night had been a whirlwind of sensory overload, and as they made their way home, the reality of what had happened began to sink in. They were all exhausted, but the potion&#39;s after effects had left them with an energy that was hard to ignore.<br />
<br />
Once inside their apartment, Will and Mikey couldn&#39;t stop talking about the party. &quot;Dude, your cock is a fucking legend now,&quot; Will said, slapping Mikey on the back.<br />
<br />
Mikey couldn&#39;t help but chuckle, his cheeks still flushed from the excitement. &quot;Yeah, I guess so. But what about you, man? You took to that pussy like a fish to water.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh, who had been silent since they left the party, finally spoke up, his voice thick with exhaustion. &quot;Guys, I need to crash.&quot; He stumbled down the hall to his bedroom, leaving Mikey and Will in the living room, their eyes meeting with a mischievous glint.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve gotta find that bottle,&quot; Will said, his voice low. &quot;We can&#39;t just leave it lying around.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mikey nodded, his mind racing with the possibilities. They both knew that if anyone else found out about the potion, things could get messy. They searched the kitchen, the bathroom, even under the couch cushions, but there was no sign of it. Just as they were about to give up hope, Will spotted it, half hidden behind a stack of dirty dishes in the sink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jackpot,&quot; he murmured, pulling out the bottle. It was still half full, the murky liquid sloshing around inside.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY^1: The three roommates leave the frat house party, buzzing from their experiences with the potion. Will and Mikey discuss the night&#39;s events, praising each other&#39;s performances. Concerned about the potion&#39;s potential, they decide to find the bottle, which is discovered in the kitchen sink, half-full.<br />
<br />
Mikey took it from him, inspecting it carefully. &quot;What the fuck is this stuff? It&#39;s like we&#39;ve got a magic fucking wand here.&quot;<br />
<br />
They both stared at it for a moment, the weight of their discovery sitting heavily in the air. Then, with a shared look of understanding, they decided to keep it a secret. They didn&#39;t know what kind of trouble they could get into, but they knew it was something special.<br />
<br />
As they put the bottle away, they couldn&#39;t help but feel a little giddy. The night had been a game-changer, and they had the power to do it all over again. But for now, they had to keep it to themselves. They didn&#39;t want to risk losing it or getting in trouble with the law, or worse, the university. They had a good thing going, and they weren&#39;t about to let anyone ruin it.<br />
<br />
Josh, oblivious to their plan, was already snoring in his bed, the events of the night playing out in his dreams. Little did he know, his newfound addiction was about to become the talk of the town, and the object of every frat brother&#39;s fantasy. And even though he was tired, he could feel his body already craving the next hit of pleasure.<br />
<br />
Mikey and Will looked at each other, the wheels turning in their heads. They needed answers. They had to know what was in that bottle. Without wasting another moment, they decided to head back to the shady alley where Mikey had found it, the place where it all started.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY^1: The roommates decide to keep the potion a secret due to its powerful effects and potential for trouble. They feel giddy with the power they hold, and Mikey and Will resolve to find out more about the potion&#39;s origins by returning to the alley where it was found, as Josh sleeps off the intense night&#39;s events, unknowingly becoming the talk of the town.<br />
<br />
The Cum N&#39; Gro was a dilapidated store, nestled between a closed-down pizzeria and a laundromat that had seen better days. The neon sign flickered, casting an eerie glow over the shelves filled with dusty bottles and jars. The cashier, a man with a greasy comb-over and a stain on his shirt, eyed them suspiciously as they walked in.<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys are back,&quot; he drawled, his eyes lighting up when he saw the half-empty bottle in Mikey&#39;s hand. &quot;I knew you&#39;d be back for more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mikey slammed the bottle on the counter. &quot;What the fuck is in this shit?&quot; he demanded.<br />
<br />
The cashier&#39;s grin widened, showing a row of yellowed teeth. &quot;It&#39;s a secret recipe, my friend. All I can tell you is that it&#39;s 100% natural and guaranteed to enhance your... experience.&quot;<br />
<br />
Will leaned in, his voice low and menacing. &quot;Look, we need to know what&#39;s in it. We&#39;ve got a situation here.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man&#39;s smile faltered for a moment before he shrugged. &quot;Sorry, can&#39;t help you. It&#39;s a one-time deal. You buy it, you use it, you deal with the consequences.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mikey&#39;s grip on the counter tightened. &quot;You&#39;re telling me that you&#39;re just going to let us walk out of here without any clue about what we&#39;re dealing with?&quot;<br />
<br />
The cashier leaned in closer, his breath hot and sour. &quot;I&#39;m telling you that if you know what&#39;s good for you, you&#39;ll keep using it and keep your mouths shut. You don&#39;t want to mess with the kind of power that comes with that bottle.&quot;<br />
<br />
SUMMARY^1: The roommates visit the Cum N&#39; Gro store where Mikey found the potion, seeking answers. The cashier confirms it&#39;s a secret natural recipe that guarantees to enhance experiences and warns them about the power associated with it, hinting at the potential dangers of disclosing their discovery.<br />
<br />
Mikey and Will exchanged a look. They weren&#39;t about to let some creep hold all the cards. They decided to do some investigating of their own, hoping to uncover the truth before the potion got them into even more trouble.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, we need to know what&#39;s in that stuff,&quot; Mikey said, his voice firm. &quot;What happens if someone overdoses? What are the side effects?&quot;<br />
<br />
The cashier leaned back, his grin morphing into a sneer. &quot;Oh, you&#39;re worried about side effects? That&#39;s cute. Let me tell you, the only side effect is that you&#39;re going to want more, and more, and more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Will stepped in, his tone more threatening now. &quot;We&#39;re not playing games here. If you don&#39;t tell us what&#39;s in it, we&#39;re going to spread the word about your little shop of horrors.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man&#39;s eyes narrowed, and for a moment, it seemed like he was going to call their bluff. But then he reached under the counter and pulled out a small, leather-bound book. &quot;Fine,&quot; he said, slapping it down on the counter. &quot;But you&#39;re going to have to pay for the information.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mikey and Will looked at each other, confused. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Mikey asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean,&quot; the cashier leaned in, his grin returning, &quot;you&#39;re going to have to give me something in return. And I&#39;ve got just the thing.&quot; He gestured to a peculiar contraption in the corner of the store. It was a milking machine, but not the kind you&#39;d find on a farm. This one had two leather cups attached to a pump, and the sight of it made Mikey&#39;s cock twitch in his pants.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY^1: The roommates threaten to expose the cashier&#39;s secret if he doesn&#39;t reveal the potion&#39;s contents. He offers a deal, presenting a leather-bound book with the recipe but requires them to use a special contraption, a modified milking machine, to obtain the information, causing Mikey&#39;s curiosity and arousal to spike.<br />
<br />
&quot;One day of milk,&quot; the cashier said, his eyes gleaming. &quot;From each of you. That&#39;s the price for the information you seek.&quot;<br />
<br />
The room grew quiet, the only sound the faint hum of the neon sign outside. Will and Mikey glanced at each other, weighing their options. They didn&#39;t know what they were getting into, but they were desperate for answers. Finally, Mikey nodded. &quot;Fine. We agree.&quot;<br />
<br />
The cashier cackled, a sound that sent a chill down their spines. He shuffled over to the milking machine, his movements surprisingly spry for a man of his age. &quot;Good choice, boys,&quot; he said, his voice dripping with glee. &quot;Now, let&#39;s get you hooked up.&quot;<br />
<br />
They were tied down, their wrists and ankles secured to the cold metal chair. The leather cups were placed over their cocks, and the cashier began to fiddle with the machine&#39;s settings. The anticipation was almost unbearable, their hearts racing as they wondered what kind of twisted pleasure this would bring.<br />
<br />
The cashier flipped a switch, and the pump whirred to life. The leather cups tightened around their cocks, and the sensation was unlike anything they had ever felt before. It started slow, a gentle suckling that grew more intense with each passing moment. They watched as their cocks began to swell, the leather stretching to accommodate their growing girth.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY^1: The cashier makes a deal with Will and Mikey to provide the potion&#39;s recipe in exchange for a day&#39;s worth of &quot;milk&quot; from each of them, using a special contraption. They agree, feeling a mix of fear and anticipation as they are secured to the machine, experiencing an unusual sensation that intensifies as the leather cups adapt to their growing erections.<br />
<br />
The cashier leaned back in his chair, watching them with a hungry gaze. &quot;You see, this machine is designed to bring out the best in you,&quot; he said, stroking his own crotch. &quot;The more you struggle, the more you&#39;ll produce.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mikey and Will gritted their teeth, their bodies straining against the restraints. The suction grew stronger, the cups pulsing rhythmically as they worked to coax out their cum. The pleasure was intense, almost painful, but they knew they had to endure it if they wanted to find out the truth about the potion.<br />
<br />
As their orgasms built, they could feel their balls swelling to unnatural sizes, the pressure mounting. They had never felt so full before, so close to bursting. And then, with a suddenness that took their breath away, they both shot their loads into the awaiting cups, their cum spurting out like geysers.<br />
<br />
The cashier&#39;s eyes grew wide, his hand moving to his own swollen cock. &quot;Impressive,&quot; he murmured, his voice thick with lust. &quot;Very impressive.&quot; He leaned over, his mouth hovering over the cups, and took a deep breath, inhaling their musk.<br />
<br />
And with that, the information they sought began to flow from his lips. He spoke of ancient herbs and dark rituals, of the power contained within the bottle they held. It was a heady mix of science and sorcery, and as they listened, they realized that they had stumbled upon something far more powerful, and far more dangerous, than they had ever imagined.<br />
<br />
But even as he talked, their bodies continued to pulse with the aftershocks of their forced climaxes. They were now the cashier&#39;s playthings, and the thought of what else he might do with them sent a shiver down their spines. The price of knowledge had never felt so high, and as the cashier leaned in closer, his breath hot against their skin, they couldn&#39;t help but wonder if they had made a deal with the devil himself.<br />
<br />
With a cackle, the cashier stood up and disappeared into the back room, returning moments later with two small pumps. He attached them to their nipples with a twist, and the sensation was like nothing they had ever felt before. It was as if their entire bodies were now part of the machine, each beat of their hearts driving the pumps to suck and release in a never-ending cycle of pleasure and pain.<br />
<br />
Mikey and Will squirmed in their seats, their bodies betraying them as they began to produce milk from their nipples. It was a strange, humiliating sensation, but also one that sent jolts of arousal through their bodies. They could feel the cashier&#39;s eyes on them, drinking in their suffering and their pleasure, and it only made them more aware of the power he held over them.<br />
<br />
As the pumps continued to work their magic, the cashier leaned in closer, his hand resting on Mikey&#39;s thigh. &quot;You know,&quot; he whispered, &quot;you could make quite the income here. Just think of the men who would pay to see you two in action.&quot; His grip tightened, his eyes gleaming with malicious intent. &quot;You could be my little milk boys, serving all my customers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mikey and Will exchanged horrified glances, their bodies still shuddering from the relentless milking. They had never felt so vulnerable, so used, and yet there was something undeniably arousing about the whole situation. The power dynamic had shifted, and they were now at the mercy of this twisted man and his contraption.<br />
<br />
Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the cashier reached over and flicked a switch. The machines whirred to a halt, and the leather cups released their grip. The two roommates slumped in their chairs, their bodies aching and sore. They looked down to see their cocks and balls had grown even larger, now grotesquely swollen and sensitive to the touch. Their nipples were now the size of quarters, red and engorged from the constant suction.<br />
<br />
The cashier unbuckled the restraints with a flourish, stepping back to admire his handiwork. &quot;Now, now,&quot; he chuckled, &quot;don&#39;t go anywhere just yet. We have a little more business to attend to.&quot; He handed them each a small bottle filled with a clear liquid. &quot;Drink this,&quot; he ordered, &quot;It&#39;ll help with the... side effects.&quot;<br />
<br />
They took the bottles warily, glancing at each other before downing the contents. The liquid was cold and bitter, but as it hit their stomachs, they felt a strange warmth spread through their bodies. The pain began to subside, and in its place, a new kind of energy took hold. The cashier smirked, watching them closely. &quot;Now, if you ever want to reverse the effects of the potion, you know where to find me,&quot; he said, tucking the leather-bound book into his pocket.<br />
<br />
Mikey and Will stumbled out of the store, their heads spinning. The world outside felt alien, their newfound endowments bobbing and jiggling with every step. The sun was just beginning to rise, casting an eerie glow over the quiet street. They couldn&#39;t believe what they had just been through, and the reality of their situation began to sink in.<br />
<br />
As they made their way back to the frat house, they couldn&#39;t help but feel a mix of dread and excitement. What had they unleashed? And more importantly, what would they do with it? The power of the potion was undeniable, and the thought of the pleasure it could bring was almost too much to handle. But the cashier&#39;s words echoed in their minds, a reminder of the darker side of their discovery.<br />
<br />
They reached the house, slipping in through the back door, hoping not to wake anyone. But as they entered the hallway, they heard the sound of footsteps approaching. It was too late to hide. They could only hope that whoever it was, they were still too drunk from the party to notice the changes in their anatomy.<br />
<br />
Josh emerged from his room, blinking sleepily. His eyes widened as he took in the sight before him: Mikey and Will, their pants bulging with their newfound size, their nipples standing out like tiny beacons of temptation. He stared for a moment before bursting into laughter. &quot;What the fuck happened to you guys?&quot; he asked, wiping the sleep from his eyes.<br />
<br />
Mikey and Will looked at each other, then back at Josh. They knew they had to tell him the truth, but where to start? The night had spiraled out of control in ways they couldn&#39;t have possibly imagined. But as they stood there, the beginnings of a plan started to form in their minds. If they could harness the power of the potion, if they could control it, maybe they could all benefit from this strange twist of fate.<br />
<br />
They took a deep breath and launched into the story of their encounter with the cashier and the machine, leaving out the more sordid details. Josh&#39;s eyes grew wide with amazement, and then, slowly, a sly grin spread across his face. &quot;So, you&#39;re telling me we&#39;ve got a ticket to the ultimate frat house party trick?&quot;<br />
<br />
Will nodded, his hand absently caressing his swollen cock. &quot;Yeah, something like that,&quot; he said, a glint of mischief in his eye.<br />
<br />
And with that, the three of them stood in the hallway, their futures uncertain but their friendship stronger than ever. They had a secret</p>
