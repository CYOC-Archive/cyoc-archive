<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The gorgeous sound Breanna made was exclusively heard by Grant’s ears for the rest of the week. He couldn’t wait to get back home to strum out a few songs on her strings and become entranced by the notes. She was his alone to hear, but on Saturday morning he packed her up in a case and biked across town in excitement. He had band practice and couldn’t wait to play her for his buddies.<br />
<br />
Jimmy’s house was the destination. His parents were always out weekends and they had full access to his garage, never getting a single noise complaint from his neighbours so long as they finished by six. Even then it wasn’t ever anything serious.<br />
<br />
The guys were already assembled when he arrived. Jimmy fiddling with the microphone, Zack mindlessly drumming out the odd beat, and Kevin keying out the first notes of their soon to be charting hit Wicked Brother, named after their band. A couple sparse greetings were given but Grant was eager to uncase Breanna and strum a couple chords on her. His band mates were impressed by her sound and complimented her. He basked in their praise for a moment before Jimmy called to start rehearsal.<br />
<br />
They opened with a couple b-list tunes that would populate their album. They needed to warm up for their eventual chart topper, playing over an hour of music before the garage fell silent. Jimmy then turned to them, brushing a hand through his short cropped hair and frowned. “Alright, we’re going to make this song work this time. Kevin’s altered the tune slightly and Zack’s got his drum skin fixed. Let’s see what that new guitar can do.” “Aye, aye!” They all saluted before taking deep breaths, their future success before them. “One, two, three!” Zack shouted and they all began to play. The notes sounded better than before, harmonizing cleaner than ever. Breanna was really putting in work, echoing every chord Grant played perfectly. He sported a wide smile as Jimmy drew a deep breath and launched into the lyrics of Wicked Brother. Everything had come together perfectly to that point, and yet those lyrics brought the whole song down. It was perfectly fine for a garage band, talent show, or weekend down at the pub, and Grant, Kevin, and Zack felt very satisfied by their playing at the end. Jimmy however, clamped his mouth shut as the song came to an end and balled his fist angrily.<br />
<br />
“If only I could hit those higher notes,” he wished and Grant smirked at him.<br />
<br />
“Should we go find your sister?” He teased.<br />
<br />
“No, no, I’ll just have another go,” Jimmy replied. “Let’s take it from the top.”<br />
<br />
Notes and chords filled the air again as Jimmy approached the microphone again and took a deep breath. Grant frowned a little, knowing Jimmy wouldn’t be satisfied with their song. If only there was a way for him to hit those high notes…<br />
<br />
As he thought that a buzz seemed to erupt from Breanna, a quaver on the sound waves that felt really good. It seemed to direct towards Jimmy and swirl around him, vibrating his very soul. He inhaled deeply, his gasp becoming higher as he drew in breath. He then began to sing. His voice shifting and heightening, becoming almost feminine. Lyrics escaped his lips, sounding more alive than ever before and their song went from okay to fantastic. It careened around the garage, echoing perfectly off every corner. By the end of the first lyric there was no way anybody would believe their lead singer was a guy, and the changes didn’t stop there. Jimmy’s short cropped brunette hair began to cascade down his back, becoming glossy and well kept. It began to shimmer as dyes leeched into it colouring it a deep unnatural blue. It began to weave itself into a rough and mangled braid that settled on his shoulder and draped down to his flat chest.<br />
<br />
Jimmy sang, unaware of his changing hair or shifting face. His eyebrows slimmed and lips puckered up while his jawline smoothed and shrunk. Mascara began to pool around his eyes and with every blink his eyelashes extended. If you only saw his face you’d mistake him for a girl. The tip of his braid tickled his chest, brushing over his flat nipple repeatedly. The vibrating of his voice and that gentle brushing made his nipples stand erect and slowly they began to be pushed forward. Out his chest expanded, matched by the narrowing of his shoulders. Fatty breast tissue formed, bloating into shapely curves and settling cutely on his chest. His T- shirt shrunk, pulling inwards and curling around those breasts. Its retreat exposed a curvy waist and barren shoulders. The fabric changed, cupping his boobs and presenting a deep valley of cleavage. He now looked like a girl from the waist up.<br />
<br />
Jimmy’s hips quickly began to widen and he shook them as he sang, his bloating ass rounding out to perfectly compliment them. He… or rather she gasped as her dick collapsed in on itself and opened a new slit in her crotch. Body hair retracted down her legs, her pants crawled up her legs until they hugged her ass as dark booty shorts, and her shoes became a pair of sandals. Every toenail and fingernail painted itself black and a silvery necklace formed around her neck. Tattoos styled like spiderwebs crawled up her left leg and arm, making her look gorgeously asymmetric. She sang, unaware of the changes, in fact she wasn’t aware she’d ever been Jimmy at all, she was Jenny. As this thought settled she opened her eyes, the final perfect note escaping her lips. The band behind her fell silent and she turned, smiling at them.<br />
<br />
“Looks like Jenny and The Wicked Brothers is going to be a hit,” she declared, a light Irish accent now clinging to every syllable of her voice.</p>
