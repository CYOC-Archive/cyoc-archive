<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> “Five hundred million dollars raised for pediatric cancer research through this meet and greet Natalie how do you feel?” DJ Michael Spornak or simply DJ Mike asks me <br />
<br />
“Well it’s just so amazing, when XrX pharmaceuticals reached out to me and asked me to spearhead this campaign I jumped at the opportunity. As someone with my type of platform, I knew with the help of my loyal fan base we would achieve well beyond the original ten million dollar goal.”<br />
<br />
“Wow so, can you tell us about this very lucky fan?” <br />
<br />
“I am actually going to be meeting this fan after our interview today and I would prefer to keep their identity secret. But I can assure you they are an amazing person.” <br />
<br />
“That’s so amazing Natalie you really are a role model for everyone in your generation, okay I think that’s a wrap for the show today come back tomorrow y’all!” Micheal says before signing off his morning show. <br />
<br />
“Hey I would just like to say thank you for having me on your show Mike!” I say as I shake Micheal’s hand <br />
<br />
“Of course you’re welcome back anytime Natalie!” <br />
<br />
After I say some goodbyes and thank the staff in the radio station I am off. Oh, how rude of me, I haven’t properly introduced myself my name is Natalie Delgado. I am 23 years old and an international pop star. I was born in San Jose, California and was discovered at the age 12 where I was quickly thrust into the spotlight, mainly doing cringe worthy yet incredibly lucrative teen sitcoms and movies. Once I turned 18, I started my solo pop career and with my pre-established fan base I had quick success with my first album going double platinum. After that I did a little three month tour, where I made a ridiculous amount of money. I then and released my second studio album last year once again going double platinum and getting tons of streams, this was also my dip into the Spanish music scene as I have Puerto Rican heritage, I was a little scared at first but it turns out my Spanish music hits with the latin music market. My social media feed has been growing over the years leading to large paychecks for sponsored posts. With all of this money coming my way, I decided to move from Cali to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I bought and then demolished a mansion to build my own palace. It’s futuristic and comes with every amenity I could ever want and my own custom at-home studio, allowing me to be more of a home body. <br />
<br />
Two months ago, the pharmaceutical giant XrX, reached out to my team and asked if I could spearhead their fundraising efforts for pediatric cancer. I was so flattered that they want me to be the face of their campaign and I said yes. When I went to tour their labs as part of the promotional material, I was given off-camera access to their secret experimental company Multiplicity Inc. and witnessed the power of a Clone Machine firsthand. I didn&#39;t know such technology existed. I was told by the company if I raised more than ten million dollars, I could receive my own Clone Machine and clone, if I wanted. I don&#39;t why but the thought of having another me just feels good. I know I am vain at times but the thought of turning someone else into me, just feels oddly satisfying to me. My record label has no problem with it either because if one of me is burned out, the other me would pick up the slack. <br />
<br />
With that, I pushed so hard to get people to donate to the campaign. I even promised a random lucky winner a chance to have a meet and greet with me. After two months, we well surpassed our goal. As I have been telling you my story, I have been driving back to my home from the radio station in Miami. <br />
<br />
Once I arrive home, I see the Multiplicty Inc. trucks have already made it. I make my way into my home and I am greeted to see a Clone Machine in the study of the mansion. Sometimes I just sit in my study to read a book but now the room will serve as the location for my own Clone Machine. The machine resembles an old photo booth albeit with more chrome. I see a team of physicians from Multiplicity Inc. and the lucky winner Johnathan. He is about 5’11” and an average-looking guy with an average build and short wavy red hair. <br />
<br />
”Wow I cannot believe it, I am meeting Natalie Delgado, I am such a fan of your work!” <br />
<br />
”Hi there Johnathan, thank you so much! It&#39;s a pleasure meeting you and thank you for donating to the fund!” <br />
<br />
”Of course it&#39;s such a good cause! When I learned about the true prize I would be getting I jumped with joy!” <br />
<br />
”That&#39;s great to hear, listen you can still back out from this part of the prize if you want, I know it&#39;s a lot and if we can just have a normal meet and greet.” I say to Johnathan making sure he is fully okay with being killed and turned into another me <br />
<br />
”No I want this to happen!” <br />
<br />
”Okay then, it was a pleasure meeting you, Johnathan!” <br />
<br />
”Likewise!” <br />
<br />
The team of physicians injects Johnathan with a variety of different serums and then he strips down and enters the machine. The chamber doors lock and Johnathan’s fate is sealed. I watch as the machine hums and beeps, I am then handed a tablet showing a naked Johnathan in the machine. Gas enters the chamber and the changes start to happen. Johnathan’s height decreases rapidly until he is at my height of 5’4” and then I notice his face is morphing and begins to resemble mine. The wavy hair he has becomes brown before becoming much longer reaching his waist and becoming curly like mine. His skin changes from pale to caramel and I see buds forming on his chest. In no time, those buds form into an exact copy of my perky and firm, C cup breasts. I notice now that Johnathan has a perfect copy of my face and I have to say I look amazing with or without makeup. His stomach becomes flatter and toned, his waist narrows, and his hips expand giving him my hourglass figure. It&#39;s a chore to maintain my sexy body at times at least now I&#39;ll have a workout buddy that knows exactly how I like to train. His average-sized cock is quickly changed into a copy of my reproductive system. The machine stops and the door opens, my newly created clone stumbles a bit but I go to give her a hand. After a verification check/biomarking  and thank you, the team leaves and I am left with a Clone Machine and of course my clone. <br />
<br />
We stand there in complete silence, although we are both excited to see each other, it&#39;s just a little weird knowing we are both Natalie Delgado. <br />
<br />
”Hi Natalie, how are you doing?”  I say to my new clone <br />
<br />
”I am doing pretty good actually, I like that outfit, were are you doing a media appearance today?” <br />
<br />
”Yes actually, I was in Miami this morning, on the Sunny Side Show with DJ Mike.”<br />
<br />
”Wow that&#39;s great Mike is a great interviewer and I am sure you slew that interview!” My clone says before hugging me<br />
<br />
It feels nice having a copy of my naked body hug me. I then take my clothes off right in the study, and I am just as naked as my clone. We look at each other and start to touch each other, although it&#39;s not sexual, we are comparing parts and we are indeed identical to each other. We sit down on the couch and just hold hands soaking in this new chapter. She starts to massage my back and hits every spot just right causing a moan to escape my mouth. I hear a giggle from her before I get a kiss on the cheek. <br />
<br />
”I am starving, how does an egg white omelet sound?” my other self asks <br />
<br />
”That sounds wonderful!” <br />
<br />
As we make our way to the kitchen, I am amazed that my clone perfectly recreates my mannerisms right down to my confident sexy walk. My clone dons an apron and begins to make some egg white omelets for us. The way she walks and dances while cooking and even handles the knife is exactly like how I do it. I am amazed by myself so much! She then places the omelets down on the table and we begin to eat. It&#39;s nice talking to someone like me and we play footsie under the table. My lord my skin is so soft! After lunch, I handle the dishes and I see the other me is walking to the bedroom. Once I am done with the dishes, I walk to our bedroom and I see my clone checking herself out in the mirror. I come up behind her and cup those nice tits of mine and she moans. I kiss her on the neck and tell her to sit down on the chair as I begin to rub her feet. She enjoys this feeling and once I am done, we both get up and embrace. <br />
<br />
”Natalie take me right now on our bed!” My clone growls to me<br />
<br />
”My pleasure darling!” I say before shoving my clone on the bed <br />
<br />
I get on top of her and we start to hump like animals. Having a perfect copy of me has unleashed this almost feral need to fuck myself. I take my thigh and put it against my clone’s pussy and she does the same with me. We then start to rub up against each other and we both let out loud moans. God it feels so nice and I feel a type of love, I have never felt for any human being on Earth. I know my clone feels the same way. We kiss in between our moans and we also play with each other’s breasts. We feel like our love for each other is building up and I feel tears swelling up in my eyes. I know I am about to come and I then it hits me. It feels like a damn well has burst and I start to orgasm so loud and I cry tears of pure joy as does my clone. We hold each other tightly as we pour our emotions out. After 15 minutes we finally have some clarity. My clone wipes the tears from my face and I from hers.<br />
<br />
”I love you so much, Natalie! You are my soulmate!” my clone says to me <br />
<br />
”I love you too Natalie, you are perfection and I will love you forever!” I say to my clone/soulmate</p>
