<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tom just froze with horror as the mirror toppled forward. I retrospect she should have dived in front of the falling peice of furniture, it was a risk she should have taken to save herself from remaining as she was. Anything would have been better,  but that is in retrospect. As it happened time seemed to stand still and Tom did nothing but watch as the mirror toppled forward and crashed to the ground making a tremendous sound as the glass fractured. <br />
<br />
If Tom didn&#39;t already have her mother&#39;s and Sally&#39;s attention she did now. Sally just stared at Tom with his eyes open in disbelief. Slowly a smile extended onto &#39;his&#39; face as he realised the consequences of what had just happened.<br />
<br />
Linda also took a moment to comprehend what had happened before her face contorted in fury &quot;What have you done now!&quot; she screeched at the person she thought was her younger daughter. &quot;Go to your room at once! Just be careful not to tread on the broken glass! I&#39;ll deal with you in a minute!&quot;<br />
<br />
Unbeknownst to Tom her face had turned deathly pale as she too realised the consequences. If it had been the mirror that had caused her to swap bodies with Sally then she had just sealed her own fate. How on earth was she going to swap back now? In her shock she had not heard her mother&#39;s raging. Sally gently tugged on her arm and pulled her away from the shattered glass.<br />
<br />
Tom&#39;s other siblings had heard the commotion and come to the room to see what had happened. As they entered the room Linda addressed them &quot;Stay back! There is shattered glass. This imbicil just toppled a mirror!&quot; Linda was red with rage as she pointed at Tom &quot;We are all expected at the Kensington&#39;s house in just over an hour, it is vitally important that we make a good impression and now I have a mess that needs cleaning up!&quot; Linda took a moment to recover her composure then addressed the new arrivals. &quot;Tracy, will you take your sister back to her own room and see that she changes into that white sundress she was given at Christmas. Henry, go and fetch a broom and a dustpan. They should be in the laundry. Tom, go and fetch a rubbish bin. And Max, just return to your own room and put on your best clothes&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom found himself led by Tracy back to Sally&#39;s room. She was numb with the realisation that she had sealed her own fate. With the mirror broken there was no way she could convince her mother that the body swap had ever taken place. What on earth was she to do? She guessed she had no option but to do as her mother had told her. Like a zombie she found herself undressing from the simple shirt and shorts that Sally had been wearing prior to the bodyswap. Underneath the shirt, she was wearing a simple brown bra and pale blue panties. She looked down at her body in disgust having difficulty seeing past the breasts on her chest. From this angle those breasts seemed huge. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve never seen Mom so angry. What on earth did you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I pulled the sheet off the mirror and ....  #sob! #sob!! ........ it just ...... fell over&quot; <br />
<br />
Tracy gave her younger sibling a knowing look &quot;I suspect there was more to it than that. But if you don&#39;t want to say than you don&#39;t want to say&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom took the proffered dress from Tracy and examined it, it was white with some sort of pink flowers printed on it. She then looked at it more closely trying to work out how it should be worn. She had just figured out where her arms need to go when Tracy told her &quot;Surely you have prettier underwear than that? That bra looks way too small for you. Besides, if you are wearing that dress you will need white underwear&quot; Tom saw that Tracy had found a white dress with a pink flower pattern on it.<br />
<br />
Tom just shrugged her shoulders. She didn&#39;t know what to say. She didn&#39;t even know if Sally had any other underwear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well have you unpacked your underwear yet?&quot; <br />
<br />
Without prompting Tracey opened the wardrobe in Sally&#39;s room. Almost immediately she had a matching white bra and panties in her hands. &quot;Wear these. They seem to be the only decent set you have&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They are too pretty&quot; Tom complained. Indeed they were very lacy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grow up Sally. You are becoming an attractive woman. Soon all the boys will be chasing you. You can&#39;t keep hiding your figure&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want any boys chasing me&quot; <br />
<br />
Tracy just replied with a &quot;Hmmmph#&quot; then undid the frayed light brown bra. In no time Tom found herself clad in the brand new white bra. Her cleavage seemed even bigger. She changed panties herself, not looking at her new groin as Tracy supervised. &quot;You need to start trimming your pubes&quot; was all her older sister said. Tom ignored the comment.<br />
<br />
Next she stepped into the dress and Tracy zipped her up. &quot;I don&#39;t suppose you want help with your makeup? I know &#39;You don&#39;t wear makeup&#39;, but you really need to learn&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think this outfit is already girly enough&quot; Tom replied<br />
<br />
&quot;Well brush you hair at least&quot; Tracy said before continuing &quot;I need to get myself ready. If you ever change your mind about makeup just ask&quot; With that Tracy left the room.</p>
