<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&#39;Well you know everyone who will be there so I guess you main task will be to convince you mother not to come and see how her poor sick boy is. Just tell that when you left Bill was sleeping&#39;<br />
<br />
It seemed strange to Bill that this four year old girl was talking like an adult. But then he knew it was his wife in that little body. The medallion had turned Jill into a duplicate of Melannie, their 4 year old daughter. However even stranger to Bill was that he was now in Jill&#39;s body. Somehow he had consented to put on Jill&#39;s black dress, be made up, even as far as wearing Jill&#39;s jewelry and scent and was now negotiating the walk to the restaurant in Jill&#39;s heels to meet his own family on the night before his sisters wedding. Bill noticed how her whole body seemed to wobble with every step she took. It also felt really strange having dangly earrings in her now pierced ears. She couldn&#39;t complain as they were his gift to Jill on her 25th birthday. <br />
<br />
They had left the real Melannie in the care of Ian, aka Isabella, also now a duplicate of Melannie. As they left Melannie was introducing Isabella to her favorite dolls, which as usual had come with them. A room service pizza had just arrived which was going to be the girl&#39;s meal for the night. Giving Melannie some pizza was to compensate her for not seeing her cousins at dinner. It would have been pretty difficult to explain how there were suddenly three Melannies.<br />
<br />
They entered the restaurant to see Bill&#39;s parents and siblings at a table. The only absence was Angie the bride to be. She was evidently having dinner with her fiance&#39;s family but had promised to call in later. As the apparent Jill took a seat she apologized for &quot;Bills&quot; absence as he was &quot;Feeling a bit off and had decided to stay in&quot;. As expected Bill&#39;s Mother wanted to immediately go and see how her son was. It took a bit of coaxing to get her to sit back down. &quot;Jill&quot; explained how Bill was asleep when she left and how she wasn&#39;t planning to stay late.<br />
<br />
That was when the apparent Melannie piped in with &quot;But Mummy you pwomised I could stay up and play with the big kids&quot;. The real Jill was referring to Bill&#39;s older sister&#39;s kids, Ralph and Emma. Those two were 6 and 8 respectively and looked up to by the real Melannie. Jill had taken the seat beside Emma.<br />
<br />
&#39;You will go to bed when I decide young lady&#39; replied Bill in Jill&#39;s best school teacher voice.<br />
<br />
Conversation was easy enough for Bill. The real Jill had always got on very well with his three sisters and their partners. Bill even remembered to say a few of the phrases that were Jill&#39;s favorites such as &quot;wall papering over the cracks&quot; and &quot;She is such a ditz&quot; when talking about Kimberly, her eccentric boss at the salon. Bill repeated some of the tales the real Jill had told him about Kimberly and soon had the sisters laughing.<br />
<br />
Bill did get a cross look from the Melannie look-a-like when she ordered a large steak for her dinner. She immediately recognized her mistake.  Jill had been on a very strict diet in order to regain her figure for this wedding. The real Jill no doubt would have ordered a salad. However no one else seemed to notice this slip up.<br />
<br />
As it turned out, with her new stomach Bill struggled to eat half of the steak that was put in front of her. She actually felt a bit bloated but maybe that was also a bit to do with how much wine she imbibed. Bill now blessed with Jill&#39;s taste buds really enjoyed the wine and she was drinking it too quickly. Bill&#39;s Mum noticed but didn&#39;t say anything. As far as she was concerned this was the most entertaining the usually straight laced Jill had ever been. <br />
<br />
The alcohol quickly went to Bill&#39;s head. She had forgotten that she now had only 60% of her normal bodyweight. She became more vocal. The real Jill noticed and got Bill&#39;s attention. She came over and touched Bill on her wrists &#39;Mummy, I need to go wee wee&#39; <br />
<br />
When Grandma volunteered to take the girl she thought was Melannie. Jill had to throw a tantrum &#39;No I want it to be Mummy&#39;<br />
<br />
Once safely in the ladies rest room the four year old addressed her apparent 25 year old Mother. &#39;For god&#39;s sake Bill stop drinking so much. You are making a fool of me. No more wine and as soon as we have finished dessert say goodnight and take me to bed&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;But you just said you wanted to stay up&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Only to be in character. Every four year old wants to be a big kid. I must admit kid&#39;s talk is so inane  Right now I could do with a bit more adult conversation. And I am sick of lemonade. Watching you guzzling that wine has made me a bit envious&#39;<br />
<br />
While in the ladies Bill thought she might as well void herself. She went to a stall pulled up her dress, pulled down her panties and sat but couldn&#39;t find the right muscles to make anything happen. Jill tried to coach her through the door but in the end Bill had to give up. She was busting but couldn&#39;t pull the right trigger. <br />
<br />
Back at the table dessert was waiting for them. Bill resisted the temptation to have her glass refilled. The arrival of the bride to be delayed their departure but after &quot;Melannie&quot; threw a bit of a tantrum Bill had the perfect excuse to make her escape.<br />
<br />
They arrived back at the room to find the other two little girls together in a bed. Both were sound asleep and both wearing Melannies nighties. They had bought two along as sometimes Melannie still had night time accidents. Neither Bill nor Jill could tell which was the real Melannie. On Jill&#39;s coaxing Bill gave both of the sleeping little girls a kiss goodnight. Bill noticed she left a lipstick mark on each forehead.<br />
<br />
Jill then coached Bill through her nighttime ritual. She had to remove all makeup and apply some sort of cream. She did finally manage to empty her bladder, the secret was to relax her muscles rather than push as she was used to. <br />
<br />
Jill slept in the double bed with Bill. She insisted Bill wear her own nightie. Bill was a bit uncomfortable wearing the pink satin nightgown, he remembered how sexy Jill looked when she wore this particular gown. Thoughts of Jill wearing the gown had Bill&#39;s nipples enlarge but she had to admit it did feel nice against her smooth skin. She fell asleep with her arms wrapped around little Jill.</p>
