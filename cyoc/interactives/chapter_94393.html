<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Allen knew who&#39;d changed Jen almost immediately as he saw him earlier in the day. It was Kyle, the least popular guy in school. Allen used to feel bad for the kid, and knew Jen to be cruel to him at times, but still thought the punishment didn&#39;t fit the crime. <br />
After giving Jen some of her intelligence back, he had her dress herself in a mossy green skirt that complimented her skin, and a thick cream sweater. Allen was no longer to keen on allowing the green nymph to show off her delicious body to anyone at school--he was a bit possessive in that way.<br />
He then grabbed her hand and led her towards his car parked outside in the student parking lot. Jen complied, finally staring him with adoration in her large emerald eyes. Allen couldn&#39;t resist, giving his girl a peck on the forehead and a twist to her still erect nipples. Jen moaned, but didn&#39;t say anything--just the way Allen likes it, he preferred quiet girls. <br />
They drove in silence to Kyle&#39;s home, only to find it empty. Allen then noticed a key under the welcome matt in their porch, and unlocked the front door. Slowly, he entered, and as suspected, the house was devoid of people. Allen pulled Jen inside and sat down, pulling the confused girl on her lap. Allen quietly began to kiss Jens full lips, his hands landing on her derrière. Jen released a guttural moan and began to smash her large tits against her lovers chest. <br />
Allen felt her squirming in his lap, and reached under her skirt to feel her bare pussy. <br />
She was soaking wet. <br />
Slowly, Allen inserted a finger into her pulsing heat. Jen only reacted by kissing him with a renewed vigor, she wrapped her arms around her neck, enjoying the feel of his long fingers inside her. He continued to slide his digit in and out of her, adding a second one a few seconds later. After a minute of euphoric friction, Jen came, dampening Allen hands. Slowly, the boy put his hand to his mouth, and began to lick of here juices. Jen only stared at him, a dark haze in her green eyes, and a strange tinge in her tinted skin. <br />
&quot;Do you trust me Jen?&quot; Allen suddenly asked, unzipping his pants. &quot;Do you trust me in dealing with Kyle.&quot; <br />
While already lifting her skirt, Jen nodded. &quot;I trust you and no one else. Kyle deserves your punishment.&quot; <br />
Allen grinned, satisfied with her response, and then proceeded to stand and drag Jen to him, taking her from behind. In the mirror facing them, Allen could notice the look of bliss in Jens face at the feel of him sheathed fully inside her. He wished he could of done more for her, but second transform and dares were never potent as the first, and he knew he could only make so many changes before the spell became null.<br />
They continued to fuck until they noticed Kyle walking up the driveway. Allen had Jen rehearse her lines, and ran to hide in the kitchen by the front door.<br />
When Kyle first came in, he grimaced at the sight of the conservatively dressed nymph he formally made into a giant whore. &quot;What the fuck are you doing here you dumb lesbo slut?&quot; <br />
Before Kyle could continue to speak, Jen said the words, &quot;transform or dare?&quot;. By the time Kyle could even process her request, everything turned black for him. Allen had snuck behind him and hit him with a vase he&#39;d found inside the kitchen. <br />
Quickly, they tied Kyle to a chair, and tended to the light wound on the side of his ear. Ten minutes later Kyle awoke, only to find Jen sitting demurely in front of him. &quot;A minute passed and you didn&#39;t answer, so I guess you get both.&quot; She smiled. <br />
&quot;What the fu--&quot;<br />
&quot;Silence.&quot; She interjected, and and Kyle, much to his chagrin, complied. <br />
&quot;I apologize for any harm I may caused you in the past Kyle. But the changes you made to me were permanent and dire. My bullying was wrong, but your objectification of me was even worse. I can no longer go back to who I once was, so I suppose it&#39;s only fair if I do the same to you.&quot;<br />
After she finished, Kyle only stared at her with dull hatred in his dark eyes. Jen shivered, but carried on with Allen&#39;s plan. <br />
&quot;You will turn into Kylie, a transfer student from South Carolina. You&#39;re body will turn into that of a thin and athletic fifteen year old females, and that includes your genitals.&quot; Kyle thrashed against her orders, feeling his body softening and become smaller. He could feel his penis retract and small mounds on his chest growing. Jen immediately stilled Kylie, and carried on. <br />
&quot;You will have gone into puberty young, resulting in the large DDs you now have. You will have very sensitive breasts that will remain perky throughout your lifetime. You will be hairless below your neck, and your dark hair will turn silky and long--to about the small of your back. You will shorten to about 5&quot;3.&quot;<br />
Kylie felt all the changes seeping in--his body buzzed. Her chest grew to their large dimensions, struggling against the ropes binding her. They loosened slightly when she shrunk a few inches and her dark hair began to pile over her shoulder. <br />
&quot;You will retain your love for videogames and computers, but you will lose the nasty attitude and sadistic streak. Your memories will be those of a conservative but pretty teenage girl from the South with a good upbringing. No one in this town will remember you or Kyle, and you will lose your memories as a male. Your are now just Kylie Jensen, the new sophomore.&quot;<br />
Kylie, though slightly dazed, nodded in agreement. <br />
&quot;That being said. You will dress in skirts or dresses all the time. You will enjoy wearing heels all the time, and you will be otherwise very girly. Tomorrow morning, on your first day of school, you will see me in first period math and befriend me. We will become BFFs in a matter of days. Everyone will know you as the sweet, smart, shy, good natured girl with the big tits, a nice face, and a cute southern accent.&quot;<br />
Kylie eyes changed suddenly, becoming warm and pleasant. She didn&#39;t know why, but she offered Jen a kind smile. Jen responded equally.<br />
&quot;Kylie, as for your dare. I dare you to fall into deep love and lust with the man you mistreated most in your previous life. You will treat whoever this is with submission, respect, and unconditional affection. He in turn will reciprocate your feelings immediately, and the two of you will have a relationship fully accepted by everyone.&quot;<br />
Jen, content with everything she listed, ended her wish, &quot;Kylie, you will go to your bed and sleep. Ten minutes later, you will clean up the mess here, get rid of any possible evidence of our being her and then forget about this entire incident. I will be a stranger until we meet tomorrow morning.&quot; <br />
Jen then let Kylie go and watched her enter her bedroom. Allen approached her and kissed her in approval of her actions, the two then walked out the house and towards Allen&#39;s place. When asked who he thought Kylie would fall in love with, he explained that the dare was tailored specifically for Kyle&#39;s old sidekick, billy. A boy who was too soft hearted for his own good, and often yelled at by a cruel Kyle. Jen smiled in understanding, and latched on even tighter to Allen&#39;s arm. <br />
Little did they know that Billy wasn&#39;t in Kylie&#39;s cards...</p>
