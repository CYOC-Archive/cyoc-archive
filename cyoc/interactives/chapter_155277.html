Perfectly Fitting Clothes, Part 1<br />
By extramorphs<br />
<br />
I&#39;ll admit, I was a bit skeptical at first. A spray that made clothes fit? It seemed too good to be true. And, it was an infomercial, one of those late-night ads for products that seem much more useful than they turn out to be. But I figured maybe this was one of those diamonds-in-the-rough you hear about - a miracle product that works, simply undiscovered.<br />
Now, you may be wondering - &quot;why don&#39;t you just buy clothes that fit&quot;? Well, I&#39;m sure some of you will identify with me when I say that they don&#39;t make them! If I buy dresses that are long enough for me, they expect me to have big, wondrous breasts to fill them up. And if I buy dresses that match my bust size, that don&#39;t look like they have two huge, empty pockets sitting proudly on my chest, then the hem and waist creep up by half a foot and suddenly I&#39;m pushing my dress down Marilyn Monroe-style to keep it from exposing my nether regions. Don&#39;t get me wrong - being 5&#39;11 and nearly flat-chested doesn&#39;t make me an insanely skinny pencil-for-a-human, but it does make it harder to shop for clothes.<br />
So needless to say, when I saw this product that you simply spray onto clothes and it makes them fit, I was very, very excited. I have a lot of clothes that I think are quite gorgeous and I can&#39;t wait to actually have them fit me.<br />
I ordered two bottles, in case the first bottle wasn&#39;t enough. If this worked, I&#39;d be using a lot of it.<br />
****<br />
Two weeks passed, and the package finally arrived. I called my friend Amanda and asked her to come over to try it out with me. I thought she&#39;d be excited about the product; not to mention that I needed a friend to spray it on while I wore the clothes.<br />
She was initially much less excited than I had expected. &quot;You paid over a hundred bucks for two Windex bottles with cheap labels put over them?!&quot;<br />
I tried to console her. &quot;Yeah, but what if it makes all of my clothes more wearable? That&#39;s worth it to me. Plus, you can use some.&quot;<br />
&quot;And when it doesn&#39;t work and all you have is some defective glass cleaner?&quot; she retorted.<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s just try it and see.&quot;<br />
I flipped over the bottle and read the label. The directions were simple enough: Put on the garment to be fitted. Lightly mist spray over the entire area that doesn&#39;t fit. Allow the product to take effect before removing the garment. After one minute, the garment will fit.<br />
I decided to start with my prom dress - sure, prom was over two years ago, but I had loved the dress and was hoping I could eventually get it tailored to fit me. It was a beautiful, sleeveless, gold dress, with a smooth, close waist, and a gold silk knot at the hip. The skirt hung delicately but carelessly. It was my favorite dress I&#39;d ever had, but I had never really been able to fill it up top, as the designers seemed to have a C-cup in mind for my dream dress. Well, that was about to change. I rushed into the other room to put it on while Amanda sat on my bed with her skeptical look.<br />
&quot;How do I look?&quot;<br />
&quot;Marvelous, darling, just marvelous,&quot; Amanda replied, with a tone so sarcastic I thought she was going to pull a muscle.<br />
&quot;Anyway, spray it on my chest. That&#39;s the part I&#39;m least happy with this dress.&quot;<br />
Amanda picked up the bottle, sloshed it around to stir it up, and walked around me, misting the spray on my upper body as she went. The stuff didn&#39;t seem like much - mostly like I was being sprayed down by a water bottle, which was refreshing if anything.<br />
&quot;See? It didn&#39;t work. You wasted your money.&quot; chided Amanda.<br />
I protested. &quot;It says it takes a minute! Let&#39;s just watch and see if it works.&quot;<br />
Thirty seconds passed. My heart dropped. Did I just waste a week&#39;s enthusiasm and two weeks of tips on this worthless watery spray?<br />
Slowly, something started happening. The wrinkly fabric of the loose cups started to smooth out and unfurl itself as if it were spreading over my breasts more smoothly. However, the dress also made my breasts look a lot bigger than they actually were - and given how thin the fabric was, I did not understand where the extra volume was coming from. The dress even seemed to get heavier and the cups moved as if they were really full of flesh.<br />
Amanda realized it before I did. She started stammering something: &quot;You&quot;“ you&quot;“ your&quot;“ ... you...&quot;<br />
I looked in the mirror. The advertising was right, the spray really did make the dress fit well. It was a very realistic effect. They even seemed to gently bounce as I turned to get a better look at the new-and-improved dress.<br />
Then it hit me. The weight, the volume. The dress didn&#39;t change at all. The spray had changed me - the dress wasn&#39;t suddenly full of &quot;something&quot;, it was full of my new breasts!<br />
I quickly pulled the dress off to get a closer look, heedless that my friend was right there. There they were, my full, beautiful breasts. Wow. I wasn&#39;t an expert in bra sizing, having not really needed one, but I estimated that they were at least C-cups.<br />
I decided to break the silence. &quot;I guess it worked?&quot;<br />
&quot;Can- can I feel them?&quot; Amanda asked.<br />
&quot;You might as well - you sprayed them on.&quot;<br />
Amanda reached out and gingerly touched my right breast. She poked at it a little, as if to make sure it wasn&#39;t a hologram or hallucination. As she probed my new assets, I took a moment to also inspect and appreciate them. They were very perky, and while I might need a bra to keep them in place during physical activity, I certainly wouldn&#39;t need a bra to keep them up.<br />
Of course! They were made with the intention of filling that dress - and that dress would look awful if I had to wear a bra under it.<br />
The nipples were interesting. My nipples, now, I suppose. The areola was only slightly darker than my light complexion, about an inch and a half in diameter - nothing odd going on there. But the nipple itself was totally flat. Now, I know nipples aren&#39;t normally very full if you&#39;re not aroused, but these were actually flat.<br />
Then it hit me again - they were designed for this dress. The dressmaker wouldn&#39;t want my nipples poking out and being obvious while I was dancing around, so they were simply flat in their unexcited state. Logical.<br />
Amanda stopped poking at my breast and had what seemed to be an epiphany. &quot;This works to make ANY clothes fit, right?&quot;<br />
I nodded with as much confidence as I had - after all, her and I had both used the product together exactly once, just now.<br />
What seemed like out of the blue, Amanda removed her shirt, and started to undo her bra. &quot;I want you to put on my bra and we&#39;ll try the spray again.&quot;<br />
Amanda was a little shorter than average, but where she was lacking height, she was not lacking in breasts. We had similar ribcage sizes, but where I was an A-cup - (although at this point I was closer to a C) - she was easily a DD or E. I never know which letters to use.<br />
She took off her bra and handed it to me. I put the straps over my shoulders, then set my breasts into her bra. It was bizarre and unworldly both to put on an E-cup bra, and also have breasts that half-way filled it up. I never even imagined either before today.<br />
The moment I had the clasp secured, Amanda was already shaking the bottle and began walking around me, spraying like last time.<br />
We waited. Another thirty seconds passed. Maybe the spray only worked once? Maybe I was stuck with my C-cups? Maybe not &quot;stuck with&quot;- I prefer &quot;blessed by.&quot;<br />
A full minute passed, and nothing happened.<br />
Amanda frowned. &quot;Dang, I was really hoping that would work.&quot;<br />
As I motioned to take the bra off, I felt a familiar fullness in my chest and looked down to see my breasts actually grow into the bra. It was only a few seconds but it felt like half an hour of the flesh slowly creeping up.<br />
As they finished growing, Amanda jumped up and down a little, clapping her hands excitedly.<br />
I turned left and right, admiring myself in the mirror.<br />
Amanda reached out her hand. &quot;Alright, now give me my bra back, I&#39;m getting cold.&quot; Her nipples were standing at full attention. Her areola were almost the same size as mine, though a little darker, but her nipples, unlike mine, were very full and pointed.<br />
I took off the bra and then realized that not only did I have Amanda&#39;s breasts, but I also had her nipples. The exact same nipples I just saw on her chest were standing proudly on mine, growing stiffer in the cold room. I pinched one - oh my, they were sensitive. As I was handing Amanda her bra back, I decided that I wanted to know if hers were too - I shot my hand out and grabbed her nipple. She replied with a yelp that seemed to be a mix of being startled, pain, and a bit of pleasure. I suppose they were just as sensitive.<br />
Suddenly, a wild and crazy idea popped into my head. I skipped over to my underwear drawer and grabbed a strapless bra I had borrowed some time ago. It was too big for me to wear back when I had borrowed it, at a large B-cup, maybe even a small C, but now it seemed downright small compared to my (and Amanda&#39;s) E-cup breasts. I stopped and pondered for a moment about how strange it was to have the exact same breasts as my friend. It would certainly make borrowing clothes easier. Oh, hell - with the spray, I could borrow any clothes now. What was I thinking?<br />
Getting back to my idea, I put on the strapless bra, but instead of trying to fit it over my breasts, I put it a few inches below them, on my ribcage. Obviously, it didn&#39;t fit in any fashion. I signaled to Amanda to use the spray.<br />
Amanda was perplexed for a moment, and then, with a visible realization, figured out what I was going for. She shook up the bottle and walked around me, misting again.<br />
This time, there was a lot less waiting time. After about ten seconds, I felt the surging sensation again, but not in my breasts - directly below them. I had to watch in the mirror because my view was obscured by my breasts. I should say, the view was obscured by my upper breasts. In only a few moments, I had gone from being relatively normal looking (albeit with large breasts) to suddenly having four breasts.<br />
I removed the strapless bra to get a closer look. They were indeed C-cup breasts - it seems they had taken up any spare elastic in the bra. I moved my chest back and forth, and could feel the weight of the four breasts moving as I did. The nipples on my lower breasts were slightly smaller than those of the upper breasts, though they looked very proportional.<br />
Amanda&#39;s breasts, which had always stolen the show from mine, now seemed dwarfed by my incredible display.<br />
I grabbed a t-shirt and threw it on. It was originally a little loose on me, but now hugged my upper breasts tightly. The shirt had been meant to sit closely around the ribs, and though my upper set of breasts pulled the shirt forward, if you looked closely you could see the curve of my lower set of breasts.<br />
I turned to Amanda, and with a gleam in my eye, said:<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go shopping!&quot;</p>
