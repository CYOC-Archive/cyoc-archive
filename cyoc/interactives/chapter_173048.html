<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day, Shannon swung by her friend Gina&#39;s house.  Gina Girardi was a slender Italian girl with a short bob of black hair and dark brown eyes.  When Shannon got there, Gina was lounging around the house in her nightgown, despite the fact it was already 11.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gigi, you&#39;re so lazy!&quot;  Shannon shook her head.  &quot;Aren&#39;t you going to get dressed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shannon, baby, it&#39;s Saturday, it&#39;s flu season, and everyone is still freaking about Covid.  Where would I go?&quot;  Gigi waved Shannon&#39;s protests off.  &quot;You&#39;re lucky I still live with my parents, or you&#39;d be lucky if I bothered to put on underwear!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re so bad, Gigi.&quot;  Shannon sighed.  &quot;I really need to talk to you, though.  I&#39;ve been having some...naughty thoughts, I guess, and I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s wrong with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gina leaned forward with interest.  &quot;You?  Naughty?  Miss Perfect?  I have to hear this!&quot;<br />
<br />
Shannon blushed.  &quot;Before I say anything, do you promise to take this seriously and not laugh at me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;May God take away my beautiful tits if I laugh at you.&quot;  Gigi grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh.&quot;  Shannon had been trying to avoid staring at Gina&#39;s chest.  Despite being shorter than she was by a good 4 inches, Gina had been blessed with a large and lovely pair of breasts the envy of every girl in school.  How someone who looked like she was a sandwich away from starvation could have D cups, she didn&#39;t know.  Worse, Gina came by her rack honestly- her mother was just as well endowed, and even though Mrs. Girardi was approaching 40, they barely even sagged!  &quot;Can we not talk about your breasts?&quot;<br />
<br />
In response, Gina opened up her robe dramatically, flashing her friend.  &quot;Unbeliever!  Heretic!  You deny the power of my bosom?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shannon&#39;s eyes got very large as she stared at Gina&#39;s breasts.  She blushed, feeling very warm as the wave of arousal hit her.  <br />
<br />
Gina noticed her interest.  &quot;Um, Shannon?  I was just joking, don&#39;t be upset.&quot;  She covered up.<br />
<br />
Shannon blinked and shook her head, as if to clear it.  &quot;Oh God...&quot;  She wanted to cry.  &quot;Gina...I think I&#39;m a lesbian.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gigi tilted her head to one side, giving Shannon the strangest look.  &quot;Seriously?  Shannon, baby, we&#39;ve been friends since we were six!  I don&#39;t even think I&#39;ve ever heard you admit to even liking a boy, let alone a girl.  Hell, I thought you were Ace or something!&quot;<br />
<br />
Shannon looked down, her eyes stinging as she started crying.  &quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong with me!  Yesterday, I couldn&#39;t stop looking at girls!  I was watching porn last night!  I masturbated twice, then again this morning!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gina got up an walked over to Shannon, sitting next to her on the loveseat.  She put her arms around her friend.  &quot;Shan, you silly bitch, only you would be upset about rubbing one out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shannon stiffened at her friend&#39;s touch.  She looked at Gigi, her eyes large and frightened.  &quot;This isn&#39;t...I mean...it&#39;s not me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you trying to say, that you magically turned into a lezzie or something?  These feelings didn&#39;t come from nowhere, baby.  How long has this been going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shannon squirmed a bit.  &quot;I don&#39;t know...I never felt this way before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, let&#39;s be honest, you&#39;re really damned repressed.  I didn&#39;t even know you knew how to masturbate!&quot;  Gigi grinned, but, true to her word, didn&#39;t so much as chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;...well, you bought me that vibrator for my birthday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As a joke!  But I&#39;m glad you actually used it.&quot;  Gina reached out to stroke Shannon&#39;s hair.<br />
<br />
Shannon made a purring sound as she closed her eyes, enjoying the feeling of having her hair touched.<br />
<br />
Gina raised an eyebrow.  Well, this was new!  Curiously, she touched the nape of Shannon&#39;s neck, a spot that she&#39;d always liked to have touched.<br />
<br />
Shannon shivered and let out a soft moan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit, you&#39;re really wound up!&quot;  Gina had always thought her friend was attractive, but she was starting to appreciate how sexy the taller girl could be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gigi...you better stop...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t want me to do that.&quot;  Gina was a sexually aggressive girl, and often acted provocatively towards other girls- this was mostly an act, to get a rise out of them, though she would readily admit if pressed that she was at least a little bit bi.  Right now though, presented with a girl she cared about, and had long thought was quite attractive, she was seriously considering moving past casual intimacy.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...but...if you don&#39;t...I&#39;ll...&quot;  Shannon moaned again as Gina leaned in close and licked her earlobe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do what?  Explode?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Gina&#39;s breath against her skin was making her feel so hot.  Even though she hadn&#39;t bathed yet, Shannon thought her friend smelled sexy.  She couldn&#39;t control her urges any longer!  Turning, she kissed Gina, and started pushing her down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah!  Stop!&quot; Gina gasped in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God!&quot;  Shannon jumped back.  &quot;I&quot;m sorry!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gina frowned.  She didn&#39;t mean to scare Shannon!  &quot;No, no.  You just surprised me, I&#39;m not used to you being aggressive, baby.  It&#39;s just I don&#39;t think we should do this here, in case my Mom comes home, do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...uh...&quot;  Shannon felt like her cheeks were on fire.<br />
<br />
&quot;So..let&#39;s go to my room.&quot;  Gina&#39;s eyes seemed to sparkle.<br />
<br />
&quot;...are you sure?&quot;  Shannon blinked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  Yeah I am.  Let&#39;s see how far this goes.&quot;  Her friend smiled.  &quot;But you have to do something for me, babe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Carry me.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God, you&#39;re so lazy!&quot;  But Shannon stood and scooped her friend up in her arms regardless.  Shannon exercised regularly, and this gave her great muscle tone, though she lacked bulk.  She marveled at how light her friend was!<br />
<br />
Gina lay her head against Shannon&#39;s chest, looking for all the world like a young bride being carried by her beau.  &quot;Oh this is nice.  To the bedroom, lover!&#39;<br />
<br />
Shannon did as commanded, setting Gigi gently on her bed before turning to lock the door.  The shades were drawn in Gina&#39;s room, as she always liked low light.  There was a healthy amount of clutter as always.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, use those amazon muscles of yours and slide the dresser in front of the door.  Just in case.&quot;  Gina commanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not an amazon, I&#39;m only 5&#39; 7&quot;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Taller than me.  With as much as you exercise, I&#39;m surprised you don&#39;t at least have some lady abs.&quot;  Gina had always thought girls with abs were hot, but she was too lazy to work out enough to get some, grateful that she at least had a flat tummy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom always said I shouldn&#39;t work out as much.&quot;  After moving Gina&#39;s dressed, Shannon turned, to find her friend already naked, laying on her bed in a seductive pose.  She was surprised not to find a dark patch of hair between her friend&#39;s thighs.  &quot;You shave?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell yeah I do.  I love the feel of smooth skin.  Don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shannon blushed as she got undressed, revealing that she was a natural redhead.  &quot;I was always scared to shave...there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You should have said something, I&#39;d have gladly helped you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shannon got on the bed next to her friend.  She was hesitant to touch Gina, despite the intense need she was feeling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just lay down, honey, I&#39;ll take point.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Shannon did as she was told, and soon Gina was straddling her waist, bending over to kiss her softly.  Acting on instinct, she put her hands on Gigi&#39;s butt, cupping her cheeks.  Despite being stacked on top, Gina had a very boyish ass.<br />
<br />
Gina made a soft growling noise, then started kissing Shannon&#39;s neck before moving to her clavicle.  Shannon had never really thought of a collarbone as an erogenous zone, but Gina&#39;s actions were making her feel really good.<br />
<br />
Gina put a hand on her friend&#39;s right breast.  Shannon was a little underdeveloped for her age, and rarely wore anything that would draw attention to her chest.  Gina rubbed the nipple firmly with her thumb, and was rewarded with more soft moans from her friend.  &#39;Oh God, this is fun!  I should have done this with a girl years ago!&#39;<br />
<br />
She continued to lavish her friend with attention for a bit, grinning.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Gigi...please...more...&quot;  Shannon pleaded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, baby.  I didn&#39;t mean to torture you.&quot;  Gina shifted back, and turned to the side.  Placing her right hand on Shannon&#39;s left breast, she idly stroked the taller girl&#39;s pelvis, eliciting a gasp from Shannon.  The flesh at the place where Shannon&#39;s hip connected to her pelvis was very interesting, and Gina wanted to play with that area more, but she didn&#39;t want to make her friend beg...not now, at least.<br />
<br />
So slowly, lazily, dragged her fingertips across the other girl&#39;s skin, until she encountered soft, downy hair.  Probing the area with her fingers, she pressed them down, finding Shannon&#39;s clit was already moist.  She rubbed at the area vigorously.  Shannon lost it, and Gina had to admit, she was pretty damn aroused herself.  Taking her right hand off the other girl&#39;s breast, she reached between her own legs.<br />
<br />
Shannon cupped her own breasts, kneading them, teasing the nipples with her thumbs just as Gina had.  &quot;More...more!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gina sighed.  This wasn&#39;t about her, after all.  She slid farther back, gently pushing Shannon&#39;s legs apart. She sniffed her fingers, and licked them curiously.  Excited at Shannon&#39;s scent and taste, she used her right hand to tease the girl&#39;s clit, while sliding a finger into her pussy.  Finding that it easily fit inside Shannon&#39;s body, she added a second finger, and started thrusting.<br />
<br />
Shannon&#39;s back arched and she moaned louder.  Gina was thankful her room was relatively soundproof- if her Mom did come home, odds were she wouldn&#39;t notice what was going on.  Not that Gina had a problem telling her Mother the truth, but Shannon would be mortified.<br />
<br />
She kept at her work, but suddenly Shannon&#39;s thighs bucked and she let out a whimper as she orgasmed.  Gina climbed up to cuddle with her friend.  She was pretty worked up now, but she could hold out a bit longer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gina..I love you.&quot;  Shannon&#39;s voice was soft and breathy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.  I&#39;m very lovable.&quot;  She kissed her friend&#39;s cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean it.  Will you be my girlfriend?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gina was taken aback.  Shannon was a little shy, reserved, and sexually repressed.  This was an entirely new facet to her personality...and one Gina found herself liking a lot.  &quot;Since you asked nicely, yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so happy.&quot;  Shannon winced a bit.  &quot;It hurts though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gina looked at her left hand.  There was blood on it.  &quot;Oh...fuck.  I&#39;m sorry baby, I forgot about my damn nails.  Uh...good news, you&#39;re not a virgin anymore?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot;  Shannon&#39;s eyes widened.  &quot;That means...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, gonna have to burn these sheets.  But I don&#39;t mind, as long as you&#39;re happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am.  So very much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great!  Then we can be lesbians together!&quot;  Gina giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gigi, you&#39;re not a lesbian.  I mean, I know you like to flirt, but..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh.  You&#39;re way sexier than any boy.  And I&#39;ve loved you for a long time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think I&#39;m sexier than a boy?&quot;  That was a good thing, right?<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes.&quot;  Gina pulled her friend into a kiss.  &quot;The only way you could be any sexier is if you had a dick.  But maybe your tongue is just as good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We should find out.&quot;  Shannon grinned lustily.</p>
