<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">All of a sudden, Bronwyn was running as fast as she could. Someone, or something, was chasing her - she had no idea what, but something told her that it wanted to steal her body from her. But as she tried to run, her legs suddenly went limp beneath her and she fell to the ground in a heap. She was still wearing the mascot suit! Bronwyn fumbled with the zipper and pulled it open, only to reveal another layer of fake fur underneath, sealed by another zipper. In frustration, she pulled at the next zipper, then the one underneath that, and another and another, until a deep, dark chasm was revealed that ran all the way through her body and somehow beyond it. She felt as if she was being sucked into the hole, falling endlessly through the infinite darkness of her hollow self-<br />
<br />
Bronwyn&#39;s eyes shot open and she sat up with a start. Shaking off the nightmare she had just woken from, she was confused to find herself lying on the hardwood floor of her bedroom, and found it even more strange that it was entirely comfortable for her to lie on the flat surface. Looking down at the coat of artificial fur that covered her body from head to toe, it took Bronwyn a long moment to remember which of the impossible things that had happened to her in the past 24 hours were part of her dream and which were real.<br />
<br />
Tentatively, Bronwyn held up a hand - or, rather, a stubby paw-like mitten - in front of her face and tried to flex her fingers, which could only manage a little wiggle. She put her hands on either side of her head and pushed them both inward. Despite the fact that her hands were soft lumps of stuffing now and could hardly muster much force, she could easily press her own head into a flatter shape, revealing that there couldn&#39;t be anything inside it but fluff. Okay, she reminded herself - as the adrenaline from her nightmare gradually receded from whatever she had now instead of veins - this is really happening. She was actually just a life-sized plush.<br />
<br />
The last thing she could remember that seemed vivid enough to be real, she was feverishly rubbing her featureless crotch, trying to relieve the intense erotic pleasure that becoming a giant stuffed animal had filled her with. She just kept getting hornier and hornier, with no way to release it or achieve climax. She could remember thinking to herself that if the feeling got any more intense, she was going to pass out. Considering that she couldn&#39;t remember anything after that, she must have proven herself right.<br />
<br />
But she couldn&#39;t stop herself from fixating on a slightly earlier memory, of the moment she first collected this suit. Maybe it was the nightmare that had changed her mind, or maybe it was the cruel irony that her greatest sexual fantasy had deprived her of sexual pleasure, but Bronwyn was wracked with guilt as she thought back on that woman at the zoo. In the moment, she had been too stunned by the fact that the magic had really worked to think about the consequences of her actions. And once she put the suit on - became the suit - she was so horny she couldn&#39;t think straight. Only now did it start to sink in that she had stolen another person&#39;s life - a person who was probably about to be reported missing, if she wasn&#39;t already.<br />
<br />
That thought was getting Bronwyn kind of flustered, too - a part of her wished she had been the one who was transformed against her will into some stranger&#39;s plaything. But she remembered the hours of frustration that came with getting aroused in this form and tried to focus. She could still fix this. First things first, she needed to get out of the suit and finally relieve the maddening heat that had built up inside her. If she could take care of that quickly, she could get back to the zoo just in time for them to open, and she could restore the mascot to her original form. No one would suspect a thing, she assured herself. Then Bronwyn could go online and commission someone to make her a more anatomically correct fursuit. She could hardly afford that sort of thing, admittedly, but she was willing to splurge on what would become her new body - maybe even permanently, if she was satisfied enough with it.<br />
<br />
Bronwyn took a deep breath, trying not to think too hard about the fact that she currently had no lungs to breathe with, and calmed herself. It took a few tries, but she was able to snag the zipper on her back against the seam of her fuzzy hand and pull. The spell broke, and she found herself simply wearing a suit again rather than being one. It was disappointing to see her own bare flesh again as she pulled the faux fur away, but at least now she knew she wasn&#39;t going to be a boring old human forever.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Returning to the same spot in the back hallways of the zoo building, Bronwyn looked back and forth nervously. The coast was clear. Quickly, she pulled the mascot suit out of her backpack and laid it on the concrete floor. With one swift motion, she pushed the zipper up into its closed position, then reached a finger behind the zipper and peeled it away from the fabric beneath. She didn&#39;t wait to see what would happen to the woman that had been inside it originally - as soon as the zipper was in hand, she was off like a rocket, desperately hoping that no one saw her.</p>
