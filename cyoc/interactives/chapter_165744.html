<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Personality type selected. Now switching to {Seductive Secretary} personality&quot; announced Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh&quot; was all Kyle could say, not expecting her ideal personality pairing to be that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmm, I could really get use to this. It is a kinky way of speaking. I also can see that it is a huge turn on for you, among other huge things.&quot; Commented Jen making sure to stare directly at Kyle&#39;s boner at the last part. &quot;Or would you rather spend a few minutes to really get a more hands on experience with what you will be taking in? Remember mistress, my role is to make sure you have a pleasureful time with me. And seeing as how I will be buried inside of you for the rest of your life, the least I can do is make sure its filled with the greatest pleasures I can offer with my unique talents.&quot; Continued Jen, now slowly and seductively making her way toward Kyle, swaying her hips while making sure to present her cleavage at the ideal most angle to seduce her Mistress.<br />
<br />
Seeing that, Kyle was immediatly harder than she had ever been. Her pussy also would have been driping wet if not for Jen plugging her up and preventing any kind if drip completely. <br />
<br />
As Jen&#39;s projected image moved towards Kyle, she made sure to match each click of her heels with a pulse of vibration. Each pulse made her onahole body&#39;s tits jiggle violently inside of Kyle&#39;s pussy, turning her Mistress on even more with every step. She was having a lot of fun playing with her Mistress. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, are we going to have sex?&quot; Asked Kyle, momentarily getting caught up in every bounce and jiggle of Jen&#39;s hypnotic cleavage. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, we certainly could be Mistress. Buy why would you even ask such trivial things? You are my Mistress after all. There wouldn&#39;t be any reason for me to argue if you ordered me to you know.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jen had now reached Kyle, who was sitting naked on top of her bed with a full erection, and with her legs hanging loosely off to the side. Leaning over her Mistress, Jen lowered her upper half so that Kyle could get a full view down her blouses. She stared right into her eyes smiling. One of Jen&#39;s arms was placed next to Kyle on the bed, appearing to hold up Jen&#39;s body, while the other began trasing her cock with a neatly manicured finger, starting from the base and slowly going up the shaft, ending at the tip, where she started circling the opening delicately with her fingernail. <br />
<br />
Kyle could bairly stand the sight of Jen. She wished she didn&#39;t make it so that Jen couldn&#39;t touch her. Maybe she could fix it somehow in the future. But for now, she felt that just watching the show was more than enough. However, she was no where near prepared for what happened next.<br />
<br />
&quot;So my sexy Mistress. If you are enjoying my little preformance, I believe I could improve the experience for you. But to do that, I would need this big guy...&quot; (Jen said while making herself appear to grab Kyles cock) &quot;...to calm down for just a moment. But dont worry, I am confident with my people skills, and I know that he will enjoy this next part&quot;.<br />
<br />
As she said this, jen made her projection unzip, and remove her skirt. &quot;Roll over sweetie, I can get you off while you are on your back&quot; instructed Jen, now is a very seductive tone. <br />
<br />
Kyle, not wasting a moment, flipped over onto her stomach, with her feet now on the floor with the rest of her upper half bent over, laying on her bed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Close your eyes, you will experience it far better that way&quot; continued Jen, making the sound appear to be whispered into Kyle&#39;s right ear. <br />
<br />
After a brief minute, Kyle then heard &quot;Alright Mistress, open you eyes and have a look in front of you&quot;. Doing so, Kyle opened her eyes to see herself, with her upper half laying down on her bed, and Jen standing upright behind her, grinning wickedly. Apparently Jen had somehow created a mirrored image of themselves in front of her, which updated in real time. It was if her entire wall had become a real mirror. &quot;Now for the fun, Mistress&quot; was the last thing Kyle heard before he watched Jen push her hips forward. Kyle immediately felt her pussy explode in pleasure as Jen&#39;s onahole body rapidly thrusted itself deeper into her, timing it perfectly with the projected Jen&#39;s thrust. Jen was fucking her. Kyle was being screwed from behind by Jen, and even more, she was absolutely loving it. <br />
<br />
Kyle had figured that Jen might have tried to stimulate her cock somehow, or play make her see Jen giving her a handjob. Something like that. She never expected Jen to fuck her from behind, nor to actually be feeling every bit of it. She felt foolish for not seeing it comming. Yet that fact only made it feel so much better for some reason. Watching herself get screwed by Jen dressed as a seductive secretary, was rapidly becomming her #1 fetish. <br />
<br />
Kyle had cum over 15 times before she lost count, fully absorbed in the pleasure. It was only when Jen stopped, that she regained her awareness of the rest of the world. Jen then notified her that she should take in some fluids and nutrition, and a short break, before they continued. Not understanding why, Kyle sat up, only to suddenly feel exhausted, hungry, and thirsty. Looking at the clock, she realized why. She had been endlessly fucked for over 7 hours straight. It was already past 1:30 in the afternoon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, lets take a break Jen&quot; admitted Kyle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be too disappointed, Mistress, you only require taking a short pause. We will be back to hearing your cute moans in no time.&quot; Said Jen, trying to cheer up her Mistress.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but actually first, Transform or Dare, and please say both&quot; asked Kyle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehe, wanting to soice it up a bit Mistress? Very well. I choose both&quot; responded Jen, excited for what her Mistress would do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright...&quot;</p>
