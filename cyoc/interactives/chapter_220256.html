<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Here&#39;s what I can remember from the past little while.<br />
<br />
I remember my breasts expanding so that they filled up my cell. The alarm blared, and I found myself being squeezed flat against the cold concrete. The pressure from my breasts was indescribable - there was no pain, though I do recall it being harder and harder to breath. But my breasts pressed into my body tighter and tighter. I could feel the growth pulsing and squeezing into every little crevice. And I remember feeling the sensations of the walls - made of concrete thick enough that the people keeping me here probably hadn&#39;t considered this could be possible - as they began to crack. I think I may have passed out from the pressure at one point, only to come to, my body shuddering from the sudden release in pressure and the surge of orgasmic sensations it sent through me. My legs were unresponsive, quivering like crazy from the nonstop orgasmic sensations the growth had sent through me.<br />
<br />
It hadn&#39;t taken long to fill up the next bit, and for the process to start all over again - getting pressed against the ceiling, feeling my breasts squish against me, to the point where I could feel them pulsing against my sopping wet vagina (and the sensation of my own tits pressing up so firmly against my own clit was mind-blowing). <br />
<br />
And then more walls broke. And my breasts continued to grow, to fill up the facility. When they&#39;d destroyed several rooms, it didn&#39;t take nearly as much time to break additional walls - the mass of my tits was beginning to outclass whatever thickness of concrete they&#39;d used.<br />
<br />
I was beyond speech as the growth went on. At a certain point, I realized that the facility had been completely destroyed - and that it must have been underground, because now there was dirt pressing all around me. It wasn&#39;t nearly as resistive as the concrete, and so my growth continued uninterrupted. <br />
<br />
And then, suddenly, there was sunlight. And I realized my body was at an angle. The sensation of the sun on my skin - my vast expanse of skin at this point - felt incredible. <br />
<br />
Again, I was only most aware as my body burst out of the mountain the facility had been buried in. And as enough of my breasts began to squish their way out, I felt the center of my mass begin to tip, and soon, they were rolling down the mountain, resulting in an absolutely toe-curling, vision-going white, screaming at the top of your lungs burst of pleasure. Even as they rolled and bounced their way down the mountain, settling between two mountains, I could feel my pussy practically vibrating from the nonstop orgasms. <br />
<br />
Eventually they came to a rest between several mountains. Maybe the pleasure had an effect on the rate of growth, because it felt as though the growth had accelerated - they were quickly beginning to match the size of the mountains around me. I was no longer perched atop them, but rather, dangling from the side of them. I could see the ground below me, my feet hanging beneath me in the empty air; I could see the juices running down my leg and dripping below. I could feel the sensations of rocks being crushed, of trees being snapped into sawdust. <br />
<br />
And...eventually...it was just...just white noise. <br />
<br />
I closed my eyes. And lost myself to the sensations.<br />
<br />
And that brings us to now.<br />
<br />
A very curious now.<br />
<br />
When I wake up, I&#39;m lying flat on my back. I blink awkwardly up at the sky - it&#39;s still light out, but it seems like it&#39;s dimmer, and I can&#39;t see the sun.<br />
<br />
And it occurs to me I can&#39;t see my breasts either.<br />
<br />
I look down - they&#39;ve gone down once again. I have no idea how long I was there. But in directions all around me, I can see the evidence of my growth spurt. Trees are uprooted or flattened - spreading out in a circle from where I&#39;m lying now. The sides of the mountains around me have been caved in, resulting in an odd looking double crater. A boob sized crater - from breasts that had obviously grown large enough to dwarf the mountains. Man...that would&#39;ve been larger than I was back in the city. Does that mean - is it getting worse?<br />
<br />
I sit up and hug my legs to my chest.<br />
<br />
God. <br />
<br />
That had been...intense.<br />
<br />
But...<br />
<br />
I was free? <br />
<br />
Fucking yay? Maybe? <br />
<br />
I had no idea if they&#39;d swoop in and try to capture me again. Or try to put me back in some hidden facility. Or just try to kill me. <br />
<br />
None of the options sounded great. <br />
<br />
And who knew how long my current size would last? How long would it be before my breasts were growing out of control again? Would it just keep happening, getting bigger and bigger until...what? How big could I get? <br />
<br />
No upper limit.<br />
<br />
Shit...<br />
<br />
That can&#39;t be...that can&#39;t be true.<br />
<br />
And then my breasts begin to surge forward with the burst of anxiety, and I let out a frustrated moan.<br />
<br />
It takes a lot of effort...but I manage to - pardon the pun - calm my tits - and by the time it&#39;s night, I&#39;m mobile once more. I kinda doubt there&#39;s any wildlife too nearby - my uh, explosive moments before would&#39;ve either crushed them or sent any nearby predators fleeing.<br />
<br />
I hope.<br />
<br />
But I set out. I want to get out of the area before they come looking. If they come looking.<br />
<br />
I wonder where my mom is. Was she in the facility? Or had she perished back in the city?<br />
<br />
Hell, where in the world was I? How remote was this area?<br />
<br />
I had no way of knowing. No cell phone, no map. Shit, no clothes aside from these ruined panties. <br />
<br />
None of it mattered for the moment, I told myself. <br />
<br />
So I set out. I did my best to stay calm and see if I could find something. Find help. <br />
<br />
Hours pass. The moon and stars are bright enough that I don&#39;t have too much trouble seeing. And I find myself not worrying too much about predators. If one shows up, the anxiety from that would probably be enough to cause a growth surge anyway, and what the fuck is a bear gonna do against mountain sized tits? Maybe I should become a superhero. The Mighty Boob! Don&#39;t you dare rob that bank or I&#39;ll grow and trap you in my cleavage! Beware, evil doers! <br />
<br />
Nah. The criminals would probably like that. They&#39;d want to get caught. Fuckin&#39; pervs. Ugh! <br />
<br />
Great, I just grossed myself out with my own thoughts. <br />
<br />
The sky is beginning to get light again when I begin to notice signs of life. I see what seems like a bit of light in the distance, so I start to head in that direction. And as I get closer, I can see what seems to be a small town...though who knows what state this even is, or if this is even the states at all. <br />
<br />
But as I get closer to the small town...I stop.<br />
<br />
And think about this.<br />
<br />
What in the holy fuck am I thinking?? I can&#39;t go here! I can&#39;t do this again!<br />
<br />
What are the odds anyone here will be able to help me? And what...what would happen to them if I started growing again, if I lose control? I can&#39;t do that to these people. They haven&#39;t done anything to me. And I&#39;m...<br />
<br />
Shit, I&#39;m dangerous! Legitimately dangerous! <br />
<br />
If I go there, I&#39;d be putting them at risk.<br />
<br />
I want nothing more than to go down there and ask for help, to ask where I am.<br />
<br />
But...<br />
<br />
No. Shit! The army people were right, weren&#39;t they? I&#39;m too much of a risk. I hadn&#39;t even planned to break out. My tits had just decided, alright, enough of this, we gotta grow. And I was just along for the ride. All those lessons in control had been worthless once they picked up steam. <br />
<br />
Fucking ray-guns and their stupid beams that cause stupid breast expansion...<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit!&quot;<br />
<br />
I let out a scream and stumble back, my hands flying up to cover my tits. <br />
<br />
There&#39;s a girl, maybe not too much older than me, staring at me with wide eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god! Are you okay?&quot; she asks, eyes growing wider. &quot;Oh my god! You poor thing - we need to get you into town-- are you hurt? Jesus! You&#39;re like - you&#39;re almost naked! And you - have you been out here in the woods, alone, like that?? Holy shit! Are you okay?&quot; She begins to come towards me.<br />
<br />
I take a step back. &quot;Wait!&quot; I shout. &quot;Stop! Don&#39;t! Don&#39;t get any closer!&quot;<br />
<br />
She holds up her hands. &quot;Okay, okay! What is it? What&#39;s the matter? Please! I just wanna help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where did you even come from??&quot; I demand. Shit, shit...my heart is racing...I can feel the sensations rising...fight it Bronwyn, fight it...no...I can feel...the growth is slow, but I can feel it...pushing against my hands...I wince slightly, looking down. Calm down, calm down, calm down...don&#39;t do this, don&#39;t hurt her, don&#39;t make me hurt anyone else, please, please...<br />
<br />
She points to a nearby tree, and it&#39;s only at that point that I notice a sizable tree house up in the tree. Like, it looks like a decent sized place - I guess it helps when the trees themselves are pretty big. &quot;I come out here when I wanna be alone and think and - never mind all that, fuck where I came from, what happened to you?? Seriously, are you okay? What&#39;s...you alright?&quot; She narrows her eyes, and I can see her frowning as she looks down at my chest. She tilts her head slightly - can she notice them growing? I&#39;m trying really hard to get this under control...I really don&#39;t want to her this girl. The growth seems to be slowing, but there&#39;s now a noticeable handful of boobs that I&#39;m holding instead of a flat chest. &quot;Did someone do this to you??&quot; she demands suddenly. &quot;Like...was a guy doing this to you??? Did he just...did someone fucking strip you and take you out in the woods and like you escaped or some shit?&quot; She looks spitting mad now. &quot;I swear, I will grab my granddaddy&#39;s shotgun--!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; I said. &quot;No. Look...I&#39;m...don&#39;t!&quot; The girl frowns at me, coming to a stop. &quot;Please...&quot; I&#39;m so fucking tired. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not going to hurt you,&quot; she says in a lower voice. &quot;I promise. Okay? I won&#39;t hurt you. It&#39;s okay. You&#39;re safe. Please. It&#39;s not safe out here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just...don&#39;t. Don&#39;t come near me.&quot; Tears begin to fall down my face. &quot;You&#39;re right that it&#39;s not safe. I&#39;m dangerous.&quot;<br />
<br />
To put it mildly, she looks doubtful. She crosses her arms. &quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
You shake your head. &quot;It&#39;s true!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look - where did <i>you</i> even come from? You look familiar...are you out from Dugan? Or Suncrest? We felt that earthquake, were you like...did you have to evacuate? It was pretty scary, everything shaking like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; I whisper. Hearing her talk about that...about an earthquake...so they&#39;d felt my tumbling...probably felt the shock from my impact with the earth. What would people think when they went to go investigate only to find debris of some facility and two boob-shaped craters in the middle of the mountain range? With all those flattened trees. It&#39;d be hard to cover up. The girl is still staring at me, so I wipe away at my tears and then continue on in a louder voice. &quot;That earthquake - that wasn&#39;t an earthquake. I-it was me.&quot; I shake my head. &quot;Look. I...I gotta get out of here. Before more people get hurt. Before you get hurt...&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl frowns and steps forward. &quot;Look - what&#39;s your name anyhow? I&#39;m Hannah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Bronwyn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That...sounds familiar too. Where the heck do I know you from?&quot;<br />
<br />
I let out a sigh. I have to get away from her...but...it&#39;s nice to actually talk to someone. I feel a bit ridiculous standing here like this though, covering my tits and hoping they don&#39;t start growing again. They&#39;ve mostly gone down now, but not all the way. I&#39;m tired. I&#39;m hungry. It&#39;s hard to maintain focus.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know how long it&#39;s been exactly...were there news reports about a city getting...uhhh...kinda...flattened...by...by...y&#39;know...&quot;<br />
<br />
Hannah rolls her eyes. &quot;You mean the poor girl that destroyed half a city cause of her tits? Yeah! Everyone saw that. It was on the news for months. There was never really an explanation for that...but...that footage was some of the most viewed on Earth! That poor girls tits growing so large that they smashed up her whole neighborhood...the idea that such a thing could ever happen...&quot; Hannah trailed off, squinting at you. &quot;Wait...&quot; she adds. &quot;Holy shit. That&#39;s - that&#39;s where I know you from. That name from! That was you! Wasn&#39;t it?!&quot;<br />
<br />
I nod. &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit!&quot; she breathed. &quot;Girl...&quot; She looks at me, and for a moment, I can see a tinge of fear enter her eyes for the first time. She bites her lip, looks away, and then looks back at me, resolutely.  &quot;Well, you seem normal enough now...save for the fact that you&#39;re half naked in the woods. Seriously, if you come with me, I can get you some clothes...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Please! I&#39;m still - it&#39;s still...dangerous. Were you not listening? That - that wasn&#39;t an earthquake, it was me! My tits were growing out of control, and I tumbled down a mountain - there&#39;s like - a fucking crater where I was growing - I have no idea why they were growing or... fuck!&quot; I can feel them beginning to plump up again. Hannah notices, and her eyes go wide, but she doesn&#39;t run. &quot;Shit...see? They&#39;re fucking...they&#39;ve got a mind of their own sometimes! So yeah - that wasn&#39;t an earthquake, that was me! I&#39;m dangerous! And me? You wanna know where I&#39;ve been? Well, I was in some kinda prison! The government was like...they managed to reverse it that first time. Sorta. But there was some complications. They had me in a facility. They were trying to figure out how to make the growth stopped. If...when I get worked up...they grow again, like now...god damn it, stop!&quot; I stand still for a moment, trying to calm my breathing. Please...please...okay...it&#39;s slowing...calm your mind...don&#39;t get upset...just breathe. Okay. I blink a few times, and let out a breath. &quot;And I guess...all their tests...maybe it was too much. They grew their way out of that facility. And then I ended up here. I was gonna go for help but...I can&#39;t risk doing this again. Not in a populated area. So. I&#39;m sorry. Just...pretend you never saw me. I&#39;ll go in another direction. And hope I get far enough away that if it happens again, you won&#39;t be hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And do what?&quot; Hannah demands. I realize there&#39;s tears on her face. &quot;Fuck the government,&quot; she says plainly. &quot;For what they did to you. Jesus Bronwyn, that sounds like a nightmare...you what...just wanna go off on your own? Fuck that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; I whisper. &quot;Find somewhere to just...not be around people...not put anyone in danger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus Christ,&quot; Hannah says, shaking her head. &quot;I&#39;m sorry all that happened to you. How did that even...no, that&#39;s not important right now. But shit, I got so many questions. I had nightmares about it after seeing it. About it happening to me. A lot of girls probably did. And I felt so bad for her - er, well, for you. There wasn&#39;t a whole lotta footage of you up close, but...you just looked so sad...and I don&#39;t know what the whole thing was...some kinda radiation accident, I think one channel said? Whatever. Either way, it couldn&#39;t have been your fault. And then you just vanished, and no one was saying anything. Whatever. You can answer my questions later. You look real tired there girl - and you&#39;re scraped up, you&#39;re practically naked, you&#39;re shaking...I can&#39;t let you just...what kinda gal would I be if I let you just wander off like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hannah, you&#39;re not getting it - I&#39;m dangerous! I&#39;ve hurt people...I don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on with me...&quot; Great, here come the tears again. &quot;You seem really nice, and I don&#39;t want to hurt you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hannah throws out her arms and scoffs. &quot;Bronwyn - I ain&#39;t taking no for an answer. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on with you - with your whole situation there...guess that explains why I could&#39;ve sworn you were uh, bigger up top a moment ago...but...look. Let me help you. Please! I can&#39;t just - I can&#39;t let you go off on your own. I want to help. I&#39;m not saying you gotta stay. But let me get you some food, some clothes...access to a phone, whatever you want. Alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
I stand there, staring at her. It sounds amazing. <br />
<br />
But...can I really put her in danger like that? I&#39;ve been pushing off the thought for as long as I can...but...some people had to have been hurt when I grew so expansively in the city right? Or even in the facility? Did everyone have time to get out? People may have actually died because of my tits. What a ridiculous sentence that is - but - it might be true regardless. This girl is nice - and definitely hot - but...I can&#39;t just...she could get hurt. The entire town could get destroyed. <br />
<br />
I can&#39;t let her kindness lead to their downfall. <br />
<br />
Can I?<br />
<br />
I&#39;m so tired. And hungry. And lonely. <br />
<br />
Hannah puts her hands on her hips. &quot;I ain&#39;t taking no for an answer. I&#39;ll follow you all over these damn mountains if I have to, shaking hospitality at you the whole way. It&#39;ll be your fault if I end up getting lost in the woods trailing after you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Christ,&quot; I mutter. &quot;Look...Hannah...you&#39;re really, really sweet...&quot;</p>
