<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;First up, some in-depth measurements of the clothing gun - would both of you please stand on the marked spots? Thanks - now testing: wardrobe changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roy lifts the same gun from yesterday and shoots a ray at both of you in quick succession.<br />
The result is less sparks than yesterday, but both you and Dave find yourself wearing a dress with a cute floral pattern - much to the tired worker&#39;s chagrin.<br />
Before he can complain though, the trigger gets pulled again, and you both find yourself wearing a three-piece suit, complete with tie and dress pants, perfectly tailored to fit your respective bodies.<br />
A few minutes later, you&#39;ve gone through a cloth&#39;s store worth of  outfits, and Roy seems very happy with the results.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, now returning to original state.&quot;<br />
You want to protest, but the mouse already pulled the trigger, leaving you with the exact outfit you had before the gun hit you the first time - nothing, except the jewelry on your body.<br />
With a squeak, you quickly cover yourself, and it&#39;s a good thing you have a big, fluffy tail, because covering both boobs with one arm is quite the ask at your size.<br />
Meanwhile, Roy apparently didn&#39;t think to check the results before moving on to blast Dave, who looks a bit apprehensive after seeing your clothes disappear, but his outfit just reverts to the slightly stained clothes he wore earlier.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Roy finally looks at you and blushes.<br />
&quot;Oh- my apologies, miss, I forgot your current outfit came from the gun as well, please help yourself to your previous outfit&quot; - he motions at the gaudy underwear you wore yesterday - &quot;those actually changed slightly during the night, and an upcoming test was verifying whether they did so in order to still fit you after your changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
You make your displeasure known with a grunt, and walk over to slip back into your old &quot;outfit&quot; - which still fits you as well as it did ever since it got upgraded yesterday. Apparently whatever effect changed it into its current form also made it so it always fit you perfectly as well.<br />
You&#39;d tell Roy about your observations, but he seems to be distracted by an empty spot surrounded by more measuring equipment.<br />
&quot;Interesting - apparently reverting your outfit also destroyed the set of pants you left behind yesterday! They did come from the gun as well, but they never got hit by the beam... I wonder if the gun&#39;s clothes are somehow linked to whoever wears them - more to look into later, once I figure out how to measure this.&quot;<br />
<br />
He turns to you. &quot;Ah, I see you didn&#39;t have any issues with your clothes, and they still seem to fit you perfectly, yes? Good - this means they probably changed whenever you did. More to explore if we ever manage to get your shape changed again. Anyway - Dave, may I do some more outfit-based testing with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave shrugs. &quot;Sure, not like I have much of a choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then gets zapped and is then instructed to take off his changed clothes, which he protests, but they manage to compromise and he&#39;ll only have to go shirtless when he&#39;s hit with the &quot;revert&quot; setting.<br />
Interestingly enough, the clothes he took off turn back into his old clothes, and he&#39;s still half-naked, so he quickly puts them back on again.<br />
Further testing reveals that layers of clothing roughly correspond to each other - with the caveat that extra layers and new articles of clothing only matter if they&#39;re a significant part of whichever layer they&#39;re in - and that the original clothes seem to be part of whatever you take off first - zapping another full set of clothes onto you won&#39;t make you any more dressed upon reverting, and even removing multiple sets of extra clothes won&#39;t make you any more naked if you slip back into your first set either.<br />
According to Roy, this might indicate that the gun simply transforms whatever matter is around you into the clothes you&#39;re about to wear, so any extra set originally was air, and turns back into it as a result.<br />
<br />
After that series of tests, you are asked to try and use your transformation power again, which predictably fails, and Roy then hands you the same ray gun you used yesterday, complete with the sensor on it.<br />
It feels a bit off, but you aim it at the scientist, pull the trigger, and as expected, a ray hits him and he&#39;s turned back into the human he was yesterday.<br />
However, a massive spike of exhaustion overcomes you - much worse than yesterday - making your knees buckle, and your vision even goes black around the corners, so you quickly sit down, and then lie on the floor until you slowly feel better again.<br />
<br />
While Roy is mostly busy inspecting himself to see if he&#39;s truly back to being himself, Dave comes over to you, looking concerned.<br />
&quot;Hey, you alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh - okay-ish - I almost fainted. Really tired now...&quot;<br />
<br />
He kneels down and grabs your shoulders. &quot;Come on, stay awake - don&#39;t wanna find out how hard you&#39;ll crash until we can keep you healthy, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
You try your best to stay awake, but for the moment, it&#39;s not that hard, as Dave tries to get the attention of his colleague: &quot;ROY! GET THE FUCK OVER HERE, SHE ALMOST FAINTED!&quot; <br />
<br />
You hear some footsteps along with Roy&#39;s voice: &quot;Apologies, I wanted to see if you cou-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up, explanations come later, fix her - where&#39;s our first aid stuff again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, right - they should be over there, with the rest of the equipment, but-&quot; Dave quickly gets up and runs off while Roy continues, &quot;-I just might be able to fix this.&quot;<br />
<br />
You hear a click, and feel a nice, warm tingling all over your body, and figure this is how cats feel while basking in the sun - warm, calm and relaxed.<br />
In fact, just like a cat, you start rolling around to get all of your body warmed up, and only after you hear Dave return, you open your eyes again to see him standing there with a first aid kit under his arm staring at something behind you.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck are you doing? Why are you trying out more dangerous shit on someone who&#39;s almost unconscious?&quot;<br />
<br />
You hear Roy from behind you. &quot;Well, we already know she absorbs morphogenic radiation, and since that last, unassisted beam dropped her energy levels, allowing her to absorb more would restore her again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave looks unimpressed. &quot;U-huh, and what if that absorption actually takes more energy to start? What if it doesn&#39;t replenish whatever&#39;s missing right away? Heck, you ever tried eating a full meal while you&#39;re tired after work? Doesn&#39;t exactly wake you right back up, now does it?&quot;<br />
<br />
He continues venting his anger at Roy, who, to his credit, quickly realizes he jumped to conclusions and sounds rather humbled.<br />
All the while, the warm feeling never stops, and once you feel a bit better, you sit back up and stretch your arms, interrupting the one-sided conversation.<br />
As you sit up, you finally see the source of that nice feeling - as you expected, it&#39;s yet another transformation ray gun, but instead of emitting a focused beam, the rays spread out a bit, like on a decent flashlight, or a car&#39;s headlights. Judging by the brightness of the emitter, and the fact that it&#39;s affixed to a trolley, it seems to be heavy-duty model, probably with a higher power output as well.<br />
<br />
Roy quickly shuts off the beam, and both men come closer, asking if you&#39;re alright.<br />
<br />
You nod, &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m feeling much better now, thanks! I&#39;d definitely be down for another round with that machine, but I think I&#39;m fine now.&quot;<br />
<br />
You try to stand up, but they motion for you to stay seated. &quot;Dave, could you go bring a chair over - I&#39;ll take her vitals for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave sets down the first-aid kit and leaves, while Roy talks to you while trying to measure your pulse.<br />
&quot;Again, my sincerest apologies - while I did intentionally hand you the gun without the battery, I clearly didn&#39;t expect that providing the full charge would take that much out of you. For now, please take it easy for a bit while we monitor you some more - any further tests involving any energy expenditure on your part will be postponed, and please tell me immediately if you start feeling exhausted again.&quot;<br />
<br />
He looks over at Dave, who returned with a simple folding chair. &quot;Thank you, please put it down next to her.&quot;<br />
He looks at you again. &quot;Alright, now whenever you feel ready, try to stand up and sit down in the char - take your time, there&#39;s nothing worse in these circumstances than standing up before your body is ready for the extra strain and actually passing out. Here, if you want you can take my hand if that makes it easier.&quot;<br />
<br />
You slowly stand up, and then quickly sit down in the chair.<br />
You don&#39;t feel too bad, and tell the two men as much, but they insist on you resting for at least ten more minutes, so you sit back and try to relax some more while you can see the two of them slowly getting more relaxed as well.</p>
