<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Well, Liam looked really fucking different. And as of now dressed in just a pair of shorts, tight as could be, and no shirt.<br />
<br />
Despite voicing concerns about it being a scam, Liam had obviously seen something that changed his mind considering he looked like he had really packed on some size...on top of some other changes that kind of made Max tilt his head a little bit.<br />
<br />
While it took Max all the way until the next morning to see the changes come in, evidently it took far less time for the two doses Liam had imbibed to do their work on him: Liam was about six foot four inches tall now, easily 5 or 6 inches taller than he usually was. Max was at awe of how Liam had changed, the grinning muscle man at the door was outright bigger than Max in several ways, his abs almost inhumanly sculpted and obliques toned to an incredible point. He almost had an eight pack going on with the way he looked. Liam&#39;s shoulders were incredibly broad and very well toned, leading down to 20 inch biceps and triceps that pressed out in an insane horseshoe like form. <br />
<br />
Liam&#39;s pecs were however easily the standout, even as Max found himself admiring Liam&#39;s powerful, tree trunk like legs. Though the newly grown man&#39;s chest almost looked too pronounced. They jutted like no other pecs Max had seen, powerfully built and simply huge, each individual part to the pectoral equally toned, though it seemed his nipples protruded in an obvious way. Man, Max swore, he could probably balance a quarter on Liam&#39;s ass easily. Leading down to that was a prominent &quot;arrow&quot; from his wide, strong back.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like what you see, buddy?&quot; Liam said in a teasing tone, pumping his mighty arms and then displaying his pecs in a wide flex. Damn, Liam looked different. His jawline was strong and angular, his hair seemed thicker and now more wavy, even his tan seemed deeper and better done...but there was something else. Something that made Max tilt his head.<br />
<br />
Usually, Liam was a pretty hairy fucker. Hence why he was usually pretty shy about taking off his shirt at the beach. But now, it seemed that the hair covering Liam&#39;s upper body had decreased in amount rather than increased. His jawline was clean of any stubble, and his hair was more sparse across his chest and abdomen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I can appreciate it if that&#39;s what you&#39;re asking,&quot; Max said, looking Liam over, &quot;But what changed your mind on it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I looked into your room to check on you - and I saw how you were looking,&quot; Liam said with a grin, &quot;So I figured - if one little drink got you looking this fucking good, how about two drinks for little old me?&quot; Liam flexed his arm again and said, &quot;Well, I bulked up like fuck, and now you&#39;ve got a lot more of an impressive roommate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What clothes are you gonna wear though? You DID bulk up a lot...&quot; Max cupped his chin, realizing the fact that Liam probably hadn&#39;t thought this over. Another thing occurred to him, &quot;Well, there&#39;s that, and how did this stuff affect you so fast? I thought it---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably some variance with the substance,&quot; Liam shrugged, &quot;I&#39;m not looking this gift horse in the mouth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Though Max saw something seemed up with his buddy&#39;s physique, particularly in a few areas, he had no idea what that might be leading up to. So for now he just stated, &quot;Just be careful with any more usage of this stuff. I mean, we don&#39;t know what in all it can really do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We know it made you and me into fucking gods among men.&quot; Liam gloated - the feeling of being really, truly <i>big</i> for the first time in his life was almost...intoxicating. Especially when it came out of nowhere like this. If there was any chance of him losing this or being outshined, he wanted to make sure he maintained his edge. For right now he was bigger than Max in a number of places. And Liam liked that - quite a lot at that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just be careful, okay?&quot; Max said with a shrug. He didn&#39;t know what to be careful of, but he just knew there had to be something going on. Ah well, he figured he could watch as things went on. &quot;So, you wanna do anything with the new body, Liam?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad you asked, my friend. First and foremost, I&#39;ll give you some cash for new clothes - then I&#39;ll look into some parties.&quot; Liam smirked, &quot;Should be fun to hit up the party circuit, maybe even dose while I&#39;m on the floor.&quot; Max nodded along, he himself was eager to get back out there on the party circuit, and with his new body he knew he&#39;d be a hit. He just worried that Liam was gonna push himself too far with these dosages...<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Liam handed Max some money and then leaned back against the wall, &quot;I&#39;m gonna need some new clothes, and I&#39;ll go ahead and reserve our party for the evening tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Max started to head out, thinking about what to do from here. There was little argument that Liam was probably in a power high. He&#39;d never been a particularly powerful or impressive guy. But now that he was looking and sounding like this, it seemed Liam was interested in making up for lost time. Max didn&#39;t particularly like how Liam was bigger than him, but he didn&#39;t want to just fall into using this stuff like Liam did. He cupped his chin...</p>
