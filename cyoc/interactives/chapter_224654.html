<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After taking a quick shower I came down to the kitchen to grab a bite. John was already sitting on the table and Mariah was warming up some spaghetti leftovers from last night.<br />
Both seemed to have cleaned up and changed clothes<br />
<br />
“Do you want to eat too?” Mariah turned her head to look at me and asked<br />
<br />
“Yes, please” I responded and sat at the table<br />
<br />
John was happily munching off some garlic bread, part of yesterday’s leftovers as well, he gave a big grin and waved his hand<br />
<br />
“Hey John, how are you feeling?” I was feeling pretty good myself and I wanted to know if John was experiencing the similar changes<br />
<br />
“ Ohh, very good. I feel happy and the world seems more colorful”<br />
<br />
“Wow, does cumming feel that good for you?” Mariah interjected<br />
<br />
“It’s not just a normal orgasm, it’s the body synchronization thing that I was talking about before… before we started to have fun” I blushed a little bit when I responded.<br />
<br />
“Ooo, right, I remember, so how is it?” she said as she put the pot filled with spaghetti in the table<br />
<br />
“It is difficult to explain, I feel more comfortable and confident, my body kind of moves better and my senses feel sharper, just a little bit, but it’s noticeable.”<br />
<br />
“That sounds impressive” she responded “But, maybe you should go to the facility for a quick check up before classes start, just to make sure that nothing wrong is happening” <br />
<br />
“Maybe we should” I said and started to helping myself with a serving of spaghetti and some garlic bread<br />
<br />
We started to eat in silence. It was not awkward, but something needed to be said, so I took the initiative to speak.<br />
<br />
“So, what are we doing about the situation of us having sex?”<br />
<br />
“That felt really good, can we do it again some other day?” John excitedly asked<br />
<br />
“I enjoyed it too” I replied “but I want it to be a one time thing, I just don’t want to have a complicated relationship with you two”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?” he asked puzzledly<br />
<br />
“mmm” I tried to think of a way to explain the complexity of this issue “you know how babies are made, right? when a boy puts his penis inside a girl&#39;s pussy…”<br />
<br />
“yeah” he said and quickly looked at Mariah&#39;s stomach expecting to immediately swell “wait, is Mariah going to have a baby?”<br />
<br />
“Umm, no, remember that we used protection?” Mariah said “I am not going to have a baby. We just had sex to have fun, not to start a family”<br />
<br />
Between Mariah and I, we explained to John why blood related siblings should not have babies together and the fact that because we had new bodies we weren’t actually blood related, but even so, relationships between not blood related siblings were kind of morally ambiguous as well” <br />
<br />
“So, did we do something wrong or not?” asked John somewhat confused<br />
<br />
“That is why I said it is complicated, honestly I don’t feel we did something wrong, but if our parents were to know we had sex, they may become angry, or sad, or maybe they wouldn’t care, but I think it&#39;s better to keep it secret. You know what they said, out of sight, out of mind.”<br />
<br />
“Ok” he answered “but, does that mean we won&#39;t do something like that again?” he asked a bit sad<br />
<br />
“While Dahlia don’t want to, I can have fun with you from time to time” Mariah said somewhat embarrassed <br />
<br />
I looked at her in surprise, but it was not difficult to see why Mariah would like to continue to have sex with John. He was a handsome, and muscular hunk, there where not many guys as sexy as him<br />
John blushed and grinned happily, and began to shove pasta in his mouth<br />
<br />
“Ok, just remember to use protection and keep it secret, we just had the body swap two months ago and I don’t want to have more drama to deal with.<br />
<br />
My sister gave me a one side hug and we continued eating<br />
<br />
“By the way, we need to clean my bedsheets after eating” Mariah reminded “they are kind of damp and smelling like cunt right now, for something so small, you sure spray a lot of juice Dahlia”<br />
<br />
I blushed a little remembering the ridiculous amounts of vaginal fluid that I produced while excited and how much I squirted<br />
<br />
“Ah, actually, I need to wash my sheets too.” I said embarrassed. <br />
 <br />
                                                                                    **************************************<br />
<br />
I decided to go for a check up at the facility alone and if everything was fine, John wouldn’t need to go. It would be too awkward if we both went together because of our first orgasms, doctors would connect the dots quickly. <br />
<br />
During the checkup, it was determined that it wasn’t that my eyes became sharper, but my ability to collect and process information improved. For that reason, I felt that my senses were more clear than before; in addition, focusing on multiple things like listening to two conversations at the same time became easier.<br />
<br />
Also, my reaction speed became a little faster and I had better coordination. I later discovered that while it was a small change, it helped me improve my times while jogging. I guess that not only muscle strength is important while running but form and coordination as well <br />
<br />
Since nothing was wrong with me, John didn&#39;t need to come right now and make things awkward. He could tell the scientist in his next monthly check that he has orgasmed if they ask.<br />
<br />
It was important to clarify that the improvements caused by the synchronization was not actually Hailey’s, now Oliver’s usual performance when he used this body and I just unlocked it , but the synchronization had actually made improvements, and while it was not quite superhuman, it was apparently at the peak of what a human could achieve<br />
<br />
As for my newfound confidence and comfort in my body… Well, I did know that Oliver was transexual and wasn’t satisfied with his life as a woman so I am pretty sure that this change didn’t come from his previous feelings; probably because my mind and body synchronized, I feel much less dissonance between how I feel and what I am.<br />
<br />
When I asked if everybody who body swapped and orgasmed were experiencing the synchronization, I was told that it happened only to 35% of the people and they were trying to find why.<br />
<br />
                                                                                                     ******************************<br />
<br />
I went through my life as normal for the rest of the week. My relationship with Mariah and John didn’t change too much form before the incident, they were treating me like a normal little sister. <br />
<br />
However, the relationship between John and Mariah did change a bit. I saw some thigh and butt grabbing when our parents weren’t at looking, and one time when I returned home from my jogging, I hugged my sister and she smelled a bit like semen<br />
<br />
I wanted to say that it was disgusting, but actually, I remembered what happened before and I almost gave in to the urge to start licking her breasts. In the end I just told her that she needed a bath because she reeked of John’s cum. <br />
<br />
We took a bath together, me to clean the sweat and her to clean other fluids, but nothing sexual happened, just some normal sisterly bonding.</p>
