<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I got a call a few days later from Blake saying he urgently needed to see me. This was not typical and it was early in the day. Fortunately, it was a slow day of classes so I could afford a break. Also, he asked me to meet him on campus in the biology building so I didn&#39;t have to walk far.<br />
<br />
I walked in to what looked like a small dog show. There was one table with screened off sections and in each section was a small animal. Each animal had a leash or some sort of restraint which bothered me but the animals all looked healthy and the restraints were few, just enough to keep the dogs from chasing the cats.<br />
<br />
I found Blake and asked him what he needed. He had me follow him into a storage room. Soon as he had the door shut and started taking my shirt off.<br />
<br />
I asked, &quot;You want to experiment now, here? Is that what&#39;s so urgent.&quot; Then I felt something go around my neck. I realized he had locked my neck to some sort of frame. I started to fight and try to get the collar off my neck but while I was doing that, he managed to undo my pants and pull them down. I tried to reach for them but couldn&#39;t bend over.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; I protested. &quot;I&#39;m not into bondage play.&quot;<br />
<br />
He gave me a long kiss. &quot;I need to demonstrate the shrink ray. They won&#39;t believe me until they can see a shrunken person.&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;Alright but do I have to be bound?&quot; As I said that, he yanked my underwear down. &quot;And naked?&quot;<br />
<br />
He said, &quot;They need to examine you to see that you are still healthy, just shrunk.&quot;<br />
<br />
I asked, &quot;Why the bondage?&quot;<br />
<br />
He kissed me and said, &quot;You wouldn&#39;t let them examine you unless you were bound.&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;I let you examine me.&quot;<br />
<br />
He kissed me again, &quot;I&#39;m your friend and you trust me but these people are strangers. You don&#39;t trust them. You only trust me but trust me now. I won&#39;t let any harm come to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
His logic baffled me and left me speechless. I continued to fight the restraint but I realized that in his mind, I was fighting because I didn&#39;t want strangers examining me. That was true but I also didn&#39;t want to be restrained.<br />
<br />
Blake was strong. It was a struggle to keep from being restrained further. I was able to hold out for a long time but Blake kept interrupting the struggle by kissing me which distracted me and he got my right arm restrained. Then he tried a different tactic and caressed my body in a very stimulating manner. That took the fight out of me and he restrained my left arm with ease. But then he couldn&#39;t move my legs into position because I had the advantage there. So he gave up and started sweet talking me.<br />
<br />
He continued to caress me from head to foot and all points in between as he said, &quot;Please, for me. They don&#39;t believe me and I want them to see that I&#39;m not just a silly inventor. I want them to know that my inventions really do work.&quot;<br />
<br />
I sighed and moved my legs into position. He had me fastened spread eagle to a square frame. Then he got out a razor and started shaving my body hair. I cringed and couldn&#39;t watch but I knew Blake thought they should be able to examine me without any hair in the way. I&#39;d shaved before and didn&#39;t mind other guys seeing me in the locker but the thought that I was about to let some strangers examine my hairless body made me want to shrink and disappear. Then I laughed realizing I was about to do at least one of the two.<br />
<br />
Blake did think about my comfort. He attached a harness to me so my torso wouldn&#39;t sway too much. The harness was only three straps so it still left me completely exposed but it would prevent me from having all my weight yanking on my hands and feet. He had also installed handles on the frame so my hands would have something to hold onto. Then he shrunk me frame and all.<br />
<br />
He picked me up and carried me out to my own little screened section on the table with the other animals. I instinctively tried to cover my crotch but could not move my arms or legs. He had a little stand on the table to keep my frame upright. I could even stand putting my weight on my feet despite my legs being spread apart. Then Blake walked away and left me there waiting for someone to come examine me.<br />
<br />
A few people did notice me and gave me strange looks. I don&#39;t think they knew what to make of me because they didn&#39;t say anything or come close to me. They just stared at me a while and then went back to their business.<br />
<br />
I overheard some people talking at the other end of the table and realized this was some sort of science fair. The biologists were demonstrating their experiments. I felt bad for the animals but it did seem like the experiments were mild such as measuring the percentage of vitamin D in a dogs diet or running rats through a maze. It did seem like the biologists cared about the welfare of the animals which was good because I was now one of them.<br />
<br />
Then the biologist finally got to me and Blake gave them his spiel. The Biologists were silent and stared at me. Finally one of them said, &quot;So you actually invented a shrink ray. Now is this some sort of joke in protest against animal experiments? You know we take good care of our animals here. Are you trying to make a spectacle of cruelty here? Get him out of that frame.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake looked flustered. He looked like his whole world had collapsed. He started reaching for me and I had to think fast.<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;It&#39;s no joke, sir. I heard how well you treat animals but I did want to learn what it&#39;s like from the animals perspective and where better to experience that then in a place where I could feel safe from cruelty. I&#39;m Blake&#39;s lab rat.&quot;<br />
<br />
The biologist said, &quot;But you&#39;re too restrained. You can&#39;t move at all. That&#39;s cruelty beyond anything we allow.&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;But I allow it. He prodded me. He shaved me. He restrained me. I&#39;m his lab rat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then some of the biologists laughed. I looked over at Blake and he looked relieved. I couldn&#39;t believe I just said all that but honestly, Blake had never hurt me. He was staggeringly awkward but he was also very kind and made me feel good. I couldn&#39;t stand to see him so embarrassed.<br />
<br />
So the biologists left me in the frame as they continued talking. Other people came through from time to time. It was never a huge crowd but occasionally students would want to talk to one of the teachers or some other college staff would walk through like a janitor. They&#39;d stop and stare at me and the biologists explained to them what I was about. Then they&#39;d shake their heads and walk on by.<br />
<br />
Tony happened to be one of them. After the biologists explained my presence, Tony came over and said, &quot;So you&#39;re Blake&#39;s lab rat. What a weirdo.&quot; He picked me up and started looking me all over. &quot;At least you didn&#39;t turn out deformed. You&#39;re the most anatomically correct Ken doll I&#39;ve ever seen.&quot; He turned my frame upside down and blood rushed to my head as he lifted me to his face.<br />
<br />
A biologist came over and said, &quot;We&#39;re not cruel to our animals.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony said, &quot;This isn&#39;t cruelty.&quot; He started petting me. &quot;This is just treating him like a lab rat.&quot;<br />
<br />
The biologist said, &quot;It is cruelty but I guess it&#39;s alright. Come to think of it, we should probably take some samples.&quot;<br />
<br />
The biologist took me and carried me to a separate table, then announced, &quot;Hey everyone, come over here.&quot; As they got closer, he said, &quot;Since our lab rat wants to experience treatment from a lab rat&#39;s point of view, I think we should oblige him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake protested, &quot;Nothing cruel though. I promised him I&#39;d look after him.&quot;<br />
<br />
The biologist said, &quot;No, nothing cruel. Just some of the moderate things that lab rats go through in other facilities that don&#39;t have the high standards of animal treatment we have. Everyone come up with ideas of how lab rats get treated and if it&#39;s not too cruel, we&#39;ll do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh, I was in for it now. I yelled, &quot;No, don&#39;t&quot;<br />
<br />
The biologist said, &quot;That&#39;s the thing, lab rats can&#39;t protest. If you want to learn what it&#39;s like to be a lab rat then your protests are meaningless. So who has some ideas.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another biologist said, &quot;First get him out of that frame. He&#39;s been in that frame for almost an hour and that&#39;s cruel but that frame prevents us from doing other stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
The first biologist said, &quot;Agreed.&quot; and had Blake remove me from the frame. Then one of the biologist fashioned a leash and lead me around on the table a while. He led me so quickly, I had to run to keep up and if I stumbled, he dragged me a little bit. Then the biologists picked me up and handed me off to each other, each one holding me in some strange way. One held me by my ankle. Another squeezed me. Another pinned my arms to my side. Another took my hands in one hand and my feet in another and stretched me as he brought me close to his eyes to get a good look at me.<br />
<br />
Then one of the biologist suggested, &quot;Lab animals are often not kept clean.&quot; He pulled out his lunch, a sandwich with mayo and other sauces. He smeared me across his sandwich.<br />
<br />
One of the biologists said, &quot;That is cute, pose him for the camera.&quot; I looked up and realized he was filming the whole thing. I was placed on the open sandwich. I tried to cover up but one of the biologist said, &quot;Lab rats don&#39;t cover up.&quot; He moved my hands out of the way repeatedly until I quit trying to cover myself.<br />
<br />
A biologist said, &quot;This specimen has big balls. Look at them.&quot;<br />
<br />
I decided if I couldn&#39;t verbally protest, I&#39;d protest any way I could. I shit on the biologist&#39;s sandwich and he said, &quot;Oh yuck.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another biologist said, &quot;That&#39;s just like a lab rat. He&#39;s really getting into his role, pooping without caring who sees it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another biologist said, &quot;We should give him an enema, clean him out. That&#39;s something some labs do.&quot;<br />
<br />
I shouted, &quot;What?&quot; but was ignored as hands picked me up and forced me to bend over for the camera. They used an eye dropper up my butt. They held me over a paper cup and flushed me out several times until they were sure I was clean.<br />
<br />
Then a biologist said, &quot;We need a urine sample.&quot; I didn&#39;t have to pee but he didn&#39;t care. He picked me up, forced my mouth open and started force feeding me water. Eventually I did have to pee and couldn&#39;t hold it. He turned me toward the camera to get a close up.<br />
<br />
Another biologist said, &quot;Now a semen sample.&quot; This time I was placed on the table but I was still held in a bent over position. Each ankle was held in place by a different biologist and spread apart. The rest of me was held by a third biologist and a fourth biologist started milking me.<br />
<br />
I shouted, &quot;Please don&#39;t.&quot; The biologist said, &quot;This is how we get a semen sample if we need one. Since our lab rat is male we massage his prostate as well.&quot; I felt a probe enter me and start moving around. They just kept at it until I shot my load.<br />
<br />
&quot;There we go.&quot; the first biologist said. &quot;Alright, anyone else have any ideas?&quot;<br />
<br />
No one had any.<br />
<br />
The first biologist said, &quot;Alright clean him up. We don&#39;t want to be too cruel.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was taken to a sink and vigorously scrubbed with soap. The guy did not keep me upright but kept turning me over under the water.<br />
<br />
When I was clean, the first biologist locked me back in my frame and said, &quot;The most common cruelty to lab animals is being kept restrained for hours and days.&quot; He carried me out into a hallway. &quot;I&#39;ve called the news media already and told them we have someone making a demonstration against cruelty to animals.&quot; I was placed inside a display case where all sides of me were visible. Someone found thumbtacks and string to secure my frame in place. &quot;We&#39;ll show the world that we are against animal cruelty as much as the ASPCA.&quot;<br />
<br />
The display case was closed and it muffled the sound outside. Then they left me there.<br />
<br />
It was mostly boring. I couldn&#39;t do anything except watch as people stopped and stared at me. News cameras came by and interviewed the biologist but no one opened the display case. I eventually had to pee again. The cameras turned toward me and the reporter pointed at me but I could imagine the biologist telling the reporter, &quot;That&#39;s part of the protest as some labs leave animals to wallow in their own filth. He&#39;s agreed to experience everything a lab rat experiences short of true cruelty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eventually, night came and everyone left. It was hard to sleep standing up. I did nod off a few times but I could see a clock and tell that most of the night, I was unable to sleep.</p>
