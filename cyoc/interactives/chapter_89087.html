<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As soon as Annabelle got into the house she climbed up the stairs on her knuckles and feet to check herself in the bedroom mirror. Even though she&#39;d seen herself in a windows reflection, her new appearance surprised her. She waved her long arms about watching the monkey in the mirror do the same. Before the change she would have corrected herself, knowing that chimps were apes and not monkeys but now her knowledge and intelligence had dwindled. She knew her sister-in-law Mary would find it hilarious that Annabelle, who would lord her intelligence and beauty over Mary, had turned into a dumb, dirty ape.<br />
<br />
Unbeknownst to Annabelle, downstairs her husband had arrived home and found Annabelle handbag on the floor. He saw the newly bought witches costume, complete with magic wand and decided to take it upstairs to the bedroom. What he was greeted by was the site of the female chimpanzee, that was his wife, exploring her body! Whilst examining her new body she&#39;d become curious and slipped a finger between her short, furry legs and before she knew it she was rubbing frantically picturing hot, animalistic sex.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the heck?&quot; Mike shouted startling the chimp who stopped playing with herself. With one hand covering her shame, Annabelle began pointing at the wedding picture of herself and Mike.<br />
<br />
Though he hardly believed it, Mike knew this chimp was trying to tell her she was his wife. <br />
<br />
&quot;Annabelle?&quot; he asked and the chimp began nodding its head vigorously. Pulling the plastic magic wand from Annabelle&#39;s handbag, Mike asked her, &quot;did you change yourself into a chimp? Is that the kind of thing you are into? I mean, it certainly looks like you are enjoying it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Annabelle screeched at him in chimp speak, offended that he would think she&#39;d want this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, okay I&#39;ll try to turn you back!&quot; Mike apologized to the angry chimp.<br />
<br />
As Mike tried to use the magic wand to restore his wife two strangers entered the room. Seeing Mike holding the magic wand and shouting &quot;Dispel&quot; and &quot; change monkey to wife!&quot; Chip and Kira began to laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wow! The husband is already as dumb as an ape!&quot; Kira chuckled, &quot;What say we reunite the happy couple?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My thoughts exactly. I wish he was an ape and this house belonged to us!&quot; said Chip.<br />
<br />
Immediately, things began to change. Annabelle&#39;s PHD that hung on the wall, and she had been immensely proud of, transformed into a pet owners certificate, her name now reading Coco. Mike&#39;s Law degree changed too and he knew his name was now Bobo and they both belonged to Chip and Kira. Mike and Annabelle&#39;s wedding photo changed too, as they were replaced by the toothy grinning chimps, Bobo and Coco, still dressed in grooms suit and bridal gown, a complete mockery of their wonderful Wedding Day. <br />
<br />
Coco stared gormlessly at Mike as he began to shrink. He looked so handsome and smart in his well-fitted and expensive business suit. His masculine, chiseled jaw stretched out and his teeth grew bigger leaving him with the big lipped goofy smile of a chimp. His forehead sloped back and brain shrunk, the hards earned knowledge he&#39;d worked for at University and practicing law dissolving completely. His suit jacket and tie were now barely off the ground and his baggy trousers hung loosely off his shrunken hips and inside he felt his testicles grow to the heavy, oversized ones of a chimpanzee. Even though his arms hand lengthened to touch the ground his sleeves still hung low because he&#39;d shrunk so much. He now matched the chimp in the Wedding photo. He looked like he&#39;d stepped out of some ridiculous comedy movie, thought Chip with his new-found knowledge of pop-culture. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bobo - monkey at law&quot; Chip laughed. Bobo&#39;s lips curled up displeased at being mocked but it only served to make Kira and Chip laugh harder. The proud professional now realized he was nothing but an undignified, unevolved animal. He&#39;d been a serious criminal lawyer and felt disdain at becoming such a foolish creature.<br />
<br />
Coco looked at her husband. Somehow he looked super intelligent and handsome to her, wearing clothes like a human. Her heart fluttered and she thought she was so lucky to have Bobo. She clambered over to him on her knuckles and puckered her big, dopey-looking lips and gave him a sloppy kiss on the cheek. <br />
<br />
&quot;D&#39;awww! Our chimps are in love,&quot; Kira said, the sight would have been more endearing if it weren&#39;t so silly looking.<br />
<br />
Bobo&#39;s trousers tented as he became aroused at his wife&#39;s touch and they began to climb onto the bed out of habit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no you don&#39;t!&quot; said Chip sternly, &quot;beds are for humans. You stupid chimps belong in the cage outside, so get moving.&quot;<br />
<br />
The apeish couple obeyed their new master, following him into the garden and found their new home - complete with a tire swing hung from a tree and a small climbing frame with monkey bars to add salt to their wounded pride. <br />
<br />
The chimps held hands as they were led into their cage, waddling side to side as they awkwardly walked upright. Chip closed the door and returned to the bedroom. Coco and Bobo looked across the garden at the house that was rightfully theirs. Only an hour ago they&#39;d been a young and successful couple making names for themselves. Now they&#39;d had everything taken away: their humanity, their intelligence, their jobs, their home and even their names! They didn&#39;t even know why! It made them feel powerless in front of their master and mistress who now dwarfed them both physically and mentally.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not fair! I don&#39;t want to be a chimp!&quot; Coco said in ape talk. Bobo seemed to understand what she meant even if she wasn&#39;t using real words. He looked over at his naked wife and was reminded of her exploring her body when he&#39;d got home, when he was still Mike, and the thought turned him on. He quickly pulled off his trousers, shirt and jacket leaving only his tie. Aside from the tie a casual onlooker wouldn&#39;t even be able to tell them apart. <br />
<br />
Coco could smell her husbands arousal with her flattened chimp nose and knew exactly what he wanted. She thought of how horny she&#39;d gotten when she&#39;d explored her body and bent over presenting herself to him. He wasted no time, animal urges taking over, and entered her. He began roughly pumping her with his thick cock. It felt so right to Coco, being taken wildly by her animal of a husband and they both let go of their inhibitions, fucking loudly like the apes they&#39;d become. Coco loved it, being ravished and used as a mate to a wild beast. Even as a human she&#39;d liked it doggy-style. Part of her felt she deserved her new place on the evolutionary ladder. She&#39;d craved such passionate sex. Maybe she was meant for it. This was her fate and the body she belonged in.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Yes! I&#39;m nothing but a dirty monkey!&quot; she cried in the heat of the moment, her body shuddering with each wave of pleasure brought on by her mates repeated penetrations. Bobo moaned as he squirted hot jizz into his partner. Feeling somewhat proud he&#39;d done what nature now intended him to do.<br />
<br />
Kira watched from the bedroom window wearing nothing but Annabelle sexiest, black silk lingerie with no panties. &quot;Looks like they are adjusting well. They might still be just intelligent enough to act as servants.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... but barely. They only thought they were smart before, like all humans but they are nothing but animals. That&#39;s why they devolved so quickly. Soon we&#39;ll become the dominant species&quot; Chip said, feeling superior in every way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm,&quot; Kira cooed, &quot;You are so powerful and determined my lover.&quot;<br />
<br />
She sprawled herself on the bed, spreading her legs open invitingly, &quot;Fuck me like the strong man you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chip joined her on the bed rubbing her wet pussy with one hand making her moan from the stimulation. Her breathy cries of sexual pleasure a far cry from those of the rutting animals outside. He took her like a human, kissing her and kneading her tender breasts as he slipped in and out of her before releasing his seed into her sensuous depths. Kira lie back in blissful exhaustion and thought about her wonderful new life and the new life of the pathetic former humans in their cage.</p>
