<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Well, that should be the last heavily world-building chapter. Next one, we collect members for the harem!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I was on the verge of panic. I woke up deeply kissing a demoness, who then transformed into not one, but two girls I knew. Nude. In my bed. Sure, I had fantasized about them, some time both together, even before that botched wish with the fairy. But back then I never expected to have any chance with any of them, or any girl at all to be honest. And even after realizing I hadn&#39;t dreamed the fairy, I never expected to suddenly wake up sharing a bed with them like they had teleported in there.<br />
<br />
Add to it they had been fused into a third person for a few seconds after I opened my eyes, and my freakout was understandable. Thankfully, the girls understood what was happening. Louise gently took me in her arms, slowly stroking my head in an appeasing gesture, before adding a gentle kiss. Once I had calmed down, I felt another kind of excitement build-up in me, but Louise delicately separated before I could deepen the kiss. Not that she didn&#39;t also want sex, (as did her sister) but there was more urgent maters right now.<br />
<br />
I briefly looked at Alice, who was a bit disappointed her sister shared a kiss first. But she knew, unlike me, that Louise would be more apt in calming me down than herself. You see, everyone would expect the sporty tomboy to be the rough one, and her shy intellectual sister to be the delicate one, but they would be wrong.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s true that Lou is very outgoing and always frankly express her feelings and opinions. She&#39;s also known to be fiercely protective of anyone she care about, to the point some see her as some sort of modern day knight, but in reality that&#39;s only the publicly visible part of her caring side. It&#39;s not something she had much occasion to show in public, but she&#39;s very adept at reassuring and calming down peoples, and is a great listener.<br />
<br />
Alice on the other side, may have a hard time opening up to new peoples, but if you can somehow pass her wall of awkwardness and connect with her, you better be ready for it. The few peoples who got her trust know they can always count on her to deliver hard truth, and she never take glove in handing them. Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a consequence of her difficulty expressing herself, but she&#39;s very intense when it come to sex, not that I knew any of this back then.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will explain the situation,&quot; promised Alice, while she took my chair and sat in it, placing it near the bed. &quot;But first, you need some context.&quot;<br />
<br />
As her sister said that, Lou laid back down on the bed, slowly and delicately guiding me so my mouth would be above her nipple. Like it was some new instinct, I started to suck on it, drinking the milk it delivered, not ever realizing what I was doing, at the time.<br />
<br />
As soon as she saw I was comfortably installed, Alice pursued &quot;When a sex-demon reach the equivalent of their teenage years, they are sent to Earth as both a rite of passage, and a way to keep those back in hell aware of humanity&#39;s societal evolutions. Historically, it wasn&#39;t only so any sex-demon coming to Earth, regardless of the reason, can act inconspicuous and blend in, but also to guaranties we could dish the best punishments to any freshly damned souls coming our way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What our kin only realized recently,&quot; continued her sister while petting my head, me still sucking on her boob &quot;Is that once come judgment-day, we&#39;ll only have the remaining damned to feed on and, once we&#39;re finished with them, all that&#39;s left is to slowly die of starvation. So a secondary objective was added: Try to find someone, a good person still able to fall in love a sex-demon and, if possible, convince them to accept to have a full harem of our kin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyone married to a sex-demons, will be protected from the nasty effect from bedding their new spouse, regardless of the ceremony used, becoming an infinite food-source for said spouse. But having a human marry more of us would be better, since that mean there is more of our kind that can feed on him without endangering his life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice followed up. &quot;The thing is, normally, to prevent God and his angels from spotting us, we respect freewill. Which mean the potential human lover need, first, to accept to marry a succubus on their own and, second, to accept a succubi-style ceremony. But your case is a special one. Because our sister, Stephanie, seems to have a problem with us being interested in you, for some reason. Problem is, even the co-empresses of sex-demons can&#39;t openly go against the ancestral laws of demon-kind. Demons are supposed to tempt humans into doing evil things, damning themselves. As such, any human not already under a contract with a demon, wedding include, is fair game. So, pressed by time, we put you trough the ritual, made you our husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
Louise got on my other side, made me suck on her other breast, having emptied the first one of its milk, before explaining why I briefly saw a stranger who then turned into the two of them. Then she added &quot;But apparently you prefer to have Alice and I as, well, ourselves, rather than an amalgam of us. I&#39;m not sure how, but you caused a miracle, making both of us the heads of your harem. Because we&#39;re only the 2 first members, we&#39;ll select many more, succubi we know you&#39;ll love, even if they&#39;ll never be as important to you as Alice and myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don&#39;t know if it was the milk I was still drinking affecting me, but I liked the idea of having a whole harem of succubi selected by the 2 wives I already had. That said, there was one person I wanted to make part of my harem by myself, and only if they accepted after I explained the situation. It probably wouldn&#39;t happen though, the chance I would meet that person again were too small.<br />
<br />
As I had finished drinking from Lou&#39;s second boob, emptying it of its milk, the girls started to get up. &quot;We would gladly stay, but you need at least <strong>some</strong> sleep. Especially with our plans for tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Plan?&quot; I sleepily asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;As the heads of your harem, we won&#39;t be able to hide our feelings for you,&quot; explained Alice. &quot;So, we plan on publicly asking you to date both of us simultaneously. I recommend you to act both surprised and extremely embarrassed by it, but still accept from how we insist.&quot; If I wasn&#39;t so sleepy at the time, the wicked grin she was now sporting would probably have scared me.<br />
<br />
As the girls flew through my window, I was slowly falling back asleep.<br />
— – - – —<br />
Stephanie, being the identical triplet of Alice & Lou, knew of them joining me in unholy matrimony the very moments it happened and, as we would discover later, it enraged her.<br />
<br />
Our wedding, even if only acknowledged by demons, (and maybe God) should have been enough to dissuade her from ever trying to kill me, but Stephanie wasn&#39;t one to play by the rule. She would just have to convince one of the lowly human gravitating around her to do the job for her. Maybe convince the principal to expel her sisters beforehand, so they couldn&#39;t protect me…</p>
