<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Keith sat down he closed his eyes for Naomi started them off.<br />
<br />
Naomi's choice: Brown legs<br />
<br />
Keith's legs suddenly started to grow, first longer by a few inches and then the muscles grew as well. &quot;They look nice&quot; He said.<br />
<br />
Keith's choice: Fox, Eyes<br />
<br />
Naomi couldn't feel any changes and looked in the mirror they had set up to see that her eyes were even more fox like. The white area around the edge of the eye had almost completely disappeared, taken over by the gold of her eyes.<br />
<br />
Naomi's choice: Brown Chest<br />
<br />
Keith felt his chest burning up and when he looked down he saw that he was growing abs. Big abs. Looking further down he could see that he was developing an 8 pack. As both Naomi and Keith felt the new muscles, Naomi couldn't help finding Keith to be more and more attractive.<br />
<br />
Keith's choice: Brown Breast<br />
<br />
Naomi felt a familiar feeling in her chest and looking down her thoughts were realized. Her already large breast were growing bigger again. Increasing to once again another cup size. &quot;They weren't big enough for you already?&quot; She yelled at Keith. Smiling again, he took her in his arms and kissed her.<br />
<br />
Naomi's choice: Fox, Hair<br />
<br />
Keith could feel his hair growing as he swallowed the chocolate. He could see in the mirror that his hair was growing, but that wasn't the most startling thing. It was actually changing color. Keith's naturally black hair brightened more and more until it was the same shade as Naomi's. The hair on his head (now down stopping at his shoulders), and the fur on his fox ears and tail were exactly the same as Naomi's. He thought that this actually made him look even hotter.<br />
<br />
Keith's choice: Fox (X2), Butt<br />
<br />
The feeling Naomi now felt in here new tail were strange. Since the tail was already long she could already see that it was growing again, but like with Keith, that wasn't the most startling factor. She was growing another tail. It was small at first, but quickly became bigger and bigger until it reached the same size as the other, which was about 4 feet now. &quot;Holy Shit&quot; Keith said surprised by what had happened.<br />
&quot;What did you give me?&quot; Naomi screamed now able to move and feel both of her new tails.<br />
&quot;I just gave you two fox chocolates including the butt one.&quot; He said innocently. He seemed like he really didn't mean too, so Naomi forgave him.<br />
<br />
Naomi's choice: Brown Arms<br />
<br />
A feeling that Keith was now growing used to he was able to see his arms growing larger and larger. Lengthening a few inches, muscles started to develop quickly. Soon he had biceps that were big but not body builder big. Feeling them Keith realized that even though he looked weaker than a heavy weight boxer, his muscles didn't match up to his new strength.<br />
<br />
<br />
After the rapid changes that Naomi and Keith had done to each other, they both felt like that was enough. After Naomi told Keith that her parents were out of town for the week, they both thought that they would need to think things through to figure out what they were going to do. Getting ready for bed Keith and Naomi got some clothes on. However nothing fit them.<br />
<br />
Naomi was at least 3 inches taller (she was looking Keith's nose at eye level), her bust was now several sizes larger and her hips and waist were several inches different.<br />
<br />
Keith wasn't having as much luck, his underwear were now for someone with several less muscle mass.<br />
<br />
They made do, however and after getting back into the room Keith had another idea. Using his new found strength, Keith picked up Naomi. &quot;Man, I must be really strong. She's as light as a feather now&quot;. Laying down on the bed Naomi wrapped one of her new tails around her and Keith, and had the other one intertwined with Keith's own. Getting close they new that whatever they decided tomorrow, they still had each other.</p>
