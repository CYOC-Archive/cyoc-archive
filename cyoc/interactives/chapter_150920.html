<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>My thanks to both s1 and my lady for their input creating this episode.—tmw.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">If there was one thing Henry &quot;Huck&quot; Jenkins, Junior could not stand, it was waiting.<br />
As a building contractor, sometimes he didn&#39;t even have the patience to let paint dry, wanting to get on to the next step or project as soon as possible.<br />
Yet, despite his impatience, this WAS worth the wait.<br />
He sat on the edge of the fold out bed within the sofa of the cabin borrowed for his weekend honeymoon.<br />
Huck had lit a couple of candles for romantic atmosphere, although as a weredog he didn&#39;t need the light to see in the dark.<br />
Other than kicking off his shoes and socks while unbuttoning his shirt, he remained dressed.<br />
Thoughts of his past, and everything that led to this moment in time ran through his mind.<br />
<i>I&#39;ve known her since my family first moved to Moon Lake. Why did it take having to be shot to discover how she really felt about me? Let alone how I feel about her?</i> he asked himself yet again, but unfortunately no answers were forthcoming.<br />
<br />
The last thing Huck wanted to do was stare at the cabin&#39;s closed bathroom door, yet he couldn&#39;t help doing just that.<br />
Inside, getting ready for the intimacy of their honeymoon and her induction into were society was his new bride Betty Timid.<br />
<i>Betty JENKINS!</i> Huck silently corrected himself.<br />
Huck recalled all the times Betty had been near him. With him.<br />
Laughing at his jokes. Even the lame ones.<br />
<i>Okay. Especially the lame ones.</i><br />
The way she looked at him.<br />
The way she smelled.<br />
<i>How could I have been so blind? I just hope I&#39;m worthy of her.</i><br />
And then, exactly one hour to the moment after Betty took her first weredog birth control pill, the bathroom door opened.<br />
<br />
Betty Timid-Jenkins had been ready long before she turned to open the bathroom.<br />
In fact, she had been ready for this moment from practically the first moment she met Huck Jenkins.<br />
She looked at herself in the bathroom mirror for the countless time, making sure everything was perfect.<br />
At least for what was about to happen, Betty had been ready for a good half hour, if not longer.<br />
The problem was, considering they didn&#39;t know whether or not they would be able to find a Justice of the Peace and get married today, especially after the Town Council&#39;s decision last night to form a plan to intentionally reveal were existence (but not Moon Lake&#39;s position as a were sanctuary) to the world while weres could still have some hope of controlling the situation in their favor, Betty had not bothered to take her first weredog birth control pill until after she was officially Mrs. Huck Jenkins.<br />
Betty couldn&#39;t help staring at her mirror image. <i>You&#39;d think after how long I&#39;ve waited for this moment to begin with, I could handle another lousy hour for the pill to take effect!</i><br />
She had the normal &quot;new bride&quot; jitters of any newlywed.<br />
But this situation was compounded by the fact that her new husband was a weredog, and considering how fertile were society seemed to be...<br />
Huck and Betty had already decided they would wait at least a year before having their first kid (pup?) together.<br />
After all, considering how long it took them to reach the &quot;altar&quot;, both wanted some time to fully enjoy being man and wife together before starting a family.<br />
<i>Besides, considering weres live for up to 400 years, it&#39;s not like my biological clock is going to start ringing tomorrow. I&#39;m only in my 20s,</i> Betty told herself.<br />
In light of almost losing the man of her dreams however, Betty wondered if she did the right thing taking that pill.<br />
That perhaps they should go ahead and start a family now.<br />
But considering Huck&#39;s outstanding medical bills from getting shot, as well as the fact that she would never break her word—especially not to the man she loved—Betty figured when they would start having children could be a subject revisited after the honeymoon.<br />
Besides, there were more important matters to address right now.<br />
<br />
Huck smiled as Betty emerged from the bathroom.<br />
She was wearing a very sheer negligee, and nothing else.<br />
It was all Betty could do to keep from running into his arms.<br />
Instead, she twirled once in front of the bathroom door so her husband could see ALL of her.<br />
In the past, the skimpiest outfit she had ever worn around Huck was a one piece swimsuit during the summer at the lake.<br />
Now...<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re beautiful,&quot; said Huck, as Betty approached.<br />
Someone with a more neutral position on the subject would say Betty was just a tad more than average, as if she was living up to her maiden name; but it was what was within Huck&#39;s heart that mattered most.<br />
&quot;Thank you Mister Jenkins,&quot; said Betty, as she hugged him.<br />
&quot;I love you Mrs. Jenkins,&quot; said Huck, before they kissed.<br />
When their lips finally parted, Huck couldn&#39;t help noticing the tear in her eyes.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br />
&quot;Can you say that again?&quot; requested Betty.<br />
&quot;I love you,&quot; repeated Huck.<br />
&quot;No. Mrs. Jenkins,&quot; said Betty, leaning against him. &quot;Ever since high school...&quot;<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; replied Huck, holding her close and kissing the top of Betty&#39;s head. &quot;I was such a fool.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then it takes one to know one. For I was a fool in love. For you,&quot; said Betty, before they kissed again.<br />
This kiss was longer than the last one, but when their lips finally parted, Betty looked at her man and said, &quot;All the sleepless nights I spent pining for you before graduation. I intentionally went to college out of state, hoping to find someone since you seemed oblivious to how I felt...&quot;<br />
&quot;Oblivious, maybe. But you were and are my closest friend,&quot; replied Huck.<br />
&quot;There were a few... dalliances. I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m no longer a virgin,&quot; confessed Betty, &quot;but obviously not with a were. Let alone you, for it was always Huck Jenkins I was waiting for.&quot;<br />
&quot;The virgin part doesn&#39;t matter. Besides, growing up in Moon Lake, you know how it is for weres.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah. Sex seems to be the were national past time,&quot; quipped Betty.<br />
&quot;I know now there&#39;s more to life than that. Want to know a secret?&quot; Huck asked her.<br />
Betty nodded affirmatively, so he said, &quot;The last year or so of group meetings, I left after the actual business part. I totally lost interest in the... rest. It was beginning to dawn on me that there was something missing from my life. Someone actually. It just took me far longer than it should have to realize that someone was you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh Huck,&quot; said Betty, laying her head against his hairy chest within the open shirt. &quot;The way my heart ached, if I couldn&#39;t be with you, I&#39;d probably wind up an old maid.&quot;<br />
&quot;That would be a colossal waste of a beautiful woman,&quot; said Huck, holding her.<br />
Then Betty saw the remains of the catalyst that finally brought them together.<br />
&quot;This hasn&#39;t totally healed yet?&quot; she asked, referring to his bullet scar.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; he reassured her. &quot;Perhaps still having a bit of a scar is fitting. A reminder of what I should have done years ago.&quot;<br />
&quot;Which is?&quot;<br />
&quot;Showed more interest in you. Especially of the romantic variety,&quot; Huck said with a smile.<br />
&quot;Well then, what are you waiting for Mr. Jenkins?&quot; asked Betty, before removing his shirt.<br />
&quot;Nothing but you Mrs. Jenkins,&quot; he replied, before sweeping Betty off her feet and into his arms.<br />
<br />
