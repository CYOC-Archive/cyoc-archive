<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Since he had directly improved the life of everyone else in his family, he wanted to do the same for himself. But what improvement should he bring? Being unable to think of anything to change in his life, he wrote ‘Once I finished writing this sentence, my sister will gently take the Journal of Fact and my pen, before writing what she think is an improved version of my life along with all the needed context the way she would have written a story, and nobody will notice.’<br />
<br />
Like Colin wrote, Jane delicately took the Journal from his hand, after having gently asked for his consent, and started to not only write, but also illustrate her ‘story’.<br />
<br />
Somehow, she couldn&#39;t help but simultaneously think of one of her favorite manga series, a story about a boy somehow ending up dating a goddess, and how frustrated she was with a certain passage with said human gaining an angel of his own, (something only gods normally have in this series) to just as soon find a way to take away said angel, which should have become part of the male lead, without affecting said character.<br />
<br />
The first thing she wrote was that the world had a multitude of gods and goddess, all equals to each others and with only one objective: the well-being of every living being and, in the case of intelligent ones, like humans, to incite them toward being the best peoples they can be.<br />
<br />
While goddesses & gods live in a higher plane of existence, they can come down to the simpler plane in which Earth can be found. When on Earth, they don&#39;t appear with blue markings on their face, that would be ridiculous. No, they simply look like the healthiest humans that can be, the power they radiate being the only clue they aren&#39;t human, and only when they don&#39;t hide it.<br />
<br />
Each god have at least one angel, a being that&#39;s another manifestation of said god&#39;s very soul, while also a resident of said soul. While fully manifested, an angel look a lot like a human being spouting from the back of their host/master, but with immaculately white (and usually feathered) wings and a genie-like tail instead of legs. Said tail is always rolled in something made of whatever element(s) their god or goddess have the strongest affinity for.<br />
<br />
Even with this genie-like tail, angels are still ‘anatomically correct’, in the sense that they have every organ a human of the same sex would have (outside of the legs), even the more intimate parts.<br />
<br />
That said, the manifestation on an angel can also be a partial one, in which case only their wings are visible, spouting from their host&#39;s back like it was their own.<br />
<br />
While sharing the soul of their host, to the point of being a part of said host, they also are, as contradictory as it seem, their own being. So they always think a bit differently to their host, which ultimately help said host in pondering what is the best action to take or decision to make.<br />
<br />
While far less numerous than either humans or gods, demons does exist too, and go from the mostly human looking and easily disguised, to the madness inducing lovecraftian horrors. The first of them is, naturally, the fallen god Lucifer, the original older of the ‘Satan’ title. (And the one to always take it back, sooner or later.)<br />
<br />
Lucifer fell when he got in his head that his fellow god needed a leader, trying to become said leader by force. This corruption also affected his angel, which became the first devil, and the only one with feathered wings. The now black wing of his angel inspired Lucifer who created new kinds of devils.<br />
<br />
As you might have guessed, devils are the evil counter-part to angels, making them being doing everything in their power that profoundly and irremediably corrupt the soul of whoever became their host. But they are more than just &quot;evil angel with bat-like wings so dark they seem to eat the light around them&quot;. First, there is as much kind of devils as there is of demons. What kind of demon one became depend of what kind of devil has latched on their soul. Secondly, unlike an angel, a devil can turn its genie-like tail into legs and wander far away from its host.<br />
<br />
In fact, while a god or goddess can have more than one angel, but any of their angels can only have one host, it work the other way around for demons and their devils. (That said, not all devils want more than one host. For exemple Lucifer&#39;s devil exclusively bonded to him.)<br />
<br />
Some of the currently existing demons are former humans who became the host of a devil, the more well known example being Lilith, the first ever succubus. But the majority are former gods. Demons capture a god, forcefully extract their angel, which is extremely painful, as much physically than mentally, and then a devil take the place of the freshly removed angel. Most of the time it kill the god, with a 25% chance of taking the devil with it. And on very rare occasions, the devil get purified instead, becoming a new angel. (Almost always newborn devil without any host yet.) While such an angel <strong>does</strong> have immaculately white wings, they still are bat-like. They also conserve some of the powers they had as a devil, which one vary from individual to individual.<br />
— – - – —<br />
Satisfied with what she had written so far contextualized everything, Jane added that, as a young kid, during a school trip, Colin saw a group of demon extract an angel from its goddess. He was too young to understand the difference between humans, angels and gods, all he saw was two women scared and in pain. While the ‘normal looking woman’ was still in the hand of the ‘scary peoples’, the one with wings and a bizarre tail rolled in what seemed to be a cloud had been thrown in his direction and, before any one could stop him, Colin ran to her.<br />
<br />
All he wanted was to comfort the poor ‘woman’ until the professionals arrived. Copying what he saw on TV, he placed his hands in hers in a comforting gesture and was about to say reassuring nothings, but as soon as he touched her the angel bonded to him on the soul level, but not completely, still yearning for her original host.<br />
<br />
Colin was still a simple human, but he could feal the angel now floating behind him, coming from his back. She had become part of him, mostly, but was somehow still a bit part of the other woman, all that while also being her own self. It was very strange… But at least he now knew she was called Hope, while her former host was Faith.<br />
<br />
The young boy tried to calm down Hope, while she was desperately trying to think a way to help her previous host without endangering Colin, when she saw something that made her loose hope: A devil had just bonded with Faith. Seeing which kind of devil it was, the world would soon have one more succubus… But that was without counting on Faith&#39;s stubbornness.<br />
<br />
Her new devil was able to cause headache, heartache and even soulache to the goddess, but was unable to actually corrupt her. She kept trying though, and because she was a young devil without any prior experience, it was taking a toll on her. Suddenly, the unnamed devil was engulfed in a bright light. Once the light dissipated, it was clear she had been purified into an angel. Since their plan had ended in failure, and since and the devil&#39;s change into an angel was briefly disorienting Faith, the demons decided to flee while they still could.<br />
<br />
Sensing the danger had dissipated, and still wanting to give back Hope, Colin approached the freed goddess. Being next to the former-devil, the boy could see she too had a cloud draped around her strange tail. Once the distraction caused by said cloud had dissipated, he noticed she was nude instead of wearing a ‘strange dress’ like Hope was. (In reality a roman-like toga.)<br />
<br />
While Faith was happy Colin wanted to give Hope back, she also knew it would hurt him since they had bonded, albeit for a short time and only partially. But briefly looking at her new and yet to be named angel, she thought maybe there was a way for her to take back Hope without hurting the boy that had wanted to help said angel.<br />
<br />
She lowered herself so she wouldn&#39;t tower over Colin, before thanking him and offering a hug, saying it would make transferring Hope back easier. He accepted. While they hugged, Colin felt his connection to Hope being broken, but also a new one replacing it. Faith separated from Colin before he could reject his new bond with the former devil. All he could do in answer to this was look at Faith with a sad face and ask &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you wanted to help, but understood you had no chance against the demons, and so tried to comfort Hope. Because you had bonded with her, if only partially, and would have forever felt like a part of you was missing without an angel of your own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh…&quot; Eloquently answered Colin. &quot;What&#39;s her name? I can&#39;t ‘feel’ it, like I could with Hope.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She doesn&#39;t have one yet. But if you concentrate and search in your heart, your soul, the ideal name should come to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Colin closed his eyes and concentrated, his right hand above his heart, and pictured himself rummaging in himself for a name, before saying <strong>one</strong> Spanish word, &quot;Aqua&quot;. As soon as he said it, he felt his connection with the newly named angel become stronger, deeper.<br />
<br />
Faith knew she would be punished for this, but it was well worth it. Not that Colin was the first human to be gifted an angel of his own, but they usually wait for said person to be an adult, and it was always a decision taken conjointly and unanimously by every gods.<br />
<br />
Looking at Colin with a fond smile, Faith said &quot;Me or another god will visit you later to explain how to take care of an angel. For now you should let her fold back into your soul. Make sure no one know about her,&quot; just in time for some of her kin to join them and help making everyone beside Colin forget what happened.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Faith&#39;s punishment was revealed to consist of her having to masquerade as a kid Colin&#39;s age and going to school with him everyday, while teaching him how to take care of Aqua, and how to use (and NOT use) the powers having an angel grant him.<br />
<br />
While both Faith and Colin have an affinity for water, being human, Colin can only manipulate preexisting water (including making it change state, like turning it into vapor or ice, which also work in reverse) and use it as some sort of transport medium (entering into water-point A like it was a hole, and appear out of water-point B), where the goddess can also create it, and can do the same with anything else, she just find it a bit easier with water.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the first thing Faith did after receiving her punishment, was to go to Colin&#39;s house along with the fellow goddess tasked with making sure she accomplished said punishment (and would act as her mother for peoples not in the know), explaining the situation.<br />
<br />
As soon as Colin was back home, he was asked to materialize Aqua, and tests were made not only to know what she could and couldn&#39;t do, but also to make sure she wouldn&#39;t turn back into a devil. (She won&#39;t.) After the test, it was discovered Aqua could still turn her ‘tail’ into legs, but unlike a devil she couldn&#39;t go farther than 20 meters from her host, and the presence of walls in between shortened that distance.<br />
<br />
Colin&#39;s parent were surprised to see that his angel looked like a girl version of him, considering her origin. And while Colin is, always was and always will be male in both body and mind, Aqua is, always was and always will be just as much a girl in both body and mind, despite being his angel.<br />
<br />
They were just as surprised to learn that having an angel, Colin would need to eat for two. He would also have to clean himself alone before doing the same with Aqua. It was important that he was the one doing it, without any help (not even from Aqua) or, failing that, to have a god or goddess either helping him or outright doing it for him.<br />
<br />
Over the years Faith and Colin became friends, to the point she stayed in contact. It was a bit harder for Colin to answer. All he could do is pray, with no way to know which god will hear it, let alone if they&#39;ll have the time to transmit it to Faith. But a tragic event gave the other gods an idea of how to make things simpler for them. They recently failed in saving one of their own, a goddess known for having two angels that are identical twins, (something almost as rare than a devil-turned-angel) but were able to rescue said angels before the loss of their host killed them. Since identical twins are known to have a telepathic link, if they give one to Faith and the other to Colin, the two friends should also have a telepathic link, or at least be able to use the one between their new angels.<br />
<br />
Being rescued angels the wins, named Rose & Kamelia, still have the element affinity of their previous host, namely plants. As such, their tail is protected by a vine covered in thorns, (or is it prickles?) but without hurting the angels or their hosts.<br />
<br />
Being given his second angel during his sleep, Colin didn&#39;t realize its presence, feeling ‘inexplicably strange and uncomfortable’. It&#39;s not until Faith asked about Kamelia, needing to explain that it was the name of his new angel, that he learned of her existence. While he was used to cleaning Aqua, who just looked like a tomboy version of himself (although if any of his friends knew of her, they would try to seduce Aqua, not caring she&#39;s Colin&#39;s angel) he wasn&#39;t prepared to do the same with a MILF looking angel. He was used to clean B-cup breast every day, but now he also had to do the same E-cup ones. His embarrassment made Faith laugh for days. (Jane couldn&#39;t tell the relationship between the goddess and her brother. Were they still ‘just’ best friends? Had they upgraded to lovers? Or was it something in between?) He would also have to learn how to take care of her long red hairs, since Aqua had a messy and very short (but surprisingly feminine-looking on her) hairdo. And looking at Kamelia&#39;s emerald-green eyes and the cute freckles on and around her noes, he was forced to admit she was one sexy MILF of an angel.<br />
<br />
But Faith didn&#39;t came back just to let Colin know about Kamelia and mock his reaction to said angel&#39;s physique. No, she had another mission, one for which she wanted Colin&#39;s help. Another human had recently proven themselves worthy of having an angel of their own, someone Colin know very well: his sister.<br />
<br />
Jane wrote that her angel, Radiance, looked exactly like her, to the point that if it wasn&#39;t for the wings and the genie-like tail, they would be undistinguishable. Jane&#39;s element is light, which mean with training she could make peoples see whatever she want, and her angel&#39;s tail is actually protected by a total absence of light around it, making it seems to be surrounded by a pitch-black nothing, an impenetrable hole in reality.<br />
<br />
That said, Jane added another mission for Faith, appointed as a secret one: Destroy the Journal of Fact so it wont be able to manipulate people into using it anymore, along with any memories anyone might have of it. She even added that Faith would accomplish it as soon as she closed said Journal. Then, Jane did just that.</p>
