<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Okay, Tim,&quot; Mark began, &quot;here's your transform.  It's gonna get pretty weird, but don't sweat it.  It's both two and three parts, in a weird sort of way.  Two stages, I guess.  For the first stage, you will split into two identical selves, and I mean identical.  It'll be two of you.  For the second stage, one of you will transform into a fit, attractive male anthro-raccoon, and the other you will transform into a beautiful anthropomorphic vixen.  Both of you will be fully clothed, raccoon-you in a T-shirt and shorts, and vixen-you in similar attire, only women's.&quot;  Tim gaped at the weirdness, but something about it fascinated him, so he went along with it.  He DID approve of the clothing bit, though - Kyle, er, Kylie had ended up effectively naked, and Mark's clothes were torn pretty badly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the dare?&quot; he asked, both terrified and enthralled.  Mark grinned even bigger.<br />
<br />
&quot;This one's great.  For the dare - which will apply to both of you - you will retain the transform or dare power, as well as instantly giving it to both myself and Kylie, and nobody else will be able to use it without our unanimous agreement.  In addition, the raccoon-you will have better self-control, won't show nervousness, and will be a real gentleman, especially to Kylie, but otherwise retain your personality.  Likewise, vixen-you will still be you, but with a definite &quot;girly&quot; flair, but not too much - also fairly independent and quite intellectual, with a quick wit, so basically my perfect girl, and will respond instinctively to 'Trisha' to help with adjusting.&quot;  Mark finally finished, and all three waited to see the results, Tim with a truly unbelievable level of nervousness.  In particular, he was anxious about the changes to his personality.  Suddenly, Kylie squealed at something - that something being the sight of Tim pulling apart.<br />
<br />
The process took about two minutes, and Tim looked like a disturbing human-shaped version of those cells you can see splitting under a microscope.  When it was finished, two Tims stood there, baffled.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you're me?&quot;<br />
&quot;Uh, I think you're you and me.&quot;<br />
&quot;Screw it.  I'm not playing that stupid game.&quot;<br />
&quot;Agreed.&quot;<br />
<br />
And so both Tims awaited their transformations - which started at the exact same moment.  Tim-one underwent a transformation similar to Mark's - fairly straightforward, if a bit painful, ending with a tall raccoon-man covered in dark grey and black fur, only with a complete set of clothes.  Tim-two, however, shared a fate similar to Kylie's.  He screamed in pain as sweat poured down him.  Fur spread swiftly across his body, as his chest ballooned into two large - but not enormous - breasts, while his man parts were painfully sucked inward.  His hair lengthened until it was past shoulder-length, at which point it brought itself up into a ponytail and turned brown (it had been blond).  At this point, of course, this Tim was quite thoroughly a she, who, for the sake of convenience, will now be referred to as Trisha.  She lay on the ground in pain, while a clean set of clothes formed on her.<br />
<br />
After a minute or two of utter silence, Tim spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was the single weirdest experience I have EVER had.  Kylie, I don't think even your change holds a candle to that - though 'other me' just might have had it worse than either of us.&quot; He chuckled gently, then knelt down to himself-turned-Trisha.  He took her hand and helped her off the floor, and she steadied herself against a wall.  Trisha suddenly snickered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like I've just been helped by myself.  This is so freaking weird.  Mark, why'd you feel the need to do that?&quot; she asked.  While there was a slight edge to her voice, her warm tone made it clear that she was not truly angry.  Mark grinned hugely, and took Trisha's hand.  She promptly turned that into a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what?&quot; she said, &quot;Screw Jennifer.  She thought she had us, but I think she helped us.  This could be cool.  Honestly, I always wondered what being a girl was like, and now I get to experience it.&quot;  Tim, Kylie, and Mark all nodded.  Why be miserable, like Jen wanted?  Sure, it was weird, but then... normal was boring.  Heck, Jen might've accidentally done them a favor.  Meanwhile, far away, Jen suddenly felt a random, gut-wrenching feeling of despair and failure.<br />
<br />
Several hours went by as the anthro-animals talked amongst themselves, discussing how to deal with various problems, such as parents, siblings, and other issues.  However, it was quickly determined that those would not be a real issue, as Kylie's parents came in, greeted the four, and went about their business like nothing was happening.  Kylie checked her room, and found that it was both much more suited for her new self in terms of personality and in terms of clothing, which she promptly changed into.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know,&quot; suggested Tim, &quot;we could turn our families into our respective species.  It wouldn't be as weird that way, and we could even make it so that it had, for all intents and purposes, always been that way.&quot;  Kylie and Trisha both nodded in agreement, while Mark took a minute to think it over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; he agreed in the end, &quot;that'd be the best thing to do.  Plus, it'd be a good way to test out our ability to transform-or-dare at will.&quot;  With that in mind, Kylie took it upon herself to change her family, one member at a time, to ensure that the power could be used repeatedly.  When she was finished, her house was full of anthropomorphic raccoons - in fact, one more than before, as she'd made her sister into two little sisters as an experiment.  They were identical twins, and incredibly fun, as it turned out.  They all agreed they'd have to be careful to not get too carried away with the power, though.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'd all better split up and change the rest of our families,&quot; noted Mark.  As they got up to leave, Trisha stopped cold.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey... guys, we have a problem.  I don't HAVE any parents.  I mean, I do, but they're Tim's parents, and not mine anymore, because I'm someone different.  Crap this is confusing.&quot;  Trisha sat down again, frustrated and kind of depressed.  Of course, her new-founded quick-wittedness saved the day, as she suddenly brightened up again.<br />
<br />
&quot;We could use Jen!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Only if she's willing, though.  I mean, I know she was a jerk, but we don't have to abuse her, and honestly, I don't want an unwilling family member.&quot;  This suggestion was immediately agreed upon as both brilliant and poetic, and while Mark and Tim went off to change their families, Kylie and Trisha went to Jen's place.</p>
