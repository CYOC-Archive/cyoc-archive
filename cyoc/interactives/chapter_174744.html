<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jay woke in a strange room. There were bright lights and electronic beeps. Where was he?<br />
<br />
&#39;She&#39;s waking&#39; someone said. The voice was familiar. It was Ele. The girl who had come to stay in your flat. <br />
<br />
&#39;Where am I?&#39; Jay asked. His voice was so high now. He sounded like a girl. He remembered he had been this way for weeks, ever since the botched transfer.<br />
<br />
&#39;In hospital. It&#39;s alright now. You got really sick and they knocked you out. But I have good news now. You are all fixed. You will be normal once more&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Fixed?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes. They gave you an emergency transfer. You are complete once more&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;So can I go home? When can I get out of here?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;ve pressed the nurse call button. Maybe she will have an answer&#39;<br />
<br />
Jay was still pretty groggy. He vaguely recognised someone was examining him. A strange female voice said &#39;Easy now. You have been very ill. The doctor is on his way&#39; <br />
<br />
Soon after a male voice spoke to jay. &#39;Jay, I&#39;m Doctor Zeniac, You have been very ill. Unfortunately you blood was poisoned. We have had to give you a full transfusion. We will need to keep you here for another 24 hours. I&#39;m going to knock you out again. However be reassured you friend Ele is here beside you. You are on the mend and next time you wake you will feel much better&#39;. Jay felt a pin prick on his arm. Soon he was back to sleep.<br />
<br />
The doctor spoke to Ele once Jay was sleeping once more &#39;She is progressing nicely. Her vital signs are much better. Both the transfusion and the transfer seem to have gone well. Have you had any luck tracing Jay&#39;s family?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;No. I found nothing. I think after the botched transfer she got rid of everything from her old life. It looked like she had even thrown out her old clothes. I think the flat we were staying in was not her own. To be honest it is a bit of a dump. All I found in her flat were some dirty unisex garments&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well she will need some clothes to wear home tomorrow. I know the dress she arrived in has gone through the hospital laundry and is clean. However I believe she had no underwear. She will be sleeping until tomorrow morning. There will be plenty of time for you to go back to her flat and clean up. Make sure to bring back underwear and shoes for her. I&#39;m hoping we can send her home around mid-day tomorrow&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;But that&#39;s the strange thing. She has virtually nothing in her flat. And what&#39;s there is pretty disgusting&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Let me talk to a nurse. We may be able to get one of the hospital charities involved&#39;<br />
<br />
10 minutes later a nurse introduced Ele to a very well dressed elderly woman. &#39;Ele, this is Mrs Broderick who is a representative of the the Hospital foundation. She would like to help you&#39;<br />
<br />
Ele ended up telling Mrs Broderick what she knew about Jay&#39;s situation. Once more Ele told the story about how Jay was tricked out of her own genitals and the disaster that had ensued. She also told her own sorry tale. Mrs Broderick listened sympathetically.<br />
<br />
&#39;Well I think we can do something for both you and Jay. We can get a team of team of people to clean out Jay&#39;s flat, however if she is heading home tomorrow we have no time to lose. I&#39;ll get onto that straight away. What is your address? I&#39;ll meet you there with a team of people in an hour&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Thank-you that sounds wonderful. Jay will be so happy to go home to a clean flat&#39;<br />
.......<br />
An hour later Ele showed Mrs Broderick into Jay&#39;s flat. Mrs Broderick immediately screwed up her nose. &#39;Poor girl. This is exactly the sort of case I find most rewarding&#39; She turned to the two men who had arrived with her. &#39;Clean out the lot. We&#39;ll replace everything including the bed&#39; Mrs Broderick looked in the old wardrobe &#39;Disgusting. Get rid of this as well. Ele do you know what size Jay is? I want to give her a new wardrobe&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Um she&#39;s about 5 &#39;10 and pretty skinny. I guess she is only a A-cup. But the foundation doesn&#39;t need to do that. Just cleaning up is enough&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Nonsense. And I won&#39;t be using the Foundation money. I want to use my own. I&#39;m a very wealthy woman. I have a granddaughter who would be a similar size to Jay. I&#39;m going to ring her and get her to send over some outfits for Jay. She is one of those girls who never wears the same clothes twice&#39;<br />
<br />
Ele and Mrs Broderick left the flat. Leaving it to the men who had come in a truck and were immediately  removing the flats contents.<br />
<br />
Mrs Broderick was on the phone once more &#39;Chantelle, It&#39;s Grandma. I have a charity case of a young girl your size and age. I want you to go through your closet and select some clothes to donate to her. She will need everything, shoes, underwear included. Put a package together then send it over in a taxi. I&#39;ll text you the address. Some of the men will be here to receive them.<br />
<br />
Ele noticed the men carrying out Jay&#39;s bed and throw it into the back of the truck. They were not wasting any time.<br />
<br />
&#39;Would you like a lift back to the hospital? I&#39;ll shout you lunch at the cafeteria then you can go back to keeping a vigil on your friend&#39;<br />
<br />
An hour later Ele was back on the chair besides Jay&#39;s hospital bed. Jay was sleeping soundly. Her skin colour was returning. She had looked so pale earlier. Ele was pleased with herself. How much had everything changed for the better in the last couple of days? Wasn&#39;t Jay going to be pleasantly surprised?</p>
