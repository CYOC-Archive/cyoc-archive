<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The morning came in quietly on Moon Lake, and while there wasn&#39;t any rain, there were some clouds overhead that dulled a bit of the morning sunlight. Most Friday mornings this would be joined by an alarm going off, but with this Friday being an &quot;in service&quot; day there was no school and thus no alarm had been set, and as such what ultimately woke Ryan Chang and Connor Ross up was the light coming from the east through Ryan&#39;s bedroom window. Connor woke up to feeling Ryan starting to stir behind him. It was something that served to again reminded Connor of what had happened the previous night.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning,&quot; Ryan said to him with a small smile forming on his muzzle, which soon brought a small smile to Connor&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Though there were some obvious differences between them, which seemed to relate to what their fursonas were based on. Ryan&#39;s was based on the Bobcat, Lynx Rufus, while Connor&#39;s new form was based on the Canadian Lynx, Lynx Canadensis. In this, Ryan&#39;s fur was largely a tannish gray with a few spot markings, though they were mostly a faded brown. Connor found that his was a more silver-gray and more of a solid color. Connor also could see other differences. Ryan&#39;s cheek fur was shorter than Connor&#39;s and the fur tufts at the tips of his ears were much shorter than Connor&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning,&quot; Connor answered and stretched out his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sleep well?&quot; Ryan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... and got some confirmation on things,&quot; Connor commented, referring to his thoughts on whether or not he bisexual, &quot;what time is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Both of them sat up while Ryan looked over to his bedside clock and noted the time before answering, &quot;not super early... but about the normal time for breakfast.&quot;<br />
<br />
That actually got Connor&#39;s eyes to widen a bit as things hit him on that it was now after dawn on Friday morning. He was eighteen, but he technically was still living under his own parent&#39;s home and that carried a curfew with it. But he&#39;d let his own excitement at becoming a werewildcat and getting the answer to questions that he&#39;d had going on in the back of his head about his sexuality for years get to him and he&#39;d ended up sleeping through that curfew. He hadn&#39;t even given his parents a message to say that he would be late or anything of that nature.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man... we slept through my curfew...&quot; Connor blurted and began nervously looking for his clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Curfew?&quot; Ryan asked, &quot;You did tell your folks that our date could have turned into an all night thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... they knew that it was possible that we would be together,&quot; Connor answered, &quot;but there was the thought that I would be back in time...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan gave a heavy sigh, &quot;Okay... well, there may still be some things to handle, such as formally joining the pride that my dad and I belong to, but I suppose some of that can be arranged later. Though, it probably would be best to get something to eat before you head home. I can stop by later with my dad and handle the official stuff, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor nodded with some relief as he found his discarded clothes from the previous night. He moved to pick up his underwear before noting on how his fingers looked a bit more fluffy than Ryan&#39;s did. Of course that would make sense as the Canadian Lynx had large broad paws to help support its weight on snow, which the Bobcat didn&#39;t have. He glanced over to see Ryan returning to his human form. After a moment, Ryan did look to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will have to return to your human form to go outside now that the sun is up,&quot; Ryan pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... uh... how do I do that?&quot; Connor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just think on your human form and your desire to be in that form,&quot; Ryan spoke, &quot;your body will respond in kind. It&#39;s how all weres transform. For warning, it will probably feel like saying good bye to a dear friend and won&#39;t see again... It&#39;s sort of like a psychological to want to be in your fursona. But it will always be there for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor nodded and followed Ryan&#39;s instructions, thinking on his old human form and being in that form. Almost immediately he could feel his feet shorten as he settled back down into plantigrade human feet. His short tail was pulled back into his spine while his fur grew shorter and thinner. His ears sank back down onto the sides of his and had more rounded as his muzzle shrank back and his teeth blunted to better fit a more human face. His claws shortened and then flattened back into human nails before settling down onto the smaller human fingers. As all of this happened, he did feel a sense of sorrowed loss as the wildcat in him &quot;vanished&quot; and his human form came back, but a glance to see Ryan still smiling at him was enough to give him a bit of comfort in that regard.<br />
<br />
&quot;See, no problem,&quot; Ryan answered, &quot;and now you can transform at will. Now best to get dressed and I&#39;ll walk you home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor nodded and quickly began dressing himself in what he wore the previous evening. As he dressed himself, Connor also found that even in his human form there were some things that were a bit different. His clothes still fit reasonably well, but he could tell that they weren&#39;t quite as loose as they were before. It was like his overall muscle tone had improved along with his other changes, which was interesting and he&#39;d double check that later, but for the moment he still had to get ready. Once he had his shoes on, Ryan lead him out and downstairs. They made their way down and came into the kitchen where they found one woman and man in the kitchen. The man was a Chinese American and was pouring himself a cup of coffee while the woman was busy frying eggs at the stove. Connor noted that he could now tell their scents, the woman was a werewolf while the man was a werewildcat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, dear,&quot; the woman spoke without turning, &quot;will your new friend be joining us for breakfast?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe for a quick one,&quot; Ryan spoke as Connor noted the man turning to look to him, &quot;as he apparently was expected home sooner than I thought he would be...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you explain that these sorts of conversions can take time, son?&quot; the man asked as he shifted his glance from Connor to Ryan.<br />
<br />
&quot;I kind of thought that he would have known this already and explained that,&quot; Ryan answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s more my fault, sir,&quot; Connor spoke up, getting some sense that Ryan&#39;s father was thinking Ryan had done something wrong, &quot;I could have reminded Ryan of this last night after I was quite willingly welcomed into were-society, but... well... he and a friend of mine that moved here before my family did actually helped me sort through some personal questions and well, I let the joy at getting the answers to those questions confirmed go to my head. In that... I really wasn&#39;t thinking and just drifted off to sleep. It&#39;s not your son&#39;s fault.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure he&#39;s done nothing wrong,&quot; Ryan&#39;s father explained, &quot;and I would be happy to sponsor you as a pride member if you and Ryan become partners... but these things an be time consuming, and those coming into a relationship may be more likely to spend time together. As love is something that lengthen that sort of response.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s still more my fault, sir,&quot; Connor tried to explain, &quot;I could have reminded Ryan of my curfew earlier... but didn&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Ryan&#39;s father, &quot;and will you be joining us for breakfast?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A quick breakfast, yes,&quot; Connor answered, &quot;then I&#39;ll need to head home. If there are other things that may need to be handled with regard to pride membership, meetings, and so on, that can be handled later. Along with anything you may expect of me being involved with your son...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now, all I would expect is that you treat Ryan with respect and do him no harm,&quot; Ryan&#39;s father answered, &quot;you&#39;re both young. There is no need to rush into anything.&quot;</p>
