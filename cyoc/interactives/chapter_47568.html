<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once we reached our apartment and pulled into our parking space, Derek woke up in the car.  “Where are we?” he asked groggily.<br />
<br />
“Back at our place,” Valerie said.  “You just passed right out when we got in the car.  Did you drink too much?”<br />
<br />
“I guess so,” he said.  “I thought Jo said something before that, though.  Didn’t you?” he asked me.<br />
<br />
“No, I didn’t say anything,” I said.  I wished he’d just forget it so we could go inside.<br />
<br />
“Oh, it doesn’t matter,” he said.<br />
<br />
“Good!  Let’s go inside,” I said.<br />
<br />
When we got inside our apartment he remarked, “You guys have a pretty nice place.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks,” Valerie said.  “We do our best.  Let me show you my bedroom, since you’ve already seen Jo’s.”  Valerie grabbed Derek’s hand and took him into her bedroom.  I followed close behind and started to remove my dress.  As soon as Valerie pulled Derek into her room she turned around and planted a firm kiss on his lips.  He wasted no time in returning it.  <br />
<br />
They quickly removed their clothes as I finished undressing myself.  Valerie threw him down on the bed and immediately placed herself on Derek’s ready cock.  I moved onto the bed and straddled myself across his face so that he would eat out my pussy.  I made it so that I would come quickly and allow Valerie more time for pleasure.  I also had to play my part.  <br />
<br />
I got off the bed and whispered into Valerie’s ear, “Ready?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, yea,” she moaned.  I took that to mean two different things, so I made my wish.  I wished that Derek would slowly turn into a mannequin from feet to head and that while he was a mannequin he would be conscious for every second.  <br />
<br />
He and Valerie both climaxed as I finished my wish.  I looked at his feet and saw that they were both changing already.  The tan color of his feet was gradually replaced by a light gray color.  Valerie got off the bed and pulled Dennis up so that he was standing.  This way he would be in the proper position when he was frozen in place.<br />
<br />
“Dennis,” I said.  “Why did you call us ‘sluts’ to your friends at the club?”<br />
<br />
“What?” he asked.  He did not yet notice the changes.<br />
<br />
“I saw you at the club with your friends,” Valerie explained.  “You were telling them about this afternoon and you referred to us as ‘sluts.’  You know, I really liked you, Dennis.  That comment really hurt.”<br />
<br />
“I didn’t say that,” he lied.<br />
<br />
“Come, come, Dennis,” I said.  “Lying about it isn’t going to help you.  In fact,” I paused and looked at his feet.  They were totally gray now and the changes now moved to his ankles.  “In fact, nothing is going to help you right now.”<br />
<br />
“What are you talking about?” he asked.  “You’re acting crazy.”<br />
<br />
“Try to take a step,” Valerie said.  He looked at her with questioning eyes but obliged.  He clearly attempted to move his leg, but he was unable to lift his foot.  It was frozen in place and he had absolutely no control over it any longer.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck?” he asked.  He looked down at his feet and saw that they were different color.  He saw that different color spread up to his shins.  “What the fuck is going on?”<br />
<br />
“Since you don’t have much time, let me give you the quick version,” I said.  “I have a little toy that grants me wishes.  I’d give you a demonstration, but you’ve already had plenty.  It’s what brought you here and what whisked you back to your job this afternoon.  And it’s what is now going to turn you into a living mannequin.”<br />
<br />
“A mannequin?  You can’t do this!  I’ll fucking kill you!” he screamed.<br />
<br />
I felt that we were both safely beyond his reach, so I dared him.  “Try it,” I said.  He flailed wildly at us with both arms but was well short of grabbing either of us.  I was a little worried that he would use too much force and knock himself down.  Then we would have been forced to pick him up and that could have meant trouble.  Luckily his changed lower extremities kept him solidly in place.<br />
<br />
“See?” I asked.  “It’s hopeless.  Now, before you become totally inanimate, let me explain this to you.  We’re punishing you for playing kiss and tell.  Or rather, for playing kiss and tell and degrading us to your friends.  We didn’t care if you talked about us, but we don’t like being called names.  Especially when it’s totally unfair.  I’m sure you like to have sex and do it whenever you can, Derek, but nobody calls you names for it.  Why should we get that treatment because we’re women?  That’s the lesson you’ll need to learn while we have you imprisoned, so to speak.”<br />
<br />
“How are you going to get away with this?” he asked.  “People will look for me!”<br />
<br />
“I think not,” I said.  “I wish that no one will notice you are missing for as long as you are stuck as a mannequin.  I wish that your friends and family will not be concerned that they will not see or hear from you.  Furthermore, I wish that your job will think you’re on a leave of absence, and so will hold your job for you until we free you.  I also wish all of your affairs would be taken care of automatically so that bill collectors and the like won’t come looking for you either.  I think that covers everything.”<br />
<br />
The changes eclipsed his knees and now moved up his thighs.  Valerie said, “Hey, Jo, wouldn’t it be more fun for him to be stuck as a mannequin with his cock hard?”<br />
<br />
I looked at his cock and it had now returned to normal state.  “You’re right, Val,” I said.  “I wish that Derek’s cock will become hard and remain that way through his transformation.”  His cock instantly sprang to life and extended out to its full length.<br />
<br />
“Oh, goodie, now we can admire it every day!” Valerie joked.<br />
<br />
“A lot of good it will do you,” he snarled.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I don’t know,” Valerie said.  “I might find a way to enjoy myself with it.  Maybe I’ll just break it off, how’s that sound?”<br />
<br />
His eyes went wide with panic.  “You can’t do that!” he screamed.<br />
<br />
“I think we can do whatever we want,” I said.  “Which reminds me.  This is truly going to be an imprisonment for you, Derek.  You’re going to be conscious the whole time you’re a mannequin.  Now I don’t know if that means you’ll be able to see or hear everything we do around you, but you’ll have to live frozen in place as each second passes.”<br />
<br />
The changes moved quicker now.  His legs were completely changed and it now moved to his groin.  His cock and his ass were enveloped so that he was completely altered from the waist down.  “Please, stop,” he pleaded.  “I’m sorry, I was just running off at the mouth to impress my friends.  I’m sorry!”<br />
<br />
“No, you’re not,” Valerie said.  “You’re saying it because you’re in trouble, because you got caught.  You’re not in the least bit sorry.  But you will be.”<br />
<br />
“You better be,” I added.  “Because that’s the only way you’re going to get out of this.”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?” he asked as his stomach showed signs of the transformation.<br />
<br />
“Periodically we’ll unfreeze you, I guess you could say, to find out if you really are sorry,” I explained.  “I’m sure we can find that out easily enough.  And I don’t think you’ll be able to lie to us, either, so we’ll know when you’re sincere.  Until that time, you’re stuck.  Literally.”<br />
<br />
His fingers and hands froze and were covered by the gray color.  It spread to his arms as it also continued up his chest.  With his arms gradually locking into place, we could move closer to him.  We both touched the parts that had changed to find out what it felt like.  “Can you feel us touching you?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” he said with gritted teeth.<br />
<br />
“Good!  Then I know my wish is working how I want it to!” I said cheerfully.<br />
<br />
The changes moved to his shoulders and from there to his neck and throat.  Once he throat showed signs of the change, he opened his mouth to speak but no sounds came out.  “Looks like your vocal cords have failed you,” Valerie said.  I giggled at her observation.<br />
<br />
He looked at us with complete hate as the changes crept onto his face.  “Bye-bye, Derek, we’ll see you soon,” I said as his face and head was completely swallowed.  He stood there before us frozen in place, a perfect mannequin.  However, he wasn’t in a very good position right in front of Valerie’s bed.<br />
<br />
“I wonder how easy he’ll be to move,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Why don’t you just wish him to be light enough to move easily?” Valerie asked.<br />
<br />
I snapped my fingers.  “Yea, you’re right,” I said.  I wished what Valerie said.  We were then able to pick up Derek’s frozen body and move it at will.  Valerie wanted to keep him in her room so she moved him into a corner.  For the time being, she turned him around so that he faced the wall.  “Going with the grade school punishment, huh?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Yea, why not?” she smiled with amusement.  “Besides, he’s got a nice ass.”<br />
<br />
I made a fist and knocked on his ass a couple of times.  “Not quite rock hard, but close enough,” I commented.  We both laughed at that childish joke.<br />
<br />
Valerie picked up her clothes and took particular care of her dress as she hung it up in the closet.  I picked up my clothes and went into my room to do the same.  Valerie followed behind me and sat on my bed as I put away my dress.  Then I sat down next to her.  “What a day,” I commented.<br />
<br />
“Jo, can I ask you a question?” Valerie said.</p>
