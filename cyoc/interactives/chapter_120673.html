<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kate was guided to a large room with dim lighting. There was a door on the wall opposite to where she had entered, which was labeled &#39;Porcelain doll hair, makeup, and shoes&#39;. There were mannequins along the walls which displayed dresses, socks, and panties, all in matching sets. She wondered if any of the mannequins were originally human. Kate counted a total of 30 different outfits, and noticed they all had the same cotton panties. Below each one, was a red button labeled &#39;choose outfit&#39;. She looked around at all of the outfits, noticing some had socks, and some didn&#39;t<br />
<br />
The first one to catch her eye though, was an outfit that had a sleeveless white and light blue plaid dress, with light blue trim around the hem of the skirt, the neckline, and the shoulders. This one had a pair of white cotton ankle socks, with light blue trim around the ankle. She looked it over, examining its features. The dress looked very cute, and very looked very suitable for a tiny little doll.<br />
<br />
Kate pressed the button to choose it, and the door to the next room unlocked, opening on its own. It closed as Kate stepped through it. It was very similar to the previous room, except it was divided into three sections, which were labeled differently. She saw &#39;Shoes&#39;, &#39;Makeup&#39;, and &#39;Hair&#39;. There was another door on the opposite wall that was labeled &#39;Porcelain doll accessories&#39;. Kate went over to the hair section first, and saw mannequin heads on torsos displaying different hairstyles of wigs, each with four colors; Ginger, Blonde, Brunette, and Black.<br />
<br />
She stopped on one hairstyle that she particularly liked. It was a wig of straight brunette hair that reached down to the mannequin torsos waist. It shone beautifully in the dim light of the room. Kate decided she wanted this hairstyle, since it would be simple, and pressed the red button below it. <br />
<br />
Satisfied with her choice, Kate on to the makeup section. Here, she could choose her blush color, her lip color, and how doll-like her eyelashes would be. She decided to go with pink blush, cherry red lips, and the most doll-like eyelashes she could find. Kate pressed the red button, and went over to the shoes section.<br />
<br />
There was only one style she had to pick from, and that style was Mary-Janes shoes. The shoes were all lined up, with the color choice being black. The shoes were lined up by how tall their heels were, which went from flat, all the way to 4 inches tall. Kate couldn&#39;t decide on how tall the heel would be. She didn&#39;t want it to be 4 inches, because that would be too tall for a doll, but she didn&#39;t want it to be flat either. Eventually, she decided on a 2-1/2 inch heel, and pressed the button for it, which opened the door to the next room.<br />
<br />
Kate walked in, and was greeted by another large room, this time with four sections. The sections were labeled &#39;Gloves&#39;, &#39;Hair accessories&#39;, &#39;Props&#39;, and &#39;hats and bonnets&#39;. She noticed that the door labeled &#39;Finished; on the other wall had a red button beside it, making her wonder if this room was completely optional.<br />
<br />
She went over to the gloves section first, and saw three rows of different length gloves with different colored trims along the cuffs. Kate already made her mind up, though, and pressed the button for a pair of wrist-length gloves with light blue trim around the cuffs. <br />
<br />
The hair accessories section was right next to the gloves section, so that&#39;s where Kate went. Once again, there were mannequins with the different hairstyles and lengths, but they were all white. Each hairstyle had its own accessory that matched it really well. The long and straight hairstyle that Kate had chosen had a big ribbon tied into a bow in the middle of the hair over the back of the mannequin&#39;s head. Kate pressed the button for the light blue one, and moved on to the props section.<br />
<br />
There was a warning label on the section, which said to hold the prop before taking the transformation pill or shot, or else you wouldn&#39;t be able to have it as part of your outfit. Looking over the props though, Kate didn&#39;t find any that really interested her, so she moved on to the hats and bonnets section.<br />
<br />
Kate saw that the hats and bonnets section consisted of only sun bonnets and sun hats. She wasn&#39;t particularly interested in either of those, so she moved on, and pressed the button beside the door. It opened to a changing room, which had all of the clothes for her outfit on a mannequin, and all of her makeup on a small table next to the mannequin. There was a chute beside it that read &#39;Unneeded clothes&#39;. Kate stripped down, and tossed all of her clothes into the chute.<br />
<br />
She decided to start with the wig, took it off the mannequin, and looked at it for a moment. It had the hair accessory she chose to have already tied into the hair. Kate shrugged, and put her own hair up as she placed the wig on her head. She looked in the mirror, and turned to the side, loving how shiny and neat the hair was. Kate felt a tingling on her head, and saw the wig sink in, replacing her own hair. She ran her hand through it, and could feel it as she did.<br />
<br />
Next, Kate pulled the dress off of the mannequin, and laid it down on the bench. She pulled the panties down the mannequins legs, and stepped into them. They were very soft and comfortable, fitting her perfectly. Kate modeled them in the mirror for a few seconds before giggling to herself. She picked up the dress, and pulled it over herself, looking in the mirror as she finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, this is a really cute dress.&quot; Kate said aloud. She twirled a little bit, making the skirt flare out as she spun. The dress was so soft, and was very comfortable. Kate felt a small heat around her waist momentarily, and pulled the skirt up. The panties had sewn into the dress, trapping Kate inside it. She didn&#39;t care, though. She would be a doll soon enough, and it wouldn&#39;t matter if the panties and dress were together.<br />
<br />
She moved on to the socks and shoes, slipping the socks off of the mannequin&#39;s feet, and bringing the shoes in front of her. She slipped her feet into the socks, and saw them visibly shrink to what she assumed to be size 4. Looking at the shoes, she saw that they were around 4. Kate shrugged, and slipped her feet into the shoes, and stood up. The heel was relatively tall for size 4, but they weren&#39;t uncomfortable. It was the opposite actually, the shoes were very comfortable. Kate was really loving her outfit, spending a few minutes modeling it before remembering she still had her gloves and makeup to put on. <br />
<br />
With that thought, she move on to the makeup, starting with the blush. She wanted the stereotypical doll look, so she applied the blush in circles on her cheeks. She moved on to the lipstick, and laid it on thick, making her lips a nice cherry red color. Next, she applied the fake eyelashes, which replaced her own, giving her doll-like eyelashes. Curious, she tried to wipe off her makeup, but when she pulled her hand away, it had nothing on it. This make Kate smile.<br />
<br />
Last were the gloves. She pulled them off of the mannequin&#39;s hands, and slipped them onto her own. She saw her hands shrink, just like her feet did when she put the socks on, until she had small hands. Her fingers further slenderized, making her hands look very delicate and even more feminine than before. <br />
<br />
Kate opened the changing room door, and found that it opened to another examination room, which was not unlike the one from before. Professor Juniper was sitting in the rolling chair, typing on her laptop. Kate stepped forward, her heels clicking on the tile floor. Professor Juniper looked up, and looked her outfit over before giving her a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look very pretty,&quot; She remarked before handing Kate a white pill, &quot;Alright, there you go. All you need to do is swallow this pill, and wait. There&#39;s a mirror behind the door if you want to watch your changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Kate said, &quot;I&#39;d like a little privacy for this, is that okay?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I&#39;ll leave for a few minutes.&quot; Professor Juniper answered, before standing up and leaving the room. She closed the door behind her as Kate swallowed the pill whole. It went down easy, but Kate had a moment of shock as it went down her throat. She was really going to be a small, adorable, porcelain doll.<br />
<br />
She felt her changes start, and looked at herself in the full-body mirror, watching as she changed.</p>
