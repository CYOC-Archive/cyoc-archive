<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It&#39;s been some time after you&#39;ve become the leader of this herd of triceratops.<br />
Some younglings have tried to best you and take over, but it&#39;s impossible, a simple push is enough to throw them away. You&#39;re just way too strong.<br />
<br />
After some weeks, however, you feel a strange sensation in your groins, a longing feel. Of course, it&#39;s mating season, and walking across this new land you&#39;ve seen countless couples and nesting zones which make you feel empty, and over all, lonely.<br />
<br />
There&#39;s couples in your herd that are already copulating, you see and hear them at night time, and this just deepens your loneliness. <br />
Your loins express this sensations as pheromones, and naturally, some females approach you. They&#39;re certainly eager to be mounted by you and bear your eggs, but deep down something in your brain doesn&#39;t let you accept their offer.  Excuses vary, they&#39;re too young, you&#39;re too old, you don&#39;t need to mate yet, among many others.<br />
<br />
Whatever is the case, one such night during a sleeping shift, you wake up with a faint noise. Standing up quietly, you soon move away from the herd by yourself trying not to make a noise.<br />
<br />
You follow the faint noise, and you make your way across a dense patch of jungle, only to find the edges of the genie&#39;s Dinosaur Park, you try to not catch the attention of the lights and the guards, with your transformation, came the instinct to avoid the edges at all costs, it&#39;s a forbidden place.<br />
<br />
The noise appears to be cries, and they come from deep within the walls of the edges, ignoring one of your most basic instincts, you quickly gallop your way to the walls, and come across a giant gate, loud cries heard from within.<br />
<br />
You sit down and think, waiting for options, until thanks to the fortunate chaos caused by a fight breaking out within spinosaurus not far away, the guards get distracted and ride a strange vehicle to address the situation. With the area empty, you take a risky choice, and with all your might, pierce the gate walls with one of your horns, easily going through the metal door, and push it aside with all your strength. You release the gate and quickly enter the mysterious, dark place.<br />
<br />
All you see is darkness, until you can hear the cries loud and clear. Following the noise, you stand in disbelief in front of a huge cage. You approach the cage only to be startled by a loud thump against it, using your still human intelligence, you press a nearby switch, and all the lights and some screens turn on. <br />
<br />
Then you realize. Crying in the cage is a huge triceratops, sitting down in the corner, held by large chains. You see bruises and scars all over it&#39;s body. It&#39;s face looks tired and worn out, but otherwise is in a remarkably good shape, large and muscular. You walk close but the creature just roars back at you and backs up as much as it can.<br />
<br />
Turning your view to the screens that lighten up the room, you see footage of this triceratops. You see what appears to be an arena, and you see it get cornered by all kinds of dangerous dinosaurs. You see it shrug off the attack of a pack of Deinonychus, another instance shows it bring to the ground a pair of Allosaurs, and most impressively, you see a big screen show a full stadium, and this sturdy Triceratops fight off a Tyrannosaurus, and push it against one of the walls, knocking it out.<br />
<br />
You stare back at the cage. Was the genie behind all this? You don&#39;t care, you just approach the cage again and see your fellow Triceratops roar back at you in anger and fear. You can tell it doesn&#39;t want to fight. It&#39;s too tired. <br />
You feel bad for the creature, it&#39;s been forced to fight for sick entertainment for who knows how long. <br />
You see a tag on the lock of the cage.<br />
&quot;Enhanced Triceratops horridus.<br />
40 feet, 20,000lbs.<br />
Nickname: &#39;Cherry&#39;<br />
Female.&quot;<br />
Not thinking twice, you strike the lock of the gate and open it&#39;s door. The Triceratops cries in fear, and whimpers, like it&#39;s expecting to be hit, but instead, you stomp the chain with force, and slowly back out of the cage. <br />
<br />
She slowly stands up and stays still, expecting you to harm her somehow. She doesn&#39;t know affection. She&#39;s been breed to fight, and every day gets dragged out of her cage to enter the arena. <br />
She looks back at the broken chain and the cage lock. Her eyes look intelligent. She&#39;s wide and tall, almost as much as you, a few feet short. Her skin is a light gray, and she has light red marks across her back and her frills. Her horns stand proud and strong, and her muscular legs extend and retract with every step. <br />
<br />
While you walk next to her through the dark place, you look at her in the light of the moon, her eyes bright, her scales shiny. You have a new kind of feeling. You&#39;re...<br />
Your thoughts are interrupted when you see she&#39;s completely out of the dark place within the walls of the edge. She touches the dirt with her fingers before rolling on it and throttling around.<br />
You slowly follow behind her and you&#39;re both now in the thick patch of jungle you&#39;ve been before.<br />
She doesn&#39;t dare to get in there, so you stand next to her and open a path for her with your horns. She looks content with this and walks in by your side.<br />
<br />
You both walk through the forest, and you often feel her body slightly touch yours.<br />
Soon she moves away and sits down in a clearing. You follow her and sit by her side.<br />
She looks up at the moon and breathes softly. You do the same, and notice she&#39;s looking at you now.<br />
You slowly lower your view and look back at her.<br />
You both contemplate each other for a moment.<br />
You don&#39;t know if it&#39;s your new hormones or something, but you can&#39;t keep your eyes out of her. She&#39;s majestic. Her shiny white scales are bright with the moonlight. Her strong muscular legs are comfortably retracted under her, her wide body looks soft and warm, and her horns and frill are glistening with the faint blue light. Her eyes are your favorite spot though, shiny, clever. You can see her soul reflected in them. They remind you of yourself.<br />
Days ago, you could only see these creatures in movies and books, but now not only you&#39;re one yourself, but you are in front of the most beautiful creature you&#39;ve ever seen.<br />
You don&#39;t even realize you&#39;re just a few inches away from her before you feel a warm, wet feeling on the front of your snout.<br />
A kiss.<br />
Opening your mouth with the same rhythm as her, your lips suddenly meet and your tongues slowly caress each other.<br />
A strangely human interaction from what seems to be just two simple beasts.<br />
You close your eyes as you feel her thick tongue explore your mouth, and as you do the same to her. You lock lips and feel as much as you can from each other. The sheer size of your features is enough to make this better than any human experience of the same kind you&#39;ve had before, but the musky, bestial feel adds even more to it.<br />
<br />
Your groins get bothered by this, you can feel Cherry put a paw on your side as your genitals snake out of your sheath. You start panting in need. Your body has already chosen her. Cherry nods as she slowly stands up and moved her thick tail to the side.<br />
You can clearly see her tight, scaly cloaca, and your cock expands even more, pumping with need to fulfill your role as a bull. You soon stand up and mount her, she looks back and whimpers as she feels your large, thick organ slide across her buttocks, which feels extremely pleasurable, her hinds are plump, soft, and enormous. It doesn&#39;t take long for you to find your way in, as you both black out for a moment and growl in pleasure.<br />
<br />
You&#39;ve never felt better, you pant and let your wide tongue out as you enjoy the feeling of mounting your mate. Her thick muscles squeeze you harder and her strong legs don&#39;t have problems supporting your weight. Your human side is in awe. Not only it&#39;s extremely pleasurable to give your thick cock release in a warm, wet hole, but it&#39;s the warm wet hole of YOUR mate, the largest female triceratops ever. You grab her harder as you get rougher. You both know what&#39;s coming and she nods in approval.<br />
You both roar in unison as you share an orgasm, your thick load flooding her canals.<br />
Your animal side is proud to having claimed such a strong female, and you&#39;re proud to call her your mate, the queen to your realm.<br />
<br />
You find yourself cuddling next to her next to a clear puddle in a calm forest clearing. After licking her wounds and scars, you both share an affectionate nuzzle. &quot;I love you.&quot; a cute, soft voice coming from her.<br />
Surprisingly, you don&#39;t even notice she can speak. From the moment you saw her you knew she wasn&#39;t really an animal.<br />
&quot;I love you too.&quot; You say.<br />
And as you two embrace in another soft kiss, you feel at peace knowing both of you will never be alone again in this new world.</p>
