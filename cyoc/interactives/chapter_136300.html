<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After what seemed like hours of senseless fucking, Mark and Ty heard a deafening roar nearby. They saw the now gigantic Dustin explode with growth from far away. Mark could not believe his eyes, his own son, reaching true godhood. Envy boiled within him, in no way would he ever allow himself to be surpassed by him. <br />
&quot;NOOOOOOOO!&quot;<br />
He roared in anger at the titan.<br />
Then he heard a voice in the back of his head.<br />
&quot;Come to me, Mark.&quot;<br />
Mark suddenly stopped screaming and listened.<br />
&quot;I can give you the power that you need&quot;<br />
The voice seductively whispered to him, but there was no one in sight. Still Mark felt the call, his need for power was taking him over. He had no choice, he had to listen.<br />
&quot;Come to my realm!&quot;<br />
The voice excitedly said. Mark had a feeling he knew where to go. His anger kept him focused enough to be able to exit this realm. He left Ty there, who was still affected by the corrupting mist. Mark felt the temperature rise as he was drawn to a new realm. It was a huge plain with a single mountain in the middle. Mark could see demons of all shape and form constantly climbing the mountain. At the top of it was the source of his call. It was a gigantic Greatsword planted at the top of the mountain. A blade of pure black with a twisted shape that reached more than 100ft tall. The hilt was shaped like the face of a roaring demon, Mark could feeling it screaming at his soul. <br />
&quot;I AM LEVIATHAN, LORD OF ENVY. WEILD ME IF YOU DARE! SHOW ME HOW MUCH YOU NEED MY POWER!&quot;<br />
Mark got hard at the sight of the powerful soul within the blade. This was his only chance, he had to reach the sword.<br />
<br />
He took off and flew directly towards the top of the mountain. He could see the sword radiating huge waves of heat all around it, even though he was a mile away, he could feel the heat rising as he approached it. It quickly became hard to breathe and to keep focus, but his need for power kept him going. All around him he saw demons dying from exhaustion and some even burning alive. Once Mark was 200ft from the sword, he screamed in pain until he suddenly caught fire. The pain was overwhelming, he then noticed that the souls from all those demons dying around him were sucked into the eternally hungry mouth of the sword. Mark finally caught fire also, his wings burning first.<br />
&quot;ARRGGHH&quot;<br />
He quickly fell onto the hard rocky mountain and got pushed around by demons trying to reach the summit.<br />
&quot;I NEED THE POWER!&quot;<br />
Mark screamed as he started climbing. His 20ft tall body carried him quicker than the other demons and so they ganged up on him, pulling his legs back to try to stop him from taking the sword for himself. &quot;THE SWORD IS MINE!&quot; Mark screamed as he bashed them with his fists. &quot;YOU&#39;RE NOT TAKING THIS FROM ME!&quot; He roared as blood spewed from the demons and covered his whole body. He then kept climbing, driven by envy and anger until he finally reached the summit.<br />
Mark gasped in surprise when he saw a demon already by the sword. A 22ft tall muscle bound demon anthro-shark smiled in anticipation at him. &quot;Well you made it, just like I hoped you would.&quot; Mark could see no soul in this demon, but still he felt Leviathan&#39;s presence in him. &quot;I need to kill, conquer, dominate everything!&quot; The shark walked towards Mark while jerking his massive dick. &quot;And you look like you share those needs too&quot; The shark put a hand on Marks massive pecs and rubbed their dicks together. The heat started to dissipate around them as Mark got horny at the sight of this beast. &quot;No one will stand in our way&quot; the shark whispered in Marks ear while furiously jerking off his dick. &quot;YESSSSSS! NO ONE!&quot; Mark roared as he pulled the shark in and kissed him like a beast. He then flipped the shark around like he was nothing and trust inside his ass. The shark screamed in pain but was quickly overcome in pleasure as someone finally dominated him. &quot;Haaaa Haaaa Haaaa WEILD ME MARK!&quot; Mark then trust directly on Leviathan&#39;s prostate making him scream in pleasure. This then triggered a huge explosion of heat around them, instantly killing all demons within 500ft. &quot;YES! KILL THEM ALL! SHOW THEM WHO THEIR GOD IS!&quot; This turned him on more than anything else. For every trust after that, the explosions increased in size. Mark then felt the souls of the demons he killed enter his hulking body. &quot;YEEEEEEESSSSSS!&quot; He screamed, his skin turning darker and darker as he let his thought get overcome by the need to kill and dominate everything. Deeper and deeper he trust in the shark&#39;s asshole as he felt his body growing by absorbing more souls. &quot;YESSSSS BECOME MY WORTHY VESSEL MARK.&quot; A red fire started forming inside Mark, it was starting to become visible in his mouth and eyes. &quot;NOTHING WILL EVER SURPASS US!&quot; Then, a jet black armor started forming on Mark. It also seemed to grow with him as he absorbed more souls. It looked like a full plate mail that covered his entire body except for his dick and balls. He was now reaching 50ft tall and was close to reaching the hit of the sword. The shark was growing with him. &quot;YES! HMMMMM YES! YES! FUCK ME MARK! MAKE US WHOLE!&quot; The explosions now covered more than a mile and Mark could feel waves upon waves of souls entering him. His armor reflected Mark&#39;s evil as wicked horns grew on the shoulders and arms. The waist took the shape of a huge opened demonic mouth. &quot;WE WILL KILL EVERYONE WHO OPPOSES US!&quot; Mark roared as deep red eyes formed on his armor, right under his pecs. This formed a demonic face similar to the sword. Finally a full helmet covered his face with wicked curved horns. Only a deep red fire could be seen instead of his face now. With his transformation complete, Leviathan could not contain his excitment anymore. &quot;HAAAAAAAAA CUMMMIIINNNNGGGGG!&quot; At the same time, Mark finally reached 90ft and was able to grasp the sword fully. This made his strength increase exponentially. &quot;ROOOOOOAAAAAAARRRRRRRR&quot; Mark finally pulled the sword from the mountain. This triggered a massive explosion, killing everyone still alive in the realm. &quot;HAHAHAHAHA MOOOORRREEEE!&quot; He screamed as all the souls entered his body. Fire came out of his mouth as his form expanded in all directions. &quot;MORE! MORE! MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE!&quot; His muscles grew so much he became almost as wide as he was tall. Mark roared as a final explosion put him at 140ft tall. Thick red cum spewed from his dick and covered half of the mountain. An aura of red fire now covered his whole body as his armor and sword smiled devilishly. &quot;NO ONE CAN STOP ME!&quot; He screamed as he swinged his sword on the mountain, destroying it completely.</p>
