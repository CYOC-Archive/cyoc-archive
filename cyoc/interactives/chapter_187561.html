<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rebecca was not having a very good day. After she mutated she had been evacuated from her building and watched as the medical team tore off an entire wall to get one of her tenets out, since they had grown gargantuan assets and had been the source of the cum that infect not only her, but a dozen of her other tenets and their guests. The fact that she would be given generous financial assistance to fix the damages did little to lessen the frustration at her predicament. <br />
<br />
	Her examination at the hospital was just as bad, the doctor telling her that she would most likely need a caretaker to assist her now that she lacked arms. This diagnosis was the final blow that  broke her, as Rebecca was always proud of how she had managed to live independently after graduation. Due to the lack of staff at the hospital however, she was still sent to the hotel with a note to inform the staff their that she needed to be assigned a caregiver. In a moment of defiance to her fate, Rebecca threw the note, which had been placed in her mouth, into the bushes before she crawled into to hotel. Determined to find a way to take care of herself despite her lack of arms, the slug-taur got a single room and began finding a way to manipulate objects. After lots of practice, she had managed to use her three-foot long cock-tongue to grab a pen and write a few messy words.<br />
<br />
	By the time Rebecca had managed that however, a few hours had passed and she could no longer ignore her growing hunger. After a much to long crawl to the buffet hall, which was luckily still open so newly arriving mutants could get something to eat, Rebecca encountered another problem: she was short. Since her slug body was parallel to the ground, her head was less than three feet off the floor, making most tables designed for average height people taller than her. Of course since this hotel was designed to accommodate people of varying forms, there were special stools to allow short guests to reach the buffet tables, even ones with ramps that Rebecca could comfortably crawl up, but moving one of these stools over with her tongue, which was much weaker than her arms were, would be a challenge. With a long and awkward struggle, which made Rebecca glad that very few people were around at this time of night, she managed to pull a ramped stool up to the buffet table. When she crawled up the ramp however, the enormity of her task truly dawned on her. Just to get herself something to eat, she would need to grab a plate, put the food on it and then carry it all over to a table, all with her single clumsy cock-tongue. The fact that even something as simple as feeding herself was now a herculean task due to her body caused Rebecca to despair. <br />
<br />
	As Rebecca stood in silence in front of the buffet, barely holding back her tears, two other mutants approached her. One was a woman with reptilian limbs and membrane wings, while the other was a woman with cat-like features, as well as horns and a strangely thick tail. They wore matching grey T-shirts and track pants altered to fit the particulars of their anatomy. The two woman saw Rebecca&#39;s downcast face and approached her.<br />
<br />
	“Hey cutie, need a bit of help?” asked the feline woman. When Rebecca didn&#39;t respond, she shot a serious look over at her friend and the wyvern-woman grabbed a plate and began filling it with food from the buffet. As her friend worked, the cat-girl grabbed Rebecca around her stomach, between her middle and lower pair of breasts, and lifted her over to a seat at one of the normal sized tables. Shortly after that her friend arrived with a plate covered in food and placed it in front of Rebecca before both woman sat down on either side of the slug-taur. <br />
<br />
	“My names Steffany, and this here is Vicky, you look like your having a bad day so why don&#39;t you let us take care of you for a bit.” Rebecca made to refuse the feline woman&#39;s offer, but found her open mouth being stuffed with some kind of savoury appetizer.<br />
<br />
	“Just forget about your problems for a moment and let yourself get fed by two beautiful women” purred Steffany, already holding another bite-sized appetizer in her hand.<br />
<br />
	Steffany&#39;s words finally caused Rebecca to break, she began to openly sob as she let the two woman take turns feeding her more of the appetizers. Once she was satisfied, she began to tell the two kind women her story, about how she was now unable to take care of herself and how worthless she now felt. Steffany and Vicky simply sat and listened to her rant, letting her work through her emotions without interfering. When she had finished, the two woman looked at each other and came a a silent agreement.<br />
<br />
	“Would you like to join us in our room for some &#39;stress relief&#39; Rebecca?” offered Vicky, her inflection leaving no room to misinterpret her meaning.<br />
<br />
	Before her mutation, Rebecca would have never considered sleeping with another woman, let alone two, but right now she was desperate for something to distract her from her woes and sex with two hot woman seemed like a very good distraction.<br />
<br />
	Once she agreed to their offer, the two women wasted no time in bringing her to their room, Steffany holding her in a bridal carry as she marched down the hall. Steffany gently laid her passenger down on the rooms only bed before she and Vicky stripped down naked, revealing the manitcore-woman&#39;s ten-inch barbed cock and hefty balls. As Rebecca took in her soon-to-be lover&#39;s naked bodies, her cock-tongue began to grow hard in her mouth, extending to it&#39;s full three-foot length and rendering the slug-taur unable to speak without her words becoming muffled. <br />
<br />
	Without another word, the two women crawled onto the bed and began getting Rebecca ready for them. Steffany parted Rebecca&#39;s lower breasts and began licking at her pussy while Vicky coated her hands in lube and stroked the slug-taur&#39;s cock-tongue from tip to base. This foreplay continued for a while longer before all three women were ready for the main event. Vicky stood up and guided Rebecca&#39;s cock into her pussy, the wyvern-woman slowly working herself down towards Rebecca&#39;s face. Steffany meanwhile, had found a good angle and eagerly thrust her feline cock into Rebecca&#39;s waiting slit. Rebecca&#39;s two lovers quickly got into steady rhythm, Steffany thrusting her cock while Vicky pushed herself further down. After several minutes of this, Vicky finally had all of Rebecca&#39;s cock inside her, the still slightly flexible appendage curled up inside her 4&#39;11&#39;&#39; frame. As Rebecca found the wyvern-woman&#39;s push ass pressed against her face, she reached her limit and came from both her cock and pussy simultaneously, causing both her lovers to climax soon after.<br />
<br />
	As all three women lay together, recovering from their lovemaking, Vicky made a surpising offer.<br />
<br />
	“Me and Stef were gonna go on a date once we got out of quarantine, how would you like to join us Rebecca?”<br />
<br />
	Rebecca thought about how she would need to be cared for for the rest of her life, how their would always be things she simply couldn&#39;t do anymore. At first she hated this, losing her independence was something Rebecca feared more than anything else, but if these two were the ones giving her that assistance, maybe she could accept living like this.<br />
<br />
	“I would love to” she replied.</p>
