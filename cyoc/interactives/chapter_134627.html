<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When the ball rang, and class was finally over, Ty put his books in his bag and he walked out of the classroom. He wandered around the crowded hallway, enjoying the views, the sights and the sounds of all the busy students wandering around the wide corridor. Since he had a free class period, Ty decided to just take a seat on one of the wooden benches and lean against the brick wall as he quietly observed the people as they walked by him. From where he was sitting, he had a great view of the long row of lockers, he saw the bathrooms down the hall, and he could view the entrance to the cafeteria. <br />
<br />
While he sat there, he observed students walking or running down the hall since they were late to their next class. He also saw students who needed to make a trip to the bathroom. Furthermore, he spotted an occasional student who had to get something out of his or her locker. Finally, he would eye someone walking over to the wooden bench on the opposite side of the hallway from him. It gave him a great view of a student who was lonely or angry or tired, since every student always had a special reason for sitting down on a hard, wooden bench in the middle of the hallway. <br />
<br />
So, TY sat there, holding his cell phone in his hand. He would surf the web, text his friends and check up on his favorite songs and YouTube videos while nobody else was around to grab his attention. <br />
<br />
He would quietly sit there, all by himself, seated on the wooden bench and leaning with his back against the brick wall, until somebody would walk by him or until somebody would sit down on the other bench. <br />
<br />
Then, it finally happened. One girl with red hair and wearing blue jeans and a t-shirt walked up and sat down on the bench right across from him. She had a sad expression on her face as she looked around to see if anybody else was around before she sat down. <br />
<br />
A minute later, three boys walked by, talking about their recent game on the basketball team. One boy was dribbling a basketball as the boys wandered through the hallway. The boys were totally into sports and they were discussing the next game. <br />
<br />
“Dude! I scored three points in our game! And I only played for two minutes!”<br />
<br />
“Hey! I played for 10 minutes man! I down four three-pointers!” <br />
<br />
“We’re going out-of-town for the next game, guys! Get ready for a ten-hour-long bus ride!” <br />
<br />
Ty could tell that the lonely girl was feeling a bit envious of the three boys. Why could three guys have so much fun hanging out and talk about sports when she was always feeling lonely? Ty was able to use his powers and find out what she was thinking. <br />
<br />
Then, only four minutes later, four boys walked by. All four of them were wearing their soccer jerseys. <br />
<br />
“Guys! We’re playing in the southwest invitational tournament! How cool is that?” one boy said. <br />
<br />
“I hope we get to play in that new soccer stadium!” <br />
<br />
“Yeah that is so awesome!” <br />
<br />
The girl on the bench almost teared up. She wanted to be a part of a sports team very badly. But, there were no big sports teams for girls at the high school. The only notable thing for girls was the Cheerleading squad and she hated that! <br />
<br />
Finally, two boys wandered down the hall and stopped right near Ty as they got something from a locker. These boys were tall and very muscular. They were wearing shorts and tank tops. They had very muscular physiques and their large muscles were clearly visible. Both boys appeared to be about 16 years old. <br />
<br />
“Man, we could enter into the statewide bodybuilding competition, Jerry!” the first boy said. <br />
<br />
“I know, but we need one more competitor. Each school needs three participants and we only got two. I wish we had one more muscle guy on our team who could join us, then we could sign up. We can’t even sign up with only two guys!” Kyle replied. “We’re one guy short!” <br />
<br />
The poor girl gulped when she heard that. She wished she was a boy. A young, buff muscle boy. Instead, she was a short, skinny, redhead girl with acne all over face. She felt ugly, short and unattractive. She was lonely and depressed. She felt like she had no purpose and no friends in school. She just existed, but nobody talked to her and nobody cared about her. <br />
<br />
Ty found out that her name was Jane and she was very lonely. Jane continuously saw how boys were hanging out and having fun and talking about sports. They were always bonding together and having a great time while she was always alone. She hated being a girl and she just wanted more than every to be part of a team, like a boy. <br />
<br />
“Time for Jane to get happy…. And to become a big, happy, muscle boy!” Ty wished quietly, as he watched Jane from across the hallway from where he was sitting. <br />
<br />
The instant Ty made his wish, Jane was overcome by that weird, intense tingling sensation. <br />
<br />
Jane suddenly felt her chest bulge as her pectorals pushed outwards while her breasts flattened out. At the same time, her chest became hard with big, round, hard spheres of muscle. As her shoulders widened, her flat stomach was suddenly covered with ridges and valleys making up her thick, hard abdominal muscles! She was now sporting her washboard abs like a young bodybuilder!<br />
<br />
“Hey…. What… What’s going on?” she whispered to herself while Ty was looking on with a grin. She quietly lifted up her shirt and admired her rock-hard six-pack, even as Ty looked on with a chuckle. <br />
<br />
Next, Jane’s arms filled out with muscle, power and strength! Her biceps and triceps became so big and hard, that she burst out of her shirt sleeves! She felt STRONG! She moved her thick, heavy strong arms. It felt weird but GOOD. She couldn’t understand what was going on, but it felt… amazing!<br />
<br />
Next, Jane’s thin quads began to fill out as they hardened and grew wider and thicker with muscle. Her quads were now completely filled out with mighty cords of muscle, running from her waist to hew knees. Lastly, her thin calves inflated like helium balloons and grew to the size of big, heavy balls of muscle the size melons while covered with veins all over! It was incredible! <br />
<br />
The last thing that happened was that her female organ vanished and was quickly replaced with a big, long, hard male penis. Her new, 9-inch cock was rock hard, and she had two thick, hard testicles hanging from its base. Technically, she was now a GUY!<br />
<br />
Ty noticed how Jane was feeling a bit scared and confused so he made another wish. He wanted Jane to only remember always having been a muscle boy from now on and that his name would be John from this point forward. <br />
<br />
Finally, Ty changed John’s clothes to a tank top, a pair of gym shorts and sneakers. John was a gym rat and a teen bodybuilder who always worked out in the gym! He was 16 years old and he was the new guy in school, so nobody knew about him yet. <br />
<br />
John got up from the wooden bench and walked up to Kyle and Jerry.<br />
<br />
“Yo, guys! I heard… You guys are looking for someone on the bodybuilding team?” John said to them. <br />
<br />
Both Jerry and Kyle turned around and examined the new boy from head to toe. <br />
<br />
“Uhh… Yeah!” Kyle said calmly. “Who… What’s your name? I’ve never seen you here before!” <br />
<br />
“I’m John… I’m new here… But, I’ve been lifting weights since I was thirteen… I’ve been into bodybuilding for the last three years! Can I be on your team?” <br />
<br />
Kyle and Jerry looked at each other with a huge grin on their faces. <br />
<br />
“Wow! You just made my day! We can enter in a contest if you join us!” Jerry cheered. <br />
<br />
“That is so cool! Join the club, dude!” Kyle smiled. <br />
<br />
Then, Kyle, Jerry and John continued to walk down the hall, talking about the bodybuilding contest as they strolled their way over to the gym. <br />
<br />
Ty looked on and he couldn’t be happier. He transformed that poor, lonely girl into a happy, outgoing muscle boy, and the results were amazing!<br />
<br />
Ty decided to stay in the hallway and to just kick back as he watched other students walk by. Maybe he would get lucky and meet another student who could use his help?</p>
