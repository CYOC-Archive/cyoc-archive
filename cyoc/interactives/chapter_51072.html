<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Of course, Isabelle needed some minor first aid for being 'stabbed' in the back by the faux <br />
diamond doorknob by Randy's failed escape charge. Thankfully all it amounted to was an <br />
nasty bruise which Kaylee's rudimentary first aid was more than able to handle.<br />
<br />
Pearl kept an eye on their children while June stayed with their mate so he wouldn't have to <br />
get up if he wanted anything before Julie had a chance to look him over. This had been <br />
June's idea.<br />
<br />
June knew her focus on Zack was part of the Dare Pearl had placed on her. But June didn't <br />
care. 'We're all already brainwashed to love Master and be loyal to the pack. What does one <br />
more piece of brainwashing matter?' June was just glade now that Zack was 'debugged' <br />
that she wouldn't have to chose between her loyalty to Zack and loyalty to the Master.<br />
<br />
Kaylee's single desire after the transformation of Zack's parents was to turn on the sound <br />
system and play 'All Night Long!' through the speakers, take one of the wine bottle <br />
through of the mini-bars strategically placed throughout the house and chug the bottle <br />
and do the high-land fling, but this time with no embarrassment or shame like when Kat <br />
had Dared Kyle to naked below the waist at school.  'After all, the shadows are going to <br />
take Glendale's business world by storm, Jack and Marcine will provide us with a lifetime <br />
supply of venison, the six gargoyles could stop a SWAT Team, the gem-wolves have got <br />
our island retreat covered, we're immune to having our wolf selves stolen from us ever, <br />
and Zack's kids means we don't need to use the game to add to the pack anymore. WE <br />
WIN!'<br />
<br />
However she had planned to spend today with her cubs and that was precisely what she <br />
intended to do. She did feel that with Martha with Alice and her cousins/sisters meant she <br />
did feel somewhat like she was watching a cousin's kids for them as she led Amy and <br />
Zelipe to their new playmates. They were pleasant to be around, but she didn't get the <br />
same sheer endearment and wholeness she got around her own children.<br />
<br />
She walked over to the couch behind the space in front of the Wii where her children had <br />
gathered, &quot;Everyone, Bart, Jenny, Marcy, Kevin, these are your new pack mates. They aren't <br />
my or your father's children like Alice and her sisters, but they are part of our pack and <br />
you should treat them with respect.&quot;<br />
<br />
The seven year old Marcy and Kevin kept looking at how the eight year old Amy moved like <br />
a snowflake on a gentle winter breeze, while the nine year old Jenny kept eying her almost <br />
antagonistically. Bart looked at while Zelipe was acting a little shy around the other <br />
children and thought, 'Okay, got another one I gotta introduce to the boy's club proper.'<br />
<br />
&quot;Konichiwa to you all.&quot; Amy bowed politely.<br />
<br />
Everyone tilted their heads but Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;That means good afternoon in Japanese.&quot; Jenny said simply, &quot;Don't try to impress <br />
everyone by being fancy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am merely being polite.&quot; Amy said with no trace of hostility or ego.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice ta mecha, I'm Bart, you're Zelipe right? That's my brother Kevin, it's nice to have <br />
another boy around at last even if it meant another girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
His sisters all looked at him only slightly darkly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's... nice to meet you too...&quot; Zelipe said.<br />
<br />
Bart shook his head, &quot;That's now how you say 'Hello'! Ya go, 'Hi ya!' Okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi ya?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Louder!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HI YA!&quot;<br />
<br />
The other pups shuddered under the power of Zelipe's lungs.<br />
<br />
Bart just grinned his muzzle and nodded, &quot;Okay! That's good!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You,&quot; The black wolf Jenny pointed at the white wolf Amy, &quot;Me,&quot; She pointed at herself, <br />
&quot;Smash Brothers! Now!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But we're in the middle of playing-&quot; Kevin began. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee said, &quot;Now Jenny, -wait-your-turn!- If you want a one-on-one with Amy, it can <br />
wait till the end of the round you're on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny shuddered and stood slightly at attention, &quot;Yes Mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
A few minutes later (with Jenny clearly not giving her all anymore) Jenny and Amy were put <br />
into the fighting game, Amy barely had time to look at the instruction manual before Jenny <br />
declared the game on. <br />
<br />
Two minutes later Jenny stared at the screen declaring Amy's character the winner. <br />
<br />
Amy looked at Jenny and politely said kindly bowing repeatedly, &quot;Don't be upset, it as all <br />
beginners luck I'm sure. I don't really care much for video games so I don't play them that <br />
much and-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Be quite.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Jenny-chan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's Jenny-Sama to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn't that suffix be reserved for only your father?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny stiffened again and could make no retort or reply to that, but, &quot;You're right...&quot;<br />
<br />
The other cubs and their other all looked at each other knowing something had just flown <br />
over their heads. <br />
<br />
Zelipe asked, &quot;Can I play next? It looked fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And so the addiction begins.&quot; Said an adult male voice. <br />
<br />
Zelipe and Amy then turned finally looked and notice Mr. P, in all the confusion and chaos <br />
and hustle it was rather forgivable. <br />
<br />
&quot;And you would be?&quot; Amy asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;I would be because I am, Mr. P, I am Master's great-grandfather and his children's <br />
grandfather, it's an odd story. My job is make sure nothing else hurts you while Martha's <br />
job, you'll meet her at dinner, is to make sure you don't hurt each other.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I promise I shall do no such thing P-San.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You weren't Japanese,&quot; Jenny said feeling like someone was throwing in things for no <br />
good reason, &quot;Your surname was German. So why the honorifics?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know.&quot; Amy said honestly, &quot;They seem to be just flowing naturally.&quot; <br />
<br />
Everyone looked at Zelipe, who raised his hands I defense taking a step back, &quot;Don't look <br />
at me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny rubbed her 'eyebrows', 'I'm too young for this,' &quot;Could you at least get Chester to <br />
stop salaming at you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot; Amy asked innocently. <br />
<br />
&quot;Him.&quot; She pointed at the tiny dog in Mr. P's shadow. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry Jenny-Chan.&quot; Amy bowed again and went to address the tiny dog. <br />
<br />
As Bart was showing Zelipe through the co-op mode of the game, (while Kaylee spent <br />
futilely trying to teach her children the rules to 'magic the gather' with specular failure ) <br />
the triplets enter the manor through the side doors, looking dirty and smelling (but the <br />
entire estate smelled like wolf so it really didn't bother anyone). <br />
<br />
they found Master sitting in the living room with Pearl, Kaylee and Mr. P watching the <br />
pups. And on top of that, there were two new ones. One was a male wolf cub with pink fur, <br />
and other was a girl wolf cub with pristine white fur and bright red highlights in a flowing <br />
pattern. <br />
<br />
Jensen took one look at them, &quot;You finished rather fast.&quot; <br />
<br />
Fran explained, &quot;The job went faster with three of us, and two of have done so twice <br />
before, so we had on-hand experience.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are they Zack's parents?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pearl stood up and broke the game's hypnotic hold on Zelipe long enough to get him in <br />
front of the triplets, Amy followed automatically. <br />
<br />
&quot;They -were- Zackery's parents. Now they are Zackery's children. This is my son, Zelipe, <br />
and this is June's daughter, Amy.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi ya!&quot; Zelipe said remember Bart's 'lesson.' <br />
<br />
&quot;It is an honor to meet you.&quot; Amy said bowing. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Fran.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Darla.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Julie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You haven't met our daughters yet,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you should at Dinner time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We hope you aren't confused by their appearance when you see them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They are quite pleasant to be around we promise.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fran-San, Darla-San, Julie-San, I hope I prove to be worthy member of our house hold.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you.&quot; Zelipe said much more simply. <br />
<br />
&quot;And it's nice to meet you too.&quot; Replied the triplets together. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whao.&quot; Zelipe took a step back. Marcy and Jenny giggled. Amy stared in amazement. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be alarmed.&quot; Fran began. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is simply the way we are.&quot; Darla continued. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can promise you we are all quite friendly.&quot; Julie finished. <br />
<br />
&quot;I hope to meet your daughters soon.&quot; Amy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will.&quot; The three said together. <br />
<br />
Julie asked Jensen then, &quot;Master, I was wondering, how do you plan to deal with Madam <br />
Serenity?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway we can.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kaylee left her children for a moment and came up to her husband's side. <br />
<br />
Kaylee said, for once being the one to bring up such things instead of her mate, &quot;Jensen <br />
dear, shouldn't be a bit worried that we might be investigated for kidnapping or murder if <br />
we take Madam Serenity by force and have to eliminate her as a threat to our pack and <br />
family?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't you the one always basking in what our pack can do?&quot; Jensen thought, feeling <br />
ironic since he felt when first changed that his new state would be a free ticket to do <br />
ANYTHING he wanted ever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes honey, but I am worried, before we always had the game to help cover our tracks. If <br />
Madam Serenity can't be effected by the game, we'll have to go to a LOT MORE trouble to <br />
cover up her vanishing, we'd have to eat her corpse flesh and bones and all to dispose of <br />
any proof and I'd rather not eat human flesh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen thought, &quot;So would I Kaylee dear. But we can't ignore the danger she poses with <br />
her knowledge of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie spoke, &quot;Master. We may not need to risk our family's safety by killing her, or risk it by <br />
simply letting her do as she pleases, after she's brought here, maybe we can convince her <br />
that I, Darla, Fran, Abbey, Samantha, Alice, and all of us are better this way, we are happy, <br />
we are united, we are whole. She's an intelligent and reasonable woman, we have to at <br />
least -try- to convince her even if we can't use the pups or the game to make her part of <br />
our family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... &quot; Jensen reached out and gently rubbed Julie's breast. Darla only smiled at her triplet <br />
getting Master's attention. &quot;As you wish Julie, we will, but I want your promise that if it's <br />
deemed nessisary, you'll do what needs to be done to protect our pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie moaned in pleasure ever so slightly and replied, &quot;I...I promise Master, Madam Serenity <br />
won't endanger our pack, I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NICOLE!&quot; Jensen shouted. <br />
<br />
The gray she wolf with the red ribbon around one ear was there in seconds, &quot;You called <br />
Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tomorrow, all he lesser males will go to retrieve Madam Serenity for us. leave the where <br />
to me.  Nicole, you're to go with them. You're in command. The lesser males are to listen <br />
to your every order. Take whoever else you want with you. Your mission tomorrow is to <br />
bring Madam Serenity back to us alive. Remember the curse does not work on her nor will <br />
any other transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot; Nicole bowed, and then quickly rejoined her fellow she wolves. <br />
<br />
Nicole spoke, &quot;Terri, Sandi, you're sitting this one out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; The blue-green and teal she-wolves nodded, Terri not objecting after Sandi had <br />
been given that black eye by the former day-workers earlier that day.<br />
<br />
Nicole snapped her claws, &quot;Ashley, you're with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; The blue and sky-blue Ashley said in a brave and determined tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nicole!&quot; The lavender Sarah shouted suddenly stepping foreword, &quot;Please, let me go too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Sarah..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Master said -all- lesser males, and... please, I don't want to see Ulysses hurt in case <br />
something goes wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicole shrugged, &quot;What could go wrong? It's just one old woman and maybe one stray cat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please Nicole? As a pack mate?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You listen to everything I said, you do everything I say, and your only say in any matter is <br />
'Yes Ma'am!' Understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Ma'am!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot;<br />
<br />
The red-violet Margot looked at the plain green Megan, &quot;Aren't you going to ask to join <br />
too? Your brother is logically going too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan hugged herself, of the titan her brother was now, &quot;He can take care of himself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't keep going being uncomfortable around your own brother for the rest of your <br />
life you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Mary gently holding onto Trevor's tail, the tabby led the lion child out of her bedroom <br />
Mary still holding her stuffed animal Lance. After the shock of her brief mania Mary was <br />
docile. Maybe listening in this war meeting was wrong, but both Trevor and Mary -were- <br />
cats, and curiosity was hardwired into their brain structure. Out of sight but not out of <br />
sound.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you understand,&quot; Felicity said, &quot;If we did have Mary use her turn to make us like her, it <br />
wouldn't be the influence of the game that would make us not want to turn back.&quot; She <br />
took her husband's hands, &quot;It would be too much of a tease to Mary, where she's getting <br />
old enough to understand how different she is from everyone else. She's -our- daughter, <br />
we might as well look the part.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary's eyes widened and clutched Lance tighter.<br />
<br />
Serenity then nodded, &quot;I can appreciate that. But the less the game is used the better, as <br />
long as we're on the same subject, what about using the game to make Mary a normal <br />
human?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian looked at her darkly, &quot;You will never bring that up again. Mary isn't a car to be <br />
customized or fine tuned.&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity started but put her poker face back on, &quot;I, I apologize if I somehow implied your <br />
daughter had a disease that needs curing, believe me I know that attitude.&quot;<br />
<br />
Felicity added, &quot;Thank you, Mary needs to learn to accept what she is and have pride in <br />
herself. She needs to learn that doesn't her going off into the jungle to live like a bushman <br />
-OR- needing to waste money to make herself look more like everyone else. That isn't <br />
living.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary leaned against the hallway wall and slid down onto the floor. 'They -want- to be <br />
different, for -me?-'<br />
<br />
Serenity said, &quot;She's your daughter, it's not my place to judge how you raise her. But I am <br />
worried that once you were modified by the game to be like your daughter, that it <br />
wouldn't stop with you. Who would be next? The rest of your family? Her friends? Your <br />
friends? Her friends' families? Your friends' families? If the game does have a life of it's <br />
own, whose to say you won't just be lions with human intellect like Jensen and his wolves? <br />
Male lions -eat- the heirs of toppled rivals. Most people don't realize it, thinking humans <br />
don't -have- instincts, but that's because instincts are things you just don't -think- <br />
about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor remembered, once upon a time, he had been walking by the anime club and saw <br />
two giant robots facing off on the TV inside.   It had been a japanese cartoon playing <br />
where the protagonist had declared, after a brief moral exchange with the adversary, 'I <br />
chose to commit evil to destroy the greater evil!' But one of the geeks watching had <br />
commented, 'But how do you keep from becoming the -next- great evil?'<br />
<br />
It was a -paradox!- It was like the entire deck had been stacked in the wolves favor! <br />
Everyone in the know involved knew it wouldn't be easy but as they examined the situation <br />
more the more hopeless it looked.<br />
<br />
Trevor wondered, 'IS this just a war we can't win?'<br />
<br />
Madam Serenity was rather surprised by how quick Mary's parents accepted her word <br />
about the curse of Glendale being reality. However Madam Serenity during her first lifetime <br />
as a police officer and her second lifetime as a detective with dabbling in alchemy and <br />
fortune telling she had learned to read people very well. And she could tell that the Hardys <br />
honestly believed her, rather than just playing along with the old woman until they could <br />
call the mental ward, (it had happened once before).  'I wonder if it's a side effect of the <br />
shift in reality the curse gave Mary's existence as a lion girl.'<br />
<br />
Madam Serenity thought, never had the game turned into such a... cascade effect, the <br />
short term and narrow thinking of everyone who used the game before had been nothing <br />
quite like this. All the victims of the game were as different as people will always be, but <br />
always underlying it all was some small-minded revenge or shallow sadism.<br />
<br />
&quot;Call the national guard?&quot; Brain suggested honestly.<br />
<br />
&quot;If we did, there's bound to be one or two people in power who'd want to use the game to <br />
create super soldiers who didn't question orders. The army is run by -people- just like the <br />
police, and bringing out the worst in people is what this game EXCELS at.&quot;<br />
<br />
'If we called in the army, they'd likely have to learn of the game, who knows what any army <br />
would do with such a weapon. Create an army of invincible dragon people blindly loyal to <br />
the nation?' Serenity shuddered, 'Same with any giant company that's gotten large enough <br />
to be an entity in of itself and not human anymore.' Gangs. The Mafia. There was just so <br />
much room for total and complete abuse of the game, the original terms the witches used <br />
were just so utterly and complete VAGUE! Of course the screaming large loopholes were <br />
going to be exploits! It was what humans did with ANY game!!  &quot;And can you imagine if <br />
the government at large learned of this game? Death row inmates could end up <br />
Transformed into filled tankers of oil or power plant grade plutonium. The game inspires a <br />
person's worst traits it seems, and the -people- in the government would be no <br />
different.&quot;<br />
<br />
Felicity then asked, &quot;Then what options do you actually -have-? Ask Jensen politely to let <br />
his victims go?&quot;<br />
<br />
While meant in jest Serenity said, &quot;If Jensen really is an intelligent wolf, then he's not about <br />
to just give up members of his pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian threw his hands up, &quot;Offer a free lunch special to an army of wolf people and lace <br />
the free food with lots and lots of sleeping pills?&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity sighed, &quot;That would work only if we could knock them all out at the same time. <br />
And any escapees would just their turns likely to turn more innocent people to replace <br />
their numbers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor from his spot groaned, 'Stacked deck, stacked deck, and we used up our ex <br />
machina with the cure Father Mike concocted. And if we use our one trick in our arsenal <br />
we could end up with a bunch of animal people wanting to make more animal people and <br />
we'd be RIGHT BACK where we started!'<br />
<br />
Brian said, &quot;If you can't use weapons without the police interfering, and you won't use the <br />
game because you're scared we'll end up sociopaths.  Then the two solutions are to -get- <br />
some kind, any kind of permission or help from police who -would- be willing to listen. So <br />
how does the game itself work anyway? I mean, besides the whole 'magic' thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity laid down the rules by laws of the game.<br />
<br />
&quot;So a person who doesn't answer within a minute gets both Dared and Transformed and <br />
only five people at a time and everyone -must- be inside Glendale?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So couldn't you just let us -willingly- wait a minute and then in the Dare include that we <br />
wouldn't use the game on someone unwilling nor -force- that people to be willing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity felt a headache coming on, &quot;Two problems with that, one, two lion people won't <br />
stand up against an estate's worth of wolf people. And second, the wolf people wouldn't <br />
technically be 'willing' to be cured of their brainwashing because their 'will' would now to <br />
be Jensen's slaves with a smile.&quot;<br />
<br />
Felicity asked, &quot;Is it really their 'will' then and not this wolf monster 'Jensen's' will instead? <br />
And therefore they wouldn't have a 'will' of their own to not be 'willing' to be?&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity's head swam for a moment, that was a bit deeper than most people went into a <br />
Dare or Transform, mostly it was just 'have sex with me whenever I want' or 'turn into a <br />
marble fountain.'<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll admit I didn't think of that, but -again- this game doesn't seem to absurdly warp the <br />
descriptions of the asker's dare or transform, but whose to say what it -could- do? This <br />
game was made to spread misery, to use it for good goes against it's base nature.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it would see us having to suffer being different along with our daughter as <br />
sufficient 'payment?' &quot; Brain asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a very big 'if'.&quot; Serenity said,  &quot;And the two of you, still wouldn't be enough to <br />
subdue Jensen's wolves, who'd be fighting to kill, you wouldn't be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said this game can make someone into -anything- right? And/or do -anything- <br />
right? The witches didn't put any restrictions on such things?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's been the general consensus that they either didn't care, or they were just very very <br />
sloppy in what they did due to being hard pressed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Felicity asked, &quot;Then IF it can make someone into anything or do anything, then couldn't it <br />
make two lions who could peacefully or non-leathally deal with an estate's worth of wolf <br />
people who wouldn't force their state on others?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've never heard of a Dare or Transform outright -failing-.... and I have seen some odd <br />
things... there was one bigot who turned an innocent man into a satyr with his full mind <br />
intact, who in returned turn him into a fairy, as in pixie with no traces of his old identity... <br />
I think they moved to Yellow Stone National Park... Don't know what happened to them <br />
after that... But I'm worried what could happen if you give the game too tall an order... And <br />
those kinds of things can have unexpected loopholes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the police who -aren't- pretending the game doesn't exist? You said two <br />
police were involved in this already? You know how personal police take it when one of <br />
their own is harmed. If it needs to be something -simplistic- we can spread it among <br />
willing volunteers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Being a police officer herself once, Serenity knew that very well indeed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not like they have a web page listing police who aren't allergic to getting within a mile <br />
of the curse. And if I start asking for something like this they will start reacting with a <br />
similar allergic reaction.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Madam Serenity,&quot; Felicity said, &quot;If you don't have any -good- options, then your only <br />
choice might be to take your -least- bad option.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You -do- realize how a lion pride works right? The ratio to females to males is quite high. <br />
In order to function coherently as a team most of you and anyone else we, you managed to <br />
convince to join in this mad venture would have become female. And would would you <br />
decide which ones got to remain male? Drawing lots? And by default you interests would <br />
flip with your new gender. You, Brian, might still love Felicity, but could very likely no <br />
longer love her in -that- way anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both couple shivered and gasped hands.<br />
<br />
Brian asked hesitantly, still scared at the idea of no longer being physically attracted to his <br />
own wife, &quot;Jensen, do you have any idea what he plans to do with his new pack of wolf <br />
people?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no idea. They could be wanted to turn the whole world or town into wolves, or just <br />
continue to snatch up random people when Jensen wants a new lady to look at or not have <br />
to pay the bills. Or, as I've been forced to admit after talking to one, don't ask, just want to <br />
be left alone now that he has what he wants. But that still leaves families without -their- <br />
loved ones and friends and those people with their dreams and aspirations all simply -<br />
poof- gone to please their 'master.' I can't let that happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And by default,&quot; Felicity asked hesitantly, &quot;Something similar would happen with the lead <br />
male of a pride of lions?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;By default. Yes, likely. Though it won't likely have the same 'Master and slave' mentality <br />
the wolves have. So it might become like a commune or family, leaving everyone with their <br />
hopes and dreams, but again, that's a nasty -if-.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;....&quot; The couple looked at each other scared. They then looked at Madam Serenity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Madam...&quot; Brian said sounding unsure himself, &quot;Could you please write down some notes <br />
about what dangers the game in of itself has for us and come and see us for breakfast <br />
tomorrow morning?&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity considered asking for Mary to come with her overnight, but knew how that would <br />
go. &quot;... as you wish...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary and Trevor exchanged looks and Trevor hoped over from his spot out of view into <br />
Serenity's arms again, favoring his bandaged leg. Serenity didn't ask where he had been. <br />
She stood up and of course saw Mary holding a plush husky as if it was her only friend in <br />
the world. She said nothing. But she did provide the Hardys with some basic notes and <br />
fundamentals of the game's more common loop holes.<br />
<br />
Paul followed in silence, not looking or feeling all that triumphant in the least.<br />
<br />
Mary ran back to her room the moment Madam Serenity, Paul and Trevor had closed the <br />
door behind them, and stayed there until dinner. 'At least,' She had the demented thought, <br />
'Since I'm a lion, that means I don't have to eat broccoli.'<br />
<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Alice and her sisters along with Martha returned with a small pile of various dresses left in <br />
their room inside the mirror verse. But before they could even be introduced to the new <br />
pups they were hoisted off Jensen to collected the gem wolves to make sure no disaster <br />
had be fallen them. Thankfully, none had, and they all reported that there were no <br />
unpleasant surprises waiting for them on the island. <br />
<br />
Before anything else could come to pass, Kaylee got to have her fun and game again right <br />
there IN THE LIVING ROOM this time. Her children behind her, wearing jewelry or small <br />
faux roman campaign cloaks for the sheer theater of it (Bart felt stupid, Kevin felt like <br />
Superman). <br />
<br />
Beatrice dutifully threw her Alpha Female her custom marine helmet and swagger stick.<br />
<br />
As a Beta, Julie was above needing to give this creed and merely stood to the side. <br />
<br />
Lined up in two rows of sevens (Cobalt among them as a gem wolf herself now), they <br />
stared at their Alpha Female smiling at her. <br />
<br />
 &quot;Now!&quot; Kaylee said smiling ear to ear, &quot;Who do you serve? Who do you obey? Who do you -<br />
love-?!&quot;<br />
<br />
they all said together cheerfully and honestly, &quot;We serve the pack! We obey our Alphas! We <br />
love Master Jensen The Big Bad Wolf!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee put a hand on her hip and pointed their way with the stick, &quot;What is your purpose in <br />
life and creeds-!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To service and please Master in all things, to protect Master and the pack from all that <br />
would threaten us and him! To insure the estate remains a safe haven for the pack forever <br />
and always! To dream of a Glendale where all wear wolf ears even if it remains but a <br />
dream! And to never ever form labor unions!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right turn!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About face!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Left turn!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;UGH!&quot; Said Garnet as she wondered if she had been cursed by something other than the <br />
game with a face fully of metallic purple fur.<br />
<br />
Kaylee smacked her own face, &quot;Your other left Amethyst!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh forgive me Alpha Female!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About Face!&quot; They did so without error or hesitation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stand on one leg!&quot; They did so, the smiles never leaving their faces and not in the least bit <br />
forced as they happily obeyed their Alpha Female.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bow!&quot; They did so. <br />
<br />
&quot;You are all part of the Big Bad Wolf Pack! Cobalt, show them all where they're to be <br />
sleeping.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Alpha Female.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
In the office of the Glendale Police Chief, the phone rang twice before being picked by the <br />
obvious resident.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; Not many people had his office number.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello boy,&quot; Said an old woman's voice on the other end, &quot;Been a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
The chief's eyes went up slightly, &quot;Great-Uncle Scotts?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I always hated that nickname you know, boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know we're not related but you were like an uncle to dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember. Gill, we need to talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's about the game isn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ever heard of leave well enough alone?&quot; Chief Gill spoke solemnly, &quot;The last police chief <br />
who tried to do something about the game ended up a teapot. And it let a rather <br />
unpleasant person become chief of the Glendale police for almost fifty years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Forty three years to be precise Gill.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And when -you- chose to do something about it, you know what happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it took a 'while' to stop being sorry for myself and move on. But Gill Boy, this isn't <br />
'Well Enough' that's going to leave anything or anyone alone, you know that, you've always <br />
know that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unc', we've had this discussion before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know... And I don't mean to bring it up. And I do thank you for bringing people to me to <br />
help them when you can't... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything knew with Frank and Daryl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Nothing good... they got Julie and her kids too...&quot;<br />
<br />
Gill felt a sick chill, &quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman on the other end was anything but apathetic, &quot;Yes. I'm sorry Gill, I tried and I <br />
failed. But right now, I have the loving parents of a victim of the game who I think are <br />
going to do something very noble but very stupid. And they can't do it alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gill's eyebrows scrunched together, &quot;What are you asking?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to stay away from the game? Fine. You're chief of police, it's your call. But I <br />
know you have cops who don't feel the same way and they 'cause you trouble' every time a <br />
victim turns up even when they sometimes help more than you and I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And just as often end up part of Glendale art gallery.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know... I can't believe I'm suggesting this... if you have any police who don't turn a blind <br />
to the game, and honestly want to help save Daryl and Frank and his family... can you have <br />
them come by the follow address incognito tomorrow evening? Some very unpleasant <br />
choices are going to be made.&quot;</p>
