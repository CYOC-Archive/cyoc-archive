<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steve ignored Liz&#39;s suggestion that should wait for his parents to return. He took a quick look at the clock on his watch and saw how late the evening had gotten. It was almost eleven and he thought his parents were far too old to be out this late. <br />
<br />
Liz had mentioned they were somewhere in one of the back rooms so Steve decided to look for where in the bar the back rooms were. All around him as he searched, Steve saw groups of women engaged in a myriad of activities. Some were just talking and enjoying a few drinks while others were face to face to one another, kissing and groping each other. Steve swore he even saw one lesbian getting fingered by her partner.<br />
<br />
Steve didn&#39;t judge them for their activities. It was after all a lesbian bar just as described. But for the life of him he couldn&#39;t fathom why his parents would end up in a place like this. Between all the tables and booths, Steve couldn&#39;t fathom where the back rooms were so he decided to ask for help.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me?&quot; He asked a group, two pairs of lesbians going on a double date, sitting in one of the booths. &quot;I&#39;m looking for where the back rooms are. Do you happen to know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure!&quot; the first one said before before hiccuping, clearly inebriated. She pointed to a large curtain hanging next to the entrance to the bathrooms. &quot;It&#39;s right over there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Behind the curtain is a door to a hall where the private lounges are. Usually they&#39;re reserved for couples,&quot; another one added. <br />
<br />
&quot;Doors are locked if occupied, unless they forgot!&quot; A third explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can happen!&quot; the fourth chimed in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; Steve tried to be polite.<br />
<br />
He made his way over to the curtain and moved it aside. Sure enough, there was a door. Above the door was a big exit sign. Steve opened the door, hoping it wasn&#39;t a trick and he would just end up outside. But to his pleasure, the door opened and he found the hallway. <br />
<br />
The hallway was nondescript. On one end was a clear fire exit from the building and on the other side it just ended. Four doors were on the opposite side. Steve tried the first two, which were empty. The first room had a green theme. The second one had a pink. Each door had a little bar and a circular lounging couch. Steve didn&#39;t see the color on the inside of the third room since the room was occupied and the door was locked. Steve opened the fourth door which he thought had to be where his parents were.<br />
<br />
Steve opened the door to a blue room. Sure enough there was a circular lounge couch like all the rest, so Steve wasn&#39;t shocked by that. What shocked him was seeing a woman that looked just like him mom! She was half naked on the couch, breasts out and everything. The only thing she was still wearing was her bra and socks. Beneath her was another woman who was completely naked, moaning as Steve&#39;s mom was squeezing her breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom!&quot; Steve yelled. Was this why his parents had called his sister to pick them up? His dad have found out that his wife was cheating on him and they were probably furious with one another. Steve&#39;s heart began to break. How could his mom do this?<br />
<br />
&quot;Steve!&quot; the stranger yelled. She quickly got up and began putting her clothes back on. Steve&#39;s mom joined her and soon they both had their underwear, bra, pants, and shirts back on. Steve didn&#39;t even notice that it was the stranger that called out his name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, how could you? You&#39;ve been together with dad for almost twenty five years! Now you&#39;re cheating on him with this slut!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Steve!&quot; The stranger yelled again. &quot;You have no right to talk to your mother that way!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up! You...&quot; Steve stopped. Something about the stranger was familiar. There was something off about her. Then he noticed her shoulder. As far back as Steve could remember his dad had a large birthmark on his shoulder that encroached a bit onto his neck. This woman had the same birthmark!<br />
<br />
&quot;Sit down son,&quot; the woman said again. <br />
<br />
Steve couldn&#39;t believe this. He pulled his slightly longer hair away from his face so he could he a closer look. The shock he felt caused him to fall back onto the couch. This woman had the same birthmark as his dad. This woman was his dad!<br />
<br />
&quot;Drink a glass of water sweetheart.&quot; Steve&#39;s mom passed him a glass which he quickly guzzled down. He could feel a strange buzzing in his gut that quickly dissipated. Steve felt hot and flustered despite the glass of water. He began to scratch absentmindedly at his chest, undoing the top button on his shirt. <br />
<br />
&quot;Steve. I used to be your dad, James,&#39; explained the woman. &quot;Now, I&#39;m Janet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Steve, what happened to Janet wasn&#39;t intentional. But it&#39;s who he... who she is now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me what happened?&quot; Steve asked.</p>
