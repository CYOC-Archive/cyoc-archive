<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob&#39;s dad had trouble getting to sleep, and woke up several times in the night.  Both boys were horses by choice, but as much as he wanted to get a foal out of the new Bonnie, there was no way he could keep the former boy here for more than  a year.  His family might already be getting frantic, though he knew the boys often stayed over at each other&#39;s houses on weekends.  Getting up, he went into the back foyer where he had dropped Eric&#39;s clothing.  Picking the pile up, he wandered back to his office and pulled out the Medallion to stare at it.  Somehow, this odd item had turned his son and Eric into horses, not only in form but in spirit.  It was like Jasper and Bonnie were really back - the animals were mentally just as they had been.  He was sure both were totally happy as they were, and just as certain that this magical item could restore them after Jacob had already demonstrated the ability to change back and forth.<br />
<br />
He poked through Eric&#39;s clothing and pulled out the boy&#39;s wallet.  Having him &#39;missing&#39; was the problem.  There would be a search, and the few who knew about the Medallion would put two and two together when they found out about the new Bonnie.  &quot;Dammit!&quot;  Jacob&#39;s father sighed as he stared at the wallet.  &quot;I wish I could keep Bonnie and produce Eric complete and normal for his family!  That would solve everything!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then he was startled by what felt like a mild electric shock and dropped the Medallion as it started to glow.  Oh no!  Was he turning into a horse?  He did feel odd, but if anything the desk and room seemed to get a little bigger, and his clothes felt loose.  Confusion filled his mind as a whirlwind of new memories and thoughts tore through his head, and he jumped up and stumbled back.  &quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot;  His voice cracked and got higher, and he had to grab at his pajama bottom and shorts as they started to slide off him.  <br />
<br />
Panicked, he kicked off the baggy clothing and ran over to the wall mirror.  The odd physical sensations were already fading, and by the time he saw his reflection only the tangle of hair on his head was still changing color.  A boy was looking back at him - Eric!  He looked down and saw the smooth, slender form of a teenager - presumably also that of Eric.  Why?  Then he recalled what he had said just a minute before - while holding the Medallion!  He had wanted to be able to produce Eric, and still keep Bonnie, who was actually Eric.  So the magic Medallion had somehow turned him into an Eric that could substitute!  <br />
<br />
He felt so confused, though.  Memories of school, of  being with Jacob and Carl, of growing up as Eric...  and he was having trouble remembering his own past now!  Then he recalled all of what he had said.  Eric complete and normal.  Not him looking like Eric, but actually Eric.  He spun to run back toward the desk, wanting to grab the Medallion and stop this change.  But before he got halfway there, he staggered again and had to clutch at a chair to steady himself as a final wave of dizziness and confusion washed over him.  When it passed, he looked around, bewildered.  This was Jacob&#39;s house - the office that Jacob&#39;s dad used.  What was he doing here?  Then he looked down ad his eyes widened.  Stark Naked!  he was standing in Jacob&#39;s house without a stitch of clothing.  Eric did his best to remember how and why he had ended up here.  The last thing he recalled was watching Jacob turn into a horse, and hanging around a little while after.<br />
<br />
Maybe he had gotten tired and taken a nap?  It wouldn&#39;t have been the first time he slept over at Jacob&#39;s, but Jacob was a horse!  That had been pretty intense, finding out one of his best friends could turn into an animal and back.  He looked at the clock on the wall.  after 2 AM!  And he didn&#39;t remember calling his parents to let them know he was staying here.  As long as he was home in the morning before they got up, they&#39;d never know, though.  He found his clothing piled on the desk with his wallet on top.  Weird.  He must have fallen asleep on the couch, but why had he stripped?  There were pajama bottoms and briefs on the floor, but they looked too big for him.<br />
<br />
He got dressed, and searched for his shoes.  They weren&#39;t anywhere to be found, so he stopped off in the back utility room and borrowed a pair of Jacob&#39;s work boots, and then trudged home.  It wasn&#39;t far, and he could sleep in.  The boy who had been Jacob&#39;s father, and was the only person who had known the real Eric was now a mature Clyde mare, was now completely changed to Eric, with no memory of ever being anyone or anything else.</p>
