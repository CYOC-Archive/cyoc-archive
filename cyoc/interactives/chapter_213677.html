<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">t was past noon as they rolled down the cobblestone streets to the Jewelry shop. That would be the best haul of the day, since everything was fenceable. Of course, it meant there would be traps and such, but with the skunk’s powers, the eagle’s keen eye for detail, and Charlie, they could take out all the traps and reset them afterwards to boot.<br />
<br />
The entire ride to the shop, the skunk was curled around Gregory, whispering in his twitching ears and gentle toying with his hard cock through his pants. Charlie couldn’t see much because the big floofy skunk tail was curled to give them privacy, but he thought he saw the mink making out with his bodyguard.<br />
<br />
Charlie figured that it had to be the scent the skunk was wearing, since even his cock was hard.<br />
<br />
They arrived at the Jeweler’s before anything more physical could happen. It was a squat stone building with crystal windows displaying diamond rings and necklaces. While it looked like an easy place to break into, Charlie’s memories of “his” time as a wolf assassin told him that the glass was stronger than steel. <br />
<br />
“Alright, hand me the jar, I’m ready,” Gregory said, wrenching himself free of the skunk.<br />
<br />
The normally well-coiffed mink was flustered, hair slicked up in tufts from where the skunk had clearly been playing with his fur. Charlie swore the mink looked less toned, his haunches rounder and the tent in his pants less impressive than it had been a few minutes ago. Even his features seemed softer and more boyish.<br />
<br />
Charlie shook his head. Clearly he was just imagining things. He turned to Geoffrey.<br />
<br />
“You’re the potential buyer. I’m your bodyguard,” Charlie said to the skunk. Then he turned his attention to the twinky mink. “Gregory, you go in, try to make up a good excuse after you turn into the eagle. Just dredge up a memory. We’ll follow in…thirty minutes. Then we’ll come back tonight and rob it.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, you’re my bodyguard?” Geoffrey hopped across the carriage and wrapped himself around the muscular orca. “Black and white. My favorite colors.”<br />
<br />
“No nonsense right now, sexy,” Charlie kissed the skunk on the nose.<br />
<br />
“Can I fuck you?” Geoffrey whispered in the orca’s earhole.<br />
<br />
“Later. In whatever form you want,” Charlie whispered back.<br />
<br />
“Fun!” Geoffrey clapped his paws together.<br />
<br />
“Let me guess, this is Nicolas the skunk talking?” Charlie murmured.<br />
<br />
“Kinda.” Geoffrey replied.  “I’m Jeff. I’ve got the skunk’s magic and mine, now that my intelligence is high enough.”<br />
<br />
“Hey!” Gregory said, interrupting the two anthros. <br />
<br />
He was holding the essence to his lips, “Does it hurt?”<br />
<br />
The skunk and the orca looked at each other. <br />
<br />
“Yes.” Geoffrey nodded, “Earth shattering.”<br />
<br />
“Like having my cock and balls ripped out and then stuffed up my ass with a fork.” Charlie agreed.<br />
<br />
“Fuck you.” Gregory snorted and took a quick sip.<br />
<br />
“Not very Princely,” Geoffrey said smugly.<br />
<br />
But Gregory wasn’t listening.<br />
<br />
His form was shifting, white fur growing fluffier as he grew taller. The fluff expanded before clearly shifting into downy feathers as wings sprouted from his shoulders and his paws twisted into yellow-scaled talons. Gregory’s lips pressed forth, hardening into a big yellow beak as his blue eyes shifted to gray and sharpened in focus. More feathers-brown and white-sprouted, and then a proper tailored suit with a vest wrapped itself around his torso and breaches on his legs. His yellow, taloned feet were wrapped in fine leather and a pair of Jeweler’s glasses appeared on his head.<br />
<br />
“I say,” Gregory examined himself, “I am rather dashing, aren’t I?”<br />
<br />
“Alright.” Charlie said, trying to ignore the horny skunk snuggling against his rubbery flesh and throbbing boner. “Now dig through the eagle’s memories and find an excuse.”<br />
<br />
“Of course,” Gregory closed his eyes. “Let’s see. His name is Ailin…”<br />
<br />
They waited. <br />
<br />
Charlie occupied himself by exploring the skunk’s mouth with his tongue. There was a pleasant floral smell to the mustelid that he found irresistible. A single furry digit wriggled its way into his tailhole, forcing precum to stain the front of his…oh, his cock was exposed. When had that happened?<br />
<br />
The orca gasped, pulling out of the kiss. He sniffed the cuddly skunk and noticed another note on top of the floral one. It was almost feminine and bright, but not too feminine either. Almost unisex if not for the masculine musk notes.<br />
<br />
Charlie suddenly felt a flush of heat. The skunk smiled and leaned in, letting the orca’s tongue slip back inside that velvety muzzle. They made out, the orca running his digits through the skunk’s soft, fluffy form.<br />
<br />
A soft paw ran up and down Charlie’s throbbing spire. Geoffrey’s paws slowly stroked that big ebony rod, coaxing cum from his cock, then they reached down to cup Charlie’s cum-swollen balls. A clever finger slipped through his pucker and stroked his prostate. <br />
<br />
Charlie moaned as the skunk played with his ass, which felt oddly empty now. He spread his legs, relaxing as the skunk slipped another digit in. The skunk leaned forward and chewed on one of the orca’s meaty nips, slipping a third finger into his needy hole while the orca gasped.<br />
<br />
The smirk the skunk gave Charlie as he allowed Geoffrey to stretch his hole wide with all three fingers, a fourth wriggling into the gap, sent shivers down the orca’s spine.<br />
<br />
Geoffrey hoisted both the orca’s legs up onto his shoulders. Charlie marveled at how sleek and thin his legs seemed compared to how muscular he thought they’d been a few minutes ago. As the skunk’s paws played over his chest, the orca realized his pecs seemed flat, abs non-existent. <br />
<br />
The skunk reached down and stroked Charlie’s cock. The orca groaned happily as the skunk’s soft, slick fist wrapped around his shaft and stroked it. Each tug of Geoffrey’s paw was shorter than the last, and his once-proud twelve-incher soon reduced to a slender 3. <br />
<br />
He let the pleasant floral scent whisk him away. It didn’t matter. All that matters was that ebony cock lining up to spear his throbbing pucker. Charlie spread his juicy ass with his own hands and watched in awe as the skunk stuck his whole fist inside of him.<br />
<br />
“Looks like you’re ready,” Geoffrey leered, pulling his fist out of Charlie’s boi hole and licking the juices off of it. “You taste good.”<br />
<br />
Charlie whimpered, wondering when the skunk had gotten so big. Or had he gotten smaller? He felt strangely vulnerable and so incredibly horny.<br />
<br />
“It’s okay, kid. I’m your first, right?” Geoffrey asked, the older skunk stroking the young orca’s face.<br />
<br />
“Y-yes~” Charlie said, his high voice cracking.<br />
<br />
Why would he say that? Geoffrey certainly wasn’t his first. But still, there was a pervasive notion that he was completely inexperienced. The skunk sensed his confusion and picked up a bottle of cologne, giving him a light spritzing. <br />
<br />
A pleasant flush sent tingles through Charlie’s body as it shrank further. The skunk loomed over the short, skinny, barely-legal orca twink. That didn’t matter to Charlie. All he wanted was for Geoffrey to plow his needy virginal ass.<br />
<br />
From his half-seated position, Charlie watched dick circle his rear entrance, gasping as it slipped inside his hole, trying to clench to keep it inside. But Geoffrey grinned and pulled out, leaving Charlie a whimpering, needy mess. Precum drooled from his all-but-forgotten little cock. <br />
<br />
Finally, Geoffrey gripped Charlie’s thin hips and shoved his dick into the orca’s loosened hole.<br />
<br />
His rectum stretched wide as the skunk’s fat cock pressed itself deep inside of the twinky orca. Charlie gasped, trying to catch his breath as Geoffrey filled him completely. The skunk slid his cock deeper before finally hilting, his furry balls slapping against Charlie’s voluptuous cheeks.<br />
<br />
Geoffrey bucked and rolled his hips, thrusting and jabbing his dick repeatedly against Charlie’s prostate. It was enough to make the twinkish orca’s webbed toes curl. The skunk got into the rhythm and soon the orca’s ass cheeks were clapping with every thrust. Charlie writhed and moaned belief his handsome, more experienced lover.<br />
<br />
“Like that, boi?” Geoffrey said, panting lightly.<br />
<br />
Charlie just moaned and nodded.<br />
<br />
He found himself wrapping his arms and legs around the skunk as he was plowed mercilessly. The orca busied himself in the skunk’s chest and shuddered, enjoying the scent of his musk, which was finally breaking through the floral bouquet. He should have been repelled by the stench, but he found that it smelled oddly masculine, dominating.<br />
<br />
“Like my natural scent?” Geoffrey asked.<br />
<br />
“Y-yes,” Charlie groaned. <br />
<br />
“I got the formula for this perfume from the hag, you know.” Geoffrey whispered. “She was a bit too interested in cats for my liking. Of course, she betrayed me, but I’m back now.”<br />
<br />
Charlie didn’t know what the skunk was talking about and he didn’t care. All he could think about was the pressure in his well-stretched ass, the stars of pleasure that were exploding in his brain like fireworks. He could feel his balls begin to tense, a rising pressure and tingles in his warm hole signaling his impending orgasm.<br />
<br />
“Geoffrey!’ Charlie gasped.<br />
<br />
Geoffrey nodded and thrust deeper before unloading ribbons of skunk jism into Charlie’s fat ass. Charlie gasped as the warmth filled him, his own cock twitching as his own orgasm overtook him. The two lay panting on the carriage’s seat for a minute, enjoying the afterglow.<br />
<br />
The skunk curled his tail around the lithe little orca and cuddled him close to his fluffy chest.<br />
<br />
“You are going to be the cutest little puppy when the soul essence wears off,” Geoffrey said, softly stroking the twink’s cheek. <br />
<br />
Charlie didn’t respond, too busy enjoying the cuddle, the warmth of his lover’s soft fur. His ass was nice and full of skunk jizz, what else could he want. The skunk shifted in his seat and waggled his hands.<br />
<br />
“Prestidigitation,” Geoffrey said.<br />
<br />
All traces of their sexual encounter disappeared. He conjured some more clothing for Charlie. The little orca pulled on his clothes.<br />
<br />
“We’re a couple looking to buy some jewelry.” Geoffrey said.<br />
<br />
“But-”<br />
<br />
“I’ll handle things, okay?” Geoffrey booped the orca on the snout.<br />
<br />
The two lovers hopped out of the carriage and walked into the store. Charlie was walking stiff and bowlegged, his rear feeling sore. He’d never done anal before, after all. Hagerd and Palseks chuckled as they watched the two enter the store.<br />
<br />
Gregory seemed to have won over the workers, as they were getting him up to speed when the two lovers walked in. Charlie was hanging off his handsome skunk’s arm and giggling. Gregory glanced up at the two of them, a frown crossing his beak.<br />
<br />
“Hello, valued customers,” Gregory the temporary eagle said. “Can I help you?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, I want to buy my boi a necklace,” The skunk said as the orca nuzzled into his chest.<br />
<br />
“Of course, we have a large selection.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, and to reset the diamond on my ring,” The skunk dug a ring out of his pocket.<br />
<br />
“We can-” Gregory glanced at his co-workers, who nodded, “certainly do that!”<br />
<br />
“It’s very expensive, can you ensure it stays safe?” Geoffrey asked.<br />
<br />
“Absolutely, walk this way.” Gregory led them to the back of the store.<br />
<br />
“This is the safe,” Gregory continued, pointing at a large metal box. “On top of the complex locking mechanism, it is also protected by a variety of spells. The shop itself is a virtual fortress.”<br />
<br />
“Ah, then here.” Geoffrey handed him the ring.<br />
<br />
Gregory glanced around to make sure no co-workers were watching as he dialed in the code and whispered all the command words to deactivate the trap spells. Charlie was watching carefully, the little thief’s attention firmly on the task at hand. When the ring was carefully stored away, the eagle swung the door closed and re-engaged the locks.<br />
<br />
“There, perfectly secured.” Gregory winked.<br />
<br />
“Thank you so much!’ Geoffrey said as they walked out from the back.<br />
<br />
They left the shop, got into the carriage and drove back to Hagerd’s house. <br />
<br />
From there, they unloaded the goods, storing it under floorboards. Then Charlie and Geoffrey got to planning the actual heist. Gregory walked in later, back to his old, untwinkified self. Even Charlie had returned to his original form as the perfume and essences had worn off. <br />
<br />
Other than a raised eye from Hagerd, no one seemed to notice anything out of the ordinary.  And no one commented on what had transpired earlier.<br />
<br />
The polar bear smiled, patting the skunk’s jar in his pocket.</p>
