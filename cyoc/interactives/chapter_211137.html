<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen woke up in the morning to the sounds of a rather exasperated Alice telling off Mina.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to report this you know,&quot; She was saying, &quot;You&#39;ll be starting your first day with a punishment. Grab her foot and hold it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen picked herself up and trotted up to the cage door. Alice and two other carers were in Mina&#39;s cage with her. One of them had the girls arms pinned above her head and was trying to keep her shoulders flat on the floor. The other had hold of her flailing leg and was trying to hold it still while Alice attempted to replace her kneepad. Jen could see her face and knew from her expression that she was enjoying this. She kept trying to turn her hips and rub herself on Alice&#39;s leg. Alice looked about ready to slap her across the face. They were interrupted by the sudden arrival of Amelia. She rushed in with one of the carers on her heels, not running, just moving at double time. Alice and the carer holding Mina&#39;s leg moved aside hurriedly as she entered the rather crowded cage. She pulled a riding crop from her belt and snapped it against Mina&#39;s exposed ass. Mina cried out in pain and stopped struggling.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened.&quot; Amelia asked Alice. &quot;Why isn&#39;t she wearing her pads?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We think she must have pulled them off sometime last night. I don&#39;t think they&#39;re exactly comfortable to sleep in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why didn&#39;t you notice during your patrols?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t think to check. I was just making sure she was still in her cage. I will be more thorough in the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No need for an apology, you did nothing wrong. How did she get them off?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The pads were originally sized for Jen. Mina is quite a bit skinnier than her and the straps weren&#39;t as secure as they should have been.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll have to get Betty to fix up another set.&quot; she looked over at the cart. &quot;Have either of them been fed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Ms. Lockehart. We were busy dealing with Mina.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amelia strode over to the cart and grabbed the container of eggs. She filled Jen&#39;s bowl and patted her on the head.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least we have one good girl here.&quot; she said, giving Jen a warm smile.<br />
<br />
Jen smiled back and began eating her breakfast. Amelia walked back into Mina&#39;s cage and held the crop up menacingly. Mina got the message and held her leg out so that Alice could replace the pad, then repeated with the other one. Once both pads were back in place Amelia grabbed her by the collar and pulled her onto her hands and knees. Jen heard the crack of the crop again and a gasp from Mina. She looked up from her bowl and watched as Amelia delivered several more blows to the girls unprotected rear. By the time she was done Mina was crying quietly from the pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was for removing your pads. After you finish your meal you will be getting several more for resisting the carers. Now eat up, and no lollygagging or you will earn even more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice scooped eggs into Mina&#39;s bowl and she ate obediently. She managed to finish both helpings before Jen did and stood there quivering while Amelia regarded her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You realize,&quot; she said coldly, &quot;that this punishment is for your own good right? You are here to be taught how to behave properly. It may be as a dog, but I have a feeling that it might translate into your normal life as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
She twisted the crop in her hands, gazing up towards the ceiling with a thoughtful look on her face. She seemed to be considering something, her lips moving as if she were speaking. She shook herself and glared down at Mina again. She reached down and gripped the girl&#39;s collar tightly before bringing the crop down on her already red hindquarters.<br />
<br />
&quot;This.&quot; she said as she repeated the earlier whipping. &quot;Is for disobeying the carers. You are no longer one of them, you are a dog and will obey them!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mina&#39;s elbows gave out and her front half dropped to the floor. She was sobbing from the pain and her tears were flowing freely now. She managed to keep her ass in the air until Amelia was finished with her. Amelia tucked the crop back into her belt and pulled a cellphone from her pocket. She tapped the screen a couple of times and Jen heard the tones of a number being speed dialed. The person on the other end picked up after the first ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Betty? This is Amelia. Could you grab the first aid kit and come down to the kennel? I was forced to discipline our newest pup and want to make sure that I did it correctly.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a heavy sigh from the other end of the line.<br />
<br />
&quot;Already? I haven&#39;t even had my coffee. This girl is more trouble than she&#39;s worth. I&#39;ll be there shortly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amelia hung up and put the phone away. She turned to the carers that were hanging around to watch the spectacle. They immediately began looking busy attending to the dogs. Amelia shook her head. She turned to Alice instead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your shift is over now. Go home and get some sleep and I&#39;ll see you again tonight.&quot; she turned to other carers again. &quot;Marissa! You don&#39;t have any boarders to care for today, would you take Jen out to the yard for me? I&#39;ll come out and take over once I&#39;ve dealt with Mina.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marissa hurried forward and opened Jen&#39;s cage. She attached a leash to her collar and led her out of the kennel. As they were moving down the hall towards the yard they passed Betty going the other way, carrying a bag and muttering to herself. She greeted them as they went by and gave Jen&#39;s head a good rub but didn&#39;t stop to talk. Once outside Marissa removed the leash and Jen scampered off to do her usual morning business. With her bladder now empty she looked around for something to occupy her time. She wanted to play fetch again, but since she had gotten out later than usual there were already several dogs that would get in the way. She settled for a squeaky toy that she found near the bushes and lay down so she could focus on chewing it. It was surprisingly cathartic, biting the rubber toy and hearing it squeal, she felt like she could almost understand why a dog might enjoy it. She enjoyed the peace of the morning for several more minutes before Amelia arrived with Mina in tow.<br />
<br />
Mina&#39;s face was still streaked with drying tears and her eyes were red. When she turned Jen could clearly see the bright red marks left by the crop, though they were covered in a shiny layer of ointment. She continued to chew on her toy as she watched the redhead gingerly cross the lawn and squat to relieve herself. The other dogs were naturally curious about her, just as they had been with Jen. They tended not to bother her anymore, she was one of them now. Mina was soon surrounded by a group of dogs that were sniffing and licking her. She seemed to enjoy the attention and when one of them licked her crotch Jen saw the girl arch her back and present her pussy to them. Amelia saw this as well and marched over to put a stop to it.<br />
<br />
Mina just couldn&#39;t seem to stay out of trouble. She would steal toys from the other dogs and tease them with them until they were frantic. When she discovered the other side of the yard hidden behind the bushes and the view it provided she proceeded to put on a show for the male trainers. Amelia had to drag her back and yell at the watchers to get back to work. When it came time to take them to morning class she decided to play keep away until Amelia pulled out the crop and threatened her with it.<br />
<br />
Class was a disaster. Jen took her customary place at the front of the group and Mina was placed right next to her. She tried to follow the commands and set an example for the dogs but Mina kept deliberately bumping into her and pawing at her breasts. Finally she could take no more and snapped at the girl, surprising even herself. It was one of the most doggyish things she had yet done and she hadn&#39;t even thought about it before it had already happened. Amelia felt that this was enough and pulled Mina aside to discipline her again. She was placed at the back of the group with a fresh batch of red marks and eyes brimming with tears.<br />
<br />
Jen ate lunch alone. Mina was taken off to see Betty and have her pads refitted. Jen enjoyed the brief moment of peace and quiet while she ate. After lunch it was back to the yard where she experimented again, playing tug of war with one of the smaller dogs using a frayed rope. It was going quite well until Mina barreled into her out of nowhere, having had her pads fixed and eaten lunch. Jen pushed her off and growled angrily but Mina ignored her and tried to nuzzle her chest. Marissa finally dragged her off and tied her to the time-out stake in the corner, the normal punishment for dogs that were having trouble getting along. When Amelia rejoined them she gave her another couple of swats.<br />
<br />
Afternoon class went slightly better than the morning one. This time Amelia put Mina at the back of the class right from the start and stood over her with the crop ready. Any time Mina failed to follow a command there was quick snap followed by a small whimper. Jen ignored this and focused on the trainers, they were introducing hand-signs now and she wanted to get them right. By them time class had ended Mina had several more marks on her ass. Amelia took the two of them by Betty&#39;s office on the way to the side yard so she could apply more ointment to Mina&#39;s increasingly sore bottom.<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t sustainable.&quot; she told Amelia. &quot;Keep hitting her like this and there will be a very real risk of infection and scarring. Try hitting her thighs and the sides of her breasts for a bit to give her backside a bit of a break.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could do that, but with the way she&#39;s behaving they will quickly be in a similar state.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just do it for the rest of today. I&#39;m work-shopping a solution right now but I need more supplies to complete it. I&#39;ll stop by the store on my way home and have it ready by morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once in the side yard Amelia set Jen to running laps while she gave Mina extra lessons. Jen was getting the hang of moving on all fours now. She had been watching the collies that she sometimes shared the yard with and noticed how when they ran they used their whole bodies, not just their legs. She tried to mimic them but her body didn&#39;t want to bend that way and it made her abs sore. Though she had improved greatly since she first started there was no chance she would ever outrun a real dog. When she had completely tired herself out she returned to Amelia.<br />
<br />
Amelia had spent the time running Mina through all the commands that had been practiced that day in class. She was a very poor student. Any time Jen had run past her head would turn to follow and Amelia would have to give her a smack to refocus. The more time passed the more mistakes she seemed to make as well. Amelia attributed it to the mounting pain of all the punishments she had received that day. When Jen stumbled up, panting with exertion from her running, she decided to call it a day and take the two girls back to the kennel.<br />
<br />
As they walked Jen got a good look at Mina. Her ass was one big mass of red with a few stripes of faint purple shining through. Her thighs had collected a few marks as well, but Amelia seemed to have focused more attention on the girl&#39;s breasts. They weren&#39;t that big, either a small B or large A, but they had become the new target for Amelia&#39;s frustration since her pale rear was too damaged to risk any more. Mina was crawling very carefully, trying not to let her arms rub up against them as she went. The cautious way she moved her legs showed that that end was just as sore.<br />
<br />
Alice was already in the kennel when they arrived. She was changing out the pads in their cages for fresh ones. She held up the one she had just taken from Mina&#39;s. Unlike Jen&#39;s, which just had a small spot in the middle, this one looked like it had been used several times.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just changing out the pads Ms. Lockehart.&quot; she explained. &quot;With all the confusion this morning I completely forgot to check them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amelia examined the soiled pad and looked down at Mina. Mina was too tired and sore to look up.<br />
<br />
&quot;When you collect their dinner tell chef to ask Betty for some supplements to add to Mina&#39;s food. This much urination could be a sign of a bladder infection.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice left for the kitchens while Amelia put the girl&#39;s into their cages. Jen took a long drink from the fountain before settling down on her bed to rest until the food arrived. Mina crouched down gingerly on hers, trying not to put any pressure on her injuries. Amelia stood and regarded them with a thoughtful expression. After a few minutes contemplation she said what had been on her mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know,&quot; she said musingly, &quot;You girls have really inspired me. When Jen came here I thought it was a strange request, but her dedication to her dog Rex moved me. And Mina, though you&#39;ve proven to be one of the hardest cases I have ever encountered, you still show a willingness to at least try. I&#39;m thinking there may be something to this. I&#39;ve felt like I&#39;ve been in a bit of a rut these past few years but you may have shown me a new way forward.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both girls looked at each other and then back up at Amelia completely baffled. She smiled broadly at them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been thinking of expanding the school for quite some time now, but there just isn&#39;t enough demand for the elite training and high quality boarding that we provide. You&#39;ve probably noticed that the kennel here is only about two thirds full. Though it is off-season for boarding, training is at it&#39;s peak and yet we can&#39;t seem to book enough clients. But you two...&quot;<br />
<br />
She was interrupted by Alice returning with the food cart. She smiled at the girls again and began helping the carer dish out their meals. They ate while the two women made small talk. Jen listened, but Amelia said nothing more on the subject of expanding the school. As they ate the other carers brought the dogs back in and gave them their meals as well. Jen and Mina ate both helpings without complaint and Jen was even hungry enough to devour half of the cereal as well. Alice topped off her bowl and gave her head a good rub. When the lights dimmed Amelia and the carers all left, saying their goodnights to Jen, Mina, and their other favorite dogs.<br />
<br />
Jen lay down on her bed and expected to hear Mina trying to tease her again, but all was silent. After a while she risked looking over and saw that Mina was fast asleep. She realized that both of them had had a busy day and that Mina wasn&#39;t used to it yet. She was probably exhausted. Jen yawned and curled up in her bed, following Mina into sleep.</p>
