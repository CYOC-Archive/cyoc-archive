<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark was thinking what all he could do with Aidan when his stomach growled loudly. He hadn´t thought about getting something to eat since breakfast, so it was empty. As much as he tried to remain focused on deciding about Aidan, he couldn´t stop his hunger from getting painful.<br />
Aidan stood there, waiting in fear of what would happen to him. Would Mark make some small change or a bigger one? Would he remain human, or be turned into an animal? As Mark´s stomach growled, Aidan would have offered him something to eat just to escape his unknown fate, but he was still frozen and silenced.<br />
Finally, Mark had enough of his hunger to corrupt his thinking, which had resulted in interesting thought. Why not make Aidan something to eat for himself? Slowly, a grin formed on his face, a predatory one.<br />
Aidan didn´t like the look Mark had just gotten, if he could he would be shaking in fear by now.<br />
Mark had settled on what he wanted right now. “Aidan, as you have noticed, I´m rather hungry. Therefore, you will become a big, bacon, egg and cheese sandwich for me. Extra spicy and filling. Your clothes will simply vanish.”<br />
Aidan was absolutely horrified by that. Not only would he become something lifeless, but even if there was life in him, he would end up eaten? But he could do nothing as the changes started.<br />
With a wave of cold air his clothes faded from existence, leaving him naked in front of Mark. His feet started to grow under him, while he moved his hands over his head, where they too expanded outwards like a cover. When both his feet, as well as his hands merged into a big mass around him, Aidan realized what they turned into. Soon, both masses had become softer as his bones vanished, his nails only minimal more solid. Bread, big slices of bread, with his nails as crust. A bit of his blood seemed to have become butter, fairly coating the inside of the bread slices.<br />
Aidan could do nothing but look horrified when his body slowly seemed to melt between the bread slices. His arms and legs fell off, and he watched in shock as they expanded in width, but thinned out in mass. As they gained a roasted color, Aidan could tell they were now a couple of slices of roasted bacon covering his former feet.<br />
His torso, right between his neck and his crotch melted away between them, slowly covering the whole slice of bread and the bacon before becoming more solid again, a gooey mass with also glued his changed body back together. And with horror he recognized the smell it wafted around his human head; it was cheese.<br />
As he looked down, he saw his crotch expand outwards as well, flattening his cock and balls over a good part of the gooey mass of cheese. He could still feel everything as if unchanged, so he could tell apart that the yellow patch right below his head was his flattened balls, while the white surrounding it had been his cock and the remaining flesh of his crotch. And with even more horror, Aidan could say it was a slice of an egg now.<br />
When his head started to flatten but expand outwards, his senses went all ways. It was as if suddenly he had eyes, ears and noses all over the place. He could make out a bushy, green something embedded into the rest, and when it clicked, his horror raised tenfold. His head had become a crispy lettuce leaf.<br />
A final shudder went through Aidan´s changed body as every movement his gooey insides made ceased and he shrunk a bit smaller. Now, right in front of Mark, laid a big, nice wafting bacon, egg and cheese sandwich.<br />
And as Aidan hoped it had all been some kind of evil joke from Mark, he was lifted by him, and forcefully bitten into. The pain was unbearable to Aidan, and still he couldn´t lose his consciousness, as more pain assaulted him while Mark chewed. When Mark swallowed his first bite, Aidan felt as if part of him was in a free fall. Before it could land, however, Mark took his next bite, repeating the cycle of pain for Aidan. The wetness his falling parts landed in wasn´t that noticeable to him right now.<br />
Bite after bite, Aidan was eaten alive by Mark. The pure size he had been took Mark more than ten minutes to finish him off, swallowing the last bit. Aidan then was completely in the dark, wet place he soon recognized as Mark´s stomach, and he was slowly digested. But he still felt Mark patted on his stomach, and clearly heard him say: “Ah, that was good. You were rather tasty now, Aidan. I wish there was more to eat off you.”<br />
Somewhat lucky for Aidan he didn´t reappeared as a new sandwich for Mark to relive the whole experience. But it was little relieve when you were slowly digested, feeling like your whole body was burned away. And as his body was erased and absorbed by Mark, his mind and soul remained behind. It slowly wandered through the body, searching for a new body, so to speak, that wasn´t occupied right now.</p>
