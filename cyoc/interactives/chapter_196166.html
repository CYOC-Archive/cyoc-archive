<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lindsay woke up with a smile as she felt better then she ever had before. Lindsay was a 22 year old young women living in a large house just off campus of her university however that wasn’t why she was smiling.<br />
<br />
She rolled over, her short red hair which she kept about shoulder length moved a bit as she came face to face with her bare chested sleeping boyfriend of almost 2 years, Oscar. Oscar was a sexy, handsome young man who she had meet on her first day of class and instantly fell for. He was kind, gentle and made her feel loved. She put her face into his chest and inhaled the scent, just smelling his musk was a turn on for her. <br />
<br />
“Morning.” Said Oscar still semi asleep as he opened his deep green eyes which was framed by his dark black hair. <br />
<br />
“Morning.” She responded as her hand ran down his bare chest, brushing over his muscles. He didn’t have a six pack or something like that, but he had a strong body with the right balance of fat and muscle which she found perfect. <br />
<br />
She wondered if he found her sexy, she wasn’t that gifted in the chest department, truth be told she was lacking with only a A cup but she had long sexy legs and a good ass. Her worries where put to the side as Oscar rolled on top of her his dark hair framing her face as his eyes meet her. Both smiled as he came down and gave her a deep kiss. She could feel his massive hard on through his boxers, like him she was only in her underwear. So far even 2 years into their relationship neither of them had slept with the other, both had been burned by their high school relationship so they had taken it slow. <br />
<br />
That didn’t stop them from make out sessions, hand jobs and the like. She was about to throw that restraint to the wind and go all the way with the young man she loves when a pounding on the front door caused them to stop for a moment. <br />
<br />
“Police!” yelled a voice from outside. <br />
<br />
“Police?” inquired Lindsay as they pulled apart.<br />
<br />
“Everyone get down here now!” yelled a female voice that both recognized as belonging to Lindsay’s house mate Jen. Both of them got out of bed and slipped on some cloths, they walked out of the room to see two of Lindsay’s other house mates Arryn and Barbara coming out of their room. <br />
<br />
The two women where the same age as Oscar and Lindsay and where in a relationship. Judging by Barbara’s very long and messy blonde hair and her sports bra was on inside out while Arryn’s shorts where on backwards of what they had been doing. <br />
<br />
Coming out of her room another of the her other roommate, she looked the best dressed. She was a small women, even shorter then Britney her long light blonde hair tied back in a bun while she wore a fine bath robe. She didn’t have a boyfriend who had come to the house party last night so she had slept alone. <br />
<br />
They came downstairs to see their friends gathering on the couch while a police officer and a doctor stood before them both dressed in gas masks. <br />
<br />
The others in the house was Jenny (Jen) and her boyfriend James, Jen was the sporty type and always got up around this time to go for a run. Her boyfriend James hadn’t been but with her help he was getting in shape, and both seamed to love each other. Their other friends, Samantha was a hot headed young women who was known to do some rather crazy but fun things. She would fit the definition of a crazy red head, but her hair was a dark brown. Beside her was her boyfriend, who was opposite in her in almost every way. He was calm, collective and did meditation daily, the Korean born student Howard Yang. <br />
<br />
Sitting beside them was one of their friends, the dark skin young women who Lindsay had own meet at the party yesterday, Katie. <br />
The last two people was Lindsay’s last roommate in this 5-bedroom house, Jessica. To Lindsay Jessica was a self-centered, mean, cruel bitch of a women who loved to put everyone down while pushing the idea that since she superior then almost everyone. Her long jet-black hair frame her cold dark eyes as beside her sat her equally as self-centered and superior thinking boyfriend, Ryan. Lindsay could feel her boyfriend Oscar tense up a bit as he glared at Ryan. Ryan had been his high school bully back home and neither liked the other, he hated him almost as much as she hated Jessica. <br />
<br />
None of that mattered as everyone gathered in the room.<br />
<br />
“What is going on?” inquired Barbara with a loud yawn.<br />
<br />
“I am afraid this house is going into lockdown.” Announced the cop as everyone looked at him and the doctor both wore gas masks and gloves. <br />
<br />
“One of you came into contact with a person who came to the hospital last night transforming into an animal hybrid.” Announced the doctor<br />
<br />
“So what we have all been vaccinated, you have to be to go to school here.” Stated Ryan sounding more like the cocky jock type then he even looked like which was hard.<br />
<br />
“So where they.” explained the Doctor as everyone paused for a moment. “There are reports of a new strain which beats the vaccine. Sadly, since you were all together last night we can’t just isolate the single person, you are all exposed so all must isolate.”<br />
<br />
 “The good news is that we should all know in 36 hours, if none of you show signs you should be out of here Sunday night.” Explained the cop “Please wait here, if you need anything a police officer or doctor will get it for you. You may go out into the fenced back yard but no where else besides this house. We have officers watching.”<br />
<br />
“You can’t do that!” yelled Sam<br />
<br />
“Legally they can.” Confirmed Arryn, she was studying to be a lawyer, so they believed her.<br />
<br />
“So please just stay here, we will provide everything we can to help.” Said the cop as he placed a contact form on the table and headed out. When the front door closed, they heard what sounded like a large chain going over the door. They had been locked in.</p>
