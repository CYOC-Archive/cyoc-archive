<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you sat there you couldn’t pull your eyes away from Arianna.  Her sleek powerful form, black fur glistening in the dimmed lights, much longer on the top of her head where two rounded ears poked through.  Firm full breasts that rose and fell with her deep panting delivering a surge to your loins, hard erection pressing against your pants that squeezed your legs.  <br />
<br />
Her green eyes locked onto yours for a moment later before she slid herself under the table, before you could so much as guess what she was doing you felt a pair of clawed hands wrenching at your pants.  <br />
<br />
“A-Arrrriannnaa…?”  You manage before she succeeds in tearing through your pants, freeing most of the front of your crotch and pulling it away, ripping down the front of your right leg until the chunk of material comes away below the knee.  <br />
<br />
“Mmmmm….”  You hear her moan as she runs a rough tongue over your throbbing cock.  <br />
<br />
“Hhheerrrrreee…..?”  You slur, still dimly aware that there are others in the room.  <br />
<br />
What you didn’t know, or care to know, was that they were more or less in the same situation, the older couple already fully ursine and their table thrown aside to let them get at it.  The younger couple had parted somewhat, he was scurrying around on the floor with seemingly no recollection of his former self while she had ‘repurposed’ a bottle for her own needs, groping one scaled breast through the hole she’d ripped in her dress with her heels and panties discarded.  The lone college student struggling to remain seated given how equine he was now.  No opposable digits and a very wide rump that spilled over the seat sides while he struggled to keep eating.  <br />
<br />
While lost in the pleasure you were receiving, you didn’t notice Mandy’s return, saying something to one of the Diners before coming to your table.  <br />
<br />
“You know, we do have a room aside if you want to continue with that.”  She spoke to you, her voice gruffer than before.  <br />
<br />
Trying to pay attention to her, you can’t help but think that something’s different about her, you cant quite recall her being silver-grey, or standing barefoot on her toes.  <br />
<br />
Whatever, you decide.  Arianna clearly wants to continue and you’re not willing to upset her.  “Ssshhurrrrreeee…..”  You manage to reply as you reach under the table to pull her up.  <br />
<br />
“Hhheeyyyy….”  She complains at having her fun halted.  <br />
<br />
“New rrrrooomm….finiiisshh tthherrrreee…”  You calm her down as Mandy escorts you and her, plus one other out of the main dining room.  <br />
<br />
With a chance to think as you’re led through the corridors, you try to wonder why things feel so wrong to you.  Almost like there’s something buzzing at the back of your mind, alerting you to danger.  <br />
<br />
Something that you force to the side as you’re led into the assigned room.  Quite a large one, with a number of wide chairs and sofas plus a few longue chairs, one that the other one has already settled herself on.  <br />
<br />
“Nnoww.”  Mandy speaks with a rough yet pleasant voice, looking at her you notice and dismiss the ears poking out of the top of her head and the tail that sways from under her skirt.  “If yyyou need anything, just call meee.”  <br />
<br />
You nod your affirmation as you work to pull off the remainder of your pants, the tightness still painful on your left leg as Mandy leaves you three to yourselves.  Once you succeed in stepping out of your ruined pants, losing the shoes as well so only your necklace remains.  You turn to see that Arianna has started ‘playing’ with the other female, pulling her dress down her legs and off her thick yet flexible tail, so only Arianna is really wearing anything anymore, and then just her still-tight shoes.  Stumbling over to her, you catch her attention when your rock-hard shaft presses into her side.  <br />
<br />
“Whherrrrrrrreee…werrrreee….weeee…?”  You moan as you make your way behind her, ready to really begin, unaware of the necklace you still have on beginning to grow hot.  <br />
<br />

<br />
POV Change<br />
<br />
Mandy was feeling quite relaxed now despite her lupine appearance.  Yes, it was uncomfortable and yes, it made her uniform unbearable, but at least right now neither of those points mattered.  Three good candidates were selected and set aside for further applications and the remaining four already had their fates decided.  <br />
<br />
Oh she was well aware that Ms Chalmers only sought two fresh ones, but leaving him to pick out the second himself, selecting which went where, it was SO much fun, and Ms Chalmers had made clear that she liked to see it herself.  So all in all, things were looking good for her.  <br />
<br />
Once she could take the counter-drink, as she had done for the past five years since her own ordeal had started.  Of course she’d chosen to keep her mind, even if it meant she’d be working for Ms Chalmers for the rest of her life, as she was the one who procured what she needed to maintain her human body.  <br />
<br />
Which would have to wait a little longer since she needed to make one last check to see how the others were doing.  In the main dining room, the two bears had finished their business and now slept on the floor next to the remnants of their clothes.  The small lizard had been collected, and the horse wasn’t quite done yet.  <br />
<br />
This could be troublesome, as he managed to remain on his hind legs and bring his nine-foot standing body over to her, an empty glass balanced on his forelegs.   <br />
<br />
“A sprrill?”  Mandy guessed, the nodding of his long head confirming it as she took the glass from him.  “Wait by yourrr seat, and I’ll brrring a frrresh one overrr.”  She growled cheerfully, heading to the kitchen for a clean glass with the right Wine.  Leaving him to wobble over and slide himself back onto his seat, the chair groaning under his much-increased weight.</p>
