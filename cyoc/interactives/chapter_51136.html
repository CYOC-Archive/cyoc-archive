<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I-I was changed by the game and.. you! What happened to you! Wait! You remember I'm <br />
supposed to be human?! But everything changed when I was cursed!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I remember! But wait-! YOU remember? But-but-, our transform was that everyone <br />
would forget we existed who wasn't part of the pack!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've been wondering where you and your family moved to! PACK?! What pack?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our Pack! The Big Bad Wolf Pack! Our Alpha Male is Master Jensen THE Big Bad Wolf! It's <br />
really cool! But as long as you're here, you can become part of the pack too!&quot;<br />
<br />
For some reason, becoming a dog disgusted Mary beyond her brain's ability to process, <br />
&quot;NO! Uly', you have to change back! This Master or whatever! He's totally messed with your <br />
head! This isn't you! You need to become human again!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that's impossible,&quot; Ulysses grinned with his muzzle, &quot;Alice worded a Transform or <br />
Dare very carefully so that none of us can have our wolfhood stolen!--OOPS!&quot; Ulysses <br />
covered his muzzle in shock and alarm as he realized what he had just said, &quot;Mary! Please <br />
don't tell Sarah or Master what I just told you! I'd get in so much trouble! I think it's <br />
supposed to be a secret!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary felt horror scream through her, &quot;No.. no no no Ulysses you're joking right?! RIGHT?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, right I'm joking,&quot; Ulysses spoke, saying the single most unbelievable and miserably <br />
carried out lie in history.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uly', come on... please no. What about your family? Our friends? Don't you care about <br />
them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure I do! But I care about my pack too! Maser says that after a year or two when things <br />
calm down we can start bringing in our family and friends into the pack, or did he say <br />
that? I can't remember...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;ULY!&quot; Mary stopped her paws and looked up at Ulysses, not liking how he was now taller <br />
than her when it had been before the other way around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot; Ulysses said thought not sure what he was apologizing for.<br />
<br />
&quot;Think Uly! Is this really what you want? Is this really how you want to be? Can you really <br />
say that a bunch of wolf people are really your family-?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah's face popped in Ulysses' mind, but before he could answer,<br />
<br />
&quot;Ulysses, are you okay, what's going on--&quot; Sarah stopped and stared crawling out of the <br />
bathroom to check on their advanced scout...<br />
<br />
At that same moment, whatever had been delaying the Hardys and their guests was <br />
apparently no longer a factor.  The two sides stared at each other.<br />
<br />
Then all hell broke loose.<br />
<br />
Alice and Amy as instructed remained in reserve inside the safety of the mirror universe, to <br />
remain there until Nicole told them that all the fighting was done.<br />
<br />
Ashley stood nearby Nicole as a bodyguard, Nicole didn't have eyes in the back of her <br />
head after all.  Nicole stayed near the rear of the pack, ordering the males to block all exits <br />
and to sweep the entire building from there until they found the old woman who matched <br />
Serenity's description and to subdue or neutralize anyone they came across. Lawrence, <br />
Zack, Nick, with Roger leading the mass of fur and muscle, Zack would have save of <br />
course for his damaged knee.<br />
<br />
Sarah stayed near Ulysses.  Mary ran the same direction her parents did a moment later, <br />
Ulysses grabbed Mary, Mary dug her claws into Ulysses' arm, forcing him to let her go as <br />
he yelped in pain, and the more agile Mary avoided a swipe by Sarah in retaliation even as <br />
Ulysses begged Sarah not to hurt her.<br />
<br />
Serenity managed to actually move faster than the Hardys, she was old, but she wasn't <br />
THAT old, and she still had a lifetime of rather physically active adventures featuring one <br />
demented abuse of the curse or another to draw on.<br />
<br />
Paul barely moved an inch as the wolves came his way.<br />
<br />
Roger got Paul in a bear hug, forgetting a very important fact. Ape's 'feet' were for all <br />
realistic purposes 'hands' as in fists.<br />
<br />
Paul's black and orange legs jabbed like jackhammers into Roger's gut causing him to fall <br />
over backwards and Paul then proceeded to kick off him as the ape then sent the plain <br />
green wolf like titan into the other muscle bound monsters, falling like boiling pins.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tuu clum-zee.&quot; Paul grunted out.<br />
<br />
Nick leapt foreword next but the great ape gave the beast a bear hug with his legs and <br />
then did a double sided karate chop to both sides of Nick's neck right on some nasty <br />
nerve points that caused Nick to topple over like a timbered tree now resembling a lumpy <br />
gray floor rug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hiiii-yaaaaa!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick did a flying kick that Paul managed to side step (just barely) and Nicole rebounded <br />
off the wall and came at him swinging as he stood on one leg blocking with three of his <br />
limbs with equal precision, Nicole sweep under his single foot he was using to stand only <br />
for him to enter a hand stand as he began to box with her using his legs. Then use one of <br />
his arms to grab Nicole by the tail causing her to scream and fall over but managed to use <br />
her mass to dog pile Paul onto the floor with her for the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;FORGET THE STUPID MONKEY! Get the old woman!&quot; Nicole shouted, &quot;I'll deal with King <br />
Kong!&quot;<br />
<br />
The three remaining conscious big males obeyed, and leaped over them, as Paul tried to <br />
follow only for Nicole to grab one of his legs which then punched her in the face.  Ashley <br />
tried to interfere on her friend and packmate's behalf, but instead just got a backhand to <br />
the front of her muzzle!<br />
<br />
Nicole at this point had her pride on the line, no way she could use to a big ape and have <br />
to tell her cousin Alexandra about it!<br />
<br />
Sarah and Ulysses carefully snuck around the unconscious form of Nick the face smacked <br />
Ashley and the dueling Paul and Nicole.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yuu bil-ilt fur ter-ring en' klall-ring, Ei bil-ilt fur grass-ping!&quot; Paul said as he grabbed <br />
Nicole's wrists and ankles and began to head-butt her as she tried to bite his face off.<br />
<br />
Ashley grabbed onto him from behind, but was slammed into a wall as the orange and <br />
gray beast dueled and lost her grip though leaving her claw marks on his back, Paul only <br />
cry out for one instant as Nicole tried to break out of his grip to no avail and the two <br />
continued their struggle.<br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary! Mary!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm right here mommmy!&quot; Mary answered right next to her mother, feeling glade she had <br />
chosen to leave Lance in her bedroom after all, not wanting the poor stuffed animal to be <br />
caught in the middle of this.<br />
<br />
Paul bought them time, very precious time. It was daylight, they were in a populated <br />
neighborhood in the morning,  the perfectly logical thing to do was go outside.  Sadly, <br />
Nicole had known that too and had been precise in her orders.<br />
<br />
Lawrence leapt barring the front door. &quot;Madam Serenity I presume? Our Master wants a <br />
word with you and Mr. Trevor... what the?&quot; Lawrence blinked he saw Mary, Brian bunched <br />
Lawrence in the muzzle, Lawrence punched back sending Brain flying into the couch the <br />
wind knocked out of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;BACK WAY!&quot; Madam Serenity shouted, she had never known any group that created <br />
members via the game to ever leave witnesses. During the kidnapping saga, one 'scared <br />
and obvious mentally disturbed woman' had gone right back to her parents for help, the <br />
kidnapper ended up with two extra victims. Serenity knew by logic what would happen to <br />
the Hardys if she just gave herself up.<br />
<br />
A green muscle wolf got in their way, Serenity used the element of surprise: grabbed and -<br />
THREW- the giant wolf over her shoulder laying him flat on his back breaking a table off <br />
it's legs in the process. Serenity felt her shoulder blade crack as she did it, but ignored it <br />
and just gritted her teeth.<br />
<br />
Trevor stood up at the noise and screaming, but didn't get a word in as the party fled past <br />
him, Serenity grabbing him by the back of his neck Trevor flying off the floor and <br />
knocking the saucer of milk over onto the tiles.<br />
<br />
However, the way out via the kitchen was quickly blocked by a large charcoal gray wolf <br />
muscle monster.<br />
<br />
&quot;What-the-THEY'RE HERE! THEY'RE HERE!&quot; Trevor screamed at the top of his lungs. The <br />
Hardys didn't have time to be confused and alarmed by Serenity's cat talking.<br />
<br />
&quot;DEN-DEN-STUDY!&quot; Brain gasped out, the wolves feeling like they have the mice trapped.<br />
<br />
In a glorified game of cat and mouse, Mary appreciating the irony, they practically leapt <br />
inside the study, Felicity locking the door behind them.<br />
<br />
Trevor looked around and shouted, &quot;What about Paul?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still out there.&quot; Serenity groaned feeling lower than low.<br />
<br />
&quot;So are those things.&quot; Brain gasped out.<br />
<br />
There was a chuckle on the other side, &quot;Come out, come out wherever you are, where are <br />
you? Are you HERE? No? Oh wait, you're HERE! No? Oh, naw, I bet you're not -HERE-&quot; THe <br />
door shuddered. &quot;OW! SON-of-a!&quot;<br />
<br />
Brain breathed out holding his stomach. &quot;We paid several tax returns and then some on <br />
this room. That door frame is tempered steel, the door is reinforced. Those things will <br />
have better luck smashing through the walls first. This is where we keep our family <br />
treasures.&quot;<br />
<br />
The door shuddered, then again, then again, and again, moving a micro meter each time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you a witch?&quot; Felicity asked point blank.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I'm not.&quot; Serenity said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But your cat can talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a victim of the game, just like her.&quot; Trevor said simply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you use it change back then?&quot; Felicity asked feeling very weird talking to a cat <br />
in spite of her daughter's species.<br />
<br />
&quot;My curse is like Serenity's, I can't, and anyone I make friends with losses the ability to <br />
understand anything I express to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you're not insane because?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I honestly wonder about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
The door never once stopped shuddering.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're going to knock the door frame clean out of the wall.&quot; Mary shuddered feeling very <br />
scared. The wall around the door began to crack. And fast.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't suppose you have a gun or anything in here for house defense.&quot; Serenity sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our daughter is seven years old, what do you think?&quot; Felicity said simply.<br />
<br />
&quot;I turn eight next month.&quot; Mary grumbled.<br />
<br />
Felicity took Mary by the shoulders and knelt down looking her daughter in the eyes, <br />
&quot;Mary, there is something very important mommy and daddy need you to do for us. It's to <br />
help save us from those monsters. Can you do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity couldn't believe this, &quot;What have I been -saying- this whole time?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Madam Serenity, please shut up.&quot; Brain said simply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now,&quot; Felicity said still holding her child and not breaking eye contact, &quot;Did Madam <br />
Serenity explain how the game you got a turn in yesterday works?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She explained everything.&quot; Mary said not wanting to confess to her mother she had <br />
listened in on a conversation that her parents obviously hadn't wanted her to hear.<br />
<br />
Serenity felt like she was an audience of a disaster movie unable to do anything but what <br />
the planes crash.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, listen to mommy very carefully sweat heart, we're all depending on you,&quot; Felicity <br />
implored her cub, &quot;We need you to ask us both Transform or Dare, and after a minute tell <br />
us to Transform into civilized lion people who can stand up to the monsters and Dare us <br />
not to use the game on unwilling people unless it's to transform them back or de-<br />
brainwash them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity realized, &quot;WHY DON'T WE DO THAT NOW? They could hear us if Mary shouts loud <br />
enough!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary remembered what Ulysses said, &quot;No, they can't, Ulys', remember the boy I told you <br />
about but you can't remember mom? He said that they worded their turn so they CAN'T be <br />
changed back...&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity heart sunk as did Trevor's along with the parents who felt no joy at the news that <br />
the alternative wouldn't work. Serenity remembered she had told Julie about her own <br />
curse.. of course Julie would tell that information to Jensen...  'This Jensen is much much <br />
smarter than any 'harem owner' I've faced. Dammit no, there still has to be a way to save <br />
them, THERE HAS TO BE! They have lives! Families! Hopes and Dreams of their own! Jensen <br />
robbed them of those! I can't give up!' But now... who knew what other safety precautions <br />
they had taken?<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, please, do it now.&quot; Felicity begged Mary.<br />
<br />
Mary wanted to scream this wasn't right, that she was really human, that she was really a <br />
teenager around Ulysses' age! That... that if she waited any longer, she'd likely be trading <br />
her scratching post in for dog biscuits.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy, daddy? Truth, I mean, Transform or Dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor saw the cracks around the door connected with other cracks. They would break <br />
through in thirty seconds.<br />
<br />
'We need more time.' Trevor thought. 'Are you watching Queen?'<br />
<br />
The doorframe was pushed out of the wall... not enough for nearly seven foot tall wolf <br />
men to squeeze through... however.<br />
<br />
&quot;BONZAI-COWABUNGA!&quot; Trevor screamed at the top of his lungs leaping at the wolf <br />
monster at the front of the pack smashing the door down.<br />
<br />
&quot;TREVOR Don't kill yourself now!&quot; Serenity screamed in horror.<br />
<br />
Trevor, using the book case next to the door, squeezed through the widening opening at <br />
the door frame's top. Trevor felt his damaged rear leg rip anew in fresh spanking new <br />
pain. And before everything was said and done, Trevor was sure he felt muscles tear, he <br />
was too busy to notice.<br />
<br />
Trevor landed squarely on the wolf's face, hissing and snarling up a storm, the other <br />
wolves instantly distracted. Trevor never stopped clawing, claws digging into fur and flesh, <br />
the wolf man took a step back from his fellows, their sheer size making maneuvering in <br />
the enclosed hallway a nightmare.<br />
<br />
&quot;GETOFFGETOFFGETOFF!&quot; The beast's claws shadowed downward on Trevor.<br />
<br />
Trevor clawed onto the top of the wolf's head, and he felt claws of his bandaged leg dig <br />
into something round, soft, vulnerable, that was cut open by Trevor's claws.<br />
<br />
&quot;MYEYE!!!&quot; The wolf man screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was for Queen! Tell the black gold ugly one I'm coming for him!&quot;<br />
<br />
The claws were on Trevor's back in a second, he felt their bone knives slice along his back, <br />
Trevor leapt, and bit into the wolves' ear and leaping down, the ear tearing off like a piece <br />
of canvas with the same ripping sound, blood slashed into the cat as Trevor let go of the <br />
falling piece of flesh and then bit onto the wolves' tail.<br />
<br />
The wolf man screamed even more now one eye closed forever and a stream of blood <br />
where one of his ears used to be. The wolf man swung his tail as best his could to get <br />
Trevor off, Trevor bit into nerves and bone not letting go, he did however lose a fang that <br />
remained imbedded in the wolf's tail as the law of motion overruled Trevor's <br />
determination and he went flying, hitting the hallway wall -just- missing a glass portrait <br />
that would have cut up his inside, the impact was enough as he suffered a second impact <br />
as he hit the floor a moment later, all the world upside down and inside out as his brain <br />
and legs seemed to have opposing ideas about how to stand up.<br />
<br />
One of the other wolves snarled while the other two tried to stop the bleeding of their <br />
teammate, &quot;Someone tie up or the break legs up or SOMETHING that little devil! I don't <br />
care if we were to bring him back unharmed! I'm sure Master won't mind if the cat a <br />
couple more broken legs after this ****ING STUNT!&quot;<br />
<br />
That was when the door, that they had all forgotten about for about ninety seconds, finally <br />
gave, but it didn't go inside, it went outward!<br />
<br />
Roger was caught off guard as the door and door frame (themselves still not broken, <br />
opened, or damaged seriously in any way whatsoever) went into the hallway right into him, <br />
smashing into the opposite side leaving an impression.<br />
<br />
Trevor's blurred eyes saw a reddish gold and brownish gold humanoid shapes riding the <br />
inside of the doorway as it came into the hallway on of the wolf. Trevor smiled lion very <br />
similar to Mary's scent.<br />
<br />
He heard an adult lioness snarl, no, that was putting it too lightly, he heard an adult <br />
lioness -roar- in english, &quot;This is our home! You're trespassing! GET-OUT!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;THE HELL!&quot; Zack had time to swear before he got a double pawed kick to the stomach that <br />
made him grunt.<br />
<br />
The two yellow shaped attacked in full force, and the wolves, simply not being as limber or <br />
as fast as them, began to edge back.<br />
<br />
Trevor felt wetness all over his back, he saw redness all over his gray and black fur... <br />
'Dang... am I gonna bleed to death? How much blood does a cat have in it?'<br />
<br />
A smaller yellow shape ran out of the room the larger wolves distracted that gently picked <br />
him up off the floor and spoke in Mary's voice, &quot;It's okay Trevor! I'm here! You're gonna be <br />
okay! Promise!&quot;<br />
<br />
That was when a purple shaped crashed into Mary, and the two rolled around, Trevor <br />
hitting the floor again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't wanna fight your Ulee!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't wanna fight you Mary! But you all gotta see Master and join da pack!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm part of a pride already! Please Trevor! I don't wanna hurt ya!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't either!&quot;<br />
<br />
Needless to say, both voices sounded like this was the last thing in the universe any of <br />
them wanted to be doing.<br />
<br />
Trevor felt elderly hands grab him and pull him into the study, and he felt a soft but firm <br />
shape go against his back stemming the bleeding. &quot;Don't you die yet understand?&quot; Madam <br />
Serenity's voice told him sternly.<br />
<br />
A second later one of the wolf men screamed as one of the yellow shapes used leverage to <br />
dislocate bones.<br />
<br />
That was when they heard a great ape snarl. It was followed by a female wolf screaming <br />
the words, loathing every syllable, &quot;RETREAT!!&quot;<br />
<br />
The wolves retreated, the yellow shapes followed. One grabbed a chain for snow tires that <br />
they had been planning to put away for months now that lay in the living room as the <br />
wolves for whatever reason fled to the bathroom. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where do you think you're going?&quot; One asked and threw the chains like a lasso also as it <br />
wrapped around he angle of Ashley and pulled her own, she could actually appreciate the <br />
irony as the defender on top of her landed pressing down on her and hog tying her with <br />
the snow chains. <br />
<br />
The two other yellowish shapes charged after the wolves, who retreated THROUGH the <br />
MIRRORS in the bathroom. The defenders didn't hesitate, and smashed them all then <br />
proceeded to do the same with the rest in the house.</p>
