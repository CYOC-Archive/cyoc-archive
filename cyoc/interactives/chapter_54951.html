<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>"Is it true?" a cute voice whispered in Sean's ear. A quick glance revealed a buxom young lady in a slinky black cocktail dress. Sean barely got out a nod before the lady had one arm around his arm and another arm draped across his shoulder in just the right way that she could rub the back of Sean's earlobe. On top of the trickle of arousal from the vision of cleavage Sean had just been given, the surprise intimacy attack on his earlobe sent a quick reinforcement campaign of a shiver down his spinal and directly into that surprisingly happy female arousal center situated betwixt his legs.</p>

<p>With only the gentlest of nudges, the lady in the black dress very simply and quickly moved Sean to a dark, back corner of the party. She lead him to a sofa that Sean might never had noticed had he not been sitting on it. She sat at an angle, ensuring that Sean got a good show of her ample bosom and placed her hand girlishly in Sean's lap. She began whispering again, intimately and only to Sean's ear. "That's very interesting. You see, I'm more than a bit bi-, and if you are telling me the truth, you would be the hottest lady at this stagfest party, to me at least..."</p>

<p>She slowly spider walked one of her hands to Sean's belt buckle and then into his pants. She made a huge grin as her hand made contact and then began to even more slowly probe Sean's one lady part. Another intimate whisper, "By the way, the name is Jill, and I think you feel now why my name's also a bit of my reputation..."</p>

<p>"She-- Shaw-- Sean." Sean was unsurprisingly out of breath, but managed to get his breath out. Shawn was more surprised by whatever magic Jill seemed to have to conjure drinks as it seemed that no more than a few seconds passed between Jill gently removing her hand from inside Sean's pants as she was passing, with that very same hand, Sean a beer, all the while drinking a beer of her own with her other hand...</p>

<hr />

<p>When Sean awoke the first thing he noticed was the bright pink chest hair on his chest. The very next thing he noticed was the surprisingly large breasts that were covered by that hair. Things were still hazily coming together in Sean's mind, but he couldn't quite place at what point in the evening he'd gifted those to himself.</p>

<p>A sleepy groan reminded Sean that Jill was sharing his bed. Jill made a brief, semi-conscious scratch of her balls as if she had them for years, but Sean could more vividly remember bestowing a penis upon her for good behavior somewhere around the second or third 69 of the night. Used condoms in the wastebasket laid testament to activities that transpired after that.</p>

<p>Sean stood and eyed himself in the mirror. His body was as tall as it had been, if not a tad taller, and his body was as muscular as it had been most recently Chronivac augmented, if not even leaner, toner, and deadlier looking. But his body was definitely curvier; his six-pack abs were edged with a womanly hip to bust swoop. Sean was slowly awakening to the realization that it may be time for him to switch pronouns, his body now wildly feminine looking with both key characteristics of a lady: the breasts and the vagina.</p>

<p>On the wilder side, Sean's hair, which was longer and had been tied into pigtails at some point in the night, was bright pink. So was his chest hair, which seemed even hairier than he remembered it being even if the color at times seemed almost invisible except when it caught the light in just the right way. Even stranger was that curtains certainly matched the drapes in the mirror-- as shocking as the pink seemed, it appeared to be Sean's new "natural" color. Surprisingly less strange to Sean, after determining that, was the well-trimmed, full beard he sported, again in that very same pink shade. It was a close battle, but in the end Sean decided that the pink chest hair covering D-cup breasts was the more weirdly masculine feature, edging out the full beard on an otherwise pouty, feminine face.</p>

<p>By this point, Jill had already started teasingly putting a bra on Sean. Jill had her own bra on and pair of sweatpants supposedly from Sean's collection that outlined well her endowments of both ass and crotch bulge. Wordlessly they made their way to the apartment's living room couch without any further clothing.</p>

<p>It wasn't long after sitting down and watching a bit of muted television that a guy, with a hugely embarrassed look came out of Jay's room. Very quickly he looked Sean up and down, Sean managing to cross his legs before a repeat eye-balling, glanced to Jill about to do the same, caught note of her pants bulge, remembered his embarrassment plus interest, and nearly bolted straight through the door on his way out of the apartment.</p>

<p>Dan exited his room shortly after the embarrassed man left. Sean was nearly shocked by Dan's appearance, not so much because Dan was dressed in a business suit and readying for work-- although that was surprising as Sean hadn't remembered up to that point that it was a weekday-- but because while the top-half of Dan's business suit was suitably normal, his lower half was entirely different. Dan was wearing a tiny skirt, stockings, and heels that all showed off an incredible set of woman's legs. The shock of it cleared a few more cobwebs from Sean's head and he suddenly remembered cursing Dan with sexier legs in the hopes that it might make Dan less of an "uptight bitch". Dan had particularly deserved it in Sean's drunken mind because he had been trying to ask something of Sean and kept interrupting Sean and Jill's busy sessions.</p>

<p>"What was it you wanted, again, last night?" Sean asked of Dan, while Dan was preparing a bowl of cereal.</p>

<p>Dan sat, cross-legged, on the couch, and started into his bowl of cereal before responding. He kept his voice low, "Well, I was trying to be the good sober roommate and keep an eye on the two of you. The idiot," with a nod to the room that the embarrassed had recently escaped from, "drank even more than you did in an ill-conceived drinking contest, the details I shall save for later. Suffice it to say, a himbo was brought back, the idiot was ill stocked on prophylactics, and I thought to ask you--" Dan stopped mid-sentence as a very hungover, but otherwise very same-looking Jay stumbled to the restroom. Sean was glad that he had refrained from changing at least one of his roommates during the drunken night...</p>

<p>Sean gasped a bit, "I didn't have any spare condoms last night..." and a glance a Jill's face before breaking the lie, "...er, not any that I would give to <i>you</i> last night... Jay didn't..." All Dan had to do was nod, "I'm pretty sure the idiot hasn't been keeping up on his pill, either..." Sean frowned, "You don't suppose he might have..." Dan shushed Sean as Jay stumbled back out of the bathroom, having obviously heaved up, possibly more than just leftover hangover heaving, and went back to his room. Dan and Sean and Jill just sort of stared at Jay's closed door for a few minutes.</p>

<p>"Let's hope, for all of our sakes, that the idiot <i>didn't</i>." Dan said as he got up, put his bowl in the kitchen and prepared to head to work, making a grim sign of a big belly pregnancy to regrettably leave them with.</p></p>
