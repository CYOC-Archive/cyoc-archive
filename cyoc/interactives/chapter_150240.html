<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Leaving the gigantic boy alone in the changing rooms to explore his new body, Ty wandered in search of another boy to grow. He still wanted to stay in the store however, since the changing rooms provided a really good opportunity to change people without others noticing. Then he spotted another boy wandering around the store. This one looked older, around 15 or 16. He was looking for replacement shoes. Ty wanted to have some fun with him, so he discreetly followed him.<br />
<br />
The boy wandered up to the counter and asked for the shoes in a Size 7. Ty frowned. That was a little small for his taste. Then he had an idea. Gleefully, Ty wished that the boy&#39;s feet would grow one size larger. Peeking around the corner, Ty saw the boy&#39;s feet expand just slightly outwards. He wished that the boy would not notice any changes happening.<br />
<br />
Just then, the clerk returned, and the boy attempted to put on the shoes. However, he found that they were now too tight! Confused, the boy called the clerk back over and requested a larger size. The clerk suggested a Size 9 and left to get the shoes.<br />
<br />
Trying to hold back his laughter, Ty wished that the boy&#39;s feet would grow to a Size 10, so that the shoes would still be too small. Again peeking around the corner, he saw the boy&#39;s socks seem to stretch further across the floor as his feet expanded inside the fabric.<br />
<br />
The clerk returned again with larger shoes, and the boy attempted to put the shoes on, but again he was surprised to find the shoes were too tight. Confused, the boy requested an even larger Size 12 shoe. Ty was surprised the boy was going up by three sizes, but he wasn&#39;t going to argue. As the clerk left, Ty wished that the boy&#39;s feet would grow to a Size 12 to perfectly fit the shoes. Looking around the corner one last time, he saw the socks strain...<br />
<br />
RIIIIIIIIPPPP. The sound caught the boy&#39;s attention. He looked down and was shocked to see that his sock had actually ripped open, exposing a sliver of his feet. The boy reached down and removed the socks, exposing his bare feet. He then walked over to the aisle with socks and quickly bought some new ones, so that he could try on the shoes when the clerk returned.<br />
<br />
As the boy walked across the floor, Ty marvelled at his new feet. They no longer looked too small for him. In fact, quite the opposite - Size 12 looked a little ridiculous on the boy, as he was only 5&#39;6&quot; or so. The boy sat down and managed to perfectly fit the new Size 12s on his feet. He happily paid for the shoes and got up to browse more products.<br />
<br />
As he browsed, Ty was getting quite bothered by the boy&#39;s big feet. It wasn&#39;t that they were big, no he liked that. But they looked almost out of place on his frame. Ty wished that the boy would grow 5 inches taller, bringing him to 5&#39;11&quot;.<br />
<br />
Browsing the shelves, the boy groaned just slightly, and his legs and spine lengthened, causing him to shoot up just a bit. He now stood at 5&#39;11&quot;! He didn&#39;t seem to notice however, as he kept browsing the shelves.<br />
<br />
Ty had to stifle a laugh though. The growth meant that his shirt (which Ty had noticed was already a little small for him) was riding high.<br />
<br />
The boy pulled something from a clothes rack, and Ty craned to see what it was. With a start, he realized it was an athletic cup, one of the ones used to protect your junk in sports. The boy must be an athletic type, Ty guessed. Whatever the case, he had a funny idea. He silently wished that when the boy put on his cup, his cock and balls would grow big enough to not fit in the cup. The boy had grabbed a small size, a medium, a large and an XL, so Ty knew there was a lot of room inside. He was counting on that.<br />
<br />
Heading back to the change room, the boy stripped down, placed the cup inside his briefs and pulled them back over his cock and balls. Before he did, Ty noted he was average, maybe a bit below with about 3 inches soft. At first he smiled, but after a few moments he frowned slightly. Then he tried to rearrange his junk in the cup. He tried several different ways before giving up and pulling it off.<br />
<br />
As he pulled off the cup, Ty took a look. It was true! His cock had grown, although not much. Ty guessed the boy was swinging closer to 4.5 inches soft now. It wasn&#39;t much of a change, but there were many more cups to go through.<br />
<br />
Stripping down again, the boy placed the medium cup over his cock to test, then pulled his briefs up. Ty noted that the cup created a larger bulge than the other one had previously. After a few moments though, again a frown crossed the boy&#39;s face. He tried rearranging the cup, but to no avail, he pulled his briefs down.<br />
<br />
Now Ty had to look. Oh god, it was definitely bigger. Ty estimated his cock was now about 6 inches soft! It had also become slightly thicker this time. But the real show were the boy&#39;s balls. This time, they had swollen just slightly to the size of ping pong balls.<br />
<br />
Now without the cup as the boy pulled up his briefs, Ty noted that there was a small but noticeable bulge where there hadn&#39;t been one before. Again the boy left and returned, this time with two different sizes. Ty read the tags: L and XL. Oh boy, he was so excited.<br />
<br />
The boy tried the large size first. He again tucked his cock and balls inside the cup and pulled his briefs up. The bulge that the cup created in his briefs was so large, it would be impossible to hide on the field or wherever the boy played. And yet Ty could just imagine the boy&#39;s cock swelling up, growing longer inside the cup and making it uncomfortable...<br />
<br />
Annoyance flashed across the boy&#39;s face. He removed the briefs again and the cup. Ty&#39;s eyes went wide as the boy&#39;s cock flopped out of the cup and hung down. It had to be 8 inches soft, and it was more veiny now. It had also swollen thicker. The boy&#39;s balls had also swollen again, this time to the size of plums.<br />
<br />
Placing the L cup down and picking the XL cup up, Ty almost whistled at the size of it. It was so big that it almost wouldn&#39;t even fit in the boy&#39;s briefs! Ty wished the boy&#39;s cock and balls would only grow to comfortably fit the cup. Once more the boy tucked his enormous cock and balls into the cup and pulled up his briefs. The bulge was obscene, unbelievable that anyone his age would need a cup this large. Yet after a few seconds, the boy relaxed. &quot;About time&quot; he whispered under his breath. Ty guessed that meant his cock had grown to size.<br />
<br />
The boy pulled down his briefs and pulled off the cup and Ty&#39;s eyes bugged out. If his cock had been huge before, it was monstrous now. Hanging from the boy&#39;s groin was a fat 10 inch soft cock, with balls the size of tennis balls. Pulling up his briefs and his shorts, the boy still sported an extremely generous bulge.<br />
<br />
Ty was left stuttering as the boy left the room with huge feet, a huge bulge, and a little taller.</p>
