<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff ran as fast as he could down the hallway, all 5’7” and 118 pounds of him.  The scrawny, naked 16-year-old twink’s feet slipped on the floor like a cartoon character as he took the corner to the stairs, the big lumbering 6’5” and 260 pound hairy muscle jock hot on his trail and shaking the floor with his impressive bulk.  The nearly hairless teen laughed as he tripped on a step and one of Scott’s big meat-hooks nearly caught him by the ankle.  But the boy recovered quickly, scurrying up the stairs, yelling after himself, “Face it, donkey – I’m faster and smarter!”  He laughed some more as he reached the top of the stairs.<br />
<br />
Behind him, Scott ran full steam ahead, braying loudly (the meaning clearly ‘oh really?’ by the intonation), and swatting for the boy with his big, hairy arms.  His long donkey ears and donkey tail – a new ‘gift’ courtesy of Jeff – twitched and made the otherwise intimidating quarterback look comical and even cute – in a ‘petting zoo’ kind of way.  The whole house vibrated as the imposing yet adorable beast ascended the stairs.<br />
<br />
“Aww, donk, don’t feel bad – we can put some side-bags on you and you’ll have a bright future in the food delivery industry!”  The small teen chuckled, running into Scotty’s room and closing the door.<br />
<br />
It had been half an hour since Jeff reverted to his true form during sex with his boyfriend.  The two had sat stunned for some time after, talking a little about the Chronivac, but still too blindsided by reality to actually try changing it again with the device.  Being in mid-orgasm when it happened had helped ease Scotty into accepting the fact that the Chronivac was real and his boyfriend had been telling the truth, otherwise he was pretty sure he would have totally flipped.<br />
<br />
So they kept the conversation safe, Jeff discovering that the new units could operate by the ocular “HUD” display, holographic projection, in sync with wireless devices, or through voice command.  Scott mostly sat and listened, in a strange state of afterglow mixed with shock.<br />
<br />
But as the two got cleaned up and made a quick breakfast, Scotty found that even though the real Jeff wasn’t normally his type, there was something attractive and familiar about him.  There were moments when a physical quality would just stand out and Scott felt an undeniable attraction.  Or when the sound of his voice was unmistakably the Jeff he knew, despite it being much higher and younger sounding.<br />
<br />
He learned quickly that while he looked different, Jeffy was definitely still Jeffy – he had the same sweet caring, not to mention the quick wit and wicked humor Scotty loved (and was sometimes goaded by).  Their interests were somewhat different – Jeff was into science fiction and generally more creative and not so much an athlete, but that was okay.  He was curious about football, which was something to build on.  It was just strange how in some ways Scotty knew Jeffy like the back of his hand, and in other ways he was getting to know his boyfriend all over again.  The size and two-year age gap took a little getting used to, but that wouldn’t be an issue so much as time went on.<br />
<br />
Scotty got to his bedroom door.  He turned the handle and threw it open just in time to see Jeffy’s feet disappear under the bed with a crazed giggle. “Haaaaw,” Scotty brayed, as if to say, ‘Yeah you better hide!”  It was unbelievably frustrating for Scotty to have his voice reduced to animal brays – but he worked with it and the meaning was pretty clear.  Most infuriating, this was turning him on big time.<br />
<br />
It was after their impromptu breakfast that the two turned their attention more seriously to the Chronivac.  “Why call it a Chronivac, anyway?” Scotty had asked.  “It sounds like some kind of time-saving vacuum.”<br />
<br />
“I dunno,” Jeffy responded.  “Guess because Roomba was already taken.”  Jeff had scanned his boyfriend’s kinks at that point, and was surprised to learn the jock was actually turned on by the donkey transformation in Pinocchio, among other things.  So Scotty liked being called ‘donkey’?  That’s when Jeffy got the mischievous notion to ‘donk’ his boyfriend.  Scotty was in the bathroom at the time, washing his hands in front of the sink when suddenly his ears shot up, all furry on both sides of his head.  Jeff grinned with a snicker as loud brays emanated from the bathroom, and a second later Scotty burst naked into the dining room after his boyfriend, complete with a new set of donkey ears and a tail.  He had ditched the shorts he was wearing – they were too uncomfortable with his new appendage - not to mention his large erection.<br />
<br />
Scotty had grabbed Jeffy’s shorts as he got up to flee the freshly donked football jock, and Jeffy briskly shed them and escaped what he laughingly called ‘the braying one’.<br />
<br />
Scrambling through the downstairs, the boys were quite a spectacle to behold.  Jeffy was a master at getting a rise out of his boyfriend in so many ways, and called after him, taunting, “Don’t worry dude… you still hawwwt.”<br />
<br />
With bellowing brays and new resolve, Scotty had nearly caught the twink as he disappeared into the hallway.<br />
<br />
Now, here they were in his bedroom.  Scotty had him cornered.  With a self-satisfied grin, he got down on his hands and knees.”<br />
<br />
“Look at that, in your natural position,” Jeffy laughed wildly from under the bed.<br />
<br />
Scotty reached under the bed, nearly getting the other boy, but Jeff was as slippery as a fish.  Then unexpectedly, a slim hand reached out and grabbed Scotty’s big, hard cock.  Jeffy appeared from under the bed as Scotty sat on his ass, breathing heavily.  Jeff held his boyfriend’s cock in his hand, tapping it like a microphone, “Is this thing on?”<br />
<br />
“Hawww,” Scotty rested, surrendering to his incorrigible boyfriend, his hairy chest going up and down, catching his breath after their tearing through the house.<br />
<br />
“Thank you, thank you all for coming,” Jeffy spoke into his boyfriend’s cock like it was a mic.  “I’d like to dedicate this song to my boyfriend – a prince among asses – and quite a nice ass on him too.”<br />
<br />
Donk rolled his eyes and just made a sound between a grumble and a bray.  Then, his ears stood upright when he heard Jeffy start to sing into his cock, the twink’s big blue eyes looking up at him with humor that slowly transitioned to adoring and affection.  Scott had never heard Jeff sing in the timeline the Chronivac had constructed for them, but of course jock Jeff’s voice was much lower.  Donk Scott simply sat there in surprise at hearing the boy’s voice.  He was really good – the words ‘voice of an angel’ came to mind.  Scotty found himself genuinely moved by the song, despite the frustration at losing his voice, growing donkey parts, and being turned on even more by his boyfriend grabbing his cock and singing to it.<br />
<br />
Jeffy finished singing, his face taking on that serene expression Scotty recognized from whenever they had shared a special moment. He released his boyfriend’s cock, sitting opposite him, cross-legged.  “I love you, donkey.”  He rubbed one of donkey&#39;s ears, and judging from his boyfriend&#39;s expression it felt pretty good.  “You can talk now.”<br />
<br />
“I… I had no idea you could sing,” Scotty said quietly.  “That was beautiful.”<br />
<br />
“Not as beautiful as you,” Jeffy rubbed his boyfriend&#39;s furry ear some more, and Scotty&#39;s eyes nearly rolled back in his head.<br />
<br />
One thing was for sure.  Life with Jeffy was full of surprises.</p>
