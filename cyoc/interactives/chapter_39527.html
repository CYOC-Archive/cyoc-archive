<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>Opening the door to the next room, Peter kept one of his hands on your shoulder, which was what you wanted. Even though the door was open, Peter allowed you to step through first and he followed close behind with both hands on your shoulders, one on each side. As you look around the room, you smile seeing the familiar full-moon style painting and light fixture on the ceiling. While looking up at the mural-like ceiling painting, you realize that that particular moon was bigger and gave off slightly more light than in the previous room with the tanks. Also, the painted sky was a dark royal blue with gray clouds that were scattered here and there that were thick and billowy. Looking up, still feeling his strong hands on your shoulders, you really enjoy him and what you were looking at.</Br>
<Br>"So where are we now exactly Peter?"</Br>
<Br>"Well, the last room was where the tanks were, which held the fermenting full-moonshine. Where we are now is actually where the fluid of the brew gets filtered when the tanks are emptied so that the hops doesn't get into the beer. Sometimes, a seed or two of the hops does get through and then the beer is discarded."</Br>
<Br>"So once it is bottled and a tester tests a couple from the batch and finds that there is a seed or two left over, you just... throw it away?" You finished sounding astounded by the possible waste.</Br>
<Br>Peter starts massaging your shoulders and your neck muscles that seemed a bit sore for some reason. Not wanting him to stop, you place your hands on top of his, enjoying the comfort he was bringing you. With your touch and not looking at Peter, you heard him sigh lightly and you knew inwardly that he was smiling too.</Br>
<Br>"No, if the brew is tainted by a seed or two, then the brew is re-introduced into the beginning of the process and is later bottled again. Brew is not something that we waste here, just like at the bar or when you are enjoying your brew. We use everything, down to the very last drop." He finishes, squeezing your neck muscles a bit harder, kneading the stress out of them that you had for some reason. "Man! You know your big muscles are super tight for some reason!"</Br>
<Br>Hearing the words "big muscles" was kind of strange. You knew you had worked out hard for the majority of your adult life and you were envied by some guys at the gym for what you had. Personally though, you never thought they were "big", but no person really ever does that is humble.</Br>
<Br>"What are you talking about Peter, you know my muscles are decent size but not necessarily <I>big</I>."</Br>
<Br>"You know, you humble guys are very hard to compliment because you never allow yourselves to accept the compliment for what it is worth."</Br>
<Br>You smile as you turn around to face Peter, noticing that something was very different about him now. His face was more defined with a chiseled jaw. You look him over with just your eyes and see that his muscles were huge like that of an Olympic god or something.</Br>
<Br>"Peter! Your muscles are huge! What happened because they weren't like that moments ago?"</Br>
<Br>Peter just scoffed. "What are you talking about. You know I have been this big for some time."</Br>
<Br>Knowing that he was mistaken and you weren't, you question Peter further.</Br>
<Br>"Um... no, you were just average moments ago, now you have muscles that are just as big as mine, if not bigger!"</Br>
<Br>Stumbling, knowing that the cat was out of the bag, so to speak Peter hung his head low. "Alright, you are right, but you need to know that the same can be said about you."</Br>
<Br>Confused like Peter tried to act, you question him on this too. "No Peter, I have been this way for a long while, not just suddenly. I have always had longer and sharper teeth with these muscles!"</Br>
<Br>"No, you honestly haven't! That is what the brew makes you think. It changes your insides to match what you are drinking. One special ingredient in our brew that makes ours the best is nanites. You know, tiny microscopic robots that go to work in your body to make it's programming come to reality."</Br>
<Br>"So... right now you are telling me that there are small robots changing me, making me think this is all normal? What am I to become then and how will I know that I am changing when they keep my mind unaware of the changes?"</Br>
<Br>"You are changing to meet what the brew represents. Obviously, the full-moonshine represents a werewolf. So, by drinking the brew, you become a werewolf yourself. If you really want to be aware of the changing, I can shut off that part of the programming with a tiny remote in my pocket. Most people can't even handle this much information and we just reset the memory and they keep on believing that they were always how they were. Do you want me to do that?"</Br>
<Br>"Yes, I want to be aware of the changes. To be honest, I don't know how I will react, but it's better than not knowing at all."</Br>
<Br>Peter nodded, dug into his pocket while pulling out the remote and hit a single button. In the blink of an eye, you look over yourself and see you and the changes. Happy with what has happened to you, your heart races with excitement, since you barely could build any muscle when you went to the gym.</Br>
<Br>"So... are you ok with things?" Peter says as he places his large and manly hands on your shoulders while you look each other face to face.</Br>
<Br>"Boy Peter, am I ever! This is awesome and to be honest, I don't think I will mind being a werewolf either. I have always thought they were cool in movies and what-not. So what the hell? I will be a full fledged werewolf!"</Br>
<Br>Peter smiles a toothy, fang-filled smile. "I am very glad to hear that. I have liked you from the moment I first saw you when the tour began and I was hoping this would be the outcome if you ever knew the truth. You see, I have been a werewolf my whole life and I was getting kind of lonely. Then, one day when I heard about this place and nanites, I got the idea to use that to my advantage and create drinks that would make people were-animals. The full-moonshine is really the only drink that is mass produced, but more often than not, people can't handle being a werewolf in the end so the nanites never allow the metamorphosis to come to completion, not to mention the nanites are only programmed to work in men. They get more muscular, hairier, slightly sharper teeth and the ability to grow a beard or whatever facial hairstyle men want in a matter of a couple days, not to mention never having to worry about male-pattern baldness. The nanites also tailor their bodies to how the man sees himself, muscles, hair color, hairiness and so on."</Br>
<Br>"That is so cool! So... what is to change next?"</Br></p>
