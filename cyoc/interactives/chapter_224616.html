<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny had yet another breakfast of dog food. This time she had skipped the spoon and simply scooped put the food with her hands. While doing this, she noticed the color of her nails were changing slightly. They had become darker. Obviously they were getting ready to become claws. Jenny wagged her tail. She was so smart for figuring that out.<br />
<br />
Sitting on the floor was more comfortable with her degigrade inclined legs. Jenny had thought she would have had another day before her legs changed but now she felt the air on her furry behind and no one cared. Jenny had to work quick, she wasn&#39;t sure if she would be human enough to attend school on Thursday. That gave her a lot of work and not a lot of time.<br />
<br />
After they were ready, Jenny practically danced on her forming paw pads, she could barely contain her excitement as Jeff attached the leash to her collar. On instinct she licked his cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;Down girl.&quot; Master Jeff ordered.<br />
<br />
Jenny worked hard to restrain herself. After a moment she was rewarded by a pet on her head. They made their way to school, and no one commented on her pants less state. It seemed a lot of students before Jenny had done the same thing on their paths to pethood.<br />
<br />
It would seem that one reason reality accepted harems like the one Jenny wanted to make was due to a certain amount of the human population not remaining human. There was probably some math that explained how this helped birth rates but Jenny figured she wouldn&#39;t understand it. Then again maybe it was so people who had a hard time finding a mate who would stay human could just jump on an existing relationship. It wasn&#39;t her concern anymore. <br />
<br />
While lost in her thoughts Oliver approached her. He was looking a lot more androgynous today. In fact, if she didn&#39;t know him she wouldn&#39;t have been able to answer if he was a boy or a girl. Thought the lumps forming under his shirt would have made her guess female. The shape of his eyes had also changed giving him a more Eurasian look, which reminded her that his race was also changing. Jenny wondered how much he was still packing in his pants and if there would be anything left on Wednesday. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Jenny.&quot; The soon to be ex-boy greeted her. &quot;I was wondering.... have you notice.... anything.... strange?&quot; Oliver seemed unsure of himself as he spoke.<br />
<br />
Jenny remembered that she had Jefd make him aware last night but that didn&#39;t mean he suddenly had knowledge of the chrinovac. Jenny didn&#39;t want to tell him about it yet, but she did make him aware that the world had changed so she couldn&#39;t abandon him and make him think he was alone with that knowledge. <br />
<br />
&quot;You mean how we are suddenly living in our fantasy world? Weird right?&quot; Jenny continued to get the books from her locker. &quot;What about it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Oliver leaned in quickly. &quot;So you know?&quot; He whispered. <br />
<br />
&quot;I do.&quot; She confirmed. Then an idea struck her. There was a way to lure Oliver into the harem without specifically telling him about it just yet. &quot;So does Jeff. No one else seems to though, so only talk about it with Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
A new girl, who most likely would be developing a new interest in boys, with only one boy she could confide in? That was one way to plant a seed for romance. Jenny&#39;s tail wagged. She was so smart, and looking at Oliver now she was certain he would be a cute girl. A cute girl would make a great mate for Master Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can talk about it with you too.&quot; Oliver said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not for long. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll be able to speak a lot longer. Remember, you&#39;re becoming a girl to replace me since I&#39;m becoming a dog.&quot; Jenny intentionally didn&#39;t mention that Oliver was supposed to replace her ON THE SQUAD. Maybe it would encourage the budding girl to replace Jenny as a girlfriend as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re okay with that?&quot; Oliver asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;It was my idea.&quot; Jenny told him.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a new voice joined the conversation as someone else approached them. &quot;I personally find it romantic.&quot; Alice said. She clearly hadn&#39;t heard the rest if the conversation. &quot;Giving yourself to someone like this, it&#39;s like the classic love story, Romeo and Juliette. Shakespeare really had a way with words, didn&#39;t he?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot; Jenny replied. She wasn&#39;t sure what Alice was talking about but she made a not to re-read some classics before she lost too much of her humanity to do that on her own.<br />
<br />
With what she hoped were some seeds that would lead Oliver joining the harem as Olivia, Jenny decided to work on her next target. She needed Alice before she worked on Sarah after all. &quot;Hey Alice, can we talk real quick?&quot; She gave an apologetic smile to Oliver. &quot;Privately. Sorry, girl business. You can join in a couple of days.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oliver left without any argument. Alice smiled at Jenny. &quot;So, what did you want to talk about?</p>
