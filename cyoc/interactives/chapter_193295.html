<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Walking down the school hallway, Jen spat out another pill shortly after leaving the infirmary. She looked for someone who could receive the new pill, but she couldn&#39;t find anyone around, so she saw no other option but to take it herself.<br />
<br />
She was afraid of what would happen to her after taking the pill, so she took a moment to swallow it, waiting until she was sure no one was around. It didn&#39;t take her long to feel that her head felt strange, she then saw her hair begin to fall out, but soon she totally lost her sight, She also lost the ability to speak and couldn&#39;t breathe, which strangely didn&#39;t seem like a need for Jen anymore. She then brought her hands to her &#39;head&#39;, and felt it take the shape of a cylindrical tube of meat, which left no doubt for her that her head had turned into a dick. Soon she felt spheres growing under her skin, which were the balls for her new cock.<br />
<br />
Jen, realizing that her ears were now in her armpits, heard footsteps approaching her. She didn&#39;t want to be seen at the moment, especially with the dick her head had become fully exposed, so she tried to run somewhere where she could hide, but she was totally blind and after a few steps she tripped over something that was in her path, falling to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Jen, I didn&#39;t mean to hurt you. I ended up getting in your way and you tripped over my dick.&quot; someone spoke to her, who recognized the voice as Clarissa&#39;s, a fellow cheerleader who had also been a victim of the TorD curse before.<br />
<br />
At this point she realized that her transformation wasn&#39;t over yet, as she felt something grow right in the middle, just below her breasts, which she felt and felt was a lonely third breast growing beneath the original pair. She then felt her nipples shift and open, allowing her to see again, but now her vision was covered by fabric as she had her eyes on her breasts now.<br />
<br />
At the same time a slit opened in her new third breast, which she soon realized was a mouth and used it to say &quot;Clarissa, please take me to a reserved place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, come with me.&quot;  Clarissa said and guided Jen by the hand leading her to an unoccupied classroom.<br />
<br />
Once Clarissa announced that she was safe, Jen took off her shirt and then her bra, so she could see again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you so much Clarissa, I didn&#39;t want to be seen like that. But how did you know it was me when I don&#39;t have a head anymore?&quot; Jen said<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you so much Clarissa, I didn&#39;t want to be seen like that. But how did you know it was me when I don&#39;t have a head anymore?&quot; Jen said<br />
<br />
&quot;I only know it&#39;s you because I saw your head just turning into a dick. But what happened for you to go through such a transformation? Don&#39;t tell me they applied the TorD curse on you too.&quot; Clarissa said<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right, I was the victim of the curse too. Thanks to Kyle I turned into this.&quot; Jen said<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand what you&#39;re going through, but don&#39;t worry, the perception of reality will make none other than those directly involved in the curse realize that there&#39;s something different. Look at my case, as the curse Stephanie applied to me required me to fuck you only she and the two of us know about the existence of my cock. I can walk with him exposed to the will that no one notices him. It seems like my dick is invisible to other people and no one can see it, but as I don&#39;t have a vagina anymore I&#39;m always seen as a genderless girl. The whole reality around me has changed and even my parents believe that I never had any genitalia.&quot; Clarissa said<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like to, but Kyle didn&#39;t put this factor in the curse on me. The curse makes me spit out a pill every hour and I have to make someone else take it or I will have to take it myself. Anyone who takes one of these pills undergoes a completely random transformation and to make matters worse everyone is aware that there is no change in reality. I have already had three victims before myself and I was able to confirm that.&quot; Jen said<br />
<br />
&quot;This Kyle has gone too far, it will get you in big trouble if someone finds out you are responsible for the mutations.&quot; Clarissa said<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, that&#39;s why I convinced the nurse that there&#39;s something in the water that activates if you get horny after drinking and causes the mutation, but I don&#39;t know what to do to keep the lie.&quot; Jen said<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I can help you, but only on one condition. I want you to fuck me.&quot; Clarissa said<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not serious, are you?&quot; Jen asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I am very serious. I&#39;ve always been grateful that when the curse was applied to me I was told I would have to fuck you, and I&#39;m so grateful that you let me fuck you willingly. After that time I didn&#39;t feel that almost uncontrollable urge to fuck you anymore, but I also didn&#39;t get any mates since no one wants to be with someone they see as genderless. The only advantage is that since no one can see my 4-foot horse dick, so no one notices anything I do involving it, even if it&#39;s jacking off in public. The problem is that even though I no longer have my pussy I&#39;m still a girl at heart and I want to be treated like one, and I want someone to fuck me with. Now that you&#39;ve got a dick too and you understand my situation then you can do me this favor, can&#39;t you?&quot; Clarissa said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, in what situation did I end up. Alright, I will fuck you.&quot; Jen said and with that Clarissa happily took off her clothes, turning her ass towards her fellow cheerleader.<br />
<br />
Jen was horny due to the side effect of her transformation, which made her find her friend&#39;s ass attractive. Eka then reached down and positioned her dickhead in front of Clarissa&#39;s asshole, lubricating the entrance with her precum and then pushing inside. She was taken aback, not only by the novelty of feeling a dick being stimulated, but also by the main part being where her head should be. Soon all the fear and hexitation were gone, so she only bothered to pleasure her friend while increasing her own. During her thrusts her breasts swayed, making her unable to focus on anything, but at the moment it wasn&#39;t important to her.<br />
<br />
Realizing by the sound that Clarissa stroked her horse cock while getting fucked, Jen decided to do something and stopped for a bit, only stopped long enough to take off her skirt, lower her panties and stick three fingers in her pussy. Soon she came, depositing some of the cum that came out of her dickhead into her friend&#39;s ass, with the rest hitting her back as Jen lost her balance and fell into a sitting position, preventing her from keeping her dickhead inside. This did not stop Clarissa from reaching her own orgasm a short time later.<br />
<br />
After the orgasms Clarissa thanked Jen and they both began to articulate a plan to make people believe that it was the water that was contaminated with something unknown that caused people to mutate.<br />
<br />
While they were talking, Jen felt another pill pop into her mouth and spit it into her hand, showing it to Clarissa and saying &quot;This is my curse pill. Now that I&#39;ve spat it out I have to give it to someone else or take it myself.&quot;</p>
