<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So...&quot; said Paldinoss as Kimberly reached the counter. &quot;What brings you to my shop? Seeking an advantage against a sworn enemy? Perhaps a magical cure for a loved one&#39;s ailment?&quot; <br />
<br />
He began to pace back and forth behind the counter, his voice picking up speed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe a way to explore the depths of the oceans? You wouldn&#39;t be the first. Infravision to ferret out the mysteries of the night? A gateway to another dimension? A source of power to focus your energies?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or perhaps...&quot; he said, pausing mid-rant, a glint of excitement appearing in his eyes as her turned to face her, &quot;you’re a Dragon Hunter?&quot; His excitement and energy seemed to hit a crescendo. &quot;To conquer the ancient beast with your companions and take their hoard for yourselves? Is it dragons?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh...no&quot; said Kimberly, slightly taken aback by Paldinoss&#39; sudden enthusiasm, &quot;To be honest I’m not completely certain what this place is.”<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; he said, seemingly deflating before her eyes. &quot;Nobody ever goes dragon hunting anymore.&quot; he grumbled to himself. Seemingly processing her last sentence, her turned, giving Kim a curious look.<br />
<br />
“Don’t you know what this place is? Didn’t you read the sign?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know what those symbols said”, said Kimberly, “I was just about to give up my search, when I saw your store and felt I…had to come in” to finished sheepishly.<br />
<br />
“Really?” said Paldinoss as he stroked his beard thoughtfully. <br />
<br />
Paldinoss quickly recovered his charming demeanor with a flourish and a smile. &quot;Well, my store does not reveal itself to a person unexposed to the arcane unless it feels they are worthy of adventure! And a wizard such as I could hardly deny that!&quot; <br />
The man gazes around at the many dusty artifacts. “…Or it feels it’s been too long since my last sale, it has been a while…” <br />
He turns his gaze back upon Kimberly, &quot;What is your name my dear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kimberly&quot; she replied, a hint of skepticism in her voice, &quot;so this place really is magic? You’re a wizard? It&#39;s all real?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As real as it can be&quot; he answered proudly, &quot;In here you will find greater glimpses into the &#39;real world&#39; than most people will find in their entire lives. I used to adventure throughout the planes, amassing a fair few of the relics you see before you.&quot; <br />
<br />
His eyes seemed to cloud over with the fog of memory, &quot;Fighting wyverns, saving princesses, even became a king...if only for a week.&quot; <br />
Paldinoss appeared to force himself back into the present. &quot;But my adventuring days are behind me. These days I spend my time studying ancient tomes, enchanting items, and helping youngsters like you have their own adventures&quot; he said, gesturing towards Kimberly. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, you mentioned a search? What is it you’re looking for?” <br />
<br />
“Well…” said Kimberly, “I was kind of looking for something fun to spice up my vacation with my friends.” She looks away from the man, feeling awkward, “I’m sorry, that sounds stupid after all that you said.”<br />
<br />
“Not at all dear girl!” the ‘wizard’ said, “Adventures can start from the least likely of places! How are you looking to &#39;enhance&#39; your vacation? I have some items that could take all of you to some wondrous planes. Or perhaps something to turn all of you into lions? I could transport you to a Savannah and you could experience life for a short time at the top of the food chain.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Uhh…”, She paused &quot;I&#39;m afraid we do already have the place picked out for our getaway, and if magic is indeed real I&#39;d like to start off small exploring it for the first time. I don&#39;t think my friends would forgive me if I got one of them eaten by an ogre or trapped in another dimension.”<br />
<br />
Kim laughed lightly to herself at the ridiculousness of what she just said. “No, my friends have all found different games or activities to keep us generally occupied for the duration of our getaway.”<br />
<br />
She hesitated for a second. This was all ridiculous, she was here in a junkshop talking to some guy who claimed to be a wizard. Yet, she thought of the shimmery storefront, and the strange orb.<br />
<br />
What do I have to lose by not asking? Kimberly thought to herself. It’s not like there’s anything else at this point. <br />
<br />
“I just need that intangible &#39;spark&#39;”, she blurted out suddenly, “something to make this trip go from good to great!&quot;<br />
<br />
The wizard looked at this girl in a new light. There’s something more to her than most who walk in from the world of the mundane. He thought to himself. Something special and sincere is in order here. <br />
<br />
Outwardly, he barked a laugh, &quot;Be careful how you talk about ogres, not all the stories of &#39;monsters&#39; you&#39;ve likely heard from your village elder are true. Some of my best drinking companions have been ogres. But there is wisdom in your words, I&#39;ve got a fair few scars that could have been avoided had I been more cautious when starting my arcane studies.&quot; He a scar on his lip thoughtfully before emphatically smacking his hand down on the carved wooden counter. <br />
<br />
&quot;I like your enthusiasm young Kimberly, and I believe my shop has just what you need!”<br />
<br />
“Uhh great”, said Kimberly, taken aback by his sudden enthusiasm. “No tricks or catches with these things right? I don’t want any of us to be stuck as slugs or anything.”<br />
<br />
&quot;No tricks! No catches!&quot; He said, holding his hands up in a pacifying gersture. &quot;Unless the store or I determines that someone who walks in is deserving of a little punishment or humility, I prefer to be fully...well, mostly honest with my customers.&quot; Paldinoss corrected himself with a wink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Occasionally I may keep a detail or three about an artifact secret, but nothing sinister. All to keep the experience exciting and refreshing. Not like some of those other magical stores.&quot;<br />
<br />
He snorted with derision, &quot;I swear you&#39;d think some mages get off on changing or terrifying you unaware youngsters. Why I know a guy who keeps magic ink bottles perched on the edge of his shelves, just hoping someone will knock them on down upon themselves.&quot; <br />
<br />
The warlock chuckled then paused, his cheerful demeanor faltering slightly, &quot;I will give you a warning however. While magic can be exceedingly fun, it can also be quite dangerous.&quot;<br />
<br />
He waved towards the crystal ball that had nearly ensnared her minutes ago. &quot;Some of these artifacts have a desire of their own they would like to fulfill, and like I said before you will have to be careful that neither you nor any of your companions lose themselves in the process.&quot;<br />
<br />
His charming grin returned to his face, &quot;Unless it&#39;s what they want of course. So, feel free to browse the shelves at your leisure to find what you need or...&quot; he raised an upturned hand, and the already dim shop seemed to darken further as a pale blue flame appeared in his palm.<br />
 <br />
Kimberly stared at its flickering light in awe, all doubts of magic disappearing. With a snap of his fingers and a puff of blue smoke, Paldinoss extinguished the flame and the light in the store returned to normal. <br />
<br />
Laughing at his own trick the wizard said, &quot;I can suggest a few choice items that you and your friends might enjoy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kimberly pondered this then said...</p>
