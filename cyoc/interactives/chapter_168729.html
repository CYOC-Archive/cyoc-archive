<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You quickly turn around and begin to write something down, you write,<br />
‘Skylar is a girl with ginger hair and massive ears’<br />
You look back up and watch Skylar’s ears begin to grow. Bigger and bigger, they get wider and wider. They look like they’re about to tilt over. Skylar places her hands on them, only able to grab a small portion of each one.<br />
She snarls at you. She turns around and begins writing on her paper. You try and beat her to it, you spin around and write on your paper,<br />
‘Skylar is a girl with ginger hair and massive ears and’<br />
Before you could finish writing down, you feel everything slowly getting bigger. You look around, it is getting bigger, and you’re getting smaller. Not shrinking, but your height decreasing. Your legs getting shorter, your arms too. You body getting stumpier. You become a dwarf. Your clothes are now way too big for you, you tried to hold them up for a moment but gave up, your pants fell down, as did your underwear. Your tiny penis looked semi-normal on your new body, but it was more than average tiny.<br />
You turn to look at Skylar, your shirt hanging off your shoulder, covering most of your body. You look up, there she is. It wasn’t the first time you’d seen her giant, but you weren’t used to being the one with the size difference. Her chubby body was giant in front of you. All these fat changes happening recently are making you rethink your attraction to certain bodies.<br />
“Awww, look at the little tiny boy!” Skylar mocks,<br />
You frown at her, you turn around and go to write on the paper. But you’re not tall enough for it, it’s just out of arms reach,<br />
“I wish the paper was in my hands,” you shout, the paper flies off the desk and right into your hands. It seemed like it would have given you a paper cut at the speed it travelled, but it didn’t. You push the paper into the wall and begin writing again,<br />
‘Skylar is a girl with ginger hair and massive ears and’ <br />
Then you think. Trying to think before Skylar can change you any further, then it hits you,<br />
“How about I bring you down to my level,” you say to yourself,<br />
‘Skylar is a little girl with ginger hair and massive ears’<br />
You spun around, Skylar is writing something down. But as she’s writing, she realises she’s shrinking too. She looks at herself. Like your her arms and legs getting shorter, but instead of just getting shorter, she’s getting younger. Her breasts shrink into her chest, becoming flat. Her hips and curves disappear, replaced with the androgynous body of a child. She didn’t look any older than 7 or 8. She wasn’t hot anymore, but she did have ginger hair and massive ears still.<br />
“Heyyy!!” She whined like the child she now was, “that’s not fair! I can’t reach the paper!” She said, jumping up to try and reach it,<br />
“I wish Skylar has the paper in her hands,” you say, being fair. The paper, as with yours, flies down and places itself perfectly in her hands. She drops to the floor and begins writing again. You don’t have a lot of time before you realise your changing again. You try and think of something to write before the changes start properly and only manage to scribble down one word of what you were going to write. <br />
You feel a pressure in your butt, you look down and see it gradually growing. You can only guess what Skylar’s childish mind had written down. But you see it continue to grow. You now had a pretty big butt, you wiggle yourself a little, watching it jiggle a lot more than before. You think to continue what you’d written for Skylar’s next change, but she appears to already be changing. You look at her, her belly appears to be getting bigger. But unlike a lot of changes recently, it wasn’t fat. Her belly was getting bigger and bigger, rounder and rounder. Like it was filling with something. You looked back at the paper, you realised you’d added a miscellaneous ‘bloated’ to the paper. Intending to write ‘bloated head,’ this seems to have worked out too. <br />
“Ow my tummy!” Skylar yelped. Holding her belly as it bloated too big for her to touch the front of. You take quick initiative and say,<br />
“I wish me and Skylar can’t be damaged or hurt or killed in any way, our body’s adapt to any new changes or situations,” you say. Wiping a sweat off your head, making sure Skylar didn’t burst. Which did benefit her in a lot of ways, but in the other ways, she was bloating uncontrollably.<br />
<br />
Skylar fell backwards, her stomach was getting too big for her small body to support. She fell back, her face was a mix of discomfort and sickness. She wasn’t having the best experience.<br />
“Okay. Well that was fun,” you say, a little sarcastically, “let’s wrap it up,”<br />
You grab the paper and cross off every piece of new information, other than the ‘Skylar is a little girl’ part. You watch Skylar’s belly shrinking back to normal, her hair going back to her regular blonde and her ears returning to usual shape and size. The only difference is her age. You cross off the ‘little’ on the paper, you watch Skylar progress back into her usual age. She shakes her head, a little dizzy,<br />
“Oh thank god, I’ve got my boobs back,” she says, grabbing them and squeezing them, letting out a tiny moan of pleasure, but more so relief. She looks at you, “pretend you didn’t see that,” she says, then smirks, “unless it turned you on, then please think about this a LOT!” she said gleefully. It seems that the changes may have put her in a good mood.<br />
“Okay. Can you fix me, please,” you ask.<br />
“Yeah su-” she stops herself, then realises something. She leans down and snatches the paper out of your hand and begins to write something down on it. Confused, you just shrug it off, hoping she’ll make you back to normal afterwards.<br />
You watch her, she begins changing again. This time not getting shorter or younger. But taller and older.<br />
Her body matures more, her face looks like a woman’s. Her usual C cup breasts turn to D cups as she goes into adulthood. Her hips are a little wider too, her whole body was taller, still shorter than you usually, but you were a dwarf right now so you couldn’t really say anything on that. She is checking herself out, she grabs her boobs again, she squeezes them,<br />
“Mmm,” she lets out. Licking her lips, “cool to know I get these when I’m an adult. Now let’s find out what happens to you as an adult!” She says. Her mature voice is oddly arousing.<br />
She writes what you can only assume changes ‘boy’ to ‘man’ on the paper. Skylar turns to face you, watching you. You feel yourself changing, but you’re not growing. Your getting a little thicker. Your muscles getting a little larger, your butt firmer, still big though.<br />
“Did you not change me back from a dwarf then?” You say sarcastically,<br />
“Oh yeah. My mistake,” Skylar says, “but... what it,” she says to herself,<br />
“Skylar...” you ask cautiously, “don’t get any fun ideas, just make me normal please,”<br />
“Sure, sure,” she says half heartedly. You were prepared to be changed completely differently.<br />
<br />
You hope that whatever she does, it makes you back to normal size. But instead, you get an itch on your face. It only gets worse. You try and scratch it. But as your scratching it, it gets hairier. You develop and pretty decent beard. You look over the rest of your bare yet small body. Hair grows all over it. Your normally fairly unhairy legs develop a huge amount of hair. Your arms too. The only hair that stays the same is the hair on your head. You eyebrows get a little thicker. You feel your pubic hair grow mountains more. You can it without even bending. Your feet get hairier too. The hair on your chest gets incredibly hairy, it extends to your back partially. You feel hair growing in and around your butt.<br />
You look at Skylar, she’s looking at you with delight,<br />
“Please. Fix me.” You say with desperation your voice,<br />
“Okay, okay,” she says, “but for the record. You look really hot as a hairy man, even if you are tiny.”<br />
She goes over and crosses something on the paper out. You give a sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
You feel yourself changing, your dick especially. You are happy she fixed that as well as everything else. Waiting for yourself to grow again. Nothing,<br />
“Huh?” You say, the only thing that seemed to be changing with your cock. You look down. Your penis was back to normal size and girth, which was pretty large on your current size. You watch it growing longer and longer. It hits the floor and continued growing. It stopped finally. It was touching the floor, like a snake. It looked to be around 9 or 10 inches. It’s girth was just a little bigger than usual, but it was mostly in the length,<br />
“Okay, Skylar. What the fuck,” you say. Grabbing your cock, lifting it up and dropping it. It flopping on the ground with a thud. Skylar seemed to be quite enjoying it, “Skylar god dammit!!” You yell at her. She snaps out of her trance.<br />
“Huh! Oh, right, sorry. I just wanted to see what it would look like,”<br />
“Skylar I swear to god I will turn you into a brainless bimbo for a week,”<br />
“Hey! That’s... that’s not a bad a idea actually,”<br />
You give her a stern look,<br />
“Okay, jeez,” she rolls her eyes, “I was just kidding,” she swipes the paper up and hand it to you, “you do it. Then you can’t go wrong,”<br />
You snatch the paper out of her hand and look at it.<br />
‘John is a man with an incredibly long penis and a dwarf and has a bubble butt, he is hairy in all places especially in the groin”<br />
You grip the pen and change it.</p>
