<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I didn't look forward to the store closing since listening to the girls talk and seeing <br />
them browse through the clothes relieved the boredom that I'm sure I would feel once <br />
the store closed. Alas the time came for the store to close and I was left with my <br />
thoughts. Maybe I'd be so bored that I would block out large chunks of time. After a <br />
few minutes the mannequin across from me moved. She was a young girl wearing a <br />
red jumper but otherwise I thought she was dressed like me. She looked at me and <br />
said, &quot;Don't worry. Once Mommy gets here you'll move too.&quot; She slid down off the <br />
alphabet block she was sitting on and a few more mannequins came over. There were <br />
about eleven in all and none of them were adult mannequins.<br />
<br />
The mannequins seemed to be waiting for something and I didn't have long to wait to <br />
see what it was. The girl who had winked at me came through them and smiled at me <br />
again. I felt like I should know her but I couldn't think of how I should. She touched my <br />
cheek and said, &quot;Become animate my daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
I didn't think that would work but then my hand twitched and I blinked. I was so <br />
startled that I gasped and leaned back. &quot;I'm alive again,&quot; I said in wonder.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; the girl said shaking her head, &quot;you're only animate which is different from being <br />
alive. You're still a mannequin and if I wanted to I could disassemble you.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked down at my arm and saw that there was still a seam there and I knew that the <br />
girl was telling me the truth. I looked up at the girl and asked, &quot;How were you able to <br />
do this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'm a goddess now,&quot; the girl said smiling. &quot;I have to apologize for not believing <br />
you when you told us that the Greek gods were real.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; I asked confused.<br />
<br />
The girl smiled and said, &quot;I'm your mother Rick.&quot; This left me speechless so the girl <br />
continued, &quot;I see I need to explain a few things. I think you should sit down for this. <br />
Come on over to this alphabet block and sit. Remember to lift your right foot up so the <br />
rod isn't inside you anymore.&quot; Once I had sat down the little girl who had been sitting <br />
here crawled up into my lap and I naturally put my arms around her which comforted <br />
me. The girl who claimed to be my mother sighed and said, &quot;It started about three <br />
months ago. We noticed something was wrong so we went into your room. Well you <br />
obviously weren't there and we saw the website burned into your computer screen. <br />
We called the police and filed a missing persons report. A few hours later a rainbow <br />
appeared in the front room and we were surprised to see an image of a man in the <br />
rainbow and even more surprised when he spoke to us. He told us what had <br />
happened and that you were now a girl. He said he would arrange for us to talk to you <br />
so we could make a decision about whether or not to join you here. He called the next <br />
day and apologized but he had to send you to look for others who had been drawn <br />
into this world. He kept calling to update us and during the last update there was a <br />
bright light. The next thing I knew I was laying in this store as you see me now. I got to <br />
my feet but stumbled and fell into Chrissy who you're holding now. Well anyway when <br />
I touched her she started moving. I became frightened and ran but I touched other <br />
mannequins and they started to move also except they called me Mom. That's when <br />
Zeus and Poseidon popped in. Well since I had seen and talked to Poseidon before I <br />
wasn't so frightened. They explained that I was now something like a goddess and that <br />
I had the power to animate mannequins. I asked them where everyone else was but <br />
they couldn't give me an answer. They couldn't tell me where you were even. They <br />
said that there was something blocking them like you were dead. Poseidon was <br />
adamant that you were alive since your pearl and bracelet hadn't returned to him unlike <br />
your sisters' items. Then two days later your items did return to Poseidon. He's been <br />
depressed ever since.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok I believe that you're my mom but I'm not dead,&quot; I said shaking my head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hate to say this but you are,&quot; my mom said. &quot;Your body was transformed into a <br />
mannequin which isn't alive. The only reason you're able to move now is because of <br />
my magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I've been aware since I was transformed into a mannequin,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's because your soul was trapped within your body,&quot; my mom said. &quot;The same <br />
thing happened with Chrissy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we be changed back?&quot; I asked. I didn't relish the thought of spending the rest of <br />
my life as a mannequin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at this time,&quot; my mom said shaking her head sadly. &quot;We had tried with Chrissy <br />
but no one was able to transform her in any way. So I'm afraid that you and Chrissy <br />
are mannequins for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked down at Chrissy and thought that she needed the comfort as much as I did. <br />
Chrissy looked up at me and said, &quot;The dead are not dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
There was a very loud crack and I bolted up into a sitting position my breath fast and <br />
shallow with my heart beating a mile a minute. I looked around and saw that I was in <br />
the home again and all the girls had been startled awake. The light in the room was <br />
dim and after a few seconds I heard the unmistakable sound of rain falling outside. I <br />
got up and looked out the window seeing that the rain was coming down hard. I <br />
started thinking back on what I had experienced. Was it just a dream or had it been <br />
real? My head was saying that it was just a dream but my heart was saying that it was <br />
real. I looked back at the girls getting out of bed and thought about the words Chrissy <br />
had spoken. If it was a dream they would make sense. What if it wasn't a dream <br />
though? Everyone here should be dead but they're not. The only thing I could think of <br />
was that maybe I had come back in time if it wasn't a dream. I looked back out the <br />
window and watched the rain stop. Given what had happened to me so far it wasn't an <br />
impossibility that I could have jumped through time. I then thought about my other <br />
dreams and wondered if they had been episodes of time jumping and if anyone else <br />
was experiencing them.<br />
<br />
It was after lunch when a package came for Gabriella. We found out that the girls <br />
always got a present for their birthday and today was Gabriella's fifteenth birthday. No <br />
one knew who sent them but whoever did send them was a good Samaritan and the <br />
girls made sure to thank him or her in the paper. We went up to the bedroom so <br />
Gabriella could open her present. We were just as excited as Gabriella as she opened <br />
her present. What was inside was a wooden box and I started to get the feeling that I <br />
should know it. Gabriella opened the lid and read aloud, &quot;These vials contain potions <br />
to transform you into any animal or change your sex and age. Each vial has a picture <br />
of an animal, human, or the symbols for male and female on it with the age vials <br />
having the age printed on them. Each vial must be fully drunk for the full effects. There <br />
is a reversal vial that will reverse any and all transformations the subject has <br />
undergone. When you have drank the vial just replace it in the space it came from and <br />
it will automatically refill. Both humans and animals can be transformed with these <br />
vials. Enjoy.&quot; She looked up with a smile and said, &quot;Yah right. Like I really believe <br />
these will transform me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Those really will transform you Gabriella trust me on this,&quot; I said hoping that she <br />
wouldn't drink any.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on Lisa,&quot; Gabriella said rolling her eyes. &quot;You can't possibly believe that I'll <br />
be transformed and I'll prove it.&quot; She grabbed a random vile and drank it. The vial <br />
wasn't very big and it only a couple gulps to drain it. She replaced the vial and said, &quot;I <br />
didn't transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh Gabriella the vile did refill,&quot; Denise said sounding scared.<br />
<br />
Gabriella looked at the box and we all watched as she started to change.</p>
