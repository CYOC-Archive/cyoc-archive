<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The cold water splashed against Cam’s chest as he struggled through the lake, Ryder still clinging to his back like a stubborn little monkey. The kid had his arms locked tight around Cam’s neck, legs wrapped around his waist, making it nearly impossible for Cam to move without dragging Ryder along for the ride.<br />
<br />
“You’re going down, Dad!” Ryder crowed triumphantly, laughing as he held on tighter. His grip was surprisingly strong for a kid his size, and every time Cam tried to shake him off, Ryder just squeezed harder. “I’m not letting go!”<br />
<br />
Cam grunted, feeling the weight of Ryder pressing against him, trying to keep the fun going. “Oh yeah? You think you’ve got me beat, huh?” he growled, playing along as he struggled through the water. “We’ll see about that!”<br />
<br />
But as they roughhoused in the water, the playful banter took on a different tone for Cam. The constant pressure of Ryder’s body against him was starting to have an effect—an effect he wasn’t prepared for. The contact between them was closer than Cam was used to, and before he realized what was happening, he could feel the weight of Ryder’s soft cock pressed firmly against his lower back.<br />
<br />
At first, it was just there, like an afterthought. Cam had almost gotten used to the sensation of Ryder’s size earlier, the way his son’s cock seemed to take up more space than it should. But now, with Ryder practically glued to his back, it was impossible to ignore. Ryder’s soft cock—thick and heavy—was pressing right against the base of Cam’s spine, and the more they moved, the more Cam could feel it shifting.<br />
<br />
Cam tried to push the thought away, focusing on the fun, on the laughter, but it was no use. Every time Ryder shifted or bounced, Cam could feel that fat piece of meat pressing into him, thick and solid, brushing against his skin beneath the water. And worse—he could feel it getting harder.<br />
<br />
Shit... is Ryder chubbing up? The thought hit Cam out of nowhere, sending a jolt through him. He didn’t want to believe it, but there was no denying what he was feeling. The playful wrestling, the closeness, it was starting to affect Ryder, too. His soft cock, already impressive in size, was thickening, hardening slightly against Cam’s back. And with each movement, it seemed to press more firmly into him.<br />
<br />
Cam’s breath caught in his throat as he struggled to keep playing along. “Alright, kid... you’re wearing me out,” he said, trying to sound casual as he felt Ryder’s cock thicken against his back. “You’re gonna have to let go soon.”<br />
<br />
But Ryder wasn’t letting go. If anything, he was holding on tighter. His legs squeezed around Cam’s waist, and that’s when Cam felt something else—Ryder’s nuts, bouncing against the top of his ass with every movement. Even with the cold water keeping them tight, they were still huge. Every time Ryder shifted, Cam could feel the weight of those heavy balls knocking against his lower back, high and tight but still big enough to make their presence known.<br />
<br />
Cam gritted his teeth, trying to shake off the sensation, but it was impossible to ignore. Those things are huge, he thought, feeling the unmistakable thud of Ryder’s nuts as they slapped against him. He is so fucking big.<br />
<br />
Ryder, still oblivious to what was happening, just laughed harder. “You’re not getting away!” he shouted, bouncing up and down on Cam’s back, his grip like iron.<br />
<br />
Cam groaned, feeling the pressure building in more ways than one. Ryder’s cock was getting harder, pressing against his spine, and Cam’s own body was starting to respond. He could feel it—the slow, steady rise of his own cock as it swelled beneath the water, reacting to the roughhousing and the constant physical contact. No, no, no... not now, Cam thought, his pulse quickening as he felt himself getting hard.<br />
<br />
The weight of Ryder’s body against his back, the sensation of his son’s cock hardening and his nuts thumping against him—it was too much. Cam’s cock was now fully hard, straining beneath the water, and there was no way to stop it. I’ve got to get out of here, he thought, his heart racing. He couldn’t let Ryder notice.<br />
<br />
“Alright, truce!” Cam said suddenly, his voice a little too loud, a little too strained. “We’re heading back to shore.”<br />
<br />
Ryder, still laughing, just tightened his grip again. “No way! I’m not done with you yet!”<br />
<br />
Cam forced a laugh, his mind racing as he trudged toward the shallows. “You’ve already got me beat, kid. Let’s call it a day.”<br />
<br />
Ryder giggled, bouncing on Cam’s back, completely unaware of what was happening. “Nope! I’m the leech! I’m not letting go until you give up!”<br />
<br />
Cam gritted his teeth, feeling Ryder’s half-hard cock press against him again, the thick shaft growing more prominent with each movement. He had to get out of the water before things got even worse. Come on, almost there, he thought, his steps slow and deliberate as he trudged toward the shore, Ryder still clinging to him like his life depended on it.<br />
<br />
Finally, they reached the shallows, the water now just above Cam’s knees. His cock was fully hard, straining beneath him, and he knew he had to get out of the water fast. Ryder, still latched onto his back, laughed and yanked on Cam’s shoulders, trying to pull him down again.<br />
<br />
“Come on, Dad! You’re not giving up yet, are you?”<br />
<br />
Cam grunted, forcing a smile. “Yeah, I’m done for,” he muttered, trying to keep his voice light. He couldn’t let Ryder see. He had to get out of the water, but with Ryder still clinging to his back, it wasn’t going to be easy.<br />
<br />
Cam had barely managed to collapse onto the sand, his body pressed firmly against the cool shore, when he felt Ryder’s grip loosen. He let out a relieved breath, thinking his son was finally going to let go, but Ryder didn’t roll off like he usually did. Instead, Ryder just sat there on top of him, straddling Cam’s lower back with his legs draped over either side, the weight of him pressing down without the water to help.<br />
<br />
For a moment, Cam froze. Without the buoyancy of the lake, Ryder’s body felt heavy. The difference was immediate. The playful, weightless wrestling they’d been doing in the water was one thing, but now, out here on the shore, the full reality of Ryder’s size hit Cam like a truck. <br />
<br />
Cam’s eyes widened as he felt it. Ryder’s cock, no longer floating in the water, now rested fully against his back, and the sheer weight of it was shocking. It felt like a thick, meaty rope lying across him, covering a good portion of his back, heavier than anything Cam had imagined. Ryder’s legs were on either side of him, and Cam could feel those enormous nuts hanging down, brushing against the top of his ass like two heavy, overfilled sacks. Damn...<br />
<br />
It wasn’t just the size—it was the weight. Without the water, Cam could feel just how massive Ryder’s cock and balls really were. It felt like Ryder’s dick was covering half of Cam’s back, and those bull nuts… The sensation was impossible to ignore.<br />
<br />
And Ryder? Ryder was completely oblivious. He sat there, giggling, catching his breath, happy that he’d finally managed to exhaust his dad. His laughter echoed across the beach, carefree and innocent, as if nothing unusual was happening.<br />
<br />
“I told you I’d win!” Ryder said between laughs, his arms now free but his body still perched on top of Cam’s back. He gave a playful bounce, oblivious to the way his weight shifted on Cam, pressing his cock and balls down even harder against him. “You need to get stronger!”<br />
Cam could only grunt in response, his face still pressed into the sand as he tried to process what was happening. The sheer heaviness of it all was almost too much.  Ryder just sat there, laughing, enjoying his victory, completely unaware of the weight pressing down on his dad.<br />
<br />
Ryder finally pushed himself up, bouncing off Cam’s back with a final triumphant laugh. “Better luck next time dad!” he shouted, jumping to his feet and running off toward the water again, leaving Cam lying there in the sand, stunned by the weight of what he’d just felt.<br />
<br />
Cam rolled onto his side, still keeping his lower half pressed against the sand, grateful that Ryder hadn’t noticed anything out of the ordinary. He had to regain his composure, but the lingering feeling of Ryder’s weight was still fresh in his mind.</p>
