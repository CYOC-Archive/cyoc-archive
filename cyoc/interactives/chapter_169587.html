<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ginger was doing a nude photo shoot for some up and coming photographer. She couldn&#39;t deny the model, called herself Ginger, model&#39;s beauty or her body. She had not an ounce of fat on her frame, her ass showed shape without being too big or flat and her breasts were.<br />
<br />
Kate took several images of her, one with her covering her thatch of red pubic hair with her hands but showing her breasts. Her breasts were perfectly symmetrical with pointed, up turned nipples. She next photo was of her dangling over a chair  her fiery mane of hair falling down loose, her left elbow covering her breasts and as it was a side on shot her form could be seen. It was safe enough to post online, these days even safe for work in some companies. <br />
<br />
The third shot was her leaning against a wall, her hairs raised above her head and her right breast exposed. It would be a good shot for nude calendar at some garage where some overweight and balding mechanic were the only servicing he was getting was on cars. But the damned dog collar had to be photo shopped out of the picture. <br />
<br />
Kate approached Ginger after the shot. She told her that she had a great body and responded expertly to the camera. Kate asked what kind of work Ginger did, she told her that she did modelling. She also did some nude work for people who were art students but her main income was as stripper. Kate asked if she had considered going professional. <br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you would be great, you are one of a kind Ginger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ginger&#39;s face was sad, as if she were attending a funeral. <br />
<br />
&quot;What is with the dog collar?&quot; Kate burst out.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is a sign of my imprisonment, that my freedom has limits placed on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Those limits are only in your mind, what are the limits?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My birth was never registered, I have no social security number and no birth certificate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happens when your looks start to fade? What is the retirement plan then?&quot; Kate demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think that I will live that long so it isn&#39;t a problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate was infuriated and infatuated with Ginger, she grabbed the girl by the throat and released the dog collar.<br />
<br />
&quot;You BITCH!&quot; Ginger screamed as the changes started. <br />
<br />
The first thing that gave her a clue that something was wrong was that she suddenly became horny. Extremely horny, in ways she never got. Her crotch tingled and began to juice and her heart rate accelerated. Her breathing deepened and she felt tingles of undeniable arousal all over her body. She bit her lip, what was wrong with her, she never got this turned on, and she wasn&#39;t some kind of slut? How could she suddenly be getting this aroused? She was glad no one was around to see her. As she felt goose bumps form on her skin, she looked at her hand and then was in for another surprise.<br />
<br />
There was a dark patch of reddish fur on the top of her hand, and it seemed to be spreading. She yelped in surprise and stopped dead where she was, looking in shock as the fur spread. Suddenly she felt it growing her chest and on her stomach, tickling her skin as it did. She pulled out her shirt to look and see better, but the seams on her shirt ripped and the garment came to pieces as she pulled it away, leaving her in nothing but her bra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god! What&#39;s happening to me?&quot; She cried.<br />
<br />
Her head swam and she staggered forward, the fur was spreading out all over her body. She felt strange, and realized she was shrinking as well, getting slightly smaller. Something pushed in back of her and to her horror she realized it was a tail, growing out of her back side. As the tail pushed out, growing long and bushy, it tore away her disintegrating shorts in the process.<br />
<br />
Her feet spread out, and grew into wide paws, ripping her shoes and socks apart. Her feet elongated, making them into the double back lower legs of an animal. She was now clad only in her expensive pink underwear as her body continued to change. But there was no pain; in fact, it felt really good, every change giving her electric tingles of pleasure all over her body. And she was still so horny, horny like she&#39;d never been. She had to resist the urge to put her now fur covered hand between her legs.<br />
<br />
Her ears began to expand, growing into points, and rising up above her hair, and then moved up and up, filling with fur until they were a long pair of pointed canine ears. The tail grew even longer, sprouting thick brown fur all over it. She looked around, trying to find someone who could help her but, there was no one. She started running in the direction where she knew there was a phone booth. She had to call 911, but it was hard to run on these feet.<br />
<br />
Her chest pulsed and expanded, and she let out a loud yell as two extra sets of breasts grew out of her chest just under her original pair. The pressure of the extra boobs caused the last few stitches of her bra to pop, and the garment fell into several pieces and dropped to the ground, leaving Ginger completely topless. Her entire frame was covered in short reddish brown fur, which absurdly seemed to match her long wavy hair.<br />
<br />
She felt her canine teeth grow and expand, like those of a vampire in her mouth.<br />
<br />
And she was still shrinking, her body getting just a little bit smaller little by little. She couldn&#39;t be more the four foot five at this point. With her body so much smaller, her panties dropped down, tangling in her legs. She tripped over them, landing on the ground on her hands and knees. The last few seams in her panties disintegrated and her fumbling legs ripped them into shreds, leaving Ginger naked on all fours in the middle of the park. Her ears grew even longer, moving up to the top of her head, and her tail grew out, reaching its maximum length.<br />
<br />
She tried to scream once more, but it turned into a gurgling grunt as her face elongated, growing outward into the muzzle of a dog. She tried to scream for help, but what came out was growling yelp. Finally, the changes seemed to be finished. She was now some kind furry human/dog hybrid. The curse hadn&#39;t returned her to her original form but had left her between the supermodel she could be and the pet dog she was.</p>
