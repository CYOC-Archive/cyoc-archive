<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Damon looked at the pull-up package again.<br />
The desire for the child became too strong.<br />
<br />
The crowd, Madame Illusia and his babysitter saw him strip off his shoes, pants and cartoon underpants and then take a pull-ups from the package.<br />
<br />
The witch snapped her fingers as the laughter increased in the tent and all the sounds were taken out of Damon&#39;s ears, who proceeded to put on the pull-ups.<br />
At the same time the pull-ups adhered to her waist, his cotton underpants with cartoon characters transformed, becoming a potty chair.<br />
Damon hadn&#39;t noticed.<br />
<br />
The crowd saw that Damon take his pants to get dressed again, but stopped and looked around.<br />
&quot;Where are the briefs?&quot; The child said.<br />
<br />
They saw him search for a few more seconds, and then he gave up, putting on his pants and his shoes again.<br />
While she was dressing the witch sent Monica into the toilette on stage.<br />
<br />
Monica was impatient to do what Madame Illusia had instructed him to do, to humiliate little Damon.<br />
&quot;Damon, did you pee?&quot;<br />
Damon hadn&#39;t heard her enter the toilette and jumped in fright.<br />
<br />
Monica smiled and said. “Sorry Damon, I didn&#39;t mean to scare you. So tell me, did you pee? Madame Illusia is waiting for us &quot;<br />
&quot;I ...&quot; Damon was ashamed of being caught with a pull-up in his pants in front of his girlfriend and couldn&#39;t tell him he hadn&#39;t peed yet because he had wasted time putting them on. He was also ashamed because Monica haved asked him whether or not he had peed, as if he were just a toddler.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you pee or not?&quot;<br />
&quot;I ... Yes, I&#39;ve already peed ....&quot;<br />
<br />
At that point, Damon felt a tingle in his small penis and with the tingling he began to feel the heat on the skin at the groin. Embarrassed, he realized he had started peeing against his will.<br />
He put his hands on the crotch of his pants, on his penis, in the childish hope that he could keep with his hands from peeing in his pants. Instead helplessy he feel his pull-ups becamed quickly from wet to completely soaked under his pants. Monica watched in amusement her ex-boyfriend becomed 6y/o child tried to stop pissing in his pull-ups.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Damon, you&#39;ve already peed ... But in the potty ... or in your pants?&quot;<br />
Damon finally felt he had stopped peeing in his pull-ups, but did not respond to Monica, deeply humiliated that he pissed in his pants in front of his girlfriend / babysitter.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a suspect ... no pee into potty chair ...&quot; Monica said looking into the potty &quot;And I didn&#39;t hear the toilet flush ... Damon, come here ...&quot;<br />
Damon approached Monica and in that moment, the toilet that Madame Illusia had created in his mind, dissolved and the child discovered that he was on stage in front of the everyone, and mostly that he was in front of everyone with a soaked pull-up under his pants, while the crowd laughed at him.<br />
<br />
Damon clung to Monica in fear and shame and holding his face against his girlfriend&#39;s legs he began to cry like the little child he had become.<br />
&quot;Monica, you&#39;re his babysitter&quot; Madame Illusia said &quot;I think you need to change his wet pull-ups&quot;<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t even think about it. I&#39;ve never changed a diaper at babies and I don&#39;t want to start with him, who was my boyfriend &quot;<br />
Damon at those words walked away from Monica, in tears, as if stunned by the lack of love for him on the part of that girl who until a few minutes was his girlfriend.<br />
<br />
“It is not pleasant for a child of his age piss his pants in front of all these people. He is scared and embarrassed. You&#39;re his babysitter and you need to take care of him tonight. Now go and change his pull-up wet&quot;<br />
“He wanted to put on the pull-up. How he has put on the first pull-up he can also change it himself. &quot;<br />
<br />
“This is your choice Monica. Stay here on stage while I try to solve Damon&#39;s problem. &quot;<br />
At those words, Monica&#39;s contemptuous smile froze.<br />
&quot;What did the witch mean?&quot; Monica thought. She tried to move but felt she was imprisoned on stage.<br />
<br />
Madame Illusia turned to the crowd and asked “Any of you, I would prefer a couple, would like to become the mum and the dad of little Damon? he&#39;s a lovely child, and he needs a lot of love. &quot;<br />
From the back of the tent a young couple looked at each other, and together they stood up. &quot;We. We are ready to become Damon&#39;s parents &quot;<br />
The witch looked at them and a smile appeared on her face.<br />
“Don&#39;t be shy. Stephan, take Damon&#39;s future parents to the stage here. &quot;<br />
<br />
The couple accompanied by Stephan joined Madame Illusia and Damon on stage. In the meantime the child had stopped crying.<br />
The youngh woman walked over to Damon and after crouching beside him, the child instinctively stretched his arms towards his neck and let himself be picked up.<br />
“Matt! Watch it. It&#39;s a love&quot;<br />
<br />
“Well guys. How come, you want to be Damon&#39;s parents? &quot;<br />
The boy replied &quot;Well ... We cannot have our own children ... But the procedures for adoption are .... difficult ... If you can make little Damon our son, we would be delighted ... &quot;<br />
“Sure dear, sure. But if you want I can also solve your problem and you can further enlarge your family, giving little brothers or sisters  for play togheter with little Damon ... &quot;The witch smiled&quot; Just ask &quot;<br />
<br />
The couple looked at each other for a moment and the girl let Damon out.<br />
“We can&#39;t have children, because I…” the young woman said “I, I&#39;m a female transsexual. I have already had The Operation, but in any case, I will never be able to become a mother. &quot;<br />
“Dear girl,” said the witch, “if you asked me, I could turn your fake vagina into a real and much fertile female reproductive system. You would be a true biological female &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Matt ... What do you say?&quot;<br />
“It&#39;s your dream Alice. You always wanted it. It&#39;s not a problem for me. I loved you, I love you and I will love you anyway. &quot;<br />
“Yes, Madame Illusia. Yes. I want to become a real woman &quot;<br />
<br />
The witch snapped her fingers and Alice felt stuck.<br />
Then she began to feel pressure in her pelvis.<br />
&quot;I feel weird,&quot; the youngh woman said<br />
&quot;First of all, your bone structure will have to change a bit ...&quot;<br />
At that, her pelvic brim and hip bones expanded. Alice staggered as her bones moved, becoming a true female pelvis, designed by nature for giving birth.<br />
<br />
Then Alice, while she was getting used to walking in a different way, felt a tingling rise from between her legs.<br />
What was left of her penis after the operation moved slightly and became a real clitoris, and below her fake vagina became a real female vagina. What remained of her male reproductive system was swept away, while the uterus and ovaries formed in her pelvic cavity.<br />
When the tingling stopped, Alice looked at Matt and then at the witch.<br />
&quot;it&#39;s over ? Am I a real woman now? &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes darling. And you will have periods, menopause, you also can have pregnancies… All the complete female package ”said Madame Illusia with a smile.<br />
The youngh woman at those words burst into tears of happiness and Matt hugged her.<br />
“Guys I don&#39;t want to bother you, but I have to remind you that Damon, your son, needs a change his wet pull-up. And this is his diaper bag.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks. I&#39;m going to change him right away” Damon&#39;s mom said.<br />
“For the night it is better to put him a classic diaper with tabs instead of pull-ups, and then, you will find a few changes when you get home, and also in your car with a child car seat for Damon. &quot;<br />
Madame Illusia said.<br />
The new family left the stage, looking for a toilet with a changing table, so they could changes Damon into a dry diaper, and go home.</p>
