<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Um, you guys go on ahead. I&#39;ll wait here.&quot; John waited for his son Derick, his daughter Julie, his wife Sharon, basically the whole family to leave on the tour as he pretended to read some bulletins on the visitor board when he&#39;s actually glancing over to a huge muscular beast that&#39;s also wearing wrestling gear. He averted his gaze for he shortly after saw His wife and children followed the girl identified as a tour guide that he watched them leave, then his eyes went wide to what he saw next.<br />
<br />
Once they have left, he scanned the huge reception area and spotted a muscular beast that&#39;s wearing wrestling gear that looks more like an anthro elephant getting ready to carry a huge number of suitcases for some other guests. If that&#39;s not crazy enough... These was another anthro wrestling beast pushing a heavily-laden cart as this one looked more like a grizzly bear. Another one was a jungle grey fox, waiting over by the elevator. John was thinking on the thought of seeing These beast-men that&#39;s wearing wrestling gear must be very popular for the indoor work jobs, just a theme, or there must be an event match as it&#39;s scheduled later on tonight. Whatever was going on, John&#39;s gazed the bellhop fox by the elevator who was looking straight at him that he embarrassingly looked away and resumed to pretend on looking around the announcement. When he glanced back though that the fox was still staring at him to even begin to wave at him to come over, but John was to focus on the beast-men&#39;s bulging crotch as his face was blushing red about it.<br />
<br />
Thinking that he could just ignore the summons, he again averted his gaze from this wrestling anthro fox&#39;s crotch as he started to notice not only male beast-men wearing wrestling gears for there were also females too. Looking around that he started to wonder if he could pick out just one of these wrestling anthro beast girls to bang with from a cute rabbit to a tall giraffe, take her to the bedroom and wrestle with her to see who gets top. Wait a minute... What was he thinking? He&#39;s married to his wife Sharon, not to mention that he has kids to think about.<br />
<br />
Backing up a few steps by this sudden curiosity to let the change go as he was still red-cheeked from being caught up in the moment, he quickly made his way across the lobby. Before he did however, he backed up to someone that his eyes went wide with shock as a strong oder was actually coming off from who was behind you while he felt a powerful presence. Spinning himself around, he found that he was staring at a muscular chest of a male beast-men wearing wrestling gear as he seemed stronger than what he wished to be. He also came to stand just a couple of feet away as he was looking down at him with curiosity that two things began to immediately became obvious. First off, this was not your out of the mill costume as this was actually real that he was glad for his family not finding this place out. Impossible as this may seemed, these anthro wrestles were still in the jungle for they were each very much real and very much alive that the second thing was they were each showing signs of an erection of wanting to making of by either masterbation or by sex. He didn&#39;t really notice before for he had assumed it was just someone in a costume and not really cared about it, wished he did though that being up close to one of these things as his leotard uniform was very obvious and noticeable to see a nice fant sheath with a massive ballsack underneath.<br />
<br />
&quot;He likes you.&quot; Someone in a female voice said that made John nearly jump out of his skin from the side, coming from out of nowhere to scare him from his shadow. It was another receptionist as she smiled at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead, you can touch him. He won&#39;t mind. You can do anything you want with him. Heck, you can even do whatever you want. Whatever happens here does not have to last longer than what your stay here actually is. Trust me, no one will care for whatever you do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Flushing from the embarrassment while being confused about these mix feelings, John started to stutter a protest. &quot;Now Look lady, I&#39;m not going to...&quot; Before he knew what to say to her next, she was already gone as he swiftly turned back towards the wrestling anthro. Slowly, he reached out to gently place a hand upon his meaty chest as the anthro before him felt tickelish that the two briefly paused for a bit and retracted from one another before continuing to what John was doing to him. Fascinated by his package that was underneath his leotard uniform, he cup up most of what he could and felt a heavy testicle as it was like a warm orange while feeling it pulsing slightly within his palm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh, wow.&quot; They both tensed up, but not before the anthro reached out to grab John&#39;s clothes as it granted a little as John shortly soon felt a warm breeze whip around him. Almost again, below against his wrestling skin that he quickly pulled out the same matching outfit he&#39;s wearing as his fussed with John to put on. Backing away for he now yelpd and jumped back - he was now as suited up for a wrestling match as the anthro wrestling beast-men that&#39;s wearing wrestling gears, ready for a fight!<br />
<br />
Embarrassed as he stripped off John&#39;s clothes to put on the same wrestling gear suit on as his that he quickly looked around, but no one else seems to have notice a thing to what just occurred. Neither staff, nor guests. There were a few who glanced here and there at him, but they seem to regard the two male wrestlers of two different species perfectly normal that John started back up at the wrestling anthro with an open-mouthed. Now feeling more excited than sacred and upset, he was shortly after punched by this strong beast as John was quickly pinned down that they even made a small yet fast kiss towards one another. &quot;What else, can you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gently getting back up as he helped John up to his feet also, the anthro waved at somebody John didn&#39;t notice at first. However, the wrestler shortly nodded in apparent satisfaction that he then started to walk away as John was staring for a moment for he shortly after started to run after the beast. He wasn&#39;t sure why, but he needed to stay close that the anthro grey fox from before pressed the call button as he somehow knew they would come. The sliding doors for the elevator sliding open just as John and the anthro wrestler that he was with arrived and stepped inside. John didn&#39;t hesitated for a minute while being in with him that John kept his eyes averted  from his, but this proved to be difficult as it turned out to be easier said than expected. The walls of the elevator car were mirrors that John could examine his massive body indirectly, just as much as he could examine John&#39;s body out.<br />
<br />
As the doors slid closed that the beast&#39;s odor came back just as strong, only stronger. it was more of an acrid stink of swat, urine, and mostly musk that it slightly burned John&#39;s nostrils as it just gotten his blood pounding for some odd reason. They mostly stood there in silence for about a minute before the wrestler reached over to past John and pressed the bottom button on the elevator panel, ones that can&#39;t be seen by the human eyes. He stopped to lightly tousle John&#39;s hair as he was a bit startled by this, for a moment. Yet he was somewhat... Pleased at the contact that John looked up to the wrestling anthro beast-men who&#39;s wearing wrestling gear like him now with a hesitated smile. The anthro was looking down at John with what looked like a friendly expression as his hand slid over to John&#39;s opposite shoulder and effortlessly pulled him close that John felt like he wanted to follow up with this guy, like a well-trained dog. Feeling confused by his own behavior as he was unable to stop himself that this guy was somehow... Important to him! He was...<br />
<br />
John quickly snapped out of it and shook his head, trying to clear these strange thoughts out. What was he thinking! he wasn&#39;t totally gay, not even to this anthro wrestling beast-men that&#39;s wearing wrestling gear as he looked more like a...<br />
<br />
(This is where you decide to what the human anthro wrestling beast-men that&#39;s wearing wrestling gear is. It could be a strong muscler lion, a venomous cobra, or even... A penguin? Anyways, feel free to list your own storyline ups as a few are down below. Again thank you and happy reading.)</p>
