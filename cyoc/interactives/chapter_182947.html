<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With her love making session over and goal achieved, Kendra stood up and left a breathless Kevin in the shower stall so that she could dry herself off and start to revert to normal. Her body had already begun to settle itself down as she grabbed a nearby towel and set to work, however Kendra felt a little agitated when after a good 10 minutes of drying she still looked exactly the same.<br />
&#39;This is taking way longer than normal.&#39; she thought to herself.<br />
As she moved her way down her leg for the 3rd or 4th time she spotted her webbed foot, had it always been that big? Before she could contemplate further she heard Kevin finally gather the strength to move and decided she&#39;d prefer to move somewhere a little more private. Grabbing her things as quickly as she could Kendra made for the exit, her webbed feet slapping almost comically against the tiled floor. Looking into the hall she could see that it was clear to quickly slip away and into the girls locker room, at least there she could get dressed, then sneak out of school and figure out why she hadn&#39;t changed back yet.<br />
<br />
Kevin meanwhile was still exhausted but was ecstatic that not only had her just had spontaneous sex with a girl but it was with he perfect fantasy, a frog girl. Stepping out into the changing room he had hoped to speak to her and find out not only her name but if they could maybe do this thing again but regrettably all he was faced with was a pile of his own clothes and the door gently closing after she&#39;d walked out. Disappointedly Kevin got dressed, albeit clumsily as his legs still felt like jelly from the ordeal but before long he was ready to go back to class, wondering how or even if he could tell anybody about what had just happened.<br />
&#39;Best to keep it to myself, after all who would believe me?&#39; he asked himself aloud. He soon met up with a couple of his friends during one of the breaks in the day and went off towards their next class together.<br />
<br />
After getting dressed as best she could eventually managing to stuff her oversized feet into shoes clearly not designed for something amphibian, Kendra was nearly home. Thankfully her parents were away jet setting around Europe for the month which at least meant that Kendra would have time and space to figure out what was happening. As she approached her front door, the pain in her feet was now overwhelming from being in such cramped conditions, she was no more than 10 feet away now but as she stepped forward the pain caused her to stumble and leap incredibly right up to the door. Unlocking her house she ripped off her shoes, threw them inside and then threw herself in with them. Kendra sighed with relief but was met with a very unusual sound, it was like a deep rumble inside her stomach until it worked it&#39;s way up her body and out of her mouth.<br />
&#39;CROOOOAAAK!&#39; Kendra was stunned, even in all her time as a werefrog she&#39;d never croaked before. Quickly she looked over herself and once again stripped down to nothing. In the time it has taken her to walk home her breasts had shrank to mere B cups and her chest had become a much lighter shade of green. Her back had also decided it wanted to get her attention and began to ache, forcing her to bend over slightly as if she were some kind of hunchback. It didn&#39;t take long to realise that she was being forced onto all fours like a normal frog. At first she resisted but the longer it went on the more painful it became until eventually she was crouched down in the middle of the hallway with her hands flat on the floor in front of her and her webbed feet splayed out proudly to her sides. Resigned to her situation Kendra instinctively hopped forward and was surprised at not only how natural it felt but just how easy it was. Her current predicament still worried her however, afterall she&#39;d never transformed this much before and was it going to continue or had it stopped, all she knew was that it must&#39;ve started after she&#39;d had sex with that guy in the showers. There and then she decided that she needed to find him again and figure out what had caused this.<br />
<br />
Kevin couldn&#39;t stop day dreaming about the frog girl in the shower, the way the water ran down her slick form, her flippers everything about her was perfect to him and he only wished he could have asked her name. But he was soon snapped back to reality when his feet and hands began to burn with heat. Looking down at his hands he noticed a very small and thin layer of skin between his fingers, only about an inch or two in length. Flexing his fingers he could see that not only did it move with his hands but it was also growing. Kevin&#39;s mind raced was this happening to his feet too, why was this happening at all, it must&#39;ve been from that frog girl he concluded. By the time the class could leave Kevin shot out as quickly as he could and made his way home but even stopping to talk to his friends, on the way he checked his hands.<br />
&#39;Yep it&#39;s still growing.&#39; He thought to himself as the webbing had now passed his first knuckle on each finger. The burning feeling in his feet finally got the better of him and he ducked behind a tree as he could take no more and clumsily managed to free them from his shoes before removing his socks soon after. Kevin almost couldn&#39;t contain his excitement as he saw his feet were not only webbed but were growing and reshaping into his very own set of flippers. He needed to find that girl again, if nothing else to thank her for what was happening.</p>
