<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">                                                                             -Sorry, I know it&#39;s slow-going just trying to do it right.-<br />
<br />
Selicia was used to leers and gawking on her outings to the locals. It wasn&#39;t a surprise to her that it should still be so, even now. Looking around to the various people making their way through the streets. It was made it clear to her there was more to it than her innate beauty this time. Her manner of dress was so far divided from all those around her that they couldn&#39;t help but, stare. Maybe she should take a little more stock of her surroundings before she allowed herself to get lost in the eyes of the admiring. She settled onto a bench along the walkway and took stock of the town around her.<br />
<br />
Horseless coaches, near everything made from stone, so many people, and the noise was pervasive. Without a doubt, she was rather far-flung from when she had been prominent. Quite a numerous amount of people stared into glowing tablets while many more held them to their heads talking. Had magic become so widespread that common folk had gained access to it? That would have been the only thought to put a stab through her heart. If that were the truth, she may have to be concerned with another general backlash... Not wanting to display ignorance, she moved on eyeing more of this magic than paying attention to the crowds. She really needed a sufficient place to think so she wandered looking for where the powerful might reside.<br />
<br />
After walking for hours, consciously avoiding the unsavory areas for now, she found prospects. After being turned away by multiple of them, she had concluded that maybe magic wasn&#39;t prevalent as she had first thought. There would&#39;ve been noone who couldn&#39;t tell how versed she was if so. Walking up to yet another prospect, she had found one of the servants outside sweeping the walkway. Here would be an easy-in she thought to herself approaching the serving girl. The girl in question couldn&#39;t have been far into her twenties with a youthful face framed by dark brown locks. Beyond her facial appearance, she was slender of build and fairly short of stature. She would have to do for now.<br />
<br />
Selicia sauntered up to the girl, hips swaying seductively as she wanted undivided attention for this. &quot;I say, girl, a moment of your time?&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl turned at the beckoning and straightened up seeing the sultry woman approaching her. &quot;Yes? What could I do for you?&quot; She leaned the broom in her hands against the wall to better present herself.<br />
<br />
At least she seems to be well trained, Selicia thought to herself as she reached out and pulled the girl in for a deep kiss. Magic and tongue worked finely in the unprepared girl&#39;s mouth and it was under a minute before her eyes glazed lustfully. Pulling away from the kiss, she gave it a moment for the magic to settle, just to be sure. Satisfied that the young woman was fully under control she started with the basics. &quot;What is you name, sweet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Marina, my lady.&quot; Marina&#39;s eyes were lost in the lust of the spell. Her breath left her lips huskily as the spell worked its way deeper into her consciousness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, good... I need an audience with your masters. Would you be such a dear as to show me in?&quot; She brushed a finger under Marina&#39;s chin drawing her forward with a pleased expression on her face. She watched as Marina hurriedly made for the manor leaving her cleaning duty completely forgotten. Selicia followed easily behind, once again peering around her surroundings. A fountain showered water into a pool just in front of the main entrance. Now that gave Selicia an idea for the proceedings of the evening. Marina showed Selicia to the lounge and left to announce her arrival. It was a mild wait before the assumed Lord and Lady of the house sat across from her with a rather dour woman behind them. Must be the head-servant of the household, she could prove to be an issue. <br />
<br />
&quot;What brings you to our home, Lady Luxdorn, was it?&quot; The Lord spoke clearly yet, uncertainly. He wore a fine suit fit well over a somewhat plump frame. To his right sat, either his mistress or his wife. She was a stark contrast in size wearing a thick gown obviously not expecting visitors. Age had eased its work on them both accentuated their features finely. It was always a treat to see where age had cared about its art. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like to make you an offer in exchange for operating my services out of your home. I&#39;m rather new here and haven&#39;t a place to stay.&quot; She sat primly for now not wanting to risk playing her hand too early, she so hated being rushed. &quot;I can offer you a modicum of... Immortality in return for your agreement.&quot;<br />
<br />
Skeptical looks were shared between the Lord and Lady with the offer rendered. &quot;I see...&quot; The gentleman responded hesitantly. &quot;I do believe we may be done here... I haven&#39;t the time for such foolishness. I...&quot; He paused as Selicia said something he couldn&#39;t understand. He turned to his wife to ask her and froze. His wife was a sight to behold as young as the day they had met so many years before. Age had released its grip on her as she stared disbelievingly at her hands. It was then that he noticed that his own clothing had loosened from his frame. He walked to the nearby mirror and saw his youthful form had been returned to him as well. He turned to find Selicia had allowed herself to recline upon the guest sofa with a self-satisfied grin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now do you believe I&#39;m capable?&quot; She settled back as the two drank in their changes. Her initial thoughts on their appearance had been correct, time had only advanced their already fine qualities. It would make less work for her as a result, eyeing the head-servant also proved correct seeing the expression had hardly changed. &quot;Now do we have a deal?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sputtering quietly the gentleman seated himself trying to keep his composure as he came back to task. &quot;I suppose you&#39;ve proven your ability to do so in a way. What is it you want from us for this gift?&quot; <br />
<br />
Ah, the climax is sometimes quick yet pleasing nonetheless. &quot;Just about everything you have...&quot; The old predatory smirk returned with its thousand year vengeance as she watched the realization dawn on them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what? We couldn&#39;t possibly... Sandra phone the poli...&quot; The gentleman and his wife were gone in a mist of magic spread from Selicia&#39;s hand. Sandra, the head-servant was now flabbergasted, an expression finally coming to the fore.<br />
<br />
&quot;What have you done to them?!&quot; Sandra demanded, stamping her foot for effect. Her expression had considerably hardened though, her gripped hands belied the bravado displayed.<br />
<br />
Selicia held her grin like a cat having cornered the mouse after a long chase. &quot;The same that&#39;ll befall you, if you don&#39;t gather the rest of your staff.&quot; She watched as Sandra fled the room and another lengthy wait ensued, however this time Marina had came into the room bearing tea and snacks for Selicia. She seemed giddy watching Selicia partake of them, the spell having taken firm hold over her. A servant that sought only to please their mistress was worth its weight in gold. She allowed herself a quiet chuckle at the memory of the golden princess. <br />
<br />
Finally, Sandra returned with the rest of the staff, there was a certain glint in her eyes... Selicia was going to have to get rid of Sandra for sure, good that she already had an appropriate replacement. &quot;I&#39;m certain you&#39;re all aware of the situation at hand but, let me state it personally. I have been gifted everything as well as yourselves in exchange for my service to your previous masters.&quot; There was a hushed conversation among the staff and Sandra stepped forward again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve already alerted the authorities of what has transpired they will be here shortly. As if we&#39;d serve a wo...&quot; Sandra found herself unable to speak reaching to her mouth to find a smooth patch of wood in its place. Without much further ado, her arms forced themselves into place at her sides and legs had begun to fuse into one. Her body seemed to melt through her clothing inwardly as her skin rapidly became wood. Within a few minutes there was a lifesize wooden statue of the woman, fear frozen in her eyes. Her body shrank away both in height and width soon leaving a pile of clothing where once she stood.<br />
<br />
Marina quickly approached the clothing that the rest of the staff had backed away from fearing for themselves. She returned to Selicia handing her a sizable wooden wand with the grip carved in to the figure of a nude woman. A reflexive rubbing of her thumb along the grip immediately followed as she regarded the rest of the people before her. &quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry, I want be keeping her like this.&quot; All the time, she quietly added to herself. Satisfied, she left the manor with the loud sounds and lights flashing outside. Marina immediately accompanied her outside as they passed the fountain fixture headed for the main gate. Two men stood outside the gate wearing matching colors. Must be the local authority that Sandra had mentioned...<br />
<br />
&quot;We received a call from one of the staff members, is everything alright this evening?&quot; The first of the two called out to Selicia as she approached. He stood resolutely with his hand on his belt obviously putting on a confident air. <br />
<br />
&quot;Everything is just fine, it seems that our head-servant had thought she saw something suspicious. We&#39;ve since searched for ourselves and found nothing. I&#39;m so sorry that you had to be bothered.&quot; Magic rode her breath out to the men as she batted her eyes cordially. The magic took to the two men more subtly than Marina, couldn&#39;t risk anymore of a show outside after all. They nodded politely to Selicia and left in their carriage, the lights blinking out, along the way. Selicia turned back to the manor and this time stopped to inspect the fountain fixture. A pair of nude statues stood in mid prance spitting water into the air above them. The Lord and Lady had never looked better than they did now preserved forever in marble. Marble, that&#39;s the way to entomb someone correctly... <br />
<br />
&quot;Marina...&quot; Selicia spoke to the young girl without turning from the fountain statues. &quot;You are to take the role of head-servant and teach me all you know about this place.&quot; She smiled as she got an affirmative response from Marina. Leaving the statues, Selicia went into the manor and gave the staff their first order. &quot;I want some of you to spread the word about a &#39;magical shop&#39; that&#39;ll make wishes come true. I don&#39;t care the method you use, just get it done, dears.&quot; She smiled demurely in contrast to the presented former Sandra in her hand. Now all she would have to do is wait for her first customers to arrive.</p>
