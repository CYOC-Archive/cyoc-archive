<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty and Dustin returned to the cafeteria to finish off lunch. 
<br>
 &quot;Well what now?&quot; asked Dustin, &quot;Who are you gonna help?&quot; 
<br>
 Ty looked across the room, and said &quot;Maybe myself.&quot; He had been looking at Janet Wolfe, the prize of the senior class. Ty had been nurturing a crush on her ever 
<br>
 since his first day of high school. 
<br>
 He focused a thought upon himself. Ty felt his body become larger. &quot;No&quot; he thought and returned himself to normal. &quot;If she's to love me, it will be for whom I am.&quot; 
<br>
 First there was the problem of actually working up the courage to talk to her. Ty--who was painfully shy--decided he could cheat a little. &quot;I wish I wasn't so 
<br>
 inhibited&quot; he thought. Lo and behold, he now felt slightly fearless and unrestrained. He walked over to her table... 
<br>
 15 minutes later later Dustin asked, &quot;Well, how did it go?&quot; Ty removed his hand from his face, revealing a black eye. &quot;Her boyfriend was with her. We didn't get 
<br>
 along. She told me to drop dead.&quot; Dustin whistled. &quot;Well Ty, how are you gonna get your revenge? Why didn't you use your powers on the guy?&quot; &quot;I dunno. I still 
<br>
 felt afraid of getting into a fight. My wish wasn't big enough.&quot; 
<br>
 The bell rang. Dustin got up to go to Shop, while Ty walked toward American Government, the only class he shared with Janet. He felt slightly apprehensive over 
<br>
 seeing her again. &quot;That's it,&quot; he said inwardly, &quot;I wish for all of my inhibitions to drastically weaken. If I'm angry, I'll BE angry.&quot; Ty was at the time of life when 
<br>
 hormones flood the brain--this, along with his recent wish, would fatally undermine his judgement. 
<br>
 35 students settled into their desks as Mr. Conifer began his customarily dull lecture on John Locke. Half the class were asleep within 15 minutes. Ty watched with 
<br>
 anger as Janet and her boyfriend, Christian, whispered and chatted at the back of the room, only 15 feet away from him. They once looked in his direction 
<br>
 scornfully. Ty reached breaking point. &quot;That's it,&quot; he thought, &quot;I'll show them. She thinks her boyfriend's hot? Wait'll she gets a load of ME.&quot; Ty made a wish, and 
<br>
 felt his cloths tighten. His hands grew longer and larger, while his arms slowly began to increase in muscle size. His biceps bulged outward. A dark sprinkling of hair 
<br>
 grew on his arms. The sleeves of his T-shirt grew super tight, as the front began to strain. He felt his pecs pumping up and rebelling against the fabric of the shirt. 
<br>
 Chest hair could be seen sprouting beneath his collar. 
<br>
 Ty felt a jolt of ecstasy as the testosterone flowed through him, his build lengthening and thickening as every muscle transformed. Baggy jeans grew super tight as 
<br>
 his legs lengthened. His nose and chin began growing forward as his face lost all its baby fat and reshaped toward maturity, becoming more rugged thanks to the 
<br>
 peach fuzz blooming over his face. Hair began to get in his eyes, and whiskers now adorned his chin and upper lip. The eyes glinted under the thicker brows, and 
<br>
 he grinned with wolfish pleasure as he felt his genitalia expand and ballon, the blood rushing through. His shirt became too short, and he could see a thick line of 
<br>
 hair out from his shredding boxers and sprout up past his belly button, over his thick abs. 
<br>
 All his clothing thankfully remained mostly intact, except for his shoes. He felt his socks break apart, and then his feet bulged through his shoes until the canvas fell 
<br>
 apart. His feet grew to basketball-player proportions, and his legs hair grew all the way down to his toes. 
<br>
 Ty looked around the classroom. He had made sure nobody would notice the changes, expecpt for one person... 
<br>
 Janet looked at him and then did a frenzied double-take. She saw a tall, strong, unshaven 18 year-old boy--roguish, dark-haired and with eyes of the most 
<br>
 hypnotic blue. His clothing amply showed off his considerable muscles. Ty grinned at her. She looked puzzled and turned to her boyfriend. She looked at Christian 
<br>
 with a gaze that can only signify true love--something Ty hadn't counted on. She filed Ty under her cute-guys file and then returned her gaze to her true love. 
<br>
 Ty was flabbergasted. His mind hadn't yet adjusted to the mindset of an 18 year old's. He had no understanding of love. What he felt for Janet had been purely 
<br>
 carnal, and he was enraged at her inability to respond at the same level. Thanks to the recent transformation the hormones were still swilrling around in his brain. 
<br>
 His rage increased. He banged his hand on the desk. &quot;No!!&quot; he shouted. The class turned around to look at him. Mr.Conifer snidely asked, &quot;Is something wrong 
<br>
 Tyler?&quot; &quot;Shut up!&quot; snarled Ty, glorying in his loss of inhibitions. His fellow students laughed raucously and pandemonium broke out. Ty looked around to see 
<br>
 Christian and Judy sneak in a french kiss amidst all the confusion. Christian put his hand up Janet's dress, as she mouthed what sounded like &quot;I love you.&quot; 
<br>
 Ty lost all control. &quot;I'll show them!&quot; he thought, &quot;I rip them to shreds! I'll tear her little boyfriend from limb to limb, and then make her do it with me, I'll kill 'em all, 
<br>
 let me at them, let me&quot; his thoughts quickly lost all rationality, and in his hormone crazed bloodlust a wish from his unconscious came into his brain. 
<br>
 Ty pitched forward onto the floor as his horified classmates watched. His hands, facing the ground, bulged lengthwise. Spasms rocked his body, as his feet splayed 
<br>
 outward, the toes lengthening while tufts of hair grew on them. His arms ballooned with muscle and hair as the sleeves of his shirt tore apart. The hands and feet 
<br>
 were twice normal size. Ty screamed with rage and pain as drool fell from his mouth, his teeth sharpening into fangs. His nose began pushing outward, the nostrils 
<br>
 upturned while his facial hair spread over his forehead. Blue eyes stared out with fright and anger from the bushy unibrow that extended nearly to the pointy, fleshy 
<br>
 ears. 
<br>
 The 18 year old struggled to his super-long, furry feet, whose toes began curving into claws. He stood upright. His pecs and abs pushed through his black T-shirt. 
<br>
 The clawed hands pulled it apart as his back tore through the back. His T-shirt exploded into a thousand pices while he roared. His magnificent chest quickly was 
<br>
 being overrun by sprouting chest hair. Fur raced over his arms, feet and back. His still boyish face truned bestial: brow sloping downward, nostrils blackening, hairy 
<br>
 chin and nose pushing out into a muzzle, forehead shrinking drastically. 
<br>
 &quot;Oh, the pain, the pain, bring on the pain,&quot; he moaned in a deep voice as his fangs sharpened, the face shaping into a canine profile. The jeans tore apart at the 
<br>
 back as a tail shot out. His calves decimated the lower parts in a storm of muscle and fur. His thick, dark, and huge penis poked out. It tickened further and strined 
<br>
 with blood until a fold of skin encased it. His balls swung haphazardly as a raw pink organ slipped out of his newly formed sheath. 
<br>
 Ty's body grew enveloped with fur. His jeans fell to the floor in rags. His eyes lost all human recognition, and the creature fell onto all fours. The new werewolf 
<br>
 streched and howled to the bright mid-day sun. The class stood petrified with fear and disbelief. The creature that had once been Ty gazed with red eyes at 
<br>
 Christian, who fell to the ground screaming, his body changing shape. A deer got up in Christian's place. The class screamed and ran out, the werewolf pursuing the 
<br>
 deer. Dustin, attracted by the noise, imediately grasped the situation and gaped with horror. &quot;Oh no! Ty! Oh, what'll I do now ?!&quot; He stood shocked, and 
<br>
 pondered his next move.</p>
