<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Erick went to sleep after watching his 11 years old neighbor turning into a 30 years old man. What a surprise he will get at the morning!<br />
<br />
The next day, Erick woke up earlier than usual, he went to the bathroom and made a sandwich before he returned to his bedroom. The first sun rays where crossing through his window when he heard a scream, the deep manly scream that he was waiting to hear.<br />
<br />
Erick cannot help laughing uncontrollably while he watched the same burly man he saw proudly sleeping last night panicking and running all over his bedroom without knowing how he got all those muscles and hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-what&#39;s this?!!&quot; Fredrick shouted while he found out his new bushy armpits after flexing his stronger arms. &quot;This isn&#39;t happening!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Fredrick ran out of his room to where Erick assumed was the bathroom. Unfortunately, he can&#39;t see what was happening there so he took that time to eat his sandwich. He sat on his desk and then it&#39;s when he remembered the rest of the vials he left there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey?! What are those screams!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit! That&#39;s Fredrick&#39;s mom!!&quot; Erick grinned while he came back to his window. He could see that woman was knocking at her son&#39;s door. Almost, immediately Fredrick came out of his bathroom and began to panic even worse than before. &quot;I can&#39;t let her mother to see him.&quot; Erick thought. &quot;She could call the cops and complicated my little joke.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What I&#39;m going to do! What I&#39;m going to do!!&quot; Fredrick repeated continuously as he tried to look for a place to hide. Unfortunately to him, there was no place in his room to hide anything of his size, nor under the bed, nor behind the closet. He was trapped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Over here!&quot; Erick said to the almost naked man who immediately realized that his only choice was to leave through the window. He opened it, and using his stronger and beefier legs he managed to land on his neighbor Erick&#39;s room and hide under the window as soon as he came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, Fredrick! I&#39;m not going to stay here all day!!&quot; His mother said as she opened the door. However, when she entered, her son wasn&#39;t there anymore. &quot;Where are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, mrs. Foley.&quot; Erick said. &quot;Are you looking for Fredrick?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Erick. Good morning!&quot; She replied. &quot;Yes, he has a soccer play in an hour and he asked me to wake him up but he&#39;s not in his bedroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s why I saw him awake so early.&quot; Erick lied. &quot;He was wearing a soccer uniform when he left his room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, maybe he has left with his friends! That boy, always so anxious!&quot; She said. &quot;I&#39;m going to call him!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot; Fredrick shouted when he heard his cellphone ringtone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you bring your cellphone? Really?&quot; Erick whispered to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do I do?&quot; Fredrick replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Answer it! So, she wouldn&#39;t freak out!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um? Hello?&quot; Fredrick awkwardly said as he answered the call.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not like that! You moron!!&quot; Erick told him as he heard him talking with his deep manly voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-hello?&quot; Fredrick repeated while he did his best effort to sound like a kid. It&#39;s not necessary to say that he sounded ridiculous and little convincing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fredrick? Where are you? I&#39;m in your bedroom!&quot; His mother said and Erick could see her talking in the other room. &quot;Have you left early? You could tell me!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; Y-yes.&quot; Fredrick replied and Erick was trying hard to contain his laughs. &quot;I&#39;m already on the soccer field.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you alright? You sound weird.&quot; She asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s m-my cellphone, it&#39;s n-not working well.&quot; Fredrick said. &quot;I think I need a new one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We could talk about it later.&quot; She replied. &quot;Your father and I will be there after he finishes his breakfast. Take care, honey!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that was close.&quot; Erick said while he saw the woman leaving her son&#39;s bedroom. &quot;Now, about you...&quot; He said while he saw hunky man shyly sitting under his window. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know! I was fine when I went to sleep last night but in the morning I woke up looking like this!&quot; His hands were shaking as if he don&#39;t want to touch his own body.<br />
<br />
&quot;I couldn&#39;t believe it if didn&#39;t look it by myself!&quot; Erick was playing well his act of not knowing what&#39;s happening. &quot;Look at you! A boy doesn&#39;t grow 20 years older in a night!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what to do! Help me, Erick! I&#39;m truly scared!&quot; Fredrick was sobbing. &quot;What if I don&#39;t go back to normal? What I will do? My parents won&#39;t believe me! I won&#39;t be able to go back to my home! I will have to look for a job but who will hire a man that hasn&#39;t gone to high school!! I will have to work as a bus driver or something as horrible as that but I don&#39;t even know how to drive!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Fredrick, calm down. You&#39;re overreacting!&quot; Erick put a hand on the guy&#39;s shoulder and he was surprised of how big and strong it felt. &quot;You don&#39;t have to worry about it now. First, we need to find you some clothes. Your dick has been slipping out of your boxers all this time...&quot;<br />
<br />
Fredrick looked down and realized that Erick was right. The thick head of his dick was on sight in his left thigh. &quot;Oh shit!&quot; He shouted while he tried to cover it by pulling down his boxers&#39; fabric. However it just made his pubic hair bush to skip to sight. &quot;Ehm, do you have some boxers you can lend me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t wear extra large.&quot; Erick giggled. &quot;But, let me see what can I find!&quot;<br />
<br />
Fredrick blushed bright red after hearing it. &quot;T-thanks&quot; He always thought that Erick was a big guy and he can&#39;t believe that now he was bigger than him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suggest you to take off those ones, unless you don&#39;t want to have descendants if you know what I mean!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;B-but I will be naked!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, it&#39;s not like I haven&#39;t seen it before.&quot; Erick grinned. &quot;You&#39;re not the first man who has grown hair down there!&quot;<br />
<br />
Although he knew that Erick wasn&#39;t making fun of him. He felt embarrassed when he remembered that he hadn&#39;t any hair down there last night.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what are you waiting for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C-can I have some privacy? I&#39;ve never been naked in front of anyone before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, ok.&quot; Erick said as he tried to contain his laughter. &quot;I&#39;ll go to look for your clothes so you can have your time to... do your things.&quot; He winked at Fredrick and although the guy didn&#39;t know what he meant, Erick was sure of what will happen while he left the room.</p>
