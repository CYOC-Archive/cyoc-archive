<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the bathroom at the university, not far away from classes ongoing, one Keisuke Akahara enjoyed the fruits of being one of the most attractive and capable students there. The Japanese student had long been far more interested in what his powerful body could give him sex wise than what his brain could give him in terms of scholastics. <br />
<br />
He was quite a bodybuilder, having an amazing, athletic body - which he used to pursue sex as much as he wanted. His light brown hair, almond colored eyes, and angular, handsome features also helped. Granted he had to repeatedly tell quite a few men he wasn&#39;t that kind of muscle man, but it was all pretty much worth it. Indeed, while he kept up with his classes, he was keen to enjoy hook-ups. Kei grunted as he looked down at the woman presently sucking his cock, one of his regular &quot;fuck buddies&quot;.<br />
<br />
He knew her from class. Knew that she was every bit as bored as he was with what they were expected to do here. Knew that she wanted to explore more of the pleasurable side of life. And honestly, who could blame her when the most eminently desirable man in the given room was Keisuke Akahara.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, that&#39;s it... I need this, after that shitty lecture...&quot; Kei grunted. The woman bobbed her head up and down the cock, taking the tip into her throat, before pulling back up, letting him get a good look at those nice fucking tits and that beautiful face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can---can I feel your muscles after I finish...?&quot; She asked, eagerly. Of course. She had never really seen a guy like him before. Bodybuilding wasn&#39;t as big over here as it was in America. The trend was more the pop singer pretty boy than the muscled stud. But some elements of that culture were starting to permeate - and there was a sense of curiosity now. A sense Keisuke readily exploited to his own enjoyment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, yeah, you better...!&quot; Kei groaned. He was not exactly a nice guy - most of his classmates from back in the day could attest to that. And THAT was before Keisuke got into bodybuilding, and making himself as big as he was now. But, hey, he was hot, and girls liked to suck his cock. And getting his muscles appreciated was a nice finisher to---ohhhh yeah yeah there it WAS! Kei growled, grabbing the top of her head, slamming his cock in her throat, pumping a massive load of cum. She moaned, gagging a little, but she was clearly enjoying herself. And he swore he even heard her give a little &quot;Hawk Tuah&quot;, making him grin a little.<br />
<br />
One day, he hoped he could go over to America for a vacation. The women there would probably very much appreciate a regular Asian Adonis.<br />
<br />
He stepped back and she looked up, coughing, grinning. He opened up his shirt, showing his athletic, muscular build. A work of countless hours in the gym, he wasn&#39;t lying when he thought of it as a damn fine work of art. And she loved it, her hands going all over it, rubbing him, massaging him. Kei let out a long groan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, yes, you love my fucking muscles, don&#39;t you?&quot; He chuckled, &quot;You never seen a man like me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;None of the boys in class are anything like you...&quot; The woman said, eagerly looking him over...but then she got a look at her watch, and she blushed. Realizing how long the two of them had been in here fucking around between classes. And that she would likely be at least a little late. Not to mention having to clean herself up after all of...that.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should go, now. Don&#39;t want to miss the next class.&quot; He said impishly. As if he wasn&#39;t the reason she was probably gonna be late.<br />
<br />
She nodded, standing up, her eyes still on him. He knew she was staring at his muscles. It made him feel so fucking great. As he buttoned up his shirt again, his eyes went to his reflection in the mirror, and how good he looked. Yeah. That was a damn fine looking man. There was one element of the stereotype that held true - and that was that Keisuke was self absorbed. And who wouldn&#39;t be if you looked like that? He grinned at himself...<br />
<br />
...Then he was interrupted, even as he started looking himself over and enjoying the way the sweat on his button up made his shirt cling to his muscles. He grumbled as he pulled out his phone to see a text from that nerd who he&#39;d forced to help him study for exams. Rinji Danzai. The two of them had something of a history. Rinji had long been someone Kei had pushed around. Made to help him and give him answers - if you wanted an explanation for a muscle head like Kei being in one of Japan&#39;s best universities, you could begin and end with Rinji Danzai.<br />
<br />
&#39;Hey,&#39; the text went, &#39;I know you&#39;re very into hook-up culture, and I figured you&#39;d like to know I have finished a Nanomachine project in which I surmise they can give you the ultimate sexual experience.&#39; It almost made Keisuke chuckle, the very idea of that dork being involved in anything remotely resembling sex. Honestly, it kind of surprised Kei that Rinji even knew what fucking was, given how shy the little fucker was back in high school.<br />
<br />
Kei stared at the message, and then licked his lips. He saw no reason to say no. After all, if there was anything that he loved, it was sexual experiences - and exploring new ones. He&#39;d even let one of his girlfriends peg him once - just to see what all this &quot;male G-Spot&quot; stuff was about. He hadn&#39;t been disappointed then. He looked forward to having something new to enjoy, and so he made his way out, starting to text - wondering what kind of sexual experience this might be. He was always down for more pleasure, more fucking, and if Rinji could suddenly help him out...well. He was no stranger to making Rinji help him have fun.<br />
<br />
&#39;What the hell, come over, lets check it out,&#39; was Kei&#39;s response, and so it was that Rinji made his way over to the place that Kei lived. A nice little apartment in Tokyo...rendered a bit of a mess. The interior had fitness weights and health food wrappers all over the place. A closet full of stringer tank tops, pants, short shorts, and a dresser full of boxer briefs. There were even some clothes stuffed under his bed that his girlfriend(s) had forgotten in their haste to leave.<br />
<br />
Kei was not exactly surprised to see that the young man who knocked and then entered his pad was pretty much the same nerdy little guy that he&#39;d always been. Just older, and taller - not a whit more impressive. His black hair was disorderly and messy, a bang covering one of his eyes. He seemed to be holding a briefcase. Kei decided to see what this was, where Rinji went with this. Taking a seat, Kei asked, &quot;So what in the hell is this about? And how is this gonna---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve finished a Nanomachine experiment, and I believe the results will be very satisfying - I remember even back in high school, you were always...quite a libertine,&quot; Rinji said. &quot;I want to inject a sample into your bloodstream and see the results. I believe the Nanomachines are capable of stimulating pleasure centers autonomously, and can enhance the potency of the sexual experience.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And...that&#39;s gonna help me out in the sack...?&quot; Keisuke crossed his arms. As usual, even with those most basic topics, he was hopeless.<br />
<br />
&quot;It means the Nanomachines will be injected in you, and they&#39;ll make every ahem, cum stronger, more potent, and you can probably even have consecutive orgasms...like, mm, you know, I&#39;ve heard that---like, women have...&quot; Rinji elucidated, though he blushed as he put it in that more vulgar way. And Keisuke noted that, wondering for a moment why the nerd would even pursue this kind of thing if it meant having to blush every time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, sounds interesting enough. Where&#39;s this shot?&quot; Keisuke admitted the idea of consecutive orgasms, completely deleting his refractory period...it was alluring. Hell, he had long wished he could go on and on...the way his girlfriends talked about cumming multiple times in the act...if he could have that...as a man...<br />
<br />
&quot;Right here.&quot; Rinji said, taking out an injector from the briefcase. Keisuke looked at the injector, at the swirling mass of grey machines inside of the device, and he promptly rolled up his sleeve.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go right ahead, shots don&#39;t scare me...they make me feel manly.&quot; Kei laughed, and Rinji, without hesitation, pushed the needle right into Kei&#39;s right arm at the standard location for a shot. The nerd watched with an eager little smile as he observed the Nanomachines disappear into Keisuke&#39;s arm. And surprisingly, it seemed like there was no register of pain or any kind of discomfort. Keisuke just watched the injection happen...and sat there the whole time.<br />
<br />
Kei sat back once the shot was done, and put his hands behind his neck, &quot;So, anything happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. It takes a minute or two to sync up. Then I&#39;ll be able to...&quot; Rinji pulled out his phone and saw it looked like an app synchronization was done. &quot;There we go. I should be able to...&quot; He typed away on his phone and looked at Keisuke the bully, sitting there in his button up shirt and khakis. <br />
<br />
Rinji promptly hit a few buttons to induce an orgasm in Keisuke as quickly as possible. The effects were almost instant. The Nanomachines kicked into overdrive, and Keisuke let out a loud groan. He started to shudder, and his legs spread apart. The Japanese 20-something almost fell backward on to his couch, and clutched his knees in his hands. Biting his lip, the man let out a long, harsh grunt as he felt his cock, suddenly immensely hard, throbbing and beginning to shoot already. Rinji watched, feeling a thrill run through his veins. Kei grunted, &quot;Mmmmmfffuuuuuck what&#39;s----mmmmf...all outta nowhere---oooh shiiiit!&quot; He leaned his head back, and let out a long, drawn out moan...<br />
<br />
His body shuddered, and he panted. His chest heaved and his anus clenched. Then, as Rinji watched, a spurt of cum blasted from the crotch of Keisuke&#39;s khakis into the air and landed on the ground. The muscle man laid there, moaning, gasping, and grinning despite the suddenness of it as he realized what happened. &quot;Ho...! Holy shit that was something else!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Rinji said with a smirk, &quot;Because...&quot; He typed something in again, and said, &quot;I just made you cum again.&quot; And Keisuke for his part almost couldn&#39;t believe it. Almost wondered if Rinji was being serious right now. But as he sat there, he felt the bubbling, intense sensation in his still erect cock that told him that he was gonna...!! <br />
<br />
And sure enough, a few seconds later, Kei was letting out a loud, low grunt, and his eyes closed tight as he leaned his head back, a second orgasm taking hold. He shuddered and twitched - his body shaking as he felt the second one in less than five minutes hitting him. It was true - refractory period be damned! &quot;F-fuck...fucking, ahhhh, holy shhhhit....&quot; He was twitching and shuddering and he couldn&#39;t believe how good this felt. This was the best decision of his whole damn week.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how was that one, big man?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;F-fuck...&quot; Keisuke groaned, laying there increasingly sweaty. &quot;That&#39;s....that&#39;s the best fuckin&#39; stuff ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be heading out soon,&quot; Rinji said, &quot;But if you&#39;d like, I could set something to work to further give you even more sensitive experiences.&quot; Rinji knew that there were several experiments he could stand to complete while he had such a willing test subject here. Keisuke was convenient, and no matter what Rinji did to him, as long as he turned back by the end, there was no issue - and no guilt in it. After all, with their personal history it amused the nerdy student to be so empowered over his bully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, do it, please...&quot; Keisuke lazily smiled, looking at him with obvious desire in his eyes. Rinji smirked, and tapped something in...</p>
