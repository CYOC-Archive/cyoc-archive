<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With Jenna and Richard’s little rebellion stopped the show could go on and the crowd couldn’t be happier.<br />
“Now what do you say we continue on with our show?!” The witch shouted to a roaring applause.<br />
Chelsea watched the strange spectacle and realized there was no escape, she turned to Madam Illusia and said, “Can you transform me now? I just want to be with my friend.”<br />
Madam was pleased at least one of her “volunteers” was eager to accept her fate and join her wonderful family. This young woman would be an excellent baby sister to baby Deborah, she smiled at this apparent enthusiasm and began to work her magic.<br />
“Yes my widdle good girl!”  Chelsea didn&#39;t resist.  She just stood there and let Madame make all of her clothes disappear except for her panties.  Her panties thickened and took on a papery type appearance.  The paper like thick panties tore themselves at the seams and grew a single velcro tab at the end of the back flaps of her torn panties making them turn from torn papery panties into a full on diaper.  The flaps of her diaper positioned themselves on toward the front crotch panel as the velcro fastened the diaper into place.  On the back of the diaper toward the top, the waist bunched up forming stretchy waist gathers that could stretch to conform perfectly to Chelsea&#39;s body.  On the front top of the diaper, a round piece was removed exposing Chelsea&#39;s belly button.  Leak guards formed around the padding in Chealsea&#39;s diaper to stop urine or feces from escaping the diaper.  Finally leg gathers form around both legs so that Chelsea&#39;s diaper would have a secure fit, but be loose enough to comfortably wriggle around in.  On her right wrist, a yellow plastic band formed showing Chelsea&#39;s name and listing Madame illusia as her parent.  There was also a home address on the band, but she didn&#39;t recognize it, but Chelsea assume that she would be living there now.   One thing Madame didn&#39;t do was cover Chelsea&#39;s breasts leaving them exposed.  For Chelsea&#39;s physical changes, Madame did some unique things.  First she removed Chelsea&#39;s teeth leaving her with nothing but gums.  Madame didn&#39;t need Chelsea biting her when breast feeding.  Chelsea used her tongue and felt the absence of teeth in her mouth.  She understood that she wouldn&#39;t be eating pizza or steak ever again.  Madame then removed all of Chelsea&#39;s body and head hair leaving Chelsea bald all over including her head and crotch.  When finished with that, She removed Chelsea&#39;s bladder and bowel muscles as well as the nerves that control those muscles so that she could wet and mess uncontrollably without having to worry about a toilet ever again.  At this point, Madame got an idea.  She turned toward the tanks and slowly sealed Jenna  and Richard&#39;s eyelids so that they were just one solid piece of skin covering their eyes making it impossible to ever open their eyelids again.  She did the same to Jenna and Richard&#39;s nostril openings and lips sealing them up as solid skin so that they would never be open again.  They didn&#39;t need their eyes, nose, or mouth anymore.  The feeding pump gave them food, the ventilator breathed for them, and they obviously didn&#39;t need their eyes, though they could still see red light through the skin covering their eyes.  She then redirected her attention back to Chelsea.  Inside Chelsea&#39;s belly button, a small fleshy tube poked out, but was clamped shut with a yellow plastic umbilical cord clamp.  It hurt a little, but not enough to bother Chelsea.  Finally, she shrunk Chelsea&#39;s breasts down to prepuberty size leaving her flat chested  .Madame Illusia then turned to herself.  She pointed at her breasts as she could feel that her breasts were swollen and painful  On her blouse, wet stains started to appear and so she morphed her bra into a breast feeding bra that would absorb some of her milk.  Inside the bra cups, nursing pads formed absorbing yet more milk.  Finally, she flicked her wrists at the floor and a large adult sized infant carrier appeared on the floor.  &quot;Are you ready?&quot; asked Madame Illusia.  Chelsea took a deep breath, she knew what she had to do.  With great trepidation, she walked over to the giant infant carrier and climbed in.  She grabbed the straps and proceeded to strap herself in.  she took the crotch strap first, ran it between her legs and made sure to hold onto the buckle.  She then reached over her head and grabbed the shoulder straps and buckled them in.  She then grabbed the left strap drew it over her torso and buckled that in and finally, she grabbed the right strap, drew it across the other side of her torso and strapped it in finishing her work.  Madame then when over to Chelsea, tightened all the straps, but made sure to slip two fingers under each strap to make sure that the straps weren&#39;t too tight.  Madame was excited, she had Chelsea now.  Soon she&#39;d be feeding Chelsea with her mother&#39;s milk.  She then stuck her finger on Chelsea&#39;s head and began her brain drain.  Like the others, at first she felt nothing, but as more of her intellect slipped, the more empty holes were formed in her memory.  But then, those holes would wash away.  In Chelsea&#39;s case, Madame wiped everything from her just like Madame did with Jenna and Richard.  Chelsea was no longer capable of making memories nor did she have an identity.  Like her comrades in their respective tanks, she had proto-thoughts and nothing more.  However, she would not be joining her comrades in the tank.  Instead, she&#39;d be joining Deborah.  Unfortunately for Chelsea, she no longer remembered who Deborah was.  She didn&#39;t know who anyone including herself was anymore.  However, that didn&#39;t matter because Chelsea didn&#39;t care.  She was feeling discomfort and so she started wining a little bit.  Madame, in front of everyone on stage opened her blouse, unclasped one of the cups in her bra and removed the nursing pads.  She then kneeled beside Chelsea and rubbed her wet exposed breast on Chelsea&#39;s cheeks.  Instinctively, Chelsea turned her head, placed her lips around Madame&#39;s breast and started nursing.  Warm jets of milk spewed into Chelsea&#39;s mouth as she swallowed.  The discomfort went away for both Madame and Chelsea and both were content and calm.  The crowd awwed and Jack looked on in disgust.  He knew his time was up and resigned himself to countless wonderful days in Kindergarten wearing a plaid girl&#39;s jumper with a short skirt and flashing everyone his panties whenever he bent over, stretched, or jumped.  For some reason, the idea of starting from the bottom of an all-girls school gave him an erection.  He fantasized about being a girly-girl and accidentally flashing his panties when he twirled without caring.  He knew that he&#39;d still be in his male adult body, though.  That only made him more excited.  He&#39;d have to ask Madame to take away his sexuality and all of his sexual experience before destroying his mind when she got done feeding Chelsea.  He then continued to watch Madame feed Chelsea as Chelsea&#39;s body twitched and jerked like a newborn.  The crowd in the background awwed.</p>
