<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Its funny but just when you find yourself thinking one's reached so low that life isn't worth even living a ray of light peaks through.<br />
<br />
And so it was that I had pleaded with the Veterinary Doctor to favor me by having this animal put down, dead! Then not two days later you come, a ray of hope, a fond memory of what once was, you my dearest!<br />
<br />
I stand here wondering how in this wide world you found out what had happened to me?<br />
<br />
&quot;My dear, it was when you did not come home, after the Police spent three months searching. The returned your can and luggage, but could only suggest you met with foul play. I cried long and hard for you, praying that even if not alive your body could be found. Then I was cleaning up and ready to send your blongings to the Salvation Army when I found the sales slip.&quot; so told Bernice.<br />
<br />
I stood there listening, my tail swishing and flicking in nervous anticipation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes that sales slip for some $1060.00 price. It showed the Ointment Shop as where it was purchased so I began there. It took a bribe to some pretty young Chinese girl to tell of her visit late that last night before you vanished. She looked back into her Uncle's records and found the sale of Stallion Hair Rejouvinator. She told of a mistake by you her Uncle mention that poised the need for his second potion and her late night delivery.&quot; Bernice explained as she paced about.<br />
<br />
I could only agree to what she said as thus far it was all true.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was then she looked up and unwillingly told me of the second potion's purpose. It hit me hard that you were first so vane that you'd take a chance like that simply over being bald! I left the shop and walked until I made some sense over what occured. Then just before they closed that evening I entered the shop once more. The lovely girl had gone home and only that twisted old man was there. I told him that I'd learned of his coverup concerning my husband and one of his potions gone wrong. He argued, and I argued until he stopped and asked me why I had come?&quot; Bernice was by this time inside my stall and tossled the peak of my mane in her fingers.<br />
<br />
I felt and could see how nervous she was as I hung on every word of her story.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told him I wanted to know where you went and what his second potion might have done, even though the nice girl had informed me of its purpose. His explaining was the same as the girl with the one exception, he had no idea where you were once the final potion was consumed. I asked to see a bottle of his second potion and inquired of its cost. He saw through me in a second and smiled a friendly smile. I must say his pricing has a constant, $1060.00 cost plus State sales tax for the bottle.&quot; Bernice sighed and pulled the green glass bottle from out of her coat pocket.<br />
<br />
&quot;My dear it was after searching the information offered by that sad looking motel I came across Casandra. At first she would suggest she never knew you but when maybe she saw my urgency for the knowing of you and what happened, she opened up.  I was at first angered you would trust some unknown woman rather than you wife, but as she explained what she saw I changed my mind. I must agree she was nice enough to help you become boarded and then find a way to keep you financed here at the farm. In human terms what you do is unthinkable, but Casandra reminded me you were not living as a human anymore.&quot; at that she began to sniff back tears.<br />
<br />
I was feeling relaxed yet felt this was coming to a head somewhere. Maybe the worst of it was since I'd been a stallion this long I was showing who intent I was listening to every word by my pony size erection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dearest control yourself, can you put that away!&quot; she begged me.<br />
<br />
I replied to her, &quot;No dear it happens often when I or any pony stands and wonders!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I ended up coming here and then as now you know the story which led me to you. I have here this bottle, and down deep I hate it but for some mad reason I purchased it thinking to swallow it and join you again in life!&quot; said Bernice.<br />
<br />
I had an immediate wondering if she drank the potion if once she was a mare would she accept the crude beastly surroundings? Worse yet she being past the birthing years in human life, the potion would make her as I a very young Connemara pony. I said to her if she was willing to be mated as a mare, then reminded her that as animals we are property and we might in time be slit up. I asked then if this happened how she might feel being used for her gender mostly and bred to any other common stallion? I reminded her once as a pony animal she would become a lot like the pony mare in mind and personal feelings. Needless to say she had not yet considered those facts, so she slowly put the bottle back into her coat pocket.<br />
<br />
Bernice soon thereafter left and did not return. I felt even more lost until Jake came, he is the farm owner and knows of me and we talk often.<br />
<br />
As I am from what they tell me a black haired stallion of the Connemara breed Jake came in yesterday with this most perfect and just wildly sexy mare. He smiled at me and without one word placed her in the stall next to mine.<br />
<br />
I oggled her from head to rear, her form and conformation was one of style and beauty in a pony mare. A long slender body her hind quarters smooth of muscle and rounded so very perfect. Her tail set high she carried it with such grace it made me erect just to watch her prance and turn in the stall.<br />
<br />
I whinnied, nickkered, and then tried to talk to her in my still human tongued' ability. Yet she acted like any common and friendly pony mare.<br />
<br />
Then as I stood there in all my male glory masturbating off the passion I felt but could not show as a stallion might his mare, she spoke!</p>
