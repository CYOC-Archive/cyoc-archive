<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff&#39;s bear form wandered throughout the space allotted to &quot;The Hunt&quot; finding a boundary and walking along it until evening... He came across rabbits, squirrels, raccoons, possums, and even some deer, but everything kept a healthy distance from him so he couldn&#39;t tell if they were young men like himself or just animals.<br />
<br />
This question became more and more important as evening wore on and Jeff grew ravenous. He hadn&#39;t eaten since breakfast and nubbing the poacher had side effects that didn&#39;t stop at his human form... Jeff could feel himself feeling more, what? Feral? Animalistic? Does he still get testosterone when he isn&#39;t attached to his penis? Is this a normal part of being a jock? Is this a normal part of being a bear? Is he simply more in tune with his appetite because he weighs so much more?<br />
<br />
Bears in general are omnivorous, but he probably weighed as much as 4-5 men now and he had been moving all day to stay ahead of the hunters. Jeff didn&#39;t happen across any berry patches that could feed 4-5 200 lb men, meaning meat was his best option... He just needs to only kill female prey should he find it, or males if he sees they have a penis... Wait? No! He doesn&#39;t want to kill and eat wild, potentially disease ridden, game no matter how succulent, and delicious, and satisfying they might be...<br />
<br />
As evening fell an instinct led to him to start digging out what he could only call a burrow. He found himself oddly invigorated despite the day&#39;s activities. Several hours after the moon had risen however, Jeff was tired and slept in his hidey hole unsure if the hunters were allowed to use night vision goggles. Jeff&#39;s first night as a bear he slept surprisingly comfortably.<br />
<br />
As dawn filtered through the trees Jeff awoke with a start, eager to find food, and more willing to do whatever it takes to get it. His new senses told him, more things were about than first glance confessed. Sniffing the air Jeff&#39;s gut told him there were animals nearby, the nutty aroma of squirrels, the gamey scent of deer, and for the first time he could actually detect the flowers. It seemed as though staying in his animal form continued to make him more bear like, even after the obvious physical transformation had long since ended.<br />
<br />
After a healthy stretch, shaking any dirt off of himself from his burrow, and using a tree to scratch himself Jeff sniffed the air and detected the faint smell of water, without hesitation he began heading for it, maybe breakfast can be found there.<br />
<br />
*******************************************************************************************<br />
After Jeff&#39;s handgun became a rifle, Bill and Mike Sr. had made their way back to the office building where the hunt began. Entering, they found an office and explained what happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll want to fill out this form.&quot; The conservation officer began reading off the questions. Bill blasted through them.<br />
<br />
Bill accidentally said that Jeff was 16 and both Mike and the officer looked at him. &quot;Oh? Do you have an Early Jockimal Hunting Permit for him? Without it he shouldn&#39;t even be participating here.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, did I say 16? I meant 18. The only reason he&#39;s here is because he has to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, what type of creature does your son become as a Jockimal?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bill shifted uncomfortably, &quot;He never told me... He lost a bit of fat and gained some muscle just recently hitting the stats to qualify as a jock. Up until now he never could detach his penis.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm. Hopefully he practiced transforming before coming here.&quot; the officer let out a chuckle. &quot;Can you imagine how shitty this would be if it was his first actual transformation? Trying to learn a new body and run for your life! Boy that&#39;d suck... At the very least, school and the internet would have taught him plenty to prepare for this.&quot; (Bill cringed realizing for the first time just how awful he&#39;d been to Jeff.)<br />
<br />
&quot;He should be attempting to come forward if he&#39;s still human and actually stole the penis... if he just nubbed and ran, he&#39;d be an animal again and a target... In that case he&#39;d probably try to survive this round of hunting and come back afterwards, becoming someone&#39;s trophy will only delay the investigation. I&#39;ll submit this to the police, they should be here soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Police?&quot; Bill asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yessir, you basically just walked in here with your son&#39;s smoking gun... A crime has been committed and an investigation needs to be conducted... Either your son was being illegally poached and defended himself, he nubbed a guy without cause, or someone is helping him to avoid his civic duty and interfering with The Hunt. Any way you cut it, the authorities need to be involved.&quot;<br />
<br />
Several hours later the RV had been found with the clear signs of an animal attack. The screen door was ripped and barely holding onto the RV from when Jeff slammed into it and dragged Gerald through it, the discarded protest sign, the mauled water cooler... UV light showed there were a number of &quot;discharges&quot; between the RV and the road since the last rain... <br />
<br />
It was well into nighttime, a police officer went up to Bill and explained their findings thus far, &quot;At first glance it looks like there were people protesting The Hunt, and a Jockimal attacked them. Upon further investigation, certain signs imply that this may have been a Jockimal poaching trap. Furthermore, there have been no reports of nubbing victims this afternoon which is a telltale sign that the victim was doing something illegal, leading us to believe your son was defending himself or others from poachers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s great news.&quot; Bill offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even better, there appear to not be any drag marks or any significant amounts of blood so we don&#39;t think there was a murder... That&#39;s good news. Unless, the victim comes forward or circumstances otherwise change, you and your son are free to continue the hunt but afterwards, we would like for him to come down and make an official statement.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course officer.&quot;</p>
