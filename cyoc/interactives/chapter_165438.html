<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan looked himself over. This was a neat new world but he was still his growth-stunted self. He&#39;d never be a dashing space hero looking like that. Even though dashing heroes are more from 50&#39;s pulp sci-fi. But on second thought, he didn&#39;t want to be too much of a hunk because that would take a lot of work to maintain, as well as alienate his nerd friends who didn&#39;t own Chronivacs. Alienate? Hmm, now that&#39;s an idea. He could be big and tough and still be a scientific wonder to his friends. Ooh wait! No! Even better idea. He could set it on a delay and change in front of them. That would be a sight they&#39;d certainly never forget.<br />
<br />
Now he just had to design his alien form. First he went into Scan mode and uploaded his appearance to the Chronivac. The scan took five seconds and the result was displayed on his holographic screen. He checked out the presets for aliens, none of them were close to what he was looking for, so he chose the classic, naked little grey as a base and made some heavy customization. Make him buff, give him more height, maybe another set of arms, lengthen his male organ a bit and... they let you have two?! Let&#39;s try that out, and how about some fangs, and let&#39;s try a more eye-catching skin color...<br />
<br />
Dan didn&#39;t know how long he was fiddling with options, but he realized it was already afternoon. You give Daniel a new program to try out and you won&#39;t be able to pry him away! But now it&#39;s time to put it to the test. He sent an e-mail (not a text, this is a 90&#39;s future) to his small group of friends and asked them to meet up for lunch, eventually settling on McXorx Food Replicator. Where the tentacles are fresh and never frozen, natch.<br />
<br />
Back outside, Dan marveled at the results of his work. There were more species than he could imagine walking around, from almost-humanoids, reptiles, bugs taller than him, aliens with tentacles or fur or feathers or whatever else. There were no roads since all the cars were in the air,  but there were moving walkways zigzagging. He took them and followed the signs to the food court where his friends were waiting. Seemed to be still the same guys, just with shinier clothes. He sat down beside them and ordered his lunch, which took only a few seconds to replicate.<br />
<br />
He spoke up, &quot;Guess what I got in the mail.&quot;<br />
&quot;What was it?&quot; One friend with a Geordi visor replied.<br />
&quot;Ah... I don&#39;t need to say. you&#39;ll see the effects of it soon enough.&quot;<br />
In between bites, he began feeling bloated and his singlet felt tight around him. He stood up, and was very pleased to see that his chest was hardening up rapidly. So rapidly, in fact, that one of the shoulder straps snapped off, exposing a fit chest that was also changing color from white to bright purple. His hair receded into his body, leaving him bald, and his glasses cracked and shattered, before disappearing altogether. As for his arms, they built mass until they split the seams of his cool leather jacket, which was also starting to disappear off his body. The second set of arms grew in rapidly, tearing the rest of the jacket and the sides of his singlet, leaving only the shorts over his crotch. The nerd friends could only stop and stare, before one said, &quot;You finally got a Chronivac??&quot;<br />
&quot;Urgh, yes indeed, I did. Ow!&quot; His feet were painfully pinched until they shredded through the end of his boots, at which point he kicked them away and inspected his bare foot. Double the length as before with an opposed big toe.<br />
&quot;Thought those were only for the very rich?&quot; the chubby one said as he watched, transfixed.<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t think I would get one, but apparently it was a random drawing from everyone who applied. I got lucky.&quot; He looked down and saw a growing bulge in his shorts that quickly multiplied to two bulges.<br />
Another nerd with an antenna on his headband blushed and started sweating. &quot;Uh, did you remember to set your species&#39; native clothing style? Because it defaults to &#39;none&#39;.&quot;<br />
The legs of Dan&#39;s shorts split up the sides, until finally falling to the ground and disintegrating to nothing. His twin cocks twitched up and down, now exposed to the open air. &quot;I musta missed that setting... Luckily, I set nudity to &#39;common&#39; so-- erk!&quot; His face was now changing, starting with his eyes which blacked out and widened to a large size, as his nose shrinked to nothing. And finally, the fangs he wanted grew in.<br />
<br />
At Dan realized his friends weren&#39;t the only one looking. Everyone at the restaurant saw him transform into a proud and uncensored alien specimen. And he heard the snapping of holo-cameras as well. There was little point in finding clothes to wear now.</p>
