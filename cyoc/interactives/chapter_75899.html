<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Oh yea?” asked Colette.<br />
<br />
“Yea,” I said.  “Do you wanna test those new powers?”<br />
<br />
She asked, “What, you mean shape shifting?”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” I answered.  “Go and give them a good scare.”<br />
<br />
A smile slowly spread on Colette’s face.  “Yea,” she said.  “I’d like to do that.”<br />
<br />
“How dare they come into our woods?” I said in a joking manner.<br />
<br />
“So what should I become?” asked Colette.<br />
<br />
“Your choice,” I said.<br />
<br />
Colette thought for a moment.  “OK, I’ll keep it simple and become a wolf like you did,” she said.  She <br />
unbuttoned the collar on her catsuit and then unzipped it as well.  “I like this too much to ruin it,” she <br />
said as she peeled it off.  She slid it off her exquisite body and carefully stepped out of it.  She tossed it <br />
at me.  “Don’t lose that,” she teased.  “OK, here I go.”<br />
<br />
She closed her eyes in concentration.  After a few seconds, she groaned.  I could see muscles expanding and <br />
growing larger all over her body.  Then fur sprouted and thickened on her all over.  “This feels amazing,” she <br />
said.  Her voice was deeper and sounded feral.  “Whoa,” she said when she heard herself.  The nails on her <br />
hands and feet grew longer and sharpened into claws.  <br />
<br />
It seemed that she was changing into the same kind of wolf that I had become.  But as her changes continued <br />
several differences were noticeable.  Considering we were different genders there were going to be obvious <br />
differences.  Still I was surprised when I saw two additional pairs of breasts blossom on her torso.  I also <br />
saw that her hands and feet had grown larger than mine.  As her tail pushed out her stance changed.  She fell <br />
onto her hands and I realized that she meant to go on all fours rather than remain upright.  Her spine cracked <br />
and her shoulders expanded to accommodate this change.  She groaned in pain at these changes.<br />
<br />
Fortunately they didn’t last very long.  Fangs filled her mouth which changed into a muzzle.  Her ears grew <br />
pointed and shifted position to the top of her head.  She had successfully transformed into a wolf.  She <br />
looked much like a normal wolf, except that she was much larger and monstrous in appearance.  “This feels <br />
great,” she growled.  <br />
<br />
“Wow,” I said.  “Awesome.  I didn’t think you’d still be able to talk.”<br />
<br />
“Why not?” she said.  “Still need to talk to you.  By the way, I can tell you’re hard.”<br />
<br />
She was right about that.  The sight of her transforming had turned me on.  “Damn your senses,” I said.  She <br />
appeared to smile at me.  “What are you going to do?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Just watch,” she said.  She slowly walked in the direction of the two trespassers.  I decided to get a better <br />
vantage point.  With Colette’s catsuit tucked under my arm I jumped into the trees so I could have an aerial <br />
view.  Just as before, I was able to move from tree to tree without making a sound.  I stopped when I was more <br />
or less directly over the unsuspecting couple.<br />
<br />
They had finished their love making and just lay next to each other.  The sound of a branch snapping echoed in <br />
the area.  “What was that?” I heard the woman asked.<br />
<br />
“We should leave soon,” the man said.<br />
<br />
“OK,” said the woman.  They appeared ready to get dressed again.  But before they could even fully sit up, the <br />
hulking figure of Colette bounded into their sight.  They didn’t have a chance to react as Colette jumped and <br />
landed right on top of both of them and pinned them to the ground with her massive hands.  The woman instantly <br />
screamed and I quickly wished that no one would hear that scream.<br />
<br />
I couldn’t tell what Colette was doing but she just kept them pinned to the ground.  Then she took each hand <br />
and scratched both of them on the sides of their bodies.  It was deep enough to draw blood, of course, but <br />
certainly not lethal.  She got off them and run away as fast as she could.  <br />
<br />
I lingered in the trees.  For several minutes the couple did not move.  They might have fainted but I couldn’t <br />
tell for sure.  Eventually they began to move and regained their composure.  “What the fuck was that?” the <br />
woman asked.<br />
<br />
“A wolf, I think,” replied the man.  “We need to go to the hospital before we bleed to death.”  They dressed <br />
themselves and put out the fire.  I saw a large flashlight turn on.  “Come on, it’s this way,” said the man.  <br />
They walked away from the attack site as fast as they could.<br />
<br />
I was not concerned with what they might tell someone at a hospital.  There would be no wolf for anyone to <br />
come find.  Once the couple was gone I jumped down from the trees.  “Colette?” I whispered out.  I did not get <br />
a response so I started to walk toward the castle.  Every few feet I called out for Colette again.<br />
<br />
As I continued to get no response I assumed she had also gone back to the castle.  But then I suddenly found <br />
her.  She had changed back to human form and was leaning against a tree.  Her eyes were closed and her <br />
breathing was labored.  “Colette?” I said with panic.  “What’s wrong?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t…know,” she panted.  “So…weak.”<br />
<br />
“Come here,” I said.  I picked her up in my arms.  Since I was extremely worried I wished for us to be back in <br />
the bedroom chamber of the castle.  It was dark, so I wished for the candles and torches to be lit.  I put <br />
Colette down on the bed and tossed the catsuit to the side.  “Colette, are you OK?”<br />
<br />
She opened her eyes slowly.  “Chris,” she said.  Slowly she smiled and then she suddenly grabbed my wrists and <br />
threw me onto the bed.  Before I knew it she pounced on top of me.  “Was that fun or what?”<br />
<br />
“Which part?” I asked.  “Scaring and scratching those people or just scaring the hell out of me?”<br />
<br />
“Both,” she said.<br />
<br />
“An ‘A’ for the people,” I said.  “But an ‘F’ for what you just did.  ‘F’ as in ‘fuck, you scared the shit out <br />
of me,’” I explained.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, babe,” she said.  “I felt like testing you.”<br />
<br />
I shook my head.  “Never do that again.  Please.  Just…don’t do that,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Aw,” she said.  “You care.”<br />
<br />
“Of course I do,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Good,” she said.  “Now I am a little spent from changing, that is true.  But I want to do one more thing <br />
before sleep.”<br />
<br />
I asked, “What?”  She grinned at me and began to take off my pants.  “Oh, that,” I said with a smile.  We had <br />
another intense round of love-making and fell asleep next to each other.</p>
