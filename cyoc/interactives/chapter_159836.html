<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tyler, obviously, didn’t sleep at all on his first night. He curled fearfully in his bed, staring at the entrance. He was terrified that the boy would come in at night and take him away. That very thought also turned him on, and so he was stuck in this constant cycle of fear and hormones until the alarm went off.<br />
<br />
Sam and Oliver slowly began to wake up, whilst Tyler was already showered and dressed. Tyler was in the bathroom brushing his teeth, when he noticed something peculiar. On his face, just below his lips he could see what was the beginning of a patch of stubble. He looked at it perplexingly. He had never gotten facial hair before. Why now?<br />
<br />
He went back into the dorm room. Sam and Oliver were still getting up. Now Tyler knows he’s not being crazy. He saw that Oliver’s shirt was definitely smaller than it was yesterday. Between that and his pants, which had a notable bulge, Tyler noticed part of his six-pack, and a trail of hair that lead to his underwear. Sam’s arms certainly looked more toned, and his jawline looked more squared than before. They had both grown stubble and gained more hair on their arms.<br />
<br />
“Tyler, are you gonna keep that? I’d shave it if I were you.”<br />
<br />
Sam joker. His deeper voice caught Tyler off guard.<br />
<br />
“Guys, something’s going on.”<br />
“It’s not Movember-“<br />
“No, I mean you guys look a bit different.l<br />
“Different?”<br />
<br />
Oliver felt the stubble on his face as he tried pulling his shirt down.<br />
<br />
“Tyler, all guys have facial hair. It’s a natural part of growing up.”<br />
“I think it’s those flowers. Something about them is changing us.”<br />
“Tyler you’re starting to sound dumber than Ollie, which is pretty rare.”<br />
<br />
Oliver threw a pillow at Sam. The bell rang.<br />
<br />
“Shit we’re gonna be late!”<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
PSHE was most students’ favourite lesson. Not only because it’s taught by the only female teacher in the school, but also it is taught in the only air-conditioned classroom. An all-boys boarding school is a cesspit of hormones, and so Miss Dawkins was the ultimate sexual fantasy for these boys. Her tall, slim frame carried large breasts and ass, which she humbly covered up with a loose jacket and turtleneck. Even then, Tyler could see some of the boys staring at her as she would write on the chalkboard, like a lion watches it’s prey. He noticed Oliver get hard as she bent down to pick up a pencil, his trousers tenting eagerly. Sam was buried in his work. <br />
<br />
Then, the boy came in, barely fitting in the doorway.<br />
<br />
He could hear the heavy footsteps behind him, then a low voice rumbled,<br />
<br />
“Is this seat taken?”<br />
<br />
Tyler turned around. He was so close to the boy. He could smell the musk flowing from him. Tyler could only stare at those piercing blue eyes.<br />
<br />
“N-no. Y-you can have it.”<br />
“Thanks.”<br />
<br />
The boy sat down, his massive frame rubbing against Tyler’s small shoulders. The boy must’ve been 6’5” now. The memories of last night begin flooding Tyler’s brain...<br />
<br />
“Dwayne, I hope you have a good reason for being late.”<br />
<br />
Miss Dawkins said softly. She had taken off her jacket, which lay beside her desk chair. Even with the air conditioning, the abnormal weather still made the room hot. The class full of horny boys lusting over her only contributed to the sweltering heat in that room.<br />
<br />
“Sorry Miss. won’t happen again.”<br />
“Fine. Go to page 32. You need to find a partner. Tyler go with him.”<br />
“Yes Miss.”<br />
<br />
His mind raced.<br />
“His name is Dwayne. What the fuck do I do? Do I say hi now or just go into the work? I can’t just say hi that’ll be weird, what if he-“<br />
“Hi.”<br />
<br />
Tyler looked up. Dwayne was smiling.<br />
<br />
“H-hi.”<br />
<br />
Tyler couldn’t stop stuttering. He started turning red.<br />
<br />
“So what are we doing?”<br />
“We?”<br />
“Yeah, what’s on page 32?”<br />
“Oh r-right, sorry I-“<br />
<br />
He could feel Dwayne’s body heat on his skin. He was inches away from him. He could see the new uniform clinging tightly onto his large frame. He saw the outline of Dwayne’s giant pecs and abs through his shirt. He could feel his huge leg rub against his. He dared not to look any further. Tyler was already hiding his boner with his notebook. Dwayne’s long, deep breathes deafened him, and the intense smell of his manly musk overpowered all of the other senses. Tyler focused hard on not losing it again. He needed to stay focused.<br />
<br />
“We’re learning about how to stay healthy. Miss asked us to write down ways to keep fit.”<br />
“Well, exercise I guess, and eating well...”<br />
<br />
Dwayne carried on, but Tyler wasn’t focused. He realised that the boy doesn’t remember last night, or if he did, he certainly didn’t see Tyler in the window. He almost did a long sigh of relief, but then the deep voice snapped him back into reality.<br />
<br />
“...if you want to be super strong for example you gotta eat a lot, or eat well.”<br />
“How much do you eat?”<br />
<br />
There was a silence between them. Tyler started to sweat. He interjected.<br />
<br />
“Urgh I mean if you wanted to be strong what would you eat?”<br />
<br />
Dwayne smiled.<br />
<br />
“Well personally I don’t eat a lot. I just eat well. Plant-based mainly. Remember, quantity doesn’t always mean quality.”<br />
<br />
The bell rang, but no one was leaving. Who would want to leave Miss Dawkins? Dwayne however, packed up his things. Before he left, he turned back to Tyler.<br />
<br />
“Nice to meet you, what was your name?”<br />
“T-Tyler.”<br />
“Tyler. See you around.”<br />
<br />
He patted Tyler on the back and left. Tyler could only sit in shock. He turned and noticed that Sam had also left, but Oliver was still sitting, his hands in his trousers. Tyler left.</p>
