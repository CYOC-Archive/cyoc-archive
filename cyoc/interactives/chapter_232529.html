<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You came back to consciousness to see Ember peering down at you. You realised you were on the floor. Somehow you could see even though you knew that as a <b class="highlight">bra</b>ssiere you did not have eyes. You could somehow see straight up and from the corner of your vision could detect black material which you assumed were your cups.<br />
<br />
Ember bent down and picked you up. “Wow! That was amazing! You have been absorbed into my <b class="highlight">bra</b>! I assume you can hear me as I could hear when I was a doll, but can you see?”<br />
<br />
Of course, you had no way of replying. You were completely inanimate. <br />
<br />
“Well I guess I put you on and head to the mall” Ember said out aloud as she held you in front of her face. You were starting to orientate yourself. It seemed you could only look in one direction and from one part of yourself. Fortunately, at that moment that part was pointed towards Ember. She looked happy.<br />
<br />
She then tossed you down on a soft surface, from the colour of the material you guessed it was your bedspread.<br />
<br />
Next thing you knew you were picked up again and felt your body being wrapped around Ember. She had taken off her T-shirt and was putting you on. You could feel her flesh against you. You could feel yourself being slightly stretched as she reached around and connected your clips. Whilst this was happening you line of sight was directly to your closed bedroom door.<br />
<br />
You felt her fingers adjusting you slightly then you were twisted quite quickly around her torso and your straps pulled up to her shoulders. Suddenly your cups were filled with her fleshy <b class="highlight">breasts</b>. It felt incredibly comfortable to be hugging Ember so tightly.<br />
<br />
When you were twisted around you were finally looking at the mirror in your room. In the reflection you saw Ember putting on her <b class="highlight">bra</b>. It was incredible to think that <b class="highlight">bra</b> was you. <br />
<br />
“So what do you think? Can you see yourself? Do you feel comfortable?” she asked.<br />
<br />
You couldn’t reply but if you could have, it would have been with two ‘Yes’s’ <br />
<br />
“You feel nice to me” Ember said as she gently stroked your cups that were containing her <b class="highlight">breasts</b>. She posed in front of the mirror long enough for you to orientate yourself. You realised you were seeing through the small black bow, or was it a flower, positioned at the front of the <b class="highlight">bra</b> between your cups. <br />
<br />
All too quickly though, Ember turned away from the mirror and faced your bed whilst saying “Well if I’m going to go shopping I had better hurry. I’ve less than two hours before you become human again”<br />
<br />
You recognised you had not actually told Ember that you had made the duration 3 hours instead of the 2 she had suggested. It was too late to tell her now. <br />
<br />
You could only watch as she leant over your bed and picked up her black T-shirt and pulled it on, feeling the material squeezing over yourself and making you essentially blind. You could no longer see anything. You could still hear her though as she apparently checked herself in the mirror and said “That looks better. Ready to head out my beautiful <b class="highlight">bra</b>?”<br />
<br />
For most of the next two hours you remained blind. Ember kept up a running commentary about what she was doing, so you knew when you exited your house and could feel your cups encasing Ember’s <b class="highlight">breasts</b> sway as she walked the short distance to the mall. It felt highly erotic but you were upset that you could not see anything.<br />
<br />
According to Ember’s commentary you visited 3 shoe shops looking for shoes. She posed the question to you at one stage “So what do you think my beautiful <b class="highlight">bra</b>. These shoes or the heels from the last store?”<br />
<br />
Fortunately, she didn’t expect a reply because you couldn’t give one. You had not even seen the shoes she was talking about. All you knew was that she was looking for pale pink shoes to wear to her cousin’s wedding. You were starting to realise that choosing to be a <b class="highlight">bra</b> was perhaps a mistake. Being worn felt great but you wished she would remove that T-shirt.<br />
<br />
She ended up returning to the second store and purchased the earlier mentioned heels. Only after that were you temporarily released from blindness when Ember decided to try on several tops in a boutique. You caught glimpses of yourself and Ember in a dressing room mirror as she tried on two different tops. However once the tops were buttoned up your vision was obscured once more. And of course you could not answer her question “Which top you prefer” <br />
<br />
To make matters worse at one stage Ember apparently came across her friend Anna. You could hear her showing her purchases to Anna. They even went to a coffee shop and had a drink, chatting about boys, including yourself. You heard Anna say about yourself. “Do you still have a crush on that nerd? He’s never going to ask you out. All he thinks about are gadgets. Time to look elsewhere my friend”<br />
<br />
At least Ember defended you “He’s really nice. If you knew him better you would like him”<br />
<br />
Eventually Ember began the walk back to your house. You should have concocted a story to tell your mother as to why Ember was calling back after 9pm at night. Ember just said to your mother when she answered the door that “I left something in Eric’s room”<br />
<br />
You heard your mother reply “I think he’s asleep. I haven’t seen him since dinner” <br />
<br />
Ember replied. “He’s probably playing video games and has his head phones on. I’ll go in and get what I need”<br />
<br />
Fortunately, your mother knew Ember and allowed her entry.</p>
