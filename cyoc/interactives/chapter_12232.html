<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt felt slightly dizzy as he made his way out of Pete's house, as if the blood was rushing through his body away from his head. He placed his hand on the stair rail and shook his head like a dog in an attempt to remove the faintness. A faint scent tickled at his nose; something back in the basement. Matt looked about inquisitively, sniffing gingerly at the air, as it trying to locate the smell. Within a few seconds though, sure enough, he had found the source. Lying on the floor beneath the couch was a pair of grey briefs that belonged to...Matt paused and breathed in the aroma...<br />
&quot;Pete...&quot; Matt murmured softly. He could smell the same scent from the briefs coming from outside the house, becoming gradually lighter and lighter on the air. Matt tossed the briefs aside and ran out the front door, lusting after the source.<br />
<br />
Pete, Greg and Carl had reached a fork in the road. The streets in front of them seemed to split further and further apart as they continued off in their own directions. Pete turned to Greg and Carl.<br />
&quot;Well, look's like we should...&quot;<br />
&quot;Split up?&quot; Carl finished. Pete smiled slightly.<br />
&quot;Er, yeah. Let's just each take a road and we'll part for now, and see if we meet up further along,&quot; Pete explained to the others.<br />
&quot;I guess...&quot; said Greg as he moved to the left most street, &quot;I'll take this street here.&quot;<br />
&quot;Shotgun the middle one!&quot; Carl shouted quickly. Pete rolled his eyes.<br />
&quot;Fine, I get the righthand one then,&quot; Pete said. &quot;You all know what you have to do? Keep an eye out for those damn fags...&quot; Greg and Carl nodded. Pete paused, noticing Greg shivering slightly in the cool night air.<br />
&quot;Here mate, take my parka; I'm warm as hell in it...&quot; Pete offered, sliding the large jacket off his shoulders and passing it to Greg. Greg initially shook his head in refusal, but a moment later he gave in and took it.<br />
&quot;Thanks Pete,&quot; Greg replied.<br />
&quot;No problem. Can't have any of my men sick on me now, can I?&quot; Pete said, patting Greg roughly on the back. <br />
&quot;Well, let's go then!&quot; Pete concluded as they all set off down their separate roads.<br />
<br />
Several minutes later, Matt arrived at the same intersection in a half jog, still following the trail of smells to his prey. He stopped abruptly and looked down each street, but the scent seemed to be coming from more than one direction. Giving it a minutes thought, Matt decided that he'd chase after the sweatier, more dense aroma of Pete. It seemed to be the heaviest source of the smell...<br />
<br />
Greg paused to take a look around. Something tingled in his nose; he looked down and realised that it was Pete's sweat soaked parka. <br />
&quot;Eurgh!&quot; he groaned slightly, but reasoned that he'd have to put up with it if he didn't want to catch a cold. He dried his arm pits with the inside of the jacket a little, but it seemed to do nothing. Giving up, Greg started off again, but heard someone behind him calling loudly. Greg tensed up; was it a Speedo Fag?<br />
<br />
Matt ran down the street, he could smell it now, it was right in front of him...he figured he'd be able to take him out by himself. <br />
&quot;Pete!!!&quot; Matt called softly into the night. &quot;Pete....!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Matt? Is that you?&quot; Greg asked the figure appearing through the shadows.<br />
&quot;Huh? Greg? Where's Pete?&quot; the voice of Matt replied confusedly.<br />
&quot;Greg? Oh, he went off down another road. It's just me here,&quot; Greg replied. Matt leant across and sniffed at Pete's jacket.<br />
&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Greg blushed, &quot;This is Pete's. Reeks, doesn't it?&quot;<br />
Matt nodded slightly.<br />
&quot;So, want to tag along with me for a bit?&quot; Greg asked. Matt thought for a moment, and then nodded.<br />
&quot;Yeah, it'll be a lot safer. You can't be too careful...&quot; Matt added with a laugh. Greg laughed too, and then they set off again.<br />
<br />
Five or so minutes later, Greg and Matt walked pass an alley leading between the street and the beach, shadows condensing the very air into a thick black.<br />
&quot;Did you hear that?&quot; Matt whispered.<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Greg asked.<br />
&quot;Shhhh!!!&quot; Matt hissed back and fell silent, as if straining to hear something. &quot;I think I hear something coming from down this alley...&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Greg asked, peering down through the darkness warily.<br />
&quot;C'mon, let's go down it together and check it out...&quot; Matt replied quietly. Greg swallowed down the little fear he had and nodded.<br />
&quot;Right, but be careful. You remember what Pete said about the Speedo Fags? How they just bit into that guy and he became one of them?&quot; Greg murmured back as they tip toed down the alley silently.<br />
&quot;Mmm hmm...&quot; Matt murmured back.<br />
&quot;Jeez, imagine suddenly just not being in control of your lust for men. Er, not that I'd lust for men!&quot; Greg laughed embarrasedly at himself.<br />
&quot;Yeah...awful...&quot; Matt replied dreamily. Greg felt Matt's hand slide onto his shoulder for support. It comforted him a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still; there'd be some fun to it once you look past the raging...sexual...desire...&quot; Matt said slowly. Greg shrugged.<br />
&quot;What? The raging erection and bulging muscles? No thanks...&quot; Greg muttered back with a laugh. Matt's grip on his shoulder tightened slightly. Greg glanced behind him at Matt and noticed him using his free hand to draw his blue singlet over his head. It slid over his chest slowly, passing gently over his abs and pecs.<br />
&quot;Er, what the hell are you doing?&quot; Greg asked as Matt tossed the singlet into a corner of the alley.<br />
&quot;Shhh...We're about to get our prey...&quot; Matt hissed as he began fingering about his zipper. Greg had no idea what Matt was talking about, but the way he said it sounded so exciting. One thing struck him as odd though...<br />
&quot;Prey?&quot; Greg asked Matt, pausing suddenly. &quot;What do you...oh!&quot; he called out as something shoved him down to the dirt floor of the alley.<br />
&quot;Matt! Matt!&quot; Greg half shouted as the assailant took hold of his arms and held them tightly behind his back, &quot;Help me!&quot;<br />
&quot;Shhh...&quot; Matt whispered.<br />
&quot;Matt? What the hell are you doing!?!?!&quot; Greg asked fearfully.<br />
&quot;I told you something was in the alley; there were two Speedo Fags...well, technically one, but that'll change in a sec...&quot; Matt whispered as he licked his lips.<br />
&quot;Matt, please, stop kidding around!&quot; Greg moaned, his voice cracking as he squirmed under his friend's strong hold.<br />
&quot;It'll be a lot smoother if you'd just give in. It'll be fun, and besides, it's not as if you have a choice otherwise. If you fight it, it will only hurt. Even now, it's slowly sifting through you...changing you...&quot; Matt spoke in a hushed voice. Greg broke into a sweat. He could feel the blood pumping vigorously in his ears. As he struggled against Matt's attempts to bite him, Greg felt like his muscles were beginning to tear apart.<br />
&quot;It hurts...&quot; he moaned painfully as he loosened his body.<br />
&quot;Let me see to that...&quot; Matt smiled as he tugged the parka off Greg's back. Then, he draped his arms across Greg's back, comforting Greg softly.<br />
&quot;Please...just...finish it...get it over with...&quot; Greg whispered, giving in to Matt's welcoming touch.<br />
&quot;'Atta boy...&quot; Matt smiled as he loosened his grip on Greg. Pushing through his chest pains, Greg managed to raise himself to an upright position and nodded for Matt to continue.<br />
&quot;What the hell...go ahead...&quot; Greg muttered as he groped at Matt's chiselled chest and lead his warm body over to him.<br />
Matt placed a hand on the waist of his shorts and tore them down, revealing the trademark red Speedo that Pete had told Greg about. Greg forced a smile and held his chin up slightly, allowing Matt to ease his head in. Greg felt Matt's warm breath brush against the skin on his neck. He shivered slightly in anticipation. A second passed. Then another. Then Greg felt the soothing touch of Matt's mouth as it closed on his neck.<br />
<br />
Greg moaned as his penis immediately became erect. He placed one hand behind him on the dirt to steady himself, and he lifted the other to caress his hand over Matt's soft hair, gently pushing at him to bite harder. As Matt did, Greg's shorts became tighter. For what felt like an hour, Matt continued to bite into Greg's neck as he embraced the change. Finally, Matt sat back contented. However, it was Greg's turn to attack now...he wrapped his muscular arms around Matt's back and held him close until their lips were just an inch away. Matt curled his lip slightly like a snarl to which Greg smiled slyly as his hands squeezed Matt's tight Speedo-clad ass. Greg sealed his mouth over Matt's; their tongues bursting into each other's mouths. As Matt continued to kiss Greg, a new pain took hold over Greg; his clothes were tightening against his slowly growing muscles. He pawed gently at Matt's chest who smiled back and helped slide the tight singlet over Greg's arms. Then, Greg placed a hand on Matt to hold him back, then took both his hands and put them on the zipper of his shorts. This was it...Greg tensed up and gripped the shorts tightly on either side of the zipper and tore the front of the shorts wide apart, his own newly created Speedo coming into view with his throbbing penis etched against the front. Matt sniffed at Greg's crotch, as Greg spread his legs apart to gaze at himself. Matt slowly let his hands slide across Greg's smooth hairless thighs towards Greg's penis...edging closer...and closer...Matt felt the soft spandex against his fingers as Greg howled in pleasure; the call of the new Speedo Fag.</p>
