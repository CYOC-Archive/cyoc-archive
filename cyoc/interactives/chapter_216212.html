<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A loud noise, and Jeff&#39;s human mind reasserted itself long enough for her to grasp the simple word &quot;Gun&quot;. Associating it with danger, her animal instincts took over and she turned tail, even as sporadically more of the loud noises were heard and a harsh odour invaded her nose. Fleeing as fast as her four legs would carry her, Jeff was able to tell easily where to go in the dark as she raced away from the sounds and offensive smell.<br />
<br />
Not wanting anything to do with a two-legged, she had originally been chased by another creature her human mind lacked the word to give name to. Failing comprehend the thing was what she might have at one time recognised as a coyote, she fled from it when it was clear it wasn&#39;t something she would be able to, or wanted to, take on. Her flight taking her out of her territory and into an open area, she&#39;d slowed long enough to discern the danger had passed and she wasn’t being pursued. Crouching low to make herself less of a target, she remained tense as she scanned the surrounding area, and whipped her head about when a acrid smell invaded her nose, and she heard the sound of a two-legged being, trying to be quiet, draw closer.<br />
<br />
Her instincts had again saved her, and failing to recall the commands she&#39;d given the computer programme which had turned her into what she now was, Jeff had fled, sure she was about to cease to be. Chased by the loud noises the part of her which was still human grasped what they came from, she fled the open area, back into the seclusion she was familiar with, and her senses and instincts assured her was were it was safe. Slowing after some time, she slowed to sniff at some things, dig up some tasty morsels, all whilst working her way back into the area she&#39;d marked as her own. Heading not to her first den, wanting to keep anything which might still be after her, be it the two-legged with the loud noise or the four-legged which had chased her from her territory, she instead made her way to and into a second burrow she&#39;d dug out.<br />
<br />
Roots hung down, and she paused long enough to sniff at them before she lay down. Her mind a jumbled mess of unintelligible nonsense from the part of her still human and what passed for thoughts and understanding from the dominate animal side, Jeff yawned and adjusted herself so her head rested on her tail. Gazing toward the entrance, which she&#39;d dug out so it was barely large enough to allow her passage, she was still on guard should anything else try to come through it. Finding herself going back to the question of something forgotten, and still not able to sort out what, the part of her still human wondered how long she&#39;d been a fox. Finding she had no comprehension for the advance of time, and bothered by the narrow escape she&#39;d experienced, Jeff took a moment to fully a grasp what happened before she asked herself, &quot;Mistake?&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure how to answer this, her mind leapt to when she&#39;d turned herself into a fox and the way she was somehow certain there wouldn&#39;t be any problems. Not sure how she knew this, was equally confusing how she understood the way she live life as a vixen, then go back to being what she&#39;d been before. Struggling to recall what it was she&#39;d been, thinking she might have been a two-legged, she was able to slowly work out everything hadn&#39;t been how she guessed. She hadn&#39;t taken into account how much it hindered her to have the part of her human so regressed, the way things she was supposed to know and understand seemed either no longer important or down right difficult grasp or retain, the danger she was often in and the fear which often gripped and ruled a lot of what she did, as well as the nagging sensation she&#39;d forgotten something important.<br />
<br />
Night ticking by as she worked her way through all this, and often failing to remember a lot of it, as it wasn&#39;t really important to what she now was, Jeff crawled out of the burrow eventually. Striking out to hunt, she again asked herself, &quot;Mistake?&quot; but found if what had done was wrong, she still wasn&#39;t sure.<br />
<br />
By the time she reached another one of her dens, light had started to creep into the sky. Entering, she curled up into a tight ball with her tail pressed tight against her body, but she didn&#39;t go to sleep. Instead, she tried to let let her human mind come forward and become dominant. Finding it hard, as her animal mind fought against it, she did manage somewhat after some time. Going back over what she&#39;d come up with previously, with some difficulty, and missing some things, it took Jeff a bit before she was able to form the idea, &quot;Go home? Stop vixen? Be what before?&quot;<br />
<br />
An itch momentarily distracted her, and she used one of her hind paws to address the situation. When it was soothed, she didn&#39;t stop, and still trying to work out whether to remain as she was or go back to what she was, Jeff started to use her teeth and paws to groom herself, paying particular attention to specific areas, like the area between her toes, her vulva, her tail and a spot or two on her back legs, as she did so. Finished, the part of her still human wasn’t sure it had an answer, and curling up so her head was again resting on her tail, Jeff squinted and looked toward the opening which led in and out of the den.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be vixen. Give chance. If bad, wrong, go back,&quot; she decided as she tried to work out how long she should remain so, but unable to fathom any sort of time measurement, let along understand she&#39;d only been a fox for three days, she settled on letting her instincts guide her.<br />
<br />
Her human mind giving way to the animal, Jeff yawned. Still not ready to sleep, she stood, sniffed at a few things and crawled outside. Moving a fair bit away, she stopped as she picked up a sent carried by the wind. Finding she was able to tell it was another of her kind, but not the same as herself, she stiffened for a moment, on alert. Detecting it might be the one she&#39;d become aware of before, her human side gave full way to her animal. What she was now, a vixen red fox, completely in control, she headed in the direction of the male, no longer finding it odd she may actually be attracted to the opposite sex.</p>
