<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For the second morning in a row, Luke woke up in Gio&#39;s apartment. They had slept in together but Luke&#39;s phone was ringing. He dug it out of his pants pocket, discarded on the floor and looked at the screen, eyes a bit wide. It was Wilkins. Was he missing work? No.. it was Saturday.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir?&quot; He answered the phone, trying to ignore the now awake Gio kissing the back of his neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was going to let you wait to start till Monday, but something came up and I need to fly out for a business trip tonight. I need you to swing by my dry cleaner and pick up my suits then drop them off at my house. My wife is on a trip and my son isn&#39;t picking up his phone. Sorry about this, Luke.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, can do.&quot; Luke said, biting his lip a little as Gio wrapped a hand around his cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll text you the addresses. Consider this me owing you a favor.&quot; Wilkins hung up. Gio was seemingly having fun riling up Luke while he tried to talk on the phone, but sighed softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounded important.&quot; He wasn&#39;t stopping in jerking Luke off, though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I, uh, I just need to do an errand for my boss.&quot; Though Luke made no effort to break away from having his cock stroked. Even as his phone dinged with the promised text. Surely it could wait a few minutes, Luke rolled onto his back and Gio wrapped his mouth around Luke&#39;s cock. He could get used to waking up like this.<br />
<br />
An hour later, he was showered, picked up the dry cleaning, and was on the way to his boss&#39; house. The place he pulled up in front of was almost a small mansion. The yard was immaculate and a convertible sat in the driveway. Luke&#39;s beat up car definitely did not belong but with the raise he was getting, maybe soon he could get something better.<br />
<br />
He grabbed the dry cleaning out of the back of the car and went up to the front door. Wilkins had told him where to find a hidden key, which he found in short order and stepped inside. The inside was as well kept and nice as it appeared from the outside, a little posh in the furniture for Luke&#39;s taste but it felt like it oozed wealth.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can hang it in the front closet.&quot; Came a voice as Luke was looking around for a spot to put the clothes. He looked up and leaning against the railing was a teenager, older, maybe eighteen or nineteen, waering only a pair of mesh shorts. Wilkins&#39; son, there was no mistaking it. He looked like a younger version of the man. Stockily built, but muscular without his fathers softening from age. The he definitely had his father&#39;s hairiness, his pecs were covered in a dusting of black hair even at his age. He was a good looking young man, clean shaven, the black hair on his head in a buzz cut. &quot;You must be Tod&#39;s replacement.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d be me.&quot; Luke said as he opened the closet door and hung the dry cleaning in there. He heard some thumps on the stairs and turned around only to come eye to eye with his boss&#39; son. They were about the same height, though Wilkins junior was actually wider than him, having made Luke think he was shorter. God, the kid must be some sort of football star the way he was built.<br />
<br />
&quot;My dad&#39;s got certain tastes, that&#39;s for sure. I&#39;m Daniel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Luke.&quot; He eyed the door and Daniel laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;My dad likes to think I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, I know he bangs his assistants. It&#39;s cool. I banged Tod, too, as a going away present.&quot; Daniel winked and laughed as he backed off a few steps. What was up with this kid? Despite himself, Luke found his cock plumping in his pants. This young jock was everything Luke wished he had been in high school and then.. he wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, nice to meet you then.&quot; And Luke held out his hand. Daniel took it and gave it a shake. In that moment, he decided to completely swap bodies with Daniel. He didn&#39;t know how the bracelet might alter things, but he wanted to know what it was like to be this hot jock.<br />
<br />
In moments Luke felt his shoulders widening and his already impressive physique hardening. His shirt melted away as his jeans shifted into mesh shorts. His chest tickling as his chest hair reduced in thickness, the years winding back as his complexion lightened slightly. Though it would grow back in if Wilkins senior was any hint.<br />
<br />
The opposite change happened to Daniel right in front of his eyes, their hands still locked together. He got a little leaner, complexion darkening. He watched as Daniel&#39;s face shifted into the one he saw in the mirror this morning, stubble growing in as his black hair grew a little longer. He only had a moment to see the hair growing in on his chest before the shirt Luke had been wearing appeared on Daniel&#39;s torso. He also caught sight of his bulge growing into Luke&#39;s monster before his shorts shifted into jeans.<br />
<br />
Right, he wanted to keep that. So he quickly copied his old body&#39;s cock onto the body of the young stud he was now wearing. He felt it swelling in his shorts, the now familiar weight of it dropping into place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I should get going.&quot; Daniel picked his phone out of his pocket, letting his boss know where he left the dry cleaning. &quot;I&#39;ll see you around, Daniel.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke blinked as his old body headed to the door and left. He had worked hard on that body.. but.. at least he knew where it was. But it also seemed to have walked off with his life. He felt a moment of panic and looked down at his wrist. The bracelet was still there where it had been since he put it on. This just must be how it handles body swaps. He could remember his old life but.. Yes, there it was. Daniel&#39;s memories. Football, high school, he was a senior, eighteen. And he really had slept with his dad&#39;s previous assistant Tod last week. Holy crap.<br />
<br />
It couldn&#39;t hurt to stay in this body for a bit, could it? He was sure he could find an opportunity to switch back if he wanted.</p>
