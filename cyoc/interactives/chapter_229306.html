<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;It can&#39;t be,&quot; Winery stammered. &quot;How is he alive?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Annie&#39;s friends gawked at Villar. Four years ago, they had been children when they were attacked by the behemoth. The experience landed Mia and Zack in the hospital, while sending the others into hiding.  The creatures immeasurable strength had frightened their parents to the point that Winery, Pryyha, and Drake were almost secluded in their realms with their parents for good. Now facing a creature that had caused so much emotional harm, left the teens shaken. Zack now paused, sniffing the air before growling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Voids!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mia turned, watching as Zack began to change. The boy now began to grow larger, black fur covering his body as his muscles swelled. In seconds a 7 foot tall werewolf stood, his mouth foaming as he snarled where he suspect the Voids were. &quot;Mia there are Voids,&quot; he howled. Mia was still in shock, the young witch looking between Villar and the shadows. The teen was well aware of the horrid nature of both Villar and the Voids. To this day she still had nightmares. It felt as if she was living through a nightmare now, her mind racing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mia!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mia turned, seeing Annie&#39;s mother rushing to her side. Gazing at the young woman puzzled the young witch. Kellies hair was completely white, the honey color completely washed away as she held a staff in her hand. &quot;Ms. Pendragon?&quot; Kellie furrowed her brow, glaring at Villar as both Jack and Akira now came to her side. &quot;Take Annie and go,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about him,&quot; Mia asked, pointing to Villar. It was Akira who now placed a comforting hand on the teens shoulder. The kitsune dressed for battle, sporting his traditional dark blue samauri robes. &quot;We shall take care of him,&quot; he said softly. &quot;The park is in danger of being overrun. Kellie amd Jack have called for others from the other timeline. It is best you escape with the others.&quot; Mia shook herself from her stupor, glowering at the kitsune.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not going to just run off,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I&#39;ve fought Voids before, I&#39;m not going to let them hurt any innocent people.&quot; Without another word, Mia now bolted away, leaving her familiar Rexie befuddled. Looking down at the white cat, Akira sighed. &quot;Keep her safe Rexie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was going to tell you the same thing,&quot; the cat grumbled. Rexie sighed, gazing up at the kitsune in concern. &quot;Don&#39;t get yourself killed and good luck.&quot; Akira nodded, watching the teens disappear into the night. He had confidence they would be okay against the Voids. Villar though was a completely different entity. Turning to Jack and Kellie, he could see the young warlock and sorceress preparing spells. Their eyes now glowed as they prepared to defend the park.<br />
<br />
As Kellie and Jack attacked, Akira darted forward, useing his speed to slash the titan across his extremities. When Villar was defeated before, it had taken the combined strength of Katie, Merlin, and several future wizards. They did not have that luxury this time. All they could hope for was that their combined efforts could drive the titan off. Dodging a powerful blast from Villar, Akira now released a spell of his own, striking the titan point blank before delivering a devastating slash across his torso. Villar grunted, staggering slightly as he tried to swat Akira away.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s healing slower than last time,&quot; Kellie exclaimed as she now unleashed a powerful blast on raw magic. Jack nodded, his eyes glowing a sickly green as he unleashed a pillar of hellfire upon the titan. Villar grunted, sinking to one knee as he glared at his attackers. It was odd for Villar, so rarely had he felt pain that the sensation caught him by surprise. He would make sure Kellie, Jack and Akira suffered for this.<br />
<br />
With a roar, Villar sprinted forward, connecting with a thunderous punch that sent Kellie soaring into an adjacent building. Turning, he now glared at Jack noting the warlock was now attempting to summon forth a portal to the demon realm in an attempt to drag Villar into hell. Instead, Villar unleashed a powerful blast, knocking Jack to the ground. Jack was now vulnerable, Villar now looking to finish him off.<br />
<br />
Much to Villars surprise, Akira now sprang in front of Jack, deflecting the spell. &quot;You&quot; Villar growled. Akira furrowed his brow, attacking with spell and sword as he tried to drive the titan back. The kitsune was determined, hoping to finally best this creature.<br />
<br />
Villar grinned, catching Akiras arm. The titan now found himself gazing into the kitsunes startled face, his vulpine features twisting in horror. Obviously the kitsune hadn’t expected  Villar to move that fast and now he would face the consequences. With a hell Villar now slammed Akira to the ground like a ragdoll before unleashing a point blank blast of raw magic into the kitsunes body.<br />
<br />
Kellie and Jack gasped, watching as Akiras bidybwas illuminated by the blast. The two wizards gazed at the limo five tails body, a sinister smile cracking across Villars face. &quot;Is this the best you have to offer,&quot; he snarled. Kellie and Jack gulped, their vision trained on Akira. It was impossible to tell if the kitsune was even alive. Akiras clothing was tattered, his orange fur coated in soot. The acrid smell of burnt fur stinging their nostrils.<br />
<br />
&quot;Papa?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack and Kellie turned, their hearts dropping as they stared at the white kit standing a short distance away. Somehow Sachiko, Akiras daughter, had arrived at the park. Jack and Kellie couldn&#39;t be sure how, perhaps she had followed her mother Ayami. When Kellie had discovered the Voids were attacking she summoned as many allies as possible, which included the angel Ayami.  Now though, Kellie was beginning to regret that decision as Sachiko stared at the limp body of her father.<br />
<br />
Villar chuckled, taunting the young kit. Tears now began to stream down the child&#39;s cheeks, matting her white fur. The child&#39;s eyes wide and sad. For a moment it looked as if Sachiko would turn and run. Instead, Kellie saw her eyes glow a soft blue, a scowl forming on her face. <br />
<br />
Villar paused, feeling this kits power radiate outwards. How was this possible? The kit appeared to be around 8 years old, her body thin and girlish. True, kitaune aged differently but a kitsune this young shouldn&#39;t have this kind of power. Grimacing, Villar tried to brace himself, surprised as the girl now opened a portal behind him. With a yell, Sachiko now released a concussion wave, pushing Villar through the portal before sealing it. As the portal closed, Sachiko sunk to her knees, softly crying before crawling towards her father. <br />
<br />
Jack and Kellie watched as thw girl cradled her father&#39;s body, amazingly Akira was alive but he was hurt badly. The two now noticing the kitaunes chest rise and fall in shallow, ragged breaths. They would need to get Akira medical attention and despite having banished Villar, the fight was far from over.</p>
