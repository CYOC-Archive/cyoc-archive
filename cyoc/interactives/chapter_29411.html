<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>"I'm sure it was around here somewhere." Derek had been driving around downtown for almost a half-hour trying to find the store. He was positive it was next to the flower shop on Sixth Street, but he had driven by that shop four times and saw nothing but an empty alley where he expected the store to be.
<P>He finally decided to give up, worrying even more about Sonya. Were her cravings going to continue forever? Would she keep growing until she couldn't even move? Regardless, if she needed food she needed food. He stopped by the grocery store on his way back to her house just in case she was feeling the unstoppable hunger again.
<P>He rung Sonya's doorbell, but there was no answer. The door was unlocked, so he let himself in and carried the groceries into the kitchen. "Sonya? I'm back," he called. "Sonya?"
<P>He heard snoring coming from the living room, and when he poked his head in his eyes met with an even more pig-like Sonya.
<P>The most obvious thing was her chest. The enormous pot belly she had acquired was reduced to a paunch. Apparently her body had already processed the food and spread it across her features, giving her a build that was slightly more bulky than before. Her shirt had gotten tighter than ever, still stained with food, but what was underneath it was the most surprising. As if four breasts weren't enough, there were two brand new rows gracing her figure, all eight the same plump size. The final row, however, was too low on her torso to be covered by her shirt, and so they hung free, displaying their large nipples.
<P>At the sight of this, Derek felt something in his pants begin to stir as he approached the strange new girl lying on the sofa. He knelt in front of her, since there was no more room on the cushions. He saw one arm drooping off the couch and took its hand in his. It was warm and soft. He noted that it now only sported two thick fingers and a thumb, ending in deep black fingernails. Her skin had turned a distinct pink color. Her face was rounder, with cute chubby cheeks and a little pig snout. Her pointed ears had grown even larger than before. They were so big they had folded over.
<P>He stared at Sonya for a long time. As he clutched her hand and listened to her quiet piggish snores he lost himself in her new form. It was the same girl he had fallen in love with long ago, and in this moment Derek realized that no matter what form she took, Sonya would never lose her beauty.
<P>She woke with a few loud snorts. Her drowsy eyes found his. "Did you...?" she asked faintly.
<P>It took a few seconds for Derek to pull out of his daydreaming. "I'm sorry," Derek said. "I couldn't find the store. It's like it was never there."
<P>Sonya let out a long breath and Derek felt her hand tighten around his. Then her eyes widened and she let go. She shifted around on the couch, trying to sit up but finding it quite a chore. Derek got to his feet and offered his arms for support. Together they were able to right Sonya's body, although she didn't risk standing up just yet. She just sat on the couch, rubbing her slightly protruding belly with her large hands.
<P>"Do you feel hungry again? I got food for you."
<P>"No," Sonya said nervously. "That's just it. I'm not hungry." Her face lit up and those chubby cheeks Derek admired turned a bright red. Somehow she found the energy to thrust herself off the couch and stand in front of Derek, taking his hands in hers once more. "I'm not hungry! It's over!"
<P>The lovers embraced tightly, both immediately realizing how unusual it felt with Sonya's new body but not caring enough to stop. Neither said anything for fear of spoiling the moment. When they finally let go, Derek asked "Are you sure you're okay?"
<P>"Well," Sonya said, looking over her body. "I've gained a pig's face, six breasts, God knows how many pounds, and I'll never be able to high-five anyone ever again."
<P>"If it helps," Derek said, unable to take his eyes off her, "You still look amazing."
<P>"I know," she smiled, glancing down at his pants. "I could feel it."
<P>Derek let out an embarrassed laugh while Sonya regarded her messy shirt. "Ugh. What a slob I am. And now some of it's on your shirt, too. Come on, let's clean each other up."</p>
