<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen&#39;s normal memories felt a bit nervous about what this next part would entail, but her slob memories kicked in again as she watched her mother waddle over to a nearby flatscreen and turned it on. What came on caused Jen to double-take. It appeared to be the normal morning news program, but it was the anchor on screen that made her realize her incredible situation. The lady on screen was dressed in ill-fitting, unwashed business attire and grease coated a good portion of her face. She appeared to be in the same weight class as her mother, had her filthy hair tied in a sloppy bun, and a pimple where a beauty mark would normally belong.<br />
It dawned on her what sort of world Kyle had dumped her into. She was in a world where everyone was a fat slob. Did he intend to humiliate her by doing this? Gross her out? Make her feel disoriented and alone?<br />
Joke&#39;s on him, because Jennifer has twin sets of memories to help her survive this crapsack paradise! How or why didn&#39;t matter, so long as she could survive long enough to figure out a way to get him back.<br />
She watched the lady on screen finish her statement about a declining food shortage, belching a couple times in between words.<br />
&quot;Alright folks,&quot; the anchor said, a warm smile curling on her lips, &quot;up next we have our- *BEEEAAALLCH!* regularly scheduled morning relief for those of you at home who couldn&#39;t manage to go in bed. Take it away Lorain.&quot;<br />
The screen cut to another obese woman, this one a bit younger and only about as big as Jennifer. Her disheveled hair was blonde and pulled back into a ponytail with an old scrunchie. She was dressed in only her dirty underwear, consisting of a tight bra and thick panties. Her panties especially were absolutely filthy, stained brown and yellow from god knows how much use.<br />
&quot;Good morning everyone!&quot; she cheered for the television audience. For a fat slob, she had an undeniable energy to her, &quot;My name is Lorain Lumpshit and I&#39;ll be your instructor for the Morning Relief!&quot;<br />
Jen let out a small giggle. Was her last name actually &quot;Lumpshit&quot;?<br />
&quot;Now before we begin,&quot; Lorain continued, &quot;we&#39;re going to limber up those bones with some stretches. First, we&#39;re going to reeeeeaaach our arms as high as we can, like you&#39;re getting some food from the top shelf.&quot;<br />
Jen noticed her mother stretching along with the instructor and followed suit. A heavy sweat was starting to form along her body as she reached high in the air.<br />
&quot;And relax- *BUUUUUURRRRRP*,&quot; Lorain instructed as she moved on to the next stretch, &quot;Alright, now reach down to try and touch your toes, but don&#39;t worry if you can&#39;t actually reach that far. Just try to do as much as you can!&quot;<br />
Jen actually managed to grab her fat toes, a feat her mother was incapable of. While they were bent over, strong and violent farts escaped their butts with reckless abandon. The sounds of Lorain farting could be heard as well.<br />
&quot;And relax- *BUUUUUURRRRRP*,&quot; Lorain instructed again as she stood back up. &quot;Now, didn&#39;t that feel good to get all limber and sweaty? Sweat is a major aspect of a healthy slob lifestyle after all! It keeps you cool in the hot sun and helps your body odor get good and swampy!&quot;<br />
&quot;*BEALCH!* Told you so,&quot; Jen&#39;s mother smirked.<br />
&quot;Alright everyone,&quot; Lorain declared, &quot;It&#39;s time to relieve ourselves! We&#39;ll start with a nice urination. Research shows that peeing yourself is an excellent way to promote pubic hair growth and increase you virility. Besides, doesn&#39;t it feel nice to let it all out and feel it soak your undies and make them smell wonderfully rancid?&quot;<br />
Jen&#39;s normal memories wanted to call bullshit, but it almost seemed like her slob memories were telling her to calm down and understand that that was just how this world works.<br />
&quot;Alright everyone, take a deep breath in through your nose,&quot; Lorain continued, &quot;and let it all out. Ahhhhh-*uuuuuuuurrrrrrp!*...&quot; Her sigh of relief melted into a contented burp as her panties became wet with her urine, a stream of it leaking out the sides of her panties and onto the ground. Jen and her mother followed suit, soaking their clothes and the floor below them in the process. It felt hot, wet, and smelled really salty. Jen&#39;s slob memories felt a rush of relief wash over her as the last drops of pee were finally expelled. Jen&#39;s normal memories on the other hand were absolutely disgusted at what her body had done, and yet she felt comfortable in these soiled panties.<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t that feel good to get that out of your system?&quot; Loraine asked, &quot;Well it&#39;s about to get better, because it&#39;s time to defecate! Studies show that it&#39;s unhealthy for a slob to hold their feces in their bowels for too long, so it&#39;s recommended that you relieve yourself the moment you feel the need to pee or poop. Plus, a recent study has determined that the bigger shits you take, the healthier your digestion is, and who doesn&#39;t love a good digestion!<br />
&quot;Now, contract your gut muscles and force yourself to fart,&quot; she turned her butt to the camera and squatted to give her audience a better view. Jen and her mother squatted and forced themselves to fart, a huge stream of gas violently ripping through their ass cheeks. &quot;Keep going until they start to get wet,&quot; and indeed their farts began to sound wetter and sputter a bit. &quot;You should be able to feel your brown stuff begin to escape your anus. Don&#39;t be shy, let it all out!&quot; Jen watched as the seat of Lorain&#39;s panties began to swell with her poop, forming brown lumps and causing them to sag a bit more at a time. She could feel her own shit ejecting itself into her panties in much the same way, staining them brown. By this point, Jen&#39;s normal memories felt near about ready to pass out from embarrassment and disgust. Her slob memories loved the feeling, and felt fully relieved after the last bits of feces left her butt.<br />
&quot;Ahh... gotta love the ones that make you sweat, right folks?&quot; Lorain asked her audience. Jen couldn&#39;t help but agree. &quot;This concludes the Morning Relief! Don&#39;t forget to relieve yourself whenever you need to, and please have yourself a wonderful day! I&#39;ll see you all next time! Back to you, Jane!&quot;<br />
With that, Jen&#39;s mother turned off the TV.<br />
&quot;Alright sweetie, feel good?&quot;<br />
Jen shuffled around in her soiled panties a bit, feeling the poop inside smear and spread, and the urine clinging to her mons pubis. &quot;I feel- *BUUURRRPP!* great!&quot;<br />
&quot;Excellent!&quot; her mother cheered, &quot;Now with that out of the way, it&#39;s time for second breakfast!&quot;</p>
