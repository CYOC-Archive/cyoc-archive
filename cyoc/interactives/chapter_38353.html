<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You're glad that White Bat is ready to expel her Birthing Egg. Of course you knew that before she spoke. Her scent had changed after all. Somehow you know that she didn't have to tell you that. Suddenly a couple of snails were by her side. She squatted down and began pushing the Birthing Egg out. You watch fascinated as her Birthing Egg came out. It was obvious that she was in some discomfort, maybe some pain, but the look on her face was one of pure joy. Finally with a final push she expelled her Birthing Egg. It was about the size of a human baby if that baby was encased in an egg upon birth. This wasn't the same sized egg that you had been in for nine days. As soon as the Birthing Egg was out the snails secured it to a wall. As they did it grew until it was the same size as the one you had been in and the ones you have seen. When it was first expelled it was the same color as White Bat. As it grew it became translucent and the color faded. Now it was ready to receive it's first human to turn.<br />
 <br />
You want to be the one to throw Steve into the Birthing Egg but you only had one hand/paw at the moment and you would need two. Fortunately Red Panther came along just then.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I see that we have a Birthing Egg ready to go now&quot; Red Panther said.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Our nest can start to grow now&quot; you said. &quot;It's time for the human to become one of us.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;This is going to be a pleasure for me&quot; Red Panther said. &quot;He's one of the few who have ever been able to elude me.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;I thought so&quot; you said. &quot;He had told me about running into you in the woods. Now you'll be the one to toss him into the Birthing Egg like Purple Wolf did to me.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Red Panther went to the Holding Chamber and slashed the membrane open. Unfortunately Steve ran to the back so Red Panther had to go in after him. As soon as Red Panther was through the membrane sealed itself again. You slashed the membrane back open when Red Panther had Steve.<br />
 <br />
Red Panther was just about ready to toss Steve in when you both realized that the Birthing Egg wasn't open. Red Panther handed Steve to you while he opened the Birthing Egg. Of course Steve struggled and cursed. At one point he even tried biting you. It did him no good though just as it had done you no good. 'Stop thinking about the past' you tell yourself. 'That life is over. It's dead and irrelevant now.'<br />
 <br />
Red Panther opened the Birthing Egg and tossed Steve in. Steve let out a defiant scream as Red Panther sealed the Birthing Egg back up.<br />
 <br />
You watch as Steve tries to get out of the Birthing Egg. It was amusing to see him claw at the inside. Blue birthing fluid started to fill the Birthing Egg and Steve frantically tried to get out. You guessed that Steve did the same thing you did and took a breath before the Birthing Egg completely filled with the birthing fluid.<br />
 <br />
You knew that you would need more humans to grow your nest so you told Red Panther to take some Magni and go hunting for humans when the sun went down. In the meantime you went to the Procreation Chamber and looked for Pink Skunk. You found her just as she was coming out of one of the alcoves. In fact the one she came out of was one of the biggest ones. As soon as she sees you she says &quot;Well I've just finished with my sixth partner. Now the urge to breed that I had felt since I was changed is gone.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;I'm sure it will return once you expel the Birthing Egg&quot; you said.<br />
 <br />
&quot;You're probably right on that&quot; Pink Skunk said. &quot;Are you in any pain?&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Yes, but not as much as Yellow Fox&quot; you said.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I'll go stay with him after I introduce you to the three I've coupled with since leaving the nest&quot; Pink Skunk said.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I appreciate that&quot; you said.<br />
 <br />
Pink Skunk introduced you to three Magni, a black shrew, an orange bear, and a brown bull. Sex with them was as good as it had been before but your mind kept wandering to Yellow Fox. He should be in here instead of in the little alcove off the Birthing Chamber you decided would be a good place for the wounded. As soon as you finished having sex with the sixth Magni you felt the need to breed leave you. Now would start your nine days of being pregnant with a Birthing Egg.<br />
 <br />
With nothing better to do you head back to the Birthing Chamber to sit with Yellow Fox. When you arrived you saw that one of the snails was just finishing securing a Birthing Egg to the wall. This one was smaller than the first one though. You're about to ask Pink Skunk who had expelled that egg when you hear a little girl screaming. Then you see one of the snails dragging the little girl to the wall. The little girl couldn't have been more than seven but she was putting up a fight for her size and age. The snail placed her against the wall and started to coat her with a substance you hadn't seen yet. The snail worked fast and the girl was soon encased in an egg which the snail secured to the wall. That wasn't right though, it wasn't an egg, it was more like a cocoon. This cocoon was a light caramel color like the snails. Come to think of it all the snails were a light caramel color and smaller than the Magni. The two cocoons were smaller than the Birthing Eggs too. The one that the little girl is encased in is a bit smaller than the other one. You suddenly have a shocking, horror filled realization. THE SNAILS ARE CHILDREN!!!!!!</p>
