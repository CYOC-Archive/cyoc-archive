<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;LEAVE, LEAVE, ARE YOU NUTS, LOOK AT ME!&quot; I screamed being naked, and now with cloven hooves replacing toes, a darkened skin from hooves up to my groin, and fuzzy hairs on feet going up to curly black locks of goat wool now covering my thighs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave you say and go safe, without harm, you say, I think I've been harmed already! Look at me!&quot; I chide back as one turns around looking at what was human and is now well on the way to be satyr if not a total goat.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was done in haste can not be made whole again!&quot; tells the monster before me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave, and what of my life out there in the world where satyr's like you are deemed myth? Look at what they've done to me I am of beast! I can not return to my life and place of work looking like some wierd shepherd lost from his flock. I must be made me again, understand big guy I must me all me and not mixed with something else, me, me, me!&quot; I said getting more angry with the situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, I Cedius leader of this band can see a true problem here!&quot; he said as he walked me in a circle.<br />
<br />
&quot;About fucking time I'd say!&quot; said by a man injured to the quick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you are too old for being changed and constricted down to a fine sized fuck toy. Yet the hooves should not be wasted by amputation or the woolen hide removed with acid, I may have an idea if you concure?&quot; wondered the Master Cedius.<br />
<br />
I stood drinking in his words angered beyond words, then hearing him speak of cutting off my hooves and burning off this damned' hide. I stood turning to watch him as he walked about me, waiting for his answer to this trying time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you have any arguement in working for the Park as one of our long term employees? It offers a good wage, room and board plus a retirement program better than anything you might of had!&quot; offered Cedius.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me, live and work in the Park?&quot; I asked suddenly flabbergasp at the offer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I think of several position which you may choose!&quot; again urged Cedius for me to ease his problem and accept new employment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like where?' I asked. &quot;Then too what of these hooves and dark wool?&quot; I wondered what one might be doing looking like this? <br />
<br />
&quot;Come with me to my office and we shall make a call!&quot; he said as if an order.<br />
<br />
His office, where out here in a valley glade would he have an office, an office! This does not appear to me as any businessman in a wool suit. In fact he acts like a supervisor over an orgy of beastly sex offenders! I wobble behind him as one learns to walk on cloven hooves while standing on tiptoes, crazy!<br />
<br />
We pass into a hedge and I see to my amazed sight a throne made for a satyr. Wide and heavy to support his weight it even had a neat hole in the back for his tail to wiggle through. It stood next to a large Oak tree that had a small slanted writing pad nailed to the bark.<br />
<br />
He sat down with care to put his tail in the proper hole. Then as I stood before him he knocked his fist to the side of the Oak tree. Boink, and a narrow door came open showing an oldstyle phone. He took it out and sat it down on his woolen lap as he dial a number.<br />
<br />
I could not believe this, here I was in a square hedge surrounded room, no roof, grass for carpet and a Master saytr sitting on a throne making a phone call, plum nuts!<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a fine offer, if your interested?&quot; asked Cedius with a smile after a very short conversation with his phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can do little but listen at this point, can I!&quot; as I motion toward hooves and legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Supreme Senior Supervisor at our Yellowstone Theme Park over animal husbandry!&quot; said Cedius as if it were some great honor.<br />
<br />
I thought for a moment, then asked, &quot;Is it a stand alone position or are their others employed below me?&quot;<br />
<br />
A hardy laugh, &quot;Yes, there are others to whom are subservient directly to your orders and some even to your every desire. I can see you moving into the position easily by tomorrow.&quot; Cedius suggested in hope of my willing agreement.<br />
<br />
I stood working the idea in my head and considering the painful choices if I did not agree. &quot;Full Medical?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes, complete medical, accident or major medical, it's all covered 100%!&quot; he replied as if a normal thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vacation?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you wish to leave for a short week now and then, I'm sure the management will help you with any plans for rest and relaxation. To be sure, I have it the best assurence, a two week sabbatical of resting and finding new techinques for animal husbandry are included in your employment package. Trust me, you will find employment in this position will give you an erection just planning day!&quot; Cedius made his point.<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree then, but what of the hooves and hairy legs?&quot; was a true wonder on my mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will find them a perfect part of your daily work. I have to call for a van to pick you up at the main gate to our glade. &quot;Tye, come in here and show this new Park employee to where the van shall pick him up!&quot; called Cedius for his aide.<br />
<br />
Instantly Tye came around the corner of the hedge wall and stood almost at attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, take our new friend down to the main gate, but first go and retieve his clothes and get from the wine cellar a bottle of Bonasus' de La'Bovidae. So we shall toast your new position in life, I hope that working here brings true satisfaction and mounting rewards!&quot; said Cedius as he shook my hand.<br />
<br />
I was offered a seat and as he sat above me on his great throne he talked of his coming here many years ago. It was as I look back on it, like a father telling his son the experiences of a lifetime. Yet for him it was a wierd life of sexual conquests and orgy after drunken orgy. At last Tye returned with a dark brown glass bottle of wine and one cup.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fool, where's my cup?&quot; roared Cedius as young Tye shrugged his hairy shoulders and ran off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh well!&quot; said Cedius as he fingered out the cork from the bottle. &quot;I expect you are thirsty for this ordeal and would like a taste of this very special brew.&quot;<br />
<br />
Indeed I was dry of mouth and had the rank taste of satyr cock still clinging to my tongue. Watching and licking my lips as the bottle tipped and the wooden cup filled to the brim I took it and chugged it down with a pleasured feeling.<br />
<br />
One cup was refilled as we awaited the cup for Cedius. Then a second, a third and even a forth as then Cedius called for Tye to come in again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where's my cup, FOOL, take then our friend to the gate and await the van for pickup, understand me, can you do that simple of a task?&quot; laughed Cedius as he groaned like the youth was dumb at a box of rocks.<br />
<br />
A little lightheaded I got out of the chair and wobbling more than before walked to the opening in the hedge.<br />
<br />
&quot;I..I.. thank you Sir Cedius for coming to my aide in a time of terrrrouble!&quot; I slurred the words from the strong wine and six hardy cups no less.  <br />
<br />
Tye put his strong arm around me and I wobbled down the trail. <br />
<br />
&quot;I was sorry at first to see you so quickly changing to satyr, it takes younger people longer and therefore they accept it with ease. Yet I was even more surprised, you accepted the Yellowstone position since you were so angry about being only a little changed to satyr and goat!&quot; said Tye as we walked along.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why Tye, they are making me a Supreme Senior Supervisor over Animal Husbandry at the Yellowstone Theme Park! I said as I marvelled the words came out right.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes that's what I mean, I'm surprised to say the least!&quot; again he sounded off.<br />
<br />
I saw the main gate in sight but no van for picking me up. Turning to Tye I looked him in the eyes and asked a fated question. &quot;Your surprised I don't understand, it's a job and I'm to be paid and boarded, then retired with full benefits, what so wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't listen to between the lines of Cedius, he's never direct when making an offer! The wine sealed your employment alright, it's a special potion enhanced wine made by the Park's own science lab. He told you your hooves and legs would be an aid and help in your employment, well he was more than truthful there! The wine was Buffalo Bison wine, after swallowing two glasses of the potion you would have changed by tomorrow into a bull American Bison. Yet you drank the damn bottle dry and with it there is not ever, ever a chance for you to be anything but what your position says you are!<br />
Supreme a one and only, Senior the oldest, Supervisor a prime bull Bison, Animal Husbandry a prime sire, subservient as a cow in submission to the bull, your new position as in on all fours except when learning new techniques of husbandry, and then a vacation a sabbatical when they loan you out for stud, rest and relaxing as you learn those new techinques there of animal husbandry just another herd of cows! Then to top it off you get drunk on the potion and agree to work for many mounting rewards, your dumb! I see even now the growth on shoulders, and a tail any Bison bull would be proud to own. When the van arrives a new bull Bison will be loaded and sent to his herd of black pussied cows for his first lessons in mounting his reward!&quot; said Tye as I began to feel the rush of bovine life coming at me.</p>
