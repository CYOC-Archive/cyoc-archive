<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{{WOW! This is episode #702! How time flies when you&#39;re having fun!—tmw.}}<br />
<br />
Martha Anderson parked in the driveway of her house.<br />
&quot;If you two need anything...&quot; she said, looking at her passengers get out.<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll be fine,&quot; promised Samantha Twist, while taking her wife&#39;s hand. &quot;We just need a quiet evening at home and a good night&#39;s sleep.&quot; <i>I hope.</i><br />
&quot;Well,&quot; said Martha, coming around to say goodbye before going into her own house, &quot;maybe later this week we can get together for some girl time. After all, it&#39;s been a while since we...&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; said Frances Twist, while leaning her head on Samantha&#39;s shoulder. The three ladies were all werecats, with the Twists being the ones who jointly ushered Martha into were society, and it would be fun to enjoy each other sexually again, but &quot;Right now I&#39;m just looking forward to a good long soak in the tub and a decent night&#39;s sleep.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay. Night,&quot; said Martha, while hugging the Twists.<br />
The three of them exchanged quick pecks on the cheek, then Martha went inside to check on her own family.<br />
<br />
Walking from the Anderson&#39;s car to the front door of their place, Samantha tenderly held her wife&#39;s hand.<br />
<i>I had no idea how this day would turn out. I just let Frances sleep in while I went to attend an emergency meeting at the Town Hall. To think that Dymixious Drake would resist arrest and get involved in a shoot out with police, let alone that Frances would be at ground zero of it...*</i><br />
Samantha barely managed to suppress the shudder at the thought of losing Frances, her wife and one true love. While the married lesbian werecats had no problem having fun with other women, it was always by mutual consent, as was their feline nature. It was only in each other&#39;s furry arms that they ended each night, drifting off to sleep together to face another day in the morning.<br />
Silently, Samantha used her keys to let them in.<br />
She gently ushered Frances toward their bedroom when her wife said, &quot;I can start the bath myself, but would you fix us a pot of herbal tea?&quot;<br />
Samantha knew that Frances kept their pantry stocked with various brews, depending upon need.<br />
&quot;Sure. Would you like me to join you in the tub afterward?&quot;<br />
Frances turned to look at her. &quot;I&#39;d be highly disappointed if you don&#39;t. I love how you rub my back and massage my shoulders,&quot; she added, before kissing Samantha tenderly.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be there as soon as I can,&quot; promised Samantha, as she turned to head back toward the kitchen.<br />
&quot;Oh, by the way,&quot; called out Frances. &quot;We&#39;ll need to make arrangements for a repairman to come out.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; wondered Samantha out loud.<br />
&quot;During the fight this morning, a bullet broke the bedroom window,*&quot; answered Frances as calmly as if she was commenting on the weather, but the response made Samantha stop dead in her tracks.<br />
Samantha didn&#39;t know what to say as she heard their bedroom door open and close.<br />
<br />
Samantha stood in the kitchen, not thinking about anything except how close she came to losing Frances.<br />
Otherwise, she was like a little automaton, brewing a pot of tea in one of Frances&#39; metal kettles when her cellphone chimed receipt of an incoming text.<br />
It said: HOPE U 2 HAD FUN TODAY. I KNOW I HAVE WITH KENYA! WILL BE HOME BY CURFEW.–BEN.<br />
<i>Fun?</i> Then Samantha realized that, being on the other side of town, Ben was blissfully unaware of what had happened today.<br />
Samantha texted a reply. IF BEDROOM DOOR CLOSED, JUST SEE US IN THE MORNING.<br />
Ben texted back a couple of minutes later: K. AIN&#39;T IT WONDERFUL TO BE WITH THE 1 U LOVE?<br />
Samantha had no reply for that.<br />
<i>If I should ever lose her...</i><br />
<br />
Entering the bedroom with the tea kettle and 2 plastic cups, Samantha stopped in shock to see the bullet hole in the window. She followed the path with her eye, discovering that the projectile hit a picture of the Twists on the opposite wall.<br />
It was of the happy couple in public in their human forms, so no were secrets were at risk, but the bullet had went through Frances&#39; head!<br />
It was all Samantha could do to keep from crying as she recalled their past.<br />
<br />
Frances Carter moving into the house across the street from Samantha and her moms. The two of them instantly falling in love from practically the moment they first met.<br />
That magical first time they expressed their own love for each other, despite having to sneak around since Frances&#39; parents declared Samantha off limits upon discovering she was being raised by two lesbians.<br />
Although Samantha knew she was both a lesbian and a future werecat, she hadn&#39;t experienced her first transformation yet and thought it was physically safe to make love with the normal Frances until she did.<br />
But sexual preferences aside, the Carter family decided to be weredogs, and wanted Frances to follow in their paws when she was old enough to do so.<br />
By then, with Samantha being a year older, she had reluctantly stopped the sex between them, but continued to see Frances whenever they could secretly get together.<br />
The week after Frances&#39; 14th birthday, Samantha went to the weredog initiation ceremony to be moral support, despite officially not being invited to either event.<br />
&quot;No matter what I may be on the outside, I know who I am on the inside, and that person will always love you,&quot; declared Frances, as they walked home from school earlier that day.<br />
&quot;The day we get married will truly be the beginning of my life,&quot; was Samantha&#39;s reply, before they had to separate upon approaching the last block before their destinations.<br />
That night, Frances was with the others waiting to become a weredog when she clutched her stomach and started to moan. Moments later, a new werecat was starting to mew for Samantha to help complete her first transformation.<br />
<br />
Frances&#39; parents disowned her on the spot for shaming and dishonoring them. Samantha helped her future mate ease her way into were society, and then took Frances back to her house. There, her mothers took Frances in, under the conditions that both girls finished high school and got married when they were old enough to do so.<br />
Which they did.<br />
Since her college fund was in an otherwise untouchable trust established by her late maternal grandfather, Frances went on to college to become a therapist to help people with their emotional problems.<br />
Samantha, feeling guilty about taking Frances&#39; choice away from her before she could officially make one, went into public service, eventually joining the administration of new mayor Martin Stovall.<br />
Their own house, becoming first guardians and later adopted parents to one young werewolf, and a whole lot more had happened since then, but the one constant in the lives of Mrs. and Mrs. Twist were their continued love and devotion to each other.<br />
<br />
A splash from the Jacuzzi tub in the bathroom brought Samantha back to the present.<br />
Walls could be repaired. Broken windows and pictures replaced, but true love?<br />
<i>If I should ever lose her...</i><br />
With that, Samantha set the tea stuff down just long enough to strip and release her inner werecat.<br />
Then she picked everything up again and prepared to enter the bathroom.<br />
<br />
AUTHOR&#39;S NOTE:<br />
I originally had a longer and more detailed account of Samantha and Frances&#39; back story here, but I guess it was too long for the CYOC.net system, for it didn&#39;t all appear the first time I hit &quot;Post Chapter&quot;. Time restraints (I have to go to work soon) and the fact I was working from scratch keep me from recalling/reposting all of it now, but perhaps in the future...<br />
