<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shaken, Kyle sat down at his desk in first period. When he took his revenge on Jen, he didn’t think the Transform or Dare legend would actually be true! He just wanted to freak her out or something! And now that he knew it was very very real, he was very very caught up in it. But how hard could it be to avoid people saying his full name? When did that ever happen these days? People just called him “Kyle.” And some of his mail said “Mr. Perkins.” But when was the last time somebody up and called him “Kyle Perkins?”<br />
<br />
He was lost in thought when his musings were interrupted by an unfamiliar female voice from the front of the room. “Hello class! My name is Ms. Dawson. Mr. Anthony is out sick today so I’ll be filling in! Let’s start off with attendance, shall we? Anita Asram?”<br />
<br />
“Here!”<br />
<br />
“Miles Builder?”&#8232;&#8232;“Here!”<br />
<br />
Kyle started to sweat. Ms. Dawson was rocketing so fast through attendance that she was already at the D’s. He was NOT about to go to bed with his substitute teacher. He had to think of something, and fast! He raised his hand.<br />
<br />
“Yes, mister…. Perkins?” said the teacher, consulting her seating chart. Close one. <br />
<br />
“I have to go to the bathroom!”<br />
<br />
“Right now? You’ve had all morning to-“<br />
&#8232;“It’s an emergency!” Kyle jumped up from his desk, knocking it over in a mad dash out the door. He darted past the hall monitor who just stared at him agape as he ran out the front doors of the school. He didn’t even think about where he was going, so when he finally looked up he realized he was in the same neighborhood as his weed dispensary. He might have been a freshman with no visible body hair (curse his blonde locks!), but he was genetically blessed with a height over six feet, and that combined with his fake ID granted him access to a lot of places that other teens his age couldn’t even dream of. Come to think of it, he really needed to calm down right about now… And nobody at the dispensary knew his real name. The name on his ID was “Walter Gibbons” so he was safe there. Kyle nodded. It was a plan. Some indica, then brainstorming how the hell to keep anyone from saying his full name until the end of time.<br />
<br />
He walked into the dispensary and waved hello to the desk clerk. His name was Carlos and he was always nice to Kyle. That may have been due to the fact that, at 5 foot 6, Carlos had to crane his neck to even look at Kyle. But regardless, Kyle was happy to see him. <br />
<br />
Carlos looked up, his nose ring glinting under the fluorescent light. “Hi Walt! Early day today, huh? Let’s see that ID!”<br />
<br />
Kyle, relieved to see a friendly face, fumbled through his wallet and handed Carlos his fake ID. Carlos wrinkled his nose. “I hate to break it to you, but this is a student ID from the local high school. Is this a friend of yours? Kyle Perkins?”<br />
<br />
Shiiiiiiit. In his nervous distraction, Kyle must have handed Carlos the wrong ID! He laughed and said, “oh, I’m holding that for my… nephew. Here’s my real ID.” He passed the fake driver’s license to Carlos, their fingers brushing as he took the card. As soon as they touched, Kyle felt a spark of electricity. Double shiiiiiit. In his fear of being caught, he hadn’t even noticed the curse being activated! <br />
<br />
Well he couldn’t help but notice now, because his head began to spin. He reached his hand out to stabilize himself on the desk, but he just slammed his forearm into its wooden front. Was the desk always that high up? How had he misjudged that? “Carlos? How tall am I?”<br />
<br />
“How should I know?” Carlos grinned, his smile lighting up his features. How had Kyle never noticed how cute that smile made him look? “Let me check your ID. Ah yes, 5 foot 7, just like always. Are you already high? It’s a little early for that, babe. At least wait for me to get home.” Carlos winked and Kyle felt his heart melt. He found purchase on the desk finally, looking the clerk directly in the eye. It was weird not to have to crane his neck anymore, but at this angle, he could see just how attractive Carlos truly was. His brown skin was perfectly smooth, and his luxurious black hair was swept upward and away from his perfectly symmetrical face. The fact that he had literally just shrunk seven inches didn’t bother him in the slightest if it gave him easier access to this man’s luscious lips…<br />
<br />
He tried to snap himself out of it. “You know what, Carlos? I think I just need some air. I’ll… I’ll be right back.” He dashed out the door and into the parking lot, unlocking his black Prius and hopping in the driver’s seat, leaning against the wheel for support while he took deep breaths. Wait… he didn’t have a car! He jolted upward, looking around in alarm at the interior of the Prius, which he had literally never been inside before this very moment. And yet… it felt familiar. There were the beads he had strung over the rearview mirror to give it a little color. There was the scuff he and Carlos had made on the glove compartment when they were getting a little nasty in the passenger seat. He shook his head to clear his thoughts. Obviously Carlos had activated the curse, but maybe there was something he could do to stop it before anything more than his height changed. He didn’t want to be in love with some dude forever! He hadn’t even kissed a girl yet!<br />
<br />
He tried to conjure up images of girls in his head, but the best he could do was a memory of Carlos with the long hair he had back when he first started going to the dispensary. He flipped his hair, his dark eyes staring into Kyle’s with pure lust. Kyle’s dick started to plump up in his pants, reaching full mast then extending even further like an inflating balloon until it became a thick eight inch sausage. He groaned and rubbed it through the fabric, enjoying the shivers of pleasure emanating from his now larger member. At least his height was the only thing that shrank, he thought with relief.<br />
<br />
The fabric covering his crotch and legs began to shimmer and soften, becoming a pair of high-end grey sweat pants. The lighter color really made the dark skin of his arm pop as he continued to rub himself. He stopped in shock. Since when was he so tan? His entire arm was now a deep brown, like he was dipped in paint. The only part that was still pale was his shoulder, but he could see the color spreading, covering his entire shoulder and flowing underneath his shirt.<br />
<br />
He reached to pull open his collar and track the color’s progress, but his collar wasn’t there anymore. The fabric of his shirt pulled itself down as if by its own gravity, becoming a scooped turquoise tank top that barely covered his nipples. The newly airy garment allowed him the perfect vantage to see the brown color spread across his chest and down his other arm, swirling around his nipples until they too turned dark brown and stuck out from his chest, hard as thumbtacks. The color spread out of sight down into his sweats, where he could only assume it was spreading onto his legs and his feet. <br />
<br />
He quickly kicked off his shoes and lifted up the cuff of his sweats to investigate. Sure enough, color was spreading across his foot, delicately painting each toe like he was brushing on nail polish. He flipped down the sun visor and looked at himself in the mirror to see the last of the color spreading its way across his face. He looked like a marshmallow slowly roasting over a bonfire, the pale color rapidly fading away until he was left with a completely brown face framed by horribly clashing blonde hair.<br />
<br />
He wondered what exactly Carlos’ type was. He imagined he was probably supposed to be Mexican now, to match Carlos. He flipped the radio onto one of the Spanish channels to see if he could understand anything. But beyond a few words he had learned in high school, it was all gobbledygook.<br />
<br />
Frustrated, he went to turn off the radio, but accidentally pushed one of the channel preset buttons, and instantly the car filled with the wailing of an electric sitar. A female voice sang in Hindi along with a dance beat and instantly his pulse started to race. He could understand every word she was saying… and he was loving it! He jammed along with the beat, pumping his fist and singing along with the words. He began drumming the dashboard, not noticing the black hairs that had started to pop up on the back of his hands. As they wriggled out of their follicles, the veins on the back of his hands rose to prominence, his wrists thickening as the hair spread up his forearms. The hair continued its march, spreading across his upper arms in a thick black sheet as the skin beneath it rippled, pulsing with cords of muscle that gave him bulging, brilliant, brown biceps.<br />
<br />
His underarms tickled as a huge, thick thatch of hair sprouted, spreading to several inches in diameter. The hair continued on its inexorable path, spreading in the same pattern that the color had just used, swirling around his nipples as his pecs began to plump up, forming a formidable shelf that threatened to burst the already tenuous hold his loose tank top had over his torso. His stomach caved in, forming cobblestone abs that became dusted with thick black hair, which spread across his skin like a river forming rivulets between boulders. A huge pubic thatch burst into existence above his swollen member, so thick that, if he had lifted up his shirt, you could see it bursting from the top of his sweats. His legs tickled as the hair ran down them, and his sweats dug in as his quadriceps and calves similarly expanded with muscle. His vantage point raised by an inch as his ass plumped up beneath him, becoming round and thick with muscle. He wriggled his toes as they each sprouted their own personal tiny patch of coarse dark hair.<br />
<br />
He scratched an itch on his chest, enjoying the texture of his forest of hair against his smooth skin. When the commercials came on, he looked back into the mirror and winked at himself, barely even noticing that his green eyes had darkened to brown, his thin blonde eyebrows thickening into two wide black strips. His nose elongated into a thin, hooked shape that belied his proud Indian heritage as a short black beard sprouted around his thick lips, tickling as it spread into a pair of luscious sideburns. As soon as it met with his blonde hair, the black color spread like spilled oil, shearing down the sides and giving the top of his short hair a natural lift and bounce.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he felt a sharp sting on his neck. He slapped it, thinking it was some bug, but when he removed his hand, he revealed a small tattoo of a triangle on the nape. A similar sting struck his nose as a small silver ring pierced its way into it. He thought it looked great and he wrinkled his nose, giving a little head waggle of sheer delight.<br />
<br />
A knock on the window startled him out of his reverie. He looked out the window to see the dispensary clerk beaming. His face broke into a wide grin, his teeth gleaming white. “Carlos!”<br />
<br />
“Let me in, pendejo! Unless you’re trying to go home without me. Which I wouldn’t advise, because I still have this.” Carlos held up a driver’s license and wiggled it teasingly. <br />
<br />
“Alright, alright, you win.” Kyle unlocked the passenger door and Carlos left in, giving him a passionate hello kiss. Kyle’s entire body felt like every neuron was firing, lighting him up with sheer pleasure. His dick, which had begun to go soft (still larger than it had ever been before) stood back up at full attention. “I love you,” he whispered.<br />
<br />
“I love you too,” said Carlos, settling back into his seat. “Now hold onto this because you know a car with two brown men is going to get pulled over at some point, and you don’t want to be without your license.”<br />
<br />
“Sure thing, babe. You know me. I’d forget my own name if it wasn’t tattooed on me.”<br />
<br />
Carlos lifted up the tank top to reveal a tattoo in curly script on Kyle’s hip. “Just don’t get it mixed up with mine, I don’t want to know what kind of trouble you’d get me into.”<br />
<br />
As he pulled his shirt back down and began to back out of his parking space, the tattoo finished unfurling across his dark skin, filling the only space that wasn’t covered with dense, curly hair.<br />
<br />
“Kiaan + Carlos Forever”</p>
