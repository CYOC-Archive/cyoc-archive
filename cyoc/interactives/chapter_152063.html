<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Do you think you could use your tail to write something?”<br />
Mary slithered to the living room and picked a pen and paper. She put them over the table and tried to catch the pen with her tail. When she got it, she started to draw something.<br />
Jeff had followed her to the living room and noticed that her neck and body were extending. She had snake scales over all her back and they were climbing up her neck.<br />
“Your scales are spreading faster now!”<br />
“And it is difficult to use my tail to write something.” She showed Jeff the paper and he could read ‘I love you’ in some ugly letters. Then he noticed something else.<br />
“Your eyes are all black now!”<br />
“Are they?” Mary asked before slithering back to their bedroom and standing in front of a mirror. <br />
“My face is changing now!” She said as her nose widened and her mouth pushed forward in a tiny muzzle. <br />
“And your hair is shrinking too!” Jeff said.<br />
“Well, I think I won’t speak much more in a few minutes.”<br />
“Ah, the peace!” Jeff joked.<br />
Mary felt her body growing again and went to Jeff, wrapping his body into her coils. She was face to face with him and then they kissed.<br />
Jeff felt Mary’s tongue becoming different. He caressed her body and could not find any place without scales. When they broke the kiss, he saw that she had scales all over her head. Her face was pushing forward and her teeth were all sharper. She put her tongue out and they saw that it was forked and long now.<br />
Mary tried to caress Jeff’s face but saw that her hands and arms were shrinking. Her shoulders narrowed and soon all her body was round.<br />
“We will talk again in 24 hours…” She said.<br />
“At least you will be smart. I can live with an anaconda during that time.”<br />
Mary tried to say something back but could only make snake noises. She hissed and tried to speak but it didn’t work.<br />
“Can you release me, please?” Jeff asked as he was still wrapped into her coils. “Let’s see your length.”<br />
Mary released her husband and started to pull her body into the bedroom. Jeff was shocked to see more and more snake body entering their bedroom until the tip of her tail entered.<br />
“Wow! You are enormous!”<br />
Mary shook her head affirmatively and then coiled herself. Jeff noticed that she was as wide as a person at her widest section, that her head was almost as big as a human’s and that the tip of her tail was thin and delicate.<br />
“Can you still remember how to write? Are you really inside this body?”<br />
“Yessssssss” Mary hissed.<br />
“Wow! Can you speak?”<br />
Mary shook her head negatively. Then she went to the living room and used her tail to catch the pen and write.<br />
‘I can only make snake sounds. At least now I can write better using my tail.’<br />
“Are you curious about your length?”<br />
“yesssss” she hissed again.<br />
Jeff took a measuring tape.<br />
“Let’s go outside. You can’t straighten your body here, but our backyard is big enough for you”<br />
Mary quickly slithered to their backyard and then straightened her body on the grass. Jeff measured her from head to tail.<br />
“Wow! You are 20 feet long now! Open your mouth please? I want to see what it is like inside it.”<br />
Mary opened her huge mouth and Jeff saw sharp fangs all over her mouth. <br />
“You have some sharp teeth! And what about that tongue? It is too different.”<br />
Mary closed her mouth and put her tongue out. She could smell several things she couldn’t before. She stood her head up until it was facing Jeff and then licked his face. As he was still naked, Mary saw as his penis was hard and she had some ideas.<br />
Mary slithered back into their bedroom and Jeff followed her. When he was inside the bedroom, Mary jumped at him and wrapped his body with her coils while pushing him into bed.<br />
“Mary! What are you doing?” Jeff asked but expected no answer.<br />
“Ssssssssexxxxx” Mary hissed and then licked his face.<br />
“But how? You are a snake now!”<br />
She bent her body and snaked her head until she was facing his penis. She licked it and then used her tongue to wrap and caress it. She stroked his penis using her tongue until it was hard enough. She knew she still had some sort of pussy because she was feeling a need to be laid. She pulled her tail tip up and searched until she found her cloaca. <br />
Mary impaled herself into her husband penis and felt a shiver throughout her body. She hissed and pumped hard until she reached an orgasm. Jeff was enjoying it too, since his wife’s cloaca was tight. <br />
Just after Mary’s orgasm subsided, Jeff came inside her and she had another one. She hissed and licked her husband until her orgasm ended. Then she loosened her coils around Jeff and laid him on the bed. <br />
“Wow! You are really strong now. I thought you would break all my bones when you came.” Jeff said.<br />
Mary just licked his face and then rested her head over his chest while pulled her body over the bed and around him. Jeff embraced his anaconda wife and they both slept.<br />
On the next morning Jeff woke up and saw that the last night wasn’t a dream. He was still hugging a huge anaconda and was using her body as a pillow. He just kissed her head and then went to the bedroom.<br />
After that, he prepared some breakfast for himself and saw as Mary entered the kitchen.<br />
“Good morning sleepy head!”</p>
