<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt sat and waited. For several seconds, nothing happened.<br />
<br />
Then Matt felt a tingle go through his whole body. His clothes suddenly felt a bit tighter. His crotch felt a little bit more strained. Looking down, he noticed that the leg of his pants, which usually hung down onto his shoes, now barely reached his feet. Matt quickly ran to the wall and measured himself. He discovered he was now 5&#39;5&quot;. Matt gasped... it was really real! He thought... oh boy, what&#39;s gonna happen to my clothes? Matt strangely wanted to grow out of his clothes and shoes. He quickly ran to get his shoes, which luckily still (barely) fit.<br />
<br />
He felt another tingle. This time, he felt a pain in his shoes as his feet were constrained in his shoes. He noticed that the machine displayed his current stats on the monitor: <br />
<br />
[SUBJECT INFO]<br />
HEIGHT: 67IN (5FT, 7IN)<br />
WEIGHT: 120LBS<br />
SHOE SIZE: US9<br />
<br />
Holy crap! Matt was now two sizes over his shoes, and he could feel it. His pant legs now ended an inch above his shoes. His crotch felt strained, and from the looks of it, his cock was also growing along with him. His muscles looked slightly more defined as well.<br />
<br />
Another tingle. Matt felt slightly light-headed as the pain increased. Looking at the monitor, his size 10s felt almost like they were in an iron vise, while his pants felt extremely tight around his whole body now. In fact, the legs ended a couple inches short now! His cock felt confined in the tight fabric, and his buttcheeks, previously flat, had been buffed up a bit. Matt was amazed his shoes had held up this long.<br />
<br />
Another tingle, but this time much stronger. Matt felt several things shift around his body and change much more violently. Firstly, his size 12s burst through the shoes, ripping the front and sides of the shoe. Matt wiggled his toes and was almost elated to see the size of his feet. They were already quite a few sizes bigger. His pants, faced with the stress of riding up 4 more inches, ripped and effectively fell off, leaving Matt in his boxers. The screen now displayed:<br />
<br />
[SUBJECT INFO]<br />
HEIGHT: 74IN (6FT, 2IN)<br />
WEIGHT: 185LBS<br />
SHOE SIZE: US15<br />
<br />
Matt was already a full foot taller, and the difference was extremely noticeable. Matt&#39;s muscles were also much more toned. Below him, Matt&#39;s feet dwarfed his old shoes, and Matt&#39;s shoulders were extremely broad already. And in the crotch... Matt estimated his cock to be 8 inches soft. For the first time, Matt realized his balls had swollen to the size of tennis balls.<br />
<br />
Another huge tingle. Matt&#39;s legs stretched another couple of inches. Suddenly, Matt felt pain on his head as he hit the door frame. That meant he was at least 6&#39;8&quot;! He was now effectively naked, save for his boxers, which were stretched thin desperately trying to contain his now 10 inch meat. His feet, now beyond any comparison to his old shoes, stretched across the carpet.<br />
<br />
Then, a final tingle. Matt&#39;s head came dangerously close to the ceiling. His feet surged forward a couple inches, bringing them to their final size 23. His cock shot out another two inches, becoming a foot long. His balls swelled to baseball size. The machine chimed, beeping that it was finished.<br />
<br />
Matt took stock of the situation. Gone was the 5&#39;2&quot; scrawny nerd with a small cock. In his place stood a 7&#39;2&quot; 14 year old giant. Matt flexed, feeling his improved muscles. He couldn&#39;t believe it. His feet were huge, and he towered over everything else in the room.<br />
<br />
Looking in his dresser, Matt had to attempt not to laugh when he tried to put on some of his boxers. The material was nearly see-through, and could barely contain his monster. His balls couldn&#39;t fit, and popped out the bottom to hang low.<br />
<br />
Matt didn&#39;t know what to think, but he was sure of one thing: this was extremely excessive, and he loved it. Even so, he did have a limit, and while 7&#39;2&quot; was absolutely amazing, he was 100% sure he would not fit in his family&#39;s car. As much as he hated to admit it, Matt did have a limit.<br />
<br />
Sighing, Matt crossed to the machine, but before he could get there, the machine beeped and displayed a dialog: TRIAL ALMOST OVER. YOU CAN REVERT ALL BUT ONE CHANGE. PLEASE CHOOSE THE CHANGE YOU WANT TO KEEP. Below it, the three options showed:<br />
A) Height<br />
B) Penis/Ball Size<br />
C) Foot Size<br />
<br />
Matt froze. He didn&#39;t know this was a trial! But he had to choose one to keep. The problem was, any of these would put him out of proportion. He thought about it. Did he want to go through his life being over 7 feet tall? He still had natural growth left. Added on, he could end up past 7&#39;6&quot; no problem. Would that be worth it?<br />
<br />
Should he keep the foot size? He&#39;d go through life as a freak. His Size 23 feet were enormous, almost double the size of his old size 7. They already looked huge at his current height. What would happen if he went back to 5&#39;2&quot;?<br />
<br />
Finally, his penis. The 12 inch soft monster hung down between his legs between two baseball-sized testicles. Of all the options, this was probably the easiest to deal with. The issue would be public decency. It would be extremely difficult to hide this monster in public, and arousal? That&#39;d be a nightmare.<br />
<br />
Matt couldn&#39;t decide...</p>
