<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harvey looked at his home once again. The one thing he did like about his life was living <br />
right on the seafront. Not so much that he wouldn’t give it up, but he felt he aught to take <br />
a moment to enjoy while he could.<br />
<br />
He opened the door and smelled the salty air for the last time. Then, the salty air drifted <br />
inside and he quickly remembered being naked. He shut the door.<br />
<br />
He was about to walk back to the mirror, but realised that soon there wouldn’t be any <br />
mirror, so what was the point? So he stood in the center of the room, it being no better <br />
than anywhere else and shook the cube for three seconds.<br />
<br />
For a brief moment there was nothing but a vivid blur. It was over before he really <br />
registered it. The next thing he knew, his vision was filled with a brownish pink colour. <br />
<br />
“Oh, Ambrosios.”<br />
<br />
It was skin, but inches before his face. It was hard to focus on as it wouldn’t keep still, but <br />
it was dotted with sweat and water. It wasn’t his.<br />
<br />
“Yes! Yes, I like it, Ambrosios.”<br />
<br />
He was suddenly very aware that his cock, for he still had one, was hard and very warm. <br />
His lower body was wet. No, not just wet, underwater. And there was somebody on top of <br />
him.<br />
<br />
“Oh! Oh, so close.”<br />
<br />
He was looking at a young man’s shoulder, rising up and down. He couldn’t really move, <br />
but he could see the boy’s ear and long, dark hair bobbing with him. He looked down and <br />
saw the boy’s large, hard cock bobbing too.<br />
<br />
The boy came. Hot, cum spilled all over Harvey for the second time that day. The boy <br />
gasped and sighed. Then dismounted.<br />
<br />
“Did you finish?”<br />
<br />
Harvey looked at the boy as he tried to work out what he meant. When he realised he was <br />
talking about the sex, he was so surprised by the question that he answered honestly and <br />
shook his head. The boy was handsome and muscled and couldn’t be much older than <br />
seventeen. He looked Mediterranean and though Harvey could understand him, he wasn’t <br />
speaking English.<br />
<br />
“Oh, let me help.”<br />
<br />
The boy grinned and took Harvey’s cock into his mouth. Harvey was so astonished that <br />
just sat there. Harvey had not been gay in his previous life but he found this so <br />
invigorating and found the boy so beautiful and the whole situation so curious that he did <br />
not protest.<br />
<br />
For the first time, he realised they were in a small, warm pool. There were bubbles; a <br />
jacuzzi. Surrounding them were many more pools and several other men. Some were <br />
giving them funny looks. The boy came up for air, then continued on his cock.<br />
<br />
Waves of pleasure caressed him and he leant back. Above him he could see the clouds. It <br />
was a scorching, summer day. That there was no roof suggested every day was warm.<br />
<br />
Harvey came, the boy swallowed and surfaced. He looked very proud of himself. Then he <br />
looked concerned.<br />
<br />
“Are you alright, Ambrosios?”<br />
Harvey took it that he was Ambrosios.<br />
“People are watching,” he observed. He surprised himself by speaking the same foreign <br />
tongue as the boy.<br />
“Let them watch,” the boy scoffed, “What can they do? They are just jealous I am with you <br />
and not they.”<br />
<br />
Harvey looked down at his body. He had expected to be handsome, like the boy, but <br />
instead he say a large, bulging gut covered with thick, dark hair. He was squat and hairy <br />
and couldn’t see his cock. He felt his face where there was a thick, full beard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get me a mirror!&quot; Harvey/Ambrosios yelled.<br />
<br />
The boy confusedly led Ambrosios away from the baths, through a door into a sort of <br />
antechamber. There was a mosaic on the floor and it was lit by flaming torches. Ambrosios <br />
realised he was no longer in the 20th Century. It looked more like Ancient Greece.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here,&quot; said the boy, passing Ambrosios a small, handheld mirror.<br />
&quot;Do you not have a larger one?&quot;<br />
The boy chuckled, &quot;This is the largest I've ever seen.&quot;<br />
Ambrosios grumbled and held it to his face.<br />
<br />
He was a fat, middle aged Greek man. His head was balding but everywhere else was <br />
covered in thick, dark hair. He wore nothing except the necklace.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's your name, boy?&quot; he asked.<br />
The boy was stunned, “It’s me... Kyros. Don’t you remember my name? I have been your <br />
lover for the past two months.”<br />
“Tell me, Kyros. Why are you my lover when you are so beautiful and I am not?”<br />
“I think you beautiful, Ambr-”<br />
“Yes, but why?”<br />
<br />
Kyros looked reproachful.<br />
“Because you asked me.”<br />
“And you accepted?”<br />
“One does not refuse the most wealthy and powerful man in Athens.”<br />
<br />
Wealthy and powerful? That he could live with. He was even warming to the idea of being <br />
gay so long as he could have men like Kyros. But in the physique department this was a <br />
step backwards. Could he live with it?<br />
<br />
He could use the necklace to change it, of course. A slight shake and he could stay there <br />
but be handsome. But then, would anybody still recognise him as Antonio. Would he lose <br />
his wealth and power? Would he lose Kyros.<br />
<br />
He could always change lives again and hope for something better. But it could also get <br />
much worse. And Kyros was so beautiful.<br />
<br />
It was a tricky decision.</p>
