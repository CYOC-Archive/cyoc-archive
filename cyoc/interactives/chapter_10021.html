<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The time was right, everybody was all tied up with the perils of Daphne and her love of a blonde haired stallion. In one swift move Shaggy scooped up the medallion out of the dust and headed of into the dark forest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shaggy, no!&quot; yelled the Professor as Jarret started down the dark trail as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop Jarret, let him go less in some fight or arguement you lose what other's have lost, oh I've got a headache!&quot; said the Professor as his hand was slapped to forehead.<br />
<br />
Shaggy ran far down the forest trail till he came to an opening which looked like a wide open pasture. The half moon above offered little light but gave the glade an erie feel. As he stepped ever so carefully into the hip high grass his sweaty hand clutched the medallion tightly.<br />
<br />
Really not knowing why he grabbed the Medallion, Shaggy looked around as he walked further into the field. Then a soft thud sound. Shaggy turned to the left and stood very still. His head reminded him that this was the wilds of South America and there lurked down here many strange creatures.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-H-A-G-G-Y !&quot; said a slow and soft voice from out of the grass.<br />
<br />
Whirling around Shaggy jammed the Medallion into the watch pocket of his jeans, ready if needed the to fight for his life.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-H-A-G-G-Y !&quot; came the voice again but this time for his right.<br />
<br />
Shaggy was so scared he almost wet his pants. Now fists drawn up he stood in fine boxer form to defend himself from, what?<br />
<br />
&quot;S-H-A-G-G-Y kneel or die the choice is yours!&quot; said the warning voice from out in the high grass.<br />
<br />
Standing, looking, listening, the fight was not one he might win and to face death at the age of 20 was beyond Shaggy's wildest nightmare. The crazy things he's witnessed of friends being changed in a matter of minutes to animals scared him all the more. Slowly his determined self began to shrink and slowly he sank to kneel down.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have something which belonged to me, I want it back, Shaggy!' came an even more determined sounding voice.<br />
<br />
Shaggy wondered what he have that the voice would want, &quot;The Medallion! You want the Medallion, but who are you?&quot; asked a nervous and scared young man.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want it as with it I can have all do my biddings! It blessed me and I shall bring others into my loving ways!&quot; said the voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;You speak in riddles, why?' asked Shaggy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Life is a riddle, don't you remember the Professor's favorite phrase?&quot; asked the voice back.<br />
<br />
Shaggy began to laugh and standing up said, &quot;All right who's ever out there show yourself, guy you had me worried!&quot;<br />
<br />
The tall grass moved a little here and then a little more till stepping out stood one dark brown and big horned male goat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shaggy I told you not to stand up or you will die!&quot; said the big goat.<br />
<br />
Shaggy stood there looking down at the goat. It's black ribbed very pointed horns glistening in the moon's light. A look this way and that Shaggy's eyes panned about for who was wishing he'd think a goat could talk?<br />
<br />
&quot;Ole' shit head Shaggy, we called you back in high school!&quot; mouthed the words so perfectly out the goats lips.<br />
<br />
Flop, went Shaggy back down to his knees and was nose to muzzel with the big brown goat. Now eyes panned the massive beast standing before him as metal thoughts danced about in his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you remember when you and I force raped Annabelle Lintz?&quot; asked the goat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Simon? Your a goat!&quot; said Shaggy eyes wide, mouth half open, and pointing up at the animal's curly haired face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup, and I look the part too!&quot; said Simon as he danced a small circle showing off his verile self.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll wish you back to be yourself!&quot; said Shaggy as he reached for the Medallion.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO, FUCK HEAD !&quot; screamed Simon.<br />
<br />
Shaggy stopped, his fingers just short of touching the powerful Medallion. &quot;Why not?&quot; asked Shaggy.<br />
<br />
The big goat cocked his head a little and almost smiled. &quot;Cause shithead I like being a goat, that why! I as you liked to play and fondle females, now I can day in and day out, who cares? I can fuck them silly and they come back for more! I learned quickly to think of grazing as if eating a salad meal, so other than that everything is the same in life except of enjoying one's very male self, see?&quot; explained Simon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well sort'a, maybe, but what would you want with the Medallion now, your a goat?' asked a slow thinking Shaggy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shithead, your dumber than a box of rocks! Cause my stupid friend I could wish Daphne, Velma, Jenny, and the rest of you guys to join my herd, that's why!&quot; said Simon with a small grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think I'd like being a stinking male goat and eat grass all day!&quot; said Shaggy.<br />
<br />
Simon laughed out loud, &quot;No stupid, I'm not planning to share my sexy kingdom with you! I plan to change all of you into nanny goats for me to fuck until the end of time, got it my sweet?&quot; asked Simon as he almost hissed out the word sweet.<br />
<br />
Shaggy jumped up and pointing at Simon studdered out, &quot;You, you wan, want me to, to, to, be a fa, fucking fe, female ga, goat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YUP!&quot; replied a self assured male goat.<br />
<br />
&quot;No fucking way, I'd die first!&quot; screamed a ensensed Shaggy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I told you not to stand up it gives me a much better target!&quot; replied Simon as he began to back up for a charge and one kill. <br />
<br />
Suddenly Simon lowered his head and charged at Shaggy. Quickly he sidestepped the charging animal and turned like a toriador to face the animal once again.<br />
<br />
&quot;DIE!&quot; snorted Simon as he charged again.<br />
<br />
Instincts work on both sides of the living world. Animals are graced with life preserving instincts and so are people. As Simon charged with all his might and billy goat force, Shaggy drew upon his one summer camp long past where he learned to bulldog calves. <br />
<br />
Grabbing the mighty goats horns he twisted the great strong neck using it's force and horns against itself. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's like animal Judo!&quot; said Shaggy as he twisted Simon's neck hard left making the enraged animal fall to the ground and submit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let go of me and I'll spare your life!&quot; demanded Simon.<br />
<br />
Shaggy lifted his leg over Simon's head crushing the big goat's face into the ground. A hand still pushed the horn of the goat to one side he was free to go for the Medallion with his other hand.<br />
<br />
Simon pleaded for release but Shaggy had a worthwhile idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Simon my friend you have always been a nasty woman hater and one who believes on sodomy! I have you at my mercy and will grant what one like you deserves! I Shaggy holder of the Medallion do wish for my friend Simon to lose the abilty to speak out his goatish mouth! I also wish for Simon the big wild goat to feel the loss of his human mentality till only the normal animal mind will remain, so soon there buddy, you'll really be a true goat!&quot; wished Shaggy as Simon's speach changed to bleating and his mind was slowly degrading as well.<br />
<br />
Shaggy let Simon up and as soon as the big stinking brown goat had his freedom it ran off into the tall grass.<br />
<br />
Laying back Shaggy releaxed and smiled thing of how Annabelle would have liked to be there at that moment. A laugh and then another till Shaggy lay there rolling in the grass enthralled with his brillance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man, oh man Simon how your gon'a hatwe me for changing you to a total goat. Damn, think of what he was feeling his long beastly cock and those horny female goats, wow! It would have been maybe neat to live as a male goat, or would it?&quot; wondered Shaggy.<br />
<br />
Taking the Medallion from his watchpocket he turned the silver bobble over and over. Wondering as so many before him who'd thoughts were captured by lusts and desries to feel what it might be like as an animal?<br />
<br />
A scream of what must be a nanny goat being roughly fucked by a rapidly degraded mental dunce Simon echoed the woods.<br />
<br />
Shaggy stood up and yelled out, &quot;Fuck her a good one Simon I wish I was with ya!&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning around he began to walk back to the forest and find that trail to the encampment. The Medallion was tucked back into his watch pocket and little did he yet notice the sprouting dark brown curly hairs on face and chest.</p>
