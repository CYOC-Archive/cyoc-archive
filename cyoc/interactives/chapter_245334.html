<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Now Greg let’s talk about how I’m going to change your curse” said Sarah Renwick looking at the tired father.<br />
<br />
“Please can’t you just get rid of it. Haven’t I been punished enough. My own little girl just paraded me around on her huge cock like I was a toy and she filled my gut so much that I can barely see my own cock over it” said Greg in a both pleading and incredulous tone, as he was still unsure how everything had changed so fast.<br />
<br />
“Oh Greg that was hardly a punishment with how much you both enjoyed that, even if you won’t admit it to yourself. I don’t intend to remove your curse but don’t think it would be fair for it to involve your daughter anymore, she’s happy as she is now” said Sarah looking towards Sabrina who was laughing with her friends.<br />
<br />
“Now that I think about it, I should have done this from the beginning. Your wife should be the target. Seeing how your daughter enjoys her cock so much I will give your wife one to match, and if she doesn’t like it, the thing will go away once she has mated the pretty ass of yours. Oh and if you cheat on her again her cock will grow or return bigger than it was before.” Explained Sarah.<br />
<br />
“No not my wife. She’ll kill me if she finds out” begged Greg as he imagined his wife Emily standing at the front door with a cock and a rolling pin waiting for him.<br />
<br />
“Too late. It’s done. Good luck sleeping on the couch tonight or getting bent over it” said Sarah as she got up and returned to managing the dance.<br />
<br />
Greg was left there to sit at the table alone and watch the few remaining pairs on the dance floor. Most of them were the pairs that had gotten Sarah to give the daughters cocks like Sabrina’s. The strange dance that they did while carrying their fathers on their cocks did little to dissuade the pairs that were dancing normally besides them. Greg noticed that some of the father’s bellies were bloated like his yet no puddles of cum had fallen to the dance floor.<br />
<br />
A moment later a disturbing realization swept over him. The realization that even though he had been stuffed like a turkey on thanksgiving by his own daughter, his back door had closed up tight. His greedy hole had not let a single drop of his daughter’s hot baby batter escape. A panicked thought swept through Greg’s mind that he would remain like this forever, his cum swollen gut a permanent display of his dominated state. <br />
<br />
“Calm down Greg. Take a deep breath you’re going to be fine. It’s just a basic enchantment on the room to keep things clean” said a younger man who walked up to the panicking Greg.<br />
<br />
”What, who are you, what are you talking about” questioned Greg to the younger man who he thought looked familiar but couldn’t remember who the younger man was.<br />
<br />
”I’m Steve, Sarah’s husband. We met once back when Sarah initially cursed you” answered the younger man taking the seat opposite of Greg.<br />
<br />
”as for what I was talking about. I was just explaining that there is a simple enchantment on the hall that helps prevent big spills to keep things clean. If you’re worried about that belly of yours you just need to leave the hall and use the restroom” continued Steve trying to calm Greg.<br />
<br />
”This is a nightmare how are you so calm and you actually married that witch. You saw her cock and what she could do with it” asked Greg still confused about everything that had happened.<br />
<br />
“You know having a wife with a large cock is actually pretty nice I’m not even gay or bi and I think it’s great. I’m not sure how things will turn out with your wife given the circumstances but I see how you care about your daughter and I feel like you’ll figure something out” answered Steve trying to provide some hope to the bewildered man.<br />
<br />
”I don’t get it why are you being so nice with me I was a jerk back when we first met. What is your motive” asked Greg suspicious of the oddly supportive Steve.<br />
<br />
”Dude that was almost twenty years ago. I’m not about to hold any grudge for that long, and as for why I’m helping you, I would look towards your daughter. Sabrina is a good girl and a great student, and Sarah and I do what we can to support all the students. I know you don’t see Sarah’s curse as any kind of support but trust me if you can reconcile with you wife and this curse I am sure you’ll both be all the better for it” explained Steve in a calm and understanding tone. <br />
<br />
The words didn’t remove Greg’s misgivings about the curse, but they did ease his panic about his future. There was still a pit of smoldering dread at what his wife would do to him once he returned home, but now there was also a glimmer of hope that something good could be possible. <br />
<br />
Steve saw the contemplation on Greg’s face and decided to give him his time to think. Standing up the witch’s husband gave Greg a pat on the shoulder and left to talk with some of the other fathers that had been cum bloated by their daughter’s new cocks. <br />
<br />
Sabrina returned to her father a few minutes later and wanted to continue dancing with him before the dance ended. Greg paled at the thought of being paraded around on Sabrina’s huge cock again, but she insisted she just wanted a normal dance. The young girl then sent her father out to the bathroom to empty himself and get his clothes on. <br />
<br />
Leaving the hall Greg felt the pressure in his gut suddenly begin to press on him and he had to consciously clench himself to prevent a spill. Rushing to the bathroom Greg found a toilet and sat upon it to relieve himself. When he finally let himself expel his daughter’s cum it came out in a spasming torrent as if his ass was jizzing out the cum in orgasm. Unfortunately for Greg it had even felt like an orgasm and he caught himself moaning in pleasure before his stomach returned to its flat state.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later a dressed and collected Greg returned to the hall and found his daughter. They danced practicing the steps that had been taught earlier and when time came for the students and parents to leave Greg was reluctant to go knowing what was most likely waiting for him at home, but it could be held off no more and the two left.</p>

How will Greg be greeted when he returns home?</h3>
