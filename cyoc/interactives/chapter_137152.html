<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At the city pier, right near the Gynoid embassy, a young woman sat on the edge of the boardwalk while staring out towards the ocean, occasionally looking towards the embassy to her left. Her name was Kaiyoko Masuna, she&#39;s 22 years old, and was working towards her doctorate in oceanography, the study of earth&#39;s waters. Since her youth in Tokyo, Japan, she had always been fascinated by the oceans, and the life it contained; its seemingly otherworldly nature and beauty was so enticing, that almost all of her free time was spent either studying what was known about the ocean, or taking a swim. In fact, since she was 7 she always wore a swimsuit under her clothes instead of regular underwear. Along with her constant studies, Kaiyoko was a sort of exercise nut as she spent much of her time in the gym and pool, honing her body for the very purpose of swimming the oceans&#39; depths. By the time she came to America to study at the university, not only was she incredibly adept mentally, but she also had the body of an olympic swimmer. Having excelled in her course, earned her bachelor&#39;s in oceanography, already working towards a PHD, and gained a place on a research team ready to set out for the Pacific within days, Kaiyoko was well on her way to realizing her dream of exploring the world under the seas. <br />
However, while she was happy with exploring the oceans she had read about since childhood, what interested more was the parts of the ocean that weren&#39;t explored; the places that no vessel or diver could reach, due to the extremely high pressure and low visibility, were what excited Kaiyoko the most. She fantasized about being able to explore the, often being disappointed on how it would be impossible within her lifetime. She often wished she could just turn into a mermaid, and just swim out into the depths to her heart&#39;s content; after all, mermaids don&#39;t need to worry about needing air, or extreme pressures. That all changed when the Gynoids first showed up. At first she didn&#39;t know what to think, she wasn&#39;t some xenophobic douchebag like that ones rioting at the embassy early on (the same ones she laughed at when they were doused with itching powder the 9901/Ems), nor was she one of those annoying bloggers who spammed the internet with praises about how the &quot;robotic saviors&quot; were going to make the world a better place (who were quickly forgotten). Even as a few people actually started to get converted into Gynoids, it didn&#39;t have an affect her in the slightest, so she moved on with her studies. Then, she heard a rumor from one of her friends at the university. Apparently a geeky introvert went to the embassy to become a Gynoid, and what came out was something unlike the ones that came before it, a small anthro fox Gynoid that looked cute according to Kaiyoko&#39;s friend. This fox Gynoid, Archivist-2000, had a body that was so tough, so durable, that it could potentially withstand a nuclear explosion without a scratch. That last part got Kaiyoko&#39;s attention. If a body like 2000&#39;s could survive something like that, then it could also survive the crushing depths of the ocean floor, and if she recalled, Gynoids don&#39;t really need to breathe air. It was then that she set a new goal, she would get a position in the next expedition out to the Atlantic, convince said expedition team to head for the Challenger Deep, where no man has ever managed to reach the bottom of, get her parents&#39; permission to carry out her plans, and finally to carry out her plan: become a Gynoid that specializes in deep sea exploration. She managed to get a spot in the expedition team, convinced the team leader to try and change his plans (provided that Kaiyoko actually goes through with her conversion), and getting her parent&#39;s blessing was fairly easy; her parents were proud that she managed to attain her dreams, and just want her to be happy. That leads her to the city pier today, sitting at the edges of the boardwalk, looking towards the Gynoid embassy, and then her reflection in the water below. <br />
&#39;This is the last time I&#39;ll look like this,&#39; Kaiyoko thought, &quot;the last time I&#39;ll call myself Kaiyoko Masuna, the last time I&#39;ll wear clothes, probably, and the last time I&#39;ll see myself as human.&#39; She got up to her feet, and took a deep breath, her mind made up, &#39;no turning back now.&#39;<br />
<br />
At the embassy, 9901/Ems was busy comforting a distraught Archivist-2000.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t cry, sister,&quot; 9901 said, hugging 2000, &quot;It&#39;s just a movie.&quot;<br />
&quot;Just a movie?!&quot; 2000 cried, &quot;This movie made me feel so many conflicting emotions, and it&#39;s driving me crazy!&quot;<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; 9901 said, &quot;I saw this movie with you, remember?&quot;<br />
&quot;I do, 9901,&quot; 2000 replied, &quot;I have a good memory, I&#39;m an archivist!&quot;<br />
&quot;I admit, it was a sad ending,&quot; 9901 commented.<br />
&quot;They killed off half of the main characters in the saddest way possible, and the villain won!&quot; 2000 cried, &quot;It was a punch to the face after so many great things happened! I can&#39;t hate this movie for it&#39;s ending because it was so good, and its technically not over, and I have to wait until next year for the second half of the story! It pisses me off!&quot;<br />
 9901 thought.<br />
At that moment the embassy&#39;s doors opened, and a young woman walked into the lobby, immediately noticing a stressed 9901 holding a distraught 2000 with tears in her eyes. <br />
&quot;Um, Kon&#39;nichiwa,&quot; Kaiyoko said, looking confused, &quot;am I interrupting something.&quot;<br />
&quot;No! No you&#39;re not,&quot; 9901 said, slightly flustered as she and 2000 quickly let go of each other and composed themselves, &quot;I was just comforting 2000 here over a movie we saw.&quot;<br />
&quot;The new movie that came out last month?&quot; Kaiyoko asked, the two Gynoids nodding, &quot;yeah I know the feeling.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; said 9901, &quot;So what brings you here, miss...?&quot;<br />
&quot;Kaiyko,&quot; Kaiyoko replied, bowing towards the Gynoids, &quot;Kaiyoko Masuna, I&#39;m here to become a Gynoid, one that specializes in underwater exploration.&quot;<br />
Upon hearing this 9901 smiled, Immediately realizing what this newcomer could be. Acting quickly, she left the lobby, both to get 602/Eng, and to prepare the paperwork and conversion chamber.<br />
&quot;I take it you&#39;re the reason the local university&#39;s expedition to Pacific was moved to the Challenger Deep, correct?&quot; 2000 inquired.<br />
&quot;I am,&quot; Kaiyoko replied, &quot;how did you know?&quot;<br />
&quot;I often scour the internet to gather and archive data,&quot; 2000 explained, &quot;I came across the interesting information about the expedition, and the possibility of a Gynoid taking part in it. Your request reminded me of that interesting detail.&quot;<br />
&quot;I guess that makes sense,&quot; Kaiyoko commented, &quot;you know 2000 san, I wouldn&#39;t think of doing this if I hadn&#39;t heard of you, and your durability.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; 2000 asked, her cute ears perked up, and her robotic tail wagging back and forth.<br />
&quot;Really,&quot; Kaiyoko confirmed, &quot;a body like yours can easily withstand the pressure of the ocean floor.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why thank you miss Kaiyoko,&quot; 2000 said happily when she suddenly froze before saying, &quot;They&#39;re ready for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaiyoko and 2000 entered the room with the conversion chamber a minute later. Engineer 602 was preparing the &quot;beanbag&quot;, while 9901 helped Kaiyoko fill out all of the necessary paperwork.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going to be something very special to this world and the sisterhood,&quot; 9901 said, &quot;you will become a part of the Scout Caste.&quot;<br />
&quot;Scout Caste?&quot; Kaiyoko asked, signing the last of the paperwork.<br />
&quot;A scout while usually physically identical to Gynoids of other castes, they have the same durability has the archivists,&quot; 9901 explained, &quot;like the engineers and artisans, scouts often work with archivists, exploring all sorts of places, collecting data, and making discoveries that no organic life form could. Scouts navigate all forms of terrain, and use their optical cameras to record what they see for the archivists that accompany them, as well as for the rest of the sisterhood to behold.&quot;<br />
&quot;And considering your profession, I&#39;ve set up a special surprise for you,&quot; 602/Eng said with a smug look.<br />
With that said, and the paperwork finished, Kaiyoko undressed until the only thing she had on was her swimsuit. laying down on the &quot;beanbag&quot; the chamber was sealed, and the machinery activated. As the &quot;beanbag&quot; turned semi-solid and she sunk into the silvery goo Kaiyoko quickly felt her body change. As her skin began to change into thick, heavy, metallic gold, her organs turned into the machinery and computers required for her new functions, all of which was waterproofed, fireproofed, and made highly durable, and across her body blue lights appeared to further distinguish her status as a member of the scout caste. As the last of her organic components were converted, something unexpected to her happened. Her legs were soon drawn together, fusing into a single mass, her feet turning into fins with blue hard light holographic edges. Meanwhile, as hard light holgraphic webbing appeared between her fingers, her hips grew a pair of small fins, while a large fin appeared on her back, each one gaining their own blue holographic edges. To complete her transformation her eyes finished changing into the unique optical units that all scouts possess, while what was once her nose sunk into her face, leaving a flat, smooth, streamlined look, unlike other Gynoids on Earth who still have a small bump meant to look like a nose.<br />
As the chamber opened the Gynoid formerly known as Kaiyoko Masuna pulled herself out from the &quot;beanbag&quot;, something immediately activated in her body, and as she left the chamber she realized she was floating about a foot from the ground. A rundown of her systems quickly told her that she had special anti-grav generators throughout her body, allowing her to move about freely without the need for legs. Seconds later, everything around the new Gynoid slowed down as she was connected to the rest of the sisterhood. As all of her new sister welcomed her, she could see all of the other members of the Scout Caste like, like 392388/Sct, who was with 311547/Arc, on a distant planet observing a worldwide volcanic event. With the love from all of her new system, all the new Gynoid could feel was pure happiness. She wasn&#39;t Kaiyoko Masuna anymore, but Scout 001120-250-400950, or simply 950/Sct.<br />
&quot;Welcome to the sisterhood, 950,&quot; 9901 and 2000 said in unison.<br />
&quot;Doro Arigato, sisters,&quot; 950 said, wiping the tears in her eyes.<br />
<br />
*Days later*<br />
<br />
&quot;See anything yet?&quot; Dr. Jefferson asked.<br />
&quot;Nothing yet Doc,&quot; Albert answered looking through his binoculars. <br />
&quot;Fine keep me posted,&quot; Jefferson said, slightly frustrated.<br />
It took a lot of convincing (and some begging) on his part to get everyone to agree with Miss Masuna&#39;s request to move the expedition to the Challenger Deep. Having arrived at their destination over the Deep, the crew of the research ship and the expedition team had already spent two days sending their research sub as deep as it will go, which is nowhere near the bottom of the Deep, and study what they can. Jefferson himself yelling in head about how he passed up a chance to study the recently active underwater volcano at his teams original destination for a grandiose expedition to uncharted territory, only to be left hanging. &#39;I swear to Christ,&#39; he thought, &#39;if Masuna doesn&#39;t show up by tomorrow IN A CHROME BODY, I&#39;m gonna blow!&#39;<br />
&quot;Doctor, you may want to see this,&quot; one of the interns called out.<br />
Jefferson hurried over to the intern at the sonar station. &quot;This better be good Lexi,&quot; He said sternly.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s good, Doctor,&quot; Lexi said, &quot;something small just appeared on the sonar, and it headed right towards us fast.&quot;<br />
Immediately surprised, Jefferson called everyone over, and was watching feverishly at the sonar&#39;s monitor. &quot;What&#39;s the depth?&quot; he asked.<br />
&quot;Hard to tell,&quot; Lexi replied, &quot;the anomaly keeps changing depth and shifting left and right.&quot;<br />
&quot;A torpedo?&quot; intern Audrey asked nervously.<br />
&quot;At that range, doubtful,&quot; Lexi replied, &quot;besides, who would want to blow ups up out here?&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s almost here,&quot; Quentin said feverishly, &quot;brace yourselves.&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not a torpedo!&quot; Jefferson sputtered, when suddenly a splash was heard from over the ships side.<br />
From the water below came a golden figure with blue lights across her body, almost like an angel, but instead of wings on her back, she had a tail in place of her legs and fins on her back and hips. The gold and blue robo-mermaid landed onto the ships deck in front of the flabbergasted crew and scientist, only instead of a loud thud, she hovered about a foot above the deck. <br />
&quot;Kon&#39;nichiwa, Jefferson Senpai,&quot; the fishlike Gynoid said bowing to the doctor. &quot;I&#39;m sorry for being so late, I didn&#39;t want to burden anyone with bring me here, so I took the long way around by sea. I had to stop and float across the surface to recharge my batteries by solar energy, which kept me from getting here yesterday.&quot;<br />
&quot;Umm, Miss Masuna?&quot; Jefferson asked with a dumb look on her face, although not as ridiculous as Audrey&#39;s, considering she&#39;s a huge mermaid fan.<br />
&quot;I was,&quot; The Gynoid said sternly, but soon became composed and smiled, &quot;but now I go by Scout 400950 now, you can just call me 950 from now on. Now that I&#39;m here, lets go make scientific history.&quot;</p>
