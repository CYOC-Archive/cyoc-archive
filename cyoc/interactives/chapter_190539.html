<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You leave Josh wondering how exactly you&#39;re going to help him, and go inside to do your homework. The rest of the day passes quickly, as you imagine different ways to use the wand to help your friend overcome the bully. An obvious solution is just to bulk up Josh like you did Willy. But you kind of what to try something different. Something that will both help your nerdy friend and further test the wand&#39;s limits.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it!&quot;<br />
<br />
You&#39;re eating dinner, and your parents and little sister Julie look at you strangely.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s it, sport?&quot; your dad inquires.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...&quot; You think fast, not wanting to tell your family that you picked up a <i>bona fide</i> magic wand. Whether they believed you or not, you did not want to deal with that hassle. &quot;Just realised the solution to a problem from school.&quot; Not exactly a lie.<br />
<br />
Though was it a good solution? You were getting hard just thinking about it -- and you had some misgivings that maybe your hormones were pushing you to something foolish. But... being a hot girl would help Josh a lot, wouldn&#39;t it? Not just with Craig, but with friends and... stuff in general.<br />
<br />
You think about it the rest of the evening, secluding yourself in your room. It makes sense to you. Craig wouldn&#39;t beat up a sexy girl, you&#39;re pretty sure, and... man, you really can&#39;t wait to see how hot your friend looks.<br />
<br />
Besides, if Josh really doesn&#39;t like it, you can always turn her -- him -- back. Right?<br />
<br />
You fall asleep with your hands in your underwear. You wake up in the middle of the night, hands and underwear wet and sticky, your mind still feverish with visions of Josh as a hot, horny babe.<br />
<br />
~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br />
<br />
For once you actually arrive at school early. You head straight for the second floor. There you find Josh waiting in the library -- pacing the reading area, his face drawn with apprehension.<br />
<br />
&quot;I stopped coming to the library early because Craig always came for me here,&quot; he tells you as you enter. &quot;This had better be good. And quick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; you say, flashing a smile. You&#39;ve convinced yourself that this is a brilliant idea, and that it will work. From your backpack you produce the wand. &quot;This is answer to all your problems!&quot;<br />
<br />
He stares at it dubiously. &quot;Blake... how is a toy wand...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not a toy!&quot; you assure him. &quot;I&#39;ve already tested it! Watch!&quot;<br />
<br />
You level the wand at him and press the button, hastily invoking the notion of &quot;sexy girl.&quot; Seconds pass as the wand collates data from both its user and its target, defining the concept of &quot;sexy&quot; to be used in the transformation. You&#39;re starting to worry that something has gone wrong -- and Josh is getting visibly impatient -- when finally a blue beam shoots forth. It hits the other boy square in the chest.<br />
<br />
A chest that rapidly fills out, straining Josh&#39;s vest and shirt with two very large, very round boobs. The boy gasps, his eyes dropping, his hands flying up but stopping shy of touching the new assets. &quot;What --&quot; His voice cracks and he chokes as the changes spread out from his core. With his shirt riding up, you can see his skinny abdomen firm up and take on a light tan. Below it his hips flare out, child-bearing fat threatening to burst the seams of his jeans.<br />
<br />
His legs follow, the jeans awkwardly molding to the long, curvy limbs. His arms reshape, becoming firmer, the dark hair replaced by more of that smooth tan. His hands become long-fingered and delicate.<br />
<br />
Your eyes flip back and forth between his crotch and his face as the last -- and most major -- changes take effect. The growing bulge in his tight pants abruptly reverses course, fading away as Josh groans, letting his slim hands go to his changing genitals. He almost tries to work one past his tight waistband as he feels his balls vanish into a hot, wet cave; but then he remembers he has an audience and settles for just clutching at his new womanhood through his clothing.<br />
<br />
The changes to his face, while secondary, are no less impressive. He goes from looking skinny to refined. His lips plump a bit, his eyelashes grow out, his eyes become a sharper shade of blue. His glasses slip out of place as his nose adjusts to complement his aristocratic femininity. Even his hair shifts slightly, from plain brown to a healthy lustrous chestnut; and growing out, side locks brushing his shoulders as the rest falls to his mid-back.<br />
<br />
Unseen, the alien technology also tweaks at Josh&#39;s brain. Not just wiring it for female functionality, but also ramping up his libido and his dominance as high as they will go. Both of you, insecure teenage boys that you were, find strong women sexy; and the wand does its best to nudge Josh in that direction.<br />
<br />
It takes less than a minute, and a brunette bombshell is standing in the place of the lanky nerd. Despite the sex change, Josh is still tall -- in fact you think he -- or she -- is taller than you now. Even with her flustered expression, and the ill-fitting clothing, she is easily the most alluring thing you have ever seen -- as attested by the sudden erotic pressure of your dick trying to escape its cloth prison.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my gosh,&quot; you whisper. &quot;J-Josh... you&#39;re... you&#39;re... <i>wow.</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh stares at you a moment, blushing and wide-eyed. Then he tilts his head down agaub, his new breasts filling his vision. His glasses slip unheeded from his ears to clatter to the floor. Pulling his hands from his groin, Josh cups his boobs tentatively, almost afraid of provoking any sensation. The transformation had been a surge of warmth, almost dizzying but not unpleasant. Now he feels a strange tingle running through him. It was... like arousal... no. It <i>was</i> arousal, just... different. And somehow -- much more intense, and not just because it seemed spread throughout his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;What have you... done to me?&quot; His voices catches a bit as he registers the change in tone -- higher, breathier, and subtly commanding despite the interrogative. He looks back up at you. For the moment, confusion takes precedence over other emotions. &quot;A... woman? You turned me a woman?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah.&quot; You swallow, so turned on that you&#39;re almost over-awed. &quot;I figured... Craig wouldn&#39;t pick on you like this...&quot;<br />
<br />
Speak of the Devil. Just as you say the name, you hear heavy footsteps on the stairs outside. You both know instinctively that Craig is on his way, looking for his favourite chewtoy.<br />
<br />
Without thinking you fire the wand at Josh again, this time intending to fix her wardrobe. Her shirt shrinks under her vest and disappears, becoming a bra that pushes up her bust further. The vest itself morphs into a dark green blouse, as revealing as school rules will allow. Her jeans become tight, now truly molded to her voluptuous lower body. Feeling the clothing fit itself and further enhance her sexy frame draws another moan from Josh.<br />
<br />
The changes end, her sock now merged with her briefs to form pantyhose, while her shoes have morphed into polished heels. Out of nowhere, red gloss appears on her lips, a touch of shadow highlights her eyes, and her nails acquire a pink finish.<br />
<br />
The footsteps approach the library door. You look around, frantically trying to decide if you should hide and where. You want to have a good view of the confrontation, but you&#39;re not eager for Craig to see the wand. Meanwhile Josh is surreptitiously feeling herself over, building an image of her new body in her mind as she feels a lustful hunger building.</p>
