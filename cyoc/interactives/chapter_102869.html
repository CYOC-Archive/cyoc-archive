<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You&#39;re certain you overheard him talk about gang activity?&quot; Theodore asked to George and Caroline Ulysses, &quot;Did he say where in Seattle? Or what time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that we could overhear,&quot; Caroline said weakly, &quot;and this was years ago, he might not even be with them anymore. But he did promise to meet up with them every Sunday in Seattle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Theodore Green sighed heavily. It wouldn&#39;t be much of a lead, and they weren&#39;t certain if Lionel Ulysses was even still involved with that gang, but it might be something. He&#39;d need to talk with the Seattle office and coordinate with the Seattle Police Department to arrange for observing the known gang groups in the city for any past sightings. For the moment, it would mean leaving Moon Lake to check things over, though he did have some other options he wished to try and see if there were any other avenues of approach to get an idea on where Lionel Ulysses was, if he wasn&#39;t in Seattle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know of anyone else in Moon Lake that might have heard from him?&quot; Agent Green asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Afraid not,&quot; George commented, looking very much like a depressed and disappointed father. Theodore assumed that George and Caroline Ulysses both loved their son, as only parents could, but were saddened by how far he had fallen. &quot;Most of the guys that he ended up running with at first came out of Seattle. They came into Moon Lake to party and likely avoid the police in Seattle, and when the heat went down, they left.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry you&#39;ve had to go through with all of this,&quot; Agent Green sighed and politely excused himself and began to mentally began going over a checklist of things to do while he was in Moon Lake. They included: 1) meet with the town&#39;s Chancellor to discuss the private matters that related to his relationship with Marci and the possibility of them moving to Moon Lake when it came time for them to retire... assuming he couldn&#39;t find a good reason to transfer to the Seattle field office, 2) Talk with the police chief again and let him know that he&#39;d gotten all that he figured he could get, and might lead to Lionel Ulysses capture, though also having the warning that he might pass through Moon Lake on his way to Seattle, and 3) Meet with the Decker family and let them know that he finally had some breaks in the case, and to urge them to beware that the suspect might come through Moon Lake while in route to another location, and that if they see anything to at least notify the local police. &quot;And then will come all the work in Seattle to see if Ulysses has returned there periodically every Sunday and with which gang.&quot;<br />
<br />
Theodore knew it would be a long day if he was to be ready for tomorrow.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jen and Tad were going through with their own agenda for the day. Jen had let Tad meet his paternal grandparents the day before, and now, she wished to introduce him to her parents, her mothers, Vivian and Karen Teller. Once they&#39;d finished breakfast, they were soon driving along until they came to a small and modest home that was across the street from the high school. Tad actually marveled at that as Jen pulled up to park on the street in front of her mother&#39;s house.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... this is where you grew up, mom?&quot; Tad wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, this was the house,&quot; Jen smiled, &quot;where I grew up happy and healthy with the two best mothers a werecat could have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you have to ride the bus the school?&quot; Tad teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very funny, dear,&quot; Jen said shaking her head as she began to get out of the car.<br />
<br />
They made their way up to the door and rang a small doorbell that was to the right of the door. Some of the paint looked a bit old, but it was still in fairly good condition. Tad hear a faint &quot;I got it, dear&quot; come from inside the house. The door opened and a blond haired woman appeared in the doorway. She looked at Jen, smiled and then came forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen! It&#39;s great to see you! Oh, it&#39;s been so long!&quot; the woman almost cheered. She barely looked older than Jen and Tad could smell the scent of werecat on her, but he remained in quite awe as the woman hugged his mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, mom,&quot; Jen replied and hugged the woman back, &quot;it&#39;s actually good to be back.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two backed away and Jen moved to introduce the woman who had come out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tad, this is one of my moms,&quot; Jen introduced, &quot;Tad, meet Vivian Teller.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; Tad said weekly, his eyes still rather wide.<br />
<br />
The woman, Vivian Teller, didn&#39;t miss a beat. She turned pulled the young werewolf into a hug and proceeded to tell him that he&#39;d grown so much since she&#39;d last seen him, and again made reference to Tad being in diapers at that time. The woman even purred after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... uh... you may see a bit more of me and mom from time to time,&quot; Tad commented as Vivian finally let him go, &quot;we moved back in a few days ago. Had my first day of school on Thursday...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll watch for you,&quot; Vivian smiled.<br />
<br />
Tad didn&#39;t entirely know what to make of that, nor was he yet fully sure on what to make of Vivian Teller. While she looked rather young, which was expected for many werebeasts, he wasn&#39;t quite sure on what to make of her attire. Unlike Jen, who Tad felt was dressed rather normally, Vivian was dressed flamboyantly in a way. She was barefoot, but had large fuzzy leg warmers that went from her ankles to her knees that were gray in color. She wore what looked like a skin tight yellow body suit and a turquoise green leotard over that. A red, white, and blue headband held back her blond hair from her face. Tad wasn&#39;t quite sure that was the sort of attire he expected to see when he met his grandmother.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think your workout clothes have broken him, mom,&quot; Jen commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s not my fault,&quot; Vivian answered, &quot;You know I always do my cardio workouts and yoga exercises on Saturday mornings. It cleanses the soul and gets Karen interested...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I remember growing up to you doing &quot;sweating to the oldies&quot; and then taking mom into your bedroom,&quot; Jen remembered, &quot;but Tad doesn&#39;t know that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; Vivian shrugged and then turned to Tad, &quot;well, young one, every Saturday I do a nice active workout to help burn fat, keep in shape, and release all the old stresses of the week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And... that&#39;s...?&quot; Tad began looking to Vivian&#39;s outfit again.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was all the rage when I bought it!&quot; Vivian answered, &quot;Come in! Come in!&quot;<br />
<br />
Vivian then lead them into a small entryway. It had hall that sort of formed a U from which to go. To the left, Tad thought he saw what looked like a bedroom or a bathroom door. To the right he saw what looked like a living room, and he could hear oldies rock music playing softly in the background with a woman&#39;s saying, &quot;and twist and bend and twist and bend&quot; over and over again. Clearly the exercise tape that Vivian had been playing. Vivian lead them into that living room and picked up a remote that was seated on an end table next to a old, but well maintained, fiber couch. Vivian turned off her tape and then called to another room, which Tad could see a small table through the doorless portal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Karen! Come see who just got here!&quot; Vivian called.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know who it is, dear,&quot; came another voice as a woman with black hair came around the corner. Unlike Vivian, the new woman was dressed a bit more casually with a brown shirt, that while it hugged her curves closely, wasn&#39;t tight enough to be uncomfortable or make it look like she was trying to entice someone. She also wore a gray skirt that came down to her knees  and hung loosely. Tad also noted that this woman looked a bit like Jen, not exactly, but there were some features in his mom that this women, Karen Teller, had as well. &quot;Hello, Jen, it&#39;s good to see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen approached Tad, and again Tad found himself being pulled into a firm hug, &quot;You must be Tad. Oh... you look just like your father!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen smiled as her birth mother hugged her son. Eventually, Tad did hug her back. Tad did give a polite thank you. They broke apart for a moment, while Vivian and Karen sat down on the couch, and pulled Tad in to sit beside Karen. Tad heard both of them give contented purrs at being close to him. Jen, meanwhile, moved to sit in a easy chair that was along a different wall from the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how&#39;s the move in gone, dear?&quot; Karen asked to Jen once they were all seated, &quot;You two make it in okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, mom,&quot; Jen replied, &quot;Tad was a big help, and even a local neighbor even volunteered to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad smiled at the mention of Amy, though not without drawing some attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is she cute?&quot; Vivian asked to Tad.<br />
<br />
&quot;What... she...?&quot; Tad caught himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;You smiled at the mention of a neighbor coming to help,&quot; Vivian commented, &quot;I can only assume that that neighbor is a girl you like...&quot;<br />
<br />
Caught, Tad decided to answer fully, &quot;Yeah, I did meet someone. Amy Howler, made the contacts to let me join Austin Perry&#39;s pack... and we... we did start dating.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s good,&quot; Vivian gave a smile, &quot;I hope that the two of you have plenty of fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So far, things have been good,&quot; Tad admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s good,&quot; Karen said to him and rubbed his shoulder, &quot;You&#39;ll find that we&#39;re a pretty tight community here. Hopefully you&#39;ll make plenty of friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen then turned her attention to Jen for a moment, &quot;and how have you been doing, Jen? With regard to... everything?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen gave a sigh, as this was probably a question on how she was coping with Jeff&#39;s death. Her mothers had known how much she had loved him and had given their consent for Jeff to date Jen very quickly. They had loved Jen dearly and always wanted Jen to be happy. The saddest and most heart-wrenching moment that Karen had ever felt with Vivian was when Jen had called them, in tears, to say that Jeff had been murdered and that neither she nor Vivian could go and hug Jen and pour as much motherly love as they could into Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m doing as well as I can,&quot; Jen answered, &quot;I&#39;ve come &quot;home&quot; as it were and the FBI are looking for the nut-job that took my husband from me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re glad to have you &quot;home,&quot; dear,&quot; Vivian said softly, &quot;Karen and I will always be here for you if you need anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, mom,&quot; Jen commented, &quot;I may take you up on that, but things will get better. Once the murder is caught and punished, he&#39;ll be gone... and I&#39;ve got some weekly sessions lined up with Doctor Twist for therapy regarding... everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;s good,&quot; Karen commented, &quot;I&#39;m sure things will be set right and you&#39;ll do well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope so,&quot; Jen commented.</p>
