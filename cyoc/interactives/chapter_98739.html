<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan ate quickly, he wondered if Jeff and Dave had woke up yet, he was dying to know what was happening over at their place. The twins were coming down for breakfast, Aaron looked like he was struggling that morning. Their father stared at them, the kind of stare that drills into you. He had taken in the scene and clearly figured out what had happened. &quot;Have fun last night, guys?&quot; he asked in an accusing tone.  &quot;Yeah&quot; Mike replied, he was clearly going to be the spokes person for them during this cross-examination. &quot;I hope not too much fun,&quot; their father continued, &quot;because you&#39;re going to clean out the barn today, its been too long.&quot; Mike locked eyes with his father, and what would have been a 5 minute argument  happened in less than a second. Their father&#39;s stern angry look let the twins know they weren&#39;t fooling anyone and that playing dumb or denying it would not help them.  &quot;Alright, the three of us will get on it after breakfast&quot; Mike said defeated. Before Ryan could even object their father did for him, &quot;No, just you two&quot; he said maintaining his stare right at Aaron, who looked like cleaning the barn and the smells associated with it might kill him.  This was Ryan&#39;s chance, &quot;Dad if its alright with you, I was going to go over to Jeff&#39;s house to...,&quot; Ryan started before he had even come up with a reason why. An &quot;Ok&quot; cut him off and without wasting any more time he washed his bowl at the sink and headed out across the field to the small farm house on the far side of the family land. <br />
<br />
  Ryan was giddy with excitement. He repeated, &quot;Play it cool, play it cool&quot; over and over in his head. He went back and forth on whether he&#39;d pretend like he didn&#39;t even notice the changes to Ryan, or if they were freaking out join in and encourage it. As he approached their house he saw his uncle (Jeff&#39;s father) in the field on his tractor fertilizing the field.  Their car was gone, so he assumed that their mother and sisters were in town working the early shift at the diner.  Ryan let himself in the house, the families had always had an &#39;open door&#39; policy, so much so that Ryan had to remind himself to knock when he went to other peoples houses.  They were still in bed, this was perfect, he was going to get to see it from the beginning. As he walked through the kitchen he saw a note on their fridge, &quot;Jeff Dave: You are grounded.&quot; So, no one was getting away with drinking last night. He headed down the hallway towards the room the boys shared, he paused at the door, closed his eyes took a deep breath and knocked (it was a bedroom after all). &quot;Whose there&quot; Jeff responded, sounded disoriented. &quot;Its Ryan, can I come in&quot; Ryan said as flatly as he could.  He could hear some murmuring behind the door Dave must be up now too, &quot; Sure&quot; Jeff answered back. Ryan opened the door and stepped in.  <br />
<br />
  The room was tiny, it had originally been a large closet before they converted it into a bedroom for Jeff and Dave.  The two twin beds were side by side with about a foot between them.  There were two dressers at the foot of each bed against the wall the door was on.  That morning the room had an odor that seemed to hang in the air.  There was a puddle puke on the floor with some trailing chunks leading up the bed on the left to Dave. Two days ago this would have been enough vindication for Ryan, but this was not two days ago, Ryan now had other options open to him.  &quot;Whats up dude?&quot; Jeff asked sleepily from bed.  He was laying on his back, covered with blankets, using the nook of his elbow to cover his eyes. Dave was laying on his stomach with his head at the edge of the bed, the comforter had been kicked off the end. He was completely undressed except for a pair of briefs. &quot; I wanted to stop by and&quot; Ryan started, trying to nonchalantly check Dave for the changes, &quot;and apologize.&quot; It had come to Ryan in a flash of brilliance, &quot;for last night, I hope I didn&#39;t embarrass you two in front of your friends.&quot; &quot;Its fine man&quot; Jeff replied taking his elbow off his face to look around. &quot;Ahh Dave, come on man, you yacked all over the floor man&quot; Jeff announced. A &quot;Sorry, I&#39;ll clean it up&quot; slipped sleepily from Dave&#39;s mouth.  &quot;I saw a note on the fridge, looks like you guys are grounded&quot; Ryan chimed in. That woke them both up. &quot;Ugh!&quot; Jeff exclaimed, &quot;could you do me a favor and get me the cleaning bucket from under the sink?&quot; Ryan headed to the kitchen and got the bucket, he was a little ashamed, he half expected Jeff to be, well &#39;gayer&#39;. He reminded himself that what he was expecting was a stereotype. He grabbed the bucket and headed back to the room.  When he got back to the room, they were in the same positions as when he left.  &quot;Who wants this?&quot; Ryan asked gesturing with the bucket. Dave said he&#39;d take it and started to get up, he rolled over, sat up, and reached for the bucket. <br />
<br />
  The change was visibly noticeable. Ryan had to fight to keep the biggest grin off his face. What once had been a nice six pack of abs was now a smooth stomach. It wasn&#39;t a huge gut, but maybe Ryan would change that later. Dave scratched it with his free hand as he sat in bed. He noticed the absence of the abs and his new found fat. He looked at it for a while. &quot;Everything all right?&quot; Ryan asked with mock concern. &quot;Yea, I shouldn&#39;t drink like that anymore, its messing with my body&quot; Dave replied.  He stood up put the bucket on this bed and stretched. Jeff rolled his eyes then looked at Ryan, &quot;here he goes, every morning, any chance he gets where he can show off, do you have to wear those tight underwear.&quot; Dave got a big grin on his face, &quot;Dude I&#39;ve seen your flag pole flying high so many mornings, you can&#39;t even talk, but no I don&#39;t need to wear these underwear.&quot; At the end of his sentence, Dave pulled down his briefs and threw them at his dresser.  Jeff looked away but Ryan looked right Dave&#39;s crotch. It was exactly as he had entered into the Chronivac. It looked like a french fry sticking out from his body.  Ryan let out a giggle and covered his mouth, this drew Jeff&#39;s attention forcing him to look at his brothers naked body.  Dave was dumbfounded, he kept staring at his new little dick.  Exposure to the cool air made it start to shrink up a little which made Dave even more alarmed, it was getting smaller. &quot;Have you been stuffing your underwear?&quot; Jeff demanded. &quot;Noo noo&quot; Dave stammered, &quot;it it shrunk, can it do that?&quot; He looked at Ryan pleadingly, Ryan couldn&#39;t stop himself from smiling, &quot;I don&#39;t know man, but put something on, I&#39;m tired of seeing it.&quot; Dave grabbed the briefs he had just taken off from the dresser and put them back on. &quot;Suddenly seeing my &#39;flag pole&#39; isn&#39;t so bad, huh, big brother&quot; Jeff retorted, &quot;were you jealous, is that why you decided to give yourself a little extra size.&quot;  Dave was confused and startled by this turn of events, he stood there with his hands down his pants tugging on his dick trying to get it to grow back to its once impressive size.  Jeff reached under the covers and grabbed the band of his boxers pulling them up so he could look down on his unit. &quot;Hear that fella,&quot; he started, &quot;looks like you&#39;re the big burrito around here.&quot; His voice caught a little on &#39;here&#39;. Ryan could tell that he had just seen the change wasn&#39;t limited to Dave.  He stared at his penis. Dave grabbed the blanket  and pulled it and the sheet off Jeff.  He grabbed Jeff&#39;s boxers and pulled them down exposing Jeff&#39;s even tinier dick but large balls.  Jeff started trying Dave&#39;s method and pulled on it, hoping that it would grown back.  At this point Ryan was laughing hard. Between gasp he managed to get out, &quot;if you two are just going to sit here and play with yourselves, I&#39;m leaving.&quot; He left the house and walked home, laughing the entire way.</p>
