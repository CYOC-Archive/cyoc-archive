<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Leah was whimpering as she tried to hide behind the car door, an obvious wet stain expanding on the front of he jeans. She looked up at TIna with a massive blush covering from her ears to her neck, violently suckling her binky. <br />
&quot;I-I couldn&#39;t hold it, it just came out!&quot; She stuttered in an embarrassed ramble. She grunts as she grabs her tummy, and crouches forward with a little toot. Tears started to building in her eyes as the unmistakable sound of squelching and hissing filled the air.<br />
&quot;Oh, Leah.&quot; Tina cooed sympathetically. She knew Leah would have an accident, but didn&#39;t think it&#39;d be this nasty---in public, too. It&#39;s one of the worst ways to introduce her to the toddler life. She looked around, spying if anyone were in view. Luckily, with Leah being home so early, everyone was at work or school.<br />
&quot;Come on, let&#39;s get you inside!&quot; Tina waved with her hand, reaching out with the hopes Leah would grab it. She didn&#39;t, of course (to her disappointment) but she started stumbling forward. A cute little series of farts came out as Leah tried to hold back, but there was already a visible brown bulge. She could still feel and hold it, but the ability is diminished significantly. For Leah however, it seemed even more diminished than a regular toddler; the girl was already very accident prone for a teen, so Tina supposed it was inevitable she&#39;d be less potty trained as a toddler.<br />
Luckily, she kept enough control to make it to the bathroom without making a big mess. She shut Tina out, of course, but the woman stood by in the case she needed help. Leah eventually exited, tears in her yes and shameful blush covering her face. She was wearing a towel over her waist to be decent, but Tina could see the soiled pants and panties in the corner---they were absolutely ruined. <br />
&quot;I-I couldn&#39;t stop it. It just came out.&quot; Leah said in a shaky voice, on the verge of breaking down. It truly was a hit to her self image; she might&#39;ve believed Tina about the disease, but it&#39;s only know that it feels truly real.<br />
&quot;Oh Leah, it&#39;s fine! At least it happened at home and not at school.&quot; Tina put on her best reassuring voice, the one she uses for toddlers upset at accidents, &quot;We knew this was going to happen eventually. At least now it won&#39;t be a surprise anymore. Let&#39;s get you cleaned up and see about putting you in some protection.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not a fucking child, Tina, I just shit myself! This isn&#39;t normal!&quot; The teen snapped, catching Tina off guard, &quot;I don&#39;t care if I&#39;m turning into a toddler, that&#39;s not an excuse to treat me like one!&quot;<br />
Her face creased into a scowl, anger boiling under the surface. She looks at her ruined pants and grabs her head in distress. Tina furrowed her brow in concern, but also a little frustration.<br />
&quot;Leah, I just want to help-&quot;<br />
&quot;No, you just want to live out your fantasy of diapering me and treating me like the baby you never had! That&#39;s ALL you&#39;ve ever wanted!&quot; The girl screamed, emotion spiking from 5 to 10 in a heartbeat, &quot;God, of all the things to happen, it has to be this, and it has to be with you! I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if you planned this! All you want is for me to be your perfect little plaything, and then get all pissy when I don&#39;t want to be around you!&quot;<br />
Tina couldn&#39;t hide her offense any longer, mouth agape at such aggressive language. Where had this come from? &quot;Watch your mouth, young lady! I am your-&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;re my what, Tina?! Go on, finish those words!&quot; Leah glared at the woman, and she found herself actually stumbling on he words. What is she to Leah? Because despite their legal relationship, Tina is hardly the girl&#39;s mother, and she knows even trying to brooch the subject is like entering a mine field. <br />
&quot;I...am just trying to help, Leah.&quot; She eventually answered, trying to keep her voice level, &quot;I know the circumstances are not great, but that doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t make the best of a bad situation.&quot;<br />
&quot;You seem really ready to put a positive spin on this, don&#39;t you? Cause you&#39;re not the one pissing herself in the driveway. Can you take a second and think outside of your diaper obsession for a few moments to think about how I feel? How humiliating that was? How I have to lose a month of school because of some stupid sickness?&quot; Leah took a breath from her rant, taking enough of a pause that she replaced her pacifier. She looks genuinely angry before ripping it out.<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t even stop sucking this thing! Everyone already looks at me like a preschooler, and now I&#39;m forced to play the part! It&#39;s...it&#39;s...&quot; Her angry scowl gives way to a quivering lip, heat tears trailing down her face, &quot;Why? Why is this happening? Why does the world hate me so much?&quot;<br />
Tina&#39;s frustration starts to shift ever so slightly to guilt. Why was Tina doing this? Because it&#39;s clearly not for Leah&#39;s sake. As hurtful as her rant was...it was entirely true: Tina did plan this, and was enjoying this, and the teen was a helpless victim to her hypnosis that Tina doesn&#39;t really know that much about. <br />
Leah goes back to pick up her disgusting pants and threw them in the trash. She picked up the bag and tied it before handing it to Tina.<br />
&quot;Here. These pants are clearly ruined. If you could get me some spare clothes, that&#39;d be great, just as long as it&#39;s not a onesie or a diaper. I&#39;m going to take a shower while I still have the ability to bath myself, since that&#39;s not a given anymore.&quot;<br />
With that, Leah shut the door in Tina&#39;s face, leaving her with a smelly trash bag. She stood there staring at the ruined jeans for a few moments, taking in the consequences of her actions. How does she move foreword? She&#39;s set everything up, and the month-long triggers are still in place---she couldn&#39;t remove them if she tried. There was no real going back. All she could do was decide how to move forward. The &#39;disease&#39; progressed as Tina saw fit, and there was an expectation that things would get &#39;worse&#39; as time goes on. Even if Tina stopped, the girl was still stuck sucking a pacifier and wearing training pants for the month. She so desperately wanted Leah to just be her little baby, but...it was ungodly stupid to believe Leah would just go along with it. She could be selfish further and keep going regardless of Leah&#39;s attitude, but she wanted to be a mother taking care of a child...not a child playing with a doll. She had to be smarter about this.<br />
Clearly this was the worst first trigger to use, and Tina didn&#39;t react in the best way. Now, she needed to focus on damage control, making sure that Leah doesn&#39;t feel horrible about her situation, while also making it something enjoyable to her. And Tina did need to focus on LEAH&#39;s wants, not what she wanted---anything else, and she&#39;d be missing the point. She had to be a mom, and that meant sacrifice; she didn&#39;t even know what Leah enjoyed, to her distress. <br />
She mulled over her thoughts, and went to Leah&#39;s room to find her spare clothes. Leah had a large collection of outfits, as any teenage girl would. She looked at her underwear, knowing that even if Leah wanted to wear panties, she needed protection now. She furrowed her brow. She was on shaky grounds with Leah already, but the reality was Leah would just embarrass herself when she had another accident (and it is &#39;when, not &#39;if&#39;). Should she do it just to make Leah feel better for the short term, or does Tina need to practice a bit of tough love? And does Tina even know how to do that without going over board? She never thought she&#39;d have to deal with such complications when she thought up this plan; toddlers are so much easier to deal with than teenagers. With a heavy sigh, she finally decided...</p>
