<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Suddenly, Jeff noticed a thin gas that had crawled into the room. He just stood there in shock and stared as the gas was slowly inhaled by Brendon and Rick. He couldn't belief what he saw happen next. He pointed his fingers to them, completely speechless.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, what's wrong?&quot; Brendon began to panic when he saw his friend frozen state. He quickly understood after he saw what his father, and himself were doing.<br />
<br />
They both began to grow! They were really suprised what's happened to their bodies. All the muscles in their bodies growing out forming beautiful, powerful bodies. As  their bodies formed bodybuilder muscle, they quickly got undressed before it was  too late for their clothing. That left them with just wearing a pair briefs which had mysteriously began to contract around their bodies. They saw their bulges had also grown. Brendon also saw that both that he and his father growing older. Brendon could see hair coming out from their bodies and form a thin line from their belly buttons down to their shorts. He saw his father grow a well - trimmed beard.<br />
<br />
They very happy with their new, massive bodybuilder bodies. Rick had regressed to 28 years old and his height had climbed up to 7 feet tall. His muscle mass had increased by nearly one hundred pounds bring it up to two hundred and ninety five. Brendon now a 23 year older, with his height is 6 feet and 7 inches tall. His muscle increase looked much more dramatic. His average teenage body was replaced with that of young built adult. His built was much more toned than his step-father's bulky massive look. Brendon's body was a cross between a swimmer and novice bodybuilder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jeff, got a camera?&quot; Brendon asked.<br />
<br />
Jeff soon recovered from his fright. &quot;Oh, yeah....sure.&quot; He pulled his cell phone from his pocket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Jeff, could you do take a picture for us, please?&quot; Rick asked gently knowing that Jeff was still completely suprised what's going on. <br />
Jeff  understood the request and started taking his photography shots while Rick and Brendon showed their muscles. Most of the poses were your standard photo shoot poses. Side chest, front double bicep and most muscular. Than things got a little more . . .  provocative.  It all started when they did a standing arm wrestling stance to show off their biceps. With hands clasped and feet firmly planted the show of strength began. Neither was willing to give into the other. Their arms tensed as beads of sweat formed on their brows.<br />
<br />
Rick made the first move by releasing the pressure on his grip ever so slightly. Brendon felt the gripping pressure exerted on his hand diminish a little. What was his step-father up to? He intern released the pressure in his hand.<br />
<br />
After a few seconds the two men's gripping pressure was reduced to that of a firm hand shake, that was when Rick made his move. In one swift move he flipped his step-son over and down to the floor onto his back. A wrestling match for male dominance soon insuded but only lasted a few moments. A less aggressive match of love making was replacing it. Kissing, groping and caressing overtook the two men's actions.<br />
<br />
All Jeff could do was to continue taking pictures with his cell. Unbeknownst to him the gas that had effected his friend and the other guy in the room was being filtered throughout the home. Watching the love making wrestling match before him was beginning to have an effect on him. For some strange reason he was turned on by the two guys making love before him. He had quit taking pictures five minutes ago and was absentmindedly rubbing his hardening bulge. <br />
<br />
Man they must have the AC turned off or I'm catching a cold cause it way to hot in here.</p>
