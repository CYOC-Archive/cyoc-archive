<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">9:52 AM<br />
<br />
Jay looked his new twin sister up and down.  Unlike the men of the family, she didn't have a large build and, thankfully, her skin was free of body hair.  It looked like all the mass that normally went to their muscles (and stomachs), went straight to Michelle's chest.<br />
<br />
Oddly, Jay found he wasn't turned on by her.  Actually, it wasn't odd at all.  She was his twin sister!  What kind of guy has the hots for his twin sister.  Even more, Jay found she looked a lot himself, if in a more feminine package.<br />
<br />
Michelle turned a circle in front of the mirror while running her hands along her once-masculine torso.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's weird,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Being a girl?&quot; asked Jay.<br />
<br />
Michelle shook her head.  &quot;No.  It's the whole dual memory thing.  The Chronivac updated the world and gave me memories as if I've always been a girl.  But I distinctly remember being a boy not five minutes ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
She reached up to her chest and hopped up and down a couple times.  &quot;It's like living in a bouncy castle!&quot; she said, giggling a bit.<br />
<br />
Jay smirked.  &quot;Good to know.  Anyway, what should we do next?&quot;<br />
<br />
Michelle turned back toward the computer.  &quot;Nothing until I'm a guy again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought being a girl was 'awesome.'&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is,&quot; she replied, leaning over the computer and making a few adjustments.  &quot;But if I'm going to be your twin for a while, I'd at least like to be my original gender.  For now, anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; said Jay, attempting to get a look at the computer screen.  &quot;Want me to-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I got it,&quot; Michelle interrupted.  &quot;It's simple enough.  Hey, do you think this thing can read minds?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay shrugged.  &quot;Seeing what it's done so far, I wouldn't doubt it.  Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Michelle shook her head.  &quot;Well... What if it knows what your looking for in the program and sort of.... implants the information on how to do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that makes sense.  I never noticed anything when I was messing with it earlier.  Though, I guess it's probably subtle about it.  Hey, just what are you d-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Done!&quot;  Michelle hopped back from the screen as the transformation message flashed across the screen.<br />
<br />
Michelle shivered as the imperceptible beam passed though her.  The same process as before began to take place, except backwards.<br />
<br />
INITIALIZING SYSTEM. COMMENCING TRANSFORMATION OF SUBJECT [Mark/Michelle]:...<br />
<br />
Michelle immediately felt her chest deflate.  Her curvy features began to straighten out as masculine muscles filled in.  She suddenly winced.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay?&quot; asked Jay.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; she said.  &quot;Let's just say girl pants are definitely not made to accommodate boy parts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah.&quot;<br />
<br />
The fabric of the clothing strained as Michelle, once again Mark grew back to his full height.  Jay could see the area around his naval, which was now exposed, grow wisps of body hair.  His arms followed suite.<br />
<br />
Partway through the transformation, Jay noticed something.  Mark wasn't turning back into himself, but into some mixture of his old features, and some of Jay's.  Mark definitely had Jay's father's nose.  Also, what body hair Jay could see was thicker than it had originally been on Mark.  In fact, it was just about as thick as Jay's.<br />
<br />
Mark, now fully male watched as his body finished filling out.  Well, his new body anyway.  He felt an itching as his beard grew back, thicker and fuller this time.  He also noticed that he looked quite a bit like Jay.  In fact, he was looking more like him by the second!  He watched himself, still ridiculously dressed as a girl half his size, subtly but surely change to look just like Jay.  Well, if Jay had a beard.<br />
<br />
The changes nearly done, Mark winced as he watched his hairline recede noticeably.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice hair,&quot; said Jay, smirking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, I get it from you,&quot; jabbed Mark, in a voice sounding just like Jay's.  &quot;At least I don't have a gut.&quot;<br />
<br />
TRANSFORMATION COMPLETE!  INITIALIZING RIPPLE EFFECT...<br />
<br />
As the Chronivac pulsed, Mark's clothing (thankfully) snapped back into his male clothing.  Both boys unconsciously winced as their memories shifted to Jay and Mark being identical twin brothers.  The only way to tell them apart was Mark was the one with the beard, and Jay was....<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm the one with the gut?&quot; said Jay, snapping back to reality.<br />
<br />
Mark looked down at Jay's stomach.  &quot;Sounds about right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay sidestepped in front of the mirror to get a better look at himself.  Indeed, he seemed to have a good size gut now.  His face also looked rounder.  He couldn't be called fat, but he couldn't really be considered trim, either.  At least, not when standing next to his trimmer, bearded duplicate.<br />
<br />
Jay hurried off toward the bathroom and hopped on the scale.<br />
<br />
178.3 lbs.  Most of it was probably muscle, but still...<br />
<br />
Mark appeared in the bathroom doorway.<br />
<br />
&quot;You see,&quot; Mark said.  &quot;That's what happens when you don't take care of yourself, Jay.  You look at a girl, get all googly-eyed, and you gain twenty pounds to try and impress because you think she likes fat guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark was surprised to see Jay just shrug.  &quot;Eh,&quot; said Jay.  &quot;Knowing our family, it's bound to happen sooner or later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean you don't care?&quot; Mark said quizzically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah,&quot; said Jay.  &quot;I've never really been overweight before.  I figure I might try it out.  I'll use the Chronivac to change back later.&quot;<br />
<br />
He lifted his shirt and experimentally patted his rounded stomach.  He could still see his muscles under it, but not entirely clearly.<br />
<br />
Mark rolled his eyes.  &quot;Alright, have it your way.&quot;  He then glanced at his watch.  &quot;Hoh!  We'd better get back to class, Jay!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay smirked.  &quot;No need.  Due to the increased time flow, we've aged to the point where we've graduated from high school.  Check your memories.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark thought for a moment.  &quot;Huh, I suppose you're right.  The place we should be going to is Dad's auto garage.  Um... we work there now, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay nodded.  &quot;Right.  You're getting the hang of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pair left the house, being sure to grab their work uniforms on the way out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's go, fuzz-face,&quot; said Jay.<br />
<br />
&quot;After you, tubbo,&quot; Mark replied.</p>
