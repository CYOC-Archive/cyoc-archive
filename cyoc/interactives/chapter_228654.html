<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vedasto Williams was one of many men who was very sure of something, being a man and having a life as a man was much more hard than being a woman, and women compared to men are very privileged, and mostly living life as a woman was live life in easy mode.<br />
<br />
Of course for obvious reasons this was an extremely unpopular opinion among women. If Vedasto thought of saying this to any woman, the only thing he would get was that they would look at him ugly and treat him as a total idiot or they would never want to see him again in their lifes. Because of course, what the hell did he know how supposedly easy it was to be a woman, he was a man!! He had no right to have an opinion on the subject, because he was a man!!<br />
<br />
He even had a few discussions about the topic, which turned into dumb girls vs boys arguments with the same comments, with his younger sister, Renula, who was 20 years old, and the discussions always ended in the same tired old arguments, period, and period, well, pregnancy, back pain, did I mention the period part??<br />
<br />
What made Vedasto be annoyed that even his little sister answer that, was the fact that his sister literally earned an immense amount of money for basically not doing much and just being a woman!! Since what was Renula&#39;s profession and work?? She was a VTuber!! She practically made tons of money for just being cute, talking pretty on stream and being a girl with a cute voice, and hanging out with friends and TAH-DAH!! She was showered with a lot of money and success. While Vedasto had to work 40 hours a week, losing a lot of extra time on public transportation, to go back and forth to an office to do a lot of extremely boring and tiring tasks, and he had to make all this effort and lose all this time every week, to basically receive a salary that was only 200 dollars more than the monthly income of his sister the Vtuber girl. But of course that didn&#39;t matter because he didn&#39;t experience the once-a-month period thing apparently. There is no way that in this world, with her current culture and workings, thar her little sister would have had such a simple and fun life if she had been born with the opposite gender, because being pretty and talking cute on a stream wouldn&#39;t have worked for &quot;him&quot;.<br />
<br />
But the funny thing about his way of thinking is that Vedasto didn&#39;t even hate women or something!! He greatly disliked Incel culture and thought those guys were only making the problem bigger. In fact Vedasto didn&#39;t even mind the idea of living in a world where women simply received money and praise for the simple fact of being a woman, he was into the thing of worshipping women in fact!! And he actually followed many Vtubers that he adored and even gave them a lot of money many times because of how cute and fun they were. He liked all that and many women he found them, cute, sexy, etc.<br />
<br />
What really bothered Vedasto was the way all the dynamics and interactions between the two genders happened in the current culture of this world. How one-sided it was and how women always benefited the most.<br />
<br />
He understood that your life wasn&#39;t perfect just because you were born a woman, he knew that women also had their own problems and conflicts with the current culture of the world, problems that he also resented, but Vedasto was thought about basic details that were unbalanced in all of this, like well if there are a lot of men worshiping women and literally giving them money on Twitch just for being a woman, why isn&#39;t the opposite common too?? Why there isn&#39;t a lot of women out there also worshiping a man and giving him all their money because they found him attractive and stuff??<br />
<br />
Or what for Vedasto was the biggest problem, the fact that he had to live his life with extra care and feel guilty or like a possible criminal just for being a man.<br />
<br />
Vedasto was therefore quite horny in his thoughts from time to time, nothing out of the ordinary and unheard, he was a man, this was common, and like many men a woman with big tits seemed irresistible to him, big shock men like boobs. And something as simple as this was what got him fired.<br />
<br />
Because Vedasto had a partner at work, that well, she was very well-endowed upstairs, she had a very good pair, this woman&#39;s name was Tatiana, and Vedasto couldn&#39;t stop his eyes from moving towards her every time they crossed paths in the office or when the two ended up together in the elevator, the problem was that Tatiana was the typical woman who thinks that every man who is looking at her is a potential rapist planning to chase her and rape her in an alley on the street when they could catch her off guard, because every man around her must be a feral incapable of controlling himself who can only think about raping and killing her and there is no possibility that it is just a reflex that is hard to avoid due to the sexy nature of her figure. But none of this mattered when Tatiana proceeded to file a complaint with the boss of the entire company, Sebastian, where Tatiana claimed that Vedasto was constantly harassing her, chasing her, and that Vedasto once tried to grope her chest, and that last thing never happened, it is a lie that Tatiana made up, but of course since Tatiana is a woman and Vedasto is a man, Vedasto didn&#39;t have the right to the benefit of the doubt because he is a man and Tatiana must be telling the truth because she is a woman!! And that&#39;s how Vedasto was fired due this woman&#39;s complaint.<br />
<br />
Vedasto wouldn&#39;t mind living in a world where you are privileged just for being a woman, if it weren&#39;t for all the women who act like a bunch of idiots about it and only take advantage of being women to ruin the lide of any man, because they treat all men like rapists with no feelings or things like that, like this stupid woman Tatiana. Sigh.<br />
<br />
Despite this unpleasant incident, the good thing is that it didn&#39;t take long for Vedasto to find another job, one that offered pay just as good as his previous job, and this time in an office that was closer to his home, now at least Vedasto would waste less time on public transportation. Vedasto just hoped that the people in this new office would turn out to be nice and there wouldn&#39;t be another woman similar in mentality to Tatiana out there.<br />
<br />
Vedasto had already signed the contract, and informed him that he would start working within a week. So Vedasto at least had a small week&#39;s vacation before going and adjusting to his new job as marketing director of this new company called FrontCircles.<br />
<br />
To take advantage of the time, Vedasto went to the incredibly old and enormous local library of his city, since one of Vedasto&#39;s favorite activities was to spend days reading extremely old books, literature from more than 500 years ago was a topic that he was quite passionate about, just sitting and reading a book from the year 1600 was a thing that amused him, and a pleasure that he had no one to share with because not many people were interested in that. But this local library was famous for how old it was and having a large number of books from even more than 700 years ago.<br />
<br />
Vedasto went, grabbed a bunch of books he was interested in checking out, rented them, and took all these big, dusty old books with him, saying goodbye to the librarian Elizabeth before leaving, a person with whom Vedasto got along quite well, since Elizabeth appreciated Vedasto&#39;s unusual interests, and she was quite kind. She never treated Vedasto badly or anything like that the times Vedasto couldn&#39;t help but stare at her ass. Would it be too much to ask that all the women at his new job be like that and not make a big deal about it??<br />
<br />
Vedasto arrived at his apartment, he was happy with the smell of old books that he brought with him, and he put all the books on the table in his living room, to review again what he brought with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh…?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vedasto noticed something odd, in the middle of the pile of books which were quite thick, there was one that looked very thin compared to the rest, which was unusual, normally any book that is more than 300 years old and has managed to survive all this time, they have 400 to 600 pages, but the slight thickness of this book that Vedasto doesn&#39;t even remember taking, indicated that it had at most 100 pages, it looked more like a notebook than a actual book, it didn&#39;t even have anything on its cover or backcover. What will this be? Did Vedasto accidentally grab something he shouldn&#39;t have??<br />
<br />
Vedasto took the book, and began to look through it, the thin book had that distinctive old smell that the other books also had, but mysteriously all the pages of this book were blank... until Vedasto realized that he opened the book upside down, and when he looked at the second page he saw that it was the only place where this book had anything written.<br />
<br />
&quot;This book has about 99 blank pages but someone wrote something on page number 2? How odd, let&#39;s see what it says here hmmm --think about what you want to know and then turn the page-- wait what??&quot;<br />
<br />
Vedasto was very confused, he had never seen anything like this in his life, an old book in perfect condition, but very small, and this was all it had printed on it?? And it seemed like someone wrote that phrase more than 500 years ago even. What was this supposed to be?? Then Vedasto thought, maybe this was a magic book…? It was a childish thought, but Vedasto had nothing to lose by trying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well, I want to know what this book is, where it came from, what was the reason for its creation and everything I can know about it!!! Oh wait, should I think about it and not say it out loud, right??&quot;<br />
<br />
But when Vedasto turned the page of the book, the most impressive and incredible thing he had ever seen would happen, a bunch of words and text that weren&#39;t there before on those blank pages, would appear out of nowhere as Vedasto looked, the entire content of a book was being written in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;..Oh MY, THIS IS ACTUALLY A MAGIC BOOK?!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Vedasto took his time to carefully read all the text that appeared below after his request to the book.<br />
<br />
The text explained the entire history of the book and its origins. How this book had originally been created to collect and see how it was written into itself, absolutely all the information of the Universe in which the book was currently located, but an accident with transformative magic, led to the book to completely transform into something else. Since currently the book isn&#39;t only a thing that can collect all possible information about the universe where it is located, but it also allows whoever is using this book to edit the information of that universe at will. Since no matter the circumstance, the information that is written in this book will always be the real information of the universe where this book is located, which means that whoever is consulting the book can change said information, and even change and alter all the laws of physics that govern said universe. All of this information becomes a canvas that whoever owns the book can modify around them as they please. If you query about a specific topic and change something about the nature of that information, the rest of the all information in the entire universe will be readjusted and re-ordered around that change, keeping all the information still coherent and accurate.<br />
<br />
All this implies that the book grants whoever is using it the powers to edit and change the information about the reality around them, retroactively. Any changes made to the universe where the book is located will only give rise to a universe where everything has always been the way the book explains or details something. And the only person who will be able to perceive the changes is whoever was using the book at that moment, since the magic of the book protects the memories of whoever is consulting it.<br />
<br />
&quot;HOLY FUCK!!!!&quot; Vedasto exclaimed, in complete shock at what he was reading.<br />
<br />
The text also explained how Elizabeth was the one who acted as guardian of this book for centuries, since it was she who caused the accident that turned the book into this. Elizabeth??? The same Elizabeth that Vedasto was thinking of?? Her favorite librarian?? Did she just give this book to Vedasto by accident??<br />
<br />
This was one of those incredible fantasy stories that sounded too good to be true, Vedasto decided that it was best to test the book immediately with something simple, to see if this thing really worked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok almighty book, this is what I want to know, give me all the information on the walls of my apartment&quot;<br />
<br />
The book responded to Vedasto immediately, and all the text that was there before disappeared and now a new text filled the pages of the book, with a lot of information and ridiculously detailed explanations, about the walls of Vedasto&#39;s apartment of all things.<br />
<br />
Vedasto then thinking about whether if he understood the idea of how to use this, went to look for a pen. When he returned with this, he carefully analyzed the text that appeared now and in one section it said the following sentence.<br />
<br />
&quot;--the walls painted of green-- hmmm...&quot;<br />
<br />
Then at that moment Vedasto crossed out the word -green- from the text, and wrote the word -purple- on top of where the word green was. Once this was done, Vedasto observed how the entire text of the book changed and was rearranged, erasing all instances where the green color of the walls was mentioned, and now they are described as painted of purple.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy fuck!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
And then Vedasto saw, impressed around him, how the appearance of his entire apartment had changed!! Now all the walls were purple!! And not only that, but Vedasto instinctively grabbed his cell phone to check a photo he took a few days ago when a friend visited him in his apartment, and look how the photo had changed, the background was now purple, the universe has just changed, and now the walls of his apartment have always been painted purple.<br />
<br />
&quot;THIS WORKS, THIS FUCKING WORKS!! NOW I CAN EDIT ALL THE INFORMATION OF THE UNIVERSE AT MY WILL, OH MY FUCK GOD!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Vedasto couldn&#39;t be more impressed or pleased, a mischievous smile covering his face.<br />
<br />
It was time to use this book for something more fun.</p>
