<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Juliet supervised things over the main foyer in the chateau as things were getting underway for the grand masquerade ball. To a great degree, things weren’t decorated in the way one might expect from the US, and she had noted the various questions from the French colony’s guests from America in Miles and the new member… Lexia. There might be some things here and there, and playing more to candles rather than electrical lighting, which given its age, the chateau was actually fairly well suited toward and that added to some a more natural “spooky” air. One did not need a bunch of fake pumpkins to present a bit of an eerie feeling. And the sixteenth to seventeenth century costumes, wigs, and hand held masks could even add to them.<br />
<br />
“I must thank you again for inviting us,” Olympia’s father said to Juliet from across from her, looking fairly trim and even dashing in the costume with his wife looking quite the same beside him, “though… I am surprised you apparently went out of the way to have costumes made for us… a farmer…”<br />
<br />
“Isn’t worth it?” Juliet asked, “Sir, that kind of nonsense is why so many nobles lost their heads, once upon a time. You are worth it. To be here and to show support for Olympe. And for me to prove that I have not betrayed the trust you put in me to teach her.”<br />
<br />
Olympe’s father gave an embarrassed smile as his cheeks flushed, as did Olympe’s mother’s cheeks. Juliet wondered if this was from pride or something else, but she took it as a fairly good sign, though the parents of girls that had become Animalians really weren’t that much of an issue. They had already trusted her and didn’t lose that trust after they were converted. There were some surprised gasps over particular choices in Animalian to become or certain traits that came up after their respective conversions, but there was some acceptance no real loss of trust in Juliet.<br />
<br />
“I would think that the fears of a loss of trust may have been exaggerated,” came a male voice approaching from another direction, making Juliet turn to see a male Human approaching with a young woman.<br />
<br />
The man was well dressed and fit the theme, though his darker skin and dark hair betrayed a more southern them and Algerian heritage, which Juliet recognized. He was actually one of the government agents that represented France’s education department and was responsible for making sure that her school at least met the minimum and that any new teachers she might hire met France’s requirements. His family was mixed between France and Algeria. From what Juliet knew, his grandfather had been part of the administration of the former colony and had actually married a local woman. When De Gaulle decided fighting indefinitely for Algeria wasn’t worth it, his family returned to France settled in. The man, Raoul Renée then carried on a lot of his family’s tradition of government service, though his daughter, Desiree, had been more interested ballet and had a fairly good career as a dancer.<br />
<br />
“That was with the parents of those already attending here and have already accepted them becoming Animalians,” Juliet answered, “you should know, Mr. Renee that those that have lost trust were those that do not know me as well.”<br />
<br />
“Over rumors from those that want you to be happy,” Raoul answered, “quite noble, to a degree.”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Juliet nodded, thinking back over what had caused some of the problems that this masquerade ball was to help provide some help in solving.<br />
<br />
It had started with Juliet accepting an American who’d sought to become a Fox Animalian, and specifically a hybrid fox known as the Golden Island Fox. His name was Juan and had been dealing with drug related charges that had cost him pretty much everything in the US. Juliet had had to pull some strings so that he could participate in a program that would ultimately let him earn the registration to teach in France, and that was going well. But the girls she had been teaching, and had been allowed to convert and become Animalians thought that because Juan as a Golden Island Fox Animalian and herself as a Silver-Phase Red Fox Animalian looked “good” together and were both Fox Animalians pushed a series of rumors that Juliet and Juan were romantically involved.<br />
<br />
It was false, and problematic given the professional working relationship that Juliet had taken on in bringing Juan to France, and even a potential teacher/student relationship given that Juan needed to retool his skill set to gain registration under French law versus US regulations for teachers. It also violated Animalia’s edicts regarding interspecies breeding, particularly as the rumors also contained the idea that Juliet was looking to have kits with Juan. But because neither were of the same species, that couldn’t work, and Juan had also been too much of a professional to even try it. Juliet ultimately had to pull a prank to get the girls to admit being the source of the rumor and try to put to bed the attempts to set them up.<br />
<br />
For those rumors had generated enough negative attention that being able to take on new students had rapidly become difficult. It raised the potential that the thing that Juliet had dedicated her whole life to would be crushed by these rumors. The chateau made enough money from the vineyards around it that Juliet was in no immediate risk of losing her home, but that was something she left more to the staff, and to a degree, Olympe was also taking some interest in the care of the plants and some of the science behind wine and champagne making. But Juliet did not want to lose what she saw as her life’s mission. The girls did apologize and that ultimately helped stop the damage from spreading, but didn’t change that damage had been done.<br />
<br />
Repairing that damaged trust was a big part of the masquerade ball and that Juliet had contributed heavily to make sure the families of the new students and old students had the funds to come to the party and see that no one was being abused and could have some fun, as well. It might be one of the few ways in which France borrowed things from America, but the response was there and intended to be helpful. Raoul had even helped with some of the communications efforts to sell it, largely because of his own connections in representing the French government’s education department and needing to fix the fallout that threatened them as well.<br />
<br />
“Oh, papa had more personal reasons to worry about your success,” Desiree commented with a smile aimed at her father.<br />
<br />
“Desiree…” Raoul began.<br />
<br />
“Papa, you’ve admired her from a distance and her work,” Desiree answered, “the least you can do is mention that admiration.”<br />
<br />
“Admiration,” Juliet blinked in surprise.<br />
<br />
This brought a deep blush to Raoul’s face as he tried to hide behind his mask as Juliet had picked up on that, and after urging Desiree off to enjoy the rest of the party with one hand, he returned his gaze to Juliet.<br />
<br />
“I see much of myself in you, Madame Renard-Argente,” Raoul answered, “I have served my country as a member of the government for the purpose that I truly believe the state is there to SERVE the people. The President, regardless of his party is not France and France does not exist to serve him. That kind of thinking is a backward part of French politics that has been there for years… regardless of kings or presidents. Our purpose is to try and do what is best for all and serve what is desired by the people. Not tell them what they must accept without having a good reason for it.”<br />
<br />
“I am not a member of the government,” Juliet answered sternly.<br />
<br />
“True, madam,” Raoul nodded, “but your dedication to education and special education is similar. You seek to do what is best for all and best for those that may often be ignored because it is not… expedient. It is private service rather than public service, and all the reports… have shown hard work and dedication that I respect and like very much. It has made it a privilege to work beside you as the connection between your school and the government. And… that… well… it has also created more… personal likes and respect, as well. It is a personality I greatly admire.”<br />
<br />
“And you’re just now saying this?” Juliet gasped, thinking over how long Raoul Renee had been there as representative of the government’s education ministry and making sure she still followed the “rules.” He’d been there since Macron was first elected and there had often been a firm and distant tone there. It was something that she never thought would lead into any personal desire, at least not until she became an Animalian, but his mention of “personality” made it sound as though he wasn’t solely interested in her present curves.<br />
<br />
“I did not want to come off as some leech,” Raoul answered, “and trust me… I know many of the jokes aimed at politicians.”<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
“I’d just like to know why you felt it necessary to say such things?” one very serious looking woman said to Fifi and Mia as the two Animalians that had been part of the scheme to try and get Juliet and Juan together stood a bit nervously.<br />
<br />
And they fully understood why, and that made them paw a little bit at the dress’s sleeves that they were wearing. A part of them would have preferred a bit more of open top to show some cleavage, and just enough to get any unmarried men interested, but that wasn’t really possible given that the nature of this party was to be family friendly and to give the parents of newest students, who were all very young, some sense of trust in Juliet’s abilities as a teacher and in her judge of character. And that had come out as part of their idea to try and hook Juan up with Juliet, and without recognizing the real world troubles such a scheme would cause. And it left the mother’s young son standing between the two female Animalians and his mother.<br />
<br />
“We honestly wanted Juliet to be happy,” Mia said weakly, “she’s been like an extra mom to us… taught us… raised us… and never took us from our families. As we could go visit them and they could come visit us.”<br />
<br />
“And a part of me wishes they would want to become Animalians and join us here now,” Fifi commented looked over to where her parents were picking out some snacks from a table, “as they would like Juliet too.”<br />
<br />
“And that required lying about a relationship?” the mother asked, “Surely Ms. Renard-Argente taught you that lying was wrong?”<br />
<br />
“She did… but she’s also a single woman and has been under pressure,” Fifi answered.<br />
<br />
“And we thought that she would be happy with Juan,” Mia added, “and that as Fox Animalians, it would be okay. That there would be no problem. They could be happy and have a happily ever after moment. You know… a fairy tale ending.”<br />
<br />
“Even though that these rumors could hurt her?” the mother asked, “And could hurt my son if these things continue while he’s here?”<br />
<br />
Fifi and Mia both swallowed deeply and it was Mia who answered first.<br />
<br />
“Neither of us thought any harm would be done,” Mia admitted, “we thought people would see Juliet be happy and be happy for her. We didn’t think there would be any legal or moral issues with her and Juan being together. That was in part why we had the idea to help push that narrative along so that they would get together and be happy.”<br />
<br />
“And we are sorry for the harm it did cause,” Fifi added, “we didn’t think it would do any arm and weren’t thinking as a result.”<br />
<br />
The mother stood by and watched the nervousness from both Animalians. Their tails slowly swayed behind them, but not in any way that was aimed at anything beyond some nervous movement. The limbs were being moved just for the sake of movement and it moved the back of the gowns they wore. She noted that the last thing they did was to look down the young boy, who was about as old as Fifi and Mia were when Juliet had first opened her private school at her chateau and took the girls in. He was dressed up a bit like a jester, like what one might have done up for one of Shakespeare’s plays and complete with a colored mask. And despite the seriousness of the tone of the discussion, he was happy to babble a bit and wander over to the snack trays before returning with either some candy or jerky.<br />
<br />
“And we would never let anything happen to your son,” Mia added, “even before what happened with the rumors… we would not have done anything.”<br />
<br />
“For it is important to be nice and we wouldn’t knowingly do something that would affect his choices,” Fifi answered, “what happened regarding the rumors we spread… that was a real eye opening test for us on that issue. We learned a lot.”<br />
<br />
“And we’re both sorry,” Mia added.<br />
<br />
“They good, mama,” the boy said from the ground beneath them.<br />
<br />
The mother looked down and noted that her soon looked fine and was enjoying himself in the costume. And at the same time, the in person apology from Fifi and Mia also went a long way to easing her fears and concerns. For she’d seen the announcement that had been made that the rumors spread were false, and that had been a big part of her accepting her son coming to Renard-Argente Chateau for his education and dealing with other issues, but there would be the worries and concerns. And it would be hard to be a major judge of character based on things shown on the internet. Those things could easily be faked or play acted. The in person apology from Fifi and Mia, however, felt quite genuine.<br />
<br />
“Good,” the mother spoke, “then I trust you’ve both learned your lesson?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, madam,” Fifi answered.<br />
<br />
“Then why don’t we go get something from the snacks table,” the mother spoke, “Joseph has already helped himself to some things… and that is making me a bit hungry now.”<br />
<br />
“Of course, and it is a party,” Mia smiled, “and we can tell you more about a common day during school.”<br />
<br />
They then turned to head toward those snacks, though out of the corner of Fifi’s eye, she could see Juliet standing beside the man who often came to the chateau to discuss things that related to how the school was progressing and represented France’s government and education ministry. She wasn’t sure on the man’s name, but she could see him take Juliet’s hand and kiss it like a gentleman and that it made Juliet’s tail wag happily. Which seemed that the party might bring other pleasant surprises.</p>
