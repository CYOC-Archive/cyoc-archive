<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, don't you two make a lovely couple!&quot; said Kyle, surprising Jennifer and Rich from behind.  The two hopped in place to turn and face him, Rich accidentally thumping Jennifer with his heavy tail, their boobs flopping comically according to Kyle's design.  <br />
<br />
Kyle burst into hysterical laughter at the sight of Rich's huge breasts.  &quot;Sweet Jesus, Rich -- that is one amazing pair of tits you have there, buddy!&quot;  He reached out and gave Rich's right boob a healthy squeeze, which Rich tried unsuccessfully to swat away with his forepaw.  The feeling of a human hand on his sensitive breast stunned him for a moment.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You guys are going to have a wonderful life together&quot;, taunted Kyle, &quot;...the fun part for me is trying to figure out whether you're a straight or a lesbian couple.  It truly boggles the mind!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rich regained his composure.  He had to stay calm.  He had Kyle right where he wanted him, but one small mistake could blow his plan and doom him to a difficult life in the body of a kangaroo chick.  He studied the hall traffic and waited.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about your dick, Rich -- honestly I hadn't even thought about that part of the deal, but what a nice little bonus.  Have you had your first period yet?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;That's not all you didn't think about&quot;, Rich said pointedly.  In the moments it took Kyle's expression to change to puzzlement, Rich saw his chance.  The break in the hall traffic wouldn't last long.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or dare&quot;, said Rich.  <br />
<br />
Kyle chuckled.  &quot;Didn't Jennifer tell you?  That won't work, my furry friend.  You're not able to use the curse.  I made sure of that.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You sure about that, Kyle?&quot; <br />
<br />
Rich's tone was confident.  Way too confident for someone facing a life sentence as a kangaroo girl.  The smile vanished from Kyle's face.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Think about it, Einstein&quot;, said Rich.  <br />
<br />
Kyle froze, his mind replaying the curse he had cast in fast forward.  He sensed that he had messed something up.  Badly.  But he didn't have his finger on it yet.  How was Rich even able to say &quot;transform or dare&quot;? <br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead, stay quiet for 30 more seconds -- it'll only make my job easier&quot;, Rich said, a grin appearing on his face.  <br />
<br />
Kyle looked at Jennifer, and then at Rich.  His mouth slowly dropped open as it came over him that he hadn't applied the limit on the curse to Rich.  His heart started pounding in his throat as he realized the power that Rich now had over him.  <br />
<br />
His mind reeling in a search for a way out, Kyle's first thought was that Rich was going to transform him into something truly hideous.  He had to prevent that. His next thought was that he had only seconds remaining before his time to choose would run out.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Dare!&quot; Kyle blurted out, thankful that he had at least avoided the worst that could be done to him.  Just as Rich had expected.  <br />
<br />
Rich wasted no time putting his plan into effect.  &quot;I dare you curse me back and then to dare me to curse you again, and to repeat these same choices upon command every time you are cursed, until you hear me say 'no more dares'; after that, when cursed you will remain silent for one minute.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Blood rushing into his head, Kyle had just enough time to recognize the brilliance of Rich's plan before feeling the compulsion of the dare coming on.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or dare&quot; said Kyle automatically, his voice trembling.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Dare&quot; said Rich, setting him up.  Kyle complied: &quot;I dare you to curse me again.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or dare&quot;, said Rich, returning the curse.  Kyle struggled to avoid the compulsion but was unable to avoid it.  &quot;Dare&quot;, he replied.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I dare you to follow us into the gym without speaking.&quot;  Rich new the school gymnasium would be deserted during first period.  <br />
<br />
Rich and Jennifer turned and started hopping toward the gym, and Kyle felt compelled to follow him despite his desperate urge to flee.  He watched the two of them hopping pathetically in front of him, their boobs bobbing in all directions, their nearly useless forepaws curled in front of them, and he felt terror at the thought that he was probably in for worse.  He wanted to apologize, to beg them for mercy, but the dare forced him to keep silent.  <br />
<br />
Rich fumbled with the door to the gym but wasn't able to work the thumb latch above the handle.  He could hook the handle with one paw and press down on the latch with the other, but then he wasn't able to hop backwards without loosing his grasp.  Kyle saw that he had to open the door for them, and then followed them inside.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You may curse me now&quot;, said Rich.   &quot;Transform or dare&quot;, said Kyle.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Dare&quot;, replied Rich.  Kyle responded dutifully, tears flowing from his eyes: &quot;I dare you to curse me again.&quot; <br />
<br />
Rich complied: &quot;Transform or dare.&quot;  &quot;Dare&quot;, repeated Kyle. <br />
<br />
Rich measured his words carefully: &quot;I dare you, the next time you curse me, after I remain silent for one minute, to transform me back to the way I was just before the curse, and then to dare me to curse you again, and then to resume daring me to curse you again each time you are cursed.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or dare&quot;, said Kyle.  Rich remained silent for the required minute, permitting Kyle to both dare and transform him.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You will now transform back to the way you were just before the curse&quot;, said Kyle, &quot;and please, I'm so sorry I did this to you guys -- I'm such a fucking idiot!  I was jealous of you and I didn't know what I was doing.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Rich ignored Kyle's plea as he felt himself starting to change.  He felt his ears shrinking first; then his breasts started to reduce while his forepaws started evolving into human hands.  He lost his balance when his lower half started changing and had to sit on the floor while the rest of the curse reversed itself.  After several minutes the last of his fur receded and he rose unsteadily to his feet.  Having gotten used to hopping, it took him a moment to put one foot in front of the other and to fetch a gym uniform from a bin against the wall, so no one would come by and catch him standing naked in the gym.  He took a moment to wiggle his fingers, marveling at the wonderful dexterity he had regained.  <br />
<br />
Upon seeing Rich turn back to normal, Jennifer broke down crying.  While she felt great relief that Rich had been cured, she looked down at her kangaroo body and knew that she was alone in the world now, stuck in her present form forever.  <br />
<br />
Rich felt such terrible sadness for her.  Just moments ago he had been stuck in the same ridiculous body.  He was powerless to change her back, but he did have a consolation planned for her, one he hadn't told her about, because he wasn't sure he could go through with it.  Now, with his own joy at being restored bringing her sorrow into such sharp relief, Rich had made up his mind.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I believe you owe me a dare, Kyle&quot;, said Rich, &quot;please carry on.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;I dare you to curse me again.&quot;  &quot;Transform or dare&quot;, said Rich.  Kyle chose the dare as required.  <br />
<br />
Rich paused for a moment.  He couldn't believe he was about to do this, but seeing Jennifer so upset about her fate wrenched at his heart.  He had to do it. <br />
<br />
&quot;I dare you, upon cursing me next, to dare me to fall madly in love with Jennifer, and to find her more physically attractive in her current form than I have ever found any other woman.&quot; <br />
<br />
(&quot;Good god, did I really just say that?&quot; Rich thought to himself.  &quot;Could this day possibly get any weirder?&quot;)  While the thought of being with a kangaroo girl seemed totally bizarre to him, Rich new that the curse would alter reality so that his feelings for Jennifer would be entirely real.  She might be stuck in her current form forever, but at least she wouldn't start her new life alone. <br />
<br />
Jennifer couldn't believe what she was hearing.  &quot;Oh Rich!  Do you really mean it?&quot; she cried, hopping over to him with tears of joy flowing down her face.  She hugged him as best she could with her giant breasts and short forepaws.  &quot;You're so wonderful Rich...I can't believe you'd really do this for me.  I'm so overwhelmed -- I don't even know what to say.  Thank you.&quot;  Rich hugged her back, still feeling strange about being so close to this furry creature.  <br />
<br />
At the moment Kyle complied with the dare, Rich felt new feelings wash over him, the first being that the creature he was holding in his arms was the most precious thing he had ever held.  He released her and took a step back to look at her with new eyes.  He marveled at the beauty before him; the lovely roundness of her large, squatted knees, her soft, shiny fur, her pretty little paws...and wow, those breasts...Rich took Jennifer in his arms again and kissed her deeply.  &quot;My god, you're so beautiful&quot;, he whispered in her large, furry ear.  After another quick kiss he turned his attention back to Kyle.  <br />
<br />
&quot;All right, Kyle.  No more dares.&quot;  Crying, Kyle pleaded for forgiveness.  His body felt numb with fear.  <br />
<br />
Rich continued: &quot;Transform or dare?&quot;  Kyle tried to speak but was not able to form any words.  He knew his fate was sealed.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Kyle, you know the rules -- one minute has passed, so you get the works.  And trust me; this is going to be good.&quot;  Resigned to the fact that all was lost, Kyle waited silently to hear his fate.  <br />
<br />
Rich walked toward Kyle, stopped directly in front of him, and looked him in the eyes.</p>
