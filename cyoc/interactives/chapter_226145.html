<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I show you mine if you show me yours<br />
<br />
“I am a proper lady, it would be too awkward if I show you my chest just like that” I say starting to feel a little embarrassed <br />
<br />
“pretty pleaseeee, it’s not embarrassing, we are both girls” Hana tries to do puppy eyes to convince me<br />
<br />
“If it’s not embarrassing, you do it first. You show me yours and I show you mine” I bluff thinking that she really wouldn’t do it<br />
<br />
“Really?”<br />
<br />
I hesitate a little but I cannot back out at this point “Yes, I promise”<br />
<br />
Hana grabs the bottom of her shirt and swiftly pulls it out. Riding on the momentum she tries to take off her bra, but when she puts her hands on her back she pauses for a moment  and starts to feel embarrassed. However, when I think that she is going to stop and call off the deal, Hana starts to slowly undo her bra. She shyly unhooks her bra and lets it fall to the bed, so  I can see Hana’s two lemon sized mounds coming free. <br />
<br />
For a moment Hana tries to cover her breasts, but after quickly remembering that the point is to let me see them, she stop herself<br />
<br />
“Now it’s your turn” she tries to force nonchalance in her voice but the fierce blush of her face betrays her.   <br />
<br />
I stay dumbfounded for a moment but when I hear Hana’s voice I start to react<br />
<br />
I didn’t think Hana was so bold as to show me her breasts, but a deal is a deal; Although I am almost dying of embarrassment I slowly take my shirt and bra off.<br />
<br />
It is funny that a few months ago I didn’t think anything about revealing my chest, but now it’s causing me so much embarrassment. I think that between mom’s constant nagging about covering my chest and me seeing my female classmates being so cautious of the boys ogling their breasts, my brain has adapted and recognized that showing bare breasts is something embarrassing.<br />
<br />
Resisting the urge to immediately cover my chest, I let Hana admire my undeveloped bumps and at the same time, with great curiosity, I started to check Hana&#39;s more developed breasts and compare them to mine.<br />
<br />
As I previously noticed, Hana’s chest is developed enough to call it boobs. Her breasts are big enough that will probably jiggle without a bra, but not large enough that cannot be cupped in my hands. The buds inside my chest have become softer and  squeezier, but they haven’t developed into proper boobs yet<br />
<br />
Compared to Hana’s nipples, mine  actually seem to protrude more, and my areolas are a little larger than hers; I would like to believe that at this moment, my body is doing the preparative work to make my breasts balloon in the future and decided that I am going to need bigger nipples to go well with my future bigger boobs.<br />
<br />
Hana’s skin hue is a little darker than my pale white one and her nipples  are a darker hue of pink as well. Something I have been a little envious of, is that Hana does not need to use sunscreen as much as me, if she stays under the sun she just gets a little tan and that’s it. In comparison, during sunny days I depend on the sunblocker quite a lot, if I stay under the sun without it, my skin burns and I end up red quite easily.<br />
<br />
When we start to inspect each other, it could be seen from the body language how awkward and embarrassed we both are, but as the seconds pass we get more comfortable with the exposure level and start to sit upright and puff our chests to display our goods and make the other see clearly<br />
<br />
“he he, it seem that I win here as well” Hana jokes with a cheeky smile<br />
<br />
“Brag while you can, you won&#39;t be able to in the future” I respond with a grin of my own<br />
<br />
“I know, big boobs don&#39;t run in the family, you have met my mom already. Actually, I didn’t expect my bobbies to come out so early; now everyone is talking about that and is making me feel uncomfortable.”<br />
<br />
“Everyone has their own pace, don’t mind what others say, and even if your mom is petite and…mmm…slim, maybe you got some genes from your father and won’t be like her.” I reply fearing that I touched a sore point<br />
<br />
“pfft, don’t be so serious” Hana replies with a wry smile “My paternal grandmother is still petite and slim as you say, but you don’t have to worry, it is not like I have a problem with small breasts. Actually, I think that the best ones are small boobies or huge ones, average size is just…average.”   <br />
<br />
What a curious way to think, I muse, but I think that her mentality is that despite the size, the rarer it is, the better. Well, as long as she is not dissatisfied with her body it is fine.<br />
<br />
“Ok then, by the way, can you raise your arms? I want to see something”<br />
<br />
“mm? what?” she asks but raises her arms nonetheless <br />
<br />
There, I see her smooth armpits, devoid of any hair<br />
<br />
“Do you shave yourself?” I ask curiously<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?” Hana asks while tilting her head curiously<br />
<br />
“I mean…during puberty girls do grow hair in that place, but since you don’t have any I thought  you shaved it… could it be that you didn’t grow any hair at all? <br />
<br />
For a moment Hana looks baffled but after a moment she recompose herself, “No! look again, I do have some hair”<br />
<br />
I look again, but I can only see very thin, almost invisible baby hair.<br />
<br />
“No, what I mean is…” I felt I little shy, but since we are already exposing our bodies I thought I should continue and raised my arm to expose my armpits <br />
<br />
“Hair like this” I concluded<br />
<br />
Recently, hair have started to grow on my armpits, at this point is nothing much, but I have considered shaving it; The only reason I didn’t is probably because I don’t own many clothes that leave my armpits exposed <br />
<br />
For a moment Hana looks surprised, but after a heartbeat it turns into curiosity<br />
<br />
“Is this something normal?” she asks quietly<br />
<br />
“yeah, it is very common” I grab, my phone and quickly search for armpit hair pictures to show Hana<br />
<br />
Hana takes a moment to look at the pictures and contemplate, “I knew that boys grew hair like that because of Dad, but I have never seen Mom with armpit hair nor shaving it, so I had really no idea that girls grew armpit hair as well”<br />
<br />
For a moment, I thought that maybe Hana’s mom just didn’t tell her and shaved when Hana didn’t see her, but I knew that Hana still took baths with her mom from time to time, and since Hana herself hadn’t grown any hair despite being so developed in other areas…<br />
<br />
“Maybe is something genetic” I concluded “maybe your mother’s side of the family just have very low body hair”<br />
<br />
Hana just sat still while thinking, and I decided to add something else<br />
<br />
“Could it be…that you don’t have any hair down there… you know between your legs?”<br />
<br />
Hana was startled and her face became beet red<br />
<br />
“Now is your turn to show me!” I said and grabbed her shorts and made the motion as if to pull them down<br />
<br />
“Wait! you have to take your shorts first this time then” Hana quickly responded <br />
<br />
“No…that place…it would be too embarrassing… what about this; we both strip our clothes under the blankets, and then we take the blankets off and show our bodies at the same time” <br />
<br />
I was extremely embarrassed just saying this, but I was really curious whether or not she was hairless down there<br />
<br />
Hana considered for a moment, but after a moment she quietly nodded with a red face, too embarrassed to say a word<br />
<br />
We sat on the bed and covered ourselves from the waist down with the blanket. I could feel Hana taking off her shorts as I took mine off. After a moment of shuffling and the rustling of clothes we were both totally naked under the bed sheets, I could feel Hana’s feet with my toes, she had her legs spread open just like me; after removing the blanket our most secret parts would be revealed<br />
<br />
My heart was beating at full throttle, and from the rising and lowering of Hana’s chest I could see she was taking large gulps of air<br />
<br />
“Well then, at the count of three”<br />
<br />
“One, two, three!” and we quickly took off the blanket<br />
<br />
“…”<br />
<br />
Yeah, Hana was indeed the owner of a hairless vagina. Mine, in contrast, have grown thicker with hair since last month and although it could not be considered a bush yet, the hair that was growing only on the outer lips in the past had spread to the surroundings now.<br />
The silence grew deafening as we both silently inspected and compared our most secret parts, so I thought I should say something before things turned awkward<br />
<br />
“Your vagina looks cute and clean, maybe I should shave mine, &#39;&#39; I said calmly but inside I was dying of embarrassment.<br />
<br />
“N-no, I think yours looks very good too, the contrast between the your white skin and the black hair makes you appear mature and sexy, I-I think you should leave it like that” Hana was so embarrassed that I was worried that she might just faint, but with an exertion of will, she continued.<br />
<br />
“Ca-Can I touch the hair? I want to know how it feels” <br />
<br />
I became baffled for a moment but quickly snapped out of it<br />
<br />
“S-Sure, go ahead”<br />
<br />
I prepared myself, but when Hana’s fingers touched my pubic area, it felt a little ticklish, but at the same time it started to generate the heat that I associated with arousal.<br />
<br />
She took the time to feel the texture and length of my little patch of hair, probably she spend one or two minutes checking, but by the time she finished I was taking deep gulps of air and my nipples were hardening<br />
<br />
“Do you want to touch something in return?” Hana offered with a mix of embarrassment  and maybe…some eagerness.<br />
<br />
“Then…your boobs”<br />
<br />
“S-Sure” she agreed and puffed up her chest for an easier reach.<br />
<br />
Her breasts were palm size and quite soft and springy, but I did notice that her nipples were getting hard and pointy. When I finished my fondling, she took the chance to massage mine, and so we continued with our mutual exploration. At the beginning we asked for permission each time, but by the fourth exchange, we just touched what we wanted in our turn and let ourselves be touched when the other’s turn came. It felt like a line had been crossed and we were closer than ever.<br />
<br />
It was Hana’s turn once again and this time with a small push, she made me lay on the bed while she spread my legs open, This was feeling more and more like the wrestling from before, just naked and without resisting <br />
<br />
With two fingers Hana spread my pussy open to look clearly at my insides.<br />
<br />
“Hey Dahlia, have you had your first period yet?” Hana asked<br />
<br />
I paused for a moment but replied honestly, “Not yet, what about you?”<br />
<br />
“Me neither, to be honest I am a little scared’ Hana replied hesitantly<br />
<br />
I just shifted my position and gave Hana a big hug, “Don’t worry, when the time comes, I will be there for you” <br />
<br />
She then reciprocated the hug and intertwined her legs with mine “Then when the time comes for you, I will take care of you as well” she said with a grin</p>
