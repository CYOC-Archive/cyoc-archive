<br />
Within the Anderson family basement, a full fledged orgy was in progress between William (werefox) and Martha (bi-werevixen) Anderson, their neighbors Samantha and Frances Twist (lesbian werecats), and their dinner guests Evan (werewolf) and Maggie (bi-werecat) Lawson.<br />
All were within their respective fursonas and enjoying a fast and furious (no pun intended) session of hot, sweaty sex.<br />
The men watched in rapt attention as the women had now formed a daisy chain, eating each others&#39; wet cunts and bringing them well beyond the peak of oral orgasms.<br />
Martha was lapping at Frances&#39; cunt, while she was licking away at Maggie&#39;s, who in turn was enjoying the tasty treats between Samantha&#39;s legs, while she ate Martha.<br />
Evan leaned over and whispered to William, &quot;The Twists are mighty tasty, but are you sure we can&#39;t talk Sam and Frances into...&quot;<br />
&quot;First off,&quot; whispered William in response, &quot;she hates the name Sam. So always call her Samantha. Secondly, I&#39;ve tried coaxing them on <i>numerous</i> occasions. They have no problem with being on the receiving end of oral sex or enjoying my leftovers inside Martha whenever it&#39;s just the four of us, and I know they play with <i>toys</i>, but I have yet to talk them into enjoying the real thing. I&#39;m sorry Martha still won&#39;t take any cock other than my own. She was that way long before we became bonded life/mates, but your wife is a fantastic fuck!&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; replied Evan. &quot;With Maggie being bi, I&#39;ve had plenty of fun with her and/or whatever women she brings home from time to time. I know she gets plenty of tail on the side, and is discrete about her male conquests, but Maggie always comes back to me at the end of her trysts and I do love her, so dealing with her werecat nature is easy.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve known Martha was bi since our college days. If it wasn&#39;t for me, she probably would have done everything she could to repress that to make her family happy, and then who knows how Martha would have turned out? Thankfully we have a good open relationship akin to yours, but we didn&#39;t become weres until after moving to Moon Lake over this past summer.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s a shame those two boys had to leave. Maggie was hoping to show Ben and Alex what they&#39;re missing in regards to women,&quot; commented Evan.<br />
<br />
SPEAKING OF WHO...<br />
&quot;Oh yes stud! Harder! Faster! Deeeper!&quot; howled Ben Twist (werewolf), as his boyfriend drove his lupine red rocket deeper into his lover&#39;s anus.<br />
Ben&#39;s tail teased the muzzle of Alex Ramsey&#39;s werewolf form, even as he moved to honor his beau&#39;s request. &quot;You&#39;ve got it handsome! Then don&#39;t forget, it&#39;s your turn to pleasure me again,&quot; he said, grabbing Ben&#39;s waist with both front paws and giving it all he had.<br />
&quot;At the rate you&#39;re going, you may have to give me some time to rest and settle for a little 69 until I&#39;m ready to go again,&quot; said Ben between grunts, before he started howling in pleasure.<br />
&quot;Whatever my love, as long as it&#39;s just us,&quot; promised Alex, even as he howled to accent the pleasure felt at releasing another hot load within Ben.<br />
While looking for a secluded spot to undress, change into their were forms, and begin their night together, Ben and Alex had discussed the way Mrs. Lawson was looking at them from time to time when she thought they weren&#39;t looking.<br />
&quot;Have you ever considered...&quot; began Ben, wondering how to properly phrase the question.<br />
&quot;Considered it? Yeah. Done it? Or even wanted to do it with a woman? No,&quot; replied Alex, while wrapping his arms around Ben. &quot;My folks tried setting me up from time to time when I was younger, back in junior high. The girls were nice, but we never got past the &#39;hang out and be polite to each other&#39; stage. Meanwhile, here we are,&quot; he added, looking deep into Ben&#39;s eyes. &quot;When I first met you in kindergarten, I knew there was something special about you, which is why we instantly became best friends, even before we found out we were fellow werewolves. Granted, I had no way of knowing what a homosexual was then, let alone that I was one. But every time my folks tried playing matchmaker, I kept thinking <i>Why can&#39;t I go out with Ben?</i> When I finally got up the courage to ask them...&quot;<br />
&quot;I think being lesbians, my moms tumbled on to the truth about us before your parents did. I&#39;m so glad they had the courage to talk to your folks about us, because it was getting to the point where all I could think about sexually or romantically was you,&quot; admitted Ben. &quot;Being straight, it probably took the Ramseys a bit longer to accept us, but once they did...&quot;<br />
Then the loving couple kissed, as passion took over.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
&quot;Oh, my werewolf, that was wonderful,&quot; moaned the werepanthress, as her lover Nate Anderson laid his furry form near her. His paws gently wrapped around her sleek black fur as he felt his cock still twitching deep within her well lubricated vagina.<br />
&quot;There is just something about you...&quot; replied Nate, nuzzling her neck. &quot;I do have one request though...&quot; <i>Proceed cautiously,</i> he silently warned himself.<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; asked the werepanthress, eyeing him closely.<br />
&quot;I also desire to experience you in our other forms.&quot;<br />
&quot;Is that all?&quot; she said with a smile before kissing him. &quot;Well, since you <i>are</i> spending the weekend with me, and since the laws of Moon Lake do not allow us to be weres during the daylight except at sanctioned events and life threatening emergencies, there will be plenty of time to explore our duller sides once we&#39;re back at my place.&quot;<br />
The thought of being led back to her place, let alone having the chance to discover who the werepanthress really was, made Nate smile, but he couldn&#39;t help but ask, &quot;Duller sides?&quot;<br />
&quot;The plain, ordinary, furless beings we have to be at least part of the time instead of who we <i>really</i> are,&quot; explained the werepanthress, rolling them over with Nate&#39;s red rocket still buried deep within her so that she was now in the dominant position. &quot;If I could, I would be the panthress every moment of every hour of every day for the rest of eternity. Alas, that will not help me keep a roof over my head and food on the table. My night job allows me that freedom to an extent, but even it doesn&#39;t pay all the bills either. But enough silly talk. Now is the time for more exciting things,&quot; said the panthress, as she grabbed Nate&#39;s paws and raised them to her breasts.<br />
As Nate started fondling her tits and tweaking the ever hard nipples, she began riding him to yet another glorious serious of orgasms, even as Nate wondered what the hell he was getting into.<br />
<br />
CONCURRENTLY...<br />
Brian Walker (were-otter) counted himself lucky that his night with Julie Stovall had been interrupted, so he was able to get home before his mother. He had a relatively plausible excuse planned out with his best friend, who promised to cover for him if needed, but now Brian could save that for another time.<br />
Since his father left them for a were-sea lioness, his mother (a fellow were-otter) had been beside herself. She would be the first to admit that trying to support them and keep herself together at the same time was hard. If asked, Brian would say she was doing good at the first task, but lousy at the second. Mrs. Walker now held down two jobs and had moved them to her mother&#39;s house when she could no longer afford the mortgage on their old home. Not that his grandma wasn&#39;t a nice lady, but being a much older were, she was always in bed by 9, leaving Brian alone a lot unless his mom was home.<br />
Even then, he didn&#39;t get to see her that often as it was. As usual, after chatting for a few minutes to catch each other up on their respective days, his mother was so tired from holding down two jobs that she went to bed as well.<br />
Resigned to spend the rest of the night by himself, Brian had just called up his favorite porn site on his personal computer when there was a slight tapping sound on his bedroom window.<br />
Being a one story house, that wasn&#39;t a surprise. Knowing his new situation, a lot of his friends visited clandestinely when it was &quot;safe&quot;, but who was at the window now was a shock.<br />
&quot;Julie!&quot; hissed Brian, as he slowly opened the window. &quot;You&#39;re not trying to get me into any trouble, are you?&quot;<br />
&quot;No handsome,&quot; replied Julie Stovall (were-mermaid), before kissing him. &quot;But I&#39;m horny as hell and you&#39;ve got the cock I want,&quot; she announced, smiling at him before climbing through the screen less window into his room. &quot;This place doesn&#39;t have a pool, does it?&quot; Julie asked, as she started undressing and noticed her lover&#39;s penis rising to attention.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
Spencer Lawson (hybrid werewolf/werecat) led a soaking wet Eric Anderson (normal human being) back to her place. Letting them in the back door put them right by the laundry room.<br />
Without a second thought, she completely stripped in front of Eric before grabbing two towels out of the basket of clean linen that she had yet to put up as part of her weekend long house arrest.<br />
She started drying herself off with one as she handed the other towel to Eric. &quot;Strip and throw your stuff in the dryer. I&#39;ll turn it on as soon as I get back,&quot; she said, taking off to get herself some fresh clothes, and noticing that she was turning Eric on in the process, for he stared at her more than anything else the whole time she was in the laundry room.<br />
By the time she got back, Spencer was wearing a different outfit and carrying a bathrobe for Eric, who had done everything she asked and now had the towel around his waist; although she couldn&#39;t help noticing the nice peak in the front of it.<br />
&quot;Hope you don&#39;t mind a pink bathrobe, but I couldn&#39;t risk having you wear one of mom or dad&#39;s and having them pick up your scent.&quot;<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; said Eric, while slipping it on. While the young Anderson only had a regular human&#39;s sense of smell, he couldn&#39;t help noticing the heady scent of young woman coming from the pink flannel.<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; said Spencer, turning on the dryer, &quot;I&#39;ll nuke us some popcorn and then...&quot;<br />
&quot;Listen. If it&#39;s okay with you, instead of TV, do you mind if we just talk?&quot; asked Eric.<br />
&quot;Err, sure,&quot; replied Spencer. &quot;But you&#39;re still getting popcorn,&quot; wondering if she could or should talk Eric into more.<br />
<br />
Soon, the teenagers were splitting a bag of microwave popcorn between them while each had a can of soda.<br />
Eric was hesitant at first, but soon found himself telling Spencer <i>everything</i>, from his bookish, nerdy life back in Minnesota to his family moving to Moon Lake when his father was offered a better teaching position at Moon Lake College.<br />
In between he told her about Nate fulfilling his lifelong fantasy of becoming a werewolf after Samantha Twist visited them in her capacity as Town Chancellor to explain the &quot;mandatory were&quot; policy. While Nate was ecstatic and his folks puzzled over this new development, Samantha and his mother instantly hit it off, which soon led to his parents deciding to become werefoxes together, and then his mother fully started exploring all her sexual options as a bi-were of Moon Lake, including Samantha and Frances Twist.<br />
&quot;Nate knew sooner than I did about the... arrangement my folks have,&quot; revealed Eric, before telling Spencer about how his mother would take up with any female that struck her fancy even before the move and becoming weres, with and without his father&#39;s involvement, &quot;but even before establishing the vulpine life/mate bond between them, he&#39;s the only man she&#39;s ever had sex with.&quot;<br />
&quot;Kind of like my folks. Mom truly swings both ways. Dad&#39;s joined in from time to time for the extra women, but otherwise is as straight as the proverbial arrow. Yet she always comes home to him. They call it an open marriage.&quot;<br />
&quot;Theirs sounds more open than my folks, since mom only goes for other women,&quot; observed Eric.<br />
&quot;Who are we to say?&quot; asked Spencer in return. &quot;As long as they&#39;re happy and together, that&#39;s the main thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then Eric&#39;s mood drastically changed as he started talking about more recent events, including his rocky courtship with Julie Stovall, something not helped by the interruptions in her life caused by her parents&#39; problems.<br />
&quot;Part of the reason my folks decided to move was that they thought the change in scenery would do me some good. But I&#39;m still as bashful, bookish, and nerdy as I was before, if not more so now since that&#39;s about the only thing I know how to do properly. She made the first move and granted, there is something special about Julie. I do have <i>some</i> genuine feelings for her, but even if it&#39;s possible for me to be so someday, I&#39;m not <i>truly</i> in love with her now, even if I actually knew what love is. Don&#39;t get me wrong. Julie deserves someone steady in her life, whether it&#39;s that guy I saw fucking her in her pool tonight or someone else. I just don&#39;t know whether or not it will ever be me. Not that I don&#39;t enjoy the attention occasionally, but there&#39;s times when she&#39;s <i>always</i> coming on to me. I mean, being 14, I have hormones and urges too, but...&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the part about becoming a were,&quot; realized Spencer. &quot;Even if you and Julie don&#39;t live happily forever after, that <i>is</i> a lifetime commitment.&quot;<br />
&quot;Honestly? I&#39;m looking forward to becoming a were at some point,&quot; admitted Eric. &quot;I now really think it&#39;s neat being able to be more than just an ordinary human being, especially since it&#39;s not limited to just a full moon or all those other cliches.&quot;<br />
&quot;The humans that know we exist call us anthropomorphic.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know. It&#39;s just what <i>kind</i> of were I should become that&#39;s the unanswered question as far as I&#39;m concerned.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; said Spencer, studying Eric carefully. &quot;If Julie turns out to be &#39;the one&#39;, you should at least become something water based, if not a were-merman.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know. But becoming a were is a one shot deal. Once you have your first change, you can&#39;t decide to become something else later. My folks are happy being mated werefoxes together, and Nate&#39;s on Cloud 12 being a werewolf, but I never actually thought something like this was even possible before moving to Moon Lake, so never gave the possibility of being anything besides human any thought before now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see. Now that I think about it, I guess naturally born weres do have it easy compared to normals,&quot; observed Spencer. &quot;We&#39;re taught from birth to be the were we are and never think of what it might have been like to be a different species. Except for people like me.&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Eric.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right. You were still upstairs when I told your folks and the Twists. A mixed were race child usually takes after the parent of the same gender, but I&#39;m a naturally born hybrid between my werewolf father and werecat mother. Want to see?&quot;<br />
&quot;If you don&#39;t mind,&quot; said Eric, to which Spencer&#39;s response was to start undressing seductively before him, and soon there was a black furred hybrid were wolf/cat standing before the amazed teenager.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s really neat,&quot; replied Eric, smiling at Spencer, as she turned this way and that so he could see <i>everything</i>.<br />
In turn, she could see that Eric&#39;s interest and attraction to her was genuine, especially by the rising indicator between his legs.<br />
&quot;You know,&quot; began Eric, eyeing her closely as he gently ran a hand through her soft fur.<br />
&quot;Whoa there buddy. A few things you should know beforehand,&quot; warned Spencer, as she changed back into her human form and slipped her panties back on.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t deny that I&#39;m starting to feel something for you, and I don&#39;t mean sexually,&quot; she lied, not being able to keep herself from stealing glances at Eric&#39;s growing penis when he wasn&#39;t aware of them.<br />
&quot;But first off, I don&#39;t take a guy on the rebound. I&#39;ve had that happen to me a few times as it is, so you have to work things out one way or the other with Julie first. If you&#39;re available afterward, then I&#39;m <i>very</i> interested,&quot; said Spencer, cupping her naked bosom to indicate the hard nipples before Eric as she ogled him some more.<br />
&quot;Secondly, if a relationship between us does go <i>that</i> far,&quot; she said, briefly recalling her thoughts about teaching Eric <b>everything</b> he would ever need to know about pleasing a woman, &quot;being a hybrid, I honestly don&#39;t know what would happen to you. Your new were self could favor the wolf. If it favors the cat, there&#39;s a risk of you also becoming at least bi, if not an outright homosexual like Ben and Alex in the process; since my mom is a domestic based cat in her were form and they always tend to be either bi or gay for some reason.&quot;<br />
&quot;Like the Twists,&quot; realized Eric.<br />
&quot;Yeah, but in all honesty, I prefer you straight,&quot; added Spencer, not bothering to mention her own occasional forays into lesbianism.<br />
&quot;Or I could beat the odds and become a hybrid like you,&quot; said Eric, hopefully.<br />
&quot;I think your chances of getting struck by lighting on a hot sunny day with totally clear skies are better than that,&quot; commented Spencer. <i>You could always become a were by someone else first, but then I wouldn&#39;t have the honor and pleasure of taking your virginity.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Why does life have to be so complicated,&quot; asked Eric in a depressed tone of voice, while laying his head down on the kitchen table.<br />
&quot;I honestly don&#39;t know,&quot; admitted Spencer, gently caressing his hair with a genuine affection that surprised even her. &quot;I&#39;ve certainly had more than my fair share of troubles.&quot; <i>And caused some too,</i> she realized. &quot;But there are two things you can count on from this moment forward. The first is that you&#39;ve made a new friend tonight.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really? What&#39;s the second?&quot; asked Eric, raising his head to look at Spencer.<br />
Yet she wasn&#39;t there!<br />
<br />
Eric was about to say something when he suddenly felt the towel being removed from around his waist, as a pair of soft lips started caressing his penis.<br />
Soon a pair of hands was massaging and caressing his boyhood as Eric felt the head slip into something moist.<br />
&quot;Spencer, I—&quot; Eric started to say, only to feel greater suction being applied to his dick before it exploded inside Spencer&#39;s mouth.<br />
Then Eric felt a soft tongue caressing his spent rod, before Spencer reappeared from underneath the table, licking her lips and smiling at him.<br />
&quot;The second thing is, friends <i>always</i> look out for each other. You said that Julie left you high and dry. Problem solved. Now we better get dressed and get you home for the night before my folks come home and yours start wondering where you are,&quot; said Spencer, while glancing at the kitchen wall clock and noticing it was almost midnight.<br />
<i>Eric not only tastes good, but he&#39;s cute too. If I&#39;m not careful, I could easily fall for him in a heartbeat!</i> realized Spencer, as she went to collect his things from the dryer.</p>
