<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As I woke up I could feel my morning wood straining against my underwear. My dreams had been a frenzy of lust addled visions, scenes of my Brother and Father both transformed into cock addled sluts, deluded into giving their bodies over to be used by horny men. My Mother pleasantly oblivious to the depravity occurring in front of her eyes.<br />
<br />
Lighting up a cigarette, I lazily stroked my cock as I soaked in the after images of the vivid sex dream. It would be a shame that I would soon forget it.<br />
Taking another large drag from the dwindling stick in my fingers, I felt bad that the dream couldn&#39;t become reality.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute.&quot; I said out loud quickly dashed to his computer and starting typing furiously, capturing every detail I could before the dream faded. <br />
&quot;Are you actually studying?&quot; Aaron&#39;s surprised voice echoed from the open doorway, Aaron leaning in the doorway in a black tank top and blue running shorts, his hand already sliding underneath the elastic to begin edging himself.<br />
<br />
Staring at the growing bulge I was tempted to pull my own aching cock out, knowing that Aaron would service it, but this was more important.<br />
&quot;Yeah, I am for once. Why don&#39;t you give me some privacy and I&#39;ll catch up with you later.&quot;<br />
I said, dismissing him. I had the last few weeks messing with Aaron to take him down a peg, but I never had a clear goal in mind. <br />
Now I did.<br />
<br />
It would take a complicated set of hypnotic sleep plans, including recordings but I couldn&#39;t risk anyone finding the recordings and linking it to me. Suddenly I started laughing out loud. It didn&#39;t have to be recordings of MY voice to keep reinforcing everything.<br />
<br />
I would soon change all three members of my family, a concrete plan laid out to all but one single detail. A not so subtle sign for Aaron to indicate that his subservience to &#39;gods&#39; will was having a positive impact on me, and that he should dive first into the rabbit hole I was going to lay before him. Lighting up another smoke, I sat there savoring it, as I heard my mother and Aaron chatting away in the hallway. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know! He&#39;s actually studying instead of playing some game. This is a good start at least. Right?&quot; Aaron&#39;s enthusiasm clear as he talked animatedly.<br />
&quot;I know honey, but he&#39;s still puffing away on those devil sticks. Ugh! I can smell it from here. One day of studying doesn&#39;t stop my house and my work clothes having that smokey stench embedded in them.&quot;<br />
&quot;But Mum, this is a sign! A sign that all I&#39;ve done for him over the last few weeks has been for something good.&quot;<br />
&quot;All you&#39;ve done for him? What have you done for him these last few weeks? Have you been giving him money?&quot;<br />
&quot;No! Nothing like that, I meant all the things I&#39;ve done for... for the lord these last few weeks. I&#39;ve been praying devoutly to relieve Chris of his lust and wickedness lately. I&#39;ve been doing everything I can.&quot;<br />
<br />
As I dropped the butt in a glass next to my computer, The final piece became clear. That for my vision to become a reality, I would have to sacrifice something dear to me. <br />
Sighing I checked my drawer. I had three full packs of smokes, enough to last me two weeks normally. Typing up a few more lines, I dug out an old portable tape recorder and mentally prepared myself. <br />
Four weeks. <br />
In four weeks I would no longer smoke but my other plans would have come to fruition.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
It was 9pm that evening when I put my plan into action. It was a Thursday and so I knew dad would be at the racetrack gambling away whatever little spending money was available for our family. He wouldn&#39;t be back until after midnight, drunk as usual, collapsing like a dead weight on the couch.<br />
<br />
Mum was currently sewing in her room, nearly finished on a bridesmaids dress that had be ready in the morning. I had checked her progress, bringing her a piping hot cup of tea.<br />
She had been suspicious of my sudden niceness. Very normal considering my usual indifference and apathy towards her. I had found out she was nearly done with the dress and then she would be going to bed, under the guise of asking for help getting some prescription medication to help quit smoking. I don&#39;t think her eyes have ever gone that wide before.<br />
<br />
&quot;That means I would have to lie to a doctor or chemist, and the medicine isn&#39;t cheap, but I&#39;ll think about.&quot; She said as I sheepishly ducked out of the room.<br />
One piece laid down. The Next piece was Aaron.<br />
<br />
I found Aaron studying in his room, and was tempted to get my cock sucked again, but that might have ruined my plan. <br />
&quot;Hey Aaron, this might sound a bit weird but, I need a little favor, to help me with some schoolwork...&quot; I said, standing in the doorway. <br />
&quot;Ok. What&#39;s this favor.&quot; Aaron eyed me with suspicion. His prior programming still intact as he started edging his cock inside his pants.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m trying to wake up earlier to get this book report done so I can pass my English class, but I can&#39;t help pushing the snooze button. I was up early today but I had pushed snooze 3 times already. I... I need you to help wake me up earlier since you are already getting up for the gym.&quot;<br />
Aaron eyed me for a long moment before sighing and nodding.<br />
&quot;Alright Chris, anything to help my little brother get on top of his school work.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks bro! I&#39;ll see you in the morning, I&#39;m gonna have an early night tonight.&quot; I said, leaving my brother in peace. <br />
<br />
As I left the room, Aaron&#39;s hand slowly emerged from his pants as he tried to get back to his own studies. He was still suffering from two weeks of not cumming, and the constant edging was getting to him.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
It was 11pm and the house was quiet, as I slipped out of my room and down the hallway to my brothers room. <br />
<br />
“This is God talking to you, Aaron. I want you to go deeper and deeper and get more and more relaxed so I can talk to you and tell you what I want for you.” Aaron’s eyelids once again started to flutter so Chris new the treatment was working. “Your right hand is feeling very light – like a balloon – and it is starting to rise up in the air.” His right hand started to rise, smoothly as if it was weightless. The process of slipping into the trance becoming progressively easier for Aaron&#39;s mind.<br />
“Aaron you will be able to talk to me, but you will remain deeply asleep until I wake you. Do you understand?”<br />
“Yes” He replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Now it has come to my attention that you have been avoiding your brother. Taking steps to leave the house before he is awake and spending more time away from home. Why is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Forgive me lord. I&#39;m struggling with my own lust. My own body seeking pleasure and release that I can&#39;t give it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Talk more openly with me, in detail about how you are struggling.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I-I&#39;m erect all the time. My testicles churning, throbbing and aching. They feel full and tender. My cock leaks, continiously throughout the day and I dream. I dream such sinful things about the girls in my classes and at the gym, dreams that cause me to wake. Still hard and leaking even more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand my child. I have placed a heavy burden on you, but I chose you because I thought you could bear the burden on your own. It is clear to me, that is not the case, and so you must share the burden with another man of your blood to help save Chris. Do you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;yes&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And who do I speak of?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My father.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good, but do not approach him. Instead, he will come to you. On his own journey, guided by me. Do you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good. He will be on his own path, and so to avoid confusing each other, you must not speak of my instruction to each other. Do you understand?”<br />
<br />
“I do, lord.”<br />
<br />
“And one final instruction, Aaron. To truly understand the lust you are fighting within Chris, you must focus your own inner desires. Instead of thinking of girls, you must focus on pleasure. The pleasure of your own body, of your own cock, of Chris&#39; cock in your mouth, the touch, the taste, the feeling of his dick pulsing hot cum down your throat. Your mind must remained focused on these things. Do you understand?”<br />
<br />
“I do my lord.”<br />
<br />
“Good. Now sleep.” I beamed as I crept out of Aaron&#39;s room and down the corridor towards my mothers room. Step one completed.<br />
<br />
Leaving my mothers room I smiled, knowing I had put the first steps into action.<br />
My mother had been susceptible to the hypnotic sleep, and the next evening she would ask me for one of my old tape recorders. <br />
Over the next few weeks she would hypnotize herself repeatedly to focus on the good and ignore the bad, making her happier and oblivious to any weird events happening within her own home. She would know things were working as the smell of cigarettes faded from our house, as I was the most troublesome. Therefore if I gave up smoking, then her home was doing better. <br />
<br />
Damn my mother had a twisted way of thinking.<br />
<br />
Laying a warm blanket on the downstairs couch, I went back upstairs to my own bed. The next step was a gamble.<br />
<br />
<br />
It was 7:30 am and I groggily raised my head as Aaron shook my shoulder. I could see him in a plain white tank top and black running shorts, his hand working his engorged shaft inside as he urged me to wake.<br />
<br />
“Wake up little bro&#39;, you got that book report to do, so rise and shine.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks bro.” I said sleepily. As I climbed out of bed, Aaron turned quickly to leave. <br />
“Aaron, wait.” Aaron froze just before the door frame, his hand inside his running shorts the only thing moving.<br />
“Why don&#39;t you hang in here for a little bit while I do some work. Come and strand by the mirror for a moment.”<br />
Aaron sighed before begrudgingly stepping over to the mirror.<br />
<br />
“Aw, don&#39;t be like that. I just wanted you to take a look at yourself the way I see you. You are such a good brother you know.” I said as I guided him to face the mirror, pulling the front of his tank top behind his head revealing his developing pecs and his developing six pack abs.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing bro?” Aaron asked cautiously, his hand still slowly stroking and pumping within his shorts.<br />
<br />
“Just look at your body. Really look at it. Don&#39;t you see how sexy you are? All those muscles you are working on at the gym, the almost drunk look in your eyes when you edger yourself for hours. This big hard leaky dick of yours.” I said <br />
as I pulled his shorts down, revealing his fist slowly pumping his thick 9” fuck stick. <br />
<br />
“I- I don&#39;t know what you want me to see little bro.” Aaron replied shakily, his eyes scanning his own reflection before turning back to me.<br />
<br />
“Then why don&#39;t you spend some time here really looking at your own reflection, while I finish my book report. Just focus all your senses on your own body and its reflection in the mirror. I&#39;ll be here typing the entire time.” I whispered in Aaron&#39;s ear as I reached around and gave his abs an affectionate rub, my fingers lingering just a moment longer then appropriate.<br />
<br />
“I- I shouldn&#39;t, but....” Aaron mumbled as his eyed started to hone in on his reflection in more detail, before stepping forward slightly to get a better look.<br />
<br />
I watched for a few minutes, as Aaron blocked out the entire would from his mind and edged and jerked himself, his eyes glazing over slightly as he flexed and posed for himself, quiet moans and gasps escaping his lips every time he had to stop. Denying himself the right to cum.<br />
<br />
Stepping out in the hallway, I looked in and saw Aaron had not noticed I had left the room, his body flexing and writhing as he mercilessly edged himself alone in my room. Perfect, I thought as I quickly headed downstairs to the lounge.<br />
<br />
I checked the driveway and saw that mum&#39;s care had already left for the morning, and that on the couch in the living room, my father had drunkenly rolled himself up in the blanket I had left for him, obviously being so drunk on returning home, the blanket was more enticing then navigating the stairs up.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, I stepped forward and got to work.<br />
<br />
<br />
It was nearly 9am when I turned to head back upstairs.<br />
<br />
My fathers drunken mind taking some time, and lots of repetition to absorb a few small commands, but I was confident that at least some would stick.<br />
If everything went to plan, he would find less and less enjoyment in drinking, gambling and going to strip clubs, finding out over the next two weeks that they didn&#39;t entice him. Instead he would look at Aaron, and in admiration of his body, start emulating his fitness regime. He would take on Aaron&#39;s vow of chastity, and not masturbate or attempt to have sex with mum (Which he often did when heavily drunk, so this in turn would make mother happier).<br />
<br />
The hardest part would be the new itchiness that would start to affect his ass. Slowly getting more and more insistent, distracting and even maddening, until he ends up getting something small to put in there. The idea would come to him later when he searched for answers on his phone, only to find he had a screenshot of a butt plug ad stored in his phone.<br />
<br />
I just had to hope that the commands had all soaked in and see how things turned out over the next few weeks.<br />
<br />
Returning to my room I found Aaron leaning against the mirror, his hot breath fogging up the glass, which glistened from all the smeared pre cum on it. His body was shiny with sweat as moaned, his legs quivering slightly as he desperately fought not to cum.<br />
<br />
It was so fucking hot to mess with him like this.<br />
<br />
Walking up behind him, I leaned forward and whispered into his ear. “Book reports done bro. All thanks to you. But I need a bit more help from you.” My hands guiding him down to his knees, my hard cock sliding into his groaning mouth.<br />
<br />
I turned his head to the side, making him lick my shaft as smirked down at him, enjoying the lust drunk droopy eyelids and  his ragged panting breath, hot against my throbbing dick.<br />
<br />
“Look at yourself in the mirror, big bro&#39;.  Look how depraved and slutty you look right now. Like an absolute cock slut. Yeah. I like the sound of that. No, not the sound of me slapping your face with my hard dick, but the words cock slut. Are you looking at yourself in the mirror? Seeing yourself in your knees, your mouth desperately searching for my hard dick. Desperate to make me cum.  Maybe you&#39;ll finally be able to cum if you swallow my load again. You want to cum big bro?”<br />
<br />
I looked down to see Aaron groaning in frustration, saliva dripping from his chin as his whole body shook. I could see what was about to happen. He was about to burst. <br />
Pulling my cock away, I stepped backwards. <br />
I knew what I had  to do.<br />
<br />
“Look at yourself in the mirror, don&#39;t close your eyes or look away. Watch yourself as you cum all over yourself. Go on big bro&#39;, SHOOT IT!”<br />
<br />
Aaron&#39;s face went bright red as he held his breath, his mind still fighting against cumming, against the sin of masturbation. His body was no longer responding.<br />
<br />
Cum erupted from Aaron&#39;s cock, thick streams of hot cum launching into the air, above his head before descending down upon him like hot rain. Incomprehensible groans escaped from deep with Aaron&#39;s chest, his entire body shuddering. His eyes forced to watch his reflection, burning every detail into is memory. It was almost too much for his mind to take.<br />
<br />
Panting, splattered with his own hot seed, Aaron knelt on his knees, staring at himself, betrayed by his own body during his path to becoming the highest of the high. <br />
<br />
I stepped forward again, not giving Aaron time to collect himself. His hand was still stroking his cock, and my own cock was now desperate for release after watching him shoot like that. <br />
I promptly shoved my cock down his throat, my half stunned big brother instinctively suckling on it, as his eyes looked up at me pleadingly.<br />
<br />
Smirking down cruelly, I had another idea.<br />
“Hey big bro&#39; I got a challenge for ya. Why don&#39;t you see if you can cum again before I bust?”<br />
The confusion in his eyes grew as his subconscious drove him forward, his hands now working his cock furiously.<br />
I grinned knowing that his subconscious conditioning meant he would try to do anything I said when we were alone, even things his mind would be screaming out against.<br />
<br />
I took my time, slowly thrusting my hips forward and back, making him work for my cum, as he moaned around my cock, the glazed look slowly returning. <br />
I was getting close.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Aaron&#39;s body was convulsing underneath me, hot cum spraying against his chest, and up the back of my pants. The look of frustration and defeat in his eyes as he stared up at me, as his throat moaned around my cock tipped me over the edge.<br />
<br />
I grabbed the back of his head and forced his nose into my pubes, his convulsing body milking my load straight down his throat as I stared down at his panicked eyes. <br />
<br />
Then all of a sudden it was over. I released Aaron&#39;s head and he collapsed onto the floor, his hand still slowly jerking his deflating cock. There was no way he was going to be able to cum again for a little while. I sat on the edge of my bed, enjoying the sight of my brother coated in his own cum, enjoying the humiliation he must be feeling inside.<br />
<br />
There was one more step to the plan for today, however, and now was the perfect time to put things in motion.<br />
Flicking my computer off sleep mode, I printed the book report that I had prepared the previous day.<br />
The best lies were always built on truths.<br />
<br />
Picking up the pages I waved them in front of Aaron&#39;s panting face.<br />
<br />
“Big bro! I can&#39;t believe I finished it so quickly. Having you in here while I worked really helped. Come on and lets get ready for school.”<br />
<br />
Sitting himself up onto his knees, he stared at me with a confused look. <br />
“Umm, bro. Don&#39;t you, um, normally make me swallow two lots of your-” Aaron trailed off as I pulled on some track pants that weren&#39;t stained with his cum.<br />
“I don&#39;t feel like I need to for some weird reason. Strange.”  I pretended to ponder this dilemma. “But if you really need to eat a second load, why don&#39;t you eat your own off yourself? You are an absolute mess right now.” <br />
I laughed, as his fingers started scooping up globs of his cum and feeding it to himself. His face still conveying shock that I DIDN&#39;T want a second blowjob.<br />
<br />
I could see his thoughts now. Maybe my good for nothing little brother IS changing for the better.<br />
I was fully dressed now, and absolutely starving by this point.<br />
“Hey Aaron. While you go shower and get changed, why don&#39;t I make us some breakfast? I&#39;m craving some fried bacon and eggs right now.”<br />
<br />
Aaron&#39;s jaw almost hit the floor as he stumbled to his feet, wobbling slightly as he stumbled to the door, his finger still licking up the last few visible drops of his load. With a small nod Aaron fled my room, his hand releasing his sore deflated dick as he crossed the threshold, only to go straight to his mouth. His tongue extracting every last bit of his hot cum from it.<br />
<br />
Lighting up a smoke, I leaned back and collected myself. Starting tonight, I would be listening to my own tape, and in a few weeks, I would have given up smoking for the rest of my life.<br />
A small trade off for the depraved pleasures I was going to gain from having control of my family.</p>
