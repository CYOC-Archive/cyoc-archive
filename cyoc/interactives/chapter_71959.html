<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Cold Weather Warmth.&quot; Gina read the ice blue can with a picture of a polar bear on it. &quot;Why's it say 'Winter <br />
Use Only'?&quot;<br />
<br />
James looked at the can and shrugged. &quot;Not sure. Maybe it's got chemicals in it that can't be stored in heat?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gina looked at James strangely. &quot;How do you not know? Don't you work here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...well, yeah, but Dr. Noriko doesn't really tell me anything. I just do the basic stuff she tells me to...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I sure hope I get to meet this doctor at some point...&quot; Gina popped the can anyway. &quot;Just so long as I <br />
get paid, James...&quot; She brought the can to her mouth and took a few gulps of the drink, noting that it tasted <br />
like mint. Gina had to swallowed hard. &quot;Ick. It's kind of thick... like heavy cream...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, good. Now we wait for any 'side effects' to appear. And no, sorry, I don't know what those side effects <br />
would be. But Dr. Noriko should be here in a little while to evaluate you.&quot; James leaned on the table crossing <br />
his arms and smiling. &quot;So I hope you like waiting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gina kept from making eye contact with James; she felt that if she did, she'd start blushing. James was really <br />
quite handsome, with light blue eyes and tanned, light brown skin. Scraggly black hair fell just a bit over <br />
his face, with a rugged 5 'o-clock shadow around his mouth and cheeks. And under his light green scrubs, he <br />
clearly worked out, six feet tall and athletic. Gina looked over to the wall, where there was a full length <br />
mirror- she'd never been particularly self conscious before, and she hated the idea that a boy she just met <br />
would make her feel weak in the knees. But seeing how attractive James was, compared to how attractive she <br />
was- five feet five inches, rather flat chested, flat rear, thin lips; not what she'd call ugly by any <br />
stretch, but certainly nothing special. It didn't help that, in the mirror, her clothes looked tighter than <br />
she remembered, shirt stretched across her torso and the waist of her jeans digging into her hips.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... how did you start working here, James?&quot; Gina said, hoping to take her mind off herself. She also hoped <br />
she wasn't blushing; her body was starting to feel warm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... well, I went to college to be a nurse for about four years. Was almost top of my class, too, when I <br />
graduated. 'Course, I couldn't find work afterwards, and I didn't want to move back in with my parents. Lucky <br />
for me, Dr. Noriko was looking for qualified nurses to help with her &quot;studies&quot;. I signed up and I've been here <br />
for about six months now.&quot; James sighed. &quot;It's not really what I expected, though. Mostly just me and Dottie <br />
keeping the place clean. Dr. Noriko stops in every now and again, but she always heads to her lab in the back. <br />
You're actually the first person to ever respond to the ad, Ms. Cantelli.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-you can call me Gina.&quot; She mentally punched herself for stuttering.<br />
<br />
James smiled anyway though. &quot;Okay, Gina. How about you? What are you here for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um- cash.&quot; Gina knew she must be blushing fiercely, her body felt steaming, and her clothes felt tighter than <br />
ever. Her bra and panties dug into her skin more than ever before. &quot;I mean- after I got out of high school, I <br />
couldn't afford college or anything like that and I've just sort of... been at home for a while.&quot; Her story <br />
sounded a lot more pathetic than she thought it would next to James'. He was looking at her funny, too, and oh <br />
god, he was probably thinking what a loser she was and-<br />
<br />
&quot;Gina, do you have allergies?&quot; James asked seriously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? I... no, never have. Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because your face looks... swollen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Worried, Gina looked at the full length mirror again and she saw what James meant. Her cheeks were much <br />
chubbier looking than they had been, full and round like a squirrel with nuts in it's mouth. Her lips looked <br />
swollen, too, plumper and poutier than before. She stood up, frightened, and noticed than her face wasn't the <br />
only thing that had blown up.<br />
<br />
Gina's belly stuck slightly out from under her shirt, tight and round, like she was just showing signs of <br />
pregnancy. Her breasts were larger as well, at least a B cup now, double the size they were, her bra digging <br />
into her. Her hips were much wider now too, making her look actually womanly, her ass swollen larger too, <br />
making her panties feel far too tight. All in all, Gina looked like a chubbier version of her normal self.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you feeling alright? Can you breathe fine?&quot; James said, grabbing her wrist and feeling her pulse.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I feel fine! Just really warm! What's happening to me?!&quot; Between her whole body swelling up and James <br />
suddenly getting so close to her- and touching her- Gina was starting to panic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, wait here,&quot; James said calmly, holding one hand up. &quot;I'm going to get Dr. Noriko and see what she <br />
thinks about this. Your pulse is fine and you don't seem allergic, you're just... I'll be right back, okay?&quot; <br />
He didn't wait for her to answer before practically running through the door, leaving Gina lone.<br />
<br />
Gina looked into the mirror again, worried about what was happening to her. And did she look even bigger than <br />
before? She certainly felt heavy, and her body was still very warm. She brought her hands to her belly, <br />
feeling how it was heavier, unsure what to do next.</p>
