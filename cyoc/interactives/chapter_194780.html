<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;How is it more embarrassing than learning to walk around naked?&quot; Michael asked from his spot on the bed, naked and on top of the covers. A fire blazed in the bedroom&#39;s fireplace and Otso sat in the room&#39;s solitary lounge chair, reading. Michael had set his own book on the histories of the wolf tribe aside. It was amazing how quickly their relationship had evolved into enjoying spending quiet time together in the same room. Sure the sex was fantastic, but the steady calm presence of Otso had an effect on Michael he had never expected. The wolf&#39;s presence simply allowed him to relax.<br />
<br />
&quot;It just is. It&#39;s not something you show off. You use it when needed.&quot; Otso lowered the medical journal he had be browsing, fixing Michael with one of his faux stern looks. One he adopted when the transitioning human stepped on some unspoken custom, which Michael seemed to do with regularity.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not showing off. I just want to see it. I want to know that if we go to Florence or London on vacation that the man on my arm won&#39;t make me look like a troll in comparison.&quot; Michael teased lightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds more like you want to make sure I don&#39;t look like a troll.&quot; Otso said with only mild reproof. Michael hoped he knew he was just curious about their relationship moving forward, as he should be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, you probably look like an underwear model. Hot Nordic hunk in skimpy briefs.&quot; Michael teased playfully, moving his head aside as a pillow came flying in his direction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I did do some.&quot; Otso looked at Michael as the human tilted his head in a canine gesture of curiosity. He was beginning to pick up mannerisms and body language almost unconsciously. &quot;Underwear modelling, for a little extra money in college. It&#39;s just, I haven&#39;t had much chance to take the form in a few years and I&#39;m not sure how I&#39;ve aged.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael looked Otso up and down pointedly. &quot;Love. You&#39;re beautiful, you couldn&#39;t be anything other than stunning. Please? For me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Otso sighed and stood. Despite not having taken human shape in a while, the doctor had spent so long in it it seemed to come naturally to him. The change was quick and smooth, with no awkward slow middle ground like Michael had seen with some of the reindeer. White fur retreated into his body, revealing the lean, firm muscles Michal had been enjoying feeling under the fur, but could now see in all their glory. His stance shifted subtly and gracefully has he planted human feet on the floor, though his tail disappearing caused the wolf to give a visible shudder. His muzzle gave way to a slightly upturned nose and a sharp jaw with a cleft chin. The fur on his head barely darkened at all, a pale platinum blond that only had the fainted hint of yellow to it. His chest and legs were a bit on the fuzzy side, still a pale blond, and he only looked to be in his late thirties despite being older than Michael, with not a hint of age-induced softness over those sculpted muscles. The doctor held his hands out to his side as if to say, &#39;Well, here it is.&#39; &quot;What do you think.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael set the book in his lap aside, revealing the few inches of hardened wolf cock that stuck out of his sheath. &quot;I think I&#39;ll look like a troll in comparison.&quot; He leaned forward and took Otso&#39;s hand, pulling him forward and onto the bed. Those golden eyes of his had only lost a touch of their sheen. A pale brown with flecks of gold seeming to float in the iris. He had never had this instant a reaction to another human guy before, maybe because he was only now accepting this part of himself, or maybe because he knew it was his wolf in there.<br />
<br />
With Otso on top of him, he kissed him. Michael&#39;s muzzle had begun to come in, meaning it was his turn to finish their kiss with a lick across Otso&#39;s lips, which made the other man smile. &quot;I hadn&#39;t realized fur against bare skin felt so.. erotic. No wonder you kept trying to burrow into my chest at first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me show you something else that felt amazing.&quot; Michael rolled them over so Otso was on his back and slowly slid down he man until his muzzle was hovering over the doctor&#39;s now human cock. He took it into his mouth, careful of his sharpened teeth, but teasing with the new tongue. He had to resist smiling as Otso squirmed under him a little, gasping as his tongue teased the underside of his shaft. Michale lowered his nose into the hair at the base of the cock, taking in his lover&#39;s scent. Still the same flavor, but a slightly different seasoning in this form. He had a hard time defining the new smells flooding his brain as his nose changed, and taste seemed the best analogue to him.<br />
<br />
Otso gasped, an salty warmth flooded Michael&#39;s throat. The first time he thought he wouldn&#39;t enjoy it, but he founding himself swallowing every drip and licking Otso clean. His tongue was making another lapping stroke as the lights went out, leaving htem in only the dim illumination from the fireplace, and the shape of what was under his tongue changed, narrowing at the tip and widening at the base. He looked back up at his wolf with a questioning gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t.&quot; The wolf said to the unspoken question. &quot;It just seemed to slip from me.&quot; He sounded a touch worried. &quot;I can&#39;t..&quot; The lights snapped back on and Otso&#39;s fur retreated back into human form once again with an audible sigh from the wolf turned once more human. &quot;It&#39;s getting worse.&quot; He said as Michael crawled back up the bed and flopped down next to him. &quot;How&#39;s that idea of yours coming?&quot;<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
Eric and Clyde were exhausted from practice, too exhausted to do more than cuddle on the couch as they listened to music. Clyde sat up, stroking Eric&#39;s chest fur as his soon to be mate laid in his lap. The broken antler made that much easier and more comfortable. Not that he would dare tell Eric that. It was one reason he looked forward to molting season. No antlers and shorter antlers would let them experiment in some ways they couldn&#39;t with full racks.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that... feeling?&quot; Eric sat up sharply as the lights in the street and the one they had on next to them all winked out. Clyde could feel it, too. Like something was pulling the magic out of him for a moment. The darkness allowed for the purples and greens of the aurora to shine brighter for a while. A faint ribbon of rainbow light snaking across the sky from the south. He could feel magic coming off that ribbon, familiar, but so very different. Like a favorite song played in a new tempo.<br />
<br />
The ribbon hit the aurora and color exploded through the northern lights. Going from their simple coloring to a kaleidoscope of colors in a flash, a bare moment later, the lights in the village came back on. &quot;It&#39;s him.&quot; Clyde said with a touch of awe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Santa?&quot; Eric asked, curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, the guardian of the Outback sanctuary. His magic is all in the power of dreams, very close to Santa&#39;s. He must be lending us some of his magic.&quot; Clyde actually looked a little teary eyed as the rainbow colored ribbon split off from the newly charged aurora and snaked towards the workshop. The northern lights returned to their usual curtains of green and purple, though occasionally another color would streak through, keeping them strong.</p>
