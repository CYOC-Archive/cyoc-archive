<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Molly awoke from her short nap, feeling the effects of the bean just washing away from her.<br />
<br />
Saturday had been their day to play because her 32 month old daughter Tess had been off with her sister Hanna for the weekend.  Till now, Molly had tried as hard as she could to avoid using her little girl’s room or any of her clothing on Jasper.  The only exception had been some of her old diapers, plastic pants and training pants.  She had figured Jasper couldn’t handle anything more.<br />
<br />
This being day 2, Molly was no longer in play mode.  Leaning forward, she observed her little baby husband.  The odor of his soiled diaper had filled the room, yet there he was soundly finishing his morning nap.  By Molly’s calculations, he would stay a little guy till some time around mid day.<br />
<br />
Her sister would be coming by later this morning, so some of their logistics might be tight.<br />
<br />
Molly gathered all the little guy husband stuff around the room and put it in a laundry basket. Cleaned up the rest of the area nearby and then sat and tried to figure out what to do next.<br />
<br />
She worried about how long Jasper was sleeping.  It would just add to how long he stayed this way.<br />
<br />
She took the initiative and carefully woke her sleepy little man.  Carrying him up to her daughter’s bedroom, she placed him on the padded floor and sat him down.<br />
<br />
Jasper felt the squelch of the mess in his diaper as it spread across his bottom.  He whined a little as he realized his sorry state.<br />
<br />
“Baby, mommy needs a shower.  Can she change you first?”<br />
<br />
Jaspers whined and reached up wanting to be picked up.<br />
<br />
“No baby.  We need ….” Molly stopped herself realizing she was not talking to her adult husband, but and infantilized version of him.  So, she reached down picked him up and held him close.  Rocking him in their little baby girl’s room.  A room, that save for the fact it was for a little girl, was so close to being age appropriate for the husband now in her arms and how he was behaving. <br />
 <br />
“Mama”<br />
<br />
“Yes baby, mama’s here”<br />
“Mama, …..mama” Jasper kept repeating in a soft mew of a voice like a little mantra to comfort himself.<br />
<br />
“Mama has you baby”<br />
<br />
Jasper was awake, but after a few minutes had finally settled himself down.<br />
<br />
As the mother of an actual baby, Molly sensed it was time she could move this along.  “Jasper, how about we get that stinky diapy off your bottom?” <br />
<br />
“Ooootaaay”<br />
<br />
This time, Molly didn’t hold back, she cleared off Tess’s changing table and strapped Jasper to it.  Pulled out a set of plastic keys for him to play with and began changing his very messy bottom.<br />
<br />
“Jasper, could you be a sport and play along for the little time we have left?”<br />
<br />
“Wha you meam?”<br />
<br />
“We have some of Tess’s disposable nighttime diapers here and I want to get some laundry done.  It would really help.”<br />
<br />
“Wha” <br />
<br />
“Jasper you know what I am asking”<br />
<br />
Jasper was not really sure what was going on, did she? was she? “princess diapers?”<br />
<br />
“Yes baby princess diapers, so mommy doesn’t have to do more laundry”<br />
<br />
Jasper didn’t know how to answer, so he just lay there.<br />
<br />
Molly couldn’t wait forever. “How about this, mommy will diaper you and if you don’t like it, after mommy’s does the laundry, she will change you into something else?”  <br />
<br />
With that Molly just finished putting Jasper into the princess diaper.<br />
<br />
“Now mommy is going to put you down here so you can play while mommy starts the laundry.”<br />
<br />
Naked except for the cute little pink princess diaper, Jasper sat in the middle of the room and tried to think of what to do.<br />
<br />
Molly left the door open as she was just a few steps from it as she sorted and tended to a the load of soiled baby items and cloths Jasper had been wearing.<br />
<br />
Jasper got a good look as Tess’s room.  His step daughter.  She was the cutest little thing and now he could see it almost like she did.  The crib that she recently left for her canopied toddler princess bed, the changing table that he recently had the pleasure of now being the passenger (having previously only been a driver).  At his present size he could now look at the massive room at her size rather than his usual adult size.<br />
<br />
Jasper crawled over to her toy box.  He smiled, realizing that he could have walked, but crawling felt right.  His little bottom wiggled from side to side as the thick nighttime diaper forced his legs apart so that even his crawl gave him an odd gate.  The weirdness of being a baby now seemed to give way to his embracing not just being a 4 year old but wanting to act like he was too young to even walk.  To actually be so young he would depend on mommy.  That mommy would be his whole world.<br />
<br />
That was when something inside, like a wellspring of panic just took over, and Jasper started to cry.  He needed mommy.  <br />
<br />
“Mama…..Mama….waaaa……waaaa….maaamaaa…waaaaaa…..maaaammaaa”<br />
<br />
Molly was just a few steps away and was there in an instant.  There he was sitting right in front of the toy box a terrified little Jasper crying for her.<br />
<br />
Molly couldn’t imagine what was going on.  She rushed over and inspected to see if there was something wrong.  There was nothing she could find.<br />
<br />
It took a moment for the hysterical boy to see his mommy.  When he did he reach out.<br />
<br />
Molly picked him up, he clung desperately to her and began to settled down.<br />
<br />
Molly had seen this before.  She just couldn’t believe it.  Jasper her adult husband was losing control.  No longer that 4 year old play self, he is …, it was hard for her to even think it, but he is regressing, losing himself to a more infantile self image of …<br />
<br />
With her little guy hanging on her she finished loading the washer.  Her baby hanging on her, but Molly spied her baby sucking on his other hand.  “is my little guy hungry?” She rhetorically asked, as she made her way to the kitchen.</p>
