<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey!  Let's try that out!&quot;  Josh made a reach for the mouse as Chris tried to keep it away from his younger brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Back off, I get to try it first!&quot;  Chris held the computer mouse above his head, in a poor attempt to keep it away from his younger brother who was only a couple inches shorter than him.  Josh jumped to try to grab it out of his brother's hand and they both went tumbling to the floor.  They rolled around for a few seconds, the mouse changing hands a couple of times before Chris finally leaped up, holding the mouse triumphantly.  &quot;Ha!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh.. Chris?&quot;  Josh was pointing at the screen.  At first Chris thought he was trying to distract him, but seeing the nervous look on his brother's face, he finally looked at the computer.  The interface was gone, instead the cursor had turned to a rotating hourglass and the screen read 'Processing' with a timer counting down.  Chris couldn't even see their stats anymore to know what got changed.  Chris quickly sat down at the computer, trying to find any way to cancel the program.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit.. shit.. shit..&quot;  There was no way to stop it that Chris could find.  Not even Ctrl+Alt+Del was working, only causing the computer to ping in annoyance when he tried, popping up a small warning screen. 'Warning: Turning off the computer may result in unexpected and uncrontrolled changes.'  &quot;There went goes plan..&quot;  Chris said a few more choice words.  He turned to look at Josh, intending to blame him for what was going to happen, when the words died in his throat.<br />
<br />
Josh was looking a little older.  Not taller, but some of the baby fat had melted from his face, a faint shadow on his upper lip where his facial hair had started darkening.  Josh was giving Chris the same puzzled and stupified look he was sure he was giving his brother.  He quickly ran to the bathroom, looking into the mirror.  Where Josh had suddenly looked a year older, Chris seemed to be moving in the other direction.  His face was rounder, having lost some of the changes puberty had given him over the last year.  Josh slid into the bathroom next to him, his face popping into the mirror next to his.<br />
<br />
The first thing he noticed was he was no longer taller than his brother.  It was never a big difference, but it was one of the few he had.  Now they stood completely even with each other.  Chris' hair was getting shorter, as Josh's got longer, both stopping with the same shaggy ear length hair cut.  Even their eyes seemed to be meeting somewhere in between.  Chris' eyes darkened, while Josh's got a little lighter, both becoming a dark hazel.  They year gap between them continued to shrink, Josh looking older by the second, as the years slowly melted off of Chris.<br />
<br />
Finally the changes ground to a halt.  Chris looked at his brother in shock.  They weren't younger brother and older any more.  They were definitely twins.  There were even subtle changes in their features.  As brothers there had been a similarity in their looks to begin with, but now nothing was different.  Everything had been averaged out between them.  Chris couldn't help but think it was a little spooky.  Both opened their mouths to speak at the same time.  Even their voices sounded like echoes of each other.<br />
<br />
They kept trying to talk over each other until finally Chris won out.  &quot;Move.  I'm going to check the computer.&quot;  He shoved his twin out of the way, rushing over to the screen.  The loading screen was gone, their stats back up on the screen.<br />

<br />
Chris shook his head.  Everything had been averaged out between them.  They were twins in more than just body.  Personality, skills, everything looked to have been somewhere in between.  Then Chris' eyes shot to sexual preference.  &quot;How are we both gay now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh shrugged, echoing in his identical voice.  &quot;I guess that's what happens when you average bisexual and gay.&quot;  Josh grabbed something off the wall.  &quot;Look at this.&quot;  Josh turned the photo around to show his brother.  Chris remembered the photo.  It was a picture of both of them at the beach last summer.  But instead of their old selves, it was a picture of slightly younger versions of how they looked now.  A pair of twins.<br />
<br />
Chris made a noise that sounded like he was being strangled, and turned back to the computer.  &quot;We gotta fix this.&quot;  Chris started clicking around in the menus.  But everytime he tried to change something on one of them back, it changed on the other as well.  Then he saw it.  Right beneath both of their profiles.<br />
<br />
*Profiles Linked*<br />
<br />
&quot;Crap.&quot;  Chris pounded the desk with his fist.  He tried clicking on it, diving through more menus.  He couldn't find any way to undo it.  Only the option they must have accidently hit before that read 'Link Profiles'.  No way to do it. Clicking it again only gave him an error message saying 'Profiles already linked.'  &quot;Crap.  There has to be some way to undo this..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;  Josh came over to the computer, blocking the screen so his brother couldn't do anything.  &quot;Hey!  This is good!  I get to be older, and you..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get to repeat all of high school I already got through.&quot;  Chris interrupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Already knowing everything you had to learn before.&quot;  Josh shot back.  Chris' eyebrows went up.  It was true.  Certain things had changed, his Spanish was a little fuzzier, but most of his memories were still intact.  &quot;Or..&quot;  Josh got this mischievous smile.  One he never had before, but one Chris used to have whenever he got a potentially bad idea.  That fact worried Chris.  &quot;Or we could mess around some more.  If you don't want to be thirteen, you can always go back to sixteen.  Or, hell, even eighteen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or send you back to ten.&quot;  Chris leaned back in the chair, crossing his arms over his chest.<br />
<br />
Josh just shook his head, &quot;Not without doing it to yourself, too.&quot;  Josh pointed at the Profiles Linked line on the screen.  &quot;We might as well make the best of it, right?&quot;  Chris was surprised at how those three fake years added to his brother actually seemed to make him act older.  He worried he wasn't thinking straight though, his thoughts following a way he would have three years ago.  But.. maybe his brother was right.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, but first...&quot;  Chris dug up an option he had found while sifting through the menus.  He clicked it and a screen popped up, reading. 'Base Form Established, click Load Base Form at anytime to return.'  &quot;There.. now we can undo any more mistakes we might make.&quot;</p>
