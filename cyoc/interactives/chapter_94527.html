<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;All students please report to the auditorium immediately. &quot; The loudspeaker blasted that as the it then began playing circus music. Tiffany, Nicky, and Olivia all went inside the school. As well as everyone else. Some cartwheeled in, mainly girls, others pedaled in on little unicycles, most of them even from time to time tripped and then somersaulted back onto their feet. Still all acting like clowns Olivia thought as she walked with her sisters and classmates. Soon all of the kids found their way to the auditorium, to their satisfaction the chairs were now cushioned, and the were no in a rainbow pattern. The school was now also much more colorful and all of the photos were now pictures of clowns. The triplets all sat together. “I wonder what this is about, we&#39;ve never had an assembly first thing in the morning before?” Nicky said that to Olivia. “It doesnt look like many others were questioning it.” she said as she motioned to Tiffany who was acting like a clown, she was continuosly honking her nose, smiling and making faces at her classmates causing many of them to fall over laughing. Soon their Principal, Mrs. Skinners, walked to the stage, before she had been a woman in her 40’s with auburn hair and a fit body, now she was a clown with bright yellow hair in a beehive style, she was wearing a &quot;mary had a little lamb&quot; clown dress that was purple and yellow, along with clown heels and socks that went with it. As she walked up to the stage she turned on the microphone which was now a large boxing announcer style. “Good morning everyone.” Mrs. Skinners said with a honk of her large red nose, and an entire chorus of it was sent back, Olivia didn’t know why she did it but it felt like a habit to her. “This morning has obviously had some, interesting new developments as we all can see. But I must say, I LOVE IT. It feels good to be silly. But the reason why I called this assembly was not to talk about this, transformation. But for this package that was delivered.&quot; Mrs. Skinners motioned for it to be brought in. The janitor who was now one of those clowns who had those painted on beards. &quot;A Hobo clown, I think it&#39;s called.&quot; Olivia thought to herself. The package was about the size of the janitor and it was opened. The teachers began to pass out a small box to every student and to themselves. &quot;This video was included in it.&quot; And he screen began to play a video. Soon, three clowns appeared on the screen, one was a woman, she had white skin, blue hair in large cascading braids, and  a large red smile and nose. She was wearing an Orange and red clown apron dress, blue bloomers. Orange socks, and red clown shoes. Another was a woman. She was one who had pink skin and white around her eyes and mouth. She had a rainbow Afro, and a red nose. She was wearing a red clown jumpsuit with rainbow dots and red and yellow clown shoes. She also had a floppy dunce cap that matched the jumpsuit. The last one was a man. He was a Hobo clown. With a patch work brown suit and bowler hat. And black clown shoes. They were all smiling and waiting. And then a man who was normal walked in the view. He was dressed in a ringmasters suit.&quot;Hello the world. You might notice your new, look I suppose. I hope you you like it because I gave it to you. I have noticed that the world was a little unhappy, a little to serious and a little unappreciative of clowns. Those boxes in your hand will allow you to do a number of things to yourselves. And I&#39;m going to join in the fun.&quot; As he said that he took a vial from his pocket and drowned it. Almost immediately his skin was white. His hair went green and went bald in the center but curly on the sides. He grew a wide grin that turned red and black lines spears on his forehead. For eyebrows. Rainbow colors of triangles formed under his eyes. His clothes stayed the same, but his shoes shot out to fit his new feet. Lastly he poked himself in the nose and it popped out into a bright red clowns nose a little smaller than a tennis ball. &quot;Well you were right my dear, I do feel so happy and free.&quot; He said that as he pulled the other clown with white skin and kissed her passionately. At that the screen went dark. Everyone then immediately opened their boxes and inside there were many vials, they said they could make you fatter, more hair, tiny, dumb, make your love be into you, make you short, make your but or breasts grow, your choice of size and many others. &quot;Since there is obvioly this new treat we have, all classes today will be canceled and will be replaced with one lesson.&quot;Have the wildest time of you life with everyone and yourselves.&quot; Olivia had an idea of what to do and it was........</p>
