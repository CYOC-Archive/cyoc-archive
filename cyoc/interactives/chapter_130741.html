<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Actually, it's just been a really rough <i>week</i>...</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Grrlglr...&quot; You gurgle out as your consciousness slowly returns, a terrible migraine welcoming you back to the land of the living. Everything is black. For a brief moment you think you&#39;ve gone blind, but a small flicker of light in the corner of your vision makes you come to the conclusion that you are just in a <i>really</i> dark room. The smell of burnt chemicals and rubber fill your nostrils, you must be in what remains of the labs... but where?<br />
<br />
With your senses beginning to return, you realize something is not quite right. You try to shift yourself out of the uncomfortable position you&#39;re in, but all you end up doing is tugging at the restraints that currently hold you in place. You cuss out loud, &quot;Shlihth...&quot; <i>Uh, oh,</i> you try to open and close your mouth but to no avail, <i>Shit, my mouth is clamped shut and my body...</i> You struggle against your bonds, swaying side to side. It would seem you are at least a little in the air, your arms are strapped across your chest in some kind of harness that has you suspended above the ground.<br />
<br />
Your wings feel as though they are being weighed down by something and they are nearly impossible to move themselves, while your feet seem to be cuffed at the ankles and secured to the floor via a length of chain. Concentrating on your tail, you can feel that it&#39;s also restrained... however, it&#39;s secured in a way that leaves your lower quarters exposed to the elements. A draft that winds its way through the room makes it painfully clear that, while you were unconscious, you&#39;d been stripped of all you clothes.<br />
<br />
Your heart starts to race as you think about what must have happened to the others. <i>I hope they&#39;re alright, but where could they be keeping them?</i> You wonder, <i>And what are they doing to them?</i> Judging by your current circumstance, you can assume nothing good. You&#39;ve gotta get out of here.<br />
<br />
You try struggling against your restraints again, but it&#39;s no good. You&#39;re strung up like a hog ready for the barbeque. In the distance, you hear someone... some-<i>thing</i>... approaching your room. You can&#39;t quite make out what it is you&#39;re hearing, but the footfalls - if that <i>is</i> what you hear - are anything but human.<br />
<br />
Finally, they stop at what, you assume, must be the entrance to your room, a door behind you slides open and fills the room with light from the hallway beyond. You get a glimpse of your small, barren, white-tiled room, there&#39;s some sort of screen just in front of you. A large shadow moves into the door frame, casting darkness over everything once more. You don&#39;t move.<br />
<br />
The figure moves into your chamber, a sound like knives scraping and clacking against the tile dig into your ears while you continue to pretend being unconscious. You hear the creature flick a switch and wince as bright, florescent light illuminates your world.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, good, you&#39;re awake...&quot; The voice is not loud and, as a matter of fact, it would seem downright friendly if it wasn&#39;t for the way the voice seems to fill the room and command your full attention. You crack your eyes open, the first thing you notice is your snout strapped shut in some heavy, leather muzzle. Next is how painfully bright the room is, featureless white walls surround you except for what you thought was a screen, but, in actuality, looks more like a blacked-out window. This really does look like an interrogation room, just without chairs and a desk... And you doubt there will be a good-cop-bad-cop routine.<br />
<br />
You let out an involuntary shiver as the creature behind you grazes your uplifted tail with sharp, pointed talons. They move up and down your sinuous length in an almost caressing motion, another shiver runs up your spine as it begins to speak again, &quot;Mm, you are quite the find, I&#39;d say...&quot; The powerful voice sounds as though it could belong to a collector musing over a particularly interesting item, &quot;Strong with dominant tendencies, but... lacking. There is too much of what you used to be still in there, trying to control a power it knows nothing about.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ghrrrh...&quot; You growl through your muzzle as this creature&#39;s taloned claws grip painfully at the base of your tail. You feel incredibly exposed as your captor continues to appraise you from behind. Something sharp trails its way down to your exposed anus, you thrash in your restraints to escape the touch, but it&#39;s no use, you aren&#39;t going anywhere.<br />
<br />
A chuckle resounds around you as the claw retreats from your exposed opening. &quot;There is something <i>incredibly</i> satisfying about one that fights back. I can already tell... <i>I&#39;m going to enjoy breaking you.</i>&quot; The creature walks in front of you and your eyes go wide as you aren&#39;t sure you can believe what you see.<br />
<br />
The first thing you notice is its monstrous head, like an imperial eagle, but with a crest of gold feathers running from its brow to the nape of its neck. Large eyes with reddish-gold irises stare at you, unblinking, taking in every detail of your naked, draconic body. Knife-shaped, brown and black feathers decorate the monster&#39;s entire upper body, ending at the elbows of its arms where appendages, that look like the claws of a bird of prey, make up its forearms and taloned hands. These talons reach up to stroke your snout through the muzzle and you have a strong urge to snap at them.<br />
<br />
Your eyes trace further down its body where, oddly, the feathers taper and fade into a golden pelt of silken fur. Contrary to what you thought you were going to see, strong, furred legs ending in leonine-like, digitigrade paws grace the lower half of this creature, complete with a tasseled tail. The wings on its back splay out proudly as none other than a gryphon stands before you. It would seem he has appreciated your staring, if the thick cat-cock poking out of its sheath is anything to go by.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry...&quot; The gryphon hooks a clawed hand under your chin to bring your eyes back up to his, &quot;There&#39;ll be plenty of time for <i>that</i> later, right now I&#39;ve got something important to show you...&quot;  He turns to the windowed wall in front of you and presses a button. Slowly, a light illuminates the room beyond the glass, you gasp when you see Anders strung up in the middle, much the same as you.<br />
<br />
&quot;HNNDRRS!&quot; You attempt to get the wolf&#39;s attention, but your muzzle barely allows you to make more than a loud humming sound. The wolf appears to be struggling against his bonds when two figures step into the room. One of them is kitted out similarly to the guards you first saw and the other is a large bull-like creature who is wearing nothing. Your heart begins to race as you begin to struggle again, <i>What are they gonna do with Anders?</i> You try to figure out how you&#39;re going to help your lupine companion, <i>If I can just loosen these straps I might...</i> A strong grip on the back of your neck stops your struggle, the pressure increases to a painful level as the gryphon quietly discourages you from struggling any further. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait... and <i>watch.</i>&quot; He commands, the voice filling your head. You can&#39;t seem to focus on anything else anymore, your eyes are drawn to the room opposite you. A small whimper makes it past your muzzle as you realize you can&#39;t ignore the gryphon&#39;s words. &quot;That&#39;s right, you belong to me now. Everything you were, everything you have become, it&#39;s mine. All mine. Soon, even your mind will accept its new master.&quot; The gryphon has moved behind you again, stroking your tail and your ears with his dexterous talons.<br />
<br />
He presses his body into yours, the warm, soft feathers and downy fur blanket your scales as he moves his claws in front of you to caress your muscles and scaled skin. You feel warm, safe... protected... You shake your head as unbidden thoughts enter your mind. You don&#39;t want this, your body tenses as the monster rakes his claws down your scales. &quot;You will submit to me eventually...&quot; The patient creature coos in your ear as he presses into you harder.<br />
<br />
You feel the hot, wet point of his barbed spear, poking your rear entrance. He grinds his rough shaft in between your two bodies and dips a hand between your thighs. An involuntary groan pushes past your lips as a claw slips into your genital slit to massage the sensitive flesh within. &quot;Show me you want it... Make yourself ready for me...&quot; You&#39;re starting to feel scared now, the control he has over you is terrifying. You want nothing more to do with these creatures and their experiments, and yet, you can feel your own cock starting to betray you. Your thick, ridged, draconic length swelling and pushing out of its protective slit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy... I cannot wait to continue this later, but first, a taste of what is to come...&quot; You are still staring forward at the scene in front of you. It seems that the figures beside Anders were waiting for a signal because as soon as the gryphon leaves your side, he waves a hand at the two on the other side of the glass and they begin to prepare something.<br />
<br />
The human figure pulls out a large needle filled with some sort of clear liquid. Anders&#39; eyes trace the object with fright, he glances through the glass at you, the look of a cornered animal on his face. Unable to take your eyes off him, you start to tear up when you realize there is nothing you can do. You let them down... no, worse, you betrayed them and led them into a trap that you should have seen coming. They trusted you and now you are watching Anders being turned into some twisted experiment. You can&#39;t imagine what must be happening to Amelia.<br />
<br />
You wince as you watch the needle disappear into Anders&#39; arm, the plunger forcing some vile concoction into your friend&#39;s body. Anders raises his head and convulses in his restraints, slobber dripping from his muzzle. You can&#39;t hear anything through the soundproof walls, but the sensation of your heart being torn apart is no less painful for it. As a matter of fact, it seems to make everything worse somehow.<br />
<br />
The bull-man re-emerges from one corner of the room, a full erection pointed squarely at your wolf-mate. You shake your head, <i>Don&#39;t, please no... don&#39;t do this... please...</i> Your thoughts seem to come from a distant place, your strength seems to leave you as defeat now holds you in its cold, iron grip.<br />
<br />
The bull does little to prepare your friend as he lines up with the wolf&#39;s backdoor. He plunges in hard on the first thrust and you can see the wolf struggle to cry out, you let out your own protest as you feel your heart shatter. &quot;MNMRRRRL...GRRRLGGRRR!&quot; You thrash and shake and twist, but nothing comes loose. You slump against your bonds and hang there, defeated.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>WATCH...</i>&quot; The command breaks through your pain-fogged mind. As if of its own accord, your head rises up and you continue to watch...</p>
