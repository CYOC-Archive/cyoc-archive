<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">*THUD*<br />
The man smiles as he watches the fury collapse onto the ground; he chose the Rabbit fury collecting some bags from the back seat of her car. He deduced that the fury was female after observing her bend over and seeing a pink gash in the middle of a white furry mound. He glances to see a second fury fall; this one was a giraffe furry jogging towards the supermarket with a Rottweiler running beside him.<br />
“I guess these furies keep pets as well,” the man stowing his gear and getting up as he thinks to himself. Noticing his partner getting up, they exchange a silent nod as the quickly dash into the woods towards another possible target.<br />
<br />
*********<br />
<br />
“Dispatch to deputy Whitefur. Dispatch to deputy Whitefur. Please report your location.<br />
Luis Whitefur  groaned as he was lying down on the massage table. He was at Lillian Cottontail-Lovetooth’s spa enjoying a morning massage from his favorite masseuse and mate Trudy; an anthro squirrel fury. He had the day off from duty, while she had a shift at the spa, so he decided to join her for some R&R. Rutting and relaxing. However his radio, which he had to keep on him for emergencies decided to cock block his morning pleasure.<br />
“This is deputy Whitefur,” the anthro spotted leopard answering; “what is the situation?”<br />
“We have an active shooter or shooters at the supermarket,” the voice on the radio responding; the word shooter brought the deputy out of his haze and he sat straight up on the table; “all available units to respond forthwith.”<br />
“Roger,” Luis shaking his head as the radio goes dead; he looks at Trudy who had just grabbed the bottle of his favorite scented coconut oil; with genuine coconut scent.<br />
“Sorry love,” Luis giving his mate a quick kiss; “duty calls.”<br />
“Will you be gone long,” Trudy putting the bottle down and grabbing a cloth to wipe down the table .<br />
“I hope not,” Luis checking to make sure he is dry; “but just to be safe, lock the place down.”<br />
<br />
**********************<br />
<br />
The Komodo Dragon fury stared as a white cloth was placed over the bunny furry, followed by the giraffe fury. Securing the second fury was getting difficult as the Rottweiler was not letting anyone near his master.<br />
“Poor dog,” the police sergeant’s runes glowing as he will’s the distraught animal to sleep; “see if the mutt has a tag on his collar. It should help us find out where our second victim lives,” the Komodo Fury instructing the various deputies that have shown up. “Deputy Whitefur,” the Komodo seeing the spotted leopard step out of his crown vic cruiser; “sorry for calling you on your day off but we need all paws on deck for this.”<br />
“Human’s,” the deputy looking at the carnage; “any witnesses? Location of the shots taken?”<br />
“That’s for you to find out,” the Komodo grunting; “call up those four kids you got deputized last year, we are going to need all the help we can get.”<br />
“Those teenagers may be good for crowd control,” Luis knowing who his sergeant was referring to; “but to process a crime scene or make an arrest?”<br />
“I don’t care,” the sergeant snarling; “all paws on deck. That’s an order!”<br />
<br />
************<br />
<br />
The four at Henry Knotlock’s place ate in silence; no one daring to speak up as it is clear Henry aka Scabs is still not over the death of his mother. A death he indirectly caused when he tried to pass on the gift he received to her in a noble attempt to cure her of her morbid obesity. Sadly all that happened was her death; the woman’s heart giving out as her body could not handle the change. Sitting next to Henry was a fourteen year old female green feathered parakeet fury named Elly. Next to her was her sixteen year old older sister Penny. Penny was a mute swan fury with orange webbed feet. Penny’s mate was the male Cardinal fury sitting next to her; Rudolph Rot-Feder. Rudolph was called Pus by Henry, while everyone else was calling him by his proper name.<br />
<br />
“So what are your plans today sis,” Elly daring to break the silence; “are you going to the rec centre?”<br />
“No,” Penny shaking her head; “I got a mountain of homework to complete. Dad’s home schooling put us behind, so I suggest you dig into your pile as well. Rudy will you help,” Penny looking at the cardinal fury as he finishes his breakfast and starts collecting plates.<br />
“I like scabs have that community service job to finish off,” Rudolph answering;  “our punishment for all the times we got caught skipping school.”<br />
“Lankey and Slag better show up,” Henry collecting his and Elly’s plate; “I don’t care if they are balls deep into each other’s rectums, they need to finish their hours or they can forget summer break.” Neither knew that the two in question were killed roughly an hour ago by human’s with rifles equipped with silencers.<br />
“You think we could make tomorrow a day at the rec centre,” Elly asking; “I could use a relaxing swim in the pool.<br />
“I suppose,” Henry sighing; “anything to stay out of this house.”<br />
<br />
*Knock Knock Knock*<br />
“Who is here at this hour,” Rudolph looking towards the front door.<br />
“Could be Lankey and Slag,” Penny heading to the door to open it up. To her surprise it was a large anthro spotted leopard fury.<br />
“I need to speak to Henry and Rudolph,” the deputy stepping inside; looking around to see not much has changed since he was here last. Seeing the sofa were Henry’s mother sat dead; her oxygen machine next to her spot looking disused and covered in a layer of dust.<br />
“Coming to escort us to the side of the road for a day of picking up litter,” Henry seeing the deputy and looking his usual surly self.<br />
“Not today,” the deputy looking serious as he stares at bother the doberman and cardinal furies; “we have active shooters in town and as you two are needed by order of the sergeant to help capture and apprehend. Get in the patrol car.”<br />
“We can help,” Penny at the kitchen threshold along with her sister.<br />
To dangerous,” the deputy shaking his head; “you two stay her and keep the blinds down.”<br />
“Rudy get the bow,” Penny watching her mate leave; “and remember what I taught you.”<br />
“Right,” Rudolph nodding as he heads to the bedroom to collect a compound bow and a quiver full of arrows made from a tough composite. The deputy looks surprised to see the cardinal teen carrying the weapon, but wasn’t going to object. “Yes,” Rudolph looking at the deputy; “I know how to use it. Penny has been teaching me.”<br />
“Fine,” the deputy nodding; “get in the cruiser and see if you can get ahold of your friends. I’ve been trying to call them since I left the crime scene and I haven’t gotten a hold of them.”<br />
<br />
*********************<br />
<br />
The second spot overlooked a playground. The two humans were already set up and scoping out location and seeing only animal like children playing about. This worked out fine for the two as they considered any fury, regardless of age as viable targets.<br />
“We take two out here and we’ll have to go to ground for the day,” the first man speaking; “any ideals?”<br />
“A home invasion,” the second man noting of the several houses they passed by as they walked in through the wood. He found it odd that the town was laid out in a wheel and spoke pattern. While this allowed for them to blend and hide in the dense brush in town; it made for getting lost easily. Fortunately he like the first man had a GPS device mounted on his arm to allow both hands to be used in aiming and shooting his rifle.<br />
“A home invasion is risky,” the first man looking through his scope at the group of young furries gambling about on the playground equipment. “Some of these beasts may be from those nearby homes,” the first man cursing; “too risky.”<br />
“We need a place to hide,” the second man focusing on a beaver fury swinging about on the monkey bars; “a home seems the safest bet. Plus we have our side arms,” the second man taking his shot and killing his target; “we shoot those inside and close up the blinds.<br />
<br />
“It’s still risky,” the first man shooting and dropping a fury that looks like a anthropomorphic rhino; “but its not like we have any other options. We need to go,” the first man picking up his rifle and hurrying into the thicket; following the second man as they make a mad dash to the back door of a house. Watching as he picks the lock and quietly lets himself in. Both put their rifles down as the pull out some Berettas with silencers and begin clearing each room on the ground floor before heading up stairs.<br />
<br />
THUD THUD<br />
Dropping the first fury still sleeping; a young female otter they enter the second bedroom to see a crib with a baby sleeping.<br />
THUD<br />
The Master bedroom had two more furies sleeping. Each taking aim as they place three slugs into each. One in the head and two in the chest.<br />
“I’ll check the basement,” the first man speaking; “you secure the doors.”<br />
Breakfast and a shower afterwards,” the second man nodding as checks each room once again to make sure all furies are dead.<br />
<br />
*******************<br />
<br />
Back at the supermarket parking lot Louis Whitefur was looking displeased as both Henry and Rudolph could neither get ahold of Lankey and Slag. Both of their phones going straight to voicemail as they examine the area in which they suspect the shooters were at. The depressions in the brush showed two shooters. Luis sniffed the area and looked confused as all he could smell was deer.<br />
“They may be trying to mask their scent,” Rudolph examine something glinting next to a tree; “looks like one forgot to collect their brass.”<br />
Luis turned to see the spent cartridge of a .280 Remington picking it up he comments before putting it in an evidence bag, “good eye. You’d make a half decent detective.”<br />
“It looks like there are two paths,” Rudolph reading the ground; “from the looks of things, they came from that direction.” Rudolph looking at the thick forest .<br />
“You two head that way,” the Komodo dragon fury motioning to two deputies; “report what you find. “And the other direction,” the sergeant looking at the cardinal fury.<br />
“Towards a playground,” Rudolph checking his compound bow before heading along the path.<br />
<br />
“Sergeant,” a jack russel fury running up the bank; “we have another a shooting.”<br />
“Where,” the Komodo dragon growling.<br />
“At a near by playground,” the dog fury shaking his head; “at least two cubs dead.”<br />
“Fuck,” Luis Whitefur swearing as he watched Rudolph starting to head in the bush and following the path; “Sergeant were following the path, you get there with vehicles.</p>
