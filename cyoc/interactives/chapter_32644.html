<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Donkey fumes can be a rash catalyst when one is needed to arouse in those who came to the Island as human; but with enjoying such as Red Ass Ale, they become then doomed.<br />
<br />
&quot;This I believe is what happened to the shore party of men that went to search and seek about an island worthy for some needed R&amp;R.<br />
<br />
Those men all dressed as they were in navy uniforms stuck out like a thumb hit with a hammer. They were easy marks for those at the saloon, as normally they serve the brew to much young men; mature and grown men act differently to the tainted brew.&quot; Jedidiah Flycatcher said, as he and I (a wrangler) sat in wood rocking chairs, on his back porch, and conversing about the day's catch.<br />
<br />
Jed owns and manages the biggest stable on Pleasure Island, he breaks rampant young male donkeys, trains them in the refined ways people will expect a donkey to act, shipping them off to varied ports of entry. The thousands he has profited by found their donkey selves delivered to places as far from here, as South America, Mexico, Australia, the far east, China, and along the shores that surround Africa. Few of those donkeys ever are returned to their place of origin, assuring it likely that without being able to understand a  different language, they would act as if dumb animals.<br />
<br />
I see nothing wrong in what we do here, its just a different sort of enterprise, taking bold and brash people and granting them an education in humility. Some who are fat ones get to know the insides of P.I. farms, those who become by their gluttony to be hogs.<br />
<br />
You being a new comer here should not worry about treachery and the likelihood of someday joining those we wrangle, stable, corral, and ship to far away ports. When you applied and signed up to come here, remember the inoculation shots the doctor gave you then; well your injections were the base levels of the same stuff they blend in that foaming Red Ass Ale.<br />
<br />
Therefore my friend, if when comes a time you wish to leave this business, you must sign and swear an oath of silence. The breaking of your oath would assure in some way those here would taint your food or clothing, and from such the secondary serum would make an ass out of you.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, we can make an excellent living here, residing down on the far end of the island, away from the lights, hustle, bustle, and brays we deal with when on duty.<br />
<br />
Yea, we have it good here, and my extra pay I do not have a need for goes into a 401K for an early retirement. Yea, retirement, after working here for twelve years you can retire on a good living and go where you wish to live, yea for real!<br />
<br />
That, oh those are that group of sailors, its what happens to men of maturity when the donkey serum begins to do the final stages of their transforming and change of species. You need to ignore it, that sounds rank, but in actuality, those in the throngs of change become gay like, taking their big donkey sausage and drilling their partners; some do it gang style and stand in a line humping other male donkeys.<br />
<br />
Give them a few more hours, once night comes and the day heat cools they become sated, tired, and with slumber and sleeping come the morning they are fully changed, being donkeys from that time and until their death.<br />
<br />
What's wrong, you facial expression suggests that you find this what I explained as if something distasteful to you; you best not show that expression to Jeb!<br />
<br />
Another friendly warning, you must be tough, maybe acting brutal toward those fool enough to drink away their humanity. Your here, you signed up to wrangle donkeys and that is what we shall do! Yet my new friend, beware, as showing compassion for those we are paid to wrangle and break their spirits away, if you act with concern for them, expect the wrath of Jeb to come crashing down over your head.<br />
<br />
What would he do, well like I said, Jeb would come crashing down over your head the yoke of some draft horse likely. Yup, saw one guy, he watched as one pretty stowaway girl sat crying as she transitioned . She the management thought would be of more worth as a dappled brown and Blondie mane and tail pony mare. <br />
<br />
He watched her change, then tried to confront her and showing compassion found himself aroused and soon hung over her rump acting like a stud pony. Jeb saw this all, let the guy finish his deed, and when the time was right, Jeb slipped the yoke of equine responsibility over the head of one soon to become a Percheron draft horse.<br />
<br />
Don't laugh too loud, its no joke, the pair of Percheron horses that haul the garbage wagon, both were employees that felt too close to those we use as money making products of Pleasure Island Research.<br />
<br />
Carl and Kenny, both about the same age as you, and at different times they came and soon became as you see them now.<br />
<br />
Oh I guess they are happy, or at the least content being as draft horses. I note they often stand about in their corral and sniff the sea breeze, it is the scents of those rampant females that sneak in here and get caught, once they change they go into the throngs of estrus and waft a scent that drives other donkeys and horses to flehmen, get aroused, and stand about masturbating away the lust they as animals have in abundance.        <br />
<br />
We keep all male animals as full fledged studs until delivered to their ultimate owner. It is up to the owner to decide if the animal they buy remains stud worthy. Most I am sure get snipped, lose their family jewels and become then as calm and or sullen animals; just what a farm owner needs to tote loads and pull at plows.<br />
<br />
Working the equine side of Pleasure Island is the easiest work here being as a wrangler. Its worse working with squealing hogs, oh but the horrid sounds made by degrading minds as they realize their change to be as swine, sows, boars, or gelts, they all whine and whimper.<br />
<br />
What say, we process donkeys mostly, some horses, mules, and an occasional Zebra that comes from the house of Circe. Yet too, are pigs, swine, boars and sows alike, as many a fellow drank the sow slurry brew and gained tits or teats, as well a passion for getting mounted, humped, and drilled by some corkscrew shaped rod of a boar.<br />
<br />
Oh, here comes Jeb, be on your mean side when he is around!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey boys, time to go back to work, the Hotel says they got a room having an orgy, likely some sleepy jackasses woke up to find their shafts lost that cute circumcised head.&quot; Jeb said, he feels no concern for the fools that come here, and he is right, when they awake it is an orgy to be sure!&quot;<br />
<br />
It is like a rolling sea in a storm that never ends, all are tossed in different ways, different directions, but all, save none of those males will see the sea, they leave here in the hold of a ship, and arrive by night at some port where none see the sea that brought them there, fools, just damned fools all!</p>
