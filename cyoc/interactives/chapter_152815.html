<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lyre&#39;s Catholic Church had been rather small before Animalia, even within the context of a small town in northwestern Nevada. It was out of the way and hadn&#39;t had many residents that were attracted to the denomination. Most of those that had came to the town came from one of various Protestant denominations. However the rise of Animalia had changed a fair number of those dynamics, for as Animalians learned about human concepts like religion, many were actually drawn to Catholicism because of the concept that the Catholic faith had a Patron Saint of Animals in Saint Francis of Assisi. And while there was some debate in Rome among the Church&#39;s leadership over whether or not Animalians had souls or not, Animalians had been found to be tolerated and that saw the Lyre Catholic Church gain parishioners that it wouldn&#39;t have had otherwise.<br />
<br />
Of course, some were converted Humans who came to Lyre and were already of the Catholic faith before they converted. Thus their coming to Lyre&#39;s church was more coincidence rather than from any outreach by the church. This applied heavily to Anne Cumbertin as she paced in one of the back areas of the church while waiting for the wedding march to play. Her time as a maid didn&#39;t affect her faith and joining Animalia had not changed her faith either. The big thing was that in becoming an Animalian was that she found a &quot;man&quot; that she loved and loved her, rather than someone who would abuse her or leave her, which had been the case regarding her daughter&#39;s birth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m very nervous,&quot; Anne declared again as she walked back and forth with her white gown sliding just above the floor. For the moment her black and white furred tail was relaxed, largely in order to prevent any sort of impropriety. &quot;Is he there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice moved forward carefully and peaked through a curtain that hung in front of the open doorway to the chapel. The pregnant Skunk Animalian moved fairly slowly, but she was still mobile and rather surprised that Anne had asked her to be her maid of honor. Of course some of the question made sense when it was obvious that there was no one to walk Anne down the aisle and that ended up falling to Walter. Thus Janice was asked to be part of the wedding party as well. As she peered through a gap in the curtain, she could see Oscar standing up at the front at his assigned spot while the minister stood a step or so above Oscar. Janice could also see the various family and friends that were gathered in the audience. Fleur was also seated quietly up front as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oui,&quot; Janice answered her mother with a nod and moved back to comfort her mother, who was still pacing back and forth. She figured this was just pre-wedding jitters on her mother&#39;s part, &quot;You&#39;ve been very happy with Oscar, haven&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Anne nodded, &quot;but this is still a wedding... forever... till death us do part. What if we&#39;re wrong? What if it&#39;s only been sex? What if he doesn&#39;t like me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure things will be fine, Mrs. Cumbertin,&quot; Walter spoke up carefully as his mate and her mother shared a hug, &quot;Oscar has been polite and you two have gotten along quite well otherwise. As such... I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll both get along quite well and you&#39;ll be happy as &quot;man and wife.&quot; Which is something that Janice and I both want... to see you happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I thank both of you,&quot; Anne answered, &quot;I&#39;m just nervous. With Janice&#39;s father there was never anything close to this sort of thing. I was largely on my own and I knew that there was nothing returned...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Oscar isn&#39;t like that,&quot; Janice told her mother as she moved around to stand by her husband, &quot;he&#39;s attentive and caring... You&#39;ve even told me how he&#39;ll offer to help with something even if you don&#39;t NEED help with it. That&#39;s far more that what you said you got from my father.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The best thing I got from him was you,&quot; Anne commented and then ran one paw over Janice&#39;s swelling midsection, &quot;and perhaps these grandbabies...&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice smiled, &quot;but that shows how Oscar is different. You will be fine. Just take a deep breath and walk comfortably and confidently. And keep your tail down. You don&#39;t want to lift it and show everyone what you&#39;re wearing for underwear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not wearing any,&quot; Anne answered making Janice shake her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Regardless… be confident and comfortable, for if you want to do this, things will be fine,&quot; Janice assured her mother, just as the first notes of the wedding march began to play. &quot;You can do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Anne swallowed hard, but too Walter&#39;s arm as he head her forward, sliding the curtain to a side as they slowly made their way up the aisle. Janice followed closely behind them, carrying the ring that Anne was to put on Oscar&#39;s ring finger. Her mother looked a bit better, and Janice was glad for that. Anne and Oscar didn&#39;t marry or propose it as quickly as many other Animalian couples often had, and that had allowed Janice and Walter to see that the two did get along and were happy together. It was this that gave Janice the sense that all her mother needed was a bit of a pep-talk to be confident in herself.<br />
<br />
The gathered guests turned and smiled as Walter escorted Anne up the aisle. Even Fleur kept herself calm and smiled as the three went past. Walter walked Anne up so that she stood opposite Oscar, who happily smiled to her, and then walked to stand just behind Oscar in what would be traditionally the &quot;best man&#39;s&quot; spot. Janice following along behind made sure that the back of her mother&#39;s dress was straight and didn&#39;t bunch anywhere and then moved to stand slightly behind her mother and looked to her mate, Walter. One hand fell slightly to rest on her womb and Janice thought, &quot;your grandmother is marrying for love and happiness.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anne remained a bit nervous as they went through the ceremony, but standing there before Oscar and seeing him smile back at her as they stood before Lyre&#39;s priest she managed to calm down a bit. She could see him smile and soon had happy flashbacks at their first meeting and their time spent going jogging together. He was in many ways the sort of man that Janice&#39;s father would never be, and seeming him smile to her eased her worries. That made her happy as they went through the various portions of the wedding, letting the priest give his welcome and invocation and singing through the various songs that were part of the ceremony, and every other step that was part of the wedding. Her nervousness returned a bit as it came time to exchange the rings and vows, as this was the moment where if one of them was to back out it would happen.<br />
<br />
Anne&#39;s hand trembled a little bit as she lifted it forward before her as Oscar reached forward and then softly slid the ring that had been bought for was slid on. As it reached the base of her ring finger, Anne smiled and then followed the instructions for placing the ring she&#39;d bought for Oscar to wear. And as they recited their vows, Anne grew more confident even happier. He smiled to her and never backed away and that made her smile happily as the Priest came to the closing lines...<br />
<br />
&quot;You may now kiss the bride,&quot; the Priest spoke as the two looked to each other.<br />
<br />
Oscar came forward and delivered a warm and gentle kiss on Anne&#39;s lips and she returned it. It might have been a bit &quot;awkward&quot; as a skunk&#39;s muzzle wasn&#39;t designed for kissing, but the love was there and Anne was happy to get the result she wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must admit I was nervous we wouldn&#39;t get this far,&quot; Anne whispered to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn&#39;t,&quot; Oscar whispered back, &quot;You&#39;re smart and kind... pleasant... you enjoy jogging and you have lots of energy. You are a wonderful person...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So are you,&quot; Anne smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which shows how well we&#39;ve come to know each other,&quot; Oscar smiled back, &quot;and how lucky we are to have each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anne smiled and the two kissed again.</p>
