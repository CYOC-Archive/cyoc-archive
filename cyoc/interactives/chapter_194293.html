<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Clyde couldn&#39;t keep his eyes (or hooves) off of Eric after they had settled back into the meal, which only made it more difficult to concentrate.<br />
<br />
&quot;...It&#39;s been an eventful day and we should probably--,&quot; Clyde started.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go! Naida! We could cut through the pheromones with one of those knives! Enjoy yourselves.&quot; Rudy laughed, his nose twinkling as he winked at Clara, who laughed and shook her head as Eric and Clyde both blushed brightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m surprised you lasted this long. Honestly!&quot; Tom teased, his tail brushing against Lars&#39; behind them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have fun!&quot; Lars added, smiling widely as he gave Tom a knowing look.<br />
<br />
Clyde didn&#39;t need to be told twice and he leapt to his hooves with a sheepish grin, Eric quickly behind him as he waved back awkwardly to his brothers. As soon as they were outside, they laughed loudly, twitterpated as they tore across the street--Eric wasn&#39;t even sure he touched the ground the whole way. Clyde threw open his door and pulled Eric inside before closing the door and pushing him up against it with a surprising insistence that went straight to his cock, as he pulled him into an embrace, butting their heads together passionately.<br />
<br />
Eric found with a satisfaction that reindeer lips were quite dextrous and, while different from kissing as a human, they were able to nip at each other in a way that accomplished the same goal, if not moreso as they groaned into each other passionately, pulling off each other&#39;s clothing. Without missing a beat, Clyde lifted Eric into his arms, as the new reindeer wrapped his legs around his waist and with, a mischievous and possessive glint in his eyes, FLEW up the stairs and into the bedroom before depositing him on the edge of the bed. <br />
<br />
Continuing to nip at each other, Eric noticed that Clyde&#39;s cock was at a perfect level as he broke off the kiss and grinned up lecherously, reaching out to take hold of his prize--and what a prize it was. In their time together, and due to their unique situation, they hadn&#39;t had much time to really explore each other&#39;s bodies, aside from their drunken rut. He made up for lost time, pulling his deer towards him and nosing at the base of Clyde&#39;s sheath, his scent giving him a sexual high. Remembering the soft fuzz of Clyde&#39;s muzzle, he ran his own slowly along the length of the shaft and marveled at its size, wondering how he fit it before.<br />
<br />
His tongue proved just as dexterous as he began to lap at the rod, slowly at first but quickly increasing speed as he savored the musty flavor, making sure to pay special attention to the ridge near the tip as that seemed to elicit the best reactions from his lover, who snorted above him, stomping a hoof. Careful of his changed teeth, he took it into his mouth and began to bob his head back and forth along the thick mottled length. He was pleasantly surprised as Clyde took hold of his antlers and, using them as handle bars, grunted and began to thrust as Eric reached to fondle the larger reindeer&#39;s muscled ass with his hooved fingers, his own cock at full mast and throbbing.<br />
<br />
Clyde soon pulled out and bent down to nip once again at Eric&#39;s muzzle before reaching down to take his length into his hands, bringing him with it to a standing position as he butted their heads together once more. &quot;Minun,&quot; Clyde whispered forcefully, with a possessive spark in his eye before spinning Eric around and bending him over the bed.<br />
<br />
Eric felt Clyde crouch down and bury his muzzle into his rear, as his tail flicked in surprise. The reindeer snorted, inhaling deeply and nuzzling between his cheeks before Eric groaned as Clyde&#39;s thick tongue entered him and began to swirl and lap at his entrance. God! He groaned into the bed, thrusting against the bedframe as his hooves scraped against the floor. Clyde was determined, though, and rimmed him thoroughly, his warm breath driving him wild.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ready, Herkkupeppu?&quot; Clyde asked with a laugh as Eric simply nodded breathlessly, looking back to his reindeer.<br />
<br />
Clyde leaned into Eric&#39;s fuzzy ass with his cock, letting it rub against his tail for a moment before circling his entrance as Eric pushed back wantonly. Then, carefully, he pushed as Eric groaned, the thick length piercing him. As Clyde withdrew, Eric found himself following, distraught at the sudden vacancy before he was rewarded again with a larger thrust, deeper this time. He snorted into the bedding, his ears flicking. Again he withdrew and thrust, this time bottoming out as Eric let out a bellow, fully hilted. Like a glove.<br />
<br />
Satisfied, Clyde began to thrust, quickly increasing speed as he uttered what Eric could only assume were Finnish curse words as he leaned forward, resting on top of him, reaching down to take the new deer&#39;s length into his hooves once more. Eric was pleased to find that Clyde&#39;s hooved hand was surprisingly gentle against his flesh, though the rough and hard hooves added an enticing new layer to the sensation as he worked him over, continuing to thrust into him throughout.<br />
<br />
Eric would have been content to do this forever, but he quickly found himself nearing climax. However, when Clyde once again took hold of his antlers with his left hand and used it as a grip to piston in and out, Eric&#39;s body went haywire, as he came all over the bed with another, deep bellow. Clyde quickly took hold of his other antler and began to jackhammer in and out with abandon, redefining the word rut until he unleashed inside of the new reindeer with a stomp and a bellow of satisfaction.<br />
<br />
Breathing heavily, they both seemed to realize at the same time that they were floating over the bed, bright light filling the room as they began to laugh in post-coital bliss. Clyde pulled out carefully before Eric spun to embrace him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Minä rakastan sinua,&quot; Eric said, hoping he had pronounced it correctly. He&#39;d asked Clara how to say it earlier.<br />
<br />
Clyde&#39;s expression made his heart soar as his reindeer tearfully replied, &quot;I love you, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
As they softly drifted back to the ground, there was no doubt in Eric&#39;s mind that he had made the right decision.</p>
