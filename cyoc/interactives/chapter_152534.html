<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeremy was a bit perplexed as Heather practically pushed him all the way into the house. He had some guess that it was in relation to the work-outs that Mr. M had put him through after he got off work at the Horizon office in Dino City, and to a certain extent he&#39;d agreed to those workouts for Heather, but that didn&#39;t mean he wasn&#39;t confused. After all they&#39;d been gone for a few weeks and he&#39;d hoped to see what Rex thought of the trip and Spain. Instead he had his wife moving him through the house and toward the bedroom, and thought he could smell some growing arousal in her scent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm...&quot; Jeremy managed slowly, &quot;not that the attention or desire is bad... but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on... I wanna see,&quot; Heather answered as they finally made it to the bedroom and she set one of her bags down on the floor while Jeremy set down the other, &quot;that shirt looks tighter on you than when I left.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe...&quot; Jeremy commented, &quot;though I hadn&#39;t really noticed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let&#39;s get you out of that shirt and pants and we can see,&quot; Heather commented with a smile as she pressed a button on a small bedside lamp that turned it on to its low setting<br />
<br />
It let her get a better view of her husband, whom she had missed while she was in Spain over the past few weeks. The counseling she&#39;d gotten Lyre that had helped with both her past legal issues and in her relationship with regards to being open with regard to her interest in Jeremy had all helped her tremendously and she&#39;d grown more open those sorts of things. Jeremy did look good and she wasn&#39;t going to not let him know that. His shirt and pants looked tighter around him, which had to mean that he had built up some extra muscle mass over the past few weeks. Jeremy was likely never going to win any body-building competition, but that didn&#39;t mean what he had looked bad.<br />
<br />
She then came forward and slowly began to lift at his shirt. Jeremy didn&#39;t really fight and his face was still carrying a bit of a puzzled look to it, but with her own pheromones going as her aroused anticipation at seeing more sculpted muscle on her husband, Heather could also catch a growing scent of arousal on him. Getting his shirt off only confirmed what Heather suspected, and while Jeremy&#39;s musculature wasn&#39;t as obviously built up the way Mr. M&#39;s was, it was far more defined and a bit larger than he was before she left. She liked that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... you are a bit bigger than before,&quot; Heather smiled as she ran one hand down Jeremy&#39;s chest and loving the firm feel of his firm pectoral muscles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that much bigger,&quot; Jeremy said slowly, though he was beginning to feel his pants begin to grow bit tight as Heather pulled off her shirt and letting him get a better view of Heather&#39;s own generous chest. A part of him swore her nipples were pushing through the pads of her bra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... but still bigger,&quot; Heather smiled, &quot;and after all that I&#39;ve been through... listening to my grandmother and Rex have sex through a wall and not having my mate there... and then finding my handsome mate all the more handsome when I return...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... all this is because you missed me?&quot; Jeremy managed a smile as he undid his own pants and underwear letting his growing erection stand out before him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Heather smiled back while undoing the button on her own jeans and letting them fall to the floor as she then looked to her naked husband and feeling herself grow even more aroused at the sight of his erect shaft. That wasn&#39;t bigger than Heather remembered, but then a penis wasn&#39;t a muscle so it was doubtful that Mr. M could have invented a muscle that would make that grow. &quot;Did you miss me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I did,&quot; Jeremy answered as he turned his head to follow Heather&#39;s movements as she circled him, &quot;And I am greatly pleased to see that you&#39;ve grown even more beautiful since I last saw you...&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather smiled at the compliment. She&#39;d gotten herself in shape before the official opening for Project Mesozoic and did her best to try and stay in shape since the move to Dino City, but much of that was pretty simple. It wasn&#39;t like the exercise regimen that Mr. M had to have put Jeremy through. And he looked good. He wasn&#39;t built up to body builder proportions... for a Dinotopian... the way Mr. M was, but he was definitely more muscular than when she&#39;d left. There was some increased definition in nearly every muscle group. Even the muscles that held his tail just above his glutes looked bigger and more defined. And as she came around to the front of her husband and could stand before him and his erect penis she smiled again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for the compliment,&quot; Heather said to him as came up close to him, feeling her breasts compress against his chest and his shaft being pushed up against his torso as she came in to kiss the front of his muzzle, &quot;though... I kinda got the impression you thought that way by &quot;little Jeremy&quot; standing up at full attention. And seeing how defined you are... that has me wet with anticipation.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two kissed as they came together, giving Heather another chance or two to feel at Jeremy&#39;s new muscle tone and being thoroughly delighted at it. In turn, Jeremy carefully edged Heather toward the bed while returning her kisses and adding a few gentle kisses of his and softly rubbing one horn against hers. He also gently massaged one breast with one hand and reached down between her legs with the other. This raised a heavy and deep moan as he did so, but Jeremy already had the sense that this was what Heather wanted. And if Tyra had been heavily active with Rex while on their honeymoon, some of that was probably quite understandable.  A real part of him wanted to be with Heather in this way but couldn&#39;t while she was away. He just didn&#39;t want to show that when Heather first got back and he didn&#39;t expect her to be as openly direct as she was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ready?&quot; Jeremy asked to her as he helped Heather onto the bed while doing his best to engage in some foreplay as he climbed onto the bed as well, with one hand massaging one breast in a soft circular motion and the other softly running down Heather&#39;s own well defined abdominal muscles. They were trim and smooth and Jeremy had found a few spots that Heather seemed to respond pleasurably to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooooooohhhhh… Yes...&quot; Heather managed a moan, &quot;Please... I really need my big strong mate to stretch me out...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At your pleasure,&quot; Jeremy responded and began carefully inching his member into her, generating heavy moans from both of them and after a moment, Heather thrust her hips forward as the married Syntixisaurus Rex couple began to make up for lost time.</p>
