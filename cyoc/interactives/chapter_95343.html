<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite his successful breakout, Dan had to admit after running for what felt like a few hours that he really did not have a plan to get back at his sister, and he was completely exhausted.<br />
<br />
By now he was in a completely strange neighborhood and the sun was rising. Well, surely Kat wouldn&#39;t be able to find him this far away, right?<br />
<br />
Then Dan thought about the sudden onset of Kat&#39;s magic powers and the reach of her reality warping. Even a few miles of distance between him and that didn&#39;t seem that difficult. His tail sagged in despair. Dan squatted in the middle of the road, out of ideas. Once Kat woke up, she would probably just magically find him and bring him back, and probably change more of his body parts into a dog&#39;s, maybe even really take him to the vet. It was true, there was no way out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello there. Need some help?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan looked up, incredulous. There was a woman dressed in a black dress bending down leaning towards him. His tail was perked up and wagging again. &quot;Yes please!&quot; Then, &quot;Wait, you can tell I&#39;m a human?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then, Dan felt a glimmer of self-consciousness and his paws shot down to cover his dog cock.<br />
<br />
The woman gave a short laugh. &quot;Oh, I get the embarrassment part. It&#39;s okay. So it looks like your sister managed to break a lot of magical rules right after she gained her powers on her birthday. She may be a powerful witch, but she&#39;s nowhere close to the most powerful, and a lot of us noticed the huge mana throughput in the area recently. The local witch council --- that includes me --- is concerned about her magical decisions, to put it mildly. We noticed your case since yesterday but unfortunately we didn&#39;t decide on a plan for helping until now, since she could have easily hold you hostage if we directly confronted her. But now that you&#39;ve gotten out, everything is dandy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan couldn&#39;t believe his luck. &quot;So, you can change me back? And punish Kat for doing what she did?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, sort of...&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman took out some sort of stick from her pocket and waved it in the air. Suddenly Dan felt a force around his entire body, reshaping it. His muzzle jutted out fully and his neck thickened to support it. His tongue pushed out and sagged into the air. His toes thinned out into paws and his arms and legs tensed and shortened into dog&#39;s legs. The fur around his body thickened and spread more across his limbs and genitals.<br />
<br />
Dan tried to scream a curse word at the witch, but all that came out was a horrified howl. She had just sped up the curse! He was completely a dog now, and couldn&#39;t even talk!<br />
<br />
The woman grimaced. &quot;Sorry, directly reversing such a powerful spell when it&#39;s half in effect is very difficult; it&#39;s a lot easier to force it to release all its power and then cast a new spell. Now, you&#39;ll probably want some clothes when you turn back into human, so I want you to imagine a set of clothes on your human body, and try to mentally hold it out to me. And before you ask, no, sorry, you can&#39;t imagine something like an Iron Man suit. Simple clothes. There, that&#39;s good. Now...&quot; She waved her wand in a different way and, more quickly than before, Dan felt all the changes reverse. The fur retracted, his muzzle flattened out, his tongue slipped back into his mouth, his dog cock returned to its human shape, and his body stood itself up onto two legs.<br />
<br />
Then there was another flash and he was clothed! Dan ran a hand over his light gray t-shirt and jeans. Then he pumped his fists in the air. &quot;Yes, yes, thank you so much!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I didn&#39;t completely remove all traces of the curse. This is also easier. You should be able to turn into the dog form that that collar gave you and back again at your will, just like that, whenever you imagine it. But unlike the curse, your human mind will stay entirely intact whatever you to. Want it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan immediately said, &quot;Why would I want to be a dog again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then he thought about the new sensations and even the experience of sucking his own dog cock. It seemed horrible when Kat was forcing him to do it with a wink, but maybe it might not be so bad if he could do it on his own in private.<br />
<br />
Well, he wasn&#39;t about to tell this woman about that last part, but... &quot;...I guess I get it. Thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
He closed his eyes and imagined his dog body. Once more he found himself squatted down on all fours; his muzzle and ears and wet nose grew back onto his old face, his limbs reshaped and gained paws, and the fur fully enveloped his body. That sheathed dog cock was back too.<br />
<br />
Dan opened his eyes and looked around. Unlike before, his mind was indeed perfectly clear. He could sense the same smells as before, but not in a way that prevented him from thinking humanly. Then he imagined his human body again and, even quicker this time, he was back as a normal boy.<br />
<br />
The woman smiled. &quot;Okay, down to business now. What do you want to do to Kat? Do you want us just to show up and arrest her for abusing her witch powers, or would you like to participate in exacting a surprise revenge yourself?&quot;</p>
