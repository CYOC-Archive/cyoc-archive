<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You&#39;re flabbergasted. &quot;She did what!?&quot; you exclaim.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Queen took the amulet back,&quot; says Alex. Then she quickly recounts the tale of Nephi&#39;s siren-song, and Alex&#39;s own compulsion to obey. &quot;It felt . . . it&#39;s hard to explain, but I could feel the need to obey the Queen coming from somewhere down in my *tail*! Like, the very fact of being a mermaid was the reason I had to do what she said.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s creepy,&quot; you comment.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s one of Queen Nephi&#39;s many magical powers that she has over us,&quot; says Yasmin. &quot;We cannot possibly hope to oppose her directly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I guess that leaves Plan B, then,&quot; you say. &quot;Wait until we can get close to Her Majesty and then seduce her and grab the amulet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that sounds like a plan!&quot; agrees Yasmin. &quot;Take it back from her after she&#39;s done *really* enjoying herself thanks to its power. That would be some delicious irony!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We could do that,&quot; says Alex, &quot;but how long would it last? The Queen could just sing her song again and take the relic right back. No, we need a different plan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m fresh out of ideas,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not quite,&quot; says Alex. &quot;There&#39;s still the rest of Plan A.&quot; She nods her head toward the waterfall.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, the cave?&quot; you ask. &quot;Do you really think we&#39;ll find something in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Think?&quot; says Alex. &quot;No, not exactly. It&#39;s . . . more of a vibe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you&#39;re getting hunches?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex nods enthusiastically (which makes her bare tits jiggle enticingly—you notice now that Alex has not bothered to retrieve her bikini-top, though she still wears most of her pirate-jewels). &quot;I know all about wizard shit, remember? I had that amulet on long enough to get a really good sense of what its magic feels like, and I&#39;m feeling a huge pull just like it, coming from that cave.&quot;<br />
<br />
You turn to Yasmin and ask, &quot;Do any mermaids ever go into the cave behind the waterfall?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yasmin scoffs, as if the very notion is ridiculous. &quot;No, of course not. It&#39;s just a dark, scary tunnel. Why would any of us ever want to go in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we&#39;ve got to try it now,&quot; you say. &quot;Come on, ladies. Let&#39;s go do the Indiana Jones thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
* * * * * * * * * *<br />
<br />
The cave-mouth behind the waterfall very quickly narrows down into a tunnel. It&#39;s a lava-tube, really, flooded with seawater now, but once part of a network of such tunnels that probably criss-crossed their way all throughout the innards of this volcanic tropical island.  It&#39;s completely dark, and you have no means to light your way, so you and Alex and Yasmin are compelled to hold hands and feel your way through the tunnel, groping at the rocky walls, making sure that you constantly talk to each other so that you do not lose one or both of your companions in the dark.<br />
<br />
As you follow the tunnel, Alex explains, &quot;It&#39;s the volcano. It has to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the volcano?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; she says, &quot;it&#39;s pointy.&quot; As if that explains everything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, so you know how witches wear pointy hats?&quot; says Alex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how new-age-y weirdos believe in crystals and &#39;pyramid power&#39;?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there you have it!&quot; says Alex. &quot;Volcanoes are full of igneous crystal, and they&#39;re like big, natural cones or pyramids! They&#39;re the perfect shape if you want to make some kind of magical beacon for drawing in and focusing psychic energy!&quot;<br />
<br />
After a quiet beat, you answer: &quot;Uh-huh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh—just you wait until we get to the end of this tunnel!&quot; Alex exclaims. &quot;You&#39;ll see, my hunch is right!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, what exactly *is* your hunch?&quot; asks Yasmin. &quot;How could the Queen be &#39;using&#39; a volcano?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll know when we get to wherever we&#39;re going!&quot; snaps Alex. Which rather definitively ends that conversation.<br />
<br />
While the tunnel continues to be flooded with seawater, you chat with your girls and make small-talk, keeping the conversation to lighter topics. But then, suddenly, the tunnel slants sharply upward, and you and Alex and Yasmin breach the surface of the water. The tunnel continues onward, up and up, in dry air.<br />
<br />
You realize to your dismay that if you want to go on, all three of you will have to crawl and climb over bare rock, with only your arms to pull you forward. Your fishtails will be as useless in this tunnel as they are on the beaches and dunes, and at times perhaps even more of a hindrance, if the slope of the tunnel should ever grow too steep.<br />
c<br />
Alex just tells you to quit being a baby, and she starts pulling her body up the tunnel, groping and feeling her way blindly in the dark. You and Yasmin follow behind, and it is a mercifully short time later that Alex announces that she sees a light up ahead. This renews your hope and your drive and gives you a second wind. Yasmin takes heart as well, and all three of you, two mermaids and a merman, crawl and slither and fish-flop your way up the tunnel and out into the sunlit cavern ahead.<br />
<br />
Cavern is perhaps not quite the right word: you now find yourselves within the caldera of the island&#39;s dormant volcano, you and Alex are both quite sure of that. The rocky walls around you taper up to a relatively small hole in the cavern-ceiling, where you can see blue skies, and sunlight streams down from overhead.<br />
<br />
In fact, the sunlight forms a conical sunbeam that shins onto a single object in the very center of the cavern: a low pedestal of rough black obsidian, upon which sits a glowing crystal, the color of aquamarine. &quot;This is it!&quot; says Alex. &quot;This is the focus!&quot;  She eagerly pulls herself forward across the floor of the caldera, and you and Yasmin follow closely behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what exactly does it do?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
Alex doesn&#39;t answer. She gazes at the glowing crystal in growing fascination. Her expression is blank and her eyes glassy: she is rapt, and she cannot help but reach out and take the object into her hands.<br />
<br />
The very instant Alex touches the crystal, you feel yourself getting . . . aroused. Yasmin likewise feels a growing heat in her breasts and a sudden increase in the flow of egg-lubricating mucous to her fish-genitalia. As for Alex, she&#39;s more than mildly aroused. She moans and straight-up loses control, setting the crystal down again and throwing herself at you. You protest, &quot;Ale—mmph,&quot; in futility as she throws her arms around you, kisses you open-mouthed, lightly and playfully bites at your lip, teases one of your nipples with a forefinger. <br />
<br />
Yasmin also tries to interject. &quot;John, isn&#39;t Alex your cousin? Anyway, maybe this isn&#39;t the best time to—&quot; all rational thoughts leave Yasmin&#39;s mind when she too touches the crystal, and she quickly pushes herself onto you next to Alex and joins in.<br />
<br />
Great, you think to yourself, now I&#39;m being accosted by two horny mermaids, one of whom is my girlfriend and the other I definitely do *not* want to be doing this with—oh, God, that feels good—<br />
<br />
When Yasmin brushes your vent with a light touch of her hand, your tail snaps out, and your flipper happens to graze the crystal. Suddenly, your mind is positively flooded with lust, and with thousands and thousands of images of horny, writhing mermaids trying in utter futility to make love to each other down through the centuries, always trying and never quite managing to drive one another to orgasm.<br />
<br />
You can&#39;t help it. You lose control and give in.<br />
<br />
* * * * * * * * * <br />
<br />
Being in the presence of this weird crystal artifact is a lot like wearing the Mermaid Queen&#39;s amulet, but with the effects magnified tenfold. It takes quite some time before you and Yasmin and Alex are at last too exhausted to keep all having sex with each other, but it does eventually happen. If there&#39;s a small bit of solace you can take from this experience, it&#39;s the fact that you were all at least able to get each other off several times. Which was pretty great, even if you&#39;d been managing to resist the urge to be with Alex all these weeks, only to finally fail now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let us never speak of this to anyone,&quot; you say. You and Alex and Yasmin are all tangled up together, a heap of arms and fishtails, breathing heavily and basking in afterglow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you say, cuz,&quot; says Alex. &quot;But I was right.&quot; She disentangles herself and picks up the crystal again; you and Yasmin both move to stop her, but she just holds the glowing stone away from your reach and brushes you both off. &quot;Relax, we won&#39;t lose control again. Not now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; you ask. &quot;What even *was* that that just happened, just now? What the hell *is* that thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a . . . a phylactery,&quot; says Alex. &quot;A receptacle. A vessel for drawing in and containing all of the island&#39;s psycho-sexual energy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Psychic sex magic?&quot; echoes Yasmin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much,&quot; says Alex. &quot;See, I have a theory here. I think that mermaids can get it on just fine. That if it weren&#39;t for the Queen, we could finger-fuck, tail-shag, fish-bone, and fin-bang each other all day long for the rest of ever, and it would be fucking *glorious*. But instead, the Queen and her stupid Goddess put this magic rock here to siphon away all of our sex-energy and make it so that we can&#39;t come unless we&#39;re wearing some stupid special amulet that makes us immune to the rock&#39;s effects.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think that the Queen&#39;s amulet doesn&#39;t have any real power of its own?&quot; you say. &quot;That it&#39;s just blocking what this stone does?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s sure what it feels like,&quot; says Alex. &quot;Can&#39;t you sense how strongly this rock pulls on the ley-lines in the local mana-field?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, no,&quot; you reply, &quot;I cannot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d make a shit wizard, Johnny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yasmin giggles at Alex&#39;s comment and then asks, &quot;So what do we do about it? How do we fix this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only one way,&quot; says Alex. And before either of you can react, she dashes the stone onto the cave-floor and shatters it into a million pieces.</p>
