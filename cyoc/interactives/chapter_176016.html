<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Back in the army tent, the last three soldiers hid away and tried to cope with the freakish transformation they all just saw their buddy John and few others go through outside. They were hunkered down on one knee with their rifles at their sides in a defensive posture which gave them a strategic edge, two of them guarding the flap of the tent while the other fiddled with a radio on the ground. Each of them knew that the others had to be shaken, but they were all doing their best to keep it together and push on. That’s what helped them believe they were gonna make it through this in one piece.<br />
<br />
“Hello, command? Command, please respond!” The soldier radioing called into the mic, a fresh-faced cadet graduate named Archer. Eventually, a signal got through.<br />
<br />
“We hear you. What’s your status?” said a staticky voice on the other line.<br />
<br />
“O-Oh, thank God! Listen. You’re never going to believe this. A s-strange kind of...kind of...infection is spreading around our camp! We’re in dire straights. I can confirm only three of us are safe at the moment, but we need some help. You’ve gotta dispatch a strike team ASAP to our location at—”<br />
<br />
“Shhh! Archie, keep it down a minute.” said Gabe, keeping an ear open through the tarp. “Hey Kumar, you hear that out there?”<br />
<br />
The other lookout leaned forward to listen, and after a while, he was able to detect what was the unmistakable sound of something roaring out into the distance. He then confirmed as much with his friend.<br />
<br />
“Shit. And it think it’s getting closer, too.” Gabe scowled as he scooped up tobacco from a little tin in his pocket to calm his nerves. “Keep yourselves sharp.”<br />
<br />
The bellowing grew louder as the seconds went on, accompanied by the din of hooves trampling the ground. It seemed like whatever the beast was it was big and meant to charge through their tent. Each of them prepared in their own way for a tactical engagement, fully expecting the worst. It was right on top of them now, and the could almost sense the hostility in its invisible presence. But nothing ever broke through their line, and instead it began to sound like the noises were getting quieter, rapidly fading away until it was completely out of earshot.<br />
<br />
“Fuck. That thing’s playing games with us, whatever it is.” Gabe said before he spat into the dirt. “Any luck gettin’ back up this way, Arch?”<br />
<br />
“No.” He looked down at the transponder in his nerve-wracked hand. “I-I...they still want me to give them more details before they confirm.”<br />
<br />
“Well, hurry up with it then, ‘cause we’re short enough on time as it is without your—”<br />
<br />
“Shhh!” This time, Kumar cut in. “Wait. I can hear something again.”<br />
<br />
They all fell silent and opened their ears. There definitely something out there again, but this time even fainter sounding than before. It seemed like the voice of a man shouting from somewhere far away. No one was sure if he recognized it, but it was deep and seemed to be saying things like “anybody there!?” and “I want to help.”<br />
<br />
“Crap, what if it’s another soldier? Or maybe one of the enemy?” Archie muttered his thoughts out loud.<br />
<br />
“I don’t give a damn who it is, as long as it’s not one of those freaks.” Gabe said with assurance. “Kumar, you’re with me. We’re gonna go see if that’s a friend out there. Archie, you finish up the distress call and find a place to lay low. We reconvene before sunset.”<br />
<br />
“Copy that.” They both uttered in turn before getting into motion.<br />
<br />
Several minutes went by unnoticed by Archie, alone in the tent, as he completed the help request with command. From the sound of it, it seemed like he could be confident that help would arrive fairly soon. He hung up the radio. Relieved but exhausted from all the stress, he threw his face into his hands and let himself cry a little. Nobody ever told him how much being drafted into service would put a strain on his whole sense of what he thought was real.<br />
<br />
The flap of the tent parted open again, and a pair of long shadows cast themselves into the room over the boy’s despairing figure. The two minotaurs were able to creep up on him fairly easily because he kept his back turned to the entrance and forgot entirely about finding a place to hide. Mark led the way followed closely behind by Tommy. It had to be that way, or else the young bull’s primal urges might get the better of him and ruin the surprise.<br />
<br />
“Aww, whats’a matter, princess?” Tommy laughed. “You need rescuing?”<br />
“Damn, way to muck it up, idiot.” thought Mark, rolling his eyes.<br />
<br />
The rattled young soldier spun around and screamed at the sight of the enormous creatures, his eyes focusing on the obscenely large members throbbing between their legs. He tried to scuttle away, but the bull-men reacted quicker than he did, and in an instant they had him pinned to the ground by the arms and legs.<br />
<br />
“Let me go! Let me go, LET ME GO!” He shrieked loud enough to wake the dead.<br />
<br />
“Aw, Yeah! Now it’s my turn.” said Tommy, almost slobbering while his fingers were wrapped around tugging at the man’s belt line. “You gotta let me pump you up, bro. Pump you up real big like me and Dylan. Then, we can be a real brotherhood and pound ass all the way back to the states.”<br />
<br />
“No! No, you’re not them! You’re not real! You can’t—Mmph!”<br />
<br />
While he was distracted arguing with Tommy, Mark had been working to level his cock with the young soldier’s mouth, finally getting the chance to shove it in and silence him. Archer nearly choked to death on the beastman’s almost squash-sized member probing into the back of his throat and stuffing his cheeks. After some demeaning words, Mark convinced him to breathe through his nose and then got to work building a good rhythm for fucking his face. The entire time, Archer was scared stiff beyond thought or action, knowing only that the bull-man’s furry balls slapping the bridge of his nose smelled of this kind of sickly sweet musk which he was liking more by the second. Meanwhile, the other steer had dropped the young soldier’s pants completely and wasted no time ramming his rod hard into his comrade’s exposed virgin asshole.<br />
<br />
“Mmnh, fuck yeah! Take that like a bitch, baby...” He roared as the man flailed helplessly around his pole moaning in pain, his cheeks being spread farther apart than either of them thought humanly possible. “Haha~! But you’re not gonna stay a bitch for long are you?” He asked, continuing to thrust into him steadily and taking note of how he was already slipping into semi-consciousness. “There’s a real champ underneath all that puniness, ain’t there? Just waiting to fly out, guns fully loaded...ten-outta-ten...free like the motherfuckin’ air...Aaah! Haaah! Mruuu, I’m gonna...”<br />
<br />
A deafening roar shook the whole tent as Tommy busted inside of him. His corrupting seed flooded his insides, burning him while the rapid changes overtook his lower body. Archer convulsed madly, his skinny thighs quadrupling in thickness as the ass above them went from flat and barely noticeable to packed full of lean, sculpted muscle in a matter of seconds. It took almost no time at all after for his abs to stretch taut into a perfect washboard and his toes to start fusing together into hard, black hooves. Most painful though had to be him growing a tail, which formed at first as a mound at the base of his spine before it burst out fully grown in a tiny spurt of blood.<br />
<br />
Mark looked on gawking at what the young soldier was becoming right before his eyes. The change never seemed to stop being hot to him, no matter how many guys he saw it happen to. And in that moment, he was just so turned on it made him want to try doing something that he, as a lifelong straight man, never imagined he would. Pulling his cock head out of Archer’s mouth and letting his<br />
erotic moans cry out unobstructed, he hoisted him up by the shoulders and aligned the tip of his hard-on with the man’s rear, which was still leaking cream from Tom. With inhibitions long behind him, Mark thrusted his steerhood deep into his buddy’s hole. It made him feel so damn powerful. Although, something told him he would have enjoyed it better if he didn’t pick such an awkward hold to fuck him in; stopping himself from letting down such a rapidly growing boy was murder on the knees.<br />
<br />
Just then, John and the rest of the minotaur squad came trotting in through the tent flaps with the last to uninfected men on the team squirming in tow. One of the soldiers gasped at the perverse ritual taking place before him while the other was just beside himself in tears. Dylan and John forced them down into a kneeling position, pressing firm in their shoulders to keep them in place. Disarmed and beyond tired of all this insanity, they had very little reason to resist.</p>
