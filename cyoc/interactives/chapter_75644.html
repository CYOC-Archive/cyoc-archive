<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The first thing to do was make sure there would be no immediate complications.  I had wished for no one to <br />
notice Colette enter the woods, but that was no longer sufficient.  Now I wished that no one would be <br />
concerned she was missing.  I notice her backpack laying on the ground.  I wished that it would be in her room <br />
in her house where it would normally be.  <br />
<br />
Once it disappeared I picked up Colette and held her in my arms.  She felt remarkably light, as if I had <br />
greatly increased strength.  I just looked at her for a moment.  She was still out of it.  I doubt she <br />
realized that I was holding her.  She continued to babble as well.  I was able to make out her saying, “Chris…<br />
vampire…called me…had to.”  I didn’t want her to suffer any permanent damage so I had to move fast.  I wished <br />
that we would be transported to the bedroom chamber in the castle and that it would already be fully lit.<br />
<br />
I blinked my eyes as I completed my wish and by the time they were open again we were in the castle.  We were <br />
right next to the bed.  I gently placed Colette down on the bed.  Her body stopped shaking and her muttering <br />
stopped as well.  Her breathing returned to a normal rate and I sensed that her heartbeat normalized as well.  <br />
Her eyes remained wide open and continued to look straight ahead.  They looked like they were glassed over.  <br />
<br />
I had to snap her out of her trance.  “Colette,” I said to her.<br />
<br />
Her head turned to look at me.  She blinked her eyes a few times.  She looked around the room in an attempt to <br />
gather her surroundings.  “Chris, wh—where am I?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“You are in my castle,” I answered.<br />
<br />
“Castle?” she asked.  She appeared confused.  Her hands felt at her neck.  They found the marks that were left <br />
by my fangs.  “You’re a vampire?  How is that—“<br />
<br />
“Shh, shh,” I said.  “It is not important ‘how.’  Only the ‘why’ is important.  And the ‘why’ is because I can <br />
and because I want to.”<br />
<br />
“What do you want with me?” she asked.<br />
<br />
I smiled at her.  “I thought that was obvious,” I said.  “I want you to be with me.  As my bride.”<br />
<br />
“Your bride?” she asked.  “You mean…you want me to…be a vampire too?”<br />
<br />
I nodded.  “To be with me always,” I said.  <br />
<br />
“What if I don’t want to be a vampire?” asked Colette.<br />
<br />
“Tell me,” I said.  “Why did you come to the woods?  Because you heard a voice in your head?”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” she answered.  “Because it was you.”<br />
<br />
“But you did not know it was my voice when you came,” I reminded her.  “It could have been anyone.  You must <br />
have had a better reason.”<br />
<br />
She looked at me with pained, moistening eyes.  “Because I wanted to,” she said.  “I thought…there had to be a <br />
reason.  I had to know what it was.”<br />
<br />
“And once you saw it was me?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“I…I don’t know,” she answered.<br />
<br />
“Did you feel safe?” I asked.<br />
<br />
She answered, “I guess so.”<br />
<br />
“Why did you plead with me to not hurt you then?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“I…”  She couldn’t answer me right away.  “I got scared,” she finally replied.<br />
<br />
“Of me?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” she said.  “You seemed…different.  Dangerous.  You looked frightening.”<br />
<br />
“Do you find me dangerous now?” I asked.  My goal was to break down her reasoning and also to make her realize <br />
that she had nothing to fear.<br />
<br />
She reached up to the marks on her neck.  “No,” she said.  “I don’t.  Why don’t I?  Shouldn’t I be terrified <br />
of you?”<br />
<br />
“Only you can answer that,” I said.  <br />
<br />
“I’m not,” she said resolutely.  “I feel…drawn to you.  Are you doing that?  Are you influencing me?”<br />
<br />
I wasn’t really sure.  I’d given myself these supposedly persuasive abilities, but I didn’t know if I had to <br />
summon them or if they exuded from me naturally.  “I honestly don’t know,” I said.  I decided to show <br />
vulnerability for the first time.  “I should be highly persuasive but…with you…I would rather not influence <br />
you.”  That was my honest feeling.  I wanted her, of course, but I wanted her willingly.  With any other <br />
person it would probably be a different story.<br />
<br />
“Then…I’m meant to be here,” said Colette.  “Deep down, I must have known that voice was you.  And I wanted to <br />
find you.”  She felt my bite marks on her neck.  “It doesn’t hurt.  Huh.”  She smiled slightly at this <br />
discovery.  She stopped feeling her neck and looked at me again.  “Your bride.  Does that mean I’ll be your <br />
slave?”<br />
<br />
“Never,” I said.  “We would be equals.”<br />
<br />
She asked, “But what about everything else?  School and family and--“<br />
<br />
“You do not have to worry about them,” I interrupted her.  “I have that ability.”  She pondered for a few <br />
moments.  I felt confident that she would talk herself into agreement.  But eventually I grew impatient and <br />
asked her, “Have you decided?”</p>
