<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Coffee. You drink two full pots of coffee while wearing a very tight compression cycling suit. Sitting on the bar stood, you ponder what if you didn&#39;t have Candy with you last night. You can&#39;t get past feeling so venerable and helpless, and that has you a bit angry at yourself. You finish off the second pot while keeping an eye on the clock, and soon enough it&#39;s time to leave. You head into your bedroom, and a naked human form Candy meets you at the door.<br />
<br />
Candy smiles, &quot;Time to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
You follow the naked Candy out to the garage, where you lock the door and open the garage door as she is tugging and sliding her cycling suit on. Once Candy is stuffed into her suit you ask, &quot;Where is Muffin today?&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy nods, &quot;Yea, I took to long last night, so she will not be joining us today. She should join us tomorrow.&quot; Candy then reaches over and gives your butt a firm squeeze. You give a wiggle as Candy smiles, &quot;You lead today. I want to enjoy the view from behind today.&quot;<br />
<br />
You stand up, and then push down on the pedal and your off, with Candy right behind. The garage door goes down just as you get to the end of the driveway. You notice a lot more since your in front, mostly other walkers staring when you stop at an intersection. You arrive without incident at the bike parking rack, with Candy right behind. After you both lock your bikes, you walk up to Candy, and wrap your arms around her and kiss her passionately. Candy returns the kiss with her hands on your butt, squeezing tightly.<br />
<br />
Candy smiles, &quot;See you at lunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
You both slowly release from your embrace and start toward the stairs, with you in front. Your desk has become a zone of normality, since work you do hasn&#39;t changed. Gerry came in over an hour late, as he came into your cubicle and closed the door, triggering you to turnaround.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow...Gerry?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
Gerry is wearing a dress shirt and slacks, but the slacks are form fitting and a bit stretchy. Gerry&#39;s eyes go a wide, &quot;I know...but I don&#39;t believe it still. None of my clothes fit this morning, so I wore sweats to the store to find something to wear. I had to get an attendant to help me find something to fit, as the men&#39;s slacks were not working.&quot;<br />
<br />
You raise an eyebrow, &quot;They fit rather snug.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerry nods, &quot;I woke up with a butt like yours, but I am half of what I weighted yesterday. I spent all night in the bathroom. I think I pooped it out. I don&#39;t know what you did...thank you. Do you know why my butt is like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Gerry...&quot; you start, &quot;...how much did you like mine?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot,&quot; Gerry responds...meekly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you were a breast man,&quot; you chuckle briefly before continuing, &quot;evidently...you seem to have woke up with your ideal ass. But form fitting slacks?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerry was blushing now, &quot;They were easy to slide on over these thighs and butt, and didn&#39;t pinch. I didn&#39;t want dress leggings, so women&#39;s slacks were all we could find. They were the most comfortable slacks that would even fit.&quot; Gerry had quite the muscle definition in his calves and thighs showing through, very manly, muscular, and younger looking.<br />
<br />
You nod, &quot;You look great. Gerry...why don&#39;t you come over to my place Friday after work? We can order in and just hang out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerry smiles, &quot;That would be great.&quot;<br />
<br />
You smile, a bit embarrassed in asking, &quot;Can you bring the cards, I think strip poker will be interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
You watch Gerry&#39;s growing erection push out and bulge out of his tight slacks, as Gerry delays his response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummm....yea. I&#39;m good with that,&quot; Gerry stumbles.<br />
<br />
You reach out and caress the tight fabric containing Gerry&#39;s cock bulge. &quot;How do you want to take care of this?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
Gerry sighs and softly bats your hand away from his bulge, &quot;You know how I feel about you teasing me at work. How about you pick this up on Friday night during cards?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can do,&quot; you nod, &quot;By the way...when have you ever tried to win at poker with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerry smiles and shakes his head, &quot;You know....your a good friend. I just don&#39;t want to ruin that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You worry too much. I&#39;m not her,&quot; you add, &quot;I never hurt you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerry nods, &quot;I know.I don&#39;t know where this came from,&quot; as he waves his hand down from his chest to his knees, &quot;but I think you had something to do with it. I look the same age as you now. I need time on this. Thank you for this. I need time to catch up. Friday night will be good, just keep the teasing to a minimum until then, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Scouts honor,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s my line,&quot; Gerry quips playfully. Gerry smiles, then turns to open your door, &quot;I&#39;ll work through lunch to make up for being late.&quot; Gerry waves as he goes into his office next door.<br />
<br />
Lunch time comes, and you knock on Gerry&#39;s door. Gerry keeps his head forward on his computer and says, &quot;I&#39;ll do lunch tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
You head down to the third floor and get in the back of a short lunch line. You sit down and eat while waiting for Candy. A guy you don&#39;t recognize sits down in front of you and tries to make small talk. He is clearly attempting to flurt when Candy comes up behind him and puts her hand on his shoulder, and leans down to his ear and softly says, &quot;Come back later kid.&quot; The man quietly gets up and leaves with his lunch. Candy sits down in his seat, &quot;Who was that?&quot;<br />
<br />
You shrug your shoulders, &quot;I don&#39;t know. He was struggling for words. His eyes kept switching between his lunch and my chest. It was a bit amusing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get used to that, you keep staring at my chest too. Old habits die hard,&quot; Candy chided.<br />
<br />
Your eyes widen as you gaze at Candy&#39;s noticeable nipples poking through her suit, &quot;Hey now, I like how you look. You have a very outlined set of nipples showing through.&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy gives you a rather sly look, &quot;You keep teasing like that, and we will have to find a private spot for a few minutes.&quot; Candy reaches forward and pats the back of your hand, and asks, &quot;Did you invite your &quot;little&quot; friend over Friday?&quot;<br />
<br />
You relax and answer, &quot;I did. When he left yesterday, he had already lost a lot of weight, and this morning he was even smaller, more muscular, and had my ass. Why so big, and not a man&#39;s muscular butt?&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy pats your hand again before pulling back to eat her lunch. After a few bites, she stops and answers, &quot;Because a man&#39;s ass is too plain. He&#39;s all man, except for he now has the ass of a woman he desires, you. He&#39;s not sad about it, ask him. Your not sad either, it&#39;s the same proportions yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
You let Candy eat in silence, your lack of a response serves to validate Candy&#39;s statement. Candy smiles at you, but mostly stares at your face or her food tray. Candy finishes her last bite, and says, &quot;I should have told you about your friend&#39;s changes. Your really protective of him, are you honest with yourself about how you feel about him?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerry is the closest member of your work family. You have covered for each other in the past, and you were there for the ugly and messy end of his marriage. He&#39;s like an older brother to you, but you look forward to him filling you with that bulge you felt earlier on his much younger and thinner body.<br />
<br />
You nod to Candy, &quot;Gerry is a good man. He has always treated me right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You feel obligated to him, even before...not submissive...but you seek his protection and approval, and yet your only now attracted to him physically,&quot; accuses Candy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will not deny that,&quot; you admit to Candy.<br />
<br />
Candy picks up her tray, &quot;As long as your honest with yourself. His memories are a little different than yours, he only remembers you as you are now. See you after work.&quot; Candy walks over to deposit her food tray in the return line, and walks out of the eating area.<br />
<br />
You order a drink and an energy bar to go for Gerry, and head back upstairs to deliver them. You knock and place the drink and energy bar on his desk. You take your time leaning over with your chest now at eye level if he turns his head.<br />
<br />
Gerry turns his head, locking his eyes to your chest, &quot;Thank you.&quot; as his eyes move to match yours. You step back and lay your head on his shoulder as Gerry turns his head back to the computer screen. Gerry reaches up and pats your cheek, then you turn and kiss his cheek. You stand up, hesitate a moment, then return to your chair to finish the day.  The knock on your door as your finishing up the day is Gerry. He stands there and you finish up and turn off your computer and standup, smiling when you see it&#39;s Gerry. Gerry asks, &quot;Can I use your couch tonight? I&#39;ll bring supper. Sirloin and baked potato?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod slowly, &quot;You bet, bring enough for four. I&#39;ll be home by 7, so you can cook.&quot; Your eyes noticing his bulge has returned.<br />
<br />
Gerry steps in to return the kiss on the cheek earlier, says &quot;7 it is, and food for four,&quot; then walks to the stairwell with you following behind. You meet Candy in the stairwell walking up, and together the three of you enter the parking area, with Gerry separating and going to his car.<br />
<br />
You and Candy unlock your bikes when you say, &quot;Gerry is coming tonight with supper. He is bringing food to cook for four.&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy smiles, &quot;Sounds good. Muffin will not be joining us tonight, she will be back when you wake up tomorrow morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your blushing and Candy notices,  then Candy says &quot;I can read your mind or you can tell me, your choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Slowly you lean forward to Candy and whisper, &quot;Can you help me add a knot to his cock?&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy smiles, &quot;Your one perverted girl. You bet I&#39;ll help. He&#39;s a good kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy straddles her bike and is off, with you right behind. You enjoy following Candy, even though it&#39;s getting dark. The ride home goes quick as you enjoy the view, hitting the garage door remote as Candy rolls onto the driveway. You close the door with Candy pointing to her zipper. You park, dismount your bike, then step over to unzip Candy&#39;s suit. &quot;I&#39;ve worn leather, but this breaths so much better.&quot; Candy drapes her skinsuit over her bike. You step up and unlock the garage door into the kitchen, and allow Candy to step inside first, already sporting her otteress tail on her human form. Looking at the clock, Gerry should be here in just over thirty minutes. Candy has already crashed and is asleep on your bed as you walk into your bedroom. You turn around and plop down into the recliner and wait for the doorbell.<br />
<br />
Your awaken by the door bell and knocking. Groggily,  you get up from the recliner and head to the door to open it. Gerry smiles, &quot;Go finish your nap while I cook.&quot; Your in no condition to argue, and return to the recliner and your short term slumber. You awaken to a kiss from Gerry. You smile and wrap your arms around his neck and pull him on top of you in the recliner. Your tongue explore each other&#39;s for a while, before Gerry breaks the kiss, and you release his neck. Gerry stands up, noticeable since he is now only wearing the form fitting slacks and nothing else. Gerry brags, &quot;You liked how these looked on me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmmm....,&quot; you smile and nod, &quot;I still do. I can use some help to unzip.&quot; You then sit up in the recliner, standing up, then stepping over to face away from Gerry. You feel his fingers fiddle for the tiny zipper pull, and then as he pulls down you feel your upper body freed from its spandex corset. You lean forward as you both slowly pull and tug your suit downward over your butt and thighs. You step out of the suit, wearing only the cycling shoes. Gerry laughs at the shoes. You drape your skinsuit over  a chair, then return to Gerry and tug down on his slacks. He slides the stretchy pants off and you take them to drape over your skinsuit.<br />
<br />
&quot;You crashed pretty hard when you got here,&quot; Gerry says, trying not to laugh that your still wearing the shoes. &quot;Where are your two friends? I cooked for four.&quot; Gerry asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;They may join later, or not. It&#39;s just us for now. Can I offer you a drink?&quot; you offer to Gerry, as you squeeze a dribble of milk from your left breast. You then step over to the couch and lie down, with Gerry slowly climbing on top of  you.<br />
<br />
Gerry asks, &quot;Couldn&#39;t wait until Friday?&quot;<br />
<br />
You shake your head no, and Gerry takes your left breast into his mouth and begins to suckle. You let out a slight gasp, then a slow sigh of relief as Gerry drains both breasts while you relax to a growing warmth between your legs. You run your hands up and down Gerry&#39;s muscular shoulders and upper arms, with an occasional deep chest moan as he suckles. Gerry sits up and leans back, letting his belly full of milk process. You then take the opportunity to slide down to the floor, remove your cycling shoes, and then stand on your knees. Gerry&#39;s eyes are closed as you reach around his cock and take it into your mouth. You slide your other hand under the cushion so you can slide a finger into Gerry&#39;s ass so you can touch his prostate. You feel it&#39;s distinctive bump and confirm it with a spasm of throbbing of Gerry&#39;s cock. You take it slow with your prostate milking, letting Gerry get to the edge of orgasm quickly, but holding him there for several minutes while you work your finger magic and get a slight but steady stream of fluid from Gerry&#39;s cock. It isn&#39;t until Gerry begs you to finish, that you turn up the intensity of your oral ministrations, and drive Gerry over the edge. You hungered for this at work, and now your rewarded as you slow your prostate finger down to make the most of milking Gerry&#39;s orgasm. You work your tongue and throat to keep the glans stimulated while swallowing the salty seed, as the rest of his body jerks and twitches in orgasm. Gerry grunts for you to stop, now several moments past when he ran dry, but your still in your cock milking frenzy. Gerry pushes your head back as you give up and let the shrinking organ disappear into a floppy sausage. Gerry is panting as you go and get a drink of water and mouthwash before giving Gerry a kiss. You come back to a spent man who has seemingly melted into the sofa.<br />
<br />
Gerry pants, &quot;Wow....that finger thing.....that&#39;s new. I love it.&quot;<br />
<br />
You smile, &quot;Yea, I could not wait until Friday. I smell steak.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerry stands and takes your hand, leading you to the cooktop, &quot;Almost rare sirloin and one baked potato with bacon for two.&quot; Gerry hands you one of the two pre-prepared plates along with flatware and you both eat standing up side by side at the bar. Wanting more, you both finish of the other two steaks and potatoes. You and Gerry then walk past a sleeping Candy and into your shower.<br />
<br />
Gerry stands slightly taller than you flat footed. Gerry asks, &quot;So is this because of how I look now or  is it something else.?&quot;<br />
<br />
You look up slightly into Gerry&#39;s eyes, &quot;Eye candy helps. Are you good to be more than just friends now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerry looks away for a moment, then looks back at you, &quot;I didn&#39;t trust myself to not ruin it with you. I&#39;m almost twice your age. And for all the times I slept here, it was on your couch and I didn&#39;t want to mess up our friendship. I thought we were pressing it with strip poker on Fridays. That&#39;s on me.&quot;<br />
<br />
You ask Gerry, &quot;Well, do you want to go back to the way you were and find out?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerry shakes his head no, &quot;Not for me, we don&#39;t. If you want me to,  we can.&quot;<br />
<br />
You reach forward and give a gentle pinch of Gerry&#39;s limp cock, &quot;That&#39;s a stupid thing to say. Really Gerry? After all we&#39;ve shared together? I am still angry at your ex-wife for screwing with your mind and leaving you the emotional wreck  you are. And yes, being younger is a big plus if you want to know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerry smiles, and pinches one of your erect nipples, &quot;I&#39;m better now with you. It feels good to be young again. I cannot remember an orgasm like that, so it has been a very long time.&quot; Gerry steps behind you and wraps his arms under your breasts and holds you snugly against him under the shower. The moment is disturbed when Candy comes in to the bathroom, and joins you two in the shower.<br />
<br />
Candy taps you on the shoulder and gives you the motion to get out. Gerry looks confused. Candy smiles to Gerry, &quot;Just close your eyes and let me work.&quot; Candy turns to you and motions for you to leave the bathroom. Reluctantly, you leave after grabbing a towel to dry off with. Candy left the bed a mess, so you pull back the blankets and sheets, so you can redo the bed. You are tired, so you lay back on the bed. Your impatience soon gets the best of you as you sit up, and watch as a towel wrapped Candy and Gerry enter the room.<br />
<br />
Candy says, &quot;I&#39;ll be back,&quot; and leaves.<br />
<br />
Gerry smiles, &quot;I think I know how this all happened. Your friend there. She told me you had a request.&quot; Gerry then unwraps the towel and shows you a sheath instead of a limp sausage. Gerry licks his finger and then strokes the opening to his sheath as his cock begins to grow. As Gerry&#39;s cock gets to full length, you stare at a foot long otter cock with a flared, fat human tip and a rather large unpopped knot at the base.<br />
<br />
You smile, &quot;That will do,&quot; and you lie back on the bed as Gerry climbed onto the bed and positions his erect tip at your most slit, and slowly, but firmly slides into you. You feel every inch and the smoothness of Gerry&#39;s cock, and enjoy the flared circumcised tip, and it really pushes against your g spot just inside your opening. Gerry takes his time as he pulls almost out, then rams in. You don&#39;t orgasm first, as Gerry&#39;s orgasm sneaks up and explodes inside him, and he pushes hard into you. The warmth of his seed fills you, along with a fist sized knot that throbs against your g spot, pushing your orgasm over the edge. The knot is huge and your muscles squeeze it has hard as you can, driving your orgasm to the next crashing wave.<br />
<br />
Candy watches from the doorway, as Gerry relaxes on top of you. The knot and your orgasm have your complete attention when Candy crawls onto the bed and lays down beside you two, watching you savor your female bliss. Gerry becomes very drowsy, and falls asleep. Candy waits until your third orgasmic wave has passed and your own body starts to return to normal before tapping your arm. &quot;I hope that knot was big enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
You smile, and let out a deep and satisfied, &quot;mmmmmmmmm......mmmmmmmmmmmm.....&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy grins and brags, &quot;Good. It should match up with your g-spot nicely. Anyway....relax and sleep.&quot; You feel that sensation you felt when Muffin melded into your body, as Candy does the same. Soon, you and Gerry are the only ones on the bed, still tied together with his engorged knot. Your eyes heavy, your soon asleep after being awake for two days.</p>
