<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With a hasty hello and goodbye to his parents, Chase locks himself into his room and preemptively undresses before he’s even taken Ty out of the backpack. <br />
<br />
Nearly ripping the bag open, Chase rifles through the contents to pull out his new, prized possession. <br />
<br />
Ty sits snugly inside his prison, eyes still closed by twitching as if they want to open. Chase takes a closer look and gently shakes the plastic container, pleased to see Ty’s smashed lips contract, leaving a wet spot, and his entire form to subtly quiver.<br />
<br />
“You’re awake?” He asks, and Ty gives a muffled, closed mouth complaint in reply. “Well you’re too big to pull out of the opening safely, so I was thinking of just maybe taking a hammer to it.” Ty struggles more, squeaking his cuboid body against the smooth, hard plastic. Chase grins and tosses him onto the bed, then turns to his closet to find the little tool bag he keeps inside.<br />
<br />
He also grabs a towel, to muffle the sound, and a plastic bag to toss the broken pieces into.<br />
<br />
“Alright, ready babe?” Chase asks the cube of flesh. It moans and quakes, probably in a ‘no’, but it’s not like it really has much of a choice. Chase places it over the towel and wraps it all up, then takes the hammer and hits it down atop the bundle. Too soft. He tries again, a bit harder, and then again, even harder. The fourth hit finally produces a cracking sound, so he removes the towel to see his progress. There’s a large fracture running from the middle of the containers steepled roof, around to its side. Chase tries to pry it open but there’s not enough give, so he wraps it up once more and tries again. A few more gently hits and the container begins to break apart. He opens the towel again to see that despite it now being in separate pieces, they all remain in place, as if held by something. <br />
<br />
“Huh?” Chase picks it up and feels the fractured plastic shift in his hold. It feels almost as if it’s attached to silicone, and he takes ahold of the front piece to give a test tug. Ty moans as his lips stretch, suctioned to the plastic. With a yank and a loud, wet kissing sound, the front face of plastic finally gives, detaching from Ty’s rubbery body and leaving it to jiggle. <br />
<br />
Chase takes the container into both hands, grappling more of the fragments and pulling. He watches as Ty distends, his skin sticking to both until with a *smack*, he pops free and lands wobbling on the towel. <br />
<br />
Ty blinks, and smacks his lips. <br />
<br />
Chase leans closer and scoops him into his palms. He’s smooth and shiny, firm like an eraser, but spongy enough to indent when squeeze. Ty groans and coughs as he’s poked and prodded, moving his lips around and licking at them as if to stretch his sore jaw. <br />
<br />
“Did you have to put me in such a small bottle?” He asks, his voice clear like it had been when was first reformed after being melted. It seemed that was the best method thus far, leaving Ty more…well, not normal, but whole. At least compared to some of Chase’s other attempts and experiments.<br />
<br />
“It’s all I had. You’re a lot more compact, sure, but I’m not too worried.” He replies, rubbing a thumb over Ty’s corners. He doesn’t really have cheeks anymore.<br />
<br />
He also has to turn the boy to the side to make eye contact with him. He has nice, almond shaped eyes, deep chocolate ones that shine in the light. <br />
<br />
Ty squints up at Chase. It’s difficult read his expression when he’s shaped like this, but he can tell the boy is frowning. Having his eyes on separate faces of his body must be disorienting.<br />
<br />
“Oh, yeah, *you’re* not worried about it. You’re also not the one who’s palm sized.”<br />
<br />
“Wanna see what you look like now?” Chase stands and heads to his full length mirror. He holds Ty up and turns him from side to side. <br />
<br />
“Jesus Christ, what did you do to me?”<br />
<br />
“I guess you take the shape of whatever I put you in when you melt. We can melt you again and maybe try something bigger?”<br />
<br />
Ty blinks at his reflection and gently rocks in Chase’s hold. <br />
<br />
“Did you take a bite of me earlier? And then cum into me?” He asks, taking Chase by surprise. For once, the taller man blushes and is at a loss for words.<br />
<br />
“You were conscious for that?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah. I was. I couldn’t see or hear too well but I fucking felt it.”<br />
<br />
“Well I had boiled you down too much and was worried there wouldn’t be enough of you to fill the container.”<br />
<br />
“So? I’d be smaller. Like it would matter. You came into me because you were horny and get off on fucking with me when I’m helpless. And why taste me?”<br />
<br />
“That actually wasn’t me. Someone walked in on me when I was boiling you out of my sheets.”<br />
<br />
“And you didn’t stop them?”<br />
<br />
“No.” <br />
<br />
Silence fills the air between them. Chase sighs and sets Ty down on his dresser so he can use both hands to clean up the plastic shards. Ty remains quiet for a while, but eventually speaks up.<br />
<br />
“I like having sex with you. I like how you hold me and make me feel, usually. What I don’t like is being stuck as a useless plaything and being scared for my life and being ignored as if I’m not even a human.” <br />
<br />
“You like having sex with me.” Chase repeats, perking up. He turns back to the cube, looking at its lips, since that’s the side facing him. He would be lying if he said he hadn’t been thinking of mouth fucking Ty all day. Better yet, he wants to see if he can push his cock out of the other end, and just keep the boy impaled for the rest of the day. Maybe even sleep with him on as a cocksleeve. It was as if he didn’t hear a single other thing Ty had said. Chade is glad he can’t see how he already sports a har on. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, I do. I’ve never really been pampered like that before. Like yeah, I’ve been with girls, but they always just want you to fuck them. Like, I’ve never been fucked. And I like it.”<br />
<br />
“You’ve never bottomed, or been a sub. But you can have that with me.”<br />
<br />
Ty is quiet in contemplation. Chase approaches him and picks him up to bring him towards his face. Time for some more convincing.<br />
<br />
“Cmon, admit it, you like when I take control.” His breaths against one his eyes, which closes in the wake of his hot breath. He can feel Ty shiver in his hands, and brings one to cover his backside, where his exposed asshole is. “Bet you’d like to call me daddy, too.” <br />
<br />
To anyone other than a young man their age, Chase would’ve sounded ridiculous. But this was Ty’s first gay encounter. And when someone is easily ten times your size, holding your compressed form in their hands, caressing it, making your entire body vibrate with the feel of their deeper voice and the heat of their quick breaths…well, it feels a little less absurd. Enough that Ty’s flattened and bent cock pulses. <br />
<br />
Chase feels this and chuckles, lifting the cube up to see how the member tries to fill. It begins to reinflate, still semi flat and upturned at a sharp, unnatural angle. His balls similarly thicken. Chase fully tips Ty over and begins to kiss and suckle at them, helping to nurse them back into three dimensions. Ty belts out a moan, almost sounding as if he’s in pain. With his hands, Chase presses his fingers around Ty’s little pink rosebud, using his tongue to stimulate and lick all along his balls and shaft, and delivering pecks to his head and lips.<br />
<br />
Ty can’t help but whimper in need. He opens his mouth to speak, to ask Chase to wait so they can talk more, but his lips are captured in a violent kiss. Chase pushes his tongue into Ty, and catches his lips between his teeth to nibble on. He’s rendered totally helpless, feeling as if he’s melting all over again. Chase savors every stifled groan as if he’s feeding off of them, only pulling back to see how flush the cube has become, how it trembles and how it’s eyes flutter as he plays with it. <br />
<br />
He’s wavered back and forth between keeping Ty, tried to convince him to go back to his family, fantasized about keeping the reduced boy his own dirty little secret, locked away in a door. He’s still so unsure about it all, but right now he wants nothing more than to see how much of his cock Ty can take. <br />
<br />
He lays on his bed and brings the still gasping boy down to his crotch and presses its pretty lips against his tip. Ty shuts his mouth in protest but Chase simply presses until those lips give way, and his cock pushes through into his slick, hot mouth. Despite himself Ty begins to suck and lick like his life depends on it. <br />
<br />
But Chase keeps pushing, past his tongue, and down his throat. Ty’s fish like eyes wretch open in shock as he feels an intense pressure against his backside. Without much warning, Chase’s cock bursts through his muscle ring, and exits out of his stretched asshole. All of his pleasure instantly explodes into pain as his rosebud is introduced to something much thicker than it’s ever been able to swallow. Chase moans as he feels it twitching wildly around his shaft, and looks down to see his new fleshlight shaking like a leaf. <br />
<br />
“Shh, easy baby. You took it like a champ, you did so good. Just sit and try and relax and let me stretch you out, huh? I told you you’d like it. Let daddy take care of you.” Chase murmurs as he pets the little thing, then takes a tighter hold of it and begins sliding it up and down himself. Ty is drooling so uncontrollably that torrents of it spill forth on each pump, and push down his throat and out his ass with each time Chase pokes through it. He’s vibrating with choked words as well, making the process all the much more pleasurable .<br />
<br />
When Chase feels he’s about to cum, he pulls back into Ty so that he can coat his insides. Less mess to clean up, through his sheets are fairly drenched with Ty-spit. <br />
<br />
As he shoots into the cube, he sees its penis and balls finally spring to life, as if filling with his own spunk. <br />
<br />
Chase falls back against his headboard, drenched in sweat, completely spent. He leaves Ty stuck on him for a few moments while he catches his breath, his newly three dimensional dick a bit bent, rather painfully, as it’s pressed into the mattress below.<br />
<br />
Chases’s erection gone, Ty is lowered further and further onto the bed until Chase rescues him and places him on his chest. He smiles down at the panting little cube and pets it.<br />
<br />
“You did so good. Now it’s your turn little guy. You ready?”<br />
<br />
Ty just shut his eyes and hummed out what sounded like gibberish. Chase cooed and clutched his toy close to kiss as it all over, peppering ‘mwuahs!’ about indiscriminately. He lifts it up and sees its rather pendulous balls, and a healthy sized dick hanging heavily, swaying too and from when Chase gives Ty a slight shake. <br />
<br />
“Bottoms up!” He says, and throws his head back to deep throat his tiny lover. He has to immediately shove his fingers into Ty’s mouth because the boy lets out a near scream. He keeps them in there, muffling his cries as he proceeds to gargle his dick and balls. Ty sucks on his fingers and squirms so hard that Chase actually has to hold him still— using his thumbs as a pacifier and then the rest of his hands to curve back around to his ass. They dive in and keep it stretched to a gape, exploring inside and looking for a nice, sweet spot. <br />
<br />
Chase had never milked a prostate before, but he figured now is good a time as any to learn. <br />
<br />
They stay like that for what seems like an eternity— Chase only pausing to catch his breath and crack his knuckles (his fingers even becoming pruned inside Ty’s wet insides), and then returning to pleasuring his ‘friend’. <br />
<br />
Ty came four separate times, which he didn’t know was possible. By the time it was over, he was completely drenched in sweat, his mouth was parched, and he was more tired than he can ever remember being. He thinks he may have even blacked out for some of it. Chase sets him down on the pillow and brings a bottle to his chapped, raw lips. Ty licks at the rim like a cat drinking cream. Chase then carries him to the sink and fills it with warm water, and bathes Ty, even washing out his asshole, and cleaning his foreskin. He pats him dry and covers him in lotion, massaging it into his supple skin, and then wrapping him up in a toque and setting him back on the bed. <br />
<br />
“Be right back sweet cheeks.” Chase leans over and kisses his pointed head. Ty instantly dozes off, but is awakened by the feeling of a spoon pushing in between his lips. Ty wriggles and lets out a scared yelp, but Chase shushes and pets him, calming the little, exhausted cube. He tastes oatmeal, and realizes he’s actually starving, so Ty laps it up greedily until he’s finished an entire bowl.<br />
<br />
“Taste good?”<br />
<br />
Ty smacks his lips. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, that was the best oatmeal I’ve ever had.”<br />
<br />
“Good. I made it with whole fat milk, and mixed some protein and electrolyte powder into it, along with yeast.” <br />
<br />
That sounds weird, but Ty is too tired to care. He shuts his eyes as Chase readjusts him so he can slide into bed next to him, but then thinks better of it and moves Ty to the beside table.<br />
<br />
“So I don’t flatten you again while you rise.”<br />
<br />
Again, Ty is so beat that he ignores the statement and almost instantly falls back asleep. Chase smiles as his slumbering form as it emits a cute, quiet little snore. He turns off his lamp and turns over to sleep as well.</p>
