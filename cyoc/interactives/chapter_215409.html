<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now that Jeff was permanently Nate’s, he felt like his world was at its lowest point. Jeff had his brother’s big heavy cock pushing against, the cum filling him and the jerking off stretching him even more. As Nate kept getting hard on after hard on, Jeff’s clothy material felt more and more strained. Although Jeff was meant to be a jockstrap for Nate, he was clearly way too small for his brother’s monstrous cock that was pushing against him. Jeff was unsure how much more he could take of his brother’s rock hard cock poking against him.<br />
<br />
Nate laid down in his bed, still wearing Jeff. Since he still had some time before practice, he figured he’d break in Jeff a bit more, along with breaking his mind, so what better way than jerking off in his poor jockstrap brother. Nate pulled out his phone and searched up some porn, his cock immediately began rising hard as the thought of jerking off in his brother was enough alone to get him going. Jeff on the other hand was not having the same amount of joy, his brother’s large hard cock was once again straining his fibers, precum already starting to leak from his brother’s tip. Jeff wanted to scream, not just at the fact that this situation was happening, or the fact that he permanently stuck like this, but the fact that as his brother began jerking off inside, his pulling of the cloth strained Jeff’s jockstrap body to its limit. <br />
<br />
As Nate was getting closer and closer to his climax, something he didn’t expect happened. Jeff’s straps that wrapped Nate’s body snapped. Jeff’s body completely ripped, the pain searing through Jeff as it felt like his arms got snapped off. Nate pulled Jeff off his still hard cock, the string of precum pulling with Jeff. Nate stood up out of bed, holding the now piece of cloth that was Jeff up to his face. <br />
<br />
“Aww, what happened Jeff?” Nate asked his brother. He didn’t sound sincere or concerned, more so he was mocking Jeff. “Was my dick too big and hard for you?” Obviously Jeff could respond, but even if he could he wasn’t even sure he’d be able to as he was still coming down from the pain of straps snapping, he felt exhausted and numb. “Look at you Jeff, you’re not even a jockstrap anymore, you’re only the…front part.” Nate held Jeff up to a mirror so he could see for himself. Sure enough, Jeff was nothing but the front part of a cloth jockstrap, along with a few stains from Nate’s earlier enjoyment. Jeff thought this was bad enough, but what Nate said next really made it sink in with Jeff.<br />
<br />
“The worst part is, not that you’re not whole, I don’t even think anything could turn you back if anyone wanted to.” Hearing this, Jeff’s cloth heart sank. His brother was right, even though Nate made the change last permanently, this meant there was no way anyone or anything could change him back.<br />
<br />
“The question is now, what do I do with you?” Nate continued to speak. “Obviously I can’t just throw my brother away. I mean sure, I was going to have you tightly hugging my large musky cock and force you to absorb my cum and sweat for all of eternity, but I’m not a monster!” Nate continued to hold Jeff up to his face, examining him. The pondering silence made Jeff scared, even though he doubted it, he hoped his brother would just leave him be, but of course fate had more plans for him. As Nate kept examining his cloth brother, the cum that stained Jeff gave his brother an idea. <br />
<br />
“Ya know, even though I can’t wear you anymore, that doesn’t mean I still can’t make you absorb my cum, you do kinda look like a rag now.” Nate said. Jeff wanted to scream. Of course, just when Jeff thought he could catch a break, he was going to be a little a cum rag for his brother’s large cock. It was like nothing changed. Nate laid Jeff out on his bed and pulled his phone back out with the porn still playing. Nate leaned over the bed, his dick rubbing against Jeff. Jeff could do nothing but lay there and look up as his large brother flopped on top of him, his hard cock landing right on Jeff’s face, making him taste his brother’s cock along with his precum once again. Nate began grinding back and forth against Jeff as though he was humping a pillow. The warm cock on Jeff’s face felt nauseating. It was all so much for the poor boy, everything was like a rollercoaster, jumping from one horrible thing to another, now here he was: an unmoving, stained cum rag being humped by his brother for the rest of eternity. The slick precum lathered Jeff up more and more, making him more pleasurable to Nate who was lost in his porno. As the big cock grinded back and forth across Jeff, it wasn’t long until Nate’s dick began twitching. <br />
<br />
Nate bucked his legs back, pulling his dick off of Jeff. Nate grabbed his dick, pointing it at Jeff and stroking his cock. Jeff could do nothing but look up at and only see his brother’s cock hole as Nate pumped his dick. Finally it happened and Nate shot a warm rope of cum into Jeff. To Jeff, it felt like his brother just shot a rope of cum across his face, the warm fluid immediately absorbing into Jeff’s rag body. Then Nate came again, and again, and again. Cum shot after cum shot flooded Jeff, covering him in the stick white fluid and making Jeff feel like he was choking on it. <br />
<br />
Nate just laid there for a minute basking in the afterglow, his cock laying against Jeff. Finally he got out of bed, grabbing Jeff and rubbing him against the tip of his cock to get the remaining bit of cum stuck to his tip. Nate looked at his brother, the former jockstrap was now nothing but a cum soaked rag. Nate wanted to remember this day forever, so he closed the porn on his phone and took a photo of his cum rag brother. “Oh man, you are such a soaked rag.” To Jeff it felt more dehumanizing to be just called a rag.<br />
<br />
“Nate! It’s time for practice, hurry up and don’t forget your jockstrap!” The boy&#39;s mother called from downstairs. Nate looked back at his rag brother and curled him into a ball, squeezing the cum into Jeff more.<br />
<br />
“Well now my personal rag, what do I do with you?” Nate asked ominously.</p>
