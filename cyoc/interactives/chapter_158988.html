<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Soccer Practice came and went and Enrique was pretty excited to get going to the date with Officer Brandt. As far as he knew, he&#39;d dated quite a few beautiful women and handsome men, but few in the latter category had the kind of looks he saw in the police officer. Enrique took out first his own phone, then that odd, transformational phone he had confiscated from that student, and made sure he could access the student&#39;s phone. He&#39;d give it back...eventually. Enrique just wondered if that student had ever used it for something like this.<br />
<br />
Waiting in the parking lot, Enrique looked at the transformational phone and checked some of the data he&#39;d taken while he was at practice. He never knew Zeke from the team was 30.275% African American, though that did explain the naturally bronzed tan his athlete had, nor did he know Zeke was mostly straight, but had a substantial exception for muscular guys. People never said a lot of these things, but now that Enrique knew them, he...still respected his students.<br />
<br />
He watched as a car drove up and Brian, now in plain clothes, poked his head out the window as it went down, &quot;Hey man, how&#39;d practice go?&quot; Gesturing for him to come on over, Enrique went on and around, getting into the passenger side door.<br />
<br />
As he buckled in, he said, &quot;Well, Zeke performed pretty well today, and everyone was on top of their game, even teamwork wise. You know how teenage boys can get with competition...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah...&quot; Brian said as they started to drive off. As they passed a car full of rather attractive young women obviously on vacation, driving with the hood of their sports car down, Brian and Enrique both looked at them for a moment...<br />
<br />
And then when a group of college athletes walked by on their way to visit their old alum walked down the street, Brian and Enrique looked at those as well. Such were the perks of bisexuality.<br />
<br />
Enrique commented, &quot;Well, I take it from that you&#39;re...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bisexual? Yeah.&quot; Brian started, and decided to compare notes, &quot;Since when did you uhh, know? I mean, I knew since I was in high school. Everyone else wanted to fuck either Grady the QB or Melissa, the cheerleader. Me? I wanted em both.&quot;<br />
<br />
As they stopped at a light, both of them fistbumped, and then Enrique started his story. &quot;Me, I kinda always knew I was queer. I crushed on girls one week, guys the next, and I just didn&#39;t get it I could like both. So I kinda beat myself up over it. Family didn&#39;t help much. Took a pretty binary look at it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian nodded, &quot;Well, now you&#39;re your own man, and we&#39;re free to do as we want. It&#39;s 2020, babe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before long, they sorted out what restaurant they wanted to go to, namely, a barbeque place called Kincaid&#39;s Place. It was a pretty nice place, excellent ribs and burgers, and both had been there before. As Brian drove there, the two of them shared a few more stories. Like how Brian got into bodybuilding when he dated the hunky tight end on the Football Team, who introduced him to lifting simply to look good aesthetically, and Enrique&#39;s first date and trying to explain his bisexuality to her.<br />
<br />
As the two guys got there and left the car, Brian stretched and Enrique likewise tried to get his muscles moving after sitting down for so long. Deciding to just hold hands for now, the two of them went into Kincaid&#39;s Place;<br />
<br />
It was a lovely place, artistic smooth carved wood tables and large benches and chairs, together with slightly dimmed lights produced a nifty atmosphere. And as the waitress brought them to a table, she asked, &quot;What&#39;s the occasion, you lovely gentlemen?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian answered, &quot;First date. We&#39;ve both been here before, and thought it&#39;d be the best place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh congratulations, gentlemen!&quot; She answered, &quot;Happy hour&#39;s in about thirty minutes, and we have a special today on ribs. Can I get you any drinks?&quot;<br />
<br />
Enrique ordered a lemonade and a water, while Brian ordered just water with no ice - owing to his bodybuilding, Brian did not make a habit of drinking much if anything. As they sat there and waited for the menus, the restaurant seemed to fill up somewhat, more people showing up, including rather rowdy college kids.<br />
<br />
When they got their orders in for food, coincidentally it would be about when Happy Hour would begin that they&#39;d get their appetizers. And true to form, when the alcohol started to flow, some of the college students started to get a little too rowdy. Brian visibly rolled his eyes, never had he been more happy that he didn&#39;t drink any more. The bar table area was getting pretty loud, and even the bartender seemed to get in on it at several points.<br />
<br />
As the waitress got them their appetizers, Enrique looked over at some of the chief offenders...<br />
<br />
He discretely scanned them with the transformative phone, the Chronivac reading their information;<br />
<br />
Bret Walsh, a big, heavy guy who played linebacker for a local college. Bret was something of a preppy, but rather than shy away from confrontational sports, he enjoyed every moment of them. He had a buzzed haircut, was something like 310 lbs at six foot five, and could be described build wise as half muscle half fat. It took specially ordered clothes just to fit him. He wore a huge jacket, a tank top, jeans and sneaker shoes. At present he was being a total sex pest and slapped another waitress&#39; ass.<br />
<br />
Julian Harth was more or less a local playboy, also involved at college. He was just as much of a sex pest as Bret, but had the opposite kind of build, a very lean, very muscular build that he was adamant the ladies loved. Slick, jet black hair on his head and almond colored eyes, Julian was popular, but he was never happy with what he had. He wore a leather jacket, a button up deliberately tight on him and only half buttoned up, slacks, and boots.<br />
<br />
And then there was Erick Young, the best friend of Bret, another football player and a similarly heavy drinker. Erick was not quite as big as Bret, and while he was still somewhat chubby, he was much more muscular and toned than Bret was, owing to a more comprehensive gym routine. Erick was tall and somewhat pale surprisingly, with a mop of straw blond hair on his head, baby blue eyes, and a striking looking lack of body hair. The device said Erick was crushing heavily on Bret, and apparently even though he had a girlfriend, their relationship was &quot;strained&quot;. Not gay, but definitely not straight either, though not quite bi. Maybe straight with one huge exception?<br />
<br />
Enrique excused himself to the rest room to go ahead and see what he could do about these college bros, as they were making quite a ruckus. Brian - none the wiser - let him go while he dug into the shrimp on his plate. Looking down at the device once Enrique was in the restroom, he...</p>
