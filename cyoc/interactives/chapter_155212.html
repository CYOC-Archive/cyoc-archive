<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Shit-&quot; Eli swore to himself as he let out one final grunt to get his last rep of squats.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck&quot; He mumbled between breaths. Now 34, Coach Eli realized he not only felt like he had the energy to spare to lift weights again, but also realized his knee was somehow feeling better, allowing him to pull off the heavy set of squats he just finished.<br />
<br />
Eli rolled up the legs of his shorts and flexed his quads, watching as each of the heads exploded into definition. He lifted his shirt and flexed his core. He noted that his abs still weren&#39;t quite visible, but hell, with as good as he&#39;d been feeling he didn&#39;t even really care.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, looking good, coach!&quot; Eli turned and saw his running back, Tyler. Or he was pretty sure it was Tyler. It was definitely Tyler&#39;s face but his body was jacked up like Coach had never seen. He was looking more like a bodybuilder than a high school football player.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tyler? Is that you? Damn, son. You&#39;re looking pretty good yourself. I hope you&#39;re not, uh, on anything,&quot; Eli commented, finding Tyler&#39;s sudden growth somewhat strange, but less so given Gary&#39;s change and his own which was distracting him from much of anything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Naw, coach. This is all natural,&quot; Tyler said as he raised his arm and flexed, showing off a thick bicep that was at least the size of a baseball. &quot;Just passed 200 lbs this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Coach Eli&#39;s eye&#39;s grew like saucers. &quot;200?&quot; He said incredulously. &quot;Well dang, I might just have to move you up to first string, especially if your improvements at practice keep up.<br />
<br />
Eli then noticed another student awkwardly shifting behind Tyler, uncomfortably pulling on his clothes like they didn&#39;t quite fit right. Eli could tell the teenager had a good strong build nonetheless and raised an eyebrow at the notion that a high school boy with a body like that would be so shy about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s your friend?&quot; Eli asked Tyler.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coach? Its me, Pete&quot; The mystery teen piped up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pete? You mean Pete Sanderson? Pete my kicker on the football team?&quot; Eli said, growing more disbelieving as he continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, coach its me.&quot; Pete said as he nervously averted his gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well hell. I know you always had trouble putting on weight. Finally found a workout plan that works?&quot; Eli was ecstatic that his smallest player was finally putting on size. So happy he gave no thought to how strange it was for anyone to put on over 50 lbs of muscle in just over a week.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, uh, something like that.&quot; Pete tugged on his workout shirt which was looking about a size too small. It hugged his newly developed pecs which had never protruded this much from his chest before. Each sinew and muscle fiber visibly flexed and writhed as his arm moved about pulling on the bottom of his shirt. With no bodyfat (or muscle) to begin with, his new muscular development made his skin look vacuum sealed to his every muscle fiber.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Eli said, his tone softening a bit from his usual brash enthusiasm. &quot;It looks good. You should be proud of your accomplishment. I&#39;ve definitely been seeing improvement on the field, if that counts for anything.<br />
<br />
Pete met his coach&#39;s eyes and a small smile crept across his lips as he mumbled a thanks to Coach Eli.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I gotta get home,&quot; Eli said as he stood up from the bench he&#39;d taken a seat on. Strangely, Tyler and Pete seemed to be just a little taller than him, which Eli didn&#39;t remember being the case. Maybe the floor was just uneven.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two keep up the good work.&quot; Eli said as he passed them. &quot;Hope they don&#39;t end up like Gary...&quot; He thought to himself.<br />
_______________________________<br />
&quot;Wait, Ellenore, please&quot; Eli begged his wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eli, no. This is all just too much. You&#39;ve been all over me for the past week and a half. At first I appreciated the attention but...&quot; Ellenore bit her lip in a mix of sexual arousal and frustration. &quot;its just.. too much&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But can&#39;t we work something out? I can change!&quot; Eli pleaded as she made her way to the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the thing, Eli. You&#39;ve changed. I don&#39;t know what procedures you&#39;ve been getting done or what drugs you&#39;re on or, or... or whatever, but its, its really freaking me out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ellenore stared at Eli like she was looking at a stranger. He looked more like when they met, sure, but Eli was never this overbearingly sexual or obsessed with working out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eli...&quot; Ellenore started but faltered. At length she continued, &quot;I&#39;m going to go stay with my sister for a while. Please, please figure out what&#39;s going on with yourself. Get some therapy, see an endocrinologist. I really don&#39;t know. But I need some time apart.<br />
<br />
Ellenore held her tears in just long enough to close the door.<br />
<br />
Eli stood in silence inside his now uncomfortably empty house. He made his way to the bathroom and stared at himself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
Had he changed that much? He was feeling so good, so energetic, lately that he hadn&#39;t given it much thought.<br />
<br />
Eli, now 31, leaned into the mirror and ran a hand through his thick brown hair. He didn&#39;t even have to dye the gray out. It seemed to just disappear. His skin had regained its elasticity. In fact, most of the lines on his face were gone. Whatever was happening he liked it. But Ellenore...<br />
<br />
He stepped back and looked at his body. He felt a vitality and energy like he hadn&#39;t since his early 30&#39;s and he had funneled it all into working out. Well, working out and fucking Ellenore. Until today that is.<br />
<br />
Eli tried to rid his head of such depressing thoughts and tried to focus on his gym progress. He might&#39;ve felt and looked 30 again, but he had to admit he was never this ripped in his 30&#39;s. He pulled up his shirt and admired his 6 pack. He hadn&#39;t had a 6 pack since college, but here he was at &quot;42&quot; (42 as far as he could remember anyways) with abs again. There was still just a bit of fat lingering around on his body, but hell, he wasn&#39;t going to complain. He&#39;d been dropping fat and putting on muscle like crazy lately anyways. And he heard how the students and teachers alike were abuzz with gossip about his recent transformation. The teachers looked at him with envy that he was able to improve his looks and health so much more than they ever could hope to. And students whispered among themselves about how hot Mr. Bramden was. And really he couldn&#39;t blame them. Even in the button down shirts he had to wear as part of the school&#39;s dress code, his massive frame was hard to hide. No matter what he did his pecs, shoulders, and arms pressed against the thin fabric of the shirt. His pants had to be tailored to fit his glutes and his thighs, and they were getting tight again, in fact.<br />
<br />
The thought of outgrowing his clothes (again) had him hard in no time, and before he realized it he was jacking his impressive cock. It hadn&#39;t gotten any bigger through the ordeal, but it sure demanded a lot of attention. He could hardly keep himself sated. A problem that reared its ugly head with Ellenore. A brief moment of regret washed over him but the next stroke of his cock replaced it with pleasure anew. Fuck Ellenore. If she can&#39;t handle him then he&#39;ll find someone (or more than one) who can.<br />
<br />
Before much longer, Eli was over the edge and came, shooting his load onto the bathroom mirror and the sink. With his youth also returned his virility and increased cum production, and it showed.<br />
<br />
As Eli breathed heavily and came down from what was almost definitely not going to be his last orgasm of the day, he thought of another rumor he&#39;d heard among the whispers at school, this time about Gary. <br />
<br />
He heard that Gary was growing again, to the point that people were getting scared. Teachers worried about controlling what they deemed &quot;a monster&quot; and the other students worried about being crushed by him.<br />
<br />
Whatever it was, Eli hoped it was for the better. He wanted his star player back. But if not, hell, maybe he could play on the team, he thought as he flexed a bulging arm before heading to the gym to keep up his gains.<br />
_______________________<br />
&quot;Good work at practice today&quot; Eli said as he slapped the expansive back of his new first string running back. <br />
<br />
Tyler looked down at Coach Eli despite them both of them standing and said, &quot;Thanks coach&quot;<br />
<br />
Eli had moved him up to first string as of this practice. The teen was build like a pro bodybuilder and his football game was better than ever.<br />
<br />
After a while Pete had hit his stride and Eli made him a wide receiver. His speed on the field was a great advantage and his extra size did little to slow him down.<br />
<br />
Eli wasn&#39;t to be outdone by either of them though. He kept working out and he found himself weighing in at 264 lbs of pure muscle. He even dropped what bit of fat was left on his body so every bit of him was striated and vascular. Not quite like Pete who was at this point almost freakily vascular despite eating everything in sight. But Eli had an edge on Tyler and had the whole team beat on size.<br />
<br />
Not only that but those last few wrinkles and aches had all but completely disappeared. If he didn&#39;t know any better, he&#39;d mistake himself for someone fresh out of college. Little did he realize he actually was 28 now at the end of his 2 weeks of regression.<br />
<br />
He even found himself out doing some of the drills with the team, partly to show them how its done, but partly because he found himself wanting to treat his students more like peers.<br />
<br />
As the last few team members filtered out of the locker room, the massive 28 year old bodybuilder football coach went to his office to finish up some paperwork, but it wasn&#39;t long before he heard heavy, pounding footfalls approaching form the hallway.<br />
<br />
A heavy knock fell on his door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coach Eli?&quot; A wall-shakingly deep voice reverberated from behind the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come in&quot; Eli said, wondering who on earth could be wanting to see him.<br />
<br />
As the door open, the most massive form he&#39;d ever seen entered his office. This muscle monster not only had to duck his head but also turn to the side to fit through, and even then his pecs almost got stuck in the door frame.<br />
<br />
Once the behemoth got himself fully inside the room, Eli saw the face attached to the humongous body and after a moment, recognition swept his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit, Gary?&quot; Eli exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, coach. I leaned down like you said.&quot; Gary responded with a cocky smile. He flexed a bicep that looked so large he shouldn&#39;t even be able to bend his arm, but he still managed it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like hell you did. You&#39;re huge! What did you do?&quot; Eli said picking his jaw up off the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Diet and exercise. The usual&quot; Gary said nonchalantly. He shrugged his basketball sized shoulders and the sound of the seams of his shirt giving in filled the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess i need a bigger shirt&quot; Gary said like he was commenting on the weather rather than the feat of ripping out of his shirt without even trying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or maybe a football jersey&quot; Gary suggested, looking straight at coach Eli.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re saying you want your spot back.&quot; Eli said expectantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re saying you don&#39;t want this on your team?&quot; Gary said before pulling a most muscular pose that decimated his shirt, revealing an inhumanly large torso. Each one of Gary&#39;s immense pecs was almost two of Eli&#39;s and they protruded out so far that not only could Gary not see over them, he likely would have trouble even bending his neck down. His abs bowed out but with solid muscle like an armored tortoise shell on his stomach, and his legs were so immense that his feet would likely never be able to meet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all&quot; Eli said, feeling the slightest bit intimidated despite his own impressive size. He also felt something else. The feeling of his manhood stirring in his pants. Was he getting turned on by Gary&#39;s show of inhumanly large muscles? Not that he&#39;d never experimented, but Eli always found himself more attracted to women. That said, since Ellenore went to stay with her sister, Eli was getting a little tired of his hand.<br />
<br />
Coach Eli snapped himself out of his musings and told Gary &quot;We might have to get one custom made for you though&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine by me&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that Gary was back on the team. Their next game was won in a landslide. Between Tyler, Pete and now Gary, the other team never stood a chance.<br />
<br />
As happy as Gary was with his new status back at the top of the football team, he was wondering if he should change something else.</p>
