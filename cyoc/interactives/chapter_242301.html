<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aidan was jolted awake his mind reeling last nights dreams. He had been at the camp for going on 5 days now and never did the waking up get easier. He rested a second before climbing out of the top bunk his hands over his morning wood he ran quickly to the bathroom to pee. Climbing out they ate breakfast and now was the time you took a shower if you needed too. And he took one everyday, the showers were private stalls but all the boys stripped off in the lockers first which Aidan loved as he got to see all the boys privates temporarily and it was exciting but he could never stay long because he would get hard so fast so he alway ran off to the showers as fast as he could. He had never seen Joshua there before until today for just a second he saw Josh’s dark cock out of the corner of his eye causing his to twitch and him quickly step into the stall the whole time covering himself with his undies he hung on the wall. Beginning to wash himself he stood erect the whole time and wanted to stroke it but couldn’t because he didn’t feel comfortable enough there was a huge gap under the door and he had never touched himself like that before and had it feel good, only his butt. <br />
So he once again had to focus to lose his erection which was hard even the water was making it feel good but eventually he succeeded turning the water to cold and he got into his undies and went back outside to the lockers where he changed back into his pants, noting Josh probably already left back for the dorms as his stuff was no longer there. Following suit Josh was in his house but not his room his room consisted of him, Toby, jack, and Tim jack was overweight but cool, Tim was weird and always to himself but very smart. And then there was Toby and Aidan who were best friends the whole time from the start. Aidan freaked out when he noticed blood on the tp as he was wiping after a bowel movement, but soon remember his new uterus and how it had only been just now about a month since what happened happened and he injected himself with Traes semen. He didn’t like this part he thought. But realized he had had no cramps and thought that was due to the testosterone his body already produced. In a few days it was over, as Aidan woke up on this Thursday, he peered over his banister at some heavy breathing coming from Toby’s cot. No one else was awake and jack was snoring loudly as usual and Tim was fast asleep. Aidan realized Toby was in heat and was having a wet dream, it didn’t take long before there was a sizable knot visibly swollen in his sheath through his boxers (for some reason everyone was forced to sleep in only underwear. ) and just a few more seconds passed and pink was clearly visible sticking out of his waistband. It throbbed along to his breath. And grew and grew. At first Toby had pre cum jut out onto his cream colored belly fur. Then a little more, then again a little more but then he rolled over, making Aidan quietly sigh from disappointment but then Toby began to hump the bed even letting out cute little growling noises thank goodness no one else woke up. Then he stood still and adjusted his legs a little the top base of his tail was pulsing rhythmically and did so for some time. He had gotten off that much was sure and sure as hell turned Aidan on. But he couldn’t say anything. Or go back to sleep what he saw excited him too much and he also now had a raging hard on. In about 20 minutes Toby woke up with a grunt and a quiet oh no, I was so worried. And changed the sheets himself throwing the old ones in the hamper. And getting a change of boxers. Another 10 mins and it was 5am and the whistles went off. Aidan had to get out of bed without anyone seeing his boner. He did so. Got dressed, ate breakfast at the dining area then went fishing with Toby. Not mentioning anything of course. The two acted perfectly normal and got excited with each other again then Toby announced an idea, you want to sneak out and go swimming tonight I brought some of my dads whisky, it’ll be fun he said. Reluctantly Aidan agreed and the two planned packing their beds to look like someone was there. And successfully pulled it off sneaking quietly out the window. Sprinting to the nearby woods Toby looked for a second then sprinted down a trail Aidan struggling to keep up, hey wait up Aidan yelled while whispering, the two running down the trail till they both came to another lakeshore on the other side of the tree ridge line. I had to make sure we wouldn’t get caught. He said as he pulled the bottle of whisky from his backpack smell this he said, and popped the lid. The whisky smelled pungent and sweet but also bitter and limey, he had never smelled whiskey before. But taking a small gulp he shuddered the warmth cascading down his body like fire. A few more sips and he was feeling it. The two talked until Aidan said wait what were we doing here again, I thought we were going to go swimming but we brought no swim trunks I’m in jeans! He exclaimed laughing. Who cares said Toby obviously drunk he stood up and quickly dropped his cargo shorts and underwear, we can skinny dip! Tally ho he yelped as he trotted toward the lakeshore his dangly bits clearly visible beneath his sheath Aidan blushed and felt himself become aroused, this was novel he thought he couldn’t miss out so he turned around and hid himself as he stripped off and walked backwards hiding himself from view from Toby as he got into the water allowing it to conceal his erection. Quickly though Toby wanted to wrestle drunk cumbersome and silly the two payed for quite some time Aidan’s penis went back to normal until he accidentally while wrestling touched the tip of Toby’s sheath to which Toby didn’t even notice but he felt Toby’s penis slightly exposed and blood one again rushed to his cock where he then had to tell Toby to quit wrestling, Toby was too drunk to notice but rubbed against Aidan’s hard tern prick more than a few times before he actually heard him and quit saying nnyournofunnnanymorrrre I have something else’s that’s fun. And stumbled nude out of the water to grab something from his bag. Hey come on don’t be lame! Toby yelled I can’t get out yet said Aidan why not asked Toby I just can’t he replied knowing his erection would clearly be visible if he came out of the water. Come on I promise I don’t give a shit hell I’m probably to drink to remember anyway toby said just in case your shy or sum. I mean we are both guys here… yeah that’s what I’m afraid of Aidan mumbled to himself, blushing. Aidan took a deep breath and went behind the bush first pulling himself out his fear sobering him up enough to get soft again before rounding the corner Toby was lighting a joint. Toby passed it to Aidan and inhaled his puff bringing him to cough, and Aidan followed suit first time smoking anything he inhaled and coughed big. Soon the two of them were every crossed and stoned sitting looking at the beach, wow the stars are awesome Toby said… yeah they are Aidan could barely make out, Aidan caught his eyes drifting to Toby’s crotch which was still very nude Toby looking upward didn’t seem to mind or notice. His sheath was cream colored like his belly as were his testicles, they hung down in a huge sack that mirrored the size of his girthy fully erect cock Aidan had seen earlier when he had the dream, now the sheath being the only real indication of its size. Toby sighed and his junk shook with his belly. <br />
Aidan felt warmth come over his whole front and stared back at the beach knowingly blushing and knowingly getting hard though there was nothing he could do. Just hoped Toby didn’t notice which didn’t last long. Woah your excited Toby exclaimed right at Aidan I’m sorry I can’t help it it’s just your attractive and I’m high and drunk. Woah I didn’t know you were like that Toby said. Please don’t hate me Aidan almost cried his erection not going down. Hate you… hate you… Toby exclaimed and glanced down twice at his bulge which was now getting bigger too. Aidan noticed and quickly went quiet. A few more moments went by before Aidan worked up the courage to ask, can I touch it? Toby leaned subtly toward him offering as Aidan went to stroke it before he even grabbed it Toby’s cock grew full size the knot still hidden in the sheath. Aidan went down to suck it which made Toby gasp in both surprise and pleasure. Oooh Aidan this is nice he said, Aidan was moving his tongue around the head of his young prick and maneuvering it the perfect way. Aidan was so shy he almost acted like the younger of the pair even if he was a year older. He felt Toby’s cock flex in his mouth and he sucked a little harder making Toby whine. In a very fast second Toby had pulled Aidan up spun him around and reached at his waist band and exposed his ass and balls quickly taking a deep sniff and plunging his foxy muzzle in he began to lick at Aidan’s virgin tail hole making Aidan whine and shake like he never had before his pp fully out of its own little sheath.  Vibrating and trembling due to the sensation. Turning back around Aidan put one hand on his right shoulder and eased his hole straight down onto Toby’s cock which expanded even more once inside him. Toby whined and humped aidan humped back blushing and feeling the most bliss ever, impossible to keep quiet his stifled moans radiated thier whole side of the lake, slick splatting sounds came from Toby’s big balls smacking Aidan’s taint. Aidan’s balls ached. He turned one leg so Toby would hit the target better and boom. Nnnnngggghhhhh his mind was wrapped in bliss. He noticed Toby’s thrusts getting slower and more serious. No don’t cum in me. It’s not like you can get pregnant Toby said ignorantly. No you don’t understand pl… pop something huge just went into Aidan’s tailhole, fuck… I knotted you Aidan… I’m gonna cum. The two wrapped into each other Aidan’s tail wrapping around Toby’s fluffy fox tail. And they squeezed Aidan could feel the canine fox cum enter his snatch at the force it felt like Toby was peeing into him. Spurt after spurt. Ooooohhhhnnnnggghhhh they two moaned and yelled curled up on the beach deeply connected. Aidan could feel Toby’s penis contracting rhythmically and pulse after pulse of thick cum was flowing into him ever time. Aidan came spontaneously onto Toby and the sand. The two turned butt to butt. And Aidan pulled on the knot causing more cum to fill him staying still 30 more seconds went by and he asked Toby are you still cumming it feels like it. Huff huff yeah… Toby said we do for a while huff huff * it takes a lot out of us sometimes. He reached for Aidan’s cock. Aidan whimpered and hissed. Sorry I never touch myself there and I’ve never had anyone else do it. It’s just me. Oh Tony said and blushed Over 20 more minutes and Aidan was beginning to feel nauseous and bloated. He was full but Toby wasn’t done semen covered his rump and his tail and tailhole. Dripping down from where he was tied to his mate. His mates member still twitching occasionally and not looking like he was going down anytime soon. Aidan couldn’t even feel his ass. He felt filled. And almost too full. He burped and a hand covered his mouth. He felt sick and wished it were over. What is this anyway… Aidan asked it’s a part of our body to make sure no semen escapes and our females get pregnant but your not a female so no worries. Aidan gulped… Getting into a gently rocking motion with the penis and knot.  In another ten minutes they both managed to free each other and cuddling for a short while on the beach before washing off in the lake again and drying off before heading back. Aidan put back on his jeans after drying off and his shirt. In the trail back he said I have to use the restroom. And turned off the trail to pee. He instead turned around and tried to push all of Toby’s cum out of him. It kept flowing and flowing for what seemed like decades but only a few minutes. A huge puddle of noticeable liquid remained beneath him. I sure hope not… but I may be screwed…</p>
