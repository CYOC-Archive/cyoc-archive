<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Wait a second,&quot; I said.  &quot;Are they going to recognize me?&quot; I worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;How would they?&quot; Rachel asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wished for everyone to remember me as always being female when I changed this morning!&quot; I remembered. <br />
<br />
Kim sighed.  &quot;So wish them to remember you as a male again, silly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, duh,&quot; I said, as I slapped myself in the forehead.  I quickly made the wish as Kim stated.  &quot;That didn't affect you two, did it?&quot; I asked.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Nope,&quot; Rachel replied cheerily.  &quot;That last wish that did affect us was the only one, because we specified just the next wish you made.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim agreed, &quot;Yea, we've gotten use to that between ourselves, so we're pros at that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; I said.  &quot;Costumes, now.&quot;  We all wished to be dressed only in sexy, silk robes and nothing else.  They were very short, as they barely extended past our asses, and were loose at the top so that a great deal of cleavage could be seen.  &quot;Let's go get them!&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
We ran as fast as we could to the front door.  &quot;Here goes,&quot; Rachel whispered and opened the door.  We were greeted with the site of Steve, Mike and Brad on the other side.  They had all been looking up and down at the house with puzzled expressions.  Brad was the first to notice the door open.  As soon as he saw the three of us behind it, his mouth practically hit the ground.<br />
<br />
Steve and Mike soon fixed their expressions on us as well.  They all seemed to afraid to speak.  Finally Steve managed to say, &quot;Uh, hi.  Is this...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it is,&quot; I said, to cut him off.  &quot;Welcome to Happy Endings!&quot;<br />
<br />
On our way to the house in the car earlier, we had wished that our three &quot;friends&quot; would all have what they believed to be free passes for an afternoon of relaxation at a new massage parlor named Happy Endings.  The way we had wished our little &quot;advertisement&quot; to be printed was such that we knew they'd take the bait even without wishing them to do so.  We did anyway, just to be safe and to make sure they'd all come at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;We, uh...&quot; Steve stammered and cleared his throat, &quot;We got these coupons, I guess they are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel smiled wide and said, &quot;Of course you did.  We only sent them to those we knew would come.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim took over from there.  &quot;Well, don't just stand there, come on in,&quot; she said and beckoned them to enter.  They did so with a bit of hesitation, but the sight we had greeted them with wasn't going to keep these three knuckle headed jocks out of this house.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're getting ready to open soon,&quot; I said.  &quot;But we wanted to make sure we'd get word of mouth going ahead of time.  We want to be successful, so we're sure you'll tell your friends what a great time you had once you're done!&quot;<br />
<br />
This finally broke the ice enough for them to talk freely.  &quot;Oh, I'm looking forward to being done,&quot; Mike said.  He smiled and chortled like a full-blown idiot.  I don't know if he thought that was clever, or that he had a double meaning, but it was typical of his character.<br />
<br />
&quot;So is this just a massage parlor?&quot; Brad asked.  &quot;Or do you do more than that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That all depends,&quot; Kim said.  She teased them, &quot;Why don't we start with that and see what happens?&quot;<br />
<br />
The three guys looked at each other with broad grins on their faces.  Steve turned back to us and said, &quot;My name is Steve, by the way.&quot;  Brad and Mike introduced themselves as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Veronica,&quot; I lied.  &quot;This is Kaitlyn,&quot; I said as I pointed to Rachel, &quot;and this is Anna,&quot; I said as I put my hand on Kim's shoulder.  &quot;Follow us and we'll get started.&quot;<br />
<br />
As we had discussed previously, we silently made wishes that we would be able to hear whatever little jokes they made between themselves, no matter how softly they spoke.  We also made sure we could hear their inner thoughts, just to have no doubts about what they thought they'd receive from us.<br />
<br />
The three of us also turned around quickly so that our robes fluttered up a bit, so they would be able to briefly glimpse our bare asses.  It was all part of our grand plan.  As we started to walk back to the room that Rachel wished was altered to look like a typical massage room, we all started to hear what they were saying and thinking.  It was nothing unexpected, as they commented on how hot we were and as to which one of us they wanted to nail first.  Rachel, Kim and I smiled to ourselves, knowing full well we had them where we wanted.<br />
<br />
We walked back to what had been the kitchen of Rachel's extravagant house.  Now it was a massage room that was completely set up with three beds and everything one might find in a typical massage parlor.  &quot;This is where the magic happens,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, you don't have separate rooms?&quot; Steve asked.<br />
<br />
I sighed to fake disappointment.  &quot;Unfortunately, we're still under some construction and they haven't been finished yet.  We've only got our community rooms ready so far,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
The three guys began to look uneasy and, perhaps, ready to back out of their free session.  Rachel saw this and said, &quot;Oh, now, now, boys.  You guys all look strong, tough, and macho.&quot;  As she said this, she walked up to all of them and ran her fingers over their chests and squeezed their biceps.  <br />
<br />
&quot;And?&quot; Brad asked somewhat impatiently.<br />
<br />
&quot;You must be athletes,&quot; Rachel said, &quot;so you guys must have been in a shower together at some point, right?&quot;  She looked at them so innocent and coy at the same time.  She batted her eyes at them to make them feel both more uneasy and more enticed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, big deal,&quot; said Mike.  &quot;You guys pussies all of a sudden?&quot; he demanded of his friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up, asshole,&quot; Brad snapped.  He turned back to us.  &quot;It's gonna have to do,&quot; he said.  &quot;We came, so we'll do what you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yippee!&quot; Rachel continued to tease.  &quot;Let's get started.&quot;</p>
