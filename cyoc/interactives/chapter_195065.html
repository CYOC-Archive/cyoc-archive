<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">This new reality was very different for Mark. Different position in the family structure, was a student instead of a manager, and was also female instead of male... and really female to boot. Before going to sleep and bathing in the sex afterglow Mark at least thought he still had his own mind. Then when he woke up he didn&#39;t notice all the subtle movements his new female body made, and after his body had picked out a cute set of underwear and flawlessly put them on there was a voice in his head &quot;Nice, cute, and maybe I should wear that skirt.&quot; It was a thought that reminded Mark of her new body&#39;s voice. <br />
&quot;The Heck am I thinking?&quot; he thought<br />
&quot;I am thinking... It&#39;s a Pink V-neck day&quot; the new voice thought. Mark himself was concerned that his mind was being taken over when the voice thought &quot;Ah yes... I am somewhat aware of our situation. I&#39;m Mary, the you of this universe I suppose and I&#39;m here so you don&#39;t mess up our lives.&quot; <br />
&quot;Wait you know-&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes Mark. Someone changed reality a little, and either they wanted you to be able to act normal or the universe thought that I may as well exist to help keep order intact.&quot; Mary thought to Mark. Pragmatically Mark decided to play nicely and go along with things right now. Especially when he didn&#39;t know if there would be a way for him to ever get back to normal. Dustin was having a similar conversation with Dusty although the two were far more synchronized than a teenage girl and a middle aged dad. The bigger issue was what happened with June and Jack last night. <br />
<br />
June in the body of a fat slob figured she probably wasn&#39;t going to be able to make Ty change her back, but she could at least try making things better herself. She started doing what exercise she could and planning out a healthy eating diet, and then felt less of a thought than an emotion. A muted yet all consuming sorrow. <br />
&quot;What&#39;s the point?... Let&#39;s just try to enjoy ourselves...&quot; The thought was masculine and probably came from a time in Jack&#39;s life when he was healthier. <br />
&quot;No! I refuse to be content as this!&quot; June thought. She had gotten a business degree, and the only hurdle came from not enough experience and eventually having succumbed to resigning herself to raising Dustin and eventually Ty she supposed. However with the new mind came some new memories and knowledge. Jack was more than just a senior manager, he was now the owner of the particular chain and... Now was mostly just coasting on what came in while he let the managers manage the store. <br />
&quot;Can we please stop thinking of those things... it hurts...&quot; <br />
&quot;No! Your decisions have left us a sad sack of fat that is failing both in business and family! I was content with just one, but I&#39;m not laying down like this!&quot; June thought as she was struggling to exercise a little as her body had been exceptionally slothful and gluttonous, and it wasn&#39;t even just her body aching but Jack&#39;s mind and heart was making this harder on June as well. <br />
<br />
Back to Mark in the morning as he left for the kitchen as Mary had planned on making some breakfast Mary halted their legs as he saw a sweaty sack of fat sleeping on the floor in the family room. A flash of anger and sadness flashed through Mark as he noticed Mary taking control of them and turn around and walk away. <br />
&quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; Mark thought to Mary. Yeah Jack had been a bit of a lazy jackass as of late, but those emotions felt a bit different. <br />
&quot;Maybe he was different for you, but that... He just gave up after mom died, and the last few years I can&#39;t even stand to be in the same room as him!&quot; A few memory flashes. A younger child version of Mary with a bit of a toddler Dusty all mourning with their father, and a few flashes as their father took more time to himself as he got rounder and rounder. Then more recently with Mary growing more mature... One night when Jack had gotten drunk... Mary had seen her mother in pictures, and they were distinguishable. However for a drunk who still dreadfully missed the love of his life. There were too many memories for the two of them so now Jack and Mary tended to avoid each other. <br />
<br />
Mary knocked on Dusty&#39;s door and asked &quot;Dusty, up and ready?&quot; <br />
The barely teenager said &quot;Yeah Mary, we going out for breakfast again?&quot; <br />
&quot;One of those days.&quot; Mary said. Mary did prefer to have a decent home made breakfast, but with Jack like that she&#39;d just get some takeout and Mary could take Dusty to middle school before she went to her high school. Dustin needed the least explanation of what was going on out of the three Ty had transformed. He remembered the fat lazy father Jack was and his older sister Mary and things weren&#39;t that different to him. He was just younger and a girl, and all Dusty knew was that it was time to give daddy some space. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ty himself smirked. The young man had aged himself into a true young adult who was taking a year to find himself between high school and college. He was currently walking through the park messing with people. He was kinda done turning people into bimbos for sexual gratification. Do it too many times in a row and it gets old. With most of the adults their clothes didn&#39;t become ill fitting enough, and with most of the young children who didn&#39;t need to be in school yet ripped through their clothing leaving them naked which wasn&#39;t great after a night having fucked a woman for hours on end. He experimented with stuff like species, gender, different numbers of limbs, etc, but always returned them back to normal. Reality seemed to like to repair itself and Ty wasn&#39;t interested in having a reality where furries are a somewhat normal thing. Ty would let June and Mark stew in their new positions for a bit before stirring anything up. Maybe he&#39;d let Jack and Mary just take over... Perhaps Ty would go to a 3 Michelin star restaurant for lunch and dinner! Ty had been using his powers to alter people and certain items, but with teleportation and being able to change reservations Ty would be having a good meal no matter what.</p>
