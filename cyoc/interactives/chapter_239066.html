<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On the bus, Jennifer tried to ignore her tight bra. Having her breasts grow from the die was something completely obscene. Kyle had been so calm about it, saying the rules of the change, and she had thought he was a lunatic. Then she had rolled it thinking nothing would come of it. But here she was now, regretting her decision to use the die. <br />
She had it in her pocket now. It was warm in her hand, which clutched it tight. If Kyle was really serious about what he said, that the die could change her in unforeseeable ways, she would have to be careful. She turned it in her hand, feeling the indents of the black numbers beneath her fingers. She wondered what he would have said if it were a six-sided die or its variant that only goes to three. Would he have said something different? And why did he still seem unsure of his rules at the end? Was he planning on &#39;updating&#39; the rules? Jen had so many questions as she stared off into space.<br />
Finally, the noisy bus crawled into the drop-off zone. All students aboard rose and grabbed their bags. Jennifer filed out with them, feeling her breasts bounce as she descended the steps. She emerged into the crowded front park area. Without hesitation, she went straight for the school&#39;s doors. Behind her, Abby watched her older sister disappear inside, curious why Jen was suddenly a bit larger in one area.<br />
Inside, the school was as busy as outside. Teachers chatted as they made their way to their respective classrooms while students hurriedly put book bags and textbooks into their lockers. Jennifer skipped by her locker and continued down the hallway. She had bigger fish to fry, and that fish was Kyle. She knew he had English that morning, not far from her classroom. Approaching the door, she peered in.<br />
If it was Kyle&#39;s class, he was not there. She looked about the room and saw several empty desks. A student walked by the door, and she pulled her over. &quot;Hi, sorry to bug you, is there a Kyle in here?&quot;<br />
The student was a bit annoyed, even if Jen was not trying to make it a problem. &quot;Kyle? Yeah, he and two other kids are out with the flu,&quot; pointing at Kyle&#39;s desk. &quot;Just happened, so maybe he won&#39;t be in for the week. But personally, I think he is lying.&quot;<br />
Jen drew her eyebrow up. &quot;Why&#39;s that?&quot;<br />
The student looked back to make sure no one was listening. &quot;That dude is a fricking loner. But he makes himself one by saying ridiculous things. Yesterday he said he was going to get revenge on someone. And then he gets the flu? I think he&#39;s in huge trouble for something he did, or he&#39;s hiding from it.&quot;<br />
Jennifer&#39;s blood went cold. Kyle was hiding from HER. It was the only reasonable explanation. She didn&#39;t know his address, which meant finding him was going to be a chore. Especially because Kyle was alone and had little contact with other people. This was going to go on for a week, meaning a week without being able to reverse, unless she found him first.<br />
&quot;Thank you, um...?&quot; Jennifer thanked the girl.<br />
&quot;Brit,&quot; said the girl. &quot;Wait, aren&#39;t you Jennifer Thompson? You&#39;re Abby&#39;s sister, right? She is hilarious and cool to hang out with. Does she still do D&D?&quot;<br />
Jennifer shrugged, gripping the D20 in her hand in her pocket. &quot;I don&#39;t know, might have to ask. Thank you very much, Brit.&quot;<br />
&quot;No problem,&quot; Brit replied. &quot;By the way, cute top, but maybe consider a larger bra, that looks like it hurts a little.&quot;<br />
Jennifer blushed before speeding off. Brit looked back with a blush on her own face.<br />
Getting to her classroom, Jennifer sat down as the bell tolled for the start.<br />
&quot;Good morning, class, and welcome to another day of English. Hope you are studying for the exam in one week, as it will account for 20 percent of your final grade. So be on the ball, not on the games... Todd.&quot; The teacher addressed a student near the front, who sheepishly put down his phone.<br />
The day flew by. Before she knew it, Jennifer was in her third block of social studies. They were studying Napolean Bonaparte and his conquests, but Jennifer was sidetracked by her breasts. They were tender in her bra, something she should have considered earlier. It had been a struggle all morning, and now it was making them ache. She could release her boobs from their prison but knew better than to walk around the school sans bra. She did have something that could distract her from the irritation. She reached into her pocket for a pack of gum, pulling on it to free it from the inside mesh. She got it free but felt something else leave her pocket, too.<br />
She watched as the die plummeted to the floor. She had no reaction time as it bounced and rolled. It thankfully stayed within reach. Unfortunately, it had been rolled. She saw nobody take notice of it falling, assuming that no one heard or saw it. She reached down under her desk, and found it had landed on a...</p>
