<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the master bedroom of the Van Direstag things were already becoming rather heated as Richard felt Rose move her hands up and down his erect shaft. It had started with him bringing her home after she was cleared from the hospital after what had happened the previous night regarding Rose being attacked by a Mountain Lion. Rose had gotten all the appropriate shots to treat for things like Rabies, though it appeared that the Mountain Lion was tested earlier in the morning and was not Rabid, but that was something where it probably couldn&#39;t hurt to be safe rather than sorry. There were some moments on the drive back to their home where Richard though he caught a scent of arousal on his wife, but he decided to ignore that, as she was recovering from an animal attack and injuries that had included some bruised ribs, which could take time to heal... particularly when depending on how severe the bruising might be.<br />
<br />
However, once they got home, Rose had asked him to help her up to their room and Richard dutifully did so. It was the least he could do after essentially causing the trouble that had lead to his becoming a werelion and then Rose getting attacked by a mundane Mountain Lion. From there, though, Rose had begun to strip off his clothes, if only to see how much his human form had changed since she&#39;d only seen him naked in his werelion form so far and Richard could understand the curiosity. However, as Rose reached for and began to gently pump his penis, and bringing it to a full erect state, that brought his senses to full alert. He could smell some scent of arousal on Rose, which made him guess that Rose liked what she saw. It also began driving some of his instincts forward in wanting to pleasure her show just how much he loved her. A part of him was well aware of what could happen as her hands ran up and down his penis and a part of him wanted that to happen, but another part was worried over the fact that Rose was recovering from injury and that from what Sheila had told them... weres could be highly fertile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rose...&quot; Richard managed to moan out as he could feel a slight twitch in his penis as she began to pump his penis faster, barely noticing the slight growling edge to it as he moaned her name.<br />
<br />
Rose, meanwhile, was wrestling with some of her own questions at the same time, and in some ways it felt like she was being pulled in two directions. She&#39;d heard Richard&#39;s growling moan as she ran her hands along the long and thick shaft that now pointed at her from between his legs and knew what the consequences of continuing would be. If she brought him to orgasm and she ingested his cum... she&#39;d start her own journey to becoming a were, just as what had happened the previous night when Richard essentially tripped onto Sheila when she came. And while some of Richard&#39;s actions after his transformation was completed had her a bit hesitant when it came to werelions at first, as there was the worry that he might not love her anymore and would prefer other women, like Sheila, who were already weres.<br />
<br />
However, those doubts were greatly eased in her mind when she woke up in the hospital to find that Richard had left Shelia to chase after her and was the one to rescue her from the Mountain Lion and professed his love and loyalty to her. It might mean that Richard might gain something of a &quot;wandering eye&quot; as a werelion, and that she might gain the same if she became a werelioness, but Rose was most comforted that even after his transformation that SHE was the most important thing in Richard&#39;s life and that was enough in many ways. And at present, seeing him naked before her with chiseled and well defined pectorals and abdominal muscles, with a penis that had to be at least ten inches long  and at least half an inch thicker in human form  was enough to put a fair number of thoughts in Rose&#39;s head on that issue. For she knew she&#39;d have to become a were to stay with Richard, anyway, particularly as they weren&#39;t old enough that sex wasn&#39;t unhealthy for them and a part of Rose&#39;s mind figured that if she were to become a were, why not have it be her husband who turns her.<br />
<br />
The only other worrying thing that was there was the fact that she was recovering from an injury. Depending on how badly her ribs had been bruised, that could take weeks to heal from, and while she did feel better that morning and it didn&#39;t hurt as much to breathe, that didn&#39;t mean that Rose had fully healed from those injuries. There was also what Sheila had told her and Richard the night before on how much sex was a part of how normal humans became weres and the potential that if she were to become a were, Rose might immediately go into heat as a were and thus become pregnant after her first time. It might not always happen, but it was surely possible and was something that Shelia had warned them of... but at that time Rose was still in shock from Richard&#39;s transformation and wasn&#39;t focused on the large member pointed at her. It was only when Richard half moaned and half growled her name that she began to shake herself out of feelings of lust that she&#39;d had looking at her husband&#39;s enlarged member.<br />
<br />
&quot;Richard...&quot; Rose said slowly as she looked up to her husband, who&#39;s eyes were fluttering a bit, though her hands continued to slide up and down on his penis feeling its warmth and how hard it was, &quot;are...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love... you…&quot; Richard gave another growling moan as his wife&#39;s hand job finally pulled him over the edge and he erupted with  thick ropes of white cum flying from the tip of his penis and onto his wife&#39;s face. Some of it ran from the bangs of her hair, over one eye, circling around her nose, and with the last of it going into Rose&#39;s open mouth as she said &quot;are.&quot; Relaxing, he looked down again with some relaxing, only to see his wife pulling the cum away and licking it from her fingers. &quot;Rose... I... I didn&#39;t mean to... I&#39;m...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Rose managed as she finished cleaning herself up, &quot;I suppose I kind of asked for it...&quot; She then flashed a smile to Richard as he watched her eyes turn to a bronze/gold color, just like his eyes did in their were form, &quot;but I&#39;d have to become a were anyway... and I&#39;d want the one to do it to be you...&quot;<br />
<br />
She could feel her body growing warm, and she wondered if this was what Richard felt when he first fell onto Sheila. Her arousal, which was growing a bit before she&#39;d started examining and playing with her husband, was growing higher and there seemed to be an added &quot;need&quot; to it now.  She had to pleasure him and be with him as she began to shed her human form. She looked down to one hand to see her fingernails lengthening into a cat&#39;s curved and retractable claws.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I need you,&quot; Rose spoke with her voice shifting onto a more husky tone than it&#39;d had before and looked pleadingly to her husband.<br />
<br />
She let the sandals that Richard had brought to the hospital to slide off her feat as she could feel them lengthen and as light golden tan fur began to grow across her body and she spread her legs, giving Richard an open invitation to what she knew would be coming. And that seemed to be enough as she could see Richard&#39;s form begin to change. His penis grew larger and as a fur lined sheath formed at its base, there were some small spines that began to form. Richard approached the bed as Rose lay back and began to pull down the sweat pants and panties that he&#39;d brought to the hospital so that Rose wouldn&#39;t be leaving the hospital in the dressing gown that they&#39;d given her. As his face began to push forward into its leonine muzzle, he could get a stronger scent of his wife&#39;s growing arousal and how fast it was progressing. However, Richard also knew that Rose was soon going to start growing in size and given her previous injuries it would be wise for her body not to be battling her clothes as well as her own body.<br />
<br />
&quot;My handsome lion,&quot; Rose smiled as she smiled as Richard climbed up onto the bed. His abdominal muscles seemed to vanish behind a loose fold of skin, but given that his were form... his fursona... was based on the Asiatic Lion which was known for that fold of skin that was to be expected. She almost came just from seeing his now larger leonine penis pointed at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;My growing lioness,&quot; Richard answered, the growling edge to his voice prominent as he felt himself shifting and his teeth growing in his  rounded muzzle. He slowly began to ease himself into her, eliciting a growling moan from Rose and that allowed him to carefully lift up the shirt that he&#39;d also brought to the hospital. As he got the shirt up, he could also see as Rose&#39;s biceps now filled the sleeves and were starting to stretch it. He was in an awkward crouch for the moment, as he didn&#39;t want to put his weight on her as that might hurt her ribs, and in the course of that entering thrust, he actually managed to lift Rose&#39;s hips up and he could see Rose&#39;s growing tail stretch out below her with the tassel of fur at its tip being a slightly darker than her hair. He could tell that Rose&#39;s transformation was accelerating and he couldn&#39;t help but give a growling moan as her vaginal stretched and wrapped around his penis.<br />
<br />
&quot;ArrrrrroooooooOOAAAAAAOOOOOO!&quot; Rose felt herself giving a heavy moan as Richard&#39;s thrust lifted her up.<br />
<br />
Part of it was pleasure as her equipment was stretched out by his penis. A part of her feared that he might split her as he assumed his werelion form, but that actually felt quite good. In fact it alleviated some of the pains she was feeling as her body began to put on muscle. Some of the pain was in the injured ankle where her feet had stretched out into a digitigrade length and the rest was in her chest where her bra was starting to constrict around her, and not just her breasts. Getting Richard inside her actually helped alleviate that and she thrust her hips forward, even as her face began to crackle and push forward into a leonine muzzle of her own.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s... betterrrrrr...&quot; Rose managed to pant as she thrust her hips forward and then brought her hands up to the straps on her bra. Realizing on being on her back, the bra&#39;s clasps were not going to be reachable and trying to get the pressure off, she gripped the straps and simply pulled them out until they snapped under her growing strength. That relived a lot of the pain in her chest and she managed to look down to see her cream furred breasts growing larger and larger as the rest of her kept pace with them. It wasn&#39;t long until they matched Sheila&#39;s size and bounced which each thrust that she made to counter Richard&#39;s thrust into her. &quot;Thank you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure?&quot; Richard asked as his thrusts picked up their pace as Rose&#39;s transformation seemed to physically run its course. He changed his position a bit more so that his upper body was resting on his arms and allowing him more leverage to thrust into Rose, who was now giving growling moans to answer his own between breaths and comments.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Rose gave a toothy smile as she massaged her now furry and generous bosom with dark teat-like nipples poking through her fur and also feeling Richard&#39;s penis starting to twitch inside her. Things were starting to feel goad and the driving need that had been going through her was starting to decline, giving her the sense that her transformation was almost complete. And as that happened, both felt that growing pulse of pleasure leading to a mutual orgasm and unleashing a roar as Rose&#39;s vaginal walls squeezed down on Richard&#39;s penis and feeling his spines dig into her inner walls as they climaxed. With that, Richard collapsed and rolled off to a side and lay beside Rose as she looked to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Richard found himself apologizing.<br />
<br />
&quot;For what?&quot; Rose answered, &quot;that actually felt rather good... and to a certain extent with you a were... I&#39;d kind of HAVE to be a were if we were to stay together. Not to mention that it was my fault that I got a bit... curious regarding the new you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... but much of this wouldn&#39;t have happened if I hadn&#39;t gotten so panicked,&quot; Richard said slowly, &quot;if I&#39;d actually taken the time to learn things rather than jumping to decisions. Then we wouldn&#39;t have ended out in the woods. I wouldn&#39;t have tripped onto Shelia... betrayed you and hurt your feelings and then let you get attacked by a mundane Mountain Lion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... but I never stopped loving you,&quot; Rose told him, &quot;and you came after me and saved me from the Mountain Lion. That confirmed you love me more than Shelia... though I suppose we&#39;ll both end up in the same pride now... huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably,&quot; Richard sighed, &quot;as I&#39;ll have things to learn about being a male werelion... and will likely have a more experienced coalition partner to show me the ropes as it were... an Elijah Hunter.  When you&#39;ve recovered... whenever that is... Sheila will probably introduce you to the rest of the females in the specific werelion pride that you and I will likely be assigned to... I still need to talk to to Leon Talbot... and probably the city about what happened. Let them know that what happened last night was an accident and that I&#39;m not out to challenge anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rose slowly nodded as she relaxed a bit, the driving need in her body now relaxed. Coming off the sexual high from the transformation, she could feel a dull ache in her ankle and in her ribs and chest, likely a result of the attack by the Mountain Lion the previous night and now aggravated by her transformation into a were, but she noticed that the pain there was actually even reduced a bit from where it was earlier in the morning. It left her wondering if weres healed faster normal humans. It left a part of her wondering if some of Moon Lake&#39;s population as a cure for disease or injury, but having just become a werelion and not being in the medical field, Rose chose not to dwell on that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;s good,&quot; Rose told him, &quot;as challenging anyone wouldn&#39;t help matters... particularly all the stuff that we have run into.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard nodded and nuzzled his muzzle to Rose&#39;s, and finding himself giving a low rumble in throat, trying to get to as close as what a lion could to purring, which given the difference in vocal chords between big cats and little cats was impossible. Right now, he was most interested in making sure that Rose was okay and wasn&#39;t angry with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re sure you&#39;re okay?&quot; Richard asked to her. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am now,&quot; Rose answered, &quot;in fact I feel a bit better than I did when I got up this morning... Interesting how becoming a Barbary Werelion does that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Barbary?&quot; Richard wondered, &quot;but that lion went extinct...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In the wild, yes,&quot; Rose answered, &quot;but that extinction date was in the mid twentieth century. And given that stories of weres go back as far as Medieval Europe... I&#39;d bet the condition of being a were was there before the Barbary Lion went extinct. Not to mention that some zoos claim to have specimens that would have least some genetic lineage back to the Barbary Lion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm,&quot; Richard managed, and figured he&#39;d learned something there, &quot;may make what our future cubs will be...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cubs...&quot; Rose said slowly and remembering what Sheila had said the previous night about how fertile weres could be and the possibility that becoming a were would send her into heat. It wasn&#39;t something that was guaranteed, but it was likely quite possible, which had been why Sheila had offered to share her birth control pills. She then sighed a bit as she&#39;d never really intended for things to get as far as they did, but a part of her felt glad that she and Richard would be together. &quot;Well... I suppose we&#39;ll need to wait and see if I am pregnant. If I am... it&#39;s nothing we haven&#39;t done before. If not, I&#39;ll need birth control pills.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Along with new clothes,&quot; Richard commented slowly, &quot;both of us well... I was hoping to do that for me while you were resting and after picking up Frank from the college... but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now we&#39;d both need it,&quot; Rose commented and rubbed one breast again. The fur there was soft and it allowed her to feel the softness of the maternal material that was now there. She knew it was much larger than before, putting her on par with Shelia and other werelionesses and that it would be too big for much of what she had to comfortably fit her, even in her human form, similar to how Richard&#39;s clothes looked to be straining to control his human form. &quot;And so we come home only to need to go out again...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Richard said again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be,&quot; Rose answered, &quot;as I said... this was my choice and after you became a were, I&#39;d have to become a were... and in all honesty, I&#39;d prefer the were to turn me to be the man I married... regardless of what kind of were he is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard found himself smiling and then nuzzling his muzzle to Rose&#39;s again.</p>
