<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Miss Mona reviewed the projects. Erica&#39;s change into a tree was ongoing, however the others all appeared to be finished. The class itself was reduced by a little more then half since she had used Taylor as an example, and Daniel had been sent back a grade or 10. <br />
<br />
This was fun, but she wondered if there was a way to get more of the school involved. A mischievous smile spread across her face as she used her magic to reach out. She planted a few seeds of inspiration and waited for them to sprout. <br />
<br />
While she waited for that, she knew she needed to finally address the elephant in the room. Tabbie was sitting in the corner looking more and more traumatized as what was left of Miss Mona&#39;s rationalization spell unraveled. She was quickly coming to her senses, but with everyone insisting this was normal it probably felt more like she was going mad.<br />
<br />
Miss Mona approached her student. &quot;Tabbie, ypu seem to be having some trouble here. Want to talk about it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tabbie seemed hesitant,  and took a moment to choose her words carefully. &quot;I&#39;m just wondering about everyone turning into inanimate objects. Are they going to be all right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course they will be.&quot; She assured her. &quot;However, I am wondering....&quot; she paused for dramatic effect. &quot;Why are you unaffected by my spell?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Spell?&quot; Tabbie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The one that convinces everyone that this is normal. Stripping on front of your classmates to turn into marble, offering yourself to be beaten by bats as a paper mache effigy at your sister&#39;s birthday party, bathing in acid, or even standing in fertilizer for several days. None of this is normal. Normal people would panic. The only reason you&#39;re not running is because everyone else is so calm.&quot; Miss Mona held up her hand. &quot;Don&#39;t freak out now, everyone will just think you&#39;re weird. <br />
<br />
Tabbie looked around nervously. Her classmates were admiring the art that was once fellow students. More then a few were expressing jealousy that they weren&#39;t the ones transformed. &quot;What are you planning?&quot; Tabbie whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just to have my fun.&quot; She told her. &quot;Your teacher needed a break from you and I promised to substitute. Unfortunately you seem to be one of those rare humans who can resist magic. Any spell I place on you will eventually come undone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you aren&#39;t going to do anything to me?&quot; Tabbie asked hopefully. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;m just going to have to do a more complex spell so it will last till after I am gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
All of a sudden Tabbie&#39;s tongue felt like lead. She couldn&#39;t move it and she felt a strange grin force itself on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m sure you will enjoy this.&quot; Miss Mona walked up to the front of the class and Tabbie found herself compelled to follow. Any spell Miss Mona cast may eventually fall apart on Tabbie, but that obviously didn&#39;t keep Miss Mona from exercising some control over her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen up class, I want to say how proud I am of all of you. You have done wonderful with inanimate transformations. I think it&#39;s time to move onto an animate one. Tabbie has volunteered to be our demonstration this time around.&quot;<br />
<br />
What remained of Tabbie&#39;s class applauded, except Erica who&#39;s limbs where too stiff to bring together. She seemed force to keep both arms outstretched on either side. Tabbie found she still could not talk, and was unable to show any signs of disagreement. <br />
<br />
Miss Mona waved her hands above Tabbie, and the world around her slowly grew larger. The class gasped or ahhed. Tabbie&#39;s clothes grew baggy as she shrank. She quickly grabbed her pants to keep them from falling down, but found her fingers were changing too. Each second they became shorter and her grip became harder to keep.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t only her grip she was losing but her balance as well. Tabbie fell forward,  catching herself with her hands as she fell. Her hands looked more like large fleshy paws. Slowly, black fur began to grow on them. All the while Tabbie continued to grow smaller.<br />
<br />
The class stared enraptured as their diminishing classmate&#39;s head retreated within her shirt. The only sign of Tabbie was a lump within her clothes that laid on the floor. That lump continued to shrink for a bit longer. Her pants deflated showing there was nothing of Tabbie there. Finally, the lump stopped shrinking, laying in the center of her shirt.<br />
<br />
Miss Mona lifted the bottom of the shirt and reached in. She withdrew a small tabby cat the mewed in protest. &quot;This lovely tabby cat will be our class pet for the remainder of our unit. As our class pet, I expect each of you to take care of her, and take turns bringing her home. Who would like this week?<br />
<br />
A boy named Josh raised his hand. If Tabbie wasn&#39;t covered in fur, she was sure the whole class would have seen her blush. She had a huge crush, but being the shy nerd who always hung out with a cheerleader, most boys didn&#39;t pay attention to her.<br />
<br />
Now Josh was taking her home. &quot;I love cats.&quot; He said as Miss Mona handed her to him. While every girl would love to be in the arms of her crush, this was very far from what she had in mind. Her heart raced as she tried to think her way out of this. <br />
<br />
Her classmates only saw this as normal, they probably didn&#39;t even think of her as human anymore. Miss Mona said Tabbie&#39;s resistance would make the spell come undone, but how long would that take? Josh was scratching her under her chin and that felt too good to think straight. <br />
<br />
She started to gently purr and rub her face against him. &quot;I think she likes you.&quot; Miss Mona announced. Tabbie was mortified but could not stop her feline instincts. &quot;How about instead of taking shifts, you just hold onto her for now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would live to.&quot; Josh responded. His next words were directed to her. &quot;What about you pretty kitty? Want to come home with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
This was somehow a dream and a nightmare all rolled into one. Tabbie tried to cast a catty glare at Miss Mona to express her displeasure. The substitute must has misread the look because she just mouth &#39;your welcome&#39; in return.<br />
<br />
Miss Mona&#39;s attention was taken away from the new cat as a visitor entered the room. It looked like the next stage of her fun was going to begin sooner than expected.</p>
