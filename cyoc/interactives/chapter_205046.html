<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well if I&#39;m gonna make David respect me, I need to try my best to make it happen&quot; Steve thought as he wondered how he&#39;d go about using this machine. &quot;But how?&quot; As he looked through his options, Steve&#39;s eyes went to the age settings. David was old enough when Steve remarried his mother. Old enough to have too much of a start intellectually to warm up to Steve without something drastic. &quot;But if I made him younger...&quot; It would be like a brand new start. He could raise him right. &quot;In that case...&quot; Steve clicked the age option for David&#39;s profile and set it to six. Six month&#39;s old to be precise. &quot;And that way, his brain can grow up anew into someone who could respect me.&quot; Setting in the age, Steve was brought to a screen that asked a question. &quot;Do you want the World besides you to adjust to the change?&quot; It was worded slightly poorly, but Steve got the jist of it. It was asking if he wanted everyone who could possibly know that David was not the thirteen year old he is now, but the baby he will become. That way no one would ask any questions. &quot;Of course I would!&quot; David hit yes and was shown another screen. &quot;Ready to input changes. Target must be in front of the device.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well here goes nothing... David, come here! I need your help again!&quot; Steve wasn&#39;t sure if David would listen to him, but a couple of seconds later, he heard the door open and David come back downstairs. Steve clicked the enter button and on the screen a countdown of five seconds. He moved away from the screen. It probably wouldn&#39;t work on him without the proper input, but decided not to take that chance, less there be two babies with no one to look after them. &quot;Jesus Steve! It just a computer! Read the freaking manual if...&quot; But before David could finish his sentence, the device hit zero, momentarily flashed and shot out a beam of light that hit David flat in the chest. &quot;Ooof!&quot; David let out a small grunt as he was knocked onto the floor. Steve panicked. &quot;Oh my god! David, are you alright?!&quot; Steve ran up to him as David got up. He frantically touched all over his upper body, but nothing was wrong. Steve sighed in relief. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck was that?!&quot; David cursed out loud. &quot;Umm, well you see...&quot; &quot;Gah! Forget it! Just leave me alone!&quot; David tried to get off the floor, but felt his body stiffen. &quot;Ugh!&quot; He fell back down to the floor. &quot;David?&quot; Steve asked, this time with some trepidation in his voice. &quot;I mean, there&#39;s no way right...&quot; he thought. &quot;Ugh... Gah!&quot; David feel down on his back again as his body seized up. &quot;Guh! My body! It feels so hot!&quot; David squirmed on the floor. As Steve just watched, he started to notice David&#39;s body changing. He was no longer the thirteen year old he was before. He looked about twelve now. His clothes looked slightly looser on his body. As he writhed on the floor in pain, his feet slid up and down on the wooden floor, each movement took his socks off his feet more and more until they slid off his feet completely. David looked at his now bare feet, which were slightly smaller now. &quot;Gah! What&#39;s... happening... to me... Gah!&quot; &quot;Oh my god...&quot; Steve said as he covered his mouth in shock. The device had worked. David was getting younger by the second. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh! I&#39;m shrinking?!&quot; David thought back to when he was hit by the beam of light. He looked at Steve in a mixture of fear and anger. &quot;What... did you... Doooof?!&quot; David asked as another wave of force hit him. His loose shorts slid slightly of his body. &quot;Oh well... I really didn&#39;t think it would work, but I wanted you to like me so...&quot; &quot;Gah! God! It hurts! My body! My bodahgggghhhh!&quot; By now David looked to be about 6 years old, over half his age. &quot;So, I uh... decided that I need to raise you properly from a better starting point,&quot; Steve finished. &quot;Gah! Guh! How... How many years?!&quot; &quot;Well, um... six...... months old.&quot; &quot;What?! Gah!&quot; &quot;But, don&#39;t worry. You won&#39;t remember any of this soon, so you&#39;ll be okay.&quot; &quot;Guh! No! Nooooo!&quot; David tried to move. After some struggle, he turned over and started to crawl away from the room. He came out of both his shorts and underwear easily. He felt slight discomfort as his dwindling penis slid with him, but he simply wanted to escape. Maybe the changes would stop. Steve saw what he was trying to do and while he didn&#39;t think it would work, he again couldn&#39;t take that chance. &quot;Sorry David, but I can&#39;t let you do that.&quot; Steve dragged David back to where he was. &quot;Nooooooo! I don&#39;t wanna!&quot; David tried to use his stubby little hands to claw his way back, but he was too young now. About three years old. He simply slid out of his shirt and was now buck naked as a two year old.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nooo! Nooo!&quot; David cried as he was forced into toddlerhood. Now at one years old, his memories and brain functions clouded and he could recall little of the human language he had accumulated over the years. &quot;Goo! Goo, goo! Wahhh!&quot; was all he could say as the last of his teenage brain was lost. Now nothing but a clueless little tyke, he started to stop crying and giggled as the man he would call Dad looked more like he was playing with him, then dragging him to hell. &quot;There, there. That&#39;s a good boy!&quot; Steve said as he tickled David&#39;s tummy. &quot;Bwahahaha!&quot; David laughed as his transformation into six month old was complete. &quot;Phew! That was tiring!&quot; Steve said to himself as he watched his now baby boy flail around. &quot;Goo!&quot; was all he let out as he peed himself. &quot;Well, I guess I know what I&#39;m doing!&quot; Steve thought as he picked up David so he could changed him.</p>
