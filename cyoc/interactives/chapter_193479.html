<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Evan knew he didn&#39;t have much time. Still naked, he rushed across the hall to his parents room. His dad wasn&#39;t a big buy, but his clothes were at least bigger than Evan&#39;s. Upon raiding his dad&#39;s closet, Evan found a pair of gray sweatpants that looked like they might be big enough to fit him. He struggled to get them on over his huge thighs. His dick stuck out so far that he had to really squeeze to get into them. And even then, once they were on, they looked painted on. The gray certainly didn&#39;t help with that. Not an inch of his new bulge was left to the imagination. He scanned for a shirt but it didn&#39;t look like any of them would fit. And his dad only wore a size 10 shoe, so that was out of the question. <br />
<br />
Evan looked at himself in the mirror. He was huge. His biceps were a major focal point as well as his hairy chest. Dylan would obviously notice the differences, but at least Evan was wouldn&#39;t be completely naked when he opened the door. He threw on some deodorant, noticing how much hair stuck to it when he was finished, and combed his messy hair. He thought about trying to trim up his beard, but he loved having the facial hair too much. <br />
<br />
Just as he was finishing, the doorbell rang. Evan walked downstairs to the door, where he could see Dylan carrying an overnight bag through the window. <br />
<br />
Evan opened the door, &quot;What&#39;s up man?&quot; he said, trying to sound normal, but he had forgotten that his voice had dropped so much.<br />
Dylan stared at the man in front of him, &quot;Evan?&quot; he asked slowly.<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah,&quot; replied Evan, &quot;I look a little different, I know.&quot;<br />
&quot;What the hell happened to you?&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a weird story, but come in and I&#39;ll tell you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan told Dylan the whole story. About the store in the mall, about the potion, about the growth, about everything. Dylan just stared at Evan&#39;s chest the whole time, shocked at what his friend had become. <br />
<br />
When he finished telling the story, Dylan spoke, &quot;So you cheated?&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Evan.<br />
&quot;Our beard growing contest for no shave November. You cheated and that&#39;s why you won?&quot;<br />
&quot;In my defense,&quot; answered Evan, &quot;I didn&#39;t know I was cheating at the time. I thought it was just some sort of multivitamin that would enhance the fullness of my beard. I had no idea it would do all this to me,&quot; he said, flexing a bicep. &quot;I even have some more of the potion, but I wasn&#39;t really planning in drinking anymor--<br />
&quot;I want it,&quot; interrupted Dylan. &quot;I want the potion. I want to drink some of it. You clearly seem to be enjoying it,&quot; he said, glancing down at the outline of Evan&#39;s new cock. &quot;Why shouldn&#39;t I be able to enjoy it too? Might make me more athletic.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan was happy his friend wanted to become like him. But he had to be careful. Dylan was already harrier than him without the potion, so if they both drank the same amount, Dylan would surely surpass him. Evan couldn&#39;t let that happen. He grabbed a cup from the kitchen and went upstairs to his room as Dylan followed. He poured half the remaining amount of potion from the vial to the cup. The vial just had a sip left, which Evan slipped into a drawer for safe keeping while Dylan wasn&#39;t looking. Evan handed the cup to Dylan.<br />
<br />
&quot;How does the growth happen?&quot; asked Dylan.<br />
&quot;Honestly, I don&#39;t know,&quot; replied Evan, &quot;Both times I&#39;ve grown, I&#39;ve been asleep.&quot; Except for the time in the shower, but Evan didn&#39;t feel the need to tell Dylan about that. &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s instant. It either happens slowly, or it takes a while to start.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dylan looked down at the cup in his hand and then back up at Evan slowly. He gazed at his massive feet, his huge legs, the impressive tool that hung between them, the abs, the pecs, the biceps, and the hair. The amount of hair was truly impressive. Dylan looked down at his cup again, lifted it to his mouth, and drank.<br />
<br />
<br />
At first, nothing happened. Dylan and Evan went about their business, getting stuff set up for the weekend. They unpacked Dylan&#39;s stuff and then sat down in Evan&#39;s room to play some video games. <br />
<br />
After about an hour Dylan started to feel funny, &quot;Hey man-&quot; he stopped when he heard his voice. It was definitely deeper. &quot;I think something&#39;s happening.&quot; Dylan stood up, getting ready for the growth. Evan was excited to see how it happened, since he had never seen himself grow like this. <br />
<br />
Dylan looked down es as he started to inch taller. His legs and torso lengthened, making him stand at an impressive 6&#39;2&quot;. His pant legs were now several inches above his feet, which also grew right then. His small size 9 feet expanded outwards across the carpeted floor until they were a size 12. Realizing what was about to happen, Dylan worked quickly to get his shirt and pants off. Dylan definitely had skinny abs. He never really worked out, but the only reason he had abs is because he was skinny. And with the little bit of hair on his flat chest, there wasn&#39;t much to show off, yet. <br />
<br />
The muscle literally seemed to work its way up his body. His calves were first, they toned out very nicely. He had the calves of somebody who ran frequently. His thighs were next, ballooning out until they were quite big. He already had visible abs, but they became much more toned and impressive. It was a perfect washboard. Dylan&#39;s pecs were next. The pushed out, adding quite a bit of weight to his body, followed by his biceps which also toned out very nicely. The transformation didn&#39;t stop there. Next, hair worked its way up his legs and over his abs and pecs. Small hairs pushed their way through the skin, highlighting his new pecs. The hair worked its way up to Dylan&#39;s face, where it pushed out a lot. He was already so hairy on his face, so the potion just increased what was already there. In just a matter of seconds, Dylan had grown a beard better than he&#39;d ever grown before, just slightly shorter than Evan&#39;s. Dylans face shape started to change too. His jaw became sharper and his cheekbones higher. His eyes completely changed color. They went from brown to a shockingly bright shade of cobalt blue. <br />
Dylan felt a tingling sensation in his now very tight underwear. He smiled as he looked down. This is what he was most looking forward to. He felt his dick lengthen out and start to grow, becoming more and more sensitive. More hair grew until some of the wiry hairs were sticking out above the wasteband, just like Evan. Dylan let out a deep sigh as the growth finished.<br />
<br />
He looked over himself. He wasn&#39;t as big, or as hairy, or as tall as Evan, but his dick was easily just as big. Evan also noticed this and was glad that he hadn&#39;t given Dylan the same amount. Dylan turned to show off a little to Evan, only to find his friend&#39;s already super tight sweatpants even tighter and soaked in precum. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck that was hot,&quot; said Evan in his deep voice, massaging one of his hairy nipples. &quot;What should we do now?&quot;</p>
