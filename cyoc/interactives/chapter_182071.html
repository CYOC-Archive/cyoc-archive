<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;We were going for a walk around the school grounds&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen decided that some fresh air would do her good. Becides now she could walk and talk in order to figure out how her relation was with the rest of the people at the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah yes of course, lets go&quot; Amanda said quickly.<br />
<br />
Jen, Amanda, Susan, Kyle and the goth girl Kyle was speaking too who Jen now recognized as Tiffany all got up from the table. Amanda her movements were a bit labored and her progress was very as she had to drag her over sized udder with her. Jen started to feel a bit sorry for the girl. The changes may have taken a part of Jen her humanity away but her new memories have blessed her with a newly found empathy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amanda are you ok?&quot; Jen asked, surprising herself with the sentence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea I am used to it. I have gotten used to dragging this thing behind me right?&quot; This was as good an opportunity to make Amanda her predicament a bit more durable as any Jen decided<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you are strong enough to move without problems&quot;<br />
<br />
Instantly Amanda her legs bulked up with muscle. Amanda her still impressive udder lay heavily on her legs but she could now move without the thing dragging behind her. The change did not do much to make Amanda look normal. Now she was a goat girl with giant legs but at least she could now move without difficulty.<br />
<br />
With that done Jen turned to Susan. Being in constant heat has made her far more interested in her friend then before. She could smell her powerful scent under Susan her clothes. Jen decided she could try to pry some information about Kyle from Susan.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Susan do you know what is going on between Kyle and Tiffany?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know it can be a bit hard to tell with Kyle his reptile face but even you should be able to see that he likes her. Tiff is a nice girl and all but I do not think Kyle will make much of a change with her. I mean do you think She is into snake girls?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen had absolutely no idea how to react to that question simply because she did not know Tiffany enough. Luckily for Jen this meant she could answer the question however she wanted. Ignorance can be bliss it seems.<br />
<br />
Jen looked at Kyle. He was slithering next to Tiffany holding one of his udders up with his arms. His head was slightly bowed and somehow he was still able to blush through his scales. In this new form he almost seems cute, fragile. &quot;Yea they seem a good fit for each other&quot; Jen concluded. &quot;Tiffany seems like she is comparable with someone who is part snake&quot;. It seems Kyle was not longer that interested in Jen. Without the bullying Jen and Kyle hardly spoke it seemed<br />
<br />
Jen could not see it but unbeknownst to her Tiffany her eyes shifted becoming the split eyes of a snake as she lost all gag reflexes she had, now able to swallow her food whole amongst other things.<br />
<br />
Jen was through occupied eyeing Susan to pay much attention to the others as the group was halfway through their walk. Susan her skirt was waving freely in the wind, this gave Jen the odd look at her equine package. Susan caught Jen staring at her and started to feel a bit uncomfortable under the attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Jen can you believe how much make up Tifanny is putting on to make her skin look paler?&quot; Susan asked in the hopes to distract Jen from her scent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh oh no, Tiffany is not wearing make up. Her skin in naturally as white as paper with black lips&quot; Jen said only barely thinking straight. Susan would have thought Jen was being sarcastic if what she said was not 100% correct. Tiffany her skin now looked much whiter than any make up could have ever done.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you imagine that girl wearing normal clothes? It would never fit her style&quot; Susan continued, still trying to keep Jen her attention away from her nether regions. Not thinking straight Jen took this change to expose Susan a bit more to her<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t have to imagine. We have a uniform in school that consists out of a short skirt with tight button up shirt and stockings remember&quot;<br />
<br />
With that lie Susan her package was now showing underneath her school skirt all the time giving Jen enough to drool over. Her half thought through lie did not only affect Susan though as now all the girls and Kyle were wearing the same uniform. Amanda her skirt did nothing to support her udder and her legs and udder were completely exposed.<br />
<br />
Looking around Jen could see the cruse affecting all other students to. Even the boys were wearing the same skirt with button up shirt combo. Maybe I should have been more careful with my wording Jen thought. They boys of the school were still mostly unchanged. They only has enlarged noses on their faces forcing their eyes somewhat apart and bovine horns from different sizes and forms on their heads. She also saw Ryan with a few boys from her class, they were very easy to spot because of their magically enlarged dongs hanging under their skirts. The group was just done with their round when the bell rang.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen, can you remind me what did we have next period?&quot;</p>
