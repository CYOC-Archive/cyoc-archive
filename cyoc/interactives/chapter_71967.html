<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Of Dan’s three pups, Angus was the one who had changed the most in the last few months. The combination of <br />
Dan’s loving discipline, Patrick’s powerlifting training and all of their combined bulking efforts had <br />
combined in Angus in the most extraordinary way. The most noticeable change was the way that all of Angus’ <br />
dimensions had ballooned out after being put onto the right diet and training. <br />
<br />
Dan wasn’t quite too sure if he had always been underfed and undertrained or whether it was his wishes <br />
physically manifesting and changing Angus through sheer will and duty alone. Angus had always been taller than <br />
Patrick, but previously had been quite a lot leaner. Now he sported a ball belly that struck out several feet <br />
with pecs that rested firmly and roundly ontop of them. His beard out grown out impressively from the closely <br />
cropped beard he had in the first instance to getting his very first braid in his beard last week. All of the <br />
powerlifting exercises has a massive effect on his thighs, rump and biceps that had tripped in size, with <br />
strength growing exponentially to match.<br />
<br />
Because of Angus’ status at the housepup, Angus’s world was exclusively his Master’s apartment, the <br />
powerlifting gym down the road and the space in between. Dan’s plan to stretch out Angus’s balls had gone well <br />
- extraordinarily so. As the weeks and months passed Dan continued to add more and more weight to Angus’s ball <br />
stretcher, sequentially inching closer and closer towards the ground. It was a joyous day around the end of <br />
their first Month when his balls first touched the ground. That day Dan rewarded Angus with the best reward he <br />
can give to his pup, an uninterrupted evening with his Master. At the end evening of personal service he <br />
removed the locks and the chastity device from Angus and gave him expressed permission to cum.<br />
<br />
 Watching his pup come was one of the most intense things he had ever seen, a combination of carnal desire and <br />
loving duty overpowering his consciousness. Dan looked directly at his pup, feeling the fuzzy (and growing <br />
fuzzier) mounds on his chest, the light motions sending waves of pleasure throughout his entire body, the <br />
combination of the two sent fireworks through Angus’s brain. Dan leaned over and whispered into his pup’s ear <br />
and lightly ordered “come”. Within a matter of seconds, Angus’ cock inflated to it’s full length, even <br />
longerm, thicker, and heavier than even a month ago. It stood up rigid and angrily red. Wave after wave <br />
pleasure washed over Angus as his entire body tightened, his balls retracted a foot closer to his body and he <br />
scrunched his face, spraying cupful after cupful of  his own cum across the room. His pup fell backwards onto <br />
the bed, exhausted after that episode. Dan invited Patrick and Marcus back into the room and ordered them to <br />
clean up the mess their brother had made with their tongues, which they did with gusto.<br />
<br />
That was two months ago, since then Dan increased the weights on his ball stretchers up to 300 pounds and then <br />
up to 500lbs. By the third month his balls dragged heavily behind him at all times by about five feet. The <br />
most amazing part was that his testicles grew to compensate for their stretched sack, both inflating to the <br />
size of large yoga balls. It was Dan’s plan to have him anchored to the ground by his own balls, and it was <br />
coming along better than Dan could have possibly imagined.<br />
<br />
Dan also relished the psychological changes that had happened within Angus. He took to his role as housepup <br />
like a fish to water, learning all of his tasks quickly. He was a little awkward and clumsy trying to clean at <br />
his size.  Often getting wedged in doorways if he didn’t turn just right, or leaving a trail of pre behind as <br />
he would try to scrub the floor.   Under the direction of Dan and with Patrick as his Alpha he was in good <br />
hands, growing into a Patrick to be. The first two weeks were the hardest for Angus as he adjusted to the <br />
chastity device, his biological urges screaming at him (particularly during his Master’s morning ritual), the <br />
law of his Master’s word keeping those drives at bay. Angus’ young and malleable brain took in as much as it <br />
could, hungry for more information. In weeks he became a comparable servant to his brothers.  As the days <br />
would pass, like his brothers he would grow larger and larger and sink deeper and deeper becoming more <br />
emotionally, psychologically and physically dependent on his Master. <br />
<br />
* * * <br />
At the gym, Patrick met up with Angus. He looked upon his protege with some pride. It was amazing progress <br />
that his Beta had made these last few months both in his physical and psychological progression. <br />
<br />
Patrick’s heart and duty has been and always will be sworn to his Master, but he reserved a special affection <br />
for Angus. There was an unbridled potential within Angus and Patrick got great personal pleasure in helping <br />
his beta reach. He was making his Master proud and that’s what mattered. Patrick didn’t “dominate” over Angus <br />
per se, more watched over him carefully like a loving big brother, reminding him to take his vitamins, finish <br />
his meals, workout even harder and in the finer points of loving service to their Master. In return Angus <br />
would playfully return the favour. Occasionally when their Master had gone out to work and all the chores, the <br />
two would nap together on the bed. Patrick embracing his beta, acting as a poor surrogate for his Master’s <br />
attentions. One time Dan came home to find his pups in the bed asleep holding each other tightly, whimpering <br />
to each other asleep. <br />
<br />
“Have you drunk your pre-workout drink?” Asked Patrick, dressed in his standard prescribed gym uniform: <br />
compression shorts and a see through singlet.<br />
“Yes, Brother” he said. “And my vitamins”. <br />
<br />
The gym was unlike most other gyms. You certainly wouldn’t find it one like it in the small college town. It <br />
was a small reinforced boutique gym for people like Angus and Patrick, collard ginger pups with a propensity <br />
for achieving superhuman scales of size and strength. It was a not-for-profit service funded by resident <br />
Masters in the surrounding apartment blocks recognising that that their precious possessions needing place to <br />
train. Gingers were commonly refused from regular gyms for almost universally causing damage to the gym: <br />
bending barbells out of shape, dropped weights damaging floors, punching bags being smashing against ceilings, <br />
or making huge messes when they couldn’t control their sex drive. The gingers also found the equipment at the <br />
local gyms inadequate for their needs - they needed stronger and more accommodatingly sized equipment with <br />
much heavier weights. Despite having decent ventilation, the place always had the heady smell of the gingers’ <br />
intense labours.<br />
<br />
“Strike me a double bicep pose please, Angus” Patrick asked. <br />
<br />
Angus did so. While Patrick could see the progress that Angus had made, all Angus could see was the progress <br />
he had yet to achieve to earn his Master’s affections. Angus felt humbled, it drove him to press himself even <br />
harder. Patrick could see his beta’s biceps were developing massive peaks, each arm nearing 40 bloated inches <br />
around.<br />
<br />
Patrick mirrored his brother in his double bicep pose. Showing his brother his own biceps. Patrick too could <br />
not see his own progress, but his brother saw in awe. Patrick admired Angus for his propensity for progress <br />
and Angus admired Patrick for his massive strength.<br />
<br />
“Angus, are you holding your st-stomach in?” Patrick asked his brother.<br />
<br />
Angus didn’t respond respond to the question, but just like Patrick he could not conceal his true feelings at <br />
any time. Patrick walked up to his brother, due to the size difference Patrick was eye level with shiny lock <br />
and chain almost choking Angus, nonetheless he was able to make his presence known.<br />
<br />
“Angus, you are to never conceal yourself to anyone, not to your b-brothers and especially not to your Master. <br />
Relax your stomach Angus!” Patrick commanded, barking at Angus in a moment of Alpha-ness that took him by <br />
surprise.<br />
<br />
With mild self-consciousness Angus breathed out, his newly acquired ball belly jutting out from his body. <br />
Within his own perceptions, he only thought he was holding in his stomach a few inches. In Patrick’s eyes, his <br />
stomach came out round and firm an additional two feet.<br />
<br />
“Fark!” exclaimed Patrick in astonishment, his eyes growing wide. “Please w-w-wait here!”.<br />
<br />
Patrick swaggered over to the gymnists office and grabbed a tape measure. He reached it around Angus, finding <br />
the measurement and bringing it level around his belly button.<br />
<br />
144 inches!<br />
<br />
“Damn Angus! Your stomach is the s-size mine was the day I first met Master. It took me years of training to <br />
get to that size and you catch up in three months!” It took a moment for Patrick to think about how he knew <br />
these details, he guess he just knew.<br />
<br />
Angus appeared sheepish, his face going flush red, unused to getting such praise and too socially awkward to <br />
gracefully accept his Alpha’s praise. “I.. guess... I had the right encouragement” he muttered almost <br />
inaudibly, looking away from Patrick. <br />
<br />
“Now measure me.” Patrick asked Angus. Patrick had to hold the tape to his stomach as Angus lumbered around <br />
him, his balls dragging heavily behind him on the floor below. Angus lined up the tape “156 inches!”.<br />
<br />
“Not bad. Still can do a lot better” dismissively scoffed Patrick.<br />
<br />
“We need to do a lot better for Master” reminded Angus.<br />
<br />
The two both looked at each other, both suddenly thinking of their Master and becoming overcome with emotion, <br />
both knowing in each other’s eyes how they missed their Master. But they had to keep going, if they broke down <br />
now in the gym the couldn’t finish the workout.<br />
<br />
“So...” Patrick interjected interrupting the exquisite sadness the two shared. “Today we’re w-working on your <br />
arms”. Patrick added more weights to Angus’ ball stretcher, now bringing it to over a total of 800 pounds. Now <br />
Angus was going to really struggle with his mobility. “For your warmup, You’re going to start with palms-in <br />
pullups, you will do no less than 100, if you can do more, please do. Then you will do tricep dips, you will <br />
do three sets to exhaustion. I will expect no less than 150 repetitions per set, if you can do more, please <br />
do. When you have done that we can move onto bench press.”<br />
<br />
Angus was pumped. Patrick felt tingles running through his body.<br />
<br />
“For Master!” Patrick exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“FOR MASTER!” Angus yelled back, unwittingly yelling too loud, obviously overexcited about his workout. No <br />
matter, the other gingers were far too focused on their own workouts to notice.<br />
<br />
“And remember brother, keep your form good. Master said he was going to come in later today and see us <br />
perform.”</p>
