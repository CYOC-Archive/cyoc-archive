<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As anyone in the entertainment industry knows, one of the most important factors to keep the business going is to bring in new material. It&#39;s human nature to want to see something new and lose interest if the same thing keeps repeating. Even fan favoritism will wain with repetition. This is one of the main reasons market research exists: to determine what people would want most.<br />
<br />
This is no less different for people in the adult entertainment business. Sure, the shows may be erotic and exotic enough, but without something new, eventually interest would dry up. Even at the Meat Market, new acts were on demand. Sure, they could easily entertain people with the super-sexy bodies that Animalians possess, but they don&#39;t want to see the same things over and over again. That&#39;s why shows rotated and new performers were welcomed.<br />
<br />
Miss Fabina was currently interviewing one right now. With the pandemic starting to end, new business was starting to come in. Of course, standard sanitation protocols were still in effect. And surveys were being handed out to patrons, asking what they&#39;d like to see more of. Several surveys said they wanted to see something a little more exotic, belly-dancing was a popular subject. But it wasn&#39;t enough for Miss Fabina to have her workers dress as belly-dancers. She knew actual belly-dancers were a very sensual experience, certainly more enthralling than people trying to mimic it. And she wanted it to be as close to as authentic as possible. However, until recently, the only Arabian mare Animalian in town was Muslim and refused to do it. Yes, she practiced a form of Islamism that was certainly more liberal than most, but she wasn&#39;t <i>that</i> liberal.<br />
<br />
But now there was a new Arabian Mare in town. Being an uplifted horse, Leila was less concerned about human modesty. She was still learning about the niceties of being a part of civilized society, but she had a lot of potential. Leila also had the body for an exotic dancer. While all Animalians gained bodies that were close to muscular and sexual ideal for either gender, Leila wasn&#39;t quite as muscular as some of the other horse Animalians Fabina had seen. Though then again, Arabians were bred more to be racehorses than workhorses. This could work to Leila&#39;s advantage.<br />
<br />
After talking with Roger and Dan, Fabina spoke with Leila to see if she was interested. &quot;So, you just want me to dance for people?&quot; asked Leila.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s a bit more involved in that,&quot; said Miss Fabina, &quot;I would like to be able to do a particular kind of Arabian dance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not really I know how to do it,&quot; said Leila.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I have an old friend who&#39;s a professional belly-dancer. It may take her a while to come to Animalia and convert, but I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll teach you what you need to now,&quot; said Miss Fabina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it does sound like fun,&quot; said Leila, &quot;I&#39;m not quite sure how well I&#39;ll be able to dance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll figure it out. You do have the gracefulness of a horse,&quot; said Miss Fabina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Leila.<br />
<br />
&quot;However, there is one other thing,&quot; said Fabina, &quot;You&#39;re expected to be part of an erotic show, so it would require to interact with people in ways you may find unfamiliar or uncomfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leila shrugged and said, &quot;Probably not that unfamiliar. I&#39;ve been having sex with Dan and Roger since I helped them convert.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that so?&quot; asked Fabina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes, it was quite an ecstatic experience,&quot; said Leila, thinking back.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
While some of Leila&#39;s memories of her life as a mundane mare were hard to recall clearly, her memories of the day she was uplifted was always the strongest. She could remember being brought to a strange place, not like a stable. It was so cold and empty, she wasn&#39;t sure that she liked it. But Dan and Roger were there. They were nice, they took good care of her. She was left alone in a room with a bucket of water. Being thirsty, she took a drink, barely noticing the odd taste.<br />
<br />
Then her whole world started reshaping, literally. She dropped to the floor and her legs became too unstable. There was cracking and pops as her legs reformed, her front hooves blossoming into functional hands as her back legs grew strong. Her spine snapped as it was restructured to work in an upright position. She let out grunts and groans of discomfort as her torso collapsed more in on itself. Her moans became more human as her neck shortened slightly and her larynx reformed to allow for clear speech. Her brain expanded to be able to process speech, emotions, memories, and other sapient functions. Her growing clarity allowed her to fully register the pleasure she was now feeling as her repositioned udders started swelling on her chest, sending tingles of pleasure down to her vagina which now faced forward. New hands groped and rubbed her new erogenous zones as she let out very human moans. Those moans escalated into a whinny as she came to a climax.<br />
<br />
Lelia sat up, a feat easily feasible by her new humanoid form. She looked over her voluptuous body. &quot;Well, this is nice,&quot; she said. Leila was aware that she was a lot smarter now, closer to a human. And she could think about humans in more extensive terms than just &#39;food givers&#39;. She had clearer memories about Dan and Roger now. They really cared for her ever since they found her. And now she wanted to care for them.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
&quot;You do know what Leila will want with us,&quot; said Roger to Dan as they walked towards the changing room that Leila was supposed to be in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I do,&quot; said Dan, &quot;That&#39;s part of the reason we came here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just...she probably won&#39;t be us one at a time,&quot; said Roger.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve been through a lot together, Roger,&quot; said Dan, &quot;Sharing a threesome with you as horses would be bliss compared to other things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that&#39;s true,&quot; said Roger before they came to the door. After knocking, they stepped in.<br />
<br />
They&#39;ve seen plenty of pictures of mare Animalians, so they knew what to expect. It was quite another thing to see Leila as an Animalian. She was a gorgeous horse, but as an Animalian she was breathtakingly stunning. Not to mention, drop-dead sexy. &quot;Uh, Leila, wow,&quot; said Dan, &quot;You look incredible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel incredible too,&quot; said Leila as she walked over to the two of them, sashaying her hips as she went, &quot;And after all you&#39;ve done for me, I want you to feel incredible too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roger gulped and said, &quot;You don&#39;t waste time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why wait for this?&quot; asked Leila as she hugged the two privates close to her. Even if she was as big and bulky as other horses, she was still taller than the two men, which made her breasts about head level for both of them. &quot;One for each,&quot; she said coyly.<br />
<br />
There really didn&#39;t seem much reason to hold back so both Roger and Dan latched onto her nipples. Leila gave a happy moan. The feeling of being milked felt so good. And her nose was picking up the changes in their scents. It became more noticeable as fur started to appear over their bodies. Reaching down, she rubbed at their crotches, which were penting hard against their pants. When she unbuttoned them, they sprang out hard as their underwear was ripping open. Holding their dicks in her hands, Leila reveled at them getting bigger, longer, more like stallions.<br />
<br />
Curious about how they tasted, Leila knelt down. She didn&#39;t have to go down as far, both because of how big their cocks were becoming and how tall they were growing, particularly as their legs extended on hooves. She licked and nibbled at Roger&#39;s first before sucking on Dan&#39;s. The two of them groaned and wickered as their transformations got closer to completion. Their faces were extending into muzzles as tails grew out behind them. Leila alternated between the two studs, her hands pumping them as her mouth went from one cock to the other. She could feel the tension in both of them building up. She stopped her sucking and started pumping both of them with gusto. Roger and Dan grunted before they let out neighs, their cocks splashing Lelia&#39;s face with their new equine seed.<br />
<br />
Leila wiped the white mess off her face, licking it up eagerly. Looking up, she saw a pair of handsome stallions. Perhaps not the most heavily-muscled compared to others, but their military training had given them considerable physiques beforehand. And it seemed neither of them were fully sated from her first ministrations. Which was good as she had a cunt that was begging for some attention. Standing up, she struck a sexy pose. &quot;So boy,&quot; said Leila, &quot;Who wants to go first?&quot;</p>
