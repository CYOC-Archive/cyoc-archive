<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">During the next three weeks I barely got to see John. He would wake up at 4AM in the morning and he would lift weights for about 2 hours in the basement. By the time I got up, after 6AM or so, he would be in the shower and getting dressed for school. <br />
<br />
He would be gone for most of the day, because he would work out in the large gym at school after his last class is over. So, he wouldn&#39;t come home until after 5PM. I would be home all day, since I was only 8 years old and mom thought I was too short and too small to be playing with other kids in the second grade, so she decided to have me homeschooled instead. <br />
<br />
When I finally did get to see John, we were either eating at the dinner table, he was studying in his room, or he was sound asleep. On weekends, he would be in the gym most of the day, or studying in his room. I didn&#39;t want to bug him when he was studying because then he would get really annoyed with me and I wanted him to finish school and graduate. He was a hard worker and he was making good grades, but I didn&#39;t want to be the reason for him failing any tests or anything, so I left him alone when I saw him reading or studying. <br />
<br />
When I finally ran into John in the kitchen again, I wanted to get a jug of milk out of the top shelf in the fridge. Again, I was too short, too small and too weak to reach it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Urrghhh! John! Please... Can you get me some milk?&quot; I just groaned as I held an empty plastic cup in my hand. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing, little bro?&quot; he just smiled as he opened the fridge door and easily reached over my head and held the big milk jug with one hand over my head. He unscrewed the cap and poured the milk into my cup before pouring some into his own cup as well. <br />
<br />
I sipped on my milk while he downed the entire cup in one shot. John also ate twice as much as I did, which was to be expected since he was so BIG. <br />
<br />
Once John stood in front of me for a second time, he let out a soft groan. I heard a loud bone-cracking sound, which came from deep inside of his big, lumbering but very muscular frame. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh....&quot; John moaned as he craned his head back as if he was overcome by a very pleasurable feeling all over his body. <br />
<br />
Then, I heard it!<br />
<br />
KKKKKKKKKKKRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!<br />
<br />
&quot;What... What was that sound?&quot; I gasped, as I looked up at him. <br />
<br />
Then I saw it happen before my very eyes. My 8-year-old brother, who was now living inside of my 18-year-old body, which was standing at a 6-foot-6 inches tall, was growing before my very eyes! Not only had he put on a crazy amount of muscle in a short amount of time, but I saw John shot up by a couple of inches right there, right in front of me! It was as if the curse wanted to show me who was getting bigger... And who wasn&#39;t. Not only was it ridiculously easy for John to gain muscle, but I just continued to grow bigger and taller like it was nothing. Within just a few minutes, while staring at him, I saw his legs grow bigger, wider and longer. His torso widened a bit and his arms grew longer. If he was imposing before, he was becoming a giant now!<br />
<br />
My guess was that John had grown to an astounding 7-foot-2 inches tall within a few seconds. As I looked up to him, he just seemed like such a huge guy, it was just incredible how TALL he was. <br />
<br />
His chest had just become massive, like huge orbs of muscle sticking out, making his shoulders incredibly wide. His arms were big, long and thick, like the biggest pythons in existence. His abs were like bricks on a huge, brick wall... Solid, thick and strong. And then there were his legs. His long, thick legs were just titanic. His quads had grown so wide, that he would struggle to walk through the doorframe of any door in the house. His legs were bigger than tree trunks. They were also long enough that I could just walk between them, while standing at my full height without my head reaching his groin. That&#39;s how BIG he had become!<br />
<br />
But wait. Things got even weirder. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, I heard that sound again. This time, it was coming from ME, from MY body. <br />
<br />
KKKKKKKKKKKRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!<br />
<br />
Suddenly, everything around me was getting bigger. The chairs around the dining table, the cupboards in the kitchen, the furniture in the living room, the dining table itself... Everything seemed to be growing. The walls were getting higher and the whole house seemed to be getting bigger and wider. Then, it dawned on me. I was SHRINKING!<br />
<br />
Just a few moments had passed and I was still looking like an 8-year-old boy... But a very small 8-year-old boy. I was only 2 feet tall. So, you can imagine when I saw John standing before me, what that must have felt like. As I looked straight ahead of me, all I could see were legs. I walked towards him. Then, all I could see were his legs, on either side of me. Finally, I heard his voice coming from far above me. <br />
<br />
I just saw these huge, thick, and very long legs. These legs were never-ending. I had to crane my neck and look up and up and UP. Then, there he was, over 5 feet above me, I saw his face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gosh bro! How did you get so small?&quot; John asked me. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ohmygosh! All I saw before me were John&#39;s big, wide kneecaps and his massive quads. As he walked closer to me, I saw his giant feet move closer. It was scary. <br />
<br />
&quot;JOHN! Please! Look out! Don&#39;t step on me!&quot; I screamed. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, two large hands came reaching down, picking me up under my armpits and then lifting me up and off the ground like I weighed nothing. I got raised up higher and higher until I was looking straight at John&#39;s face. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take care of ya, little bro! Let&#39;s go into my room. You&#39;ll be safe there!&quot; John said as he gently carried me into his bedroom and closed the door. <br />
<br />
He set me on his bed and he removed all his clothes. Then, he lay flat on his back, placing me on top of his expansive chest and torso. Sitting on top of his massive frame was like sitting on a huge mattress made purely of muscles. <br />
<br />
I crawled up his abs towards his pecs where I lay down my head. His huge pecs were like huge pillows. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tomorrow morning you can wake me up by rubbing my cock or sucking me off, okay, little bro?&quot; John said. <br />
<br />
Considering how big and how tall John had become, I had decided not to disappoint my huge, gigantic and insanely muscular brother. </p>
