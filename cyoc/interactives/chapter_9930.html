<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Ken giggled about the boys were having great fun with the Medallion. It was alomst a year to the very day when a mountain of past sins dumped it's heavy weight.<br />
<br />
The two boys played together and often as many boys and some girls which plagued them often had horrid memories of life as lower creatures on this earth. It was when two Police cars pulled up and four Policemen got out that Bob and Damn'it Ray saw big trouble.<br />
<br />
Soon the two were arrested and sitting in seperate cells. Their personal belongings now placed in manilla folders and put in the Sheriff's own safe. It wasn't long before one after another came forward telling or wierd things and having some proofs.<br />
<br />
Ten days passed and one morning the Jailer came with two guards for the boys. Soon they stood in front of a fat judge and their parents sitting to each side of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have reports here of several young people who tell of your doing almost impossible things to their bodies. Then more than that they were left to live for a time as if animals, we suspect it was a drug! Now we want to know what you did and how so that all those effected can have piece.&quot; ordered the Judge.<br />
<br />
It was Damn'it Ray that spoke up first as his Father sat up straighter in his chair. The boy had a perfect name as his Father conamed him for all the damn trouble he caused or made about the home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our Medallion, Sir! It has real powers and we use it to do wild and wierd things to nasty people who bug us, Sir!&quot; announced Damn'it Ray.<br />
<br />
The Judge pulled from one envelope a silver colored medallion strung on a leather string.<br />
<br />
&quot;This?&quot; asked the Judge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup!&quot; replied Ray.<br />
<br />
&quot;Show me?' asked the Judge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn'it Ray if you mess up now I'll have scooping horse shit till the day you die!&quot; yelled his Father.<br />
<br />
Ray looked to Bob as he winked and smiled at Damn'it Ray's Dad.<br />
<br />
Ray turned to his Dad and said, &quot;I wish for my Father to show how Mule headed he can be!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ray's Dad sat up and was about to reach over and strike his dimwit Son when he felt something very odd. In Ray's hand the Medallion glowed bright filling the room with it's glowing rays.<br />
<br />
Ray's Mother screamed first as she looked in terror at her Husbands fast extending ears. Daddy turned to his wife and wishing to ask her trouble he let loose a rough sounding bray of the Mule head he was soon to enjoy.<br />
<br />
Faster and faster the skin and hair grew over Ray's Dad as the Judge pounded his gavel and ordered Ray to stop. In less than fifteen minutes Ray's Dad sat there pieceful and content as a Mule human could . The Judge was very upset and so were the other parents as they stepped away from the monster sitting in a chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;You see Judge what it does if you ask!&quot; said Ray.<br />
<br />
&quot;I order you to change him back right now!&quot; yelled the panic struck Judge.<br />
<br />
Ray took the Medallion and holding it up he was about to say the words. Suddenly Ray's Mother walked directly up to him and whispered something in his ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, no really, are you sure?' asked a stunned Damn'it Ray.<br />
<br />
She smiled, and then Ray held up the medallion again and made his wish. &quot;I wish for my dad's head to be his normal human head, but when he gets mad or horny his Mule self will again take hold!&quot; said Ray as the judge grumbled behind him.<br />
<br />
Quickly the man's head returned to normal and he looked about wondering what just happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;You remember nothing?' asked the Judge sounding rather shaken.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, what, nothing happened we are all just sitting here and...?&quot; said Ray's Dad.<br />
<br />
&quot;I order you to wish that thing to change all those back to their original selves, and now!&quot; ordered the Judge.<br />
<br />
Ray looked at Bob and then to his tearful Mother's face.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, I wish that all those Bob and I wished to be other than what they were born as should regain his or her original appearance, now!&quot; said Ray as his Mother burst into tears.<br />
<br />
Shortly the Judges phone began to ring and ring as people lost in the animal kingdom went home. The Judge took the medallion in custody and released two boys to their parents. Ray smiled at Bob and then to his sad dear Mother. A wack to the back of his head had Daddy getting mad at his dumb Son.<br />
<br />
On the way home Ray's Father began telling how he was going to punish Damn'it Ray but the closer they got toward home the slower the car went till at the entrance to their driveway it stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hee Haw!&quot; said Ray's Dad as his Mother whirled around and looked her Husband in the face.<br />
<br />
Quickly the Mule spell worked and as faster than before his head changed but so also did the rest of him become a hardy male Mule.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wished everybody to be back to normal, how come?&quot; asked Ray's Mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, I wished that everybody Bob and I wished to be would change back! Mom that leaves still a few I changed, and that Bob changed, and those continue on as the animals we thought they looked as best. Now when Dad gets mad which is almost daily, or gets horny for his sweety then he becomes a Mule!&quot; announced Ray with a grin.<br />
<br />
Daddy HeeHawed till he was let out the car. A happy mule went about grazing down the tall grass at the end of the driveway. Ray jumped into the driver's seat and he with Mom roared up the drive to the happy farm house.<br />
<br />
Over on Pitcher street a dappled gray stallion has lost the best asshole he ever owned. Sitting flat on his original butt is one Ken who owned the medallion recently. The acrid taste of horseshit still in his mouth he shakes himself in unbelief, happy to be human once again.</p>
