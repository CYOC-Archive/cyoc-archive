<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ah sure am ready for mah change!&quot;  Ricky yelled.<br />
<br />
Simon propped his booted feet on the desk and leaned back to watch his <br />
friend's newest change.  After spitting in his Coke can, he <br />
instinctively reached into his back pocket where he knew he'd find a <br />
tin of Copenhagen.  Packing it hard, he pulled out a fresh pinch and <br />
added it to his already bulging lip.  He had to squeeze to get his <br />
mouth to close, but the nicotine rush felt so damn good.<br />
<br />
Ricky, meanwhile, felt his body convulsing.  First, with a slight <br />
sucking sound, all his hair retreated into his head, leaving a <br />
gleaming black dome in its place.  As he reached up to feel his now <br />
bald scalp, he felt his face brushed with pit hair.  Ricky did a <br />
double-take and saw that his pits were full of kinky, bushy hair.  He <br />
tried putting his arm down and realized that he could still see the <br />
pit hair even when his arm was against his chest.  He also noticed a <br />
strong smell wafting out from under his arm.  He sniffed his pit and <br />
smelled a massive amount of B.O.  It smelled like he had been <br />
exercising hard and hadn't bothered to shower in 2-3 days.  He smiled <br />
and licked his plump lips, realizing that only 10 minutes ago, this <br />
smell would have repulsed him.  Now he had the strongest desire to <br />
suck on the long, unruly hair streaming out of his pits.<br />
<br />
Before he had a chance to do so, though, he felt his body shake again.  <br />
His muscles were expanding.  As he looked in the mirror, he saw that <br />
he didn't have the toned muscles of a bodybuilder, but rather the <br />
rough, uncut muscles of a laborer--someone who had spent his life <br />
lifting heavy boxes and pieces of equipment.<br />
<br />
Tattoos began tracing their way down his arms and up his back.  <br />
Although the black ink was barely visible against his ebony skin, he <br />
could make out pictures of guys 69ing on each enormous pec.  Each arm <br />
was a riot of tribal swirls from the shoulder to the wrist.  &quot;At least <br />
Ah can still cover them tatts up to work,&quot; he thought before noticing <br />
that his knuckles were also tattoed.  His left hand spelled &quot;SKIN&quot; and <br />
his right hand spelled &quot;THUG&quot; in clear letters.<br />
<br />
Angrily, he turned to Simon to ask him why he'd made that change when <br />
a new thought struck him.  Of course, his knuckles spelled &quot;SKIN <br />
THUG.&quot;  That's what he was.  He realized that he was a skinhead thug--<br />
not a racist one--that would be too bizarre.  But he knew that he'd <br />
always been fascinated by the skinhead look and had decided to become <br />
one.<br />
<br />
As he thought this, a wifebeater appeared on his chest, only barely <br />
covering the images of guys fucking each other, but leaving the tribal <br />
work on his arms in full view.  Bleached jeans formed on his legs, and <br />
a pair of loose braces hung from the loops on the jeans.  He felt his <br />
feet and calves constrict slightly as a pair of shiny, polished 20-<br />
hole Dr. Martens encased them.  <br />
<br />
He bent down to caress them, reveling in the feel of the leather, when <br />
he noticed that something on his face was hitting the boots.  Looking <br />
at the mirror again, he saw a thick, 6&quot; goatee hanging off his chin.  <br />
There was no moustache, and the hair beneath his lips seemed to flow <br />
on forever.  &quot;Kinda like mah pits,&quot; he thought, chuckling.  He also <br />
saw that his ears had been pierced multiple times, and a large septum <br />
ring hung from his nose, taking the place of where a moustache would <br />
have been.<br />
<br />
He turned to Simon.  &quot;Dang, dawg, tha' be it?&quot;  He saw his friend spit <br />
into his can again and felt a sudden urge to do the same.  He then <br />
realized that he'd been mumbling a bit and his mouth was full.  <br />
Turning to his right, he spit, smiling at the stream of brown juice <br />
that went from his mouth to the brass spittoon that had appeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah'm a dippin' skinhead?&quot;  he asked.<br />
<br />
Simon nodded.  &quot;Yessuh, suh, ya are. Ah c'dn't be th' only dipper <br />
aroun' hyar, so Ah made yo' one too. Yo' also smoke cigars--th' mo' <br />
trimenjus an' blacker, th' better. Jest like yo'.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mofo, yo' accent be stronger now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon nodded.  &quot;Yessuh. Ah reckon it's some af'ereffecks of th' <br />
change. Didn't yo' notice thet Ah was naked befo'e an' now I've got <br />
boots, jeans, a shirt, an' a cowpoke hat?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ricky looked at Simon and saw that he was right.  Where his friend had <br />
been naked before, he now had on a pair of camouflage boots that when <br />
halfway up his calves.  Wrangler jeans so tight that Ricky could see <br />
every crease in Simon's cock were tucked into the top of the jeans, <br />
his beer gut spilling over the top of the jeans just a bit.  A belt <br />
buckle the size of Ricky's now-larger hand held up the jeans, and  a <br />
plaid shirt was tucked into the top of them.  On his head, he sported <br />
a black cowboy hat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Git yo' big ass up and turn yo'self around,&quot; Ricky commanded.  Simon <br />
complied, and Ricky saw a worn can ring in his friend's back pocket.  <br />
He looked at his own backside in the mirror and saw a similar ring in <br />
his own bleached jeans.  &quot;Yo, what we be doing now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Howsabout we hoof it out an' show our new-fangled selves to th' <br />
world?&quot;  Simon replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;That be a good idea, mofo!&quot;  Ricky said, lighting up the 14&quot; cigar he <br />
found behind his ear, without taking out his dip.<br />
<br />
They strutted out the front door, ready to meet the world as their new <br />
selves.  Simon brought along the Chronivac to see what they could do <br />
with it as they walked.</p>
