<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tony looked around, taking in all the people he barely knew. The cliques had already started forming. The Nerdy Gamers. The Jocks. All of the groups… especially the most well known; The ‘Cool Girls’.<br />
<br />
Tony often had his eyes glued on them. The fact that they were all bitchy and borderline brain-dead couldn’t stop Tony from admiring them. Whether anyone would truly admit it or not, they were all hot.<br />
Tony knew the names of a couple of them, including Katy Stevens, Presley Young, and Alyssa Tyrell (the sister of Petra Tyrell, the (now) very fat girl from the bus).<br />
<br />
Tony was very tempted to enter their names into his phone, but refrained, knowing that people might see him. So he slid his phone into his pocket and made his way into school.<br />
In classic Tony fashion, he managed to bump into a boy. He was very defensive, but Tony profusely apologised, making the guy say ‘it’s fine, bro. Just watch where you’re going.’ Tony felt very anxious, trying not to bump into anyone else.<br />
He arrived at his first class, which was Math. Tony wasn’t too great at Math, but then again, neither was anyone else in the class.<br />
Tony decided that he wanted to mess around in this class, especially since he knew he wasn’t going to pay much attention anyways. So he scoped out his classmates for anyone interesting to ‘play’ with.<br />
<br />
Then it hit him… this was the perfect class, and he was looking for the wrong people. Not his classmates… his teacher!<br />
“Good morning, class,” Mrs Reine said, watching as all her students looked up for a total of one second, then back down to whatever else they were doing.<br />
Mrs Reine was somewhat young, definitely in her late thirties, but younger than most of the other teachers. She had dark hair and classes and everything like that, but her most notable feature would be the fact that she was currently pregnant.<br />
If Tony’s memory served him well, he knew she was around 5 months pregnant. This didn’t make her belly huge, but it was definitely noticeable, especially with her choice of sweaters.<br />
Tony wanted to test it out, typing the name ‘Madeline Reine’ into his phone, then generating a sentence,<br />
<br />
‘Madeline Reine is five months pregnant with her first pair of twins.’<br />
<br />
Twins? That’s odd, Tony didn’t even realise… maybe there’s a chance Mrs Reine didn’t even know it was twins. But he knew exactly where he could mess with the sentence. He questioned whether this could potentially harm the baby inside of her, but came to the conclusion that if Morgana and Petra’s clothes grew with their rapid weight gain, then surely her body would adapt to the change. But if it all went wrong, Tony could always change it back to twins. He changed ‘twins’ to ‘quintuplets’, then he pressed enter.<br />
He looked back up and suddenly saw that Mrs Reine’s belly had grown significantly. She was also holding her back with one hand to support herself. She sat herself down in her chair, letting out a sign of relief.<br />
Tony jumped at the opportunity to generate a new sentence,<br />
<br />
‘Madeline Reine can hardly handle the sheer size of her belly.’<br />
<br />
Tony’s bulge began to bulge as he immediately saw the perfect opportunity to change the sentence, switching ‘belly’ for ‘breasts’, he pressed enter with excitement.<br />
He looked up, seeing Mrs Reine’s breasts had suddenly blow up to the size of watermelons, balanced on top of her already huge belly. He was trying pretty hard to hide his boner. He knew this was wrong, the class hadn’t even started and his teacher already looked like something you’d find in a fruit-market. He had to change her at least one more time, then he’d switch over the focus to someone else.<br />
He took a breath, then generated a brand new sentence,<br />
<br />
‘Madeline Reine is struggling to cope with the pressure in her breasts.’<br />
<br />
No way… her breasts… were filled with… milk…<br />
Tony was already ready to burst. He had to compose himself. He turned his phone off and sat there, calming himself down. He took a moment and decided to wait until everyone in the class had arrived. He looked around, noticing a number of people he could definitely use this app on, but he had a focus. He knew what he must do next. He had to contain his ‘excitement’.<br />
Mrs Reine had to stand up in order to write onto the white-board. She was clearly having a hard time doing that with such weight on her torso.<br />
Tony pulled out his phone, took one deep, deep breath, and changed the world ‘struggling’ to ‘failing’.<br />
<br />
He looked up and watched as suddenly, Mrs Reine’s breasts began to slowly pump milk right into her sweater, causing two quickly growing dark stains started forming from the liquid being produced. As it would turn out, Mrs Reine didn’t even notice the ‘leakage’, which prompted Letitia Wilson, one of the dorky girls from the front of the class, to suddenly announce it to the class.<br />
“Mrs Reine, you seem to be… dripping…” she said, causing Mrs Reine to look down. Immediately shrouded in embarrassment, Mrs Reine tried to cover up,<br />
“I’m so sorry class!” She said, covering both breasts with her arms, “this is the third time this week…” she said, “I’ll tell you,” she started, going on her classic oversharing rambles, “we’re still not entirely sure why I started producing so much, but it seems to be something to do with the quintuplets,”<br />
Half the class groaned, the other half cringed, and the remaining number were most likely into it. <br />
Mrs Reine stopped talking, realising that her breasts had actually started dripping onto the carpet. She quickly walked out of the classroom, most likely to grab something to help her contain her leaking breasts.<br />
<br />
And with that, the class was left unattended. Which only lead to half the class beginning to talk very loudly,<br />
“That was like, totally gross!” Katy Stevens (one of the popular girls) said to her current boyfriend, Max Clayton,<br />
“She’s a total turn off with that whole pregnancy thing,” Max said, judgmentally.<br />
<br />
“I’d never get pregnant,” Mandy White said to her best friend, Troy Hunter,<br />
“Definitely, lucky I’ll never have that problem!” Troy replied, laughing at her. Her was famously gay, and was very vocal about it. Tony never had an issue with it, but could definitely play around with it.<br />
<br />
Tony could hear all sorts of conversations happening… he had so much potential for mischief!</p>
