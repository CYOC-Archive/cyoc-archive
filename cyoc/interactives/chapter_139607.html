<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sports bra, hygiene stuff, leggings, and a pair of non-scuff tennis shoes packed into a pink and purple backpack, Jessica stopped as she was about to leave her room. Gazing at the remote, she wondered if she should take it with just in case anything went wrong, &quot;Such as I completely louse things up and people notice I&#39;m not who I say I am,&quot; she thought. Reaching for her purse, still in awe at how much had changed, she half-tripped, half-walked over to the desk and pick up the transmitter.<br />
<br />
Since getting used to walking in high-heels, finding the more she did so, the more she quickly figured how to place her feet, Jessica started to unplug the USB connector, but stopped. Toying with the idea of going back into the programme and adding more stuff to the save file to help her pass, she considered how her male mind was still dominant and that she had very little female intuition and thoughts and general know-how. Shuddering at the thought of what might happen if she gave herself over completely to Jessica, Jeff hastily unplugged the remote and opening her purse, started to put it inside, but stopped. Staring at the contents, make-up, house keys, a folding-billfold-type wallet, a cellphone and some weird elongated things wrapped in plastic that had the word Tampax written on them in pink, she wondered what the heck she was supposed to do with the make-up and the Tampax things and again wondered if maybe she should tweak things a smidge.<br />
<br />
A quick glance at the computer and seeing the time, she huffed, &quot;No time for that,&quot; as he saw the time and dropping the transmittor in her purse, she zipped it and slung it and her pack over one shoulder.<br />
<br />
Outside her room, she was greeted by a silent house and wondering what her mom would say, but figuring that if the programme did what it should do, she would be the only one aware of the changes, Jessica tottered down the hall. To her surprise, when she reached the living room, she found her aunt Carol sitting on the couch reading. Taken aback by this, she was caught by surprise when her aunt looked at her and asked, &quot;Going for tryouts?&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure what to say, and why the woman was here and not her mom, Jessica nodded and said, &quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; to which aunt Carol smiled and told her, &quot;Good luck. If my sister, your mom, was still alive, I am sure she would be proud of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aghast at what she was hearing, Jessica shyly said, &quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; as she adjusted the straps on her purse and backpack.<br />
<br />
Hastily turning away before aunt Carol could read what was on her face, Jeff headed for the front door. Overwhelmed by a number emotions and feeling like he might cry, thinking, &quot;This isn&#39;t what I wanted,&quot; he stepped out side and as the hundred degree sweltering heat hit him, he considered finding a quiet place to change back.<br />
<br />
After a couple minutes of reminding himself the change wasn&#39;t permanent and that it was only for a couple hours, Jeff regained some composure and slipping back into what he was starting to think as the female mindset, Jessica stepped away from the house and began making her way, at first on tottering footsteps, toward Jefferson-Baker high school, her footing getting more assured as she went.<br />
<br />
When she reached the school, she went around towards the larger of the field. Spotting a group of thirty or more girls all sitting on the bleaches, she almost stopped and turned around. But, after a couple more deep, calming breathes, she walked over, noting how the ones in skirts and dresses where sitting as she went, and sitting down so that her legs were firmly closed and one leg tugged behind the other, she listened to the other girls chatting. After a moment, a girl sat down next to her and dropping a pack on the ground, she asked, &quot;You new here?&quot; and before Jessica could say anything, the girl stuck out a hand and said, &quot;I&#39;m Tanya.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, feeling overwhelmed, wanting to point out she wasn&#39;t new, but thinking maybe something of her reality had changed, Jessica took the other girl&#39;s hand and shaking it, said, &quot;I&#39;m Jessica.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tanya about to say something, she was cut off when a sharp whistle blew. Glancing in the direction, she watched as Coach Erica Gillian strode across the field. Stopping, she took them all in and then said, &quot;You are all here for tryouts for the cheerleading squad, right,&quot; to which most nodded. Blowing her whistle, she announced, &quot;I cannot hear you. If you are going to be a part of this squad, you need to be heard. Now. You are all here for tryouts for cheerleading, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
This time, everyone acknowledging, Coach Gillian smiled and said, &quot;Good,&quot; then starting to pace up and down, she began giving a speech on what it meant to be a cheerleader for Jefferson-Baker high school. How it required discipline, willingness and a positive attitude. Finishing with, &quot;And, you must understand. Should you make the squad, dedication is key. I don&#39;t want anyone that isn&#39;t going to stick around. Each girl is chosen at the start of their high school career and is expected to stick around. That means, from age sixteen to nineteen, from grades eleven through fourteen, you will cheerleaders. Stick with it, and it will pay off, especially if you plan on going to college afterward. If this is not for you, leave now. Otherwise, baring accidents, you will be expected to be on the squad each year.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica, listening to this, found it made sense now why it seemed that the cheerleaders each year, when she&#39;d attending high school, always seemed to be the same group of girls. Watching as a couple girls got up and left, whilst a subtle buzz of excitement began to rise, Jessica jumped when Coach Gillian blew her whistle and stated, &quot;The team will consist of nine chosen girls. To those who make it, congratulations. Now. I want you all in the showers and back out on the field in twenty minutes,&quot; and blowing her whistle, she turned and marched back across the field.<br />
<br />
Suddenly realising he would have to shower in front of a bunch of girls, Jeff balked at the idea, certain they would notice something. But then Tanya said, &quot;I hope I make the team. I&#39;m so glad you stuck around, as you look like someone who could definitely make the cut. And if we both make the squad, we&#39;ll have at least one person we know, right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Absently nodding as she stood, Jessica smiled and said, &quot;Right,&quot; as she began following the other girls toward the locker room.<br />
<br />
Inside, scared she would do something stupid or foolish, Jessica headed for a locker, surreptitiously watching the other girls as she did so. Dumping her pack and purse in the locker, noting as she did that Tanya had taken the locker on her left, she hesitated at first before reaching up her dress and pulling off her underwear as Tanya removed her shirt, then her bra, exposing a pair of C cup breasts. Starting to grow comfortable, Jessica unbuttoned the front of her dress and stepping out of it, as Tanya removed her shoes, pants and underwear, chatting away as she did so, Jessica hung the garment in the locker. Struggling to keep of with Tanya&#39;s line of chatter, giving replies she hoped were appropriate, Jessica tossed her underwear inside the locker, removed her bra and shivered as she took out of her backpack her hygiene stuff.<br />
<br />
With a bang, Tanya slammed her locker and following suit, Jessica started towards the showers. Hoping it all worked out, she had what she considered a male moment as she stepped towards the shower, surrounded by other naked girls. Noting the different size breasts, all either B or C cups, how most had shaved or trimmed their crotch hair, she thought, &quot;I have never seen this many headlights and muffs in my life time. If I had a dick, I&#39;d be sporting a raging hard on.&quot; Taking a deep breath, still idly talking with Tanya, who was carrying most of the conversation, Jessica reached out and flipping on the shower, she stepped under the cold spray of water and began to wash herself, still watching what other girls did as she did so.</p>
