<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Fukushu furrowed his brow, watching intently as both Mason and Raiden trained. Since the conclusion of the war, the fearsome nine tail made it a priority to prepare both Mason and Raiden for future battles. For Fukushu, peace was temporary and considering even now some kitsune resistance pockets existed meant eventually both his nephew and his son would be pressed into battle once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Raiden,&quot; Fukushu barked. &quot;Your stance is too open! Center your sword and maintain balance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Raiden nodded, the cousins once more clashing with wooden swords. For the young kitsune, these training periods were difficult. Mason was physically older, despite the pair being the same age. It meant Raiden was forced into a defensive position more often against the teenage human. Something his father was none to pleased with.<br />
<br />
Another clash of wooden blades echoed through the training grounds. Raiden doing his best to land a blow before Mason struck the kitsune in the shoulder, causing the young celestial to wince.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop,&quot; Fukushu bellowed, shaking his head. &quot;Once again you lost focus. You must learn control Raiden. In battle your enemies will not hold back, you must focus completely and anticipate your opponents next action.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry dad I&#39;m trying,&quot; Raiden stated.<br />
<br />
Fukushu frowned, his eyes narrowed at his son. Raiden still had a long ways to go in becoming a competent warrior. He had hoped training with Mason would elevate his abilities.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon uncle he&#39;s trying,&quot; Mason said, coming to his cousin&#39;s defense. &quot;Cut him some slack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Raiden is the future celestial and leader of the kitsune,&quot; Fukushu countered. &quot;He must be ready to defend his people.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mason sighed, looking between Raiden and Fukushu. He could tell Raiden was trying his best, but the kit was still a novice. &quot;Uncle, can we speak in private?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; Fukushu snorted, turning to his son. &quot;Raiden, take a break. We will continue in a moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Raiden looked to protest, he could do this but quickly relented under his father&#39;s gaze. Jogging to the stands, the kit slumped into the bleachers, a defeated look on his face as he now took a drink of water. Now alone with Mason, Fukushu turned his steely gaze on his human nephew. &quot;Talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you&#39;re being too tough on Raiden,&quot; Mason stated. &quot;Can&#39;t you see how hard he&#39;s working? You&#39;re only making him feel worse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Raiden is my son nephew,&quot; Fukushu replied. &quot;And it is my duty as his father to prepare him for his role. I am not here to coddle the boy, especially in matters of war.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay yeah,&quot; Mason countered. &quot;But by kitsune standards he&#39;s still a kid. He has a lot of growing up ahead of him, probably decades. Aren&#39;t fathers also supposed encourage their sons as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what would you know of fathers nephew,&quot; Fukushu stated, causing Mason to wince.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay so I don&#39;t have a dad,&quot; Mason grumbled. &quot;But one of my mom&#39;s is Claudia and she&#39;s tough. As strict as she is, she sometimes has to dial it back just to show she cares. Maybe....maybe you could do something like that for Raiden. Just to show you care about him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu opened his mouth before quickly closing it and sighing. Perhaps Mason had a point. Raiden was still quite young by kitsune standards and considering his age, very accomplished. Grunting in annoyance, he now glowered at Mason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps you&#39;re right,&quot; he grumbled, snorting in annoyance. &quot;Although your optimistic and blissfully ignorant positivity can be irksome nephew, you do seem to have sage advice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure if I should be thankful or offended,&quot; Mason replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Possibly both,&quot; Fukushu said. &quot;I have been told far too often that I speak...bluntly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Glancing at his exhausted son, Fukushu now spoke, Raiden immediately raising his head. &quot;That will be enough training for the day son,&quot; he said. &quot;You have...done well. How would you like to go fishing with Mason and I before grabbing some desert?&quot; At this Raiden seemed to brighten, his tail wagging furiously behind him. As Fukushu and Mason looked to leave, two kitsune who Fukushu had waited patiently for arrived.<br />
<br />
&quot;Genki. Ikuro.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;General Fukushu,&quot; Ikuro replied, bowing before the nine tail general. &quot;I was told you wished to see me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As was I Lord Fukushu,&quot; Genki added. Fukushu paused, appraising the yellow furred kitsune.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did,&quot; Fukushu replied, before turning to Mason. &quot;Join Raiden in the grand stands. I will not be long.&quot; Mason nodded, jogging over to his coysin as Fukushu now paced in front of the pair of kitsune.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Fukushu began. &quot;I understand you have shown interest in both Kari and Haley.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Lord Fukushu,&quot; Genki replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you asked their mothers for permission to see them,&quot; Fukushu continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course General,&quot; Ikuro stated. &quot;It seemed like the proper thing to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And yet you did not ask me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ikuro and Genki paused, Mason almost certain he could see the blood drain from their vulpine faces. Fukushu now glared at Ikuro, the silver kitsune standing at attention. &quot;You wish to see my niece Haley romantically is that correct?&quot; Ikuro nodded as Fukushu turned to Genki. &quot;And you have shown interest in Kari.&quot; Once more the yellow kitsune nodded, causing Fukushu to scowl as he finished pacing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am disappointed in both of you,&quot; Fukushu stated. &quot;Ikuro, you should know that if you wish to date a superior officer&#39;s family, then you should seek the superior officer&#39;s permission.&quot; Ikuro gulped as Fukushu now turned to Genki.<br />
<br />
&quot;As for you Genki,&quot; Fukushu growled. &quot;While Kari is viewed as my niece, there is a secret that even she is not completely aware. Kari was once Hikari...my baby sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My Lord?&quot; Genki asked, completely befuddled.<br />
<br />
&quot;A spell by the demon queen Lilith wiped my sister Hikari&#39;s memories,&quot; Fukushu said. &quot;Changing her into Kari. While the girl is now mortal and reborn, a part of me still views her as my little sister. A sister who you now wish to see.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I...had no idea Lord Fukushu,&quot; Genki stammered.<br />
<br />
&quot;In either case you wish to see them,&quot; Fukushu continued. &quot;Without asking my permission. Therefore, as an uncle and as a brother...I must ensure that you are both capable of taking care of them.&quot; Fukushu now withdrew his katana, Ishi no katachi, assuming a fighting position as the ground seemed to crack beneath him. From the grand stands, Mason and Raiden watched an odd smirk crossing Mason&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Raiden,&quot; Mason grinned. &quot;Have you ever heard the expression, grab your popcorn?&quot; Raiden shook his head no as Mason leaned back. &quot;It means sit back and watch. Things are about to get very interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Genki&#39;s eyes grew wide, staring at the fearsome nine tail. What was going on? Yes, he and Kari were slowly growing closer, yet he never imagined he would have to fight Fukushu over this! He was no warrior, he was a scholar, an intellectual. It was what Kari appreciated about him. So many kitsune seemed to focus on war. Genki? Genki wished to teach, to mold the minds of the future kits, to create great works of literature for the young to read. Perhaps inspire those future generations to create something instead of destroying it in the flames of war.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I...don&#39;t even have a sword,&quot; Genki stammered.<br />
<br />
Fukushu raised an eyebrow, opening a portal of darkness that he now reached into. Quickly the nine tail kitsune withdrew a sword, which he now threw towards Genki.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you recognize this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Slowly Genki picked up the sword, the young three tails eyes growing damp with tears. This was his father Raizo sword. Gripping the hilt tightly, Genki thought of his recently deceased father.<br />
<br />
Raizo served for centuries in Fukushu&#39;s army. The seven tail a formidable and reliable soldier. More focused on his family than advancement through the officers core, Raizo was a seasoned veteran, a reliable soldier who took pride in training the newer kitsune in their duties as soldiers. As grateful as Raizo was for his position within the army, he wanted more for his son Genki.<br />
<br />
Raizo made it a priority to send Genki to the finest schools, to have his oldest son use his mind instead of his strength. He believed Genki could and would be better than him. It was those words that stuck with Genki. Especially after his father&#39;s death. In defense of the capital, Raizo rallied behind Fukushu as they charged Hinata’s rail guns. Fukushu was the only kitsune to survive.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you have one,&quot; Fukushu replied. &quot;Let us see if you are your father&#39;s equal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Genki,&quot; Ikuro whispered, the silver kitsune staring down Fukushu. &quot;Please tell me you know how to defend yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Barely,&quot; Genki replied. &quot;My father gave me lessons as a kit, but I am no warrior. I&#39;m a scholar.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know anything that can help?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve learned some minor healing and protection spells,&quot; Genki stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;That will have to do,&quot; Ikuro said. &quot;Follow my lead...and pray that the Death Fox is feeling merciful.&quot;<br />
<br />
A small grin now spread across Fukushu&#39;s face as Ikuro charged forward with Genki close behind. Assuming a defensive stance, the nine tail general deflected the three tail kitsunes attacks, parrying his blows. Although Ikuro was skilled, they paled in comparison to his own.<br />
<br />
As for Genki, the yellow three tail was doing his level best to contribute. The kitsune scholar could be described as a novice at best, his movements awkward and clumsy in comparison to Ikuro. Blocking their attacks, Fukushu delivered an open palm strike to Ikuro, sending the grey kitsune sprawling before delivering a roundhouse kick to Genki. The yellow furred kitsune tumbling backwards and landing in a heap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this the best you can do in defense of Kari and Haley,&quot; Fukushu asked, tightening the grip on his sword. &quot;Surely you can do better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Snarling, Ikuro darted forward, his strikes quick and precise. The grin on Fukushu&#39;s face only broadening, almost mockingly. Both Genki and Ikuro attacking furiously trying to land a single blow to no avail, while Fukushu delivered strikes to the young three tails. Elbows, punches, knees, kicks, all connecting with incredible force to the young kitsune leaving the pair bloodied and bruised.<br />
<br />
Collapsing once more Genki and Ikuro tried to catch their breath, their bodies throbbed in pain as they shakily got to their feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not give up,&quot; Fukushu asked. &quot;Neither of you have shown me you are capable of defending Kari or Haley. Surely there are other vixens who would be...more appropriate?&quot;<br />
<br />
With a primal yell, Ikuro sprinted towards Fukushu, his attack even faster, more powerful yet still unable to breach the fearsome kitsune&#39;s defense. Fukushu smirked. Against most foes, Ikur&#333;s prowess would win the day. Against Fukushu however, these attacks were more of a nuisance. Blocking a slashing attack, Fukushu locked the young kitsune&#39;s blade before delivering another open palm strike sending Ikuro sailing 15 feet backwards.<br />
<br />
With Ikuro down, the mighty nine tail now focused on the inexperienced Genki. Genki swung his blade, attempting to strike Fukushu. Instead, Fukushu deflected the blows, disarming Genki as the sword clattered to the floor. Now unarmed, Genki glared at the legendary warrior.<br />
<br />
With a roar he didn&#39;t think he had in him, Genki reared back throwing a punch straight at Fukushu&#39;s head. For the yellow three tail, he had never thrown a punch this hard. Thinking back, Genki could not recall ever throwing a punch at all. He was quiet, preferring to talk things out instead of resorting to violence. Now, he found himself throwing a punch fueled with rage at the head of his people&#39;s most revered warrior.<br />
<br />
Much to Genki&#39;s surprise, the punch connected. Genki&#39;s eyes going wide in shock and abject terror as Fukushu&#39;s head did not move. Instead the legendary nine tail watched as a single whisker now slowly fell from his nose, gently drifting towards the ground. Fukushu simply raised an eyebrow, his eyes locking with Genki who could only offer a meek reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
From the grandstand, Raiden and Mason winced as Fukushu struck Genki. Instead of punching the yellow kitsune though, Fukushu hit him with one of his nine tails. The sound echoing through the training grounds as the tail delivered a vicious gut punch, lifting Genki three feet into the air. Raiden wasn&#39;t even aware that a kitsune could use their tail in that manner. Before Genki could hit the ground, Fukushu&#39;s tail snapped like a whip sending Genki crashing to the ground next to Ikuro.<br />
<br />
Groaning in pain, Ikuro glanced at Genki, the three tailed kitsune gasping for air like a fish out of water. Grunting, Ikuro shakily stood once more, assisting Genki to his feet. The pair standing on legs that quivered like jelly as they tried to catch their breath. They weren&#39;t sure how much more they could take, yet if they truly cared for Haley and Kari they needed to try.<br />
<br />
Much to their surprise, Fukushu now held up his hand. &quot;Stop,&quot; he stated, sheathing his blade. &quot;That will do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Genki and Ikuro couldn&#39;t respond, let alone move as Fukushu appraised them. &quot;I wished to test your resolve,&quot; he stated. &quot;To see how far you would be willing to go to prove yourselves. Whether it be bravery or stupidity, you would not quit. You have my permission to see both Kari and Haley. It is apparent you care for them deeply.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu now turned to Mason and Raiden, a small smile on his face as he approached the pair. &quot;I think we have trained enough,&quot; he said. &quot;Let us go fishing.&quot;<br />
<br />
An excited cheer now escaped Raiden&#39;s lips as he raced to his father&#39;s side as the trio began to leave, only causing as Fukushu turned once more to Ikuro and Genki.<br />
<br />
&quot;One last thing,&quot; Fukushu said, his eyes narrowing at the two young three tails. &quot;If you break Kari and Haley&#39;s hearts, you will have to deal with me. And next time...I will not take it easy on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Fukushu left with Raiden and Mason, Genki and Ikuro stood there quiet for some time unable to believe what had just happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think the girls will say about this?&quot; Genki asked Ikuro.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think Haley will definitely be amazed that I lasted as long as I did against Lord Fukushu. What about you? What will Kari think?&quot; Ikuro now asked Genki.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think she&#39;ll be more concerned for my safety than anything. It&#39;s true what I said to Lord Fukushu, I am no warrior, but....I most certainly did find my resilience today.&quot; Genki said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You also can tell her you made a whisker on her uncle&#39;s face fall off.&quot; Ikuro said slightly socking him on the shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and I think she&#39;ll be even more surprised that he let me off a little easy. Now, I think I&#39;ll go meet up with Kari, she wanted to meet me in the library today.&quot; Genki said.<br />
<br />
&quot;As for me, Haley wanted me to teach her Kata. I believe she&#39;s waiting back at the training grounds.&quot; Ikuro said as now both he and Genki walked to see their girlfriends still feeling the bruises Fukushu had given them.</p>
