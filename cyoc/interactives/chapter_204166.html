<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;But, that will come later.&quot; Junia&#39;s words bring you back to the moment, and you look to her with renewed trepidation. You sigh as she continues, the vixen smirking at your obvious relief. &quot;For now, Moon will show you around the tower and grounds. Get you acquainted with your new home. Oh and...&quot; <br />
<br />
She stretches a hand out to you, murmuring a few phrases, and the collar around your neck loosens and falls off, the chain clattering on the hardwood floor. The witch settles back in her chair, infuriatingly smug.<br />
<br />
&quot;You won&#39;t be needing that. I trust you&#39;re not stupid enough to try to escape -- there are no free humans around, and it is literally impossible for you to pass through the barrier enchantment. My mark is enough to identify you for now -- and tomorrow I&#39;ll commission you a nice, unique collar to match your name. Off with you now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Coral!&quot; Moonstone says eagerly, grabbing your hand. You flinch from the strange feel of her animalistic hand, although the soft pads and fur are... actually rather pleasant. Regardless the white vixen pulls you along to begin your tour. As she shows off the tower, she practically gushes over how wonderful life here is -- and occasionally makes you blush with her lovingly lewd descriptions of how wonderful Junia is.<br />
<br />
The tower house is large, but not that large. First floor is mainly taken up by the front hall together with a dining room, kitchen and pantry, which has stairs going down to a basement. Passing back through the front room, you note that your Mistress (ugh) is now reading a book, still naked, though her prick has retreated back into its sheath. Agate has disappeared, and so have your old collar and chain leash.<br />
<br />
Moon falls quiet, not wanting to disturb her Mistress as she drags you up the stairs. The torrent breaks forth again once you&#39;re off the balcony overlooking the hall, the white vixen excitedly conducting you to Junia&#39;s room. The musky scent of fox is especially strong here, making you grimace -- but also, despite yourself, causing another stirring in your loins. Judging by how furiously her tail is going, Moon loves it, and she gives a fond gaze to the four-poster bed that dominates the room. There&#39;s also a large, over-stuffed pet bed on the floor. <br />
<br />
The second floor also contains Junia&#39;s personal library and workshop, the latter of which looks stereotypically witchy with a large cauldron sitting amidst shelves lined with strange and unsettling paraphernalia. There&#39;s also a couple of small spare bedrooms for guests, and a large bathroom. This is occupied by Agate, showering -- you assume; Moonstone unabashedly takes you inside, and says &quot;hi&quot; to her, but there is a drawn shower curtain that renders her an indistinct shadow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moon, please,&quot; issues a strained voice from behind the curtain, almost lost amidst the patter of water.<br />
<br />
In contrast to the over-all medieval feel and downright fantastical witch&#39;s lab, you&#39;ve seen some rather modern technology -- the bathroom and the smaller water-closets have toilets and plumbing, and the ktichen has a proper stove, albeit fueled by direct burning of coal.<br />
<br />
Honestly, under other circumstances, you&#39;d concede to the bubbly slut (unaffected by Agate&#39;s obvious bad mood as she continues the tour). This place is cool and you&#39;d love to visit, if not live here. What ruins it is that you don&#39;t have a choice. Never mind the future &quot;duties&quot; that twist up your guts with fear.<br />
<br />
The third floor has two main rooms, one empty, one for the witch&#39;s current &quot;pets.&quot; There are two more large pet beds, these ones customised -- Moonstone proudly points out how hers is white and has a midnight blue blanket decorated with moons and stars. Agate&#39;s is green with a black blanket laced with silver. Their names are stitched into the rims. There are also a few shelves with books and toys on them -- knotted dildos looking incongruous next to board games.<br />
<br />
Above this the tower narrows so that there&#39;s only one room apiece, and Moonstone ignores them, claiming them to &quot;probably be empty.&quot; But as the stairs come to an end and you emerge on the sixth floor, she pauses, beaming while catching her breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;And this... is the observatory!&quot; You blink, taking in the large telescope sitting on a tripod near a large window, a single shelf of books, stars charts pinned to the walls, and a globe on a table. &quot;Mistress refurbished it just for me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For... you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Moonstone giggles. &quot;Uh-huh! I&#39;ve always loved astrology -- or astronomy, as it&#39;s called in the human world. I had just about finished my astronomy major, in fact, when I and a few friends went hiking on vacation and -- ended up here!&quot;<br />
<br />
You stare at her. At the moment, you&#39;re more shocked at the intelligence she&#39;s revealed than horrified at the thought of the enslavement. &quot;R-really? And here I thought you were a --&quot; You cut yourself off, but Moonstone finishes for you.<br />
<br />
&quot;A bimbo?&quot; She giggles again. &quot;Silly Coral, just &#39;cause I&#39;m happy and slutty doesn&#39;t make me stupid! I accepted a long time ago that I was never going back -- why would I want to?&quot; She strokes her breasts lovingly. &quot;I&#39;m so pretty, and I feel <i>sooo</i>...&quot; She moans a bit before catching herself. &quot;Good. Heehee. I have no debt, no worries, no stress! Mistress takes cares of <i>everything</i> for us, and all we have to do in return is be ourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... huh.&quot; You feel like that&#39;s not quite the case. &quot;Don&#39;t you have to... obey her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well duh, but it&#39;s not like she tells us to do anything except fuck her!&quot; That was <i>kind</i> of what you meant, but in retrospect obviously the ebullient slut wouldn&#39;t see that as an issue. You highly doubt that she was always like this, though, and that makes you shiver. You&#39;re not sure what scares you more -- the obvious shame of Agate, or this cheerful submission. The thought that you could end up like Moonstone makes your skin crawl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is what we exist for! Really, Coral!&quot; She gives you an earnest look, apparently acknowledging for the first time that you aren&#39;t happy. &quot;Once you&#39;ve tasted Mistress&#39; cock -- <i>felt</i> it <i>inside</i> you! -- you&#39;ll understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;m afraid of,&quot; you mutter, folding your arms -- almost hugging yourself against the chill of fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, c&#39;mon.&quot; She runs her hand along your arm, but you shudder and resist her attempt to take your hand again. &quot;Come on, Coral. I want you to see the view.&quot;<br />
<br />
You sigh. No point taking this out on the slave. It&#39;s not really her fault that her mind is so warped. &quot;Fine.&quot; You don&#39;t take her hand, but you do follow her to another large window, a smaller telescope resting on the broad, low sill. Moon pushes open the latticed glass, letting in the breeze and giving you a clear view of a large, medievalesque town, light grey castle rising on the far side of it. You&#39;re at the very edge of the east side of town, and from this high up, you can take in almost the whole metropolis, and the farms and fields around it.<br />
<br />
Pedda, you remember they called it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t it beautiful?&quot; she asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess.&quot; It is. For those who like old-time stuff - which you do. If only you weren&#39;t here as a sex slave. As with the tower, it&#39;s impossible to appreciate this fantasy land under the weight of that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now the other side.&quot; She leads you across the room, and opens the window there. Before you stretches a large forest, all the way to the misty blue horizon.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s beautiful too, isn&#39;t it? But, it&#39;s also impassable. At least to us. Humans come in -- we don&#39;t go out. I&#39;m not sure if the barrier is literally impenetrable from the inside, but there&#39;s no getting past the guards anyway. I&#39;ve heard of a dozen escape attempts since I got here, and read of a lot more. All ended... well, &#39;badly.&#39;&quot; She smiles wryly. &quot;Depending on your point of view. Now I&#39;ve got one last thing to show you up here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-mmmph!&quot; She spins you towards her with dizzying quickness, and before you know it her lips meet yours. Your arms have relaxed a bit in surprise, and she pries your hands from between you so that she can press her body into yours, setting your hands on her hips before releasing them to hug you close to her. She makes no attempt to further the kiss, her lips just brushing yours; but her (at least) D-cup boobs squishing into your chest is more than enough intimacy to get your blood flowing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Touch me,&quot; she whispers. &quot;Pet me, Coral. Feel how soft.&quot;<br />
<br />
And -- you find you can&#39;t resist. There&#39;s a smell in your nostrils, foxy but somehow sweet, and it encourages you to run her hands over her back, her plush curves. Her fur <i>is</i> soft, and so is the flesh beneath. Your hands end up on her ass, fingers sinking into the round cheeks, her tail slapping against your fingers. You start to melt into the kiss...<br />
<br />
But then you feel something hot and hard rubbing against your own manhood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah!&quot; You jump away as if you&#39;d been stung, your face beet red as your hands fly down to hide your erect shaft. You stare at her own delicate pink cock, barely seeing her shake her head in amusement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, just as it was getting good,&quot; she pretends to pout.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what... why&#39;d you do that!? Why do you have a cock, anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To loosen you up, silly. To help you understand how <i>good</i> it is to be a vixen who only has to think about sex. And Mistress already said. &quot; She sticks her tongue out, maddeningly cute. &quot;She gives me a cock every now and then so I can squirt out my sweet load for her. Ahh...&quot; She reaches down, squeezing her length, then gathering up the pre-cum. &quot;See?&quot; She holds her hand out to you, making you recoil. But a mild odour of sugar reaches you. Giggling, she sticks her figures in her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s actually just thicker femcum, I don&#39;t have any balls,&quot; she explains. &quot;And yup! Very sweet, which reminds me, I have one last thing to show you. Come on!&quot;<br />
<br />
She reaches out, but you evade her damp fingers. She bleps you again, then leads the way down the stairs. &quot;Oh, I suppose we do have some duties besides being beautiful and pleasuring Mistress. We&#39;ve gotta keep the place clean, and I do the cooking. Can you cook? It would be nice to have some help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Yeah, actually.&quot; As long as you&#39;re here, you may as well make her workload lighter, you figure. However, despite her words, you&#39;re still determined to try and escape. &quot;Just... don&#39;t get so handsy in the kitchen, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Teehee! No promises! Though I won&#39;t stick my dick in you -- until you&#39;re fully changed, only Mistress can do that! &#39;Sides, I won&#39;t have it much longer, the spell is temporary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Uh-huh...&quot; <i>This is so fucking weird and messed up.</i><br />
<br />
~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br />
<br />
The white vixen leads you down and out a back door into a large, well-kept garden. She points out a rather disused looking well and a toolshed that used to be an outhouse, which makes you ask about the plumbing. In turn she reminds you that plumbing&#39;s been around for ages. In fact the beastmen have an industrial level of tech, they just don&#39;t want to pollute their city-state and &quot;I guess magic isn&#39;t effective at generating electricity on a large scale.&quot; You&#39;re still disoriented a bit at how smart Moonstone can be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, here&#39;s what you actually need to see.&quot; Behind the garden is a stable and carriage house, with a cobble drive disappearing around the tower. She takes you inside the stable, and you blink as you realise, first, that this is more like a person&#39;s house than a barn, and second that there is in fact a person here!<br />
<br />
A seven-foot-plus horse woman to be exact, well-muscled and even more well-endowed. You gape at her head-sized breasts a minute -- like you, she&#39;s bare naked -- before taking in the details of her coat. She&#39;s a brownish-red, with a black mane and long silky tail, and a white blaze down her muzzle. Which is currently smiling at the pair of you as she lays aside the book she&#39;s been reading.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Chessie!&quot; Moonstone bounces up to her and hugs her as she rises from a faded old armchair, the vixen literally burying her muzzle in the mare&#39;s cleavage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Moon,&quot; she replies warmly, hugging the vixen back. &quot;Who&#39;s this with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Moonstone pulls away to make introductions. &quot;She&#39;s Mistress&#39; latest pleasure slave! Her name&#39;s Coral; Mistress just bought her today, so I&#39;m showing her around. Coral, this is Chestnut, Mistress&#39; carriage horse -- but we all call her Chessie. She also takes care of the garden and anything else that needs muscle!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C-carriage horse?&quot; you stutter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmhm.&quot; The mare points to several intricate leather harnesses hanging on the back wall. &quot;I&#39;m strong enough to pull a light carriage with a couple of passengers. Having slave-drawn vehicles is a mark of prestige, even for wizards who could get around faster with magic. Mostly, though, I&#39;m the gardener.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought... um... all of us were here for... sex.&quot; Your voice gets progressively lower. The mare shakes her head; she looks sympathetic, but does not comment, just answering your &quot;question.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was, at first. A stallion lord bought me decades ago. But he passed on and his son didn&#39;t feel like taking me into his bed, so he sold me to Mistress Junia. She has a stallion slave come by once a week to take care of my... needs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Needs?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For cum, silly!&quot; interjects Moonstone. &quot;Mistress <i>told</i> you that beast cum is addictive! It doesn&#39;t <i>have</i> to be the same species that turned you, but it&#39;s a lot more effective for the cravings. Meantime though; it is time for your treat, Chessie!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Treat?&quot; you echo, head whirling.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll see, dear,&quot; says the mare, amused. She nudges Moonstone back to make room, then kneels down, bending her massive frame forward to... <i>oh.</i> You blush as she begins to nuzzle and lick at Moonstone&#39;s sheath, pausing to give you another sympathetic glance. &quot;No dear, don&#39;t look away. I know how... wrong this may seem to you, but slaves have no need for shame. The sooner you get used to it, the better.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod. You&#39;re not sure if you agree, or if you just find the sight of the large mare orally servicing the vixen too hot to look away from. Moonstone begins playing with her breasts, panting as her cock slips out only to be inhaled by the equine muzzle. Chessie strokes the vixen&#39;s hips, then slips a few large fingers into Moon&#39;s dripping snatch. Again you find yourself hiding an erection as you watch the horse drive the fox to a screaming orgasm. The mare first swallows down the load from Moon&#39;s cock, then sets to work licking the juice from her cunny and thighs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Delicious,&quot; Chessie finally declares. &quot;As always.&quot; She gets heavily to her feet, pausing to give Moonstone a kiss. The vixen giggles, licking at her nose to steal a taste of her own cum from what the mare left behind. &quot;Thank you for the treat, dear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome, Chess!&quot; Moon hugs her again, then bounces back to you, taking your hand and leading you out of the stable. Your last view of the mare is of her sinking back into her old armchair, rubbing at her own engorged nipples and licking her lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Told you my cum was sweet! Almost like liquid sugar! As long as I have a cock, I let Chessie suckle it every day -- it&#39;s a lot more fun than having her eat plain old sugar from my hand!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could you not,&quot; you plead as you reenter the tower, horrified at the idea of giving a person treats like an animal, regardless of how they look. Never mind that Chestnut was presumably a human once. But Moonstone just giggles, again.<br />
<br />
She leads you back into the front hall, where Junia is waiting for you. The witch&#39;s amber eyes transfix you immediately as you enter. You feel like she&#39;s aware of everything you&#39;ve said and done, and shrink into yourself.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re all finished with the tour, Mistress!&quot; Moonstone proclaims -- unnecessarily, you feel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good job, Moon,&quot; the witch acknowledges. Then to you she says, &quot;So Coral, I trust she got you properly worked up?&quot;<br />
<br />
You do a double-take, not expecting her to ask that at all. The witch&#39;s piercing gaze tracks you as Moon guides you around to stand in front of her. And once you do, your heart sinks as you see her long, thick shaft at full mast. Your reprieve, it seems, is going to end much sooner than you hoped. The witch smirks.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, slave. Now that you&#39;ve had a look round, it&#39;s time to begin your new life in earnest.&quot; She puts a hand on her cock, making her hiss in pleasure, even that light touch causing it to shudder out a thick gob of pre which she rubs along her length. &quot;Now... come... here.&quot;<br />
<br />
The stench of her slams into you as you move stiffly to obey. A strange blend of male and female, of musk and perfume, of <i>fox.</i> It&#39;s repellent, and yet; your mind is drawn back to that hypnotic spell, the scent sinking into your brain. The smell of <i>power</i> -- a power you, helpless human, <i>can&#39;t</i> resist. Heat fills you as you fail to resist, that hungry void opening in your lower belly again, your cock jerking fitfully up as it engorges against your will.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kneel.&quot;<br />
<br />
Teeth grinding, you get on your knees between her spread legs, practically drowning in her scent. Unable to look away from her massive, knotted red organ and the large, smooth-furred pouch, taut with her seed-swollen balls, taunting you. Tantalising you. You can&#39;t believe it... it&#39;s so <i>disgusting</i> and yet... part of you is captivated by how virile she looks and smells. How this female is a bigger man than you could hope to be.<br />
<br />
And then she gives the order you dread.<br />
<br />
&quot;Suck.&quot;</p>
<hr/><h3>
If you obey, what will change?</h3>
