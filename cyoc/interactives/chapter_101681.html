<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Let&#39;s see what your life would be as a high-school jock,&quot; Evelyn said with an incrutable grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;What??&quot;, exclaimed Liam as he felt a peculiar tingle passing through his body. &quot;I just escaped from high school! And do I look like a jock to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet,&quot; smile Jeremy, smiling with eager anticipation.<br />
<br />
Liam had a strange sensation, like his body was inflating. Frozen in position and unable to move his head, he glanced down and felt dizzy, as if the floor were rushing away from him. He could barely see his shoes, as the chest of his shirt was puffing outward. His eyes grew wide and he looked back at Evelyn and Jeremy, who both seemed quite entertained by what they were seeing.<br />
<br />
As the throbbing of Liam&#39;s body intensified, he looked frantically around the room and noticed a full-length mirror on the wall. In it, he could see his reflection and became transfixed by what it showed him. It wasn&#39;t just his imagination; his body actually was growing taller and bulking up. His navy blue polo shirt was tightening around his torso, conforming to the contours of his emerging pecs as the sleeves stretched around newly bulging biceps. The tail of his shirt crept upward, exposing his pale, flat stomach, while his skinny jeans were growing tighter as the cuffs exposed more and more of the pink-and-gray argyle socks he wore under his penny-loafers. <br />
<br />
Open-mouthed, Liam returned his gaze to Evelyn and Jeremy, his mind racing with a thousand questions but his mouth boiling them down to a single word: &quot;How?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t sweat it, bro,&quot; Jeremy said reassuringly. &quot;Just go with the flow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Somehow, Jeremy&#39;s words soothed Liam&#39;s anxiety. Why should he be so panicked? After all, he was gaining the kind of body that had fueled his teenage masturbatory fantasies. Much as he loathed the dumb jocks in high school, they had been responsible for countless hundreds of awkward hard-ons over the years. As he returned his eyes to the mirror, he was stunned to discover that even his face was changing. The remaining baby fat on his boyish face appeared to melt away, revealing high cheekbones and a firm jawline, and his straight brown hair grew lighter as it gained body. He noticed some flexibility returning to his body as his head turned back and forth in dismay. His fingertips prickled with energy as they wiggled back to life, and soon the numbness had dissipated from his whole body. <br />
<br />
Liam felt the desperate need to stretch, as if waking from a long satisfying nap. He extended his arms as far as he could, reveling in the strange sensation of his biceps and chest muscles flexing. His shirt rose up in the front, displaying a tight six-pack. His waistline remained slim, but his belt had popped open and his fly was gradually unzipping itself to accommodate a bulge in his underpants which grew larger with each moment that Liam studied his new body.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you feel, Liam?&quot;, Evelyn asked. <br />
<br />
Her voice snapped Liam out of his blissful state.  He struggled to put his feelings into words, his mind sorting through a surprisingly  limited vocabulary . &quot;I feel...awesome!&quot;, he declared, unconsciously tightening his gut and straightening his posture to show off his full height of 5&#39; 11&quot;, having sprouted a full five inches. He walked toward the mirror for a better look at himself, his broad shoulders shifting with each confident stride. His body bristled with a nervous energy unlike any he had felt before, as if he needed to stay in contant motion to feel comfortable. His brown eyes had brightened to a magnetic pale blue, and he stroked his hand across his smooth cheek. Although he had become much more masculine in appearance, his features still had the slight gawky mismatch of youth, as if he was still a few years away from growing fully into his looks. He brushed a hand through the waves of his dirty blond hair, which now hung over his ears and draped down to his shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;How old am I?&quot;, Liam asked, detecting a sexy raspiness in his now lower voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;At the moment, seventeen,&quot; Evelyn informed him, checking her computer screen. &quot;But you&#39;re in luck. Tomorrow is your birthday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool,&quot; said Liam, nodding to his reflection. But something didn&#39;t quite make sense to him. He spun around, vigorously scratching his head. &quot;But I thought you were gonna show me my future.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This could be your future, Liam,&quot; said Jeremy, strolling over. &quot;Or maybe I should call you Seamus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seamus?&quot; Liam&#39;s handsome face contorted into a cringe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Seamus O&#39;Neill. You&#39;re a senior in high school, and you&#39;re being recruited to attend NYU on an athletic scholarship next year. And I&#39;m here to show you around the campus. Doesn&#39;t that sound like fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuckin&#39; a,&quot; Liam replied boisterously, surprised to burst out with such foul language in front of grown-ups. But, shit, he was on a college campus now. Didn&#39;t everybody in college fuckin&#39; swear? It was kinda strange that Jeremy wanted to call him another name, but Liam was no stranger to role playing, having spent many long, lonely nights in high school lost in online fantasies while the other kids were out partyin&#39; and drinkin&#39; and smokin&#39; and fuckin&#39;. <br />
<br />
Confused, Seamus gave his head a quick vigorous shake. What was he thinkin&#39;? Why would he think he was such a loser? He was one of the most popular guys in school. Captain of the wrestling team and the swim team. Part of the homecoming court. High school had been great, but he was lookin&#39; forward to college. He&#39;d been terrified to let anybody know he was gay, but he hoped he could be much more open once he got among more open-minded college students. He&#39;d boned up the first moment he saw Jeremy, and was delighted to learn that this stud would be his escort for the weekend. He wondered if Jeremy was gay, but knew he was too scared to ask.<br />
<br />
Jeremy smiled brightly and said, &quot;What do you say we get you some clothes that fit, Seamus?&quot;<br />
<br />
Seamus nodded vigorously and said, &quot;Excellent!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy winked at Evelyn, who nodded back smugly as Jeremy led the fresh-faced high-school boy into the next room, which was lined along opposite walls with clothing racks.</p>
