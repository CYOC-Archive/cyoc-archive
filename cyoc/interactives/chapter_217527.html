<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ethan gulped, studying Charlene carefully. &quot;So, who should we test it on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How about ne,&quot; she smirked. Ethan&#39;s jaw dropped, he hadn&#39;t expected her to say that. &quot;You? Are you sure?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Something tells me you&#39;ve already had some experience useing that thing,&quot; she giggled. Ethan blushed, he really had an awful power face. &quot;Okay maybe,&quot; he replied sheepishly. &quot;But, let&#39;s just say I agree to this. What do you have in mind?&quot; Charlene rubbed her chin, an impish smirk crossing her face as she looked at Ethan. &quot;How about you take me all the way back to the beginning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait what!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dont look so shocked,&quot; she laughed. &quot;We need to test out the program. Neither one of us is very patient when it comes to this type of thing and since you&#39;ve had some experience with the program, you should be the one conducting the experiment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay I get that part,&quot; Ethan replied, still flummoxed by Charlene&#39;s idea. &quot;But you&#39;re talking about being reduced to infancy! Wouldn&#39;t it be safer to start slow? Alter your age by a few years. What happens if I can&#39;t change you back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you better make sure you raise me right Ethan,&quot; she grinned. &quot;But something tells me that you won&#39;t have a problem reversing this. Besides, it&#39;s more fun taking the experiment to its logical conclusion than wasting time on small scale experimentation.&quot; Ethan fidgeted in place, he was certain he could reverse Charlene&#39;s changes but, a nagging part of him worried that things could go wrong. &quot;Okay,&quot; he sighed. &quot;I&#39;ll do it but we have to be careful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlene squealed with excitement, planting a kiss on Ethans lips as she went to grab a chair. As Ethan now booted up the program, Charlene took a seat, gazing at Ethan in anticipation. &quot;Fire when ready Ethan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; he stated. &quot;I&#39;ve loaded your parameters Charlene. This will strictly be a physical regression only. This way your adult mind will be able to communicate everything that happens. Are you ready?&quot; Charlene nodded, the woman biting her lip in anticipation as Ethan activates the program.<br />
<br />
Charlene shivered, perhaps involuntarily, as her regression began. Gazing at the 35 year old woman, Ethan hadn&#39;t noticed any physical changes so far. &quot;How you feeling Charlene?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay I suppose,&quot; she said. &quot;Theres a very subtle tingling sensation. If I wasn&#39;t expecting any changes I probably wouldn&#39;t have noticed. How do I look so far?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan gazed at the woman, studying her carefully. It was hard to tell. Maybe her skin looked firmer, maybe her hair shone a bit brighter. Glancing at the computer her could see the timer tick backwards. &quot;Well according to this you just hit 29,&quot; he said. Charlene gave a mock cheer, giggling slightly as she examines her hands. &quot;Makes me younger than you now Ethan,&quot; she smiled. &quot;Any changes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan leaned close, his eyes growing wide as he gazed at the blonde beauty. Their was no denying it now, Charlene was younger. The small imperfections around her eyes and mouth had vanished leaving her face smooth. The womans hair looked healthier, her breasts seemed just a bit firmer. &quot;You&#39;re definitely younger!&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlene reached for a hand mirror, gasping at her youthful complexion. &quot;I..I look like I&#39;m 25 again!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually it&#39;s 26,&quot; Ethan stated. Charlene chuckled, marveling at the transformation as the counter continued to tick down. Ethan sat at rapt attention, watching as the formerly mature woman slipped slowly back into college. Charlene&#39;s face was losing maturity at this point, her jaw line rounding as crept further back in age. &quot;Happy 21st birthday Charlene.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Woohoo,&quot; she laughed. &quot;So Ethan you taking me out for my first drink?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe later,&quot; he chuckled. &quot;How are you feeling?&quot; Charlene examined herself, surprised at the looseness of her clothing. The coeds waist had slimmed, her breasts becoming incredibly firmer if not a bit less volumous. &quot;I didn&#39;t realize how skinny I was back then,&quot; she said softly. &quot;My stomach definitely feels flatter and I&#39;m pretty sure my hips and butt have lost some weight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you definitely look young,&quot; Ethan added. &quot;I&#39;d definitely card you if we went out drinking.&quot; Charlene crinkled her nose, Ethan finding her giddiness rather attractive. &quot;Yeah I always looked younger than I was,&quot; she grinned. &quot;Speaking if which, just how old am I right now?&quot; Ethan glanced at the program, shocked as the counter dipped down to 19. &quot;Congratulations you&#39;re a teenager.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Senior prom here I come,&quot; Charlene laughed. Ethan grinned gazing at the teenage beauty before him. Despite the loss of curve, Charlene was still amzingly attractive. While her face had lost moat if its maturity, she was still quite stunning. Charlene&#39;s body was fit, her breasts quite large of a teenager as they sat firmly in C cup territory. &quot;So Charlene were you Prom Queen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very astute observation Mr. Corcoran,&quot; Charlene said, Ethan surprised as her voice became lighter. &quot;So how do you feel Charlene,&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Energetic,&quot; she said. &quot;Also I feel like I borrowed my mother&#39;s clothes. The robe and the nightie are really beginning to become quite baggy. But, at least my slippers still fit.&quot; Ethan glanced at the teens legs, noting that they were skinnier than when she was an adult but appeared firmer. Charlene was definitely more energetic as she crossed her legs, her foot bouncing as she sat there. Glancing at the computer, Ethan watched as the timer ticked backwards from 18 to 17. &quot;So Ethan am I still old enough for prom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe Junior prom,&quot; Ethan replied. &quot;You just hit 17 and are racing for sweet 16.&quot; Charlene harumphed playfully, folding her arms across her chest as she gazed at Ethan. &quot;I&#39;ll have you know Mr. Corcoran I was someone&#39;s prom dat my Junior year,&quot; she grinned. Ethan laughed, watching the teenage girl as she crept backwards through high school. Charlene&#39;s face was rounding, her curves eroding as she grew younger. The girl would obviously be considered one of the prettiest girls in any high school, yet her regression had knocked her into more of a cute category than a sexy one. &quot;So Ethan mind if I drive your car while I still can?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like a bad idea Charlene,&quot; Ethan laughed. &quot;You just hit 16. Pretty sure you won&#39;t be ill enough to drive in another minute.&quot; Charlene whined playfully, fully embracing her teenage appearance. Although she still possessed her adult mentality and maturity, she rather enjoyed playing the part of teenager.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH that is so not fair Ethan,&quot; Charlene whined in typical teenage fashion. Ethan stifled a laugh, the girl pretending to throw a hissed fit as her slipper flew off her foot. Ethan laughed, gazing at the teenage girls smaller foot. It was smaller and smoother than when she was an adult. Ethan finding the French tip to oddly compliment her teenage form. &quot;Like I was a really good driver,&quot; Charlene stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure you were,&quot; Ethan grinned. &quot;By the way how are you feeling?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still me,&quot; Charlene smiled. &quot;Just more energetic. This is truely amazing Ethan. I mean look at me! I&#39;m 16 years old again, it feels incredible. I just didnt realize how loose my clothing would be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just wait til you start reliving growth spurts in reverse,&quot; Ethan stated. Charlene nodded, glancing over teenage form as Etajn gazed at the counter. Patt of him wanted to let the process run its course but, another part of him wanted to stop here. A teenage Charlene could be alot if fun, especially if he were to run the Chronovac on himself. Ethan now rubbed his chin thoughtfully, he would need to make a decision now.</p>
