<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zeke typed in bodybuilder into the screen. He was surprised that the other stats changed automatically. His dad was still 5&#39;11&quot; but more went from 175 pounds up to 185. Then his body fat had dropped down to 11% showing off the toned abs a bit more. The 3D model still looked like his dad, but it wasn&#39;t nearly as impressive as the famous guys. If he was actually going to win a competition he&#39;d have to be a lot bigger. <br />
<br />
The fist to change was the height. 5&#39;11&quot; wasn&#39;t short, but it also didn&#39;t turn many heads. Zeke bumped that up to 6&#39;5&quot;. Next was the weight. 185 on someone who was 6&#39;5&quot; was almost nothing. His dad looked almost like a twig. So that 1 quickly turned into a 2, making him 285 pounds. The hundred pounds of muscle instantly added to model giving him an actual bodybuilder look. Thick pecs, wide shoulders, thin waist with thick abs running down it, powerful quads and a tight firm butt. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s more like it,&quot; Zeke said. But before he clicked confirm, there was one more thing he had to change. Looking at the nude model, he couldn&#39;t stand the idea of how small his dad&#39;s junk looked. People had always mad fun of bodybuilders for having such small junk but he didn&#39;t want his dad to be one who would be made fun of. Even if five and a half inches hard was average, it looked positively tiny compared to the girth of his legs. <br />
<br />
Zeke quickly changed the soft to be 5 inches and hard to be 10. It would snake down his leg and impress anyone who saw it. Zeke then scrolled through to make sure those were the changes that he wanted to make and then clicked confirm. &quot;Woah,&quot; Zeke grunted as the world shifted around him. Suddenly two sets of memories were colliding with each other and it was hard to focus on just one. His body fell forward onto the bed.<br />
<br />
But something seemed off. It was like his body was changing. His arms and legs were stretching longer. His muscles growing. &quot;The hell?&quot; he muttered as he looked in the bedroom mirror. The athletic body he&#39;d been honing for the last few years was somehow swelling up. Muscles that he&#39;d been working on suddenly gaining a significant amount of size and definition. He could see the power in his biceps and the horseshoe shape in his triceps. His shoulders widened, filling any door that he might pass through.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fucking huge...&quot; Zeke had to take a step back to fully see his body. &quot;I&#39;m fucking huge!&quot; he flexed his arms watching them bulge with power. A thick vein ran through his bicep pumping blood to the muscle. He padded around feeling different parts of his body wondering just how much had changed could see.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
Jake was in the shower. He started thinking about the gym again. It felt so good to be in there. And even better while everyone was looking at him and Zeke. Though it made sense. Being a big ass bodybuilder was hard not to look at. Then with the gym losing the AC people couldn&#39;t help but stare as his shirt clung to every bit of his body. It was practically a dream, work out to make money.<br />
<br />
Reality was shifting to make it more real. Jake&#39;s shoulders were starting to widen in the shower. What little room he had was completely gone as his shoulder bumped up against the ceramic walls. He had to lean forward a bit to actually get his head wet. As his legs and torso lengthened to their 6&#39;5&quot; status, there was no way he would properly fit underneath the shower. He was past eye level with the thing. <br />
<br />
Jake grumbled a bit and stretched towards the ceiling. His hands easily planted against them, yet something changed. It was almost like he was pushing the ceiling up. The walls of the shower changed around him as well, opening up more to allow his big body plenty of space to move around in. &quot;That&#39;s better,&quot; he muttered as he stretched his entire back. A relief ran through his back as he was able to stretch it out completely. &quot;Much better.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Best choice of my life,&quot; he bragged to himself remembering that he&#39;d taken some of the money in his last competition to improve his shower. There were plenty of other life improvements he&#39;d made around the house to fit both him and Zeke a bit better. But that didn&#39;t mean that his size couldn&#39;t still cause issues. It was near impossible for him to reach his back to properly soap it up. Luckily there were people for that. He could just call one up and have them come over.<br />
<br />
Didn&#39;t matter if they sent a guy or girl, Jake wasn&#39;t really picky. Either way they&#39;d be smaller than him. He could do just about whatever they wanted and still feel good about it. Just thinking about running his massive hands down their smaller bodies was enough to get him started. One of his hands drifted down to his cock giving the beast a tug. It instantly awoke. Moving from what normal guys would think of as average to an absolute monster so many of them wished they had. Even with his massive hands it could be hard for Jake to properly tame the beast.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d sometimes need both to fulfill the full experience. With each tug he grew a little harder. Came a little closer. Deep hearty grunts like the ones he&#39;d had in the gym echoed off the shower walls. He continued, feeling the sweat start dripping out of him again. But it felt good. He was a fucking a man! <br />
<br />
The thought filled his mind. His body reacted and unloaded against the wall in front of him. &quot;Shit,&quot; he smirked at the mess he&#39;d made. Big and messy. The shower head was detachable for this exact reason. Very easy clean up. <br />
<br />
Jake stepped out of the shower and then wrapped a towel around his waist. It just barely fit him. He couldn&#39;t help but give himself a flex. Those massive muscles were unbelievable and needed to be shown off. But where was his phone? Jake stepped out of the bathroom. Zeke was standing there. Flexing. &quot;Like father, like son?&quot; Jake quipped.<br />
<br />
Zeke jumped. &quot;Hey there dad!&quot; he squeaked. Despite his massive body he still seemed to get a bit jumpy around his old man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there buddy, you know where my phone is?&quot;</p>
