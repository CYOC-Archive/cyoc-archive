<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Maelewano was set up in a fairly open area in Kenya as a means to provide for a means of escape for refugees and to give Horizon some means of access to provide medicine and other related treatments into the continent of Africa. Many companies and rich individuals had tried things like this before, but they often set up small bases in existing cities and often at the mercy of either local governments, warlords, or simply the infrastructure of the region. If the place didn&#39;t have the facilities or money to support such investments, what was there was often too small truly have a positive effect. Animalia and Horizon provided a new option for this, as it would also be aided by the fact that many Animalians would have interest in settling and helping the project work... many were often uplifted animals from the Lyre Zoo that were based on African animals at first, but as Maelewano got started, it also included some members of local wildlife that were of species not under threat of extinction.<br />
<br />
That set up a fairly secure colony that then brought in refugees from many of the hot spots in Africa and around the world. Most of Maelewano&#39;s residents were actually Humans, and only a few of them converted to become Animalians. But the Animalian presence was still fairly big, and they provided a lot of the security from both potential criminals and from local wildlife, which often did move between the various &quot;villages&quot; that made up the component settlements of Maelewano. This kept any lions or hyenas from messing with livestock or elephants and rhinos from doing damage to the structures themselves. It also allowed for training programs where some of the Animalians were learning various engineering skills that would enable them to work with various UN missions to disarm landmines and other assorted weapons that were often left behind by these various war zones and areas of chaos that often drew people to flee to Maelewano, and backed by Horizon&#39;s money, they were able to afford medicines that would help both the local people and wildlife. That soon brought some attention to things as other events happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, these guys were all from zoos?&quot; one man asked. His dark lips were pulled into a deep frown. He&#39;d lived in Kenya all his life and was fairly well aware of many of the problems the various countries in Africa had, much of which could be traced to European colonialism, but he&#39;d had the fortune to study abroad and learn a lot, mostly in the sciences, and which brought him to work for Horizon as Maelewano was set up, but it also gave him some awareness that the past couldn&#39;t be changed and peace and prosperity was never going to come so long as people ranted or did things that excused present crimes on past transgressions, and the figures on the other side of the window were proof of that. The present case looked like it might have some of those connections.<br />
<br />
For the animals brought in largely looked like Grey Wolves, which were native to Europe, Asia, and North America, but were not found in Africa. Africa&#39;s wild Canids were all different, and given the large hyena and lion populations, the wild dogs on the continent played a secondary role. Yet, some people still had interest in these non-native predators for other reasons. The scientist observed their movements and noted various behaviors that would be typical more of domestic dogs than wild wolves and some that resembled the behaviors of wild wolves but without the fear of man. It was something that to him was more a crime against nature than politics, and that is what concerned him when the man, who wore a game warden uniform from South Africa, brought them in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zoos and shelters immediately,&quot; the South African warden spoke, &quot;though, that wasn&#39;t what brought them to Africa in the first place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t mean...&quot; the scientist asked, fearful that someone had gone beyond poaching African wildlife to bringing in non-African animals to abuse.<br />
<br />
&quot;The records indicate that they were originally brought in in the 1970s... before many of the treaties on international animal trade went into effect in South Africa... and because the Grey Wolf isn&#39;t under threat of extinction, there was no concern,&quot; the warden spoke, &quot;though the plan was more breed them with German Shepards to create a stronger crowd control dog...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wolfdogs could certainly do that,&quot; the scientist sighed, &quot;but they&#39;d also potentially pose a threat to the trainers as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And ultimately that is what they found out,&quot; the warden answered, &quot;it wasn&#39;t like they were untrainable, but the time and effort was much harder and never produced the effects given. So, when the project failed, they went into private hands and zoos. Most of these guys now are getting rather old... and there was some talk on taking them back to Canada for &quot;rewilding&quot; projects but given their age... that might not work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With their association with people... even at a younger age, they&#39;d be dangerous,&quot; the scientist spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;And thus the idea to uplift them,&quot; the warden spoke, &quot;they could help us in South Africa or help the colony here at Maelewano. I mean... you guys have access to all sorts of vaccines, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; the scientist nodded, &quot;much of which for the Animalia Virus... but for various other human diseases as well as for various animal diseases. Including darts carrying the vaccines for Rabies and Distemper.&quot;<br />
<br />
The warden nodded but blinked as the scientist continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though I would question on the how and whys people would do these things with animals,&quot; the scientist said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It started in different times,&quot; the warden answered, &quot;that&#39;s all I can say... what will you have me do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We want to set the divider down the middle and have all of them on one side,&quot; the scientist instructed, &quot;then you can open the door and take in the water dishes, which all have the Animalia Virus in the water. With all this heat... they&#39;re bound to be thirsty, even if they&#39;ve had water. From there, you&#39;d then come out. We&#39;d shut and lock the door and then remove the divider. From there, all we can do is give them privacy and move to one of the &quot;observation&quot; lounges.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d watch them change?&quot; the warden wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; the scientist answered, &quot;we try to retain some measure of privacy, be it with uplifting animals, as would be the case here... or when people come into convert. Either to establish full residences in Maelewano or converting before returning to their country of origin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do many actually leave?&quot; the warden wondered as he looked over to a large piece of plywood that fit between a gap in the bars.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those that actually become Animalians?&quot; the scientist answered, &quot;no, actually. Horizon has done a lot of work to supply Maelewano and has fostered enough economic growth in the area that many of those that come here as refugees but become Animalians stay because they think they can do well here... and often because they feel they would be accepted among Animalians. Those that don&#39;t convert leave when they feel it is safe to do so... but those groups are Human.&quot;<br />
<br />
The warden nodded and they set about the work. Fitting the plywood wall through wasn&#39;t too hard. The main issue was more making sure that the wolfdogs stayed on one side of it. Though, the scientist did toss some bits of hamburger meat onto the floor, which did keep them occupied and allowed the warden to slide the plywood wall in. It eventually clicked into place in a sort of metal clamp that looked like it was set there for this sort of procedure. The Horizon staff then opened the door and the warden assisted them in taking the water bowls in. As the last bowl was taken in, the other staff members left the area and the warden was again left with the main scientist. The warden actually felt glad for this, as the scientist had explained a lot on what Horizon did with the colony city at Maelewano and that tourism and safari events to see native African wildlife, which did roam over much of the areas around the colony, but to provide safety for people and medical help for those that needed it. The vaccinating of animals was also big... as his unit of game wardens in South Africa had also come across a pride of lions... dead, and from Canine Distemper in one of the more remote parts of the country. It was something that the warden felt might help save a lot of Africa&#39;s wild animals that were facing extinction. That was a big thing for him... and went beyond just rescuing these wolfdogs for uplifting.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what will happen with them?&quot; the warden asked as they got the plywood wall pulled out to let the wolves go get a drink as while the two men when out of the room and into what was described as an &quot;observation room.&quot; The room was relatively small, but the warden noted there was some audio coming into the room, which could mean that they could hear the transformation go through.<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of that will depend on what they are interested in once they&#39;re uplifted,&quot; the scientist answered, &quot;they could become wardens... like you... and thus would join those doing a lot of the veterinary work with livestock here or with the wild animals that live outside of the immediate area. But they could get into commerce or something else... Shoot, as Animalians, they should be legally free to visit or immigrate to other countries or Animalian colonies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you know which?&quot; the warden wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s more up to them... and we&#39;ll have to wait until after they&#39;ve been uplifted for that,&quot; the scientist answered.</p>
