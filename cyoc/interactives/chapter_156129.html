<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mere seconds after the nanomachines had successfully covered your entire body, it began to contract as the nanomachines densed up against your body, essentially crushing you as from the outside the mass had begun to shrink. Your attempts at squirming out of the Nanomachines grasp were met with futility as the nanomachines reach out with a long nanomachine tentacle to where you had found the pod. Up there, having hid themselves from your view were two small tubes containing a green liquid, There were also two empty injection syringes. The nanomachine tentacle took the tubes and attached them to the injection syringes, bringing them down to the densening mass of nanomachines, then brought them into the mass, heading for your boobs. <br />
<br />
Then the nanomachines jammed the syringes into your nipples, Then injected the fluid before yanking them accurately out and dissolving the syringes and now empty tubes. Your boobs throbbed much like how a penis would, but not in erection or pleasure but in convulsion and strainage as the fluid from the syringes took hold and then expanded them. Enlargening them past D-cup and up to a O-cup amazingly and embarrassingly enough.<br />
<br />
Then the nanomachines went to work. Densening into a full body suit that didn&#39;t cover the head, well, it covered your head but only under your chin. Then the nanomachine mass violently compressed, your body ached in pain under the pressure, but quickly you feel the nanomachines removing themselves from your innards. You felt minorly relieved but still in pain and fear of what the nanomachines might be doing with your body.<br />
<br />
Then your face was uncovered and the nanomachines finished retracting into your new suit as you gasped for air, coughing violently from the suffocating experience. Weakly you raise yourself, looking in shock at your new suit that had been forced upon you. You also notice your O-cup breasts rather embarrasingly. Shaking your head you remember the wardrobe having a mirror, rather awkwardly but nimbly you stand up and walk over to the mirror and look at yourself. Your entire body up to your chin was clad in a skintight black, grey and neon green coloured suit that looked irremovable. <br />
<br />
Your feet were covered in small futuristic boots with a rather solid and rigid look, the soles being thick and with a multitude of electromagnetic clamps lining it&#39;s outside. The rest of your legs were covered in the black hexagonal surface of the nanomachines, a neon green expanding from between your legs up to your belly and crotch, black and grey plating protected your legs sides, hips and kneecaps. Your crotch was covered in the neon green on it&#39;s front and your private area where you also noticed that your vagina and anus were essentially exposed there, your vaginal lips being a black and your anus being marked with a black circle, it was obvious to note that the suit didn&#39;t so much as cover them, well they were essentially covered but if someone were to put their cock up your ass there wouldn&#39;t be anything to hide them.<br />
<br />
As you went on and stared at your private area, you noticed that your vagina and anus no longer was marked and the suit closed up, you suspected that taking this suit off would maybe be impossible to do without some major help, and the suit wanted you to know that if you ever were to want sex, you didn&#39;t have to take off the suit, just stick the penis up your ass...<br />
<br />
You then looked at your arms, they were much like your legs but obviously different, your arms didn&#39;t have any large patch of neon green but rather a couple neon green patterns or lines integrated with the more rigid and apparent supposed armouring of them where the black and grey made your arms look very futuristic. Your shoulders were essentially armoured even more along with your elbow.<br />
Moving on, your torso was largely neon green, Your belly and chest was covered in it, Essentially reminiscent of latex but different, it was smooth and glistening. <br />
<br />
Your breasts stood out, making your perky oblong breasts even more obvious and apparent, not even hiding your stiff nipples. Your back was black with a rigid grey armoured trail covering your spine, Your plump butt stood out, mainly covered in grey. Above your breasts, there was a black spot intertwined in neon green creating a sort of winged pattern but in a sort of x shape. Your neck was covered in the black latex like surface, neon green stripes of light creating bits of patterns or just illumination among small grey plating mixed with black wires. The surface extended to under your chin, everything below that being covered by the suit.<br />
<br />
Your face had certainly been slightly changed. There were a total of 7 streaks of black engraved in your skin, all encroached from around the face, with equal distance between eachother but one spot where there should have been a streak, namely from your chin. Three of the streaks were present on either side, with the seventh being above looking down from your hairline, same as with the other streaks of black. Speaking of Hair. Your hair was completley black and ridiculously long, almost reaching the floor in a very thick black braid. <br />
<br />
You looked over yourself. You had to say, you looked quite attractive, even if you were looking at yourself, you would have genuinely tried to date this woman in the mirror, but you were that woman... Talk about wierd and arousing...<br />
<br />
You decide you should let the lizard know about your new suit now. Taking a quick look back at the mirror you see that your vagina and anus were hidden, your nipples didn&#39;t show trough the neon green surface but the very way the suit covered them make it kind of obvious that your nipples were stiff. You let out a short, embarrased and relieved sigh as you walk out the wardrobe and walk back the way you came from. You get a bit lost but find your way back to the teleporter that made you female...<br />
<br />
You looked around then just took a guess and walked down the way. The grey corridors having no identifyable way that pointed to the Lizard, you guessed she could be in the ships cockpit but yet again, no clear indication were obvious to where the ships cockpit was.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
You Wandered around, in the general area of the teleporter, guessing the the lizard wasn&#39;t far away from there. Then through some luck or holy intervention you manage to find the lizard in the cockpit fiddling with the controls. You clear your throat with a light cough, catching her attention as she flinches, then looks back and looks at you, then she turns her chair and looks at you. <br />
<br />
She stares at you for some time, musing at your body, musing out the details. &#39;&#39;I... Don&#39;t remember having a black suit... And i definitively didn&#39;t have one like that. Also why has your boobs suddenly gotten so big?&#39;&#39; She questions. You look over yourself and blush as you nod. &#39;&#39;I uh... Found it in one of the closets... And Uuuh...&#39;&#39; You nervously say, awkwardly smiling. The lizard lady looks oddly at you with suspicion, then going wide eyed in realization. She quickly stands up and walks over to you. Going over your suited body rapidly, eyeing your back and ridiculously long hair along with your face, suit and breasts before just standing in front of you.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;Did you stumble across a pod by chance in that closet?&#39;&#39; She sternly said with a serious look. You gulp, blushing. &#39;&#39;Uh, I... Y-yes...&#39;&#39; You admit to which the lizard releases a dissapointed sigh. &#39;&#39;Now i need to get back and get some other human...&#39;&#39; She mumbled. &#39;&#39;Did the contents of said pod cover you, then merge with your body, improving it and becoming your suit?&#39;&#39; She asked again. You look down embarrassed, blushing madly. The already towering lizard looking down at you with an inquisitorial look. &#39;&#39;... Yes...&#39;&#39; You admit, to which the lizard mutters. &#39;&#39;oh damn it.&#39;&#39; Then she sighed again.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;That pod contained enough nanomachines to reconstruct this entire ship. And with how oddly they think, they choose to do stuff at random. Atleast you weren&#39;t slaved or mind-linked...&#39;&#39; She says looking sternly at you. &#39;&#39;Those streaks on your face signify how greatly integrated the nanomachines are in your body. Those seven streaks mean you&#39;re basically in a symbiotic relationship. And your DNA is now locked tightly behind metaphorical bars, due to the nature of nanomachines, teleporters won&#39;t be able to lock on or even transport you,  bioengineering won&#39;t work because your DNA is unavailable... Short said you are now stuck as a female... Nevertheless covered in nanomachines and with nanomachines in your very blood itself capable of significantly increasing your life expectancy to above 10&#39;000 galactic years. Each of which is like... 100 earth years... I think? Essentailly meaning you&#39;ll live over 1 million earth years... Oh and killing you is going to be a nightmare for everyone who wish to do so too, so ret assured, even if you&#39;re wanted dead, bounty hunters are gonna seriously reconsider...&#39;&#39; She explained, You looked at her in shock at the &#39;no return&#39; of her explanation. You looked in despair at the lizard lady, as if pleading for a possible way to reverse the effects or become male again.<br />
<br />
She sighes again. &#39;&#39;Look. It&#39;s possible to remove the nanomachines from your body, but...&#39;&#39; She hesitated. Looking at you and your pleading eyes. She sighes once more. &#39;&#39;But... the surgery, has a chance to... Kill you, depending on how majorly the nanomachines are apart of your body. You are near complete irreversability so you have a ridiculously high chance of dying from the surgery. And even if you&#39;re successful, the surgery would make you experience enough pain for your brain to be permanently scarred.&#39;&#39; She explains. This is abit shocking to you as you look at the lizard lady, no longer blushing but yoru mind racing over the information, despairing at the thought of being compeltley stuck liek this for the rest of your life... Which was multiplied well over a thousand gosh darned times...<br />
<br />
She huffed. &#39;&#39;Why did i have to forget about it there...&#39;&#39; She mumbled. You shifted nervously. &#39;&#39;... Come sit.&#39;&#39; She offered, leading you to the co-pilots chair while she sat down in the pilot&#39;s chair. &#39;&#39;Not to mention, due to nanomachines being quite wonky at times, you have to register yourself as a nanomachine infused biological lifeform to the intergalactic community, and you can&#39;t go on the surface of planets with intelligent lifeforms because again. Nanomachines and them being wonky. So they might suddenly decide to go eat the planet or whatnot it deems fit and then posibly puppet, enslave or &#39;improve&#39; All life on said planet. And so to avoid that, if i&#39;m going into a planets atmosphere, you need to have your own isolation chamber made out of material which nanomachines don&#39;t usually try to dissolve or absorb due to said material being harmful to them, but a mass of nanomachines of sufficiant level and consentration would be capable of ignoring the materials anti-nanomachine factors.&#39;&#39; She explained, making you see that you were essentially a puppet now under heavy watch because of the risks these nanomachines have, all because of your damned curiosity you found yourself in this despaired situation...<br />
<br />
Curiosity did indeed kill the cat... And you were the cat in this story. But instead of being killed, you were changed. Locked behind bars nigh impossible to pass without a major possibbility of dying or guaranteed enough pain that you would be irreversably... Messed up. <br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t like the feeling. It was both scary and incredibly painful to wonder about...<br />
<br />
You looked down. Undeniably slightly depressed about the complicated matter of the circumstance you find yourself in. You look out the windows of the cockpit and out at the bountiful stars. It was all beautiful...</p>
