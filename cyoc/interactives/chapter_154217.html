<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gary brought his arm up and flexed a bicep, a cocky smirk on his face as he appreciated his own well-developed musculature. He gave the round softball sized bicep a kiss before lowering his arm and returning to his computer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder if this Chronivac thing could show me what I would look like if I packed on even more mass&quot; he mused, as he scrolled the mouse over to the muscle setting.  He set the Chronivac to add 5 lbs a day for 2 weeks, figuring he&#39;d be able to watch the 3D simulation grow each day, like a virtual pet. He birefly considered if 5 lbs a day was too much, but quickly brushed it off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its just a fancy photo editor anyways&quot; he thought to himself dismissively.<br />
<br />
And with that he confirmed his settings and went to sleep for the night.<br />
<br />
Gary slowly awoke the next morning, feeling unusually well rested. As he sat up in his bed, he was suddenly struck with panic as he realized he didn&#39;t wake up to his alarm. He rushed to check his phone for the time and realized he&#39;d overslept, but could still make it to school in time. And so Gary threw on some clothes and rushed out the door to school.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, he arrived just as the bell was ringing. His classes went off mostly without a hitch. Gary generally slipped by in his classes while putting in the least effort necessary, preferring to focus on his athletics over academics. As soon as the final bell rang, Gary made a beeline to the school gym, as was his usual routine. <br />
<br />
The huge linebacker was surprised to find that all of his weights were up, adding at least 5-10 lbs to every lift. At the end of his workout, Gary flexed in the mirror and admired the huge pump he was feeling. In fact, he looked more pumped than he usually did. His stomach was still round and a little flabby, but his arms and legs looked especially big and pumped. A few new veins that Gary hadn&#39;t noticed before were even running down his forearms and calves. Gary was so engrossed in his body he didn&#39;t even consider the fact that he didn&#39;t even work legs today so his legs had no reason to be as pumped as they were.<br />
<br />
Psyched about his progress in the gym, Gary drove home, making sure to stop and flex for himself at every stop light until he got home. He had completely forgotten about the Chronivac and went about the rest of his night as usual before going to bed<br />
<br />
Gary woke up the next morning, with his alarm this time, and groggily went through his morning routine. He was feeling slightly stiff this particular morning, but he simply chalked it up to his extra intense workout from the day before. As he pulled on his clothes, the sleeves of his t-shirt seemed to  cling a little tighter than usual to his upper arms and his chest. His jeans were a little less comfortable to sit in as the seemed to squeeze his thighs and butt more than usual too. But Gary didn&#39;t have much time to consider the fit of his clothes as he realized he was about to be late (again).<br />
<br />
Throughout the day he found himself absentmindedly tugging at the front of his shirt. He became more acutely aware of his biceps when he bent his arms as he could feel the sleeves exert more pressure on his upper arm than he was used to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, mom must&#39;ve shrunk my shirt in the laundry&quot; Gary thought.<br />
<br />
After his classes was football practice. Just like all his lifts were up in the gym yesterday, so too was the linebacker&#39;s performance improved at football practice. So much so that he was getting compliments from his fellow teammates and the coach. A few even asked him if he&#39;d been working out more, which Gary just responded by flexing a huge bicep and giving his usual cocky smile.<br />
<br />
At the end of practice, Gary decided to weigh himself to make sure he was maintaining his 260 lbs of bulk, but his mouth dropped when he saw the scale hit 270 lbs instead. He was incredibly excited, and more than a little aroused, at the thought of weighing in at 270 lbs, but somewhere in the back of his head he knew that it wasn&#39;t normal to gain so much weight in such a short amount of time. And that&#39;s when he remembered the Chronivac program on his computer and the settings he&#39;d left it with 2 days prior. He&#39;d set his virtual image to gain 5 lbs of muscle a day 2 days ago, and he&#39;d gained 10 lbs in the same amount of time. He knew it had to be related.<br />
<br />
Gary rushed home and started up his computer and loaded up the Chronivac and surely enough, the virtual model of himself read 270 lbs. Realizing that this wasn&#39;t just a photo editing program, Gary immediately thought about trying to stop it, but then thought about it more. He loved being big, and would love being bigger even more. He decided to wait it out and see where it went. He figured he could always undo it afterwards if he didn&#39;t like it.<br />
<br />
And so his days progressed, each day he felt his clothes grow a little tighter and each day he was setting new personal bests in the gym. After day 5 he was up to 285 lbs and his friends and teammates really began to notice. It didn&#39;t help that it was around this time when he realized he outgrew all his clothes. That morning he tried to get dressed, but realized any movement or even a deep breath would rip his shirts right down the middle from the sheer size of his chest. It was a Saturday that day, and Gary ended up spending the better part of the first half of the day just ripping all of his t shirts as he jacked off his sizable 8 inch cock. <br />
<br />
On day 8 Gary passed the 300 lbs mark. He was big before but now he was approaching massive. Waking down the street, people began giving him a wider berth due to his sheer size. He was starting to have trouble keeping his arms at his sides as his triceps and lats fought for space. His performance on the football field was better than ever, his added muscle only making him a more formidable force. Surprisingly he hadn&#39;t even really slowed down with the extra mass. If anything he got faster as his legs grew into pistons that could power his body forward with unbelievable force. His performance and growth was so remarkable in fact, that the school administration demanded he take a drug test as they could think of no other explanation for his rapid growth, but Gary knew it would come up clean.<br />
<br />
At the end of his 2 weeks of growth, a 330 lb Gary lumbered down the hallway, students and teachers alike making way for him as he made his way through the school. His shoulders were just about as wide as the doorways in the school, and from them hung arms the size of hams. Huge and meaty, The monstrous linebacker&#39;s arms swung at his sides at a 45 degree angle, pushed up by the mass of his broad back. His XXXl T-shirt was pulled taut against his pecs, showing a pair of nipples that were forced to the underside of his pecs by their mass. Those globular pecs also rested above a bear-like gut that looked even larger than before his growth, not because he gained fat but because even underneath it, his abs bowed out with mass, pushing his stomach round against the fabric of his shirt. His thighs rolled around each other as he swaggered down the hall, barely contained by his basketball shorts. Below the hem of his shorts protruded two melon-sized calves that pulsed with power with each step he took.<br />
<br />
Gary had his trademark cocky smile plastered on his face as he watched the stares of awe, jealousy, and lust around him. He was undeniably the BMOC. But he thought about everything else he could do with the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
After he got home, he pulled up the Chronivac and considered his options.</p>
