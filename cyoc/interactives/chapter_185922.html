<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke sat back, his jaw and ass both a little sore from the spit roasting he got from the two Lyles. That was something he wasn&#39;t expecting when his older brother burst into the room but oddly he felt pleased with the whole encounter. At the moment he just watched as the two Lyles went at it, one bent over and taking from the other eagerly. He had lost track of which was Lyle and which was David, but he was only a little weirded out by being turned on with the whole situation.<br />
<br />
Top Lyle grunted as he thrust one last time into bottom Lyle, no doubt cumming inside him from the way he bit his lip. Both Lyle&#39;s faces were mirror images of pleasure as bottom Lyle came as well. Top Lyle pulled free and slapped his bottom self on the ass. &quot;I knew I was good, but hot fuck.&quot; Well, that answered Luke&#39;s question. Top was the original.<br />
<br />
&quot;How long have you had a crush on my brother?&quot; Luke asked the sprawled out David with a small laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up.&quot; David picked himself up and sat on the edge of the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, this amulet lets you turn into anyone as long as you have a piece of their clothing?&quot; Lyle asked as he stood up, not caring that he was walking around naked in front of his younger brother and his best friend.<br />
<br />
David got up and pushed the hat covering the amulet aside. He picked it up to show Lyle and put it on. Looking about the room, he quickly picked up a hat he was sure was Luke&#39;s and pulled it on his head. David began to shrink, losing a little bit of height and quite a bit of muscle mass, going from Lyle&#39;s bulky muscular frame to Luke&#39;s lean one. The dusting of hair on his chest vanished as his blond hair shortened into a neater cut instead of Lyle&#39;s shaggy style. There was only a bit of change in the features as David went from being one brother to another and soon Luke was having the surreal experience of seeing his own naked body from the outside.<br />
<br />
He had a nice ass. Luke rested his head in his hand. Checking out his own body.. what was wrong with him. Though David was acting a little oddly in Luke&#39;s body, now seemingly bothered by being in a room with a bunch of naked men. Maybe Luke&#39;s straightness was coming through.<br />
<br />
Lyle was grinning though. &quot;Perfect. You two are going to help me get a little payback.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How so?&quot; David sat back down on the bed, surreptitiously pulling a sheet over his lap. Like Luke had never seen his own dick before.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s a couple of homophobic pricks on the hockey team. They found out about me and are blackmailing me.&quot; Lyle leaned up against the dresser, watching the two younger men. &quot;I need something on them to get them off my back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come out.&quot; Luke said with a shrug. &quot;Not like most people will care.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lyle shook his head. &quot;Coach is worse. He won&#39;t kick me off the team if he finds out, but.. He found out about one guy last year and just made his life miserable until he quit. Maybe we&#39;ll get a piece of the coach, too. But first, I need those two fuckers handled.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave and Luke looked at each other and both shrugged. Dave spoke up, taking the lead like usual. &quot;Fine. We&#39;ll help. What&#39;s the plan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get dressed. We&#39;re going on a field trip.&quot; Lyle bent over to grab his clothes and strode out of the room.<br />
<br />
Twenty minutes later they were pulling into a parking space in Lyle&#39;s college. Luke in Dave&#39;s body and clothes and Dave in Luke&#39;s. They thought of switching back before coming, but thought it might be interesting to stay this way for a while. The amulet sat tucked away in a ziplock bag in Luke&#39;s pocket.<br />
<br />
&quot;So it&#39;s simple.&quot; Lyle shared on the drive. &quot;We get some of their clothes. You two turn into them. I snap a few compromising photos and bam, instant blackmail material.&quot;  Hoping out of the car, Lyle headed right for one of the buildings. Luke recognized it as the school&#39;s indoor ice rink having been here to watch some of Lyle&#39;s games. He lead the pair through a few hallways until they came into the locker room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, here&#39;s hoping they left some stuff behind.&quot; Lyle strode right over to one of the lockers and opened it up. There was some equipment inside but he started rummaging.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if we get caught?&quot; Luke asked, glancing around.<br />
<br />
&quot;No game today, no practice today, and there&#39;s a big party going down on the other side of campus. We won&#39;t see anyone.&quot; Lyle pulled his head out of the locker room, holding up a grimy looking jock strap. &quot;Who&#39;s first?&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke started stripping right in the middle of the locker room. Dave had done the last two changes, so it only seemed fair he was next up. With his clothes set aside, he pulled out the medallion and placed it over his head. Wrinkling his nose he took the jock from Lyle. It smelled a bit musty even from a few feet away. &quot;If I get crabs or something from this thing, I&#39;m going to come after you.&quot; He said, trying to be threatening to his older brother but Lyle just smiled.<br />
<br />
Luke pulled it on. It was a bit loose, but the changes began almost immediately. He began to fill out, only gaining a couple of inches on Dave&#39;s height but not quite to his old, maybe an inch or so shorter, but his shoulders and chest were practically barreling outwards. Whoever he was turning into had a super stocky build. His skin lost the dusky Asian complexion of Dave&#39;s body, turning pale and freckled. Soon his arms were as thick as his legs had been and his chest was sticking proudly out, two rounded slabs of muscle. His gut stuck out a little, too. Hard and frim but not the cut six pack he had been hoping he might get to experience. He had to shift his stance as his thighs thickened with more muscle, spreading his feet apart. Curly red hair grew in a thick patch between his pecs and in a fuzzy stripe down his stomach, more curling over the top of the jock strap he wore. He knew the black hair he had a moment ago was no doubt turning red, but when he reached up his hand was met with a buzz cut. <br />
<br />
The jock strap was pushing forward as well, it had a very large pouch, and it was obvious why, because soon Luke was filling it. He tugged it out and goggled. Seeing the thickest, longest cock he had ever seen. Who ever he was, dude was hung like the proverbial horse. He caught Lyle staring at him with a smug smile and let the pouch snap back over his huge manhood. He also felt.. good being stared at.<br />
<br />
He looked around until he found a mirror and headed over to it. His steps felt heavy and solid. Dude must have been the team goalie or something. Green eyes widened a little in the mirror. The guy&#39;s features matched his stocky build, hard and square, with a heavy jaw dusted with red stubble and thick heavy brows. He was good looking if not classically handsome. He flexed a few times in the mirror, amazed at how thick his arms bulged when he did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn. Spitting image of Casey.&quot; Lyle said, sounding satisfied. &quot;Now, for his best bud Derek.&quot; Lyle started digging though another locker. <br />
<br />
Luke turned to look at Dave, arms spread wide. &quot;How do I look?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave laughed. &quot;If I was in my old body, I&#39;d be fighting a hard on.&quot; Luke grinned and pulled of the amulet to hold out to Dave, who was starting to strip in preparation for his own change. Once naked, Luke found himself once more admiring his own body, young and lean, and felt his monster cock twitching.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lyle. I think your homophobic bully here is gay.&quot; Luke admitted, shifting the jock strap a bit as his swelling cock pushed against it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not surprised. Let&#39;s see if Derek is, too.&quot; Lyle turned around, holding up a pair of glasses. &quot;Only thing I could find, let&#39;s hope they work. And hope they&#39;re his, I don&#39;t really remember him wearing glasses.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave took the amulet from Luke and put it on, then reached out for the glasses, sliding them on.</p>
