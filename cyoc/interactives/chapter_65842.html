<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A pounding noise drove the sleep away and after a moment Tad heard the voice of his brother saying, &quot;Get downstairs. Dad says dinners on the table,&quot; followed by more pounding and rolling over, feeling the way the sheets and comforter came in contact with his body, the whole bizarre incident involving the costume came back to him.<br />
<br />
Gingerly touched his breasts, knowing for some odd reason that they were a B cup, Tad pressed his palm against the erect nipples and from there, ran a hand down his body, unsure about the four upraised bumps that his hands passed over before stopping just so that they lay flat against what he knew to be his mons pubis. The banging on the door intensified and fearing Ted would break down the door, as he had done in the past, Tad heaved a sigh and called out, &quot;Go away. I'm not feeling well,&quot; which was not far from the truth.<br />
<br />
In fact, if Tad had to describe what he was feeling, it would be in the use of the words of 'Cramped' and 'Bloated'. From the other side of the door, as Tad figured out how he felt, he heard his brother say, &quot;Fine. Whatever,&quot; and then the sound of his brother heading back down the hall, leaving Tad lying in his bed, wondering what the hell was wrong now.<br />
<br />
After a bit he climbed out of bed and fumbled across his room until he found his robe and pulling it on, he undid the lock on his door, forgetting when he actually engaged it, and heading down the hall, he slipped into the bathroom. Discarding his robe, he engaged the locking mechanism in the small room and clicking on the overhead light, he began to go through the vanity that his sister kept a lot of her things in, finally finding the small hand mirror he had seen a couple times lying on the bathroom sink.<br />
<br />
Holding the object between his legs, trying to get a better view at the area that now was his genitals, Tad shifted the mirror about and after a moment ran a hand through the white fur, moving it away from what he for some reason knew to be the vulva, which he saw was slightly redder then when he had looked at hours ago when he was examining the costume before putting it on.<br />
<br />
As he let the hand holding the mirror drop a bit, Tad told himself, &quot;This is not right. I am not a girl, let alone a fox. I am a guy and I am human. I have guy thoughts and do guy things,&quot; and putting the mirror back, he sat down on the edge of the tub, suddenly finding himself at a lost to explain what it meant to be a guy.<br />
<br />
But at the same time, Tad found he did not know what it meant to be a girl, which he considered to be a plus and rubbing a hand across his torso, he wondered why he felt so off. When his hand came in contact with one of these funny bumps, he fetched the mirror once again and angling it, he looked at one of the raised areas, thinking that if he did not know any better, he would have sworn that he had four extra nipples on his body, something he found hard to believe.<br />
<br />
A banging noise on the bathroom door nearly caused him to scream in alarm and before he could say anything, the voice of his brother called out, &quot;Dad says that if you are well enough to get out of bed, then you are well enough to come down for dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sighing, not seeing how to get out of having dinner with the family, Tad shot, &quot;Fine. I'll come down. But if I hurl, it's your fault,&quot; to which Ted spat, &quot;Yeah. You only wish, puke breath,&quot; before stomping back down the hall and down the stairs, leaving Tad sitting on the edge of the tub, staring at the closed door and wondering how to get out of going downstairs, finding that, truthfully, he really did not want to eat anything, but cuddle up under a big, warm comforter, drink a can of 7-UP and watch a movie.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is wrong with me?&quot; Tad thought as he stood and without giving it a second though, headed for the toilet, where he sat down and began to pee.<br />
<br />
Finishing and collecting his robe, Tad headed back to his room, where he began to slowly get dressed in the clothes he had been wearing earlier, partly glad that because he shrunk from six foot two down to about five foot three that his shirt was baggy enough to hide his breast, but at the same time upset because his waist was so much smaller, he had to find a belt with enough notches to actually hold up his pants. Hoping that it was enough and that neither his father, nor his brother or sister would notice that his clothes appeared baggy, Tad took a deep breath and hugging himself in a self-conscious manner, headed downstairs for dinner.<br />
----<br />
<br />
Dinner passed in silence and the most anybody said to Tad was Ted when he commented, &quot;Why the hell are you hugging yourself like that? You look like Samantha when she is on her rag. And what the hell is wrong with your clothes? You going in for the gansta look?&quot; to which Tad only shrugged and told his brother, &quot;Piss off or I hit you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing this, their father called out, &quot;Beat each other on your own time. It's dinner time so sit your butts down, now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Complying, Tad shifted his shirt a bit so that the white fur along his neck could not be seen and sitting down, he began to pick at his dinner. After about half an hour later, most of meal eaten, he asked if he could be excused and when his father said he didn't really care, Tad took his plate to the kitchen, passing Samantha and her friend, who were some reason staring at the seat of Tad's pants and whispering amongst themselves as they did so.<br />
<br />
Back up in his room, Tad locked the door and stripping off his clothes, he pulled the outfit he had purchased out of the bag and setting it down on his bed, he thought about sneaking out to try and find the costume shop again.<br />
<br />
The only thing he could not decide was whether he wanted to do it dressed in his normal clothes, which, except for the shirt he had been wearing, he found for some reason slightly uncomfortable or wear the clothes he had bought, something he was sure would get him labeled as a pervert if he was to be caught wearing them. Lying down on his bed, suddenly feeling like he wanted to cry, he shifted about until he found a comfortable position, his legs spread a bit and his tail resting between them.<br />
<br />
Staring up at the ceiling, he wondered how his life would be different if he just stayed the way he was, neither going to look for the costume shop or putting on the rest of the costume. As he thought, he ran a hand down his torso, gently touching each erect nipple, giving them a gently squeeze before he ran a hand over his mons pubis and between his legs.<br />
<br />
Touching the button-like nub that he for some reason knew to be his clitoris, but unsure and not caring how he knew this, Tad began to massage the tissue as the area around it began to swell and a damp feeling could be felt. Shifting his hand, Tad gave a slight moan of pleasure as he began to insert two fingers into his vagina, his thoughts on how great it felt and how the cramped and bloated feeling had lessened a bit. With a start, and thinking, &quot;What the hell am I doing,&quot; Tad pulled his hand away from his genitals and standing up, realising that that he had just been masturbating like a girl would, Tad closed his eyes and gritting his teeth, he thought, &quot;I have to find that costume shop.&quot;<br />
<br />
And reaching for the clothes on the bed, he began to dress, not really caring that they were more appropriate for a girl, his only thought on sneaking out and finding the shop so that he could somehow put an end to the mess he found himself in. Once dressed, he clicked off his bedroom light and moved toward the window and sliding it up, he began to climb out to the roof that was over the front porch.</p>
