<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>thanks to prev anon author for continuing this branch. Hit me up if you got ideas where to send them next.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The following day, Sunday, Eric woke up in a great mood. He used the bathroom and then got dressed, loving the way his package jiggled under the fabric of a fresh pair of boxers. Then he went to breakfast with Ethan and the brothers hung out together for a while, watching TV. Around midday, Ethan left for a special weekend swim team gathering in prep for an upcoming meet, and Eric was left at home alone, their dad out of the house somewhere else too.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t waste any time, and got right down to practice.<br />
<br />
Thursday had been where he perfected the technique with his second attempt, and Friday he had done it again twice in the evening. Once more on the previous day, Saturday, after going shopping. Sunday gave him his sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth attempts, and counting.<br />
<br />
Uninterrupted, he got down to his favourite hobby and began a marathon of boyish fun. Comfortable on his bed, Eric put on some background music, and he started sucking his cock -- and again and again and again. He didn&#39;t have any sexual interest in other boys -- the thought of other dicks than his own just didn&#39;t make him feel anything much -- but the one he possessed? Being small and slim enough to stick his impressive endowment in his own mouth was like masturbation but waaaaay more interesting. It was a secret naughty game that he got to play by himself and he rapidly became addicted to it without realising, getting the same pleasure from it like he was licking on the most delicious candy. How big and hard it got, how he could slurp up and down and play with the skin under his lips, how it felt like he had an awesome pleasure-cannon joined to his groin. It even became a challenge to see how much cum he could shoot each time.<br />
<br />
By the time Ethan was due to arrive back later in the afternoon, Eric was up to his twelfth selfsucking blowjob. He had spent the last couple of hours with his head effectively glued to his crotch, and he had loved every second of it. Getting dressed, he sat back down to play some video games as he waited for his brother to get home. While the console booted up, he considered his practice sessions. For once, it felt like his sizable penis was actually satisfied, that he&#39;d done a good job draining the practically endless amount of cum in his hefty nuts.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m getting really good at taking care of my cock,&quot; he thought. &quot;I bet more guys wish they could do it, but they can&#39;t because they&#39;re not as big as me.&quot; He laughed to himself. &quot;It&#39;d be cool if I was larger! I wonder if my cock will grow more as I get older.&quot; <br />
<br />
A strange thought came to him, and Eric remembered the swap, though without perceiving it, the younger brother&#39;s concept of cock-ownership fully and consciously moved from &#39;his&#39; to &#39;our&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, I wonder when Ethan will want to have his turn. I think it probably fits me better, but my bro is cool and I love him! -- he deserves some time with our cock. I should be fairer sharing it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then again,&quot; he thought as he heard Ethan arrive home, the car engine turning off, &quot;if he&#39;s happy as he is, there&#39;s no reason for me to bring it up.&quot; Eric grinned as he patted the enormous masculine bulge in his pants. &quot;Getting more practice would be sweet. I can&#39;t wait to suck my cock again.&quot;<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Ethan made it through Sunday no trouble, and he kept thinking he should speak to Eric about swapping back, but every time, he just delayed it. His little brother seemed particularly happy after Ethan got back from his team gathering, like Eric was glowing with good health almost. Ethan didn&#39;t want to rain on that, and he continued to make excuses to himself, until they had gone their separate ways to school on Monday.<br />
<br />
More concerning, he was really starting to get used to it.<br />
<br />
It had been a week and a half of having a small dick, and Ethan&#39;s perverted enjoyment had kept pace with his desire to be normal. He wanted to &#39;fix&#39; his situation, but at the same time he just perpetuated it, over and over.<br />
<br />
His thoughts were a mess for most of the day, and even through swim practice -- which had become a TERRIFYING time for Ethan due to his shrunken crotch -- he was distracted. So much so that he was taken by surprise when Haylee grabbed him, ambushing him into the same supply closet as when the Greg incident had happened a week back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Ethan, I couldn&#39;t resist.&quot; She pushed him carefully against the door. &quot;Just had to get you alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;H-Haylee,&quot; he stammered, &quot;you know I&#39;m still, um, really-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.&quot; She interrupted, and she knelt, pulling his towel away. &quot;You&#39;re hot, and I wanted you big, but I&#39;m also really kinda into you when you&#39;re ... little you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pulling his speedos, they slid down his thighs and he was naked in front of her.<br />
<br />
Mortified, he stared at it in shock as it swelled into a full erection. Less than the length of his thumb it was thin and stiff and he could feel her breath wash over the sensitive foreskin.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s how big it is hard. Oh my god.&quot; Haylee giggled, her attention fixed on his tiny cock. &quot;It&#39;s weird, it really does seem to fit you! Like you&#39;re not a teenage stud, and you&#39;re actually still a little boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiled widely and grabbed it, carefully. Sliding her finger and thumb, she rubbed up and down gently. Ethan shuddered, and suppressed a moan. &quot;It&#39;s so cute! Does it feel good when I do ... this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Leaning in, she kissed it, sliding the entire package into her mouth for a moment. All Ethan could feel was the INCREDIBLE hot wet feeling surrounding his shrunken genitals, but she immediately slid back off again, and he gasped at the cold air rushing in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, let&#39;s give your monster a treat.&quot; Reaching around behind, Haylee undid her bikini top, and pulled it free. Ethan was treated to a view of her glorious C cups, before she pushed them together and forward. The lovely round mounds rubbed against his hairless crotch, and he felt his tiny super-hard penis nestle into her cleavage. Pressed together, he could only incoherently mumble and stutter as he was sandwiched by her soft warm breast-flesh. The smooth skin of his tiny penis slipping up and down created a sensory friction that was both delightful and utterly humiliating.<br />
<br />
With a groan, his legs clenched, and it took only moments before his dick began to twitch, and he was having the best orgasm of his life so far. Ethan&#39;s cock spasmed and it felt like a river was bursting from him, but only a couple of tiny drops spurted from the tip. The splash was so small that the moisture was barely notable at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did anything actually come out? Hard to tell.&quot; She giggled, pulling away, and began to don and refasten her bikini top, not even bothering to wipe herself because there was hardly anything to clean. He could only stare down, trying not to let his complete humiliation show, while she grabbed his speedo and tugged it back up, hiding his softening teeny dick. &quot;It looks like your python needs a nap, he&#39;s all shriveled up now.&quot;<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t speak, embarrassed wordless, and she laughed softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, big guy.&quot; Haylee kissed him, her amused grin still wide, her hand lingering on his cheek. &quot;You&#39;re a good sport, stud. Hope we can get together some time for real. I&#39;ll be interested -- no matter the size.&quot; She whispered the last part before she slipped out of the supply closet, giggling to herself about what had just happened.<br />
<br />
Finally, Ethan&#39;s brain managed to engage ... and he promptly freaked out.<br />
<br />
Everything about what had just happened scared him, because of how it made him feel and react -- both because he hated it, and because he loved it FAR too much.<br />
<br />
Rushing to the changing room, he quickly found his stuff and rifled through it, looking for the ring.<br />
<br />
He had to end this and swap back now!<br />
<br />
Finding a pair of Eric&#39;s exercise shorts he had stashed in his gear, he locked himself into a stall and pulled them on, only just managing to fit his legs into the stretchy material.<br />
<br />
He would explain to Eric later about why he had to do an emergency swap -- for now, he had to change back and end this freaky torment!<br />
<br />
Concentrating, he focused on swapping their dicks.<br />
<br />
But ... nothing happened.<br />
<br />
Confused, Ethan tried again.<br />
<br />
No change.<br />
<br />
And a third time?<br />
<br />
Nothing.<br />
<br />
Then like a counter-reaction to his failed attempts, he felt a zap from the ring like electricity, and he was dizzy for a moment, as knowledge magically entered into his brain.<br />
<br />
Like a voice-recording, it spoke words that he heard in his head, like it was giving user instructions.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can only swap if you are truly comfortable doing so. The feelings of the other person do not matter, but if in your own heart you are unwilling to do it -- even if you consciously wish to -- the swap will still fail.&quot;<br />
<br />
Only if he was truly comfortable?<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no. No no no!&quot; He murmured to himself, horrified. He ... wanted this?<br />
<br />
There was no way.<br />
<br />
But ... he HAD kept thinking of it as &#39;his&#39; cock, and now ... it WAS.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not meant to be this way! I need to get Eric to help me!&quot; He thought desperately, as he stared down at the teeny bump of his undersized junk.  &quot;I don&#39;t have the penis of an 11 year old!&quot;<br />
<br />
Yet, the whisper of his conscience, in the back of his mind, was gleefully speaking: &#39;yes you do ... and you need to find a way to keep it!&#39;<br />
<br />
Between his thighs, his tiny youthful cock started to harden again, stiffening against the material as it agreed completely.</p>
