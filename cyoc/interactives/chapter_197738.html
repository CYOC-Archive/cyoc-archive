<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emily mulled over which mode and setting to choose, but ultimately couldn’t decide. For the sake of making it interesting she selected the fifth mode ‘Blend In’ which seemed odd to her as it wasn&#39;t really &#39;blending in&#39; anymore, as the fifth setting made the subject would become the opposite of their environment. “Whatever that really means.” The cute brunette thought to herself.<br />
<br />
“Alright, who are we changing first!?” Rick asked, a little too excited to completely change a stranger’s life.<br />
<br />
“Hold on, I’m still looking.” Replied Emily as she scanned the mall for a potential victim. &quot;Better look in the stores...&quot; She thought to herself, eventually spotting a pair of teenaged girls shopping. The two blondes were blabbing away. One held the large red bags in the clothing store while the other was looking through dress after dress. She aimed at the girl holding the bags then...<br />
<br />
*FLASH*<br />
<br />
Emily lowered the camera to inspect the girl’s transformation, but was just a little bit perplexed as to what she had become. In her place was a tall, overweight middle aged man. He had thinning blonde hair, a business suit, and a bit of a beer belly growing through hiss stomach. The man seemed impatient, and was tapping his foot while he now seemingly talked to the other girl with frustration.<br />
<br />
The girl, meanwhile, seemed to be holding up a dress, begging to have it. The now man shook his head, placed back the dress, then pulled the girl along. Instead of two large red bags, they had just one from an electronics store.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, Rick, did you see that?!&quot; Emily asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess we know what the &#39;reverse&#39; means...&quot; Rick muttered. &quot;Though, it kinda seems arbitrary right? Like, is that guy her dad now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sort of... and maybe?&quot; Emily agreed. She looked down at the camera and smirked. &quot;I guess we&#39;ll have to just keep experimenting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily glanced around again before spotting a nerd in a Gamestop. He was Caucasian, a little overweight, had curly brown, unkept hair and lots of zits. His shirt was some anime and his jeans barely held his weight in, likely being a size too small. He was browsing by the Playstation games.<br />
<br />
*FLASH*<br />
<br />
Emily lowered the camera and was a little less surprised this time around. In the nerds place was a fit woman. She was still Caucasian, and still had curly brown hair but it was clearly longer, being tied up in a tight bun. Her skin was flawless, but almost had a shine too it which Emily assumed was sweat. She was wearing a tight, green and blue sports bra and yoga pants combo. The woman looked around, sneering at the store she was in. <br />
<br />
With a shrug, she placed airpods in her ears, then began to jog, quickly leaving the store. Rick couldn&#39;t help but watch the large butt of this woman as she shuffled past them. Emily noticed, then gave him a glare with an eye brow raise.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Rick laughed awkwardly. &quot;I&#39;m just checking our work! Besides, I wouldn&#39;t ever even think about it, I know who she used to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily just rolled her eyes. That wasn&#39;t the answer she wanted, but decided to leave it alone for now. She can easily get Rick back later.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine. Anyway, now we got more info. It seems like it&#39;s stereotype based? Like that bad idea that women and fit people don&#39;t play video games.&quot; Emily reasoned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely.&quot; Rick agreed, just glad Emily wasn&#39;t pissed. &quot;It&#39;s weird how both of them immediately left where they were huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really. Imagine your least favorite store ever. Like, if you suddenly found yourself there you&#39;d leave too.&quot; Emily chuckled.<br />
<br />
Rick silently agreed, figuring it made sense. They continued to walk past shops, looking for more target when Emily decided she wanted to try and get two people at once. How similar would they be? After another minute of scanning the mall, she spotted her two potential targets in the food court area. Right under the Chik-fil-a.<br />
<br />
There were three people not standing on line, but were standing in the Chik-fil-a section, sipping on different drinks. Emily gestured towards Rick, then to the group. They both smirked, and after a few minutes of looking found seats close enough to overhear this group of people.<br />
<br />
They were a group of two men and one woman. One was a tall, blonde man, about mid-twenties. He was dressed modestly, just jeans and a red t-shirt. He had just walked up to the group, holding a paper bag in one hand and a tray of drinks in the other.<br />
&quot;Hey! Brianna, Fred, I got the food.&quot; He said with a smile, handing the bag and tray over to each of the other two.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Chuck.&quot; The black girl replied happily, grabbing the bag with a grin. &quot;Hmm, love this place.&quot; She muttered. She was a pretty girl, with long, braided hair down to her butt, and a good foundation of makeup. She wore a white shirt and dark skirt, which really emphasized her thicker thighs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah dude thanks.&quot; The final guy said before grabbing the tray and putting his arm around Brianna&#39;s waist. Emily tried not to stare, but Fred was HOT. He had jet black hair in a crew cut, killer abs and what looked like a decent package from the slight bulge Emily could see. He wore a white tank top and dark blue jeans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I&#39;m gonna change that couple.&quot; Emily said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the blonde dude?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;ll be the control for this.&quot; She replied before raising the camera.<br />
<br />
*FLASH*<br />
<br />
Emily lowered the camera to find the two who had once been standing so close were not somewhat apart... and VERY different. Fred was the most different, now no longer over 6 feet but rather more like 5&#39;4. Not only that, but he was now a she, and Asian at that. She black hair that reached her shoulders, pale skin, and a gorgeous red dress which highlighted her now big butt. She held the drinks, trying to not let them drop.<br />
<br />
Near her was now &#39;Brian&#39; instead of Brianna. He was a tall black man, with short kinky hair and still had some makeup. With a pink shirt and an ear still pierced, it wasn&#39;t hard to tell he was still into men. He was also pretty fit, though not as fit as Fred had been. He looked upset, however, in stark contrast to how happy Brianna had been.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, come on Chuckie.&quot; He groaned. &quot;Why&#39;d you have to get Chik-fil-a? They&#39;re major homophobes.&quot; He groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I know I told you man we&#39;d only get it this once. Fen never had any before.&quot; Chuck replied, now grabbing onto &#39;Fen&#39;s&#39; waist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, we no have this in China.&quot; She giggled. &quot;I always want to try once we moved here.&quot; She replied with a slight accent in her voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course baby.&quot; Chuck laughed, giving Fen a quick kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, straight people.&quot; Brian half joked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up man.&quot; Chuck laughed, slugging his friend&#39;s arm as the three walked off. &quot;We gotta get you a guy.&quot; He said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me about it, it&#39;s been way too long.&quot; Brian replied, and Emily saw as he said that he was rubbing his ass as if remembering.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow.&quot; Rick muttered. &quot;That teach you something?&quot; He joked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I guess, A Chinese woman would be the opposite of a male run, American company?&quot; She guessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;And a gay guy definitely wouldn&#39;t go to Chik-fil-a.&quot; Rick added.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, since they didn&#39;t just turn into two foreign women or gays... then I guess the kind of &#39;opposite&#39; the camera chooses depends on just... whatever it feels like?&quot; She wondered aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;This thing is so cool!&quot; Rick laughed. &quot;Can I get a turn?&quot; He asked, though Emily was lost in thought, wondering what other things the camera could do, or what other changes they could make.</p>
