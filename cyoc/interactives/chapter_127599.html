<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam was playing on his PC when the package arrived. When he went to ge the door, no one was there. “Oh well” he thought to himself,” what could go wrong?”<br />
He plugged it into his computer, and among seeing the wide variety of options, such as jock, stud, nerd, fat, gay, tall, short, including many more. Sam has always fantasized about his friend Tristan, but never had to courage to tell him how he felt, so he clicked on Skater, deciding to become Tristan. He selected time to: 5 minutes, checked the “reality change” as well as checking the “pleasuring” box, having no idea what it could mean. He clicked GO and went back to playing his game. Unknown to him, his surroundings were slowly changing with the time amount he had selected. “Man, its getting hot in here” he thought to himself, not noticing as his many numerous fans disappeared, and one side of the wall faded away to reveal a window. It was open of course. Instantly, the walls changed from a grayish-black to a darker orange, in line with the soon to be skater trend. His top of the line gaming chair, and the keyboard in hand, morphed into a beaten up xbox controller, and the chair morphed into a bed, on which he was sitting. His monitor morphed into wide screen bulky tv, and the desk morphed into a drawer stand, where cloths could be kept. The door to his bathroom moved a little, while a door appeared, probably for a closet. Sam didn’t notice any of this, except for his dick starting to get hard in his pants, he noticed this but didn’t really care. He knew that he was a teenager, he jacked off all the time. But, this thought was strange to him. It was something that he would never normally think about. The more he thought about it, the more he was sold onto the idea of jacking off on his bed. He decided too, and he shed his pants his shirt. Again, those clothes turned into different clothes, like everything in the room, it changed into skater clothes. Posters of skaters started to plaster themselves to the wall. But Sam was getting busy exploring himself as the final changes approached. Laying down on his bed, he looked down at his bulge and his legs. His legs started to shorten, along with his torso. His legs toned themselves, gaining a coat of light blond hair, as well as his feet bursting out of his socks, becoming a size 13. They too were covered in light blond hair. Your chest pushes slightly forward and up, forming a pair of pecs. Hair begans to fill in, blond hair, which flows down your chest, torso, and into your underwear. Your abs carve themselves under the treasure trail, into a nice 6 pack. The changes travel up to your neck, which gains a little muscle. But the real changes happen to your head. The general shape rounds out, your nose flattens out a bit, and you gain some blond stubble on your chin as it rounds out with your head. The best part is to come. Sam reaches in his underwear, which morphs into a jockstrap, and yanks it off. There lies his dick, but not for long. It begins pumping up, thickening. His pubes grow into a bigger bush, colored blond, and they hide his balls for few seconds, but they soon droop between his thighs and expand and grow, becoming the size of ping pong balls. He starts to jack off his new rod, each time he strokes it, it gains back some of its foreskin until its all there and complete, and hes left with a big pair of balls with a big dick too match. He is about to blow, when he remembers his name, Tristan. He moans and cums onto his bed and jockstrap, adding another stain to it and more smell to the bedroom. He gets up and admires his new body in the mirror, legs and feet with great muscle tone and very hair, large pubes, dick, and balls. Going up to his chest he stares at his pecs and bigger nipples, and starts touching them, giving into temptation to jack off again, already ready do go, he starts stroking his dick, and then looks up t his face. With that blonde stubble and hair, as well as that nose, and those beautiful eyes, he’s about cum again, and he does, all over the mirror. “Damn I’m hot.” He tells himself in deeper voice from the changes, he then decides to....</p>
