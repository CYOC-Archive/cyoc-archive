<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">All through town the news of Julie Stovall’s sentence spreads like wildfire. Weres receiving the news via text from a friend that works at the council building; Council member texting or calling their families to inform them. Spencer, Eric and Frieda informing their family directly. As Lance was busy driving them and his girlfriend/fiancé back to Benton’s estate; Eric and Spencer were texting their families. For Eric it was his parents and Nate. For Spencer it was her parents and grandfather.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
At Moon Lake High; Nate was just sitting down to lunch; joining his friends Ben and Alex and two other werewolves in their pack for lunch. Nate was about to eagerly dive in his lunch tray of spaghetti and meatballs when he gets a text on his phone. Seeing it’s from Eric his eyes go wide as he reads the message.<br />
“Julie just got a sentence of a hundred and fifty years for her statue 1A violations.”<br />
“Your kidding, “Ben twist holding a forkful of spaghetti that falls back on his plate.<br />
“Nope,” Nate answering; “Eric texted me the news, he was at the council building today.”<br />
“Lucky were-panther,” Alex rolling his eyes; “he gets to be excused from all these mock exams our teachers are giving us.”<br />
“If Julie had of succeeded,” Nate growling; “my brother would of still had to be at the council, only miserable because he was turned against his will. Try and remember that, Alex.”<br />
“Sorry,” Alex answering; “I’m just jealous your brother gets to ditch without consequence.”<br />
<br />
Nate just shrugs his shoulders as he eats his lunch; slurping his spaghetti as the noodles dangle from his fork, his phone goes off again with another text.<br />
“More council news,” one pack member asks?<br />
“No,” Nate smiling; “evening plans with a sexy were-lioness I’ve been seeing.”<br />
“So that is what I’ve smelled on you,” another pack member grins; “you have a girlfriend and didn’t tell us?”<br />
“Ben and Alex know,” Nate smiles; “and she is more than just a girlfriend. I think she’s my mate. We intend to spend the night,” Nate grins; “at her place. Then she is joining us for a shopping trip in Seattle,” Nate looking at Ben and Alex.<br />
“You two don’t know this,” Ben chuckling at their pack members; “but Nate our young werewolf has been rutting Leon Talbot’s daughter.”<br />
“The were-lion king,” one werewolf looking shocked; “that were-lion king?”<br />
“The same,” Nate smiling; “and he wants Jean to take over as the were-lion rep for the council one day. And just to let you all know,” Nate laughing; “Eric is seeing Frieda Knight, the future were-panther rep.”<br />
<br />
As the five werewolves talk over lunch with how lucky Nate and Eric have been; several other weres could not help but overhear Julie’s sentence. News of it traveled fast and furious and soon it was all anybody could talk about.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Moon Lake College; William Anderson was just sitting down to relax in the faculty lounge after finishing up his morning classes. Wanting to spend an hour to eat his lunch; his phone buzzes with a message from Eric.<br />
‘150 year sentence for Julie. On my way back to Frieda’s place. Might not be home until tomorrow. I already texted mom and Nate.’<br />
“Hundred and fifty year sentence,” William blurts out; “I thought she was going to get life?”<br />
“Who did you thought was about to get life,” a person speaks entering the facility lounge.<br />
<br />
William turns around to see Dean Myers; a naturally born were-tiger with a kindly soul unless someone threatens his staff or students. The man sitting next to William asks again; “Who did you thought was about to get life?”<br />
“Julie Stovall,” William answering; “she tried to turn my youngest son into a wer-mer twice. Thankfully she failed both times.”<br />
“You’re referring to Eric,” Dean Myers asking; “he is your youngest son right?”<br />
“Yeah Eric,” William confirming; “he and Frieda Knight had to be at the elder council building yesterday and today for Julie’s Statue 1A trial.”<br />
“Good on the council then,” Dean Myers thinking; “the mayor must be beside himself.”<br />
“I could care less if Mayor Stovall is beside himself or not,” William snorting; “his daughter broke the law. Hell she got off on Assault charges last Wednesday due to a technicality. Both Benton and I weren’t exactly thrilled at that,” looking at the dean; “and he and I were both present to see Julie’s slick lawyer get her off.”<br />
“Whether you care or not,” Dean Myers getting up; “mayor Stovall lost a daughter. As a father myself, I can only imagine the grief he is going through.”<br />
“Yet it wasn’t your child,” William is growling; “who was still a normal at the time he was attacked by a wer-mer. Eric was a normal fourteen year old boy,” William now snarling; his were-fox fusona on the verge of coming forth; “now he is a were-panther and has two girlfriends that are clearly his mates.”<br />
“Did he become a were-panther willingly,” Dean Myers remaining calm, despite William Anderson’s anger spilling forth.<br />
“Yes,” William calming down; “Eric became a were-panther by having a three way with his girlfriend Spencer Lawson and his now second girlfriend Frieda Knight.”<br />
“So Eric and Spencer are no longer an item,” the dean asking.<br />
“No,” William unable to suppress a smile; “my son is rutting with both Spencer and Frieda. They have a bond of some kind,” William doing his best to explain; “it’s like a bond a were-fox forms with their mate only more intense. It also makes them emotionally in tune with each other and their eyes are a vivid green, both in and out of their fursonas.<br />
“That’s,” Dean Myers looking confused; “that’s interesting.”<br />
“That’s not the half of it,” William shaking his head; “the smell of their scents when combine due to rutting, acts like an aphrodisiac to other weres. In other words,” William grinning; “if they are making love, you and your mate will soon be doing the same thing once you get a whiff of them. I should know, Martha and I have been having wild sex of late. Wilder then typical were-sex.”<br />
“Sounds like you have your paws full with three horny teens then,” Dean Myers chuckling. “But on a serious note,” the Dean getting up; “you may be happy with the sentence Julie got, but her parents are most likely grieving over their loss. Don’t add to their pain.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
In a science room of Moon Lake High, three teenage girls each weres, were busy gossiping amongst themselves. Not caring that they could receive a detention for talking in class.<br />
“Julie just got sentenced,” one girl whispering; “one hundred and fifty years.”<br />
“Guess that means,” another whispering; ”that we are the last to stop being Julie’s friends. Do either of you intend to visit her in prison?”<br />
“Does anyone,” the third whispering; “even know were the were-prison is located?”<br />
“Even if I did,” the first girl whispering; “I’m not visiting her. Not after having my were-mink gathering cancelled due to the were-alert.”<br />
“So you have to wait in inducting the latest member into your small group, ”the second girl whispers again; “you’ll just get to do it tonight and be able to spend the weekend feeling his new were-mink rod inside of you.”<br />
“Oh yeah,” the first girl smiles; “he is a dreamy hunk.”<br />
“Am I the only one actually trying to prep for this mock exam,” the third girl whispering; “I don’t want to fail the real one next week.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Meanwhile; as Samantha and Frances were snuggled in bed; each in their respective fursonas, Frances brother Samson lets himself in the house. Having a day off from work, what with last night’s were-alert; he places a bag of groceries on the kitchen table and starts cooking a meal for his sister and life partner.<br />
“You may not be keen on red meat sis,” Samson talking to himself; “but I doubt you’d be able to resist some salmon fillets with pan fried potatoes and steamed cauliflower.”<br />
<br />
Back upstairs, Frances and Samantha purr as the smell of salmon starts to hit their noses; both beginning to stir as their kittens’ Jasmine and Saffron snuggled in between mewl as they are woken up with movement.<br />
“Did you leave something on the stove,” Samantha looking at Frances?<br />
“No,” Frances yawning; “I went to bed the moment I came home.”<br />
“If you two are now awake,” Samson shouting; “why not come down for some lunch!”<br />
“Samson,” Samantha looking confused; “How did he get in the house?”<br />
“I gave him a key,” Frances yawning; “for emergency purposes only.”<br />
“Hurry up you two,” Samson shouting; “before the salmon burns!”<br />
<br />
Hearing and smelling salmon finally wakes the two hungry were-cats as they lick their lips, salivating at the prospect of eating fish. Each getting up to collect a kitten; they quickly head downstairs, in their fursonas to see Samson already shifted into his Alaskan malamute were-form.<br />
“I got your message sis,” Samson looking at Frances and Samantha sitting down; “I figured you two needed something decent to eat.”<br />
“That is true,” Frances answering but then grinning; “but we’ll settle for what you cobbled together.”<br />
“Ugh,” Samson scoffs; “yee of little faith sis. Just because I spend most of my mealtimes microwaving dinner,” Samson putting two plates of cooked Salmon with potatoes and cauliflower on the table; “doesn’t mean I don’t know how to use a stove.”<br />
<br />
Samantha and Frances both laugh as Samson sits next to them; eagerly listening to both were-cats respective evenings. Neither aware that Julie Stovall&#39;s sentence was announced an hour ago and that news of it has spread all throughout town.</p>
