<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“W-we should change her back.” Harry stammered staring at Hailey’s sheath-eyes as they gently closed in post-coital bliss.&#8232;&#8232;“No way! It’s not everyday you get to be a big doggy wiener!” Jake shouted back at his little brother, shocked he’d even say such a thing. “I mean, there’s still so many things we can do with her! Imagine how good she must feel!”<br />
<br />
“B-but what if she doesn’t like it!” Harry said as he watched the crimson doggy dick lazily recede back inside its home. “If she wants to go back to being a wiener, we can change her back, but I think she might need a break from all this.”&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
“Well… okay.” Jake relented, patting Danny on the head before heading back inside. “I’ll set her back to normal. Just stay here and make sure Danny doesn’t run away or anything.”&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
Harry nods back to his brother before commanding the stud dog to lay down and roll over. As Danny wobbled on his back, the the stretchy tube of doggy flesh flopped into the sunlight, Haley’s velvety sheath mouth shuddering as it swallowed the last few sensitive centimeters of red rocket, one last spurt of gooey cum drooling from the tip before diving inside. As the girl-turned cock sunned herself between Danny’s hind legs, Harry climbed up and straddled the dog’s torso, sitting on Danny and holding him in place as the trio waited for things to go back to normal.&#8232;&#8232;“Calm down, Danny. Good boy.” Harry gently pat the dog’s side. Fortunately Danny was a large breed, able to hold the weight of an eight year old boy without any trouble. “Any minute Hailey, you’ll be a girl again any minute now.”<br />
<br />
Fifty seconds of pregnant silence shrouded the backyard, Harry left with nothing to do but stare at his mistress as her sheath opening glazed with doggy semen leisurely dilated open and closed. <br />
<br />
“Any minute now…” The young boy shifted awkwardly on his pet, wondering if Haley even had the faculties to hear him. Reaching out a hand he gently grasped the sheath, hoping his reassuring touch would mean something to her. His tiny hand squeezing it, feeling that rock hard cock inside as Haley’s eye lidded open just a little. Another healthy dollop of canine jizz oozed from the tip, leaking out onto the boy’s hand as he watched everything with bated breath. “Haley… you smell really good…”<br />
<br />
———<br />
<br />
&#8232;Haley shuddered and squelched in delight, squealing and moaning in her thoughts as she opened her sheath-mouth wide, drooling more slick dick juice on her sex-servant’s hand. A full-body massage - the little boy stroking every inch of her body, tugging her up and down as he unknowingly treated her to a hand job.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmph, Harry…&quot; She purred in her mind. It didn’t seem so embarrassing now. In fact, pumping Carly full of puppy batter made her feel a little proud. Making her a bitch, changing her. It made her feel so good.<br />
<br />
Being used. Her new purpose covered all other thoughts like a haze, memories of her old body beginning to seem alien and foreign to her new desires. How would arms, legs, and a head help with filling mates with doggy cum? Maybe… She would be okay with spending a little while long as a cock. <br />
<br />
Haley tried to contract, trying her best to fight the refractory period from her last orgasm, trying to squeeze at her steaming hot hotdog from her sheath-maw for Harry to enjoy, her sheath-eyes screwing shut until suddenly jumping wide open.<br />
<br />
——<br />
<br />
Squelch! Harry’s tongue hovered just an inch above that pudgy doggy sheath, a string of yellow-white jizz connecting his lips to Haley. The boy blushed in shivered, his tongue dipping backside his mouth smearing his tastebuds with the taste of canine semen. Metallic, salty, and hot.<br />
<br />
The eight year-old boy’s inhibition melted away as he puckered his lips and kissed Haley on the only place it made sense. Haley suddenly grew more plump, balls visibly bloating and sloshing with more puppy batter as her sex-servant made out with out with her velvety sheath-maw. As Harry’s spittle intermingled with Haley’s jizz, he felt Haley’s sheath slop open and press up against him like a pair of lips, opening up and accepting the boy’s tongue inside.<br />
<br />
Moaning out, worshipping the cock that used to be his little sister, Harry reclined on top of Danny, French kissing Haley and imbibing himself in the heaven of pure canine masculinity. Hot. Juicy. And… hay-y?<br />
<br />
Harry’s tongue hungrily slurped the inside of his mistress, his face smooshed against the stretchy opening of Haley’s sheath flesh as it yawned even wider.<br />
<br />
Hay. Sweet grass. The little boy’s mind raced as he savored his mistress’s taste as it grew more complex. The spicy taste of canine stud-hood started to become milder, that metallic taste subsiding as it took on the taste of… meat.<br />
<br />
It was all he could describe it as. Hot, savory meat from some sort of farm animal. But not dead - it was alive and vivid. Harry slurped up Haley’s gooey insides, not realizing Danny’s torso rising higher underneath the boy with deeper, heavier breaths.<br />
<br />
——<br />
<br />
“Sorry Harry, I just can’t resist.” Jake smiled mischievously as he stared at the screen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shire Stallion.&quot; The screen read over Danny’s name, &quot;2%&quot;. Slowly but surely that percent began to increment. Jake’s eyes wandered to an options panel, wondering what else would make Haley even happier.<br />
<br />
“I wonder… how big could he be…”<br />
<br />
“Sampson a Shire horse”, read a tiny blurb on screen as a robotic voice read out the text, “standing at seven and a half feet at the withers, he was the world’s biggest horse ever.”<br />
<br />
“We can beat that.” Jake chuckled maxing out sliders on height and weight. “The bigger the better, right?” He said as he watched the progress bar for Danny reach 10% horse.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
“More. More.” Harry mumbled to himself, his pleas for Haley’s developing horse scent muffled by the multiplying folds go Haley-sheath pressing against his mouth. A wet slopping sound resounded against Harry’s ears and for a moment, he couldn’t hear anything else but Danny’s heartbeat. He wore his mistress’s sheath-lips as a collar around his neck. Nothing but Haley’s smell. The smell… the taste of overwhelming stallionhood…&#8232;&#8232;The eight year old boy gasped for breath as he tugged his head free, his entire face covered in thick gooey pre. Things have changed. His feet no longer touched the ground. The transforming dog managed to stay rolled on his back as the changes washed over him. Danny’s fur was shorter now, its color having changed from a messy brown to a shiny black. As the changing dog’s belly grew larger, the boy could feel himself carried further and further away from Haley.<br />
<br />
“W-wait. What’s happening?” Harry panicked, watching the changes engulf Danny as he realized the horse’s belly was too big to jump off without hurting himself. Danny’s hind legs  began kicking in the air as they grew into mountainous flanks of tight horse muscle. Clawing paws became entombed in solid black keratin forming hooves the size of laundry baskets, black fur covering the tree-trunked sized horse legs as they wavered in the air.<br />
<br />
“H-Haley…?” Harry’s eyes widened as they shifted to his mistress fused to the stallion’s groin. He could see why his head got stuck inside her. Haley… her sheath parts… they looked more like a furry sleeping bag. Velvety horse fuzz covered that thick pliant hide composing her sheath. Looking her in the eyes, he saw her eyes clenching again like she was trying really hard to do something.<br />
<br />
“Haley? Are you okay?” The little servant asked with a tinge of panic in his voice. His mistress responded, her balls twitching as her taut scrotum stretched, her jewels increasing from the size of tennis balls to oranges. <br />
<br />
——<br />
<br />
Passionate stallion blood eked into Haley’s veins, forcing her to adopt more single-minded desires. A cock fit for a stallion, the best stallion. Virile. Irresistible. Overwhelming.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hah- Oh God, what’s happening?&quot;<br />
<br />
In spasming fits, Haley’s leather testicles became pumped full of testosterone as they shed their canine essence for an equine one. The little girl trapped in the shape of a cock forced to endure every moment of tortuous bliss. Haley felt her peach-fuzz horse fur stand on edge as she tensed and contract, tensed and contracted. Each part of her body swelling larger each time.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Softballs. Melons. Basketballs. This was her. Whether she wanted it or not, she was a tool to be used. Her eyes peaked open looking on at Harry watching his reaction to her new horse jewels flourishing into their rightful giant size.<br />
<br />
——<br />
<br />
Danny rumbled and whirred beneath him as the monstrous horse reached his final shape. Underneath his tiny tush was three tons of horse muscle, longer than a pickup truck, so wide Harry could hardly stay perched on his belly.<br />
<br />
Haley’s eyes gazed at her little servant as her giant foal factories started to slow their growth too. She squeezed, her sheath-maw widening as her new member came into view.&#8232;&#8232;A miasma of stallion musk drenched the air, forcing the little boy to drink in Haley’s scent as as her glans sloped out from her sheath-lips. Harry quivered and drooled as inch after inch of cock extruded out. Jet black and covered in a slick sheen of pre, the prehensile length snaked along Danny’s stomach towards Harry. Blood filled the shaft forcing Haley to elongate. Glistening member jabbing the boy in the chest, smearing it with smelly stallion pre as it oozed down onto his pants.<br />
<br />
With trembling hands, the little boy grasped that inflated equine glans, feeling its weight as he shifted it in front of his head. “H-Haley?”<br />
<br />
With a gingerly caress, the mighty male organ shifted to the side, pecking Harry on the cheek. The tip, wide enough to swallow the boy’s fist, oozed a glob of sticky cum against his adolescent skin, the urethra contracting and dilating as if Haley were simulating a kiss.<br />
<br />
Harry understood, pulling Haley’s penile mouth to his lips. Rubbery horse flesh embracing his tender young skin for the first time.<br />
<br />
Hay. Sweet grass. The savory smell of stallion. He remembered the time just minutes ago where his whole head was inside her. So warm.<br />
<br />
So warm.<br />
<br />
— —<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! Oh God!&quot;<br />
<br />
Shivering and roiling with ecstasy, more blood was pumped into Haley’s body, compelling her to grow. Bigger. Wider.<br />
<br />
Pain and pleasure merged into one as she felt her shaft inflate as if she were pregnant. Bigger. Wider.<br />
<br />
Any concern for Harry, any concern for anything, it all melted away behind her need for pleasure. Bigger. Wider.<br />
<br />
— —<br />
<br />
“Danny - Haley.- … Harry?” Jake looked puzzled at the screen as Harry’s name merged with the other two.<br />
<br />
Human. The screen read out, reassuring Jake that things were okay. However, it was followed by a loading bar that read, &quot;Processing&quot;.<br />
<br />
— —<br />
<br />
Jake ran back upstairs and peered outside only to be amazed by Danny standing on all fours in his full stallion majesty. “Whoa.” The boy marveled at the horse, the stallion’s sheer size eclipsing the sun as the stud sauntered over to him and a docile manner.<br />
<br />
Haley hung from her sheath, tip flared, gooey strands of cum oozing from her engorged urethra as her balls pendulously swayed between the stallion’s legs, rubbing up against his thighs.<br />
<br />
“Whoooaaaa.” Jake repeated again, marveling at his mistress’s virility, gently poking her rubbery cock flesh to try to comprehend her sheer weight.<br />
<br />
“Harry must’ve chickened out or something.” He whispered under his breath, trying to reassure himself the Chronovac’s readings were in error. “You doing okay Haley?”<br />
<br />
His only response were her eyes hanging on either side of her sheath. They were wide. Shocked? Excited? Jake couldn’t tell.</p>
