<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vect closed the door behind him after hanging a &#39;do not disturb&#39; sign on the handle. Walking over to his trunk and unlocking it, he proceeded to withdraw the wrapped object. Through the cloth wrappings, he could feel it shifting like a heartbeat. The idea still unsettled him at times, which was why he usually didn&#39;t carry it around with him. Placing the unwrapped heart on a pillow on the floor, Vect took a seat across from it. Sitting with his legs crossed Vect rested his hands on his knees and began the breathing exercises Shaman Gratz had taught them back at camp before the Joining Ceremony. He inhaled through his nose and out through his mouth, closing his eyes and letting himself relax. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is to ease your body and mind, to allow you to listen to your spirit,&quot; he had taught. Some claimed to have heard the spirit speak, but most didn&#39;t including Vect. Still, it couldn&#39;t hurt to try every once in a while, the spirit probably appreciated the effort at least. If Vect had his eyes open he would have seen the dragon heart begin to match his own rhythm. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s about time,&quot; someone said. Startled, Vect&#39;s eyes shot open and he saw a massive red dragon across from him. The red scales shined like rubies, and yellow eyes like amber or molten gold. A pair of long black horns pointed backwards from the back of its head. Vect could only guess at its size. Possibly 80 feet long, more? <br />
For a few moments all Vect could accomplish was stare. Even though the dragon was laying down, its head still towered over him on it&#39;s long neck. &quot;I was beginning to wonder if you&#39;d forgotten about me,&quot; it spoke with a deep rumble, Vect could hear a hint of femininity in its voice. <br />
&quot;Well, speak up. It&#39;s about time we had a chat.&quot; <br />
&quot;Who- who are you,&quot; Vect asked hesitantly as he got to his feet. &quot;Where are we,&quot; he asked as he looked around the white void the 2 of them were sitting in, nothing but white emptiness in all directions.<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t it obvious? I&#39;d hoped my choice in partner was more clever than this.&quot;<br />
&quot;No no no, I mean what do I call you?&quot;<br />
It, she?, seemed to think for a while before speaking. &quot;Dragon&#39;s names are usually hard to pronounce for non-dragons.&quot; She let out what sounded like series of grunts and roars. &quot;See?&quot; &#39;That&#39;s her name,&#39; Vect thought.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve heard that those that interact with humans and the like choose a name for them to be called by, so why not ....Erress? That sounds easy enough for you to pronounce. As to where we are well it&#39;s your mind.&quot;<br />
Vect looked around the white void. &quot;It&#39;s....a lot more empty than I had expected it to be,&quot; he looked down slightly embarrassed. &#39;Not even a chair or pillow to sit on for us,&#39; he thought to himself. As if to answer him a simple bar stool appeared between them.<br />
&quot;Not quite so empty as you think,&quot; Vect could swear Erress was smiling. &quot;Try thinking of something else for us, something with scenery,&quot; she suggested. Memories of places Vect had been began flooding to his mind until he seemed to concentrate on a forest clearing, the same one as their BTC trial, and the white void was replaced with it. Birds could be heard unseen in the trees. &quot;Oh, this is a nice place,&quot; she rumbled. Vect smiled and then Erress was surprised to find herself being lifted up by something below her. Mounds of gold and treasure appeared underneath the colossal dragon. She seemed to let out a sigh and settled down, &quot;thank you for this. I&#39;ve missed this feeling.&quot; <br />
&quot;I&#39;d read a little on dragon&#39;s when I was little,&quot; he shrugged.<br />
&quot;You are still little.&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Vect rolled his eyes.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still mad at you.&quot;<br />
&quot;What in 9 hells did I do,&quot; he then lowered his eyes. &quot;Its because I haven&#39;t joined with you isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
He heard a low rumbling deep in the dragon&#39;s throat, followed by it shaking slightly. &quot;No of course not that you silly boy,&quot; she said in an amused tone.<br />
<br />
 &#39;Wait was that a dragon&#39;s laugh?&#39;<br />
&quot;Then what is it?&quot;<br />
&quot;The part about leaving me locked in a chest for starters,&quot; she said lowering her head closer to him. <br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t want you to get damaged,&quot; he said.<br />
&quot;Half true. My vessel cannot be damaged. Remember I am in your head, I can tell when you are lying.&quot;<br />
He sighed. &quot;Ok fine....its weird feeling you near me.&quot;<br />
&quot;The point of keeping me near you is so you&#39;ll get used to my presence before we join,&quot; she scolded.<br />
&quot;And the second reason dare I ask?&quot;<br />
&quot;Since the ceremony, you haven&#39;t bothered to try to reach out to me.&quot;<br />
Vect took a deep breath. &quot;You never spoke to me before. So why now? I didn&#39;t bother because I never had any contact with you before now,&quot; Vect said angrily.<br />
Erress straightened up. &quot;I was going to wait until we joined to talk. But since you never went through with the ritual I never had a chance to talk to you,&quot; she said indignantly.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s your own fault! If I&#39;d known you wanted to talk, then I&#39;d have made an effort until now. Beverly is the whole reason why I&#39;m here now!&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, here we are talking,  so that point is resolved. I&#39;m still mad about the trunk. How about you actually introduce yourself to me.&quot;<br />
Vect stopped. In all the blame, he hadn&#39;t actually told her his name. Annoyed by how they first met, he still decided to keep to tradition and bowed. &quot;My name is Vectivus Whitewood, third born child to Lord Corellion Whitewood and Lady Eldratha Whitewood, third lord of the southern province.&quot;<br />
&quot;Formal, but titles are of no concern to me. I would have been satisfied with just a name.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, uh. Ok, Vect then.&quot;<br />
&quot;I am pleased to meet you at last &#39;Vect&#39;,&quot; she bowed her head slightly. &quot;So do you have any questions?&quot;<br />
&quot;Uh, I hadn&#39;t really thought of anything to ask you. Oh ok, how old are you? I know dragons get bigger as they get older.&quot;<br />
Erress seemed to roll her eyes. &quot;I am 450 years old. That&#39;s still young for a dragon boy. Got a better question? Please say yes.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok how about what&#39;s it like to be a spirit?&quot;<br />
&quot;A good question actually,&quot; she was starting to sound like a schoolteacher. &quot;To be honest, until I had chosen you, very boring. I was alone with my thoughts for years. Just like when my vessel was put in the trunk.&quot;<br />
 Vect cringed at this. &quot;I&#39;m very sorry about that. But wait, what&#39;s the difference between being in the trunk and being in a pouch near me?&quot;<br />
&quot;When I am in close proximity to the one I choose as my partner I am able to see, smell, taste, touch, FEEL everything you feel. This makes you uncomfortable,&quot; she asks when seeing Vect&#39;s surprise.<br />
&quot;How close do you have to be to feel what I feel,&quot; he asked horrified.<br />
&quot;As close as we were last night. Oh don&#39;t give me that look, you liked it a little. Don&#39;t worry I won&#39;t tell,&quot; she said smiling.<br />
&quot;That is a little uncomfortable that someone is watching us.&quot;<br />
&quot;If you&#39;d been joined, I&#39;d always be with you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh yeah. Um, next question before I forget. Why did you choose me?&quot;<br />
Erress seemed to pause. &quot;When potential partners enter the cabin, we are able to look into their very essence and weigh them for who they are. You know what I saw?&quot;<br />
&quot;A handsome young elf?&quot;<br />
&quot;A boy with a good heart, and one that could use a bit of council every once in a while. By the way, ease off on Edran. He can&#39;t help he has a stick up his ass, he was born that way.&quot; The low rumbling returned. &#39;It is a dragon&#39;s laugh.&#39;<br />
&quot;Yes ma&#39;am.&quot; <br />
&quot;Next question.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why aren&#39;t you trying to push me into joining quicker? It would mean you will be guaranteed feeling things, rather than needing to be near me.&quot;<br />
&quot;I looked into you, you tried this druid path as a bit of rebellion. Don&#39;t look at me, yes you did. Anyway, I know just how frightened you are after seeing the others change. Especially Salazar Ortega. You are wondering how you will turn out. I have waited 50 years for you. A few more years are nothing if need be. Just....bring me along from now on. I don&#39;t want to be alone again.&quot;<br />
Vect was feeling horrible at this point. &quot;I swear on my honor that I will not leave you again.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Is there a way for us to talk besides through this meditation process?&quot;<br />
The dragon waved one claw and a small stone appeared floating in front of Vect. &quot;Grab this to make a mental link between us. It is a small step on the road to us joining at some point. But it will be permanent. In other words, I will be there with you for a lot more things. I will give my experience and advice when you need it. We can still meet in places like this through meditation if you wish.&quot;<br />
Vect grabbed the stone after he was sure Erress was finished speaking. &quot;I shoved you into a chest, this is just a small way to help make amends,&quot; he smiled.<br />
&quot;Thank you little one.&quot;<br />
The forest faded away, along with everything else to black. Vect slowly opened his eyes. Back in his room and the heart sitting across from him. <br />
(Hey you there?)<br />
(Always when you need me young one.)<br />
Vect put the heart in a large pouch and fastened it to the back of his belt.<br />
(Let&#39;s go back to the arena and see what they&#39;ve been up to.)</p>
