<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>That&#39;s a wrap on my plans for Peter and Tiny for now! Happy Halloween everyone!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Simon was happy to learn that Tiny was just as much as an avid texted as he was. The two had fun sending messages to each other throughout the week. Any time they had a particularly active chatting session, Simon swore he could feel Peter’s tail wag behind him. The feeling would be gone by the time he tried to look over his shoulder though.<br />
<br />
The two tried chatting on the phone at one point, and that <i>definitely</i> brought out their snouts. Tiny wouldn’t stop complaining that headsets weren’t designed for muzzles that were more than a few inches from their ear. Peter eventually had to remind him that speakerphone existed.<br />
<br />
Their second date indeed ended up being at “Howling Good Time”. The bar actually existed! It had a corny name, but the pub was surprisingly classy. Tiny got really flustered having his staff wait on them and call him “Boss” all night.<br />
<br />
Peter clopped home that evening and immediately shifted back into Simon after getting about a block away from the pub. Tiny on the other hand apparently stuck around. The bar was where he slept at after all. He woke up wagging the next morning, still fully decked out in a pelt of wolf fur.<br />
<br />
“I was able to stay like that for three days!” Tiny wagged excitedly the next time they met up, “I only changed back when I finally left the bar on a grocery run.”<br />
<br />
“Wow,” Peter rubbed his ear, “That’s… a lot?”<br />
<br />
The wolf beamed, “Seriously, it was a lot of fun! I should try walking you to your office some time.”<br />
<br />
Peter did have a Chronicle badge in his work bag whenever Tiny came by. It took a bit more prodding from the wolf, but eventually Peter gave it a shot. Sure enough, everyone at the newspaper seemed to know who Peter Pigsty was. He slipped into the role easily, and managed to spend an entire day working the “new” job. It honestly was a lot nicer than coding. The deadlines were a little tighter, but he liked getting to share personal stories with the world. Even if his profile picture on the newspaper website was a little chubby.<br />
<br />
It was the most surreal thing. As long as there was something from Peter or Tiny’s life around, their form would seem to anchor in spot for as long as it was there. It could be either of them, a workplace, or even just someone who only knew their alter egos.<br />
<br />
As the season started to change, Peter and Tiny headed downtown to the local park to watch the holiday decorations go up. Peter had managed to find a nice pig-sized sweater, but Tiny was clearly enjoying getting to show off his winter coat of fur.<br />
<br />
“Don’t be jealous,” Tiny leaned down and licked Peter’s ear, “Something on your mind piggy?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I umm…” Peter’s cheeks started to go red, “I was wondering if you’d like to start dating?”<br />
<br />
Tiny’s ears shot up and he began wagging a mile a minute, “Haven’t we been doing that?”<br />
<br />
“I mean dating-dating,” Peter oinked, “Like… going steady?”<br />
<br />
“Peter wants a boy-friend…!” Tiny grinned, giving Peter a big tongue lap across his cheek.<br />
<br />
“Oink! Hey!” He blushed, rubbing his cheek, “Come on, this is serious…! We don’t know what will happen to you know, us.”<br />
<br />
“You think going steady will keep us in a masquerade mindset all the time?” Tiny ruffled Peter’s hair.<br />
<br />
“Maybe?” Peter gulped, “I’ll need to tell HR I’m dating a restaurateur at least.”<br />
<br />
“Restaurateur? Now you’re just trying to butter up this humble barkeep,” Tiny grinned, “I… think I’d be alright with that. Telling HR and being stuck as a seven foot tall wolf man I mean.”<br />
<br />
“Oink! Isn’t going from a house to a spare room above your bar a bit if a downgrade?” Peter wagged shyly.<br />
<br />
“Arf! Hey, I like my bar!” Tiny said defensively, “Anyways, what about you? Trading a swanky apartment for a basement unit? Gaining two shirt sizes? Snorting when you eat?”<br />
<br />
“Hey!” Peter’s face for redder, “I- Yeah. It’d be worth it. All I want for Christmas is you.”<br />
<br />
Peter stood up on the tips of his hooves, giving the bottom of Tiny’s muzzle a gentle kiss. Then he started wobbling like crazy and the wolf had to catch him.<br />
<br />
“I can’t believe you used that line on me,” Tiny grinned, giving Peter a proper kiss, “Yes Peter Pigsty, I’ll go steady with you.”<br />
<br />
“Oink…! Yay!” Peter stood back up. The pig was clearly giddy with excitement, “Okay! I uh- I’m going to go clop over two blocks real quick to see if anything changes!”<br />
<br />
“Right now?” Tiny blinked.<br />
<br />
“No time like the present!” Peter started to clop off.<br />
<br />
Tiny laughed and quickly caught up with him, “It’ll take you the better part of an hour to waddle that far. I don’t mind a nice brisk jog. Stay put piggy.”<br />
<br />
The wolf shot Peter a playful wink before jogging off towards the park entrance. Peter stayed where he was, watching Tiny finally disappear off into the distance. The longer his tail stayed around, the more it started to wag. They were officially Peter Pigsty and Tiny Wolf. He wasn’t quite sure what the future would hold, but he knew they’d be doing it together-<br />
<br />
Hey, wait! Oink, he did know what was in their future! They had invites to another masquerade!<br />
<br />
“Oink, so do they rent a new mansion every time or…” Peter got out of Tiny’s delivery truck.<br />
<br />
“I think that’s the idea. Keep it a mystery where the next one’s going to happen,” Tiny nodded as they started to cross the parking lot.<br />
<br />
“That sounds like Mister E alright-“ Peter started. They were interrupted by a familiar voice.<br />
<br />
“Hey guys!” Clark ran over to them, “I wasn’t sure if I was going to see you two tonight!”<br />
<br />
“Are you kidding? We wouldn’t miss one of these parties,” Peter started to wag. His friend seemed to be dressed a bit more casually this time around. Peter leaned around Clark’s shoulder, watching a human bashfully follow a few paces behind him, “Who’s your plus one?”<br />
<br />
“Oh! This is Hugh,” Clark made room for him in their conversation. “I think you two might have met at that house party on Trinity street? Hugh, this is Peter and his boyfriend Tiny.”<br />
<br />
“Hi there! Right, the big guy,” Hugh waved a hand, “Uh, this is my first time.”<br />
<br />
“Second,” Peter waved back.<br />
<br />
“Sixth,” Tiny bowed his head.<br />
<br />
“You’re uh…” Hugh started to mumble.<br />
<br />
“Tiny,” he gave a broad wolf smile, “It’s ironic.”<br />
<br />
“Right! Wow. You two are going as a pig and a wolf? Those are some seriously nice masks!” Hugh’s eyes looked like they were going to bulge out of their sockets.<br />
<br />
Peter glanced up at Tiny. They both exchanged a small, “Huh”, before turning back to the newbie.<br />
<br />
“Oh, no, we kind of went all out last Halloween. We’re just going as ourselves tonight,” Peter added a realistic oink at the end just to mess with him. People could apparently see the real them again. The party must be in full swing.<br />
<br />
“Yourselves? Don’t you need a mask- Ah, gotcha,” Clark watched as the two reached into their back pockets and pulled out the fairly standard masquerade black felt eye coverings. “Very classic.”<br />
<br />
“Arf, so what are you two going as?” Tiny slid his mask on, “Not another cat I hope.”<br />
<br />
“Uh…” Clark pulled out his ‘Price Chesh’ mask, “Maybe? After last month, I’m thinking of adding this to Mister E’s collection. I’ll see what he’s got at his tables. Plus Hugh needs something anyways.”<br />
<br />
“Arf! Can we help you browse?” Tiny wagged and held open the door to the mansion.<br />
<br />
Peter snorted, “Yeah, just pick carefully. Those things can be surprisingly life changing.” He reached over and squeezed Tiny’s paw.<br />
<br />
Stepping inside the foyer, the four were once again presented with their enigmatic host.<br />
<br />
Mister E threw back his arms and gave an impressive bow. All the while his blank porcelain face mask betrayed no emotion. “Welcome welcome!” The host greeted them with his usual exuberance, “Tonight should be a New Year’s Eve to remember!”</p>
