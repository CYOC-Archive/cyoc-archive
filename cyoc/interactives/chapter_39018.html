<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle was quiet for a minute, as he thought out a few scenarios for how he might capture Penny. Many of them just kind of didn't work. He did have one rather wild idea, that as he thought more about it, he liked more and more...<br />
<br />
&quot;Jess, I want you to try and see if you can control your form a bit, kind of like that guy in Fantastic Four.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess kind of had an idea what he was talking about, and tried to concentrate on changing her form. She lengthened her fingers, her hand, and finally her entire arm.<br />
<br />
*This would come in handy if I ever wanted to play with myself... Not that I will really need to.*<br />
<br />
&quot;Very nice Jess, now see if you can hollow yourself out a bit, and see how thin you can make yourself...&quot;<br />
<br />
As she proceeded to do that, a thought came to her mind, and she realized what he wanted to try and do.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you wish to wear me? So you can sneak into the girls locker room and get at Penny?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Clever girl...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, I kind of think I would like to try that.&quot;<br />
<br />
He came in close and hugged her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now see if you can flow around me, covering me from all sides. Just make sure to leave me room to breathe, ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess tried to do that, and slowly felt herself wrapping all around Kyle. It felt marvelously erotic, as soon much of her body was in contact with part of his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now try and see if you can approximate your own form around me, as much as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle gasped as things immediately got much tighter, especially in the crotch, shoulders, and waist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Careful there, make yourself a little bigger if need be, so you don't have to squeeze me so hard there.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pressure relaxed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now see if you can thin the area over my eyes so I can see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle was surprised how well he could see right through her. He looked down, and saw her now familiar form. He moved around, and touched &quot;himself&quot; all over. He couldn't exactly feel everything, but what he could feel sure felt real enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is incredible...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I love feeling this way, being so close to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle was a bit surprised to hear that in his right ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool, you can still talk to me... Hmm, I still sound like myself... Jess, see if you can restrict my vocal cords just a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle felt it, and tried talking. Within a few minutes, he was able to get his voice closer to a girls voice. It wasn't perfectly Jess, but it would do for now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, now lets go get Penny. Remember, when I grab her mouth, you try and wrap around her arms and legs. Once she's restrained, I'll give her the curse, make sure she gets both, then she will be ours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I can do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle proceeded to walk out of the room, and around the school. It was an odd experience to &quot;appear&quot; totally naked, yet know he was fully clothed underneath it all. The looks many people gave him was nothing short of unnerving, like he was a prize cow on display...<br />
<br />
Fortunately, he was able to make it to the girls locker room without incident. He knew, thanks to Jess, that Penny tended to wait until the other girls had left to change, since she had put on a few more pounds than she would have liked, and was a bit embarrassed by it.<br />
<br />
Kyle waited in one of the furthest shower stalls, waiting for his chance. Meanwhile, he had taken to rubbing and pinching his borrowed nipples, he didn't feel this of course, but he knew Jess did. Jess, in return, moved her body along Kyle's quite erect cock, giving it a very unusual type of erotic massage.<br />
<br />
They were both having a lot of fun, and getting quite into things when they were interrupted by the cheerleaders. Postponing their fun was no easy task, but they managed.<br />
<br />
When the other cheerleaders left Penny alone to change, they left the room with some scathing remarks at Penny. Kyle truly felt sorry for the poor girl, and was actually glad Penny wouldn't likely face remarks like that after today.<br />
<br />
Penny was strong, until she felt safe that she was alone. She proceeded to crumple on one of the benches, and quietly sobbed. It really got to Kyle, and he decided that it was time...<br />
<br />
&quot;Penny, are you ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny squealed in fright.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who's that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle walked out to Penny.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's just me Penny...&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny calmed down immediately.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Jess, you scared me there. I don't want any of those bitches to catch me crying... I would never hear the end of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don't worry about them dear, they won't be a problem after today...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle walked behind Penny, turned around, and grabbed her mouth. Jess went into action, and was soon wrapped nice and tight around Penny, who struggled in vain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shh, shh, quiet down, and don't worry. I'm not going to hurt you. Oh, and Transform or Dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny's struggles increased a good bit when she heard those words. News had traveled fast today, and she knew that those words held a lot of real power... She soon realized it was hopeless, and gave up. Kyle released her after he was sure a minute had passed.<br />
<br />
&quot;First, I dare you to dare me to be the first person to kiss you when you have completed your transformation. Now as to your transformation...&quot;</p>
