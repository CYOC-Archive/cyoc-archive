<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jade found herself presently relaxing in Moon Lake&#39;s maternity ward. There was a fair amount of emotional pain that she felt at her husband&#39;s death and the fact that he&#39;d essentially provoked a fight with Moon Lake&#39;s police that set up his death, but she was smart enough to know that it wasn&#39;t like they&#39;d approached the situation without reason. She had her private wishes that Dymixious could have controlled his temper better and wished that the Moon Lake police didn&#39;t feel the need to take the specific measures they&#39;d taken the previous Sunday, but she couldn&#39;t change that things had happened that way and that her husband had paid for his mistakes.<br />
<br />
All she could really do now was move forward and be a good mother for Hope. And the hospital did a lot help in that regard. Nurses brought Hope to her on a routine schedule when it was time to feed her and in some policy that emphasized family bonding, but also included policies that were intended to give Jade some time to recover from giving birth and so on. In that, Jade had no complaints on the actions taken by Moon Lake&#39;s hospital. Jade also found that many of the nurses also couldn&#39;t help but comment to her on how cute Hope was, which Jade actually found rather amusing on how people seemed to love babies, were or not.<br />
<br />
By now, of course, Jade was looking forward to being dismissed from the Hospital and allowed to go &quot;home.&quot; In theory that was possible that she could return to the original home that Dymixious&#39;s father owned. It hadn&#39;t been a bad home, though after what had happened, a part of Jade had some concern that returning there would essentially put Hope in the same shadow that had lead to Dymixious&#39;s mistakes. That was something that Jade didn&#39;t really want, as while were secrecy was important, the things that the Moon Lake Police had mentioned had made a lot of sense. Dymixious and his father may have been needed for that sort of thing in the eighteen hundreds and earlier when normal technology wasn&#39;t soo good, but things had reached a point where that sort of thing couldn&#39;t easily be hidden behind rumors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your world shouldn&#39;t be violent,&quot; Jade said to infant Hope as she cradled her daughter in the bed as she thought over things to do and what she would do with regard to raising her daughter. Though she had the sense that returning to Dymixious&#39;s father&#39;s home would only leave Hope open to what had ultimately claimed Dymixious&#39;s life.<br />
<br />
&quot;No one&#39;s life should be violent,&quot; came an adult woman&#39;s voice making Jade looked up.<br />
<br />
She looked up to see a lone woman in more of a formal suit and with darker hair. She carried a werecat&#39;s scent, and Jade thought she could also pick up Frances Twist&#39;s scent on this woman as well, but Jade couldn&#39;t be absolutely sure. This left her a bit curious, but she would have to talk with this woman to answer those questions. Her stance looked fairly official, but Jade noted a soft and friendly face, despite the professional air about this woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot; Jade said slowly in agreement, &quot;can I...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Samantha Twist, Mrs. Drake,&quot; the woman said politely, &quot;my wife stood in to help with your delivery...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Jade answered, feeling thankful for the woman&#39;s help, &quot;you can thank her for her help?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;though that isn&#39;t quite why I&#39;m here at the present time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade slowly raised one eyebrow for the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really wasn&#39;t involved in the things Dymixious did,&quot; Jade found herself saying, almost as if she expected criticism on that issue.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure... but that also isn&#39;t why I&#39;m here,&quot; Samantha spoke, &quot;or at least not directly. While we had our wishes to protect Moon Lake and prevent there being BIGGER problems that had the potential to come out of the murder of Lionel Ulysses and the FBI&#39;s hunt for your husband... we didn&#39;t want the battle that happened either.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade slowly nodded, but didn&#39;t say anything for the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I am sorry you&#39;ve been put in the situation that you&#39;re in,&quot; Samantha said slowly, &quot;as making you a widow was never intended...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t need to go too deep into apologizing,&quot; Jade spoke, &quot;I do understand... really.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that is good,&quot; Samantha said slowly, &quot;though I would... on behalf of Moon Lake... like to present an offer for you, if you&#39;d care to hear it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade slowly nodded, though she was still highly curious as to what this could be. It was something there was so much to ponder that Jade wanted to know what would happen in a way that could only be explained by hearing it. In this, Jade could only nod as she held Hope to her as she looked up to the woman who had come into her room.<br />
<br />
&quot;We obviously can&#39;t demand you stay in Moon Lake,&quot; Samantha said slowly, &quot;and I will understand if you&#39;d prefer not to be where one you loved died... but we would offer you a more permanent home in Moon Lake...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me... live here...?&quot; Jade gasped as that was not something she expected in the slightest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moon Lake would be safer for you and your daughter than a life where you&#39;re worried about either being caught on tape or having law enforcement not be aware and accepting of what you are,&quot; Samantha spoke, &quot;which would mean that your daughter would get to live a far more normal life than she would outside Moon Lake...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of weres do live outside this town though,&quot; Jade commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if that&#39;s the life you want, we won&#39;t stop you,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;but Moon Lake can offer you far more in the way of safety... a place where you can live with some degree of personal safety and confidence. A place where violence wouldn&#39;t normally be an issue.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade found herself giving a small smile as she thought on the idea, though she still had a lot to think on.</p>
