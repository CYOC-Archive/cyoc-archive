<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John, Paul, Jack, and Bob were now fully grown men. All of them were muscular, but just to describe the scene...<br />
<br />
Bob is a blond, bearish man. He has big Viking looks. He has closely shaved hair and a huge blond-brown beard. He is highly furry with dense chest, back and arm hair. He was tall, at 6&#39;3&quot;. He looked 30 years old. All of his friends looked to be the same age. He was wearing a pith helmet and a khaki uniform. <br />
<br />
John was 6&#39;1&quot; and stood with impressive muscles, wearing a Hawaiian blue and white shirt. He also had an impressive mustache, keeping the rest of his face cleanly shaved. He had a strong jaw and looked like he could be a cop detective. <br />
<br />
Paul is the most muscular among them. He has a shining bald head and a permanent layer of stubble that looks like it&#39;s a few weeks old. His muscles and head shine as he heaves himself this way and that. He is dressed in a mechanic&#39;s slate blue colored uniform with a nametag, showing his name is curlicue letters. He was 5&#39;11&quot; and 260 pounds of lean muscle. <br />
<br />
Jack had a long face, a receding hairline, stubble, was ruggedly handsome but had no chest hair. He was wearing a dress shirt covered with a canvas vest, and he wore rainproof pants, paramilitary style. <br />
<br />
&quot;So am I the only one that thinks this is the coolest thing ever?&quot; Paul went through his mechanic&#39;s pockets. &quot;Hey, look! I&#39;ve got cigarettes! Dude!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re only 9! You shouldn&#39;t smoke!&quot; Bob discouraged. <br />
<br />
But Paul fished out a lighter. <br />
&quot;This is awesome!&quot; Paul lit it up and immediately took to it. &quot;Yeah, that feels about right. How do I look, boys?&quot; he said, with the cigarette dangling there. He took it and and blew smoke as if it was the most natural thing in the world for him to do. <br />
<br />
&quot;This..IS cool!&quot; John exclaimed. he was wearing shorts and a Hawaiian shirt and he had a cool cop stache. He fished out a pair of aviator glasses from his pocket and put them on. &quot;I feel...so tall! Come on, MEN! Let&#39;s find out how fun this game really is! We&#39;re adults now, which means we can smoke, drink beer, and totally kiss girls!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ewwww, gross!&quot; Bob made a face and stuck his tongue out. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have the feeling we&#39;re going to like girls a lot more now that we can, you know, be men with them and have S. E. X.&quot; Jack spelled out. &quot;I always thought I could make a better dad than my own dad. He&#39;s terrible at being a father. Maybe I could get the game to make him the kid permanently. I mean, just listen to me! I even sound like I have the perfect Dad Voice, dude! This is so cool! I&#39;ve got stubble! My clothes and my muscles...we have muscles! I wonder how strong I am!&quot; He flexed his bicep and was impressed by it...and a little turned on. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t like being big! I think I wanna go back to 4th grade and forget all about this!&quot; Bob with his enormous furry blond Viking frame grunted, turning his massive weight back and forth. He put on his pith helmet and adjusted his khaki uniform. His arms were about to burst out of the shirt. It was definitely too small for him and his shirt couldn&#39;t button all the way around his chest so he just left it open, the shirt giving way to his enormous musculature, draped over his pecs like curtains. <br />
<br />
Jack noticed he wore knives on his leg armor like some kind of freaking cool video game mercenary character! &quot;Wow, cool! This is awesome!&quot; Jack exclaimed. <br />
<br />
Bob was also fighting the urge to rub his now massive dick, which swung down his shorts and it almost reached the bottom of his cargo shorts, which came down to the knees. His dick was REALLY long! He peeked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God, my penis is REALLY LIKE HUGE AND STUFF!&quot; Bob was quickly changing his mind about this whole adult thing. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe I don&#39;t have hair but I love the way I sound. And I always wanted to smoke cigarettes! Dude, I look so cool! I feel like I could really go for getting my dick sucked. I&#39;m ready to be a man today!&quot; Paul was very excited. So was Jack.<br />
<br />
They walked a while along the trail until the got to a few jungle cabins that looked like they had very nice rooms, just waiting for them. There was a giant pool of water that, as they watched in amazement, swirled around and showed them their newest clue. <br />
<br />
If you look for your inner dad<br />
You will find it&#39;s not so bad<br />
If you find the treasure of being grown up<br />
Your friend will come back<br />
Through the magic cup<br />
<br />
Break the spell and set her free<br />
But then you raise your new family<br />
Your dad will shrink and you will proceed<br />
To become the fathers permanently<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously? So in order to save Ellen, we all have to be grownups forever?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;YES! THIS IS AWESOME!&quot; Jack yelled. He looked like a stereotypical TV dad with a handsome face and a five o&#39;clock shadow. He adjusted his tie &quot;I like the idea of quitting school and getting a job down at the ol&#39; office just like my dad. That sounds way better than being a kid!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;My body feels different,&quot; Bob said. &quot;It&#39;s weird. My penis is like enormous.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, none of us have even jacked off yet! Like my older brother. He does it all the time and he says it feels super good! I can&#39;t wait to try it!&quot; Paul finished his cigarette and stomped it out on the ground. &quot;And I&#39;m feeling way better. I was scrawny as hell and now I have...shit, dude. My biceps are 21 inches! My dad will understand. I bet he&#39;ll enjoy being MY son. Hey, I wonder if he&#39;ll even remember being my dad...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Who knows? This is all some really weird real magic and it&#39;s freaking me out,&quot; Bob told them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Stop freaking out and enjoy yourself! We are!&quot; John told his friend. &quot;Seriously, look at me. I&#39;m cool looking and I&#39;m a detective! A real one! Look, I even have a badge with my name on it!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and I know how to fix and fly helicopters. I just need to find one so I can fly us out of here,&quot; Paul told them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, we need to decide where to go. Did you guys see there are different paths? <br />
<br />
Around the cabins were three roads. <br />
<br />
A blue arrow pointed to Testosterone Peak<br />
A red arrow pointed to the Middle Aged Love Shack<br />
A yellow arrow pointed to Camp Best Friends Forever Yaoi <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that last word?&quot; Bob asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, who cares? Let&#39;s just decide!&quot; Jack announced. &quot;Eenie, meanie, miney, moe. Catch a tiger by the toe. If he hollers, let him go.&quot; </p>
<hr/><h3>
Which path did he land on?</h3>
