<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Transform&quot; Said Jen<br />
&quot;Great, just what I wanted.&quot; Said Kyle.<br />
&quot;For your transformation, you will become a sort of human insect queen. You will start by becoming pregnant with an insect girl, and you will immediately restart your pregnancy once you birth. These insect girls will gestate very quickly and come out as fully grown women with mature brains and knowledge of the world. They will forever be dependent on nectar from your breasts for sustenance, but that doesn&#39;t mean they will want to listen to you or have your best intrests at heart. No, the insect girls will just want you to keep producing offspring and nectar, and with a bit of effort and resources they will be able to reshape your body to be better at that, though different insect girls may also have other intrests. Oh, and no one is going to think anything is unusual about you or your off spring. See you, your majesty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer put down the phone. &quot;What a sick fantasy.&quot; <br />
<br />
As she got on the bus, Jennifer noticed a pressure building in her stomach. At first she thought she was imagining things, but it became clear that her stomach was bulging ever more outwards. Jennifer didn&#39;t want to have a panic attack in front of the entire bus, so she tried to pretend nothing was wrong. And, just like Kyle had said, no one seemed to notice. Her friend just kept on talking as if nothing had happened. However halfway through the bus ride she was startled to find out that her stomach was touching the seat in front of her. Her body was now way past pregnant, it was as if someone had glued a ball to her stomach. To make matters worse the creature inside her enormous womb was squirming in displeasure to the imminent lack of space.<br />
<br />
Jennifer&#39;s friend, Susan, had noticed her started expression.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Susan&#39;s eyes darted to her belly &quot;Oh! I get it. I don&#39;t think you should be sitting in a seat right now Jen.&quot;<br />
Jennifer sort of hesitantly tried to stand up, but her belly didn&#39;t leave any room for that either. Before she could think of anything else, she felt Susan&#39;s shoe on her shoulder and was unceremoniously pushed out on the floor. Her body was way too imbalanced for her to get up, and Jennifer resigned herself to just holding onto the seats to side of her so that she wouldn&#39;t slide into anything as the bus moved.<br />
<br />
As the bus stopped, Jennifer began to ask people to help her up, but to no avail. People simply ignored her and stepped over her. Now that the bus was empty, Jennifer started to wonder how her passenger was going to leave her body. Normal vaginas could barely fit a baby, and it didn&#39;t feel like hers had changed at all. Jen&#39;s question was soon answered by a jolt of intense pain caused as her stomach was ripped open. Jennifer screamed in pain as green slime spilled out of her womb and onto the floor of the bus while an insect girl crawled out of her ruined torso.<br />
<br />
Jennifer had expected something along the lines of a bee or a butterfly girl, but what had been in her stomach was the gross mixture of a girl and a crockroach. The girl had yellow eyes and hair that a pair of antennas stuck out of. There was a brown sort of shell on her back and while the girl had normal thighs, her lower legs and feet were entierly carapace they were pretty much a larger version of a pair of cockroach legs, and her hands and crotch area were covered in carapace as well. She opened her mouth, which was kept open at the sides by a pair of disgusting pincers, and began talking in a very low, smoky voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boy, it sure was cramped in there. Whoever made you sure did a poor job at the reproductive system.&quot;<br />
Jenifer wanted to give the creature a retort but the combination of pain and the absurdity of the situation left her speachless.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m gonna fix that real quick.&quot;<br />
The roach girl ripped Jennifer&#39;s skirt and panties in two and started to put shreds of skin back on Jen&#39;s body. She shivered in disgust at the roach girls&#39; hairy touch, but the pain slowly subsided. But before Jennifer could thank the her, the roach girl put one of her gross hair covered fingers on Jen&#39;s clit. Jennifer&#39;s gratitude dissapeared like snow before the sun.<br />
&quot;Stop that!&quot; She shouted.<br />
&quot;No can do.&quot; The roach girl responded, and started to massage slime off the floor into Jen&#39;s labia. Jen started kicking and screaming for the roach girl to stop, but she didn&#39;t budge, not even when Jennifer managed to land a few kicks on her head. Like a regular cockroach, this girl was made of strong stuff.<br />
<br />
When Jennifer stopped her futile struggles, it became clear that the roach girl was enlarging her vagina. The finger on her clit kept steadily moving upwards. While the gross half pest was a huge turn off for Jennifer, she didn&#39;t even like normal girls, she was still stimulating her pussy a lot. Jennifer let out a soft moan. &quot;Oh? Did this dirty ugly pest please her majesty?&quot; Mocked the roach girl as she finished up jennifer&#39;s new and improved pussy. Jennifer now had a pink slit that reached up to where her belly button used to be. The roach girl stuck out her hand and helped a very reluctant Jennifer up. Her hair and her back were soaked in slime and she wasn&#39;t wearing anything to cover her lower body, not that that would matter with this new huge vagina. She didn&#39;t want to go out in public like this, but she didn&#39;t like the prospect of staying in this slime covered bus either. What Jen didn&#39;t know, was that the roach girl was about to make the descision for her.</p>
