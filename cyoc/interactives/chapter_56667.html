<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa sat in class listening half heartily to the lecture.  All she could think of was Jen and her wonderful breasts.  Lisa wanted them.  She wanted them to be her own.  To have them on her own body.  Lisa could imagine exactly what she would wear to show off her huge boobs.  Lisa imagined how she would stand in the shower with the water bouncing off the tight rubber skin of her chest.  The spray hitting her in the face as she rubber shampoo into her hair.  She imagined sitting in class here with her huge breasts sitting on the desk.  The boys sitting about her would stare at her all through class.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you can see how the characters react to the main character in this chapter.  Lisa, what is one way that the other characters act differently?&quot; the teacher called from the front of the room.<br />
<br />
Lisa's attention must have strayed too long for Mr. Dickens to notice.  He always called on the ones that were sleeping in class.  Lisa cleared her throat before answering.  &quot;Now that the main character can't talk the others stop talking to him.  They start to treat him more like an object than a person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly,&quot; Mr. Dickens said before continuing.<br />
<br />
Lisa tried to return to her fantasy.  She tried to imagine what it would be like when she received her breasts.  What would it feel like to have them grow under her shirt?  She figured she would have to ask just right to get exactly what she wanted from Jen.  Then Jen would ask her the question and she would choose transform.  Wait, Jen could not talk, Lisa remembered.  How could a simple sex toy talk?  Didn't they just sit there and wait to be used?  Lisa wondered how she would get Jen to transfer the curse to herself.  There was no way while Jen could not say the words.<br />
<br />
But that made no sense to her.  The curse could only continue so long as the victims were able to pass the curse on.  The stories that she had heard about the curse suggested that the originator of the magic had wanted it to effect the town forever.  So, there must be a way for Jen to transfer the curse.<br />
<br />
&quot;The way the main character is treated is the main reason for him to try to reach out to others,&quot; Mr. Dickens droned.  &quot;He is willing to do anything to make others treat him like a human being.  Steven, how does he try to do this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, he can't talk so he had find a new way to communicate.  So he started to learn sign language,&quot; Steven intoned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly,&quot; Mr. Dickens said.<br />
<br />
Lisa really wished Mr. Dickens would just stop talking.  She just wanted to stay in her own fantasies.  She had to find some way of getting Jen to talk without talking.  But how?<br />
<br />
*******************<br />
<br />
Jen entered her Biology class squeaking.  Her rubbery legs rubbing loudly against each other.  Jen made her way to the front of the class to her usual seat.  The lab tables were close together and the room was clogged with students.  The going was tough and slow.<br />
<br />
Jen felt completely exposed with her inflated body jutting out for all to see.  Her body jiggled and wobbled as she tried to push past some boys.  Jen's breasts obscured her view directly in front of her feet.  Her ass brushed past one boy who took the opportunity to squeeze it.  Jen felt a thrill of desire.  She wanted him to take her and lay her out on the lab top and screw her.  But the boy just wanted to cop a feel and he went back to ignoring her quickly.<br />
<br />
Jen suddenly tripped over a school bag left in the aisle.  She had not seen it below her basketball sized breasts.  She fell forward landing on her bulbous breasts.  Then she bounced.  It was the most remarkable thing to Jen.  She had bounced.  The feeling was incredible.  Her body was so completely unlike it was this morning.  Everything she did was new and different.<br />
<br />
With difficulty she eventually made her seat.  Her large breasts forced her to lay them upon the table.  As a result she was completely unable to take out her books to take notes.  She found it difficult to sit in the hard chair with her round ass.  Jen tried to find a better position but she found any movement to be too noisy.  Her legs became splayed as she sat and she was unable to properly close them.  Jen decided to just sit still.<br />
<br />
Class began and Jen tried to remain still.  She had the distinct feeling that people were watching her.  But try as she might she could not catch anyone looking in her direction.  As best she could determine no one was paying any attention to her.  Just a silly sex doll that was propped in place at the front of class to be ignored.  Jen hated being ignored.  She wanted everyone to notice her.  She only knew one way; she would yell.<br />
<br />
Jen took a breath causing her boobs to roll on the table.  Then she exhaled.  What should have been a holler came out as a huff.  Something was wrong.  Jen raised a hand to her neck.  Her fingers felt rubber skin had made its way up to her chin.  She tried speak.  Tried to hum.  Tried to make any sort of noise.  But she was silent.  Her voice had been taken from her by the transformation.<br />
<br />
Unable to speak Jen feared that she would now be unable to even attempt to get help by passing the curse.  The only thing for her now was to wait until tomorrow when the transformation would be complete.  Then she would have a brief time to figure something out.  That is if someone would only use her soon.  Otherwise the way people ignored her she would be stuck waiting for someone to do something to her.  Jen let her head hang in despair.<br />
<br />
At that moment there was buzzing in her pocket.  Her phone was receiving a text message.  Jen pulled it out headless of trouble she may get in.  She read the message.  It was from Lisa:<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen, I have an idea.  Try texting the curse to me.  No orgasm until you hit send?  Worth a shot?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen thought.  The curse had been given to her over the phone.  Maybe you did not need to be in the physical contact to pass it.  Magic and technology; it was enough to make her head spin.</p>
