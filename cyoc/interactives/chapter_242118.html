<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Expecting to switch back anytime soon, you sat at the desk awaiting your vision to fade. However, that never came, as a new set of students filed in and the bell rang again. You were wondering to yourself if it was normal for this phenomenon to get exponentially longer after each attempt or if you had to execute an unknown trigger. Unfortunately, these questions weren&#39;t explained in the flyer, so you supposed you needed to get through this period as Evan.<br />
<br />
However, with the new knowledge from the flyer, you decided to experiment. After getting through a period by yourself, you wanted to see how Evan normally handled class. Just like before, you suppress your consciousness, and soon, you became a mere passenger with no motor control of Evan’s body. As Evan awakens, he was initially confused about his state, but a quick glance at his watch and the awaiting students told him what he needed to know. He stood up and gave instructions on the assignment, which was the same as last period. In the meantime, you notice his astute demeanor and elegant delivery of his tone, which led you to believe that he had a firm grasp of his job, despite being relatively new. After talking, he returned to his desk as you felt your eyes wandering around, as if looking for something. Then you heard Evan whisper under his breath, &quot;Wait, did I leave my bag and flash drive in the office? Why am I such a klutz today? Well, I guess I can access some files with the computer here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan began grading online writing assignments with the computer, while you were sitting back watching. As he was grading, you could hear Evan’s active thoughts running through your head, such as comments on the assignments, his perception of some students, and occasionally, his feelings about his job in general (which he has enjoyed so far, but wished to teach higher level classes to utilize his full knowledge). You savored being a passenger, as it felt relaxing to not mentally process things and just let someone else act while you tag along. Interestingly, Evan showed no awareness of you inside his mind, as he seemed to conduct his business as usual. As much as you want to try communicating with him, it was probably not a good time during class.<br />
<br />
As you stare at assignment after assignment, your consciousness slowly became drowsy. Just when you felt that you were going to fall asleep, you felt a hand lightly pressing into your groin. Despite your weaker senses, you could feel nature calling. Evan whispered, &quot;Ugh, why do I need to go now of all times? I thought I would always go right after lunch...&quot; You realized that you might have drank too much tea back then and were too busy afterwards to think about using the bathroom.<br />
<br />
In his mind, Evan was debating between holding it until the end of the period, which was 45 minutes away, or asking a fellow teacher to cover for him temporarily. He quickly decided to keep it in for the moment, sensing that the need was not very strong. But you could also tell that he was also doing it to uphold his reputation, as he most likely didn&#39;t want to bother other faculty members with such a mundane problem. You felt pity that teachers could not go as they please, unlike the students. Perhaps this was part of being an adult, although part of you was thinking that it should not be a big deal to just ask for help or even just get up and go. The students were working hard and certainly don&#39;t need extensive supervision like elementary schoolers, right?<br />
<br />
Fifteen minutes later, your body was still scrolling through essays on the computer screen, but you could feel slight twitches in your legs. Your legs were now crossed to keep the pressure at bay, but you felt that it was just delaying the inevitable. Just when you considered taking back control and going to the restroom yourself, you felt...pleasure? The act of crossing your legs seemed to be causing friction at your crotch, stimulating your member, which sent mild shockwaves through the body. You wonder if perhaps Evan has a strong libido and got hard easily. What a surprise it would be if Evan was intentionally crossing his legs to feel himself up, and you just happened to come along for the ride. Unfortunately, it also made you very conscious of your new cock, which you were eventually hoping to play with. You partially wished that you would return to your own body to bail from this predicament.</p>
