<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Karren was furious. This was not a maze. It was a straight path forward. She and Sara had been walking though this ‘maze’ for three minutes and there was no sign of it turning left or right. Sara was lagging her mom not wanting to be close enough to her in case she started to lash out at her. She also wanted to avoid a fight with her mom for her sister’s sake, regardless of how much she wanted to argue with her. <br />
Karren was starting to mutter out loud to herself about how she was going to give the attendants a piece of her mind and no one could stop her when what sounded like static started emitting from hidden speakers. Sara was starting to ready herself for her moms yelling when a fog drifted over her mind. Karren, who was going to start yelling about the broken sound system suddenly felt herself calmed down. Her mind started to fog over, but not as quickly as Sara’s did. <br />
Sara’s mind was quickly being overtaken by the fog. She was forgetting things left and right. Soon all she could remember was that she was Sara a seventeen-year-old girl. Movement in front of her took her attention, it was an ass, attached to a woman. The rhythmic movements of the hips were nice to watch, but Sara was starting to think that it was wrong. It was nice to look at, but it was doing nothing for her because she liked guys, and the woman in front of her was someone she knew, she could feel it. The fog in her brain seemed to roll over the feeling of familiarity and her preference for males and soon Sara could feel pleasure building in her stomach. <br />
The more Sara watched the more she felt turned on by the ass. The pleasure was also moving down further away from her stomach and more toward her pelvis. After a minute or two Sara shuddered and left out a sigh of pleasure as her vagina closed and dropped down forming a new pair of balls and grew into a new penis. Sara thought to herself… why was she referring to herself as a girl? She had a penis, guys had penises. She had a penis. She was obviously a guy. Her name was… Daren he was a seventeen-year-old guy, duh. A few more minutes of walking later and Daren’s had grown to its full length of seven inches. If one looked at Daren, as he was now calling himself, now, they would have an od sight in font of them. Daren still looked like a 5’10 girl but had a large penis bulge snaking down on of the legs of their Bermuda shorts.  <br />
With a grown Daren began to grow. As he got taller his shoulders got broader. His face lost any feminine features, becoming that of an attractive male. He also became ripped, nearly busting out of his shirt before it changed as well. When his growth spurt was finished Daren looked completely different. He had gained nearly a foot in height and was an imposing 6’8. He still wore Bermuda shorts but they were cut for a gentleman his size, though a person could still see he was enjoying the rear of there woman in front of him. His shirt had changed from a simple t-shirt to a tropical shirt typical of people on vacation. <br />
Daren’s changes continued. In a short time his skin tone changed to that of a black man and his hear became black and was cut short with a nice fade. New memories filled his head. He was twenty three and had graduated from college last year. He was an inspiring architect. He was dating… Before he could finish the thought the woman in front of him began to change.<br />
Karren was stuck in a thinking loop. When she got out of this ‘maze’ she was going to take her family to complain to the front desk. She would demand compensation. That’s right she and her husband… wait. Was she married? She had to be. She had children. Right? Finding cracks in her mental wall, the fog ate way at those memories. With her past family erased from her mind her body responded. Her wedding ring was gone and any evidence of her having children disappears. Her breasts shrank having not breast fed any baby and her body lost weight because she never gained any ‘mom’ weight. That’s right, she was a single lady in her late forties on to a resort in the Caribbean. But single women in their forties don’t go to Caribbean by themselves, it would be too sad. The number twenty-three entered her mind. That’s right, she was twenty-three! When that thought cemented itself in her head her body reacted. Her face regained the youth of a fresh college graduate. Her D cup breasts regained their firmness lost to time, and her overall fitness improved.<br />
Karren then remembered that she wasn’t here by herself, she was with her younger sister Kim. An image of a young Kim flashed in her mind before the short haired punk taker her place. Thinking of her sister reminded her that her father had given Kim and her the tickets as a congratulations for the both of them for graduating. Karren smiled at the thought of her caring father. Kim gained his height if nothing else. Were as she had gained her mother’s looks and height. Karren frowned at the memories of her mother. She was a small and bitter person who had broke her father heart. Karren then lost height so fast that she lost her pants and underpants, but somehow kept her sandals on. Her breasts also shrank down to a B cup leaving the shirt she had had on baggy enough to look like a dress. Karren remembered how her supposedly religious mother abandon said religion when it was covenant for her and the final straw came with her parents divorce. Karren was going to disappoint her mother on purpose. <br />
The more Karren thought of her mother, the more of her old ways were transferred into the new person. Karren’s religious fanaticism and it’s sexual purity was now something she had a strong distaste for, and memories of being well versed in matters of pleasure and depravity  the time she entered college was her new past. Her racism was soon her mother’s and memories of friends and boyfriends of all races entered her head. Conservative clothing went out the window as the now large on her shirt formed a tight yellow dress that only reached her upper thigh. Thoughts of exhibitionism filled her head, a butt plug with a gem on the end pushed it’s way into her pantyless ass.<br />
This continued until the only thing left of the old Karren was her name. She hated that name because it was her mother’s. It was a good thing her name was Caroline she thought. The person walking do the long hallway was no longer the prude Karren, but the fun and fun size Caroline. But there were still things she couldn’t put her finger on. <br />
Caroline came to slightly as a wall appeared in front of her. She came to a stop to try and collect her thoughts when a pair of massive arms wrapped around her shoulders and a deep voice said, “Why did you stop baby?” At once memories of Daren ‘resurfaced’. <br />
Daren was going to be a quick college fling, Caroline thought. But she soon found out that he satisfied her in may ways. Not only that, but he was studying to become an architect like her father. Daren and Kim also got along well. Even Shirin quickly became friends. He soon turned into Caroline’s longest relationship and he proposed soon after graduation. <br />
Caroline’s heart sped up a little when Daren pressed himself close to her for a tighter hug. She looked up at him and smiled. He smiled back and leaned down and gave her a kiss. “Come on,” he said letting her go,” I think I smell the ocean.” Daren led the way down the left hallway that was totally there the whole time. It was Caroline’s turn for a fun show as they walked. Details of the trip filtered into her mind as the two walked the last of the maze. Caroline was here with her younger sister, Kim, her best friend and sister’s girlfriend, Shirin, her fiancé, Daren, and Maria and Isabella, who starred off just as Kim’s friends back in college but had made fast friends with her as well. Karren and Jim and their children no longer existed. a bunch of college grads here for a good time remained. <br />
Daren and Caroline walked out into the sunny island weather only five minutes after they entered and less than a minute later were joined by Kim and Shirin and then the twins. After they all talked about the maze they all couldn’t really describe well, they discuss whether to stick together or meet back up later...</p>
