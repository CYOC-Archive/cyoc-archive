<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning after a long night of fun Glen stirred in bed hugging his wife and groaning a bit as his phone beeped. He ignored it and then it beeped again and rolled over to check it seeing a message from the city saying he had to get up and head into work for a meeting. He set down his phone attempting to roll over again. He got another notification and he ignore it. Then moments later he would feel an intense chill and he squirmed in bed jumping up. It didn&#39;t hurt him at all, but it for sure woke him up. He sighed and went it and took a shower and got dressed in some dress pants and a polo shirt before kissing his wife on the head and heading out while everyone else remained sleeping.<br />
<br />
Jordyn and Ashley were the next ones to wake up. Neither of them were morning people but they both woke up bright and early at exactly the moment their father closed the door heading out. Between their rooms was a bathroom that had a door to the hall as well as doors to both of their rooms. Jordyn woke up and moved right into the bathroom and started to wash her face. Ashley got up and sat in bed a moment before getting up and stepping out of his room into the hall forgetting about having access directly to a bathroom he shared with his sister in this new place. He looked around confused<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait.. what?&quot; he said to himself rubbing his eyes moving through the halls now confused as it seemed like everything except his room was unpacked and there was also lots of new things. Moving into the living room he gasped at the nice new big screen set up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah...&quot; he said confused and sort of excited at this upgrade.<br />
<br />
He went up to his parents room seeing the door was cracked open and he moved in seeing his mom in bed and was about to leave when she rolled over still sleeping. He froze up now seeing her face and naked breast on display. He stared at this woman turning red a mix of anxiety and confusion falling over him as he creeped on this hot woman and also considered to himself was his dad cheating? Was he in the wrong house? What was going on? He then got a knot in her stomach as the woman started to stir and rolled over again twisting the blanket between her legs as she did. her big ass mostly exposed to him in a tiny pair of lacey panties. There was a red mark on one of her cheeks implying some of the fun she had had last night. He gulped a bit as he started to get a bit excited checking out this sleeping beauty&#39;s butt.<br />
<br />
Just then a truck passed their house stopped parking across the street, and the sound of the tire pressure letting out as it stopped going &quot;chsssssssss&quot; making him jump and snap back to reality. He quickly moved out of his parents room and rush over to his bath room when he opened the door to see his sister standing there pulling up her pants in her panties before she started to yell at him he quickly closed the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh.. s-sorry... I uh... I&#39;ll just be in the car waiting to take you to get your ID.&quot; he said moving down stairs and heading to use the down stairs restroom before moving out to go wait in his garage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck...&quot; he said to himself at this crazy stressful morning sitting there in the same outfit he wore yesterday and slept in. He looked over and at the truck and it saw a P&R logo on the side and a handful of men hanging out in two vans behind the truck. It was like a moving crew waiting around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone else moving in to?&quot; he wondered.<br />
<br />
After sitting there for a bit and browsing his phone his sister finally came out and got in the car. She was wearing the same outfit as yesterday as well. Likely because all their stuff was still packed up. He felt a bit awkward having just watched in on her in her underwear, but much like Ashley she had choose to just not say anything and sit in awkward silence instead of making it more awkward. Ashley pulled out and headed to find the registration place while his sister started to mess with the radio. After a few wrong turns they did eventually find the place and pulled into the driveway. It seemed pretty empty since it was so early as the two of them walked over and inside to the door.<br />
<br />
Right as Ashley opened the door he collided with a short girl who seemed like she was upset and in a rush to leave. The two of them stumbled back and the girl looked at him with a surprised look like she knew him. Ashley had never seen this girl before as he said<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry....&quot; looking her over finding her outfit super weird. It was the same outfit as that hot pizza girl from the other day, even down to the &quot;Morgan&quot; name tag. The weird thing though was this girl was clearly not that hot 20something he met last night. She was much shorter and a good bit chubbier. She had on thick framed glasses and her hair was shorter. Still up in a pony tail but not long enough to hang down and instead looked like a messy tassel in the back of her had. Her skin was pale and pasty with dark brown hair and light brown eyes. She also clearly looked younger and was probably close in age to his sister. She was cute but nothing like the gorgeous woman he saw before who really looked flawless. Her outfit also looked a bit tighter and strained on her chunky body. She looked at him like she was scared to respond before simply rushing past him and getting on her delivery bike and riding off.<br />
<br />
Before Ashley could really react to this weird interaction his sister pushed past him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on.&quot; she said moving inside to meet the same woman Elizabeth who had met their parents the day before. The woman yawned drinking a coffee and looked over<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh finally... the Chase kids right?&quot; she asked starting to type on her computer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh yeah my sister needs and ID.&quot; Ashley started and the woman looked over to<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll need one as well.&quot; she corrected. Ashley Shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean... I&#39;ll be out of town soon with college anyway?&quot; he said and then the woman kind of dismissed it with a simple<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re already here just get it done.&quot; she then looked between the two.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay so who&#39;s first?&quot;</p>
