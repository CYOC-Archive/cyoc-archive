<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sophie wanted to check out the shops, so she convinced her brother to go, in the meantime, while they got a better plan. The stores weren&#39;t too far from their room so, they only took an elevator and a small walking before seeing in the first one. It was a pretty small antique store with several tribals things like necklaces, jars and masks.<br />
<br />
“I guess it’s worth a look.” Sophie told Alex before he looked up at the sign that read “Mama Zazafran&#39;s collection”. Alex told his sister it was an odd name for a store but they wandered in anyway.<br />
<br />
“Hello?” Sophie called out to see if someone was in there, but she got no answer. However, they still began browsing while someone shows up. After a few minutes, Alex was going to give up when he noticed he saw his sister just looking at weird necklaces, old furniture and clothes. He sighed and quickly turned around to leave, but he was so bored and anxious that he accidentally hit his head with an old jade necklace hanging from the ceiling, the hit was do so strong that it fell to ground and broke into a lot of tiny pieces.<br />
<br />
He was about to run away when a voice came from the back of the store yelling. “What was that? Is someone there? Please be very careful while you stayed in my shop! Consequences will occur if you do something unappropriate!” Alex was so scared right now that he forgot about Sophie and left.<br />
<br />
Sophie who didn&#39;t know where her brother had go, heard footsteps coming from the backroom and thought about leaving too or else she would be blamed. She ran for the door and was just about to leave when he heard an old woman’s voice cry out “Where are you going young lady? Was it you who broke my tribal war necklace?”<br />
<br />
Sophie turned around to see a small fragile old woman who could barely stand without her cane. “Uh, hi miss. I don’t know what you mean.” She said with a little bit awkward smile. “Young lady, you don’t know what you are dealing with. That necklace was used in ancient tribal rituals and it has a strong magic in it. As I said before there will be consequences for the one who broke it. So, I will repeat again, was it you who broke my necklace?”<br />
<br />
Sophie took her hand off the doorknob “N-no, it was my brother. But he was so scared that he ran away. Please, forgive him, it was an accident. My parents will pay for it.” She said afraid that the old lady could do something bad to her brother. “I understand, young lady. But he released the necklace&#39;s magic and I can&#39;t do anything about it.”<br />
<br />
“M-magic? What is going to happen to him? Will he turn into a frog or so?” Sophie asked, she sounded really worried for Alex. The old woman pointed her cane at Sophie&#39;s bag where she had her phone. “Call him, it&#39;s better that he&#39;s here when he began to change.”  Sophie nodded and called Alex to come back, she tried to explain to him what she heard from the old lady. At first he didn&#39;t believe it, but after a brief silence, he accepted to come back.<br />
<br />
Alex returned to the store with a weird green glowing around him. “Huh, hey lady! I&#39;m, I&#39;m sorry. I broke your necklace, but it was accidental. Sophie told me it&#39;s cursed and now I&#39;m glowing and I&#39;m scared. Please, I don&#39;t wanna turn into a frog or a rat or anything. Can you help me?” Alex said in a slight panic.<br />
<br />
“Like I told your sister, I can&#39;t do anything about it, the necklace’s magic is too powerful, even for me. But I can tell you what is going to happen to you. Don&#39;t worry, you won&#39;t turn into an animal but you&#39;ll definitely are going to turn into a different being.” The old woman guided Alex to the center of the room, Sophie followed them from the back.<br />
<br />
While Alex was walking, he started to levitate off the ground as the old woman and Sophie watched him astounded. “It seems it&#39;s already starting. Now, don&#39;t try to move or you could get hurt. Whatever it happens with your body, just stay calm.” The old woman said looking at Alex’s 5’5” body while his glow covered the whole room. “S-stay c-calm?!! I&#39;m floating in the air! What if I turn into a balloon and fly away?!!! Please, do something!!” Alex yelled at the old woman.<br />
<br />
“You won&#39;t become a balloon, in fact, you&#39;ll stay human. You know boy, I think this experience will help you to mature a little. It sure would teach you a thing or two about life. But, I guess I can do something to help you a bit, so it won&#39;t be too much for you.” The old woman stated as she began to pick up her cane again.<br />
<br />
“W-What do you mean? Please, I don’t want any maturing, lady! I’m fine just the way I am!” Alex replied. “Let me concentrate, or I won&#39;t be able to help you at all. Do you comprehend?” The old woman said with a severe look as she lifted up her cane higher.<br />
<br />
The old woman began to chant something in a odd language while she pointed her cane at Alex. A few seconds later, a white glow emanated from it and started to change the green glow into blue. However, Alex&#39;s body had already started to change as he started to feel tingly all over his body.<br />
<br />
“Ugh!” Alex was startled by the jolt of energy surging through his small body. He can feel himself stretching. His clothes began to shrink rapidly. His legs became more and more exposed as his shorts started to quickly become to small for his body. His tank top began to rip as his torso lengthened and arms became longer. His shoulders started to widen and his sandals felt very tight now.<br />
<br />
The blue glow stopped and it turned into green once again. Alex had almost a minute to process what just happened before he kept changing. As he inspected himself, he looked as though he had become a few years older “Wha-what just happened?! I I&#39;m bigger.” Alex shouted astounded at Sophie and the old woman. He now was 5’10 “It&#39;s... It&#39;s all I can do... I&#39;ve used all my magic power” The old woman said while she&#39;s panting. She took a deep breath before she kept talking. “I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry, young lad. Without my assistance, the magic on the necklace is going to be stronger on you until it fades.” The old woman said as she dropped her cane and took a seat in an old chair.<br />
<br />
Alex began to levitate again, but this time the gleen glow surrounding him seemed more intense on his teenager body. “Uuuugh!” He was surprised at the heat he was feeling all over his body and the intensity of the tingling the second time. His legs lengthened even faster this time, this time almost ripping his shorts clean off him. His shorts could barely cover half of his thighs and his sandals began to burst open rapidly.<br />
<br />
His size 7 sandals were so tight now, they could not hold his rapidly growing feet inside any longer. “Aaah!!” Alex felt pain as his feet bursted out of his small sandals. His toes were completely out of the sole relieving him a little but his feet were still growing, suddenly his sandals bursted completely right open revealing large size 15 feet.<br />
<br />
“Ooooooh!” Alex let out a moan of relief now that his new large feet were free but that wasn’t the end. The tingling intensified up his legs as his thighs began to widen, ripping what was left of his shorts. His muscular legs were now exposed. The only thing that was holding was a very tight underwear that was already showing signs of strain.<br />
<br />
The tingling rose to his torso. His tank top didn’t stand a chance as his shoulders and back began to broaden and widen quickly followed by his pecs starting to pop out. Alex’s tank top was now shredded on the floor. His arms followed, each inflated to form a thick bicep and muscular forearm.<br />
<br />
“Please! Stop it!” Sophie pleaded to the old lady but she was too tired to do anything. Sophie only could watch her brother turning into a grownup while she heared him moaning and groaning with his now deep and baritone voice. Alex could feel his face adjusting to that of a man’s. Hair began to grow on his chin as his face aged from a young teenager to that of a man in his mid thirties.<br />
<br />
The tingling had stopped. The now 6’8 Alex was sweaty, confused and scared. He was in a daze. He looked at the old woman and his sister who was open mouthed staring at him. “It&#39;s over?” Alex said out of breathe, Sophie thought Alex now sounded very similar to their dad. The old woman took his cane from the floor and said “I think you’re not done yet.”<br />
<br />
With her cane in hand, she pointed in at Alex’s tight underwear “Young lady, I think you shouldn&#39;t see this part” She used what was left of her magic to blind Sophie temporary. Then, a tingling sensation in Alex&#39;s body turned into an intense vibration causing his eyes to roll back in pleasure. “UUUUUUH!” He moaned as his underwear bursted right open revealing a hardening and lengthening dick.<br />
<br />
The old woman watched as Alex’s dick stretched from 2in to 9in in a matter of seconds. This was followed by Alex’s balls suddenly dropping and inflating. He couldn’t help but moan and groan from the intense and new pleasure he was feeling. At the same time, the sparse amount of body hair on him started to increase at an alarming rate, covering his chest, legs, arms, armpits and, of course, his crotch with a thick layer of curly hairs.<br />
<br />
Now Alex’s transformation was complete. The vibrating and glowing had stopped. He stopped levitating and was able to catch his breathe and stand up feeling the aftermath of his now grown man body. He was sore all over but his feet felt the worse. He rubbed his aching size 15’s and confusingly looked at the old woman to know what was going to happen next.<br />
<br />
“I think now it&#39;s finally over.” The old woman said as she stand up and look at Alex closely. “I thought you&#39;re going to help me!! Look at me!! I&#39;m as old as my dad!!” Alex yelled as he raised his arms and show off his new armpit hair.<br />
<br />
“And you could be even older if I didn&#39;t help you!!” The old woman replied while she took a loincloth and gave it to Alex. “Cover yourself. Your sister is going to see you in a minute.” He still seemed pretty confused but he obeyed. “I don&#39;t now how much time you&#39;re going to be stuck like that but I could help to find a solution if you stay here and help me with my shop.” The old woman said with a smile on her face.<br />
<br />
Alex was starting to think about the old woman&#39;s proposal when he noticed Sophie&#39;s blindness was vanishing. He hurried to wear the loincloth, it wasn&#39;t very comfortable but it was better than nothing. When he finished, he noticed his newly dropped balls were coming out from the sides. “Don’t you have something better to wear?”<br />
<br />
“Only if you accept to work here.” The old woman said with a growing smile on her face. “So, what do you decide?”</p>
