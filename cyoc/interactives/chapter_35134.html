<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Connor completely and utterly gave in to his carnal desires that night. He had barely asked about what wolf ladies were available and how much (not really thinking how American money wasn't really of any value here)  before at least half a dozen human she wolves have leaped onto him, and gently but firmed lead him to one of the room. <br />
<br />
He didn't remember where he had lost his shirt, his pants, undies, shoes or socks, or where he had lost his suit cases. All those questions didn't matter in the least. He at last had the embodiment to express his lust that he had been seeking ever since puberty had hit. He explored each and every one of them, repeatedly. They explored every part of him, and he explored every part of them. <br />
<br />
It slowly began to dawn on him that they had never asked for his name, and that he had never asked for their names, but again his lust needed sating and he dove into it again without a second thought. It ever so slowly then began to creep into his brain that he wasn't getting as tired as he should have been, nor were his various partners. <br />
<br />
In one of their sparse and few momentary breathers, he had the thought to look at himself. He was celloid. No matter what way he looked at his hands or any part of himself, he saw the thin black outline, and the texture less contrast light gray and earth brown colors that now totally covered his body. <br />
<br />
He felt himself over, he felt fur, but at the same time, infinitely smoother than the fur of any animal he had ever felt. Looking around at the brothel he saw the backgrounds of everything was now a watercolor painting. He finally realized that the she wolves were all celloid in appearance like him. He could change the angles he was looking at them with just a turn of his head, but they looked as 2-D as he did now. <br />
<br />
It hit Conner like a lightning bolt that he was no longer a human with wolfish features... he was a complete and total cartoon wolf. He saw it was dark gray overcast day, but still day all the same. Logically he should be able to become human then right? <br />
<br />
He remembered what Mr. Plot Device had said and checked, yes, he was still rated M for Mature. The she wolves apparently decided now was a good time to resume their love making as they began to pull on the tail Conner only now realized he had dragging him back into them. The shock of having missed out on this transformation got the new toon's wits enough about him that he looked at the she wolves. And finally saw the emptiness in their eyes. Their only expressions were coy playful or all out lust, nothing in between or outside. <br />
<br />
That was right... ninety nine percent of yiff, yaoi, and hetai manga and anime were either completely devoid of plot, or only had it in rice paper thin portions, it was only structure that allowed for the act of sex to have context for the viewer or reader. There was no need for the characters to have in-depth personalities, or names for that matter, or complex back stories... <br />
<br />
This frightening truth made the new toon wolf yelp in fright and he leaped back from the pack of forever lustful she-wolves. And even then, he felt his libido telling him to throw caution to the win and simply accept things the way they were. But the fear of losing his identity was enough for him to hold himself in check. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aw... done tell me you're done already.&quot; <br />
<br />
Connor realized that was the voice of the Madam who had momentarily greeted him when he had stepped into the brothel. He saw she was a toon wolf now too, more muscular than some men, with purple and violet fur, and at least a head taller than him! In direct contrast to the she wolves about him who were all shorter than him. She was as naked as all of them. And just as biologically correct. <br />
<br />
&quot;I-I think I want to go now.&quot; Connor croaked out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah? So soon? You've only been here a week.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;A week?!&quot; He had been living out his fantasy non-stop day and night without food or water or sleep for a week?!<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. From the way you smelled and acted, I figured it would take you a whole month to even begin to feel bore, and another month to even begin to think about things... not that it would matter at that point of course.&quot; <br />
<br />
The toon wolf's entire body shivered in fear. &quot;Well, I think I'll just be taking my clothes and stuff and be going now...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Clothes?&quot; The muscular Madam she wolf said, somehow, all the smaller she wolves were holding back in her presence. &quot;Go?&quot; She cackled. &quot;Your clothes dissolved into nothing after your transformation was complete. And go where? You're a part of the sketch now, there's no where for you to go?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sketch?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;By now, some sleezy anime studio or manga publisher have already drawn the first batch of panels of what you've done here... you're not human anymore... phyically at least... you're an idea, the mental avatar of a lonely perverted reader or viewer out to fulfill his fantasies. And your existence in the human world vanished just a little bit more with each night you spent here. Don't worry, you'll stay male... until someone ELSE with a were wolf fetish comes to the brothel, there's only need for one male in a hetai anime after all, unless it's yaoi of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
Conner gulped. The Madam waltzed up to him, and looked down at him every part of her looking to be muscle and fur. &quot;Now Wolfish, sit back, go back to the harem, let go of everything else, it's all you are now. Complete your transformation with your mind and become your lust and only your lust.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Connor!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Conner no longer exists! Never did exist! Doesn't exist! Never will exist! You are Wolfish, only Wolfish, was only Wolfish! Shall only be Wolfish!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; Dismay and horror struck Connor as he realized how shallow he had allowed his dream of making love to a real were wolf had become, and the she wolves he had imagined, had become just objects to fill out that lust. <br />
<br />
The wolf Madam let a claw trace gently from his crotch to his throat and spoke in a loving voice, &quot;You wouldn't have come here if this wasn't already you, if this wasn't already who you are, we're just stripping away all the surplus, now stop keeping my she-wolves waiting... you wouldn't want the hetai animators in the human world to suddenly get uninspired now would you?&quot; <br />
<br />
Connor looked at herself, feeling like he was watching a hetai anime's POV scene of a male were wolf, seeing only a celloid drawing where his body should be. He had done this to himself, he had no one to blame but himself. Wasn't this what he had wanted all along? However, Connor realized there were many details about himself that felt like they were smeared, washed away... things he could no longer remember clearly. Maybe this was just the price he was expected to pay?<br />
<br />
The wold Madam leaned close, grinning with several painted white teeth. A second later, celloid claws slashed across her celloid chest, leaving a trail of red painted blood in her wake, hitting sensitive spots. <br />
<br />
&quot;YOU! S&amp;M it is then!&quot; She snarled.<br />
<br />
Connor ran like there was no tomorrow SMASHING right through the japanese style building's walls, coming to the outside. The outside smelling of pumpkins and leaves rather than the inside's wolf musk. Running purely on instinct he climbed up one of the black twisted shapes, his painted heart pounding in his painted chest. <br />
<br />
Finally, he was clinging to the pointed spire of a building bell tower for dear life. He couldn't smell the Madam, and breathed easier. Was she still looking for him? Or had she turned one of those empty eyed she wolves back into a male to fulfill the needed role?<br />
<br />
And where could he go now? Did he really exist now as only an idea in a porn writer's mind now in the real world? Was he sentenced to exist now in this world until he faded away when people moved onto the next fetish fad? <br />
<br />
Connor looked around at the various districts of the Halloween town, so many done in so many different art and animation styles. That was when he began to think about what maybe he really wanted. <br />
<br />
<br />
'I want to make love with a she were wolf but.... I want it to be meaningful...'</p>
