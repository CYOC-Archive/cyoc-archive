<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex marched into the throne room, a vast rectangular space, with pillars lining either side, letting the morning light enter the room, the colloms were decorated with various scenes and gods, each telling its own story or moment in history, the ceiling was vast, with a golden shake in the center, its tail tip above the door, and its hooded head acting as the throne, various plant life tried to grow into the room, roots and vines wrapped around the pillars, and leaves and branches seeping along the walls.<br />
<br />
Then Alex saw her, sitting in the serpents mouth was Amunet, she was still as beautiful as the first time Alex had saw her, her arms crossed over her breasts, with her crook and flail in her hands, her eyes glaring down at Alex, to her left sat a dozen or so hooded figures, their faces obscured from view, their white cloaks covering their entire body, and to her right were three women, black tattoos along their arms and along their neck and chins, their hair black and cut to their sholders, their bodies bare to reveal their ample breasts and clean nethers, however they did ware a black sash on their hips, the fabric draped behind them as a type of cloak.<br />
<br />
Both parties flanked their pharaoh as Alex aproched, however Amunet held out her hands to them, stopping them dead in their tracks as she then rose from her seat of power &quot;you truly are the strangest man I have ever met, no fear, only courage, the nerve to stand against pharaoh, and the strength to overpower two of my strongest personal guard&quot; she said, sounding truly impressed, however her face remained cold as stone &quot;however, whatever you are cannot be allowed to live, my decision has been made, you shall face the judgment of the gods, should they deem you worthy, you shall live at my side, but should you fail, your corpse will feed my pets&quot; she said with a smile, raising her flail into the air before pointing it at Alex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brace yourself son of man, this is a test of combat, you have my strength but not my skill, not yo mention you are just as weak to getting sliced open as you were before&quot; came the voice of Tawarete, Alex glancing over to see her sat up against a pillar, her gace sad &quot;I am forbidden to interview in a trial of the gods, you must fight this alone&quot; she said, Alex only gave a nod as he looked around the room.<br />
<br />
All was silent, only the sound if the wind passing between the pillars could be heard, when suddenly a flash of white caught his eye, but as he turned it was gone, then there was a flash of pain accross his sholder, looking to see a gaping bleeding gash in his arm, it was then he saw what had caused the wound.<br />
<br />
Before Alex stood a giant white crane, it&#39;s long slender legs were black as night, standing at least twelve feet at the leg alone, its wings were wide, each decorated with an eye as it opened its wings, then their was its head as it leaned in to look at Alex, its eye was golden Amber, easily as big as a saucer, with red feathers under its eye, a large red crest atop it&#39;s head and a blood stained black beak that snapped at Alex.<br />
<br />
A sudden anger flared in Alex as he took a swing at the bird, causing it to rear back and lunge again, Alex rolled aside, reaching for the knife around his neck,yet the chain would not give, and when he tried to lift it over his head, it was like trying to lift a mountain, it simply would not move, it was then that a shadow loomed over his head, a giant clawed foot was plummeting towards his head, its claws soon to be stained red with his blood, yet he had no fear, then he felt the impact, but to his surprise he was still alive, his face felt...covered?.<br />
<br />
Alex in his moment of accepting death had given way for his Avatar capabilities to come to light, his body was now wrapped in linin, from head to toe, a helmet with tusks on each cheek sat upon his head, a scarab beetle on his chest, grafted from silver, woven into the wrappings, and in his hand was the dagger, however its blade had grown and curved into a khopesh, its blade stained with blood, and the birds foot laying at his feet.<br />
<br />
Looking up at the beast it hopped away from him, uts feathers rustled and its wings outstretched in a threatening display, blood pooling at its foot from its severed limb, the room was silent, for whatever reason the act of serving this birds limb had stunned the room into silence, looking over at Tawarete she seemed to show only pride, now he had a chance, now he could win.<br />
<br />
Alex lept into the air, only to crash into the ceiling, and fall face first onto the floor, surprisingly only stunning him for a moment, he then felt the birds beak around his foot, only for him to be flung through the air, being thrown against the steps of Amunets throne.<br />
<br />
Again he rose to his feet, sword in hand as he charged the bird, it screeched at him as it too charged, hooping and flapping chaoticly, only to come to a halt as Alex wrapped his arm around its beak, pinning it to the ground, is binding around his arms came to life, slithering like snakes accross the birds head, wrapping its mouth shut and blinding its view, so the bird simply stopped its struggles, laying completely still.<br />
<br />
When Alex turned to face Amunet, his bindings and armour had vanished in a blink, as if they were never there, his gaping wound still there and bleeding, and when he turned to face look at the bird, that too was gone, the only proof of their battle being the blood and feathers thes were smeared accross the floor and walls.<br />
<br />
Whispering soon came into being as the various people around the pharaoh began to talk, some to eachother, other talking to Amunet, her gaze never leaving Alex, her gaze still cold, yet softer now, like there was something new in her eyes now, curiosity?, attachment? Alex was unsure.<br />
<br />
Amulet the silenced the people around her and Rose from the shakes head, walking towards Alex, he stood before her and decided he had tempted his life enough for the day, taking a knee to show respect, but upon looking up he saw her extending a hand for him, with a smile on her lips and a slight blush in her cheeks &quot;rise, the floor is no place for my right hand....&quot;</p>
