<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been three months since meeting Karen, during that time Todd had conducted numerous experiments on the youthful tiny prostitute.<br />
<br />
Having the woman grow after orgasm had given Todd a plethora of data. What it took to get an experienced sex worker off. The ratio of growth to level of orgasm. Even Karen&#39;s experience at a reduced stature. The sexual and miniaturized data gave Todd plenty of information to refine his device. It had also given Todd information on the sad life of Karen.<br />
<br />
Karen&#39;s life was almost stereotypical of what he believed a prostitute would experience. A broken home with an abusive father and alcoholic mother, Karen had essentially been forced to raise herself from a young age. When her father finally ended up doing a lengthy prison sentence, an uncle had come into the picture. This turned out to be even worse, the uncle was a deviant who began sexually abusing Karen as soon as puberty started.<br />
<br />
Todd had learned the abuse lasted for a couple of years before Karen ran away from home at 14. From there she became a working girl, moving from pimp to pimp, becoming addicted to drugs Todd had never even heard of. She spent her 20s and 30s in and out of jail, usually doing small bids before going back to work. Todd found Karen&#39;s story heartbreaking, she had never had a chance. <br />
<br />
This led to a dilemma for Todd, Karen wasn&#39;t a bad person. Having cured the woman of her addictions she was pleasant enough, trusting him enough to open up about her past. Todd was understanding, allowing the woman to gush about all of the ugly things she had seen. She was thankful, yet she wasn&#39;t sure what to do next.<br />
<br />
Karen really had no formal education past the 9th grade. Without so much as a high school education Karen&#39;s job prospects were slim, especially since she had a voracious sexual appetite. Sex is what Karen knew best and Todd feared that once Karen and he parted ways she would end up right back where she started. This is what got Todd to do some research.<br />
<br />
It was amazing what you could find on the internet. After a bit of searching, Todd had finally found what he was looking for, black market adoptions.<br />
<br />
Finding someone for adoption and choosing someone were two completely different subject matters. It took some digging but Todd finally found what he was looking for. <br />
<br />
Rich people always wanted what they couldn&#39;t have, this was especially true when it came to children. For these couples, money was no object and they had little patience for making their way through the system. Instead they turned to the shadier areas of the internet, useing brokers as they searched for the perfect child to add to their family. Todd, after a month of searching, found a few of these people yet he still needed to make a decision. He wanted to set up a meeting with the potential parents to gauge how they would be as parents. Todd eventually settled on Wesley and Sarah Masters. <br />
<br />
The Masters were an interesting couple. Wesley was a successful corporate lawyer while Sarah ran a series of businesses in their hometown. The couple had been trying to have children after establishing a comfortable lifestyle, only to be met with the tragedy of several miscarriages. Adoption was considered, however, the couple found themselves on a waiting list. It was painful for the couple, they were approaching 40 and wanted a child while they were still young enough to keep up. This is what led them to Todd.<br />
<br />
Todds introduction to the Masters was interesting, thr couple nervous, knowing they were breaking the law. They feared going to jail, yet were willing to chance it if it meant having the child they had always wanted. Todd was a godsend, he would get them that child, at a price of $250,000.<br />
<br />
Todd had done his research, knowing black market children often went for half a million. The Masters though were too perfect, Todd doing his research on the couple to find they had no red flags in their backgrounds. Considering they were scared of doing this, Todd believed they would be perfect parents. Still, he wanted to get paid. $250,000 could go along away for a college kid. Reaching an agreement, Todd told them he would have their infant daughter for them by the end of the day.<br />
<br />
Todd now found himself gazing down at the sleeping Karen. As usual the woman was in the nude, her legs hanging off the bed. Todd wasn&#39;t looking for a steady girlfriend, focusing solely on his work. While she was fun, she did cramp his style. It wasn&#39;t fair to either of them, this was the best course action for both of them. Todd smirked gazing at her ample breasts and beautiful face. He wanted to take a mental picture of the beauty it would be a long time before she looked like this again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm hey lover,&quot; Karen yawned. &quot;Whatcha doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd was quiet, setting the device before activating. A beam of light washing over the leggy blonde. &quot;One last experiment,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Karen stretched, running her hands through her shoulder length hair before giving Todd  a sultry look. &quot;Oh sounds like fun,&quot; she cooed. &quot;Whats going to happen this time?&quot; Todd said nothing, simply gesturing towards the mirror in his room. Karen stood, Todd admiring her legs and ass as she moved, he was going to miss that.<br />
<br />
Karen now strode towards the mirror, she loved admiring her nude, youthful form. Stretching she now took a look at herself before gasping in shock. &quot;What the hell I&#39;m getting younger!&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd nodded, gazing at the 18 year old beauty in front of him. Karen&#39;s body was thinning, losing its curve. The girls breasts rising, losing mass as her face began to round. Todd had to believe that in time Karen would be the Prom Queen.<br />
<br />
Karen felt a bit if embarrassment as she gazed at her nude teenage body. Quickly grabbing a blanket, she now wrapped herself in it before glaring at Todd. &quot;What gives how old am I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Id say 16,&quot; Todd stated, Karen&#39;s jaw dropping. The teen looking down at her body beneath the blanket watching as the gifts if puberty eroded. The girls face rounding, her eyes wide in shock and anger. &quot;How come I&#39;m getting younger,&quot; she whined, clearing her throat as her voice shifted into a more youthful tone. &quot;I told you what a shitty childhood I had. Why would you have me relive it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have a seat Karen we need to talk.&quot; Karen now slowly approached, taking a seat on the bed next to Todd. As she dropped to 15, Todd now noticed the girl shrinking an inch or so. Karen&#39;s face was now entering her early teens, her face no longer sultry but cute with her shoulder length blonde hair and wide hazel eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Todd I&#39;m scared,&quot; she said softly. &quot;I&#39;m getting younger and something else is happening. My brain feels all....fuzzy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know Karen,&quot; he said softly. Karen glanced at Todd nervously, the gi now becoming collision as she went down to 14 then 13. Karen&#39;s breasts were rapidly vanishing beneath the blanket, her face rounding and becoming childish. Glancing down at her feet, Karen&#39;s eyes went wide as she saw them grow smaller, her legs thinner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Karen,&quot; Todd said softly. &quot;What I&#39;m doing, I&#39;m doing because I care. You never had a fair shake at life. You got dealt a raw deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whats that supposed tomean,&quot; a now 12 year old Karen exclaimed. Todd gazed at the angry preteen. Karen had lost almost a foot in height, going from 5&#39;11&quot; to 5&#39;1&quot;. The girls breasts little more than softball sized with barely flared curves. The blanket she had covered herself with gradually eating the girl up. As she crossed the threshold between 11 and 12 she gasped in pain. &quot;Owww my tummy hurts!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats your Hyman reforming,&quot; Todd stated. &quot;You&#39;re a Virginia again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen gaped, her mind feeling foggier with the loss of more years. Approaching 10 years of age, she could see she was getting smaller, her feet looked tiny as her heel slowly began to rise of the floor. This scared Karen as she now tried to press it back onto the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;A Virgin how,&quot; she asked, her voice thin and weak she became 9. &quot;Whats happening? Why am I getting so little?&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd now tried to comfort the girl as she continued to creep backwards in age. Puberty had long abandoned the child, leaving her an adorable blonde child of 8. Todd glanced down at her feet, amazed at how small they were as they now shrank upwards. Karen noticed as well, her eyes wide as she saw them sway slightly as she continued to regress.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hit the reset button Karen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Reset button,&quot; a now 7 year old Karen asked. &quot;What does that do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In essence Karen I&#39;m giving you a second chance at life,&quot; he said. &quot;A chance to grow up again with people you actually care about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Karen whined as she became 6. &quot;No I don&#39;t wanna grow up again. I don&#39;t wanna be a baby. Pwease! Todd. Don make me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen was close to tears as she became an adorable 5 year old once more. Todd tried to soothw the girl, listening to her sniffle as she exited kindergarten and reentered preschool once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know its scary Karen,&quot; he said softly. &quot;But I need you to trust me okay? I found two very nice, very rich people who can&#39;t wait to take care of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I scared,&quot; Karen lisped, the 3 year olds lip quivering. &quot;Todd what if they mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd gave the girl a warm look as he brushed her cheek, thw physical and mental regression were beginning to even out as she crept closer to infancy. Already he could see the little girls eyes becoming more vacant. The years of pain and torment vanishing like smoke as her mind and body restarted from scratch. <br />
<br />
&quot;They won&#39;t be,&quot; Todd stated, holding the girl in a tight hug. Karen&#39;s thumb now began to drift towards her mouth. Passing her third birthday in the opposite direction, she looked up with a face that was leaving childhood and reentering toddlerhood. &quot;Kay,&quot; she lisped.<br />
<br />
Todd stroked her hair, Karen trying to say something else but finding it only to be gibberish. She was forgetting how to talk, forgetting all of the horrible things that had happened in her life. Karen was getting sleepy, the girl only 18 months old at this time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dont worry Uncle Todd will keep tabs on you promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen smiled, Todd noticing her teeth beginning to recede into her gums as she drifted off to sleep. Todd now watched the one year old girl descend backwards into months. It amazed Todd how small she was, growing smaller with each passing second. Karen was shrinking, passing developmental milestones in reverse. Talking, walking, crawling, all was forgotten. The girl passed 6 months, her body becoming even smaller, losing baby fat. Down to three months, she couldn&#39;t support her head. Todd ran a hand through the tiny infants blonde hair, amazed at how whispy and thin it was.<br />
<br />
The regression finally settled at just over a month in age. Karen, the sexy, leggy, blonde nympho gone. In her place now was the tiny infant Karen. The girl so small that Todd could cradle her in one arm. As he now dressed her in a warm onesie and diaper, he smiled down at her. Hopefully Karen could get the life she deserved this time.</p>
