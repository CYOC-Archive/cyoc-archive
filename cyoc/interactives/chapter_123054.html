<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Danny stood fully on tiptoes and drew himself up. Even at full stretch James was now effortlessly taller than him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Too bad, Dude.&quot; said James &quot;You finished your growth spurt last year. No way are you ever going to catch up with me now&quot;<br />
<br />
As he said this, James drew a hand from the top of his own head towards the empty space above Danny&#39;s. Danny sunk back on his feet and once again stared forwards directly into his once shorter friend&#39;s Adam&#39;s apple.<br />
<br />
Danny reflected on the thought that he was now the short one and wondered what it might be like to accentuate the differences even more. This time he would take his own height down a few inches. He would follow the same plan as before and not only make his clothes get smaller with him as he shrank, but have everyone automatically believe that he had never reached a fraction of an inch more than this new shorter height at the end of his growth spurt.<br />
<br />
Danny looked up at James, noticeably bigger than him now, even at his current height of 5&#39;10&quot;. &quot;I guess not, but I&#39;m okay, I&#39;m still taller than many, even if I have to look up to you. Hey, give me a minute will you&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny made his excuses and went once again to the bathroom. He closed the door, and turned on the tap.<br />
<br />
James had ended up six inches bigger than his original height. Danny now had the urge to be six inches smaller than that height.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that when I go back in the room I will shrink eight inches and all my clothes will shrink with me and everyone&#39;ll think this is normal and that&#39;s the height I usually am&quot;<br />
<br />
With another shiver of anticipation Danny went back in the room, once again he stood next to James.<br />
<br />
To begin with nothing seemed to be happening, but slowly, imperceptibly at first, Danny noticed that his eye line was beginning to creep downwards.<br />
<br />
He swallowed hard. Not only was he no longer eye level to James&#39; Adam&#39;s Apple but James&#39; clavicle was beginning to edge upwards so that he was first looking directly at it, and then ever so slightly upwards.<br />
<br />
&quot;Danny&quot; said James &quot;I think you are smaller than you think you are. I bet you are more like about 5&#39;8&quot;. That&#39;s below average, Dude&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny stood one again on his tiptoes, stretching himself up. This time he found that he was once again eye level with James&#39; clavicle but that didn&#39;t last long and as he sunk back down onto his heels it was James chest that was squarely before him.<br />
<br />
As Danny&#39;s height continued to dwindle he noticed that he was becoming narrower too. James in contrast seemed to be expanding every second, filling his field of view, and increasingly looming above him in away that he had to admit was exciting.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;m about average&quot; replied Danny at length (knowing that he had sunk below average height some time ago) &quot;why don&#39;t you measure me?&quot;<br />
<br />
A wide smirk spread over the James&#39; face. He was going to have humiliate his buddy to make his point, sure, but it was going to be fun. There was no way that this little guy was average height, he was way smaller, probably no more than about 5&#39;6&quot;. He pitied him; being a tall guy was great.<br />
<br />
Danny lined up against the measuring chart on the wall (the same chart where he had once carefully charted his own progress towards 5&#39;10&quot; over long years) and James picked up a book and placed it with a gentle pressure on the top of his head.<br />
<br />
James smirk grew wider and wider as the book and his hand seemed to compress Danny&#39;s body further and further downwards.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, ha. Dude, you&#39;re a little bitty 5&#39;6&quot;. I knew it. No, wait a moment....less than that 5&#39;5&quot;, no make that 5&#39;4&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny reflected that while being this short with James was going to be fun, he would have to get used to being undersized in a lot of other situations too, at least until he wished things back (if he was even able to). He&#39;d still be taller than his little brother, he reckoned, but not by much.<br />
<br />
James was still pressing downwards with the book and calling out in triumph &quot;5&#39;3&quot;...no...5&#39;2&quot;!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;5&#39;2&quot;! You sure are one little guy, Dude! My 12 year old niece is taller than that!&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny again felt he was going to pass out and again James grabbed him by the arms and held him steady. Only this time James rather than just grabbing him, bent his knees first and squatted a long way down on his seemingly never ending legs to try to bring himself to Danny&#39;s eye level, only just failing. Danny noted how big James seemed now, how tiny his own feet seemed in comparison to his and how effortlessly James large hands wrapped themselves almost entirely around his narrow and undersized upper torso.<br />
<br />
Danny stared back at the height chart, and the 5&#39;10&quot; mark way above him were his head would have comfortably rested only a few minutes earlier.<br />
<br />
It was, undoubtedly, arousing.</p>
