<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gael think for a while, “you know, I’d love to have a Drone,” he says.<br />
<br />
“A Drone,” Jeff asks, “you mean like a military drone, these huge drones that… kill people?”<br />
<br />
Gael raises an eyebrow, “what, no,” he says, “I mean one of those small Drones, that have a camera, which anyone can buy and which cost hundreds of dollars.”<br />
<br />
“Ooooh,” Jeff says, “let me guess: you’d like to have a Drone which would follow you around while you do your parkour stuff and film you doing it?”<br />
<br />
Gael grins and nods, “yep,” he says, “I could upload the videos onto YouTube! I have always wanted to do that, showing of my skills.”<br />
<br />
“Hmmm… sounds like fun, I always wanted to sore through the air,” Jeff says, he then looks at Gael, “okay, I’ll be your Drone for the weekend.” The teen turns to his computer, he had scanned himself before hand, so he opens the folder labeled “Drones”. He and his brother look through the various models of Drones until Gael picks the DJI Phantom 4 Drone. Jeff nods and selects Gael’s choice, the screen then switches to a list of choices to customize the “Drone”, “okay, Gael,” Jeff says, “how should I look like as a “Drone”?”<br />
<br />
“Hmmm… I want your Drone body to be a nice royal-blue,” Gael says.<br />
<br />
“Okay… done,” Jeff says, “would you want me to have some cool details?”<br />
<br />
“Like what,” Gael asks.<br />
<br />
“Well, like, lightning bolt, a Dragon’s head,… .”<br />
<br />
“Hmm… I think white lightning bolts would look awesome,” Gael says, “is it possible to have the lightning bolts made out of LEDs? So that they like flash and glow in the dark?”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “yep,” he says, “would you want that?”<br />
<br />
Gael nods, “hell yeah,” he says excitedly.<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckles, “okay then,” he says and sets the change, “anything else?”<br />
<br />
Gael shakes his head, “nope, I think that’ll be enough.”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Jeff says and confirms the settings, the next window shows options to alter the reality, the duration of the change, how long the transformation should take and some other general settings. “Okay, let’s see,” Jeff says, “I want the transformation to be painless, I’d like to have the transformation take an hour, the duration I’ll set to 48 hours… hmm… I don’t think we need to alter the reality.”<br />
<br />
“Why not,” Gael asks.<br />
<br />
“Because, mom and dad are out over the weekend, so they would not “miss” me while I am gone,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
Gael nods, “okay, sounds logic,” he says, “so, when will the transformation start?”<br />
<br />
“Now,” Jeff says as he confirms the transformation, he shudders when he feels a tingle run through his body, “that felt weird,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Um… shouldn’t you get out of your clothes,” Gael suddenly asks.<br />
<br />
Jeff is taken aback, “why… oh,” he says, he blushes a little, he looks at Gael.<br />
<br />
Gael just shrugs, “we are both boys,” he says, “no need to be embarrassed. Besides: we’ve seen each other naked a couple of times.”<br />
<br />
“True,” Jeff says, “but… I kinda would rather not be naked in front of you. It feels… wrong.”<br />
<br />
“Jeff,” Gael says, “please, I really want to see you transform into my Drone,” he looks at Jeff with puppy dog eyes.<br />
<br />
Jeff groan, “okay, fine,” he says, he starts to strip, “oh, before I forget: no messing around with the memory card!”<br />
<br />
“Why not,” Gael asks.<br />
<br />
“Because, the memory card will have my personality and mind stored,” Jeff explains, “I don’t want you to mess me up, if you get my drift.”<br />
<br />
Gael sighs, “okay,” he says, “I promise to leave your mind alone, and just edit the videos I record.”<br />
<br />
“Good,” Jeff says, “I have also set the Chronivac so that I am able to talk with you over the speakers on the controls.”<br />
<br />
Gael nods, “okay, cool,” he says, he then notices something, “Jeff, I think it’s working!”<br />
<br />
Jeff looks down at his body, his eyes widen when he sees his skin has become a nice royal-blue and the texture looks more like plastic. His whole body then starts to itch and he feels all of his hairs, including the ones on his head and face, retreat back into his body.<br />
<br />
Gael giggles, “bro, you look silly,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Oh, shush,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
Gael grins, he then looks down his brother’s naked body, his eyes resting on his brother’s dick, “looks like your cock is going to become the camera! Man, this is so weird… but also cool at the same time!”<br />
<br />
Jeff blushes, “and scary,” he mumbles, “man, this program could cause so much chaos and would be dangerous in the wrong hands!”<br />
<br />
As Gael watches his brother slowly transform into his Drone, the 11-year-old looks over to Jeff’s computer, ‘I got to get my hands on that program,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I hope there is an App-Version of it. Hehe… I could have so much fun’<br />
<br />
By now, Jeff’s cock has completely transformed into the rotating camera, his blue skin has taken on the LED lightning bolt design.<br />
<br />
“Damn, bro,” Gael says, “you really look weird. I can’t wait for you to finally become a full Drone!”<br />
<br />
“Patience, brother,” Jeff says, his head starting to shrink, “you’ll get you Drone soon enough,” his voice becoming quieter the more his head shrinks down into his shoulders. Jeff panics a little, he is suddenly unable to see and talk, ‘I hope Gael does not do anything stupid,’ he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
Gael grins, “hehe… headless Jeff,” he says, “hm… I think some of his ribs are becoming the feet of the Drone. I better stand him on them, I don’t want my Drone to get damaged when he topples over when his legs bend back.”<br />
<br />
Jeff feels his brother’s hands on his plastic body, he feels Gael slowly tilting him downwards until he is standing on his new feet, ‘man… this feels weird!’<br />
<br />
“There, much better,” Gael says, smiling, ‘this is my chance to check the Appstore, to see if an App-Version exist,’ he then thinks to himself. Gael pulls out his phone and opens the App store, he soon finds the App version of the Chronivac, the boy grins and downloads and installs the App on his phone. ‘Hm… I wonder if I am able to copy Jeff’s file into the App,’ he thinks to himself, ‘that way I already have him stored and can do what ever I want with him.’ Gael smirks, ‘this is gonna be fun,’ he then hears a sickening sounding “crack”. The boy turns around and grins when he notices that Jeff’s arms and legs have bent upwards, Jeff’s hands and feet already looking more like the propellers of the soon-to-be Drone. Gael turns his attention to Jeff’s computer, he notices a loading bar on the screen which reads, “30% until completion”.<br />
<br />
Jeff feels his insides: organs, veins, bones, muscles… everything change into the electronics of the Drone he is becoming, then he feels his body shrink to the size of a normal drone. The air next to the “Drone” glimmers, and a controller materializes. The controller has a big screen, buttons to program the “Drone”, giving it orders what to do and joysticks to control the “Drone’s” flight pattern.<br />
<br />
Gael hears a ping and a message pops up on the screen, “transformation successful, enjoy”, the screen then turns to normal. The boy grins, ‘my chance to copy Jeff’s file into the App on my phone,’ he thinks to himself. Gael hurries into his room to get the cable to his phone, when he returns he attaches his phone to Jeff’s computer. After a few clicks, Gael now has an exact copy of Jeff’s file stored in his Chronivac-App. Gael turns his attention to the “Drone” standing in the middle of Jeff’s room, “wow, you have turned out great,” he says, picking up his former brother and examining him, “and perfect timing too: I planned to do some parkour with some friends in an hour. Let’s test you out and see how well you do,” Gael grins. He grabs the remote control and hurries down stairs to get his shoes on, “best birthday gift ever,” he says, “can’t wait to try the Drone out… and maybe… have some “other” fun,” the boy smirks as he pats his pocket where his phone is in.<br />
<br />
Gael opens the door and is about to leave, when a thought pops into his head, the boy looks down at the “Drone” in his hand, ‘I better check if the memory card has enough storage space,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I really would be mad if I’d be unable to record a video.’<br />
<br />
The boy hurries back up to Jeff’s room, he sits down at Jeff’s computer, which is still running. Gael then pushes on the SD-card slit of the “Drone” and a small card pops out. The boy smile as he pulls the tiny card out of the drone, “so… this is what has become of Jeff’s brain,” he asks himself, he then lets out a snort, “pathetic… let’s hope the storage is big enough.” Gael inserts the “Card” into Jeff’s computer, he waits for the Computer to open the SD-Card’s file, the boy’s eyes widen, “whoa, everything about Jeff is stored on the card: his personality, memories, name, age,… everything,” he says. The boy then looks at the percentage, “WHAT! Only 10% left of storage space? That won’t do,” Gael looks over at the “Drone”, “I know I promised not to mess with your mind, Jeff… but… I need more storage!”<br />
<br />
Gael turns his head back to the computer screen, he scrolls through Jeff’s human data, ‘should I really be doing this,’ he asks himself, ‘Jeff is my brother… I like him as such… but I like the “Drone” even more! What shall I do?’</p>
