<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At next Coach Randall told all male students to stand up before he continued with his speech.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems that the boys at this school aren&#39;t man enough to play some decent football, so I think we should try a new way. If you are not tough enough to fight for you r school than perhaps you should support us from the sideline.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt looked at Neill and Bruno, not sure what the Coach was talking about. When he turned his head to his other side to look at the rest of his class, his vision was obscured by a veil of dark blonde hair. Since when was his hair so long? He looked at the others and to his surprise he saw that his fellow classmates had now too shoulder length hair and growing. He looked back at Bruno and saw that his muscled frame began to shrink and became softer and rounder, more into a hourglass figure. A look at Neill showed him that the face of his friend was now softer, somehow girly with long eyelashes, high cheeks and puffy lips. Feeling his own body shifting, Matt looked down and his view was blocked by two fleshy orbs protruding from his chest and stretching his shirt. He also felt movement in his crotch which alarmed him of a more important change. But as much as he liked to do something against it, to step and yell at the coach, who was obviously doing something to them, he found that he could just stand there and watch the change happening. A change which now also affected his clothing. The legs of his jeans began to fuse and crawled upwards to form skirt, while his shirt was changing into tight girls top with long sleeves. Even his shoes weren&#39;t left out and his old chucks were transforming into a pair of white and pink women sneaker, which fitted his now smaller feet. He also felt his underwear changing, presumably into panties and a bra.<br />
<br />
Looking around, he saw that the change must be complete. Where just a minute ago was a bunch of male students of all forms was now a group of attractive cheerleaders in white and pink uniforms. Matt looked at Bruno, who was still rather fit as a girl and one of the tallest of them. His brown hair was still short for a girl, not even shoulder length and showed two pearl studs in his ears. But his face and body was clearly female, and with his b-cup breasts he looked every inch like a female athlete.<br />
<br />
Neill on the other hand hand was now probably 5 feet 2 and his long black hair was tied into a ponytail. With his still serious face and his small breasts he looked more like a typical nerd girl than a cheerleader.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to us, Nina?&quot;, asked Bruno Neill next to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;How should I know? And why are you calling me Nina, Brianna?&quot;, snapped Neill at Bruno.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t now? I just tried to call your name. And hey, you called me Brianna! What&#39;s going on here?, said a confused Bruno in his new cute soprano voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Madeline! What&#39;s going on here?&quot;, asked Neill, while tipped Matt on his shoulder now her shoulder.<br />
<br />
Matt cringed as she heard her new girl name. She watched the Coach who somehow proud inspected the new cheerleaders.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know Nina. It just seems that the coach has something to do with this, and that we somehow can only call us by our girl names.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, girls!&quot;, said Coach Randall after a satisfying look at the new cheerleaders. &quot;You will now all go to the gym to meet Ms. Edith, the new cheerleading coach, and start your training. The other female students stay with me. We will join you later. Now go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt, now Madeline and the others grabbed their bags, which somehow also changed into girls bags, and went down the hall to the gym, unsure what to do except following the Coach&#39;s orders.<br />
<br />
On the way Madeline got a good look at the other girls who still resembled somehow her former selves and she became curious what she looked like. On an instinct she rummaged in her bag and found a compact mirror. Looking at herself she was shocked. Her breast must be at least a c-cup, if not a d-cup and her face was covered in cute freckles along with some subtile make-up, which she had also seen on other newly transformed cheerleaders. But must shocking for her was her hair which turned from dark blonde to strawberry blonde was tied into two long pigtails. While Nina looked more like the small and intelligent cheerleader, and Brianna more like the tall and athletic cheerleader, Madeline was obviously more the cute and bubbly cheerleader.<br />
<br />
Before Madeline could worry more about her appearance the group entered the gym to meet the new cheerleading coach.</p>
