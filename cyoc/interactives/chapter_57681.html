<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Travis went into the changing room and tried on the leotard. It must've been twice his size, and the straps were the only things keeping the leotard from falling to his feet. Between his embarrassment and thought of taking off the leotard, he felt a shock stop him. The shock spread thought his body, making his body tingle and heat up. <br />
<br />
&quot;What's happening?!&quot; Travis shouted, although the experience was actually a good feeling one. &quot;W-why am I enjoying this, this is freaky!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then it hit him, the change that was waiting to happen. His arms, legs, chest, and stomach ballooned. However, it wasn't his muscles that grew in size, it was his fat. He went from 8% body fat right up to 30%, now he had a round belly and some fat on his chest, his legs jiggled and his upper arm had some dangling flubber. He now had a thick layer of fat covering most of his body, even some to thicken out his face, hands, and feet - making them appear broader, larger, and more durable. Like a wrestler's.<br />
<br />
&quot;F-fat?!&quot; Travis cried, looking at his decently toned body disappear under the sporadically growing fat. He almost broke out into tears until he felt a shock rage throughout his body. This time it was more intense and affected his innards more. He was so hot that he began to pant, sweat, and turn a reddish hue. &quot;No! No,no,no! Not more!&quot;<br />
<br />
Now Travis ballooned once more, though it wasn't his fat this time. He could actually feel his skeletal frame thicken, grow harder, stronger, taller, wider - with each centimeter of growth causing some sort of discomfort and pain. He went from an average 5'7&quot; to 6'2&quot;. In addition to that, his fat spread out over his frame, causing him to no longer be obese. Instead, his body had a modest layer of fat, something a normal man would have - especially one that was rough and tough. On top of that, his blond, fuzzy body hair began to become more visible as it grew darker in color. Rather, it was thickening and lengthening, giving Travis an attractive treasure trail that lead to a moderately hairy chest. His underarm hair and pubic hair pushed out a bit, but it wasn't too much - while the hair on the rest of his body grew to 1/2 an inch to 2/3 of an inch long. As for his face, he now had a stubbly beard that looked like it was freshly shaved a day ago, making it appear short and neat - but still gave Travis the look of a burly man.<br />
<br />
A third surge shot through his body, this time filling him with what felt like raw power. His muscles expanded quickly, pushing the fat out of its way and molding it over their growing mass. His muscles, despite having fat over them, were clearly visible, dense, and strong. He guessed his body's new size, and summed up that his chest was no 62&quot;, his arms were 27&quot;, his waist was 35&quot; and his legs were 39&quot;. He was massive, and the leotard fit perfectly seeing as how it clung to his moderately hairy skin, well, almost perfectly. He must've weighed 350 pounds, possibly more!<br />
<br />
Lastly, a surge shot to his groin, strengthening his pelvic muscles. Travis had an idea what was happening as he looked at his crotch, noticing the the small bump was pulsating. The bulge began to grow with each pulse, sending euphoric shocks throughout every inch of Travis' new body. His penis was a lowly 1&quot; when flaccid, and 4&quot; when erect, but now in it's flaccid state, it was pushing 2&quot;, then 3&quot;, then 4&quot;, 5&quot;, 6&quot;, 7&quot;. His testicles followed his penis' growth, causing his scrotum to balloon out to make room for his testicles. Then the testicles went from the size of grapes, to plums, to oranges, to grapefruits within a matter of seconds. They were already producing loads of testosterone and sperm, trying to keep up with the amount Travis needed to maintain his heightened virility. He was now producing a subtle, musky, phereomone packed scent. He could smell it, but it didn't seem all that concentrated, so it would probably only work in closed, small rooms while Travis was aroused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa...&quot; Travis murmured. Not noticing the change in his voice right away.<br />
<br />
Travis flexed and posed, and he liked the feel of the leotard pressing against his massive chest, thighs, and crotch. While Travis was in the middle of that, Jake had entered the room and locked the door behind him. Then Travis remembered how he sounded when he murmured, and wanted to see how he sounded normally. He decided to have some fun with it, since he figured this lucid dream would be over soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm... Trav- Wait, no, T-Rex the ultimate wrestler. Powerful and mighty, a monstrous beast among men, no one can stop the rampaging T-Rex!&quot; Travis exclaimed, striking a pose that showed off his 'power and might'.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, nice pose there. Looks like you're ready for the real deal, Mr. T-Rex.&quot; A voice rang out, causing Travis to jump up. When he realized who it was, he relaxed a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jake! DON'T DO THAT!&quot; Travis scolded, stepping forth to loom over Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey now big guy, you gotta be nice. Speaking of nice, you look nice. Isn't that nice of me to say?&quot; Jake joked as he  squeezing Travis' various muscles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I can't get over it either. I feel so... Manly! Too bad it's a dream.&quot; Travis replied as he let out a depressed sigh. &quot;Maybe if I work hard, I can look like this in real life. I wonder where I even got an idea for a dream like this, or how I dreamed up such a hot guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hot guy? Flattery gets you everywhere. But I can tell ya now, this isn't a dream.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha, good one.&quot; Travis said, suddenly becoming shifty. He looked to his left, then his right, and finally stopped at his beefy arm. He pinched it with all his might, and it definitely stung.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck!&quot; Travis yelled. &quot;T-this is... R-real! ... This is fucking sweet!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Now you caught on, great job. Oh and, I'm your manager and I already have you entered in for wrestling try outs. You'll be a big wrestling star in no time thanks to that dangerous sex appeal and all that power.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not a real wrestler, I don't even know how to wrestle. Don't I need some protection? Like a helmet? Or a cup? I'm not prepared. You've got the wrong guy.&quot; Travis quickly blurted, his face growing red from embarrassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;For starters, this suit made you a godlike wrestler. Secondly,&quot; Jake stopped, and swiftly punched Travis' bulging crotch.&quot;the suit makes your junk as durable as steel. Though I'm sure if you tried to punch it, it'd hurt. So, T-Rex, you should be more than prepared. Clothes make the man, costumes make the professional, blah blah blah. Besides, now you have something to do with your life. You can be a professional wrestler, bam, finding a steady job is right off the check list. Then you can focus on other things. Sounds like a good deal, right? Also, just in case you're wondering, your body will stay like that even without the leotard on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; Travis said, looking down at his crotch, waiting to feel some sort of pain - but it didn't come. In fact, it felt like an oddly arousing sensation. &quot;I guess you're right. I can do this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We've got about two hours to kill.&quot; Jake mentioned, flashing a charming smile as he elbowed Travis muscle-gut. &quot;We can do anything. I'll even let you decide on what to do, champ.&quot;</p>
