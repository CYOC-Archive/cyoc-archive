<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was something he needed to do. But what, he couldn&#39;t quite remember. Around him, five or six girls, all two years older him, where in various states of undress. Somehow, he wasn&#39;t sure exactly how though, he knew was naked, and unconcerned that he was in the girl&#39;s locker room, he tried focus on what he felt needed to be addressed.<br />
<br />
Close by, a girl squealed out, &quot;Tanya, you cannot be serious,&quot; and Chris looked over at his sister. About to ask her what he needed to do, he saw that she was naked and quickly looked away.<br />
<br />
Embarrassed that he&#39;d seen his sister without clothes, Chris asked himself, &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Not able to answer this, he felt certain that they had seen each other nude before. That they had taken baths together when they&#39;d been younger, used the same communal showers when they&#39;d gone to the pool, among other times. A shake of his head and as he absently rubbed his chest, Chris told himself, &quot;We never. She&#39;s my sister. I&#39;m her...&quot;<br />
<br />
But what he was to her was lost as he once again felt the need to take care of something. But what, he still wasn&#39;t sure and looking about, he was caught by surprise when Lizzie, who was as naked as he and Tanya were, walked up to him and handed him a bra. Unsure why, he peered down at the pastel mint green garment, noted the thin shoulder straps and that it fastened in front, and glancing up to ask why she&#39;d given it to him, he saw that she had turned away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t where these,&quot; he wanted to call out, and instead found himself putting it on.<br />
<br />
Soft against his skin, Chris found the bra actually comfortable. A quick adjust of shoulder straps, he fastened the clip in front. His chest starting to push out to fill the cups, he didn&#39;t give it a second thought as he adjusted himself so his boobs sat comfortably. The need to find something that he was sure he&#39;d misplaced grew and taking a step, he stopped when he saw the mirror.<br />
<br />
And immediately moaned, &quot;Shit. I&#39;ve got tits.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure how it was possible, he stared at the two bits of flesh that now dominated his upper torso. The bra, he noted, seemed to make them a smidge bigger than the B cup size he somehow knew them to be. Certain they were in some way connected to what he was looking for, he absently stared at the bra, the lace bit on the top part of the cups, thought how cute it was, and tried to figure out what it was he was looking for. Movement caught his eye and spotting Annie, who was only wearing her bra and panties, he watched her approach before he turned away from the mirror.<br />
<br />
About to ask her if she could help him, he never got a chance when she handed him a pair of pastel mint green boyshorts. Again, he wanted to say that he didn&#39;t wear such things, but instead watched as she turned away. Pulling on the underwear, he turned back to the mirror. Thoughts still on that he&#39;d lost something, he grimaced at the lacey front and when he saw his boy parts poking out one of the leg holes. But then the strangest thing began to happen, as he decided the lace actually looked cute, and his privates shrank and pulled up inside the panties to become parts that, to him, seemed more right. Turning back to the mirror, he ran his hand through his hair, now down past his shoulders, and thought, &quot;Holy crap. I&#39;m a girl,&quot; and suddenly remembering what it was she was looking for, Chris spun away from the mirror.<br />
<br />
With a start, Chris kicked the comforter off her bed and awoke. The dream still fresh in her mind, she sat up quickly and still not fully awake, leapt out of bed and tore across her room. Her mind addled, she thought, &quot;Have to become a guy again. Don&#39;t want to remain a girl,&quot; she located her purse and began to dump the stuff out in search of the amulet.<br />
<br />
Coin purse, wallet, pads, tampons, pantie liners, the few bits of make-up she did wear, and various bits of whatnot all piled on the desk, a low moan of dispair escaped her when she didn&#39;t find the necklace. Sinking down into the chair in front of her vanity, the past couple weeks gradually came back to her as she recalled how she&#39;d already done what she was doing once again, and that, no matter how many times she looked, the truth was that the Amulet of Zulo had vanished from her purse, leaving her stuck as a girl. <br />
<br />
Upset by this, Chris stared at the stuff she&#39;d pulled from her purse, picked up a couple of the more intimate feminine products and slowly slipped them back into the hand bag. The dream already fading, she sighed as she thought how she&#39;d had the same dream before, how she&#39;d awoken the same way, and been reminded that she was stuck. Standing, she drifted over to the full body mirror and gazed into the reflective surface. Her fourteen year old self peered back as she took in the over-sized cotton shirt she had on, the adorable image of a pastel pegasus sleeping on a cloud on the front, and how she could just barely see the shorts she had on underneath, as the shirt didn&#39;t go down far enough to cover them completely. Sighing, &quot;It wasn&#39;t supposed to be permanent,&quot; Chris thought of the past weeks she&#39;d spent as a girl, how she&#39;d continued to play for her sister&#39;s team, who&#39;d won the championship, and the oddity on how, at one time, there had been a girl named Nancy on the team, but now there was someone named Lizzie.<br />
<br />
Confused by this, she remembered the conversation she&#39;d had with Tanya after they&#39;d discovered the amulet was missing, the talks they&#39;d had when they found Nancy replaced, and that only they remembered her, and another sigh escaped her as she turned away from the mirror. Shucking off the shirt and shorts she&#39;d worn to bed, Chris glanced down at her naked body before she headed for her dresser. Thoughts on the necklace, the mystery girl Nancy, and the reality that when she went back to school in a week or so, she&#39;d be a girl, Chris pulled a denim romper from her dress, tank top, bra, and underwear. Dressed, she headed for the bathroom to find her brush to run through her hair.<br />
<br />
Tanya not up yet, Chris figured her use of her sister&#39;s computer would have to wait as she finished in the bathroom and headed for the kitchen. There, as she got herself breakfast, she found the usual note left by mom that explained she&#39;d be working late. Sitting down to eat her cereal, Chris let her mind wander as she thought of the dream, of which she could only recall it had something to do with her male self, the mystery girl that she and Tany were sure had been on the team, though who she had been, or even her last name, neither knew for certain, and the Amulet of Zulo, what she believed was her only hope of regaining some normancy. And as she finished eating, she arrived at the same conclusion she had come to many times before; that it had been a mistake to use the necklace and now she was paying the price for doing so.</p>
