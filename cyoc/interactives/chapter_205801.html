<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Troy watched the ripple head towards him, striking park goers. <br />
<br />
A couple sunning themselves on blankets next to his bench stiffened and then wrapped themselves in each other’s arms, legs thinning and becoming covered in fur, rumps plumping as waggly little goat tails popped from their spines. The gay couple writhed together in a bout of very public sex as their bodies growing rougher and courser, features becoming rugged. One grew a goatee as horns twisted from his brow while the other grew a full beard, his horns bigger. The larger satyr took command of the sex, thrusting his meaty rod into the bottom’s hole. Bleats filled the air.<br />
<br />
The other park goers seemed oblivious to the intercourse happening right in the middle of the park. <br />
<br />
A yoga class across the way transformed into dryads and nyads. Runners stumbled, bodies enlarging.  Some shifting into Centaurs and others into anthro-horses as the reality shift struck them at different times. A few, of course, remained human. Troy wondered briefly how the magic chose which stayed the way they were and which changed. <br />
<br />
The park itself twisted and shifted, trees stretching majestically to the sky, no longer oak or elm, but something far more story-book exotic, branches willowy and filled with sweet-scented flowers.  The fountain became much more fun, the spouts set into the ground now shooting water into the air in strange, gravity-defying arcs, making shapes. <br />
<br />
Troy turned as the waves converged on him, his clothes billowing in the ripples of reality.  He could actually feel the spells at war within his own body. Judging from his last uses of the Mass spells, he was the last to shift. Something else happened to, he remembered, but he usually canceled the spell before.<br />
<br />
Lancer cleared his throat.<br />
<br />
Troy turned and saw that reality had apparently chosen to shift Lancer back to a Leonin. <br />
<br />
His bright orange-and-cream striped fur quickly shifted to yellow, except for the hair surrounding his face. It rapidly grew longer and luxurious, color darkening to brown and becoming a handsome mane, little metal beads weaving into some of the braided strands. Lancer’s body quickly made his position on the bench comical as he grew taller, towering over Troy even while sitting on the comparatively tiny bench.<br />
<br />
Lancer stood, his muscle bulging, and Troy thanked the gods(?) that the clothing had shifted with him.<br />
<br />
The dark blue sleeveless shirt barely contained the straining muscles of the massive Leonin. His black shorts were hard pressed to keep the globular ass cheeks restrained. He looked like he could burst free of the outfit at any moment. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good?&quot; Lancer asked as he pulled his claws out of his round lion ears and looked around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh,&quot; Troy panted, his body feeling off. “I’m not sure. You’re back to being a Leonin, but I think I’m changing.”<br />
<br />
There was a subtle and growing heat rushing through him as he kneeled on the ground next to the park bench, gasping. He shivered, goosebumps prickling along his arms, the hairs standing up and looking strangely…darker and thicker than normal. <br />
<br />
His cock stiffened in his pants and his balls churned, feeling strangely and literally hot. Troy felt a sudden, inexplicable surge of power through his body, heat rushing through his veins growing with each beat of his pounding heart. Sweat popped up from his brow and Troy’s armpits suddenly felt wet with perspiration. <br />
<br />
Troy went to stand and immediately regretted it. <br />
<br />
The heat reached his head, testosterone smacking his brain and leaving him woozy. He stumbled, dizzy. His hand went to his forehead as he attempted to steady himself and found the skin feeling oddly rough to the touch.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t just his forehead, he realized, bit the palm of his hand felt rougher as well. Skin on skin felt strange and the rest of his face felt firmer as well, like there was a callous covering Troy’s entire body. His sense of touch was strangely numb, skin toughening like leather. <br />
<br />
His hand looked paler when he brought it down, but he suddenly felt uncomfortable. Troy rolled his shoulders and fiddled with his shirt and jeans. His clothes itched and as he scratched at himself, he realized it was because the clothes were chafing his rougher skin. He stretched his arm behind his back and dealt with an itch there and sighed in relief. <br />
<br />
Stretching felt really good with how swollen his body felt.<br />
<br />
Troy’s clothes started to feel tight, making the chafing even worse. He twisted uncomfortably, his shirt constricting his arms and shoulder and his pants tightening at his waist. He belatedly realized why he didn’t shift in public-his clothes didn’t adjust to his new form. If he grew too big, he’d tear right out of them.<br />
<br />
“I gotta go.” Troy spoke rapidly, breaking into a run for the privacy of the bathrooms. It looked more like a bathhouse than a bathroom now. “I’m going to rip through these clothes.”<br />
<br />
“W-wait, Troy!” Lancer called, the Leonin jogging alongside him. “What are you gonna do?”<br />
<br />
“I’m gonna-Hah!” Troy bit back a moan as his biceps began to swell pleasantly, feeling like he’d just worked out. Sooner than he’d like, the sleeves of his shirt became taut. “Gonna get to that bathroom at the end of the park. They’ve got showers there, I’ll hide in one of them.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll try to find some clothes.” Lancer nodded. “How, uh, big are you going to get?”<br />
<br />
“No idea!” Troy huffed. Sweat was poring from him now, completely soaking his clothes. “This is way more intense than usual! Most of the time I don’t even really notice it!”<br />
<br />
“What’d you change?” Lancer asked, his furred eyebrow lifting.<br />
<br />
“Everything!” Troy gasped. “The whole town!”<br />
<br />
Lancer blinked. “You may have over done it a bit, I think.”<br />
<br />
Troy was about to reply but had to stifle a moan as his muscles began to burn, feeling both energized and oddly fatigued at the same time. <br />
<br />
His shoulders popped painlessly and broadened, stretching his shirt to the limit. Troy felt the thick musculature surge down his arms and spared them a glance. Thick ribbons of muscle spread under his skin like snakes, veins popping out and throbbing, achieving a level of vascularity most bodybuilders could only dream of. His arms bulked enormously, putting even the Leonin’s muscles to shame. <br />
<br />
The change hit his hands and they grew wide. His fingers lengthened and then grew together, leaving Troy with two thick digits and an opposable thumb. They were thick and wide and a bit clumsy, but with the meat on them, Troy was sure they had amazing grip-strength. His fingernails altered, becoming blunt and heavy, curling over the tips of his meaty fingers like little hooves.<br />
<br />
With how fast his body was growing, his clothes wouldn’t be lasting for much longer. <br />
<br />
The Leonin took one look at him as he bulked and quickly sprinted away, much faster than the top-heavy transforming human could-faster than any human could, actually. <br />
<br />
While Troy was distracted by the sight of Lancer’s amazing glutes bouncing as he ran, the tissue growth flowed downwards.<br />
<br />
He gets horned up and turns the shower on to hide his muskiness. He fully transforms and steals an ogre roadworker’s clothes, reality shifting back and forth to give them back to him. The ogre stepped out naked while Troy was attempting to steal his clothes and he had to do something to the studly ogre (no sex, naked hairy beefy man). Lancer tells him he is a Rhox, a rhinoceros man from his world.<br />
<br />
Troy kept running, nearing his goal. The brick building was now a stone spa with a hot springs attached to it and he only had a couple hundred yards left. It was much harder to get there now as his top-heavy muscles were working against him. The tissue growth continued, making his progress even worse.<br />
<br />
With every breath he took , he chest swelled further and further as more mass piled onto his pectorals. Troy registered the shift only when the buttons on his shirt pulled taut and started to creak. His shoulders hadn’t stopped growing broader and his bulging pecs and rapidly barreling torso was becoming far too wide and deep for his shirt. Even his collar was growing tight, the muscles in his neck swelling, almost choking him. <br />
<br />
Troy rolled his head and let out a surprisingly deep grunt as the top button on his shirt gave out. Then the second button gave way, offering him temporary respite from the pressure and exposing the massive slabs of his pecs. They twitched with every pump of his equally huge arms, the wide, thick cords bunching and contracting.<br />
<br />
Less than a hundred yards now. Troy dimly realized he was garnering looks from some of the other park goers, but ignored them. His face hadn’t changed, and by the time he left the spa, he’d be a new man, literally.<br />
<br />
The changes continued. Troy felt air on his belly and realized he had been slowly growing taller. His shirt was now too small and too short for his growing frame, pulling up his potbelly and exposing his midriff. The exposed skin was gray and leathery. More muscles filled in, his potbelly not so much disappearing but stretching over them, the outlines of a 6 pack clearly visible under the now-thin layer of chub, leaving Troy with a bulky musclegut.<br />
<br />
His changes hit his waist. <br />
<br />
Troy’s core continued to thicken with muscle and his hips grew wider and sturdier. His belt buckle strained as the growth continued, unrelenting, the leather tongue looking ready to snap. Then things got very uncomfortable as the changes went lower as his crotch tingled and swelled, bulging the front of his jeans obscenely. His genitals were forced down his too-tight pants legs, the pressure almost crushing his massive balls. <br />
<br />
His run quickly turned into a ginger shuffling. His clothes were too constrained for him to move properly. The door to the men’s room was just in front of him. He reached for it and gasped as he felt a sharp, stabbing pain in his lower back.<br />
<br />
Troy reached back and felt around his waist, exposed to the air from his too-small shirt. His hand lit on a hard, bony lump at the base of his spine. So he was going to have a tail. Was he turning into an elephant or something?<br />
<br />
He entered the men’s room just as the changes spread down his legs. The air was thick with the smell of shampoo and bodywash, a cloud of steam hanging heavy in the air. Someone was using a shower. Troy tried to be sneaky so they wouldn’t hear him, but his legs lacked the real muscle to support his increasingly enormous body.<br />
<br />
The bones in his legs ached. They lengthened,. his pants quickly grew too short, the cuffs rising halfway up his calves. He stumbled to the showers, grabbing someone’s body wash they’d left next to their backpack. More ribbons of muscles descended down his legs, thighs thickening with huge, bulky muscle. The seams of his jeans began to pull apart as he drew back a curtain in an empty shower stall. His calves flared so wide the stitching began to pop.<br />
<br />
Troy turned on the shower, hoping it would cover any sounds that came from his stall. <br />
<br />
The water soaked his clothes, but soon that wouldn’t be an issue. The transformation progressed to his feet as they grew wide and fleshy, swelling his shoes and straining the laces. His lower leg and foot was growing so thick that the elastic on his socks snapped.<br />
<br />
Troy panted, happy that he’d finally finished growing, when he felt a tingle in his spine that intensified.<br />
<br />
The bones of his vertebrae <I>grew</I> as his spinal cord stretched further, the cartilage disks increasing in size. All of his muscle groups twitched and stretched pleasurably, forcing out a long moan from Troy. His ribs pushed apart, chest widening. The ceiling rushed towards him as he grew a foot and a half within seconds, leaving Troy reeling, vertigo staggering him against the side of his stall..<br />
<br />
That was the end for his clothes. <br />
<br />
The growth of his chest tore his shirt in half. Troy looked down, view of the rest of his body blocked by thick gray pecs. He could feel his pants ripped apart, the stitches running along the side tearing all the way up to his crotch, his half-crushed balls flopping out. Troy’s belt snapped, the button and fly ripping apart. The heavy pressure constricting and crushing his crotch went away.<br />
<br />
Troy reached down and ripped away what was left of his shirt, pants and underwear, tossing the ruined remnants outside the stall.<br />
<br />
As he did, his shoes gave way, laces ripping from eyelets and the leather along the sides tore apart with the sudden growth. Troy lifted his feet and what remained fell away, leaving his strangely twisted feet exposed. They were huge and meaty, toes covered up by heavy cankles, only the nubs of three thick hooflets exposed. Each toe was covered in an even thicker nail than the ones on his hands.<br />
<br />
Troy panted happily, having gotten out of his ruined outfit, his short, ropey tail wagging. Then he sniffed the air and gagged. All that sweating made him smell like a barn! A very spicy, rich musk. Troy lathered up some body wash and showered himself off.<br />
<br />
He couldn’t see anything below his chest but he could still feel things. Troy didn’t think he had body hair, but he was wrong. He felt stiff black hair carpeting his pecs and musclegut. His hand lowered and he encountered bristly pubs and his balls. They were like two big apples in a sac that drooped mid-thigh. When he soaped the globe of his asscheeks, he found they, too, had grown solid and strong. His cock was still human, oddly enough, and incredibly erect.<br />
<br />
Troy’s hand brushed against it and it jumped at the strange rough touch. He slid his fingers around the base of his dick, through the thick bristly pubes, then wrapped his thick three-fingered hand around his cock. At first his hands absolutely dwarfed it. Only after a minute of stroking and having to use his whole hand did he realizes that it was growing, swelling past his meaty hand. It towered from his crotch and was so thick he had to two-hand it.<br />
<br />
The contrast of his thick calloused fingers on his smooth, rigid shaft felt strange and delightful. He clenched his ass and thrust his cock into his tough hands, blood boiling over. His cock grew and grew, fourteen inches, then sixteen, the skin of his shaft changing color from purplish to a dark black. His cock head swelled and flattened until he was pumping a thick black plug.<br />
<br />
It felt so good that he didn’t care that he was bellowing and grunting like an animal. Troy couldn’t deny that however weird the transformation was, it was pleasurable. The testosterone hadn’t stopped coursing through his veins. It made him feel sexy and powerful and strong and very, very horny.  He clenched his eyes shut and threw his head back in ecstasy, tail standing straight up and waving like a flag. <br />
<br />
Troy’s hot, explosive gasps blew past teeth that blunted and flattened into molars, becoming better suited for eating vegetation than meat. His face throbbed in rhythm with his cock as it extended forward, jaw elongating, taking the rest of his face with it. Troy’s skull stretched, muscles pulling and thickening, upper jaw and nose merging into a set of wide, heavy nostrils that huffed his spicy barnyard musk. His ears grew and furled into a tubular shape, twitching in ecstasy. <br />
<br />
At the tip of his nose, pressure welled and Troy could feel something throbbing just beneath the surface. A thick ivory nub thrust out from his nose, followed by a smaller one just behind it. The pressure welled and pulsed as the nubs grew larger and sharper.<br />
<br />
His rigid shaft stopped growing when it was almost two feet long, though Troy was too caught up stroking his slippy meat stick to notice. <br />
<br />
Troy’s balls bounced in their sack as his beat his massive meat, eyes rolled up in the back of his head and tongue hanging out. There weren’t any thoughts in his mind right now except the pleasure. He could feel his orgasm coming, his balls tensing. He wedged himself in to the corner of the shower stall and tightened his grip, stroking harder and harder.<br />
<br />
Troy’s horn stretched towards the ceiling, almost a foot and a half long, curved. It filled him with a foreign sense of pride, somehow Troy innately understood its length indicated he was a virile male. He grunted, adjusting his grip on his thick black cock. <br />
<br />
<I>Yeah, he was a real virile man, with a huge horn.</I><br />
<br />
The thought was so startlingly erotic that Troy felt his balls clench as he suddenly orgasmed.<br />
<br />
His cock juddered and flailed like a firehose. Troy bellowed and stamped his foot as the slit on his flat black cockhead flared and shot a jet of cum against the wall. His balls clenched again and he sprayed cum all over the walls and floor, wad after wad of rich, creamy jizz. He must’ve emptied a gallon of seed before his cock gave a final jerk and the semen began to flow down his cockhead to drip into the drain.<br />
<br />
Troy slumped against the wall, exhausted. His big nostrils flared wide as he wheezed, absolutely out of breath. He felt the warm water cascade over his mildly numb form, and basked in the afterglow. He could smell everything much better now. His own strange spicy barnyard musk, the ammoniac stench of his own seed as it dripped down the walls and swirled down the drain.<br />
<br />
Troy could even smell the other man who had been showering and realized he could smell <I>his</I> musk and exertions as well. His eyes snapped open as he panicked and turned the shower head to clean his seed and the associated stink away. Cleanup done, he decided to turn off the shower and drip-dry.  <br />
<br />
He pulled back the curtain and stepped out into the warm air of the spa, not even shivering. The cold wasn’t bothering him much. Troy glanced around, searching for a towel, but found none aside from his neighbor’s, but he’d notice it missing. He <I>did</I> see a full-length mirror on the far wall, however. Troy wondered what he looked like.<br />
<br />
The transformed man swaggered to the looking-glass, footsteps heavy, practically shaking the floor. Troy had no idea what his current weight was, but it had to be at least 500. He was basically solid muscle at this point.<br />
<br />
Troy looked in the mirror and gasped.<br />
<br />
Staring back at him was an absolutely massive rhino-man. He stared, taking in his incredible form. Troy estimated he had to be at least 7 and a half feet tall, his curved horn reaching 9. His chest was four feet wide and equally deep, with tree-trunk-like legs and enormously muscular arms. His gut was a solid fold of flab. A little tail dangled from the considerable cleft of his ass. It did nothing to conceal the black donut of his puffy asshole which sat snugly between two cheeks that could put Lancer’s to shame. He had body hair, thick black strands that covered his chest and belly. Troy’s head seemed more rhino than man, with black eyes, tubular ears that flickered at every little sound and a long snout with wide-set nostrils.<br />
<br />
Troy took himself and wondered what he needed to do next. He bit his thick gray lip in contemplation. Wait here, naked and shivering, for Lancer to come back? Or steal the large, dirty work clothes on the bench?<br />
<br />
He decided to quietly lumber to the bench and put on the nasty clothes. It was better than nothing, after all. Surprisingly, the dirty jeans and sweaty shirt fit him fairly well. Even stranger, the boots fit him too. Troy grunted as he bent over to lace them up, then shrugged the reflective vest over his massive shoulders and started walking towards the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still wearing yer work gear, Troy?&quot; A deep, garrulous voice boomed from behind him.<br />
<br />
The massive rhinoceros man spun around, not noticing his name stitching itself into the vest.<br />
<br />
A huge, gray-green skinned ogre with big tusks stood behind him, dripping with water, completely naked. He was just as enormous and muscled as Troy himself was. He seemed completely unphased about being nude around Troy, brazenly toweling himself off.<br />
<br />
And then Troy remembered this was a locker room and he was being incredibly stupid. More importantly, how the hell did this dude know his name? <br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; Troy rumbled back and then gasped.<br />
<br />
His voice was equally as deep and powerful as the ogre&#39;s, even had that same rumbly quality to it<br />
<br />
&quot;Owen? Yer boss, remember?&quot; The ogre guffawed. &quot;Seeing me naked really got you flustered, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Boss? Troy scratched his crotch, feeling suddenly sweaty and dirty, light gray skin darkening from days spent under the sun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, sure, right.&quot; Troy nodded his massive head, doublechecking to make sure the Book was secure. &quot;I actually borrowed yer-*ahem* <i>your</i> clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You drink water lately, sun addled yer brain or somethin&#39;?&quot; The ogre said, jabbing his thumb at the bench. &quot;My clothes are all there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Troy glanced at the bench, knowing full well they&#39;d be missing, and did a doubletake. The ogre&#39;s clothes were there, clear as day. Troy glanced down at himself and saw his nametag on the vest. He gasped. Was this some kind of reality shift? If so, why weren&#39;t his memories changing too?<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya wanna shower off and hit the hotsprings with me?&quot; The ogre flexed his arms, revealing muscles the size of small beachballs. <br />
<br />
Troy was confused for multiple reasons, but mostly because he thought the ogre was rather handsome-not as handsome as Lancer, of course, but in a rough-and-tumble kind of way. He found himself blushing, cock hardening, imagining himself in a hotsprings with Owen. He swallowed thickly.<br />
<br />
“No, why would I be?” Troy replied.<br />
<br />
“I just figured a Rhox like you might like the soak after a long day’s work.” The ogre winked.<br />
<br />
“Rhox?” Troy asked, desperately trying to ignore the obvious come-on and the accompanying images associated with it. <br />
<br />
“Mystical rhinoceros folk. A normal anthro-Rhinoceros has five fingers. You’ve only got three, so you’re a Rhox.” The ogre furrowed his brow. “How could you not know that? You got heat stroke or somethin&#39;?”<br />
<br />
“I-I&#39;m fine, thanks.” Troy licked his lips with a thick tongue. “I was just wonderin&#39; what me being a Rhox had to do with wanting to soak in a hotsprings. Kinda universal, right?”<br />
<br />
“Heh! I supposed.” The ogre chuckled and rubbed his bald head. &quot;How&#39;d yer day go?&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Oh my god he&#39;s making small talk. This dude is into me!</i><br />
<br />
&quot;I, uh, don&#39;t...know?&quot; Troy shrugged, wondering if memories of this apparently new reality would pop into his head, but none did. That&#39;s how these reality shifts generally went. Dude, if he managed to actually reality shift himself without losing his mind, that would be fuckin&#39; rad! He could tell the answer was too vague, if the ogre&#39;s expression were anything to go by, so he decided to use his imagination. &quot;Just regular old street demolition for that, uh, new...sewer line?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t play dumb, I was talkin&#39; &#39;bout how yer likin&#39; the job so far.&quot; The ogre snorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good! Yeah, totally.&quot; The enormous rhino-man made a chef&#39;s kiss gesture. &quot;Couldn&#39;t ask for better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The pay&#39;s good too.&quot; Owen leaned on the wall.<br />
<br />
<i>Lancer hurry up and save me from my handsome boss who is trying to get in my pants without getting a harassment charge so hard it&#39;s makin&#39; me cringe!</i> <br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmhmm.&quot; Troy nodded and smiled, wide mouth stretching weirdly. &quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay?&quot; The overly-muscled ogre stared at Troy incredulously. &quot;Yer makin&#39; damn near 40 dollars an hour! That&#39;s a helluva lot more than just okay!&quot;<br />
<br />
The ogre put his hands on his hips, glowering tuskily at Troy. His enormous junk swayed between his legs. Troy blushed, gray cheeks darkening to slate, and tried to keep his eyes off it. He covered himself with his meaty hands, trying to conceal his growing erection.<br />
<br />
“What’s the matter?” The ogre smiled. “You like my dick, kid?”<br />
<br />
“Uh, no I-” The huge Rhox stammered.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m just fuckin&#39; with ya, kid!” The ogre slapped Troy on the back. It was a hard blow, but Troy barely felt it. Owen noticed his slap had garnered absolutely zero movement from Troy, not even a flinch, and nodded to himself. “Yeah, I’m thinking we&#39;re gonna get along jus&#39; fine.”<br />
<br />
Owen&#39;s hand crept lower, landing on Troy&#39;s well-muscled ass and squeezed. The ogre turned the blushing rhino man around, making him grip the sink, and pulled down Troy&#39;s dirty jeans, releasing a cloud of the Rhox&#39;s spicy musk. Troy noted he was wearing a jockstrap, which was weird, since there hadn&#39;t been one in the pile when he picked it up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yer hot as hell, kid.&quot; The ogre whispered huskily in Troy&#39;s twitching ear. <br />
<br />
Owen stuck a fat digit in his mouth and probed Troy&#39;s donut gently. Troy moaned, tail lifting out of the way, the animalistic musk increasing. The ogre&#39;s finger worked the Rhox&#39;s hole and Troy found himself bucking back, wanting more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, let&#39;s shower off and hit that spa.&quot; The ogre murmured and softly nibbled on Troy&#39;s ear.<br />
<br />
Troy moaned and allowed himself to be led back to the shower. He found himself being stripped of his clothes. The ogre let the shower warm up and got some soap from his backpack. Troy washed most of the grime from the day off by the time Owen returned.<br />
<br />
Owen had strong, gentle hands, soaping Troy, giving him a scrubbing and a massage, loosening muscles that felt fatigued from a hard day&#39;s work that Troy never actually experienced. The Rhox groaned as the ogre started soaping up his rear, squeezing and rubbing his ass, spreading the cheeks apart, covering his hole in suds.<br />
<br />
The massive rhino put his hands on the wall and arched his back. Being fucked by his boss was so weird, making him feel uncomfortable and turned on at the same time. His tail lifted automatically when the ogre&#39;s hard, throbbing cock circled his entrance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready?&quot; Owen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Won&#39;t the soap hurt?&quot; Troy gulped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, bought it from a sex store. Bubbly Glide.&quot; The ogre pressed his hard member against Troy&#39;s hole.<br />
<br />
Whatever the soap was, it was aptly named. The orge&#39;s humongous cock pierced Troy&#39;s ring. It slid in easily and impaled Troy, filling him utterly. Owen&#39;s delightfully huge cock glided in and out, in and out, each time hitting Troy&#39;s G-Spot.<br />
<br />
The Rhino man moaned, his voice so deep that instead of the needy sound he was used to, instead it sounded like multiple V8 engines. Owen filled him again and again, the Rhox&#39;s cock streaming precum. He could hear Owen grunting with exertion behind him and began to push back, falling into an easy rhythm.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m gonna cum.&quot; Owen whispered, balls slapping Troy&#39;s as he shoved his cock to the hilt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, fuck,&quot; The Rhox wheezed. &quot;I&#39;m really close too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Owen bellowed and shoved his cock as deep as he could and Troy felt it buck, flooding his insides with seeds. The ogre reached around Troy and jerked him to completion, the Rhox&#39;s balls clenched and his thick black rod spewing cum on the shower floor. He panted, still leaning with arms on the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yer a good fuck.&quot; Owen panted, licking sweat off of Troy&#39;s muscles.<br />
<br />
The two stepped back out of the shower and dried off. Owen got dressed, while Troy was stuck staring at his dirty clothes. He considered asking for help, but Lancer was already doing that. So instead, Troy simply listened to the Paladin&#39;s advice and stayed put. <br />
<br />
“There you are!” Another deep voice boomed. <br />
<br />
Lancer stood in the doorway, carrying a bunch of clothes in varying degrees of sizes. Troy realized he must have found something that fit him. He turned back to the ogre and smiled apologetically.<br />
<br />
“Someone stole my stuff and I was waiting here for my friend to get back.” Troy explained.<br />
<br />
“Ah. Plot thickens.” Owen smirked.<br />
<br />
“Didn’t know what size fit you, so.” Lancer smiled. “You okay?”<br />
<br />
Troy nodded and tried on the largest pair, guessing that would be the one. And he was right. He slipped into a muscle-tee and basketball shorts. No footwear, but he wasn’t sure anyone made footwear sized for him anyways.<br />
<br />
“Lookin’ good!” Owen wolf-whistled as Troy examined himself in the mirror. <br />
<br />
He felt a firm pinch on his ass. Owen was standing behind him, a smile on his tusked face.<br />
<br />
Lancer growled and entered Owen&#39;s personal space.<br />
<br />
“Whoa, whoa, calm down kitty cat,” Owen grinned and backed away. “Didn’t know he was already taken.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Indeed.” Lancer turned his attention to Troy. “Our pizza has arrived. They await us. We must go.”<br />
<br />
They started out the door.<br />
<br />
“Hey kid!” Owen called.<br />
<br />
Troy paused and turned. The ogre sauntered over to him.<br />
<br />
“Monday, 5 am.” The ogre handed him a card. “Come to this address and maybe we can have some fun before work.”<br />
<br />
Troy nodded, wondering if he’d ever actually commit to it. A new job, new life. More importantly, people who only knew him as Troy the Rhox. If he even wanted to stay a Rhox. He wasn’t sure if massive rhino-man was his style.</p>
