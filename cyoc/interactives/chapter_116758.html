<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John stood up in a grassy field. There were hills and flowers all around him. In the distance, he saw a woman standing underneath a massive oak tree. When he tried to run towards it, he felt as if the tree came to him. The woman underneath turned around to John. When John tried to speak, he found out that he was mute.<br />
<br />
&quot;John, listen to me. This is only a dream and I do not have much time. I&#39;m the one that created the powers you have. You are immortal and you can manipulate space and matter, which also means you are also able to change your body in any way, limitlessly. With this, I need you to have a child. It&#39;s the only way to break this curse and finally let me rest. Your powers will make you near irresistible to men, and unfortunately they will be irresistible to you as well. But you must overcome that and find a woman. Let me rest, or let somebody else try. You, me, and these powers will never be able to rest until the curse is broken.&quot; John listened intently, but as the dream crashed around him he could not remember.<br />
<br />
John woke up with a start on the floor. He was still lying on a rug, but it was the rug of his own dimly lit apartment. He was still naked, however, and as he curled up he felt himself over, trying to process the previous night&#39;s events. The small flab on his stomach and little trail of hair made John insecure. He didn&#39;t think he looked attractive. Instead of focusing on that, John stood up so it looked better. What John didn&#39;t notice that surely would&#39;ve startled him was how red his cock was. It stood out against his pasty skin, proving that last night really did happen. John instead began to get ready for work: he had to overview an upcoming court case. <br />
<br />
As John began to get a shower ready, he was suddenly hit with a massive migraine that essentially paralyzed him. John fell over and naturally rocked his head. He tried to look down when he realized what was happening. The dream lady was right: the curse was his now. John both saw and felt his cock grow hard and deepen in color. His skin began to darken all over, making him a pasty European to a deeply tanned Latin man. His hair became a lighter black and shortened until there was a small faux hawk on his head. His eyes turned light brown and all his facial features were sharpened, giving him a defined and sexy look. As the changes automatically continued down his body, John&#39;s voice (and therefore his groaing) became deeper until it was a rich baritone that would be pleasant for anyone to listen to. John&#39;s muscles began expanding all over. His flabby stomach disappeared and was replaced by a rounded 6 pack. They seemed natural, giving them a sexier look than sharp muscles. His back muscles swelled up until his shoulders were wider than his hips. His arms ballooned outwards, showing immense strength while also being covered by a smooth layer of rich, brown skin. His pecs grew outwards a little bit and his nipples shrunk down to a more average size. As John&#39;s groans began to soften to moans, he finally looked down at the changes that happened.<br />
&quot;Holy fuck!&quot; he whispered to himself. With his new muscle, he reached out for his throbbing cock and started to stroke it. John&#39;s thighs grew as well, enough to touch each other with pure muscle and make any gym junkie jealous. His legs were also well sculpted just as David&#39;s had been and his feet grew out a little in length. John, however, was more smooth shaven even though he did have a little bit of body hair on his arms and legs. John&#39;s ass was pushed off the ground as it muscled up and rounded out, creating a hot and tight ass that John would have previously been jealous of. John had stroked himself to near orgasm, but his body wouldn&#39;t let him finish. Instead, his modest cock slowly stretched with each stroke. It grew longer and longer, until John put both hands around it and still had room left over. His cock pushed his fingers apart as it thickened to the size of his wrist. John stroked harder and faster until loads of cum spewed out and splashed on the ceiling. Some of it rained back down on John while most of it stuck to the ceiling. John, (who would take the name Jordan to match his body) passed out there again.<br />
<br />
His employers would be upset, but something stopped them from calling John. Jordan dodn&#39;t know it yet, but his life had begun to change around him. Things were about to get so much sweeter for Jordan that it would take decades before he saw the flaws in the curse now had.</p>
