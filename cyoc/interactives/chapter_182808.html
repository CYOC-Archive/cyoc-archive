<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Juliet Renard-Argenté felt she had been making some progress, as the talks with Doctor Jones, and getting the full assurances that the girls she&#39;d raised weren&#39;t out to become strippers or anything of that nature. There was some heightened libido issues, but that was something that was going to be there with Animalians regardless, and even if it wasn&#39;t, after what had happened at the Meat Market, she&#39;d been a bit too embarrassed to really try to put her foot down on the issue. And some of the sessions with Doctor Jones had raised concerns that Juliet might truly have a mild case of Regressive Hypersexuality Disorder that was driving things that related to the romantic desires she privately had, and had been repressing, which had then lead to what had happened at the Meat Market. He&#39;d also provided the encouragement to possibly looking into actually searching for the love and romance that she&#39;d ultimately denied herself now that she&#39;d have a second chance at it as an Animalian.<br />
<br />
However, there was still the issue that related things that the French government wanted on her estate in accordance with the colony for Animalia that was to be established there. They still wanted an adult club there, which still struck Juliet as an excuse to look at naked Animalians, which she didn&#39;t find &quot;romantic.&quot; Yes, Animalians had attractive bodies and yes, they had a higher libido than Humans did, but she still felt that shouldn&#39;t be an excuse to force her or her girls into careers that had plenty of issues with abuse and other issues. She ultimately agreed to allow for an &quot;adult club&quot; on one small section of her property, and requiring major renovations to an old wine cellar that had fallen on disrepair during a few years when the vineyard&#39;s production went down and allowing for those that had already been in the adult entertainment industry to operate the club. Thus while her girls were either going through their lessons that came with adapting to their new abilities as Animalians, and Olympe was training for the IAC, Juliet found herself waiting for the new arrivals at the Lyre/Animalia airport.<br />
<br />
The group that arrived were four women that came in with few bags and were dressed in fairly comfortable clothes that also betrayed the expectation of warmer summer weather. They noticed Juliet waiting for them and approached with knowing smiles, which turned Juliet off a bit. Juliet, however, remained still and kept her eyes focused on the four.<br />
<br />
&quot;So this is the high society fox that decided to try her bit at our profession,&quot; the first commented in French, and with an accent that was clearly from Paris, as she approached Juliet, who only scowled in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let her be, Abella,&quot; the second commented, &quot;the reports say she was drunk at the time. So who knows, she might still be all high and mighty about things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;d still have to bend,&quot; the first, Abella, chuckled, &quot;the legislature and cabinet liked the idea and if she didn&#39;t comply, she&#39;d lose ownership over the vineyard and the licenses to educate children there. And it isn&#39;t like we&#39;d be interrupting either of them, anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Juliet still said nothing as the four approached and eventually came to a stop. She didn&#39;t like that her own government essentially strong-armed her into accepting an idea that she rejected on her own land and her own property. She&#39;d accepted it on the condition that they wouldn&#39;t force her girls into it, and in theory she couldn&#39;t really complain some adults who&#39;d already made a living stripping or doing the can-can were to fulfill that role.<br />
<br />
&quot;My concern was for the freedom of those in my care,&quot; Juliet answered simply, &quot;if such adult entertainment is your wish... that is up to you. You may have to wait for an old wine cellar to be renovated, but between the IAC coming up and likely some remedial adaptations to being an Animalian, you&#39;ll have plenty to keep yourselves occupied until then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; the third of the four spoke as she came forward, &quot;though... with some of the announcements that have come out, some things would sound a bit odd... like running a brothel there as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Juliet groaned at that, as that had been some misstated reports that were given that had come out of her adventure at the Meat Market and what had resulted in accepting these four adult stars as &quot;entertainers&quot; at a separate spot on her property.<br />
<br />
&quot;There will be NO brothel on my land and my chateau,&quot; Juliet said firmly, &quot;after everything this world has been through in the past year, one would think that encouraging careers that can spread disease would not be encouraged. Allowing for you to &quot;entertain&quot; is one thing... turning my family&#39;s vineyard into a prostitution ring is another.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; the third nodded with a more accepting tone of voice, &quot;and you&#39;ll have to forgive some of the teasing. It&#39;s all in good fun and not every day someone of your stature ends up drunk and enjoying herself on a dancing stage. A good many people will have fun with that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Juliet nodded, figuring that a great many people would want to poke fun at the fact that she&#39;d gotten drunk and embarrassed herself. In the meantime, the third woman simply continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Chablis,&quot; the third woman introduced herself, &quot;the one who first addressed you is Abella. The second is Dezirae. The last of our group is Vere.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And all of us have won the attention of adoring fans or at least won the attention of those interested in real fun,&quot; the last of the group, Vere, commented.<br />
<br />
Juliet sighed back, &quot;Just remember that Animalia will have its own rules they have... and there will be a difference between fun, love, things you may personally want... and some drunken lout who knows that as an Animalian you&#39;ll be a D cup at least and hopes your higher libido would make you more open to just having sex with him, regardless of love or whether or not you want to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Chablis nodded, &quot;and were told by those representing the Republic that you would be their representative for France&#39;s Animalian Colony. We&#39;re to then work together to provide for a means of entertainment and assuring that all goes well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And then we&#39;ll all get mates and have fun,&quot; Dezirae laughed and patted Juliet on the shoulder.<br />
<br />
It made Juliet laugh a little bit and relaxed her a bit. The report that her colony would include a &quot;brothel&quot; was a misstatement. Nothing of that nature was to be at her colony. She would have to accept these four running her colony&#39;s version of &quot;the Meat Market,&quot; but there would be no broth and her girls wouldn&#39;t be in danger and neither would these four. If they were to have sex with guests, it would be perfectly willing and because they&#39;d found real love with who that person was. That was at least a positive to take from everything.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... where are your girls now?&quot; Abella asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Olympe is training for either the shock put for the IAC,&quot; Juliet answered, &quot;Fifi and Mia are consulting with apparently an Animalian who was &quot;rescued&quot; from some ring that had been abusing her services as a maid. Eloise has expressed some interest in learning some of Horizon&#39;s scientific work from Judy... who will probably handle your conversions. Josephine has been curious about the work the Browns&#39; do here, which might get her interested in helping run the vineyard, though some of it also might be more family interest than farming. Marie has gone to the groomers with the the Poodle Animalian that provided her with the milk for her conversion and her former pet... something workable since they&#39;ve recently graduated from UNLV and many of the other schools here in America are now starting to let out for the summer. Marie went too... though, I think the cut between a Poodle and a Sheep would be different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to see that everyone has something planned,&quot; Abella chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;And don&#39;t worry, Madame Renard-Argenté, we&#39;ll also make sure that your colony is not brought low,&quot; Chablis promised, &quot;I&#39;ve had experience running a decent club in Paris... and there is the hope that we can work together to assure that we don&#39;t interfere with your education plans or the operation of your family&#39;s vineyard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And there we may work together,&quot; Juliet nodded and shook Chablis&#39;s hand.</p>
