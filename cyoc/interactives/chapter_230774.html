<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stanley was enjoying his fourth week free of his bothersome roommate Ryan. They had been paired in the same dorm room at the beginning of the school year and Stanley was immediately unhappy with the pairing. Ryan was the quintessential dumb rich kid who only got into college because of his family’s money. Stanley would had just ignored the guy if he hadn’t started bullying him into doing his homework for him. This had continued until after their midterms where Ryan hadn’t done so well because he hadn’t done the work or studied for the tests. Ryan disappeared soon after that. Stanley had to report that Ryan had gone missing after he hadn’t returned to their dorm room for two days. Stanley was eventually questioned by the police about the disappearance but was not made a suspect of the investigation. <br />
<br />
Stanley felt guilty at first about enjoying being alone while Ryan was missing but he soon put it to the back of his mind as he focused on his classes.<br />
<br />
Now at the end of the fourth week of Ryan being missing, Stanley was shocked when he was told by the police that Ryan had been found and would be returning to school. A few days later Stanley heard a knock on his dorm room door and he got a feeling it was going to be Ryan. The police hadn’t told Stanley anything about where they found Ryan or what had happened to him so. Stanley assumed the rich kid had gone on some drunken road trip after the bad midterms, and got stuck somewhere with his car broken down. In his mind Stanley saw Ryan returning with a cocky grin on his face about the stupid stunt he had pulled. What greeted Stanley on the other side of the door was decidedly not that. <br />
<br />
In the hallway in front of his door were three people two of them were the police officers that Stanley remembered questioning him about the disappearance and the third was a girl around his age who was sitting in a wheelchair. The first thing he noticed about the girl were her huge breasts that stretched out the T-shirt she was wearing. The second and far more important thing he noticed about her was that she had no arms or legs. <br />
<br />
“Excuse me Stanley I’m detective Deans we talked about a month ago” said one of the officers shifting Stanley’s focus from the girl to them.<br />
<br />
“Oh um yes. I heard that you found Ryan is he ok” asked Stanley trying not to return his attention to the girl who looked embarrassed to be there.<br />
<br />
“Yes well, they are safe and healthy but have experienced some uh changes. Ryan was found in an abandoned lab we suspect belonged to the disgraced geneticist Dr. Morphomanic” answered the officer.<br />
<br />
“Wait was that the doctor who went into hiding after it was discovered that he was testing experimental serums on his lab assistants without their consent” asked Stanley remembering an article that he had read about the incident. <br />
<br />
“That would be the very one. We were not able to capture that mad scientist as they must have fled the scene before we could break in” confirmed the officer. <br />
<br />
“That’s too bad. Well is this another one of his victims” said Stanley indicating the girl in the wheelchair.<br />
<br />
“Actually you probably didn’t recognize them but this is Ryan” said the officer shocking Stanley.<br />
<br />
“Hey roomie, I um I’m back” said the girl in a feminine voice similar enough to Ryan’s that Stanley’s doubt of the girl being the really Ryan turned to horror at how extreme Ryan’s body had been remodeled.<br />
<br />
“Well here are their belongings and we will be leaving them in your care. Good day” said the other officer handing Stanley a large black bag then turned to leave with his partner<br />
<br />
“Wait you can’t just put me in charge of this. Don’t just leave them here” said Stanley panicking as the officers walked off.<br />
<br />
“Not our problem. Take it up with your school’s faculty” Replied the officers before disappearing around a corner. <br />
<br />
“Please Stanley can we just go inside I don’t want to cause a scene out here” said Ryan in an uncharacteristically sad tone. It silenced Stanley’s panic and he complied by wheeling Ryan inside their room. After closing the door there was a moment of awkward silence before Stanley’s curiosity got the better of him and he blurted out<br />
“How did this happen to you and are those real”.<br />
<br />
“Dude did you not listen to the cops. I got kidnapped by a mad scientist. They did this to me and as a matter of fact my breasts are real” answered Ryan in an angry tone Stanley was far more familiar with. <br />
<br />
“I meant how did you get kidnapped and why are you here and not back home with your family” asked Stanley still confused at what was happening. <br />
<br />
“Ugh I don’t know how I got kidnapped, I can’t remember and I’m not home because my stupid dad said he ‘won’t have some stupid bimbo inherit the family fortune’. I have to graduate college or I’ll be disowned from the family. He’s such an asshole” explained Ryan seemingly more mad at his father than concerned about being disowned.<br />
<br />
“And how are you going to graduate from college like that you can’t walk to class you can’t write” said Stanley being a bit rude in his bluntness.<br />
<br />
“Look your smart if you can figure something out and get me through college I will make it worthwhile no more student loans enough money for a house. My family definitely has the money” answered Ryan essentially trying to bribe Stanley for his help which was typical behavior for Ryan.<br />
<br />
“Look that bag that they gave you has some stuff from the mad scientists lab maybe there is something useful in there” continued Ryan indicating the large black bag that Stanley had dragged in with the wheelchair.</p>
