<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sure enough someone eventually showed up with clothing while Alex was drying himself off. He was getting used to people seeing him naked after his day in the back of the wagon, and people wore so little around here he wasn&#39;t conscious of it, especially with his altered body. The clothing dropped off was a pair of boots, a few of the open fronted robes like Marus wore, and a half dozen loincloths. All white embroidered with gold. He guessed that was his assigned color to match the stone at his neck. He had to get the servant to show him how to get the loin cloth fitted, and even then it only barely hid his pendulous cock from sight.<br />
<br />
Dinner was fruit, meat, and some sort of tea that Alex couldn&#39;t identify, but he eagerly ate it up, his stomach growling as soon as the scents hit his nose. Once filled the day came crashing down and he climbed into bed after peeling off the loincloth. The sheets were silken and luxurious. He was beginning to feel like a pampered pet, but he soon drifted off.<br />
<br />
He woke to a clap, sitting up in alarm to look over at Marus. The sun was just rising outside, his room&#39;s balcony over looking the garden allowing in a fair amount of light. &quot;Time for your first training.&quot; Marus set down a tray with fruit, toast, and more of that tea. Alex stood and reached for his loincloth, but Marus shook his head. &quot;Leave it off. We&#39;re going to begin once you eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; Alex said, letting the bit of cloth drop and instead moving over to the chair in front of the food.<br />
<br />
&quot;You do not need to call me sir, Alex. We are technically equals, Marus is fine. But I am instructing you, so for now do as I say.&quot; Marus actually smiled at Alex, who tried to return it around a mouthful of toast. Marus then clapped his hands and two brawny men in their late twenties entered the room.<br />
<br />
Alex immediately noticed the pair were twins. Beefy and brawny, the pair were heavily muscled. Their blond hair was trimmed short, and they both sported well-groomed beards. Curly blond hair covered their heavy pecs, trimmed and groomed. Both wore silver necklaces and red loin cloths. &quot;I thought Lord Florin liked his men smooth.&quot; Alex said looking the two over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lord Florin does.&quot; Marus acknowledged. &quot;But we serve a wide clientele with a variety of tastes. You&#39;ll learn that more than most. This is Jak and Jon, twins that have been with us for ten years now. I noticed you had eyes on some of our burlier brothers yesterday so I thought I might ease you in with these two.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex&#39;s flush and obvious erection was enough to confirm that. Though the brothers smiled at him, offering cheery greetings and welcomes. &quot;I also chose them as we&#39;re going to start by pushing your limits. The sooner we get that stone making some drastic changes the quicker you&#39;ll adapt. Jak and Jon have some.. interesting but compatible fetishes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least he already has a massive cock.&quot; Jak said, nudging Jon.<br />
<br />
&quot;A little scrawny and hairless, though.&quot; Jon said back. The twins both smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Marus said dryly. &quot;Though I want you two also thinking of your more.. exotic appetites.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exotic?&quot; Alex said as he swallowed a piece of fruit, looking worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;That stone is capable of some extreme transformations. We need you bonding and becoming capable of withstanding having your body drastically rearranged in a moment. These two will help with that, you&#39;ll train with them at least once a week. It will also help you get used to being manipulated by multiple desires at once. If you&#39;re finished eating, go lay down.&quot; Marus gestured at the bed.<br />
<br />
Alex gulped down some of the tea and stood, slowly walking over to the bed. Jak and Jon stripped off their loincloths, revealing identical cocks. They would have been large to Alex a day ago, but they didn&#39;t measure up to his own monster. Alex laid back and soon the twins joined him, one on either side. The obviously had a twin routine for their guests, as they started to run their hands over him in unison.<br />
<br />
He felt the same tingle pass through him as when Lord Florin first touched him, and like then the changes started out subtle. His muscles which had grown a bit yesterday suddenly swelled, it was like every muscle in his body flexed and stretched all at once. It wasn&#39;t painful, and in fact it felt good. Like using a muscle too long still. Abs tightened, arms and legs thickened, his chest grew large and round with muscle until he was the same size as the twins. In fact, the twins seemed to have an each other fetish. His skin tanned to the same tone as theirs, and as his body hair grew in it was blond and curly like theirs, rather than his usual black. He even felt the itch of a beard growing in on his face. He just knew if he could see them it would look like a set of identical triplets laying in the bed, though one with a much more impressive cock than the other two.<br />
<br />
&quot;Three way us.&quot; One of the twins said with a deep laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;For now.&quot; The other said, winking.<br />
<br />
Alex furrowed his brow, wondering what was still coming. His chest was still tingling, still growing. His pectorals were growing past what the twins sported, his nipples becoming a larger, more prominent. One of the twins reached up and gave his nipple a squeeze. Something flowed out of them which he eagerly lapped up. Alex arched his back, his nipples were so sensitive, and one of the brothers was now basically nursing from him. Likely whichever caused that change.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lactation fetish.&quot; Marus said from where he observed. &quot;Jak always has a thing for men who&#39;ve just given birth, their nipple swollen and leaking. It&#39;s a fairly common fetish, you&#39;ll likely experience it frequently. Though the grossly enlarged pectorals are an interesting touch.<br />
<br />
Alex felt a tingle below his pectorals as his torso seemed to stretch a bit. With Jack amusing himself with the pillowy lactating pecs, it was no doubt Jon running his hands below Alex&#39; pec&#39;s eagerly. He felt those fingers brush something that sent another quiver through his spine. They felt like.. nipples. But Jon was no wear near.. and then he saw it. A second set of pecs were forming below his first, he could feel the muscles, move them. They were a bit smaller than his upper pair, but the nipples were still large and sensitive. Blond hair grew in along the new pectorals in a repeat of the pattern on his upper chest.<br />
<br />
There were more muscles growing in, more something. He could feel it shifting in his back. Then he flexed with all his strength and a new pair of burly arms grew in in a matter of seconds below his other pair, attached to the new pectorals. He lifted all four hands and stared at them in wonder. He could move each one as easily as he could his original two, alone or together. Jon laughed cheerily. &quot;Ooo.. we don&#39;t get enough four armed clients, I&#39;m going to love having you around on free days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed, a much more peculiar fetish, though interesting when combined with those swollen pectorals. Quite the impressive display.&quot; Marus clapped and the twins backed off, leaving Alex laying on the bed.<br />
<br />
Alex&#39;s cock was hard from all the attention, but he was exhausted and worn out in a way he couldn&#39;t describe. He wanted to cum, but wasn&#39;t sure he had the energy left in him. &quot;I&#39;m.. tired.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marus nodded. &quot;It will be like that with more drastic alterations until you get used to it. As I said, best we start now. We&#39;ll give you some time to rest and I&#39;ll be back in a couple hours with more training. Spend some time getting used to having a body as altered as that one. In a few days we&#39;ll combine the transformations with sex.&quot; Jak and Jon hurriedly put their loincloths back on and left the room.<br />
<br />
Alex managed to sit up, looking at the retreating Marus. &quot;What&#39;s free day?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Once a month Lord Florin gives us a free day, no clients, no duties other than those needed to keep things running. We use it as bonding time, getting to know each other. Many of our brothers pair off for.. fun. I prefer to relax on mine, but sometimes it&#39;s nice to engage in some sex of your own choosing.&quot; Marus watched as Alex slowly stood, adjusting to the odd center of gravity having four arms and a double chest gave him.<br />
<br />
Alex wandered over to his mirror, and sure enough the face staring back at him looked like it belonged to the twins. Short blond hair, a groomed beard, he even looked to be in his late twenties now instead of his actual 22. &quot;I..&quot; He touched his cheeks. &quot;I don&#39;t look like me anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marus shook his head. &quot;No. It would happen eventually, best we get it done with early. Not much about you will be constant anymore. I&#39;ll see if I can find something more traditional for you to practice next. Get some rest.&quot; And with that Marus left.<br />
<br />
Alex reached down and rolled one of his swollen nipples between his fingers, milk leaking out and dribbling over his lower pectoral. He shuddered as his dick leaked in response. He&#39;d call himself a freak if something about his whole form wasn&#39;t so oddly, appealing. But it definitely gave him an idea of the sort of weirdness he&#39;d need to deal with.</p>
