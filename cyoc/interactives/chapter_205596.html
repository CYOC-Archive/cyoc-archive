<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">soon you felt the now familiar sensation of a bright flash and being transported elsewhere. When you came to again you knew for sure that you were once again a diaper, presumably inside of a package as you felt thick but folded up and compacted. Soon there was some commotion as the package was opened up, light began to enter as a hand reached in to grab you. <br />
<br />
“Alright my wittle kit-kat time for bed! But first we gotta get you into these new overnight diapers! Can’t have you leaking during the night again!” You heard a woman say. As your vision slowly adjusted you were set down on a changing table next to a 2 year old girl who was wrapped up in a towel, probably just had a bath. Something seemed familiar about this room but you couldn’t quite place it - you obviously weren’t at Tiffany’s house anywhere. “Wait - did she say kit-kat? That was your nickname when you were little…” you thought. <br />
<br />
The woman soon came back into view and you quickly realized that it was your mother! She looked a lot younger though - big hair and wearing a Motley Crue T-shirt. “So not only did a travel back in time (or stay in the current time as baby Tiffany) but I’m also at my own house and about to be worn by baby me!?!” Your thoughts were interrupted as the mother removed the towel and flipped Katie over and began to apply diaper rash cream to her behind “can’t have my little kit-kat getting a rash now can we?” She said to Katie. Once done she grabbed you and unfolded the diaper while simultaneity flipping Katie back over so that her rear was no on the diaper. You could taste the diaper rash cream and it was not pleasant - but you knew that that was the least of your concerns. Your mother lifted up Katie’s legs and sprinkled some talcum powder before lowering her back down. She then brought you up between Katie’s legs and taped you shut.  <br />
<br />
“There we go, got your diapy all snug, now for your pajamas! It’s gonna be a bit cool tonight!” Your mother said as she dress Katie in a toddler sized pajama shit and pants, which quickly obscured your vision. Katie was the brought over to the crib where she was tucked in, your couldn’t really hear anything now, just some muffled voices and then silence. There was the occasional movement from Katie which caused the diaper to crinkle and it was anything but cool where you were -  it eventually the movement stopped and you could sense that Katie had fallen asleep. <br />
<br />
While you couldn’t sleep you found yourself in a daze - Hours went by with nothing happening.  That is until Katie began to set herself in her sleep. A hot torrent of urine blasted out of her, soaking you in the process but the diaper did it’s job as it eagerly absorbed it, becoming swollen in the process and expanding outward. The taste surprisingly didn’t bother you, kind of tasted like apple juice honestly and the warmth that radiated through you felt kind of nice at first but after a bit it started to cool. You had no idea how much time had passed, it must have been the middle of the night because it seemed like hours went by once again. Katie slept comfortably because she hardly moved the entire night. <br />
<br />
It wasn’t until morning that Katie began to stir. You felt movement as she sat up in her crib.  All was quiet as she pulled her self up and stood in the crib, the diaper now sagging between her legs. You must have done a good job keeping her dry because she seemed at peace with the situation. That peace was short lived however. While holding on to the side of the crib Katie bent her knees slightly and began to grunt. “Oh no! Mom told me once that I used to always poop like clockwork first thing in the morning when I was a baby…” a toot escaped Katie’s anus and soon a turd was pushed out, quickly coiling into the bottom and back of the diaper which caused it to protrude outward. The smell was bad but the taste was worst - this part of being a diaper you did not enjoy.  but Katie wasn’t done - just as she pinched off the poop she began to pee again as well - your swollen body couldn’t handle much more as the diaper tried it’s best to absorb it all. As it pooled in the diaper - The urine now mixing with the poop made for a even more foul taste   The diaper was now bursting at it’s seems and sadly Katie had done quite the number on it as the pooled urine, unable to be absorbed anymore, spilled over the leg guards and began to spill down Katie’s legs. The pajama pants absorbed some of it but some of the urine still found it’s way down to her feet and made for two small wet spots on the crib mattress. <br />
<br />
This proved to be too much for Katie and she began to wail while she stood in the crib. This you could her no problem you feared Katie would lose her balance and fall of her butt - luckily she held on until your other came in the room, quickly lifted her of the crib while trying to calm her, though you couldn’t hear anything she said over her cries. Soon enough you felt Katie placed on the changing table, light shined in as your mother removed her wet pajama pants before tossing them into a hamper. <br />
<br />
Your other came back into view again as she directed her attention back to the task at hand “woah kit-kat! You absolutely soaked this overnight diapy!” She exclaimed while reaching over you and I tapping the left and right tabs of the diaper. “And you pooped!? We gotta change up your night time feeding and drinking schedule! No more baba before bed! But first let’s change this diaper and get you nice and fresh for the day” your mother said. She began the process of wiping up Katie, dropping several wipes into you before pulling you out from under her and quickly rolling you up and taping you shut, placing your swollen diaper body off to the side. “Wowza that thing has got to be a new record” you heard your mom say before proceeding with getting a fresh diaper on Katie. <br />
<br />
Your fate was once again upon you as your mother picked Katie up and rested her on her hip while she grabbed you and causally landed in the diaper pail with Katie’s other dirty diapers. It seemed like you sat her for a good two days, with many more diapers joining you before there was once again a bright flash</p>
