<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake sat in front of the laptop, staring at the screen.  He had so many ideas, he didn&#39;t know which to start with.  He shoved the mouse around a bit until it finally hovered over Ms. Patterson&#39;s name.  He wondered for a moment.  Did he have the right to mess around with her.  Maybe if he did this right they could both be happier.  If he followed the plan in his head though, almost everything about Ms. Patterson would be gone, replaced by someone else.  But was that really so bad?  She was an awful person as far as he was concerned.  What the hell, he could always reverse it if he felt too guilty about it.  He didn&#39;t think he would though.  He clicked on her name, then cringed.  He quickly tossed the corner of his bed sheet over part of the screen, he did not need to see her nude model displayed on his computer.  That was one image that would definitely sear his brain forever.  He scratched his chin as he looked over her stats.<br />
<br />
Name: Maryann Patterson<br />
Gender: Female<br />
Age: 54<br />
Ethnicity: Caucasian(English)<br />
Sexuality: Heterosexual<br />
Height: 5&#39;4&quot;<br />
Weight: 115<br />

Occupation: Bank Teller<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, that was her alright.  He even spent some time peering in the other windows, especially in personality.  If he was to do this right a few things would need to change there, he just needed to make sure all the options were available.  Sure enough, the program was way more in depth about these things, giving an unbelievable amount of fine tuning.  He quickly started changing her general stats, this was going to need pretty much everything to change.  He was going to get rid of the nasty foster mother, and give himself a real parent and a permanent home.  He hovered over gender, thinking for a moment.  Mother or father....<br />
<br />
He had always liked spending time with foster fathers, he just got along better with them.  So father it was.  He was going to change her drastically, might as well go all the way.  A few more adjustments in stats, the name had to go.  He picked the name of one of the foster parents he liked the most and substituted his own last name in.  Real father after all.  A small change to ethnicity.  Jake was Greek and Irish, that was something he had never known, but somehow the program did.  Well, might as well make his father the Greek parent.  Height, weight and build all needed changing too, he was going to have the father he wanted.<br />
<br />
Name: Mark Castellan<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Age: 54<br />
Ethnicity: Caucasian(Greek)<br />
Sexuality: Heterosexual<br />
Height: 6&#39;4&quot;<br />
Weight: 225<br />
Build: Burly<br />
Occupation: Bank Teller<br />
<br />
Jake shook his head.  It was still off, he needed someone he could relate to, share things with.  Younger, with an awesome job, and well.. maybe...  could he do that?  It was possible.  The adjust reality option seemed to work really well, maybe the program could figure out someway to make it work.  A parent he really could talk to, one he really took after.<br />
<br />
Name: Mark Castellan<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Age: 32<br />
Ethnicity: Caucasian(Greek)<br />
Sexuality: Homosexual<br />
Height: 6&#39;4&quot;<br />
Weight: 225<br />
Build: Burly<br />
Occupation: Martial Arts Instructor<br />
<br />
Martial arts instructor was a good choice, give them time to spend together.  The age was iffy, with Jake being 15 that meant he would have been born when his father was about 17, not impossible but maybe it would give them more common ground being closer in age.  And of course, the sexual preference.  That he&#39;d leave up to the reality adjustor to figure out.  As soon as he left the general information box, slider in the other boxes started going crazy, shifting all over the place as the new information took effect.  He nudged a few sliders around a little more.  He couldn&#39;t help but wonder if any of this would change him, linking this new guy as being his biological father.  He snapped his fingers, and dug around looking for family stuff, did the program even have it.. of course it did, it had everything.  He found it eventually, and an option to establish new relation.  It was quick enough to link his own profile as the son of this one, he didn&#39;t see any of the sliders shift, at least on this profile, he wondered if something happened in his but shoved the thought away, any changes would probably be for the better.  He did a few last tweaks, especially in the personality department.  A lot of those had changed just based on his other alterations, already Mark was listed as quite a bit more liberal than Ms. Patterson was, and a whole heck of a lot less.. well.. anal retentive.  He made sure to confirm reality would adjust itself, that was real important, and that the subject would be unaware of any changes.  He didn&#39;t need his new father having memories of being Ms. Patterson.  That would be just... awful.  His cursor was hovered over the button to save changes.  He took a deep breath, one button push and his life would be completely different.  With a silent wish for good luck he pressed it.<br />
<br />
He stood up and headed for his bedroom door.  He wanted to see his masterpiece in action.  He sneaked down the hallway, stopping at the entrance to the living room and peered around the corner.  He had a good view of Ms. Patterson in the chair, but her attention was fixed on the TV set.  Nothing seemed to be happening, he wondered if it was too much for the program.  Maybe he had just changed so much it was taking longer, his own change had been relatively small, this was a full life rewrite.  No, there was something different.  Ms.Patterson&#39;s steel grey bun was darker, turning a deeper shade of black.  Her face was less wrinkled, the lines disappearing as her skin retreated back into youth.  She was fanning herself with her hand, as if there was a sudden warmth, he felt as chilly as ever, she never turned up the heat in winter.  Maybe she passed it off as a hot flash.  Slowly she worked at the belt of her robe, letting it fall open.  And for God&#39;s sake she was naked underneath.  That&#39;s not something he wanted to know about her, he was about to cringe and avert his eyes, but what he actually saw shocked him.  The old wrinkled body he had expected to see was, well, not there.  Sure it wasn&#39;t completely youthful, there were some traces of age, but over all her body seemed to be regressing through the years.  Even her breasts were loosing their sag, raising up fuller and plumper on her chest.  He might not be attracted to women, but he could tell Ms. Patterson was good looking at some point in her life.  Cigarettes and bitterness and been hard on her body.<br />
<br />
She slouched a bit in the chair, her body taking on a new posture, her legs spread right out in front of her, her hand on her stomach.  It wasn&#39;t the demure posture she usually maintained while sitting.  Jake had seen that way of sitting before, usually on a foster father or older foster brother watching TV.  She frowned at the TV for a moment, usually something she did when a news story she didn&#39;t like was on.  She reached for the remote and flipped through the stations.  She stopped at, of all things, an MMA fight, setting the remote back on the side table.  Okay, so age and mental had at least started to take effect.  Her breasts were continuing to return to youthful roundness.  Actually, they looked a bit smaller, the pert nipples shrinking ever so slightly as he watched.  Her bun came undone, the hair falling around her face.  It was shorter now, too short to keep back, and coal black just like Jake&#39;s.  There was a faint darkness to her lower legs and arms, he realized with a start that it was hair, darker and a bit thicker than it was.  Well, of course on her legs, he had never known Ms. Patterson who favored skirts and dressed to be anything but completely shaved on her legs.  Just looking at this one would want to believe the old saying if you shave it off it comes back thicker.<br />
<br />
By now, her nipples had shrunk considerably, sitting lower on her oddly shaped breasts.  No.. not breasts.  The last of the soft suppleness of her breasts had disappeared.  They were still a bit rounded but with the beginning of muscle.  She was starting to look like a very effeminate man.  Jake was so engrossed in watching the changes, he hadn&#39;t noticed other things shifting around the house.  The floral wallpaper in the living room was starting to give way to a dusky blue paint.  Pastel fabrics and lace were slowly shifting into hardwoods and leather.  The house was looking less and less like an old lady lived here, instead becoming more masculine in the decor.  He didn&#39;t even notice the plush carpet beneath his feet turn into solid wood floors.<br />
<br />
Jake was too preoccupied with the physical changes of Ms. Patterson.  Well, not really Ms. Patterson anymore.  There was a small nub of flesh poking up out of her now completely black pubic hair.  She idly scratched at the base of it, shouting something at the TV as one of the fighters took a blow across the face.  Ms. Patterson was quickly being replaced by Mark Castellan.  Even Jake who knew the change was happening was having trouble thinking of her as anyone other than Mark now.  The old memories were still there, but he had to think about it.  There was a fog over it that was slowly filling in with new memories like fireworks.  Just like he knew all his clothes had changed sizes in his closet.  He knew this was Mark, his father.  He could remember Mark setting a bowl of cereal down in front of him just this morning before he went to school.  It was a strange feeling.<br />
<br />
Mark&#39;s feet slid across the wood floors as his legs expanded.  He kept repositioning himself on the couch as his whole body stretched out like taffy.  Jake had added a whole foot to her original height, and he was packing on the new inches quickly.  It made him look oddly stretched, but that was quickly remedied as his shoulders broadened substantially, his chest barreled out as his ribs expanded, and even his waist and hips shifted about.  He was big, but he was still scrawny, Jake knew that would fix itself soon enough.  Along with the rest of his skeleton, Mark&#39;s face was readjusting itself as well.  Soft feminine angles were hardening, growing sharp and angular.  His jaw grew firm and square, his weak chin suddenly jutting outwards.  His small nose pushed out into a slightly curved beak, and his brow thickened with bone.  With a shock, Jake realized he could see himself in Mark&#39;s new features.  The same set of his eyes, the way his mouth curved, even in the structure of his cheek bones.  There would be no way not to look at Mark&#39;s face and his own next to each other and not see the resemblance.  When Mark reached for the glass of wine that had been sitting on the table and it shifted to a bottle of beer as soon as his hand touched it, Jake finally noticed all the changes happening around him.  Photos on the wall were becoming blurry and indistinct, like all of them had been taken with a lens covered in finger prints.  In some of them only the people were blurs and the back grounds were still as clear as they always had been.  Art started shifting around on the walls.  Jake looked away for a minute and when he looked back Mark wasn&#39;t watching the old outdated TV anymore.  It was a brand new flat scree, big and hi-def.  He was stunned.<br />
<br />
Mark had done some growing, too.  His limbs had started packing on muscle, his hands and feet were almost three times as big as they were.  Manicured nails retreated into his hands, leaving the short-trimmed nails most guys kept.  His hair continued its retreat into his scalp, leaving behind only a buzz cut of dark black hair.  The little nub of flesh on his crotch had gotten longer by a couple of inches as well.  It looked ridiculously small on his bigger body, but it was unmistakable as the beginnings of a cock.  He could even make out a small plump sack hanging between Mark&#39;s legs.  Normally Jake would have been completely turned on by the naked male in front of him, but something in his brain was just blocking that.  Any attraction to Mark was instead replaced with a sense of admiration, a feeling of wanted to be like that when he finally reached adulthood.  It was love, but of a different sort.<br />
<br />
His limbs had grown by leaps and bounds, veins visibly snaking their way up his arms and along his muscles, his legs as well.  Jake could see the muscle in them even from this far back.  Suddenly his torso popped with muscle, his pectorals ballooned outwards as if inflated by a pump, his stomach likewise suddenly popped with new muscle.  There wasn&#39;t much definition, it was mostly just pure bulk, maybe with even a thin layer of fate over the muscle.  It looked like muscle earned by simply being genetically inclined and performing a lot of physical labor rather then the cut and defined musculature of a body builder.  It made him seem more real, more natural.  Like a wall rather than a statue.  It fit him.<br />
<br />
Hair had continued to grow in along Mark&#39;s arms and legs, thick and dark.  Jake idly scratched at his arms as he looked at it, and as Mark stretched he could even see dark tufts forming under his arms.  Jake silently hoped he hadn&#39;t nudged the body hair slider too far.  What he might have nudged to far was the penis slider.  It had continued to grow, and was creeping past average right into well hung territory.  It laid along his thigh like a flesh toned banana.  Mark reached down as scratched at the pair of hairy golf balls between his legs.  Jake had never seen a foreskin on an actual penis before, it was.. different.  He kind of liked it.  Mark&#39;s cock and balls gave out one last jump in size and Jake silently chided himself for being so childish as to make Mark&#39;s cock size that large.  His eyebrows suddenly thickened, the slender arches turning into thick dark brush strokes over his blue eyes.  Eyes the exact same color as Jake&#39;s.  A five o&#39;clock shadow formed along Mark&#39;s jaw, spreading up his cheeks and along his chin, and under his jaw, stopping as it reached his neck.  The sideburns grew in a bit thicker, down past his ear lobes.  Hair was starting to grow along Mark&#39;s hard torso.  A strip of black hair growing along his abdomen like a wave.  When it reached his pectorals the wave broke, fanning outwards and upwards along the twin globes of muscle, stopping as it reached his collar bone.  It was dense and dark, trimmed but not shaved off, as if to say I&#39;m a man and men have hair, that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t groom myself though.<br />
<br />
Jake itched just looking at all that body hair, he reached under his shirt and scratched at his stomach, his fingers meeting something he hadn&#39;t expected.  He grabbed his shirt and lifted it up higher.  A line of dark hair grew up from under the waist band of his pants towards his belly button.  He tugged it up further and even say just the faintest traces of hair darkening in the middle of his chest.  Even his arm had a bit more than before.  It looked like he couldn&#39;t alter his biological father without giving himself a bit of a makeover, genetics being what they are.  At least if reality needs to adjust.  Did that mean...<br />
<br />
Jake quickly undid the fly on his pants, tugging it down far enough to let his cock flop free.  It was a good three inches longer than it had been, and his balls felt practically ponderous at their new size.  Maybe messing with that penis slider wasn&#39;t so bad.  What surprised him the most was the foreskin that now covered his cock.  It seemed an odd adjustment, but he quickly pulled his pants back up as he felt himself stiffening.  He didn&#39;t want to be caught in the hallway jerking it by his father.  Jake gave a start.  He had thought of Mark as his father like it was the most natural thing in the world.  If he didn&#39;t concentrate, those new memories just crept up on him, laying out a whole new history for him.  The pictures on the walls had even refocused themselves, now showing him or Mark.  He could even remember most of those being taken, except for the ones where he was really young.  There were even baby pictures.  He had never seen a baby picture of himself before.<br />
<br />
He stepped closer to one on the wall.  It looked like him holding a baby.  Well, a slightly older him.  No, the nose was wrong.  That&#39;s right, he made it so he was born when his father was 17, only a couple years older than he himself was now.  It was so much easier to see the similarities between him and his new father when he could see him so young.  And that made the baby him.  Young Mark actually looked happy holding that squirming baby.  And a dark haired woman stood at his shoulder.  His mind identified her right away as his grandma.  Of course, giving himself a father, he would have gotten a whole family in the mix.  He didn&#39;t see any of himself with someone he identified as his mother.  In fact, his new memories couldn&#39;t even pull up a face.<br />
<br />
He looked back into the living room.  A full grown Mark was there, he had stood up and was stretching out, as if breaking in the new body.  He was also completely naked, which made Jake blush a bit.  He felt the need to talk to him, see just how much reality had changed around him.  He stepped into the living room, intending to say the man&#39;s name, instead he said, &quot;Dad?&quot;  It felt so odd to be calling someone that, but at the same time, so comfortable.  He turned around, grinning as he saw Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey sport, what&#39;s up?&quot;  Mark&#39;s voice was a smooth baritone, much more pleasant to hear than Ms. Patterson&#39;s scratchy voice.  He set his hands on his hips, looking for all the world like standing naked in front of your son was perfectly natural.  But Mark also had the type of body that demanded to show off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, you&#39;re... uh..&quot;  Jake directed his gaze to the floor.<br />
<br />
He heard his father laugh, and looked up to see him grab his robe off the couch and pull it on, quickly tying the belt.  It wasn&#39;t the pink fluffy thing it had been before.  It was simple, thin cotton, dark black.  It still showed off the swell of his chest muscles, and if he wasn&#39;t careful, still flashed off what was between his legs.  &quot;Nothing you haven&#39;t seen at the showers when you come with me to the gym, and still can&#39;t stand it around the house.&quot;  He made a small sigh, but it sounded fond rather than annoyed.  He sat back down on the chair as Jake made his way over to the couch.<br />
<br />
Okay, time to put the new reality to the test.  &quot;Can I ask you about, uh, my mother?  I mean, aren&#39;t you.. don&#39;t you..&quot;  Time to see if it took.  &quot;Like men?&quot;<br />
<br />
For a moment, his father looked thoughtful arching his brow at the stumble, then laughed.  &quot;I wondered when you were finally going to ask me that.  Surprised it took you this long.&quot;  He leaned back in the chair.  &quot;Well, fifteen years ago, I was confused.  Being gay was even less accepted than it is now.  And I had no one to talk to about it.  I, well, I slept around with some girls, thinking maybe I&#39;d get used to it.&quot;  He shook his head, &quot;Never did.  But one of those times worked.  Your mother wanted to give you up.  You grandmother and I pushed my paternal rights and asked for custody.  It was easy enough with a grandmother willing to take care of you until I was old enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake was impressed.  The program had come through.  &quot;How did you know you were gay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark arched an eyebrow, Jake was quickly learning he always did that at an unexpected question.  &quot;Just did, why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there&#39;s a guy at school I like, and I was trying to figure out if I liked him of liked liked him..&quot;  Not really true, but he had to test it out, right?<br />
<br />
Mark just reached over and clapped him on the shoulder.  &quot;Well, make sure about him before you ask him anything.  High schoolers can be nasty.  But you know how to take care of yourself, I know you know that much.&quot;  And he did, he had lots of memories of his father teaching him martial arts.  What shocked Jake more was he just came out to his father, and he acted like it was completely normal.  It had worked.  The whole damn plan had worked.  &quot;You eat yet?  Let&#39;s order pizza.&quot;  He grabbed the phone and started dialing even before Jake answered.  He was too stunned to say anything anyway.  But sure enough he wanted to talk to his father over a pizza.  But this worked so well it gave the other ideas in his mind more weight, and his thoughts kept wandering back to his laptop.</p>
