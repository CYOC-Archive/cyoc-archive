<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As soon as Shane got to work he let out a groan. The place was packed. Not only was there the usual Friday night madness but there seemed to have been some middle school or little league games this afternoon. Tons of kids running around all over the place, screaming and making a fit, and they looked backed up. As soon as he was clocked in he got thrown on the line, flipping burgers, just in time to give the previous cook his lunch break. That left him on the line with Luke. The Luke he fantasized about bending over and plowing that morning. Luke who was the supervisor for the shift. Shane had been intending to mess around with Luke using the Chronivac, but the place was just too busy.<br />
<br />
A couple hours later and the place had begun to calm down, a few other big groups had come and gone, but they had some breathing room for now. &quot;Shane, grab a sandwich and take your dinner break.&quot;  Luke motioned to the heat tray with the wrapped burgers, nodding him on his way.<br />
<br />
Shane grabbed something, not really paying attention to what. He was hungry enough to shove anything in his mouth at this point and headed out to the dining room to find a table to camp out at for thirty minutes. Sadly, Luke stayed on the line and Shane couldn&#39;t see him from where he was sitting, and he wasn&#39;t about to alter him without being able to watch it. He still needed to figure out a way to do it without any clothes on Luke to block the view, either. He pulled out his phone and started scrolling through it. None of the names stood out, as he didn&#39;t know anyone, but he found an option for pictures next to the profiles. He chewed on his burger as he looked at the list, waiting for inspiration to hit.  It came in the form of a shrill screech coming from up at the counter.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said grilled chicken! This is fried!&quot; The woman up at the counter slammed her sandwich down, sending a spread of ingredients across the surface.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, ma&#39;am. We&#39;ll remake that for..&quot; Luke was out from the line, trying to settle things once he heard the customer start shrieking. The woman was actually a regular and always looked for a way to make problems. Unfortunately, she usually got away with it because her husband was the town sheriff, so calling the cops on her would have been pointless.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this even diet?&quot; She held up her small soda. &quot;Remake the whole thing, and give me a refund.&quot; She actually pulled the lid off her soda and dumped it all over the counter on top of the smashed sandwich. The more times she had been allowed to get away with her tantrums the worse they got. Shane supposed she was attractive, raven black hair pulled back into a ponytail, mid-thirties, she came in once a week in a sports bra and lycra shorts after her jog around the nearby park to order the same thing, grilled chicken sandwich and a small diet coke. She called it her cheat treat. Shane couldn&#39;t help but roll his eyes.<br />
<br />
She was the perfect target. He brought her up on the Chronivac:<br />
<br />
Name: Karen Fitzpatrick<br />
Age: 37<br />
Gender: Female<br />
Ethnicity: Caucasian<br />
Height: 5&#39;8&quot;<br />
Weight 125lbs<br />
Build: Slim<br />
Status: Married (Colin Fitzpatrick)<br />
Sexual Preference: Heterosexual<br />
Breast size: C cup<br />
Occupation: Stay at home wife<br />
<br />
&#39;Of course her name is Karen, and she probably never worked a day in her life. Probably skated by on her looks until she found a guy stupid enough to take care of her&#39;, Shane thought to himself. But what to do with her? All sorts of thoughts ran through his head. Turn her back into a kid so maybe she grows up right. Turn her into a teen employee here at the restaurant so she has to clean up her own mess. None of that would have felt right though, unless he wanted her freaking out in the middle of the dining room he&#39;d have to alter reality and leave her unaware, and that&#39;d just be punishing some new person for what she did.<br />
<br />
Luckily, Luke was being a bit spiteful and taking his time remaking her food, giving Shane plenty of time to swap things around. Much better to make her someone useful. He looked over his work:<br />
<br />
Name: James Lawson<br />
Age: 27<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Ethnicity: Caucasian<br />
Height: 6&#39;2&quot;<br />
Weight 200lbs<br />
Build: Athletic<br />
Hairiness: Somewhat heavy<br />
Status: Single<br />
Sexual Preference: Homosexual (Bottom)<br />
Penis size: 4&quot; soft, 6&quot; erect<br />
Occupation: Sheriff Deputy<br />
<br />
Perfect. Deputy Lawson wouldn&#39;t realize he was being punished in some ways, forced to work for the man that used to be his husband. Furry, gay, and exclusively a bottom, something he was sure Karen would find absolutely horrifying. Though James would probably enjoy every minute of it. Except maybe the puns he&#39;d have to put up with being a cop with the last name Lawson. &#39;Maybe there&#39;ll be a little bit of Karen in there for a while that would realize she shouldn&#39;t have been such a bitch,&#39; Shane thought as he pressed the button to start the change.<br />
<br />
Luckily, Karen&#39;s skimpy workout outfit gave Shane the perfect view of the changes coming over her. Karen had quite ample breasts for her body type, maybe they weren&#39;t even completely real, but even the compression of the sports bra couldn&#39;t do much to hide them. That was quickly changing, her breasts were deflating, the twin mounds flattening out. Only the slight line of her chest muscles giving any indication she had a chest at all. But it seemed the Chronivac was handling the biggest change first, because as those mounds were shrinking, another was growing. Shane&#39;s eyes were pulled to it when Karen reached down to adjust herself. The front of her tight shorts were bulging out. But Karen was wearing women&#39;s shorts, so there was no pouch to fill, instead the growing cock pulled the waist band down a couple inches as the sudden growth of her new dick pushed the fabric away from her body. Shane could clearly see the outline of her new cock through the stretched fabric, no one else seemed to notice though, acting like it was business as usual. In fact, Shane could swear the fabric was stretched enough he could see the start of that shaft. Shane had given her a rather average one though, so it still managed to stay mostly concealed. Karen was still fuming, but Shane noticed the mess was just suddenly gone. Deputy Lawson wouldn&#39;t have done that, so it was gone as if it never happened.<br />
<br />
Just like that, Karen was male, albeit a very slim and effeminate one. Height quickly started trickling onto her frame though, Karen wasn&#39;t short, but James was going to be on the tall side, and even those six inches made a noticeable difference. Most of it was in her legs, but Shane swore he could see her stomach stretch out as a couple of inches added onto her torso. Her hands slid lower as her arms lengthened, as her hands themselves went from long and slender to, large and thick, the expensive French tips dulling to plain short finger nails. He couldn&#39;t see her feet, but those pink sneakers turned to black as they suddenly expanded to what looked like size twelves. The stretchy fabric of her sports bra was keeping up even as her shoulders and rib cage expanded slightly. Even her stance changed, Karen shuffling her feet to adjust as he hips altered.<br />
<br />
Shane though the women&#39;s workout clothes on this now, very obviously masculine body was a bit humorous, he wanted a picture but was sure the Chronivac would just change it as it altered everything else. That sports bra, once so burdened, suddenly began to fill again., to rounded plate of muscle suddenly filling out the spot where breasts used to be. In fact, muscle was growing everywhere. The back of the shorts filled out as Karen&#39;s somewhat flat ass filled out with firm, rounded glutes. The smooth skin of her exposed upper arms creased as the muscles below swelled and expanded, definition coming in with remarkable speed, echoed beneath the too taught fabric of her shorts. Though those were bunching up above her swelling quads, leaving almost all of her legs exposed. Her exposed stomach showed off a clear six pack and Adonis belt. She now had the body of a man that clearly hit the gym almost every day and knew how to use the machines, not as ripped as Shane, but still extremely fit.<br />
<br />
Shane hadn&#39;t noticed her face altering though, not only in appearance but in countenance. Sour Karen&#39;s face was almost gone at this point. There was something of her left there, this could have been a half-brother or a cousin, but he had thick, heavy, expressive brows, a broad nose, and a strong jaw. He was good looking in that boy-next-door sort of way. More importantly, the sour, angry expression was gone. He actually wore a slight smile, and it fit his face well. There was something almost canine about him, it was a face you could trust, and it looked like he could pull off the puppy-dog begging eyes with aplomb.<br />
<br />
Shane was looking at those lips, as he noticed the skin around it starting to darken.. no.. that was the start of a beard growing in on his upper lip and chin, his long black ponytail was quickly pulling back into his scalp at a frenzied pace, and at the waistband of his shorts a thick black pubic bush was growing in. Forearms and shins were suddenly sprouting curly, dark hair as well. It was hard to keep up with it, as it seemed to be growing in everywhere all at once. It was a practical flood of black curls growing upwards and spreading out along Karen&#39;s, no, James&#39; stomach. Every inch of that six pack covered in a softening layer of dark fur. It hid the definition a little, but Shame wanted to run his fingers through it. The growth on James&#39; chest was hidden by that sports bra, and Shane just wished it would go away, and as if god heard him, it did.<br />
<br />
The material of the bra turned from a purple spandex to a dark cotton as it suddenly changed into a tank top. The bottom dropped down, hiding those furry abs, but the neck suddenly scooped low enough to show of the twin expanses of his pectorals covered in a thick layer of dark hair that stopped just around his collar bone. James&#39; shorts, too, shifted into men&#39;s lycra running shorts. Still tight, but the bottoms slipped down over his fuzzy thighs. Suddenly, a badge appeared clipped to the waistband of those shorts. As the hair on his head settled into a cop&#39;s high and tight, the shadow on his jaw pushed out into a very short but neatly groomed beard, trimmed to accentuate his jaw line. Then Shane saw that slight grin break into a beaming smile.<br />
<br />
Luke had come out from the back with a bag and a drink to hold out to James. &quot;Here you are. One double burger with cheese, and large coffee, two creams. Sorry about the wait, we got slammed and didn&#39;t have a chance to brew a fresh pot.&quot;<br />
<br />
And then words that probably never passed Karen&#39;s lips came from the mouth of Deputy James Lawson. &quot;No worries.&quot; And he sounded like he meant it. &quot;I&#39;ve got night shift tonight, I&#39;m going to need all the coffee I can get.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll tell night shift to keep a fresh pot going, we&#39;ll let you get your free refills like usual.&quot; Luke was smiling right back at the officer, and Shane actually felt a little spike of.. jealousy? Was Luke flirting with the deputy? He shook his head. Nah.. that was just customer service. He watched Deputy Lawson as he left, especially the way that ass of his filled out those shorts. Once James was out of sight, Shane checked his phone and the time..</p>
