<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie glanced over at her friend as the two teens now entered Katie’s home. The Samoan girl was still dreamily talking of a possible future with her boyfriend, a conversation that was gradually wearing down Katie’s patience. “I get it Sammy,” Katie sighed. “It was a beautiful ceremony and it was super weird seeing our doppelgängers but we need to focus now.”<br />
<br />
“How can you focus Katie,” Samantha stated. “I mean you saw the wedding. It was beautiful, it makes you wonder if our weddings will look like that someday.”<br />
<br />
“It will have to wait Sammy,” Katie sighed. “This is serious, we don’t have time to focus on weddings or what our doppelgängers do or did.”<br />
<br />
Samantha frowned at her friend, Katie didn’t understand. Samantha’s had watched herself get married to her boyfriend. True, it was an alternate timeline, with an alternate future. The things their doppelgängers experiences may never happen to them. Samantha for one had no intention of getting pregnant as soon as the other Samantha had. Katie just didn’t understand what that experience had been like. Samantha though, had a comeback. “Let’s see how you feel when your doppelgänger gets married in the winter,” she grumbled.<br />
<br />
Katie paused, unable to voice a suitable response. Samantha was right, her doppelgänger would be getting married soon. Katie and the others would most certainly attend but Katie wondered, how would she react to seeing her doppelgänger tie the knot with another version of Kellie. Shaking the thought from her head she now took a deep breath as she gazed at Samantha. “We’ll talk about it later Sammy,” she said. “Right now I need you to focus. This is serious, if your going to have magic you have to be able to focus.”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Samantha sighed. As the teens now headed to Katie’s room they tried to focus on the task at hand. “Now Sammy,” Katie said. “What I want you to do when you cast a spell is focus. You need to concentrate on what you want to do. Mold the magic to fit the picture of what you have in your mind.”<br />
<br />
“Got it,” Samantha stated. “But what kind of spell should I cast?”<br />
<br />
“Your decision,” Katie shrugged. “Your magic is a bit different from mine. I can control anything temporal. Age, memories, reality. You on the other hand can use other spells. You just have to focus.”<br />
<br />
Samantha nodded, taking a deep breath she gazed at the pendant in her hand. She knew she could do this, yet her mind was fuzzy. She was still preoccupied with ideas of weddings, dresses, the cake. Grimacing she tried to focus on a spell, yet the only thing she could picture was her own wedding cake. A cake topped with a Samoan bride and a groom she could swear looked just like her Mike. Shifting in place the girl opened her eyes looking at Katie, only to find her perception seemed off. “Katie are you wearing heels?”<br />
<br />
Katie had closed her eyes, trying to stay as quiet as possible as Samantha cast her spell. After being transformed into a rabbit, she had not wanted to watch this latest transformation. Now opening her eyes curiously she gasped as she gazed at her friend. “Sammy your shrinking!”<br />
<br />
Samantha’s eyes bulged as she now looked herself over. The teens clothing appeared slightly baggy on her frame as she slowly grew smaller. The formerly six foot tall teen now found herself about four inches shorter and still shrinking. “Crap, Crap, Crap,” Samantha stated as she tried to focus. Unfortunately the teen was still growing smaller. For a moment Samantha found herself eye to eye with her friend before slowly growing smaller. “Sammy you gotta focus,” Katie exclaimed as she watched her friend go from 5’7” to 5’6”. <br />
<br />
“Easier said than done,” Samantha grumbled as she now found herself an inch shorter than her friend and quickly speeding towards two. “I’ve been trying to stop it but it won’t quit.”<br />
<br />
Katie nodded as Samantha continued to grow smaller. The formerly Amazonian teen now found herself hovering around 5’2” and still shrinking. Samantha clutched her once form fitting clothing to her rapidly diminishing body as she sped towards 5 foot. “Okay Sammy,” Katie stated. “I’m gonna try to help you but, first you have to tell me what you were thinking about.”<br />
<br />
“I wasn’t thinking about anything,” Sammy exclaimed, wincing as she noticed her voice rise several octaves. “I didn’t even try to cast a spell.”<br />
<br />
Katie exhaled as she gazed at her rapidly shrinking friend. Samantha was now only about 5 feet tall and still shrinking. The Samoan teen was fruitlessly trying to reposition her increasingly cumbersome clothing as she dwindled. Already Katie could see the teens bra straps sliding down her diminutive shoulders as she tried to adjust herself. As Samantha shrank below 5 foot her shorts finally lost hold of her hips, cascading down her legs. Samantha let out a squeak as she now clung to her loose panties, trying to maintain some semblance of modesty. “Sammy think,” Katie implored. “Think. What exactly were you thinking about? I can’t counter the spell unless you tell me,”<br />
<br />
Samantha groaned in frustration, kicking away her too large shorts (and in the process causing her loose sneakers to fly off her shrinking feet). Samantha now racked her brain, clinging to her clothing as she now shrank down to four and a half feet tall. What had she been thinking of? Like a bolt of lightning it finally hit her. “Ugh I’m an idiot.”<br />
<br />
“What Sammy,” Katie asked. <br />
<br />
Samantha blushed as she continued to shrink, the teens shoulder now poking through the neck hole of her shirt. “This is kinda embarrassing,” she squeaked. “But, um...I was kinda thinking about what my wedding cake would look like. Specifically, the cake topper.”<br />
<br />
Katie’s eyes bulged before she stifled a laugh. Samantha had inadvertently cast a spell to turn her into a living breathing cake topper. “It’s not that funny,” Samantha whined as she now became 4 feet tall.<br />
<br />
“It’s kind of funny,” Katie said sheepishly. “I told you to focus. Instead you literally turned yourself into a cake topper. You do realize those things are only about 3 or 4 inches tall.”<br />
<br />
“Well can you fix this,” Samantha exclaimed as she shrank down to 3’11”. “In case you haven’t noticed my clothes aren’t shrinking with me and you got rid of your dolls years ago.”<br />
<br />
Katie chuckled, mussing her friends hair as the now 3’9” Samoan teen glared up at her. “I think I can Sammy,” she smirked. “But for future reference, next time I see focus. Try not to think about anything but magic.”</p>
