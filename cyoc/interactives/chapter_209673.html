<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">But Johnny´s hope was crushed when Mike and Sei went past him and the gargoyle, ignoring the naked statue of their friend’s younger brother completely. A couple of minutes in silence later, they both return to move back inside, ignoring him again. They just talked about him as they went past him and the gargoyle, and not in a positive way. Johnny hadn´t known they disliked him for being younger than them. That he was Ryan´s brother was the reason he went with them sometimes, as Ryan had taken him with them. Thy thought he was annoying, lazy, and overall, not as fit as them. He cried mentally after them.<br />
“They aren´t that nice now, if they don´t know you hear them, are they?” the gargoyle said quietly, and Johnny wasn´t sure if he pitied him for his “friends” or was laughing inside. “Maybe I should punish them as well.” It said next.<br />
Johnny was both surprised and fearful for that. Positively surprised that his captor would do something for him, but fearing for his “friends” and, more important, his brother. What if the gargoyle trapped him along the others?<br />
“Well, it will take a bit to break free for me, and I don´t fancy being a little boy, but it won´t be for long. I will just have to combinate your aspects after I have them all.” The gargoyle said before laughing somewhat evilly, making Johnny´s stone skin crawl and his bones shiver. What did it mean, breaking free? Was it human once, as well? If so, had it gone mad prisoned like this?<br />
As Johnny was forced to watch the gargoyle, its skin started to ripple slowly, before like the water that had petrified himself, grey like stone, flowed down its body. And soon after, the water pooled around Johnny and started to climb up his body, who only felt the cold liquid on his stone skin. He couldn´t see what was happening, his gaze being forced to watch the gargoyle before him change instead.<br />
Not that there was much to see beside the flowing of grey water, obscuring all the gargoyles features by now. The only thing obvious visible were the slowly vanishing wings behind it, shrinking away.<br />
Johnny himself could feel his body begun to change, but it was too vague to say what happened to him clearly. And so, unseen by himself, Johnny changed.<br />
His feet had been submerged in the water for a few minutes by now, but beneath the water they had already deformed. His toes had merged down from five to three, all bigger than before, and with wicked long, sharp claws sprouting out of their tips. The feet overall had stretched longer and wider, gaining another claw at the heel each, which now was slightly raised up in position.<br />
The climbing water had thickened Johnny´s legs, nearly doubling their size with stoned muscles. It also added a bit of length to them, which Johnny couldn´t notice, as right now they had bent to compensate his raising high. To him, all this made him feel rather heavy, but that was all. Had he been flesh, he would have screamed from all the rearranging that happened to his bones and the stretching his flesh would have done.<br />
But so, the water climbed higher, changing more of his body. His ass had become slightly bigger and rounder, but the real change was the tail that grew just above it. It was the first addition Johnny could “feel” of his body, as it sent a new signal through his stone body. Like a snake, an at first small, then getting bigger and wider, appendage wormed its way behind him. Or better, just grew out of nothing as the stony water created it, letting it grow down in a curve before going up, the tip way above his head. The tip was still as wide as his arm was right now, still left unchanged, while the base of it was as wide as his powerful legs were. If someone would place a foot at its tip, you could substitute it for a third leg instead, if it wasn´t much longer than the other two.<br />
On his front, his relatively small cock and balls were also affected by the water. While his balls vanished from sight, as his growing legs and nether-regions hid them well, his cock grew a bit more, becoming good six inches long. His balls, if they were visible, also had swelled to at least twice their size, making Johnny feel a pressure he never felt before in it.<br />
His body overall swelled bigger, gaining him a six-pack of stony muscles, and giving him another boost in his height. This time, Johnny could take notice, as he suddenly was above the gargoyle´s high, but from his point of view, the gargoyle had just shrunken away.<br />
And that was true, after all. The former gargoyle, by now, was at least two feet smaller than at the beginning, had lost his wings and tail completely. His overall look was nearly human shaped by now. It was still hard to really see his form, but the water slowed, showing he was near done changing.<br />
Johnny´s arms swelled with muscles as the water run down over them. Their shape was twice as thick as before, around the same size as his legs had become. His hands remained in their shape, but grew in size and length. His fingers had thickened as well, and were now ending in just as wicked and sharp claws as his toes did.<br />
Another addition Johnny could clearly “feel” on his body was the set of wings slowly growing out of the stone on his back. It would have him topple over backwards from the weight alone, or pushed him flat on his front, with no hope of getting up under them. From his shoulders they arced up and back, standing wide open behind him. The frame was just as thick as his arms and legs were by now, “showing” strong muscles to fly. The highest tips were about the same high as his tail tip between them, and still a bit above his head. And down from there, they ended about the height of his knees, if he had been standing straight, giving them about six feet in height. The membrane between the frame was still as thick as his fingers had been before. In width they spanned nearly five feet, as well. Would he be able to move, he could theoretically be able to cocoon himself in his new wings easily. <br />
By now Johnny could only see the former gargoyle at the corner of his eyes, still looking straight on, far above the others head. His changes had finished, leaving him a replica of what Johnny had looked before, maybe a couple inches bigger. And while Johnny had felt embarrassed of being naked, the former gargoyle had no such claims, long gone form such pathetic problems. The last to change for him was the receding stone forming his skin, slowly becoming looking like a naked human, not a statue.<br />
Johnny was blinded as the water flowed over his head and therefore his eyes. His inner panic was raising to new highs, thinking he would be trapped in eternal darkness and silence now, as his ears also couldn´t hear anything anymore. <br />
But it was only deforming his face and head. His slightly open mouth fell more open, exposing his by now sharp, long teeth. It also had slightly pushed out, forming a small snout-like muzzle, which also eradicated his nose, merging into it. His ears were flatter to his now bald head, his hair smoothed away by the water, but also slightly bigger than before. His eye-sockets were bigger, which in turn let his eyes be bigger, widening his sight after the water receded. His head was finished when a set of horns had grown out, each as long as his fingers together with their new claws, aligning the tips to his wings and tail-tip. <br />
As the water vanished, Johnny could be seen as a near replica of the former gargoyle, only his demeanor not threatening, instead more fearful. And in a far less imposing position, covering like he did right now.<br />
“Finally free to move again on my own” the new Johnny said, in a tone far darker than the former would ever have used. Looking up to the now gargoyle Johnny, he grinned evilly. “Maybe in a few years, you will be able to move and learn to control your body, but for right now, oh ugly one, you can´t. But with the powers I learned while being a gargoyle, I can order you around. You see, I learned to control stone, and right now, you are just that, stone.” The human laughed.<br />
Johnny, now able to see the thief of his form by his wider field of vision, was mentally pleading him to be changed back. If he could right now, he would ask if the gargoyle had wanted to be his twin brother, if only he could be human alongside him. He was shocked out of his pleas when his body finally moved, ordered so by “Johnny”.<br />
“Let´s see, you are my replacement, meaning you need to be in my spot over there.” The kid said, pointing to his original spot. Without any other prodding, the newly made gargoyle moved slowly, careful not to hurt his “master”, who controlled his movements. Reaching the spot, it took his old pose of covering, much to the former’s amusement. Suddenly, Johnny had an image of how he looked right now in his head. Somehow, the thief had sent it to him.<br />
“No, no, dumb ugly hunk of stone, not such a pathetic pose. You need to look fierce, bad and brutal, not submissive and fearful. Stand straight, proudly showing of your claws and teeth, ready to jump down and hunt your prey.” He instructed further, and the gargoyle Johnny complied to them.<br />
The pose Johnny took was as far from his inner turmoil as the sun. He was never predatory or brutal, and the way his face formed into an ugly snarl was just wrong to him. But he had no control, no way of changing anything.<br />
After the now living boy had corrected everything that he felt was wrong about the new gargoyle, he finally turned away. “I will bring your friends here, and then make them other, ugly creatures to join you. So, don´t worry, you won´t be alone for long.” Laughing, the former gargoyle left, intending on finding the other´s. <br />
And all Johnny could do was watch him go, his pleas to don´t hurt them remaining within his stone prison that was his changed body. A second picture of himself had him crying even more. There was nothing to identify him for others anymore.</p>
