<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day, John went over to pick up Kylie at her house in order to &quot;help her figure out what is happening&quot;. Not that he had any intentions on telling her yet. After knocking on her foor, he was let in by her mother and showed to her room. Kylie was in the bathroom at the moment, but her mom said you could just wait in her room for her. <br />
<br />
Apparently reality really did quite the number on her life as her room was now clearly designed for a young women&#39;s use. An entire wall had been built to expand the once small corner closet to become a full sized walk in, with numerous skirts, dresses, high heels, stylish boots, etc... neatly stored inside. Most had a rather elegant appearance, or at least were not showing any of the usual signs of ware and tear from years of useage. Likely most of this stuff had been really expensive, so it seemed that Kylie definitely spent the extra effort to keep them well maintained.<br />
<br />
Doing a bit more snooping, John found a photo album which had been left open on the ground. Many pictures had been removed and were set about next to it. All of them were pictures of just him and Kylie doing things. &quot;Huh... In some of these pictures, it kind if looks like we are even on a date. Weird. I never would have thought that Kyle would one day become my girlfriend. Usually my girlfriends are not quite as neat as he, er she is. It is kind of spooky just how clean it is in here&quot; John said to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I like to keep my room clean, no need to be rude about it&quot; came from behind John. Turning around, he saw Kylie leaning on the door frame, with a somewhat annoyed expression. That being said, he internally confirmed once again that she actually did look attractive. Definitely not out of his strikezone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Soooo, boyfriend&quot; Kylie said sarcastically &quot;figure anything out, because I got absolutely nothing?&quot; Kylie took a seat in her desk chair and offered her &quot;boyfriend&quot; to sit on her bed. John couldn&#39;t help but notice how when she sat, she crossed her right leg over her left, showing him a generous amount of her pale thighs, partly due to the short skirt she was wearing not covering that much. She did it so naturally that it was like she never was a guy in the first place. Today her long, straight hair was kept down, with her side sweped bangs draping over her one eye. She also was wearing a thin white, low cut tank top. Something he very much enjoyed looking at, though he could have sworn that her boobs were not nearly as large yesterday as they actually were. Maybe she had something on which hid their size? <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I get that they make a great view, but at least answer my question if you are just gonna keep ogling at my tits. And don&#39;t expect me to do anything more than this in terms of being your girlfriend. This wasn&#39;t even my idea. My own mom laid them out for me to wear while I was taking a shower. She even forced me to let her do my hair! Seriously I don&#39;t get it at all. It&#39;s like she has always known me as being her daughter, but is just super excited to finally be able to dress me up since it is something she never got to do when I was still my normal self. These are 2 conflicting view points and yet she acts like it is natural.&quot; Kylie just went on and on with her half vent/half rant. John listened, but mainly was just focused on how great she looked. By now, he had fully gotten on board with dating her seriously. As far as he were concerned, Kyle never existed, and Kylie was here to stay in his place as his girlfriend.<br />
<br />
20 minutes into her venting rant, John gets up and walks over to her. In one smooth motion he scoops her up and brings her squirming body back over to the bed. Sitting back down, now that he has her sitting on his lap. &quot;Dude wtf, let go of me&quot; complained a pissed Kylie. But John jest kept her on his lap with one of his arm wrapped around her shoulders. &quot;N-n-n-n-n-n-no, I am not going to be your girlfriend if that is what you are thinking. Even with your good looks, or your well toned muscles, you-you will never change my mind&quot; blushed Kylie. She didn&#39;t want to admit it, but she now found John extremely attractive. And the fact that he had just picked her up like she weighed nothing, simply to comfort her on his lap had secretly made her fall in love with him even more. <br />
<br />
Going back several hours, Kylie had spent most of the night sorting out her current situation. That was until she found the photo album. She somehow managed to spend 4 hours alone just looking through the few pages, while removing every instance of her relationship with John. She had meant to hide them from him, but John had come over before she was able to. Now that he had seen them though, she couldn&#39;t hide their supposedly very intimate relationship from him. Which just only made her current situation that much more embarrassing. Her body clearly loved John, it just was that her mind hadn&#39;t fully adjusted yet.<br />
<br />
John was loving having Kylie on his lap. Her ass was soft, she wasn&#39;t at all heavy, and the way she kept denying their relationship, even though she was slowly snuggling in closer to his chest while she sat on his lap. I was very cute. He could also see directly down her top now, and damn, women&#39;s clothing was either amazing or she had gone up quite a few cup sizes over night. <br />
<br />
The sight of her boobs had given John an idea. After silently putting it into motion, he watched Kylie to see if she would notice as he continued to secretly stared down her top. Slowly, a darker colored spot began to form in her chest right in the center of her cleavage. It gradually began to gain mass, slowly starting to protrude outwards until it finally formed what was to be her third nipple. John excitedly watched as her new addition began to be push outwards, as breast tissue began to form behind it. Kylie hadnt noticed it yet either, still venting to him while she wrapped her arms around his waist.<br />
<br />
Slowly but surely, Kylies third boob began to fill out, pushing its way out from inside of her cleavage, while forming new cleavage on either side. As it inflated, her origional pair began to spread out, making enough room for all 3 of them to remain level with each other. <br />
<br />
Kylie started to notice an odd weight had begun pulling down on her chest. Looking down to inspect what it was, she froze up when she saw her new third boob, nestled neatly right in between her normal pair. It was even the same size too. Great, because since apparantly having your once flat chest continue to grow throughout the night into 2 DD-cups wasn&#39;t enough. So now she had been given a third. Of course this meant her entire world changed once again, as her top readjusted its design to now properly support 3 boobs while still generously showing them off, only this time, she had also learned as her top became a crop top, that she had a belly button piercing too. &quot;John, look at me. It just happened again! I just grew another freaking tit!&quot; Loudly exclaimed Kylie as she began to remove her top.<br />
<br />
John also started removing his own, hoping to guide her into the mood for sex. He also adjusted his body slightly to be even more attractive to her. Once her top was off. Kylie turned to show John only to see him sitting shirtless on her bed. It was like all thoughts had stoppped in her mind. She began to feel hot too as she was getting turned on. With a shaky hand she began to touch Johns abs. Feeling his muscles had sent chills throughout her body, causing all 3 nipples to become erect. Her pussy was almost soaking wet too. &quot;How can he be this handsome&quot; she thought, now seriously considering becomming his true girlfriend. Just rubbing against his body, feeling his strong arms hold her was making her super horny. &quot;I-I uhhh My-uhhh&quot; she just muttered incoherently as she was too distracted to even form a full sentance.<br />
<br />
Watching her act this way was very entertaining thought John. Not wanting to just leave it at her staring and feeling up his chest, he put his own hand on her newest boob, giving it a gental squeeze. This of course made Kylie moan, and broke her out of her daze. As she fully realized what she was doing, she found that she just couldn&#39;t stop herself from also feeling up his body. <br />
<br />
Both were quickly getting into the mood. John had made sure to make Kylie fit his cock perfectly too. While he was massageing her new breast, with his thumb teasing her nipple, Kylie finally couldn&#39;t hold back anymore and jumoed on him, straddling his body underneath her own as he fell backwards onto the bed. Both were vigorously making out as Kylie began pulling off Johns pants as he undid her skirt. Surprisingly, that was all he had to remove from her, which made him give her a look of disbelief. Breaking off from their kissing, Kylie quickly explains while slightly embarrassed &quot;look, I couldn&#39;t find any to wear because apparently, besides 2 thongs and a g-string, I don&#39;t own any panties, ok! And adding to that, roughly 90% of all of my clotheing either are dresses or come with a matching skirt.&quot; John found that when he adjusted her sometimes reality would give her an excuse which either fits into her new history as Kylie, or was adapted to seem like it just is something she now has to accept, like having 3 boobs. <br />
<br />
He was enjoying making changes to her while only making her partially aware of them. Sometimes setting her to either quickly accept them as they happened. Other times forgetting that they are new in the first place, believing that she always was like this. Occasionally he would leave her fully aware and not use to it at all, just to watch her reaction, while pretending that only she finds it odd. Which is what he had planned for her next change.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oww!&quot; Said kylie. &quot;I just bit my tongue a little bit&quot;. John pulled her in and began kissing her again. This time playing with her tongue with his. Something that she seemed to enjoy until she felt something was off. Breaking away from their kiss once again, Kylie stuck out her tongue as far as she could. Now it would have seemed normal enough, if not for the fact that her tongue tip was split down the center a good inch and a half, giving her a forked tongue look. She also could control each half independently too. <br />
<br />
&quot;John! My tongue! What happened to my tongue! We need to go to the hospital, I bit my tongue in half!&quot; Panicked Kylie. But John holds her down. &quot;What do you mean? You got it forked months ago remember? You felt it would make you better at eating out girls.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No I didn&#39;t! Why would I ever think that! Dont tell me you think this is all normal now too!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I was just messing with you. It is another changw for sure, but honestly it is kinda hot. You should definitely keep it.&quot; &quot;Fuck you, I was seriously worried that you would no longer remember the old me too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Again, sorry...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, don&#39;t do it again, or I will not continue being your girlfriend. Got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Understood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And just so we are clear, I am only going to let you fuck me once, just so we can feel what it is like, ok. This isn&#39;t going to become a regular thing&quot; says Kylie as she finally slides off John&#39;s underwear. <br />
<br />
She turned herself around, so that her pussy was right in front of his face. As she did that, she grabbed his cock and began using her split tongue to get him hard for her. She found that his cock didn&#39;t taste as bad as she thought. John was already eating her out too.</p>
