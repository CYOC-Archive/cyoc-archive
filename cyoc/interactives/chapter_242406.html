<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jodie was busying herself making dinner after an exhausting day reviewing case notes in her role as the leading partner of her law firm in a trial involving one of their largest clients, a multinational. It was a sprawling, complex financially significant case and her office, and the outer office of her paralegal assistant, Kayleigh, were full of boxes and boxes of evidence. She was so tired that she hadn’t bothered to change yet, her jacket draped over the back of her sofa whilst she stood at the kitchen island in her apartment in her black pencil skirt and white blouse.<br />
<br />
At first she thought she had selected the wrong channel, though she was sure she had selected her usual 24-hour news programming. What was being described sounded like the hokey fever dream of someone writing a bad fantasy TV script. She clicked the up channel button on the remote and found the same news report on the next channel up, and the next, and the next. It was only then that she slowly eased herself onto the edge of the couch, her brow furrowed as she tried to take in the crazy scenario unfolding in Texas.<br />
<br />
It was then that some icy fingers seized her heart. This town of Lilith was somewhere she had spent an overnight layover on her way to her client’s headquarters, just outside Austin. If this was a virus, had she been exposed? All of the precautions and worries that she had learned as muscle memory during the Covid Pandemic came flooding into her mind. Had she been in contact with many people there? Her heart sank when she recalled that, since the hotel had no on-site restaurant, she had gone across the street to the local bar and diner. It had been full of sports fans watching a big College Football game. It had been just 5 days ago.<br />
<br />
She robotically completed her dinner preparations and ate half of it, strangely without appetite. In fact, she had been feeling slightly off the whole day, occasional waves of tiredness and wooziness that she had out down to overwork, asking Kayleigh to make another pot of coffee, and pushing on as she normally did. Now, without any information regarding symptoms given on the TV report, she worried whether this was an indication of her infection with the virus.<br />
<br />
Five minutes later, she had her answer. She was walking from the kitchen area towards the bedroom to change into her nightgown when the dizziness came back, worse than before, and she reached out to prop herself against the right angle of a wall. She winced as she felt a stab of pain below her outstretched right arm and it was only when she felt it bite her again, that she realised it was coming from her bra, digging into her flesh. She staggered towards the bedroom and in the full-length mirror standing in one corner. She unbuttoned her blouse with shaking fingers and gave out a gasp of anguish.<br />
<br />
Her breasts were swollen and still swelling, up from her modest C-cups to some two sizes larger. She unclasped her brassiere quickly and her tits fell free, full and heavy. Most shocking of all however, was the blueish tinge which was beginning to seep out from their cleavage, spreading over her skin, unnatural and unrelenting. She bit her lip in fear and nearly drew blood as a sharp incisor threatened to cut into it. Approaching the mirror she realised her lips were deepening in colour from their usual pink towards a deep magenta. Peering at her reflection she bared her teeth and discovered several of them had grown into wicked-looking points.<br />
<br />
“Oh my God” she breathed out loud, inwardly completing that sentence with “I’m becoming one of them” in her mind. Another wave of dizziness accompanied with nausea and sweating overwhelmed her and she bent double, an intense stabbing pain accompanied it and when she managed to raise her head, she saw a pair of curved, magenta horns pushing up out of her skin.<br />
<br />
With a thump she keeled sideways and hit the floor, by now conscious that her mutation was taking hold of every part of her body “Oh!….Ohhhhh…NNNNOOOOO!” she cried out as the material of her skirt came apart at the seams with a loud ripping noise due to the expansion of her backside into a bubble butt she would never have been able to cultivate naturally. Like her swollen breasts, they were beginning to show the same spreading dusky dark blue taint seeping over her skin.<br />
<br />
She twitched in place, almost in a foetal ball, her flesh swelling. She had always been quite average in stature, never having particularly impressive curves. Now, though, she was becoming more and more hourglass in shape, with large rounded hips, breasts, and thighs. She might have welcomed it, had it not been accompanied by the rest of her changes. Crying out in pain again her shoulder blades crunched and surged against her blue skin before a pair of fledgling demonic wings began to emerge.<br />
<br />
The last of her most painful changes saw her previously dainty feet and her sensible calves reshape themselves into hooves and equine-like hocks respectively, full of muscle and power, showing beneath the blue covering. And then, the agony began to ebb away, replaced by a delicious, warm, sexual gratification. She was not simply becoming a Demon, but of course, as the news report had stated, into a very specific kind of Demon. Her sleek, straight, long blonde hair stained itself a deep magenta, from the crown of her head and down each strand, adopting a natural wave as it went until her new, lustrous locks hung around her bare, blue shoulders.<br />
<br />
A mass of flesh began to bulge from the top of her vagina, her womanhood displacing itself a little further backwards to accommodate the new organ, her cuntlips changing colour to match the magenta of her mouth. It turgidly grew thicker and heavier, its shape becoming slowly more obvious as its growth progressed behind it, a pair of large gonads in a thick, blue scrotum dropped from her redundant urethra which immediately sealed up behind it.  Her penis was rudely huge, as blue as the rest of her, the shaft more bulbous than the magenta-coloured mushroom of its already greasy helmet.<br />
<br />
As the news report had promised, the growth of her tails came next, sprouting from a point centred on the top of her buttocks, each one a long rope of thick erectile tissue. “Uuugnnhhhh!….Mmmmmmm!” she moaned as the tips of each tail flowered into the perfect head of a cock, each appendage swelling and growing a little more rigid as the newborn Succubus experienced the deep sexual pleasure that accompanied their emergence, leaking a slimy precum onto the polished floor of her bedroom.<br />
<br />
She lay there for several minutes in the aftermath, her monstrous body heaving as she recovered. Eventually, her blue eyelids, with long, thick black eyelashes blinked open. Her previous steel blue eyes had been replaced with a pair of yellow and black orbs, the pupils changed from their usual round shape to a black, vertical slit. Awkwardly, she hauled herself up onto her hooves and moved out into the hall.<br />
<br />
She tentatively touched the wall of the corridor from her bedroom back to her living area, getting used to walking on hooves, rather than feet and toes, hands tipped with polished black claws, replacing her perfectly manicured human nails. Her breath came in nervous, shocked, ragged shudders in the aftermath of her rebirth and a multitude of scary thoughts rushed through her mind; Would she lose her job, her apartment, her romantic partner? Was she destined to become one of those mindless, rutting creatures from the new reports? She already felt the sexual urge within her, and her new genitals would respond immediately and accordingly whenever she allowed herself to dwell on that last possibility too much. With tears in her yellow, slitted eyes, she clapped a magenta clawed, blue skinned hand over her mouth of brilliant white, sharp teeth, and gave a little sob as she reached the living room, the TV still chattering away in the background.<br />
<br />
With a stab of shock she realised she was stood in her own kitchen, a six foot three blue skinned Futanari Succubus with horns, wings, hooves and a mass of penis-tails in addition to the huge member between her legs. Anyone in the buildings around, or a passing helicopter would be able to see her. She leapt for the wall controls and stabbed on the button which all too slowly for her liking commanded the sun blinds to whirr into life and descend across the large windows in her corner apartment. She breathed a sigh of relief for the moment, relief which was all too fleeting.<br />
<br />
Her heart leapt as her phone started to vibrate on the countertop urgently, she fumbled at it awkwardly, having to rapidly get used to having claws instead of fingernails. The caller ID on the screen revealed the other party on the inbound call…</p>
