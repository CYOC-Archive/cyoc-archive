<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It  was getting near Chelsea&#39;s sixteen birthday, and her Mom had driven her to the mall.  Chelsea had grown to over six and a half feet tall, and had developed the physique of a female body builder.  She should have been on the football team, but she used her new strength to bully her way onto the cheerleader team.  Just like her school, she ruled her home with an iron fist, and now she was forcing her Mom to spend money on a lavish Sixteenth Birthday Party they couldn&#39;t afford.<br />
<br />
Jess, on the other hand, still looked like a child.  She had a flat chest, and as just under five feet tall.  Even though she was in college, she was still mistaken for a lost little girl.  She didn&#39;t understand why she was still so small.  She had been taking the growth pills for years, but they had no effect.  Yet Chelsea had blossomed into an Amazon. She suspected that Chelsea had stolen her pills, maybe switched hers with a placebo.  She decided today was the day to find out.  She snuck into Chelsea&#39;s room while she as gone.<br />
<br />
Normally she would have been afraid to enter.  Chelsea punished anyone who entered without her permission, even her parents.  The room smelled terrible, and there was dirty clothes all over the floor.  She searched through the drawers but found nothing.  Where could they be?  She was beginning to think she was overreacting, just being paranoid because she was jealous.  Then she opened the closet, and saw the shrine.  There was a small statue that resembled a cross between a chubby angel and a genie.  The figure was smiling, and holding a set of scales.  Below each scale was a picture.  She held one up, and it looked a school photo from when she was in middle school.  On the scale was some of her personal items from grade school.  A comb, some scraps of her clothes.  And ugh, was that a used tampon?  She threw it away in disgust.<br />
She backed away, bumping into a wall of flesh behind her.<br />
<br />
Jess turned and saw her Amazon sister, Chelsea staring down at her.  &quot;So you finally figured it out, huh?  I wondered when you would get the balls to come in here and look around.  Lucky for me you waited until it was too late.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess backed away.  &quot;What&#39;s going on?  I don&#39;t understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chelsea pushed her out of the closet and closed the door.  &quot;It&#39;s just a little black magic that I used to get a little more well developed.  I really just wanted to siphon some of your development.  You know, steal you height and breast size.  Imagine my surprise when I developed like this, &quot; said Chelsea, flexing her large biceps. &quot;At first, I thought that Mother Nature had just been very generous with you.  Then I found these.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chelsea held up Jess&#39; bottle of growth pills.  She wagged her finger at her. &quot;Naughty, naughty.  That was cheating, trying to catch up to me like that.  But I guess you didn&#39;t know I was stealing your puberty.  Whatever you gained, just went to me.  I tried the pills on myself, but they just didn&#39;t seem to work as well.  So I let you keep taking them and I just enjoyed the benefits.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess just at her sister in shock.  She was crazy!  This whole thing was crazy!<br />
<br />
Chelsea sighed.  &quot;I guess since you know my secret now you won&#39;t keep taking these pills. Well, I might as well get as much use out of them as possible.  Can&#39;t let good meds go to waste. I am going to make you take your medicine.  All of it.  Right now, in front of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess shook her head wildly.  &quot;I can&#39;t!  The bottle says not to take more than one a day!  It can have serious side effects.  Let me just take one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chelsea shook her head. &quot;No way.  Then you will just throw them away, or tell Mom and Dad.  No, I want the maximum effect.  And the only way I can get that is if I make sure you take them all.  So stop wasting time.  Or do I need to force them down your throat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess weakly accepted the pills in her hand.  There were so many of them!  She had just gotten a new bottle.  She didn&#39;t want to take them, but Chelsea glared at her with malice in her eyes.  Jess began to dry swallow them, one by one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good girl, &quot; said Chelsea, as Jess finished the pills.  She ruffled her hair painfully.  &quot;Such a good little girl.  I can&#39;t wait to see how big I am gonna get.  Now get out of my room before I decide you need to be punished for sneaking in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess walked slowly out, as Chelsea slammed her door shut.  Her heart was racing, and her body burned.  She had never felt this way when she had taken the pills before.  She feared what effect an overdose would have.  And what changes it would cause in her already monstrous sister.  She thought about going into the bathroom and trying to induce vomiting.  Then again, maybe she could go back to her supplier, the girl who had given her the pills.  Maybe she could help her.  Or then again maybe Chelsea&#39;s shrine was the problem.  If she could destroy it, maybe all of the change would reverse.<br />
<br />
Standing in the hallway Jess considered her options.  She had to hurry.  It felt like her body was changing already.</p>
