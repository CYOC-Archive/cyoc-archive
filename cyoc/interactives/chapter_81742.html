<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>I looked at the watch a final time before saying, "Alright we'll go into the cyber world," and putting it on.</p>
<p>Tina did jump up and down yelling, "Thank you thank you thank you." She had already put the watch on so she put the disk in with a 
huge smile on her face saying, "See you there."</p>
<p>I watched fascinated as Tina began to fade out. It was like I had imagined it with Tina slowly becoming more and more translucent 
until she could no longer be seen. "Wonder what it feels like," I mumbled after Tina had completely faded out at least to my eyes. "Well I'll 
know soon enough," I said shrugging and opening the watch. I paused for a few moments with the disc partway in. I thought about what 
type of avatar would be on it if it wasn't blank. Would I become an animal or a living inanimate object? I knew there were people that would 
want to be those things and I had to admit to fantasizing a bit about becoming an inanimate object but I wouldn't really want to be one. I 
wouldn't want to become a complete animal either and I never fantasized about that. Though becoming an anthropomorphic animal may 
not be so bad depending on what it was. With a little shake of my head I finished putting the disk in and closed the watch. As everything 
started fading to black from my point of view I felt a tingling numbness throughout my body which began to fade leaving me feeling nothing 
at all as everything around me became a void."</p>
<p>I wasn't sure how long that state lasted since there was nothing to measure time by. It could have been a second or maybe minutes. 
Hell it could have been thousands of years for all I knew. The only thing that I knew for certain was that at some point the process started 
to reverse itself. As objects began to fade in replacing the void I felt the tingling numbness return. There was more of the numbness in my 
chest and a little less in my groin. I figured that the disk wasn't blank but I was female at least. I was kind of excited to see what I'd look 
like. As things started to become clearer I could see that I was in some type of cell. I could hear voices but they were indistinct. They 
began to become clearer and I could make out a male voice asking, "Are you sure this will work? How do we know if someone will even 
find the disks?"</p>
<p>"I have every confidence that someone will," a female voice said. "The mer king and queen wouldn't have had an avatar made if they 
didn't think someone would find it. The same with the fairy king and queen."</p>
<p>"Where's the fairy supposed to appear?" the male voice asked.</p>
<p>"I don't know and I don't want to know," the female voice said. "If you know what's good for you you'll stop wondering where the fairy 
will be held. Our concern is the mer that will appear in the cell." The two people rounded the corner and the female said, "And speak of the 
devil she's here. Hello Princess. I hope you find these accommodations to your liking."</p>
<p>I didn't respond but instead looked at the two of them. The male was short and was an anthropomorphic white rat and the female 
seemed to be some type of demon with red skin, long black hair, black horns, yellow eyes, claws, pointed ears, large breasts about the 
size of watermelons, and sharp teeth. She was looking at me with a hungry look. I also took a look at myself.  For some reason I was 
completely naked except for a pouch tied around my waist. My legs had metallic gold colored scales extending from about mid-thigh down 
to my ankles. There the scales stopped but lines of the same color continued on the upper part of my feet to my toes and they reminded 
me of the spines in a fish tail. My groin was flat and hairless with a slit between my legs. My new breasts were about average for a human, 
that is a C cup though I wasn't very good at guessing breast size. My skin was pale like it didn't see sun that much and it was hairless. I 
reached up and pulled some hair to where I could see it. It was now something like a strawberry blond instead of the brown I was used to 
and it would just cover my breasts if I draped some in front. That was the extent of what I could see for now so I looked at the demoness 
and asked, "How and you get me here and why?"</p>
<p>"It's really pretty simple Princess," the demoness said smiling. "An associate of ours paid the maker of your avatar to make sure you 
came entered this world in that cell. As to the why, you're being held for ransom."</p>
<p>"So you left the disks for us to find," I said getting angry.</p>
<p>Both of them shuddered and the demoness said, "We may be greedy but we don't have a death wish. The other world is filled with 
radiation. One can be in that world for about ten minutes at a time before the radiation starts to affect them. At least that's what is 
considered the safe time limit in places. Other places it's less than that. Why risk our own necks when someone else can be bribed to do 
it?"</p>
<p>"There can't be any radiation there because I saw animal tracks," I said trying to convince myself as much as them. If what the 
demoness said is true then Tina and I were effectively stuck in the cyber world.</p>
<p>"Probably a mutated animal that adapted to better handle radiation," the demoness said with a shrug. "Though if you want to test it go 
right ahead and do so. Just know that you'll reappear in this cell when you come back. If you don't die from the radiation first."</p>
<p>It looked like I had another choice to make. I could exit the cyber world and hope that if there was radiation that it wasn't as bad as 
they said or I could stay in the cyber world for now at least. Of course there was Tina to consider too. I didn't know if she knew how to exit 
the cyber world. I would have to find her and tell her if I ever got out of here. Something told me that they weren't going to just let me go 
after getting the ransom money they wanted. And I was curious about why they called me Princess. So what should I do?</p></p>
