<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The captain&#39;s arm gently squeezes Nate&#39;s chest. Strongarm opening his eyes, the older man grunting as he adjusts his back against the frame and keeps the cabin boy close. Nate doesn&#39;t resist, playing along. Partly because he&#39;s worried what will happen if he resists, and partly because he&#39;s enjoying it all. Being kept secure against such a strong, masculine man&#39;s chest. Cushioned by his furry chest, kept warm in the night against him. Loving his rugged jaw and fierce features, giving in to whatever is happening is starting to really pay off...<br />
<br />
But their morning together is short. The captain giving Nate a tight hug, then climbing out of bed. Going to his dresser to grab his jacket and pants. Wrapping it over his shoulder, then giving an order.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay here, son. Dad&#39;s going to wash up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate watches the older man leave. The meaning of his words hitting him hard. &#39;son&#39;? He mentioned earlier they might become family if he did a good job. Was that what was happening? He couldn&#39;t remember last night in its entirety, he didn&#39;t remember what they did besides sex. But the room stinks of their love, and Nate eyes his own body. Some of his muscles have returned, only a small portion as he&#39;s still the runt of the crew. But something is there now. A small growth in his arms and chest. Unimpressive, but the signs of a man starting to work out.<br />
<br />
Some hairs line his body once more. Not much, but enough to stop him from looking too boyish. It&#39;s all pretty normal to him, or at least as normal as a pirate physically changing him could be. But that pirate is out, and Nate is in his room. <br />
<br />
He goes to leave the bed and search for anything that might help his escape. But as he adjusts in the sheets, his nose presses against a still moist spot on the bed. It&#39;s the captain&#39;s alright, not sure if it&#39;s cum of sweat. But whatever it is, it smells good. Musky and overpowering, old and well forged. It&#39;s just like the man it came from, and it completely demands Nate&#39;s attention. When he finally manages to break free of his wild sniffing, the door opens to a fully dressed Strongarm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good work, me boy. Thought ye might try something, but yer learning.&quot;<br />
&quot;I couldn&#39;t resist you even if I wanted to, Pops.&quot;<br />
<br />
He shook after saying that work. Calling this menace of the high seas his father wasn&#39;t what he wanted to do, even if it was what he needed to say to keep this ruse up. It stung worse when he realised it was the first word his mind went to when speaking to the captain. Strongarm having a wide smile upon hearing Nate call him that. The captain searching through his dresser to pull out an opened blue vest and long brown pants. They look far too small for the pirate, but just the size for Nate. He leaves them folded on the desk, then looks to his slowly changing son.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me old clothes. Should fit ye fine. Wash up downstairs, then I want ye shadowing the first mate today, savvy?&quot;<br />
 &quot;Aye aye, pops.&quot;<br />
<br />
Strongarm smirks, Nate looking to the pile with a half grin as he unconsciously embraces his new role. Startled when he sees the clothes lacks any under garments as he calls back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, I&#39;m going commando?&quot;<br />
&quot;Aye, lad. Trust your pa, it feels good.&quot;<br />
<br />
He gulps, if the captain says so then he&#39;ll trust it. The more he calls him his father, the more his entire being is accepting it as reality. Nate grabbing the clothes and leaving with his dad. The captain going up stairs and Nate down. To a hall which only has light for the first door on the left. The further back halls in complete darkness, an obvious warning that no one should be down there.<br />
<br />
Nate contemplates looking further for a few moments. But he still stinks of sex, is still naked, and a part of him doesn&#39;t want to disappoint his new father. He goes to the lit room, opening it up to see a warm bath with a few puddles on the wood floor. Two towels hanging at the back, one sopping wet while the other completely dry. A bench sitting by the side which Nate rests the clothes on then climbs into the pool.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s nicer than he thought. The waters fresh and warm, a scrub nearby to clean off the remains of last night. Nate as fresh as he can be, relaxing his back against the baths edge and just trying to recompose. <br />
<br />
It&#39;s all becoming too much, and he knows he doesn&#39;t have too much time left. Whatever the captain is doing is working, and he&#39;s being molded into Strongarms ideal son. Just being around the man causes him to fall in line. If he still wants to leave, he&#39;ll need to avoid the captain. But does he still want to leave? Nate finds it hard to answer that question, just staring at the wall for minutes on end, then onto the captain&#39;s still wet towel.<br />
<br />
Another feeling starts to take over Nate. He leaves the pool temporarily to grab the captain&#39;s towel. Descending back into the waters warmth, resting the cloth on the baths edge as he brings it close to his face. It smells just like the captain, that hardy and dominant smell that he&#39;s starting to love. Nate holding it against him, moving a bit closer as his lips drink the remnants of liquid found in the fabric. A mix of bath water, sweat, and something else. Salty on his tongue and tasting almost familiar. Nate looking for more of these noticeably wet spots, drinking them down as his cheeks go bright red.<br />
<br />
He stretches while within the pool. Chest heaving outwards, a month of heavy training being added to his body. Becoming more of a young adult that has taken to the gym. Noticeable lines marking his pecs and lower abs, but not clear enough to seperate and show the muscle. Arms going from whimpy to firm. Nothing too impressive, but they expand outwards to showcase a strengthening man. Further length being added to Nate as he fills more of the pool. Legs, arms, and chest gaining a few inches in size. Head reshaping slightly to be better preportioned for his new body, while even his cock grows another inch as a few more pubes grow out from the skin.<br />
<br />
Nate continues to hold the towel against his head. Taking one more long whiff. Concentrating on the captain&#39;s smell. Gaining more of his biological traits as more hair sprouts on his body, going from between his pecs to covering them as well. Armpits filled to the brim with hair after hair, which starts to produce a rugged BO. Face becoming fiercer, brows even thicker as they help him have a natural scowl. A few strands of his body turning red in colour, as Nate releases a satisfied grunt. Voice richer, tinged with the sailors vibrant speech. <br />
<br />
Finally, he feels like he has had enough. Getting out of the pool, putting the captain&#39;s towel away and grabbing his own. Washing himself up, cleaning off a few bits of pre that were caused by his earlier exploration. Putting on the captain&#39;s vest and pants, both snugly fitting the changing man. Dick pressing against the fabric, as Nate feels a slight pleasure. Smirking to himself as he leaves the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pops is right. Me cock feels good and free.&quot;<br />
<br />
A voice calls from the floor above. The first mate&#39;s voice being easy to identify.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nate. C&#39;mon. Yer needing to help me today.&quot;<br />
&quot;Aye, wait a second ye impatient bastard!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two laugh, Nate spotting the dark rooms in the distance once more. If he goes up there and plays his part, he doesn&#39;t know if he&#39;ll ever want to break free. But does he even want to break free anymore? It feels so good to become a member of the crew.</p>
