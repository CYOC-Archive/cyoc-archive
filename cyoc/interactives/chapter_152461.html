<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex decided he&#39;d randomize everything but his stats, and spend the extra stat points intelligently. He made his selection and waited.  The randomizer processed for several seconds as Alex&#39;s excitement built.  Then the results appeared, and his jaw dropped.<br />
<br />

<br />
Before he could even read it all though he began to feel a pleasurable warm tingle throughout his entire body.  He started to shrink, and he knew what was happening.  He wanted to find a way to stop it, to somehow fight it, but the pleasure grew and grew and he couldn&#39;t focus.  His penis quickly rose to the stiffest erection of his life, but as he felt back on the bed moaning a moan that grew in pitch and ended distinctly feminine, he felt it begin to shrink.  He grasped at it, but it slipped through his fingers and in a moment all he was clutching was a feminine mound as his balls retracted inside as well.  The mere accidental touch of his still masculine fingers on his new pussy sent electric signals up his spine and straight to his brain, causing him, or rather, her, to cry out in pleasure.  This seemed to send the process into overdrive as her waist caved in, her hips widened to more womanly proportions, her skin softened, and her arms grew small and dainty.  In her rapture her lips formed an &quot;O&quot; as they turned soft and cherry red.  Her eyes turned a deep purple.  <br />
<br />
It felt good.  Too good.  She was beyond any attempt at resistance at this point, and so as the next change came she only welcomed what she ought to have dreaded.  The pleasure first collected in her nipples, and she pulled her shirt up to watch as they grew puffy and erect on her chest.  As the cool air hit them she felt she could have orgasmed, and yet while her pleasure climbed higher and higher, orgasm itself seemed to elude her.  It felt so erotic, so naughty, having them exposed, which might have seemed strange when her chest had never been a scandalous thing before, yet it certainly felt so now.  There was something new to this female eroticism though...vulnerability.  She felt open, exposed...and it made her horny.  Those nipples that jutted out for the world to see seemed to be proclaiming that she could be claimed, conquered, by the teasing of them.  As tissue began to develop underneath them, granting her what might technically be called breasts, she imagined someone touching them, fondling them.  To her shock, the imaginary hands and lips that teased them were male, but try as she might, she couldn&#39;t bring herself to stop the fantasy.  Her budding breasts continued to blossom, and her own hands went down to cup and then to massage them.<br />
<br />
Then it was upon her.  At last the tide was reaching it&#39;s zenith.  &quot;oh, oh, OH YES!&quot;  She cried.  As her orgasm swept her away like an untamed ocean tidal wave she bucked and thrashed and emitted a chorus of senseless girlish pleasure sounds.<br />
<br />
Several moments passed as she tried to catch her breath.  God, had she really just cum as a girl?  and while fantasizing about a guy, no less?  and why was she referring to herself with female pronouns?  thinking about it, she found that she COULD think about herself with male pronouns if she wanted to, but it took effort and felt unnatural.  Damn it all.  Was it some magic of the world forcing her to use female pronouns?  She didn&#39;t want to think about the other possibility:  That she had just become a girl in mind and soul.  She had to admit it was possible though.  She...she felt sort of like a different person, a softer, smaller person.  The thought almost brought tears to her eyes, but that would just be even girlier!  <br />
<br />
She tried not to think about it and sat back up.  She looked back at the character creation screen and read the rest.<br />
<br />
:::<br />
Active Skills:  <br />
-Charm lv 1:  Once a day.  Works only on males.<br />
-Soul Drain lv 1:  Gain XP or MP by draining the vital essence of targets through sexual contact.<br />
-Succubus Transformation lv 1: Let your demon nature take over, increasing your powers substantially.  Prolonged or frequent use will cause you to become closer to a true succubus and lose your humanity.  <br />
<br />
Spells:<br />
-Illusion lv 1:  Your novice illusions are paltry tricks and can be seen through easily.  Maybe you could use them to win at cards?  That is if the other players are all drunk.  Try wearing a low cut blouse maybe.<br />
-Summon Familiar lv 1:  Summon a weak demon familiar.  You can see through the eyes of your familiar and it&#39;s presence increases your mana and magic power, but if it dies you will lose XP or even levels.<br />
-Fireball lv 1:  Shoot a fireball.  It&#39;s not complicated.  Though good luck killing anything with that puny thing.<br />
<br />
Passive Skills:<br />
- The Cursed Heroine: You will level up quickly, but luck is not your friend, and evil will be attracted to you.<br />
- Hell Affinity:  Demon summoning and fire based spells are stronger and learned more easily.<br />
- Unworldly Beauty:  As you level up, your beauty will increase, granting a random chance for a charisma increase at every level.<br />
<br />
Information:<br />
<br />
No memories before the age of 4, you were raised in an orphanage.  Due to lack of funds the orphanage closed down when you were 13, forcing you onto the streets.  You quickly learned that your best survival asset was your pretty female body, and began selling it.  You found that you also had an affinity for magic, and taught yourself a couple basic spells.  Now at age 17 your nature as a half succubus has awakened and other abilities come with it...<br />
:::<br />
<br />
And of course, there was still the Cursed Hero passive skill, though now it was Cursed Heroine.  She wondered if that damn thing was responsible for her becoming a succubus prostitute.  In hindsight randomizing things while cursed to have bad luck had been stupid.  Most of her stats sucked.  She did have average intelligence, decent wisdom, and great charisma though?  She was clearly no fighter, but for her Sorceress class that didn&#39;t matter, and her stats actually might work out well...<br />
<br />
Noticing she had 8 bonus stat points to spend, she put 4 into wisdom and 4 into intelligence.  She would have put more into wisdom but the system penalized increasing a stat over 24 by doubling the point cost.  She refused to put anything into Charisma.  She wasn&#39;t going to be some succubus slut charming her way through the world.  She&#39;d be a sorceress.  <br />
<br />
She finished up and the screen vanished.  Noticing a mirror she walked over to it.  She was surprised to find that she wasn&#39;t all that voluptuous and that her face was cute but not super seductive.  It was surprising for a succubus.  She supposed she was glad not to look like a super slut.</p>
