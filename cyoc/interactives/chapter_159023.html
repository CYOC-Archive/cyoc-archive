<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;MWUHAHAHAHAHA!!!&quot; Some extremely powerful cultist cackled as he had some powerful green rock in his hand crackling with some insane energy. Heroes at his feet unable to do anything to stop the man who had been moving at light speed, and slowing everyone down. Thankfully the insane man was in a sort of monologue mode, and from the side line a little magical girl started to inch a small ribbon close to the pebble. One of the little magical girls who were helpless again the cultist, but thanks to the heroes playing distraction as the cultist was cackling at the heroes the leader of those magical girls was able to get her ribbon around the pebble. Whatever the stone did it seemed supernatural and Red 6&#39;s ribbon did it&#39;s job and after quickly wrapping around the pebble all the energy seemed to vanish into the pebble. Without the energy Red 6 snapped back the ribbon catching the encased magical artifact still wrapped in her ribbon. The damned cultist now essentially powerless immediately got restrained, and got ready to be sent to a super villain jail while he awaited trial. The magical girl squad was escorted back to the Protectors building where it could be safely contained. At a containment center Magical Girl squad 626 was being led by their squad mother Oracle. She was a hero with near omniscient levels of sight. She just needed to know where she was looking, and pray some massive supernatural force wouldn&#39;t provide interference. <br />
Red 6 and many of her Magical Girl sisters looked at the containment center, and wondered how long the stone would be contained here? On occasion some super spy or major villain would find a way to sneak in and grab one of the relics of major power. On other occasions a hero needing a boost would check one out and on a good day the relic would come back or be destroyed with no issue in the field. On a bad day the hero would turn to a villain or the relic would be lost or stolen. Red 6 thought &quot;These adults are babies if they think putting this thing in a container here will make everyone safe... Why does it feel like I&#39;m the only adult in a case like this?&quot; looking to her teammates she thought &quot;Least my sisters seem to be thinking the same thing.&quot; <br />
<br />
Oracle said &quot;Ok, I&#39;ve gotten a place to put that little pebble away in... Just need to find an appropriate container, and for that... I&#39;ll need to view it Red 6 could you unwrap it from your Ribbon?&quot; The supernatural negation ribbon turned out to be a major source of interference to Oracle. It was highly localized and she usually could guess what were in the ribbons, but if she needed to see specifically what the thing was the ribbons were a major annoyance. Red 6 unwrapped the pebble and held it in her right hand. Oracle immediately knew what was spotted. She had heard of the object and others similar to it, pebbles that held massive energies that manipulated several facets that created existence. If one were to have them all they&#39;d essentially become omnipotent. They were called the Mobius Pebbles, why? Well because their power was similar to a Mobius strip. When the pebbles were on your side, your side would just keep going on and on forever. The green one in Red 6&#39;s hand was the time pebble and it was reacting to Red 6&#39;s thoughts on maturity and immaturity and the pebble sparked as energy radiated in a pulse that hit the whole Protectors building. Red 6 was confused as the pulse was messing with her head, but when she was refocusing she was hearing a baby crying. Looking down she found a small baby in Oracle&#39;s clothing, Both scared and unable to comprehend what was happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;HOLY SHIT, WE&#39;RE ADULTS!&quot; shouted a now adult Magical &quot;Girl&quot; Boxer. Her body for sure was more developed and matured, but wasn&#39;t that much more sexually matured and more like a small giant. Big but she had very lean muscles on her. Thankfully for her and the rest of the magical girl bodies their magical girl uniforms were lengthening to cover their modesty. Red 6 took a glance at herself like the rest of the Magical &quot;Girls&quot; and found D-cups staring at her. Both the Purifier&#39;s magic going away and a few years of puberty could do that to a girl. MG Bandage was the first to get to and pick up the baby who was probably Oracle and started to cradle her. Red 6 noticing the pebble was still radiating a weird energy wrapped the pebble in her ribbons again. <br />
<br />
Bandage asked &quot;What are we going to do? Should we try to use that pebble again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Red 6 shook her head and said &quot;No, Let&#39;s go to Doctor Doctor. He&#39;s smart and should know what to do.&quot; Smart being an understatement the Magical &quot;Girl&quot; Squad left the containment center through the elevator to Doctor Doctor&#39;s lab. The Protectors building having a relatively low population meant they didn&#39;t bump into anyone, and when they barged into Doctor Doctor&#39;s lab they were disheartened and a little surprised to see some clothes and a lab coat on the floor... Along with a naked baby trying to climb up a box to get to Doctor Doctor&#39;s desk. Bandage still holding Oracle noted that baby Doctor Doctor seemed to have some intellect and problem solving, and Oracle... Was a baby... <br />
<br />
Red 6 went to her once godfather and picked him up saying &quot;Doctor Doctor? Can you understand me?&quot; The baby nodded yes and Red 6 said &quot;This weird stone pulsed some weird energy and now everything&#39;s like this. Any idea how we can fix things?!?&quot; The baby shook it&#39;s head no as it was still trying to think through everything. Extreme intellect for a baby being less amazing than when his brain was more developed. Red 6 let the baby onto his desk where it crawled to the keyboard and mouse and started to try to do something on the computer. <br />
<br />
Athena sighed and said &quot;Just use the small pebble again. What&#39;s the worst that could happen?&quot; <br />
<br />
Apple 2 thought for a second and listed off &quot;We could become senile old ladies, or become babies as well, or make the baby protectors even younger, or should I even list any other bad outcomes?&quot; <br />
<br />
Red 6 stared at the pebble bound in ribbon and said &quot;...It&#39;s risky, but... I think we have to take the risk... If we don&#39;t who knows how much trouble will occur now that the protectors seem to be babies.&quot; Red 6 unwrapped the stone that glowed with it&#39;s weird time energies, but her mind was confused and muddled. What she was thinking then was-</p>
