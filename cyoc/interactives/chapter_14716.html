<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the peach-pink light of morning glowing in the sky, Rich was awakened by quiet sobs.  <br />
<br />
Lying on the ground where he had fallen asleep, he blinked, squinted at the light, and saw Jennifer sitting on her haunches and sobbing, attempting to wipe the tears from her cheeks with a forepaw, her breasts getting in the way.  What on Earth could be wrong, he wondered, after that wonderful night of lovemaking?  Had he moved too fast with her?  Was she having second thoughts?  He opened his mouth to ask, but just then the oddest thing occurred to him: <br />
<br />
Jennifer was half kangaroo.  <br />
<br />
He scanned her up and down - he knew she looked no different than she always had, but it was as if he had just realized what he had been seeing all this time: This girl was literally half kangaroo!  She had paws and kangaroo legs!  And a tail!  With a powerful &quot;what the fuck&quot; building in his brain, Jennifer's small, tentative hop toward him was all it took to throw him into a panic.  <br />
<br />
Crying out, he recoiled and attempted to spring away, but it was as if his arms weren't working right and his feet were in the wrong place.  He kicked and tumbled over sideways much more violently than he had expected, landing on his back.  <br />
<br />
The sensations hitting Rich's brain were way more than he could make sense of: the feeling of something near his ass being painfully bent, the feeling that something was all over his ears...he tried to get up but still couldn't seem to get his arms under him.  After something big and soft smacked him in the face, the heavy movement on his chest caused him to look down.  <br />
<br />
Panic turned into pure, dumb shock as he looked down over a huge, jiggling pair of breasts and saw two long, thin, furry feet sticking up like a V in the air.  He raised his arms to look at his hands and two small, clawed forepaws just barely came into view. <br />
<br />
Jennifer's &quot;Rich, I'm so sorry&quot; barely registered in his brain.  His hair stood on end as he slowly realized that this was his body.  Terror on his face, he couldn't speak and had no idea what to do.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Rich, let me explain&quot;, said Jennifer, as he looked up at her, realizing that something seriously mad was going on here.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck is this?!!&quot; cried Rich, still trying to get up.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Listen to me&quot;, Jennifer said, still sobbing, &quot;I'll help you get up.  Use your tail to push yourself onto your side and you should end up standing on your feet.&quot;  Rich could make no sense of instructions involving a tail but after struggling a while he managed to roll onto his side and get his left foot under him before settling upright on both feet.  He nudged his breasts aside with his forepaws and looked down, seeing the pouch on his furry, rounded belly for the first time, with his feet sticking out beyond it.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Will you tell me what the fuck is going on here?!&quot; said Rich, on the verge of crying himself.  Jennifer explained about the curse, how Kyle had changed her and forced her to ensnare him in the same trap, and how it was impossible to talk to anyone but the three of them about what had happened.  Rich had heard about the curse, and every ounce of his brain was telling him this was total bullshit, but he couldn't argue with the reality he saw before him. <br />
<br />
Rich got his wits about him.  &quot;Ok, how do we fix this?&quot;  Sobbing, Jennifer explained how Kyle had fixed the curse so that they were stuck like this forever.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait&quot;, said Rich, &quot;Explain that again.  What exactly did Kyle say?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;He said that I was immune to the effects of the curse forever, and that you would change into an exact copy of me except for your face and voice, and then you'd realize what had happened.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;A ha!&quot;  Relief washed over Rich.  &quot;So he said the curse wouldn't work on you anymore, but he didn't say that about me!  I have the power to pass the curse on now, and I can change back!&quot;  Jennifer realized with some sadness that this was true.  Beneath her fear of how Rich would react was a great relief that she wouldn't be the only person in the world who was stuck in this condition.  Now that hope was gone.  But at least she could help Rich fix what she was forced to do to him.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll do anything to help you, Rich.  Nothing is more important to me&quot; she said, hopping over to him and placing her paw on his foreleg.  Rich looked down at his ridiculous new body and didn't know what to do.  <br />
<br />
&quot;How am I going to do anything?&quot; he said, examining his paws and looking around at his tail and legs.  &quot;And how the fuck to I move?&quot;  Rich tried to take a step forward but his foot seemed frozen to the ground.  He tried and tried but wasn't able to lift it.  &quot;My feet won't work.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We can't move our feet one at a time - they only work together.&quot;  This seemed absurd to Rich but try as he might, he just couldn't lift his foot off the ground.  He tried rising up onto the tip-toes of both of his hind legs at the same time and like magic his legs obeyed his command.  He tried wiggling the clawed toes of one foot and couldn't, but he could easily wiggle both of them together.  &quot;So you mean I seriously have to hop to get around?&quot; Rich said, embarrassment washing over him at the thought of having to hop like a rabbit to get anywhere.  &quot;Yeah, I'm afraid that's how it works&quot;, said Jennifer, &quot;but be careful - those legs are a lot stronger than you think.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Rich raised himself up on his toes a few more times to get the hang of his new legs and then tried a tiny hop.  He was shocked when he shot three feet into the air, landing unsteadily and almost losing his balance.  And it was only then that the full effect of Kyle's devious design occurred to him: Until then, his giant breasts had just been part of the whole freakish form he was trying to make sense of, but there was no ignoring them once his hop set them bouncing wildly all over the place.  He felt their weight bobbing on his chest and the sensitive flesh jiggling, seemingly refusing to settle back down again.  Instinctively he tried to grab them with his arms to steady them but found his forelegs simply weren't suited to the task.  His face burned red with the worst humiliation he had ever felt; not only was he, a guy, stuck with massive boobs, but he had no choice but to have them constantly bouncing in all directions, unless he wanted to sit still for the rest of his life.  <br />
<br />
&quot;That fucking bastard - we're going to get him for this&quot;, threatened Rich as he tried another hop, more gently this time.  With some practice he learned to lean into the hop a bit and move himself forward, though not without the constant reminders of his condition bouncing heavily on his chest.  <br />
<br />
&quot;How do we get to school?&quot; asked Rich, &quot;...there's no way I can drive a car like this&quot;.  &quot;Let's see if you even have a car anymore&quot; responded Jennifer.  &quot;This reality is totally different.  Remember how my locker has a paw scanner that lets me open it?  That didn't exist before today.&quot;  Rich tried to wrap his mind around this fact; it seemed to him that she had always been part kangaroo, as far back as he can remember being aware of her, only this never seemed odd to him before today.  &quot;So I suppose nobody will think anything weird about me being like this&quot;, he said.  &quot;But what about these?  I'm a guy!&quot;  Rich prodded the bottom of his boobs with his forelegs.  <br />
<br />
&quot;My guess is people won't think anything is strange about you being a guy with boobs.  And, well...the rest, too.&quot;  It wasn't until then that Rich realized that being an exact copy of Jennifer from the neck down meant that he shared her sex down there as well.  Not that he could see this fact without a mirror and some acrobatic maneuvering.  He fumed inside.  <br />
<br />
Hopping around to the front of the house, Rich's car was gone; he had no use for a car in this new reality.  &quot;The bus, I suppose&quot;, he said.  &quot;Let's get going.  I have an idea.  We need to make a plan.  I need to run this by you to make sure it makes sense.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Rich shared his plan as the two hopped down the street to the corner where the bus stopped every morning, though he was constantly distracted by thoughts that the entire world would be looking at him, a kangaroo-girl-boy hopping down the sidewalk with huge, naked breasts bouncing non-stop.  Nobody batted an eye.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Follow my lead&quot;, said Jennifer, leaning forward and hopping carefully up the steps onto the bus.  Rich managed to get up the stairs and copied Jennifer by leaning forward and taking small hops with his forelegs on the ground.  He found an empty space cut out from the seats directly across from the spot Jennifer took.  He settled into place and looked around, still burning with embarrassment despite knowing that nobody noticed anything strange about him.  <br />
<br />
Arriving at school, Jennifer said, &quot;Kyle's locker is this way.  Let's go.&quot;  The pair hopped down the hall and sat on their haunches in front of Kyle's locker, ironing out the rest of their plan.</p>
