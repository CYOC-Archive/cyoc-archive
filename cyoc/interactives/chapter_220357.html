<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a brand-new building, built only a few years ago. Ken thought the way it was designed made it look a bit like a community college. There was a distinct lack of coziness, the halls feeling eerily empty even when they were packed. Probably because it lacked the rows of lockers he was used to seeing in middle school. You didn’t get lockers here except in the locker room, and that was at the far side of the building near the gym, so everyone carried their books for the day at all times.<br />
<br />
They entered and walked close to each other, closer than two straight guys likely would.<br />
<br />
It garnered them a few looks but nothing too offensive. Ken supposed that this was normal in the new reality where the stars of the football and wrestling team were openly dating. Who’d want to get kicked out of school for discrimination… or worse, get their asses beat by two jocks?<br />
<br />
That was the kind of freedom most gay guys never got, Ken supposed.<br />
<br />
The first half of the day was uneventful. Ken and Jeff were in different classes. Lunch was a bit different. While they were eating together, Ken noticed a table giving them the side-eye. The country kids, of course.<br />
<br />
They were jocks too, but lived on the farms outside the city. <br />
<br />
“We can’t turn them all into trucks.” Jeff whispered, not looking at the country kids.<br />
<br />
“What? I didn’t say anything.” Ken protested, his voice cracking a little.<br />
<br />
“No, but you were thinking it, babe.” Jeff smirked at Ken.<br />
<br />
Ken blushed, feeling flustered. Had he really been so transparent?<br />
<br />
“So? Why not?”<br />
<br />
“Because we need them to win state. Duh.” Jeff rolled his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Then who are we turning into a truck?” Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
“Who said it needed to be someone at school?” Jeff grinned, “You are just too excited about it, huh?”<br />
<br />
Ken squirmed. “Maybe.”<br />
<br />
Jeff squeezed his thigh under the table. “Just have some patience. I’m sure an opportunity will present itself.”<br />
<br />
Ken let out a soft moan at the touch of his boyfriend’s strong hand, his cock twitching, and felt another soft tug on his balls. Jeff’s big hand gently stroked the tip of Ken’s cock through the tent in his jeans. Ken wriggled a little at the pressure, it felt like Jeff was pressing his cock back into him slightly. <br />
<br />
Then Jeff pat Ken’s thigh.<br />
<br />
“We’ve got gym next, then History, then free study together.” Jeff’s beard slit into a smile. “It’s all downhill from here babe.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah.” Jeff said softly, smiling up at his boyfriend.<br />
<br />
Then he frowned. Was Jeff always so tall? It was strange, he could swear they were only a few inches apart, but it looked like Jeff towered over him by a foot. <br />
<br />
The bell rang, and the questions disappeared from his mind as he dumped the rest of his lunch and got ready for gym with his boyfriend.<br />
<br />
Gym was hectic. Ken found himself feeling much less co-ordinated than usual today. It was so weird. Like, he’d go for a lay-up and found he couldn’t quite get the basketball into the goal. Er, hoop, or whatever it was called. And his ability to dribble was terrible-he’d actually tripped himself up several times. And then the fat kid blocked him and actually managed to knock Ken off his feet.<br />
<br />
Jeff was there, of course, offering a hand and a smile, but he wasn’t very good at basketball either, being a wrestler. Ken was usually so precise and on point, he was nearly in tears when the game ended. He hit the showers feeling frustrated and angry.<br />
<br />
The water was nice on Ken’s skin, the only thing that brought his mod up after a terrible game.<br />
<br />
“You okay, babe?” Jeff asked as they showered off.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s massive, hairy form towered a foot and half over Ken. That sounded wrong to Ken, but he couldn’t quite figure out why. He was a twunk and the bottom in their relationship. Of course Jeff would be taller. But Ken was pretty sure Jeff hadn’t been that tall.<br />
<br />
While Ken was busy thinking about how odd that was, he felt Jeff’s soft, hairy belly press against his back, the large wrestler’s arms wrapping around Ken’s chest. He could see those thick biceps tense as his lover squeezed him softly.<br />
<br />
Ken let out a sigh, feeling the strange tension he’d felt since discovering Jeff’s height drain from him.<br />
<br />
“That’s it babe.” Jeff growled in Ken’s ear, making the smaller man shiver in delight. Jeff pressed further, and Ken could feel his lover’s thick hardness on the small of his back. “Let’s get you relaxed, okay?”<br />
<br />
Ken let out a soft moan as Jeff entered him. <br />
<br />
He hadn’t realized how much he’d needed this as his boyfriend spread his hole wide. His cock was rigid and his balls ached and churned oddly. As his boyfriend filled him, he could sense that strange yearning inside of him, a need to be filled, but now he realized it wasn’t coming from his rear.<br />
<br />
Before he could dwell too much on it, Jeff’s hands were roaming over his body and tweaking his nipples.<br />
<br />
Little sparks of pleasure and strange aches plagued his chest as his boyfriend pinched and massaged his sensitive nips. Ken moaned, precum drooling from his shaft as his nipples stiffened like tiny erections under Jeff’s touch. Ken brought his hands up and placed them on top of Jeff’s all while Jeff kept kneeding at Ken’s nipples, causing the skin beneath to swell into soft bumps.<br />
<br />
Ken hissed at the jolts of pain and pleasure, completely distracted from the thick shaft stretching his rear. He felt another soft tug on his balls, though he passed it off as natural retraction as Jeff’s hips slammed into him and set them jostling.<br />
<br />
Every tug pulled his flesh, his areolas widening to the size of pepperonis. Soon, two large, feminine looking nipples protruded from his chest. They were almost flush to his muscles, but the big round patches of dark skin seemed out of place on his pale body.<br />
<br />
Ken felt the unfamiliar sensation of a jiggling heat pulsating out of his rock-hard nipples and back into his body, but he was too busy moaning in pleasure as his big boyfriend fucked him silly to care.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s hands roamed downward, squeezing Ken’s cock in his hand. Ken moaned, his hips bucking. It felt like his boyfriend’s hands were bigger around his member than they usually were. Regardless, it felt good, especially when Jeff pulled back the foreskin and rubbed the head of Ken’s dick.<br />
<br />
Strangely, Ken couldn’t remember having a foreskin. He was pretty sure he had been circumcised, but what else was the hood of skin covering the head of his member supposed to be? The hood of skin was tight, pushing his cock back a little.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Jeff thrust and came, flooding Ken’s insides in warm baby batter. A ripple of pleasure radiated from his groin, almost orgasmic, and Ken shuddered and groaned. His balls clenched, aching terribly, and that strange emptiness hadn’t gone away. He longed for something to fill him even with Jeff’s hard cock inside him.<br />
<br />
Jeff pulled out, leaving Ken panting, his cock hard and still feeling oddly needy in spite of his orgasm.<br />
<br />
“There you go babe, now get to History class.” Jeff’s bearded face broke into a grin and he slapped the smaller man’s rather pert ass, ignoring Ken’s visible erection.<br />
<br />
Ken yelped and hurried to his locker, getting changed just as the bell rang. He had to run to class, his nipples feeling sore and tender every time he shifted and the fabric brushed against them. When he sat down and got out his notes, he paused.<br />
<br />
Had his nipples always protruded like that?<br />
<br />
The more he looked down at them, tenting his shirt like tiny hills, he got the oddest feeling they should look… different. Flat? No, maybe a better word would be nonobtrusive. He felt self-conscious and glanced around, but no one seemed to notice or care about the bumps on his chest.<br />
<br />
History was boring, but Ken tried to concentrate.<br />
<br />
It was hard to, though, because his body just felt off. His insides squirmed and coiled inside of him, sliding around each other. He flipped his hair out of his face, brushing a strand behind his ear and shifted in his seat as his hips popped and widened.<br />
<br />
He tried to ignore his ass as it strained against the back of his jeans, the soft flesh filling his tight denim shorts to near overflowing. That was kinda uncomfortable, but he should’ve worn better fitting jeans today, so it was kinda his fault. Then he felt churning in his stomach that slowly built over the next five minutes to an almost unbearable amount of discomfort. Ken grit his teeth and hissed as sudden pressure deep in his belly made his abdominals cramp. <br />
<br />
Ken hips flared and popped, and the sudden pressure abated.<br />
<br />
He panted, running his hands of his widened hips and his soft skin. Ken felt the cold caress of air from the nearby air conditioning system on his tummy and realized he was exposed. He tried to pull his shirt down but it was like he’d worn a shirt that was far too small. His bare stomach and belly button were cold for a few minutes and Ken felt extremely embarrassed, but eventually he adjusted to it and kinda just forgot about his tight jean shorts and short shirt.<br />
<br />
The bell finally rang, and Ken let out a sigh of relief, standing and hissing again as the fabric of his shirt brushed his erect nipples.<br />
<br />
He walked uncomfortably to the private study room he and Jeff signed out every day in a quiet corner of the library. His chest jostled and the feeling was almost painful, like his dick after he stroked off. The sensitivity of his nips were off the charts, and not in a good way. <br />
<br />
Ken grit his teeth and soldiered on, trying not to move his chest much.<br />
<br />
The entire way, he had a boner and it was just as uncomfortable. The weird hood of skin on his dick was like an elastic band pulling his cock back in spite of his raging erection. Ken glanced down and instead of seeing the normally sizeable tent his cock would make, there was merely a gentle bump. He adjusted himself and felt a soft tug on his balls again.<br />
<br />
He let out a quiet moan as he let his balls go. They didn’t drop very far. What was up with his body today?<br />
<br />
Ken entered the library and shuffled to the small cubicle lounge in the far corner where Jeff was waiting for him. Jeff looked up and grinned at him, the big burly young man looking as handsome as always. Ken’s boyfriend was sitting on the couch in front of a low desk, going over some homework. It was how they usually began things, though the privacy their little room afforded them often led to other things. Ken grinned back, aware of how strained his erection was right now and hoping Jeff would help him with it.<br />
<br />
Maybe it was, like, late onset phimosis or something.<br />
<br />
“How was History?” Jeff asked, patting the cushion next to him.<br />
<br />
Ken sat down, his chest jiggling oddly, the nipples more pronounced and now the flesh seemed strangely swollen beneath them.<br />
<br />
“My chest is feeling sore and achy, my dick and balls are weird and uncomfortable, and everything feels too tight.” Ken complained, the strain in his crotch making his voice higher and lighter than normal.<br />
<br />
“Oh.” Jeff examined Ken in concern. “Allergies? A hard workout?”<br />
<br />
“You… you didn’t do anything with the Chronivac, right?” Ken asked, trying to find a comfortable spot on the couch.<br />
<br />
“What? No, sweetheart, I’d never use it on you without permission.” Jeff said, his eyes wide and honest. “That Chronivac is making you paranoid.”<br />
<br />
“It’s just…” Ken licked his swollen lips. “I got a message saying things were being corrected when I checked the computer this morning.”<br />
<br />
“For not giving me free will?” Jeff frowned. “But we double-checked. I’m completely under my own cognizance.”<br />
<br />
“I know, maybe it was sent in error, but I’ve just felt off today.” Ken replied. “Do I look… different to you?”<br />
<br />
“You look prettier than yesterday.” Jeff said solemnly before breaking into a smile when Ken looked horrified. “I’m kidding, I’m kidding! Let’s finish some homework, get your mind on something else.”<br />
<br />
Ken took a deep breath and nodded.<br />
<br />
He started doing homework with Jeff, the bigger man pulling him close and gently rubbing Ken’s shoulder. Ken let himself relax and almost forgot about how weird he was feeling. He was looking over his history assignments when he realized his chest was moving. At first he dismissed it as the normal rise and fall of breathing, but it was like they were staying in place when his chest fell, blocking his view a little more with every breath.<br />
<br />
Ken watched as his fat nipples lazily shifted on his chest and pushed further out, as though they were being filled with fat. He reached up, hefting his small, warm breasts and felt the skin pull along his body as his chest swelled further. Ken could feel the weight of them pulling at his back as they grew.<br />
<br />
“W-what?” Ken sputtered, staring down at his tits as they continued to grow into rather respectable D-cups.<br />
<br />
Jeff glanced at him and stared at Ken’s chest. “Still achy, huh? Let me help you.”<br />
<br />
“No! I… This is-” Ken struggled to tell his boyfriend that he shouldn&#39;t have breasts, that he was a man.<br />
<br />
Jeff slid his big hands under Ken’s shirt and gently massaged the new growths. <br />
<br />
“Oh!” Ken gasped, feeling his boyfriends meaty hands on his rather sore tits.<br />
<br />
Ken just smiled and rubbed and squeezed Ken’s new mounds. It felt wonderful as the ache was slowly kneaded away under his lover’s touch. Jeff rubbed the tip of Ken’s nipples and warmth trickled down his shirt. Sparks of pleasure leapt into Ken’s brain, traveling from his breasts and up his spine. He shivered in delight, his little cock twitching and drooling in his silken panties.<br />
<br />
“There. Forgot to wear your bra today?” Jeff asked, pulling his hand back.<br />
<br />
“But I…” Ken paused, as the thought of needing a bra seemed so foreign.  But the more he thought about it, the more he realized that he had a drawer full of them.  Why would he… unless?<br />
<br />
“M-must have.” Ken shivered, stifling a moan.<br />
<br />
All thoughts of wrongness had left his mind, but his big breasts were now blocking his view of their notes. Wet spots stained his shirt around his nipples. He really should have worn his bra if he was lactating like this, it was so embarrassing.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, babe, I have another shirt back in my locker you can use.” Jeff said, clearly having noticed his little mess.<br />
<br />
Ken nodded, his mind focused on their homework again. <br />
<br />
As he did, he felt a pinch in his crotch and squirmed. There came another gentle tug on his balls. Ken let out a quiet moan but tried to ignore it. Another tug, and then another. His testicles felt like they were churning, and these constant tugs were-Nnf! They felt really nice. Ken spread his legs as the tugs grew more insistent. <br />
<br />
“Aaah…haaah…” Ken moaned, laying his head back on the couch and relaxing, enjoying the sensation. His nipples were hard, pressing lewdly against his shirt, and a wet stain was forming on the front of his lightly tented jeans. “Mmmm…fuuuh…”<br />
<br />
“Someone’s feeling horny, huh?” Jeff smiled.<br />
<br />
Jeff leaned over and pulled down Ken’s booty shorts.<br />
<br />
Ken looked down and gasped. His cock was barely two inches long, the foreskin taut around the pink, glistening head. Below it, looking scrunched, were his balls. They pulsed fitfully, the skin of his scrotum tight and smooth. There came another tug and his cock twitched, spurting some cum. His whole groin felt wet and delightfully moist.<br />
<br />
“Lookin’ good, Kayla.” Jeff smiled ashe stared at Ken’s crotch.<br />
<br />
Ken opened his mouth to say something, only to start panting rather heavily as he felt his hard member start slowly leaking seed into his underpants as his balls continued to be tugged and ache pleasantly. <br />
<br />
“What’s looking good?! Did you do this on purpose or… Nngh!” Ken curled up a little as he felt an extra hard spurt spill into his clothes. There was a visible stain on his pants, and the smell of spunk filled the air.<br />
<br />
“Having fun?” Jeff asked, his grin now wide like a Cheshire cat’s.<br />
<br />
“It mostly just… aches, itchy too.” Ken answered as he pulled himself away from Jeff and moved to stand up, feeling a trail of his jizz rolling down his leg inside his pants. &quot;Mostly it feels like being jerked off when I don&#39;t have any more steam,&quot; he says... &quot;I think I just literally blew my entire load.&quot; <br />
<br />
“Oh, I think you’ve got some left.” Jeff replied with a smirk.<br />
<br />
Ken’s big, hairy boyfriend reached down, placing a hand on Ken’s crotch and smiled. He kneaded Ken’s taut orbs against Ken’s pelvis. The pulses-Ngf! Sped up, making Ken moan out load. Teasingly, Jeff began to run a coy finger up and down the tight cleft between his clenching testes. Then he flicked the sensitive nub of Ken’s cockhead.<br />
<br />
“J-Jeff!” Ken cried, his voice high and wavery.<br />
<br />
His balls felt so tight, their pleasure condensing into a single point.<br />
<br />
“You’re so beautiful, Kayla.” Jeff whispered, kissing Ken passionately.<br />
<br />
Ken wanted to protest, tell him that wasn’t his name, but instead he found himself kissing his bearded lover back, his dainty fingers fumbling with Jeff’s belt. Jeff’s pants soon slipped free, Jeff’s beer can-thick footlong dong exposed. They embraced and Ken felt himself being pushed down on the couch.<br />
<br />
He could feel that big cock sliding in between the increasingly deep groove between his balls. <br />
<br />
The big hairy man on top of him made him feel vulnerable and exposed, yet it was a huge turn on. His tits were hard and his groin was sending warm pleasurable waves through his entire body with every brush of Jeff’s fat dick against Ken’s slick groin.<br />
<br />
“I-I love you.” Ken replied.<br />
<br />
The bulbous tip of Jeff’s huge cock pressed into Ken’s groin. As the fat dick kissed Ken’s groove, there was an incredible sense of pressure. Ken’s balls quivered, the tugs having pulled them tight to his crotch. He shuddered in need. His boyfriend’s bearded face split into a wide grin.<br />
<br />
“I love you too, babe,” Jeff kissed Ken one last time before he flexed his hip and pushed.<br />
<br />
For a brief moment, the pressure built to a crescendo. <br />
<br />
Ken looked down just in time to watch the tip of his cock get swallowed by the foreskin and tuck itself into her groin. Jeff’s fat cock parted her groin, the flesh splitting painlessly as the big cock stretched her forming folds apart. In a spasm of pleasure, her balls were pulled inside along with the cock. <br />
<br />
Kayla threw her head back and let out a feminine moan.<br />
<br />
She squirted, her forming pussy squelching as Jeff pulled out. Her groin was covered in a seed of old seed, her penis rounding into a little dot of a clitoris hidden above her delicate folds. Jeff thrust again and she moaned as he stretched her new pussy out. Already she could feel smooth inner muscles massage his big cock. <br />
<br />
Jeff leaned down and their lips met.<br />
<br />
Their tongues entwined as he hugged her to him. She enjoyed the gentle scratch of his rough beard on her smooth face, the way his larger body engulfed hers as he thrust and filled her. Her legs were weak and spread wide by his maleness.<br />
<br />
Kayla wriggled and writhed in new-found pleasure as Jeff opened her up. Her mind didn&#39;t even try to make sense of the pulsing, deep sensuous sensations. As Jeff plunged into her, she ground her hips against him, her slender fingers rubbing the tiny button of flesh above her seething entrance. Lances of pure bliss shot through her. Kayla’s newly formed depths shuddered and she realized she was almost there already and desperately pressed him deeper into her.<br />
<br />
Jeff hugged her tight as she pressed in, bucking faster and faster. <br />
<br />
It was so slick inside of her, and instead of the clench and tightness of her anus, this felt smooth but grinding. Every time they rocked together, she felt an electrifying jolt of contact, a building warmth emanating from the bottom of her womb. Kayla felt Jeff’s muscles begin to spasm as the big man thrust deeper and deeper. Deeper and faster they rocked together until she felt the surging pressure of her orgasm hit her like a tsunami.<br />
<br />
Her anus contracted, eyes dilated, and her back arched while Jeff  grasped handfuls of her luscious hair as their tongues wrapped around one another.<br />
<br />
Kayla’s toes clenched, nipples standing erect against his, fingers rubbing dizzying circles of pleasure from her clits as her feminine lust leaked out in jolts onto the couch under them. Her bucking became faster and smaller and then slower, in spurts, expecting the amazing feelings rolling through her in waves to end soon.<br />
<br />
But it didn&#39;t stop, and she threw her head back and let out a plaintive, desperate cry at her first female orgasm.<br />
<br />
Her depths were on fire as intense contractions rippled through her. The intense bliss rolled through her, intense minute of unbelievable pleasure; not knowing where she ended and Jeff began as his cock undulated and spasmed in waves that shook from her folded ears, to her pert nipples, to her abused clitoris, to her trembling depths, to her clenched anus, all the way to the tingling roots of her hair.</p>
