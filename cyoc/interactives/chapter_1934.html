<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Johnny woke up on the floor and felt weird, his whole body ached as if he had been playing real hard or something, he vaguely remembered the transformation his body had gone through and he figured it was just a weird dream but as he opened his eyes in the now lit room he saw what his body looked like. It was muscular and big like his big brother Ryan's was, he smiled as he thought about what Ryan would think about him now! He wouldn't need Ryan to help him, or defend him, he could do that for himself now!
<br />
<br />  John got up and stretched his now long and muscular legs, he rubbed the new growth of hair that now covered his legs, he scratched his now hairy chest and felt the beard stubble on his now strong angular jaw. He felt the out side of his now impossibly small tight fitting underwear and felt his new thick pubic hairs pushing out the fabric of his underwear. His now huge cocks head hung out side one of the now torn leg openings of his briefs, it was to large to keep in the small kid sized underwear he still had on. John went back into the room where he had picked up the tee shirt and went to the dresser and opened it.
<br />
<br /> He saw clothes that were surly adults and he looked down at his arms and his body and saw that he was at least adult size himself now, so he grabbed out some underwear and looked at the size, size 36-38 large they said and he smiled and tried them on they fit! Johnny smiled again. He was as big as Ryan, if not bigger! He thought as he rummaged through the other drawers for a pair of pants, he didn't see any, so he just decided he would go out in the underwear and find the rest of the group. He couldn't wait to see their expressions on their faces when they saw how big he was now! He didn't care if they saw him in his underwear either! Besides these weren't his underwear. They were some big guys underwear, and now they fit him perfectly!
<br />
<br />  Johnny, who now looked more like a guy named John, left the bedroom and headed down the hall. He heard the sounds of what he thought was a kid crying, and mumbling to himself, it was coming from one of the doors that lined the grand hall of the mansion. John saw one of the doors was slightly opened and the sounds were coming from that room. So he went towards it and stooped and listened from outside of it. He could hear what sounded like a little kid saying &quot;This is just a dream! I'm not a little kid this I sent happening to me!&quot; Johnny thought the voice seemed familiar to him, was it one of his friends from Clayton Elementary school? Who is it he thought? He listened some more, and he heard the kid say, &quot;IM RYAN BRENTWORTH! And I'm 20 years old! IM NOT A FUCKING LITTLE KID!!!&quot; Johnny jumped back away from the door! Was that Ryan in there? It couldn't be it sounded like a kids voice! That couldn't be his big brother Ryan's voice? But he did say he was Ryan Brentworth! How many more Ryan Brentworths could there be? Especially here in this old house! It had to be Ryan! Johnny's face lit with utter joy at that thought.
<br />
<br />  Johnny thought about the fact that he was now this big guy, and then thought what he would do if Ryan was a kid now! And what if he was the big brother now! Wouldn't that be a gas to see his big brother having to be defended by him, instead of the other way around! Johnny thought as he went back to the door and pushed it open. He was surprised at what he saw. Inside the room was a small skinny kid sitting on the floor with huge jeans on, they were all bunched up around his feet. The kid was crying and fumbling with the excess fabric of the pant legs and crotch area, of the jeans, the kid had big underwear around his waist line that he had apparently pulled up to cover himself. He looked up at Johnny with red tear filled eyes and just starred at Johnny. &quot;Who are you?&quot; Ryan said. &quot;I'm Johnny Brentworth! Who are you?&quot; Johnny said as he went in the room.
<br />&quot;YOU.. YOU.. YOUR JOHNNY?&quot; Ryan said with a look of shock on his now cute boyish face. &quot;HOW?! THIS CANT BE HAPPENING!&quot; Ryan said as he stood up and looked way up into the tall young guys masculine face. Ryan had to hold up his underwear as he stood there.
<br /> &quot;Are you Ryan?&quot; Johnny said and a great big smile formed on his face as he said it! Ryan's eyes dropped as he heard his own high pitched childish sounding voice, a low desperate sigh came out of the kid sized Ryan. Johnny started to laugh! &quot;LOOK AT YOU MAN! HA HA HA... YOUR PINT SIZED!!&quot; Johnny said. Ryan looked up and clenched his tiny hands into fist, he was so frustrated at what had happened to him! Johnny just laughed as he watched his once bigger brother just start to cry like a little kid would.
<br />
<br />  Ryan looked back up at the now muscular Johnny, and gave him an angry glare. &quot;FUCK YOU JOHNNY!&quot; Ryan said as he stepped out of the over sized jeans and ran for the big bed and tried to crawl up on it. Johnny watched him and laughed again, he couldn't believe this little skinny kid was once his big muscular brother Ryan! It was just too much, he was loving it. Johnny looked down at Ryan's jeans and then down at his underwear clad waist and laughed again as he reached down and started to put the jeans on. Ryan had managed to crawl up onto the bed and was watching his now huge little brother getting dressed in his jeans! &quot;What the fuck are you doing Johnny those are my jeans!&quot; Ryan said, Johnny smiled as he heard the way his brothers voice now sounded. &quot;THEY FIT!!&quot; Johnny said. He was happy to be covered up, Ryan on the other hand couldn't believe his eyes. His jeans did fit Johnny now, and they even looked abit tight on him as well! &quot;Take those off there MINE you little bastard!&quot; Ryan said he was furious and jealous at the same time. 
<br />&quot;Little? Who you calling little pip squeak?&quot; Johnny said and smiled again, &quot;And its John not Johnny anymore! You better call me that too or I'll kick your skinny little butt Ryan!&quot; John said, he was feeling very cocky all of the sudden. He had come to the realization that he was the big guy now! Ryan was in shock as he realized that his once little brother could actually do what he said he would, if he wanted to and he couldn't do anything to stop him, it hit him like a brick, and he started to bawl again he tried to stop but he was beginning to feel like the kid he now looked like.
<br />
<br />  John looked at his once older brother, he looked so ridicules in the huge underwear he had on, and thought it was cool to see him so defenseless, then it hit him he would bring Ryan his old clothes and then parade his now diminutive big &quot;little!&quot; Brother around in front of all his now bigger friends. Johnny laughed again and said, &quot;Just wait right here Ryan, Ill be right back!&quot; Johnny was still laughing as he left to go get his old clothes. Ryan was so pissed and afraid that he just sat down and cried even more. 
<br />
<br />  Johnny came back in the room, and threw his old underwear and his shorts over at his now kid sized big brother and smiled, &quot;Put those on Ryan!&quot; John said sternly. Ryan look at Johnny's clothes and glared back up at his brother. &quot;NO WAY! I'm not going to wear your little clothes! NO WAY MAN!&quot; Ryan said trying to sound and act bigger then he was.
<br /> Johnny went over to the bed and grabbed the Ryan's now frail little bicep and forcibly dressed him as Ryan fought as hard as he could but to no avail, he was far to weak to defend himself now, and Johnny eventually won their little fight, he dressed his once bigger brother in his old clothes. Ryan had a look of utter defeat on his boyish face as he stood there wearing Johnny's old underwear and shorts, even they were to big for his body now especially the underwear that had been stretched out as Johnny grew big! &quot;God Damn! Your not even as big as I was Ryan! YOUR A FUCKIN WIMP! HA HA HA HA!
<br />
<br /> Johnny walked away laughing as Ryan looked down and saw how big even Johnny's once little clothes looked on him. Ryan just hung his head down and crawled down off the bed, it seemed even larger then it did when he climbed up onto it, Ryan felt that same weird tingling in his body again and he felt the same feeling of falling again as he tried to walk towards Johnny. Johnny's shorts that Ryan had on now, started to slip down his thighs as he walked and he had to reach down and pull them back up. Ryan knew he was getting smaller again and his eyes widened as he watched the bed get bigger as he got smaller!
<br />
<br /> &quot;NWOO PWEASE GWOD NWOO! I DWONT WAN BWEE A WIDDEL BWOY AGWAN! PWEASE MMWAKE ITWIT STWOP GWOD PWEEASSEE! Ryan screamed in a very small child's voice. Ryan threw his now tiny hands to his mouth, he couldn't believe he sounded like that and even his speech patterns were those of a very small child's now. HWEP MWE! Ryan said as he fell to his knees and just cried! Johnny was loving watching his big brother as he slipped from child sized to toddler size! Poor Ryan's bladder gave out on him as he got smaller and a large puddle of his own urine flowed out from around his shrinking body. Ryan knew he was still a twenty year old in his mind, but now he was sounding and reacting to the world as a toddler would. If he didn't stop getting younger he would be in diapers again! Ryan saw his own piss spreading from him, he was so frustrated and angry that he just started to cry! He knew he had no control over his bladder anymore. Johnny looked at his big brother and thought of how cool it was that he wasn't the big strong big brother anymore. He was now a small defenseless pants pissing toddler. Johnny just laughed at him instead of helping him. 'What would his friends think of their once big jock friend now!' Thought the once small defenseless little brother,now he was the big muscular brother named 'John!'</p>
