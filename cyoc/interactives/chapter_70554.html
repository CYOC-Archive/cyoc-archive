<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Was it satisfying? Ty gagged at the mosquito musk hanging around him. Hanging around him because his step-mother clung to him begging for mercy. Ty ran to the bathroom and looked at his face in the mirror. His eyes were dark, cruel. Is this what he's become? Petty and vindictive? Blessed with ultimate power and he squanders it on revenge fantasies? <br />
<br />
Ty remembered reading in class about the Ring of Gyges. An argument proposed by Plato. It was that if a man could be made invisible, he would be corrupted by it, since no man could resist the urge to misuse his new found powers. Did he have the seed of evil inside him? Wasn't he told all his life to turn the other cheek? <br />
<br />
Ty retched. And then again. Rushing beside the toilet he purges his bowels,vomit stinging teeth and throat. He was ashamed, ashamed of himself and guilty for what he's done.<br />
<br />
June was an awful person, but did it really justify him consigning her to a life like this? She could be struggling in a spider's web right now, all because he was drunk on power that he didn't even deserve. Ty cursed God for giving him this gift. Wasn't he only human?<br />
<br />
Ty willed the June-Mosquito back. She buzzed on the counter, flying around Ty incessantly. Ty willed her back to normal. And unlike last time, he made sure that it was instantaneous. He then willed her into a deep sleep, looking at the gratitude and thanks in her eyes.<br />
<br />
Fast asleep, it was time to find a new punishment for June, something less horrifying. Ty snapped his fingers. He had it!<br />
<br />
But first, he teleported June and himself to the living room, where he put on her on the couch.<br />
<br />
With a wave of his hand, her clothes disappear. June was vain, very vain indeed. She was a beautiful woman in her mid-forties. She had the oh-so-typical look of the woman who's afraid of aging and does everything in her power to conceal it.<br />
<br />
Ty decided that he would &quot;improve&quot; June. And you know what they say, like mother, like daughter. But Dusty was a pretty giraffe-girl now, all thanks to him. She was a nice piece of work, but the set was incomplete. Instead of making Dusty a freak, why not make her family anthropomorphic giraffes? Not really punishment, since he'd make the world accept them like that, but more like a fresh start for them. And he'd continue the work he began with Dusty by changing June. <br />
<br />
First, Ty decided that he was going to make June younger. He'd make her 33. That way she'd have many happy years ahead of her. Maybe even another child. Ty willed it and it became reality. Years poured off of June, tendrils of smoke hissing from her body as the changes happened. Wrinkles vanished, skin tightened and a dreamy smile grew on June. Fat melted away and any stretchmarks disappeared. Some deposits of cellulite on her rear evaporated. Her breasts, a large D-Cup became firmer and succulent like melons. Her bright red hair began to curl again, gaining beautiful body and shine as it grew to her waist. Ty began thinking, and decided on a big change.<br />
<br />
June's breasts began getting smaller, daintier. Her breasts decreased in size until they could only fill an A-Cup bra. Women were always too focused on appearances. And that caused unfortunate stress. But the new June was going to be modest and happy. Who needed large breasts when you had a great personality? Ty rewrote June. She would be demure, eager and enthusiastic around the house. She would do her work diligently. And always put the needs of others before her own. She would be the perfect mother. Someone you could trust and confide in. Someone who would offer you unending companionship. Someone with deep reserves of love and charity. Ty made it so that she wasn't married for appearances, but for her personality.<br />
<br />
Pleased with his changes so far, Ty decided to continue. It was time for June to follow in her daughter's footsteps and became a giraffe-woman. Ty willed it, and it became reality. June began growing in size, like someone pulling a piece of Taffy. Her proportions became slightly lanky as she was stretched all the way to nine feet tall.Her neck was thick and two feet long. But with a body like that, it looked like she would tire easily. And the new June was going to be a very busy woman. She would have fundraisers to go to, charity galas to attend, and sick kids in the hospital to read to. So Ty focused on June, and began putting a little bit more meat on her bones. She plumped a little, but only for a moment. Because that small layer of fat was being toned into muscle. Not hard like a body builder, but smooth and refined. Power and energy for her new life. Her stomach was sculpted into a faint six-pack.<br />
<br />
More changes followed. Soon tiny golden hairs began to poke through June's skin. They grew longer with an alarming rate, becoming extremely thick. Her breasts were now little more than curves that accentuated her appearance. The lips of her womanhood were concealed from Ty's prying eyes. Ty ran his hands over June's fur. It was soft and luxurious. None of the finest furs in the world could compare to the elegance of this golden coat, four inches long and decadently thick. Ty whispered in Junes ears, altering reality as he spoke. Her fur was her favorite part of her body. And nothing made her happier than when someone decided to pet her astounding fur. To top is all off the traditional patches of giraffe fur began sprouting up on her new hide. They were a dark orange, unlike her daughters' brown ones.<br />
<br />
June of course looked more like a very tall and hairy woman right now. So it was time to create that beguiling combination of woman and giraffe. Her fingers became thicker and her fingernails became black and hard. It led to an appearance of cloven hands. But in appearance only. Ty made sure that she would have complete human function. No, even better. She could match any seamstress or tailor now with the new found dexterity that Ty channeled into her. Her feet followed suit, becoming more cloven in appearance. She would have trouble wearing shoes now, so Ty made sure that June now preferred wearing sandals instead. As a finishing touch, a dainty two foot long tail sprouted above her rear, topped off with a tuft of dark orange fur.<br />
<br />
It was time for the face now. Ty saved the best for last. First, Ty decided to keep her green eyes. Not biologically accurate, but since when were creatures like these? It would make her look exotic and enticing. Ty focused and her face pulled in a snout. She would have no trouble speaking, but it was certainly striking. Smirking, Ty opened her mouth and gazed at her new tongue. More than a foot long and a dark blue. Ty cautiously packed it back into her mouth. A few touch-ups made sure that her face was properly covered in the right amount of fur. Ty grew her little giraffe horns and was left with only one thing; her hair. It was red and curly, and didn't match her fur. So Ty made it the dark orange of her fur splotches. He then made it thicker and curlier before growing it down to her thighs. A fitting mane for the queen of the household.<br />
<br />
Ty gazed at his masterpiece. An astounding combination of woman and giraffe, tastefully exotic and inviting to the eye. But appearances were only skin deep. The real change was within. June was a new person. A better person. <br />
<br />
Ty ran up to his room and closed the door. He made June forget all about her becoming a mosquito. All that she would remember is her new life as a kind giraffe woman with a loving father and daughter. With a foster-son, of course. And Ty made it reality. A blur washed over him as the universe coped with his desires. <br />
<br />
Ty blinked. His room looked the same. Looking up, he realized the ceiling was much higher, to accommodate his sister and mother. His door was similarly enhanced in size. Exiting, Ty was a little astounded. The house made him feel like a kid again. The proportions were completely non-human.Ty finally decided that it was time to wake June up. Waiting for five very long minutes, he finally left his room. Going down the stairs, he made sure not to fall down the larger steps. He heard downstairs a playful humming. Scurrying into the living room, Ty saw his new mother dusting the much larger mantle. She turned to Ty and smiled.<br />
<br />
She said in a sweet voice &quot;Hello Ty! How's your homework going? I'll have dinner ready at seven, we're having Caesar Salad.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ty smiled &quot;Sure thing, Mom.&quot; He turned around, eager to explore the rest of the house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there mister, don't think you can get off so easily!&quot; Ty's mother adopted a playfully stern voice.<br />
<br />
She dropped her feather duster and scooped up Ty in her arms and gave him a great big hug, giving him a ticklish peck on the cheek before letting him off on his way. As Ty left, she continued her housework,humming a cheerful tune.</p>
