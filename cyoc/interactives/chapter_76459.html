<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I sat quietly in the waiting room while the doctors were patching Fred up. Eventually one of the doctors came out and approached me.<br />
<br />
&quot;How is he?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The cut that the lamp did to him was fairly deep, and I'd imagine the metal wasn't super strong or was old enough that it had become brittle,&quot; the doctor answered, &quot;there were some metal fragments that we removed. Given the depth of the wounds, it wouldn't surprise me if someone would have mistaken it for a dog bite or something like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did he need stitches?&quot; I wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;We put some stitches in, that should hold it together so long as he doesn't strain that arm,&quot; the doctor answered, &quot;the big thing was where the light was in the lamp. It was apparently on when the guy hit him with it, and it burned some of his flesh, and we also had to remove shards of glass as well. They're mostly putting on the bandages. I would suggest you stop by our pharmacy here in the hospital for the necessary ointments for the burns.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; I nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Also, we've taken the liberty of calling the police, both you and your friend will be expected to talk to them,&quot; the doctor answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;The police?&quot; I asked, half remembering what Night had said.<br />
<br />
&quot;The man's told us he watched a Devon Lycos bite his wife and kill her like he was some vampire worshiper or something with his wife and secretary assisting,&quot; the doctor answered, &quot;that is murder.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if he cleans up?&quot; I asked, &quot;wouldn't it be just Fred's word against his?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That you might want to ask the police, but speaking scientifically, you can't just clean away blood,&quot; the doctor answered, &quot;You may not see it, but there were always be some residue that you can't see... and if your friend can identify Devon Lycos in a lineup, that wouldn't matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; you said weakly.<br />
<br />
You then quietly paced for a few moments while waiting for Fred to come out. Part of you was now wondering over potential problems. The doctor seemed fairly certain that the police could find evidence to prove guilt, but that might take awhile, or would be dependent on Fred picking Devon out of a lineup. The second option would mean that Devon would have to be caught, but if he didn't want to reveal the existence of lycanthropy to the police tonight, he wouldn't stick around. It would probably mean the coming pack meeting would be at a different place.<br />
<br />
The other thing that concerned me was what Night and Terri were up to. True, I didn't know much about Devon as an Alpha Male werewolf, but from Terri and Night I did know that if I started a fight with him, unless Terri and Night helped and the rest of the pack stood by, I'd be killed as Devon was &quot;bigger and stronger&quot; than I was and would surely defend his &quot;right&quot; to keep his she-wolves to himself. So what idea had they had? Night wasn't keen on biting anyone else, as even if we got to split our pack off from Devon's, having an additional male would lead to trouble. And even if they'd changed their minds, Fred wouldn't be able to help tonight. The fact that it was still the full moon could allow us to use it and sex to bring our wolf out... but biting Fred would put him unconscious for the rest of the day and much of the night, by which point it'd be too late for him to transform.<br />
<br />
My thoughts were interrupted as I finally saw Fred come out into the waiting room. He was wearing a donated shirt from the hospital that looked a little big on him, but it covered up the bandages that were surely protected his wound.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now, off to see the cops, and then home,&quot; Fred sighed, &quot;and thanks John.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Going home might not be a good idea,&quot; I told him, &quot;I think Devon might still come after you in some way. If he sent his girlfriend after you, he could very well try again... and we both know he's a smart businessman. He'll probably know that your witnessing the crime will be enough to allow the police to start an investigation, at least, and won't be at work to set up some new scheme to get you...&quot; my voice then became a little bit weaker, but still loud enough for Fred to hear, &quot;to get to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To get to you?&quot; Fred asked slowly, &quot;you're making it sound like some sort of James Bond plot or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not James Bond,&quot; I told him, &quot;but something else... something best told in private.&quot;<br />
<br />
I spotted a nearby restroom and ushered him to it. It wasn't a big one and typically was built to serve one person at a time, and I got the odd sense that I was getting some odd looks as I ushered Fred in.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what is this?&quot; Fred asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What would you say if I were to tell you that you weren't too far off when you compared Devon to a vampire?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Fred managed a very weak laugh, showing that he didn't want to laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Devon isn't a normal human,&quot; I told him, &quot;it's because of that that he was physically able to do what he did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So he's what, a vampire or something?&quot; Fred asked, sounding half frustrated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Different movie monster,&quot; I said slowly, &quot;think werewolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Werewolves?&quot; Fred asked, &quot;You got to be kidding me? You're moving me in here for this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm serious,&quot; I told him, &quot;they are real. They try to hide from humanity as much as they can because they don't want to be shot and killed by some frightened human...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how do you know all this?&quot; Fred asked, disbelief clear in his voice, &quot;I suppose you'e going to say that you've secretly been one for years now? Right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, only about one day,&quot; I said weakly.<br />
<br />
He looked at me as if I'd grown another arm suddenly. He clearly didn't believe me. I sighed and then began to explain more of the &quot;secret&quot; dates I'd been having with Terri since the divorce. I had let it slip to him once before that I was seeing Terri again, and he did joke with me on the whole &quot;why did you divorce her&quot; track, but I didn't tell him about how different our relationship was and how truly sexual it was. It culminated in my telling him about having the date with Terri early, seeing &quot;American Werewolf in London,&quot; watching her transform, being willingly bitten, then recovering and transforming for the first time last night. He didn't look like he believed me.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you're trying to cheer me up with ghost stories, it's not working,&quot; Fred answered, &quot;overwhelming sexual, which I'll never get again... but it's not helping.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's the truth, Fred,&quot; I said, almost desperately.<br />
<br />
I was pretty sure I'd blown it, but I really didn't know how to tell him. Getting it out was the only thing I could think of.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, so you're a werewolf,&quot; Fred replied, sounding frustrated and sarcastic, &quot;if you all like to keep secrets, why are you telling me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because Devon is the local pack Alpha male,&quot; I whispered, &quot;he's been using it as his own private harem. From what Night and Terri have told me, I am presently the only male besides Devon. He didn't want Terri to bite me, and I think he's engineered all this to get at me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And why would I be important to getting to you?&quot; Fred questioned, still not believing a word I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I got a call from him earlier this afternoon, it's what got me to come looking for you,&quot; I said, &quot;he said he knew we were protecting you and letting you do your old job in secret and figured you'd be a good target to get me to make some mistake or make my life miserable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how did he know that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He said he heard us talking when I came in this morning,&quot; I answered.<br />
<br />
Fred sighed and rubbed his head with his good hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;John, I've known you since you started at the company, but unless you suddenly sprout fur and fangs, I'm not going to believe you,&quot; Fred answered, &quot;Let's go tell the police what I saw and what you noticed in your search for me and getting me out, leave out all this werewolf nonsense and take me back to my place.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked at my watch. It presently read 4:01 PM. Still plenty of time before sunset. That might give me time to figure out Terri and Night's plan and prove what I'd just told to Fred.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you come with me back to Terri's dad's place, we might be able to prove it,&quot; I offered, &quot;Please, Fred. I'm certain Devon will try something to get you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; Fred sighed in a frustrated tone, &quot;but no werewolf stuff to the police, alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded and unlocked the bathroom door and went out, where we found the police coming up from the elevator.</p>
