<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I do like boys” she says “actually, before moving there was a boy that I liked in my other school”<br />
<br />
I do feel a little disappointed, but I am not going to mope about it, even if she doesn’t want that kind of relationship, she is still my best friend<br />
<br />
“What happened?” I asked with curiosity<br />
<br />
“Nothing, really” she answered with disappointment “I gave all the right signals and waited for him to ask me out, but he was pretty shy and until the end he didn’t said anything and I had to move out”<br />
<br />
Wow, just 11 years old and already thinking about getting a boyfriend, I don’t remember being like that last time I was 11. “Maybe he didn’t notice” I pondered out loud “young boys don’t think about love that much, I…erm my brother told me so.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe” Hana says reluctantly “but that is not important right now, what I wanted to say is that I am sure I like boys, as for girls… I have never thought much about it… but being with you is nice, I guess.” By the time she finished her sentence, Hana was already turning red.<br />
<br />
I felt happiness surge from within me and a smile plastered on my face.<br />
<br />
“But what about you, do you even like girls?” Hana asked with a pout.<br />
<br />
I was about to answer ‘of course’ but she cut me off with her next words.<br />
<br />
“I have seen you in the gym drooling all over the boys, you like slim guys with a pretty face, right?” I opened my mouth but she continued “fit boys are fine, but when they are too burly they put you off”<br />
<br />
My face was burning with embarrassment, she was right; liking boys was kind of new for me, but guys with those features attracted me the most. “Was I so obvious?” I asked with shame<br />
<br />
“Well, maybe not that obvious for a stranger, but for someone that knows you… mm… yeah.” I was so ashamed that I didn’t want to look at her eyes “because of that I didn’t say anything about our relationship, I wasn’t sure  if you or me wanted… you know… more.” <br />
<br />
I remained silent for a moment, but then looked straight into her eyes. “Do you want to try?” <br />
There was a brief silence, but Hana gave a faint nod and in response to that, I gave her a kiss on her lips. It was only an innocent peck, but I waited nervously to see how she would react. She remained motionless for a few seconds but after processing my action she gave me a peck on my lips on her own.<br />
<br />
Hana’s face was blushing and I have no doubt mine was as well. I once again brought my lips closer and she readily shared hers with me, but this time I pushed my tongue into her mouth. Hana gave a gasp of surprise and I retreated my appendage in fear that I pushed things too much; however, she didn’t break the kiss and sent her own tongue to explore the insides of my mouth.  We wrestled with our tongues and lips for a while only taking a moment to regain our breaths, but after a few minutes of kissing,  we formed a tacit agreement to take turns to each explore the other’s mouth, one moment I would pass my tongue through her gums and the next she would put her tongue beneath mine to touch the floor of my mouth, by this time saliva was not mine or hers but a shared property.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile our hands were not idle; my hands went to her back and with a small use of force, we were squeezed in an embrace, our chests pressed together. Hana’s hands did not hesitate and went directly to my butt where she started to knead my flesh giving me a pleasurable feeling. Hana’s leg started to move and I predicted that she wanted to put it between mine like last time, but today I was faster and pushed my thigh against her pubic area. Hana’s body gave a small twitch and she started to slowly rub herself against my leg.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes of rubbing and kissing I wanted to go to the next level and lowered my hands to touch her pussy, but after realizing what I wanted to do, Hana suddenly stopped me.<br />
<br />
“Wait, I am in my period” Hana said between gasps of pleasure.<br />
<br />
 I stopped for an instant but almost immediately replied. “I don’t really mind”<br />
<br />
“but I do!” my friend said before taking my hand to make sure I would not touch beneath her panties.<br />
<br />
“However, if you really want to touch down there I have something you could do for me” the sweet girl said with a mischievous smile <br />
<br />
                                                                             *************************************<br />
<br />
Unlike when I was a man, my sexual desires were weaker and easier to control… Not!<br />
<br />
I don’t know other girls, but since my sexual desires awakened, no, since Mariah made me cum I have been masturbating around 3 times a week to maintain myself satisfied. Suddenly stopping when I thought I was going to have sex, is not very comfortable; I thought blue balls was only a problem men had, but apparently not, since I am feeling something similar right now.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, for Hana’s sake, I swallowed down my dissatisfaction and followed her to the bathroom to help her with….something <br />
<br />
“Here, take this” she gave a small box. Reading it, I discovered that it was a tampon with an applicator. Why would she give me something like this?<br />
<br />
I was about to ask her, but when I posed my eyes on her she was already taking her skirt off leaving her in her panties, or should I say, my panties, I almost forgot that we swapped earlier  <br />
<br />
She sat on the toilet, lowered her panties and then detached the bloody pad. She folded it in half, wrapped it in toilet paper and threw it away in the trash bin.  With one hand she took another piece of toilet paper and used it to clean the leftover blood outside of her vagina. When she was done she threw the bloody paper down the toilet and looked at me. “Please, help me with that,” she said. My naughty friend then moved her waist and spread her legs for me to have easy access to her pussy. Just in case I didn’t get the idea, she used her index and middle finger to open the lips of her slit wide.<br />
<br />
I blushed and my body started to heat again but I did as I was told. I would like to say that I inserted the tampon quickly and without any fuzz, but in actuality I have never tried this before and I had to ask Hana for instructions. It was not difficult at all, just had to insert the applicator a little in the vaginal opening, press the plunger and when the tampon was fully inside, take the applicator out. A cord was left behind for taking the tampon out for later. My friend’s vagina was as hairless as usual so it was very easy to work without any hair obscuring my vision.<br />
<br />
“yeah, that is how it’s done” Hana said and pretended to be embarrassed, but by this point I knew that she was enjoying herself <br />
<br />
“You seem to have practiced a lot, right? before in school didn’t seem the first time you used a pad either.” I retreated a little so she could stand up from the toilet <br />
<br />
“Yes, I practiced a lot on how to put a pad and watched videos on how to insert a tampon. I haven’t put a tampon in before though, doing it when not on your period is uncomfortable, apparently your vagina is not moist enough,” she says while adjusting her skirt. “Actually, I think that you should start practicing from today so it doesn’t catch you unprepared later.” Hana started rummaging through the bathroom drawers and took out a new sanitary pad which she handed to me.<br />
<br />
I looked dumbfounded to the pad in Hana’s hands with some apprehension but after a moment I strengthened my resolve and decided that it was indeed the time to practice.<br />
<br />
I took off my skirt, lowered my panties and sat on the toilet where Hana previously sat. As soon as I lowered my panties Hana’s eyes fixated on my privates or rather… my pubic hair. It seems that when she previously said that she liked it, she really meant it. As if petting a cat or dog, she reaches with her hand and lets her fingers run through my growing patch or coarse hair.<br />
<br />
I let her have her fun for a moment but afterwards I fixed her in place with a glare. “If you want to start something, then you will have to finish it, you know?”<br />
<br />
“Sorry, sorry, It’s just that it’s so sexy that I lost my mind for a moment, it’s thicker than the last time I checked, right?”<br />
<br />
“Probably” I shrugged my shoulders “It’s not like a keep a record”<br />
<br />
“I wish I had grown some,” Hana sighs. “I guess it’s now a pipe dream with the coming of my period.” At this point her fixation with pubic hair could be called a fetish, every time that I get naked, my friend wants to check and touch it. However she is right, menstruation is actually the sign that says that puberty is about to end for girls, if she didn’t grow any hair by now, she wouldn’t grow any later…maybe; right now my friend is one of the more developed girls, but that will probably change in the coming years. She would probably end up a petite woman like her mother; well, it’s fine, she already told me that she is happy with that.  <br />
<br />
“By the way, should we swap panties again?” I say while looking at ‘my’ underwear, the one I am using actually belongs to Hana<br />
<br />
“mmmm, why don’t we kept each other panties as a memento, today is my special day after all” <br />
<br />
It feels a little immoral, but I accept nonetheless, “That’s fine, now start telling me how to put this” I remind her <br />
<br />
“Oh, right”<br />
<br />
Following Hana’s instructions, I opened the sanitary pad, attached it to my panties and folded the wings to keep it in place. <br />
<br />
“That &#39;s it!” I stood up, put my panties on again and checked myself in the mirror for any problems. After months of my underwear fitting snuggling, right now it feels a little bulky, but I guess it&#39;s just something to get used to…in the future. <br />
<br />
Considering this practice was successful, I lowered my panties again to take out the sanitary pad.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing?” Hana used her hands to keep mine in place and prevent me from removing the pad.<br />
<br />
“We are done right? I am just taking it out” I tilted my head curiously.<br />
<br />
Hana pouted “I have to deal with my period for the next few days and you already want to take the pad out?, you need to have more solidarity!”<br />
<br />
“So, do you want me to match you?” I asked, a little bewildered, I didn’t think she would take this practice that far<br />
<br />
“Yes, let&#39;s do that” Hana smiled happily.<br />
<br />
I thought about refusing, but considering that in the future I would have to deal with this all the same, I just let Hana have it her way.<br />
<br />
                                                                        **************************************************<br />
<br />
The rest of the day, I spent it with Hana quietly. We talked, played some video games and checked on social media, but Hana didn’t have the energy to do anything strenuous. Speaking of social media, I had to create a new account. I wasn’t too into it when I was a boy, but after much encouragement from Hana and my other friends, I now use it regularly.<br />
<br />
During this period, my friend was extra-huggy. It seems that embracing and staying close to me made her feel a little better. I don’t know if the heat that I radiated made her feel better or if it was just that she liked hugs, nonetheless I enjoyed my time with her.<br />
<br />
We also talked a lot about how our relationship would be. Hana admitted that she wanted to get naughty with me, but that she definitely wanted to have a boyfriend in the future. I, for my part, confessed while not sure about wanting a boyfriend,  I would like to feel how it was to have sex with a man. After I saw my sister Mariah enjoying herself with John’s penis, curiosity and anticipation have been ignited within me and I knew that sooner or later I had to try it - not that I told her about my siblings having sex, that was private<br />
<br />
Hana called me a slut and playfully slapped my ass, but we both knew that despite wanting to appear innocent, Hana’s mind was as dirty as mine if not more; I was perfectly fine with being just friends with her until she started to rub her body all over mine, and she was the one that was considering having a ton of babies.<br />
<br />
Finally we decided on having a relationship akin to friends with benefits until one of us had a boyfriend, after that, well, we would talk it out then. Of course, we also promised to tell each other right away if we had sex with another person or found a boyfriend.<br />
<br />
The next day, Saturday, we spent the same way without moving much for Hana’s sake. Hana told her mom about having her period and she congratulated her and showered her with hugs and kisses. She also reminded Hana about some important points about hygiene and being prepared, like having a pad and spare panties in her bag all the time. After the first menstruation, periods can be irregular or even be skipped for 2 or 3 years, because of the unpredictability, being prepared is a must. Hana’s mom let me listen to her conversation anticipating that the information would be useful to me too. It was a little embarrassing, but I wondered if my mom was going to have the same talk with me in the future. <br />
<br />
Later in the day my friend insisted that when it was time for her to change her tampon or pad, that I would change mine as well. I just agreed and enjoyed the fact that she didn’t want to make my practice more realistic by spilling tomato juice inside my panties or something.<br />
<br />
The next day Sunday, Hana was still in her period but she felt good enough to go to the gym. As we exercised we did something very…stereotypical for girls of our age, we talked about what type of boys we liked; it turns out that my friend likes tall men. I thought it was going to be awkward to talk about my preferences for the opposite sex, but the conversation went smoothly and was enjoyable  <br />
<br />
On Monday, I ate breakfast with Hana’s family before her mom and dad went to work. With our bellies now full, I followed her to the bathroom to watch her change her pad and to continue my training and match her, but after entering the bathroom<br />
<br />
“Huh? it stopped? it was about time!” Hana said with a relieved smile. She looked into my eyes and…</p>
