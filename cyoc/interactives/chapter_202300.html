<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty gasped as he blushed a little, seeing his new body in the reflection. To his surprise, he was still the same height as before, but he did notice he was quite muscular. Nothing too extreme, but he definitely had a rather athletic build. In fact, Ty lifted up his now snug fitting shirt up to see his incredible eight pack as he blushed, feeling them up with his free hand as he started getting a little aroused.<br />
<br />
Ty&#39;s new horse body was a lightly dark shade of brown that he really liked the look of. He noticed his hair had grown out quite a bit, now long and black that hung down to his shoulder blades. Ty usually hated having long hair, and yet... this majestic mane suited him. His eyes were now a deep, gorgeous emerald-green, and he had some hair on his chin that only seemed to compliment his appearance. Of course, he also noticed his long, black-haired tail that nearly reached the floor.<br />
<br />
Pulling off his shirt completely, Ty&#39;s blush only worsened as he saw just how handsome and ripped he was. Before he knew it, he began flexing and posing in the mirror, enjoying his new muscle quite a lot. He loved watching his biceps bulge, the veins bulging out as well with each flex, and just basking in how big he was now. However...<br />
<br />
The tightness in his shorts quickly snapped him out of his flexing as he finally spotted his giant bulge in them... it looked like he had stuffed a volleyball in there as he tried to pull off his shorts... but his new strength only tore the shorts loudly, but Ty was quick to react, closing his eyes and swiftly wishing that no one heard the noise. When he opened his eyes, he saw he was still clutching his now torn in half shorts as he tossed them aside... and saw it.<br />
<br />
One of his favorite parts of all those anthropomorphic horse pictures.<br />
<br />
His cock was now out in the open, practically reaching his knees as Ty&#39;s jaw dropped. It was enormous compared to his puny human cock before his wish as Ty quickly snagged his phone and searched up a couple things. He also wished for a tape measure as he sat down onto the floor in front of the mirror, keeping his phone nearby.<br />
<br />
His balls! He almost forgot about them! They were rather large too, Ty quickly guessing they had to be about the size of baseballs, maybe even bigger. All his new size was turning him on, but Ty wished his cock would stay flaccid until he said so as he grabbed the tape measure.<br />
<br />
One of Ty&#39;s first searches was how long on average a horse cock was. He saw plenty of sizes, but one he saw the most was 50 cm, or around a foot and a half. And yet the tape measure kept going past that, stopping at two feet. Ty couldn&#39;t believe it. His human cock was DEFINTLEY puny compared to this new beast he had swinging inbetween his legs. Ty blushed as he measured his girth next as he already guessed he was about as thick as a soda can. Ty&#39;s eyes only widened as he saw the number. Six inches. Ty was at a loss for words as he blushed.<br />
<br />
But he wasn&#39;t quite done. Oh no. He had to measure just how large he was...<br />
<br />
...at full mast.<br />
<br />
Ty blushed as he gave the command to let his cock start growing hard as he watched the tip of his new equine cock flare up as he couldn&#39;t help but moan, but not before grabbing his shirt and using it to muffle the noise. He watched his cock get longer... longer... thicker... thicker... Ty couldn&#39;t help himself as he gently rubbed his shaft, but that quickly proved to be just enough stimulation as he suddenly shot out a giant rope of precum that splattered onto the mirror, Ty thankfully muffling another moan with his shirt as he blushed. His cock was rather sensitive, he very quickly learned as he made the wise decision to leave it alone until it was finished growing.<br />
<br />
Soon enough it was as Ty shakily got back onto his feet, grabbing his phone as he took a look at the before picture he snapped... and then looking past his phone to see just how much bigger it was fully hard... when Ty made quite the discovery.<br />
<br />
Quickly wiping the mirror off with his torn shorts, Ty gawked at his reflection as not only was he as hard as a rock, but bigger. No, literally, his penis and balls had both doubled in size. Ty could hardly believe his eyes, but sure enough, his junk was twice as big hard then soft.<br />
<br />
Ty&#39;s horny mind was racing with lewd, horny, and arousing thoughts, but the one he decided to act on was...</p>
