<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Still in my dorm for the trip?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah definitely! Can't wait!&quot;<br />
&quot;I know it's going to be awesome!&quot; I was talking to my friend, Jesse, about the Year 9 French trip we'd been <br />
waiting so long for. A trip to Disneyland, a boat ride along the Seine, a trip to the Eiffel Tower! We were as <br />
excited as hell, and it was tomorrow! Me and Jesse were doing a paired dorm since we were good mates. We were <br />
both really smart and were in the top sets for everything. There was only one real difference between us. <br />
Jesse had hit puberty pretty early so was taller and bigger thane me. Not like a bodybuilder but very <br />
athletic. He had cut and strong legs since he was a long jumper, a good six pack and toned arms. I wasn't tiny <br />
but I wasn't like him. I didn't really care but I'd jump at the chance!<br />
<br />
Jesse walked me home and waved me goodbye. I strode in my house and dumped my bag on the floor. I had some <br />
packing to do! I picked out my best clothes, did my best to 'fold' them and shoved them in. Grabbed some toiletries, my iPod and I was done! That was easy. I zipped up the suitcase and placed it downstairs. So I had <br />
packing down and that was it really! I settled down with some dinner and eventually went to bed. I was <br />
exhausted and the quicker I slept the quicker the trip would come. I dozed off after watching some movies and <br />
fell asleep. Waiting for tomorrow to come...<br />
<br />
The next thing I knew was I was awake in a cold sweat. I had no idea why but I was. I calmed down and looked <br />
at the clock. 4:32. Shit. I sighed and got up knowing I wouldn't get back to sleep. I had slept in my boxers <br />
and looked in my mirror. I squeezed my love handles and silently wished my fat would go. To my surprise, it <br />
did! I saw the fat literally melt off my body! I stumbled back. Did I just do that? Or was I dreaming? To test <br />
it I wished again. I wished I was as tall as Jesse. I watched as my bones lengthened and I grew straight up! I <br />
grabbed a tape measure and checked my height. 5ft 9! Oh my god! I could wish for whatever I wanted! I looked <br />
back in the mirror and frowned. I was basically emaciated, and it didn't look or feel good. I wished for a <br />
body like Jesse's. Strong and lean. But also for it to happen one by one. I smiled as 6 bumps formed on my <br />
flat stomach. They toned and grew and my lower abs formed over my bladder. I felt and poked them. Wow. I <br />
looked at my legs and they became wrapped in thick, strong muscle. I slapped them affectionately as they <br />
became cut and toned. I felt a new energy and power in them. I saw to slabs of muscle begin to form over my <br />
broadening chest. They stopped at about an inch off my chest. My shoulders were now broad and put my body in a <br />
small v shape. My arms were last, they thickened and defined. Stopping at 12 inches around. I flexed one and <br />
saw it grow and curve. Woah! I looked just like Jesse. Tall and big! I quickly realised a small mistake. I <br />
wished that no one but Jesse would noticed, oh, and that all my clothes fit. I smiled at my work. And then <br />
noticed another problem. My once average penis was now... not average. I wished for it to grow to about 9 <br />
inches and have fitting balls. I felt a flush of ecstasy and my dick grew. It now left a bulge in my boxers.<br />
&quot;Woah&quot; I said. Then I frowned. My voice was too squeaky now. I wished for my voice to drop and be a bit deeper <br />
than Jesse's. I felt my adam's apple protrude through my throat and my voice deepen. It felt great. I was <br />
turning into a young man. I made one last wish. To have some hair on my body. I lifted up my arm as it itched. <br />
I saw some black hairs sprout through my arm pit and stop at a few inches in size. A messy bush was now under <br />
both my arms and I had a lot more on my legs and... down there. I also had the startings of some stubble and a <br />
slight moustache. Great! I went back to sleep happy knowing a man was asleep now.<br />
<br />
My mom dropped me off at the coach and kissed me goodbye. I jokingly pushed her off and ran to my seat. Jesse <br />
had saved me one.<br />
&quot;Hey ma... Erm, is something different about you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; I said attempting to keep a straight face<br />
&quot;You seem.. bigger? Or taller?&quot;<br />
&quot;I must of hit a little growth spurt&quot;<br />
&quot;No, no. You've gotten some muscle. That kind happen overnight. I bet you've got a six pack or something&quot;<br />
&quot;Yup!&quot; I said lifting up my shirt to show my muscled belly.<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; He said puzzled. I laughed and fell down on the chair. I pulled his head down and gave him a nuggy, <br />
something I had no chance of a few days ago. He laughed and then realised something.<br />
&quot;You're voice has dropped too! And you've got stubble!&quot; He wasn't going to let this go. I told him not to <br />
worry and the coach started. We all cheered and we drove off.<br />
<br />
We arrived in the hotel at about 9:00 so we were ordered to take a shower and go to sleep. I went after Jesse <br />
who came out with a towel around his waist. Showing off his pecs and abs. He smiled and put on a pair of <br />
boxers and went to sleep. I went next and took a shower. I came out with a towel and Jesse saw me. Suddenly my <br />
towel slipped off exposing my limp python. I scrambled up my towel while Jesse gasped.<br />
&quot;Your dick! It's huge! It's biggest I've ever seen!&quot; He went bright red and stuttered out an explanation.<br />
&quot;Don't worry! I know what you meant. And I guess it's pretty big.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah... Mine's tiny! Only 4 inches! Must be a genetic thing...&quot; He sighed and went to sleep.<br />
I climbed in mine after. Jesse was always a good mate, I should do something for him. I also wanted to check <br />
if my power worked on other people. I wished for Jesse to have a dick as big as mine, balls and all. I saw <br />
Jesse sit up and pull up his covers, and his dick tented his boxers further and further. Finally it stopped <br />
close to ripping point. He sat there with a joyful look of confusion on his face.<br />
&quot; Doesn't look like 4 inches!&quot; I laughed.<br />
&quot;I don't know! It just grew!&quot; He exclaimed. I went back to bed with a smile on my face knowing I'd done <br />
something good for someone. Then I thought, Jesse was pretty hairless. He got a good tall and muscle gene but <br />
his dad was basically hairless. I wished for Jesse to grow as much hair as I have. Jesse stood up and went to <br />
the mirror scratching his armpits. His jaw dropped and black hairs lengthened and curled under his armpits. <br />
His legs sprouted hair and his chest grew some too. He ran to my bed and woke me up.<br />
&quot;Will! Look! I just grew all this hair!&quot; He said gleefully, like a boy with a new toy. I silently wished for <br />
us to grow more. But more me to grow a little more. I stood up and Jesse smiled again as we sprouted even more <br />
hair. Our armpits became forests of black, our chests almost covered and we grew a 5 o'clock shadow. We looked <br />
like grown men not 14 year olds!<br />
&quot; Oh my god!&quot; He said happily. I laughed with him and went back to bed. I left Jesse stroking his hairy chest <br />
and silently wished that all changes to us no one would noticed. Only me and Jesse. I fell asleep with a tall, <br />
muscled, hairy body. A big dick and a happy friend.</p>
