<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“You okay, you don’t smell like a barnyard, even though I can see a few semen stains on your dress. So what of Kyle, is he inside the house still; lucky for him his parents are away on their fortieth wedding anniversary for two months?” Jen said to Carla as she drove into the driveway and rolled down the passenger side window.<br />
<br />
“I showered just as you said, and took a spoon full of hydrogen peroxide to make me puck, but nothing came up, so I guess his semen is down inside of me. As to my clothes I did not have the time allotted to wash and dry them, as I thought you were coming here sooner than you did.” Carla replied to Jen. “Let’s get going, Kyle is grazing behind the house, he looks more like a Minotaur when he smashed down the bathroom door when trying to get at me.”<br />
<br />
Carla opened the car door and slipped inside the old Ford, as Jennifer’s dad bought her a car, and he always bought junkers. “I am in and if your door will close, we can go, as I want to put this whole situation behind me!” Carla grumped, she feeling ever so foolish for allowing Kyle to mate, and then of her asking Jen to broaden the curse limits to include her, Carla as to become for Kyle another cow in her future herd.<br />
<br />
“Here,” Jen said as she handed Carla a plastic cup with a lid sealed to the top.<br />
<br />
“What is this, coffee, cold coffee?” Carla taking the cup and noticed it felt as not hot.<br />
<br />
“Not quite, it is Olive oil mixed with V-8 juice, as drink that, it will flush the semen through your digestive system quicker, and might fight with what you ingested as not linger and cause some manner of physical changes to you.” Jen replied, as Carla popped off the cup’s lid and took a swallow.<br />
<br />
“Oh yuck, what a bazaar flavor, I almost would prefer drinking bull semen, as it had a creamy consistency, was saltier, and not acidic like tomato juice.” Carla said as she continued to sip and swallow the mixture.<br />
<br />
“Hey, you did a wrong turn, as I live at…,” Carla said, as Jen replied, “I am taking you to a friend, he works at Sunrise Research Lab, I thought it through, you need to be tested after swallowing what Kyle spent inside you. I spoke with him that is why I was late at picking you up at Kyle’s.” <br />
<br />
“Jerry, Jerry Billingsly, you know him, the guy with black rim coke-bottle glasses, so near sighted he can’t see his pecker when he goes to pee!” Jen remarked, as made Carla to laugh. “How do you know he can’t see his pecker when…?” Carla half laughing asked of Jen.<br />
<br />
“Because, I saw Jerry at the Rise-n-shine restaurant, he was coming out of the men’s bathroom and had his right pants-leg soaked in urine, he trying to dry his soiled pants with a paper towel, and towel was turning yellow from what it dabbed from his slacks.” Jen said, as she had a silly smirk from thinking about Jerry and his humiliating peril.<br />
<br />
“Well, what is the test he will do on me?” Carla asked, as Jen came to a red light and looked at Carla.<br />
<br />
“Jerry will do a DNA test, checking if the as cursed semen has in any way done a change to your chemical makeup. He will then draw blood to test for any strange anti-bodies, and as he suggested, as do a vaginal test to see if Kyle has impregnated you. As if his cursed and highly infectious semen did get inside your womb, there is a high chance he impregnated you with his bovine gift.<br />
<br />
Jerry said the taking of samples he does quickly, the running of the tests takes about two hours, and just enough time for us to go get a meal and come back to the lab to hear the results; with luck we might get you home around the 9:00 pm time you told your mother to expect you.” Jen explained, as the traffic light changed to green and suddenly turned red again.<br />
<br />
“Oh damn, a train,” Jen remarked, “The lousy things come through here so often!”<br />
<br />
“Oh cool down, it is just an Amtrak, yea here it comes, I saw the headlight peaking through the trees along the tracks. The train is usually an engine at each end of the train and six cars in between. Here he comes, doing about 80 mph, as usual, and zoom, like that he is gone, you got a green light Jen.” Carla said, as what she said seemed to bother Jen a lot as she had a facial expression as if the bird of paradise just pooped on her birthday cake.<br />
<br />
“What now,” Carla asked, although she had an inkling of what turned Jen so sour of her attitude.<br />
<br />
“You, a girl interested in of all things, trains. What drives you to like those things, they are in my way all the time, a waste of tax payer money.” Jen grumbled, as she raced through a yellow traffic light, not wanting to spend any time waiting.<br />
<br />
“When I was but a tot and would not go to bed on time as my parents wished, my dad and mom took me to get an ice cream cone and we would go and set by the railroad depot, watching the evening Twilight Limited passenger trains come and go, delivering passengers and leaving some off. It instilled in me a love for trains and ice cream cones, so what?” Carla remarked, as she laughed at Jen and her many disliked thing about town.<br />
<br />
“Finally,” Jen said as she drove into the parking lot at Sunrise Research.<br />
<br />
“Hey, wasn’t this place on the evening news, something about criminal charges, they did…, ah yea, Reformation Process experiments on unsuspecting people, thoroughly as non-consensual; the government was suing for damages and…,” Carla commented, as Jen parked her car and looking at Carla, as Jen said, “Too many people in the world, as this place helped some to try a whole new lifestyle.”  <br />
<br />
Carla got out of the car and grabbed Jen by an arm, as she thought to argue, “Too many huh, what if you were walking to your car at the mall and a van pulled up, three men grabbed you, sedated you, took you here, and when you awoke, found you looked like Kyle is now!”<br />
<br />
“Come along now cow-girl, as your testing awaits, and if you are lucky come then nine months from today, maybe you will birth a cute baby Minotaur!” Jen remarked, she pulling Carla toward the front entry to the laboratory.</p>
