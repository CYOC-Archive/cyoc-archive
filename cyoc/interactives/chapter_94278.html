<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The halls of the Gamma Alpha Gamma house were louder than normal. As Michael walked from the kitchen with his celery and peanut butter, he felt like something was very unusual. Or rather, something was too usual, because this was a very unusual fraternity. Cedar College’s first all-gay frat, Gamma Alpha Gamma was a dry organization that valued community and equality over drunken debauchery. At least, they used to.<br />
<br />
Michael grimaced as he passed his brothers’ open doors. He’d been hoping to get some studying done, but he didn’t think he could focus with this racket. What was going on? Frustrated, he blew some hair out of his eyes. He loved his asymmetrical scene haircut, but sometimes his bleached blonde bangs got in the way. He scratched his thigh beneath his boxers. Some of the guys felt comfortable walking around naked, but he was too embarrassed by his stick thin body. He’d gotten to the point where he could be shirtless, as he was now, but he didn’t want anybody making fun of his flat ass.<br />
<br />
As he walked further down the hall, he noticed something else strange. Cody had been playing Lady Gaga 24/7 since her new album came out, but now his room was blasting Jason DeRülo. Cody nudged the door open with his hip and froze. Cody was lying on his bed, shirtless as usual. But when had he ever been that hairy? A thick manly pelt covered his chest and abs and thighs, and… Holy crap! Cody shut the door. He could not explain what he had just seen, but it looked like Kelly from next door… Sucking Cody off.<br />
<br />
He shook his head. He must have been mistaken. As far as he knew, Cody had never been with a anyone, but he was the gayest brother they had. It must have been his imagination. Maybe she was just sleeping in his lap. Yeah, that could happen. Girls were so comfortable around gay dudes. Michael moved on, peering into the other doorways as he passed.<br />
<br />
Boyfriends Dave and Chad were sipping beer and whooping as they played a racing video game. Frat president Daniel was trying on snapbacks and flexing in the full-length mirror. The common room erupted with cheers as a football team scored on the flatscreen TV. Something very odd was going on here. Michael walked into his room as his roommate Bobby was walking out. He had a dull look in his eyes and a bemused grin on his face. Five o’clock shadow adorned his chin. He didn’t seem to see Michael.<br />
<br />
Closing the door behind him, Michael’s eyes were assaulted by bright orange. Evidently, Bobby had spent the past few minutes plastering his wall with enormous, garish Hooters posters, each depicting a different, busty blonde lady. A pyramid of beer cans blocked out the window, preventing sunlight from getting through. Michael noticed that his computer was open. He sat down at his desk and saw a YouTube video onscreen. Some channel called Nickpix. It was already playing and some fat dude was finishing his rant about faggots ruining America or something. Confused, he set down his snack and closed the Internet. He pulled out his math textbook. With the door closed, the noise was a little more manageable.<br />
<br />
He took a bite of celery. Chewy. It must not have been as fresh as it had seemed when he bought it. He opened his book to the chapter on quadratic equations and started to read. But nothing was making very much sense. He swore he understood the lecture yesterday, but the numbers swam in front of his eyes, refusing to give him any meaning. His brain felt cloudy and he began to get frustrated For half a second, bubbling rage filled his chest, but he quelled it with some deep breaths. He decided to see if he could find a study guide online.<br />
<br />
He opened his browser, but instead of his normal Google News homepage, something called BroBible popped up. A light seemed to appear through the fog of his brain. He took another bite of celery and chewed, clicking on a link entitled “Seven Child Stars Who Grew Up HOT!” As he clicked through the list, he felt the unmistakable stirrings of lust beneath his boxers. Eyes fixated on the screen, he chewed and chewed, not noticing as the celery broke down completely, becoming a wad of spearmint gum that he chomped vigorously as he began to rub his package. His entire body tingled with an unknown desire. <br />
<br />
As he felt himself up, his cock swelled, becoming thick and clublike in his hand. One by one his thin toes popped, becoming thick and bony, his feet growing callouses and topping themselves with wiry hair that swirled up his ankles. The hair continued up his shins and thighs, which groaned and bulged, filling out with sinewy muscle. A dark tan boiled across his skin, emanating from his crotch as the sprouting hairs propagated, giving him a dark bush.<br />
<br />
He chewed and rubbed, rubbed and chewed as the tan spread up his hairless torso, thickening with muscle as it did so. Six-pack abs erupted two by two beneath a barrel chest as his ribs exploded outward to fit his manly frame. His eyeline moved two inches upward as his flat ass inflated into a tremendous bubble butt.<br />
<br />
His chin grew broad and straight as his teeth rearranged into a wide, dazzlingly white smile. His blonde eyebrows grew in thick and brown as the long bleached streaks of his hair slowly browned and fell around his face in a coarse floppy style, the shaved parts quickly growing out to match it.<br />
<br />
His pelvis bucked and charged with virile energy as his cock squirted into his boxers, which faded from a bright pink to white with little hears on them. Mike let go of his cock, leaned back in his chair, and tousled his hair. He grabbed the Dos Equis bottle that had appeared next to his keyboard and took a swig.<br />
<br />
Today was gonna be a good day.</p>
