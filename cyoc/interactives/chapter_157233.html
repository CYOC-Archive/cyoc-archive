<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;...Then I&#39;ll cast fireball!&quot; an overwhelmed Jess said. Kathy decided to run John and Jess through a one shot D&D session. <br />
Kathy said &quot;You&#39;re out of 3rd level spell slots.&quot; <br />
&quot;Then I&#39;ll pickpocket his magic staff!&quot; Jess announced. <br />
Kathy said &quot;From the spellcaster&#39;s hands? Umm... ok roll slight of hand?&quot; <br />
Jess rolled her dice and looked at her modifiers and said &quot;Umm... -4?&quot; <br />
Kathy grinned and said &quot;You accidentally pickpocket in reverse and give him your wand of true polymorph... Since that&#39;s all your actions it&#39;s the spellcaster&#39;s turn and...&quot; *rolls percentile* &quot;make a wisdom saving throw Jess.&quot; <br />
Jess rolled and said &quot;4?!? No 3, plus 2 so 5? It&#39;s 5 right?!?&quot; <br />
Kathy said &quot;You have now been turned into a frog by your own wand of true polymorph.&quot; <br />
Jess whined and said &quot;I don&#39;t want to be a frog! Change me back Jane!&quot; <br />
John said &quot;I&#39;m a barbarian remember? I don&#39;t have any spells.&quot; <br />
&quot;Then it should be your turn so hack that spellcaster to pieces!&quot; Jess announced. <br />
Kathy nodded and John said &quot;Alright then, Angry and berserk at my friend&#39;s fate I swing my battleaxe and get a... 11?&quot;<br />
Kathy said &quot;Swing again&quot;<br />
John rolled and... &quot;Natural 1...&quot; <br />
Kathy chuckled and said &quot;Your Battleaxe flied out of your hands, and because you didn&#39;t get hit or hit your rage wears off. Jess anything you want to do with your frogginess?&quot; <br />
Jess said &quot;I&#39;ll... hop away?&quot; <br />
Kathy nods and says &quot;Jane roll a wisdom saving throw.&quot; <br />
&quot;...7&quot;<br />
Kathy said &quot;And that&#39;s more or less a party wipe as you two are now frogs!&quot; <br />
Jess cried &quot;No! Aren&#39;t the heroes supposed to win?!?&quot; <br />
Kathy said &quot;In this case your just mercenaries, not really a good or bad side in this conflict.&quot;<br />
John said &quot;I still don&#39;t get why you made a Rogue Wizard with no intelligence or dexterity Jess... or even why you went rogue wizard instead of an arcane trickster.&quot; <br />
Jess said &quot;Kathy you said that you can do nearly anything with high enough charisma!&quot; <br />
Kathy shook her head and said &quot;I said out of all the stats the one with the most classes is charisma.&quot; <br />
Jess fed up said &quot;Whatever! I&#39;m going to get some juice.&quot; and left the room. <br />
John sighed and said &quot;Well... that was... entertaining.&quot; <br />
Kathy smiled and said &quot;It&#39;s been too long since we&#39;ve played D&D together.&quot;<br />
John said &quot;It&#39;s just been too long...&quot;<br />
&quot;You alright John?&quot; <br />
&quot;Just thinking about the future. I&#39;m officially little Jane here and... How will our friendship continue as technically your just the older sister of my friend Jess.&quot; <br />
&quot;...I think I get what you mean an-... I&#39;ve got a few texts I need to do. Excuse me please.&quot; <br />
&quot;Kathy I didn&#39;t-&quot; <br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sad now, really. Just realized something I probably should&#39;ve done for awhile now.&quot; and then Kathy left the room leaving John alone. The little girl could only wonder what Kathy was going to do. <br />
Jess stepped back in the room and with a conspiratorial grin whispered &quot;I know where Kathy keeps her games. Wanna play?&quot; John nodded thinking it&#39;d be nice to play some video games once in a long time. Plus it would be nice if John could actually become friends with Jess. <br />
<br />
A couple of hours later the game displayed &quot;You have died&quot; for the hundredth time. Jess said &quot;Why is this game so hard and scary?!?&quot; <br />
John said &quot;That&#39;s the point I think. There was even that message saying &quot;Git Gud&quot; At that point Jess&#39; stomach growled. Looking out the window it was getting dark... <br />
Jess asked &quot;Wanna get dinner?&quot;<br />
<br />
Entering the living room next to the kitchen John and Jess walked into a conversation between Kathy and... Saya... One of the popular girls that had consistently had something against Kathy. <br />
Saya asked Kathy &quot;And who are the munchkins?&quot; <br />
Kathy said &quot;So the one with red hair is my little sis Jess, and the dark haired one is Ms. Mavis&#39; new daughter.&quot; <br />
Saya confused asked &quot;Wait, When did and with who?!?&quot;<br />
Kathy said &quot;Nothing like that. She&#39;s adopted. I was with Jess and found them at the outlets. The two kids are going to go to the same school so we thought we&#39;d try to get them friendly.&quot; <br />
Saya asked &quot;So that&#39;s why... Well I&#39;m not sure we&#39;ll ever be friends, but I can respect what you&#39;re trying to do... really though Mavis really got another kid after-&quot; <br />
Kathy said &quot;Yeah... She just kinda popped into her life apparently.&quot; <br />
Saya sighed and said &quot;Alright... So what exactly do you have planned for the rest of this sleepover?&quot; <br />
The doorbell rung and Kathy said &quot;Pizza guy&#39;s here.&quot; <br />
Saya said &quot;Wait, Pizza?!? At least tell me you got a salad with those!&quot;<br />
Jess giggled and said &quot;Wow, how ungrateful.&quot; <br />
John said &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s free food right?&quot;<br />
Saya turned and said &quot;Now listen here you two. I&#39;ve got a figure to keep, one or two little slices too many and I&#39;ll go from an hourglass to a circle!&quot; <br />
Kathy came back with two boxes and said &quot;Come on Saya, your on the cheerleading team right? You must need some carbs.&quot; <br />
Saya sighed and said &quot;I suppose. Fine if your going this far I may as well indulge a little bit.&quot; And thus a sleepover play date for two little girls turned into a sleep over between two little girls and two teenagers. Saya curious asked &quot;so... what were you thinking we&#39;d be doing Kathy?&quot; <br />
Jess said &quot;Ooo! We could make prayers to Chronos! I&#39;ve heard it can work!&quot; <br />
Saya asked &quot;Shouldn&#39;t we do the standard thing of a Ouija board or Kokkuri game?&quot;<br />
Kathy said &quot;Come on Saya, it&#39;s the trendy thing to do right now with the urban legends.&quot; <br />
Saya sighed and muttered &quot;Well excuse me for enjoying the classics... Well it was Jess&#39; idea so I guess she can lead the first... How do you actually pray to Chronos? Do we need to print something out and use a coin or something?&quot;<br />
Jess shook her head and said &quot;No you just pray and see what happens.&quot; <br />
Saya said &quot;Well that&#39;s just silly, at least with the others someone can fudge some stuff an-&quot; <br />
Some text came in front of Johns vision &quot;Jess Wargon: Please make Kathy and Saya younger for the night to make this sleepover more fun!&quot; and suddenly the two teens shrank down into small children. With everyone surprised John also had to put on a confused expression. <br />
Saya said &quot;Wha! This actually works?!?&quot; as she looked up to John and Jess. <br />
Jess also said &quot;This actually works?!?&quot; <br />
Saya yelled &quot;I thought you believe in this!&quot;<br />
Kathy looked around and said &quot;We&#39;ve shrunk quite a bit haven&#39;t we?&quot; <br />
John said &quot;Youthened, Chronos is a time god after all.&quot; Saya was panicking as she was praying to get older again but nothing was happening.<br />
Jess noticed that and said &quot;Oh don&#39;t worry. I just prayed for this to last till morning so... let&#39;s have some fun.&quot; The 9 year old thinking of all the fun she could have while she overpowered the two 5ish year olds... then had another idea. <br />
&quot;Jess Wargon: Make me an adult tonight so I can be in charge for once.&quot; John without much say in this matter could only watch as Jess sprouted taller and taller and watched her breasts push out of her chest till she was an adult woman. Kathy and Saya had started bickering about something which let Jess pick them up in her arms and say &quot;Come on kiddies, let&#39;s play a game called &quot;the adult makes the rules&quot;&quot; <br />
It was telling during this time that there was a prayer Saya brought out where she wished her lackey Nelly would be made as young as she was... John wasn&#39;t what she could do but... decided to wing it... yeah Nelly was probably hit with a regression spell... Meanwhile Jess had her way with the three little girls. the rest of the Wargon family was either studying or busy with crunch time in the office so no adults were coming to help the three once teens. <br />
<br />
The following day Kathy and Saya walked to school together... weary from that night where they both promised each other to never speak of that night again. Then they saw Nelly. She was a short girl naturally and had only grown maybe an inch over several years. The regression had made her features softer, but when Nelly asked if Saya noticed anything different the weary girl didn&#39;t notice anything... At that point the little girl snapped, How did no one notice that she went from a teenage girl to a prepubescent girl?!? Sure she wasn&#39;t the bustiest or the tallest, and she had a naturally high pitch voice but really?!? She than ran off to see if she could find anyone at the school who would notice. <br />
In a different part of town at the elementary school Jess and John walked to school together and met up with some of Jess&#39; friend... Like Yumi&#39;s younger sister Naomi... small town.</p>
