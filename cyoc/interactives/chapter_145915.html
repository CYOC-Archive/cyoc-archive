<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He had a few more slip-ups, including one that landed him painfully on the floor, but, somehow, he wasn&#39;t sure how, Jacob made it through the rest of gym. Afterward, back in the locker room, he found himself still troubled that he didn&#39;t feel the least bit aroused by the sea of girls disrobing and heading for the showers. Hastily removing Kaitlyn&#39;s gym clothes, he followed into the shower and was immediately stopped by a sneering voice, &quot;Hey zits for tits. Finally get over your fear of the shower and decided to join us,&quot; which was followed by a series of derisive laughter from a couple other girls.<br />
<br />
Jacob, upon seeing it was the girl who&#39;d snapped his bra, found himself feeling out of place. Barely listening as she made another rude comment, Jacob trudged over to an open shower and turning it, stood for a minute, allowing the water to wash over him. After a moment, he did his best to wash himself, nervous that the girls around him would notice something was off. When he finished, he headed back to Kaitlyn&#39;s locker, finding as he did that he suddenly didn&#39;t feel so good. Unsure why, he opened the locker and pulled Kaitlyn&#39;s clothes out and was about to find her underwear when suddenly the same girl that had been heckling him cawed out, &quot;Hey everyone. Zits for tits is having her period.&quot;<br />
<br />
Confused by this, aware that some of the girl&#39;s had back away, Jacob didn&#39;t understand what was going on at first. Then, as some of the girl&#39;s began whispering and pointing, while the one he thought of as a bitch began chanting, &quot;Plug it up,&quot; Jacob looked down.<br />
<br />
To his alarm and horror, he watched as drop of blood formed on the wet floor between his feet. Having thought he&#39;d dried himself completely, he hadn&#39;t paid too much attention. But now, seeing that he was bleeding, Jacob found himself awash in a sea of emotions. Turning about, looking for help, hearing the chant, &quot;Plug it up,&quot; had been joined by several other girls, Jacob clutched tightly Kaitlyn&#39;s clothing to his chest and ran as fast as he could toward the toilet stalls.<br />
<br />
There, he barged his way into the first one he could see, slung the garments over the hook on the wall, slapped the door shut and sat down on the toilet. Listening the the girls on the other side of the door, embarrassed by what had happened, unsure what exactly had happened, he listened to the sound of liquid dripping into the toilet bowl. Struggling to remember things he might have learned in health class, Jacob was startled out of his thoughts when things began raining over the partition. Picking up one the stick-like package, he read the word Tampax printed in pink lettering.<br />
<br />
It suddenly dawning on him why he was bleeding, he reached down and picked up a package stamped with the word Kotex. Thinking, &quot;It&#39;s not possible,&quot; Jacob tried to figure out how it was possible for him to have a period when he didn&#39;t have the equipment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean,&quot; he reasoned mentally. &quot;I only look like Kaitlyn. I&#39;m not actually her. Right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Unable to answer this, vaguely aware that the other girls had not only stopped hucking stuff into the stall, but had also grown quiet, Jacob nearly screamed when someone knocked on the door. Breathing heavily, struggling to reach up for Kaitlyn&#39;s clothes, but not wanting to stand up fully, he listened as a soft voice said, &quot;Kaitlyn? It&#39;s Ms Redding, the school nurse. Are you all right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Jacob immediately replied and when Ms Redding asked if she could come in, he found himself so terrified by such a thing, he practically wailed, &quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
Somewhere close by, the sneering voice of the mean girl cried out, &quot;Hey, zits for tits. Ain&#39;t you ever have your period,&quot; then, in a loud carrying voice, she stated, &quot;Jesus. Even I know what a period is. And I aint even had mine, yet,&quot; to which the strong, authority voice of the coach told her, &quot;Knock it off. Or I&#39;ll have you in detention,&quot; followed by, &quot;Okay, everyone. There&#39;s no show. Get to your next class, now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally able to get Kaitlyn&#39;s clothes down off the hook, Jacob was at a loss as to what he was too do. Staring down at his own boy parts, unaware that he was thinking of them as a girl might, he leaned a little forward, spread his legs and stared at the blood that had dripped into the toilet. Unsure how it was that he was bleeding from an area he was sure he didn&#39;t have, he was startled from his thoughts when Ms Redding said, &quot;Everyone is gone. It&#39;s just you and me. Are you sure I cannot come in,&quot; to which Jacob again affirmed that he was fine, even though he was anything but, and that she&#39;d couldn&#39;t come.<br />
<br />
On the other side of the door, Ms Redding asked, &quot;I take it, this is your first time?&quot; and struggling to put back on Kaitlyn&#39;s bra, Jacob found himself at a loss as to how he should answer.<br />
<br />
After a bit, finally getting the brassiere on, he took a deep breath and, as if hearing himself from far away, he said, &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; as he pulled on the crop-top.<br />
<br />
To his deeper embarrassment, Ms Redding began telling him things Jacob thought he should know from health class, but found himself drawing a blank. Figuring it might be simply because it was another class he happened paid attention in, he nearly started to cry when the school nurse explained how to use a tampon. Not liking the idea of sticking something inside of him, especially since he still wasn&#39;t sure he had that sort of equipment, he listened as Ms Redding said, &quot;Do you had a pad? A tampon? I was made to understand the other girls were throwing things at you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob, thinking he couldn&#39;t wear either, convinced his cock and nuts would hinder the pad, and that the tampon was out as he didn&#39;t have the opening to stick it in, eventually whispered, &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; and finding himself at a loss, he stared down at the mess of packages of tampons and pads on the floor and the two he&#39;d picked up, which he&#39;d set to the side on top of the toilet paper dispenser. Confused, humiliated, unsure of himself and what was happening, he reached out for one of the items as Ms Redding said, &quot;I&#39;m still here if you need help.&quot;</p>
