<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Quickly following behind the two excited first graders, Jeff began to have further flashes of the duo.<br />
<br />
Tommy was one of the older boys in the class, but was also one of the shyest. Ryan was  Tommy&#39;s only friend, the energetic and sweet natured boy often inviting him over to play.  Jeff wondered how this friendship would shape the two boys, if he decided to grow them back up. As it stood, Jeff was really beginning to consider leaving the pair as they were. Ryan seemed much happier like this and his memories of Tommy were mostly positive. Maybe he could be the one that could teach the pair to not use their future size as an intimidation factor.<br />
<br />
As the trio now entered the Lost and Found, Jeff sighed in annoyance. &quot;Geez does every teacher have a free period or something,&quot; he thought. Standing before him now was Ms. Warner.<br />
<br />
Janet Warner was a shrewish, elderly woman. A thin build with grey hair and dull grey eyes gave the woman the appearance of a witch. Janet appeared to have embraced her appearance, Jeff considering her to be on par with Mr. Huff in terms of her nasty demeanor. Ms. Warner now scowled at the pair of first graders, her thin lips forming into a scowl. &quot;What are you two little scamps up too?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan and Tommy shrank back, huddling together as they gazed up at their woman. Ms. Warner looking the boys over, noticing Tommy&#39;s lack of shoes and odd dress before turning her furor to Jeff. &quot;Is this your idea of a joke Mt. Davis,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;Having children run around half dressed throughout the school. I should give you detention for this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its not Jeff&#39;s fault,&quot; Tommy replied meekly. &quot;He was trying to use the Chronovac to make me a grownup.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chronovac,&quot; Ms. Warner asked raising an eyebrow. Ryan and Tommy nodded, both boys trying to please the bitter teacher. Each child now began to gush, telling the teacher everything about the app. Jeff groaned in annoyance, realizing that both boys were at an age where they would be intimidated by teachers and want to please them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me see your phone Mr. Davis,&quot; she demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good idea,&quot; Jeff replied sheepishly. Ms. Warner though was unmoved, demanding Jeff unlock his phone. Jeff sighed, not wanting to get into anymore trouble  than he presumed he already was in. Bringing up the app Ms. Warner narrowed her eyes as she gazed at the readout.<br />
<br />

Mental Age: 62<br />

<br />
Do you wish to activate previous action on current subject?<br />
<br />
Janet paused, glancing at the app. Below the question was a green icon that said okay. Pressing that button Ms. Warner watched the screen load before returning its results <br />
<br />

Age: 6<br />
Mental Age: 6<br />
Height: auto<br />
Weight: auto<br />

<br />
&quot;Is this some kind of gag,&quot; Ms. Warner stated as she pointed a bony finger at Jeff. &quot;Why is my name here and what are you doing with it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff didn&#39;t answer, instead focusing on his teacher. He already knew where this was headed and simply sighed in annoyance. When this was over he was going to have another kid to watch.<br />
<br />
Janet at first was oblivious to her changes. Jeff watching as the deep lines in her face began to smooth, Janet&#39;s thin body beginning to regain strength, her dark navy blouse and skirt now beginning to strain against her revitalized body. As he looked at Janet, he was surprised by what he saw.<br />
<br />
The thin bird like appearance of the woman was rapidly regaining some curvature, her breasts regaining volume as her hips began to round. Looking at Janets hair he was pleasantly surprised to see the grey vanish, replaced by chocolate brown locks that were beginning to grow out as the woman descended into her prime adult years.<br />
<br />
Janet though was unaware, continuing to lecture Jeff with a voice that was regaining its strength. Janet&#39;s voice no longer had  the hoarseness and frailty of her elderly years. Instead her voice sounded authoritative bordering on melodic. Glancing at the 30 year old Jeff was stunned by what he saw.<br />
<br />
Janet was pretty, almost beautiful in her youth. The gone was the thin bird like appearance of her elderly years, wiped away revealing a rather attractive young woman. Jeff could see her legs now filling out her dark nylons quite spectacularly as her skirt hugged her generous hips.<br />
<br />
Still she descended further into her past. Janet&#39;s face rounding, losing its harder edges as she crept closer to her teens. As Janet continued her lecture, Jeff beheld a very pretty coed with an almost girl next door quality to her. Janet wasn&#39;t the most beautiful girl he had ever seen but she was certainly quite a catch.<br />
<br />
Janet though was continuing her trip back, the womans face rounding as she reentered her teens. By now Janet&#39;s body was beginning to erode, her borderline C cups beginning to diminish and no longer push her blouse out. As that happened, Jeff watched her curves melt away, her legs becoming skinnier with each year lost. Now a waifiah 14 year old, Janet was a cute coltish looking girl that appeared to still be growing into her looks.<br />
<br />
Janet now paused, clearing her throat as she examined herself. Something didn&#39;t feel right. Her clothes felt loose, her shoes a tad too large, glancing at Jeff she paused in her monologue. &quot;Hey whats happening,&quot; she said as she shrank down to 13.<br />
<br />
Janet now looked at her hands, the young teen shrieking girlishly. Janet&#39;s hands were softer, smaller than she was accustomed too. Watching them she began to noticed the cuffs slowly creep across her wrists, her smaller hands endanger of being swallowed by her rapidly expanding clothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whats happening to me,&quot; the 12 year old exclaimed. Janet now began exploring her body. She could feel her small breasts melting into her chest, her hips slowly contracting, her legs shortening. Listening to her voice she could hear it rising in pitch, losing the sharp adult tone of adulthood as it settled into a girlish whine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make it stop,&quot; she whined as she went from 11 to 10. &quot;I don&#39;t wanna be a little girl! I don&#39;t wanna be a little girl!&quot;<br />
<br />
Janet was now crying softly as she raced back through elementary school. Jeff watxhing as the girls clothing swallowed her, her nylons bunching around her thinner and shorter legs even the skirt she wore dropping lower, passing her knees and brushing her shins.<br />
<br />
Hitting 9 and racing for 8, Janet now covered her eyes with her sleeves, her hands engulfed by several inches of loose material. Jeff watched as the girls skirt lost hold of her narrow hips, pooling around her feet in heels that her were sizes too big on the young girl.<br />
<br />
As the regression completed, Jeff simply gawked at the 6 year old girl in front of him. Janet had been reduced to a small first graders like Tommy and Ryan. The blouse of the former adult now rested past her knees, the girls feet swimming in far too large heels and nylons. Sniffing the little brunette brushed her now long hair passed her ear as she stepped out of her far too large shoes. Now barefoot like Tommy she blinked a few times before glancing at her two classmates.<br />
<br />
&quot;See I told you it wouldn&#39;t work,&quot; she said, tapping her foot as she examined the extra six inches of material that extended pass her hands. &quot;Now what am I going to do? My mom is going to be so mad at me for borrowing her clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Janet,&quot; Tommy and Ryan replied meekly.  Janet sulked, the tiny girl now craving her neck as she flashed Jeff an innocent smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you help us find some clothes and get us to class please,&quot; she asked, her voice now sweet and innocent in tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh sure,&quot; Jeff nodded, the now 6 year old girl squealing in delight as she turned to her friends. Gazing at the three Jeff was astounded, the trio of children appeared to be close friends now. Now all Jeff needed to do was figure out what to do with them.</p>
