<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I saw eagerness in her eyes. These past days Hana has been restraining herself probably because she didn’t want her first time being messy and bloody, but her gestures and expressions didn’t lie. Everytime that I bared myself, she would ogle me carefully and every chance she got, she would hug and rub herself against me; I had to use all my willpower to not just ignore her wishes to wait until the end of her period and push her down, but now all the restrains came loose. Since Hana’s period ended and we had the house for ourselves we came to a silent understanding of what’s going to happen next.<br />
<br />
Hana bit her lip and took my hand. We silently walked to her room, but the sexual tension was through the roof. My heartbeat felt deafening and I was almost convinced that she could hear them clearly. <br />
<br />
When we entered the room, Hana turned around and I planted a kiss and her lips. My friend took me in her arms and started to rub my back; her hands started to slide downwards, passed through my waist and started to grope my butt. I could feel her breast resting against mine and her nipples starting to harden. The contact felt so good that I couldn’t stop myself from rubbing my chest against hers, but it was not enough, the clothes were on the way. At this moment, I just wanted to tear our pajamas to shreds and enjoy the feeling of my skin rubbing against Hana’s.<br />
<br />
She must have felt the same way because she grabbed my shirt and started to pull it off. I let it happen and separated myself from her a bit to let the shirt part of my pajama pass through my head. After a moment I was there, exposing my bare chest to Hana who was very much enjoying the view.<br />
<br />
A while ago, my breasts had grown enough to have to use an AA size bra and their expansion had not stopped at all, but was speeding up. By this point the AA bra was starting to feel tight and in the near future it would be time to change sizes again. On the other hand Hana had grown a little but was still in the A category. It wouldn&#39;t be too long until I surpassed her. <br />
<br />
One morning after I woke up I decided to skip to the kitchen to have breakfast. I couldn’t help it, although it might sound a little embarrassing, my body sometimes just pulled my mind along. At the beginning of the swap I just suppressed myself and squashed the urge to move my body. However, after accepting myself as a kid and a girl, I realized that there was no need to hold back and unless I suddenly felt the need to do something truly stupid, I could just go with the flow and let myself act as I wanted.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that morning I was skipping through the hallway when I noticed a small jiggling in my chest. Since I slept without a bra, I could feel that my breasts were big enough to jiggle a little and when I reached the kitchen, since only my mother and sister were up, I couldn’t resist the urge to boast about it. My mom and sister were very happy, and mom gave me a cream to use on my breasts to avoid stretch marks. Since my breast would probably expand rapidly it may cause stretch marks to appear if I was not careful.<br />
<br />
In summary, I was not flat chested anymore and with the addition of my pale white skin and big pink nipples I made for a very enticing sight, if I may say it myself. Nonetheless, I not just wanted Hana to check me out but to do something more intimate, so I grabbed the top part of her pajama and took it off like she did to me. After that with a swift movement we both took off the bottom part of our pajamas as well.<br />
<br />
I pushed Hana, and we both fell onto the bed with me on top. I planted a kiss on her lips and my hand started to move as by instinct, caressing and groping Hana’s back, waist, butt, and tights, anywhere my hands moved, my fingers would ignite more passion in her.<br />
<br />
As our kiss ended, Hana repositioned her body and I felt her lips latched onto one of my nipples. I was so surprised by the sensation that I tried to pull out for a moment but she wrapped her arms and legs around me to not let me go. After releasing the tension from my limbs, I caressed Hana’s head and she used that moment to change targets and start licking my other nipple.<br />
<br />
After a moment of Hana playing with my little boobs, she released the force from her hug letting me go, and I used that moment to stand on my hands and knees above her to see her better<br />
<br />
She was cute and beautiful, looking at her naked body I could see her developing breasts, smooth skin and subtle curves. I could feel a long forgotten instinct begin to awaken and before I could understand what I was doing, I pushed my waist and bumped our crotches together. <br />
<br />
“mmm!” My friend gave a sweet moan and smiled mischievously at me, maybe thinking that I was teasing her, but I understood  better than anyone what I was just trying to do. I was definitely trying to penetrate her, what remained of my instincts as a man led me to insert my penis in her pussy, unfortunately or fortunately, I didn’t possess that equipment anymore. Thinking about what my friend said a few days ago, about wanting to have a big family, I realized I was lucky I didn’t have a dick anymore. If I had balls that produced sperm and a penis to insert, my friend would end up walking out of here with her belly full of my babies. That thought scared and excited me in equal measure. It scared me because I realized that if I ever had sex with a man, I would be the one that could get pregnant if I let spermatozoids swim inside me, and at the same time the thought of my belly swelling with life was not as scary as before; in fact, it was beginning to feel exciting.<br />
<br />
My inability to penetrate Hana did not dampen my mood; the instant I got reminded of my lack of male biology my mind quickly switched tracks; I moved to a better position in bed and started to interlace my legs with Hana’s. Noticing what I wanted to do, my friend adjusted her position as we let our bodies and vulvas come closer and closer until… they touched.<br />
<br />
When I felt the warmth of Hana’s privates, my first instinct was…nothing. For a moment I just blankly stared in silence where our secret places touched, trying to remember how to continue, that is, until Hana started rubbing her pussy against mine. Her movements felt hesitant and inexperienced, but with that reminder my hips started to move to increase the pleasure.<br />
<br />
As the seconds passed, we started to get more comfortable and entered a rhythm of rubbing our pussies, kissing and groping our growing breasts. I could almost feel my instincts slowly shifting from penetrating to rubbing and caressing. Since I started adolescence, my first response as a boy when I saw a pussy opening for me was, of course, shoving my junk in it. Now as a girl, I could not rewire my mind in a second, but I am sure that if I keep having this kind of sex, in the near future I would lose my urges to thrust and penetrate; instead,  my urges would probably morph into something more suitable for my current body and my first response when seeing a vagina would be to start rubbing it with my own.<br />
<br />
As we continued our naughty dance, I could feel my pussy getting more and more wet, so much that little droplets of love nectar started rolling through my and Hana’s thighs. Hana was surprised at how much liquid I was spewing because she did a double take to see if I was adding lubricant from somewhere, but she probably enjoyed the slippery sensation because she started to let out some cute moans. I decided to imitate her and let out my voice to let her know how much I was enjoying myself, and that gesture was the tipping point for Hana because in the following seconds she suddenly orgasmed. <br />
<br />
“eehh eeeeeekkk” Her cute screams of pleasure resounded through the bedroom<br />
<br />
Differently from me, she did not squirt, her body just twitched and she fell on her back<br />
<br />
I froze for a moment, my mind said to stop and give her a minute to rest, but my body argued that it needed just a little more pleasure to reach the peak. In the end, I didn’t need to make a choice, in less than ten seconds Hana snapped out of it; she was still drooling a little from the intense sensation, but by her wide smile, I guessed she was more than willing to repay the favor. <br />
<br />
Making use of her trained hip muscles, Hana redoubled her efforts in rubbing our pussies together; I did not fall behind and ramped up the intensity. I could hear the sound of our soaked pussies rubbing together between the music of our moans, and I was getting excited by the fact our fluids were mixing together. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, I felt the climax was near when an idea occurred to me. I could not release semen in Hana’s pussy, but due to my peculiar body constitution I could release something else. I quickly pressed my vagina against hers and did a little wiggle to ensure both our vaginal lips were open and not a second later, I felt a torrent of pleasure running from my pussy to the rest of my body, making my muscles spasm. I acted on an urge and pressed my body against Hana’s in a tight embrace as I sensed clear liquid being released from my crotch.<br />
<br />
“Ah Aaaaahhhhhhh!”<br />
<br />
“Eeek!?”<br />
<br />
My lewd screams resounded in the room along with Hana’s confused noises. When the orgasmic spasm finished and the tendrils of pleasure running through my body ceased, I separated myself from Hana and came face to face. She was making a bewildered face.<br />
<br />
“Did… did you just pee on me?” She didn&#39;t sound angry, just confused, and maybe… a little excited?<br />
<br />
“No, no!” I responded, “that it’s not pee, it’s squirting, you know female ejaculation” At this point we were both drenched in my lewd juice, our crotches and thighs were soaking wet, and I am pretty sure the juice entered the inside of Hana’s vulva. A thin silver line of fluid were briefly made as our secret places separated<br />
<br />
Hana sneaked a hand downwards and slipped two fingers to my soaking wet pussy<br />
<br />
“Mmm!” I gasped<br />
<br />
She didn’t bury her fingers, just rubbed my folds until her fingers were thoroughly coated in my fluids, then she sniffed her fingers and after a moment of contemplation, she licked them.<br />
<br />
“yeah, it smells and taste different from pee” she finally said and I made a weird face<br />
<br />
“How do you even know what pee tastes like?” I questioned her with fake innocence <br />
<br />
Hana finally realized the implications of what she just said and waved her hands frantically, “don’t judge me,  I just was very curious what it tasted like, so I soaked my finger with it and tasted a little, like I did just now. I am surprised more people are not curious enough to do it!”<br />
<br />
“Mmm, that’s true sometimes I do become curious about things like that, well then, let me try what this tastes like” I gently grabbed Hana’s hand and let her two fingers enter my mouth. The flavor of my nectar was slightly sweet and I started to suck her fingers, but Hana decided that was not enough because she drew back her hand and pressed her lips against mine. <br />
<br />
After a passionate kiss, we were both ready for more, unlike male biology, female genitalia needs little rest between orgasms.<br />
<br />
From morning to afternoon we tried quite a few things, kissing, caressing, scissoring, and cunnilingus. I had to take a small break to drink water because I was feeling thirsty, probably because of all the liquid I was expelling; however, after all that sex, there was something we haven&#39;t tried yet, penetration. <br />
<br />
“You can shove one finger or two inside, you know?” As we were liking each other in a 69 position I suggested. Hana suddenly paused. <br />
<br />
“Are you not afraid that I will break your hymen? I read that it will bleed and hurt a bit,” Hana asked hesitantly<br />
<br />
I took a moment to consider my answer. “Honestly, I have never thought much about breaking my hymen, maybe I should have thought about it before. The first time I masturbated, pushing one finger inside, felt a little tight and uncomfortable, but only at the beginning, after getting more excited I could little by little insert more of my finger until one finger fitted comfortably. At that time I didn’t bleed nor felt pain, lately I have been able to insert two fingers at the same time and haven’t seen any bleeding yet,” I explained<br />
<br />
“So, does that mean that your hymen is not broken yet?” my friend further questioned<br />
<br />
“I don’t know, according to what I read vaginas and hymens can be very different between girls; some hymens can  tear while growing up, some are so elastic than when inserting something, they don’t tear, some bleed when they are torn and some don’t, there are some girls that are born without hymen at all.” I recalled<br />
<br />
“I think I can see your hymen” Hana suddenly said, I felt her fingers opening my pussy in the middle of my explanation, but I didn’t know what she was doing.<br />
<br />
“Really!? let me see!” Hana brought a mirror and I sat down to see better. I opened my pussy while Hana held the mirror with one hand and pointed at one place with the other. Looking at the place she pointed I saw a very small piece of tissue covering the bottom part of my vaginal opening. I think I have seen it before, but I didn’t connect it with the fact that it was my hymen.<br />
<br />
“It’s quite small, mine is a bit bigger. She pointed at her own vagina and I could see the same kind of tissue, but covering more space, like in a half moon shape. Suddenly I felt silly, of course I noticed it before, but I didn’t know that was the hymen. I suddenly remembered that during my sister’s explanation of the female reproductive organ she didn’t point out where the hymen was, probably because she tore down her own already.<br />
<br />
Well, you learn something new everyday. Maybe if I insert something big enough my hymen would break and bleed or maybe it was small enough that wouldn’t ever cause me problems. just having the possibility that it could happen in mind is enough. <br />
<br />
                                                                                       ************************************<br />
<br />
Since we made a mess, we had to clean the sheets and ventilate the room. I didn&#39;t notice in the moment, but after eating lunch and returning to the room, we realized that Hana’s bedroom was filled with the fragrance typical of a young girl and the scent of sex mixed together giving whoever entered a good idea of what happened here<br />
<br />
After cleaning, I finally returned to my house after a weekend at my friend’s house. This was just our first time having sex, but we both knew that we had the whole winter break and both of us were extremely willing to continue to fool around.</p>
