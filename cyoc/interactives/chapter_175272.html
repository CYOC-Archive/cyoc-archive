<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa held onto her kids and her husband as long as she could as the fantasy wave washed over their little piece of the world. The kids where in the middle of the hug as if their parents where protecting them but there was no way to protect them from this. She couldn’t remember what happened but moments after the wave washed over her she found herself standing in the corner of the living room dry heaving as she placed her hands on her knees. <br />
<br />
Her whole body felt like it was been torn apart or better yet stretched. As she tried to focus, she noticed that the ground did look different. The carpet had been replaced with what looked to be hardwood with the edge of an animal skin of some kind on the floor. She was getting dizzy as she shot a handout to grab the fireplace to help hold her up but instead of grabbing the fireplace her hand gripped the mantle. That was not right, the mantle was head height not arm height. She looked at the mantle, either it had moved down, or she had gotten taller. She looked down as her head started to clear a bit, her eyes widened as she saw all her cloths had disappeared.<br />
<br />
She yipped as she tried to cover herself but as she did a flowing skintight silk white silk dress appeared over her skin. It was extremely form fitting with a high leg cut which went all the way to her hip, an open back with a strap which wrapped around her neck. Long gloves appeared on her hands, she was forced up as 4 in tall high heels appeared on her feet and for a moment, she looked more like she belonged in a night club. <br />
<br />
Then she noticed a piece of blonde hair enter her view. She reached up and pulled on her hair, she had kept it a short pixie cut to make it easier to deal with at work but now it was long and flowing blonde hair and a bright almost glowing blonde hair instead of her dirty blonde hair. She moved toward the window and got a look outside at the world beyond, their car had become a carriage with two horses attached to it and the neighbors house had stone and woodwork that looked more like it belonged in a German village then their old neighborhood. Sitting on a tree branch which itself looked unchanged was a squirrel but it now had a pair of long sabre like teeth like on a sabre tooth cat even animals where not safe from this event. <br />
<br />
The thing that took her breath away however was her face, it looked it belonged to a model, smooth lines, perfect lipstick, two large ear rings in her perfect ears which where now somewhat pointed. Long blonde hair and elegant bone structure. She was also clearly taller, with longer legs and arms and a slightly larger bust. Not too much larger but damn it looked great on her frame and she felt stronger, stronger than she had ever had in her life and judging from what she could see through the silk dress she had the tone body that she could never get in her old life. She also looked younger maybe 30 but it was hard to tell, she almost seemed to glow.<br />
<br />
She was trying to figure out what fantasy creature she was when she bent over in pain, her head almost hitting the window. She let out a scream as she felt two new limbs grow out of her shoulder blades, they moved away first being covered with perfect skin before silver feathers began to grow in. She let out a scream of pain as her wings spread out striking a lamp which fell over but did not break which was good considering it now looked like an oil lamp.<br />
<br />
She regained herself as her wings pulled in back behind her, the tip of her wings went just past the top of her head down to just past the knee. They were heavily but seamed to balance her well even so. She knew what she was now…minus the halo of course she seamed to be an angel. Still breathing heavily, she looked at herself again as her cloths shifted an again, this time seaming to grow out of the silk itself where pieces of interlocking metal armor, the metal itself was almost skintight and followed the curve of her body, sexy polished armor which was edged in gold. Armor appeared on her gloves and the bottom of the dress as the shoes transformed into a more armored look with armor going up to her knees. Around her neck a broach formed with a symbol she did not know as her wedding ring also transformed into something much larger but remained mostly the same. Lastly, she felt a pull on her hip as she looked down to see a long sword which had a large white crystal on the pummel. <br />
<br />
“My God.” Said Lisa her voice sounding almost musical.<br />
<br />
“Mommy…Daddy.” cried her youngest motherly instincts kicked in, she turned around, as she did she spotted a young African American women in her mid-twenties standing by the door. She could just see the dark fur around her legs, deer antlers coming out of her hair and leather straps over her chest. For a moment the two just looked at each other.<br />
<br />
“Lisa?” said the voice in a southern creole accent, something in her tone told Lisa who that was. It was her husband Mike.<br />
<br />
“Mike?” inquired Lisa her own voice sounding musical even to her.<br />
<br />
“MOMMY!!! DADDY!!!” cried their youngest again as both parents put their own issues aside and looked back into the living room to see what had become of their three children and the dog.</p>
