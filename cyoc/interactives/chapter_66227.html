<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John and Carrie walked around for a while enjoying the sights when they came across a large futuristic city and where they were looked an a lot like where they were when they first entered Toon World.<br />
<br />
Just then, John's smart phone got a message.<br />
<br />
&quot;Compatible access point reached. Please select your preference and select continue to begin download.&quot;<br />
Johns phone then began to display a variety of images of anthropomorphic animals of every shape and size.<br />
He was understandably confused by this sudden update as he had turned his phone off before they entered Toon World but since it turned on on its own, John figured the future city had something to do with this. So he selected the anthro fox option and continued the download.<br />
<br />
&quot;JOHN! What's happening to you?&quot; Said a startled Carrie<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about Carrie? All I did was download an upgrade and...&quot; <br />
John suddenly felt his legs and arms changing, but he couldn't move, whether from fear or some other force.<br />
He could only lift his head to watch his transformation continue. His skin felt clammy, then very cold and dry as it turned to silvery hard Metal.<br />
<br />
His body stiffened as his muscles turned into servomotors and actuators, and the skin covering his joints turned into protective accordion shaped covers, permanently connected to his new silver metal skin.<br />
His hands and feet, now completely mechanical, started to take on the shape of Fox-like hands and feet, but for some reason stopped as claws were beginning to protrude from his rough metallic skin. His extremities still looked somewhat human, but they had rubber paw pads on the digits and center.<br />
<br />
The change spread up his body, converting his pelvis and torso into a computer housing.<br />
His organs tingled as they were converted into microchips, processors and other computer parts. The center of his chest now contained a large cooling fan which started to blow, cooling his new CPU. John thought it felt good, for some reason.<br />
<br />
The metal spread to his lower back, hips, and between his legs, completely smoothing out whatever was there. Although his new programming was masculine, he was now by definition genderless. He felt his hips become stiff, and felt his small intestines and bladder turn into a digital receiver for his new antenna. He heard, more than felt the &quot;pop&quot; noise as a tube-like antenna fox tail emerged from where his spine would have ended, and started to transmit electrical signals.<br />
<br />
His lungs, now almost completely converted to electronics, gave John little oxygen, and, gasping for air, he thought he would pass out. But somehow, his new programming sensed this, and quickly surged upwards, sealing off his airways and allowing him to run for the first time off of pure electricity. John wasn't sure whether to be astounded or horrified by this.<br />
During John's final moments with his old body, the change converted the rest of his back into 2 batteries. <br />
<br />
Now his internals were completely sealed behind a shiny metal cover and his height started to increase.John grew until he was about 3 stories high and he could see his very shocked wife panic at his feet. <br />
<br />
Now that his body was completely artificial, his new programming worked its way slowly up John's neck, replacing his human voice box with a speech chip and a speaker, placed right where his tonsils would have been, if he were still human.<br />
<br />
&quot;Conversion 90% complete.&quot; John stated in a mechanical drone.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's happening to me!?&quot; He said in an electronic, but still emotional voice.&quot;Am I really becoming a giant mecha?&quot;<br />
<br />
His neck mechanized, John could now move his head side to side with an electric hum and look around. He felt his face extend into a muzzle and convert to thick metal and his jaw hinge change into a simple flap that he could open and close, in addition to it being timed with his speech. It spread up the sides of his head. His ears, hair and nose replaced by smooth silver metal that covered everywhere but his eyes. His new cyber fox ears formed on the top of his head, and he could pivot them, too. Just like a robot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Conversion 97% complete.&quot; He stated again.<br />
<br />
The last change was the most peculiar, to John at least. The silver metal that covered his head stopped at his &quot;eyebrows&quot;, and on either side of his eyes and the top of his nose.<br />
Then, from the top, dark translucent plexiglass covered his eyes, like sunglasses. A grid of hundreds of LED's each, all blue, sprung up from the metallic skin around both eyes. Then, everything started to look very soft to him. Colors, shapes, everything. Then, his eyelids stiffened. His vision went monochrome. They fused open, as the edge of his eyes turned completely round as they changed into metal. The surface of John's eyes started to flatten and dry out as they turned into glass aperture lenses. The color returned to his vision, though everything seemed slightly pixilated as he looked from side to side. His eyes had been converted into digital video cameras.<br />
<br />
&quot;Conversion 98% complete.&quot;<br />
<br />
John's head began to tingle. Since his new computer brain was in his chest, he no longer needed his old human brain. The only way he could describe it was to compare it to melting icicles. His mind slowly transferring downwards, like hot fudge traveling down his throat, his thoughts and memories uploaded to their new home inside his metal chest cavity. John's head buzzed as his old brain, now empty, was replaced by 3 gyroscopes, to replace his sense of balance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Conversion 99% complete.&quot;<br />
<br />
Johns silver metallic body started to change color to resemble a foxes color scheme. His body became orange and white while his hands, feet, and the tips of his ears became a shiny black color.<br />
<br />
&quot;Conversion complete. Reverting to user control mode C.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now that his 'conversion' was complete, his new body, which had remained stiff and inflexible during the change, suddenly seemed to 'let go' and John stumbled around the street leaving numerous cracks in the pavement, causing it to creak under the stress of his new body. He paused for a moment, and stared at his body. Complete silence hung in the air, save for the quiet chirps of various birds, the hum of his electric motors and the sound of his cooling fan. He wasn't sure what to think, or do as he stood there in his new automated form.<br />
<br />
His robotic body, now feeling loose and, John had to admit, oddly comfortable, allowed him to move about again.<br />
&quot;I'm glad it's finally over.&quot; He sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god John! How did this happen to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't really know. All I did was downloading something on my phone and... That's it!&quot; John looked at his phone which was now fused to the back of his left hand, the text on its screen reading &quot;Thank you for downloading this upgrade and conforming to this zones norm. Have a nice day!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great. I guess I'm stuck like this for the remainder of our visit.I guess you had better go up to the passengers area in my head and explore while you still can.&quot; John said as he opened up an elevator door in the heel of his right foot.</p>
