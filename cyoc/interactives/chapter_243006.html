<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a quiet and mellow start of an evening. Jeremiah O’Donnell’s grandfather Steve had worked in the mines deep down in the earth crust and unearthed from the wall of the deep earth The Wishing Bone artifact that had been there since dawn of the shamanism. Steve had told Jeremiah that one day he would inherit his fortune and gifted him the jewelry box containing the infamous wishing bone.<br />
<br />
Jeremiah was 25-year-old and 5’8 feet tall college student graduate. Jeremiah greeted everyone he met by calling himself ‘Jerry’. Only family or the closest friends called him by his lengthier name. Jerry fashion contained hoodies, beanies and jeans which centered around his favorite colors purple and black. His purple beanie stayed glued on his head where ever he went. Jeremiah wasn’t a stereotypical guy to visit nerdy stores meant for comic books or gaming but he would occasionally search the internet through his phone for something new. His life was more reactive than proactive. This meant that Jerry usually liked the things that were presented in front of him. He didn’t go for an extra mile to seek out anything special and his hobbies reflected that. One of his hobbies being movies. Jerry loved to walk past the local movie theather and spontationally decide on a whim what to watch if there was anything interesting to watch. <br />
<br />
This was going to be one of those evenings. Jerry had spotted a movie poster that had gotten him excited. The poster was for a very particularly anticipated movie about digging and mining. It had received a lukewarm and mixed reviews from critic but in the internet forums it was praised as the movie of the year. Jerry had to go see it as it reminded him of his grandfather. Jerry’s best friend Michael, or Mike for short, was waiting for him on the living room while Jerry was making sure that his beard looked good. He was as old as as Jerry but Mike was only 5’2 feet tall. They both shared the same fashion sense. Jerry had known Mike since middle school but after the high school they decided to be more closer with each other. Mike was more eccentric and peppier person than Jerry. Mike always was the one who was ready to experiment and try new things out and he wasn’t afraid to be who he was. <br />
<br />
“This isn’t a date, you know. You don’t have to spend all day grooming yourself.” Mike said when he leaned from the bathroom’s door frame.<br />
<br />
“I know. I just want to look good. That’s all.” Jerry replied back when he run his razor down on the single strands of hair.<br />
<br />
Mike gave a hugged Jerry from behind and gave a kiss on Jerry’s neck.<br />
<br />
“We could go make this a date and go eat something after the movie. If that’s okay with you?” Mike smiled while he tightly kept his arms wrapped around Jerry’s belly.<br />
<br />
Jerry paused for a moment and thought if he should turn the movie night into a date night or not.<br />
<br />
“Fancy or casual?” Jerry asked.<br />
<br />
“I would prefer more casual. Somewhere that I could eat with my fingers. Like this.” Mike replied back and lightly rubbed Jerry’s shoulders with his thumb and index fingers.<br />
<br />
Jerry didn’t want to be stingy with his money but even for him the casual restaurant after the movie was deep cut on his wallet. Both of them had just graduated and were doing their best to survive for the end of the month. Money was tight but for this evening Jerry was more than ready to splurge a little bit on his boyfriend. They decided to leave the restaurant question open and think about it later.<br />
<br />
After the Jerry’s grooming session he went to his bedroom and took out the jewelry box that had the bone in it. The bone was fairly normal looking bone but because of it’s unique shape it looked better as quirky necklace. When Jerry put the bone necklace around his neck and turned to face Mike near the bedroom door. Jerry sensed something or someone pushing him from behind. It felt like a person had just shoved him forward. Jerry felt that he almost tumbled down from a straight standing position. His legs felt weak the second he put the necklace on himself.<br />
<br />
“Are you all right?” Mike asked when he saw that Jerry almost fell down.<br />
<br />
“I am. I think I just need to drink something before we leave. I might be getting tired.” Jerry laughed and walked to the kitchen to get a soda from the fridge.<br />
<br />
“I know there isn’t many of these left but I don’t think you mind if I take one from your pile.” Mike laughed and took an one soda from the fridge.<br />
<br />
“Hey now. If you keep drinking my half of the pile all the time. You might become twice as a big and heavy than you are right now.” Jerry laughed.<br />
<br />
“Har har.” Mike retorted back.<br />
<br />
Jerry felt that something weird happened again. The lanky 5’2 feet tall boyfriend begun to get bigger. His flat belly, muscular lean thighs and whole body begun to expand like a bread dough inside a oven. The medium sized hoodie slowly became smaller as it revealed Mike’s doughed up midriff. Mike didn’t react in any way to his changes as he sipped the soda from it’s rim. The average sized Mike started to look chubby. Jerry blinked his eyes twice when he watched his boyfriend’s hairy under belly getting bigger. His chin started to gain more fat and his V-shaped shaped face became more rounder. Mike had to stop drinking and put his small drink on the table so that he could loosen his belt. Mike’s hips, thighs and crotch area had gotten chunkier and fatter. Mike’s breathing got more heavier and he started to wheeze from his mouth the moment when the growth revealed his belly button.<br />
<br />
On the second phase of the transformation all Mike’s tight looking clothing begun to adjust themselves to fit his new overweight body. Mike took the now bigger half liter bottle from the table which had grown in size with him. He drank the bottle’s contents straight from it’s bottleneck. Mike didn’t react to these changes in any way even if his clothes were now in double extra large size and he held a bigger bottle in his hand. Jerry saw that his drink in his hand had also gotten bigger to suit Mike’s standards for soda consumption. The bottle in Jerry’s hand had gotten heavier when it had grown as large as two liter bottle. Jerry’s mouth dropped open when Mike was pouring the liquid from the massive bottle with his two hands like it was nothing. The soda bottle in Jerry’s hand weighted like a half a gallon when it transformed into a large plastic container with a lid.<br />
<br />
Jerry didn’t know what to say or think. The lean and healthy looking boyfriend now looked like a binge eater who attended eating competitions around the globe. Mike’s ass looked so big that he could have easily crushed a melon if he accidentally sat on it. Mike’s short stature and his hoodie made him look like a big green apple with limbs and head. Jerry saw that Mike now had big man boobs, or as the internet called them moobs, that made two dents under the hoodie. His two tree trunks sized legs made Mike’s large belly to jiggle whenever he moved forward.</p>
