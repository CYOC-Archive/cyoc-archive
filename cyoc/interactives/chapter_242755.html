<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">None of them knew what would really happen when they initiated the change. They understood the Chronivac would do to them something similar to what it&#39;d done to Lucy. But what she experienced, what’d actually happened to her, short of becoming a monkey, they didn&#39;t fully grasp.<br />
<br />
Natalie, upon clicking and stepping back from the computer, was overcome with a strange ticklish-sensation combined with one she couldn&#39;t put into words. Expressing herself in body language, she shivered and began to move about as if she need to badly pee. Suddenly uncomfortable with her clothes, they felt hot and rubbed against her body in the wrong way. Moving as fast as she could, she pulled off her shirt, kicked off her shoes, undid the front of her pants, hooked her thumbs, which had started to grow thin and elongated, into the waist band of her jeans and underwear and push them down.<br />
<br />
Socks the last to be taken off, she shivered again, and as she did, her skin began to take on a blue, pink, green, and yellow iridescent, splotchy, scaly appearance. Her face began to elongate, whilst her hair regressed backward and her ears flattened against her skull. Starting to shrink, as her height and weight dropped spines formed along the top of her head, tracked back down the back of it, followed her spine, and as she started to grow a long, whip-like tail, the spines, which had taken on a medium-to-dark pink hue, grew along it. Reptilian eyes developing, she shook her now scale-covered head and hissed up at the two, Felicity and Jennifer, looking down at her. Her mind going into a mental tug-of-war over whether it was human or beast, the human one out. But, before Natalie could do anything about, and as her feet and hands finished morphing into three-toed, clawed appendages, she blinked, and the world around her vanished.<br />
<br />
As this was occurring, Diana, then Tanya clicked on the option to initiate their changes. Watched by Lucy, who&#39;d climbed down from the back of the chair, she observed as first Diana, then Tanya began to transform. Diana shrinking faster than the other girl, she stumbled a step forward, and in the process lost her shoes and socks. Working at the shoulder straps, she eventually pushed down on them off and as they dropped, she stepped out of bib-overalls she had on. White fur sprouting all over her body, she hissed as a tingly sensation washed over her and flexed her hands, causing claws to pop out of each of her fingers, she was oblivious to how she was regressing in age. Blinking eyes now a shade of sapphire blue as her hands, fingers, toes, and feet morphed into paws, she spat out her human teeth, which were replaced by the needle-sharp teeth of a cat, and again hissed as she was forced to drop to all fours.<br />
<br />
The bodysuit she had on slipped off, and taking a mere passing glance at, Diana stepped away from it. Losing interest, she sat down and looked around her world from the perspective of a kitten. And as her ears took on a point and slid up her head, inside her mind, a mental battle waged inside her as to which would be in control; her human or her animal.<br />
<br />
Tanya also changing at about the same time, she never had a chance to do anything as her transformation immediately forced her down onto the floor. Her body taking on a soft feeling as morphed from human skin to fabric, she felt as if she was going to be sick as her insides vanished and became batting. But unable to open her mouth, as it had fused together, her lips had vanished and were replaced by a sewn-on mouth, she started to panic. Questioning her choice as faux fur sprouted across her body, she would have first groaned, then screamed, as her nipples vanished, her crotch completely smoothed out, leaving her sexless, then she lost her sight. Eyes closing, the eyelids melded in place, and as her eyeballs disappeared, stitched eyes appeared.<br />
<br />
When she at last regained her vision back, the transforming girl was only mildly relieved. Unable to blink, to do anything but sit and stare at the naked form of Diana as she morphed in front of her, Tanya was painfully aware of how she couldn&#39;t feel anything anymore. Frightened to be trapped in the form she&#39;d chosen, she was unaware of how her arms, hands and fingers became front legs, paws and what appeared to be the sewn appearance of toes. As this happened, her back end morphed to become all one piece. And as she took on the appearance of a plush sitting, a cloth tail sprouted and black spots shaded in an irregular spotting pattern over her plush hide. Ears lengthening, taking on a floppy appearance, the last thing to change was her nose and mouth, which joined together and then pushed outward into a plush muzzle, complete with a black nose on the end, and a stitched mouth which made it look as if she was smiling.<br />
<br />
All three changes taking no more than five minutes, it wasn&#39;t long before Felicity and Jennifer were left staring at a pile of clothes and Lucy was looking at a kitten and plush toy sitting inside Tanya’s dress. Each staring in awe, it was Felicity who broke the silence by asking, &quot;Um, can anyone explain where Natalie went?&quot;</p>
