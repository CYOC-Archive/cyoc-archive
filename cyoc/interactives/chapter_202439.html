<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan woke up first again. &quot;Ugh... So damn stiff...&quot; he complained as he got up. Scratching his butt a bit, he moved to get off the bed and fell down. &quot;Ow! What the fuck?!&quot; Dan rubbed his head as he took a look at his surroundings. &quot;What in the?! Everything&#39;s so freaking big. Ah! My voice! What&#39;s with my voice?!&quot; Dan looked down. &quot;My body! It&#39;s so tiny! What the hell is going on?!&quot; Dan looked around the unfamiliar room and saw someone else sleeping in the bed he was in. A kid who looked even younger then he was. But he recognized him. &quot;Mike?! Mike, what are you... MMmmmm!&quot; But before he could wake him up, someone came up from behind and grabbed him by the mouth and legs. &quot;Now, this isn&#39;t good at all. A boy like you shouldn&#39;t speaking such adult words.&quot; Dan looked from behind and saw an unfamiliar man. No, it was someone he recognized. The dreams came flooding back to him. &quot;Mitts Mew!&quot; he said through muffled voice. It was the magician he had met sometime ago, although it felt like it was just a few hours ago. <br />
<br />
The Magician said nothing as he led Dan out of the room. &quot;Mmgh! Mmgh!&quot; Dan tried to break free, but his tiny body was no match for the grown man. He was brought into another room and thrown onto the floor. &quot;Guh!&quot; Before he could even move, the Magician flicked his wand and brought him into the air. &quot;Ugh! Let me go, you fucking freak!&quot; &quot;Like I said, language boy. You must be punished for speaking such foul language for a kid your age!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m an adult man! Not a fucking kid!&quot; &quot;Clothus Disappearus!&quot; Dan&#39;s clothes vanished from his body leaving him naked once more. &quot;Ah!&quot; &quot;A man does not look like this an he most certainly doesn&#39;t have a penis of this size.&quot; the Magician said as he raised Dan&#39;s penis with his wand. &quot;Ah! Don&#39;t touch it you perv!&quot; &quot;I must say, I never expected this to happen. For you to regain your memories. But no matter. I have made sure to have a plan for things like this.&quot; The Magician moved Dan towards a crib in the room. There, Dan saw a baby inside. &quot;What the fuck?! You kidnapping infants now too you sicko?!&quot; &quot;My, don&#39;t you remember? This isn&#39;t some random child. It&#39;s the product of you and your son after all.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;....What?!&quot; Dan couldn&#39;t believe his ears. This child was his and... Mike&#39;s? &quot;Quit playing games, you freak!&quot; &quot;My, but I&#39;m deadly serious my boy!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m not a fucking boy! I&#39;m a man! And so is Mike! Two guys can&#39;t make babies!&quot; &quot;But you forget, I&#39;m a magician. This is simple for me.&quot; &quot;No! No! I refuse to believe it! You can&#39;t fool! Ugh!&quot; The Magician pulled Dan&#39;s head back. &quot;Then allow me to help you with your memory problem.&quot; The Magician pulled his wand up and brought it to Dan&#39;s head. &quot;Stop! What are you doing?!&quot; &quot;Memorus Returnus!&quot; &quot;Guh! Agh!&quot; Dan jerked his body back even more as images flooded his brain at a rapid rate. The dreams and his memories hit a blank after he and Mike were brought into the Magician&#39;s house, but now he was getting a speed run of the last three day. About an hour every millisecond. What the magician did to break him the first time, to all the sex he had with his own child, even with himself, to all the pissing and shitting himself he had done and of course to the gender change he had undergone where he did the impossible and had conceived a new life with another man, his son.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guh! Guh! Guh!&quot; Dan let out grunts as his mind was raped with these disturbing images. His eyes pulled halfway into his skull and a look of ecstasy crept onto his face. His tiny penis shot up immediately and cummed a second later. And then cummed again. &quot;Guh! Ahh!&quot; As Dan finished regaining his memory, the Magician let him go and onto the floor again. &quot;Gah! Ugh!&quot; With new found movement, Dan went straight to his prick and started jerking off. &quot;Oh yeah! Oh yeah!&quot; Dan smiled as he took care of business. The Magician smiled in return and continued to watch as Dan cummed yet again. He kept jerking off as he did and more cum soon followed. &quot;My...&quot; The magician said as he took control of Dan&#39;s body again. &quot;Ah! No! I wanna touch my wiener some more!&quot; The magician smiled at that word, knowing that it meant he had broken Dan&#39;s mind yet again. &quot;Now, now! Only good boys get to do that.&quot; &quot;Imma good boy though! I am!&quot; &quot;You&#39;re a good boy, who?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m a good boy, Daddy! I wanna touch my pee-pee some more sir!&quot; &quot;Good, good! Bodus Stretchus!&quot; Dan knew what those words meant as he easily wrapped his penis into his own mouth. &quot;Mm! Mm! Mmph!&quot; Dan continued his his own blowjob as the magician brought his back into the room with Mike. &quot;Mghhhh!&quot; As they entered, Dan cummed into his mouth. &quot;Mwah! So good! So good!&quot; &quot;Mmm... Yawn! What&#39;s goin&#39; on...?&quot; &quot;Rise and shine my boy!&quot; &quot;Hmm... Daddy and... Danny! No fair, Daddy! Why does Danny get to play early?!&quot; &quot;Oh, don&#39;t you worry about that. Right, Danny boy?&quot; &quot;Hee, hee! Yeah! I&#39;ll play with you now though!&quot; The magician took that as his cue and let Dan back on the bed. Dan wasted no time as he put his penis into Mike&#39;s mouth. &quot;Mmgh! Mmmph!&quot; The Magician left them there, content in the fact he could control them forever.</p>
