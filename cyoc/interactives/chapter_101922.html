<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thanks for explaining the differences between the Earths Masked Writer.<br />
<br />
Dawn found the Stovalls, the Twists, and Martha Anderson waiting impatiently for word of Julie Stovall.<br />
Upon the ambulance&#39;s arrival, she had been rushed directly from the emergency room into the intensive care unit.<br />
There, doctors examined and reexamined Julie around the clock while monitoring her vital signs, but all test results were the same.<br />
Julie Stovall had not made any kind of suicide attempt.<br />
She had not suffered a heart attack and was not suffering from any form of (until now) undiagnosed life threatening disease.<br />
The were-mermaid had just somehow, tragically, lost the will to live.<br />
Doctor Tora Tachibana finally came out to tell her parents and the others what was going on a little after six that morning. &quot;Sorry to keep you waiting,&quot; he said, bowing while apologizing. After bringing them up to date, he concluded by saying, &quot;And while her vital signs are stable at the moment, they are also far below what a normal human being, let alone what a were-mermaid&#39;s should be.&quot;<br />
Martin Stovall asked, &quot;What can we do?&quot;<br />
&quot;That depends,&quot; replied the doctor. &quot;Do any of you know an Eric Anderson?&quot;<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
The subject of Doctor Tachibana&#39;s question had spent a (he would later freely admit) wonderful night with the she-wolf Cassie O&#39;Sullivan, a fellow high school Freshman who had not only taken his virginity, but ushered him into the werewolf lifestyle as well.<br />
The initial sex was okay, for Eric had nothing to actually compare it to. His first transformation was sensational.<br />
The later, more elongated session of intimacy between them lasted for several hours, and might have still continued if not for the sunrise that signaled that all weres in public must revert back to their human forms, was beyond belief to his young mind.<br />
Eric&#39;s first journey back from were to human felt like saying goodbye to a very close friend, but he knew that was temporary at best.<br />
But it was the time he and Cassie spent just sitting there, she consoling him before their were-libidos got the best of them, that Eric truly liked the best.<br />
Now the two of them were walking through the forest, side by side and as naked as the day they were born in search of clothing, that Eric truly stopped to look at her.<br />
In human form they were about the same height now, although he was a couple of inches taller than the she-wolf in lupine form.<br />
But there was something about her dark auburn hair and green eyes, along with the slight patch of red between her legs, as well as the beginning buds of her future breasts and as yet unshaped hips that Eric was starting to find physically attractive as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about ripping your clothes off last night. Heat of the moment,&quot; explained Cassie, noting the pile that Eric carried in his hands.<br />
&quot;I understand. Besides, they probably wouldn&#39;t fit now anyway,&quot; replied Eric. While slightly taller now than before, he had gained a lot more muscle mass. His arms and legs were seriously more defined than they used to be. Even his chest looked more toned. <i>Not bad for a serious bookworm,</i> thought Eric. He had managed to squeeze back into his underwear, but was uncertain if his shoes and socks would still fit. The rest of last night&#39;s outfit was a lost cause.<br />
&quot;Well, there&#39;s my backpack,&quot; said Cassie, pointing to a pink <i>Hello Kitty</i> satchel sitting by a tree. She picked it up with one hand, then turned to look at Eric. &quot;Listen, despite all the other stuff that happened,&quot; she began, referring to the situation with the mayor&#39;s daughter, &quot;I did have a great time, and you were certainly marvelous once you got the hang of things.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Eric in disbelief, as he felt his face starting to blush again.<br />
&quot;Yes. I hope Julie Stovall gets better, but if things don&#39;t work out between you and her now...&quot;<br />
Then Cassie O&#39;Sullivan took the risk of dropping her backpack while putting her arms around Eric and kissing him. Her nude body pressing against his. Her hardening nipples teasing the slight patch of chest hair he now had.<br />
Eric Anderson got lost in the moment, wrapping his arms around Cassie while pulling her closer. His hands drifting down to caress her hips and rear. His penis was not only quickly becoming quite erect, but threatening to rip off his underwear in the process.<br />
Eric was giving serious thought to lying the girl on the ground and taking her right then and there, but an &quot;AHEM!&quot; broke their concentration.<br />
<br />
What the two teenagers didn&#39;t know was that Eric&#39;s older brother Nate and friendly next door neighbor Ben Twist had been watching them since the start of the kiss.<br />
Searching for Eric and finding him with her, Ben had just turned to Nate and smiled, a sign confirming Ben&#39;s theory that if things didn&#39;t work out between the new werewolf and the were-mermaid, Cassie might make Eric happy in the future.<br />
Nate had simply nodded in agreement, but when things looked like they were about to seriously progress further than just kissing, that was when he cleared his throat.<br />
&quot;Err... hi guys,&quot; was all Eric could say. He felt a bit shy about his current state of undress, considering that the older teenagers were dressed for the day. Being a more experienced were, Cassie seemed unphased by standing naked before everyone.<br />
&quot;Hello yourself,&quot; said Ben.<br />
&quot;Sorry to interrupt, but we&#39;ve got to get going,&quot; added Nate in a more serious tone of voice.<br />
&quot;Julie?&quot; asked Eric, now ashamed that he had been so lost in Cassie that he forgot all about her.<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll explain on the way,&quot; promised Ben.<br />
&quot;But I don&#39;t have anything to wear,&quot; Eric pointed out.<br />
&quot;Been there, done that,&quot; said Nate. &quot;I brought some stuff of dad&#39;s that will fit you now,&quot; he added, holding up his backpack. &quot;You can dress in the back seat as we go.&quot;<br />
Eric turned back to face his new friend and said, &quot;Cassie, I—&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay. I&#39;ll see you in school Monday, but if you can, please call me and let me know how things go. Ben has my number,&quot; she said.<br />
Then Cassie gave Eric a quick peck on the cheek while lightly running a finger through his new patch of chest hair.<br />
With that Cassie turned and left, refusing to let Eric see her cry.</p>
