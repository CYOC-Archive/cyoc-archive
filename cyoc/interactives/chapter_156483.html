<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(I’ll be honest. I like a good bit of backstory before I get to my intentions. Try and stay awake, I’ll make sure this a good one.<br />
 - Rose)<br />
<br />
October, appropriately named, was a witch. She was 16 years old.<br />
<br />
A witch’s powers are truly unearthed when they’re 12 years old, but October had always been magically powerful as a part of the Tyra bloodline. Her great grandmother was known as The Great Sorceress. A very gifted witch, who put a lot of effort into her witchcraft. Her daughter followed, October’s grandmother, who had passed around 7 years before October was born. The Great Sorceress’ daughter was also very magically powerful. But didn’t put as much work into her magical studies and practicing. She’d win any duel, with little to no effort. She gave birth to one child, her son; Sorin.<br />
<br />
Sorin looked up to his grandmother highly. He respected her work and effort and understood why she had lived so long. He was both a powerful wizard, and another well respected wizard of the Tyra bloodline, unlike his mother.<br />
<br />
October was born, her father, Sorin. Her mother mortal, Mandy.<br />
October had a chance to grow up in the mortal world and was familiar of the coincidence of the popular character Sabrina, the Teenage Witch.<br />
<br />
October walked through the portal clutching around 3 very large books. She walked through her front door and slammed them on the table,<br />
“Three new books? Don’t you have enough downstairs?” Her mother asked, jumping slightly when she slammed the books down,<br />
“No. This one has some very ancient spells I haven’t seen before,” October said, pointing at the dark blue book. October had a posh voice, retaining an element of British, but mostly covered up by a still posh American accent, “and this one has some more recent spells!” She pointed at the green book, smiling. Excited,<br />
“And let me guess,” her mother, Mandy, started, “this one is for spells just in the middle? Not brand new, but not yet classified as ancient,”<br />
“That one appears to be...” October’s father waltz into the dining room, a mug of coffee hovering in front of his left shoulder surrounded by a red mist. He leaned over, his wife, Mandy’s shoulder, “a book of potions,”<br />
“Exactly! Thank you Father,”<br />
October steeped up the books with the same red mist and levitated them to herself. She grasped them tightly as she made her way to a bookshelf. She attempted to move her hands without dropping the books. She was failing miserably. Sorin walked a few feet behind her and swished his hand, the bookcase swung open,<br />
“Thank you, Father,” October said without looking behind her. She made her way into the bookcase and walked down the stairs inside. The door, or bookcase rather, closed behind her.<br />
<br />
Sorin walked to his wife and sat down in front of her at the dining table. Before there was even a silence to be broken, Mandy spoke,<br />
“I love that she’s so invested in learning all this witch, magic stuff. But is there going to be a point where shes interested in boys? Or even girls? She has never even talked about a peer that she thinks is cute.”<br />
“Maybe she’s just not that kind of girl,” Sorin shrugged, “she’s a lot like her great grandmother.”<br />
“Yeah. But your grandmother had your mother. So she must have been interested in some sort of man?”<br />
“No, actually. I could swear I’ve told you before. Perhaps not,” Sorin began, “my grandmother had many children. When a witch’s power reaches a certain point, it can become too much. She dispersed her power into a physical form. My mother. I am made pure, but my mother isn’t a natural birth. I was a natural birth. As was our October.”<br />
“Huh.” Mandy said, “that’s interesting. And no, you haven’t told me. A story like that, I’d remember it.”<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Meanwhile her parents talked, October laid out her new books in front of her. She opened the red potion book first. She tried to mix a potion that would make someone taller. She mixed it wrong. She wanted to take a sample of it however. She hadn’t any spare vials around, she grabbed a glass of water she had brought down that morning. She threw the water into one of her empty cages. She scooped up the potion and poured it into the glass. The potions colour was a darkish black. Best described as the same colour as coke. She didn’t want to get herself confused and accidentally drink a failed potion, so she placed it on one of the empty desks.<br />
<br />
She lifted the cauldron with her red mist magic. It might have been magic, and the weight might had been reduced, but it was still heavy. She heaved it up and lifted it to a portal next to her. She poured it all out into the portal. The portal lead to an infinite abyss.<br />
<br />
There was a fairly new spell, it was unregistered for practical use and wasn’t recommended but October always tried. Maybe this one would be a challenge. The spell was for the perfect apple. To take an apple and make it perfect. A perfect taste, a perfect shape. A perfect apple. October performed the spell near perfectly. She didn’t stutter on the incantation, but she could tell that she had done one thing wrong. She put the apple on that same table. <br />
<br />
She decided to try one more thing, an ageing potion. She mix the right ingredients, perfect timing, perfect everything. The supposed white mixture, meant to make a person younger by around 5 years, was grey, discoloured and looked more like old age than a youthful brew. She grabbed another glass and poured the mixture in. Placing it on the same table as the apple and the failed height potion. She huffed at herself.<br />
<br />
“Why can’t I get this right. I’m the great granddaughter of The Great Sorceress! I should be amazing at this!” She slammed her hands on the desk with the books on it. <br />
<br />
She lifted her head up. In front of her, a very complicated spell was displayed in her Ancient Spells book,<br />
<br />
 “The Predecessor”<br />
She read more into it,<br />
“This spells will allow a magic user to gain the power of a former witch or wizard. As long as they are deceased and in that magic users bloodline.”<br />
<br />
“This one is going to take a whole night and maybe more, worth of studying to get perfect. I will make sure this is perfect as well. I better make myself some coffee.” She grabbed the book and rushed upstairs.<br />
<br />
A nights worth of studying takes place. October will make an amazing spell succeed extraordinarily or fail tremendously. <br />
And what will happen to those failed potions on that desk.<br />
You choose to read, or you choose to write your own story.<br />
