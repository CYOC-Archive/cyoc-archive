<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ann sighed as she settled into her seat. School had already been a bore and watching her sister Gloria parade around with her boyfriend Nate had only soured her mood. As she and her friends settled into Mr. Harris’s class with her sister, she could only glumly stare off into space. <br />
<br />
“Hey Ann,” Stephanie whispered.<br />
<br />
Ann turned towards her friend, a glum look on her face. “What,” she sighed.<br />
<br />
Stephanie and Michelle inched closer to their friend as they quickly looked back at where Gloria and the others sat. “You’re going to Samantha’s wedding right?” Ann nodded, she and Gloria were going but not as official members of the bridal party. Katie and Samantha had asked the two girls if they would be willing to push Lynne and Morgan down the aisle. Samantha had gotten the idea of useing the two infants as flower girls for her wedding with Mike. Since both girls were two young to walk, Katie had nominated her little sisters to act as the flower girls legs. While The two girls were excited to be in an actual wedding, Ann’s mood quickly dampened as she realized she would be a stand in for a flower girl. “Yeah I’m going,” she groaned.<br />
<br />
“Well can you bring a date,” Michelle asked. Ann shrugged, she could. Gloria had invited Nate, Ann had rolled her eyes when the couple had gone to try on clothes. Despite Ann and Jackie being an item, she had yet to work up the courage to ask her. “Yeah But I don’t know.”<br />
<br />
“Seriously Ann,” Stephanie groaned. “Will you just suck it up and ask her already. She’s your freaking girlfriend.” Before Ann could respond, Mr. Harris entered the room. Ann and the other students quickly quieted down as Mr Harris smiled. “Good morning class,” he said. “I need every one to turn to Chapter 12 in their books. We’re going to discuss the Reconstruction of the South after the Civil War today.”<br />
<br />
As Ann and the others turned to the appropriate page Ann began to find herself daydreaming. Brining Jackie to a wedding was a huge deal. Sure they were a couple but this would be the first time this many people had seen the girls together. How many questions would they have to answer? Would people give the two teens odd looks for being a couple? As Ann stared at Mr. Harris she gave him a small smile.<br />
<br />
Derrick Harris was a handsome young man and someone Ann had know for years. She remembered how she had a crush on the teacher when she was 12. At the time Derrick had been a college grad and just seemed like the coolest guy in the world. As Ann continued to daydream she wondered, what would it be like to actually date Derrick, like Ms, Morgan was. Ann sighed as she imagined the handsome teacher as a teen. What would he be like? Would he think Ann was cute? What would it be like to kiss him?<br />
<br />
“Ann? Ann!” Stephanie hissed.<br />
<br />
Startled Ann now turned towards her friend who was now gesturing towards Mr. Harris. Ann turned, gasping at what she saw.<br />
<br />
Derrick Harris had been reduced to a 15 year old teen at the front of the class. The brunette teen continued to teach the class as if nothing was wrong. Derrick appeared to have slimmed down quite a bit as he now held up his too loose slacks on his narrower hips. Ann noticed Derricks voice also appeared to be higher while he had shrank a few inches during his regression. While she still found the boy to be handsome he was definitely now just a boy. Quickly looking around the classroom Ann could see that only her and her friend seems to have noticed Derricks changes. <br />
<br />
“Ann how come Gloria and the others haven’t noticed,” Michelle whispered. Ann shrugged, the rings wee funny sometimes. Gloria and Ann had each done age changes where only the person who had activated the change noticed. For Ann it was somewhat frustrating, it appeared that those whose magic was more chaotic experienced this problem more often, meaning Ann had experienced this more than Gloria.<br />
<br />
“Shit,” she whispered. “Give me a sec.” Focusing her magic Ann now tried to age Derrick back to 25. Scrunching up her nose she willed Derrick older. Slowly but surely she watched as their teenage teacher grew back to 25. Derricks face lost its smoothness as he grew older while he grew back a few inches and regained the weight he had lost. As Derrick once more became 25 he swooned slightly, adjusting his clothes which seemed mysteriously out of place. Ann let out a sigh as Gloria turned back towards her. Despite not seeing Derrick go from 25 to 15 and back again she was aware enough of age changes. Frowning. She shook her head, causing Ann to blush, she would be hearing a motherly lecture from Gloria after class.<br />
<br />
As class ended Ann watched as her girlfriend now approached her. Stephanie and Michelle went silent as they fell back to allow the couple to talk. “Ann you feeling okay?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah just tired I guess,” Ann responded. From the corner of her eye she could see her friends encouraging her to ask Jackie to the wedding. “Say um Jackie,” Ann murmured. “Listen, I um...I’m going to be in Samantha’s wedding. It’s dumb but...um,,,would you like, to...um...be my date?”<br />
<br />
Jackie’s eyes went wide before she smiled, giving her girlfriend a gentle peck on the lips. “Was wondering when you were going to ask me,” she smirked. “But yeah, I would love to be your date.”<br />
<br />
Ann smiled, as Jackie now headed for her next class. The goth teen leaned back happy but stunned that she would actually have someone she cared for at this wedding.</p>
