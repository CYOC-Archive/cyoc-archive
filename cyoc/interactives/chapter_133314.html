<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not too far away from the trio of proud military men, a car pulled up. It. s occupants were horrified by the scene they&#39;d arrive at. The three lesbians got out of the vehicle to look around, wondering how and where this &quot;Christian Pride&quot; parade had come from.<br />
<br />
One of them, blue-haired Raye, was especially worried. She&#39;d left to pick up two of the guest speakers for the Pride March, leaving behind her girlfriend Ami. Now it seemed like the homophobes had overrun everything. The others, a pair of savvy activists from New York named Tamara and Patrica, were equally displeased but for different reasons. They&#39;d been looking forward to the rally, eager to help their fellow queers build a base of support in the heart of so-called &#39;Red State America&#39;.<br />
<br />
The trio walked towards where the gathering point for the pride march was, only to hear insulting catcalls from some people near by. They ignored their homohobic taunts, not realizing that their taunters had once been their fellow gays. But it was too late now, for the curse had attached themselve to the three lesbians, and only needed to be triggered...<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
Tamara hugged her lover Patrica, offering some comfort as they walked through a sea of red, white and blue streamers. They&#39;d seen a few bits of rainbow here and there. Each of them felt a bit of attraction at that moment, and sealed their fates.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, Raye fretted about, wondering where her Ami was. Had the &#39;Christians&#39; kidnapped her? Or worse, had they hurt her? She held back tears, her mind focused on finding her baby. Not quite lust but there was some real love and attraction among all the anxiety and that was enough for her transformation to begin.<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
The two out-of-towners were dressed in slacks and blouses. They wore little jewelry and even less make-up. They had decent bodies but neither of them care to flaunt for the world to see. But now that was about to change.<br />
<br />
Tamara&#39;s slacks began rolling up her legs, leaving only tanned skin over toned muscle in the wake. Reaching her now thickening thighs, the tubes tighten around them as the material shifted from wool to denim, the blue bleeding out of the grey. Her unremarkable ass began to bloat with muscle and fat, pulling the developing daisy dukes even tighter. The roundness of her new buttocks was matched by a widening of her hips, giving her that perfect country girl bottom. <br />
<br />
Patricia&#39;s pants changed in a similar manner, only becoming a pair of super tight khaki short-shorts. Her legs gained tone that emphaised her femininity, but they didn&#39;t grow all that much longer. In fact, they seemed like they might be a bit shorter. But the growth of her thighs and ass more than made up for that, as her shorts were pulled taut across the front and the back. <br />
<br />
Both women&#39;s bellies were exposed as their blouses rolled up and began to gain a checked pattern, red over white for Tamara and blue over white for Patricia. Their revealed cores tightened up, and pulled in a bit, giving them hourglass figures. But whereas Tamara&#39;s spine lengthened and she grew taller, Patricia seemed to once more shrink a bit. <br />
<br />
While their developing gingham shirts tied off just under swelling bustlines, the two lesbians found their sexuality under assault! Images of hunky men in cowboy hats flooded their memories of one another, pushing them apart as a couple but ensuring they remained each other&#39;s best gal pal. There were more than enough guys for two faithful good old girls like them  to share<br />
<br />
Now tanned all over, the final phases of their phyiscal changes began. Their shoes twisted and contorted, transforming comfortable flats into black leather cowboy boots for Tamara and brown for Patricia. Around each of their necks, a chain with a silver cross appeared, as make-up began highlighting their faces. Arched eyebrows and high cheeks, plump red lips and perfect smiles became more apparent. The dark hair of each woman lightened more and more, settling into a sandy blonde. Only their hair styles differed, with Tamara gaining a semi-beehive that emphasized her tallness, while Patricia&#39;s hair pulled itself into twin pigtails that heightened her daintiness.<br />
<br />
In their mind, their disappoinment at missing the Pride Rally shifted. They had come not to support those gays but to comdemn them! As their prejudice and bias grew, their identities transitioned fully over to something a lot more country than they&#39;d been urban, as Tamara gave way to Tammy and Patricia became Patty. The two new country gal pals had come to celebrate their faith and maybe find some new guys if their other friend was right... <br />
<br />
====<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the curse had worked its power on the helpless Raye with delight. Her outfit had shifted from rebellious lesbian to some much more conservative. Flannel had bleached itself white and stiff, as a wide collar surrounded her now slender neck, just above her generous and ample cleavage . A mini skirt of black denim had become a blue cotton dress that drifted down gently past her knees, allowing a glimpse of her long and lovely legs. Her workmen&#39;s boots were torn asunder and reformed into a pair of thick heeled shoes.<br />
<br />
Internally,  Raye tried to hold onto her memories but increasing they were being overwritten by new ones. Her old life was fading away into a haze of being brought up as a righteous preacher&#39;s daughter. She could feel a welling up of pride in her faith that served to wither away her attraction to other women. After all, God had created Woman to be with Man, had he not? <br />
<br />
As reflection of her new faith, a silver cross popped into existence on her blouse collar as  matching earrings piercing her ears. The rainbow colored metal bracelets she&#39;d been wearing fused into a single mass and flowed up her face, past plumping lips and a thinning chin. Settling atop her cute nose, the metal became a pair of silver framed glasses that emphasized her dazzling blue eyes. Her once blue hair turned brunette and grew past her shoulders before pulling itself into a perfect braid that hung down the center of her back. <br />
<br />
Her hands, now with red polish on lengthened nails, reached out to grip a sign that said &#39;No More Queers!&quot;. The last bit of the old Raye was horrified at the sign&#39;s words, but that washed away by the pride of the newly formed Rhea Hawthorne, who now turned to her two friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;Girls, I think those fellas are around here somewhere...&quot;<br />
<br />
The curse now began to pull the ladies towards the trio of soldiers, as connections began to form. Rhea found herself moving towards Marcus, as knowledge of their parents&#39; friendship filled each of their memories, with gold promise rings curling around their respective ring fingers. Tammy gravitated toward the tall drink of manly water that was Jonathon, both fully aware  they knew they had similar tastes in country music and fine American beer. Finally, Patty was standing next to David, feeling comfortable to know such a strong and straight man was there to protect her from any of those filthy lesbians who might lust after her petite frame, leaning into his strong arm as he wrapped it around her. <br />
<br />
The three new couples kissed and began to walk towards the center of the town to catch up with the rest of the marchers...<br />
<br />
====<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the Hawthrones and the Gospels had come across the gay bar that was supposed to have the final destination of the now forgotten pride march. Their collective anger at the establishment known as the Peacock Lounge knew no bounds...</p>
