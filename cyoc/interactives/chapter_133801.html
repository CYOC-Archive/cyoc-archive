<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After their marathon fuck session the three were&#39;s laid quietly on the sawdust floor of the tent dozing contently.  Jack and Carlos snuggling on both sides of Alex&#39;s broad frame while he had his massive arms wrapped tightly around the two as if to signal to all; these two belonged to him and they were his responsibility and to make sure they were safe from all harm.  In his mind Alex didn&#39;t feel love exactly towards the two males but more of a sense of duty much like a feral stallion has towards his herd.  Yes, that&#39;s it these two were the beginning of his herd and as the alpha stallion he needed to grow the herd, make it stronger.  As he thought he came to the realization that not only did they need to change more males but females as well.  <br />
<br />
Before his change he was 100% hetero but along with his physical changes came changes to his mind as well.  He still held an attraction to females but now it included the desire of males as well.  His mind was a mass of jumbled thoughts and ideas.  He knew his transformation was permanent that much he was sure of  but how can he make it more.  Yeah the sex was beyond incredible and the increased physical strength and endurance along with his added confidence made the loss of his human form a fair trade off but he wanted it to mean more.  <br />
<br />
As he continued to think his two herd mates began to stir.  He looked down at Carlos and Jack, watching them as both began to wake from their slumber.  He stretched his head to snuffle at each of their heads drinking in their scents, admiring their stunning forms.  Suddenly an idea popped into his head, even if he wasn&#39;t human anymore he was still a soldier, a soldier with all the training and knowledge of the finest fighting force on the planet, a Marine dammit!<br />
<br />
Deep into his thoughts Alex failed to notice the other two stallions had fully awaken and were now beginning to make themselves known.  While Carlos was sliding his hoofed tip hand up along Alex&#39;s abs finally rubbing at his nipple Jack had moved down and began to lick Alex&#39;s sheathed penis with his long thick tongue.  Brought out of his deep thoughts Alex gave out a long soft whinny feeling his stallionhood flood with blood and snaking out of it&#39;s warm home. <br />
<br />
Pushing through his desire to give in and pick up where they left off last night with their mutual coitus Alex forced himself to push back at his carnal thoughts and began to sit up and move to a standing position thus in turn leaving his two companions on the floor with yearning lust filled eyes.  With his brain clearing him all of things physical he cleared his throat.  &quot;Gentlemen, I have been thinking about our situation and I&#39;ve come to a conclusion on how we should proceed&quot;.  &quot;What do you mean by proceed? Jack said.  Clearing his throat again &quot;I mean we need a plan on how we are going to take what has happened to us and make the most of it&quot;.  Carlos chimed in &quot;I think what we did last night was pretty obvious to us all don&#39;t you think&quot;?  &quot;Well yes that was one aspect of what I meant but what I was saying there is a bigger issue at hand that with proper planning it could lead to a great change in our war with the enemy&quot;.  &quot;So what your saying is we just fuck the enemy into submission&quot; said Jack.   Carlos began to slide his hand up and down his semi flacid cock. &quot;Ummm now that sounds like a sound tactical plan&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys!  Please!  could you please think with you&#39;re other head for just a moment and listen to what I have to say&quot;.  What I&#39;m trying to say is with our new found strength, endurance and stamina along with our Marine training we could defeat the enemy and end the war.  Also, have you two noticed that after all the physical strain we put our bodies through last night we woke up well rested and without any aches or pains or feeling of fatigue to our bodies even though none of us has had anything to eat or drink in 12 hours!  Carlos piped up:  &quot;Well we did take in alot of protein in a manner of speaking&quot;.  Jack just rolled his eyes but by now was listening to what Alex had to say.  Jack said: &quot;Are you saying that with enough soldiers transformed into to were horses it would allow us to gain the upper hand and defeat the enemy once and for all&quot;?  &quot;Yes, that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying.  Now, we need to find a way to transform a large number of men and women without them realizing it.  In our current forms it will be pretty hard to try and change them one at a time.  Just as Alex finished his sentence Jack looked out the tent flap.  Sitting not 100 yards away was a large water tank that the camp used for drinking and meals.  &quot;Hey guys,  I think I just found our answer to our delima&quot;.</p>
