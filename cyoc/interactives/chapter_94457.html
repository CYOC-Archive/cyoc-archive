Jeff couldn’t believe it he was so close to getting his human life back and if it wasn’t because the Chronivac had scanned the wrong target in this moment he would be in two legs, able to speak human language, with his real parents, and without memories of his time as a dog, but no he was still a puppy.<br />
<br />
He felt scared and sad he had lost his life, his dad and his humanity. “Wait that’s not right or is it? Bancho is my biological father but the man that bought me in the pet shop was also my dad his name is…is…what was his name? was it Bancho? “ He thought. Jeff started to feel his mind to cloud “NO Bancho was the dog that was playing with me a few minutes ago, he turned into a…. no I´m wrong I was playing with my human how could I…. nnng that isn’t right either what´s happening to my mind?!”. While this was happening the human that had been Bancho went to the bathroom.      <br />
<br />
Then he realized what was happening he had set up reality shift so that when he return to be human no one remember his disappearance, but now in order to make everyone believe Bancho has always been him, the Chronivac was altering their minds, including his.        <br />
<br />
Trying everything he could to remember who he had been. He take a photo from one of his drawers with his muzzle, the photo show a picture of his little sister, his parents, and him. Jeff started saying to himself “THIS IS ME!, THIS IS ME!, THIS IS ME!” , but the reality shift and his instincts were stronger than he thought, after a few seconds he couldn’t recall what he was thinking about this photo. He put his paws in his muzzle and began to whimper, his tail wagging in frustration.   <br />
<br />
It was so much for his mind. His human memories were not disappearing but replaced by new ones, playing videogames and sports with his friends replaced with playing with his siblings, when he went in an exchange program to Spain with the day he was separated from his mother and sold to a pet shop, was his mom the female human in the passenger seat of the car that brought him to his new home or the black and brown german shepherd that nuzzle him when he was born? With a final howl like scream he collapsed in the ground and pass out. <br />
Jeff the puppy awake some time later, he didn’t know what had caused him so much fear that made him faint, but he didn´t care a lot right now, his stomach grumble, he let his instincts guide him, and began looking for something edible to eat. While he was searching he found a photo in the ground and stared at it, he remembered there was something important about it, but he couldn’t put his paw in it. His stomach grumble again and he forgot about it and continue searching, all he had in mind right now was getting his fill. The human that had been Bancho get out of the bathroom and walk back to his room. Seeing his namesake in what look to be hunger, he took Jeff down to the kitchen and put dog food in his bowl.<br />
<br />
The little alsatian look at his master and barked as if saying “thanks”.<br />
<br />
“There you go little me, enjoy your meal” Jeff said.<br />
<br />
He couldn’t understand much of what he was saying, but he was happy that he take care of him, he felt safe and relax whenever he was close to him, but also there was some kind of bond to him, Jeff wasn’t capable of understand it, but it was as if he had been a human, his human, “but that couldn’t be possible could be? His instincts took control again and return to his meal, forgetting about the strange though. After finishing the last morsel of his food, Jeff the human took him out to the backyard, to play with him, Jeff the puppy couldn’t wait, he was full of excitement. It was a simple and easy life, full of happiness. <br />
<br />
After all this had always been his life...</p>
