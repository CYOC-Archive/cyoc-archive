<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ric began. Josh interrupted every few sentences, but, after a half hour, they'd managed to be as precise as they could. 
<br>

<br>
 As Francisco and Marco understood it, they wanted: 
<br>

<br>
 1) to be grown-up, in the prime of manhood 
<br>

<br>
 2) mentally, if possible, but definitely physically 
<br>

<br>
 3) within the bounds of a normal bell curve of the population 
<br>

<br>
 4) to be macho studs, who women would crawl over broken glass to get to 
<br>

<br>
 5) to not have their sexual orientation changed 
<br>

<br>
 6) since Marco and Mr. Mendes were gay, to be made into what their idea of an ideal man was, since that was what they had to work with, but based on what
<br>
 they figured the women they knew would be most attracted to. 
<br>

<br>
 Francisco and Marco conferred, never letting go of the book. Francisco even wrote down some notes. Finally, they looked up. &quot;OK, hombres peque&ntilde;os, we're
<br>
 going to try it. Both of us, together, this time. And we always have the failsafe at the back of the book, all right?&quot; Ric and Josh nodded. 
<br>

<br>
 Francisco held the front half of the book, Marco the rear half and both began reading in unison. 
<br>

<br>
 Ric and Josh felt the changes almost immediately. Not a bad feeling, in fact, it felt good, better with each passing second. 
<br>

<br>
 Slowly at first, then more quickly, they began to gain height. Each had to slide his feet further apart to maintain balance. Their shoulders widened and faces became
<br>
 more carved and defined. Biceps and triceps began to bulge, Calves became taut. What Mother Nature might take years to accomplish was happening in only
<br>
 seconds. They were becoming men. 
<br>

<br>
 Hairs began snaking down the front and back of their legs. Pubic hair formed, expanding upward and sideways thickening and curling, finally trickling down their
<br>
 inner thighs. Each of their scrotums dropped lower, the weight of mature testicles succumbing to gravity, kinked hairs erupting on the underside and sparsely on the
<br>
 front. Their penises grew and thickened. Josh had always felt a little insecure in that area, at least in comparison to his brother Ric, but soon caught up and slightly
<br>
 outdistanced his older brother. 
<br>

<br>
 Five o'clock shadow appeared on their upper lips, chins and then cheeks. Each of them had to loosen and re-do the belt of his robe to comfortably accommodate
<br>
 his new body. 
<br>

<br>
 Francisco and Marco kept reading (it was a VERY long spell). 
<br>
 When Mr. Mendes stopped for a breath, Marco stopped, too, and nodded in satisfaction at the changes thus far. &quot;Not bad, lover,&quot; he whispered to Francisco.
<br>
 &quot;They're gonna be lady-killers, all right - and won't ever have to pay for a drink at a gay bar, either! Let's not forget the happy trail - I get off just thinking about
<br>
 yours - and I know it's right up there on your list of what turns you on about a guy.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Francisco nodded and pointed to where they'd left off. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;That's all, folks,&quot; he said at the end. Neither he nor Marco had yet dared look up. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Um, - gee that sounds weird - um, Ric? What about it?&quot; asked Josh, tentatively. He looked towards his brother. Marco and Francisco looked up simultaneously.
<br>
 All gasped audibly. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;You are one cool, buff dude, bro,&quot; Josh boomed in his now-deep voice. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;I don't know - I think you've got it over me. WOW!&quot; Ric said, looking at his brother, his voice lower than earlier, but not nearly as deep as Josh's. You look like
<br>
 every model and calendar pin-up I've ever heard about or seen.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Two strapping 29-year-olds, each about 6'-2&quot; stood where there had been but boys moments before. Strong, solid legs with dark straight hair on them poked
<br>
 from the bottom of their robes. The 'V' above the robe's belt opened to display chests that only years of workout could provide, with a small patch of the same
<br>
 straight dark hair in the center cleft and a matching, thinner cloud of hairs surrounding each dark nipple. 
<br>

<br>
 Muscles and tendons in the neck were oultined under clear, dark tan skin, and the faces - square-jawed, deep-set eyes - were -- well -- let's say they were both a
<br>
 living wet dream. 
<br>

<br>
 Francisco and Marco shook hands. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Uh, Josh, does your, um, belly button itch?&quot; Ric asked. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Yeah, a little,&quot; Josh answered. &quot;Why?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 As Francisco and Marco watched, the boys (no - strike that - the MEN) opened their robes, displaying equipment that caused both sets of eyes attached to the
<br>
 men on the couch to widen. 
<br>

<br>
 Ric and also Josh began scratching their navels. &quot;Maybe it's just that we're not used to all this new, um, hair!&quot; Ric exclaimed. 
<br>

<br>
 Marco saw it first. &quot;Look at that - I swear the trail is still growing!&quot; he whispered to Francvisco. 
<br>

<br>
 The dark narrow line of hairs from navel to crotch thickened and widened; then matching hairs began to form above the navel, moving up, up, to meet with the
<br>
 patch on each man's chest. But that wasn't the end. The trail of hairs, still moving vertically up the center line of each of them, kept moving north, as it were,
<br>
 crossing the collarbone and contuing up the neck, under and then atop the chin, the nose (the nose!) and forehead. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Turn around, quick!&quot; Mr. Mendes shouted. 
<br>

<br>
 Both Ric and Josh spun 180 degrees. &quot;What, what is it?&quot; thay asked. &quot;Probaly nothing - we just want to check,&quot; mr. medes reassured them.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Francisco and Marco both got up and each grabbed the collar of a robe and pulled the fabric down, nearly pinning the boys' arms in the tight folds of white cloth.
<br>
 They saw the same line of thick hairs, bushy now, and about as wide across as an average index finer, creep down the back of them both, disappearing into the
<br>
 crack, just visible above the robe's belt, of each of the newly-made man's tight, firm, indented butt. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;M-a-r-c-o!!&quot; Francisco grimaced. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;What? All I said was that we both were really into the trails, man. It's not like THIS is what I wished to happen!&quot; Marco responded curtly. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Back to the stinking book, then,&quot; Francisco answered back, as they both headed to the couch. 
<br>

<br>

<br>
 &quot;WHAT IS IT?&quot; both Ric and Josh pleaded, turning back. 
<br>

<br>
 Bare from the waist up, they now stared fixedly at one another, two virtual demi-gods, but each with an unexpected brushstroke of hairs bilaterally centered up and
<br>
 down their torso. 
<br>

<br>
 And then laughed.</p>
