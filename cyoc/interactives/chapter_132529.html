<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Quick Author&#39;s Note:<br />
<br />
I appreciate the fact that you decided to write your story variant, sometimes it takes a while to find someone who is interested to make the story arc deeper, and since you&#39;ve stumbled on this story variant you might as well try to see if the other ones catch your interest~<br />
<br />
Now onto the story.<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on boy! We have some work to deal with!&quot; Said Luke as he slowly mounted Emilia, in response Emilia quickly took flight, Luke noticed that Emilia flew faster, &quot;Woah! You&#39;re a fast one, ain&#39;t ya?&quot; he asked, while also petting Emilia, in response he gave a smug grin.<br />
<br />
After the two of them flew for hours, they reached another island that Emilia never knew of, while flying he noticed that he was still near Greece.<br />
<br />
Emilia quickly landed, Luke slowly got off Emilia, &quot;Come on boy, let&#39;s take you around town.&quot; said Luke as he patted Emilia lightly, &quot;Where are we going?&quot; asked Emilia suddenly, this made Luke laugh a little, &quot;Our home town ofcourse!&quot; he said with a smile, the two of them walked around a village, Emilia looked around and it looked perfect, he saw the lush green trees and grass, he saw both dragons and humans working together, he even saw some dragons staring at him, this made him gulp in emberassment, he even saw that some of the dragons played around with the children of the village.<br />
<br />
The two of them went to what it looked like a castle, they slowly reached the castle&#39;s gates, one of the guards approached them, &quot;Luke! You&#39;re back! His majesty said that you&#39;re needed at the throne, at this instant.&quot; the guard said only to then look at Emilia, &quot;I can see that you also found your dragon.&quot; he continued, Luke only laughed as he slowly patted Emilia, &quot;Yeah, i did.&quot; he said, only to then look at Emilia, &quot;Come on boy, you heard the guard, we need to go to the throne room right now.&quot; he said as the guard opened the gates and allowed them to enter the castle grounds.<br />
<br />
After minutes have passed of walking throughout the castle, they reached the throne room, they both saw a man that looked like he was in his 60&#39;s, but had a great appearance, long white hair, beautiful azure eyes and a muscular body, Emilia realized that near the man there was a white dragon, almost as tall as him, he smelled a weird scent that came from the dragon, confirming that the dragon is a she. The man slowly got up, &quot;Luke, perfect timing.&quot; he said in response Luke and Emilia quickly bowed, &quot;Your majesty, i heard that you require our help, what&#39;s the matter?&quot; asked Luke, the man slowly revealed a robe, Emilia recognized the robe, it was the same robe the cultists weared when they transformed him into a dragon, &quot;This... This is the matter.&quot; the man said, Luke sighed, &quot;Those guys don&#39;t quit now do they?&quot; he said as he crossed his arms, Emilia snorted in response, this made the dragoness lift her head and look at him, by just seeing the robes he felt disgusted, he remembered the massacre he caused after he transformed, a deep chuckle left his scaly lips, &quot;I can see that your dragon also hates those heretics.&quot; the man said, in response Luke patted Emilia, &quot;Don&#39;t worry your majesty, me and my dragon shall take care of them.&quot; said Luke as he and Emilia slowly left the throne room, &quot;Wait!&quot; the man shouted, &quot;You&#39;re not thinking about going alone there now would you?&quot; the man asked, &quot;If i were you i would come with some other dragon riders, after all they&#39;re part of the same Air Force Unit you&#39;re in.&quot; the man said, Luke chuckled he was about to talk but Emilia spoke first, &quot;They won&#39;t be needed, i do not mean to call the other riders weak but those &#39;Heretics&#39; are incredibily weak, even a single dragon could kill an entire island made out of them, if you don&#39;t belive me, then check out the so called &#39;Red Island&#39;.&quot; said Emilia with a serious tone in his deep voice, the dragoness near the man felt more interested towards him, just who is he?<br />
<br />
Luke only laughed as he heared his dragon speak, &quot;See? Even my dragon thinks so, come on boy, let&#39;s go hunting.&quot; said Luke as they left the throne room, only to quickly fly towards the island.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile the dragoness, was filled with thoughts about the dragon she just heared speaking, the man on the throne noticed this, &quot;Sapphira, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; the man suddenly asked, this caught Sapphira, the dragoness, by suprised, &quot;N-Nothing sir...&quot; she quietly said, attempting to hide the blush under her scales, &quot;...Sapphira i told you not to call me &#39;Sir&#39; anymore...&quot; the man sighed, Sapphira bowed her head in sadness, &quot;I&#39;m sorry Adam, i-it&#39;s just...&quot; she stuttered, as she was about to confess, &quot;Let me guess, Luke&#39;s dragon caught your attention, didn&#39;t he?&quot; Adam suddenly asked, this made Sapphira sigh in defeat, &quot;Y-Yes, i admit, he caught my attention.&quot; she said, feeling emberassed, Adam smilled a little, &quot;I see...&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Luke and Emilia were still flying at high speed, searching for the island, &quot;Hey boy, do you know those guys?&quot; asked Luke, by just hearing this Emilia growled in frustration, &quot;Yes... At first i was an ordinary human female, then i accidently got inside one of their islands and then they turned me into this.&quot; said Emilia, looking at his red scales, &quot;I didn&#39;t let them go so easly, after i transformed i quickly burned the entire island, right now it&#39;s just ashes.&quot; he said with a grin across his scaly lips.<br />
<br />
After the two of them flew for minutes, they reached the island, they didn&#39;t see any cultists, most likely they were deeper in the island, &quot;Stay on alert, they could be watching us right now.&quot; said Luke as he slowly unsheated his sword, Emilia remained silent as he took a deep breath, &quot;None of them are nearby, they are deeper in the island, let&#39;s take them by suprise.&quot; said Emilia, this made Luke laugh a little, &quot;Never knew i had a dragon that is also a strategist, alright, what do you suggest to do?&quot; asked Luke, as he laid near a boulder listening to Emilia, &quot;I will fly in the sky, probably hiding in one of the clouds and watching you, if you run into any group of cultists i&#39;ll just burn them alive.&quot; he said, Luke grinned, &quot;Alright then, let&#39;s hurt them now, shall we?&quot; asked Luke, Emilia grinned as he spreaded his wings and flew in the sky.<br />
<br />
Luke went deeper in the island and saw the cultists doing one of their chants, he saw Emilia still circling around him in the sky like an eagle, he revealed himself, &quot;Excuse me for interupting your sacred chants, but may i get some attention?!&quot; shouted Luke, grabbing the attention of the cultists, who stared at him, the leader slowly revealed himself, &quot;How dare you enter our sacred ground, you shall pay for your innsolence.&quot; the leader of the cult said, Luke grinned, &quot;Did you bring an umbrella?&quot; he asked as he pointed at the sky, before the cultists could react, Emilia shot a stream of fire out of his maw, instantly incinerating most of the cultists, the others were on fire and running around in panic, not even trying to extinguish the flames.<br />
<br />
A minute passed and all of the cultists were just ashes, Luke looked around searching to see if there was any sign of life, Emilia slowly landed near him, &quot;I scouted around the island, no sign of life.&quot; he said, Luke looked around and saw a book laying on the ground he slowly went towards it and picked it up, the book revealed the names and locations of the cultists, &quot;Bingo!&quot; he said with pride, Emilia gave a confused look, &quot;What did you find?&quot; he asked, Luke smilled, &quot;This book is containing the names and locations of the cultists, this will tip the scales of this... War.&quot; he said as he slowly mounted Emilia, &quot;You know, i think i should give you a name.&quot; said Luke, as he slowly thinked of a name, meanwhile Emilia waited patiently for his rider to come up with a name, &quot;Your name will be Karyu.&quot; said Luke, &quot;It means &#39;Firewing&#39; in our language.&quot; he continued, this made Karyu smile, &quot;I like it.&quot; he said, as he slowly took flight towards the kingdom.<br />
<br />
After hours of flying, the two of them reached the castle, Luke and Karyu reached the throne room, Adam was waiting for them sitting on the throne, while also running his hand across Sapphira&#39;s warm white scales, the two of them arrived and bowed down, &quot;Your majesty, our mission was a success, the island is completly exterminated.&quot; said Luke, this made Adam smile, &quot;Perfect, an island down means less room for the cultists.&quot; he said, Karyu chuckled, &quot;There&#39;s more your highness.&quot; said Karyu as he looked at Luke who gave the book containing the names and locations of the cultists, Adam quickly looked at every page, &quot;You two are incredibile.&quot; he said, Luke and Karyu looked at eachother and smilled, &quot;Luke, before you and your dragon go, i want to speak with you.&quot; he said with a serious voice, this confused Luke a little but nodded, &quot;Your dragon may stay here, he may speak with Sapphira if he wishes.&quot; said Adam.<br />
<br />
Adam and Luke slowly went towards the gardens of the castle, meanwhile Sapphira and Karyu looked at eachother.</p>
