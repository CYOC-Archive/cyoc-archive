<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The witch cackled loudly, realizing that Damon&#39;s fate had finally sunk in for him. The tail, the horns, his involuntary mooing--even the fact that the witch wasn&#39;t making any attempt to help a guy who&#39;s body had started mutilating itself in front of her. It all made perfect sense, if he admitted to himself that her magic was real. This strange lady really could turn intruders into animals! He really horns and a fucking tail, for crying out loud! The new bull the witch was getting was going to be Damon, and his friends would be changing into animals too, if they hadn&#39;t escaped. &#39;I can&#39;t stay here,&#39; he thought. He had to get out of here before his transformation got worse!<br />
<br />
Damon turned around and bolted toward the door, and the witch didn&#39;t bother to paralyze him again. Before he&#39;d even taken a few strides, Damon noticed that legs felt funny and his feet seemed oddly numb against the hardware floor, as though he were wearing his shoes again. He heard a stiletto-like clatter beneath him before taking a tumble and coming to a painful stop upside down with feet in the air and his lower back against the edge of the coffee table. The witch nearly took a tumble herself, she was laughing so hard!<br />
<br />
The sight of the broad hooves he was sticking up in the air made Damon moo again in terror. He shifted his weight frantically, trying to seat himself up so he could possibly make some use of his new legs and maybe get out of here. The changing human groaned, finally getting himself stationed onto his aching bottom, leaning against the coffee table from a less embarrassing angle, this time facing the witch. He splayed his feet out in front of him, stammering at the long, two-toed feet he had tripped over. &quot;No, no, no, not my feet,&quot; he repeated nervously with his long tail thrash behind him, smacking against the legs of the coffee table as it did so. He reached for them like a drowning man reaching for a life preserver, as though that would do him any good. He was deeply unsettled by the unseemly long, bony lengths his feet had become. His thighs had bucked up considerably, and his feet were noticeably thick and sturdy, even if they seemed thin relative to their new length. These new legs could probably take a lot of weight for him, he decided--of course, they would need to if he turned into a bull!<br />
<br />
There was something masculine, almost flattering about Damon&#39;s wide, split hooves and the prominent dewclaws hanging underneath them. Damon was starting to feel a power, a forcefulness in his form that wasn&#39;t there before, even in his well-honed weight-lifter human body. But what good would it do him if he were stuck as a dumb, grass-eating animal, a mere piece of property for an old woman to sell as livestock?<br />
<br />
Damon was going to try to get back up again when noticed what had become of his privates. His balls were way bigger, that&#39;s for sure! They were in a huge, low-hanging sack resting on the floor between his hocks. His dick wasn&#39;t hanging down with them, because it was down inside his belly, obscenely filling out a tube-shaped bulge of skin that reached up all the way up to a shaggy tuft of hair near his belly button. &#39;Oh, no, not my handsome dick!&#39; he thought, mooing again. He was always proud of his large maleness, the envy of both of his partners in crime. Now it was even bigger, at the cost of its human form. How could he go on with a pecker made for sticking into a dirty cow&#39;s ass!<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, I&#39;ll do anything, you&#39;ve gotta stop this!&quot; Damon begged the witch, slapping his tail against the ground in distress. &quot;I ... I can&#39;t live as a bull! You&#39;ve gotta help me. I&#39;ll get your stuff back, I&#39;ll clean your house, I&#39;ll do anything!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything?&quot; said the witch, raising an eyebrow. &quot;Will you turn yourself into the police? Will you give whatever money you have to your other victims? Will you help me find and punish your friends for their misdeeds?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes, yes! Please, anything!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if I turn them into animals instead?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, sure, anything! If you wanna be in the livestock business, so be it. I&#39;ll go into it with you! I&#39;ve stolen cattle before and sold them for big money, I can do that for you! Or at least keep you safe from hustlers, anything. We can be on the same side, don&#39;t you see? Just UGH don&#39;t MOOOOOOOOO!&quot; he had to quit talking when his insides started to twist, gurgle, and swell. He wondered what was happening in there. He could feel himself getting taller as his chest and abdominal area were getting larger. The witch cackled again.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s nice to know you were willing to sell out your friends to save your own ass. Speaking of which, I might have to turn one of them into an ass! But don&#39;t worry, I can do honest business and track down your accomplices easily enough without your help. Oh, and if there&#39;s anything you&#39;d like to grab onto with your hands one more time, you probably ought to do that now, before it&#39;s too late.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon realized the broken bottle was right next to him and reached for it, but he never even got his hands around it. Instead, his arms forced themselves straight out in front of him as the joints controlling them snapped and rearranged. Damon pitifully watched his hands and fingernails fuse, groaning and grimmacing as two round, sharp masses of keratin blossomed on the left and right of each hand, with more dewclaws sprouting behind them. Damon realized he would never have use of his human hands again. So much for stealing anything now. He&#39;d never even get the front door open at this point.<br />
<br />
Damon kept on bulking up and felt his face push forward. He itched when his new black fur grew in, but with his four bovine legs, he found it hard to scratch the way a human would. A wobble on the sides of his face announced his big round ears coming into existence, and the continued growth of his broadening snout eventually pushed his eyes toward the sides of his face, giving him a much more expansive view of the room around him. Unfortunately, his depth perception suffered from this change, making the witch look even closer than she was, and therefore scarier. When most of the colors faded away and new smells started overwhelming his wide snout, he realized it was over, and he was experiencing the world as a bull would now. Even his human vision was to be denied him. He tried to plead for mercy again, but his ability to form words was gone. The long, mournful bellow of a bovine was all he could make now, the same from he&#39;d made he&#39;d first discovered what it felt like to have his tail pulled. It was louder and deeper now, with his new lungs and mouth shape, but that was it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmm, aren&#39;t you a fine specimen. I bet I could breed you or sell your semen for lots of money. Or at least someone else could, if I wanted to sell you now. And look at all that muscle! There might still be enough meet on your bones for slaughter after your breeding prowess tapers off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Talking about using him to make cows pregnant disgusted him, but hearing about being cut up and eaten really pushed Damon over the edge. His testerone-fueled rage erupted within him, and he remembered what he had sticking out of the sides of his head now. He might as well see if they were as good for charging as the witch thought they were. He aimed his broad body, swatted his tail, and shifted his back legs ominously, feeling all the power of this 1000+ pound beast idling at his disposal. He may not be able to save himself, but it might not be too late to get the last laugh. He lowered his large head, pointing his horns forward, and charged!<br />
<br />
The wand sparkled, the witch vanished, and Damon found himself immobilized with his horns stuck in the wall. A leash-like restraint appeared on his naked body, which the witch rematerialized holding onto.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, ha, violent to the last,&quot; she laughed. &quot;Now if you&#39;ll follow me gently, I&#39;ll take you out back where there&#39;s lost of grass to feed those four stomachs of yours. If you have another outburst, I can just erase your mind and replace it with a purely bovine one with no human memories. That would be a shame, because it would be more like killing you than transforming you, but you must understand that I am in control now, and as you&#39;ve seen I don&#39;t allow myself to be endangered. Now come along.&quot;</p>
