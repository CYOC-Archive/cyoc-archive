<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Kim Park.&quot; Mr. Turin said as he turned his sight on the korean teenager. He was tall for his age but very skinny. His pale skin hasn&#39;t any sign of muscle definition either. He didn&#39;t seem worried of being chosen by mr. Turin, maybe he was part of the few ones who wanted to become older.<br />
<br />
&quot;Happy?&quot; Darius asked Kim as he also noticed that the guy wasn&#39;t worried at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a little.&quot; Kim replied. &quot;In my family, the adult men aren&#39;t hairy or beefy. I was wondering if I should hit a gym after science camp so, this would helpful for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re cooperating Kim.&quot; Mr. Turin said. &quot;You&#39;re 14, and your father is 45 years old. It&#39;s a big age gap.&quot; Kim just nodded before mr. Turin shot him with his age beam. Suddenly, Kim started to feel funny and warm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man, I can feel it!&quot; Kim smiled as he watched his hands getting bigger. They were as big as his dad’s now.<br />
<br />
&quot;You forgot to take your clothes off.&quot; Darius told Kim as he watched Kim&#39;s sandals becoming extremely tight. His feet was pushing against his size 9 sandals.  We can see his toes extending and his soles getting wider and wider.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! You&#39;re right!&quot; Kim said as he tried to slip his sandals off but it was too late. His feet had already started ripping them until they&#39;re unusable. Kim complained, &quot;Damn! What am I going to tell my parents?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... because that&#39;s the first thing they&#39;re going to notice when they see you...&quot; Rick sarcastically said.<br />
<br />
Kim ignored him because he felt a weird tingle all over his body again. &quot;Uuuuh, I can feel my bones stretching!&quot; Kim said with a excited tone. He already was tall but he started to stretch to a taller height. His 5&#39;10&quot; frame quickly became a 6&#39;6&quot; frame in under 40 seconds. His clothes were now very tight and barely covered his now tall body. &quot;Ugh!&quot; Kim felt uncomfortable in his tight clothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Clothes bursting in three... two...&quot; Darius was counting while we watched Kim&#39;s body expanding with muscle until his pants started to burst open. &quot;One... bye bye pants!!&quot; Kim&#39;s thighs became so thick that his pants split open immediately.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa!&quot; Kim looked down at his strong legs, &quot;They’re so big now!&quot; He also felt his butt expanding as it began to pop out of his tight underwear.<br />
<br />
His torso was the next part of his body to go through change. He looked down and saw his chest beginning to pop out in front of him with thick pecs. &quot;This feels good! It&#39;s better than I thought!&quot; Kim moaned a little while his abs became more defined. His shirt began to rip everywhere as his back grew more broad and biceps became thicker. He couldn’t help but flex his growing muscles, shredding the rest of his clothing with his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you were worried about your clothes...&quot; Frank said as he grinned at he almost naked young man but Kim didn&#39;t say a word cause he was enjoying the feeling of growing bigger. Then, his face stared to feel warm.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re getting the look of a man!&quot; Mr.  Turin smiled as he watched Kim touching his face and feeling it restructuring itself to become more rugged and lose any evidence that he was once a young boy. He felt his strong jaw line and a thin stubble along his face. He took some time to inspect his new body. He wat how big he was now. Kim looked like a fit middle age korean man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!?&quot; Kim said in a deep voice as he rubbed the front of his underwear. &quot;Why didn’t this grow all big too?&quot; He can&#39;t stop rubbing his small dick and balls while he&#39;s filled with intense pleasure. &quot;UH! Ooooh! AH!&quot; He moaned uncontrollably as he stroked his 4&quot; dick.<br />
<br />
Everyone else was watching how his bulge grew larger and thicker. He was massaging his balls and we saw them dropping inside his underwear and expanding to a thicker size. “UUUHH! Man!” Kim moaned as he experienced a very intense sexual pleasure. I can bet his dick was now a throbbing 9&quot;, at least.<br />
<br />
Kim kept holding his fat balls through his very tight underwear. &quot;UH!! UHHHH!!&quot; Kim was red with sexual frustration as he stroked harder and harder. &quot;AHHH!!&quot;, Kim quickly creamed on his last clothing just like Rick did a moment ago. &quot;OOOOH! Shit!&quot; Kim was breathing deeply and drenched in sweat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you say that it was more intense only on prepubescent boys?&quot; Frank asked mr. Turin as he watched disgusted the new man filling his underwear with thick semen.<br />
<br />
&quot;My mistake.&quot; Mr. Turin said. &quot;Arousal is very unpredictable, my boy... I mean, man.&quot; Mr. Turin smiled as he stared at the new man in front of him. &quot;Gentleman, this was another success! Let&#39;s welcome the new mr. Park!!&quot;</p>
