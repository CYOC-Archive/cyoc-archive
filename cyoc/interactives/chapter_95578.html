<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ravi was now sat back in front of the camera, a big grin on his face. His beautiful, handsome face... OK I need to stop falling for these users!<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Ravi, it&#39;s up to you what we change next? I can add or remove muscle, hair, pigment, edit features or increase attributes... anything you like really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Attributes? Like IQ and that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, or physical ones like hormone production, gender, sexual orientation, confidence, anything really?&quot; I was curious what he wanted next, maybe increase his intelligence or increase his attraction level?<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s add muscle next then.&quot; Again with that grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, any preference to build? Are we talking big muscles or tone?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... erm maybe a swimmers build but a bit bigger, like big chest and shoulders and arms, strong legs and that, oh and abs!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Done! Stand back again and I&#39;ll set it up.&quot; He stood back again and I could see him almost hopping with excitement. &quot;Stand still again Ravi please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sorry, just this is amazing! I&#39;m excited!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see, and it&#39;s making me almost as happy to see how happy it&#39;s making you! The program is just about set. It will tingle again this time so please stand by.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another moment and I sent the command and sat back and watched. I saw him close his eyes and exhale through his smile. The first muscles I noticed on his body were his shoulders, they bulged outwards creating mounds on either side, the tiny belly he had disappeared his shirt pushed forward. I could see cobbles of muscle start to form beneath the hem of his shorter shirt now, a light dusting of black hair on them, with a nice treasure trail leading towards his groin. The reason his stomach muscles weren&#39;t showing through the shirt was that the top was being pushed forward by his new pecs. The buttons on his shirt were now beginning to be pulled open. I heard two pop and then a third, then the last two and his shirt flapped open. I gasped out loud and saw his smile widen, he had heard me. There was the sound of threads snapping as his shoulders and back pushed outwards and then two rips appeared at the top of his arms. In a flash he had ripped the fabric from his upper body and it fluttered to the floor. He looked magnificent. His pecs stood out from his chest, casting a shadow over his stomach. Forming deep crevices in his stomach were 10 perfectly formed and symmetrical abs. Each looked like a stone dipped in milk chocolate and then dusted lightly with that same black hair that worked it&#39;s way up between his pecs and over the muscle thinly. Then there was his neck, the muscles on either side forming two clear triangles that stood out clearly, tapering to the balls of muscle at the top of his now muscled arms. The biceps and triceps were clearly defined on his upper arms and his lower arms were snaked with thick veins that stood out enough to be prominent but still looked clean with his smooth skin. Even his hands looked bigger and stronger, and I watched as he flexed them open and closed a few times.<br />
<br />
Whilst I had been staring (drooling) over his upper body his lower body had been catching up. His thighs had pushed his thin trousers to breaking point and again I heard fabric rip down both sides of his legs. He again ripped them away and threw them across the room. His legs were long, hairy and solid. The muscle in them was again defined and the thigh muscles in particular looked rock hard and thick. His calves had expanded as well, now almost peaking out either side of his legs, this time with thicker hair on them. I could just see his feet, they looked at least a size 14 or 15, and the toes themselves looked muscled!<br />
<br />
I sat in awe, breathing heavily. &quot;Thank you... I can hear you breathing and... just thank you...&quot; I heard his now even deeper voice say, his eyes were still closed. He was still stood away from the camera and I swear I could see the slight glint of wetness in the corners.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I love my job I can say that.&quot; I said into the mic. Eventually he opened his eyes and looked down. He was crying a little, raising his hands to his face to dry it. I watched as he tentatively pressed into his pec muscle with one finger, testing the firmness, and then he run it down the centre of his abs, it bounced a little as he did. He then stopped at his now very tight underwear and he looked for a moment unhappy, just a spilt second. I read his mind exactly then. &#39;Shame about... wait I could ask...&quot; He looked back at the camera<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I can.&quot; Was all I said and he nodded smiling, a tear running down his face.</p>
