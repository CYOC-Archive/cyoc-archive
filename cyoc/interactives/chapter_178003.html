<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;No, please! Let me go! I beg you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Annetta stopped seeing how Adelina and Andrea were having fun with each other to turn to see who had yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mattia, you are an idiot. Clearly the Coachwoman told us to pick up the girls who already think and act like true donkeys. Or those whose body has completely changed. She will be furious with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Annetta knew perfectly well the man who spoke and also his partner. They were Filippo and Mattia, the two guys who had given her and her friends the tickets to Pleasure Island. They argued in the middle of the paddock while they were holding some donkey girls by the ropes tied around their necks. There, Annetta understood that these pair of wretches were part of the trap and now, as the Coachwoman, they were capturing the girls. <br />
<br />
&quot;But Filippo....&quot;, responded Mattia while he was holding with one hand two ropes, one tied to the neck of a young donkey and the other tied to the neck of a complete normal girl. &quot;I couldn&#39;t leave this girl alone to warn others, she saw me roping this donkey,&quot; continued Mattia <br />
pointing to the crying girl next to him. &quot;And when I realized her presence I had to do the same with her.&quot; <br />
<br />
That crying girl was sitting on the grass and hugging her knees. She had her face hidden by her arms and legs so Annetta couldn&#39;t see who she was. However, even though her muzzle was still small and short, Annetta had already developed an excellent sense of smell and from where she was Annetta could smell the scent of both the donkey and the girl. Annetta found those scents very familiar and immediately identified who they belonged to. The girl was her friend Irene and the donkey ... was Mariella.<br />
<br />
Irene was a pretty girl with fair skin, dark pink lips, blue eyes and dark brown hair which she used to wear long and freely down her back, she was wearing a red vintage lace dress with a tiered ruffle skirt and long sleeves. Mariella, as a human, had been a freckled girl with green eyes, two pigtails and very pretty too. But now, Mariella had long ears, hooves, a pair of buck teeth, a snout, a long tail and a light-brown fur covering her body... even her hair, eyes and memories had changed, she didn&#39;t remember being a human girl.<br />
<br />
Unlike Irene, Mariella was neither sad nor upset. She had even been lying down on the grass folding all four legs beneath her body and with both ears flat to the side. Mariella made herself comfortable on the ground, enjoying the feeling of cool grass against her fur. However, Mariella did not feel quite well, that light-blue flared dress she was wearing made her feel uncomfortable and it wouldn&#39;t let her enjoy the whole feeling of the grass. Then, she started using her huge front teeth to rip off the dress. Mariella wondered why those clothes were covering her if her fur was more than enough for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;BOOHOOHOOOOO! BOOHOOHOOOOOOOOOOO!,&quot; cried Irene inconsolably at the knowledge of her near future.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop crying, brat. Look at your friends, they were also panicky like you when they noticed their first changes, now they are happy in their new form,&quot; Filippo turned his gaze on the three jennies he was holding. &quot;Your human fear will disappear and you will begin to enjoy your new life: No school, no homework, no parents, no rules, no worries, playing with your friends outdoors, free food ... behaving like a real ass !!! It was what you wanted, wasn&#39;t it? &quot;, said Filippo mockingly.  <br />
 <br />
Like Mattia, Filippo held with ropes three little dressed donkeys. Annetta recognized that trio of jennies by their dresses (and also by their familiar scents). <br />
<br />
The smallest of them was a disheveled dark-brown donkey with the white muzzle and without a front tooth, who wore a white dress ripped in the back by her tail was the flattering and talkative Noemi. Noemi was standing calmly on all fours, wagging her long ears and swishing her tail to swat away a fly. Besides her clothes, the only trace that Noemi still had of her lost humanity were her big amber eyes. The former girl had a blank look on her face, in fact Noemi was very quiet now compared to what she used to be. It seemed as if nothing in this world mattered to her anymore except chasing away that annoying fly with her tail.<br />
<br />
Next to Noemi was a dark gray-dun donkey that had a lack of the normal white eyerings, muzzle and belly that most donkeys have. Annetta didn&#39;t need to see her long dark blue dress or smell her scent to recognize who she was. That donkey still had her ginger human hair ... with the Francesca&#39;s typical bohemian side braid ..... it was Francesca !!!<br />
<br />
Francesca was a cute, polite and kind little girl. She was the most diligent in school and always got good grades, but despite that she couldn&#39;t resist the temptation to come and have fun on Pleasure Island. All the years of being a good girl were thrown away for a few months of pleasure, revelry and fun .... all the time that Francesca had spent reading books and studying was a waste of time, now she would spend her life as a beast of burden. Francesca had her snout buried in the grass as she chewed on it, her tail swayed back and forth lifting her long skirt and exposing her equine legs and butt to the public.<br />
<br />
The third little donkey that Filippo held was wearing Carina&#39;s knee-length lace dress with sleeves but holed by the growth of her tail. That dark sorrel donkey with white muzzle, belly and legs was Carina. And like Francesca&#39;s hair, Carina still had her red waterfall braid with loose curls but her roots had darkened, before long her hair would be completely black.<br />
<br />
As a human child, Carina was always very outgoing, lively, and playful, and as a donkey she still was. Carina was the most restless of the three former girls, she would jump from one side to the other and emit the occasional bray because she wanted to play with the other donkey foals in the paddock. That attitude angered Filippo who several times had to give a strong pull to the rope so that Carina would not get away. But that didn&#39;t matter to Carina, she kept braying, swiveling her long ears and swinging her tail like a pendulum.<br />
<br />
If it weren&#39;t for their clothes, anyone would think they were ordinary donkeys. Her schoolmates were already animals and acted like such.<br />
<br />
“HEE HAW! HEE HAW! HAW! HAW! HEEE-HAAAW!,” Carina brayed happily at the other donkeys.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up, you jackass!&quot; roared Fillipo angrily to Carina.<br />
<br />
&quot;She is actually a female, so the correct term would be jenny,&quot; Mattia tried to correct him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up you too, ass! Do you know what the Coachwoman will do to us if she sees a normal girl here?&quot;, Filippo pointed at Irene. &quot;Your carelessness will get us in trouble. We are supposed to enter rooms when we hear girls braying, wailing or screaming in fear&quot;, continued Filippo.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did, let me explain. I was in the corridor when I heard a mixture of braying and whining in her room. I waited outside until her crying completely turned to braying. When that happened, I opened the door and saw a little light-brown donkey wearing a blue flared dress braying wildly and kicking her hind legs in the air. She was completely hysterical and out of control, she ran around the room destroyed it. I had to pounce on her to stop her,  we both fell to the floor. You would have seen, Filippo, with my dexterity I held and tied the snout and neck of the bucking animal,&quot; said Mattia, wanting to look like an expert in the art of roping.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...&quot;, Filippo said annoyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well the girl ... errrr ... I mean the donkey began to calm down. I realized that her brain was changing to that of a donkey, as the Lady told us that it happened, and then I got off her. Indeed, she got up calmly, approached me and even began to lick my hand. We were already leaving the room when I heard a crackle of broken glass ... there was another girl in the room!!! She had been hiding behind the bedside table and she had stepped on a piece of glass. And the worst thing was that she did not present any change. The girl tried to run away but I managed to catch her. I put my handkerchief in her mouth, I tied her hands behind her back, I put her lying on her friend&#39;s back and finally I tied them both with the rope so the girl couldn&#39;t escape. You see, I&#39;m very smart&quot;, Mattia finished his explanation with a sly smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, of course,&quot; Filippo said sarcastically. &quot;And I see you untied her so she could escape, didn&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not that stupid, Filippo, I have her well tied around her neck. Besides, I remember that the Lady said that only we can go in and out of the paddock ... but they can&#39;t. Besides, she must be free to start changing&quot;, Mattia referred to Irene maliciously.</p>
