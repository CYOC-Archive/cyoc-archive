<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Frances&#39;s day went pretty much like any other day did in that she dealt with her appointments as they came. That wasn&#39;t too big of an issue as that was pretty normal thing for her. However, as Frances came out the door to her clinic she knew that much of the day had not been normal.  Some agent of Dieter Wilhelm had apparently gone after Jennifer Harper&#39;s fiance, Harold Jenkins, and got Harry&#39;s brother instead.  Harry and Jenny had apparently spent the entire day at the hospital with the wounded brother, which made sense. You couldn&#39;t expect someone to not want to be there for a relative in such a situation. However, that had left one open point in Frances&#39; schedule in Jenny&#39;s appointment.  <br />
<br />
With the need to keep track on Jenny&#39;s mental stability and health, marking her recovery from her lengthy entrance into were society, Frances knew she would need at least some face to face meeting with Jenny to at least make sure she was okay and in good health. As she made her way to her car, she pulled out her cellphone and dialed a number, hoping to at least get some good news for Jenny. The answer she got was an all too familiar voice to Frances.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve had quite a few distractions today, dear, so I can&#39;t stay on the line long,&quot; came Samantha Twist&#39;s voice over the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;but Dieter Wilhelm&#39;s agent cost Jenny her appointment today. I&#39;m on my way to the hospital to see if she&#39;s still there and see if she&#39;s okay. I was hoping you&#39;d gotten some report on what had happened with regard to the perpetrator.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Samantha answered slowly, &quot;well, the police didn&#39;t report all that much to city hall, but I can say for certain that the perpetrator was not only caught but is cooperating with the police. So I would assume that is good news you can tell Jenny and Harry that the man who committed the crime will not see freedom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure the Jenkins family will like that, thank you,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;What are you up to, by the way?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve gotten a call of a fight out on the northeastern part of town  and a possible Statute 1A violation,&quot; Samantha said with a sigh, &quot;Police are on the scene and the chief is with me at the moment... so... yeah, that&#39;ll be fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances cringed at the words &quot;Statute 1A,&quot; as Moon Lake had had a bit much of that for comfort at the moment, but she knew she couldn&#39;t control things and ultimately took a deep breath and let it go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, just keep your head,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;and good luck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I need peace and quiet, not luck,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;Love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Love you, too,&quot; Frances answered and then hung up.<br />
<br />
By now she had made it to her car and had climbed in. However, not wanting to risk being in a car accident, it was only until now that she actually pulled out her keys and turned her vehicle on. Her thoughts remained fairly clear as she drove from her clinic toward the main hospital. It didn&#39;t take long and she could soon see the building coming into view. As she pulled into a parking space, she hoped the Jenkins family and thus Jenny, were still there so that she could give them the good news that the shooter was caught and would face justice. From there she could check to make sure Jenny was okay.<br />
<br />
The hospital was fairly quiet by the time that Frances arrived at the hospital. She made her way in and approached the front desk. The clerk at the front desk did recognize her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Doctor Twist,&quot; the clerk spoke, &quot;did you get a call from the staff for a patient?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;this is more of a personal visit. Is the Jenkins family still here?&quot;<br />
<br />
She waited while the clerk checked something, talking into earphone intercom that went through the hospital. After a few moments the clerk looked up. &quot;Yes, Doctor Twist here. They&#39;re in the main waiting room in the ICU. Is something wrong, Doctor Twist?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;Just some personal business. I promise I won&#39;t be long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Doctor Twist,&quot; the clerk answered.<br />
<br />
From there, Frances continued along until she made her way to the hospital&#39;s ICU area. The area in Moon Lake wasn&#39;t large area when compared to bigger hospitals, but it was big enough kept safe enough it could service Moon Lake&#39;s were population when needed. That, however, wasn&#39;t Frances&#39; issue at the moment as she had her own mission to achieve. The ICU&#39;s waiting area was one of the first rooms in the area that Frances came to as she arrived and she found what she expected, Jenny and Harry, seated together. Jenny looked rather strong and comforting as she rubbed Harry&#39;s shoulder with one hand hand and of Harry&#39;s hands with her other hand. Her eyes were focused on Harry for a few moments and it took her a while to actually notice that Frances had arrived and was a bit startled when she did notice Frances there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doctor Twist!&quot; Jenny said with surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Frances,&quot; Frances corrected, &quot;I&#39;m not on any clock right now and just wanted to see if you were okay after all of this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m about as well as I can be, all things considered,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;with lunatics going after my mate&#39;s family because of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This wasn&#39;t your fault,&quot; Frances spoke, &quot;this may feel bad... in that this agent was targeting someone to hurt you directly, but that doesn&#39;t make it your fault.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; came the voice of an older male, Henry Jenkins, that was there, &quot;It&#39;s that Wilhelm guy who&#39;s to blame! Dirty...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, dear,&quot; said the woman beside the man, Lisa Jenkins, &quot;this wasn&#39;t your fault.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Jenny said somewhat weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the meantime, we can only hope that the guy who shot Huck pays for what he did,&quot; Harry commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;There I have good news,&quot; Frances spoke, &quot;the police DID catch him and he is cooperating, it&#39;ll be safe to assume that he&#39;ll be going to jail for quite awhile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Henry Jenkins spoke for everyone, &quot;I don&#39;t like it when anyone roughs up my boys. I didn&#39;t like it when we first moved to Moon Lake and I won&#39;t like it now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances nodded and then asked, &quot;How is he, by the way?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He made it through surgery,&quot; Harry said to Frances, &quot;but for the moment he&#39;s been talking with one of his coworkers. Her name is Betty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A girlfriend, I suppose?&quot; Frances asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d think they are now,&quot; Harry commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, hopefully things turn out well for them,&quot; Frances replied,&quot;and don&#39;t worry. Everything that can be legally done IS being done to make sure that Wilhelm cannot give you any trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances watched Jenny give a small smile, &quot;Thanks.&quot;</p>
