<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Mmmm. Yessssss.&quot; The cobra hissed on Todd&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Let out archosaurian friend have some pleasssssure too. Make her a crocodile wman, Todd. Give her a body to match her wonderful mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that what you&#39;re doing?&quot; Gretta blinked, padding over in curiosity as Todd kneeled down with his snake to show Gretta the remote. The big crocodile read the screen carefully and looked up at Todd. &quot;My God, buddy...&quot; She laughed in surprise. &quot;I.. I couldn&#39;t have guessed you liked us this way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it&#39;s... it&#39;s the idea, right?&quot; Todd stroked the snake gently and hit the button again, feeling her jump and hiss as she progressed, arms and legs really growing now, hands nearly done, legs growing longer and more supportive, she audibly stretched as she began to develop and grow in size.<br />
<br />
&quot;The idea?&quot; Gretta stared, watching the transformation subside and marvelling as a oh so subtly bigger cobra panted on Todd&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I gave you guys intelligence and personalities. I... I want to help you evolve and change into beautiful reptile people. You deserve to have strong sizeable bodies to match your minds.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that...&quot; The crocodile gulped and wagged her tail slightly. &quot;That does actually sound kind of hot.&quot; She looked at her front feet and her stubby fingers and back at Todd as he hit the button again. The cobra gulped and panted, her now more proportionate hands fully fingered up and pointed to claws where her scales ended. In excitement, Todd felt her growing larger and heavier on his shoulder. Maybe she had gained an inch in overall expansion. She wasn&#39;t growing particularly fast or dramatically, but half humanity was getting closer. He and Gretta watched as her tail began to slim down and her hips began to fall into their proper position.<br />
<br />
&quot;P-Put me down.&quot; The cobra panted.<br />
<br />
Todd carefully released the snake onto the ground and she giggled as she *stood* on all fours, shakily using her still underdeveloped arms and legs to push herself off the ground. With her emerging torso stiff and muscled, she raised her neck and tried to walk strangely. &quot;W-What an... an odd sssssenssssation...&quot; She fell to her belly again and slithered a little, finding it awkward to try and move as she had her entire life. She tried to coil and found the rigidity of her emerging form was not made for it anymore. She was in an especially awkward state.<br />
<br />
Todd hit the button.<br />
<br />
The snake squeaked and pulsated as a little growth soaked in and her limps grew faster still, becoming long and useful as the muscle and size grew in. She started panting again, and sat up now, placing her legs in front of her and finding it felt more natural with her hips. Her torso was still long and inhuman, more snake than humanoid, but despite that she was starting to really look like a hybrid animal. She stared in delight and used her new hands to touch her flesh, marvelling as they gave her sensation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have handsssss.&quot; She grinned in delight. &quot;I can...&quot; With a blush, she turned away from the other two staring at her and there was a wet slurp as her new fingers found their mark. She moaned out loud and nearly doubled over, trembling.<br />
<br />
Gretta watched this in curiosity and looked at Todd. &quot;Well?&quot; She said expectantly. &quot;You gonna start me too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot; Todd said excitedly, throwing his arms around the crocodile and embracing her. &quot;That would be so cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you plan to put all of us on two legs, right? All us scaly people?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Todd nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Gretta grinned. &quot;So... do what you&#39;re doing to her. Except make it to it just keeps going for me. Then you two can have your fun and I can change on my own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds fun.&quot; Todd grinned. &quot;I&#39;m gonna make it feel fucking great for you, croc girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; Gretta whispered in a seductive tone.<br />
<br />
They turned back to the cobra as she threw her head back on her still long neck and started to really go to town as she masturbated with her new fingers. Todd laughed as she frantically fingered her snakey slit and started to get to the edge. He hit the button.<br />
<br />
The cobra hissed sharply and let out a sudden pleasured moan of ecstasy as she hit orgasm. Her fingers grew thicker inside of her, her hands enlarged and increased in dexterity, her arms lengthened further. It pushed her completely over the edge and her long body spasmed and her toes curled. She came. The cobra gasped and moaned as she grew in size and humanity. Her body shape started to grow leaner. Her neck slimmed, her head grew, her tail began to slim further and shrink shorter. Her legs were well defined and easily able to bear her weight now. Her tiny thighs were round and shapely.<br />
<br />
As she finished spasming and fell forward panting on her hands and knees, Todd quickly scanned Gretta and began her own changes. The crocodile licked her lips and climbed up onto the couch excitedly. Todd activated her transformation and let it burn slowly but surely. A nice gradual rate.<br />
<br />
Gretta felt a rush a warm arousal and swayed her head from side to side gently. &quot;Ohhhh, Todd!&quot; She rumbled, letting out a soft roar. &quot;Oh, buddy!&quot; She gasped sharply and began to build into her changes. She trembled slightly and began to pulsate. Muscle popping. Body starting to swell. Her arms and legs were already a little longer. Her front and rear feet a little bigger.<br />
<br />
Todd turned his excited attention back to the cobra and found her lying on her back panting in heat. &quot;M-More...&quot; She gasped. &quot;Oh, pleasssse. I&#39;m sssstill ssssso ssssssmall.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But getting bigger every time.&quot; Todd leaned over top of her, kissing the snake again and delighting as her tiny hand reached up and touched his cheek. He turned the remote back to the snake and pressed the button. She moaned into his mouth. She grew. Her proportions started to change drastically. Her overly long torso started to compact and develop further, increasing her human shape. Her legs stretched and lengthened, her stance changed as her tail snapped behind two growing ass cheeks, and her arms started to show muscule definition through their lean lanky shapes. She grew bigger under Todd.<br />
<br />
As her latest spurt finished, the human stood up and picked up his snake, turning to see Gretta was in absolute rapture, the big crocodile now starting to get even bigger overall as she crackled and popped, arching her back as she entered the same body reshaping the cobra was already well into. Her limbs were longer now, her front feet started to look more like hands and her back feet growing heels. She eyed Todd and panted, long jaws open and tongue dangling to the side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit, Gretta.&quot; Todd watched in amazement, realizing the big crocodile was putting on muscle and size. &quot;Y-You&#39;re... you&#39;re gonna be a big damn girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;U-Uh-huh!&quot; Gretta managed, shaking on the couch, still on all floors, as she pressed further and further into humanization.<br />
<br />
Todd turned his attention back to the horny cobra he cradled in his arms. He set her down on her feet and she stood upright now, as tall as his thigh. She looked up at him in wonder. &quot;I-I&#39;m ssssssoooo big, creator.&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd giggled and deftly hit the button. She grabbed his knee in her arms and held on tight, gasping, as she continued to humanize in shape, her hips widening, her torso reaching its proper form, her tail pulling in behind her as not to drag on the floor while her proportions righted and her limbs began to reach their proper size and shape. She was definitively humanoid now. Even as her head raised above his thigh and she grew in overall size and scale.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God!&quot; Todd bent down and they stared at each other excitedly. &quot;What a fucking adorable snake girl!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?!&quot; The cobra beamed excitedly.<br />
<br />
Their attention suddenly shifted back to the growing enormous crocodile grunting and grimacing as she grew humanoid on the couch. She was easily double her original length now, knocking over a plant with her huge swaying tail as she kneeled on her thick legs and gripped the couch arm in her strong powerful hands. Like the cobra, her torso was growing feminine, her waist cinching, her hips swelling, her stance growing upright.<br />
<br />
&quot;T-Todd!&quot; She whimpered, growling to herself, almost crying. &quot;Todd, I&#39;m so huge! I&#39;m getting so big! So... so...&quot; She managed to open her eyes long enough to look at herself and Todd saw a trickle of sexual juices run from her vaginal slit. &quot;Please...&quot; She fell to the couch and raised to sit with her legs splayed open and her huge burly arms held at her sides. &quot;Please, buddy... give... give me your dick. I want it to be you, Todd! Please!&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd stared at the snake and she nodded excitedly. &quot;Well... don&#39;t leave the poor girl unssssatisssfied, reptile lover. I&#39;m fine watching the ssssshow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit.&quot; Todd turned back to the growing crocodile and watching her grow sexier and bigger by the second. &quot;This... this is so hot.&quot;</p>
