<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nick woke up feeling significantly more refreshed than he thought he would have. After the previous night of working out so hard he figured he&#39;d at least be a little bit tired but every muscle in his body barely even felt sore. It was more like he had a light workout for recovery rather than the intense one he&#39;d just put himself through. He hopped out of bed, grabbed his clothes for a shower and then finished getting ready. But as he lowered the shirt over his torso he couldn&#39;t help but notice how tight it felt on his body.<br />
<br />
The medium sized shirt was always just a little big on him. Loose enough to move around in but a small would have been way too tight. He tried to ignore it as he pulled up his shorts but the fabric just kept clinging to his sides and shoulders. Each time he moved he felt it riding up and down his body. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; he questioned as he buttoned his shorts. They were feeling wrong in a similar way. Even though around his waist it was still perfectly fine, behind him there were two globes sticking out. Never had he been able to turn around and actually see his butt sticking a bit further.<br />
<br />
In the other room he could here his phone vibrating. It distracted him enough not to give it anymore thought. Nick was supposed to be meeting Matt today. &quot;Hey bud. Just wanted to let you know I&#39;m on the way,&quot; Matt said as Nick picked up the phone. Everyone had always considered them to be a bit odd of friends as Matt was far more a jock to Nick&#39;s more geeky side. However to most people, they didn&#39;t know about the geeky side that Matt liked to keep hidden. He may not have known every anime, movie or video game that Nick did, but he was able to keep up with a lot of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Nick replied. He waited a second on the phone. &quot;Hey. Can you bring some of you&#39;re old gym clothes over too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You working out?&quot; Matt asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ehhh... Yeah... Kind of... I think you should just see when you get here.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing man,&quot; Matt replied.<br />
<br />
It was only about 5 minutes until Matt was there knocking on the front door. His larger jocky frame always seemed to fill it compared to most people that Nick knew. At 6&#39;2&quot; and a good 230 pounds he had always stood significantly bigger than Nick. But the second Nick opened the door Matt couldn&#39;t help but reply, &quot;woah dude! You have been working out. Shit! When did you start this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yesterday,&quot; Nick replied. &quot;I ordered some new weights and got them yesterday...&quot; He showed his friend inside and the living room that had been remodeled to be more of a gym.<br />
<br />
Matt&#39;s mouth was nearly on the floor as he looked through the fully stocked gym. &quot;Damn! What&#39;d you spend on all this shit!&quot; he was already playing with a few of the pieces of equipment as he looked around.<br />
<br />
&quot;About $30?&quot; Nick shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve got to be shitting me! There&#39;s no way!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean... Well... I called yesterday and asked about some kind of mix up and they said I got what I ordered. So...&quot; Nick shrugged his shoulders again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit! You&#39;ve got to get me this website,&quot; Matt smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... But did you bring the extra clothes?&quot; Nick said. Matt tossed him the bag and Nick went go get changed. It was a bit odd wearing larges but they fit him more loosely. Nick was never one to wear anything too tight. He didn&#39;t like the feeling of the clothes pulling at his frame. However, even with the more flexible shorts, Nick could still see his ass pushing far out behind him.<br />
<br />
As he left the bathroom, Matt was already playing around with some of the gym equipment. &quot;Dude... You could run you&#39;re own gym with all this shit. You could even be a bodybuilder if you wanted!&quot; he added a bit of a laugh at the end looking down at Nick&#39;s still rather thin frame.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess,&quot; Nick shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Matt&#39;s eyes seemed to glow brightly with an idea. &quot;I know we&#39;re just hanging out or whatever but do you wanna just work out here for a bit and then go hang out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Nick shrugged again. He seemed to be doing that a lot today as he wasn&#39;t sure what he really wanted. Normally he&#39;d be kind of pissed that Matt wanted to work out but right now it sounded like a pretty fun idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweet! Lead the way,&quot; Matt said as he followed behind Nick. Instantly Nick went over to the squat rack and loaded up the bar. It looked like it was a bit more than Nick should have had but Matt didn&#39;t feel it necessary to say anything. Instead he watched his friend pump out 12 perfect squats. He then moved out of the way giving Matt plenty of room. Again it was a bit odd to Matt as it looked more like Nick was showing off than just working out. But Matt felt like he was up for the challenge. He took up the bar and did the same. <br />
<br />
There was no way he was going to let his geeky little friend be better than him. Matt went through each and every exercise just like Nick. However he was surprised just how much stamina the smaller guy had. Never in his life had he seen him with so much drive to push himself to the limit. His eyes were focused. Each grunt was deep and well timed. Sweat dripped down both their bodies but only seemed to affect Matt. And towards the end of the work out Matt was finding it harder and harder to keep pace while Nick didn&#39;t seem like he was ready to stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright man,&quot; Matt finally said. &quot;I think we&#39;re good...&quot; His breathing was haggard and uneven. It was hard to hold himself up. &quot;Didn&#39;t realize you had it in you little man.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Right...&quot; Nick shook his head like he was coming out of some kind of trance. &quot;Neither did I,&quot; he laughed a bit uncomfortably as he realized that he&#39;d accidentally just pushed his friend to the limit and was still barely feeling much of anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll say... What do you weigh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh? 150&#39;s?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww fuck man... That&#39;s fucking crazy. You ain&#39;t on something are ya?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; Nick replied. But he was a bit worried as just the day before he was in the low 130&#39;s. Yet somehow his mind changed the weight to something he knew he shouldn&#39;t have been yet. He turned back to the mirror and gave himself a light flex. His eyes went a little wide as he looked at the bulge in his muscle. It was bigger.</p>
