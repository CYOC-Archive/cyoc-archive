<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The last few days had been hectic for Katie and her friends. From rockers to monsters was hard enough. However, the government needed to test them for infectious diseases. The memory test vs the recorded history of them revealed just how far the mental changes went. For Katie, she learned she was still a rocker but had liked boys rather than girls. Also, she wasn&#39;t as into sex as she was now. Unfortunately, she had gotten off easier than her friends. Hal and Brady&#39;s relationship was toast. Hal now liked girls and the only things he remembered correctly were his love of music and being friends with them. Brady was heartbroken about this. <br />
<br />
To make matters worse his amazing singing voice which he remembered was now deep moos. Even if he tried to hum it would become a moo. However Luke had gotten it the worst. Apart from his ability to clean his mind was pretty much bestial. He refused to wear clothes and kept laying eggs everywhere. Any attempts to reach the man who used to be there were met with a blank stare and a ba-cawk before he began cleaning again. It was finally determined that they weren&#39;t infectious, unfortunately, their new forms meant the government had to hide them. They said if more people like whoever sent the texts found out about its existence then the whole world could be thrown into a panic. As such they were sent to an island far away from anyone but the agents who would supply them with things. So here Katie was stuck on an island she didn&#39;t know the name of and had no idea of where in the world she was. She stared at her new ceiling in despair. She didn&#39;t know whether remembering her old life would even matter now.  <br />
<br />
Her alarm beeped indicating she spent hours awake again. Getting out of bed she walked out of her room. This revealed a stable-like building. She was put here after reliving her bowels during testing. She hadn&#39;t done that before her change. As she walked down the large hallway she passed several vacant rooms. She paused as she spotted one of her two barn mates. The name she had was Betsy. She was the jock of an Ohio basketball team before this. However, right before his final game, he read the infamous text. Betsy then ran onto the court and masturbated while her breasts sprayed milk everywhere. The government captured her and insisted it had been a stunt by the teen. Since then Betsy had been obsessed with milking herself and trying to seduce anyone with a cock. Her cow&#39;s body was eight feet tall with massive breasts and thick hair on her chest, armpits, and bush. The only clothing she had was a cowbell around her neck, lipstick, nipple piercings, and a headband. To top it off she gave off this musk that made any cock harden in her presence. It took a lot of resistance on Katie&#39;s part to pull away. Thankfully Betsy was too into her milking to notice otherwise she would have seduced Katie like she did ever since the poor girl arrived here. Thankfully Katie&#39;s mood was brightened when she smelled pancakes.  <br />
<br />
Once she entered the kitchen she smelled Luke&#39;s special recipe. &quot;Hey Luke,&quot; she said making the chicken boy turn his head and give a ba-cawk back to her. She was pleasantly surprised by his response. She hoped that this meant some of Luke&#39;s personality was still there. As she finished her pancakes she spoke to Luke like she used to. &quot;today I&#39;m gonna meet up with Hal and Brady. We&#39;re going to see what jobs there are in town for us&quot; Katie said. However, her cock exited its sheath again as she heard a deep husky voice. &quot;afraid you boys are going to be a little late&quot; Katie&#39;s mind began to fog up as Luke was already rushing over and pushing his cock into her pussy as best he could. Katie soon lost the battle with her instincts and approached Betsy from the rear. She soon thrust her meat rocket deep within the cow anthro earning a loud moo. She then thrusts her cock in and out repeatedly. Her phone in her purse buzzed as she missed her meet-up. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Hal woke up from his amazing dream. Looking around his den he was glad to see his pack was all there. The den was once a simple cave in the woods before Max and Susan spruced it. Hal had gotten their stories when he arrived. They told him how they were at a carnival that had a freak show, from what the government said they had made fun of its freak show, and the bearded lady used the text on them. During the day they seem like normal humans but at night, not only do they become werewolves but they also swap genders. Max would become a brown werewolf with a decent-sized breast size. While she didn&#39;t change too much in height Susan did. he would become a seven-foot black-furred hunk. That was a few months back. It was clear they had moved on from their own lives by the bump on Max&#39;s belly.  <br />
<br />
Susan meanwhile had opened their cave to any gender-changed wolf of any variety. That&#39;s how Valerie got to come here. She had only been here a month before and was tasked with showing Hal around the den and woods. She like Hal had always remembered being an anthro wolf. From her interview, she learned she was a bouncer at a nightclub. She refused to let the wrong person inside. The reports the government had was her running onto the stage and sliding around the strip pole. Over the last few days, she and Hal became friends, although Hal felt there might be something more. Regardless he needed to catch up with his band mate Brady. It made him feel terrible that their relationship was forever altered but he just wasn&#39;t into guys like that. After putting on a pair of shorts and a grey muscle shirt he headed out. Unbeknownst to him Valerie had looked at him with longing before pretending to read a book. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Brady sighed as he waited on the park bench. Looking around he hadn&#39;t spotted his friends yet. He wasn&#39;t too surprised that Luke was late. His mind wasn&#39;t all there sadly. Katie was probably stuck with Betsy. Then Hal... well, Hal was once his girlfriend but it was clear that ship had sunk. When they had all been interviewed Hal was the only one able to live comfortably in the city. They had made him roommates with a man named Benny the Bear. The man used to be a park ranger before the text. It was unclear why as the culprit had never been caught. His transformation was everything from his tail up was now that of an anthro bear. He also had a love for taking food and was extremely camera-shy. From what Benny had told him his old self loved the camera and was a health nut. Apart from those flaws, he wasn&#39;t that bad of a roommate. Besides it was only temporary until he found a job and could move out. <br />
<br />
Brady then saw Hal walking past the fountain towards him. &quot;hey Brady&quot; he said. &quot;hey Haley- I mean Hal. You seen Luke or Katie?&quot; Brady asked. &quot;nope, texted them so they&#39;d remember. Well, Luke still doesn&#39;t use his phone so it&#39;s more like I&#39;m texting Katie&quot; the wolf stated. A few seconds passed before Brady sent a text to Katie. Hal joined in too and they did so for about five minutes before it became clear Katie wouldn&#39;t come. &quot;so should we go job hunting?&quot; Brady said. He briefly held up his arm so Hal could lock arms before dropping it. It wasn&#39;t easy to move on. It wasn&#39;t easy for Hal seeing the way Brady looked at him. Regardless they began to search the small city. It was evacuated for a tsunami that never came. The government then erased its existence from history. As they walked down the street they saw a man constantly whistling with an excited look and a snake&#39;s tail moving from his rear in tandem.  <br />
<br />
Then there was a man with the lower half of an ant. Then they saw a woman with a muscular male body head into a gym. Then a teenage anthro crab skated past with two other anthros. Those being a bull anthro and a spider girl. Eventually, they found a store called Job Finder. They looked at each other and shrugged. Inside they found an orange lady with a green buzz cut filing her nails. &quot;hello and welcome to Job Finder&quot; her voice seemed to lack any emotion despite her genuine smile. &quot;um, we&#39;re here because well...&quot; Brady searched the back of his cow head. &quot;what my friend here is trying to say is we&#39;re new and need jobs&quot; Hal explained.  <br />
<br />
The secretary nodded and handed them forms. &quot;fill out these questionnaires and Mr. Silva will be right with you&quot;. Brady and Hal sat down and began writing. Most of the questions weren&#39;t too difficult. Brady ignorantly wrote down his lack of singing when it asked if anything was taken from you. However, one interesting thing was the &#39;Did your reproductive organs change or have you gained new ones?&#39; question. Brady said no but was unsure why that was even listed. However, he got his answer when he entered Mr. Silva&#39;s office.  <br />
<br />
On the other side of the table was a ram with large horns. &quot;well Mr. Smith it seems that you&#39;re very good at manual labor and your driving skills are good. I&#39;d recommend construction until you find a better job you prefer better&quot; The two shook hands after they talked some more. However when Brady asked about the question Mr. Silva sighed. &quot;because this wasn&#39;t originally my curse&quot; Mr. Silva explained. He used to be a woman that barged into things she had no business being in. One of her coworkers was so upset that they sent the message to her. She then developed a sheep cock in the middle of a meeting and cum all across the board. He then told how after she was brought to the island she began noticing her body growing wool and becoming more masculine. &quot;the local doctors believe it has to do with the reproductive organs being altered. As such their changed testosterone or estrogen spread the changes over a while. It usually takes a while unless you use your new genitals excessively&quot; After Brady had left and Hal went in the cow hybrid sent a text to Katie. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Katie had finally managed to get away from Betsy. Why did they have to share a house/barn with someone like her? She needed to find some work before going back. She then felt her phone buzz and pulled it out. The text was from Brady and said &#39;Don&#39;t use your new &#39;thing&#39; too much or you&#39;ll become more horse&#39;. Katie paled as she read it. Pulling her shirt up she saw her body had changed more. It was subtle but her fur was now a few center meters above her waist. She needed to get out of that barn sooner than later.</p>
