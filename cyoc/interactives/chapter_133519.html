<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thankfully for Kellie the girls settled in for the evening watching several horror movies before finally passing into a blissful slumber. Ann and Lisa had both nuzzled into Kellie before falling asleep on the couch. When they finally did Kellie removed herself from the girls. Kellie glanced back at the sleeping teens before taking the old photo album and flipping through it. She found herself fascinated by pictures of Katie’s birth mom and continued looking them over for quite sometime. Exhaustion finally overtook her as she passed into a fitful sleep.<br />
<br />
Gloria awoke the next morning to find Kellie brewing a pot of coffee in the kitchen. Stretching she made her way into the kitchen to find the college coed still looking over the old pictures. “Morning Kel,” Gloria yawned as she settled into a chair. “How you sleep?”<br />
<br />
Kellie wearily smiled as she poured herself a cup of coffee. “Okay I guess,” she sighed. “Was up late looking over these photos. I’m amazed how similar me and Katie’s mom look. It’s....it’s really something.”<br />
<br />
Gloria now looked over the pictures herself. She had never really taken a look at them before, as she now looked them over she too was surprised how similar Kellie and Katie’s mom looked, the two women could almost be sisters. “Wow,” she exclaimed. “No wonder Ann and Lisa thought you were their sister.”<br />
<br />
As Gloria and Kellie continued looking over the photo album Lisa and Ann began to stir. “Ugh,” Lisa groaned. “Why am I sleeping on the couch.” Rubbing her eyes Lisa now looked herself over. “Oh shit,” she said in surprise, realizing she was a very young teen again. “What happened, how did I get so young?” As she now tried to remember Lisa remembered the ring making her and Ann teens again. Looking to her side Lisa could see the goth Ann still sleeping. “Ann wake up.”<br />
<br />
Ann slowly began to stir, rubbing her eyes she now blinked at Lisa. “Lisa,” she mumbled. “What’s going on? You sound different, what’s....” Ann paused as she now gasped at the teenage Lisa before looking herself over. “Lisa what happened!?!?”<br />
<br />
Lisa sighed as she now tried to calm Ann down. Slowly the two grown down adults began to remember being affected by the Ring of Age. “I remember,” Ann whispered. “We got turned into teens, started fighting. After that it...it gets kinda fuzzy.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Lisa said thoughtfully. “Same thing with me. Although...no that’s crazy.”<br />
<br />
Ann curiously looked at Lisa wondering what she was thinking. “What, What is it?”<br />
<br />
Lisa tried to brush off the feeling. “Can’t be,” she said shaking her head. “But..But I remember our sister...Kellie. She...she was hanging out with us last night.”<br />
<br />
“Lisa,” Ann whispered timidly. “I...I remember her too. She was here.”<br />
<br />
Lisa and Ann stared at each other in awkward silence as they tried to piece together everything that had happened last night. “Morning sleepy heads,” Kellie called from the kitchen. “You two sleep well?”<br />
<br />
Lisa and Ann now turNed towards the college age woman and gawked. “Kellie,” Lisa asked. “What...what are you doing here?”<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled as she explained everyth8g that had happened. How Lisa and Ann began to think like teenagers, how Gloria was transformed into their mother, and finally how the two girls thought Kellie was their sister. As she explained Ann couldn’t help but gawk at the young woman.<br />
<br />
“And then finally you two just woke up,” Kellie said. “Guessing your back to your old selves now. “ Lisa nodded as she looked herself over. “Yeah for the most part,” she said. “It’s weird though why would we confuse you as our sister, that part I don’t get.” Lisa now looked at her sister who was still gawking at Kellie. “Ann,” Lisa exclaimed, causing the girl to jump. “Why are you staring?”<br />
<br />
Ann blinked before looking at Lisa. “You s don’t see it?” She said. <br />
<br />
“See what!”<br />
<br />
“Lisa,” Ann said. “Seriously you can’t see it.” Lisa continued to give her sister a confused look, causing the goth teen to sigh. “Oh my god you were always so oblivious,” she said. Grabbing her younger sisters face she now turned her towards Kellie, pointing at her. “Lisa that girl is the spitting image of Kellie, our sister Kellie.”<br />
<br />
Lisa now looked at the girl she had known for the better part of Kellies life. Slowly Lisa’s eyes grew wide as she gasped. “Holy shit,” she whispered. “Your right! How did I not see it?”<br />
<br />
Kellie blushed slightly as the two teens gaped at her. “Yeah me and Katie’s mom do kinda look alike,” she said. “Their are some differences but it is a little spooky.”<br />
<br />
“How did I never notice this before,” Lisa exclaimed as the two teens slowly approached Kellie. “I mean I’ve known you since you were what? Five? Six? How did I never notice this?”<br />
<br />
“Maybe you just needed a younger perspective,” Kellie said warmly. Lisa nodded as she and Ann now stared up at the college age woman. “So,” Ann said quietly. “How were we last night?”<br />
<br />
“The sibling rivalry is strong between you two,” Kellie smirked. “Seriously, I can only imagine what your house was like when you two were growing up.” The two teens blushed slightly as they exchanged sideways glances at each other. “Well it wasn’t as bad as you think,” Ann said. “Their was a three year age gap between me and Lisa and between me and Katie’s mom. So...Lisa and I really didn’t start fighting until she was about 12 or 13.”<br />
<br />
Kellie rubbed her chin thoughtfully as she now looked the two girls over. “Hmm wonder why the age difference didn’t remain the same between you two when the ring changed you?”<br />
<br />
“I...I think I know,” Lisa said slowly. Kellie and Ann now watched the young red head as she fidgeted in place. Lisa sighed as she looked between Ann and Lisa. “Ann remeber when you were 14 the first time?” Ann shuddered as she recalled that age. “Ugh yes,” she said. “I was so depressed. I was a total outcast at school. If it wasn’t for Kellie, who knows what would of happened to me.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah our sister Kellie got you through one of the toughest times of your life,” Lisa said. “As for me when I was 13, well 13 the first time, I went through a bit of a rough patch.”<br />
<br />
“What happened?” Ann asked. “I mean, you were always the most popular girl in your class. I was always envious of you for that.”<br />
<br />
“Not always,” Lisa said sadly. “When I was 13 I had to deal with a lot of bitter angry girls that were putting me down. I was lonely at school, ostracized by my so called friends, dumped by the guy I liked. I...I felt so alone until Kellie told me to believe in myself. She...she taught me to love myself, no matter what others think. She...gave me confidence.”<br />
<br />
“I...I had no idea,” Ann gaped. “You were always so happy.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah usually,” Lisa smirked. “And that came from Kellie, she gave me so much confidence.” Ann returned her sisters smile, nodding in agreement. “She did the same for me,” she sighed. “Kellie...our sister Kellie, always instilled confidence in us. She made us feel like we could accomplish anything. I still follow the advise she gave us all those years ago.”<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled as the two teens grinned broadly at one another. “Well now we know why you two are this age,” she said. “You two were probably at your lowest points at this time. Looks like Katie’s mom made you two believe in yourselves. So I guess that means you two can grow back up again now.”<br />
<br />
Ann and Lisa looked at each other nervously before turning to Kellie. “Actually,” Lisa said quietly. “I was kinda hoping to stay like this for a little while.” Kellie gaped at the young teen, surprised by this answer. “You sure?”<br />
<br />
“Can’t believe I’m saying this but I agree with Lisa,” Ann said. “And...um, I was kind of hoping we could both kind of hang out with you for awhile.” Kellie smiled before embracing the two young teens in a bear hug. “I’d love that,” she said. As Ann and Lisa now sat down with Kellie they smiled, talking of old times with their sister and enjoying their time with Kellie. For Kellie, it was a moment that she would truely savor for the rest of her days.</p>
