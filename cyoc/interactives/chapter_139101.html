<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff started to rummage through the kitchen to see which type of food he can turn into a hot girl.  Opening the fridge, he looked through tray to see what to use.  That’s when he spotted something on the lower racks.  “Hey!  What’s this?” he asked as he took it out of the fridge.  What he was carrying is that looks like a wooden square plate filled with sushi.<br />
<br />
This dish is comprised of four pieces of sushi and two long rolls.  The two rolls comprised of a California Roll and a spicy tuna roll.  The four pieces of sushi is comprised of two yellowtails, a salmon, and a plain rice sushi with a seaweed wrap on top of it.  And to add to the complete dish is a packet of soy sauce, sashimi, spicy wasabi, and some chop sticks.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked to the dish and knew what it was.  His older brother is more of a sushi guy.  Every week, he buys a small sushi platter to enjoy.  Sometimes he eats it, sometimes he leaves it alone and throws it away when it starts to go bad.  Jeff is always upset that a small dish like that takes up a small space of the fridge.  It always irritates him.  Seeing the latest dish, he knows that his brother would be eating this when he gets back from practice today.  Still, looking at the dish, he thought of what he would do with the sushi.  Since he has the Chronivac that has the Inanimate package where he can turn an inanimate object into a human, he might turn this sushi dish into a real life hottie of a woman.  And giving that this is sushi, he could make the woman Japanese in ethnicity.  To that end, he smirked and said, “If I want a girl made a food, I might use my brother’s dish to create one.  I just hope that my brother doesn’t arrive early.”<br />
<br />
So he took the sushi dish and brought it upstairs to test it out.  Placing the sushi dish on the bed, he approached the computer to begin his work.  He picked up a camera and took a picture of the sushi, then returned to the computer to upload the picture of the sushi dish.  After that, he scrolled down to see the information of the type of human a user would turn an inanimate object into.  Everything from gender, age, race, IQ, occupation, status, sexuality, even a clothing option that the inanimate object turned human would have clothing that matches what the newly created human use to be. There were other options too on the choices you make, like if the human is female, there will be breast size, or male for muscle definition. And at the bottom of the options is the duration of the change and returning the human to its original state, with the option next to it and says, ‘Permanent’ or ‘I’ll change it for later’.  So many choices to create the woman out of sushi.  So, he went to work in getting all this information typed down on what he wanted the woman to be.  Typing and selecting, he finished and skimmed through the options to see if he wasn’t missing something.  So far, it reads…<br />
<br />
Gender: Female<br />
Age: 25<br />
Race: Caucasian/Asian<br />
Body Type: Voluptuous/Curvy<br />
Breast Size: C<br />
IQ: 150<br />
Occupation: Exotic Dancer/Geisha<br />
Status: Single<br />
Sexuality: 50%<br />
Clothing to Fit the Change: Yes<br />
Mental Changes: Yes<br />
Awareness: Yes<br />
Duration of Change: 5 Minutes<br />
Time to Change Back: I’ll change it for later<br />
<br />
Looking through his list, he was satisfied with what he chose.  He wanted his girl to be a Japanese and Caucasian just so she can speak both Japanese and English.  He wanted her to be curvy and voluptuous to have a body that fits in all the right places.  He needed his girl to be not only an exotic dancer to show off her moves, but also acted as somewhat of a geisha to make her more exotic.  He wants her to be half sexuality just to make things fair and let her have sex whenever she feels like.  He wished to let her have mentality changes on, awareness on, and clothing to fit the change as well.  And as far as duration and time to change back, he wants it to be five minutes to see the duration of the change and to change the girl for later, incase things won’t work out.  All of these choices will make the perfect girl out of sushi.<br />
<br />
Seeing his choices, he knows that he’s ready to turn his brother’s sushi dish into a how Japanese geisha woman.  Clicking on the ‘start’ button, a window popped up and has a timer with the 5:00 on it.  It soon started to countdown to 4:59, then 4:58, and 4:57.  Jeff could tell that the changes have actually started.  He turned to the bed that the sushi dish was on top of to see if there were any changes.  So far, there wasn’t nothing of interest.  But then he noticed the platter was starting to shake as it begins the changes.  The plate of sushi started to rise up in the air with the food floating over it.  Jeff doesn’t know what that has to do with the changes.  But he soon saw that the first changes were taking place.<br />
<br />
The first was the wooden square place started to split up into two and started to curve around the edges, curving into what looked like a pair of wooden soles for shoes.  Wood started to grow on the back end was circular, growing into four inch heels.  Then a red strap grew at the top of the front side and curved to the other end.  Soon enough, the wooden tray turned into a pair of wooden Japanese like sandals for the sophisticated Geishas.<br />
<br />
Next come to two sets of sushi rolls as they started to fall to the newly created sandals.  During the fall, all the pieces of both rolls joined together and merged into long sticks.  By the time they were connected, they started to grow in length and begins to take shape.  At the bottom end, it grew weirdly and took shape of what looked like a pair of human feet with no toes.  The sticks started to shape up and became curvy and elegant with the middle forming knees, turning into long and shapely legs.  Yet on the inside, it still looked like sushi and has both the California and spicy tuna rolls from the inside.  Both of these newly created legs soon slipped into the sandals and stood there like a statue.<br />
<br />
That soon same the first piece of sushi, the salmon.  It was next to fall as it was reaching the pair of legs.  As that too was falling, it started to expand and shifted shape, almost looking female in design.  The middle of the sushi compacted inward and created a curvy hourglass.  The back bottom end expanded and increase in mass, forming what looks like a bubble like butt.  And the higher top area had two bumps pocking out, growing in mass and in size, creating a pair of C cup breasts.  The salmon skin of the sushi begins to wrap around the rice end and turned into what looks like a one piece pink bikini with floral design wrapped around in a diagonal form and a zipper in the back while stumps appeared on the top, sides, and bottoms to form a neck, shoulders, and upper thighs.  By the time the now full body was finished, it landed right on top of the leg shaped sushi and connected together; the legs look like they were long black stockings.<br />
<br />
Then came both yellowtails as they started to fall right to the body.  The two pieces of sushi started to grow and thin as they took shape of what looked like tones and slender like arms.  The bottom ends soon took another shape and expanded into dainty hands with delicate fingers started to grow out of the ends.  The yellowtail skin soon grew and covered the arms and hands, forming yellow gloves that grow up to the upper biceps.  The two soon reached the body and landed to the shoulder stomps, connecting and falling limp on the sides.  Soon it looked like a complete body without the head.  But that will change soon enough.<br />
<br />
It was then that the plain rice sushi started to fall and headed straight towards the neck stomp of the body.  Once it connected, the piece started to expand and grew wide and oval, forming a human like head.  All the rice pieces merged into one and smoothed over, leaving a white like human like skin.  Soon enough, features started to appear on the head.  First, two holes poked out and cartilage grew out around it, forming into a pair of functioning ears as the sushi girl started to hear for the first time.  Two dots started to appear at the upper front of her face and deepened into eyelids with lashes growing out of it, sharpening into an almond shape.  Eyebrows soon grew over the lids and acted as black arches.  Two more holes appear at the middle of the human like face and more cartilage grew with it, forming a thin and elegant like nose, letting this almost created woman taking a first breath of fresh air.  Then a line started to form under the nose and the skin begins to puff up and darken, turning into plushy and kissable lips.  Behind the lips, the inside of the nearly created woman’s mouth started to from, growing gums, teeth, tongue, and a uvula.  The black strip that remained on top of her head begins to grow down and shines, separating into thousands of thin strands and was sleek, turning into a full head of black hair that goes down to her lower back.  And to top it all off, a mole appeared at the side of her right eye, giving her face a mature and unique definition.<br />
<br />
Jeff starred on and was completely amazed.  Standing before him is a fully naked Japanese woman with wooden sandals that used to have been a sushi platter, he could feel a boner coming on, but tries to control it as he wanted to see the rest of the changes.  After all, the newly created woman is in need of some clothes and a look and that rest of the platter moves to the body.<br />
<br />
The first will be the Sashimi as all of the strands approached the body and wrapped around it, from the body, to the legs, to the arms.  They soon merged together as one piece and shifted into a fabric like attire.  The arm ends expanded and was wide enough to hang from the bottom end and the color changed into a lighter purple with black Asian designs spread across it.  The fabric lightened and started to looks a little see through, exposing the oriental dress underneath.  And another piece of sashimi came up from the back of the waistline and wrapped around the midsection, turning into a light purple like the outfit around it and tightened around her waist for a shapely figure.  That soon turned into a sexy looking Kimono that goes down to above her knees.  Jeff looked on in awe and was amazed that all the Sashimi became Kimono around the newly created Japanese woman, sexy attire by the looks of it.<br />
<br />
The last two were the Wasabi and the chopsticks as the green spice floated up to her face and expanded, splatting on her like a pie.  The Wasabi soon changed into a variety of colors and turned into makeup for a geisha, complete with white face paint, black eyeliner, red eye shadow, rosy cheeks, and red lipstick.  Her long hair soon rose up automatically and tides itself into a well knit Japanese bum as the two chopsticks came down to the top of the head and inserted themselves into the bun, making them look like a hair piece.  In almost five minutes, what was a sushi meal for Jeff’s brother is now a smoking how Japanese Geisha dressed all sultry and pretty.  Jeff was amazed at the sight and couldn’t believe how hot the newly created woman looked.<br />
<br />
The last change that happened was her mind as it was filling with human knowledge, education, and history.  But most of it has to do with her being an exotic dancer and professional geisha, giving her such experience and success.  When her mind was completely filled, she slowly opened her exotic green eyes and observes her surroundings, completing the changes.  Jeff marveled at the woman before her as he never seen such a beautiful woman before.  The Geisha looked to herself, as she starred at her hand that’s already coated in red nail polish and opened and closed it.  Then she proceeded in cupping her breasts with her hands and squeezed them a little, feeling how full and jiggly they are.  Jeff just couldn’t help but to feel aroused by that as he started to have a boner in his pants.<br />
<br />
The newly transformed woman soon looked to Jeff and said in her Japanese like accent, “Excuse me…  But was a just a Sushi dish before?  I believe that’s all I remember?”<br />
<br />
Jeff could tell that she was aware of what she once was and what she became.  So he explains himself of what happened.  “Yes, you were.  Apparently you were supposed to be my brother’s lunch or dinner, depending on when.  But I used the Chronivac over there to turn you into a human female and gave you a life you would dream of.”  He soon pointed to the computer where the Chronivac was still on after explaining himself.<br />
<br />
The woman turned to the computer with the Chronivac and was intrigued by what happened to her.  Turning to the full length mirror, she decided to look at her reflection and did a few exotic poses.  After looking at herself, she said to her creator.  “You gave me life?  You made me human?”<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded and said, “Yes, I did.”<br />
<br />
She soon turned to Jeff and said, “D&#333;mo arigat&#333;.  Thank you for giving me a new life.”<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled and offered a hand.  “Don’t mention it.” He said to her, “It’s either that or have you eaten by my brother.  I’m Jeff by the way.”<br />
<br />
The geisha looked at the hand and decided to politely bow to him, as a way of a Japanese greeting.  “Kon&#39;nichiwa, Jeff-san.  I would like to introduce myself, but I’m afraid I don’t have a name.  Can you help me?”<br />
<br />
Jeff heard that and realized that she has a point.  He turned a sushi dish into a woman, he never thought of giving her a name.  So he thought hard and wondered what name would suit her.  All that he could think of though is that she was sushi and sushi is delicious.  That’s when it hit him.  Delicious has a Japanese word that fits her.  Going on his phone, he went to the translate app and checked to see what’s the Japanese word for delicious.  Seeing what it means, he smiled and looked up to the woman with that perfect name.<br />
<br />
“How about, Oishi.  It’s Japanese for delicious and Sushi is the most delicious meal in Japan.”<br />
<br />
The woman heard that name and finds it fitting for her.  “Yes, Oishi sounds like a name I would enjoy.  Thanks for that name.  So, what shall we do now?”<br />
<br />
Jeff heard Oishi’s questions and was ecstatic.  He now has an exotic Japanese geisha woman in his room and would do whatever he wants with her.  Oishi too was excited and wanted to experience her new life as a human.  The question is, what will they do?</p>
