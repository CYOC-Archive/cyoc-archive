<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aaron felt weird. Everything about this body was odd, new, and partly downright embarrassing. With every step, he shook his hips a little. The large weights of his new breasts rose and fell with every breath. His &quot;skin&quot; encased his flesh like a suit of armor. Above his rear, a spider butt dangled behind him, surprisingly not as heavy as it looked like. He had no clue what to do with his four new hands and the lack of manhood in his pants made him feel squeamish. His legs were long and shapely, with an odd feeling of power behind them as if he could crater in a wall with a single kick.<br />
<br />
Terrifyingly, the concept of thinking of himself as male was starting to feel off a little...off when he took a look at his undeniably feminine body.<br />
<br />
What had that lovely idiot Mark gotten them into?<br />
<br />
He shook his head. Lovely? Really, Aaron?<br />
<br />
The group was travelling across town to where their place supposedly was now as he now apparently lived with his favourite band of weirdos.<br />
<br />
Aaron looked over at Michelle and Leira.<br />
<br />
When he looked at them, he regularly remembered things from what was apparently now a different timeline. <br />
<br />
Lars and Michael, as far as he was aware. His mind contained two versions of the past, the one he was experiencing now and a foggy, other one, where people like Michelle, Leira and as he guessed, himself now, weren&#39;t extremely rare, but actually non-existant. <br />
<br />
He remembered learning about people like them in school and how they were a rare people that usually came to be due to quirks in the genetic code caused by crossbreeding between humans and their ancestors. Two of them actually coming together, and having children was rare as there were barely any fish in their pond, so to say. Their population barely reached four digits. They weren&#39;t even a large enough minority to be really ostracized! Back in medieval times, people legitimately thought that wolf men and the like were just oddly hairy humans from far-off lands. Moths like Michelle were thought to be forest spirits and the inspiration for Irish fairies. Dragons like Leira were hired to fight in the armies of emperors for fucks sake. <br />
<br />
It was the dream of a lot of people to wake up one day to find that the genes that caused these transformations had activated. <br />
<br />
He hadn’t been one of those people. <br />
<br />
<br />
All of that... wasn&#39;t true? Or at least hadn&#39;t been true before today?<br />
<br />
Aaron looked over to the charming little guy that was his master and...<br />
<br />
...What was that feeling? His heartbeat accelerated when he saw his smile and between his legs...he felt wet.<br />
<br />
His face crunched up as he gave off a hiss. No, no,no,no! NO! Not happening. Mark wasn&#39;t even in the slightest attractive to him. No way.<br />
<br />
But then...what was that feeling of butterflies he felt in his stomach or the sensation between his legs. Or the odd desire to put his hands on the cutie and shove him onto a bed?<br />
<br />
Shit. He had a crush on the fucker! <br />
<br />
The realization embarrassed him to no end. Barely a woman for four hours and it already was messing with his sense of self. Had he...always been bisexual or was that something new? <br />
<br />
Aaron sighed. There&#39;s no sense in suppressing it, he supposed. If anything, it basically doubled his dating pool. Yeah, look at the positives, he tried to remind himself. It would be over tomorrow. <br />
<br />
At that last thought, a part of his brain told him something. &quot;If so, then why don&#39;t we try it while we have the time?&quot;<br />
<br />
The fact that the idea of actually making love to a guy didn&#39;t sound so unpleasant anymore was...scary.<br />
<br />
For a moment, he imagined himself pushing a little dude against a wall and making out. Also odd. He didn’t remember being so...dominant in such settings, but when his mind conjured up images of him being more submissive, he felt disgusted, actually. <br />
<br />
Oh, was he into some kind of soft femdom now? Going through his thoughts for the last couple of minutes again, he did notice that he had always thought of himself as the man...ughh...woman in charge.<br />
<br />
This whole thing was getting to his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Aaron, you are being awfully quiet.&quot; Said Mark. The concern in his expression was so adorable. He just wanted to hold onto his cheeks and -<br />
<br />
No swooning. Get it together he told himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just trying to deal with all of this.&quot; He said, subconsciously putting two of his six arms below his chest to push it up a little. &quot;It doesn&#39;t help that this body is a bit ridiculously oversexxed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark awkwardly combed through his hair. Aaron wanted to do that. &quot;Well, it IS the body you rolled up for our game.&quot;<br />
<br />
He sighed. &quot;That abomination of a game you made unironically had a libido stat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And yours is maxxed out.&quot; Said Leira. <br />
<br />
That explained things. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you do look really gorgeous though.&quot; Added Michelle.<br />
<br />
&quot;And muscular.&quot; Stated Mark with a blush.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehe, I think Mark likes you. He likes his women large and in charge.&quot; Commented Leira.<br />
<br />
Mark blushed even harder. <br />
<br />
Oh, he did? Aaron felt another crisis oncoming as they reached the apartment complex that had suspiciously grown since last thevtime he saw it.<br />
<br />
It was already getting pretty  dark, so the others decided that this was enough transformations for a day. <br />
<br />
Michelle soon laid there, sprawled out on the sofa while Leira laid on a large pillow, watching a live streamer deep throat his microphone on the TV. <br />
<br />
What Mark said rang true as his apartment had been weirdly morphed into the building.<br />
<br />
He opened his own door, immediately noticing things that looked off. Very off. On his wall hang an art piece of a shirtless man that was giving him all kinds of weird thoughts. A picture frame showed his new body in a dress that made it look he was REALLY desperate to get laid. <br />
<br />
Shit, that looked hot. Was he actuallly getting turned on from looking at his own body? What kind of narcissist had he become?<br />
<br />
Aaron shook his head again. He was becoming used to all of this far too fast. Worst of all, thinking about himself as Aaron was starting to feel weird. A name hid in the corners of his mind, but he couldn&#39;t quite grasp it. A customer had called him that earlier. <br />
<br />
Continuing to look across the room, he found his new clothing. Didn&#39;t Michelle have to buy her own clothes? Why did he get them for free? Aaron was starting to suspect that this &quot;TF-Pad&quot; perhaps had a few bugs and considering what it could do, that may have been bad news. <br />
<br />
Now, the moment of truth. <br />
He closed his eyes as he slowly undressed, feeling the fabric lift from his smooth exoskeleton. <br />
<br />
When all that was left was his underwear he took a glance in the mirror. <br />
<br />
His eight eyes widened at the sight.<br />
<br />
He shouldn&#39;t look good. He was some anthropomorphic spider woman, but somehow he looked...just gorgeous. His thighs looked like they could crush a watermelon. His breasts were large, but didn&#39;t look off on his wider torso and his hips would just be perfect for a lover to hold onto. He didn’t just look pretty, but...powerfull. those arms weren&#39;t thin or dainty. <br />
<br />
All of this should have felt wrong, but the closer he looked the more positive things he found. Sure, the body was a bit  overly sexy, but it had its benefits. The spider bits were kind of charming. He hadn’t tried to make silk yet, but his eyes were so beautifully shiny that he was certainly getting why he had fans. <br />
<br />
Somehow, now that the initial shock was over he weirdly found that he did not really care about his lack of manhood. He neither felt the gender dysphoria Michael must have felt nor the euphoria Michelle must have been feeling now. What did it say about him if he was just a little ambivalent towards a straight up magical sex and species change? <br />
<br />
Well, while he always had seen himself as a straight male, he wasn&#39;t really emotionally attached to his manhood or heterosexuality. While they certainly shaped who he was, he never saw them as important parts of his personality.<br />
<br />
Even now, the thought of making love to  a guy was sounding a lot less unpleasant as long as he was the one pulling the strings.<br />
<br />
Perhaps...<br />
<br />
The door opened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I wanted to make sure you were doing well-&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark had stepped in, staring at him eyes wide. &quot;Sorry, didn&#39;t know you were in your underwear!&quot;<br />
<br />
Before he could turn to leave, Aaron stopped him. &quot;No, please. Come here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Slowly, turning around, Mark stared at him.<br />
<br />
Aaron took a deep breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to have sex with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Both of them froze, equally surprised by what Aaron had just said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am sorry...what? Are you feeling well?&quot; Asked Mark, his head red like a tomato.<br />
<br />
Aaron sighed. &quot;I am currently discovering a lot about me and two of those things are that I am apparently bisexual. Just never really noticed that one till I got this body. Probably because every little thing can make it horny as fuck.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark still rubbed his skull awkwardly. Aaron wanted to do that. &quot;I get that. It took Michael to make me figure that out myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The other thing is that this new form and all the hormones may have... given me a crush on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Somehow his adorable cheeks became redder as he stood there entirely overwhelmed.<br />
<br />
The spider woman walked over to him and wrapped four arms around his back, Mark&#39;s face now mere centimeters  from rubbing up again his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if I am gonna have to deal with this for a day I thought I might as well try it out. You are like, the one dude I trust to actually try and make me feel good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark looked at him with aroused exasperation. &quot;Look, I am certain this would be lovely, but I am certain this is the TF-Pad messing with you. I don&#39;t want you to bludgeon me to death when you turn back tomorrow and realize that you had me in you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t, I assure you that won&#39;t happen...&quot; He trailed off before starting back up again. &quot;...as long you make me feel happy tonight. There is still a part of me that is angry with you. Don&#39;t force its hand~.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron felt oddly flirtatious. It kind of came natural to him and Mark was just so easy to charm. He was so adorable when he was blushing.<br />
<br />
Moving closer to Mark, he breathed heavily. Between his legs, his new ladybits were yearning to be touched and his nipples were rubbing against his bra.<br />
<br />
He pushed him against the door. &quot;Please. I want you so much!&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally, Mark wrapped his hands around Aaron&#39;s waist. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, you have seduced me.&quot; He said, his breath heavy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can tell.&quot; Aaron said, pointing at the visible erection in his pants.<br />
<br />
Aaron knew that he shouldn&#39;t be acting like this, but it felt so good. He was definitely thinking with his vagina right now, but why resist it?<br />
<br />
&quot;Just... don&#39;t be too rough on me.&quot; Said Mark. <br />
<br />
The spider woman took a step back and tried to clear his head. &quot;That didn’t sound enthusiastic. I want you to need me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are hot as fuck, I just feel unwell about fucking you. You are acting so differently.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, how about we just cuddle on my bed for a moment, get you comfortable and in the mood?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
He gasped when Aaron lifted him into his arms. Yeah, the look Mark was giving him right now was exactly what he wanted. That abash, innocent look. Putting him down onto the bed, Aaron felt powerful. It was addicting. Soon, he knew, he would have his master wrapped around his finger. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gosh, this body is just...whewwww. I hope it will get better after we are done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That bad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can  barely think about anything but sex right now. I am such a slut...&quot; A little bit of shame wormed it&#39;s way into his heart.<br />
<br />
Mark put a hand on his shoulder. &quot;You just have different needs now, and that libido is certainly messing with you.<br />
<br />
When Aaron nodded Mark said. &quot;How about this: I am going to give you head, and then you will decide whether or not   you would actually like... being penetrated when you are not entirely veiled in lust.&quot;<br />
<br />
Having Mark eat him out? &quot;Yeah, sure. I&#39;d like that, but let us cuddle first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Getting the blanket, he wrapped it around the two of them, and then climbed on top of Mark, his breasts firmly squeezed against his chest. <br />
<br />
A fire erupted in his loins when he noticed how transfixed Mark was on them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Want to take my bra off?&quot; He cooed.<br />
<br />
Nodding, Mark soon found his way to the piece of plastic and opened it up. <br />
<br />
The fabric gave way to his tits as they came to rest on Mark&#39;s chest.<br />
<br />
Inside Aaron&#39;s mind orders for more and more hormones were given. Every smallest bit of his body was crying out in desire and so Aaron reached forward and planted a kiss on Mark&#39;s cheek. <br />
<br />
&quot;You are shaking.&quot; Noted Mark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lust.&quot; He stammered out.<br />
<br />
Sighing, Mark said. &quot;I&#39;ll deal with it. Get off of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rolling onto his back, Aaron felt a powerful, animalistic need. There was a desirable male in his bed and his brain couldn&#39;t figure out why he was so reluctant. I want him to want this, repeated his conscious mind again and again. Taking master without his consent? No, no... that wouldn&#39;t go. Master would never forgive him. He would never forgive himself.<br />
<br />
In his lust-fueled haze he hadn’t noticed Mark moving between his legs till he started taking off what remained of his underwear. Seductively moving his shapely legs, he kicked the bottom piece off, revealing his unarmored crotch and the womanhood that resided there.<br />
<br />
Mark looked up at him and he just nodded in response. <br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, he stared on as Mark came closer to his nether region. <br />
<br />
A moan escaped his lips when Mark&#39;s tongue made contact with his clit.<br />
<br />
Wrapping two of his arms around Mark&#39;s head, he buried him in his crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! More!&quot;<br />
<br />
Obviously spurred on by his moan, Mark moved faster, skillfully dancing across his folds. <br />
<br />
Aaron reached up to his breasts and started fondling himself while he started to respond to Mark&#39;s licks by grinding against his face.<br />
<br />
Any remaining hesitation Aaron had felt dissipated as all he could focus on was the mating. <br />
<br />
Every part of his body was on fire as he moved to meet Mark&#39;s touch. <br />
<br />
Aaron yearned for his touch, wanting nothing but to fuck him into submission all day long. Master would surely love that. <br />
<br />
As they made love, a slider was moving in Aaron&#39;s mind, going from he to they to she as any remaining masculine identity was slowly being fucked out of him.<br />
<br />
The spider&#39;s movements became hectic and rapid. Pleasure surged through Aaron as she released a loud moan, coming to an intense orgasm that made her sack down onto the bed.<br />
<br />
Finally something registered in her mind. Ari was her true name.<br />
<br />
Taking heavy breaths as her libido was quenched, she looked down at Mark.<br />
<br />
They had really just done that. Her mind now far less clouded by lust, she felt a little ashamed by what had happened.<br />
<br />
Not even a day as a woman and she had already fallen for a guy. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t... believe we just did that.&quot;<br />
<br />
This seemed to distress Mark. &quot;Oh, did you not enjoy it? My skills are a little rusty when it comes to wom-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no. It was great. 10 out 10 oral. It is just... my judgements were so clouded by lust, and I acted so...horny... I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a lot to take in?:<br />
<br />
She nodded.<br />
<br />
Mark came closer and wrapped his arms around her mid-section, which she reciprocated with six of hers and then complemented with a kiss on Mark&#39;s cheek.<br />
<br />
Unsure what to do, Ari asked. &quot;What now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I will take my leave soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You haven&#39;t had an orgasm yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark blushed. &quot;You don&#39;t have to do anything you don&#39;t want to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now that her body was sated, the thought of being penetrated was making her squeamish again, but perhaps...<br />
<br />
Ari started taking off Mark&#39;s shirt, four of her hands instantly starting to feel Mark up. <br />
<br />
Then she pushed him onto his back. <br />
<br />
&quot;I will take care of you.&quot; She said, somehow sounding far more confident than she really was. <br />
<br />
Finding her way to his belt, she started taking of his jeans, becoming witness to his prominent erection in his underpants. <br />
<br />
Ari&#39;s shoulder was held by Mark as he gave her a concerned look. &quot;Are you sure?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all... but I want to try.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, she took off his underwear, looking away.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, she looked down at his manhood, butterflies coursing through her stomach.<br />
<br />
She looked at it with curious uncertainty.<br />
<br />
A couple hours earlier, the thought of taking hold of a guy&#39;s dick would have been disgusting, but now it just made her feel anticipation. <br />
<br />
Her main, right hand moved towards the phallus, stopping shortly in front of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here we go, Ari.&quot; She told herself. And with that, her hand took hold of his erection. Her heart beat faster as another of her hands reached for it.<br />
<br />
Looking up at Mark for approval, he was staring back at her in anticipation and underlying excitement. <br />
<br />
Slowly, she started moving her hands up and down the shaft, moving her head closer.<br />
<br />
Was she really about to give Mark head?  Shit, she was.<br />
<br />
Ari stopped mere centimeters from his cock, shaking a little as she got out her tongue and gave it a quick lick.<br />
<br />
Mark squirmed under her touch, and that carried her on. It wasn&#39;t... that bad. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Ari, thousands of women do this every day.&quot; She told herself.<br />
<br />
She wanted to please him and make him orgasm. The idea of leaving a sexual partner unsatisfied, especially when they had already pleased her, just didn&#39;t feel right. She knew that she owed him nothing, but there still was that part of her brain that had always been there, complaining about the idea of not getting her lover off. <br />
<br />
So she lowered her face to his junk and opened her lips, slowly going down on him.<br />
<br />
Her lips clamped down on his erection. Ari looked up at him for approval again. He looked so cute when he was on the edge.<br />
<br />
Her tongue trailed along his shaft as she moved up and down.<br />
<br />
Mark started leaking precum, which she just tried to ignore. <br />
<br />
She quickened her pace, doing her best to make him feel the appreciation she felt for him. <br />
<br />
His groans got her going again and she felt her lust flare up. <br />
<br />
His cock thrusted deeper into her as she moved faster and faster, his noises of pleasure becoming everything she desired.<br />
<br />
Somehow, she felt oddly in control as she went down on him, as if he was more her plaything than she was his despite him being her master.<br />
<br />
Something in her new spider instincts really liked that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you... should probably stop now.&quot;<br />
<br />
But his warning were too late as Ari felt him blow his load into her awaiting maw, Mark moaning loudly. She did her best to just swallow it before she could even properly get the taste, but she wasn&#39;t fast enough, leaving her mouth covered in the unpleasant liquid.<br />
<br />
She reached for a water bottle on her bedside table, trying her best to get that taste out of her mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot; Said Mark.<br />
<br />
She laughed. &quot;I think I get why my ex complained about that now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ari got back on top of him, curling the blanket around them as his face was firmly pressed against her breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just go to sleep, handsome. Just go to sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
Only 30 seconds later, the exhausted spider woman fell asleep on top of him.</p>
