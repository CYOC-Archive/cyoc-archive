<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meanwhile at Scott&#39;s house, they had all finished eating, the twins and Zack had felt bad about leaving Zack aside and joined him right in the middle of the two and were in the living room watching TV, or I could say that they did it because Zack was the only one who did it while Mark and Max checked their phone each with an arm.<br />
Scott-Sharon were doing the dishes in the kitchen still joined. <br />
“Hey boys, why I you go out and see if Luke and Evan are already awake, I’m sure you’ll find something to do” said Scott while grabbing a plate I his hand and Sharon was drying it with the other<br />
“But they can’t go out like that” said Sharon<br />
“Of course not, even less with Ethan not wanting Evan to know about this”<br />
The three brothers walked to the stairs and went into the twins’ room, there they try to split one from the other <br />
“Hey guy what are you doing, just let me go” said Zack as a strange energy forced him to stay in the body, <br />
“I´m not doing anything,” said Mark<br />
“It is not me either” said Max<br />
“Drop it Max, this is no time for playing games” replied Mark<br />
“I told you I’m not doing anything”<br />
“If you are not doing it, why can’t we separate from each other?” <br />
“I don’t want to be in the middle of you two forever” said Zack<br />
“You won’t” said Max<br />
“Ok at the count of three, everyone will pull to a different direction, ok?” said Mark and his brothers nodded <br />
 After Mark finished counting, the three of them were trying to split each one from a different direction, Max to the left, Mark to the right and Zack to the front, lowly their bodies started to split.<br />
Soon everyone was able to get one leg out of the body, and then each had his torso completely separated with each of his free arms, leaving them only united by one leg, Max’s right leg, Zack’s and Mark’s left legs were still joined in one  but they couldnt get them apart.<br />
With one las effort they try to separate from each other but fail as they all fall to the ground, Mark and Max got their backs on the floor whle Zack just got over Marks chest, as Zack wobble to get on his foot, Mark could feel his little brother’s, ass getting rubbed to his crotch, his face blushed as he made his brother to stop, before he could get something right in between Zack’s buns.<br />
Slowly the three of them stood up, and they found themselves in the mirror, practically their bodies were separated to the hip where their legs united in one, Zack to being smaller of stature kept his free leg of tip. <br />
“Oh great now we can’t get our legs apart” complained Max<br />
“Hey at least we got the rest of our body apart” said Mark<br />
“Maybe if we try one more time” proposed Zack<br />
The three brothers attempted to get apart meanwhile downstairs Scott and Sharon had finished cleaning everything up<br />
“ok, so we finished doing the dishes, its Saturday and the kids will soon be leaving the house, so that means” Scott started as he grabbed his shared vagina with Sharon.<br />
“Wow Scott! The kids are still upstairs” she said with a guilty smile<br />
“But…” they stopped when a noise coming from upstairs surprised them. “Now what are they doing?”<br />
Son both parents, “parent” started walking up the stairs and entered the twin’s room to find the three of their sons laying on the ground pulling their leg.<br />
“What are you all doing?” asked Scott<br />
The three boys looked at their conjoined parents as they entered, they have already seen their upper body before, both of their heads, Scott and Sharon’s, on the same shoulders, on the right side it was their dad’s arm showing some red hairs and the other side it was Sharon’s delicate arm, in the middle they had both of Sharon’s breasts because of a decision they have made, their belly was only partially hairy as Sharon’s side remained smooth, down below they saw their old man’s big hairy dick, which they were already familiar with since they had shared body with their father before, but below that dick they could see their mother’s vagina right were their balls should be hanging. <br />
Instantly all the boys turned around and blushed.<br />
“Mom, dad, cover up!” they all said<br />
“Huh, oh don’t tell me your embarrassed of seeing your father like this, now that your mother and I can join together you should get used to see us naked, it’s not like you had this problem when it was just me” said Scott<br />
“Yeah dad back then it was just you, not mom” said Max<br />
“Oh don’t tell me you’re embarrassed of seen a vagina?” asked Scott<br />
“We are not” but we are talking about mom!” said Mark<br />
“Yeah” joined Zack<br />
“I think I should get going, if that makes my little boy uncomfortable” said Sharon<br />
“But honey, they..”<br />
“Just leave it Scott, it’s all going so fast, I’ll just go and get somethings set” said Sharon, 	Scott couldn’t do anything else but releasing her from their body since she doesn’t have the power to manipulate their body yet. After that she left to the main dorm.<br />
“Ok then why were you all struggling on the floor?”<br />
“It just that we got stuck and couldn’t split.” Said Zack<br />
“it’s that all?” asked Scott “ok now I’m here to help you on this little problem, at the count of three you all try to separate while I pull you all apart.”<br />
Soon their leg started to split leaving just their feet together as a strange combination of the three with toes going in three different directions. With one last effort they were all apart and thank their father.<br />
After that the 4 men went to a different place, Scott and Zack to their own room, while Mark and Zack grabbed some clothes and started to drees in each bed.<br />
“That was a scary though” said mark as he put on some shorts<br />
“I have to admit, I was afraid we would be stuck together forever” getting his legs in a pair of jeans<br />
“You know it wouldn’t be that bad for us, but Zack is still too young” said Mark lifting his left leg and putting a sock<br />
“Yeah, we could also have fused ourselves to have the same age, but I guess two heads still better than… what happened to your scar? “Said Max<br />
“Huh? What do you mean?” asked Mark<br />
“The one you got with that old bicycle years ago”  <br />
“What? It’s still right here…” Mark looked at his leg but couldn’t find any sign of that scar “I guess it just healed”<br />
“No but that no possible I saw a couple of days ago, how could a scar that it’s been there for years could heal itself in a couple of days?” asked Max<br />
“You’re right, do you think the fact that we have joined our bodies might have made it disappear?”<br />
“Not likely” started Max but then he pulled the jeans up his leg to see it for himself, Mark’s scar was now in his body right in the same spot<br />
“What is it? Isn’t that?” mumbled Mark “but that impossible!”<br />
“Do you think we might accidentally switched our legs?” asked Max<br />
“What if actually changed bodies and we didn’t noticed! I’m mean we are identical except from that scar” proposed Mark<br />
“But that would be a complete improve of this power” <br />
“We gotta tell everyone” said Mark<br />
“Wait, why we just keep this to ourselves, just for now, until we know what really happened” said Max<br />
“You’re right, even for me, thinking that I’m in your body its weird, no matter how similar we are”<br />
Then both brothers got dressed and went outside to Luke’s house with accompanied by their younger brother.</p>
