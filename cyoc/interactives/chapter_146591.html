<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This chapter is taking place relatively at the same time as this one: <a href="/interactives/chapter_145236.html">#145236</a> </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Two gleaming wedding bands on the fingers of such  conservative and influential men like the Reverend Sullivan and Governor Colyer were like a beacon for the curse as it worked its power over the diminishing number of homosexuals in the former Pride parade. It knew that those rings would have partners somewhere in the crowd...<br />
<br />
====<br />
<br />
Janice and Marcie were among those confused by the changes that had come over those gathered for the Pride parade. The two twenty-something lesbians held hands as a certain hateful preacher spoke from the stage and condemned them for their sexuality.<br />
<br />
&quot;My gawd, I can&#39;t believe that bigot is being allowed to speak&quot; said Marcie who naturally blonde hair was streaked with dark green and blue. She was the more outspoken of the couple, having come into her queer identity back in junior high. She hadn&#39;t looked back since kicking open the closet door.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but don&#39;t you think it&#39;s weird that Tim and Ami just disappeared right before he started speaking,&quot; asked Janice as she brushed a long lock of brown hair from her face to reveal a variety of face piercings glittering in the afternoon sun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, baby. I&#39;m sure they went to get some help in chasing this guy off..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but they&#39;re not the only ones who...&quot;<br />
<br />
The rest of the sentence was cut off by a sudden kiss from Marcie.  Janice leaned into it, her concern fading as a warm feeling of attraction for her girlfriend welled up in her. But this display of affection was just what the &#39;were breeder&#39; curse the unsuspecting pair carried had been waiting for.<br />
<br />
There was a sudden movement of the crowd that pressed against and pulled the two lesbians apart from one another, carrying them in opposite directions in more ways than one.<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
A furious Marcie tried to push against the crush of people but it was too strong even for her. And what was worse, it seemed to be moving her even closer to the stage where that damned Reverend Sullivan was speaking.<br />
<br />
So caught up in this struggle, she failed to notice the changes being wrought upon her clothes. It started with her green cut-off jean shorts as the material fused into one tube and stretched down to just below her knees. The denim became looser as it shifted to plain cotton, the green darkening deeper in the process. Belt loops retracted and pockets vanished into nothing as it completed its change into a forest green high waisted skirt.<br />
<br />
Next, her bright pink crop-top began to reshape itself. Dark green sleeves sprouted from the garment and rolled down her arms as a thick white circular band formed along the top just over her shoulders. The pink was being consumed by a wave of green as the bottom hem pulled itself closer to the skirt below, where it started to fuse and sealed off her stomach from view.<br />
<br />
Of course, the clothes were hardly the only thing changing now. Underneath the new attire, Marcie&#39;s body was altering itself. Her stomach, once tight with toned muscle, developed a bit flab, while her hips widened with a loud crack to be more suited for birthing. Her smallish breasts began to grow, the sag of them pulling the top of her dress tighter, before an unseen bra cupped and held them firmly.<br />
<br />
Her legs, thin and athletic, thickened as well with the meaty expansion continuing up to her thighs and ass. The skin lost much of its smoothness as sheer hosiery rose from what had been her socks to encase the increasing veiny legs.<br />
<br />
Marcie finally freed herself from the crush of people, only to be standing in front a short staircase that led up onto the stage. The booming voice of the Reverend Sullivan rang in her ears, as the speakers it came out of were so much closer now. But strangely, her previous disgust at his words seemed to be...fading, along with her memory of Jan..who? Instead, the head of the rebellious lesbian was beginning to fill new thoughts, that of someone who was dutiful and loyal. Of someone who loved.. her husband?<br />
<br />
 As she took a first step onto the stairs unconsciously, her sneakers began shift in form. Heels erupted from the bottom as the tops split down the middle to reveal her feet. Laces fell away as the white leather turned into green. The sudden rise in her footwear caused her straighten up, her posture going from a twenty-something&#39;s slouch to the confident poise of a mature woman. <br />
<br />
Each step up brought more alterations to her mind. Away went her attraction to women, replaced with the devotion of a wife to her husband. Her rebellion against the system inverted into a proud respect for the status quo and proper order of things. Memories of her college courses were pushed out by a sudden tide of rememberances of a life well lived, and of a family she was proud to be the matriarch of. She could recall the faces of her sons clearly, as well as that her daughter Emma who&#39;d married her...husband&#39;s apprentice in the ministry...<br />
<br />
Now the changes came to her head and face. The piercings that filled her face started to melt and flow away. Some of this metal settled around her neck, reforming into a golden chain with a glittering gold cross upon it. Two portions jumped over to her ears, piercing them to form into earrings.<br />
<br />
Her blonde hair turned a deep chestnut brown, as white and silver over took the green and blue streaks. Her short bob grew out and down to her shoulders as her face matured well beyond her twenties. Laugh lines around her thick red lips, and crows&#39; feet neaer the silver frames of her eyeglasses that helped her now brown eyes see better. Her teeth glistened white as she smiled widely.<br />
<br />
As Reverend Sullivan&#39;s speech reached a crescendo, the changed woman began to applaud fiercely. Her nails were now longer and red with polish, as a final bit of her former piercings looped around her ring finger to form a golden wedding band. <br />
<br />
Ernest stepped away from the pulpit, and his thick arms encircled his lovely wife, Marian Sullivan. The kiss she gave him was deep and devoted, a reflection of her commitment to him and their decades long partnership. <br />
<br />
Below the crowd cheered this example of the values they craved....<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
Janice tried to get through the crowd but she couldn&#39;t break through. The flow carried her away from her girlfriend and the stage, back towards the rear of the gathered mass. <br />
<br />
As she escaped from this push, she failed to see that the curse had begun to work its influence over her. Her pink belly tee shirt with a wide rainbow on it had been the first to feel its power. The cotton of the shirt seemed to thicken three fold as a wave of blue washed over it. Sleeves snaked downwards, washing away the various tattoos that had covered her arms in the process, and leaving behind well toned limbs. At the wrist, buttons popped out and the white cuffs of a blouse peaked out under the arms of a forming blue jacket.<br />
<br />
The developing jacket pulled itself tight against Janice&#39;s chest as it buttoned up to her neck, allowing only the top of her blouse collar to show. As it compressed her torso, it was pushed back against by a sudden swelling of her bustline, whose rounded curves stood out proudly, supported by an unseen silky bra.<br />
<br />
Her jeans were next on the agenda of the curse, the legs fusing together into a single tube that rose like a curtain to reveal toned and tanned skin below. Settling at her knees, the material shifted to match the jacket above while underneath her panties were being pulled tightly between her now expanding buttocks, whose forming shelf was the envy of many women. <br />
<br />
Janice seemed to finally realize that something was happening to her, as she gaped wordlessly at the power outfit she seemed to be wearing now. But before her mind could wrap itself around the concept, it was assaulted by a wave of new memories that blotted out everything else. There were images of an incredibly well built man in most of them, for whom she felt a sudden and powerful attraction to. Her previous desire for women fell away with nary a whisper as she could recall a wedding now, followed by his captivating speeches on the campaign trail. <br />
<br />
Back outside of her mind, Janice was looking around and her gaze settled on a tall and wide figure in the crowd. His well-tailored suit and massive physique made him stand out, but she would&#39;ve known him anywhere. Her feet started to walk her towards him, in process leaving behind a trail of broken laces and torn rubber as her sneakers violently reformed into a pair of tall blue pumps.<br />
<br />
She walked taller now, her posture that of a confident woman. The pops coming from her spine as she gained inches of height were concealed by the clack of her heels. In response to this, her face began change. Her small nose grew more prominent, while her once innocent brown eyes turned an icy blue, narrowing in a calculating fashion. Eyebrows arched thinner as lips plumped with red lipstick. The first signs of her aging appeared around her eyes as crow&#39;s feet. <br />
<br />
As the fading lesbian got closer and closer to that man, her memories of him and their life together got clearer. Much like him, she&#39;d earned numerous degrees and could debate with the best of them. Of course, she&#39;d suborned her own ambitions to his as an true partner and wife would, entering a private law practice as he rose up the political ranks. <br />
<br />
Now her accessories began to settled into place. A black leather purse was slung over her should by a thick golden chain, while a double row of pearls clicked around her neck. Bracelets of gold wrapped around her wrists, while a wedding band that matched his curled into place around her ring finger.<br />
<br />
Just before she reached him, the last trace of Janice disappeared a wave of blonde subsumed her brunette locks, shaping her hair into a stylish bob that allowed her glittering earrings to be seen. After all, Mrs Jacqueline Colyer was quite proud of her looks, despite being in her early fifties. She reached out touch the arm of her husband of many years, Governor Nelson Colyer. <br />
<br />
The kiss they shared was a mirror to the one the Reverend and his wife had on the stage. But such was to be expected, all of them lived according to mandates of the Lord. <br />
<br />
======<br />
<br />
The curse could feel another surge in its power as the two powerful and hyper-conservative men were partnered with appropriate brides.  This allowed it to warp things at the rally, and a bit beyond.<br />
<br />
For no longer was this town in some distant corner of Texas. Instead it was now closer to the epicenter of the curse, albeit in a state that neighbored it. </p>
