<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tricia and Candace were two college dorm mates attending the local university. Today, they’d decided to go clothes shopping. The only problem that they had was that there was really only one clothing shop in town was this one - Mandy’s Miracle Emporium, a store that was seemingly for exhibitionists. <br />
<br />
Well, not exactly. Candice and Tricia just knew that the only people that shopped there were total sluts.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure you don’t just wanna go to the mall? It’s only a half an hour away.” Tricia said.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, a half hour by driving. You know I don’t have any gas in my car and we want as much money to spend on clothes as possible, right? Plus we can just walk here. Besides, looking a little sexy isn’t a crime, especially if we’re gonna pick up some guys tonight.” Candice said.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, alright, I guess you’re right.” Tricia said.<br />
<br />
“I know I’m right! Let’s get some hot outfits!” Candice said, as the two walked into Mandy’s shop.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
After a couple minutes of looking at how everything&#39;s changed, Mandy and Crystal hear the door to the shop open.<br />
<br />
They peek their heads out and look to see who came in, only to see some girls going clothes shopping.<br />
<br />
“Hello! Like, I’m Mandy and this is Crystal. Like, we’ll totes help you with anything you need today!” Mandy said.<br />
<br />
“Yep! Like, want us to take your measurements and stuff?” Crystal said.<br />
<br />
“Um...” Tricia started.<br />
<br />
“Sounds great! I’m Candice and this is Tricia!” Candice said.<br />
<br />
Although both girls noticed the strange pink eyes that Crystal and Mandy had, neither could tell there was anything wrong.<br />
<br />
“Like, okay! I’ll take Trish here!” Mandy said.<br />
<br />
“And, like, I’ll help you Candy!” Crystal said.<br />
<br />
“Okay.” Candice and Tricia said, not even noticing the nicknames Crystal and Mandy gave them.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Candice followed Crystal to the back room, looking at the pink store up and down. For some reason, something seemed off about it, but she couldn’t remember why. She figured she should just listen to the pretty store girl with the black and pink hair.<br />
<br />
Finally, they arrived. Crystal closed the pink curtain to the pink room.<br />
<br />
“Okay, so, like, just strip down to your underwear and we can get started.” Crystal said.<br />
<br />
“Mmmkay. By the way, I love your hair.” Candice said, without a care in the world, taking her top and skirt off.<br />
<br />
“Thanks! So, like, how long have you been together?” Crystal said.<br />
<br />
“Together? Well, we’ve been in college for about a year.” Candice said. Normally, she’d pick up on what Crystal meant by “together” but some of Mandy’s magic permeated throughout the shop.<br />
<br />
“Wow! That’s, like, so cool!” Crystal said.<br />
<br />
“Yeah... yeah I guess... I guess it is.” Candice said. Her head was feeling fuzzy and her eyes had started glossing over when she and Tricia had entered the store. The longer she stayed in there, the worse it got, but she didn’t realize anything was wrong.<br />
<br />
“So... when do we start?” Candice said.<br />
<br />
“Oh, like, we can start whenever!” Crystal said.<br />
<br />
“So... is now okay?” Candice said.<br />
<br />
“Oh, yeah! *giggle* Silly me!” Crystal said. She walked further in the back room, her fat ass swaying back and forth.<br />
<br />
Candice was expecting Crystal to come back with a measuring tape, but instead she had a giant pink wand.<br />
<br />
“Uh, Crystal? What’s that?” Candice said. The fuzzy feeling in her head was getting worse.<br />
<br />
“Oh, this is just like, to show you what you’re gonna look like!” Crystal said.<br />
<br />
“Oh... okay.” Candice said, unable to argue.<br />
<br />
Crystal waved the wand around and Candice’s bra and panties started to change into sexy pink lingerie.<br />
<br />
“Woah! Cool!” Candice said, as it finished. “I think it’s too big, though.” She said, motioning to her tiny breasts in the huge bra.<br />
<br />
“Oh, dang it! I gotta, like, get a smaller size. You just hang tight, Candy, okay?” Crystal said.<br />
<br />
“Okay, sounds good.” Candice said.<br />
<br />
She walked up to look at herself in the huge mirror. “Candy” was ringing through her mind. She still didn’t realize that the nickname was wrong.<br />
<br />
She looked at her glazed over eyes as they started to turn to a bright pink, just like Crystal’s.<br />
<br />
As soon as they finished, mascara appeared on her face, as did pink eyeshadow. She watched in awe as her lips started to puff up dramatically and sparkly pink lipstick appeared on them.<br />
<br />
“Um... Crythtal? Hello?” She said, not used to her huge puffy lips.<br />
<br />
Her hair turned from dark brown to a bright platinum blonde, tying itself into long pigtails.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, another voice rang through her mind.<br />
<br />
“Hang tight, Candy. Hang tight, Candy. Hang tight, Candy.” started echoing through her mind as she stared in the mirror, unable to move or look away. She calmed down. “Hang tight, Candy.” She started softly repeating the phrase to herself, staring at her own bright pink eyes in the mirror. She started to become aroused; her vagina became wetter by the second as her nipples hardened.<br />
<br />
“Candy” kept ringing through her mind as her breasts started to quickly grow and become rounder; sticking up like implants, the fake looking tits grew until they matched the insane size on the lingerie - an L-cup, almost impossible naturally.<br />
<br />
Her waist thinned until it looked like a model’s; her stomach gained a faint six pack as any hair below her neck disappeared completely.<br />
<br />
She began drooling, now simply repeating the name “Candy” - her new name - as her IQ slowly dropped. Her hips began to crack and widen, growing wider than her shoulders by nearly 3 inches on each size. Her rear began to expand next, filling the formerly loose panties and hugging them tight to her skin, matching her cartoonish breasts.<br />
<br />
Finally, little touches began to finish up. Her formerly pale skin began to tan to a rich, healthy looking color. Her nails began to grow out to about an inch - all except her pointer and middle finger nails on her right hand, which were perfectly manicured but short and ready to finger her best friend turned lover. All of them turned a bright, sparkly pink, matching her lipstick.<br />
<br />
Candy stood completely still as she came, continuing her mantra of saying “Candy” over and  over again, the girl cum running down her leg like the drool running down her face.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, she was snapped out of it.<br />
<br />
“Candy, sweetie? Like, you okay?” Crystal said.<br />
<br />
“Oh, like, I feel totally amazing! *giggle*” Candy said.<br />
<br />
“*giggle* Good! You, like, totes came though! Let me, like, wipe it up and you can pick your new outfit.” Crystal said, wiping Candy’s drool and then her cum.<br />
<br />
Candy, now believing that Crystal had gone in the back to get her some sexy outfits, let Crystal wipe up the cum and prepared to put on something sexy.<br />
<br />
“Like, yay! New clothes!” Candy said, looking at the array of new outfits.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Tricia followed Mandy into the other back room, staring at her bright blonde hair.<br />
<br />
“Wow, her hair’s really hot. I bet Candice would look great with that.” She thought to herself. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, her thoughts were interrupted when they reached the back room.<br />
<br />
Mandy pushed Tricia against the wall and began kissing her.<br />
<br />
Tricia didn’t resist as her mind began to change; her eyes glossed over. Her mental transformation had started as soon as they walked in - her eyes had already turned bright pink.<br />
<br />
Tricia’s IQ dropped as Mandy kept kissing the girl, her body changing to look more like Candy’s. Her breasts expanded to the same size, her hips widened, and her ass expanded too. However, her skin remained pale, and instead of pink, all of Trish’s new makeup was a bright, sparkly green, matching her new green lingerie. All of her clothes disappeared except for this new lingerie. Her lips puffed up as Mandy stuck her tongue in Trish’s mouth.<br />
<br />
Trish’s hair became long and swept back, keeping its original black color but gaining bright green highlights. Her hair looked like Crystal’s, with green replacing the pink.<br />
<br />
Mandy pushed the newly transformed Trish onto the couch in the room before bringing going to grab outfits.<br />
<br />
Trish came to as Mandy brought in sexy new clothes.<br />
<br />
“Huh? Like, what happened?” Trish asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh, like, nothing! I totes just went to get some clothes.” Mandy said.<br />
<br />
“Ooo, clothes!” Trish said, jumping up.</p>
