<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Immediately, Ben could feel an intense wave of power and pleasure run through his entire body, as if a kind of pressure was building up inside of him. The pressure kept increasing, mainly in his stomach, and he started to feel incredibly sexy and turned on. He looked down on himself, but at first he couldn't see anything happening. He lifted his t-shirt so that he could check out his stomach, and was a bit disappointed to see that it still looked the same as it had before. Then, however, he noticed a small change and realized that his abs were becoming visible, as a faint outline only at first, but getting more defined by the second.<br />
<br />
Ben gasped as another wave of pleasure washed over him, and the pressure which had built up inside of him shifted to his legs. He gasped as his calves and his quads started to grow, slowly filling out his jeans. Tighter and tighter they got as the muscles inflated with size, going from regular to well-defined in a few seconds and not showing any sign of stopping soon although they were starting to push towards the limits of what Ben's pants could contain. Ben bent down to feel his calves pulsing with growth, stretching the pants tighter and tighter.<br />
<br />
Again, however, the feeling of pressure shifted, this time upwards to Ben's chest. Relishing a third wave of almost orgasmic pleasure, Ben watched his chest pushing outwards, lifting his t-shirt upwards with each beating of Ben's heart, with each rush of blood. While only a few moments ago the t-shirt had hung loose, it was now slowly being filled up with increasing amounts of muscle, and Ben could make out the outline of his pecs through the increasingly tight fabric. The line between the two bulging mounds of muscle on Ben's chest became ever more defined, and, as with his jeans before, Ben could feel the growing strain on the seams.<br />
<br />
Ben was panting heavily by now, extremly aroused by the way he felt both heavier because of the steadily growing amount of muscle on his body, and lighter because of the increasing strength, power and energy that flowed through his entire being.<br />
<br />
As the pressure shifted once again, Ben felt his arms being pushed upwards by his lats, which had begun to unfold like wings of muscle. His back thickened and broadened as Ben packed on pound after pound of muscle, and his shoulders, too, filled up with amazing strength and added to the strain on Ben's already skin-tight t-shirt. <br />
<br />
Ben stood up and roared in triumph as the pressure moved into his arms and his biceps started ballooning upwards. He flexed his left arm, rubbing the growing mound of his biceps with his right hand, loving the feeling of his newly muscular upper arms, of his inflating biceps, a sexy, hard baseball-sized hump after a few seconds, pulsing with muscle and growth. He flexed again, noticing how his forearms and triceps were swelling, too, inflating with ever more strength and muscle.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the pressure increased, spreading over his entire body, and he almost came when he felt his entire frame expanding, packing on more muscle than he could have thought possible. The seams at the side of his jeans started to give way, his calves and quads slowly pushing through the fabric. Ben's t-shirt, too, failed to contain his ballooning body, revealing his pecs, lats and shoulders as they ripped the seams apart.<br />
<br />
Ben stood in front of his computer, his clothes hanging in shreads from his incredibly buffed up body, and touched himself all over, feeling the increasing weight of his muscles, which still didn't show any sign of stopping their amazing growth. He adjusted his stance as his quads pushed against each other, fighting for room which would allow them to grow even more, way beyond anything even the biggest and most ambitious professional bodybuilders would have thought possible. Ben flexed his arms, and his baseball-sized biceps struggled against the inflating muscles of his forearms.<br />
<br />
With another wave of pleasure, by far the most intense, Ben came in his pants (or rather, what was left of them), and the growth finally subsided. Standing in the middle of the room was a 500 pound mountain of pure muscle and raw strength, a man Ben had up to this point been able to see only in his wildest daydreams, an incredebly sexy specimen of pure male power. But not only had this fantasy somehow become real, this erotic-obsession-come-to-life was none other than Ben himself.<br />
<br />
While still absorbing what had just happened, Ben already started to think about what he should do next.</p>
