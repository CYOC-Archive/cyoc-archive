<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam made a beeline for the team’s large orange water cooler that they had at the side of the track.<br />
<br />
“Perfect,” he thought to himself. “The powder’s designed to dissolve in liquid, so they won’t suspect a thing.” <br />
<br />
Checking to ensure that the runners were on the other side of the track, Sam quickly unscrewed the lid of the cooler, dumped the container of powder in, screwed the lid back on, and darted away. Settling in the shadows of the bleachers on the sidelines, Sam sat back to watch the fireworks. And he didn’t have to wait long.<br />
<br />
Only a few laps later, the team came to a stop at the unassuming cooler, athletic chests heaving from exertion. Their words carried over to Sam’s hideout.<br />
<br />
“Damn I’m beat,” panted Chase, an attractive and lean blond with short hair and bright blue eyes. “I could chug that whole cooler right now if I wasn’t dying of hyperventilation.” <br />
<br />
Sam smiled, picturing what would happen if Chase proceeded to do that.<br />
<br />
“You’re telling me,” laughed Liam, a surprisingly buff ginger with a shock of unruly red hair that probably wouldn’t flatten out in a thunderstorm. “I’m probably about to vomit on you.”<br />
<br />
“Please cut the sexy talk you two,” complained the sarcastic but good-natured and incredibly attractive team captain Will, whose stylish brown hair and deep eyes wooed many a hopeful girl in his time at Mellington. <br />
<br />
“What, do you think our girlfriends are going to leave us for you?” poked Liam. “I sure as hell wouldn’t.” Will snorted.<br />
<br />
Sam watched in anticipation as the team passed around cups of water from the tainted cooler. The effect wouldn’t be instantaneous, but it would be noticeable. <br />
<br />
“This water tastes funky,” the muscular Kristian complained with a sour look on his face. “What’d you put in this, chalk?”<br />
<br />
“Ah, don’t worry Kristian,” Chase commented. “It’ll never be as dry as your sex life.” Half the team nearly spit their water out at that comment, trying not to laugh.<br />
<br />
“Oh shut up,” Kristian chuckled.<br />
<br />
The team discarded their cups and started jogging again, making their rounds. After a few laps, Sam began to notice some bulges that didn’t seem as small as they had been before. His powder was working. In the next few minutes, several members of the team stopped to briefly adjust themselves, unconsciously noticing that their crotch seemed heavier than it had been. After a few more laps however, the effect slowed and came to a halt.<br />
<br />
After a few more minutes, the team stopped for another water break. There were definitely some bigger bulges under those singlets. Sam saw Liam grab his bigger dick and try to adjust it as he chatted, as it was now beginning to stick down the side of his spandex-clad leg. And off they went again.<br />
<br />
This time the changes were much more noticeable. Everyone was stopping multiple times to adjust their slowly swelling manhood, and trying not to notice that everyone else was too. Sam could see that not only was everyone’s dick hanging down the side of their leg, but they had become much thicker too. <br />
<br />
He especially enjoyed watching Chase come by every lap. The first lap, Sam could tell that things were getting tight down there. His package was flopping back and forth under the thin singlet much more than usual. The second, Chase stopped to push down his still-larger dick as it was bulging conspicuously in his singlet. It was beginning to look like Chase was hiding a salami in his basket. The third, Chase had clearly begun to notice that something was wrong. He was stealing glances down at his package, and clearly could tell the difference between a modest 5-inch penis and what appeared to be an 8-inch log. At one point, he stopped and leaned against a post and let out a moan before giving a small involuntary thrust of his much larger manhood. The others tried not to notice. Sam was enjoying this.<br />
<br />
At their next water break, Kristian hesitantly put forth a concerned question. “Should we... I don’t know... call practice short or something?” Though none of them would admit it, they all knew exactly why. Though he considered it for a moment, Will was adamant. “No. We’ve got a meet coming up. Anyway, we’re almost done,” he answered nervously.<br />
<br />
Still not knowing the cause of their mysterious growth, the team all drank their water and set out again. This part was fun.<br />
<br />
At this point, it was impossible to hide the enormous packages that each guy was sporting. With every lap, crotches were getting heavier. The tall Kristian was definitely having trouble with his swelling dick and balls, which appeared to be passing 10 inches at this point. White spandex leaves nothing to the imagination, and it appeared that the blond Swede’s bulge was about to tear right out of his singlet. Not that Sam would mind.<br />
<br />
Sam was also enjoying watching Liam’s predicament. The cute ginger’s package had gotten so enormous that he couldn’t run full speed without his nearly foot-long schlong hitting his defined abs. That thing looked heavy. His balls were practically the size of tangerines.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the team came to a final stop. They were all panting and looking around in a mix of wonder and horror at the enormity of their team’s endowments.<br />
<br />
“Well there’s no point in hiding it anymore,” Chase yelled. “Why the fuck are our dicks so damn huge?” He gestured down at what appeared to be a Pringles can shoved down the leg of his singlet. “Last I remember, it wasn’t that big!” Everyone nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
“Same here,” Liam groaned. Sam could see from his vantage point that Liam possibly had the biggest cock out of any of them. It looked nearly a foot long and big enough to tear through his uniform at any moment. “It’s fucking enormous,” Liam blustered.<br />
<br />
Everyone turned to face Will.<br />
<br />
He looked back at them. “Well what the hell am I supposed to do? Mine’s just as big as yours! I don’t know how it happened. I just think we should get out of here.”<br />
<br />
“Agreed,” said nearly everyone.<br />
<br />
“Let’s head to the locker room then,” Will grumbled. “We’ll deal with this later.” The team walked off towards the locker room, enormous packages swinging in their thin track singlets like the pendulums of a grandfather clock.</p>
