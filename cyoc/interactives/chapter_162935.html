<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr. Davidson is sucking your dick and playing with your massive balls. It feels incredible. <br />
<br />
“Stevin,” he moans.<br />
<br />
“Steviiin!” he says again, this time a little louder.<br />
<br />
“STEVIN!” This time a woman’s voice.<br />
<br />
Suddenly you wake up from the best dream you’ve ever had. You mom is calling for you. <br />
<br />
“Stevin!“ she screamed. “Are you awake?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, mom!” you holler back, exasperated that she had woken you up from such an amazing wet dream.<br />
<br />
“We need to evacuate the house! There’s been an explosion in your father’s lab.”<br />
<br />
You come to your senses and shoot out of bed. You pull on a pair of non cum-stained boxer-briefs, jeans, and your favorite Star Wars t-shirt before racing out of the house to join your parents and your sister, Hannah. <br />
<br />
The house seems to be intact, but green fog is billowing out of the basement windows. <br />
<br />
“Sorry guys,” your dad says. “My bad.”<br />
<br />
Your relationship with your dad has gotten much closer since his last experiment. He had figured out a way to reverse the effects but not all the way. Your balls are still pretty large, about the size of baseballs. However, the whole being gay side effect seemed permanent. You still have dreams about having sex with Mr. Davidson.<br />
<br />
“Stay back from the fog, it could have some strange effects,” your dad says. “I must have added too much hydrogen peroxide. Won’t happen again.” <br />
<br />
All four of you very highly doubt that. <br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
As much as you hate to admit it, ever since you’d become gay, your dad’s attractiveness has been catching your attention - a lot more than you’re willing to admit. He has very large muscles and a huge ass. His bulge was also something that you just couldn’t stop yourself from taking glances at.<br />
But today, the day after your dad’s lab exploded, something about him was... different. <br />
<br />
Right then you realized that your dad had been exposed to the green fog. After all, he had been in the lab when the explosion went off. What did he say about it? It could have strange effects? You just can’t figure out what it did to him, but something about his personality seems off.<br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
You notice it almost a week later. You’re sitting at the dinner table with the rest of the family and struggling to choke down your mom’s meatloaf.<br />
<br />
Your dad isn’t using his silverware like the rest of the family. Instead, he’s using a plastic fork. On top of that, his fingernails were getting very long. Something that he was always self-conscious about. Furthermore, his usual thin layer of stubble has grown out to a fairly thick layer of hair. “He hates facial hair,” you think. <br />
<br />
“This is amazing,” your dad says gesturing to the meatloaf, of which he has had four helpings of. <br />
<br />
“You have quite the appetite tonight,” your mom says surprised. <br />
<br />
“Tonight’s a big night,” he responds.<br />
<br />
“Why’s that?” you say. You and Hannah exchange a suspicious glance.<br />
<br />
After a few seconds of musing over the best way to answer, your dad says “I’m getting really close to a breakthrough in my research.” <br />
<br />
He gets up and heads down to his lab, but you’re not satisfied with that answer. <br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
Later that night you come to an epiphany. You’re lying in bed getting ready to jerk off and dream about Mr. Davidson’s huge cock when you get a notification on your phone from the weather app. “Don’t miss tonight’s lunar eclipse!” <br />
<br />
Then it hits you: a lunar eclipse means a full moon. All the puzzle pieces fall into place: the hair, the fingernails, his appetite, his aversion to silverware. The green fog from the lab has turned your dad into a werewolf.<br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
You race down the stairs and bang on your dad’s locked, iron vault door. <br />
<br />
“I’m busy!” you hear from inside the lab. <br />
<br />
“Dad,” you say. “I know.”<br />
<br />
“You know what?”<br />
<br />
“You don’t have to hide it from me.”<br />
<br />
For a few seconds there’s silence. Then there’s the sound of a lock turning and gears revolving. The door opens and a small amount of green fog rolls out.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry,” your dad says. “The fog has lost its abilities.”<br />
<br />
You look up at your father. He’s in his underwear. You two are close but not that close. He’s much hairier than you remember him being before and possibly more muscular. Even the bulge in his underwear seems more prominent. <br />
<br />
“Come on in,” he says as if nothing strange is going on.<br />
<br />
You glance at an old clock on the wall. It’s almost 11:45.<br />
<br />
“Are you going to become, like, hostile?” you ask.<br />
<br />
“No son,” he replies. “At least I don’t think so. I’ve run many tests in the last week. I’ve gained lots of hair and muscle and even my package down there has grown in size. <br />
<br />
“That didn’t really answer my question.”<br />
<br />
“Just don’t worry about it. Now close the door. We can’t have your mom and sister finding out about this.”<br />
<br />
You do as you were told then find a comfy place to sit, which is difficult. The lab is a mess. Graduated cylinders, vials of white liquid, and dozens of tubes lay everywhere. The place smells like a men’s locker room and the only light comes from a single, swinging lightbulb attached to a long cord in the ceiling. <br />
<br />
You finally find an old, wobbly stool to sit on just as the clock strikes 12:00. <br />
<br />
A moan erupts out of your father as the changes begin. More fur grows out of his already hirsute body. His biceps, thighs, and calves swell and expand. Pecs and abs start to form, however they’re soon covered by hair. His nose and mouth elongate into a snout and his ears are stretched backwards into points. His fingers and toes turn into stubs and quickly became paws with sharp claws. His canine teeth grow taller into fangs.<br />
<br />
What used to be a pair of white briefs lay on the floor in ruin. In its place is a massive uncut cock and huge hairy balls even bigger than yours.<br />
<br />
The weird thing is that he wasn’t on all fours like the werewolves in moves. He still stood on two legs. Without the fangs, claws, ears, and snout he could probably pass as a really hair man. <br />
<br />
The entire time your dad has been moaning. “It must feel incredible,” you think. “I wish I could look and feel like that.”<br />
<br />
The transformation comes to a close with an ear splitting howl and a load of cum on the basement floor. <br />
<br />
To your surprise, your father grabs a vial from his desk and begins to pick up the cum. Then you realize what all the vials of white liquid are.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing with all that sperm,?” you ask.<br />
<br />
Remarkably, your dad can still speak English. “I want to compare my human sperm to my werewolf sperm. If I can find any anomalies in the DNA, I might be able to reverse the werewolf effects. <br />
<br />
“But don’t you enjoy it?” you ask, clearly envious of your father. “Doesn’t it feel good?”<br />
<br />
“I’m not gonna lie,” he responds. “That was the best orgasm I’ve ever had, but no. I’ve done my research. According to old legend, the chemicals I accidentally mixed are permanent. Being a werewolf feels great, but I fear these claws will make it hard to be a scientist.” <br />
<br />
Understanding the problem at hand, you rush over and help him load his sperm into a vial. Never before has your relationship with your father been this close. <br />
<br />
Your dad hits a few switches and turns a couple dials. Machines begin to come to life and the cum travels through tubes and into a huge machine. <br />
<br />
“It’ll take a couple hours before it’s processed,” he says. “But for now, let’s have a little fun with this new body of mine.” <br />
<br />
You take a step back when you realize what is about to happen. You are about to have sex with your werewolf father. <br />
<br />
You’re terrified at the thought of it, but you can’t deny the truth. Your dad is even hotter than Mr. Davidson, and your dick has been hard since midnight.</p>
