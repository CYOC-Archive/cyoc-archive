<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next few days were uneventful. Tex kept pestering him. RK would stop by occasionally for some…sitting lessons. Troy spent most of his time sorting out the messes he could while handing the Book off to Rusty to try to fix the ones he couldn’t.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, most of the product line-er, people- were already reality shifted and mostly beyond recovery, as Troy and Rusty couldn’t figure out their real identities. If they wanted to fix things, they needed the Book of Arcane’s Dispel Magic spell.<br />
<br />
Tex had been pestering him now, constantly. When he was returned to human form, he’d completely broken down mentally. The realization of what Sam was and his manipulations had hurt him deeply. Troy was sympathetic, but he was now questioning his choices. If he altered Tex, how would Paradox react? Sam had gotten away with all his crazy shit because his Auditor let him and refused to enforce reality unless it had benefited him. Troy’s Auditor, on the other hand, hated him.<br />
<br />
He needed a vacation from this place. Clint wasn’t speaking with them, other neighbors shunning them. It was quite obvious they were being ostracized. He’d started packing this morning when he’d received a phone call. His flight would leave by the end of the week.<br />
<br />
And now RK and Rusty were confronting him about it.<br />
<br />
“You actually did it?” RK demanded.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I’d started planning before we even talked.” Troy shrugged.<br />
<br />
“What about me?” Rusty demanded.<br />
<br />
“You guys are coming with. Start packing.” <br />
<br />
“Wait wait wait, no.” Rusty held up a hand. “Where did you even get the money for it? We’ve spent all the money from the sex shop fixing the city and bribing people.”<br />
<br />
“Well, since you guys have been taking the Book to fix things, I’ve been making a few moves of my own.” Troy said. “I got a business lawyer to help me with setting up that sex toy line properly, got an accountant. We even have factories open right here in America-well, just one, aside from the warehouse. I’m calling it the secret lab. Keeping it mysterious. Anyways, I know we need more money if we’re going to get this guy Sebastian’s attention so I started money laundering.”<br />
<br />
“Sebsatian?!” RK shouted at the same time Rusty said, “Money laundering?!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah and yeah.” Troy shrugged.<br />
<br />
“How much?” Rusty demanded. “How much funny money did you mint?”<br />
<br />
Troy sighed. “Look, I know I’m not supposed to destabilize US currency, that’s the job of an unelected group of banking industry titans who can’t and won’t be held accountable for anything they do, but I just, you know, decided it was in my best interests to do so.”<br />
<br />
“How the hell did you even figure out how to launder money?” RK asked.<br />
<br />
“I was re-watching Cracking Mad and the sleazy lawyer explained it to an idiot.”<br />
<br />
“Makes sense.” RK nodded.<br />
<br />
“Doesn’t matter.” Rusty said. “You cannot fly out to LA on a commercial airline. Who knows what might happen.”<br />
<br />
“It’s a good thing I’m not flying commercial.” Troy smirked. “Sebastian is sending me his personal private jet.”<br />
<br />
Rusty shook his head. “RK? This is stupid, right?”<br />
<br />
RK shrugged. “I don’t know.”<br />
<br />
Rusty blinked. “What do you mean? You can see the future, right?”<br />
<br />
“Not anymore. Las Vegas was a trap after all. Time’s fucking with my future sight now.” RK sighed. “He’d only do that if he wanted to scare us off course. Troy might be right. This might be the best shot we have at winning.”<br />
<br />
“The heaviest hitters who always win? Taking them down is our best shot?” Rusty demanded.<br />
<br />
“It might be. Rusty, I think Time is the one who always wins. He’s smart.” RK frowned. “I can’t do anything now that he’s timeline jumping. It’s literally pure chance now.”<br />
<br />
“A guy from Vegas who likes to gamble.” Troy shrugged. “Makes sense when you think about it.”<br />
<br />
Rusty huffed. “Fine. I don’t like it. Also, Troy, Tex wants to see you. For the thing.”<br />
<br />
Troy sighed. “Okay. When do we leave?”<br />
<br />
“Lenny’s taking you.” Rusty said.<br />
<br />
“Lenny?” Troy stared.<br />
<br />
Rusty didn’t look at him. “I’m busy. He’s outside.”<br />
<br />
Troy cautiously left the house. Lenny&#39;s squad car was parked outside their house. He waved, but Lenny didn&#39;t respond. Lenny was staring straight ahead.<br />
<br />
“Uh, hi.” Tory said as he got in and strapped his seatbelt into place.<br />
<br />
The big ursine grunted and started the car, pulling out of the cul-de-sac towards the warehouse.<br />
<br />
Troy had figured out he was upset about something. He sat silently and uncomfortably as the silence stretched. He shifted in his seat.<br />
<br />
“Rusty told me about the Book.” Lenny finally spoke.<br />
<br />
Troy swallowed and stared out the window. “Yeah?”<br />
<br />
The ride was silent for a few more minutes.<br />
<br />
“Did you make me gay, Troy?” Lenny asked.<br />
<br />
“...Accidentally. That was Rusty, actually.” Troy shrugged, not looking at Lenny, “Reality Auditors almost fucked us all.”<br />
<br />
“Did my wife love me?” Lenny asked.<br />
<br />
“...Yes.” Troy shut his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Because she doesn’t, now. I think she’s talking to a lawyer.” Lenny’s claws gripped the steering wheel. “Was it worth the fuck?”<br />
<br />
Troy shook his head. “I didn’t know it would hit you, man.”<br />
<br />
“It did. Troy. You used that Book. Now look at you. You’re a slutty stoner.” Lenny growled.<br />
<br />
“I was straight.” <br />
<br />
“That’s not a fucking apology Troy!” Lenny roared. “’Uh, duh, I didn’t know!’ ‘Sorry I ruined your life because I wanted to suck bear dick!’ Got any other fucking excuses?! Do you?!”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry.” Troy whispered.<br />
<br />
“That’s not fucking enough!” Lenny growled. “Fix me!”<br />
<br />
“I can’t.” Troy cried. “You’ll end up a fat nerdy pig and you won’t even have a family!”<br />
<br />
Lenny growled.<br />
<br />
“I’m not lying! I would fix it!” Troy protested. “I’m trying to fix everyone but it got out of hand before Rusty and I realized it.”<br />
<br />
“Why won’t you just destroy it?” Lenny demanded.<br />
<br />
“It will just pop up again in someone else’s hands somewhere in the US.” Troy said. “You’d be trading one owner who fucked up and realizes that and wants to fix it with an unknown. But look, there’s still hope.”<br />
<br />
Lenny grunted.<br />
<br />
“Book of Arcane can undo everything.” Troy said.<br />
<br />
“Another Book? Really?” Lenny growled. “Have you been paying attention to anything I’ve said?<br />
<br />
“Oh, I’m sorry, are you rejecting the only way to undo things?” Troy huffed, becoming angry now and trying not to cry.<br />
<br />
Lenny pulled up to the warehouse. “Get out. And when you can, I want you to leave town. Don’t bring this shit near my family.”<br />
<br />
Rusty walked to the warehouse, feeling hot tears trickle down his face. The squad car pulled away. Rusty didn’t look back. He really had fucked up, Lenny wasn’t wrong.<br />
<br />
Troy went to light up a doobie and stared at it. He tossed it on the ground and crushed it underfoot. He needed to feel this. He wasn’t going to let it stop him from trying to make things right.<br />
<br />
He took a deep breath and opened the warehouse door.</p>
