<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tyler screamed in terror as the Chronivac beeped in a pleasant voice; &quot;Permanent change initiated. Subject Tyler. Transformation selected; Subject Zach&#39;s right armpit. Have a nice day&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no... Anything but that!&quot; Tyler muttered to himself. He frantically hammered on the key board, desperate to prevent the changes. His body was starting to have a strange tingling sensation. No matter what, he couldn&#39;t stop the chronivac. He kept getting error message after error message. He broke out in a sweat. He noticed that he, his sweat.... oh god, it reeked like dirty armpit! His roommate Zach&#39;s body odor! He had to act fast. Maybe if he was far enough away from the infernal machine, he could get away!<br />
<br />
<br />
He opened his bedroom door, ready to run out of the apartment and as far away, as fast as he can. He gasped as he saw Zach standing right in front of his doorway, blocking his escape. Zach stared off into space as if he was in a trance.  The muscular meathead jock was standing there just in his too small boxers.His muscular right arm was raised to the sky, showing off the musky bush under his arm. <br />
<br />
<br />
As Zach stood there in a trance, Tyler thought he could run between him and the door and escape. However, his eyes locked onto his roommates exposed pit. Just then, he too became stuck as if in a trance. Oh fuck, he couldn&#39;t move!<br />
<br />
<br />
He slowly began movie closer and closer. Oh fuck, no, it&#39;s happening! He shuffled forward against his will. Fuck this was a nightmare. Zach was so gross! his pits were always so sweaty and hairy, and he stunk! Was this his fate, to turn into his roommate&#39;s nasty armpit? What a humiliating end!<br />
<br />
<br />
Tyler began to sweat more and the stink he was producing was getting greater. He was really starting to smell like BO now. &quot;Better get used to it&quot;, h thought to himself with deep disgust and sorry. Tyler&#39;s face was soon inches away from Zach&#39;s pit. Zach was still in the trance and didn&#39;t notice anything. Tyler felt his body getting lighter and lighter, almost like he was getting sucked out of his clothes. His soul and essence were begin sucked out of his diminishing body. He felt his entire being shoved into a sweaty, warm, musky prison. Pretty soon he didn&#39;t feel anything of his old body. All he felt was scratchy hair and moist sweat. Somehow he could still see, albeit his view was totally blocked by the thick bush that grew out of his pit body now. Fuck it stunk so bad! On top of that, he could even taste! It tasted like old rancid sweat. This was hell! If he had tear ducts, he would be sobbing and sobbing at his unimaginable fate. To add insult to injury, he found he had something similar to tearducts. The overactive sweatglands all over his new body began to drip out more stinky, nasty sweat. This was disgusting. The sweat collected all over what felt like his face, and dribbled all over the thick armpit hair that sprouted all over his new body. He was in hell!<br />
<br />
<br />
Tyler tried to move anything at all, any muscle, but it was to no avail. He was absolutely trapped in this inanimate prison... forever! All he was was his roommates armpit. If he could just move! He struggled and struggled, and nothing! He wanted to scream! By now, the smell was really getting to him. It was so bad, and just getting worse. Would this be all he would ever smell for the rest of his existence? Zach&#39;s BO? Fuck!!! With even more embarassment, he realized it wasn&#39;t Zach&#39;s BO, it was his BO. It was technically coming from his body, now. Uggh!<br />
<br />
<br />
Just then, Zach broke out of his trance. He looked at his pit, which was itchy. He scratched it, rubbing the thick pit hairs all over Tyler&#39;s face. This just smeared the sweat and smell even deeper. Kill me, Tyler begged in his mind. <br />
<br />
<br />
Zach sniffed his fingers and grimaced as he lowered his arm. Tyler was trapped in a dark, humid, hairy prison with his arm lowered. He couldn&#39;t see anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh&quot;, Zach muttered as he saw the empty pile of Tyler&#39;s clothes on the floor in front of him. &quot;I wonder where my dweeb roommate is&quot;, he said as he walked off, totally unaware that his roommate was in fact trapped in a permanent hairy, stinky hell right under his arm. As Zach walked away, Tyler screamed and screamed and screamed in his head...</p>
