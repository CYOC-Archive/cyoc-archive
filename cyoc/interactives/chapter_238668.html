<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Obviously, someone can’t keep acting like Jenny was without any consequences. She was getting in trouble all the time and no one could stop her. She started laying off Jeff, because every time she tried to make fun of him, she wound up getting raped. That didn’t stop her from going after other guys though. Some folks like ‘Big-hugs Bill’ would just ignore her, but other guys started getting riled up by her taunts.<br />
<br />
All it took was one incident. Jeff never got to see it, but learned through the grape vine that Jenny was causing trouble for the football team after practice. She had snuck into their locker-room and was messing with their clothes when the team walked in on her. One thing led to another and she was gang raped by the whole team. No one looked at her the same after that. To most of the girls, she was a whore. To most of the boys she was a slut. And the fact that she seemed to be begging guys to fuck her wasn’t doing any favors.<br />
<br />
Jeff heard from some of his friends that Jenny started Free blowjob Friday, where her throat was for public used every week. Not only that, she had been riding almost every dick in the school. When he passed by her, he noticed she had some new bruises on her and reeked of fish. That was when Jeff had enough. He and Jenny never really broke up, but he knew he needed to confront her. He had the Chronivac on his laptop at school, so he could fix her once and for all.<br />
<br />
When he approached Jenny, he asked how her week had gone. She made a cold expression and blew him off. Jeff tried to explain that what he did was fun but this needed to stop. Jenny didn’t even let him finish his speech, “Jeff, give it up! You don’t like your girlfriend getting raped, big whoop. Your machine made me like that stuff, now deal with it like a man. How about you go hook up with someone else, if you haven’t noticed, I don’t really care about cheating. Why don’t you hook up with that bitch Mara. I’m sure she would love all your romance stuff, but never even suggest making me the prissy little shit I was before.”<br />
<br />
Jenny left him to steep alone. Jeff felt a little heartbroken that she didn’t want to come back, but he figured he just needed to fix her mind, and everything would go back to normal. But before he could start fixing her mind, Jeff thought about what she said, about Mara.<br />
<br />
Jeff knew Mara from Jenny’s countless rants. She was the captain of Jenny’s cheer squad, and her fiercest rival. The irony, of course, was that Jenny and Mara were normally practically the same person, save for Mara’s blonde hair. Both were some of the nicest people he knew, and always kept the mood light when anyone was around, except each other. For whatever reason, Jenny and Mara were always at each other’s throats. When he asked Jenny why, she just said, “She knows what she did.” After some poking around, he learned it had something to do with sitting on an egg. That was all Jeff needed to know to understand it really was some bullshit.<br />
<br />
Jeff always felt bad for Mara though, she was a really sweet girl, but her boyfriend was the worst. He had dropped out of high school several years back because of his anger issues. She insisted he had a good heart, but the bruises on her arms said otherwise. Still, no one could talk her down, no matter how much pain he put her through.<br />
<br />
But that made him think, if he really could treat her so much better, why not skip all the work of psychological treatment and jump straight to the grand finale. He already had his laptop out, so why not try it. He replaced the names on both sides with Jenny and Mara’s, then he input ‘Relationship with Jeff’ on both sides, and pressed swap. Just afterwards, he input ‘Relationship with Randy’ on both sides, and pressed swap. And one final time, he typed Randy’s name on both sides. On the left he input ‘Relationship with Jenny’, then in the right box input ‘Relationship with Mara’ and pressed swap.<br />
<br />
The next few days were pretty confusing. In the eyes of their friends and family, Jenny, Mara and Jeff seemed to completely change. But one thing was certain, Jenny and Jeff were thru, and Mara and Jeff were together. In fact, Mara seemed to fill the void Jenny left behind fairly well, having roughly the same mental state she had before Jeff first changed Jenny. It was hard to explain how, practically overnight, Jenny’s personality completely flipped on its head, and how Mara seemed to finally ditch her awful boyfriend.<br />
<br />
Little did they know, Jenny had a wild few days. It started with her remembering Mara’s boyfriend, and how awful he was, but more importantly how he would be perfect for her in her new body. She did the only logical thing and headed for Randy’s place. She knocked on his door in anticipation, and when they locked eyes, she felt the same need that Mara used to have for his affection, but in her own weird twisted way. She didn’t want him to be her boyfriend. She wanted him to be her rapist.<br />
<br />
It only took a few taunts. A couple mentions about him being a failure, a few mentions of his mom, and she had him riled up. It didn’t help that she almost forced her way into his house. With no one watching what he was doing, Randy saw her as the perfect target to take his frustration out on. It started with a square punch to the eye, followed by a whack to side. Once she was on the ground, Jenny’s plan really went into action. She made sure to fall in a way that she landed with her ass in the air and her skirt exposing her rear. Then she heard Randy say, “You come into MY house! Trash talk MY family! Call out MY girlfriend! Then you have the gall to shove that fine ass in my face. Oh no you don’t.” That was all before he shoved his cock in her ass. It wasn’t as long as Jeff’s but it was fatter, which was perfect for her. He went to town on her, and left her slumped at his doorstep for a little while, as he went to go grab another beer and pass out.<br />
<br />
She let Randy’s cum spill out her ass. She quivered in excitement. Randy was all that she hoped for, and was the perfect guy to cuck Jeff with. She admired how heart broken he would be when he found out that Randy had his way with her, and he wasn’t even allowed to watch. She chuckled to herself at how hilarious that would be.<br />
<br />
Jeff never got to talk to Jenny again after that. A few days later, she just dropped out of school. After all the hell she had put the staff and students through, they were just happy she was gone. Jeff didn’t bother to check in on her. In fact, he hardly thought of Jenny at all, when Mara filled the void so perfectly. But little did he know, Jenny was keeping her hatred alive. She continued her affair with Randy as her own personal way of taking little jabs at Jeff.<br />
<br />
Jenny and Randy never picked up on Jeff’s changes. Randy was too hammered to notice that she had completely moved in with him. To him, she was just some other girl that he took his rage out on, but she seemed to really be into his beating.<br />
<br />
Jenny would constantly taunt and tease him in his own home. He never asked her out, but after Mara left him, he just assumed he picked Jenny up at some random bar. But he loved having her around. She was like his personal free use fuck doll, all day every day. It didn’t help that she would walk around his house in nothing but an apron. That became her new fashion sense. Her other clothes were still to bland for her, so she opted for nothing but the bare necessity. More importantly, it left her ass open for Randy to take at any time of the day.<br />
<br />
But what she loved most of all, was deliberately baiting him. She mostly acted rude around him, and would go through her whole bullying routine just to get him angry. And when he reached his limit, he would wail on her with slaps and punches before inevitably pinning her down and fucking her hard. Her eyes were almost constantly blackened, and her lips busted. If anyone outside saw her, they might think she was in an abusive relationship. But she was so mean and rude to everyone around her that no one even bothered checking in.<br />
<br />
Jenny was in a frustrating position. After living with Randy for a while, she wanted to take things to another level. There was one thing she could do that she was certain would make Jeff angrier than ever before. If she got pregnant.<br />
<br />
At night, while Randy was sleeping, she would search the internet for ways to get pregnant without vaginal sex. After all, normal sex was incredibly painful for her. That was the ultimate way she could get at Jeff, her one way arch-nemesis.<br />
<br />
Jeff cuddled with Mara on his bed, she had been staying over more and more often. With Jenny out of the picture, he had a free pass for all the good times he could muster with Mara. And Mara really was an angle. She really was the kindest person around. It figures that she was. It would take someone with the patience of a saint to deal with Randy. But that also made him more gentle. Jeff felt like he needed to be more delicate with her, because she wouldn’t stop him if he was treating her poorly.<br />
<br />
In a strange twist of irony, he became a better person because of her. But, being a better person came with its own form of guilt. He really did trap Jenny in a place that puts her in mortal danger. He could talk himself in circles all day long, but he knew he had to do something to save her.<br />
<br />
He debated telling Mara about the Chronivac. She was his girlfriend now, so why not? But what would she think if she learned about Jenny. What if she had some dark side to her that he hadn’t seen yet. Jeff figured he might want to try fixing Jenny first instead. Maybe he could find a way to keep Jenny and Mara both as his girlfriends.</p>
