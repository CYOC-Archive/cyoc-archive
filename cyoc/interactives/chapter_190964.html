<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the event in the beach, Maria felt absolutely humiliated, but she also came to an important realization.<br />
She missed the comfort of walking without heels.<br />
After two months of nearly constantly walking on heels, her feet were left injured and painful, the flip flops feeling like a great relief. She had to spend more time without elevated shoes.<br />
<br />
But that also meant that she will have to face Erika with a greater height difference towering over her like she did at the beach… and when she grows even more, with an even greater height difference…<br />
<br />
After a lot of consideration, Maria came to the decision. She’ll only use her heels when going outside with Erika or when people visit them. It would mean that she would have to suffer additional teasing from her younger sibling, but at least reduce the gap when they are with others outside of their nuclear family. And either way, the height difference the heels reduce gets filled back within less of a month…<br />
<br />
When Erika saw Maria walking around home barefoot, she quickly took notice, and approached her. A part of her wanted to abuse it, but another was also curious about what happened, if not slightly worried.<br />
<br />
“Hey sis, anything wrong? Why aren’t you wearing your heels?” She asked<br />
<br />
Maria was in slight shock to see her towering sister again, but she quickly got ahold of herself and replied.<br />
“I came to the conclusion that wearing them so much was killing my feet. I had to give them some rest” She said.<br />
Looking up so high at Erika’s face, a part of Maria regretted the choice, but she knew she had to do it.<br />
<br />
Erika loved it. Maria using her heels less meant that she could tease her with their true height difference a lot more easily.<br />
But a part of her was also glad about it for Maria.<br />
<br />
While she loved teasing her older sister, arguably even tormenting her, but after seeing her in those painful shoes for two months, she worried that her feet would be ruined, and gained a bit of guilt.<br />
The fact Maria planned to use her heels less frequently reduced Erika’s guilt on that topic.<br />
<br />
“I’m happy that you care about your health, sis” Erika said in a genuine tone.<br />
But as Maria turned around, she felt herself getting pulled back into a hug.<br />
<br />
Erika had her huge breasts pushed up against the Maria’s neck and the top of her back, and she rested her chin on top of her head.<br />
<br />
“And besides” She added with a smile on her face. “This means that I can now use you as head rest”<br />
<br />
<br />
A few days have passed, and Erika called her father. “Dad, you have to come to see this!”<br />
As Erika’s father went upstairs to his daughter, he saw her standing straight in the doorway, the top of her head touching the frame<br />
I’m 6’8 now, dad, as tall as the doorway!” She said in pride, as she stood four inches above her father. “So I’m just warning you that you may hear more bumps now when I walk around the house.” She continued in a joking manner.<br />
<br />
“But I also need to ask you for something” she added, while going to her room to grab something.<br />
As she returned, Erika’s father saw her wearing his flip flops, while her feet went over the edge.<br />
“I need my own footwear. Yours is too small for me now.”<br />
“So you’ll have to go with your mom back to the stores…” her father replied<br />
“No” she said. “I’m way too big for the shoes they sell there by now. We’ll have to make a special order.”<br />
<br />
Erika’s father knew it was inevitable, but he hoped the moment would come as late as possible.<br />
“I see…” he said. “I’ll have to help you buy them then…”<br />
And so, Erika ordered her first custom sized footwear. Due to the time required to make and ship it, she ordered ones that would be too big for her now, but that she should grow into by the time they would come.<br />
<br />
<br />
More days have went, and as Erika grew taller than the doorway, bumps were heard when she forgot to bend down while walking through the house. But she didn’t hate it. She loved how it represented how big she became, that a basic household structure was now unfit for her.<br />
<br />
<br />
A week and a bit later, and as Maria was sitting in her room, she heard a knock on the door.<br />
“Maria! I have to show you something!” She heard Erika say from behind.<br />
And as Maria opened to door, she faced her statuesque sibling, the top of whom’s head was hidden behind the doorframe.<br />
<br />
“Maria! You are 5’10, right?” Erika asked<br />
“Yes…” Her older sister replied hesitantly.<br />
“Well, I am now officially a foot taller than you are!” The younger sibling replied with pride.<br />
<br />
Maria knew it was only a matter of time, but she was still shocked. Her little sister now towered over her by a foot. The top of her titanic breasts, far bigger than hers, were at level with her lower face.<br />
And her body was so much hotter, with a lean yet curvaceous figure, extremely long legs and a bountiful ass.<br />
Maria really felt like a kid next to her sister by now…<br />
<br />
<br />
As a month has passed since the beach incident, the family was having dinner together, and after they finished, Erika had an announcement to make.<br />
“Everyone, I have an announcement to make!” She said. “But I need everyone to stand up for it”<br />
<br />
Erika’s parents and Maria stood up, hesitantly as they knew that the youngest member of the family was going to tell them about a height related milestone. And since Maria knew that her sister’s last milestone was 6’10, she knew and dreaded what was about to come.<br />
<br />
After the rest stood up, Erika followed.<br />
She stood up, and up, and up… until she dwarfed her family members.<br />
She had well over half a foot over her father, and well over a foot over her mother and sister.<br />
She was so tall, that the 5’10 Maria and her 5’8 mother were both eye level with Erika’s titanic breasts.<br />
<br />
“So…” Erika continued. “I measured myself this morning, and I reached seven feet in height!” She beamed in excitement.<br />
<br />
“Erika, this isn’t normal” her mother said. “You are far too tall by any human standard, let alone someone your age”<br />
<br />
“That’s true” Erika replied with a huge smile on her face. “It isn’t normal for a girl younger than twelve to among the three thousand tallest people in the world” she said while moving her legs, each over four feet long.<br />
“Or do you also want to want to talk about how my face looks like an 18 year old’s or how I perfectly fit the G cup bra I bought yesterday?” She added<br />
<br />
“Yes Erika, this is very wrong” her mother said. “We have to find a way to stop it”<br />
“Wait!” She suddenly realized. “You bought a bra alone yesterday, without me and dad’s permission?”<br />
“Yes mom, the flip flops I ordered came yesterday, so I decided to put them to use and buy other things I needed” the daughter replied.<br />
<br />
“Erika! You can’t just go shopping alone. You aren’t even twelve! What if you ran into someone dangerous?”<br />
<br />
“Yes mom, I was born less than 12 years ago, but you need to remember some things” Erika said as she bent down drastically forwards, putting her face in front of her mother’s, who backed off a bit.<br />
“First, I’ll remind you that I don’t only look 18, but that I was also proven to be very mentally developed for my age” she said. “I’m not like like an innocent little girl who can be easily taken advantage of”<br />
“And I’ll mention again” Erika continued as she stood back straight again, making her mother look straight into her enormous breasts. “I’m 7 feet tall, so It’s not like I can be easily overpowered like the average person”<br />
“So mom, don’t you think it’s fine to me to act independently?”<br />
<br />
Erika’s mother was shocked. Her young daughter fought to act independently like an adult. And the worst thing is, that she had a point.<br />
<br />
“Still, Erika, this just shows again the problem.” She said<br />
<br />
“What problem exactly?” Erika replied with a smile.<br />
“The doctors didn’t find any health problems, despite what’s expected for my growth.”<br />
“And I enjoy my puberty. Don’t you want your daughter to be happy?”<br />
<br />
“Perhaps you, dad and Maria the one who doesn’t want me to grow?” She said while turning her head around to see the rest of her family, before returning to her mother.<br />
“Maybe you and dad don’t want to constantly spend money on my clothes, despite our family being wealthy for that”<br />
<br />
“Or maybe…” Erika continued while bending forward, putting her vast cleavage right in front of her mother’s face. “you three are just too scared of my growth? That I’m already the biggest and hottest person in the house, and you’re scared about me becoming even bigger? That your little girl is going to get even more out of control?”<br />
“Because if so, I’m sorry to to tell you mom, but your amazonian daughter is going to get even bigger and hotter, and if she wanted to get out of her parents’ control, she could have easily done so”<br />
<br />
Erika emphasized it with a slight shake, making her breasts giggle in front of her mother’s face.<br />
“So let’s be thankful that this daughter isn’t acting out of control, and instead just more independent and mature, shall we?”<br />
<br />
Erika’s mother was left speechless, as her daughter left to go upstairs.<br />
<br />
<br />
The next day, Erika went to her mother again, and in a much friendlier tone, asked if they could possibly order specially made shoes for when she’ll outgrow her current ones.<br />
This time, her mother agreed without arguing, not wanting to get to another argument with her giant daughter.</p>
