<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Things have been tense between the United States and Russia recently. While not to the same extent as the Cold War, Americans were less trustful of Russians. There have plenty of incidents where Russia has tried to interfere with American politics. There was no way to be sure how far up it went, even putting the current president in the White House.<br />
<br />
Though the distrust was towards the Russian government, not the people of Russia themselves. If anything, the people of Russia are being more harassed than America. While communism was gone, there were still plenty of people in the government who abuse their power. So the people of Russia were no better off in the current state. One such example was Elizaveta Nozdrin, though most people called her Elly. She came from a middle-class family that were comfortable, but not well-off. As such, they couldn&#39;t afford to pay for Elly&#39;s particular medical treatment.<br />
<br />
Elly had a pituitary tumor. It was mercifully benign, but the hormones it caused her to produce caused two very noticeable conditions. One was gigantism, which made her much larger than kids her age. She was just shy of 16 and yet she was already taller than both her parents. Another problem was a condition called Aromatase excess syndrome, which essentially gave her too much estrogen. The most notable effect it had on her was giving her very, very large breasts, even compared to her taller size. As such, Elly was often the target of much ridicule among kids back home.<br />
<br />
Though the tumor was currently benign, such things could potentially be a ticking time bomb so her parents were anxious about getting it removed. Unfortunately, the surgery would require a lot more money than their medical insurance could cover, and it couldn&#39;t cover for much of anything either. But an opportunity presented itself when a student exchange program opened up, one that could let Elly go to America. More specifically, to Lyre, Nevada. Elly&#39;s parents seized the opportunity as soon as they could.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, diplomatic relations were able to get them in touch with Horizon Labs and the scientists were interested in Elly&#39;s case. It would be enough for them to foot the bill for her conversion and ensure her healthy return. As such, Elly&#39;s parents were more than a little teary-eyed when they saw Elly off at the airport. While they were joyful that their daughter would be saved, they were also aware this was the last time they&#39;d see her as a human.<br />
<br />
===========<br />
<br />
Before Horizon Labs proceeded with the conversion, they wanted to run a few quick tests on Elly&#39;s condition. There was a theory that Aromatase excess syndrome could be related to Regressive Hybersexuality syndrome and explain the surge in libido for regressing women. While they went over the tests, they thought it would be good for Elly to talk with some people who knew what she was going through.<br />
<br />
Elly herself was pretty easy to pick out of a crowd, being over six feet tall and having breasts the size of her head. It was the relatively young look of her face that was a little off-putting. Though she still looked normal compared to the two people talking with her. Lenny, being a giant mouse Animalian, was head and shoulders taller than the rest of his type. And it was impossible to not notice a <i>Brachiosaurus</i> Dinotopian like Jen. The two of them took up pretty much half the room on their own.<br />
<br />
Elly brushed her short blonde hair from her eyes and asked, &quot;So, you two vere alvays so big?&quot; Her Russian accent was particularly thick as she didn&#39;t have a complete grasp of English yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was, yes,&quot; said Lenny, &quot;I was born big and I got bigger. I got too big for my bones and heart. So I came to Animalia so they can help me before I got too bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You vanted to be be mousey,&quot; said Elly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like mice,&quot; said Lenny, &quot;Mice are small, gentle creatures. I didn&#39;t need to be more of a hulking brute than I already was. Besides, I found someone to love as a mouse.&quot; He and Milly had gotten very close over the last year. Recently, he had been seriously thinking about popping the question to Milly. She was technically underage, but she was legally an adult and Lenny didn&#39;t want to wait two decades to ask. He just need to find the right time and place to do it.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least you didn&#39;t have to practically use a wheelbarrow to get around,&quot; said Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t say why I would need one,&quot; said Lenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you men don&#39;t grow huge breasts like us,&quot; said Jen. She turned to Elly and said, &quot;I was even bigger than you <i>before</i> I converted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How big vere you?&quot; asked Elly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, about beach ball size,&quot; said Jen, &quot;Which is already oversized even if you were a small Japanese girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I not know Japanese girls get the big breasts,&quot; said Elly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s rare, but it happens,&quot; said Jen, &quot;My grandmother thought I was cursed by a cow demon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And now you have become big dinosaur,&quot; said Elly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It helped me get a body that can handle all of this,&quot; said Jen, patting the top of her breasts, &quot;And like Lenny, I found someone to love as a dinosaur.&quot; She and Andrew had been bonding a lot, not just for being <i>Brachiosaurus</i>. She had a feeling he was wanting to propose, but some Dinotopians couples seemed to be waiting for Dinosaur City to be completed before they tied the knot. Jen could certainly understand that. Marriage would be a lot easier in a house they could both fit in.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, do you know what you want to change into?&quot; asked Lenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. I vill pick the rhinoceros,&quot; said Elly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, Elly, you don&#39;t have to stick to stereotypes,&quot; said Lenny.<br />
<br />
Elly gave him a confused look and asked, &quot;Vhat you mean &#39;stereotype&#39;?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there are a lot of rhino-based characters in cartoons and comics who are Russian so you don&#39;t have to feel obligated to become one,&quot; said Lenny, &quot;I mean, I&#39;m not an elephant and Jen&#39;s not a fox.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vhy vould rhinoceros be associated vith Russia? Ve have no rhinoceros in vild,&quot; said Elly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s an alliterate thing,&quot; said Lenny, &quot;The way they start with &#39;r&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think it would be pigeonholing her,&quot; said Jen, &quot;What would be is if she were going to be a bear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I like rhinoceros,&quot; said Elly, &quot;They are favorite animals at zoo. Vould make me be less wrong size.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I hope you&#39;ll be happy with your new body,&quot; said Jen.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Eventually, it was time for Elly to receive her dosage. Whether or not AES was linked to RHS was still to be determined. But there was no need to delay the change that Elly wanted. Taking her to a changing room, Judy was preparing the dosage. Thanks to the Rhino Guard, there was no shortage of White Rhinoceros DNA to use. Elly wasn&#39;t particular about wanting to become a white or black rhino and the Sumatran and Javan species were too endangered for any individuals to be uplifted. &quot;You may feel a little discomfort as you change,&quot; said Judy as she got the needle ready.<br />
<br />
&quot;I vill feel better later, da?&quot; asked Elly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll feel better before it&#39;s over,&quot; said Judy. She injected Elly with the solution and said, &quot;Welcome to Animalia&quot; before leaving.<br />
<br />
Elly soon felt itchy on her pricked skin. She could see that area was quickly turning grey and leathery. The feeling soon spread as well as the greyness. She felt an intense tingle in her muscles as they started to build up. Elly&#39;s gigantism had given her more height than muscles, but now they were filling up her frame. She grunted as she felt her shoulders widen a lot further than they had been before. That put quite a bit of strain on her shirt, which was already starting to tear because of her breasts becoming perkier and a little rounder.<br />
<br />
Her lower body was also going through some big changes. Her legs were becoming a lot thicker with muscle as they strengthened to support her upper body. The legs of her pants were ripping apart to reveal grey skin. The upper parts of her pants didn&#39;t fare much better as her hips widened to accommodate her muscles and the typical Animalian figure. A short ropy tail grew just above her growing rear. Her feet very odd as they burst out of their shoes, toes fusing together and growing until she was left with three large rhino toes.<br />
<br />
Elly felt discomfort as her face was growing out. Soon, she had a snout extending from her face which was obscuring her view a bit. Then it got more obscured when her horn started growing out. But she could still see around the horn. Elly&#39;s ears had already risen up to the top of her head, becoming bigger and more maneuverable. But the changes were not so uncomfortable now. In fact, they were really feeling good. Wanting to get rid of the last of her discomfort, Elly ripped apart what remained of her shirt and bra, allowing her large rhinoceros breasts to bounce free. She held them in her larger hands and was a bit surprised to feel something dripping in them.<br />
<br />
Looking in the mirror, Elly saw a rhino girl looking back. She was tall before, but she was even taller now. She had to be at least 7 feet. And unlike her old body which looked stretched asides from her breasts, her thick grey skin was now tightly wrapped around large muscles. Elly flexed her bigger arm, feeling more strength than ever before. Her breasts were still pretty humongous, having kept up with the rest of her. But with her muscular form, she wasn&#39;t dwarfed by them. And she could see that milk was dripping out from her dark grey nipples. Her face had changed a lot, with her rhino snout and sharp horn at the end. But she was still recognizable as her old self because of her blue eyes and blonde hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vill take getting use to,&quot; said Elly, her voice not sounding any deeper, &quot;But I think I vill like this.&quot;</p>
