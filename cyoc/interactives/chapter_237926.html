<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The world was indeed never the same. The transformative clouds or T-storms for short popped up in every country. Once they had spread across the globe due to an invisible wave, they could appear anywhere at any time. Even indoors was not safe. The only plus side was after they had spread across the globe their appearances became less frequent.  <br />
<br />
Additionally, only a select few were changed as dramatically as Isla&#39;s group. Initially, some governments tried to hide this or use these affected people as weapons. However, very few showed any combat potential or a will to fight. Most affected either lived their lives as much as they could while others embraced their changes. Some mutants felt this was a power they could use to crush their enemies. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
An armored vehicle drove through a forested area. The driver kept an eye out for trouble along with his fellow officer. The two of them were in charge of transporting a dangerous criminal to the new maximum security prison for transformed individuals. Given how this mess started in Oregon a year ago this was the best place. Down the road, two figures hid on the rocks overlooking their target.  <br />
<br />
Once the armored vehicle was in range the first figure dropped down. He landed on the hood denting it. The officers tried to shake him off but he held on. With one hand he sent a wave of light blue electricity into the engine. He leapt off as the engine set out large flames. Unable to control their ride the driver skidded off the road and into a tree.   <br />
<br />
Dazed they didn&#39;t see the other figure approach their cracked side window. He pointed his cock right at a small hole and cumed. They soon smelled something stinky before a sense of lust came over them. Fur began to cover them as they stripped. Their hands becoming paws made this difficult so instead the driver pushed his canine cock into his fellow officer&#39;s pussy. It wasn&#39;t long until two mindless dogs were mating in the front.  <br />
<br />
The taller of the two rolled his eyes and went to the back. Using his powers he blew open the lock and both opened the doors. &quot;Clay, Narda good timing,&quot; two glowing eyes said. Several more appeared on their side, and a large fluffy tail appeared as they came into the light of the full moon. &quot;Purity forgive us for not rescuing you sooner&quot; Clay went down on one knee. Purity had a human torso, shoulders, biceps, neck, and face. The rest of her was covered in fluffy black fur. Her legs ended in dull points while her hands were bigger than her head. Down her back, thighs, and tail large glowing eyes looked wherever she wanted them. The front of her platinum blonde hair hung over her missing right eye.  <br />
<br />
Purity smiled and swatted Clay into a tree. &quot;that was for blowing our heist!&quot; she yelled. Clay rubbed his rubbery skin. While he looked like a werewolf he most definitely was not. Blue rubber covered his skin with white and red markings on his torso and head in a pattern. From his shoulders, elbows, three-fingered hands, thighs, and toes sharp metal grew. From any of these points, Clay could make a powerful blast of electricity come from them. His long pink cock was permanently erect.  <br />
<br />
Narda then backed out of Purity&#39;s range. He looked like a humanoid skunk with red skin from his forearms and claves down to his hands and talons. The two horns on his head act like radar due to him having no eyes. he too was naked only his was by choice. His musky cock had the power to transform humans into horny beasts. Even other mutants could not help but be aroused and only the strongest-willed could resist.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Please forgive us. We saved you from the clink and look&quot; Narda went to the front of the vehicle. &quot;we got you puppies, well it&#39;ll take a while but still&quot; Purity saw with glee that her captors had become a German shepherd and a Doberman. Suddenly a blast of pink magic hit the window between them. Turning to the source Purity grumbled as a car came at them. From the passenger side was one of the mutants that had busted her.  <br />
<br />
&quot;it&#39;s Isla and his cronies. We need to move&quot; Purity picked Clay up with too much force and the three began to run. Wynn jumped out of the vehicle as it slowed down. After dropping him off he rushed to the armored car. Due to the crash and his magic blast, he could punch through the window. His horn gleamed as two wisps of magic flowed out of it and into the dog&#39;s heads. The two went from horny to horrified and the Doberman tried in vain to get away from his fellow officer. &quot;I&#39;m sorry this has happened to you. I&#39;ll stay here until help arrives&quot; he pulled a walkie-talkie out of his belt. &quot;Isla the officers have regained their sanity&quot;. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The three criminals soon arrived at their vehicle, their insignia and name plastered across the hood: &#39;Violet elite&#39; with a purple bloodshot eye for the o. Purity ripped off her prison uniform as they drove. They narrowly avoided Wyatt as he ran past them. &quot;Dam it she must&#39;ve gone straight&quot; They looked back at the curve and saw some broken trees on the hill.  <br />
<br />
Looking in the sky Clay saw Gwyn flying after them. he used his electricity powers to try to hit him. The dragon avoided these and let out a torrent of flame. Their roof began to melt from the heat. &quot;lose him or you&#39;ll wish you were dead&quot; Purity said. This time Clay screamed as he launched all his electricity from each of his metal points. Gwyn&#39;s eyes went wide before the current hit him. As he was falling Cody swerved the car and broke his fall. Unfortunately, the car wouldn&#39;t start up again. &quot;so much for the &#39;Alpha pack&#39; huh Narda sneered patting his exhausted ally.  <br />
<br />
Back at the car, Cody got out to look at the damage. &quot;Isla, Gwyn hit the front of the car. He&#39;ll live but we ain&#39;t fixing this anytime soon&quot; Cody said into his radio. &quot;Well leave it to us then,&quot; Alice said. The trio of criminals drove down the road. Purity then swerved suddenly.  <br />
<br />
&quot;what&#39;s going... on&quot; Clay saw a downed tree in the road. On top of it were two werewolves, Isla and Alice. &quot;come on Clay this is your moment to shine&quot; Narda said as they got out. Clay then flopped out of the car like a dead fish &quot;or not&quot;. &quot;Pauline &#39;purity&#39; Samson, Clay Amon, and Nancy &#39;Narda&#39; Jones. By the authority of the mutant protection agency I place you three under arrest.&quot; Isla said. &quot;oh yeah take this&quot; Narda said cuming in his direction. His smile faded as Isla and Alice&#39;s crotches tented but they remained vigilant. &quot;you think I will bow down to simple-minded humans and their laws. I am PURITY and you will be cleansed&quot; The eyes on her tail glowed bright as she sent a blast of pure darkness at them. They both jumped out of the way as it hit the tree. The downed piece of wood soon began to rot rapidly until it was a pile of mush. Isla and Alice used this time to tackle both Purity and Nadra. Clay was too weak to fight and soon each had enchanted cuffs on them.   <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The group soon returned to M.P.A. headquarters. One wouldn&#39;t think it used to be the very house they were at when they changed. Over the year, Briar and Wynn had turned it into a high-tech base. They had even got permission from the US government to form their agency. &quot;well that could&#39;ve gone better&quot; Alice said as she changed out of her uniform. Each of them wore a variation of a navy blue high-tech suit. Now she wore a sleeveless tank top and green shorts.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome back,&quot; Briar said as they all entered the garage. The collar around her neck looked similar to one from a movie. She then saw the damage to the car. &quot;this will take a while&quot; she said as the garage closed. &quot;looks like I picked the wrong time for sentry duty&quot; Jay said seeing his team come in. &quot;Yeah Well, you might&#39;ve had it worse the Gwyn. I&#39;m taking him to his room then I need a shower.&quot; Wyatt said. Turning her head she smiled. &quot;ya coming Cody?&quot; her boyfriend grinned and ran on all fours to follow the two. &quot;they could at least be subtle&quot; Jay said as he relaxed before resuming his night watch. &quot;I&#39;m proud of you team. we just took down three members of the violet elite.&quot; Isla said before kissing his girlfriend. Alice smiled before going to rest.  <br />
<br />
Isla couldn&#39;t believe it had been a year since their lives changed. If Issac hadn&#39;t merged with Bella then this team might&#39;ve never formed. He walked down to the lab and pulled up a message board. &#39;The leader of the violet elite and two of her subordinates have been handled. Gwyn will need to rest before any missions though&#39; he typed. Other M.P.A. groups messaged back that they had gotten some of the violet elite in Chicago and Washington State Park. He closed the tab and Jay called him up &quot;Isla, come up here&quot; the griffin said.  <br />
<br />
Arriving in the living room he was surprised to see a cake and party decorations. Wynn hung them up. &quot;what the occasion?&quot; Isla asked. Everyone but him had changed out of their uniforms. &quot;a year ago we were out in the backyard when the storm chose us to change. However, without you, we may have ended up lost or like purity. Gwyn decided a new party needed to be made to celebrate the anniversary and our leader&quot; Wyatt said. Isla was touched and hugged his dragon friend. He then went and cut the cake.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
During the party, a montage of the group adventures over the year played. One showed Tory accidentally kicking Isla in the face the night after it all happened. He guessed her flight or fight mode kicked in and she didn&#39;t recognize him while in his werewolf form. The next was Cody talking to other people affected by punk fever. They ended up forming a group therapy. Unfortunately, Randall had to be put into quarantine due to his pheromones causing the affliction. Isla still wished that they could help more.  <br />
<br />
A picture then showed up, showing Cody and Wyatt&#39;s first date. Wyatt only let Cody call her Wendy after that. A video of Wynn showing his magic appeared as everyone mingled some more. Another picture showed Jay and his girlfriend Blaze. She was a red anthro dragon that Jay had rescued from a fire she accidentally started. It was their first mission. Isla sadly wasn&#39;t there as he was training Alice to control her beast side.  <br />
<br />
Another video was played of Gwyn and her parents after one of the transformative storms hit them. They were now a three-headed Cerberus man. The third was their dog Nancy who didn&#39;t get any mental upgrade but could control their left arm and used their cock to cum a lot. They were currently in training to overcome this. It had only been two weeks though so it was slow. Briar floor plans appeared for their base at one point. The group had a few laughs before an alert appeared and stopped the party. &quot;warning storm anomaly detected at Calvin farms&quot; an automated voice said. Isla, Wynn, Cody, and Jay were selected for the mission.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
After arriving the farmer came to them. &quot;I was just milking Cynthia and the storm appeared right above the rafters. Then that happened&quot; he opened the door to see an author cow with a horny look on her face. The farmer then groaned as the clouds parted. Wynn immediately sent a wisp of energy to the man as he grew out of his clothes. In a matter of moments he was now a feral were-horse.  <br />
<br />
After he cumed he looked panicked. &quot;Don&#39;t worry I preserved your mind. Sorry, I can&#39;t do much else&quot; Wynn said. Sniffing the air Isla recognized transformative pheromones in the air. It was beginning to affect the barn animals in different ways. &quot;okay we got a transformative mutant on our hands. Cody distracts it and Jay goes in to slap the cuffs on her. I&#39;ll deal with the farm life&quot; The group then ran in. &quot;just another day at the office&quot; Wynn said as he tended to the former farmer.</p>
