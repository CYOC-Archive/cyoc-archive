<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff dropped the dildo, fell backwards onto his bed, spread his legs wide and stared up at the taller figure, shocked beyond belief. Before he could react further, Rhett turned around and picked up the dildo with one arm, bringing it into his field of view, before dropping it, realizing what it was.<br />
<br />
Both men stood there silently in shock and realization for a moment.<br />
<br />
Finally, Rhett broke the silence: “Holy fuck…whoa. You uh…You look different…fuck. Good to see you Jeff. How’re you doing?”<br />
<br />
Still, both men just gawked at each other. The silence stretched until finally Rhett cleared his throat. “You okay, Jeff? Shit.” Obviously glaring at Jeff’s new vagina where he still remembered his sizely cock once being.<br />
<br />
At last, Rhett spoke. “I dunno what happened…what the hell…you look amazing dude. So fucking cool. Really, really hot. Jesus, so good to see you looking like this.” He took another look. Jeff knew the rumors were true about Rhett, but Rhett knew Jeff was staring right back at him.  Neither could take their eyes off the other.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a big tear ran down Rhett’s face. It was clear that something happened here between them and it had taken a lot of time and effort for both men to realize it. Rhett opened his mouth to speak, but Jeff cut him off.<br />
<br />
“Rhett, please don’t say anything, it can wait…” Jeff regained some awareness, moving to cover up his pussy with a blanket.<br />
<br />
Rhett stepped closer and looked at Jeff, taking in the change in him, smiling sadly and softly touching his chin. “Don’t do that. Look man, I just wanna know you again. When did you? I mean, it looks great. Looks fantastic. That’s awesome…” he trailed off, before adding: “and obviously great to see you and everything, but we need to talk. Real talk. There’s no going back now. We gotta figure out what happened. Why I haven’t seen you in forever. Okay? Come on, let’s sit down.”<br />
<br />
A smile lit up Rhett’s handsome face. He sat on the edge of Jeff’s bed, and waited for Jeff to get ready to sit next to him. “So, um, where are we gonna start?” Rhett asked.<br />
<br />
As they sat facing each other, Rhett had moved over close to Jeff. They sat on the edge of the bed, so that their legs touched.  Rhett had never felt more alive than when sitting across from his former friend, letting him know that whatever happened, it wouldn’t change anything.<br />
<br />
It was strange, yet somehow familiar, sitting there, waiting for Jeff to tell him everything. “I’m so so sorry…” Jeff was tearing up, “…I just couldn’t risk it.”  His voice cracked slightly.<br />
<br />
Rhett gently reached out and brushed his fingers against Jeff’s hand. “Hey, hey, calm down, it’s not your fault, bro. Don’t beat yourself up.” “… it is though when the rumors started about you and… and being gay” Jeff was full on sobbing now, it was clear he regretted pushing Rhett away. “…I was scared of forcing myself out… and I know how selfish that is now but I was just afraid, I’m sorry I promise!”<br />
<br />
Rhett leaned forward, rubbing Jeff’s thigh. He was hurting, and so was Jeff. It was obvious they needed figure something out but in that moment, both of them were looking for something to make it stop hurting so much. And both found it in each other’s arms.<br />
<br />
It didn’t mean anything, they thought. Here they were, two friends, both freshly outed to each other, both sexually frustrated. Jeff was only wearing socks and a t-shirt, and Rhett was cradling him in his hulking arms.  It would be easy to imagine that this was just any old hugging session. But as he rested his head against Rhett’s shoulder, his entire body calmed. The simple closeness made him feel safe. <br />
<br />
Jeff’s hands began to wander to Rhett’s giant pectorals. Rhett’s rugged fingers were curious about Jeff’s secret surgery. “Can I…” he sheepishly asked. “Mmmhmm.” Jeff lifted the blanket just enough so that Rhett could admire newly made sex hole.<br />
<br />
Even though this was the first time Rhett was seeing it, it was obvious Jeff was healing amazingly. He had seen Jeff’s pre-op …material, and even though he was confused why anyone would give that up, he didn’t show it. Jeff who was at this point laying on Rhett’s lap noticed his arousal. All three and a half inches of Rhett were poking into Jeff from behind. Not an inch was hidden by their bodies. Jeff looked directly at Rhett and winked. The shit eating grin on his face indicated that maybe this wasn’t the time to come clean. Rhett gently traced the entrance to his freshly built pussy with the tip of his index finger. He could tell Jeff was still fragile down there. A small shift of his hips suggested he might have been wet too. So he started to rub gently, exploring and caressing, feeling Jeff respond every time he hit what was left of his glans, now forming his neoclitoris.<br />
<br />
They spent what felt like an eternity like that. Neither one had ever been so hypnotized by another human being before. Rhett ran his thumb along the scars adorning Jeff’s labia, Jeff rubbed Rhett’s own little numb through his thin polyester gym shorts. <br />
<br />
Rhett shifted positions, the big man started moving slowly, running his tongue along the folds and trying to find new ones. For some reason, the pleasure he was getting by simply staring at the new beautiful structure underneath his tongue, surprised Jeff. Rhett suddenly understood the appeal of pussy. This beautiful man was offering up his most vulnerable part, at a most vulnerable time. The scabs that covered once ballsack, the puffy and bruised entrance of his vagina.<br />
<br />
Jeff had always loved having someone look at him as if he was something beautiful and wonderful, but Rhett showed him in all its glory. It took Jeff a while to realize that not only did Rhett want to lick his crease (no pun intended) but that Rhett wanted to bury his nose inside it too. Every inch of his flesh that was exposed came under Rhett’s expert care. Jeff’s body shivered and twitched with every stroke, trembling between pleasure and pain. As much as he wished he could see what he was doing to Rhett, he figured the animalistic groan that escaped his lips made it pretty obvious anyway.<br />
<br />
Even though his nerves were still recovering from the rearrangement, there was no way he was going to last long, so when Rhett slid the tip of his tongue into Jeff’s vagina and started sucking, Jeff came immediately. He could hear himself moaning loudly but also wanted to say Rhett hadn’t really helped his recovery by doing that. <br />
<br />
Both of them slumped back spent but happy onto Jeff’s bed. But Rhett noticed the strange glowing blue rock on Jeff’s nightstand.</p>
