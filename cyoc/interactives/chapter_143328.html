<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When she spoke, she realised the bottom half of her face was sticking out in her eyeline.<br />
<br />
&quot;MoooOoOOO?&quot; She said loudly, intending to swear in shock. Emily brought her hoof hands up to her face, feeling around at its new form. She decided she kind of liked it, but wished there was a mirror around so she could see it properly.<br />
<br />
She looked down, trying to check out the rest of her body, but struggled to see past her tits. &#39;The milk must be making them grow even more...&#39; she thought, surprised her dress was managing to hold them in. She looked over her shoulder, trying to get a good view of her rear, but settled for feeling herself up for now. Her hips had definitely widened more, making her arse even plumper than before. She tried to pull her dress down over it, but it only managed halfway.<br />
<br />
Finally she set her attention back on Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nate? Mooooooo?&quot; She said, kicking at him.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t look quite as transformed as she did, but he was definitely quite far along. He had put on a lot of weight of his own, but not in a sexy way like she had. He was just...fat now. His skin was pink-ish in tone, underneath the layer of mud he was covered in. He had a round little about on his face, and a cute little curly tail poking through his jeans too.<br />
<br />
Judging by the fluids she could feel running down her leg, Emily assumed they had just had sex, but right now she didn&#39;t feel attracted to him in the slightest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Emily? Are you...you again?&quot; He said, looking up at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea...I think sooOoOoOOO&quot; she replied, getting a little irked at how her moos were sneaking into her general speaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great. We need to get out of here fast. This place isn&#39;t good for either of us right now, we can catch up in the car.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate struggles back to his feet, grabbed Emily&#39;s hood and led the way to the exit. The pair encountered a few of the farmhands on the way out, who seemed a little miffed that there were still customers on site, but apparently none the wiser as to what they were doing.<br />
<br />
Once they were safely in the car, and driving away, Emily started the conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nate, did we have sex back there? I...I can&#39;t remoooOOOooO...ber.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea...sorry if I was out of line...it just seemed like it might have been the only way at the time to bring you back. I&#39;m surprised you could even take any more though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait...any moooooOOoore? Oh fuck off!&quot; She swore at herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Errr...yea. maybe I shouldn&#39;t tell you&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nate, tell me now&quot; Emily demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, well...errr... you were in the bull pen and...&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily gasped, the memories trickling back into her mind. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god...the bull&quot; she found she was trying to sound disgusted, but really she was kind of okay with it. <br />
<br />
She remembered being on all fours as it forced itself upon her, pushing inside her, fucking her roughly until it filled her with loads of cum. She was getting a little hot and bothered again just thinking about it, but she didn&#39;t want Nate to know that.<br />
<br />
&quot;If it helps...you looked like you were enjoying it?&quot; Nate said, trying to make her feel better.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brilliant&quot; she said sarcastically, trying to go along with the disgusted angle she was taking. <br />
&#39;I was definitely enjoying it...&#39; she thought to herself.<br />
<br />
They say in silence for a a couple of minutes until Nate broke it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Em... Why is this happening to us?&quot; He asked, with a slight tinge of sadness to his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s...kind of mooOooO...fault&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait what. How?!&quot; He said, raising his voice a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got this app on my phooOoOone. I didn&#39;t know what it did, but if I called someone an animoOoOo then it listened and starting changing them. I called yoooooOOou a pig and myself a cooOoow not long after I got it.&quot; Emily admitted, also admitting defeat to the mooing, as she gave up trying to stifle them.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you did this to me?! It&#39;s your fault I look like a hideous pig man?! Why do you get to be a voluptuous cow girl, or Kate gets to be a sexy fox lady, and I&#39;m stuck turning into a fat fuck?! &quot; He shouted, pulling the car over.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, oooOooOokay?! And anyway, why do you knoooOoow about Kate?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I fucked her after Meera&#39;s party, does it even matter now? I know you went home with Eli that night anyway, and so does Kate. Your dumb cow brain forgot to get rid of your old clothes from his place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, fuck yoooOOoooOo Nate!&quot; Emily screamed at him, bursting into tears and throwing the car door open. She slammed it behind her and stormed off,  then heard Nate turn his car around and drive in the opposite direction.<br />
<br />
Emily walked down the road, sobbing, not really knowing where she wanted to go right now.<br />
<br />
&#39;Maybe I should just go and be a fucking cow right now. Nobody would even care, and I&#39;ll just be dumb and stupid and ignorant to everything&#39; she thought to herself.<br />
<br />
Her mind started reliving her moment of bliss back at the farm show, and she instantly stopped crying. &#39;Eating grass with the other cows...squeezing out my milk whenever I want...getting to breed with the bull...it all sounds so perfect. Why don&#39;t I just do it?&#39;<br />
<br />
Emily stopped for a moment and looked around, trying to figure out where she was before deciding where she was going. Down the road a little ways, she noticed Tom&#39;s corner shop, which also meant she wasn&#39;t far from Eli&#39;s place. <br />
<br />
If she was going to go all Cow, she was going to need her bull to fuck her.</p>
