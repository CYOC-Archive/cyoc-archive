<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Come with me Carl demanded when he was nose to nose with Myron. He <br />
grabbed Myron by the t-shirt and twisted it and pulled him like it was <br />
a leash.<br />
<br />
But .. Wait .. What ..<br />
<br />
Don't talk just come boy. Myron had never been so submissive but <br />
something in this man's tone made him want to follow him.<br />
<br />
Myron and Carl headed out and to a golden coral.<br />
<br />
Sit here Carl demanded. And in minutes he returned with a couple <br />
plates piled full of potatoes and meats and all sorts of starches.<br />
<br />
Go ahead and start eating.<br />
<br />
Carl sat down across from Myron and started quizzing Myron as Myron <br />
dug into one of the plates. Myron noticed that Carl wasn't eating. Go <br />
ahead he said to Carl.<br />
<br />
You don't tell me what to do boy.<br />
<br />
My name is Myron. <br />
<br />
YOUR NAME IS BOY! This was almost comical to Myron seeing as he was <br />
about 5 years older than Carl but Carl was able to make this stick.<br />
<br />
Myron's mind wanted him to get up and leave. He had never been treated <br />
like this before.<br />
<br />
So tell me about yourself Boy.<br />
<br />
Well I work at Gold's gym. I am a trainer. Myron offered betweens <br />
bites. My boyfriend works at an investment firm. And I have one <br />
younger brother that I see very rarely. No Parents.<br />
<br />
OK. Where can we find your boyfriend now. Carl had replaces the empty <br />
plates with two more piled high.<br />
<br />
He is at work. But he will be at the gym in a couple hours.<br />
<br />
OK. We have time then.<br />
<br />
For what?<br />
<br />
To get to know each other.<br />
<br />
Carl sat and asked question after question as Myron piled in the <br />
plates. Getting painfully stuffed. It was about the 9th plate when <br />
Myron finally had enough and just stopped. <br />
<br />
OK stand up boy Carl said. And Myron did as instructed and saw his <br />
belly poking out from the bottom of the t-shirt.<br />
<br />
Looks good. Carl said. Get in the car.<br />
<br />
Carl and Myron went off to his gym where they found Myron's boyfriend. <br />
Myron introduced Carl to his boyfriend Herbert and Carl said ok tell <br />
him you and he are breaking up. Myron and Herbert looked at Carl but <br />
Myron did as he was instructed telling Herbert that he had found his <br />
life mate and that he just knew that this was what he truly wanted.<br />
<br />
You can't be serious. We have been together 5 years.<br />
<br />
Well I was just going through the motions. I like you and hope that we <br />
can be friends but I am just not in love with you. I am in love with <br />
Carl. I have never been so in love with anyone before.<br />
<br />
Herbert was screeching in the gym about the break up and Carl just <br />
told him to get over it. This was the way it was going to be. Carl <br />
took Myron by the shirt like he had when they left the bar where he <br />
went into the gym offices and made Myron quit his job as trainer. <br />
Making the demand like he had with Myron's boyfriend and Myron <br />
complied.<br />
<br />
What now? I don't have a boyfriend and I don't have a job.<br />
<br />
You don't need a boyfriend. Carl said sternly. You are my boy. And as <br />
for a job you have one I own a chain of stores including Dunkin <br />
Donuts, Ci Ci's Pizza and Burger King.<br />
<br />
You will work at them for me.<br />
<br />
But those places are nasty.<br />
<br />
You will do as you are told and you will like it.<br />
<br />
There was just something about this man that made him want to do as he <br />
was told. It felt right to him.<br />
<br />
Your schedule is this. In the morning you will get up and make <br />
breakfast. If you don't do it right you will be scolded and severely <br />
disciplined. At which time you will go to the donut shop to work.<br />
<br />
You will meet me for lunch and then work at Ci Ci's or Burger King in <br />
the afternoon.<br />
<br />
I will have your schedule made in the morning and which shop you will <br />
go to will be posted. My managers will be instructed on your duties <br />
and if you displease them you will displease me. DON&quot;T DISPLEASE ME!<br />
<br />
When you finish with your afternoon work you will come home and then <br />
you will have duties here.<br />
<br />
Carl and Myron went back to Carl's place and Myron asked about picking <br />
up his stuff at Herbert's.<br />
<br />
You don't need them I will provide everything you need. And Herbert <br />
had already gone home and tossed everything Myron had out into the <br />
street anyway.<br />
<br />
Herbert got depressed and lost interest in working out and soon became <br />
pear shaped working mostly.<br />
<br />
When Myron got up in the morning he looked in the fridge and made a <br />
very sensible meal of scrambled eggs, whites only, and some toast. <br />
When Carl got up and saw the breakfast he was furious. This is what <br />
you make for breakfast? This isn't enough for a growing boy.<br />
<br />
Ok we don't have much time before you have to be in to work so eat up <br />
and I am going to make some more and will leave you with breakfast <br />
instructions since you can't even do that right.<br />
<br />
Myron ate while Carl cooked and came and sat a platter of pancakes <br />
down in front of Myron dripping in butter and syrup. EAT UP BOY!<br />
<br />
Myron started to pick off a few and Carl became more insistent. EAT UP <br />
NOW!<br />
<br />
Myron started shoveling bite after bite in until the stacks were gone.<br />
<br />
He was stuffed.<br />
<br />
OK NOW I AM GOING TO DROP YOU OFF AT WORK.<br />
<br />
Carl Strutted into the Donut shop and had a talk with the manager <br />
while Myron was considering why he was dressed in some daisy dukes and <br />
a wife beater. When Carl returned he told Myron that the manager would <br />
be reporting to Carl during the day on Myron's progress. Since you <br />
have never worked at a shop like this you will need to learn the <br />
products. I will be back to pick you up for lunch and off to your next <br />
job. Do as your told.<br />
<br />
Carl left Myron standing there when the manager came up with a tray of <br />
their donuts and a pot of coffee heavy with cream. OK Myron is it? Sit <br />
down here and lets start you learning the products. He sat the stuffed <br />
jock down and said eat up. Carl said you could finish this up easily.<br />
<br />
Myron didn't want to do it but he did as he was told and sat and ate <br />
each donut. And an hour later he had finished and the manager replaced <br />
them with a new variety.<br />
<br />
When Carl returned for lunch Myron was so stuffed and showing stress <br />
marks on his belly.<br />
<br />
OK lunch time I bet your ready for a break from work.<br />
<br />
Myron just rolled his eyes and they went off to have lunch and Myron <br />
stuffed himself even more then. When they stopped off at Ci Ci's he <br />
was so stuffed but Carl repeated his instructions to the manager there <br />
and he was off. Myron learning the products there. <br />
<br />
When Carl returned to pick up the jock he noticed that the boy's daisy <br />
dukes were unbuttoned and his shirt was riding up.<br />
<br />
Good boy.</p>
