<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt was a bit nervous on all of this. The distribution and administration of the Animalia Virus was a complicated one, mostly because of the unique nature of that virus. How its mutagenic properties could uplift a mundane animal into an Animalian and could convert a Human into an Animalian provided that Human was also exposed to an animal&#39;s DNA. The most common way this was done was through shots and most laws generally restricted the administration of those shots to the staff working at Horizon&#39;s various facilities, be it in the main offices in Lyre, Nevada or at one of the other connected facilities that were set up at the various Animalian colonies. However, the Evans lived in a fairly rural part of Alaska. They lived in a small town that was reasonably built up, but it was just remote enough that going all the way to Nevada would be a bit troublesome.<br />
<br />
The paperwork that Matt had had to fill out was extensive to show that he wouldn&#39;t just take the shot and then run around unvaccinated. Thankfully his science and med classes, including plans to ultimately attend medical school had been enough to help him clear those things out, and he&#39;d noted that while the syringes for the Wolf Animalian conversion were missing, the syringe that had the vaccine for the Animalia Virus was still there. Though, through Matt&#39;s plan, he was to explain his plan to his mother, go through with the conversion and then administer the vaccination so that the enamel on his claws or his saliva wouldn&#39;t be a risk to create more Animalians willy-nilly. However, it appeared that his mother had taken those doses and put it in her coffee that she brewed and was now starting to transform into a Wolf Animalian.<br />
<br />
Matt was a bit nervous as while some things that were sitting at the start of this transformation wouldn&#39;t be fully noticeable, all reports indicated that someone becoming an Animalian would feel some of the physical effects. The transformation wasn&#39;t painful, unless one was wearing restrictive clothing and becoming a large enough Animalian that they would outgrow their clothes, but that didn&#39;t mean that the person becoming an Animalian wouldn&#39;t notice. This would mean an awkward conversation was going to happen when Katherine noted the changes in her own body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom... did you... did you READ the label on what you put into the coffee?&quot; Matt asked, not technically answering the question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; Katherine admitted while her fingernails lengthened a bit into stubby claws at the end of her fingers, and she was feeling a bit warm, but her eyes were focused more to her son than anything else. &quot;The company has always put them in things that look sort of like a baster and you can just directly inject it into the hot water. And I like my coffee strong... I think there was one of them left if you wanted to try it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt looked down for a moment, &quot;mom... that WASN&#39;T coffee. That was the Animalia Virus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Katherine answered, nearly jumping in her seat and feeling something pressing at the base of her spine.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d bought the doses to be a Wolf Animalian from Horizon,&quot; Matt answered, &quot;and had to provide a lot of additional information that would enable Horizon to accept mailing it to me for home medication and conversion. I was hoping to inform everyone about that before going through with the conversion... but I didn&#39;t think you would confuse medical syringes for what would essentially be a medical injection for flavor shots for coffee... coffee that you drank and are now transforming as a result.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was at this point where Katherine looked down to her hands and noted the buildup of black pads underneath her fingertips and with her fingernails lengthening into claws. They weren&#39;t sharp or recurved in the way that a cat&#39;s claw would be, but they were big enough to be noticeable. The growing of grey fur was also noticeable, though Katherine also noted that this wasn&#39;t a solid grey, and in fact there was a fair amount of white that was also present on her fingers and on the inside of her arm while the growing fur on the outside of her arm was a bit darker. It was also at this point that Katherine got a full awareness on how much she had changed already and was still changing.<br />
<br />
The result was a state of panic as she pushed backward at the couch and flailing her legs. This only served to send her slippers flying through the air with one smacking Matt in the face while the other went past him and hit the front case to the entertainment center that the Evans family &quot;video&quot; and music collections were housed in. No glass was broken, but that was also rapidly becoming a side concern as Katherine&#39;s lengthening digitigrade feet were exposed and she was becoming ever more aware on how warm the room present felt. It was like the heat was set up to a hundred, which to some people might be fine in a cold Alaskan winter night, but to a transforming Animalian, and particularly one that could be used to cold temperatures, it was starting to get uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
Matt was unsure as to how to respond as his mother rolled now on the couch, almost as if that was to be a way to try and stop the transformation. Though, this was something that Horizon had found impossible and irreversible. Technically the company was still researching into ways that might reverse the transformations, if only for the possible option of helping those that had been victims of accidental conversions during the initial outbreak in Lyre, Nevada, but a lot of that had slowed. Some of it because many of those same victims seemed to also rapidly come to grips with being Animalians and others even seemed to like it. But after that outbreak, conversion was deliberate and for those that consciously wanted it and Horizon had put a lot of effort into trying to make sure things like this DIDN&#39;T happen, and now it WAS happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, mom,&quot; Matt managed as he noted Katherine&#39;s ears rising as two triangular points from the top of her head and that her hair was regaining the bright blonde luster that he&#39;d seen in pictures of his mother from when she and his father were dating and before he was born, &quot;I... I should have told you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn rrrrrrright you should have,&quot; Katherine practically growled back, as she didn&#39;t expect to become an Animalian and she couldn&#39;t deny how inhuman she was becoming as her face pushed forward into a wolfen muzzle and how sharp her sense of smell was getting. Though, at the same time, as her pants were containing to grow tighter and that that same sensation was also being felt in her bra, she could also feel a growing wetness in her loins. The transformation was starting to feel good and indicating that it was also nearing its end. &quot;I didn&#39;t... waaaaant to be an Animaaaaaliaaaaaannnn...&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt could only watch as his mother carefully pulled down the back of her pants as they were being strained to their limits by her widening hips and growing rear. Though this was only far enough to let her new tail have its freedom to wag a bit behind her. He also noted that the holiday sweater was also straining to cover the growing swell of his mother&#39;s bosom, which made the hat decal for the image of Santa look bigger as the orbs underneath it stretched them. He thought he saw Katherine look over her shoulder to her back, almost as if she were thinking on undoing the clasps her bra to free her growing breasts, but she ultimately didn&#39;t, and she just gritted her now canine teeth together to endure the changes as they reached its end. His mother was not a promiscuous or openly flirtatious woman. He knew she was technically young enough for sex with his father, but he also knew his mother wouldn&#39;t flaunt it and despite Animalians generally being more comfortable with some things than Humans, that wasn&#39;t going to change everything.<br />
<br />
&quot;I should have,&quot; Matt managed, &quot;I... I guess I wasn&#39;t thinking on that when I came in. You normally only have your coffee in the morning... I figured I&#39;d have time to explain things tonight and then give myself the transformative shots tomorrow morning, followed by the vaccine shot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vaccine shot?&quot; Katherine managed as she started to recover, though she knew her bra was now painfully tight she also felt that her new and large breasts felt a bit heavier than she thought they should be. She didn&#39;t fully yet note the two wet spots on the front of her holiday sweater.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... the Animalia Virus is unique in some ways... that it can essentially be turned on and off,&quot; Matt answered, &quot;when on, it can convert Humans and uplift mundane animals INTO Animalians. And just about anything in that new Animalian&#39;s system would be transformative... be it family or an animal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;God...&quot; Katherine swore.<br />
<br />
Matt had to accept some of that, as this was all a bit of a surprise. Though, he did still want to convert, and while it wasn&#39;t the way he expected, there would be an option. For while he hadn&#39;t planned on converting his mother, she was now the way that he could convert. For as a mature female Animalian, she was likely now lactating again as all female Animalians that were seventeen or older did, and her unvaccinated milk would provide for his own conversion. But asking for that would be uncomfortable at the immediate moment, and handling the vaccine was going to be harder. For while he did have a dose of it, he only had ONE dose, and that was supposed to be for him after his own transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do have a shot for the vaccine, and when I checked the fridge... you didn&#39;t take that syringe,&quot; Matt said slowly, &quot;though there will be some issues...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what would that be?&quot; Katherine asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I do still want to convert,&quot; Matt spoke, &quot;and you could help with that now... and it could be something private. Nothing embarrassing for you... but even with that, I only have ONE does of the vaccine... as I figured that I would be the only one becoming an Animalian...<br />
<br />
Katherine only sighed back, though she also put a bit of a growl into it as well. She had no intention of harming her son, or her pup, as something in the back of her mind told her, but that didn&#39;t remove some frustration with the fact that he&#39;d failed to be upfront with her and placed something that was quite mutagenic in nature right next to her coffee flavoring shots. It would mean a whole mess in trying to explain things to her husband and likely to Horizon as well. She was tempted to take the vaccine on her own and that Matt would have to spend money again on the conversion, and with all this, likely wouldn&#39;t be able to work the mailing deal with Horizon again because of the accident, but a part of her also didn&#39;t want to be the bad guy in all this.</p>
