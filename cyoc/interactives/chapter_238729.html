<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Just change me.&quot; Tina&#39;s eyebrows raised in surprise, garnering an eye roll from Leah, &quot;It&#39;d be faster, wouldn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, but...don&#39;t you want to learn how to do it yourself?&quot;<br />
Leah huffed, looking like she too acknowledges this with a hint of shame.<br />
&quot;Well, I don&#39;t have to in order to potty train right?&quot;<br />
&quot;I suppose not-&quot;<br />
&quot;Then what&#39;s the point?&quot;<br />
The question was a little petulant, to Tina&#39;s surprise. <br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;d make it easier, and give you a bit more independence.&quot;<br />
&quot;...but a toddler wouldn&#39;t change themself at the daycare, would they?&quot;<br />
Tina narrowed her eyes in thought.<br />
&quot;Hmm...you&#39;re right, we wouldn&#39;t allow that. A worker would have to change you every time.&quot;<br />
&quot;So what&#39;s the point in learning?&quot; Leah&#39;s voice sounded just a hint condescending. <br />
On one hand, Leah had a point: she really wouldn&#39;t have the option to change herself for most of the day. On the other hand...Tina can&#39;t help but feel like Leah&#39;s reasons are far less practical. If she didn&#39;t know any better, she&#39;d almost say Leah just wanted to avoid dealing with her own dirty diapers. At least, Tina thinks she knows better; the girl who hates being babied suddenly being okay with having her diaper changed seems non-sensical, but in all honesty Leah might be less mature than Tina thought.<br />
&quot;If you&#39;re sure. Actually, follow me.&quot; Tina locked her car and headed towards the daycare with Leah in tow. Entering, Tina turned on only a handful of lights for visibility. The walls with covered with colorful pictures, and boxes of toys lined the area. Leah gave the place a once over with a subtle face of disdain. Tina moved until she was in the changing area, and patted a changing table.<br />
&quot;Alright, take off your pants, and lay yourself down.&quot;<br />
Leah looked disgruntled, but of course had no choice as she wordlessly obeyed. <br />
&quot;Now stay still, and this will be over quickly.&quot;<br />
Tina had a feeling that even without the command, Leah wouldn&#39;t have moved an inch; even as Tina removed the filthy pullup, the girl&#39;s face was focused on anything other than her waist. It was clearly an uncomfortable experience. Tina kept her word, however, and the girl was soon wrapped in her first of many new diaper. <br />
&quot;All done. How&#39;s it feel?&quot;<br />
Leah, no longer forced to stay still, slowly sits up, face an unreadable mixture as she experiences sitting in a diaper for the first time in over a decade.<br />
&quot;God these things are thick. Aren&#39;t there any smaller ones?&quot;<br />
&quot;Afraid not, sweety. You&#39;re going to have to get used to it.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think I can even fit my pants over these things.&quot; Leah lamented while looking at her removed jeans.<br />
&quot;You won&#39;t be wearing jeans anyways. In fact, why not get dressed in your new wardrobe from now on?&quot;<br />
Leah looked at her in horror, as if the very idea was blasphemous. Tina couldn&#39;t help but giggle.<br />
&quot;Look, you said you didn&#39;t want anyone to know you&#39;re a teen. That&#39;s going to take quite a bit of work on your part. If this is too much, we might as well just inform the staff.&quot;<br />
Leah grit her teeth in frustration, but nodded. &quot;Alright, fine. Any outfit is better than going pantsless.&quot;<br />
Tina grinned widely; this might be a terrible situation for both of them, but at least Tina has an excuse to dress up Leah in cute clothes. The daycare had quite a few extra outfits, most of which would fit Leah&#39;s short frame. After going through them all with barely disguised disgust, Leah eventually went with a cute yellow ducky shirt and a pair of shorttails. After convincing her that her hair would need to look right too, Tina went ahead and put her hair into little pigtails. By the end of it, Leah looked like an incredibly cute (and grumpy) toddler.<br />
&quot;Awww!&quot; Tina cooed, fighting her temptation to take out her phone and take pictures. Leah groaned, looking equal parts flustered and annoyed.<br />
&quot;Shut up! And stop acting like this is cute!&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh don&#39;t be such a sour puss Leah, you look super cute!&quot;<br />
&quot;Ugh, only you would say that. Can we just get out of here already?&quot; <br />
Tina reluctantly nods, and the two exit the building. Leah looks almost more flustered to leave, hiding behind Tina on the short trek back to the car.<br />
&quot;You know, I just realized something. We might need a car seat now too, if we want to keep the illusion up.&quot; Tina vocalized upon entering the car, jumping as a door was slammed violently shut. She turned to see Leah&#39;s face twisted into the single most angry face she thinks she&#39;s ever seen and decides to drop the topic altogether. <br />
The drive home was long and awkward, neither party wanting to say anything. Tina spied on Leah through the rear view mirror a handful of times, and the girl didn&#39;t move from crossing her arms tightly and looking out the window with a stern face. It was still cute, but Tina couldn&#39;t fight off the guilt of taking advantage of Leah&#39;s obedience. <br />
Leah&#39;s face scrunched, and she lifted her butt before letting out a short, but audible fart without a hint of realization. Tina was worried she might&#39;ve pooped again, but relaxed upon the lack of smell; the girl just couldn&#39;t hold her gas in anymore, nor seemed to notice the sound or smell. In her earlier getup it was unnerving, but dressed as a proper tot she looked incredibly cute and little. Tina was tempted to keep her like this, command her to stay as her little pottypants tot, but knew that was selfish and ruthless.<br />
Upon getting home, Tina waited until they were inside before grabbing Leah&#39;s shorttails and pulling them down.<br />
&quot;W-Wait, what the- WHAT THE HELL TINA!?&quot; The girl screamed, eeking further as Tina grabbed her now exposed diaper&#39;s waist back.<br />
&quot;Ooh, looks like this diaper is set to burst! A moment sooner, you might&#39;ve leaked.&quot; Tina mentioned causally, &quot;To think you wet it this much on just the ride over.&quot; Leah jerked out of Tina&#39;s grasp, turning to glare at her.<br />
&quot;What the hell is your problem, Tina!?&quot;<br />
&quot;Leah, you&#39;re going to have to get used to diaper checks. You completely soaked your diaper, and I&#39;m betting you had no idea.&quot;<br />
Leah&#39;s face flared in vitriol and embarrassment, but she shuts her mouth and looks away in shame.<br />
&quot;...no.&quot; The words were incredibly quiet, completely opposite of what Tina usually expects from her boisterous stepdaughter.<br />
&quot;Go ahead and get a shower. I&#39;ll talk with your school in the mean time. Call me when you&#39;re done, and I&#39;ll diaper you for bed.&quot;<br />
Tina removed Leah&#39;s diaper, leaving her waist entirely exposed. Though clearly embarrassed beyond belief, Leah did exactly as she was told as she ran off towards the bathroom.<br />
A little while later, and Tina was off the phone; it hadn&#39;t been easy, but she finally got a good online school make-up program set up, perfect for Leah&#39;s new daycare environment. <br />
&quot;Tina, I&#39;m done.&quot; Leah&#39;s voice came down just in time, but Tina couldn&#39;t help but notice a hint of distress in her voice. Heading towards the teen&#39;s room, she noticed Leah was actually still in the bathroom. Opening the door, Leah was still standing naked in the shower, looking on the verge of tears as she attempted to cover her chest while urine continued to run down her legs.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know how to make it stop.&quot; She choked out, looking entirely helpless. Tina looked disturbed and confused as she ran towards the girl.<br />
&quot;Why didn&#39;t you use the toilet?&quot;<br />
&quot;The what?&quot; <br />
Tina didn&#39;t even bother continuing her line of questioning, simply grabbing Leah and plopping her onto the toilet as quickly as possible. Drips of pee still ended up splattering onto the floor, but that was easy enough to clean later. Leah gasped in surprise, looking distressed as she was placed on the toilet.<br />
&quot;If you need to go potty, sit on this.&quot; Tina lectured, feeling far more like she was talking to a toddler than a teen. Leah&#39;s distress only deepens.<br />
&quot;Was this always here?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, it&#39;s a-&quot;<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t used to be in diapers before today, so why don&#39;t I remember this?&quot; Tears stream freely down her fear filled eyes, &quot;Why don&#39;t I remember how to do...any of this? I had to have before, right?&quot; <br />
The sound of tinkling came to a close, but Leah didn&#39;t seem remotely happy about it; if anything, the device unnerved her. Dread built up in Tina again as she realized just how badly Leah&#39;s brain was affected.<br />
&quot;Leah, don&#39;t worry about what you don&#39;t remember. As far as you&#39;re concerned, you&#39;re potty training for the first time pretty please.&quot;<br />
Leah&#39;s face immediately softened as her gazed unfocused. Tina didn&#39;t want to do it, but what choice did she have?<br />
&quot;See Leah? You hold your pee and poop, and then release it into the toilet where we can flush it away. This is the potty in potty training.&quot;<br />
The fear had disappeared from Leah&#39;s face, replaced now with curiosity.<br />
&quot;So this is a potty? Alright, that&#39;s good to know.&quot; Her voice sounds weary and distant, like she&#39;s not entirely sure what&#39;s transpiring. <br />
&quot;Yep! All you have to do is learn when you need to go, how to hold it, then make it to a potty to get rid of it properly. Simple, right?&quot;<br />
Leah frowns, but nods.<br />
&quot;Good. Now let&#39;s get you diapered up for bed. You have a busy day tomorrow. I just got off the phone with your school and have your online schooling all set up.&quot;<br />
&quot;Alright.&quot; Once again, her words are distant. She wordlessly follows Tina to her room, where she lays the teen down to diaper her. The distant look disappears and is replaced with shame during the change, which made Tina feel much needed relief.<br />
&quot;So, might I make a request? You need to wear this in place of your regular pajamas.&quot; Tina said as she holds up a onesie. She holds up a hand to stop Leah&#39;s immediate clapback, quieting the teen.<br />
&quot;This won&#39;t just fit over your diaper, but it&#39;ll also make changes much easier.&quot; Tina didn&#39;t want to mention that Leah&#39;s potty training is worse than an infants, and that regardless of how thick her diapers are she&#39;ll more than likely need to be changed throughout the night. She did add &quot;Don&#39;t fight and just go with this pretty please.&quot; And Leah (though incredibly embarrassed and angry) wordlessly grabbed the onesie and put it on. She really did look like a little baby in it, but Tina reminded herself that this was for practical purposes and not self indulgence. <br />
With that, Tina wished Leah good night, and prepared herself for a long haul; she&#39;s never raised a baby, and never thought she&#39;d experience it quite like this. She set an alarm for the middle of the night before going to sleep, hoping that Leah&#39;s diapers would hold. She had pleasant dreams of playing with little babies that quickly turned into a nightmare as an old school teacher lectured; Tina was naked save for a diaper, and being puppeted around by the teacher in front of all her colleagues, who both laughed and jeered. When the alarm woke her up, she was almost grateful. She tiredly made her way to Leah&#39;s room to find...</p>
