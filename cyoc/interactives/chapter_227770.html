<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Even though it was tactically a domesticated dog as it was a mere canine, it looks more like a dachshund suit that it was so amazing to look at. You then thought about as to what kind of person would want to send this out for you that this made you wonder on who could it be from... who indeed, and why?<br />
<br />
Still though, besides the fact it came with a zentai body underwear that the suit itself was a full-body suit with what looks like an extremely uncomfortable stretched out body while it also came with a full-lengthed face with a pair of holes for the eyes as the muzzle was long and hollow inside. The teeth did show in the muzzle, which sat limply for the fact that it also made the costume exactly more believable. The hands did end in paw-like fingers as it certainly did help with the looks while having the use of hands. However, it must of make it prohibitively difficult to do most of anything while wearing it with these claws at the ends for nails. On top of everything else, the latex rubber it was made of was certainly rather shiny that it felt really nice.<br />
<br />
Whoever it was that sent this to you while actually making this for somebody must of been willing to go a pretty good long way to satisfy their kinks, because it must be hot as an oven inside of a domestic dachshund suit in which you&#39;re holding on to. On top of that note, your eyes reluctantly move downwards towards the only area you&#39;ve didn&#39;t investigated just yet as it was the part of the costume where the crotch was at. Unlike the muzzle though that it was apparently solid with what you&#39;d imagine to be a bulge At its base, or so you&#39;ve thought. Thinking that it&#39;s for a men while you thought of how any human being could of have any hopes of filling out this costume was anyone&#39;s guess, but why send this thing out over to you?<br />
<br />
It looks completely hollow, yet you didn&#39;t need to do any imagination to figure out what it was for as you thought that Maybe something else was supposed to help out the area for you then looked back the zentai body wear. You thought that maybe it was meant to go over you first as it was then the dog suit, yet you stopped yourself for you knew why. Realizing your curiosity has you trying to figure something out as to how you&#39;re going to slim your body into a zentai body underwear before the costume could be placed on has made you noticed for this was meant to be worn by another suit first was supposedly understandable that it was for your own protection, while looking good as someone&#39;s anthro pet pooch. Having to be suited on under the costume first that you decided to look back into the box itself in which it came from for it had something it didn&#39;t had while as you&#39;ve noticed this and observed over it again, incase you&#39;ve missed it in which you didn’t.... the return address was gone!<br />
<br />
There was no retune address as of to indicare where it came from, no logo, no text, not even a mailing address for it for There was nothing on it. Whoever delivered this that they must of done it by hand. The thought of it being some kind of a cool joke crossed your mind as it kind of sickened you a bit to feel butterflies in your stomach.<br />
<br />
Looking back at the suit for you then realize that something like this must be custom-tailored, which would possibly explain why someone who wants the suit&#39;s measurementsto your size as it would prove extremely difficult to make. Still, getting the suit&#39;s measurements from you was impossible for you don&#39;t know your own measurements of your body to make this possible as you Then consider that it might be for one of your neighbors. How would they know of your measurements for this doesn&#39;t make sense either, None of them were into those sort of thing to be into stuff like this as you are not sure where this canine suit came from.<br />
<br />
Unless you want to go around and hang up posters to say that you found something of theirs, it looks like you&#39;re stuck with it for awhile. and yet, a part of you wanted to fully keep the suit that thinking it did sounded silly in your head. like it would look better on the community bulletin board as this is what it would of possibly say on the poster flyers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Found: One latex anthromorphic dachshund costume. Something this nice that the owner belonging to this suit also comes with a zentai wear of body underamor.&quot; At least, that&#39;s what it would might of said for you haven&#39;t looked any further to see if it came with accessories.<br />
<br />
So all that&#39;s left now is to figuring out what to do with the costume as you first thought of destroying it, let alone dumping it somewhere. However, somewhere in the back of your mind was telling you not to for it felt uncomfortable to just get rid of the suit. Something about this costume was worth as much must be useful at your job at work you&#39;re in that you also thought about selling it. then again, you might as well just be broadcasting &#39;Hi there, I&#39;M A DOG. WANT TO PLAY WITH A FREAK?&#39; to everybody in the world that&#39;s on the planet.<br />
<br />
You could invite your girlfriend and see how it looks on you while trying on the suit. how cool would that be as she would see you in the outfit for she could start playing with you like you&#39;re her puppy, maybe you&#39;ll be even be more closer to her for being both on a different level in your relationship! Yet you can&#39;t help from thinking back about yesterday&#39;s indecent as she was now scared of them now for You wouldn&#39;t want to put your beloved one in danger with you inside one of a dog suit, but that doesn&#39;t mean she can&#39;t wear one herself. Then again, you wouldn&#39;t want to put your beloved one like that in danger if she can&#39;t get out of the suit for you would never consider it. Would she though?<br />
<br />
The other alternative is to Perhaps... (and this thought makes your head spin) ...perhaps to keep it, but keeping something like this means thatyou might never have the nerve to use it at all. then again, there&#39;s always Halloween as it&#39;s your favorite time of the year. Your clothes would probably not fit over the costume pretty much that easy, much less the zentai body wear anyways. With the one piece outfit though that you might be able to hide the weird stuff down there while showing off the better goods as you might not, if the weird stuff couldn&#39;t be hidden away from public eyes.<br />
<br />
If anyone asks that you could alway say you&#39;ve just so happened to found it cheap at some yard sale while willing to buy it for Halloween use, even wearing it out in the woods of the park for some time as a person who&#39;s into this so called puppy petplay. If it was a bit flimsy that it&#39;s a good enough excuse for the people you know as you then thought of trying it on yourself, just to be safe for everyone else&#39;s sakes. But then, why would it be so dangerous if people are suppose to simply wear it for fun and be silly while wanting to be a dog?<br />
<br />
It did sounded silly now for it wasn&#39;t like it was some kind of evil magic trick that while thinking about the suit now. yet it only leaves you with only just at least one way of questioning in mind Of course as it looked like it came from a kids tv show: how well will this suit actually fit you? Well, there was only one way to find out as.....</p>
