<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Because the oats were so good, you started eating more and more, your face even deeper in that barrel. You continued  stuffing your face until the entire barrel was completely empty of well. Before you moved around to the next one, you raised your hand to your head trying to wipe some sweat off of your forehead. However, something, felt very wrong. Your fingers felt very stiff and they were significantly less mobile to the point where you almost couldn&#39;t move each individual finger by itself. You look down to see brown fur sprouting around your arm near your hand and your fingers were morphing and becoming blacker, making them look more like a hoof. So... you had a hoof now? That didn&#39;t seem right... did it? Were you supposed to have a hoof? You certainly didn&#39;t think so but it just felt right. You looked over to your other hand which was undergoing and similar transformation, finger combining until it looked exactly like the other hand. Yeah, you did have hooves... you always did. What had made you think otherwise? Next, you started to feel something off in your shoes. Wait when did you wear shoes? Of course, you wore shoes, you were a human. And yet... something seemed wrong. You felt like your feet becoming larger and your socks were far too tight. The pressure was too big and eventually, they tore apart. Your slowly lifted one your feet to reveal yet another hoof. You looked at your other foot and sure enough, it had also become and hoof. You frowned. Why were you wearing shoes anyway? They didn&#39;t even fit your hooves, what was wrong with you today? Looking back at yourself, you saw that you still had your clothes on: A grey t-shirt with a pair of jeans. That didn&#39;t make sense... if you were a donkey why would you be wearing clothes? Unless you were actually human but that was ridiculous right? Suddenly, pressure starting building at your rear before your parts were torn apart to reveal a tail. There, you had a tail, humans didn&#39;t have tails so you couldn&#39;t have been human. And to prove your point further, you began to feel the room inside you getting a bit smaller and smaller... like it was growing. Sure enough, your clothes started rip and tear bit by bit until you could get out of them with ease. Of course, you couldn&#39;t remember ever wearing clothes. They were too small for you anyway, you&#39;ll never fit them. With your clothes gone, you started to look around you. A storage room with a seemingly endless amount of oats and you looked back to yourself now on all fours with brown fur and a tail. &quot;Yeah, that feels right&quot; you sighed. But then you frowned. &quot;Feels. hee... heeHAW! HEEHAW!&quot; That felt much better. For a moment, you could have sworn you were speaking English, instead of braying like the donkey you were. Finally, as if to drive your point home, you face changed: Brown fur started grow on it while it elongated out into a muzzle. Your ears began to stretch out as well becoming longer and pointier at the tips. You closed your eyes and open them again, revealing that they had now become dark and beady. Finally, your transformation was over. You look down grinning to yourself. You looked down at your shredded clothes, the last pieces of your humanity now gone. Even you couldn&#39;t remember them being there or wearing there. Every single memory of the human life before this moment vanished from your mind, leaving only the memories of what you were now, a donkey. In return, new memories began filling your mind: working at a salt mines, toiling away in the unbearably hot ground below the earth and pulling crates loaded with material. It was exhausting for you but you knew you could do better. You wouldn&#39;t let a setback like that stop you. You just had to be more hardworking and maybe they&#39;ll even feed you more this time and- Your internal monologue was interrupted by rumbling in your stomach. You were hungry and you moved to the next barrel of oats.<br />
While all while this was happening, a man was looking from outside. &quot;Perfect. All according to plan&quot; he said. Another victim was claimed by Pleasure Island. It&#39;s almost disappointing how easy this was for him. He already had a business booming and thousands of new donkeys for the farmer and miners, one day this island will be able to compete with the big tech companies. He didn&#39;t have to pay any charges for crimes either, the donkeys couldn&#39;t speak and they don&#39;t even remember being human (well, some of them don&#39;t anyway). Smiling, he left the storage area to greet more kids at the beach and get more kids to be turned into more donkeys. You were, of course, oblivious to this. You were too busy eating and you couldn&#39;t understand him anyway. You went back to eating, packing up the energy you&#39;ll need for your next shift at the mines.</p>
