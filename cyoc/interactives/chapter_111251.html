<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nick eagerly sucked and swallowed.  While his mouth and tongue were engaged, he tucked his jockstrap and shorts under his balls, and began to play with his transformed brother with his free hands.   Abs blew his load.  It was huge, and it caught Nick by surprise, as he had never given a blow job to another guy before.  Somehow the copious semen managed to go down Nick&#39;s throat and come up out of his right nostril.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, Nick, you&#39;re not half bad looking, but you could use some accessories.  Damn, your dick is totally naked.  We add a piercing or two, and shave your pubes and you&#39;ll look twice as big.  And the sex is even better with a piercing.  Uh, you wanna start with a barbell or go right to the Prince Albert?&quot;<br />
<br />
Abs pulled Nick up and pulled his shorts and jocks up to trap a hard but unrelieved Jeff- er, penis-inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, um, piercing?&quot; Nick asked uncertainly, as his new friend and master led him by the wrist out of the park to a nearby Piercing & Tattoo Parlor.  &quot;I dunno abou-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Infibulation then,&quot; Abdzaam said knowingly.<br />
<br />
Nick had no idea what that was, but it had to be better than a barbell or Prince Albert through his cock, right?<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, okay, whatever you say, Abs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abdzaam grinned, &quot;Call me Master, boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick pursed his lips like he was going to protest, but he had already become a total sub, whether he knew it or not, yet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy!&quot;<br />
<br />
The shop bell clanged as they entered.  Nick thought it was odd that there would be a Tattoo Parlour and Piercing Salon in the middle of the park, but obviously it was here.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, Aboo, this boy needs an infibulation special, and then we&#39;ll talk about tattooing it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It? Tattooing what?&quot; Nick said nervously looking down at the bulge in his shorts. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, I wasn&#39;t referring to your penis, though I did see one once that looked like a Jack In the Box.  Clown face on the head, and all that.  But not for you.  Maybe something simple across your chest and back?&quot;<br />
<br />
Abdzaam had promised to blow him too.  He remembered, and hissed a whisper in Abdzaam&#39;s ear, &quot;Hey, Master, I still haven&#39;t cum.  You said you were-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hush, boy.  First, the infibulation, then we will talk about you cumming,&quot; he said in a booming voice.<br />
<br />
Nick blushed.<br />
<br />
Aboo laughed, and asked, &quot;Did you want the infibulation to have a lock or welded permanently?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lock?&quot; asked Nick nervously.  What kind of piercing had a lock.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess, he wants the one with the lock, &quot; laughed Abs, &quot;I can always weld it later, if I like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want the cock bent with the head pointing up or down, Affendi?&quot; Aboo asked holding Nick&#39;s cock for Master Abs inspection.  <br />
<br />
Nick wanted to do something, but he was too submissive.  He let the strange guy handle his manhood like it was piece of meat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Down of course, otherwise he&#39;d have to stand on his head to piss-&quot; Abs said and then paused as he visualized it, &quot;Mm- maybe- nah, just point it down.  Too many situations when that could be awkward.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s infibulation?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, silly boy, it&#39;s when we pierce your cock twice with a locking metal piece, so that your cock is bent in a U-shape, so you cannot cum.  It&#39;s the preferred male chastity device these days,&quot; Aboo chortled as he drove a surgical needle through Nick&#39;s doubled over cock.  Jeff wanted to scream. It as over in a few minutes.  Nick was sobbing staring at the metal rod that was padlocked through his painfully bent cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now as to when you will cum again, Nicky, I&#39;m inclined to say not any time soon.  Maybe for your birthday or your brother&#39;s or mine? Or maybe Christmas?  Or maybe in 2025? Hard to say, heh, heh.  That&#39;s a joke, laugh, boy.  Hard to say!  You cannot get hard anymore!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, ha, ha,&quot; Nick said with a forced laugh in obedience to his master&#39;s instruction to laugh. Though the tears continued down his cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve decided on a tattoo - a twelve inch square QR code.  It will take anyone his scans his back to the Slave Registry Website with Nick&#39;s photos and bio on it.  Here&#39;s the website,&quot; Master Abdzaam said instantly holding Aboo&#39;s cell phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want me to take photos, sir?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, need. You can copy the tattoo from the photo,&quot; he said pointing at the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what you want him to look like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, that&#39;s a future photo.  That&#39;s how he will look when you finish your work, Abou!&quot; he sounded exasperated.  Sometimes humans were so dense.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice choice with the tribal tats on his arms and thighs, too.  Oh, and both ears with gold hoop rings and his nose with a matching one. Very stylish, indeed,&quot; Abou said studying the photos on the Slave Website.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tribal tats and gold rings?  Yes, I suppose I would or will or did choose that,&quot; Abs said in an annoyed tone.  He really didn&#39;t like explaining things like this.  If the future photo showed these changes than obviously they were changes he would have chosen. He shook his head. &quot;How long will it take?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s a lot of work. It will be painful, so we will need a few days at least-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not acceptable.  If I freeze him so he feels no pain, could you do it in a hour or two?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose, he will feel no pain?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not while you&#39;re doing it. Just when I unfreeze him,&quot; Abs said with a smile.<br />
<br />
Nick started to open his mouth, and stuck out his tongue to speak, and he froze solid.  He was still conscious, but he couldn&#39;t move or speak. He couldn&#39;t even blink.  A fly landed on his left eye, and began to walk around.  His master laughed. Abou stroked his beard, &quot;Only an hour or two? I&#39;ll see what I can do.&quot;  He sighed, as he looked at the photos.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, as long as his mouth is open, pierce his tongue too,&quot; the genie said.<br />
<br />
As Abou looked at the photos, a new one appeared showing a large round stud in the middle of Nick&#39;s tongue.<br />
<br />
Abou clapped his hands, and two have naked eunuchs appeared to heft the frozen Nick over to the tattoo bench.  The unceremoniously stripped him of his shorts, jockstrap, socks and sneakers as if he were a mannequin in a shop window.</p>
