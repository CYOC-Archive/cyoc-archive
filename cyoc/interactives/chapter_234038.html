<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before I could leave, someone suddenly stopped me by placing his hand on my shoulder. I was quickly spun around to see Caspian, though a lot of people called him Casper or Cas, and occasionally Casanova.<br />
<br />
Caspian moved here from England a few years ago and was one of the most notorious flirts in the school. He had charmed almost every girl in the school and somehow despite frequently getting caught two timing, he always convinced the girls to forgive him.<br />
<br />
He was a good looking guy with black hair and bright blue eyes, though those were hidden behind thick sunglasses. He had decided to dress as a sexy copy, with his shirt open to show off his abbs. &quot;Joey,&quot; he said with remnants of of British accent that had faded slightlyover the years. &quot;Glad I caught you. I know the shows over but do you think you could do one more trick?&quot;<br />
<br />
I sighed. &quot;What do you want Casanova?&quot; I asked him. I typically only called him that when I was annoyed with him, or he was trying to hard to get a girl&#39;s number.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember how I&#39;ve been trying to date Lydia since forever?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lydia, the schools objectively hottest lesbian who you have absolutely zero chance with. Because your a guy.&quot; I paused for a moment. &quot;Also the Lydia who kind of hates you because you can&#39;t take a hint that she isn&#39;t into guys. Which actually isn&#39;t much of a hint she straight up tells you that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cas rolled his eyes. &quot;You didn&#39;t have to put it quite like that, but yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like to be thorough.&quot; I explained. <br />
<br />
&quot;Right, well something strange has happened. For the first time ever, she approached me. Even said she was willing to give me a shot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Considering how out of character that is I&#39;m guessing there is a condition you need my help with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cas blushed a little. &quot;She only dates girls, but since you turned a guy into one earlier tonight...&quot;<br />
<br />
I smirked. &quot;She wants you to be her girlfriend for a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please Joey. I really like her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You like every girl Cas.&quot; I argued.<br />
<br />
&quot;This one&#39;s different.&quot; He argued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, she isn&#39;t into guys.&quot; I thought about it for a moment. &quot;Where is she anyways?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you do it? She wants to see you change me so she&#39;s waiting by the stage.&quot;<br />
<br />
I shrugged. &quot;Fine.&quot; I went with Cas to the stage where Lydia was waiting. Lydia wore a wonder woman costume, one designed after the recent movies. Though her hair was much shorter, barely reaching her shoulders. She had bleached her hair white and had some blue strands mixed in. With the exception of her hair, she made a wonderful recreation of the Amazonian. While Cas was noticeably taller than me, Lydia was almost exactly my height. <br />
<br />
She smiled as we came up. &quot;Here I thought you were all talk when you said you would get Joey. Really planning on slipping into some panties just for a chance to get into mine?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cas smiled. &quot;Hey, you know I never turn a lovely lady down.&quot;<br />
<br />
I starred at them for a second. &quot;Personally, I&#39;m not sure this is going to work out in the long run, so I&#39;m going to add a twist.&quot; I held a curtain from earlier up and then let it fall to the ground. There was now a box, that had two horizontal lines, giving it three section. Each section was blue. &quot;You get to make three changes. Nothing to change him, besides ironing out bad habits. I will only grant them if I think it would help with the relationship. One of them can be turning Cas into Cassie, but you can keep him as a guy if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lydia made a face. &quot;Nope, the dick has to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, besides that I will say that it will be 100% Cas just a few quirks changed. Nothing major. Agree?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Deal.&quot; Lydia declared. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m game.&quot; Cas said opening the front door and entering the box. <br />
<br />
In the top section I wrote boy with a marker I wished up. &quot;Picture your dream girl.&quot; I told Lydia, as I grabbed the top of the panel. The panel folded about half way down. The folded down section was pink, with words girl on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel something changing.&quot; Cas called from within, his voice reaching a higher octave as his spoke.<br />
<br />
Lydia thought for a moment. &quot;Cas is actually cool, but I&#39;d rather him not have such wondering eyes. If he could make him a bit more faithful, so I don&#39;t have to worry so much about Cas with other girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
On the second blue panel, which hid Cas&#39; torso, I wrote lecherous. Grabbing the top, I once again folded it down. Now the panel was pink and said loyal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally, he has a reputation of being a little controlling. From what I heard it isn&#39;t on purpose, he doesn&#39;t seem to know he&#39;s doing it. If you could help him with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
The bottom panel hid Cas&#39; legs. On the blue I wrote Dom. Flipping it down, the final panel now said sub.<br />
<br />
&quot;That wasn&#39;t exactly what I meant.&quot; Lydia told me.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you aren&#39;t exactly against it are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lydia smirked. &quot;Maybe not in the bedroom. She won&#39;t be submissive in her daily life will she?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, this will be just for dating. You will definitely wearing the pants of this relationship.&quot; I looked down at her legs. &quot;Metaphorically speaking.&quot;<br />
<br />
She wacked my shoulder. &quot;Eyes up here buddy. Is my new girlfriend ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
I tapped the top of the box,  and the four walls fell in different directions, with the tip still connected to the back wall. Within was a short busty girl dresses as a slutty cop.<br />
<br />
Her crop top left little of her cleavage to the imagination, and instead of being button, it was tied at the bottom of the shirt, which ended just below the breasts. Her stomach was fully exposed,  as well as a new button piercing with a sparkling red gem in it. Her mini skirt barely came below her butt, and showed off her legs clad in fishnet stocking. She still wore the same police cap, but now she had long raven locks cascading down her her back. She wore bright red lipstick, highlighting her coy smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; she spoke in her new high pitched voice while reaching for her prop handcuffs. &quot;Looks like I held up my end, which means you and I are going to have a talk about your vigilante activities  Wonder Woman.&quot; She swung the cuffs back and for playfully by one finger.<br />
<br />
Lydia smiled and snatched the hand cuffs away from the girl that was now a good bit shorter than her. &quot;Not so fast officer.&quot; She declared as she quickly locked one cuff on her wrist. She started walking behind her, gently bending her arm behind her. &quot;Girl on girl action is my wheelhouse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lydia pulled the girl&#39;s other arm behind her and there was the distinctive click of the other cuff locking. Her shoulders were pulled back, emphasizing her chest. Lydia leaner over and whispered in her ear. &quot;Now Cassie,&quot; she stressed the name. &quot;I&#39;m going to give you a thorough tour of your new anatomy. I&#39;m sure you were planning a one night stand and then asking Joey to turn you back in the morning. But I&#39;m going to give you every reason to stay like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassie blushed, right before Lydia swooped her up in her arms. &quot;Let&#39;s find somewhere private so I can list the reasons to you.&quot; Lydia told her. I was slightly distracted as while Cassie was being princess carried, her skirt drooped down and I could see she was wearing a thong. I somewhat resisted the temptation to stare. &quot;Thanks Joey, see you later!&quot; Lydia told me before carrying off her new girlfriend. <br />
<br />
Cassie looked over Lydia&#39;s shoulders, while her arms were still bound. &quot;Th-thanks Joey.&quot; She said nervously. <br />
<br />
Turning around I noticed a small crowd of a very specific group. Probably everyone who had a request. I wondered if I should grant them or just run.</p>
