<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
The students had lunch once the outbreak was contained. Stan claimed he saw a fully-naked, fully-erect Theramont carry an overgrown Nick to the nurse’s office. Poor Owen had his lunch alone in the yard. He had grown too weary of the many eyes on him as he ate, the now solidified rumour that he was responsible for the latest outbreaks would pierce his ears as he walked past students and teachers alike. They must be true. He’s cursed, his nightmare in detention must’ve happened. He was the one causing all of this chaos. Still, after lunch he put on a brave face and entered Theramont’s office.<br />
<br />
The first thing you’d notice about the office was the smell. It was a strange combination of cheap air freshener and musk. The  office was huge, but empty. Most of Theramont’s belongings were still in their boxes, apart from a few bits and bobs that hung from the walls or stood proudly on his desk. Owen noticed a picture frame neatly placed beside a pile of paperwork. He turned it around to see the school’s swimming team, pre-first outbreak. They all posed on one knee, with Mr Theramont and his husband and ex-swimming coach, Mr Harris, standing centre-stage. The boys and men all wore the same skimpy pair of black speedos. Owen couldn’t help but scoff when he realised the entire swim team were sporting obvious hardons, apart from the two men.<br />
<br />
“HE IS ON TO YOU.”<br />
<br />
Owen heard someone whisper in his ear, but he turned to see he was alone. The voice was soft, like a gentle breeze.<br />
<br />
“YOU MUST NOT LET THEM CATCH YOU.”<br />
<br />
However, before Owen could respond, he heard the office door swing open. Theramont strode towards his desk chair, drying his wet hair with a towel. His shirt clung to his dripping skin, as Owen tried to avoid staring at the outline of the man’s abs. Theramont sat down, spreading his legs wide as he tucked himself into his desk. He spoke with a soft but deep tone as he placed his Walker-talkie on his desk.<br />
<br />
“Sit down Owen.”<br />
<br />
Owen did so without speaking as Theramont fetched a notepad and a pen from one of his drawers. Theramont sighed as he flicked to the first blank page he could find. Owen’s heart began to beat faster.<br />
<br />
“How’s Nick? Is he-“<br />
“Nick is fine. He’s in quarantine getting the vaccine. Tony OK too, albeit a little sore. <br />
“That’s a relief.”<br />
“Do you know why you’re here?”<br />
<br />
Theramont’s bright blue eyes stared directly at Owen.<br />
<br />
“N-no.”<br />
“Well, I thought I’d just ask you a few questions. You see, this school only re-opened a week ago, and since then we’ve had 3…well let’s say infections. All of which you were there for. That mixed with what Nick said, you can understand why I would be suspicious.”<br />
“I understand.”<br />
“You can see why I would suspect you.”<br />
“HE IS ON TO YOU.”<br />
The voice sounded harsher, meaner. Owen tried to ignore it.<br />
<br />
“S-Suspect me?”<br />
“The first outbreak was because a bunch of students put what we now know as RGX-10 in the school’s water supply.”<br />
“But Sir i didn’t put anything in the water.”<br />
“Are you sure?”<br />
<br />
Theramont scratched one of his armpits absent-mindedly, as a waft of his musk traveled across the room. After a long pause his stare immediately stopped as he put his pen down. <br />
<br />
“Very well. It’s probably just coincidental. I don’t want you to think you’re cursed or anything like that.”<br />
“Maybe I am.”<br />
“Owen, you’re not cursed. Just unlucky. You know if it happens again I’m here to protect you boys. That, and teach Biology.”<br />
<br />
He let out a chuckle.<br />
<br />
“GO ON. TEST IT.”<br />
<br />
The voice mimicked Theramont’s laugh silently in Owen’s ear. Owen went to leave, only to stop near the office door. The voice was right. He needed to be certain he was the cause, and there was only one way to find that out.<br />
<br />
“Sir?”<br />
“Yes lad?”<br />
“Um…”<br />
<br />
He took a few steps towards Theramont’s desk and awkwardly reached out for a handshake.<br />
<br />
“Thank you.”<br />
“It’s no trouble at all.”<br />
<br />
His beast of a teacher rose from his chair and leant over his desk, gently shaking Owen’s hand. The man smiled warmly. Then, it happened again. Another shock rattled in their fingers. Theramont quickly pulled his hand away.<br />
<br />
“Huh, that’s weird.”<br />
“Must be a storm coming Sir.”<br />
“Pardon?”<br />
“Usually before a storm you feel electric shocks, like on handrails.”<br />
“That’s very true. Anyway, you’d better get to your next class.”<br />
<br />
Theramont hunched down to grab something in one of the desk drawers. The voice plagued Owen’s mind again.<br />
<br />
“THERE. TAKE IT.”<br />
<br />
He could see Theramont’s walkie-talkie on the desk. Owen silently swiped it, and tucked it discreetly into his backpack. The teacher sat back up in his chair. Owen tried to stall, studying his new test subject very closely. <br />
<br />
“Can I ask you a question Sir?”<br />
“Sure, fire away.”<br />
“Well…”<br />
<br />
Owen sat back down.<br />
<br />
“…I was just wondering, with this mutation…”<br />
<br />
He could hear Theramont’s breathing grow slightly louder.<br />
<br />
“…Sir, what does it feel like?”<br />
“Feel like?”<br />
<br />
The teacher was almost taken aback by the question. He thought for a moment before answering.<br />
<br />
“It feels…different.”<br />
“How different?”<br />
“Something you’ve never felt before. That raw power. It’s like- is it really hot in here or is it just me?”<br />
<br />
He stood up and walked to the window, pushing it open. That was when he stopped in his tracks, gazing down his ripped body. That voice came back, whispering into Owen’s ear. It sounded incredibly giddy.<br />
<br />
“IT’S WORKING. WATCH.”<br />
<br />
Owen began to feel worried as Theramont continued standing there in silence. <br />
<br />
“You OK Sir?”<br />
“Yeah. I’m fine. I thought I-“<br />
<br />
And then, right on cue, he exhaled loudly as his package grew. Not only was he getting hard, but his cock was growing bigger. He placed both his hands to cover it up as he made his way back to the desk. Owen notice the man’s biceps had grown slightly as well, audibly straining the fabric of his already skintight sleeves. The yellow armband around his muscly arm tore off, falling to the ground.<br />
Theramont isn’t one to panic, and so immediately scrambled for the walkie-talkie in his desk. However, his searching became more and more frantic as he tried to find the blasted thing.<br />
<br />
“Oh God, where is it?”<br />
“Sir, your….”<br />
<br />
Owen pointed at Theramont’s chest. As he opened the last drawer in his desk, he stopped momentarily to stare down at his pecs, which had begun to expand further outwards. They bounced playfully as they swelled out. Theramont’s breathing became heavier. His legs had grown a few inches too, making the man almost a foot taller than Owen. By this point Theramont had given up in concealing his throbbing cock which tried to rip its way through his trousers. He groaned as the fabric grinded against its shaft. As it thickened to an impressive size, the teacher’s mind was already starting to become corrupt to his hormonal urges. The man’s booming voice was lower, somehow.<br />
<br />
“Where is it?!”<br />
<br />
Owen almost leapt back in shock as Theramont flipped the desk, sending everything hurtling to the floor. The man had reached 7ft, yet the transformation had only just begun. His shirt barely covered his abs, which were now shrouded in a layer of hair and sweat. The shirt buttons wouldn’t hold for much longer. Owen forgot how terrifying, yet incredibly arousing witnessing something like this was. Now Theramont’s voice sounded more like growling from a beast. A beast driven by lust.<br />
<br />
“Owen, get help. I don’t know how much longer I can hold off before I-“<br />
<br />
As he grew taller again, his belt popped off his widening waist, hitting the wall with impressive force. His cock was almost as big as Owen’s arm, and it showed no sign of slowing down. The boy could see Theramont using all of his mental strength to not touch it. However,Owen decided to stay, almost in shock at how big his biology teacher was getting. Much larger than Ben, or even Nick.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing? Get out of here!”<br />
POP!<br />
<br />
One of Theramont’s shirt buttons shot off his torso as it expanded. Then, another one followed shortly after. And another. Eventually only one lone button struggled to shroud the man’s giant chest in fabric. His shirt was already considerably tight. Now, it looked comically small on him.<br />
<br />
“Why are you still here?!”<br />
POP!<br />
<br />
The last button shot straight towards Owen, whizzing past his head. Theramont’s pecs practically exploded through his shirt as he inhaled deeply. A wide grin slowly formed on his face as he moved his hands eagerly over his chest.<br />
<br />
“Oh God, I forgot how good that felt.”<br />
<br />
He was too lost in pleasure to care anymore. His trousers looked more like shorts, riding high above his calves. The boy’s eyes were fixed on Theramont’s glorious third leg that was eager to be released. Theramont couldn’t hold it in any longer, his once calm and professional attitude quickly replaced with a desperate urge to cum. Just as he reached for his trousers, he moaned loudly as he grew almost a foot in seconds. His shoes eventually gave in, as his humongous feet burst free. His thighs ballooned, pushing the trousers beyond their limits. They couldn’t hold forever, as with a magnificent tear they crumbled away from Theramont’s now almost 8ft tall body. His boxers quickly followed, as Theramont’s monstercock was finally free, springing straight up towards the ceiling. The walls shook as the man wrapped his fingers around his rod and pumped it with tremendous force. His balls swung as he jerked off, gradually getting bigger until they were the size of basketballs. Precum dribbled from his cock, dripping onto the floor. Owen saw this as his cue to leave, but as he made his way towards the door, he felt a huge shadow envelop him and the office door.<br />
<br />
“COME HERE BOY!”<br />
<br />
Theramont’s voice was unrecognisable, as it sounded like that of a God. The comparatively tiny boy turned his thin body to see Theramont lunge towards him, his cock like a jousting spear. The giant man pressed his sweaty torso against Owen, who had no choice but to wrap his limbs around his teacher, and sit on his shaft. The man’s cock throbbed underneath Owen’s ass. The student suddenly felt an intense electric shock from his entire body as Theramont roared with pleasure at the feeing of the teen against his raging hardon. Owen felt the man’s sweat drench his shirt, his intense body beat quickly making the office as hot as a sauna. The boy looked up with wide eyes and met Theramont’s gaze. The same piercing blue eyes stared back. The ruckus died down, with only the sounds of Theramont’s slow, huge breaths filling the room. Then, the voice returned, laughing unctrollably as it spoke.<br />
<br />
“HOLD ON.”<br />
<br />
Owen followed without asking why, and tightened his grip around his teacher, pressing his face against one of his pecs. Theramont held his breath, and there was silence, until-<br />
<br />
“ARGHHHH!”<br />
<br />
Theramont let out a might bellow as he grew taller again, at a much faster rate than Owen has ever seen. As he rose towards the ceiling, so did the cock between Owen’s legs. The boy was then lifted off the ground, still clinging onto his teacher, who was experiencing one of the most intense orgasms he has ever had. The man stumbled away from the wall, almost collapsing onto the floor from his new height. He flexed his arms as more muscle was packed onto them. He was in awe of his physique, and yet he was nowhere near finished.<br />
<br />
As his pecs pushed even further out, and his shoulder broadened immensely, Owen could feel his hands begin to slip away. Theramont’s body was soaking with his sweat, causing Owen to slide off, landing on the floor. The teacher didn’t even notice, as he kept on growing upwards and outwards. His cock was reaching Owen’s size. Owen quickly got back onto his feet and ran for the door. He practically kicked it down, jumping into the empty corridor, and slammed the office door shut. There, complete silence. Someone waking past wouldn’t even know what was happening on the other side of that door.<br />
<br />
Owen panted, his clothes soaked with Theramont’s sweat. The musk filled his nose as he tried to hold his shirt shut. Drops of sweat fell from his hair and onto the tiled floor. Then, the bell rang loudly, as the doors to the classrooms opened, and students began to pour into the corridor. The voice had stopped laughing by, but still spoke as if it was grinning.<br />
<br />
“You have the power. Go for it!”<br />
<br />
Owen’s face contorted into a smile.</p>
