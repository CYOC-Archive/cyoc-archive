<br />
Jeff was out for 9 hours. He transformed himself at a little after noon on a Friday afternoon. His parents were gone for the weekend, so he had until sometime Sunday evening to make everything right once he transforms back into his normal self. It is also the middle of July, so there&#39;s still a little bit of day light left by 9:00 pm. He&#39;s still a donkey for another 14 hours, and he&#39;s still stuck in his door frame. Oddly enough, the chronivac must have changed JUST enough of his brain into a donkey, as he has the ability to sleep while standing. It was also demonstrated with his rather quick ability to learn to walk on four legs earlier. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jeff&#39;s 13 year old boy&#39;s brain begins to wake up. He yawns: &quot;eeerrrrrrggghh aaawwwww.&quot; Still unable to make any sort of human-like noise.<br />
<br />
His mind was a confusion of nightmares. He had turned himself into a donkey mostly by accident, using a powerful computer program. He didn&#39;t really believe it would work. <br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t just turn him into a regular donkey, but an old, giant, fat, disgusting, horny jack. And he couldn&#39;t do even the simplest of tasks, such as opening a door without a great struggle. He eventually managed to open his bedroom door, then tried to go through. He quickly discovered just how massive his new body was. He struggled to force himself through the doorway, only to get stuck. And worst of all, he had the hormones of a large fat very male breeding animal. <br />
<br />
What a silly dream, he thought. Stretching his arms, he began to stir himself. <br />
<br />
*END INTERMISSION*<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s strange. My arms and hands are very still. I can&#39;t even move my fingers.&quot;<br />
<br />
He brayed out loud, instead of speaking to himself, like he intended to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hhhhaaaaaawwww eeerrrrrggghhh hhhaaaaeww eeeerrggghhh hhaaaaww.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, my mouth tastes like sour cotton, and my tongue is strangely swollen up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eeerrrrrggghhh hhhaaaaeww eeeerrggghhh hhaaaaww,&quot; he brayed some more. <br />
<br />
He finally opens his eyes, but he&#39;s strangely blind. He can&#39;t see! Everything is very dark! <br />
<br />
You&#39;ll remember that he now has the eyeball structure of a donkey. His eyesight isn&#39;t anywhere near as sharp as his young human eyesight was. Worse, he couldn&#39;t make out any colors. Everything was mostly all washed out in muddled grays, whites, and blacks. Being a little after 9:00 pm, even if it is daylight savings time in the middle of summer with some daylight left, it was definitely darker than it was at high noon. He also never turned on any lights in the house. Further, he&#39;s facing into his family&#39;s hallway rather than having the advantage of a window with some light streaming in. Therefore, everything was mostly pitch-black to him. He could see a shadow; a darker black in front of him on the floor. That would be the shadow of his smelly, obese donkey body being cast into the hallway before him. <br />
<br />
He was also having the odd experience of thinking he was waking up in the morning. But it&#39;s still evening on the same day he got himself into this mess. Which added to his confusion. <br />
<br />
The next thing he noticed was an odd, sharp, pungent smell emanating from somewhere. It had the smell of ammonia mixed with rotting fish. Little did he know, donkeys are known to have a bit of an incontinence problem, especially as they age into their middle adult years. The ammonia-rotting fish he was smelling was a combination of two different types of fluids that flowed out of his engorged male privates. One type while he was awake and aware. The second type while he was knocked out. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell IS that smell!?&quot; he attempted to say out loud. Instead, he brayed once again. Which was the next thing he noticed. He brayed! <br />
<br />
&quot;Eeerrggghh hhhaaaww, eeeerrggghhh hhhaaaww!!!&quot; &quot;I can&#39;t speak! I sound like an obnoxious…..DONKEY!&quot;<br />
<br />
Beginning to panic, he attempted to say &quot;oh god, oh god, oh god&quot; over and over again. Instead, all he could manage still is &quot;eeerrggghh hhhaaaww, eeeerrggghhh hhhaaww, eeerrrrrggghhh hhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaawwwww!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
As he began to panic, once again his donkey-sized hormones began to stir deep within him. He felt the familiar stretching of his penis, as it came pointing out of its black velvety sheath of a home. Which caused him to panic even more, as he knew what was coming next. The more he panicked, the hornier he got. <br />
<br />
He wanted to grab onto something with his hands and fingers. But of course, donkey hooves cannot grab onto anything in that manner. Something he constantly seemed to forget. He was on four legs with his assinine obese body stuck in the frame of his doorway between his bedroom and the hall. <br />
<br />
Desperately, he dug in with all four legs to push himself forward in great panic. Still thinking of his front legs as arms and his hooves as hands, he instinctively reached back with his right &quot;arm&quot; and managed to get that hoof on the wall behind him and to the right. Using his hind legs, he pushed with all of his incredibly powerful might. Braying very loudly and very long with each powerful breath he took into his huge donkey lungs. <br />
<br />
There was a loud &quot;CRACK!&quot; It barely registered with him. He gave a second mighty push, and &quot;CRASH! SMASH! BANG!!!&quot; went his entire door frame! <br />
<br />
He flew forward rapidly, instinctively trying to catch himself with his left foreleg. But that leg slid inward, underneath him, and &quot;BOOM!&quot; Went his massive 750 pound beastly body on his left side. <br />
<br />
Luckily for him, donkeys are more resilient physically than humans. But then again, if he wasn&#39;t a donkey, this wouldn&#39;t have happened to him in the first place. So maybe not so lucky afterall. <br />
<br />
Lying on his side for a few minutes, trying to gather his thoughts in shock as his panic seemed to subside for the moment, he was lying in the puddle of his own extra-pungent piss he unknowingly and unwittingly let go while he was asleep. Not at all aware that he was soaking it all up in his fur and skin.<br />
<br />
Eventually, he decided to gather himself up. Without conscience, he tried to stand up like how you would as a human lying on your left side. He tried to put his right hand onto the ground close to his chest to push himself up into a standing position. Of course, what he intended to do and what he actually did were two entirely separate things. Instead of being able to nimbly get his scrawny little teenage boy hand on the ground, his right foreleg sorta….flopped up and down, and he kicked it backward; almost like a dog dreaming while it&#39;s asleep. <br />
<br />
He tried bringing his right &quot;arm&quot; forward again, but bashed a hoof attached to a leg against the hallway wall in front of him instead. He then immediately brayed like the jackass he constantly seemed to forget that he was; mostly due to the lingering confusion of his surprising awakening in such a terrifying position. <br />
<br />
He came to the realization, yet again, that he can only make the noises of the jackass that he was; at the same time he realized he no longer had any arms, hands, or fingers. Instead, he has HOOVES and LEGS. But he could still &quot;feel&quot; his fingers there, even as he realized they&#39;re hooves instead. Which caused him to &quot;feel&quot; that his &quot;fingers&quot; were strangely constricted and &quot;frozen&quot; inside of something hard and immoveable. <br />
<br />
All of this happened over the course of about 5 seconds. His realization of his inability to speak, the bodily structure of his legs and hooves, and his feeling of his &quot;hands&quot; being &quot;trapped&quot; inside of a hard, immoveable substance. <br />
<br />
Which then sent him into a second building panic. Meanwhile, the powerful male donkey testosterone was already flowing pretty good from his first panic attack since he awoke 10 minutes earlier. His large black donkey penis was still hanging out of its home.<br />
<br />
Lying there on his left side in his own piss and spunk with splintered pieces of a wooden door frame all around him, thinking about his situation just described, his anxiety levels were rising rapidly. He began to panic, feeling utterly trapped inside of this foreign smelly body. Which spiked his hormones to new levels. His dick began demanding attention, as it was at full mast and bouncing up and down. Even if Jeff didn&#39;t give it his full attention, his male donkey baby batter was already roiling inside of him like lava inside an angry volcano getting to blow it&#39;s top in magnificent display. Only this event wouldn&#39;t be described as &quot;magnificent&quot; by any stretch of the imagination. Least of all, by the former teenage boy named &quot;Jeffrey.&quot; <br />
<br />
And so it happened. For the third time! Only this time, due to his position of lying on his left side inside the hallway, his massively gigantic black donkey dick was pointing towards his head about a half a foot &quot;below&quot; his lower jaw. <br />
<br />
That same dick exploded in a not-so-magnificent display of anger, frustration, and entrapment. The foul almost yellowish sticky substance blew towards his jaw, coating the lower part of the snout. It blew a second time in rapid succession, with some it managing to coat his black rubbery lips. And a third time, creeping even further up his snout and on his nose holes. And a fourth time, slightly less powerful than the first three. This time, only managing to coat his white furry neck. And a fifth time, slightly less powerful still, coating his white furry belly. The orgasm slowly subsided with each bounce, until his dick found its home again. For the time being. <br />
<br />
During this process, Jeff was braying loudly deep in his throat over and over again. EEEERRRRGGGHHHH HHHHAAAWWWWW EEEERRRRRGGGGHHHH HHHHHAAAAWWWW EEEEERRRRGGGHHHHH EEEERRRRGGGHHHH HHHHAAAWWWWW EEERRRRGGGHHH HHHHHAAAAWWWW!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
As this latest attack subsided, he stuck his dry cottony tongue out to lick his itchy nose and his even dryer black rubbery lips. Only, they weren&#39;t so dry. His tongue came away coated in his yellowish donkey seed! &quot;Was that my own spunk!?&quot; He thought. He instinctively licked again and found an even &quot;juicier&quot; spot. He may have thought the rotten fish smell was nasty. But that was nothing, compared to this new horrendous experience! <br />
<br />
He realized what he just did! He licked his own spunk multiple times! He then ingested the stuff! And &quot;his&quot; spunk, is that of a donkey, which wasn&#39;t him. A donkey body his brain just happened to unnaturally inhabit! It&#39;s as if he just decided to swallow a bucket of a random jackass&#39;s cum rather than his own! Like the guys did on….well….Jackass! Licking and swallowing his own human cum as himself would have been bad enough. But this!?<br />
<br />
The thought made him retch. Not just the thought, but how it felt on his tongue and even worse, the nasty taste of it! One small miracle, is that equines cannot throw up. So he sorta &quot;gagged,&quot; but he didn&#39;t have to deal with yet a different sort of bodily fluid from this horrendous body. <br />
<br />
As he lay there sorta &quot;gagging,&quot; he also began to &quot;cry.&quot; But as said before, donkeys cannot shed tears. All he could do is llie there making pitiful high-pitched irritating brays. Just as irritating as a bagpipe. &quot;Hhheee haawww hheeee haaawww hhheee hhhaaaww hhheeeee hhhaaawwww hhheeee hhhaaawwww hhheeee hhhaaaww hhheeeee hhhaaa.&quot; <br />
<br />
He closed his eyes, and went back to sleep again. All of this episode took a bit under an hour all told. So it isn&#39;t even 10:00 at night. So he still has a bit over 13 hours left of this humaliating, disgusting horror.</p>
