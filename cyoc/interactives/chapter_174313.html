<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate heard the loud beep of the phone as he dialed a 9, holding it in front of him like a glowing weapon to ward off the unwanted laughter of his flat-mate. He let out his breath, deflating audibly and visibly a look of confused disappointment on his face. Looking from his phone, to Aidan, nothing had happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;So uh... you calling for more diapers?&quot; Aidan giggled and kept looking at Nate, meeting his eyes with obvious mirth on his face. He wasn&#39;t being mean, just playfully teasing. He genuinely thought Nate was playing some kind of prank still, and it was written on his face. Nate however was a bit confused. &quot;That should have worked&quot; was all he said. He turned his phone off and let his arm drop to his side, feeling disappointed.<br />
<br />
Aiden stood and clicked off the background noise of the TV in a smooth motion, unfolding his fit smooth blonde body from the sofa. He only had on his gym shorts, and Nate could see his attractive abs and chest, even the contour of his calves was nice. Aidan noticed though, and cleared his throat. Nate quickly snapped his gaze back up to meet his eyes. Oops, caught creepin on the roomy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey man, look I...&quot; Aidan cut off and made a sour face like he had just been pinched. He let out a long sigh, and instead of finishing what he was about to say he grabbed the sides of his gym shorts and moaned loudly. Nate&#39;s eyebrows rose in surprise and he took a step back, expecting Aidan was going to be sick. His first thought was that he was doubling over to barf, moaning like that, and then his shock changed immediately.  Aidan did not vomit, but instead pulled his shorts down and stood back up, his face pinched as he felt something new and alien happening to him.<br />
<br />
Nate looked at his friend&#39;s crotch, and all at once a smile broke across his face. It was happening. It just wasn&#39;t instant like he expected. But how stupid he was to think it would be. It wasn&#39;t instant for him either. He knew exactly what Aidan was going through now though, and Nate played idly with the front of his own diaper as he watched the transformation overtake Aidan who moaned again and thrust his hips forward almost spastically.<br />
<br />
Between his legs his dick had turned completely white. The skin was growing smooth and shiny as he grew more and more erect, pointing straight up to the ceiling, and then his dick pressing hard in to his own abdomen. It swelled a little, flatten out and slowly spreading left and right at the same time. The familiar diaper smell came to Nate&#39;s nostrils, perfumed baby powder and plastic, as he watched wide eyed with excitement while Aidans balls begin to swell. His plastic diaper was stretching to cover him, swelling with soft padded filling, creeping between his legs and up his ass. <br />
<br />
As if on queue on Aidan looked down and gasped at what he saw, spinning around to look at his own back side and giving Nate a great view of his perfect butt. The white plastic stretched and pulled between his legs, growing up his butt and causing Aidan to moan again with the mixture of pleasure and sensation of pressure and stretching covering his whole crotch all at once. He could feel himself becoming cotton, and plastic, and little tape popping in to place at the sides of his hips. He could feel his dick somehow becoming this new diaper, just like Nate was wearing. He let out another little sigh as the sensations all overwhelmed him, both hands finally going to the front of his diaper and pressing in to the plastic and cotton he grunted once feeling the newness of it.<br />
<br />
Then it stopped. The sensations all at once ended and he felt normal, although he did have a handful of plastic. Slowly Aidan let go and looked up at his roommate. He stood silently, naked except for a white plastic diaper, and now Aidan had one too. He looked down again, and at the back of his head a thought came to him &quot;I want to wear and use diapers&quot; it said, in his voice. He grinned, because he did, and he knew he hadn&#39;t before this moment. Then he told himself to process that thought later. First thing is first. Don&#39;t pay attention to the sense of satisfaction you have when you hear your diaper crinkle, or the feeling of the padding in your crotch. I can come back to that when there is time, he thought.<br />
<br />
Next to his foot where his gym shorts had sat on the floor, was now a white perfectly folded plastic rectangle. He recognised it as another diaper. Where did that come from? What was going on here? Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you just do?&quot; He said, and looked at Nate again meeting his eyes. Not mad, just upset and confused. Nate could already tell Aidan was indeed slightly younger than before, about 20, just like him.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m... wearing a diaper. You are wearing- urgh&quot; He pulled at the waist a little, thinking only to adjust it or maybe tug at it to make a point. He found it was stuck fast. &quot;Wait a second...&quot; He looked down again and pulled at it. Stuck. It wouldn&#39;t budge. He struggled comically for a minute with the hips and then again grabbed a handful of the padded front and back hopping from leg to leg. &quot;Fuck! It won&#39;t come off. Of course. You did this didn&#39;t you?&quot;  He looked back up at Nate. He had been wide eyed at first, but now his face said something else. He looked, happy, satisfied. Excited.</p>
