<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Feeling power beginning to course through his veins, emanating from his very core, Marty grinned sinisterly as he held back... wanting to put some distance between himself, Eric, Tammy and Cindy. As he slowed his gait, letting them get way ahead, Marty could see that Eric seemed a bit distraught... as if the distance between the couple affected Eric. The thing that he found was interesting was that it only seemed to affect Eric, while Tammy and Cindy went about their business as usual. To them, nothing was different, yet something clearly was. Marty had no idea what &quot;The Powers That Be&quot; chose for him, but he could tell that whatever it was was incredibly powerful. It felt as though the universe would bend at his whim... as if he were a god. Thinking about being a god, being all powerful to do as he pleased when he pleased excited and aroused him, causing his meager cock to stir in his pants and push against the fabric. Marty, being the curious sort stopped to evaluate the world around him, he immediately realized that his body was slightly different... along with the sense of immense power. Curiously, Marty checked himself out and first noticed that his fingers were slightly different. His nails were dark, looking as if the keratin had thickened a bit, which made them look darker. Another thing Marty noticed was that his fingernails had grown a bit longer and developed a very slight curl to them. Grinning, he looked both of his hands over and realized that the growth was like claws, yet more human than animal. Curious about the rest of himself, Marty ran his tongue along his teeth and noticed that his bicuspids were not only longer, but sharper... yet only slightly. This excited him even more and had an idea about what he was becoming, but he knew that his ears would be enough to clearly state, with a high level of certainty, his newer form. Again, curiously and hesitantly, Marty raised his hands toward his ears and felt the formation of the cartilage. As he felt around, Marty became slightly dismayed as it was business as usual, but as he reached the middle and top... his heart leapt with joy, but the joy was sinister and dark. Without being able to see them, going on feel alone, Marty knew he had hybridized wolf and human ears. The bottom of the ear was normal, but as it hit the middle... it bent backward slightly and the tip came to a slight point. Instantly, he knew that &quot;The Powers That Be&quot; chose him to be a werewolf... though he wasn&#39;t just any werewolf. No... he was a werewolf god... one he could tell was a bastion for evil. Marty grinned sinisterly, knowing he was to bring humanity... weak and pathetic humanity... to their knees and usher in a new race to dominate, control and rule over humanity to protect the planet from their destructive habits.<br />
<br />
Marty wanted to play with his new and assumed form, though he knew that he didn&#39;t really know what he was. Though, Marty knew there was only one way to tell. As the group walked on, Eric hung back more and more, gaining space from the girls while getting closer to Marty. Seeing this, Marty grinned and looked around the rest of the mall, noticing that all of the men in the building regardless of age appeared to be slightly transfixed on his presence. It seemed as all of them had a desire to be by him as if he had become the queen insect of a hive mind. With Eric being a good friend of Marty&#39;s, he wanted to explore his newer self with Eric first. Marty stopped and looked directly at Eric who had turned to face him and walked toward him... albeit slowly and hesitant. Marty smiled and raised his slightly clawed hand up to Eric, then motioned with a single clawed finger for Eric to come closer to him. Seeing the signal, not wanting to waste any more time, Eric hustled and came up to Marty with haste.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Marty!&quot; Eric said gleefully as his eyes scanned Marty over, which only made Marty grin more, feeling his dark powers grow more from the attention and admiration.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Eric!&quot; Marty replied, sounding as excited as Eric was, only to keep Eric under his power in case it was only fleeting. &quot;I see you left your girlfriend and Cindy to be closer to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I-I just didn&#39;t feel right with you trailing so far behind. You are my friend, I didn&#39;t want to abandon you or...&quot; Eric said trailing off while kicking his feet side to side like a timid child not wanting to admit to something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or what Eric?&quot; Marty asked with a bit of dominance, power and control to the tone of his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be far from you.&quot; He said confidently.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t want to be far from me?! Why don&#39;t you elaborate for me buddy?&quot; Marty said playfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... being around you... you make me feel good, strong and powerful. I can&#39;t explain it, but that&#39;s just how I feel. Also... lately I have been having a lot of homosexual thoughts about you. You and I are typically together. You are in control... dominating me and making me do things that not only I never thought I would do with another man, but you made me feel amazing. I can&#39;t tell you how many times I have gotten off in my sleep to these highly erotic dreams.&quot; Eric admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh really? You like me dominating and controlling you in your sexual fantasy dreams?&quot; Marty asked, cocking his head to the side curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I love it actually. It&#39;s like you became something like a protector, a savior... something strong and powerful, but I don&#39;t know exactly what it is.&quot; Eric explained further.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... sounds like you have a thing for me Eric. Do you want to go somewhere more private and we can play out one of your fantasies?&quot; Marty asked with a sinister grin, feeling his power intensifying as though it were coursing through his veins to allow him to control and manipulate the world around him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Marty... oh fuck yes!&quot; Eric said in a slutty whisper.<br />
<br />
Marty chuckled briefly, taking notice of how dark and sinister it sounded, which he enjoyed immensely. Wanting to see exactly what he was capable of, Marty focused on the area nearby and thought about a family bathroom being in the same nearby hallway as the men&#39;s and women&#39;s room. He thought about how big and spacious it would be with comfortable seating and massive mirrors to be able to ensure that those who gazed upon it wouldn&#39;t look like a mess. As he looked at the space, it didn&#39;t seem to have changed at all, but Marty motioned for Eric to follow as the girls had completely disappeared and were none the wiser that they had just lost their ride. Side by side Marty and Eric walked down the moderately wide, cement block hallway that led to the restrooms. Sure enough... between both the men&#39;s and women&#39;s room was a family restroom. Before Marty celebrated, he had to be inside with Eric to check everything out and once they were inside with the door closed and locked behind him, Marty definitely celebrated. The room was just as massive as he envisioned it, furnished exactly how he wanted and was big enough to allow a large family of over six to be comfortable inside while whoever needed to could do their business while not feeling awkward or rushed. Nearly jumping for joy on the balls of his feet, Marty gleefully squealed a bit as Eric looked at him in confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say Marty... why are you so happy?&quot; Eric asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... well... as my memory serves... this bathroom never existed here. It was just a men&#39;s and women&#39;s room with a janitor closet in the middle.&quot; Marty explained very matter of factly.<br />
<br />
Confused, Eric&#39;s eyebrows furled. &quot;Um... no it hasn&#39;t. This has always existed here for as long as the mall has been open and that happened like ten years ago. Are you feeling alright?&quot; He asked in the end, concerned for his buddy&#39;s health.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I am fine. Come to think of it... it&#39;s been a while since I have been to this mall and I guess I just forgot.&quot; Marty said, explaining it all the way to disarm the slightly younger male.<br />
<br />
Even though Marty knew that what he said was the truth, to Eric the world had changed to fit how Marty made it. Reality itself could be bent to his will, which was amazing and awesome all at the same time. Wanting more, enticed to bring his power out fully and delve into the more evil and sinister being he was made to be from not heeding Stan&#39;s words, Marty focused on himself and willed the evil forward. Though, Marty only eased his physical appearance to be only slightly more demonic and making it so Eric would be witness to his changing form without thinking it was normal for Marty to be how he would look. With a few strides toward the large and full sized body mirror, Marty focused on himself and willed his dark form to manifest only slightly. As he did, Marty could feel the evil power within him come closer to the forefront of his being while his body had yet to manifest any changes.</p>
