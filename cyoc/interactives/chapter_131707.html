<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">During the spring breeding season, those Animalian females who went into heat at this time tended to think about mating quite a lot. There were those who resisted the urge because they weren&#39;t ready to have kids or already had enough of their own to deal with. And then were those who gave in completely to their instincts.<br />
<br />
Martha Kenward wasn&#39;t sure if sex had ever been this vigorous before. Oh, she and Robbie have had sex plenty of times, but now there was a moral primal urge that had never felt stronger. One night, as Martha was on her hands and knees with Robbie taking her from behind, Martha felt less like herself than usual. Instead of her lusty moans as Robbie drove his thick rod into her pussy, she was letting out yips and whines like a real vixen in heat. And her few thoughts that were unrelated to mating were thinking about catching some dinner, maybe a mouse or two to eat.<br />
<br />
Then Robbie made one last thrust and Martha howled, or at least the equivalent of a howl for a red fox. Another load of seed was sent deep into her hungry womb. Robbie panted and said, &quot;I think I&#39;m just about done for tonight.&quot; However, Martha only made whining sounds as she squirmed on his knot, eager for more. Robbie gave Martha a concerned look and asked, &quot;Martha? Martha, are you listening?&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha blinked, the catlike pupils in her eyes widening as more rational thought returned. &quot;What just happened?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve heard that some Animalians revert to primal instinct when they&#39;re in the midst of mating,&quot; said Robbie, &quot;It&#39;s nothing to worry about. I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s remained feral much longer past climax.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha rubbed her head and said, &quot;It was weird, I was thinking like a real vixen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are a real vixen. Well, with some extra features,&quot; said Robbie, playfully groping Martha&#39;s breast.<br />
<br />
Martha gave a soft croon before snapping herself back to reality. &quot;Robbie, how long does it take for a vixen to get pregnant. I mean, would she know right away?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re asking the wrong guy,&quot; said Robbie, &quot;My mother left me while I was still a kit. I still don&#39;t know what happened to her. Anyways, I was still a kit before I was uplifted so I don&#39;t have experience about wild mating habits. Besides, I am a male, so I wouldn&#39;t even know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It feels like we&#39;ve been mating for so long without getting results,&quot; said Martha.<br />
<br />
&quot;It hasn&#39;t been that long,&quot; said Robbie, &quot;There&#39;s still time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha sighed and said, &quot;I know, I&#39;d just be annoyed with myself for missing the opportunity.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can see a doctor if it looks like we can&#39;t get started on our own,&quot; said Robbie before yawning. &quot;But right now, I just want to sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha yawned. She was feeling tired herself. All that mating did use up a lot of energy. She moved forward enough to give Robbie room on the bed before they laid down. She didn&#39;t mind that Robbie&#39;s knot was still inside her. She just hoped that meant more success for them.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
The next morning, Martha felt different from before. Part of it was that Robbie&#39;s dick had become unknotted and was no longer in her vagina. But she also felt something else. She didn&#39;t feel the burning need to keep mating, like there was a soothing calmness within her. She wondered if it meant what she thought it meant. Getting up slowly so as to not wake her husband, she headed for the bathroom. She bought a box of pregnancy tests when she and Robbie had first started. Considering how Animalian physiology could differ a lot from human physiology, there had to be a few adjustments made for pregnancy tests. After Martha set the test, she waited anxiously to see if the color would change.<br />
<br />
Robbie felt himself being woken up by someone shaking his shoulder. &quot;Robbie, Robbie, wake up,&quot; said Martha&#39;s voice. Robbie opened his eyes to see Martha looked really excited. &quot;I just did a pregnancy test and it turned blue,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Robbie&#39;s eyes fully opened at that as his brain completely woke up. &quot;Blue?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Martha nodded and said, &quot;We&#39;re gonna have a baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Martha, that&#39;s wonderful,&quot; said Robbie, getting up, &quot;But are you really sure? I hear some pregnancy tests are unreliable. And foxes are different from humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I really feel it,&quot; said Martha, putting Robert&#39;s hand on her stomach. To Robert, it like his wife&#39;s stomach always did, muscularly firm and smooth. &quot;Ok, so maybe it&#39;s a little too early to tell, but I just have a really good feeling.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s stop by the doctor&#39;s to verify,&quot; said Robert, &quot;We wouldn&#39;t want to tell everyone it was a false alarm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, fine,&quot; said Martha, &quot;But this better not take long.&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
A trip to the doctor was able to confirm it. Martha was definitely pregnant now. Though it&#39;ll be some weeks before it&#39;ll be visibly notable. And after that confirmation, the news spread like wildfire. Naturally, the first people they told were Martha&#39;s parents. They were both delighted that they were going to have grandkids, something they thought might never have happened before Animalia. Clara and Rick were also told and Clara was excited to be a godmother, not that her own cubs didn&#39;t give her enough time.<br />
<br />
And when they went to the Animalian School of Modeling, well, the squeals made more than a few pairs of ears ring. But Martha&#39;s coworkers were ecstatic that Martha was finally starting a family of her own. They were so eager to throw her a baby shower. Maggie was willing to give Martha maternity leave, but Martha wanted to stay and keep modeling. She still had her sexy figure for now and when her baby belly became bigger, she wanted to model for the maternity clothes. It would be six months until the kit or kits are born and there was still enough for her to do before she became incapable of walking far distances. But all that really mattered to Martha was that she was going to be a mother at last.</p>
