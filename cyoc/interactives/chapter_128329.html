<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“We’re 16 Katie duh,” Lisa said sleepily throwing the pillow over her head.<br />
<br />
“Yeah you might want to double check that sis,” Katie said glibly. Lisa groaned as she lifted the pillow off her head and gazed at herself sleepily. Katie watched as Lisa’s eyes grew to the siZe off dinner plates. “Holy fuck,” she screamed before covering her mouth. She now gazed at her seven year old in astonishment. “How did this happen?”<br />
<br />
Katie now began to try and piece things together. The two girls always got a little depressed around this time as it was the anniversary of their mother’s death. Since that time they had been living with their aunt Ann. Ann, although the younger sister of their mom by four years, was more reserved. As a result she was loving but strict often times butting heads with Lisa the wild child. Katie had discovered the ring of Age accidentally and had used it a couple of times already. When Lisa found out she decided to have a bit of fun. Last night the twins had decided to have an old fashion sleepover like they used to. As a result they had ended up as seven year old kids and even four year olds. Katie remembered these things and groaned.<br />
<br />
“It’s the stupid wish you made remember,” she sighed as she looked at her sister. “You just had to insist on a sleepover.”<br />
<br />
Lisa shook her head as if clearing the cobwebs then smiled. “Oh yeah now I remember,” she smirked. “That was kind of fun. Have to try that with the girls later.”<br />
<br />
Katie sighed as she took the ring. Silently she now wished themselves back to 16. Katie watched as Lisa and herself swelled into their teens. In only a matter of moments Katie and Lisa were 16 again, Katie watched as her twin hefted up her breasts and smiled. “Welcome back girls,” she smirked cupping her breasts causing Katie to groan.<br />
<br />
“Ugh seriously Lisa,” she moaned. “We gotta be more careful what if something bad happened.”<br />
<br />
“You worry to much Kat,” she said. “You need to let loose and relax sometimes.”<br />
<br />
Katie frowned as she got out of bed and and grabbed her robe. “Would love too,” she grumbled. “But I’m the only one that can keep Aunt Ann from sending you to reform school. Seriously you two just need to bury the hatchet. Especially if you want to get your license.”<br />
<br />
Lisa frowned as she looked at Katie. “She’s not my mom,” she grumbled as she now got out of bed. “And besides me not having my license hasn’t stopped me from borrowing the car or having Jason give me driving lessons.”<br />
<br />
Katie shook her head as she thought of Jason Turner, their 16 year old neighbor. Lisa and Jason had been friends for quite sometime and only recently began dating. Jason seemed like a nice enough guy and Katie did enjoy babysitting his 10 year old sister Gloria. She now hoped that Jason could be a good influence on her sister.<br />
<br />
“So what are your plans today sis,” Lisa asked as she began to rifle through her draw. Katie shrugged she didn’t have any plans. She had considered calling up some of their friends. Hopefully Mika, Sammy, Claudia or Mary Elise was free today.  She already had a pretty good idea what Lisa was doing.<br />
<br />
“I’m probably going to call one of the girls,” she said with a shrug. “Guessing your going to call Kumiko.”<br />
<br />
Lisa smiled impishly as she looked at her sister. “Well she’s a lot of fun,” she smiled. “And besides ever since Mika and Claudia became an item she’s been stuck at her house by herself. Can you imagine not having your twin sister around. It’s gotta suck.”<br />
<br />
Katie nodded glumly. As different as Katie and Lisa were she couldn’t imagine not having her in her live. Smiling she approached her sister, giving her a tight hug. “It would definitely suck,” she whispered. “Just be careful okay? Kumi can be.....a bit wild.”<br />
<br />
Lisa smirked as she now looked at her sister. “Can’t make any promises,” she said impishly. “But I’ll try.”<br />
<br />
On the front porch neither girl noticed an elderly man looking through the window. Merlin smiled as he watched the two girls interact. “Hmmm interesting,” he muttered. “I thought Lisa would go back to being Katie’s aunt. Wild teenage Lisa and Kumiko though have DEFINITE possibilities.”<br />
<br />
Merlin rubbed his chin as he sadly looked over at the vacant lot that was once Kellies home. Turning back to Katie’s house one more time he now started walking away.<br />
<br />
“Wonder What will happen with Katie now,” he pondered. “Maybe she finds a boyfriend? Maybe a girlfriend? Maybe one of her girlfriends becomes, Well a girlfriend, that could be interesting. Wonder what wild teen Lisa and Kumiko will do. Those two were nuts as kids. I wonder if Jason can calm Lisa down, I liked him before he was such a nice guy.”<br />
<br />
Merlin continued to ponder the possibilities of things to come as he began to cross the street, slowly fading into the ether to watch yet again. “You know the whole Lisa, Aunt Ann dynamic is going to make for some interesting story telling,” he thought as he began to fade from view. “Lisa and her obviously have issues. Can’t wait to see how Katie fixes that one. I wonder if Ann learns about the ring?”<br />
<br />
Merlin smiled as he now faded from view, becoming the watcher yet again. Happy he was able to fix a mistake and intrigued by what was to come.</p>
