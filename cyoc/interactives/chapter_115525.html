<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer bit her lower lip; her monstruous penis was restless! The flared head was reacting to the surprisingly pleasant coolness of the desk&#39;s underside, making her member twitch harder and abundantly leak its sticky lubrication. She was still gripping the edges of the table in her efforts to keep calm, but in truth she was on the verge of losing all common sense from the feverish lust that had taken over her body. Was it the hormones maybe? The musky scent from between her legs was becoming insistent, heady. <br />
<br />
Jen couldn&#39;t think straight anymore at this point. She felt disconnected from the classroom. Her heart was pounding in her chest, and she felt beads of sweat pearl along her back and between her breasts, making her shirt stick to her skin. Looking down she could see her erect nipples quite visibly outlined through the white fabric, and below her bosom was the sight of her tapir member lifting her short skirt and extending under the desk, out of sight. She was quite certain she could feel heavy threads of pre dribble from her cock.<br />
<br />
Her breath was short from the sensations that had built inside her; she could barely contain herself. She just couldn&#39;t help her body anymore...  Jen&#39;s hips were subtly rocking back and forth as an answer to her primal craving. The fact barely registered in her mind as she was losing herself in the waves of pleasure that were rising within. Her obscene cock was throbbing more and more in response as the grinding intensified. She could feel its hardness, its strength. The member was swollen to its maximum. She felt powerful.<br />
<br />
Something clenched tightly in her guts and a torrent of semen rushed through her cock and erupted from the flared head. Jen let out a lewd cry, which covered the heavy thump produced by the member jerking under the desk as thick ropes of musky cum splashed underneath. She hurriedly threw her hands onto her skirt and pushed down to conceal her grotesque penis, oblivious to the pain as she was still in the throes of ecstasy. The monster cock spasmed forcefully between her thighs, oozing copious amount of seed on her knees and down her calves.<br />
<br />
Jen let out a sigh of relief and swallowed audibly as the throbbing came to rest. Everything was silent around her, and finally she looked up. The whole classroom was staring. Mr. Simms had interrupted his course and was glaring at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Care to explain what this is all about, miss Smith?&quot; he asked severely. &quot;I hope this... hullabaloo is nothing more than a tasteless joke. Please enlighten us!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer&#39;s face went from red to white as a sheet. Every student&#39;s eyes were set upon her, goggling or mocking. The people closest to her table were looking down on her knees, searching for evidence of anything obscene. Some had frowny faces, others expressions of disgust. A girl closest to her seemed bewildered and almost as pale as Jen herself. &quot;They know&quot;, she immediately thought to herself. At least some of them must have seen something, even if they couldn&#39;t believe it.<br />
<br />
She felt a knot in her stomach as a sense of shame and disgust replaced her afterglow. Her freakish member had softened under her skirt and was nonchalantly retreating in its sheath, leaving in its wake a trail of cold cum against her inner thighs. She clenched her legs tighter together in embarassment, and they met with a slight sticky wet noise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, miss Smith? Do I need to come over here to get an answer?&quot; Mr. Simms insisted, visibly angered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I..&quot; Jen started, but what could she say? Any moment from now, someone around her will comment on the gross thing they saw creeping under her skirt. Or the stains. Not to mention the puddle of goo at her feet. And she couldn&#39;t make up an lie about any of this, as the curse would only make it worse!<br />
<br />
That damn curse. Jen took a deep breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or dare?&quot; she blurted out to the whole class, improvising.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? What is the meaning of this?&quot; Mr. Simms vociferated. &quot;Explain yourself or you will have to suffer the consequences!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer didn&#39;t budge. A rumour ran through the classroom, students murmuring between themselves. Everybody was taken aback, which was exactly was Jen had hoped for. This was her only way out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, but you&#39;re all too late&quot; she finally said. Mr. Simms raised a stern eyebrow and opened his mouth, but she did not let him speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the curse, there is no way around it; some of you have probably heard about it. It&#39;s real, and now it&#39;s your turn...&quot; There were a few gasps in the room as she went on.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re getting both. For your dare, you will all convince yourselves that nothing out of the ordinary happened today in class. In fact, in the following minutes you will make yourself forget you ever saw anything weird relating to me here, including the fact I&#39;m responsible for what&#39;s about to happen. For your transform...&quot; She took a brief pause. She had planned none of this and was struggling to find any inspiration. Quick, damnit!<br />
<br />
&quot;For your transform, uh... For your transform, over the next hours you will gain sexual characteristics from a random animal.&quot; Damnit, why couldn&#39;t she come up with anything clever? But there was no time. Whatever, it didn&#39;t matter anymore at this point. &quot;Your sex organs may be unrelated to your gender, and you will get aroused extremely easily.&quot; That&#39;s it Jen, just make things up on the  go and get out of here! &quot;Your brain will alter your memory, giving you the illusion that you started  changing during puberty, making yourself extremely self-conscious so you can keep your dirty little secret safe. Good luck with that!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer adjusted her wet skirt and panties to conceal her tightly packed shaft, grabbed her bag, and walked out of the classroom while everybody - teacher included - was staring blankly at the walls and each others, looking increasingly confused. Nobody seemed to pay attention to her as she passed the door; the curse was working, and she walked away quite safely.</p>
