<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Whether Alex consciously recognized it or not, his toon transformation has brought on a whole new attitude and way of thinking. In addition to feeling stronger, faster, hotter, and hornier, Alex felt like he could overcome anything, do anything. All the inhibitions that the old Alex had were gone, all the nagging voices in his head that told him what he could or could not do have been pushed down inside of him out of reach. Much like his new 2-D appearance, in a way his personality has become flatter, defined by one word: confidence. Alex can remember when he was a weak human, bound by social expectations and responsibilities, but that time in his life feels distant and laughable now. No, that time is over. Now Alex can do what ever he wants, and he wants to be bad.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Rachel and Tiffany were lounging at Rachel&#39;s place. It was a holiday weekend so they didn&#39;t have cheer practice. It wasn&#39;t easy being popular, privileged, and spoiled. Everyone thinks that cheer captain Rachel and her BFF must have it so easy, but having the expectations put on them that they do is exhausting, and those people are just jealous bitches anyways. <br />
<br />
&quot;...and then I said to her, that she can go... wait, do you feel that?&quot; Tiffany and Rachel exchange nervous glances as the ground rumbles. <br />
&quot;It&#39;s and earthquake!&quot;<br />
&quot;No, it sounds more like a stampede!&quot;<br />
Suddenly there is a blast as a massive, 9 foot tall and about half as wide figure bursts through the living room wall. &quot;Oh Yeah!&quot; it shouts. The two girls cough as the drywall dust settles, but soon see the cause of the destruction, a cartoon wolf who&#39;s mostly muscle and the rest is teeth in the shape of a grin, his muzzle alone the size of either of their torsos. They wouldn&#39;t believe it if they weren&#39;t looking right at it, though it does take a few moments even with the spectacle right in front of them. <br />
<br />
Then they both screamed.<br />
&quot;Ladies, ladies! I know you must be excited to see me, but contain yourselves!&quot; <br />
Rachel silences herself, more out of fear than anything else, but Tiffany stands up. &quot;Who are you and what do you think you&#39;re doing?! You can&#39;t barge into people&#39;s homes like that!&quot;<br />
&quot;Behave yourself lady, I&#39;m not even here for you,&quot; Alex Growls.<br />
&quot;Behave?!&quot; Tiffany walks right up to the wolf and pokes him in the chest while she rants. &quot;I don&#39;t know who you think you are, mister, but you&#39;re the one trespassing and destroying property! If you have half a mind you&#39;d start running now before the police show up! oh, when my father hears about this, you are going to be put away for so long that you&#39;ll be sorry that you ever crossed--&quot;<br />
<br />
In a flash Alex bends down and engulfs half of Tiffany&#39;s body within his mouth. There&#39;s a muffled shout, &quot;WHAT THE FUCK!&quot; Alex straitens back up, Tiffany&#39;s limbs flailing about trying to grab on to something to pull her out, including Alex&#39;s cheek fur and thick lips. He uses a huge gloved finger to one-by-one shove her limbs into his maw. As soon as the last of Tiffany&#39;s legs clears his lips, Alex clamps down like a bear trap and then grins proudly, showing Tiffany trapped behind the row of pearly white bars in place of teeth. <br />
<br />
Still grinning, Alex rolling his tongue around like waves pulling Tiffany out to sea. &quot;HELP! I can&#39;t hold on!&quot; she shouts as she slips backwards towards his throat, trying to grip anything, but everything is covered in drool and slippery. Rachel looks on in terror at the last glimpse of her friend&#39;s arms holding onto the wolf&#39;s uvula in the back of his mouth before that too slips out of her hands and she disappears down an abyss, lost forever as food to this monster.<br />
<br />
Alex seals his lips, dabs a napkin to his mouth, and then gives a belch (teeth returned to normal). &quot;Sorry, that was very rude of me to eat before everyone is served.&quot; He says to Rachel, who has scooched herself to the far corner of the room. &quot;Let&#39;s start over. I&#39;m Alex. we&#39;ve met before but you probably don&#39;t recognize me. I asked you to senior prom but you and your friends laughed at me. Said something about &#39;not being man enough for you.&#39; Now I&#39;m here to make up for lost time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel vaguely remembers an Alex from school, and she may have turned him down for a date. But this... this is not that Alex. &quot;Wha- what are you?&quot; She managed to squeak out, barley able to muster a sound. <br />
<br />
&quot;What am I?&quot; Flash! Alex moved to the middle of the room, closing the distance and making a Captain Morgan pose, &quot;why, I&#39;m the Big Bad Wolf, the manliest of men around!&quot; And as though on queue, Rachel finally notices the huge bulge between Alex&#39;s legs. That sack probably handles like a bag of potatoes, not to mention the log of meat. &quot;And I am here to cash in on that date you own me!&quot;<br />
<br />
This is insane, ridiculous, complete lunacy. It must have been a flight or fight reaction, because the next thing Rachel knows is that she&#39;s in an all out sprint down the hallway and towards the back door. She flings the door open only to find Alex there waiting for her. &quot;Where do you think you&#39;re going, beautiful?&quot; She slams the door and runs the other way down the hall towards the front door. She opens it and again he had gotten there first. &quot;Come here often?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel slams the door again and goes to run in another direction, but she stays running in place instead. Looking around confused, she sees that she somehow has been surrounded by a human sized mouse wheel. Stunned, the door behind her creaks open and Alex saunters inside. &quot;Are we having fun yet? That was a nice game of Wolf and mouse, but now it&#39;s my turn to pick the game.&quot; Alex puts a hand on the wheel and gives it a twirl. Rachel stumbles but catches herself, and is back to running in the exercise contraption. Strangely, the details in the wheel looked to be losing complexity, and the lighting is hitting it differently than it was a moment ago. Alex gives another whirl and Rachel is back to an all out sprint. The wheel was merely a blur now and Rachel struggled to keep up. With one last push, the wheel sped up one last time causing Rachel to lose her footing and tumble. She is instantly picked up and carried along with the blur of motion the contraption has become, losing all track of position as she merges with and is lost inside the twister.<br />
<br />
As the wheel and Rachel spin, the cartoonish blur begins to shrink. Down and down it goes until it&#39;s a size fit for, as you may have guessed, a mouse. Alex lifts his soft foot paw up and halts the wheel with his toe pads, and instantly a small brown blur is ejected out, tumbling across the floor. It crashes into a set of bowling pins that were inexplicably set up at the end of the hall. Sitting on the floor in a daze, eyes still spinning, is a tiny toon mouse girl. Big plate like ears, brown coat with white underbelly, spherical nose at the end of a thin snout, pink hands and feet at the ends of stubby limbs, and a long naked tail. In fact, she&#39;s entirely naked, but there does not appear to be any private parts to hide, only the outline of childbearing hips, a modest bust, and long eye lashes to suggest her female sex.<br />
<br />
Rachel holds her head with her small hands and blinks a few times to get the stars out of her eyes. The world coming back into focus, she sees things from a whole new perspective. Have you every visited a place when you were a child only to return again later as a grown up and remember the place being a lot bigger before? Well, Rachel is getting the opposite feeling; the doorknob  is a mile high, the stair case may as well be Mount Everest, and the ceiling is just as in reach as the moon or stars.<br />
<br />
Busy marveling at her surrounding, she only just notices her pink hands, brown coloring and black inky outline separating herself from the 3-D world when she&#39;s suddenly lifted into the air, her tail pinched between two claws. She&#39;s brought to eye level with the big bad wolf, dangling just above his black nose. &quot;Oh please Mr Big Bad! Don&#39;t eat me! I&#39;ll do anything you want, just let me go!&quot; she pleads with her hands together. Her voice is much higher pitch and squeaky than before.<br />
<br />
The Wolf ponders for a moment. &quot;Eat you? the thought hadn&#39;t crossed my mind. But now that you mention it, I could go for a second course. I&#39;ll have to think on it...&quot; What happens next?</p>
