<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Ben and Alex exited their car, the former clearing his throat as they drew closer to the couple kissed. <br />
<br />
“Care to take the party inside?” Ben asked as the younger Anderson and the were in front of him blushed. <br />
<br />
“Uh ya.” Eric mumbled. Ben and Alex silently laughed as the couple hastily went inside. Spencer took a moment to look over her shoulder and stick her tongue out at them. <br />
<br />
“Buzzkills.” she said. This time Ben and Alex weren’t shy about expressing their amusement at the other couple’s embarrassment. <br />
<br />
Inside, the rest of the group had started talking about their respective days. Eric sat on the couch beside his father, while Spencer sat on the floor. It was more comfortable than trying to fit herself on the couch. <br />
<br />
“Hope we haven’t kept you all waiting. Something, uh, unexpected came up.” Maggie said. <br />
<br />
“Nothing bad I hope.” William said, knowing the Lawsons had had enough trouble for the rest of the year, maybe the rest of their lives. <br />
<br />
“No.” “Yes.” Evan and Maggie answered together. <br />
<br />
“I don’t think Grandpa moving in is bad.” Spencer added. The adults all raised a brow at her parents for an explanation.<br />
<br />
“He is NOT moving in.” Evan said flatly. Spencer shrugged and said her father was splitting hairs. <br />
<br />
“Can I assume we’re talking about Evan’s father?” Samantha asked, knowing that Maggie’s parents were quite happy down in California. <br />
<br />
“Unfortunately,” Evan grumbled. Maggie gave him a disapproving look before explaining Mike was planning on moving to town to be closer to the family. No one really knew what to say, since Evan looks very put out, and not wanting to discuss this at the moment. <br />
<br />
Once Maggie was finished, Martha took the chance to ask what everyone wanted to dessert. Francis, Samantha and Maggie went into the kitchen to help her. <br />
<br />
“So, Evan and his father don’t get along?” Francis asked. <br />
<br />
“Usually they’re okay. But Mike kinda crossed a line.” Maggie said, before telling them how Evan “forgot” to tell his father about Jeremy Bower, and his father storming into town, and how Mike had driven down from Seattle, and then broke into their house. <br />
<br />
“Geez, and I thought my in-laws were nuts, uh no offense honey.” Samantha added the apology when she remembers her wife is standing right next to her. <br />
<br />
“They’re both head strong, and on top of that have Alpha-male complexes.” Maggie said. <br />
<br />
“But at least Spencer gets to see her grandfather. And I guess this means that Evan really needs to have a good time tonight.” Martha said, a very foxy smile on her face. Maggie nodded in agreement, before asking if they should include Kenya in their plans. She was more than open to adding another panther and werewolf to their party if the two wanted to join them. <br />
<br />
“I highly doubt Nate will feel comfortable joining us. Still, he might be alright with Kenya joining us if she wants.” Martha shrugged. <br />
<br />
They went back into the living room to get their answer, and also bring the actual dessert with them. <br />
<br />
“Thanks,” William thanked his wife as she handed him a plate and fork. William watched as Martha moved onto Eric and Spencer, who were so busy looking at each other they didn’t notice Martha at first. <br />
<br />
“If I didn’t know how crazy about Spencer Eric already was…” William watched as his younger son talked with Spencer, this dreamy look on his eyes. <br />
<br />
Kenya found herself staring at Spencer too. Even though she was wearing oversized clothing, and had her right arm in a sling, Kenya could tell Spencer was just like any other panther in terms of build. Long, built for running and pouncing, with deep black fur. But then there were the more canine aspects of her form. The bushy tail, the longer muzzle, triangular ears, the silver points on her fur, and in her undercoat. All in all, a truly unique were. <br />
<br />
The atmosphere in the living room was getting steamier and steamier with every passing minute. It was obvious the adults were ready for the more intimate portion of their holiday to begin. William and Martha kept licking the whipped cream off their cutlery in an especially provocative way. It drove the Twists and Lawsons nuts. Ironic since Francis was working on a piece of pecan pie. <br />
<br />
Kenya and Nate were eager to get some privacy too. They had a lot to talk about, as it appeared his family wasn’t opposed in the least to their relationship, so long as they took it slow. Which was fine for both. Nate was still getting used to the idea of being hitched to someone (for he’d never been in a real relationship before), and Kenya didn’t want to make him feel pressured. <br />
<br />
But Nate wasn’t sure what to do or say if Kenya wanted to join his parents, and neighbors downstairs. Something about the scenario seemed wrong. And he hoped she wouldn’t be too offended if he bowed out. It wasn’t too much to guess Ben and Alex, and Eric and Spencer would be breaking off for their own fun. <br />
<br />
“You’re quite the cook Mrs. Anderson.” Kenya remarked. <br />
<br />
“Thank you dear. But I can’t take all the credit. Much of the dessert portion was done by Eric.” Martha smiled at Eric, who was about as red as the plate he was eating off. <br />
<br />
“It was nothing.” he muttered. <br />
<br />
“I’d hardly say that. You have a gift Eric.” said a very satisfied Kenya. <br />
<br />
“Thanks.” Eric blushed harder. <br />
<br />
“I wonder if he plans on making the change? He’s dating a hybrid were, so he must be. But what kind? A feline, or canine?” Kenya wondered as she finished her slice. She’d be sure to ask Nate later. He’d know, he was Eric’s brother after all.</p>
