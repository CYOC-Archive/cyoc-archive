<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Kellie and Merlin now walked around the neighborhood she paused. “Wait,” she said. “This....this is my old neighborhood.” Merlin nodded contentedly as he looked over the rows of houses. “Yes I believe it is minus your old house that is.”<br />
<br />
Kellie frowned as she saw the open lot next to Katie and Lisa’s house. She thought it odd that the lot remained empty yet realized that when reality was altered everything that was connected to her had been erased. “So much for crashing there,” she mumbled. Looking around Kellie now tried to formulate a plan. <br />
<br />
If she was going to be a new student and she was going to reconnect with Katie and Lisa she figured it would be best to move into the neighborhood. If her old home no longer existed then she and Merlin would have to find a new one. As she looked across from Katie’s an idea began to form. “Follow me,” she motioned. Merlin grinned as he trailed behind Kellie. Brimming with pride he watched as Kellie made her way towards an elderly woman’s home, he had a feeling what she was going to do. “Just love how she’s always thinking on her feet,” he said.<br />
<br />
Kellie now stood on the doorstep of Katie’s elderly neighbor Janet. Kellie remembered that in the previous reality the woman was 85 and lived alone, her husband having passed away several years earlier. She remembered that on occasion she had asked the woman to watch Katie, which she happily did out of loneliness. Kellie now hoped that Janet hadn’t been altered too much.<br />
<br />
After ringing the doorbell Kellie felt like she waited an eternity for the door to be answered. As it opened she breathed a sigh of relief, Janet was unaltered. “Can I help you young lady?” She asked. Kellie smiled now putting on her best innocent smile. “Hi Miss,” she said. “Our car broke down and well mine and my grandpas cellphones died. Can we use your phone.”<br />
<br />
Janet now looked out at Katie and Merlin. “I suppose let me just grab it Wait right here.” Merlin had been listening intently, he knew that he was merely a side kick in Kellies adventures yet sometimes he needed to assist her...this was one of those times. “Kellie sweetly,” he called. “I hate to be a bother but it’s about time for my meds can you see if that nice young lady could let us in so I can take them.”<br />
<br />
Janet gazed out at the old man before looking at the young teen in front of her. “I suppose that would be okay,” she said as she stepped aside letting Kellie and Merlin inside. Kellie now looked over the small home smiling. “This place is perfect,” she thought. “Now we just have to get rid of Janet.”<br />
<br />
Janet now returned with a cellphone and glass of water for Merlin to take his medication. “Thank you so much Miss,” Kellie said warmly. “I appreciate it so much, you wouldn’t believe the trouble we had trying to find help.”<br />
<br />
“It’s nothing,” Janet said as she looked the two of them over. “Once your finished though if you could please leave I would appreciate it.”<br />
<br />
“Oh of course ma’me,” Kellie said kindly. “I would hate to inconvenience yu and your husband.”<br />
<br />
Kellie now watched as a sad look came across Janet’s face. Kellie had been waiting for this, previous experience told her that just finding an in made things easier to give people what they wanted...and get what she needed. “Oh,” Kellie said trying to sound embarrassed. “I....I am so sorry miss....I...I..didn’t mean to upset you.”<br />
<br />
Janet wiped her eyes as she smiled weakly. “No it’s okay,” she said. “It’s been years now it’s just...well, I miss him so so much.”<br />
<br />
“Well you could always try dating again,” Kellie said trying to sound hopeful.<br />
<br />
Janet laughed as she blushed slightly. “Oh dear I’m much to old for that.”<br />
<br />
Kellie smirked as she now made her way towards Janet. “What if I told you I could change that.”<br />
<br />
Janet shook her head looking at the girl. “I would say that would be a neat trick sadly though it’s impossible.”<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled as she now concentrated on Janet becoming younger. She watched now as an odd look came across Janet’s face as she rapidly retreated through her 80s and 70s. “Take a look in the mirror.”<br />
<br />
Confused Janet made her way to the bathroom where Kellie heard the woman gasp. Quickly the now 60 year old woman reentered the hall. The lines in her face had smoothed while her grey hair was now filling with it’s original black. “I...I look 20 years younger,” She’s gasped. Kellie nodded as she looked the woman over. “Yes you do and your still growing younger.”<br />
<br />
Janet gasped in surprise as she now examined her body. She could see her body beginning her firm up as her breasts rose losing their droppiness. As she became 50 she gaped at Kellie. “This...this is incredible,” she whispered. “Thank you.”<br />
<br />
“Well your quite welcome but theirs something I want from you,” Kellie said. “You see I can keep you young and give you a second chance. My friend over there can give you even more. If you agree we can give you your youth and fulfill your dreams.”<br />
<br />
Janet nodded as she became 45. “What would you like,” she asked.<br />
<br />
Kellie smirked as she looked at the regressing woman. “Well we’re new in town and we kind of need a place to live. Give us your home and we will fulfill your dreams. You would be young, have the job of your dreams and more money than you couldn’t possibly hope for. Do we have a deal?”<br />
<br />
Janet pondered the proposal for a moment before nodding. “Awesome,” Kellie exclaimed. “In that case what I saw your wish?”<br />
<br />
“I...I wish that I was a powerful business woman with a prosperous career,” she whispered. Kellie now looked back at Merlin who nodded. “Okay granted.”<br />
<br />
Janet shivered slightly as she completed her regression becoming 32 years old. Looking herself over she could see her hair had returned to its natural black, cascading down just past her shoulders. As she felt her body when found that her c cup breasts were full and perky once more with a trim waist. “This is amazing thank you,” She’s said.<br />
<br />
“Now for the second part,” Kellie said looking at Merlin. “Check your purse.”<br />
<br />
Janet now slowly made her way to the purse on the couch. Opening it she noticed  small stack of business cards and a bank statement. Briefly looking over the cards she saw she was a managing partner at one of the biggest companies in New York. Happy she now looked at the bank statement letting out a gasp of shock. “This says I have $500,000 in the bank,” she exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“That’s right and you even have a beautiful apartment in Manhattan,” Kellie said. “We’ll send you their in a moment all you need to do is give us the house.” Janet nodded solemnly as she looked at Kellie and Merlin. “The house isn’t yours,” She’s said happily.<br />
<br />
“Thank you so much Janet,” Kellie said happily. “I hope you enjoy your new life.” Kellie now watched as Merlin waved his hand, instantly causing Janet to vanish. “She seemed nice,” Merlin said happily. Kellie nodded. “She was very nice when I knew her,” when said. “Thankfully She won’t remeber any of this so we’re in the clear. No what if you could just conjure a moving van so that it looks like we just got here.” Merlin smile do as the two looked towards the door. In an instant movers began bringing in furniture. “Nice no way it looks like we just started moving in,” She’s said. Kellie now looked across the street at Katie’s house. She hoped now that the girls would notice and come by.</p>
