<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;A farm...&quot; the female Bavarian Warmblood Animalian said slowly as she looked over the orchards that had been put up around the Brown Farm and finding Martin and Josephine Brown waiting for her as she was lead up the Brown family home, &quot;that&#39;s where you&#39;re putting me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; said one of the escorting Animalia PD officers answered a careful glance to the taller Horse Animalian, &quot;you and your friends&#39; little party did QUITE a lot of damage to the hotel room you were in. Thankfully Animalia and Las Vegas have gotten along well enough that they were able to work out a deal with the hotel owner. You pull your weight and work here and a portion of what you earn will go back to pay for the damages.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sylvia gave a saddened snort at that, as she really didn&#39;t see manual labor as the sort of thing she was into. And while apples weren&#39;t bad, and in fact she&#39;d rather liked them, that didn&#39;t mean she wanted to spend her days as a farm hand, likely earning minimum wage picking apples off trees and then carrying bushels to where they&#39;d either be preserved for future freshness and sale or transport for processing into something else. Even now with her taller, more muscular and athletic, and more voluptuous body she wasn&#39;t that keen on doing farm work.<br />
<br />
&quot;The other option would be that you spend a few days in jail in Las Vegas before having a court hearing and let you go from there,&quot; the Animalia PD officer spoke, &quot;and they may well put some of that on your record.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was enough to get Sylvia accept the position. She didn&#39;t necessarily like it, but that didn&#39;t mean she wanted to go to jail and end up with something that would be put on her record. It was by that point that they were close enough to speak with the Browns.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the Horse Animalian from Las Vegas?&quot; Josephine asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... you can call me Sylvia,&quot; Sylvia spoke slowly, and while she saw a very strong stallion in Martin Brown, she could also see that Josephine stood close to him, and had enough sense not to decide to try any sort of flirtation at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Martin Brown, and this is my wife, Josephine,&quot; Martin spoke as he calmly shook Sylvia&#39;s hand, privately wondering on what this Sylvia&#39;s family name was as she didn&#39;t give one, &quot;Now you will understand that much of the schedule will be pretty busy through the day... particularly now with school soon to start and orchards ready for picking?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Sylvia slowly sighed, &quot;though... I&#39;ve never worked on a farm before...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, we won&#39;t start you without some form of supervision,&quot; Josephine commented, &quot;as through the year... our farm will have its fair share of help, particularly in the spring and fall when much of the work to have the trees ready and the apples harvested will be the most labor intensive. Though there may be some times where you will be assigned to some other tasks as needed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sylvia slowly nodded, though one of her eyes caught some movement in the background. She spotted two Animalian stallions carrying some large metal jars into the barn that was near the house. She couldn&#39;t focus her eyes on them, as that would give Martin and Josephine the obvious sign that she wasn&#39;t paying attention, but from what she could see, she could easily notice that one male was very muscular and had a lot of ease with what he was carrying and the other, while he wasn&#39;t as macular as the first, he wasn&#39;t that far behind. It was enough to raise her interest and she thought to herself, &quot;if I get a chance to ride them... I could get used to farm work.&quot; Of course, she didn&#39;t know that both stallions were already spoken for.<br />
<br />

<br />
The apartment complex that Kelly found herself in was packed with squeals and cries of excitement that had to be the sound of children running around in place. She was eventually lead into a larger room on the ground floor that sort of confirmed that. There were plenty of windows that let plenty of light in and made things easier for things to be seen, as several toddler aged Rat Animalian children ran about the room hopping up and down on a large blue mat that covered the floor, playing with a slide, and a sort of jungle gym that was like what some fast food restaurants had had for children to climb on. The youngsters seemed to be having a good time, though it was also pretty clear that the three adult Rat Animalians also looked a bit tired.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... excuse me... I&#39;m here to see a Mary... Piper, I think it was...&quot; Kelly said slowly and semi-nervously as she made her way into the room.<br />
<br />
The tallest one in the room turned and looked to Kelly with a small nod. Kelly approached in rather casual attire with a pair black shorts and a pale blue polo shirt. It all contrasted with her white fur, which probably meant that while Kelly&#39;s species was probably a Norway Rat, it had probably come from specific animals that had been in human care or in laboratory science for a long time. It was rather rare that lab rats actually had the traditional brown coloration that the Norway Rat had gotten its other name from, the Brown Rat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I&#39;m Mary Piper,&quot; Mary commented, &quot;You&#39;re here for the nanny position... from Las Vegas.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nanny... the officers said I was to help with organizing and billing,&quot; Kelly said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Half right... just organizing,&quot; Mary answered, &quot;Cheaper by the Dozens has done well enough that you&#39;ll make decent enough money... particularly with the massive cast of characters that you&#39;ll be looking over... but the real thing will be organizing.  Some of my older children are happy to help, and will be there to help with regard to things that the younger ones prefer... but you&#39;ll need to keep them occupied and organized. That will include getting them to lunches, making sure each does not waste time in the bathroom, and so on. It&#39;ll be pretty much like running a full time daycare, except with one family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One family,&quot; Kelly said slowly and looked at the host of little ones running around and cheering as they went. She knew that Animalians were hornier than Humans, which had made the &quot;wild night&quot; fun, but she didn&#39;t think even Animalians with their libidos could reproduce so prolifically.<br />
<br />
Mary nodded, &quot;the initial strain of the Animalia Virus that I was exposed to was imperfect... something that they&#39;d been tinkering with beforehand and intended to discard. And while its results weren&#39;t quite as good as what they came up with later... the strain that I was exposed to did provide a great many changes...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary chose not to get into too much detail, largely as it was likely that Kelly would be put off by the fact that the origins of the Piper Clan were a bit different and that Mary&#39;s only relations with them was still on &quot;edge.&quot; She got along much better with Jack now, and he had grown from the very animalistic creature that had raped her before the initial Animalia Outbreak occurred, but there was still a fair amount of distance that Mary kept between them at times. She played the role of a &quot;loving mom&quot; and &quot;dutiful wife&quot; for Cheaper by the Dozens, but that was still a TV series and her own private focus was still on her own healing and so on. The children that had been born to her or one of the daughters that she&#39;d had, though, were another matter. The children didn&#39;t ask to be born and her unease at the memories of her fist interactions with Jack wasn&#39;t their fault. But with so many of them, she had to admit that she needed some help.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jack and I... and our clan had to be exposed to the newer form of the Animalia Virus in order to be physically healed from the imperfections in the initial strain that we were exposed to,&quot; Mary explained, &quot;and... it had its other consequences, which will need your help to work with...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kelly only gulped as she felt a tug on her tail and then looked back seeing a little one, who looked like he or she was three or four holding up a toy boat to her.<br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;This is a rather small area,&quot; Lisa commented slowly as the Meat Market&#39;s manager gave her a small tour of the building and pointed out the stage area in the back were Ella and Simone would play some of their music for patrons, though with their dance club now running, some of their appearances were fewer and farther between. &quot;Don&#39;t ya think this could be problematic if there&#39;s a packed house?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... our main business is with those who come in to see Animalians strip,&quot; the manager answered, &quot;we will have some background music from time to time and so on... but that&#39;s still not the main reason people come here.&quot;<br />
<br />
The manager paused to scratch his nose for a moment before he continued, &quot;and given what the police have informed me on with regard to your &quot;case,&quot; putting you on that stage to strip might be in violation... given what you did before. Once you pay off your debt to that hotel in Las Vegas, we can talk...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But until then you&#39;ll have Lisa the Laughing Hyena...&quot; Lisa waved one hand about in a dramatic wave, &quot;comedy gold!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; the manager managed a chuckle. The stage name might work for a comedian, but for the moment there was going to be some questions as to how well things worked out. Lisa hadn&#39;t been to over the top or reliant on weak puns, but then the manager also had to admit that he wasn&#39;t an expert on comedy. Thus he&#39;d have to see how things played out as they moved forward.<br />
<br />

<br />
Betti, meanwhile was nervously escorted up to one of the houses in Animalia. She was a bit nervous and skittish, and she couldn&#39;t quite understand why. She understood the consequences of the fun that she and the others had had with the &quot;seven on four&quot; night as people were calling it, and understood that the damages would have to be repaid, but that didn&#39;t make her feel any easier. A part of her wondered if this was merely the results of her conversion. She&#39;d jumped at the idea of being young and healthy again with some private thanks, given that Animalians always seemed healthy. And given the reports on their libidos, Betti also figured that Animalians might not be too upset over that night. After all, everything was done in private and everyone had remembered to be on their birth control pill BEFORE the night happened, so it wasn&#39;t as though there was any rapes or violations of Animalia&#39;s edicts. However, Betti was still rather nervous. She guessed it was the escorting officer.<br />
<br />
The officer knocked on the door as they reached it and Betti was left waiting a few moments until the door opened to reveal a buck and doe Animalian, with the buck&#39;s antlers presently free of velvet and looking very healthy. Betti looked a bit eagerly at him, but also caught his scent on the doe Animalian and thus didn&#39;t say anything for a moment. That only made her nervousness as she looked down again.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Betty?&quot; the doe asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Betti, with an i,&quot; Betti corrected, still looking down.<br />
<br />
&quot;And yes... the one from Las Vegas,&quot; the officer spoke to the two that had answered the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;You poor dear... abused by people like that,&quot; the doe came forward, placing one hand on Betti&#39;s shoulder, &quot;My name is Laura and this is my bond-mate Walter. You don&#39;t need to be afraid. We won&#39;t hurt you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Scala never hurt me,&quot; Betti answered nervously referring to the woman that became a Gila Monster Animalian, &quot;couldn&#39;t stay in school... and they at least took me in...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn&#39;t make prostitution right or safe,&quot; Walter said firmly, &quot;You will be safe with Laura and I.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There will be the matter of her debts...&quot; the officer commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Walter and I can handle that,&quot; Laura spoke to him, &quot;in the meantime... we&#39;ll get Betti into WSA, she can complete her schooling and get a new start. One that she can choose and openly be proud of. And maybe she&#39;ll meet someone who will love her for who she is on the inside, not for her looks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Betti managed and actually turned to hug Laura.<br />
<br />

Dao was surprised to be informed that her &quot;guide&quot; in Animalia actually lived in Lyre with her former owner and that they were to meet at the Claw Coliseum to use the jogging track that was part of the layout and away from the IAC&#39;s activities, even if they were now winding down. She&#39;d managed to sign in fairly well before a soft but upbeat voice spoke to her from behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello... are you Dao?&quot; the voice asked.<br />
<br />
Dao turned to see a female Pig Animalian standing there in a tracksuit. Her black color, counting both skin and the modest hairs that covered it and lacking Human hair gave Dao the conclusion that this pig Animalian was likely an uplifted domestic pig, though she wasn&#39;t particularly sure on what breed. There were a fair number of domestic pig breeds, some were for meat and some were bread to be kept as pets. Dao had chosen the Vietnamese Pot-Bellied Pig as it was a way to honor her own ancestry, and that had resulting in her sharing the same coloration as this newly arrived Pig Animalian, but that didn&#39;t mean Dao could exactly tell this Pig Animalian&#39;s precise breed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... I&#39;m Dao,&quot; Dao said slowly to then be greeted by a peppy handshake.<br />
<br />
&quot;A pleasure to meet you, my name is Olive,&quot; the other Pig Animalian spoke, &quot;I&#39;ve been asked to help serve as your sponsor for a time... Help you get used to things in Animalia, find work that won&#39;t be embarrassing, and help you be ready and pay off your debts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In a track suit?&quot; Dao wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... no,&quot; Olive answered, &quot;I figured it best we have some time to work out and you can tell me more about you and what you really want to do. I can then help from there. Thus we could get some jogging in while we talk and no one will bother us. Thus the track suit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see...&quot; Dao said slowly, &quot;well I suppose that couldn&#39;t hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Scala, meanwhile, scowled in modest sized room in the back of Animalia&#39;s Grand Hall. Lexi was with her, and was equally disappointed, but remained quiet for the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;A janitor?!&quot; Scala scowled at the placed shelves with garbage bags, sweeping brooms and a push broom leaning against a far wall and sets of dust mops hanging from hooks on the wall. She then turned to Robbie who was there with the Grand Hall&#39;s main custodian and maintenance officer. &quot;I am better than this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In terms of education... I&#39;m sure you are,&quot; Robbie answered, &quot;but given that for your conversion party you trashed a hotel room in Las Vegas... and keep in mind that the hotels in Lyre and Animalia would not be any more tolerant of what your party did than what those in Las Vegas would tolerate... it would be pretty clear that you had little interest in cleanliness or responsibility. But then... the room didn&#39;t belong to you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn&#39;t the one that brought the alcohol,&quot; Scala answered, &quot;if the alcohol wasn&#39;t involved there wouldn&#39;t have been a problem...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Robbie answered, &quot;but that doesn&#39;t change that the hotel wants repayment for the damage done. This will teach you some measure of responsibility.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we don&#39;t know the first thing about this,&quot; Lexi spoke up, finally finding her voice for the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Think of it as on the job training,&quot; Robbie answered, &quot;or we can send you back to Las Vegas and let their police deal with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lexi nodded and Scala, who&#39;d been the more vocal of the two finally admitted defeat. With that, Robbie left the room and the Animalian in charge of the Grand Hall&#39;s maintenance and cleaning get started the basics of what would be required from the two while they were there and what they would be doing until they&#39;d paid off their debts. He had little expectation as to their staying once the hotel in Las Vegas had Scala and Lexi&#39;s part of the damages paid. But by then, it&#39;d at least be expected that the two would have some understanding on what Animalia expected and that the two from the &quot;seven on four&quot; night would find honest work and would be responsible outside their own homes, apartment, or place of business...</p>
