<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jace forced his legs into motion, each step a jarring reminder of just how much mass he was carrying now. His thighs rubbed together in a way they never had before, thick and powerful, forcing him into a rolling gait better suited for a football player than a studious academic. It was absurd—he had no right to be this size, this strong. His hands clenched into fists as he charged forward, pushing through the swarm of students clogging the campus quad. Simon had a head start, and Jace had no idea where Simon&#39;s next class was. He needed to catch up and finish getting tutored in order to fix his situation.<br />
Jace was a dumb jock now, all muscle and no brains, and he needed tutoring bad. He&#39;d totally misunderstood the task when he accepted it, but even through the fog in his head, one thing was clear: Simon was the key to finishing the task, and finishing the task meant undoing all of this.<br />
<br />
His oversized sneakers thudded against the pavement as he picked up speed, his chest rising and falling in deep, steady breaths. If nothing else, this body was built for movement. A few heads turned as he bulldozed his way past groups of students.<br />
“Yo, slow down, big guy!” someone called out as he accidentally shoulder-checked a skinny underclassman, sending the guy stumbling.<br />
Jace muttered a quick apology but didn’t stop. His thick arms pumped at his sides, muscles working in tandem, driving him forward. He felt powerful. Not just in the sense of physical dominance, but in the way the world reacted to him. People stepped aside instinctively, clearing a path. It was like he belonged here. Like they expected him to be in a rush, because someone like him always had somewhere to be—whether it was the gym, practice, or some frat event. The realization sent a chill down his spine.<br />
He spotted Simon up ahead, his mop of brown hair bobbing as he ascended the steps of a lecture hall. Jace poured everything he had into a final burst of speed. His new body responded instantly, a well-oiled machine built for peak performance. His calves burned, his lungs expanded, and within seconds, he was nearly on top of his target.<br />
<br />
Then, disaster.<br />
His foot caught the edge of the bottom step. Normally, he would have corrected his balance mid-stride, but this body—this heavier, more muscle-dense body—didn’t move the way he expected. His ankle twisted, momentum betrayed him, and he went sprawling forward like a felled tree.<br />
<br />
“Shit—!”<br />
<br />
Jace slammed into the steps, his forearm taking the brunt of the impact, followed by his shoulder. A dull pain shot through him, but it was drowned out by the sheer embarrassment of it all. Gasps rippled through the students around him, followed by muffled laughter. Someone even clapped, as if impressed by the sheer spectacle of his wipeout.<br />
Simon, already at the top of the stairs, turned at the commotion but quickly continued into the hall where the professor closed the door behind him. <br />
<br />
“Bro, you good?” A hand appeared in front of Jace’s face.<br />
Jace looked up. Some blond jock he didn’t recognize grinned down at him, offering assistance.<br />
“I—yeah, I’m fine,” Jace grunted, ignoring the guy and scrambling up on his own. His knees ached, but it was nothing compared to the hit his dignity had just taken.<br />
Jace inhaled sharply, dragging a hand down his face. He had made an idiot of himself, and now he was stuck outside. If he wanted to complete the task, he needed to wait for Simon to finish. <br />
<br />
Jace turned to the blond jock and recognition dawned on him. Jace knew this man! &quot;Hey, how&#39;s it hanging?&quot;<br />
The jock laughed. &quot;Almost to my knees!&quot; He guffawed. Jace struggled to understand the joke the man had apparently made. <br />
Jace vaguely recognized the man as Will, one of the other wrestlers. Will clapped Jace on the back, nearly sending him stumbling again. &quot;Dude, I ain&#39;t seen you at practice lately. You slacking?&quot;<br />
&quot;Uh... nah, just, uh, busy.&quot; Jace forced a grin, his brain scrambling for a believable excuse. &quot;Got tutoring.&quot;<br />
Will barked a laugh. &quot;Tutoring? Bro, what, you flunkin&#39; remedial math or somethin&#39;? Damn, Jace, ain&#39;t nobody ever accused you of bein&#39; a genius, but tutoring? Who&#39;s the poor soul stuck tryin&#39; to cram knowledge into that thick skull of yours?&quot;<br />
Jace scowled, his fists clenching instinctively. He didn&#39;t like being called dumb—even if it was starting to feel true. &quot;Simon,&quot; he muttered.<br />
Will let out a low whistle. &quot;Ohh, Simon? Nerdy little dude with the glasses? You just lookin&#39; for an excuse to spend time with him?&quot;<br />
Jace&#39;s face heated. &quot;Screw off, man. It ain&#39;t like that.&quot;<br />
&quot;Uh-huh, sure,&quot; Will smirked. &quot;Well, just to remind you, cuz you forget so often, you have practice later. Coach ain&#39;t gonna be happy if you keep skipping.&quot;<br />
Jace nodded vaguely, though his mind was already elsewhere. When Simon finally emerged from the lecture hall, Jace had forgotten why he’d even been waiting for him. He just stood there, blinking dumbly at the smaller man, mind blank.<br />
Simon adjusted his glasses and gave him a look. &quot;You still need tutoring, right?&quot;<br />
Jace snapped his fingers, grinning. &quot;Oh, yeah! The squiggly letters!&quot;<br />
Simon sighed. &quot;C&#39;mon, let&#39;s head to my dorm.&quot;<br />
Jace followed, his mind sluggish, but his body eager. Would he finally be able to finish this task?<br />
After a couple of minutes of walking, with Simon futilely trying to engage Jace in conversation about studying, they arrived at Simon’s dorm. “I life alone thankfully, you know how it is with finding accommodation these days.”<br />
“Uhuh, yeah totally.” What did that word even mean?<br />
<br />
They stepped into Simon&#39;s dorm, a basic dorm room with a bed, a desk, a sink and not much else, though Simon did have a pretty large bookshelf filled with books. Too bad they didn&#39;t have any pictures in them.  <br />
Jace flopped onto Simon&#39;s bed, stretching his arms behind his head. &quot;Dude, it&#39;s hot in here.&quot; He grabbed the hem of his shirt and yanked it over his head, tossing it aside. His broad chest and sculpted abs gleamed slightly with sweat.<br />
Simon rolled his eyes and pulled out his notes. &quot;Alright, let&#39;s focus. Greek&#39;s all about structure. You need to—&quot;<br />
&quot;Dude, do you think I got bigger?&quot; Jace interrupted, flexing an arm. &quot;Like, look at this. I swear my biceps are huge now.&quot;<br />
Simon sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. &quot;Jace, can we please focus? I actually want to finish the session this time.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m focused!&quot; Jace grinned. &quot;On how freakin&#39; jacked I am.&quot;<br />
Simon shook his head, trying to ignore the way Jace&#39;s body was distracting him. &quot;Alright, let&#39;s just start with the alphabet. Try writing it out.&quot;<br />
Jace picked up a pen, gripping it awkwardly. &quot;Uhh… squiggly letter one, squiggly letter two… bro, this one looks like a little guy doin’ a dance!&quot;<br />
Simon exhaled sharply. It was going to be a long tutoring session.<br />
<br />
Jace quickly grew bored of copying Greek letters. His head ached from the effort of focusing, and the letters kept swimming on the page. “Bro, I swear this is, like, impossible,” he groaned, flopping back against the bed dramatically.<br />
Simon barely glanced up. “It’s not impossible. You just have to—”<br />
Before he could finish, Jace smirked and grabbed Simon by the collar, yanking him forward and shoving his face straight into his armpit.<br />
“Dude, what the hell?!” Simon sputtered, jerking back, his face flushed.<br />
Jace howled with laughter. “Hah! You shoulda seen your face! Man, you’re way too serious.” He flexed his arm, waving it in front of Simon like it was some great prize. “C’mon, admit it, I smell amazing.”<br />
Simon scowled, adjusting his glasses. “You smell like gym socks and bad decisions.”<br />
Jace grinned. “And yet, you ain’t moving away.”<br />
Simon opened his mouth to argue but shut it just as quickly. He was too annoyed to admit it, but Jace’s body—his ridiculous, overgrown, over-muscled body—was distracting. It didn’t help that the dumb jock was sitting there, shirtless, sweaty, and smug, completely oblivious to how unfairly attractive he was.<br />
Simon cleared his throat and forced himself to look at the Greek notes again. “Just—just write the next word,” he muttered.<br />
Jace groaned dramatically. “Bro, I can’t do this. My brain hurts.”<br />
Simon’s eyes flicked up. “Because you never use it.”<br />
Jace gasped mockingly. “Oof! Nerd’s got jokes.” He leaned in, too close, that stupid grin still plastered on his face. “Hey, wanna know somethin’ funny?”<br />
Simon sighed. “What?”<br />
Jace suddenly grabbed his wrist, guiding his hand to rest against his rock-hard abs. “These? Yeah, these are the real Greek letters.”<br />
“That doesn&#39;t even make any sense!”<br />
“But you still haven&#39;t taken your hands of my Greek letters.” Jace grinned.<br />
Simon quickly removed his hands as if burned. “Th- that&#39;s just because you.. You..!”<br />
“Stop thinking with your head bro, and start thinking with your body.” The way Jace said that almost made it seem like he thought it was some grand revelation. Jace grabbed Simon’s wrist again and put his hand on his abs. “How about you count them for me?”<br />
Jace didn’t really know why he was acting like this. He guessed he was just taking his own advice. Being in this new form did feel really freeing in some ways. No more overthinking stuff and just going for it was his new life motto. <br />
<br />
“Six” Simon said. “Huh?” “You wanted me to count them for you doofus! So I did.” <br />
Jace grinned. “I got somethin’ else you can measure, how about you give little Jace some attention bro.”<br />
Simon looked at him, part in annoyance, but also part arousal. Simon struggled with both until he finally gave in. “Fine.”<br />
Simon unbuttoned Jace’s pants and grasped Jace’s hard cock and gave it a slow stroke.<br />
“Yeah, that’s it bro.” Simon glared at him. “I&#39;m not your bro.” Still he kept slowly stroking. Up and down. His massive jock cock engorged and already spurting some pre. <br />
“Yeah that&#39;s the stuff bro.” Jace ignored Simon’s earlier comment, though it could also be because he was too focused on his huge cock. Simon’s stroking was feeling real good.<br />
“I thought I&#39;d have to teach you this too.” Simon scoffed. “I&#39;m not some sheltered little boy, I do have some experience.”<br />
“Oh yeah? Then how about you give little big Jace a nice, long wet kiss.” Simon rolled his eyes. “Imagine giving your penis a nickname. Though I guess it fits. Maybe all your smarts were turned into cock size.” Simon gave a long lick from the base of Jace’s cock to the tip and took it into his mouth while his hand started massaging his balls. <br />
<br />
Jace moaned. Simon definitely knew what he was doing, though his comment did make him a little angry. “Yeah, no more big words now bro. Just a mouth full of my cock. I guess I’m the tutor now huh.” Jace guffawed.<br />
Simon started to pull off his dick to say something, but Jace thrust upwards and put his hand on Simon’s head. “No talking anymore smart guy, just keep on sucking.” Simon wasn’t kidding when he said he had some experience. He was already getting him close. <br />
Simon kept on sucking and rubbed his hands over Jace’s body, lightly tugging on his nipples. Jace grunted, he didn&#39;t know his nipples could feel so good. He started aggressively pounding into Simon’s mouth, but Simon pushed him back down into his chair. It seemed Simon wanted to control the pace. Thankfully he understood from Jace’s heavy breathing that he was close and sped up his pace. He couldn&#39;t take it anymore and as his dick felt like it was in heaven, Jace came into Simon’s mouth. “Ugh, take it bro!” <br />
As Jace came, and came, and came for what felt like eternity, Simon did his best to swallow the huge load. <br />
When his orgasm subsided and Simon pulled off his dick, Jace let out a satisfied sigh and smirked. “See, much more interesting than boring studying right?”<br />
<br />
Simon was still catching his breath but replied. “I hope you’ll focus better now. We’re not done with the material yet.”<br />
Jace shrugged, and as they went back to studying, he felt like he was actually learning some things. It turned out Simon was a pretty good tutor, even for a stupid jock like him, and blowing off some steam did manage to increase his focus. <br />
When they finished, Simon turned to him. “Sorry again for dashing off earlier, but I think I made up for it in other ways. Anyway, I’ll be able to use this for my extra credit, so thanks! I already marked the job as complete, though I wouldn’t mind tutoring you again if you were up for it?”<br />
Jace laughed. “Only if you let me cum down your throat first bro! That was an amazing blowjob man. Definitely wouldn&#39;t mind doing that again.” <br />
Simon blushed and turned away. “Okay, now that that’s finished, I have to get to studying for my own classes. The theory of relativity won’t study itself after all! See ya around, but next time please shower? I&#39;m afraid I have to wash my sheets again now…”<br />
“No promises bro!” Jace stood up and walked to the door. <br />
“Forgot your shirt doofus!” Jace was suddenly blinded by the shirt thrown at his face. “Huhuh, thanks bro!” Jace pulled on his sweaty shirt and walked outside. <br />
<br />
He pulled up the TaskRaccoon app and saw some more money deposited in his account, though he had trouble with the numbers. Honestly, why should anyone have to count higher than ten! People don&#39;t have that many fingers! Though he could try it with his toes. He hadn’t tried that before. Ugh, he was getting too sucked into being Jace, the previous times he had transformed he had had trouble keeping track of his real identity, and feeling like he had to walk through mud just to remember something wasn&#39;t helping with his problem.<br />
A couple of new jobs popped up on his screen though he had a hard time reading them. He knew he should pick a new job for some reason, but reasoning was currently not his strongest skill. He could pick one at random, but maybe he should get one of his smarter bros to choose for him? Or maybe Simon could help? He could also just pick one at random and see where it takes him. Jace also remembered that he had wrestling practice soon. Maybe he could try that? He’d have to leave halfway through though if he didn’t want TaskRaccoon making Jace his new default identity, but he did really want to try out this body in full. He was a wrestler now, but he hadn&#39;t even wrestled yet!</p>
