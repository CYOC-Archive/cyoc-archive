<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh...there&#39;s one last issue, though.  I can&#39;t turn into a succubus safely right now.  I&#39;ve done it too recently. Forcing it would make it  stronger, give me less control.&quot;<br />
<br />
He smiled cockily.  &quot;You just let me worry about your slut side, babe.   I can handle her.  I promise you&#39;ll end the night as a human.  From now on I&#39;m the one that controls her, not you. Now, on your knees?&quot;<br />
<br />
She trembled, her breathing ragged, but she didn&#39;t really hesitate.  She knew.  She wanted this. She wanted to became his slut, his slave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...Master.&quot; she said, as she took his hand and put it back on top of her head.  She really did like being forcefully pushed to her knees.  <br />
<br />
Luke obliged, and soon she was dutifully sucking him off again.<br />
<br />
&quot;mmm...use your tits.&quot; he commanded.   She smiled and pressed her tits together around his length with both hands, letting him titty fuck her while she sucked his tip with her mouth.  The look of lust in his eyes as he looked down on her was intoxicating.  She craved to be used, and craved to be of service to her new Master.  It was clear to see that she was pleasing him.  He seemed to be a boob guy.   She liked that.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long till his groans took on a different tone, he was getting close.  &quot;You&#39;ll swallow, and then as my cum flows down your throat, you&#39;ll trigger the change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;mmmm&quot;  she moaned her ascent as best she could around the massive cock that filled her throat.  He started thrusting faster, face-fucking her in a way that could only be described as loving violation, both hands gripping the sides of her head to hold it where he wanted it.  She barely remembered her own name, at this point, so deep into submission and pleasure was she.  She just knew that he was her Master, and she was pleasing him, and that was good.  Then with a mighty roar he came, pouring ropes of cum down her throat.  As she felt the first of it begin to flow from his twitching member, she managed to remember that she was supposed to trigger the succubus transformation.  She didn&#39;t hesitate.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Luke watched as his woman changed, horns and wings growing in, hips, tits, and ass all growing out, lips plumping up around his cock.  But as she did, she began to struggle and a hissing sound came from her throat.  The demon was resisting.  That was unacceptable.  He held her in place and pushed his cock in further.  &quot;Swallow!&quot;  he commanded.  She struggled a moment longer, but then, having little other choice, she submitted.   He held her there for several seconds after he finished pouring his cum into her belly, making sure that his dominance was clear, then he released her.<br />
<br />
She jerked her head back, hissing, and leaped to her feet.  &quot;You think you can control me?&quot;  she demanded.  This was interesting.  Normally the two personalities were not this separate.  For her human side to submit so completely while her succubus side remained unconquered was highly atypical, according to the lore he&#39;d read.<br />
<br />
Luke chuckled.  &quot;I know I can.  I&#39;m going to fuck you till you can&#39;t walk, can&#39;t think, can&#39;t do anything but whimper and moan as I make use of you, whore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fool.  What makes you so certain that I won&#39;t eat your soul when you&#39;re trying?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because then you&#39;d never be fucked by me again.  Oh there are other men you might fuck, but I&#39;m going to show you that I can fuck you better than any of them.  I&#39;m going to make you crave me above all else, until you bow down before me, and I know you crave a good fucking even more than devouring a soul, slut.&quot;<br />
<br />
He sat there smirking at her as he teasingly pointed his dick right at her.  He hadn&#39;t even gone soft after cumming that hard.  He never did after only one shot.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What makesss you thinks I&#39;ll let you even try?&quot; she hissed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the fact that I can see your pussy dripping from here, is a start.&quot; he said.  She hissed, but he saw her hesitation, her lust. &quot;Now turn around and get down on your knees,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;m doing you doggy style, fucking you like the bitch you are.&quot;  <br />
<br />
He almost had her, but she was hesitating.  She probably knew, if she let him inside her pussy, he WOULD end up her Master, and while her pussy might be screaming to let him do it, she had enough pride as a demon to not want to belong to a human. He was certain the idea was humiliating. Demons tended to think themselves superior to humans.  Well, it was time to show her who was boss.  He stepped closer, and she started to hiss, but with shocking speed he grabbed her tail, and squeezed hard right at the point before the spade.  She gasped as she fell to her hands and knees.  Her strength had evaporated, but her legs were shaking as her lust climbed all the higher.  &quot;How did you know...&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;About this little succubus weakness?&quot; he said with a smirk.  &quot;I did do my research.  Master knows all about you, Lillian.&quot; he said as he gave a little tug that made her yelp in a pleasure that was like an electric shock.  &quot;Master knows how to reign you in, how to control you, and of course, how to fuck you.  Now turn and present yourself for mounting.&quot; When she hesitated, he&#39;d decided he&#39;d had enough of her.  With one mighty movement he lifted her ass clear into the air by her sensitive tail.  She screamed in a mix of pleasure and pain.  Then he spun her around and deposited her back on the ground so that her heart shaped ass was presented to him properly.  &quot;That wasn&#39;t a request, bitch.&quot;  he said. &quot;Head down, ass up, legs spread.&quot;  Overwhelmed by a mixture of pain and pleasure, she submitted, panting.  He smiled.  &quot;That&#39;s more like it, my little whore, but you&#39;ve only begun to learn your place.&quot;<br />
<br />
He pulled on her tail again as he knelt down, pulling her closer.  She gasped in pain before hastily shuffling back to where he wanted her.  Then he pressed forward, and rubbed his cock between her ass cheeks. &quot;I wonder if I should take your pussy or your ass first?&quot;  He mused.  <br />
<br />
&quot;M-my pussy, please.  My pussy...my pussy needs it.&quot;<br />
<br />
He suddenly slapped her ass, so hard that it turned bright red, and jerked her tail again too.  &quot;Did I ask you, slut?  Your opinion is irrelevant.  You speak only when spoken to, and then you call me Master, always.  Is that understood?&quot;<br />
<br />
When she hesitated, he jerked her tail again, and as she flew towards him he impaled her ass with his cock.  Going in dry, he made her howl in pain.  &quot;Is that understood, slut???&quot; he demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;YES, MASTER!&quot;  she cried.<br />
<br />
And he went on training her like that for a while.  It was interesting to watch her reactions.  The succubus hated him, and yet needed him, while the human was for the moment deeply buried inside, and yet he could sense that she was there and not in pain.  She trusted him.<br />
<br />
He took her in the ass multiple times, and did things even more depraved, holding nothing back, but he denied her the satisfaction in her pussy that she craved, and anytime he sensed her coming near to orgasm he stopped.  After one near-orgasm he held her hands above her head, preventing her from using them to cum, and she begged and pleaded.  &quot;Please, Master, let me cum!&quot;  She said as she desperately struggled to escape.  &quot;I need it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you understand, then?&quot; he said, &quot;You&#39;re mine.&quot;  &quot;This is mine&quot; he said as he violently grasped a breast.  &quot;This is mine.&quot; he said as he slapped her ass. &quot;and this...&quot; he said as his hands delicately traced down her belly and dangerously close to her pussy, &quot;is mine.  It doesn&#39;t cum until it pleases me for it to cum, understood?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Master!  This slut exists only to bring you pleasure.  This slut humbly begs that it may please you for her to cum.&quot;  <br />
&quot;and what if it doesn&#39;t?  What if I say we stop here, you turn back, and I don&#39;t fuck you until, I don&#39;t know, a month from now?&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked horrified, but after a moment&#39;s inner struggle, as last she submitted.  &quot;Then this slut will turn back and wait till it pleases Master to fuck her.&quot;  At last he&#39;d broken her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm...good.&quot; he said.  &quot;Now...shall I fuck your pussy or not?&quot;  he mused to himself.  She moaned in desperation. Of course he would, but he enjoyed tormenting her.  He drew the moment out for a while before speaking again.  &quot;Fine then, I think I will, but first, the demon contract.&quot;  He pushed her away from him.  She nodded, and in a puff of sulfuric black smoke a contract and a needle-tipped quill appeared in her hands.  She knelt to the ground, pricked her finger, and frantically started to scribble it out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah-ah-ah,&quot; he chastised.  &quot;Penmanship, Lillian.  I want our contract to look pretty. Start over.&quot;  She was rubbing her legs together in need, but she obeyed, slowly taking her time to write out the blood contract.  When at last she was finished she presented it to him, head bowed.  He took his time reading it over, but it looked completely satisfactory.  It laid out in detail that she would be his total slave, unable to disobey him even if she wanted to.  It even gave him control over her body so that she was literally incapable of cumming without his consent.  She couldn&#39;t even PISS if he didn&#39;t want her too. There weren&#39;t any tricky demon loopholes either.  She was his.  He took the contract and signed his own name.  As the magic of the contract took hold, he watched her shudder in pleasure.  She looked up at him, her eyes begging to know how she could please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s your human half doing, by the way?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then one of her red eyes turned back to her usual purple, and she smiled.  &quot;We&#39;re both feeling wonderful, Master.&quot; she said.  &quot;though if you don&#39;t fuck us soon, it feels like we might die, Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked deep into her purple eye.  &quot;*You* I could never deny, my love.  Turn around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Master!&quot; she said with glee as she assumed the position.  <br />
<br />
Then he took her.  He took her at first slowly, lovingly, and made her coo his name, but then he picked up the pace and pounded away as savagely as he could, satisfying both of her halves, merging them back into one.  She came too many times to count. <br />
<br />
The evening&#39;s end found them sweetly wrapped in each other&#39;s arms, Lillian back in her human form.  She lay her head on his chest and played with his chest hair as she looked up lovingly into his eyes.  &quot;I love you, Master.&quot;  she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to call me that in human form, you know.&quot; he responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.  But I want to.  Even in human form, you are my Master, and that fact makes me happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke nodded and pressed his forehead to hers.  &quot;It makes me happy that it makes you happy to belong to me, love.&quot;<br />
<br />
And so happy they were...for a time.</p>
