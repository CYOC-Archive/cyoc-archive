<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Days turned into weeks and slowly he got used to some things being as they were, not that he had a choice. The update still hasn&#39;t arrived, he still felt bloated and heavy and gained even more weight. It may have been due to the hormones, or the fact he ate a bit too much since he felt hungry most of the time and had various weird cravings, especially when he had to wake up to pee in the middle of the night.<br />
<br />
The worst part was the barfing, which started around two weeks after his recent change. Every morning he woke up sick and needed to run to the toilet, which was rather hard with his sizeable belly.<br />
<br />
At one point he realized something was off. The baby was active almost constantly. Moving around, kicking, wiggling. He remembered setting his pregnancy to 8 months... but he was a bit overdue. He had a panic attack when after checking the Chronivac he realized he was 10 months along. Shouldn&#39;t it be over already? As far as he remembered pregnancies used to be only 9 months long.<br />
<br />
He almost fainted when he noticed his mistake - the Chronivac stated he had twins.<br />
<br />
The other set of genitals he gave himself was just that ... another set, with all the external as well as internal bits. To make things worse he clearly impregnated himself with one of his frequent masturbation sessions.<br />
<br />
The weight he gained may not have been weight at all. Both fetuses still grew inside him slowly, one being a 1 month old baby already but still stuck in his womb, the other being around 2-3 weeks along.<br />
<br />
His hands were shaking, too much stress, too many mistakes. He quickly laid down to bed as his baby just wouldn&#39;t stop wiggling inside.<br />
<br />
If he didn&#39;t do something soon he&#39;d just grow until... no he wouldn&#39;t pop, the Chronivac wouldn&#39;t allow for that. He needed to call them again. He haven&#39;t tried to do that since the last time.<br />
<br />
As he turned on his smartphone to find the number in the call history he noticed a notification from one of the TransDem Labs newsletters he registered to.<br />
<br />
He quickly opened it up and it was exactly what was needed to calm his nerves. An update was planned to occur next month!<br />
<br />
He just needed to wait one more month, but first he needed to solve at least some of his problems. He changed reality so that he didn&#39;t need to go to school any more. It was a chore to get up every day and ride the school bus. He postponed this decision, cause he actually enjoyed not thinking about his predicament, but now it reached a point he just couldn&#39;t cope with it any more, especially with all that movement inside.<br />
<br />
Now it was just waiting... and he waited. Days passed by, he felt glad to be a &quot;stay at home mom&quot; for the time being, although it bore him out of his mind. Most of the time he just sat in front of the TV or chat online with his friends, getting heavier and heavier from both his pregnancies, overeating and the need to constantly suck on his breasts so they wouldn&#39;t overfill and leak the fatty milk he continuously produced. If he stayed still for long enough the baby would settle for a while, at least until he woke it up by moving. Then it was hours upon hours of kicks, sometimes ending with him cumming in his boxers multiple times.<br />
<br />
If he didn&#39;t get himself pregnant before he&#39;d get pregnant from all that cum flowing down from his cock.<br />
<br />
He counted the days to the update and when it finally arrived he was elated. He gave himself one last look in the mirror before finally reverting things to normal again.<br />
<br />
He was large. He needed to stand quite far away from the mirror to even see his full self. His butt became so big if it wasn&#39;t for his enormous belly he&#39;d looked pear-shaped. His belly never settled any more remaining in constant motion. It was enough for him to be awake to feel the baby wiggling, cleary not happy to be confined for so long, distending his stomach and causing it to bounce uncontrollably.<br />
<br />
On top of that his breasts grew as well, he was somewhere in the D-F cup range. As he took off his bra they flopped on each side of his gut, too heavy and large to be even remotely perky, nipples so engorged from all that sucking they almost resembled teats. He didn&#39;t look like a cute teen mom any more, but like a pregnant pig.<br />
<br />
It gave him an idea - he pressed his nose to resemble a snout and oinked at himself which made him laugh uncontrollably. He still looked kinda cute after all, his face became extremely feminine, his hair grew out. If he wasn&#39;t clearly overdue and fat, he&#39;d probably fuck himself, not that he didn&#39;t do that a lot over the last couple of weeks.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t the time for that again though, even if the sheer thought made him erect and wet at the same time. <br />
<br />
He waddled towards the computer and sat down heavily. Even standing for too long was a chore in his current state. He needed to adjust the chair again, and even then he had to move the keyboard and mouse and place it on his belly and breasts to be able to reach it at all.<br />
<br />
He started up the update process and it proceeded smoothly...</p>
