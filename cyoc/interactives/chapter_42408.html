<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>The next stop was a little corner store. Sam wanted a slice of chocolate and raspberry cheesecake. Trish lingered outside so she could have a few minutes with the remote without Sam noticing.
<P>The options, as she knew, were extensive. She was having trouble just deciding which submenu to look at first. She could do literally anything to herself, Sam, or anyone else, with the world easily changing around them as if it was normal. She trembled with the thought of so many outrageous possibilities.
<P>The wind picked up and suddenly her vision was nothing but wildly flapping red hair. She tried to fend off the hair in her face with her free hand. As the gust died down, she had an idea of what to do first. She called up the hair setting for her cow form and adjusted the length down to 1 1/2 feet. She changed its style, however, to a full, fluffy and slightly curly one. After zapping herself, she felt the strange sensation of her hair being sucked back into her scalp. Once it retreated up to her shoulder blades, it stopped and began to thicken. Clumps of bright red locks curled around her shoulders, creating a wild and alluring appearance. With this added to her red eyes and black horns, she looked positively devilish now.
<P>She looked through the store window to see Sam paying the woman at the register. She'd be outside soon, and Trish still needed a plan. She was satisfied with herself at the moment, but she still wanted to test some things out on Sam, seeing as she seemed a perfectly willing subject. She continued looking up menus on the remote...
<P>* * *
<P>Sam was already eating a forkfull of cheesecake by the time she left the shop. She was so engrossed in her desert, and the low-lying sun was so bright, that she didn't notice the faint flash of light from something in Trish's left hand.
<P>"So, where we headed?" Sam asked Trish.
<P>"Let's just walk around," Trish said. "I'm not ready to go home yet."
<P>"In that case," Sam said, "Can we sit for a sec while I finish this?"
<P>The pair of cowgirls sat at the nearest sidewalk bench and basked in the warm sunlight on their dark fur. Sam paid full attention to her slice of cake, not realizing that Trish was staring at her eagerly. Nor did she notice the changes happening to her body, thanks to the remote.
<P>Each slice of cheesecake she swallowed caused an almost undetectable bulging in her breasts. Not only that, but her belly and hips gained tiny ounces of heft as well. Furthermore, an inch of blue hair protruded from her scalp with every gulp. These small changes slowly totaled up to a distinct change in appearance.
<P>"How's your cheesecake?" Trish asked.
<P>"It's good," Sam replied before continuing to wolf it down. "You should have had some."
<P>"Maybe I will, later," Trish said. Sam was coming along even better than she pictured her.
<P>By the time she was chewing the final bite, her breasts had swelled to large C cups and she had a gorgeous hourglass figure padded slightly by soft, huggable fat.
<P>As she swallowed to finish her meal, a new set of accessories blinked into existence upon her. Her wrists were shackled by leather bands that each had a silver square bell like miniature versions of the bell on her collar. The same things appeared around her legs just above her hooves, and near the blue cuff of her tail. Each one chimed in tiny, pleasant tones. A thick silver ring pierced the tip of each floppy black ear. Within those rings were sets of three smaller rings that clinked together with every twitch of her ears and turn of her head. Finally, the silver bell on her collar grew in size and hung heavily across her chest, clanking in a low, dull tone like a true cowbell.
<P>"Shall we get moving?" Sam asked.
<P>"Yeah," Trish said, jumping up. Sam picked herself up off the bench, causing a tumultuous sound of clangs, chimes and tinkling. She threw the paper plate and plastic fork into a trash can. Trish noticed that her hair had grown almost two feet, and was now dragging on the sidewalk. "Shouldn't you put up your hair or something?"
<P>Sam looked at Trish for a moment, then turned to look back at her hair. "No way, I like it like this, remember?" She began walking down the street in the direction of Trish's apartment.
<P>"Why?" Trish probed. "And I wasn't going to ask before, but why are you wearing all that noisy jewelry?" She was looking forward to hearing the explanation dreamt up by the remote's magic.
<P>"We're freaks compared to most of society, right? Cows normally graze in fields and wait to be milked or slaughtered."
<P>"Yeah..." Trish was suddenly uncomfortable with the way the conversation was heading.
<P>"Well I'm showing off the caricature of moo cows," Sam explained. "All the bells and collars and tags would look silly on humans, but cowgirls like us are expected to wear them instead of real clothing. We're second-class citizens in the fashion realm."
<P>"But we're treated the same in everything else, right? I mean, jobs, and stuff?"
<P>"Duh, we are," Sam continued. "I'm just rebelling against the one thing we can't do. Get it? Re-BELL-ing?" She punctuated her pun with a vigorous shake of her head, setting off her earrings and collar.
<P>"I thought you didn't care about wearing clothes," Trish said, remembering what Sam had mentioned earlier after just getting her collar and nose ring.
<P>"I don't," Sam said. "It's the principle of the thing. Say you don't like peanuts, but suddenly one day your parents tell you you can't have peanuts anymore for no good reason. Are you just gonna accept that?"
<P>Trish thought for a second. Sam had a point. And it was all because she wanted to have the remote make society accept their cow forms and relative nudity. Maybe it was time to turn themselves back to normal and reverse all this unnecessary discrimination.</p>
