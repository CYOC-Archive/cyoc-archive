<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marcia collected her photos as we split up to make our first round of qestioning any who might remember, or want to remember.<br />
<br />
I returned to the scene and began with making my way backstage. Like any other theater it was a busy place. A older man in a straw hat and red and white striped shirt seemed to be running the place.<br />
<br />
Stopping the man in his tracks I began quickly to ask about anyone looking like the missing person. The Manager stood there looking at me as he puffed on a black RG.Dun. <br />
<br />
He told me that such questions might bring me a lot of trouble and it best I leave and now. The response told me I had the right place and a good lead was soon to come my way. Then off to one side was an animal pen and Danny the wonder pony.<br />
<br />
The Manager was called away but I was sure he kept an eye out for me. Walking over to give Danny a quick visit he seemed content to munch some hay and just plain ignor me. I looked around and noted Marsha's dressing room but thought it best to question her later.<br />
<br />
Seeking what I could find, found me an old spiral steel staircase going up to the second floor. A look this way and that saw nobody looking, so up I went. One is reminded of all the junk foods you've consumed when climbing stairs in a hurry.<br />
<br />
At the top I stood and looked out into a rough sawn board lined hallway. The floor was also made of the same crude wood and this made me wonder. A fair amount of moaning and groaning filled the air as I crept out into the hall.<br />
<br />
A Callgirl and some thirty year old man were just coming up the front stairway to enter a room for relaxing times, no doubt. I had to escape and without a look opened a door and stepped inside. The voice behind me had me just about to jump back into the hallway as I turned around.<br />
<br />
There in the small 12x12 room was a bed and on it lay a naked man. The guy's wrists and ankles were tied by ropes to the bedposts. He lay there covered in some gooie and smelly black creme which was smeared from his face to his toes.<br />
<br />
Blinking back tears he begged me to cut him loose. I looked about as this private eye carries no weapons or knives. As I probed about in the dim green light I asked him how I got to were he was. The story sounded simular to what Marcia's yarn plaid out. The difference was soon to be an undenied fact.<br />
<br />
I heard foot steps coming and as the door opened this dumby slipped into the telephone booth size closet. A Callgirl and some hayseedy looking character in overalls and work boots came to stand at the man's bedside. I watched as the man told the poor tied down slob that his days living in human toil was now over. <br />
<br />
The guy screamed as an old green glass decanter was uncorked and poured into his open mouth. The Callgirl held his nose and as he had to breathe the liquid was poured.<br />
<br />
The man offered a paper of authorization for the Callgirl to sign before she got her commissions. She signed and then left the room as the older man stood watching the poor guy tied there on the bed. He began to discribe what could be expected as the liquid worked its ways into the mans guts.<br />
<br />
I was scared to death as then learned this guy was soon to be placed at the P.I. Goat farm as maybe a sire and stud. The fact of his change was told as was he then informed his change was to be permanent. This had the guy moaning and trying then to speak. All he was able to utter were goaty bleating sounds which made him the more angry.<br />
<br />
At last the older man left and I was allowed to exit the closet. I walked over to the guy as my fingers reached to untie the rope holding his left foot. I stopped short as his bare foot was a good foot long and had cloven hooves.<br />
<br />
I stopped and looked at the guy as if I didn't know what to do for him. He grunted his thoughts as I had to stand and watch as his male equipment did rapidly change. Grabbing my pocket camera I snapped a frame of the man.<br />
<br />
The creature laying there bleated wildly as I slipped out the door and into the hallway. A short look back had me to agree with myself that in maybe an hour or two the guy would leave there as a buck goat. I saw nothing I could do that would stop the man's change or help him to escape.  <br />
<br />
If that were not enough I heard a fight going on in one room and the sound of a Callgirl getting what for from one of their guests. Suddenly the door to that room opened and a half naked man headed for the front door.<br />
<br />
Moaning inside and on the floor lay the Callgirl, she looked a little used. I reached a hand to help her up and she sat down on the bed. Breathing hard and heavy from her fight she began to question me and why I wasn't feeling so good.<br />
<br />
I changed the subject but she tried to bring me back to her course. Getting up she began to undress and talked of our friendship. She went on and soon stood before me naked and reminding me of when I was a lot younger.<br />
<br />
Erect as hell I stood there as she tried to equal her quota with using me for their beastly fodder. Stepping away she seemed angered by me not wishing to jump in bed with her. Instead she got up and searching in the top drawer of and old filthy dresser she picked up a small bottle.<br />
<br />
Not being born yesterday I knew the bottle was maybe filled with something that if splattered or drank could retire me from human life and form. A struggle insued and me being trained for such was the winner. I left her two short on the quota and me in possession of the small glass jar.<br />
<br />
Hurring out the front door and mixing with the crowd I was soon back to my room at the Hotel. A message on the telephone from Marcia told of her finding something special. She and I would meet for dinner and tell what we'd seen.</p>
