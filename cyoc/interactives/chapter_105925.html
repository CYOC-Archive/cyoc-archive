<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Eric, Spencer and Frieda were enjoying each other’s company, the other Andersons had returned to their home. Samantha and Frances Twist were waiting to hear more about the day. Ben had already filled them in, which was fairly pointless given that the whole town knew what happened. <br />
<br />
Still, they wanted to hear things from the source, and not second hand. They were both surprised to see the Andersons return WITHOUT Eric in tow. <br />
<br />
“He’s with Spencer.” William said, which provided enough of an explanation. The two teenagers had become inseparable since Eric’s breakup with Julie. The catalyst for much of the days events. The question remained, was this the end of it? Surely Julie understood that she’d gone too far, and that she would have to leave bad enough alone. <br />
<br />
“The deputy filled me in. At least they won’t be charging Julie with Statue 1A.” Samantha said. <br />
<br />
“No, thank god she didn’t get her claws into him too much.” Martha glanced at a blushing Nate. They’d forced the truth about yesterday’s attack. While they were both relieved Eric hadn’t suffered any permanent damage, the concerned parents were a bit peeved both their sons had kept it a secret. Along with Julie’s other threats. <br />
<br />
“Julie’s at the station now?” Frances asked. The Andersons nodded, William choking back a growl as he thought of the spiteful weremer. She’d insulted his family, and attacked his son. The next time he saw her, William could only hope he’d be able to stop himself from doing something equally stupid and rash. <br />
<br />
“I’d better see how Melissa and Martin are doing.” Frances sighed. She hadn’t told the others about her recent chat with Melissa, regarding their marital problems, in addition to Julie’s problems. For now, it seemed appropriate to keep that to herself. Especially given the day’s events. <br />
<br />
Frances excused herself to make the phone call in another room. The Andersons and remaining Twists continued to talk in the living room. They all had one ear craned towards the kitchen, where Frances was talking. <br />
<br />
“Melissa? I understand you’ve had quite the day, but if you’re up to it, I’d really like to speak with both you and Martin at some point.” Frances said after Melissa picked up. The Stovalls were currently en route to the station to pick up their little convict. <br />
<br />
“That might be a little tricky. We’re both tethered to the house once we bring Julie back. And, no offense Frances, I don’t think your presence will help matters.” Melissa said. <br />
<br />
“No, you have a point there. They’re putting an ankle monitor on her aren’t they? That should keep her at home, shouldn’t it?”<br />
<br />
“I doubt it. If she finds a way around it, she’ll be out the house before anyone can blink.” Melissa knew her daughter. Given Julie’s history of rule breaking, Melissa didn’t think it too much of a leap to assume that Julie would try to make a break for it if either she of Martin turned there backs for too long. <br />
<br />
“I see… Give me a moment…” Frances said, an idea forming in her head. She poked her head around the corner, and saw the others in the living room idly chatting. She knew they’d been eavesdropping. It wasn’t much of a challenge to hear the conversation from the next room. <br />
<br />
“Samantha, do you think it would be at all possible to arrange some sort of police watch for the Stovalls? Just an officer or two stationed outside their house to ensure Julie doesn’t run off.”<br />
<br />
“Would she?” Samantha asked skeptically. Frances reluctantly nodded in response. <br />
<br />
“I’ll call Cooper.” Samantha rose and walked outside to make her call. <br />
<br />
“Melissa did you catch any of that?” Frances knew she had. Even if merfolk weren’t that capable above water, surely Melissa could have heard the conversation Frances just had with her wife. <br />
<br />
“Yes. Thank you Frances.” Melissa felt like some of the burden had been lifted. Or at least cut in half. Policing Julie hadn’t worked well for either parent. Perhaps they needed actual police to get their message across. <br />
<br />
Outside, Samantha got off the phone with an understandably stressed Sheriff Cooper. He agreed that after releasing Julie into the custody of her parents, he’d send an officer or two to their house. A wise precaution, as he had put it. <br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Earlier…. <br />
<br />
Brian Walker stood on the curb in front of school patiently waiting for Alyssa Cooper to arrive. He didn’t care that a fair number of students were staring at him, obviously wondering where he was going. He’d already told most of his friends he had made plan for the afternoon. With whom, he didn’t say. Which left the school abuzz as to who Brian was seeing the same day he’d dumped Julie. <br />
<br />
Brian did actually feel a little sorry for that. Well, not the breaking up part. The fact that he’d done it so early in the morning in front of everyone. Had he known that would push Julie over the edge, he would have waited until they were somewhere more private to do it. <br />
<br />
“At least Eric didn’t get hurt. Or worse.” he thought. Brian couldn’t have cared less about how Julie felt, or the fact that she was now under arrest. Like Eric, he thought she’d finally gotten what she deserved and then some. <br />
<br />
Brian preferred to do his school work at school. It was easier to concentrate. Home had too many distractions. And thankfully he didn’t have to work today. And even better than that, Brian’s mom hadn’t called him to complain about the very publicized breakup with Julie. Which he was certain she’d seen by now. An afternoon of casual fun with a gorgeous woman like Alyssa was exactly what Brian needed. <br />
<br />
Alyssa pulled up in her rental, turning almost every head in the parking lot. Being Alyssa, she’d rented the most obvious car available. It was difficult to ignore the blonde bombshell driving a sharp red Mercedes-Benz. <br />
<br />
“Brian? Nice to see you again.” Alyssa came to a slow stop. She was well aware of all the faces staring at her. She’d learned, in her years since her induction to were society, that it was better to enjoy the attention than reject it. <br />
<br />
“You as well.” Brian said, beaming. He happily got into the coupe, pausing only to give his male friends the stink eye. They wouldn’t have been more jealous of Brian. Not only had he rid himself of the anchor that was Julie Stovall, he’d managed to score himself an older, much more attractive woman. <br />
<br />
“So, how are you doing? Things seem pretty tense around here.” Alyssa drove away from the school, increasingly eager to get started. It had been a long time since she’d gone so long without feeling someone sliding themselves inside her. Her body was aching for a release, and not a self induced one. <br />
<br />
“I’lll admit I’ve had better days. But in hindsight, everything’s great.” Brian said. <br />
<br />
“Do you know if anything is going on with the Stovalls? I’ve been trying to get in contact with them all day.” Alyssa casually asked. Brian chuckled, and asked Alyssa if she liked hearing crazy stories.</p>
