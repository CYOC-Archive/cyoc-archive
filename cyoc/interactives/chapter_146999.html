“WellI am going to go inside. Be careful sis”<br />
Looking at his naked sister she was all boob and udder from her shoulders to her knees. The fur on her cow ears and hair were matted from his semen. Her chest and face were streaked with dirt stuck to his cum. Her legs were streaked with pee spatter, and all the dog cum that had dripped out of her.  What would it be like to eat her new cow ass. He wondered if he would be able to fit his whole hand or even his arm in her soft bovine butthole. He clearly remembered his sister’s gaping freshly fucked cow cunt. It was dripping with that mutt’s seed, it should have been his-<br />
“JAMES!” shouted Jess.<br />
 he snapped out of it.<br />
<br />
Jess had watched his eyes glaze over looking at her. his shirt had tented with his leaking column of a cock. she had shouted out when she saw his pants bulging. It was too high to have been his horse testes growing in so it must have been his udders<br />
<br />
“James, you are growing a horse udder. stop it.”<br />
<br />
His hands flew to the swelling on the front of his pants and then recoiled from the sensitive shrinking flesh.<br />
<br />
“Run and get a cold shower first thing. it’s the only thing that helps.  Then get clothes I’ve got to get all of this washed off of me I am going to find a horse (an image of cum squirting from her nose) gah I mean hose. <br />
<br />
James smirked he knew all he had to do was grab her ears and she would let him stuff her head full of cum again.<br />
<br />
“Stay Focused” commanded jess stomping a foot trying for emphasis. It just made her teats jiggle and her cute cow ears swing. <br />
<br />
James James cleared his head, nodded in understanding and headed for the cabin door.  Before turning and saying “Jess, that rock you found me by I think it was the way out. when I climbed that tree. he pointed to a tall tree in the distance. there is rock that makes a line in the opposite direction from the cabin We are going to have to find it again.”<br />
<br />
“ok lets do that.” Jess said hopefully<br />
<br />
James went inside.<br />
<br />
Jess stay focused stay focused I have got to find a hose, got to find a horse got to find a horse (her belly swelling with his fertile seed). No Stop! She calmed her self down and realized she was back where she started. she hoped her brother was ok,<br />
<br />
She had checked all of the outside of the house. Maybe there was a horse agh(her brother’s dick swelling as it coats her face in cum) I mean hose in the barn. Stay focused. as she waddled the pain from her over full udders helped keep her mind away from sex mostly.  Her udders were so hard and heavy. Why did she even have boobs cows didn’t have boobs. but I’m not a cow i’m not exactly human anymore but I am not a cow.  Am I? Every step caused her udders to swing painfully. She was going to have to release the pressure soon and she knew what that meant.<br />
<br />
Jess found a small side door.  The door was unlocked. She quietly opened it the lights were on there was a concrete floor and a few stalls in the small barn. She also noticed a lot of steel tubing in one corner and a large tank. It was a dairy. All set up for her.  Well, she wasn’t going to use it. <br />
<br />
“I am not a cow!” she shouted with a stomp. Even as she did she felt her red furred cow ears tilt back and her teats jiggle painfully on her udder.<br />
<br />
Near the dairy equipment he did see a hose, though. She waddled towards it. turned it on and felt the refreshing icy water hit her face.  all thought sexual and otherwise melted away.  As her top udders felt the cold water flowing over them, they contracted. she felt a spike of pain and then relief as her teats started squirting milk. as she was washing the cum from her hair and ear fur she was transfixed as the milk kept spraying and the warm relief kept growing.<br />
As she washed between her legs she felt her beastial pussy and ass for the first time. Her floppy loose pussy was still slick with semen from that mutt. She was quick about washing it but she could still feel the growing wet from her own cow juices.  she only brushed over her butthole but it felt like a pliant soft welcoming donut. She forced herself to move on down her legs.<br />
<br />
the spray from her breast teats had all but stopped and had only marginally relieved the pressure. there was no relief at all for the udder between her legs. she had washed off the worst of it and now she had to milk herself.<br />
Jess refused to use the millker she wouldn’t stoop to being milked like a cow.  some part of her mind reminded her that any way you got milk from an udder was being milked like a cow. She pushed the thought aside.<br />
<br />
 Jess kneeled down on a blanket and started tugging on on her teats each pull brought forth a tiny squirt of milk. and a little arrows all. It would take forever to get milked like this and she would have an orgasm before she finished locking in some new change.<br />
She kept adjusting her grip and getting. a little better eventually she found the most effective grip was the least comfortable for her hands. She wasn’t used to farm work and her soft hands were quickly becoming sore and stiff. <br />
she felt like she got most of the milk out of her breasts but felt like her hands were done too. her udder hurt worse than ever.  she considered her options use the milker like a cow, or get her family to help which would probably get them turned on and she would get (her mom milking her udder while licking her cow pussy) fucked. another pain in her udder. <br />
“uuurrggghh” moaned jess in frustration as she walked towards the milking station.<br />
It was simple enough to figure out a cup went on each teat. she noted the machine had six cups. it really was set up for her.  She turned the machine on and inserted a teat into the first cup. it immediately shot a jolt of pleasure/pain and started sucking large streams of milk into the machine. the pain quickly faded replaced by growing relief. the other cups were attached in the same way. The hoses were short so she had to be on her hands and knees.<br />
like a stupid cow she thought.<br />
vmmmvmmmvmmmvmmm she was just getting into the rythem of the machine it really was calming. it made her feel horny but mostly relaxed. It felt so good to get the milk out. Jess even attached the last two cups to the teats on her breasts.  This really felt right. Her brain was so agitated before but now she was really feeling her thoughts drain away down the milking tubes. <br />
<br />
She shifted her weight when saw something move out of the corner of her eye. She turned to see another cow getting milked.  Well not quite a cow it had human parts too, it was getting milked like her so it was a cow like her. Jess lost interest and just relaxed in to the rythem of the sucking machine.  the only annoyance was her growing need to be bread. she wanted a calf so bad. after she was done she could find a bull or a horse or anything really.<br />
At some point she realized a person was there. He was calm and stroked her back. He was nice and stroked her butt cheeks. he rubbed her still heavy udder.  She felt him touching her slick needy pussy she looked over and saw. the other cow had someone with her too. her slow thoughts were interrupted when the farmer easily slid two slick fingers into her soft anus.<br />
vmmmvmmmvmmmvmm went he milker<br />
“Unh” said Jess.<br />
<br />
Two fingers came out and three went in<br />
<br />
“mmm” said jess<br />
more fingers<br />
<br />
“mm-uh”<br />
<br />
something much larger stretched her butthole wide. <br />
<br />
“mMMuuuuH” said jess louder<br />
<br />
“Easy Daisy that’s a good cow”<br />
<br />
Daisy?!<br />
<br />
the thick thing thrust deep into her.<br />
<br />
“Such a good Daisy cow” <br />
vmmmvmmmvmmmvmm went he milker<br />
Wasn’t she Jess cow or?<br />
thrust even deeper rocking her body so she had to push back<br />
“MUH”<br />
<br />
“Such a pretty Daisy cow”<br />
<br />
She couldn’t tell-<br />
Thrust<br />
<br />
“such a good Daisy cow”<br />
<br />
“mUHH” said Daisy or was it...<br />
she looked down at her red furred hooves<br />
something was wron-<br />
Thrust<br />
<br />
she should- Thrust<br />
“mMUUUH” said Daisy cow<br />
vmmmvmmmvmmmvmm went he milker<br />
she-<br />
THrust.<br />
“almost there Daisy cow”<br />
almost-<br />
Thrust<br />
“Muh” <br />
...<br />
Thrust<br />
MMMMUUUUuuuh”<br />
orgasm crashed over her<br />
 the thing pulled out of her butt <br />
the man left <br />
Daisy cow contentedly waited for the milker to stop.</p>
