<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While you&#39;re stuck inside the used body of a donkey you have swapped with in a location you are not privy of knowing; trying to figure out how to use the sexual equipment without hands and without resorting to beasteality (if you can call it that; after all, you ARE a donkey now!) The &quot;donkey&quot; that swapped into you body in your bedroom was terribly all mixed up, confused, and disoriented. <br />
<br />
With its much-reduced metal capacity, it couldn&#39;t control your powerful brain that is required to control your upright human bipedal stance with 10 fingers on two hands. The donkey inside your body just simply fell off the chair, making strange noises. Considering your human mental capacity could quickly figure out how to use a donkey body, no configuration was needed. This was not the case for the donkey in your body.<br />
<br />
In order to properly function and prevent fatal consequences, the chronovac had a failsafe to readjust the donkeys mentality in you body to be more suitable for your body. And so, the donkey slowly became less confused.<br />
<br />
It figured out how to sit up. Then to stand. It walked over to a mirror, and looked at your reflection and began to understand what it was looking at. Then it began taking on some if your memories while retaining its own. It realized you had used a device to swap bodies with him.<br />
<br />
The donkey (slowly becoming more and more &quot;you&quot;) went over to the machine and looked it over. Slowly it began to realize it was looking at what are called &quot;words.&quot; And by degrees, began to understand what they meant. <br />
<br />
It also began forming more and more memories of your past life. How much of an advantage that humans have. Then it began to realize you had a humiliating fetish of turning into various things, and swapping bodies with a donkey was one such fetish. <br />
<br />
The donkey in your body also began to take on the same fetish. But it still retains all of its memories of its past life. How depraved and lowly it was. The donkey in your body slowly began to desire to remain human. To stay on as you, and to live your life instead. It began to remember the &quot;timer&quot; option. It wouls swap back, if the human in its farm animal body were to ejaculated! Which means, it could occur at any time. <br />
<br />
But the donkey was confused while looking at the machine. It only just began to understand the written word. But then the familiarity of manipulating the machine began to come to it.....<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, back in the donkeys body, you started to become desperate. The enormous black donkey donkey you had inherited is now beyond all proportions of size than you could have imagined as it was now fully engorged and began pumping up and down, slapping against your white furry belly. You were trying to spread your nonexistent fingers, and speak, and imagine being trapped like this in order to spur it on. You had no hands, but the experience was so new and exotic, you didn&#39;t need hands. It was so fresh, that you were getting closer to the point of no return! <br />
<br />
You were so enraptured by this experience, that you didn&#39;t know another male jack ass came up from behind you. This one was taller, stronger, and much leaner than the body you had inherited. It was an alpha male. <br />
<br />
While you were busy trying to ejaculated this heavy penis beneath you and between your legs, you suddenly felt a heavy weight come down on your back! This disrupted your imaginings, as you felt and saw two legs clamp around your middle. Then looking back further, you saw an even larger penis of the male donkey that has come to subdue you! <br />
<br />
Your goal forgotten for the time being, you panic and start moving forward the escape. But your rapist is strong and you&#39;re not used to controlling your inherited body yet. He used his forelegs to clamp down on your sides harder, and pulled his back end closer to you. &quot;Eerrggh hhaaww eerrgghh hhhaaww!&quot; You said, instead of the words &quot;get away!&quot; Several times.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, in your bedroom, the former donkey is figuring out how to use the chronovac. He begins to make changes, seeing as you left the editor unlocked for the duration of your predicament. The very first change he made, was to make the switch permanent. No way was he going back to that life! <br />
<br />
Then he changed your survival instincts to take over if your life depended on it. Such as feeding yourself and drinking, even from a filthy used trough that other animals already drank from before you. <br />
<br />
He also adjusted several different &quot;discomfort&quot; sliders. Such as making you permanent miss your hands. So much so, that you will always have a near-panicing feeling  feeling of claustrophobia for your hooves. A strong feeling of need that your &quot;hands&quot; are &quot;stuck.&quot; Like being forced to permanently wear boots on your feet you could never take off ever again. But for your hands that were replaced by hooves, forever. <br />
<br />
He made your &quot;discomfort&quot; at forever remaining on all fours. Gave you a sense of great indignity and shame. Same with your big tall, broad ears, that will forever crown your head as a donkey. <br />
<br />
He gave you an overwhelming desire to wear clothing. To cover yourself up, and to hide your disgusting animalistic gigantic rod between your legs. He made that thick black penis and your balls feel extra heavy and wobbly, as a constant reminder of your nasty pukish equipment. <br />
<br />
Your inability to speak will always hit you like a Thundercats everti.e you attempt to speak. You&#39;ll always have nasty, sour breath which would never go away, and always taste bad.<br />
<br />
As a finishing touch, he made you feel trapped inside this body, especially when it goes into automatic mode to graze, drink, piss, shit, and be raped by the larger and stronger jackass. Matter of fact, he gave that other donkey &quot;ownership&quot; over you. You will only drink from the trough when he&#39;s done. You&#39;ll only eat behind him with his ass in your face, as a reminder of what your ass now looks like. Even when he sits and passes, you&#39;ll have no control over when and where you take bites behind him.<br />
<br />
And finally, he put a &quot;lock&quot; on your profile. Never again, will another chronivac be able &quot;free&quot; you from this horrible existence. He wanted to make damn sure you&#39;ll never have a chance at spoiling this life for him.<br />
<br />
Back at the farm, you felt the penis of the other bury itself in your ass. It nailed your prostrate, even as you momentarily reminded yourself that this isn&#39;t beasteality. You ARE the same species as your rapist. A donkey. The thought with your prostrate being hit, made you horn all over again. <br />
<br />
&quot; eeerrgghh hhaaww eerrgghh hhhaaww&quot; you breathed as your will for resistance began to vanish. This shouldn&#39;t be long anyway,, and in no time, you&#39;ll be human again. Besides, you needed the assistance.<br />
<br />
His penis began to rhythmically hit your prostate, as you entered a period of bliss, and you began to approach climax...<br />
<br />
Back in your room, the donkey-turned-you clicked save. Just as you reached climax, a voice from the chronivac came to your head, and explained everything. At the end, it used the heart-dropping words:<br />
<br />
&quot;You are now this donkey. Forever! Enjoy your new life!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Wait! No!&quot; &quot;Eerrgghh hhhaaww&quot; but then in this moment, you decided you couldn&#39;t care less as you heard your bray-covered words and felt the physical desires. You were literally living your fetish. <br />
<br />
Finally, the donkey on top came inside of you, just before you were about to. He greedily dismounted and immediately went to grazing while he left you unattended and struggling to finish as his already-forgotten and cooling gallon of jackass seed is dribbling out of your big black round butt hole. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eerrghhh hhaaw eerrgghh hhaaww eerrgghh hhhaaww&quot; you can&#39;t speak! You try to lift your arm and beat off, but you have no hands. You....you....begin to feel trapped in so many different ways! Your brain reminding you of the message that &quot;flashed&quot; across it. You&#39;re a donkey now, and forever! The actual donkey has stolen your life, and this is the life you inherited from it! <br />
<br />
&quot;Errrgghh hhaaww eerrgghh hhaaww eerrrgghhh hhaaww!&quot; You can only bray at the injustice of it all.</p>
