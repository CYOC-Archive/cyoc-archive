<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Zach knelt there, his mouth watering the searing heat inside of him grew stronger by the moment, feeling as though hellish flames lapped at his skin from beneath the surface. Zach moaned as he felt his pleasure arise, growing to an unimaginable strength. Suddenly, the room began to spin while Zach started to feel light headed. Opening his eyes once more to look at Kyle, the world around him went into slow motion and then stopped. Everything was still and frozen in place, Kyle was unmoving like a mannequin in a department store used to model this or that. Zach looked to the nearby clock, seeing the second hand stood where it last ticked. Not knowing what was going on, Zach moaned in a combination of pleasure and grief. He was moments away from getting to his prize, but now something unknown had happened and only I was left to move around as I needed.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, I could feel the weight of my body begin increasing exponentially, feeling as though I was weighted down and sinking. Slowly things seemed to be getting much taller as I slowly decreased in height. At first I thought I was shrinking for some unknown reason from the demon imp playing a joke on me, but I realized I was being pulled through the floor and slowly picked up speed. Before I knew it, the world around me was all a blur, the cop uniform I had been wearing was gone leaving me naked and I was descending further and further, faster and faster till I was abruptly stopped and my surroundings slowly cleared.<br />
<br />
As I got my bearings and my vision cleared, I discovered that I was sitting upon a stone throne in a massive and long throne room that was empty for the most part, except there were several and massive columns that flanked both sides of the room. I groaned, which slowly grew deep and turning into a half howl, feeling my body begin the first parts of it&#39;s initial transformation. I watched wide eyed as the keratin of my fingernails lengthened slightly, darkening, honing into tipped points. They were more humanesque claws than what I would expect from a werewolf. Suddenly I could taste the iron tinged flavor of my blood pouring into my mouth as my top and bottom bicuspids grew thick at the base pushing the other teeth around, breaking the lining of my gums throughout the entirety of my mouth. I groaned as he felt them lengthen, growing sharp, looking like really sharp human incisors at the moment. While that was happening my ears burned and tingled like a thousand ants were biting them both at the same time. I could feel them stretching, changing and molding into something new. The lobes grew longer, but slightly as the honed to blunt pointed tips, breaking in the middle as the top bent at an angle toward the back of my head with the rest of the ear remaining the same. I could feel the skin of my nose grow tense, taut and leathery as it darkened and flattened. I grinned at the thought of what was happening and I could feel the wolf just below my skin ready to get out as a dark figure began to emerge from the entrance of the throne room.<br />
<br />
I grinned as the figure walked closer and closer to me as I could feel my muscles slowly growing, bulking up my body everywhere as I could feel the bones begin to prepare for what was upcoming. As the figure came into view, I smiled seeing the athletic and lithe male approach me smiling. His body was naked, save for a leather collar studded with round toppers, with a big steel loop and prong to fasten it around his neck in back. In the front, there was a large D ring that would keep him attached to a lead like a dog to a leash to be led around. I smiled knowing that he was one the imp promised me, my mini fangs glinting in the low light from the fires that illuminated the hall hanging from the ceiling. The man continued to come closer and closer to me and I could see his six inch length cock that was an inch and a half across, hard and throbbing, jutting straight out from his pelvis.<br />
<br />
As he got closer, he began to speak. &quot;Master... you are here! I have been waiting to feel your presence since I was promised to the one who would form an army of demonic creatures of his choosing to take the Earth and the mortals. It is as the Dark Lord prophesied. You are His champion to show God that Lucifer was right... humans are lesser than he and that you would destroy Lucifer&#39;s creator and bathe the universe in His dark crimson light and glory. My master...&quot; He said trailing off as he stood meters away from me. &quot;Permit me to come unto you, to be your first damned soul to be gifted and to bring out your glory. For my dedication to the cause, I was promised to you to serve you as you saw fit. To please you and bring out your full form.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zach grinned as he was on his knees, his head bowed to not look at me out of reverence, respect and submission. &quot;My Dark Lord... if you would have and let me, I beg your permission and pleasure your flesh. The more pleasure the darker your true form and pleasure is much more heightened for us... especially for you. I beg of your permission to release your magnificent form unto all. If your Lorship so desires, I beg of you to make me your first, subjugate me to your dark will and take what you would. No permission needs to be expressed to you as you rule over all!!!&quot; He begged on his knees, moaning as he spoke, making my cock tinge and twitch loving the power I had over such a creature.<br />
<br />
This would be magnificent for sure and the best reward he could get for his soul. I looked at him and bellowed, &quot;Look at me!&quot; in such a voice it made him quiver, which made me chuckle as the demon soul in me continued to grow stronger as this human bowed his will to me. He was worthy, he knew his place and he would no longer be weak and pathetic. No... He would know the pleasures and joy of fully releasing his Dark Lord unto the multiple dimensions of the universe. As he looked up I could feel his damned soul slowly entering my being, feeding me, opening him up to implanting him with a demon soul and releasing the twisted form that lurked within. My eyes bored into his and he moaned &quot;so warm... so hot... that&#39;s it Lord, drain my soul and feed!&quot; He looked to me in that moment and I turned my hand up, motioning with one partially clawed finger for him to approach. Doing as instructed, he remained on his hands and knees like the dog that he was, crawling to approach me.<br />
<br />
I looked down upon him, grinning, reveling in how much more I fed from him as I could feel the demon growing as the wolf swelled around it. &quot;Pleasure me! Make me your bitch and make me feel pleasure like I&#39;ve never known!&quot; I bellowed.<br />
<br />
At my feet, he ground his face into my human feet and lower calves, nuzzling into me, showing me that he was my bitch. In the moment he heard my words spoken, he paused in confusion, not knowing what to do. &quot;M-my Lord...? You want me to make you submit to me?!?&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked at him feeling flameless fire burning from my sockets, &quot;do you not want to lead my army? Do you not want to be my first? Do you question my wishes?&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked down at my clawed feet in shame. &quot;Yes m&#39;Lord, but is just not something I expected from a Lord of Hell. We are subjugated by you... never giving permission for such actions. I shall do as you say.&quot; He said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You said my form will be stronger by the intensity of the pleasure I feel! I want my form to be insanely demonic. I am giving you the power and freedom to allow you to pleasure me in any intense way you want. Nothing is off limits, but you will drink my full load when I cum!&quot; I explained to him as his eyes widened and the revelation he had made him understand his master&#39;s intentions.<br />
<br />
The male climbed up between both of my thighs, running them deftly, sending chills of erotic pleasure running through every inch of my body, my cock throbbing in reply to his touch, slowly growing as the blood filled the corpuscles to the brink of ripping, but extending and stretching adding girth slowly to accommodate your surplus of blood. I moaned feeling my lust soar as my cock began to lead. I humped at his hands while I sat there as my instincts took over and he chuckled as he saw a thick, syrupy bead of pre that rose from the tip and spread out to cover the head evenly. Slowly he trailed his hands up my hairy muscle gut, making sure to hit every nerve and fold to keep me on a constant sexual high, as he moved up to my large pectorals.<br />
<br />
&quot;My Lord...&quot; He said trailing off, breathing hot and heavily against my neck and into my ears, playing with my nipples as I could feel my pecs swell and bulge. &quot;I&#39;m going to make sure certain parts of your body are the largest of them all!&quot;<br />
<br />
I grunted in reply, my mind full of lust and that was all I could do to vocalize my approval. As he continued to work over my nipples, he could feel my pecs swell to the size of watermelons and then stopped once they reached the size of beer kegs with my nipples firm enough to cut glass. Then he moved on to my shoulders, playing with and kneading the muscles slowly increasing them to the size of cantaloupes. Down each arm he went, not focusing on the triceps very much, but working over the biceps making my upper arms the size of watermelons, then down my forearms making them muscles and perfectly tapered to my wrists. Then he took each finger into his mouth, sucking on them one by one, swirling his tongue around the appendages and I felt my fingers thicken, becoming puffier as they itched with multicolored fur sprouting from the flesh there. As he drew each one, I could see each change he made, my finger pads were now thick, black, soft and fluffy. The hairs were wiry and thick; black at the roots, cherry chocolate brown at the body, the tips crimson red like blood. As he slowly pulled off the finger, his lips slipped off a four inch long obsidian black talon. Once each finger was reformed, he went down to my feet and did the same. As he changed my feet, my legs snapped and popped, reforming to a triple joint to make me stand in the digitigrade stance. Fur blossoming up my legs and spreading out everywhere like wildfire. My skull began shifting now, my face pushing out into a lupine muzzle gas my upper fangs grew massively, forming what looked like tusks past my lower jaw, the tips extending past it by an inch. My eyes shifted, losing all semblance of a once human appearance, becoming crimson and glowing like fire without an iris or pupil. As my head reshaped, my ears migrated to the top of my skull, blossoming into fully triangular lupine ears that swiveled and moved like satellite dishes. I moaned as my to tongue flattened in my mouth, widening and forked while becoming incredibly dexterous. With the majority of my body done, he moved down to my midsection which he left till last. He expertly wrapped his mouth and tongue around my shaft, fondling my balls with one hand and another pressing under me, snaking and pushing his way to my hole.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lift!&quot; He demanded as he came off my cock and I relented, curious to what he was going to do.<br />
<br />
He stroked my cock with the same hand, coating it in my copious and syrupy preseed. He then moved his hand back to my ass, slicking it with my own lube, pressing his two fingers against my quivering pucker. Without any warning he shoved them in, fingering me as he worked my cock and balls. My balls swelled to the size of grapefruits while my cock ballooned in his mouth, stretching his jaw and bulging against the flesh, showing as he worked. I could feel my spine lengthening, while growing thicker and bones changing. Without warning he hit my prostate making my back arch and my cock jump. He ravaged it again and again, making me jump and shove my cock down his throat as I watched it bulge. I chuckled hearing my voice as dark and as sinister as anyone could imagine sounding like a thousand deep and dark voices speaking all at once. I reveled in how I felt, feeling my cock twitch, jump and spasm as a load so massive erupted from my cock it defied logic. Volley after volley pulsed into his stomach as he moaned feeling my demonic seed starting to change him immediately. I roared something deep and sinister, as things all changed again. Massive black horns burst from my skull above my brows, twisting like a corkscrew till it reached a length above the tips of my ears. My tail wolffish in essence shifted, the tip flaring out to a large spade while thick, five inch long spikes erupted from each vertebrae. Suddenly bones and new muscle developed as bone and skin erupted from my back. Quickly the flesh twisted and contorted, then unfolded into black bodied and red accented demonic wings with spikes at each downward tips. Zach roared and roared, his wings flapping as the torrent of cum slowed. Zach looked down to his pup, noticing he drank all his jizz like a champ not missing a beat as he nursed on the dreggs that lingered behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm what a fuckin good pup you are and you&#39;ll soon take your true, freed form!&quot;</p>
