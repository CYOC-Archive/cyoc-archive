<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sun had long set before Matt woke up, the fur had retreated into his body as he had transformed back in his sleep. Meanwhile his sister was still a wolf, stuck in her form until her soul had been tainted by the taste of human meat. Outside he could hear the tornado alarms blare, a sign that the pack was expanding its ranks and running wild through town and the humans were trying their best to keep everyone in doors. <br />
<br />
He pulled out of his sister&#39;s abused canine vagina, watching his milky white seed drip from it before going and changing clothes. It did not take long before he could hear the gravel churn as his father&#39;s truck pulled up to their small house. He made his way back into the living room and placed a hand on his sister&#39;s furry head as she began to waken. &quot;Not yet.&quot; He commanded, rubbing her underneath the muzzle. <br />
<br />
&quot;The fuck is going on.&quot; Their father stumbled in, looking out of his mind as he fished a set of keys out of the kitchen drawer. &quot;Wolves attacking the mall, coming out of everywhere.&quot; He did not even acknowledge his son as he ran toward the bedroom to unlock his shot gun. <br />
<br />
&quot;Get your sister Matt, no mutt is going to drive me out of my house.&quot; He continued to ramble, not even noticing as Matt stepped up to him, grabbing the shotgun and twisting the metal with ease, destroying the muzzle of the gun. <br />
<br />
&quot;This house doesn&#39;t belong to you.&quot; Matt delivered a swift punch to his father&#39;s face, enough to send the overweight man tumbling to the ground unconscious. <br />
<br />
Matt moved quickly, rushing past his sister who padded into the room to see what the noise was. His first move was to retrieve the hand saw from the garage, and then some bandages and the iron from his mother&#39;s belongings. He had little fear that his sister would attack his father, even as a wolf she was still a cub and far too docile for something like that... yet. <br />
<br />
Returning back to the old man, he went to work, cutting in just above the knee, the smell of blood and fresh meat as he tore through the arteries began to excite the wolf in him, his tail slowly snaking its way out of his underwear. The bone of course was the hardest part, but after what felt like an eternity of cutting he made it through the flesh. Now a quick press on the wound with the hot iron to cauterize it and a quick bandage job, and he was reasonably sure that his father would survive. <br />
<br />
&quot;THE FUCK!&quot; Anthony screamed as he was woken from his stupor, the searing pain enough to bring him back to the world as Matt moved the iron away and began to bandage the wound. &quot;What has gotten into you?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Evolution.&quot; Matt replied with a wicked smile, showing off his bright golden eyes and slightly lengthened fangs. He grabbed the leg and brought it over to Ashley, her tail wagging swiftly as he rubbed the bloody flesh against her muzzle. &quot;Eat it.&quot; He commanded.<br />
<br />
The wolf that was his little sister wasted little time, ripping away at flesh, muscle, and meat as she buried her muzzle into what was her own father&#39;s flesh. &quot;Your complete now.&quot; He stroked her bloody face lovingly as she finished eating, leaving most of the ankle and foot untouched. <br />
<br />
Ashley stumbled back, her bloody red fur began to shrink into her body, her legs crunched and twisted back into shape, while her razor sharp claws retracted back into now delicate fingers. Inch by inch her tail crunched back into her body as if it were being sucked in one bone at a time. Her muzzle pushed back into her face, her nose twisting and shrinking until it was nothing more than the button nose that he had always adored. With everything finished there was just a few changes that Matt had noticed, her once short pony tail hair now traveled down to her butt as a wild mane, and her once smooth Vagina now had a short small bush of almost red fur crowning the top. <br />
<br />
 &quot;Holy crap, everything is so different.&quot; She stretched out her arms, marveling at them as if seeing them for the first time, her small tongue rubbing against her sharpened canines. She paused a moment before turning to regard her brother, her pack mate, her alpha. &quot;THAT HURT!&quot; She screamed, punching him as hard as she could in the arm. <br />
<br />
Grabbing his sore shoulder, Matt turned to his sister and gave a soft whine. &quot;Does that mean you didn&#39;t enjoy it?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t say that.&quot; She turned her head away, toward her father who remained slumped against the wall, his mind unable to process what he was seeing. &quot;What do we do with him?&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt gave a glance at the man before turning away to get both of their phones. &quot;He&#39;s nothing to us now, he&#39;s beneath us, just meat, wounded meat. We need to find out what the other wolves are doing, the town is going to be divided among the wolves before the end of tomorrow.&quot; He scrolled through his feed, getting an update on how quickly the wolves were making their way through town, and how the police and soon to be the national guard were responding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bro..&quot; Ashley spoke up drawing her brother&#39;s attention, she shrunk back like an animal in front of a dominant predator. &quot;Umm Alpha, I may be able to help.. my friends, they are hiding in their homes, could we add them to the pack.&quot; She paused and then pressed her small breasts against her brother, her body heat warming him. &quot;Please?&quot; She whispered</p>
