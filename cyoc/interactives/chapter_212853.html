<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Elder Aaron and Elder Wyatt rode out of the neighborhood and on to their next few house calls.  They had quite a busy day. A day full of rejection but also opportunity.  Every door slammed in their face just represented a person who wasn&#39;t ready to here the message of salvation given to them by Joseph Smith.  Those that listened were the seeds that fell on fertile soil.  Souls seeking truth, souls striving for goodness.  <br />
<br />
Four months in to their mission, Aaron and Wyatt were becoming friends too.  Things were looking up.  <br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t until about eight at night that things started to take a turn.   <br />
<br />
Aaron started to feel funny. It started with a bit of itchiness that got progressively worse.  He pulled his bike over and told Elder Wyatt he wasn&#39;t feeling well.  He hadn&#39;t noticed it at the last house,  but Elder Wyatt was looking a little pale and out of sorts too.  <br />
<br />
They had agreed that it was probably better for them to knock off early and go back to the apartment.   <br />
<br />
The bike ride home got got progressively worse for Aaron.  The itchiness got worse and worse.  Then he realized he was sweating.  Not just a little bit either, he was starting to sweat through his clothes.  <br />
<br />
Finally, after what had felt like forever, they pulled up in front of the small apartment the church had let them stay in for their mission.  <br />
<br />
Aaron pulled up and stowed his bike, itching as he did so.  He got his key in the lock and left the door open for Wyatt but grabbed his pjs and his shower kit and jumped into the bathroom.  <br />
<br />
By the time he was getting the door shut and locked with one hand, he was already undoing his tie and pulling apart the buttons on the shirt as fast as he could.  <br />
<br />
Pulling off his shirt and shucking off his pants, he stood there in his white temple garment.  But something was off.  His garments were soaked through with sweat.  What&#39;s worse, instead of pale skin hiding behind the cotton-stretch fabric, it was darker. <br />
<br />
Elder Aaron, lifted up the shirt half of his temple garment.  What he saw disgusted him.  Under the shirt was a pelt of body hair. Before, he had a modest dusting of hair on his chest but now, he was covered.  Dark wiry hairs covered his arms chest and pecs.  Lifting his arms, he saw the sweaty twin forests that were his pits.  The strangest thing was that the hair stopped where his temple garments stopped.  That wasn&#39;t the only strange thing. Dropping his arms and looking once more at his chest.  Gone were the normal nipples he had all his life.   Instead, a pair of thimble sized nubs jutted from the forest of fur.  Aaron touched one and it was like electricity was surging through his body.  He felt his hips lurch and the crotch of his temple garment tighten.  <br />
<br />
Without thinking, Aaron yanked down the shorts of his temple garment.  Just like with his upper body, the dark wiry hairs stopped where the shorts of his garment stopped but that wasn&#39;t what grabbed his attention.  <br />
<br />
Instead, he was staring at the dark appendage hanging between his legs, not yet hard but getting there.  <br />
<br />
It was completely foreign to him. Compared to the short thin cock that he had known for literally his entire life, the tube of flesh hanging in front of him was monstrous.   Aaron turned his hips and saw the low hanging balls behind the drooping meat.  <br />
<br />
Hesitantly, he reached down.  His hand didn&#39;t fully encircle it.  He felt the heavy balls below jump when he grasped it.  Sliding his hand down, it was like fireworks went off in his head.  He had masturbated before but he had known it was wrong.  Still, he couldn&#39;t help himself. <br />
<br />
He slid his hand back toward his torso, pulling back the dark skin to reveal a bright pink head.  The smell that hit him was pungent and vinegary, musky and dirty.  Aaron noted the yellowish white material coating the tip.  <br />
<br />
He tried to stop himself.  This was wrong, his body was wrong, his penis was wrong but the smell and the intensity of his arousal was impossible to deny.    He began to stroke himself, his cock fully hardening, his new foreskin and sensitivity bringing the sensation to a greater heights than he&#39;d ever experienced.  Aaron grasped and rolled his nipple with the thumb and forefinger of his other hand, feeling the pleasure of the sensation push him over the edge.  <br />
<br />
Elder Aaron shot glob after glob of hot spunk on his reflection in the mirror.  <br />
<br />
After it had subsided, he stood there gasping, some of the spent cum matting the fur on his chest and body.  <br />
<br />
Aaron stared at himself like a man awakened from a trance.  Then, panicking, he began to rapidly clean the mess he made.  <br />
<br />
After cleaning up all of the cum he could find, Aaron got in the shower. He washed his body vigorously, avoiding his most sensitive areas.  Only succumbing to the temptation once more under the pulsing heat of the shower. <br />
<br />
Aaron toweled off now convinced that his body wasn&#39;t a trick or his mind.  Aaron pulled on a clean temple garment and then his pjs, noting to himself the new tightness in his pajama pants but grateful that the garments covered what was going on with his body.  <br />
<br />
Elder Aaron came out of his bathroom and went straight to bed, not even looking at Elder Wyatt who seemed to be engrossed in his reading at his desk.</p>
