<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brian walked back to the Wakefield farm, his strong legs easily carrying him the three-mile distance. He enjoyed the walk, the air around him, the trees to either side of the road. He felt good when he was outdoors and exerting himself, even if it was mild exertion, like now. <br />
<br />
When he arrived at his destination, Brian set about to work. He packed up his tools and gear and headed to the fields. Once there, he set about to work, ploughing the fields and then seeding them. As midday approached and the sun was high in the sky, Brian pulled off his dirty, torn shirt, exposing his powerful torso. Sweat glistened on his thick muscles as he toiled in the fields. It was immensely gratifying work. He was in his element, using his strength to move the soil, his days as yet another orphaned urchin beggar long behind him. Here he was useful. Here he had purpose. <br />
<br />
As was so often the case, Danny came out to bring Brian his lunch. Danny was the Wakefield&#39;s bookish son. He was slight of stature and Brian loomed over him, even though their ages were the same. The two young men sat together under a shady tree, and Brian ate the tasty lunch that Danny had brought. Technically, it was leftovers from the Wakefield&#39;s lunch, but to Brian it always tasted wonderful, due to his previous hard life on the streets. Danny massaged Brian&#39;s powerful shoulders as the farmhand ate, Danny&#39;s fine fingers practiced at working out the knots and kinks that formed therein. Brian occasionally grunted in thanks, both for the food and for the massage. As he finished his hearty meal he stood, thanked Danny, and then strode back out into the fields, the sun beating down on his big, tanned, muscular body. Danny sat back and watched for a bit, admiring Brian&#39;s physique from afar as the latter worked in the fields. As always, Danny would eventually leave, returning to the house and to his studies. Brian didn&#39;t mind the solitude. He knew that he would see Danny again soon. <br />
<br />
***<br />
The attraction was incongruous, Danny knew. He was an educated, sophisticated young man, learned and clever. Brian was simple, ignorant, and slow. Yet Danny still found himself attracted to the big brute. Danny had tried to rationalize it a dozen ways, but none of them worked. He wasn&#39;t attracted to every brute, just to Brian. He was fascinated by the big dummy, even though objectively there was nothing to be fascinated by. It was as if Brian had hidden depths, waiting to be explored. Yet Danny could not break through that barrier, whatever it was, that held him back from discovering the true Brian. Sigh. At least there was more to Brian than that strange mystery that only Danny seemed to recognize. There was also Brian&#39;s body, big and powerful. And there was Brian&#39;s cock and balls, similarly large and impressive. Danny hated to admit it, even to himself, but he liked those aspects of his family&#39;s farmhand very, very much. <br />
<br />
***<br />
As evening came, Brian finished sowing the last field. He packed up his things and headed to the barn. He put away his tools and gear, and then headed for the house. As always, he took a side door down to the basement, where he had his simple quarters. As always, Danny was there, waiting with dinner. Brian ate hungrily, devouring the offered plate of meat, bread, and vegetables, while Danny massaged his strong back. <br />
<br />
Danny&#39;s hands roamed Brian&#39;s strong torso, pressing against the taut muscles, feeling their warm hardness. The close proximity made the smell of sweat and grime on Brian&#39;s body that much more pungent. It was unpleasant. Danny didn&#39;t know why it turned him on so much. <br />
<br />
As Brian ate, Danny&#39;s hands roamed his big body expertly. Working out the stress and strain of the day, preparing Brian for the day of toil to come. But first, there was one more duty to perform for the evening. Danny&#39;s hands moved beyond easing tired muscles. The young scholar began to reach around Brian, fondling his strong pecs, teasing the proud nipples. Brian grunted in approval, finishing off the last bits of his dinner. Danny&#39;s hands worked their way down his strong torso, down to his legs. Down to the growing bulge between them. <br />
<br />
Brian quickly became erect. He pushed aside his plate and turned to face Danny, a small grin on his face. He stood and pulled down his ragged pants, exposing his powerful legs and big, hard tool. Danny gulped softly, making Brian&#39;s grin broaden. The hulking farmhand yanked Danny&#39;s pants down, exposing the smaller man&#39;s lower body. In moments Brian was atop him, grinding his large physique against the smaller one that lay prone on the cheap bed. &quot;Oh yess...&quot; Danny moaned softly, his hands caressing Brian&#39;s big arms and shoulders. Brian was single-minded. He roughly pushed Danny&#39;s legs apart and aimed his big dick for Danny&#39;s sweet hole. <br />
<br />
Danny gasped as Brian entered him. He should have been used to the pain, but he felt it nonetheless, reminding him of his first time with the big lug. Brian pushed in hard, grinding his large body against Danny&#39;s smaller one, grunting and groaning as he fucked his boss&#39; son. Danny clawed at Brian&#39;s big muscles, his fingers barely digging into the hard masses of rock-solid flesh. As usual, the effort only turned Brian on more. He grunted as he renewed his efforts, fucking Danny harder and faster. The latter just moaned with pleasure, trying to grab every part of Brian&#39;s big body at once, enjoying the sensation of such a big dick ramming him. At last though, even Brian&#39;s stamina began to run out. Exhausted from the day, he shot a big load into Danny&#39;s small body. The smaller man groaned in approval, feeling Brian&#39;s big member throbbing and thrashing inside him as the big man came. <br />
<br />
Within minutes it was all over. As usual, Danny tried to pull away, but Brian wouldn&#39;t let him. Instead the hulking farmhand pushed his body up against Danny&#39;s, wrapping his powerful arms around his small lover, holding him close. In minutes Brian was asleep, sated with dinner and sex. And as usual, after a few minutes of this, Danny managed to slip away, wiggling out from under Brian&#39;s powerful arms, sneaking off to his own room quietly. He took one last look at Brian, sighed with desire and regret, and went on his way.</p>
