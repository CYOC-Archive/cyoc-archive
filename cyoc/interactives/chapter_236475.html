<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Leah was woken up by a rising pressure in her tummy. She groans in discomfort, shifting in her seat enough to allow a droning fart to escape. She probably shouldn&#39;t be too surprised that there&#39;s still some gunk left in her guts, even after her nasty accident. And here she was, actually starting to relax.<br />
&quot;Oh, sounds like you need to go potty. Should we stop somewhere? We still have quite the drive left.&quot; Rita commented. Leah just groaned again, very much not in the mood to be in public anymore. Or doing anymore movement, really. She&#39;s so tired, she&#39;d honestly rather hold it.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine. I just want to go home. Honestly, I think it&#39;s just gas.&quot;<br />
&quot;Did you think it was just gas in the giftshop?&quot;<br />
Leah stopped sucking her pacifier as she thought on that (and also re-acknowledged she&#39;s still sucking on that thing. Should she...stop?). She probably shouldn&#39;t tell Rita &#39;no, she just ignored the signs entirely until she was shitting herself, so she&#39;s actually doing much better job at potty training at the moment.&#39; Really, the feeling in her stomach felt like it was more than gas, but she just wanted to sleep in the car seat until she could get to bed, and not go through the motions of removing her current attire in the middle of a public restroom. She&#39;d prefer to just wait until they&#39;re home.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine, Rita. I can hold it until we&#39;re at your house.&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you sure? Your accident earlier-&quot;<br />
&quot;Please, Rita.&quot; Leah pleaded pitifully. It was pathetic, but it worked; Rita didn&#39;t question further. She spent the next couple minutes sitting there, trying to get back to sleep, but the building bowel movement was too much of a distraction. She ended up releasing several more farts, no doubt raising Rita&#39;s concern. Leah was starting to feel tempted to just push the load out herself to get it over with; she&#39;s done it once already that day, the only difference being that now she&#39;s actually wearing something meant to take it. But Leah knew that was just her sleepy brain, since she tends to get rather grumpy when tired. They were only a few minutes away, however, when the cramps started to get unbearable. To her dismay, she realized there&#39;s a high chance she won&#39;t make it until she&#39;s home. If she wanted to avoid another accident, Leah knew they&#39;d have to make a stop, and she might as well prevent further soiling herself.<br />
&quot;Ugh, Leah, can we stop by that gas station? I&#39;m...uh, I wanna snack.&quot; She asked, not really wanting to say &#39;go to the bathroom&#39;, but sure Rita would pick-up on it.<br />
&quot;Really? We&#39;re only a few minutes away-&quot;<br />
&quot;Please, Rita.&quot; She asked as another cramp tore through her, forcing a sputtering fart out of her. She wasn&#39;t even embarrassed, just annoyed.<br />
&quot;Very well, if that&#39;s what you want.&quot; Rita said as she turned into a small, local gas station.<br />
&quot;Here, buy yourself something while I fill up the tank.&quot; She handed Leah a $20 bill, which Leah gingerly took. Did...she actually think she came here JUST to get a snack? Leah huffed, not really caring. Honestly, the whole situation was more trouble than it&#39;s worth. She toddled her way towards the gas station, sucking her pacifier in contempt. There wasn&#39;t a lot of people, which she was grateful for, but the bright lights outside the building was agitating to an abhorrent degree. It&#39;s when she felt a particularly violent cramp that Leah got fed up. She didn&#39;t even fight it, just let her body do what it needed as she matched forward. She felt mush fill her diaper, glad that at least the onesie covered her rear; she doesn&#39;t think it will actually hide her accident, but at least it wasn&#39;t visible. It was only a small gush anyways, mostly just helping alleviate the pressure. She entered the building proper, making a move for the restrooms. Not necessarily a run, just a walk. She wasn&#39;t really in a hurry anymore. Afterall, she&#39;s going to have to remove the onesie dress, then her dirty diaper, sit on the cold toilet, grunt for the next few minutes to empty herself, put back on her dirty diaper, then put back on her-<br />
Leah let out a grave sigh. All that, or she could just mess herself. There was practically no deliberation on Leah&#39;s part as she released her bowels and went over to the snack section. Rita did give her $20, so she could get a couple things. By the time she finished voiding her bowels, she had a armful of snacks and candies she summed up she could buy. As she walked towards the register, a voice in the back of her head that was getting louder over time became impossible to ignore: she just purposely pooped herself in public, and was about to interact with a stranger. What was she doing? She didn&#39;t care for that voice&#39;s tone, however, and smashed it to the back of her head mercilessly. The register would just see a toddler, it&#39;s fine. She came to the counter to see a dead-eyed man looking like he wanted to be anywhere but here. She unloaded her stash onto the counter, then held up the $20. The man look her over, seeing a toddler princess agressively sucking her pacifier while smelling of dirty diapers, wondering if this was a joke.<br />
&quot;Where&#39;s your parents?&quot; The man asked in a tone that lacked any concern. Leah narrowed her eyes.<br />
&quot;I don know, whewre&#39;s yo meaning in wife? You paid enough to cawe?&quot; She spat, pacifier mumbling her words. If the man looked surprised, he did not show it. Eventually he let out a long, empty sigh before beginning to scan her items. <br />
&quot;You want a bag?&quot; He asked as he took her bill.<br />
&quot;No, I wanna cawwy it. Yes, I wanna bag.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey, it costs nothing to be nice kid.&quot;<br />
&quot;Nice!? I was woken from my nap, and I just poopied my diapie. This is me being nice!&quot;<br />
The man gave another long, harrowing sigh as he handed her the bag. &quot;Whatever.&quot;<br />
Leah gave a little huff and walked through the exit, hearing the man say &quot;Kids just keep getting meaning each year&quot; as she leaves. When she meets back up with Rita, if takes her only 3 seconds to know she&#39;s messy.<br />
&quot;Oh, Leah-&quot; She begins sympathetically, but Leah waves dismissively.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine. Couldn&#39;t make it. I&#39;ll change myself when we get back.&quot;<br />
&quot;O-Oh.&quot; Rita looked a little surprised, stunned enough for Leah to open the car door and sit, &quot;Wait, what about your diap-&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll get changed when we get back! Come on, we&#39;re almost home.&quot;<br />
Rita looked like she wanted to object, but probably sensed Leah&#39;s mood was already soured enough. &quot;Alright.&quot; And with that, they were off. The drive was luckily short, given that Rita clearly could not stand Leah&#39;s poopy smell. On the way, Leah grumpily snack on her stash, trying to get comfortable. To her surprise, it was rather easy; her dirty diaper was strangely alluring. She briefly thought on a peculiarity that made itself known: she had a mental breakdown when she pooped on accident at the giftshop, yet felt completely fine (might she even say...kind of powerful?) when she purposely pooped in that gas station. That was weird, right? Except it wasn&#39;t weird to Leah. In fact, it was extremely obvious: In the giftshop, she was a teen having an accident. In the gas station, she was a grumpy toddler being a grumpy toddler. One was traumatic, the other was expected. <br />
Leah jumped out the moment she could the moment they got home, not a moment too soon as Rita took a deep breath of fresh air. Leah didn&#39;t get it herself, it&#39;s just poop afterall, but she didn&#39;t want her aunt to suffer given all she&#39;s done to help her today. <br />
&quot;I&#39;mma change, shower, then sleep, okay?&quot; Leah called back. Rita gave her a nod, and the two said good night. Finally, Leah was alone with her own thoughts. She briefly grabs the back of her diaper, only now appreciating how much of a bulge there is. She...</p>
