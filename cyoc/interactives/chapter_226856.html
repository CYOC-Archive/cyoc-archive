<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well son, why don&#39;t we have a bit of fun? You can build any adult body you want, and I&#39;ll build a younger body and we will go out tomorrow and you can be the dad, and I&#39;ll be the son!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate&#39;s eyes widened with excitement. &quot;Really dad? You&#39;ll let me be the dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
Daryll smiled, happy that his son found as much joy out of his hobby as he did. &quot;Absolutely son! Tonight you can pick your body, but leave your head on so you can get used to the difference in body size, as well as let your consciousness connect with the new body, and we&#39;ll pick you an adult head in the morning before we leave!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate couldn&#39;t believe what he was hearing. He would get to be the father and see what it felt like to be a real man! He knew that he would have to make a hard decision on what to choose. Thankfully since he wouldn&#39;t have to worry about what head to choose tonight, he could focus solely on the body.<br />
<br />
His dad had all the body parts organized by type, so he decided to start with the torso. It was unbelievable how many different styles his dad had. He had child torsos, old man torsos, and everything in between. Nate was in between two of them. A lean hairless torso that had a swimmers build with a light six pack, and a massive bodybuilder&#39;s torso with a well defined 8 pack and a hairy chest. Nate decided that if he was going to look like a real man, he was going to go all the way. He showed his dad that he wanted the bodybuilder torso, and his dad grabbed it and placed it on the bed in the middle of the room. <br />
<br />
Nate then decided to pick out the arms for his body. Once again there were lots to choose from, but he saw some huge arms with defined muscles on every inch of their structure. The biceps alone were larger than his own head. The right arm also had a super cool tattoo sleeve that looked really amazing. His dad started to come over to grab them for him, but Nate stopped him. &quot;Wait Dad! I bet I can grab them myself!&quot; Daryll smiled &quot;Alright son go ahead!&quot; Nate reached up and with a lot of effort was finally able to bring the pair of arms down.<br />
<br />
He walked over to the bed and realized that the lighter tan of the arms didn&#39;t match the deeper golden tan of the torso that he picked out. Almost as if his dad knew what he was thinking, Daryll chimed in &quot;If you&#39;re worried about the skin tone not matching, it will even out when you attach them together!&quot; Nate then grinned big, excited that he didn&#39;t have to change any of his choices, and placed the bowling ball shoulder next to the massive pec, and it sealed without any problem, and then the arm&#39;s tan deepened to match the torso. Nate went to the other side and put the other arm on which then deepened it&#39;s tan as well to match the torso. <br />
<br />
Next was to pick out the hands he would have. He thought it would be interesting and sort of comical to go with the hands that started them all, so he grabbed the massive mitts that he first found when he walked in, and admired them again. They were easily twice the size of his own hands, and they were about to be his own. He took them over and attached them to the wrists of the arms he picked out. <br />
<br />
It was now time for him to pick out his legs. He wanted to be tall, and so he found the longest pair in his dad&#39;s collection. The thighs could crush a watermelon, ridges up and down every muscle group, huge calves, all covered in a nice coat of fur. These were the legs for Nate. These were unfortunately a bit too heavy for him to pick up on his own, so Daryll had to help with this portion. He grabbed both legs and slid them into place on the body. It was almost complete, all that was left was to pick out the feet.<br />
<br />
Nate went to the feet, and noticed that these were actually organized by size. He thought that since he was going big on everything else, he might as well go big with the feet. He looked at the size 15 feet, and thought it would be perfect for his body. He grabbed them, and nearly ran back to the bed because he was so excited, and he put them at the end of the massive legs he picked out, and stepped back to view his creation.<br />
<br />
It was amazing. Massive pillows of muscle on the chest, perfectly cut 8 pack abs, bowling ball shoulders, massive biceps and triceps, well defined forearms, thighs that were wider than his current waist, it was amazing. He couldn&#39;t wait to pilot that body for himself. He looked at his dad with the biggest grin on his face. Daryll smiled. &quot;Are you ready for this Nate? I&#39;m gonna put you on there myself so you don&#39;t get too disoriented.&quot; Nate was almost jumping up and down with excitement. &quot;But you need to sit down so that your body doesn&#39;t fall and get hurt&quot; Daryll said with a chcuckle. After Nate did what he was told, Daryll grabbed on either side of Nate&#39;s head and lifted off. Nate&#39;s body was still sitting up at this point, but the second his neck made contact with his new body, his small 10 year old frame collapsed on the floor. <br />
<br />
Immediately Nate felt so much heavier. He lifted his head and looked down his torso, but his view was blocked by the massive slabs of meat on his chest. He sat up, and lifted his arms to his head and flexed hard. He did not even realize that muscles could be this big! He jumped out of the bed and stood next to his dad, and realized that he was taller than him now. At least half a foot taller! He felt so incredible and powerful with his new body. &quot;Dad this is amazing! Thank you so much for doing this for me!&quot; He then brought his dad into a hug, but not used to his own strength, he pushed the wind right out of his dad&#39;s lungs. He let go right after realizing that he was not used to his strength. He rubbed the back of his head with his massive hand &quot;Sorry dad, I guess you were right! I do need to get used to this strength I have!&quot; Daryll, after catching his breath, laughed. &quot;I told you son! Now let me pick out my body for tomorrow, and you go grab some clothes for tonight for your new body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate complied and lumbered his huge physique over to the clothing chests. He grabbed some boxer briefs that on his old body would have been able to be used as a shirt because of how large they were, but it fit his new body perfectly. Since they were staying in tonight, he just got himself some workout shorts and a tank top that hugged his frame like a glove. <br />
<br />
By the time he finished getting dressed, he looked back and noticed that his dad was over by the bed, and his old body was on it. When Nate looked at his dad&#39;s choice of body however, he realized something. &quot;Dad, is that my body?&quot; He would know that body anywhere, it was his own for the past 10 years of his life. &quot;Yes it is son! Is that alright with you? I won&#39;t use it if you don&#39;t want me to.&quot; Nate replied, &quot;No it&#39;s alright dad, but why do you want to use my body?&quot; Daryll let out a signature chuckle. &quot;Well son, your body was one that I&#39;ve never gotten to try on before today. I&#39;ve worn every piece in this room at least once, so I thought to really sell the &#39;Father Son Reversal&#39; take we&#39;re going for, why not do this?&quot; Nate started grinning &quot;That&#39;s such a funny idea dad! I love that! But I&#39;ll be honest with you, I&#39;m getting kinda hungry, can we get something to eat?&quot; Daryll smiled. &quot;Sure son! Let&#39;s get out of here and get some grub!&quot; <br />
<br />
So Nate and Daryll left the room, getting sprayed again on the way out, and just to test, Nate tried to take his hand off, and it was stuck on tight as if it has always been his hand. When they went into the kitchen, Daryll started to cook for them, but he needed some help grabbing some of the items from the top shelf. &quot;Hey Nate, could you come and help me grab stuff for dinner?&quot; Nate bounded over and grabbed the ingredients for his dad since with his dad now in his small figure, Nate was now over 2 feet taller than his dad. <br />
<br />
When dinner was made, Daryll let Nate sit at the head of the table where he usually sits, so that Nate can get used to being the dad for tomorrow. Daryll made Nate a much bigger portion of everything he cooked than he normally does for him, since his bigger body needs more nutrients than his old body did. <br />
<br />
After dinner was done and they did the dishes, Daryll had them both go to bed. Nate started to walk to his own room, when Daryll stopped him. &quot;Nate, aren&#39;t you forgetting something? You&#39;re much bigger now! You wont be able to fit in your bed, go ahead and sleep in my bed tonight.&quot; Nate with all the excitement a 10 year old would have ran into his parents room and jumped onto the king size bed that was all to himself since his mom was out of town. Daryll smiled and told Nate goodnight, and closed the door to the bedroom. Nate was so excited about tomorrow that it took him a while to go to sleep. But he was ready for the next morning where he would really get to take his new body for a test drive...</p>
