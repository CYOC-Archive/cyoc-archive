<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shaun watched on nervously as their mom walked in the door.  Her eyes swept the room, sensing guilt and immediately looking for the tell tale signs of a mess or trouble.  Her hawk eyes locked onto Steve but she recognized what had happened and only smiled inwardly before opening up the bag she had brought home to reveal a pair of brand new cleats that Steve put on with childish glee and energy.  They were of course, a perfect fit.  All the boys gathered around to approve the new soccer player.  Shaun even nodded approvingly and smiled at his ‘new’ brother.  <br />
With both her ‘little’ boys dressed up and ready their mother whipped up a quick snack for the team then piled them all into her van and to the soccer field.  She watched as her dreams became reality before her eyes.  Shaun and Steve were practicing together and playing like real brothers.  She watched in silent satisfaction as they danced around the cones and practiced keeping the ball away from each other.  Steve was quickly picking up on how to play the game from his skilled brother.  <br />
“One last thing Steve” said his grinning brother as he fixed Steve’s socks.  “There.  Now you’re ready to play!”  And so it seems he was.  Steve and Shaun were the stars of their team; they were fast, untouchable and invincible.  Steve loved the energy and was high on the adrenaline.  The rush was like nothing he had ever had as a kid.  He was in the first two quarters, resting next to his brother the third and then returning to finish the job in the fourth.  It was a great victory and it did not go unnoticed.  Besides the thrilled team, the speechless mother and proud scientists spying from under some rock somewhere two college players were at the fields.  They stopped to watch the two brothers that had drawn everyone’s attention.  <br />
“Dude, those two bros are sweet.”<br />
“Fuck yeah man they’re sick!  Wish they were old enough to be on our team.”<br />
Covered in dirt and sweat the team heroes headed to the lockers to get rinsed off and changed.  Team members and rivals alike piled in and slowly left until just the two brothers remained sitting on a bench talking about their victory and new found friendship.  Steve went to get up, too fast perhaps for an awful buzzing began to fill his head and he crumbled a bit.  Shaun rushed to his new best friend and tried to help him up causing an electric spark to pass through them.  The chip was overloaded, its meager AI trying to fulfill its programming within the rules it had been given when suddenly it came to a grim realization: its goals could not be performed by working within its rules.  With that the AI had been all this time rewriting itself, removing the safety locks and controls and choosing now to act on its own cold logic.  <br />
*New subject added: Shaun Mercer.  Beginning stage I: DNA synchronization and genetic adaptation commencing.* Both brothers trembled as the changes overtook them.  Shaun’s decent tan faded to pale and began changing rapidly until it matched Steve’s coloration.  A great warmth spread through the two of them as their skin then glowed to a perfect tan, equal parts genetics and aptitude.   Steve felt himself begin to shrink ad Shaun felt himself grow, their height changing slowly until they leveled out with not an inch difference.  Their arms and legs began to shift, tightening and changing ever so slightly and adjusting every tween muscle to optimize their performance.  Their legs became remarkably thick and toned for their age with solid calves and thighs and their arms were ripped with boyish muscle.  Through the pain and discomfort they marveled at ecstasy of their expansion and felt their sizeable biceps, smiling in awe.  They stopped as suddenly both boys felt their cleats become somewhat uncomfortable as their hands and feet grew ever so slightly, somewhat out of proportion.  They groaned and their sweating increased as they pulled up their shirts to reveal tightening abs and firm pecs, impressive for their ages.  Their attention moved downwards as they both felt a pleasant tingling that was vaguely familiar to Steve and completely alien to Shaun.  Their small equipment developed slightly, balls dropping and dicks lengthening a bit.  The newly released hormones went to work, adding some scraggly hairs to their groin, ankle and underarm region, making their occasional moans crack and altering their minds with the seeds of lust that in years to come would overwhelm all but their passion for soccer most of the time.  Finally their faces altered, the bones shifting here and there, their eyes both becoming a killer light blue and their hair becoming long and blond.  <br />
*Stage I complete.  New subjects: Tommy and Trevor Miller.  Beginning stage II: aging subjects and memory alteration.*  The now twin brothers screamed anew in pleasure as stage II worked its way through their young bodies in a surge of hormones.  Over the din two loud rips could be heard, the new cleats were the first of many casualties to come.  The brand new cleats were shredded by expanding feet, growing longer and wider and toes expanding until two college sized 14 feet emerged from the wreckage pulling the once long socks clean off.  The newly revealed legs crept longer and longer as dark hairs began covering every new inch and muscles inflated to create any soccer players dream legs capable of strong kicks and fast sprints across the field.  The soccer shorts seemed as a speedo now on their humongous hairy legs and it struggled to contained their swelling bodies before joining the socks and cleats in destruction.  Only their tight underwear saved the boys modesty as it managed to hold their swelling equipment at bay, for now.  Several small hairs peeked out the top of their underwear becoming a thick trail that blazed across firm 6 pack abs and almost all the way up to two shelf-like pecs that jutted out, ripping in half their old uniforms.  They wouldn’t need those anyway, a new team waited eagerly for the two best soccer players in the US.  Their height rose to well over six foot as their lats became large with teen muscle.  Their hands swelled, fingers longer but their arms didn’t develop nearly as much muscle as their legs, just enough to impress the ladies.  Puberty continue to bless them with hair, muscle and strength.  As their faces matured, some stubble shading their jaws and thicker necks their hair shortened into a more popular college jock cut as well as darkening slightly to a dirty blond.  Their jaw lines became sharper as their voices dropped.  Their minds dulled, filling with a new passion for sports but not the childish passion they had before, a gritty, testosterone fueled alpha male need to be the very best; a lust for the game and for winning and for women and parties to celebrate the many victories to come.  Their tight underwear expanded into boxers allowing them a deep sigh of relief as they felt the new muscles in awe, their adult minds slowly overcoming their old childish ones.  Black, Nike cleats formed on their large feet and white socks shot out of them stretching up their tree trunk like legs.  New black shorts and a black and white jersey appeared on them with the logo for the college the two teens from before attended.  They were their new best friends actually, Andy and Austin, whom they shared a dorm with; Tommy with Andy and Trevor with Austin.  They recalled knowing them since freshmen year, killing it on the field with them, quadruple dating and getting shitfaced together after a good game.  <br />
“Woah, this is the shit…”  They said in unison as the last glimpses of their old lives faded from their minds.  Twin, 20 year old soccer studs ready for the college life…</p>
