<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kel sat on his bed with the book open before him.  He was wondering who he should try conjoining with.  There were any number of his friends he could try the spell with, but he wasn't to sure if any of them would want to.  He was still sitting there thinking, when his older brother Jake walked in to drop off his backpack from school.<br />
<br />
Kel's eyes lite up at the sight of his brother.  He had always admired Jake, and wanted to be just like him.  Jake was fairly athletic, with a well toned body, and was popular with the girls.  He was also really nice to Kel.  Jake always looked out for him, and would invite his little brother along whenever he would go hang out with his friends.  And so, Kel made up his mind about who he wanted to be stuck to.  The only hard part now, would be asking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jake.&quot; Kel greeted with a big smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey.&quot; Jake put down his back pack and gave a little wave, &quot;How's it going?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome!&quot; Kel said, trying not to sound to excited.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's good to hear.  We should do something later seeing how we're the only ones home tonight...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well actually, that's what I was just about to ask about.&quot;  Kel stared down at the book and bit his lower lip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya.&quot;  Kel slid off the end of his bed and stood up.  He was two years younger than Jake, but they stood at about the same height.  Kel kept his eyes glued to the floor, and shuffled his feet around nervously, &quot;See... I found this book and it's magic and I tried it and it really works and I was wonder who to try it with and you came in and I thought maybe you and I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, slow down a bit and take a breath!&quot;  Jake smiled and placed a hand on Kel's shoulder.  &quot;You found a book of magic?&quot;  And it really works?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya!&quot; Kel smiled and glanced up to Jake's face.  He felt his stomach knot, and throat tighten, so he instantly looked back at the floor. &quot;Ya, it really works.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok.  So what did you use it for?&quot;  Jake gave Kel a skeptical look.  He didn't believe his little brother, but he thought he'd play along and see what happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I kinda... gave myself a second head...&quot;  There was a moment of silence between them, and when Kel glanced up again, he could see Jake looking at him as if he were crazy.  Kel cleared his throat, and ignored the feeling in his stomach,  &quot;It was suppose to be a conjoining spell, I didn't have anyone to use it with so it just doubled my head.  Which wasn't what I wanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was another moment of silence, before Jake started to chuckle, &quot;That's pretty funny Kel.  Some of the stuff you come up with really weird.  Which is cool, I really like that you have an active imagination, but that one takes the cake!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not lying!&quot; Kel huffed, &quot;It really happened!  I just undid it, and was wondering who I could try it out with, and then you came in!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh really?&quot;  Jake still had a grin on his face that seemed to mock Kel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; Kel shouted, sounding a bit frustrated.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you thought maybe we could try together?&quot; Jake asked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; Kel blurted out.  He felt his face go red, so he pulled away from his brother and stared at his feet again.  His heart was racing, and his palms were sweaty.  Kel couldn't believe he just blurted it out like that, but he also couldn't believe his brother's response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok then, do it.&quot;  Jake had walked over and but his arm around Kel's shoulders.  Kel looked his brother in shock, but all Jake did was nudge him towards the book.  Kel nodded and picked stood at the edge of his bed so he could read the spell again.<br />
<br />
Kel took a step back and stood with his brother.  They both looked at each other, not sure what would happen next.  Suddenly there was a strange glowing rune under their feet encased in a circle.  Jake looked at Kel with widened eyes, &quot;Dude...&quot;<br />
<br />
They felt themselves get pulled together until their sides were touching.  Kel and ended up on the left, with Jake on the right, and still they were being pulled together.  They watched as they seemed to slide into each other with a slurping, bubbly sound.  Both of them were breathing heavily, and they could feel their hearts racing.<br />
<br />
Just as quickly as it had started, the process stopped.  The two brother had be fused into a two headed version of themselves.  Kel stared down at the clothing they were wearing, which had also fused down the middle.  Kel half had on his t-shirt with light blue jeans, but Jake's half had his long sleeve shirt, and dark blue jeans.  Kel couldn't help but smile at their new found bond, but Jake just stared at his brother in shock and wonder.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? How?&quot; Jake was trying to ask as he gently tried to pull away from his brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you!&quot; Kel's grin was ear to ear, &quot;That book, it's real magic!  Isn't this cool!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake examined their body quickly and found himself smiling at how happy Kel was with their new closeness,  &quot;Hehe, ya man.  I guess this is pretty cool.&quot;  Jake raised his hand, and the two of them did a little fist bump.  &quot;So, now what do we do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know...&quot;  Kel responded.  &quot;Did you have any plans for us for tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Order a pizza or something and watch a movie.&quot;  Jake gently pushed on Kel and tried to move the other way.  &quot;We're really stuck huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup!  Stuck together... forever.&quot; Kel said trying to sound creepy and mysterious.  &quot;Just joking!  I just have to say the spell again and we'll come apart.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, ok, cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, a pizza and movie?&quot; Kel asked, &quot;Sounds like a good plan to me body bro!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, body bro, that's good.&quot;  Jake started to laugh, &quot;Ok then body bro, let's go!&quot;</p>
