<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With their sexual hunger sated, for now, the werepanther and his hybrid were girlfriend changed back into their human forms as Eric Anderson and Spencer Lawson got dressed to head to their respective homes.<br />
&quot;You know, we do have to be more careful,&quot; realized Eric, as he stared at Spencer&#39;s naked body. &quot;Despite the fact it was almost dark when we started because it&#39;s late November, despite how much I wanted you, <i>needed</i> you, we can&#39;t be caught actively furry in public.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know, but you don&#39;t hear me complaining about being filled,&quot; said Spencer, briefly dipping a finger into her vagina before bringing it up to her lips. &quot;You really do taste great,&quot; she said with a smile, before pulling up and securing her blue jeans.<br />
&quot;Thanks. You do too,&quot; replied Eric, joyfully recalling her taste on his muzzle. &quot;But—&quot;<br />
And that thought went unfinished as both of their cellphones chimed receiving an incoming message.<br />
Upon looking at their devices, all Eric and Spencer could do was stare at their respective screens until they showed each other the text message they received.<br />
DAD AWARE OF U! GROUNDED UNTIL HE GETS TRUTH! B CAREFUL!—F.<br />
&quot;DAMN!&quot; exclaimed Eric, putting the phone away. &quot;Just when I&#39;m finally feeling good about myself...&quot;<br />
Spencer didn&#39;t know what to say to her boyfriend, for she had never heard Eric curse before. &quot;Poor Frieda. We&#39;d better give our folks the head&#39;s up that her father might make trouble for all of us.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, but what can we do about it?&quot; asked a now fully dressed Eric, as he handed Spencer her book bag.<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s talk about it on the way home,&quot; suggested Spencer.<br />
<br />
While at any other time they would have enjoyed the romantic walk home together, Spencer and Eric came up empty on the idea front. When they got to the Lawson house, only her mom was home.<br />
&quot;So this Frieda Knight is your friend, and being bi, she&#39;s the one who technically inducted a willing Eric into were society before the two of you spent yesterday afternoon together, but even if her folks knew the whole story, they would still think you two are beneath her?&quot; asked Mrs. Lawson, summing up what the kids told her, except for the fact that Frieda actually <i>scratched</i> Eric before the more traditional sexual method to keep Julie Stovall from making sure he would become a were-merman instead of whatever Eric wanted.<br />
&quot;Despite all the good they do for Moon Lake, Frieda&#39;s parents are basically a couple of rich snobs. In their opinion it&#39;s bad enough that Frieda is more down to earth than they are, so heaven only knows how they&#39;ll react if they find out their daughter&#39;s bi too,&quot; pointed out Spencer.<br />
&quot;There&#39;s nothing wrong with being bi,&quot; said her mom proudly, since she was too, &quot;but the best we can do at the moment is wait till your father gets home, talk it over between us, and then call the Andersons to have a group discussion.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay. I&#39;ll tell my folks when I get home,&quot; promised Eric, before kissing his girlfriend (on the cheek since they were in front of her mother) and leaving for his house.<br />
&quot;You really like him, don&#39;t you?&quot; she asked, as they watched Eric leave.<br />
&quot;Like isn&#39;t the right word mom,&quot; was Spencer&#39;s reply.<br />
<br />
Eric walked at a much faster pace back to his house than the trip to the Lawsons.<br />
When he let himself in, he wasn&#39;t quite surprised to see both his parents, along with Samantha and Frances Twist from next door waiting for him.<br />
&quot;When it rains, it pours,&quot; said Eric, dropping his book bag and standing before the adults.<br />
&quot;Frances needs to talk to you about Julie, and I&#39;m just here in an official capacity as Town Chancellor to let you know that her preliminary hearing is scheduled for next Wednesday morning,&quot; explained Samantha.<br />
&quot;Is there something else we should know about son?&quot; asked his concerned mother.<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Eric, before telling the group about Benton Knight.<br />
&quot;SHEESH!&quot; said Samantha, when Eric finished. &quot;Considering their ancestral background, the Tachibanas are always more formal in their dealings with the public, but are definitely a lot more outgoing and friendly when compared to Benton and Amanda Knight.&quot;<br />
&quot;So what do we do?&quot; asked Eric, especially since he told Samantha about being a willing recipient of the scratch.<br />
&quot;The Knights might not like the media coverage if it gets that far, but all things considered, Frieda wouldn&#39;t face any possible Statute 1-A violation charges*,&quot; revealed Samantha.<br />
&quot;GOOD! Frieda is definitely the nicest of the three,&quot; said Doctor Frances Twist, recalling her one brief meeting with them while attending a social gathering with her wife. &quot;But that poor girl. Unfortunately it&#39;s not outright abuse in any form as far as the law is concerned, but I had no idea,&quot; said the licensed therapist. &quot;They remained calm about it in public, but I could see Frieda&#39;s parents weren&#39;t happy to discover that I&#39;m Samantha&#39;s wife,&quot; she added, while wrapping an arm around her mate. &quot;I have no idea how they&#39;ll react if they find out Frieda&#39;s bi. Yet since she is still technically a minor in their care, there might not be much we can do about it legally.&quot;<br />
&quot;How much trouble can these people make for us?&quot; asked William Anderson.<br />
&quot;If he&#39;s mad enough and vindictive enough, plenty,&quot; said Samantha. &quot;After meeting us, Benton Knight quietly tried to have me fired and Frances&#39; therapist licensed revoked. Luckily we have enough friends between us to have weathered that storm, which was before you guys moved here, so he hasn&#39;t thought of us since because we avoid him as much as we can. But Benton Knight is a member of the board at both the college and the school district, so...&quot;<br />
&quot;I get the idea,&quot; said William, as both he and Martha began to issue a low, menacing werefox growl, since he was a college professor and she an elementary school teacher.<br />
<br />
&quot;As much as I hate to say this, we&#39;ll have to wait for him to make the next move, whatever it is,&quot; said Samantha, &quot;but I&#39;d like to sit in on that group meeting with the Lawsons if you don&#39;t mind.&quot;<br />
&quot;The more the merrier. After all, there&#39;s strength in numbers,&quot; said Martha, as she smiled at her friends. &quot;If this jerk starts digging into our past and is as morally righteous as you claim, I&#39;m not too crazy about him finding out William and I have an open marriage, let alone the fact I&#39;m bi.&quot;<br />
Wanting to change the subject, Eric asked Frances, &quot;You said you wanted to talk to me about Julie?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes. I have started individual, family, and marriage counseling with the Stovalls,&quot; began Frances. &quot;While patient confidentially prevents me from repeating anything said between them and me, I did want to hear your side of the story regarding your relationship with Julie, so I can compare the two versions privately.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure. My folks know most of this anyway, so I don&#39;t mind telling you,&quot; said Eric, before he sat down and recounted everything, from how they first met during Freshman lunch, Julie asking him to walk her own, the fact that they seemed to be growing close to the point where she kept wanting him to take the plunge (no pun intended) and become a were-merman to totally be with her.<br />
&quot;Like I told Frieda and Spencer, it&#39;s not that I had anything against the basic concept of becoming a were, just that I wasn&#39;t sure at the time what kind of were I wanted to be, let alone the fact that I didn&#39;t want to lose my virginity just to join were society.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see. So Julie was aware that you were both a normal and a virgin?&quot; asked Frances.<br />
&quot;I guess. Although I never said so outright, around here the two do tend to go hand in hand,&quot; pointed out Eric.<br />
&quot;Yes. They do,&quot; agreed Frances, &quot;but at that point, had you already decided what kind of were you wanted to be?&quot;<br />
&quot;Honestly? No. While the idea seemed interesting at first, the more Julie kept pushing me to become a were-mer, the less attractive it started becoming,&quot; replied Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;When did Julie first suggest the idea of you becoming a were-merman?&quot; asked Frances.<br />
&quot;Actually, that very first time I walked her home.&quot;<br />
&quot;Now, this is very important. I need a totally honest answer to this question. Did you ever tell Julie Stovall you loved her?&quot; wondered Frances.<br />
&quot;Outright love? No. About two weeks after I started walking Julie home every day, when she asked I did admit that I liked her, and in time those feelings might grow stronger and actually become love. If they did, then I might have given more thought to becoming a were-mer, but the longer we were together without actually doing more than holding hands and kissing, the more pushy Julie got. You don&#39;t know this,&quot; Eric said, briefly looking at his parents, &quot;but just before Julie claimed she loved me before I caught her with that were-otter in her swimming pool, Julie gave me a blow job in my room.&quot;<br />
His folks started to blush as Eric said, &quot;But when I wouldn&#39;t return the favor, that&#39;s when she stormed out of the house. I followed her, hoping to at least clear the air with Julie, but that&#39;s when the first time I caught her with Brian Walker happened. You guys know all the rest about me catching her with him a second time with led to me breaking up with Julie and the entire mess since.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; said Frances thoughtfully. She would make notes about the entire conversation later, but knew Eric was telling the truth while Julie lied to her about some points concerning their past relationship. &quot;Now, one last question, and please answer honestly. When did you meet, let alone start falling in love with Spencer Lawson?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She transferred to Moon Lake High late, so my first meeting her didn&#39;t happen until after the first incident between Julie and Brian. Your guess is as good as ours in regards to when it actually happened, but neither of us realized we were falling in love with each other until sometime during all that mess with Jeremy Bower and his father,&quot; said Eric, recalling how he rashly grabbed Ben Twist&#39;s aluminum baseball bat and went running off into the woods in hopes of protecting Spencer despite still being a plain normal human being at the time.<br />
