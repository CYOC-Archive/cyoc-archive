<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Both Steve and Janet began to argue more and more as they slowly defended into their fight. Alan and Megan just looked at each other before both of them nodded in silent understanding. Megan quickly grabbed the book off the table and ran towards the staircase with Alan running right behind her.<br />
<br />
Steve and Janet barely had time to yell as the two kids made their way up the stairs and quickly barricaded themselves in Alan&#39;s room.<br />
&quot;Man I thought you were fast.&quot; Megan teased Alan. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am fast. It&#39;s just that I&#39;m not used to running with... these!&quot; Alan growled jiggling one of his new breasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I have this gross noodle in my pants now!&quot; Megan retorted. &quot;So don&#39;t you go complaining about new body parts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Alan could snap back they heard a loud banging on the door. They both jumped up from their spot on the floor and backed away onto the bed. <br />
&quot;Kids?! What do you think you&#39;re doing?!&quot; Steve&#39;s shrill voice rang. &quot;Get out here this instant! That thing is dangerous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to mention we need it to change back. You have to be careful.&quot; Janet added.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are being careful!&quot; Megan yelled back. &quot;But you two are acting crazy. We wouldn&#39;t even be like this if either of you didn&#39;t;t mess with this book.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alan nodded his head, trying not to cry as his new body slowly betrayed him. &quot;That&#39;s right. W-we&#39;ll give it back as soon as you two stop fighting and come to a rational, nice agreement.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you crying?&quot; Megan chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up I got girl hormones or whatever.&quot; He said wiping away the tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kids, we&#39;ll bust down the door if we have to!&quot; Janet yelled, being fueled by the testosterone and her new muscles. &quot;So just come on out and nothing gets broken.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You see!&quot; Megan yelled. &quot;That&#39;s what we&#39;re talking about! Neither of you are acting like yourselves. Mom you never think violence is the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Mo- I mean, Dad. Dad sorry. Dad you never freak out like this. You&#39;re always calm and it helps us stay calm. So please just calm down for a while. We won&#39;t use the book but you can&#39;t use it right now okay?&quot; Alan asked.<br />
<br />
Janet and Steve stood quietly behind the door, before turning towards each other. Steve brushed his long hair out of his slightly puffy eyes and Janet stopped tensing his arms. They didn&#39;t want to admit it, but their kids were right. They were losing themselves in the panic and the changes. They needed to take a moment to breath and think.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay kids.&quot; Steve agreed. &quot;We&#39;ll be in our room. We&#39;ll talk to each other and come up with a new plan. Just don&#39;t touch that thing alright?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
Alan and Megan smiled at one another as Megan slid the book under Alan&#39;s bed.<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; They both said happily.<br />
<br />
Steve and Janet walked into the master bedroom, and quietly shut the door. Steve slid down it with his hands to his face while Janet slowly sat on the bed with her arms crossed.  They both were silent for a minute before Janet laughed, and Steve looked up in confusion. <br />
&quot;Sorry, sorry. It&#39;s just, I normally can&#39;t fold my arms like this and look serious. There are usually some uh, features in the way.&quot; She chuckled.<br />
<br />
Steve looked down at his new large breasts, and tried to fold his arms before giving up in embarrassment. <br />
&quot;Janet, they&#39;re right. I mean, we&#39;re acting crazy. Maybe we are crazy,&quot; he explained tugging on his dress, &quot;but that&#39;s no reason to freak out on you like that. I&#39;m sorry I got us into this mess and yelled at you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry as well. I should have listened to you, and I shouldn&#39;t have yelled either.&quot; Janet apologized. They sat there for a moment smiling before Steve looked down. &quot;So... now what do we do?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We do your plan. As much as I don&#39;t want to remain with this monster down here,&quot; She said gesturing at a bulge in &quot;her&quot; pants which Steve found himself staring at, &quot;We can&#39;t just risk our lives and the kids lives on random chance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh honey!&quot; Steve squealed as he got up and hugged her. &quot;Thank you sweetie.&quot; <br />
<br />
The two locked gazes before giving each other a passionate kiss. Steve sat down next to her and Janet lowered her towering head onto Steve&#39;s tiny shoulders. &quot;Hey honey?&quot; Steve asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes darling?&quot; Janet asked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you gals deal with all these... emotions?&quot; Steve half jokingly asked. &quot;I can barely control them all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was going to ask you a similar question. How are you always so rational with this macho blood in your veins? I was about to punch my arm strait through Alan&#39;s door!&quot; Janet laughed as she flexed her massive arm. Steve found himself staring before he leaned in, holding his breasts out. Janet started to stare herself as they kissed once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what else I&#39;m feeling?&quot; Steve asked as he slowly grabbed Janet&#39;s growing cock. Janet retaliated by rubbing Steve&#39;s pussy as the two began to passionately kiss. &quot;Wait, what about the kids?&quot; Janet asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... they think we have things to talk about so.... let&#39;s talk.&quot; He growled as the two fell backwards onto the bed. Janet expertly took off Steve&#39;s bra as Steve yanked off her pants. Steve, running off &quot;Stephanie&#39;s&quot; instincts, immediately began to suck Janet&#39;s massive cock as Janet gripped Steve&#39;s hair as tight as she could. After a few minutes Janet lifted Steve high into the air while still on her knees and slowly drove his cock into Stephanie&#39;s most pussy. Stephanie began to quietly moan and Jake continued to thrust harder and harder into his wife&#39;s pussy. The two made love, while down the hall, their two children remained unaware.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Man it&#39;s getting late.&quot; Megan groaned. &quot;I guess I gotta sleep in your room tonight.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You can have the bed then.&quot; Alan offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t want to sleep in anything that pink.&quot; He sneered as Megan chuckled at the comment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope Mom and Dad are getting along alright.&quot; Megan hoped aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure they&#39;re working things out.&quot; Alan said as he dropped onto the floor with a spare pillow and blanket. &quot;We&#39;ll ask them in the morning.&quot; He yawned as he rolled to his side.<br />
<br />
Megan hoped into Alan&#39;s changed bed and quickly drifted off to sleep, dreaming off a slightly hopeful tomorrow. Megan awoke to a slight sunbeam shining on her eye. She sat straight up and stretched her back. She looked down and sighed, remembering the chaos of the last few days. She got up, walked past her sleeping feminine brother, and shuffled down the hall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, Dad?&quot; She whispered as she opened their door. She looked to the bed and her jaw dropped. She saw her mother, Janet, still in male form, snuggling up to a clearly naked female Dad. Janet opened her eyes slightly, and then upon seeing Megan, her eyes shot wide open. She jolted up, and despite having no boobs to cover, instinctively covered her nipples.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Good morning Megan!&quot; Janet greeted both panicked and embarrassed. <br />
<br />
Steve lifted his upper body up, with his breasts hanging out on display, and stretched his body. His eyes were still closed as he finished his stretch and quietly asked &quot;What about Megan honey?&quot; Before Megan slammed the door and sprinted down the hall. She ran into Alan&#39;s rooms and slammed the door even harder.<br />
<br />
Alan awoke with a jolt and quickly asked what happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw Dad&#39;s boobies!&quot; Was all she could muster as Alan sat confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit Steve.&quot; Janet huffed as she through Steve&#39;s bra at him. &quot;For god&#39;s sake you&#39;re a woman right now! Put on a damn shirt!&quot; She quietly yelled as she walked out in nothing but pajama pants. Steve realized what had happened as he hopped out of bed and began scrambling to put some clothes on.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes of apologies and not-so-complete explanations, the screwed up family made their way downstairs with the book in tow. They placed it on the kitchen counter and sat around it, all with worried looks.<br />
&quot;So, we&#39;ve decided to wait.&quot; Janet began. &quot;What you kids said last night really made us think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not all it made you do.&quot; Alan grumbled.<br />
<br />
Janet gave him the stink eye as Megan was still not fully sure what happened and Steve just shamefully stared away. Although he enjoyed it, his guy brain still felt embarrassed that his wife just fucked him with her dick. Janet cleared her throat and continued. &quot;Anyway, we&#39;ll all start research on it today. Due to our dramatic transformation tonight, I&#39;ll call you both in sick so you can have time to adjust, and time to help us look for information on whatever this thing is.&quot;<br />
<br />
The family all gave each other glances and nods.<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Steve continued. &quot;Janet and Alan will stay home and work on searching the internet for any clues as to what exactly this thing could be. While you do that, Megan and I will go to the library to see if we can find anything in the county archives about that house in the middle of know where.&quot; <br />
<br />
The family agreed. Janet helped Steve do some basic makeup and changes while Alan made sure Megan didn&#39;t wear anything too girly. The father and daughter turned mother and son drove off as Janet and Alan began their web search for magical anything.</p>
