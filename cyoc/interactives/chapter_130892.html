<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It didn&#39;t take long for new clothes to be found for Tuxing and Jinxing. Tigers and snow leopards were reasonably well-known around Animalia by that point and their particular measurements weren&#39;t that different from the average Animalian. Even so, the others were impressed when the two big cats came out. &quot;Wow, you look so pretty,&quot; said Huoxing, &quot;I mean, I wouldn&#39;t change my pick for anything, even if I could now. But your fur is so pretty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They are, aren&#39;t they?&quot; asked Jinxing, sounding rather pleased with herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunately, that&#39;s one of the reasons why tigers and snow leopards are endangered now,&quot; said Tuxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m an endangered species too,&quot; said Huoxing, &quot;But nobody&#39;s going to be coming for our fur here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If we are ready, we can start on the next conversion,&quot; said Ping.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that will be me,&quot; said Shuixing, standing up.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re sure you want to be a water buffalo instead of something else?&quot; asked Ping.<br />
<br />
Shuixing shrugged. &quot;I&#39;m not going to pretend I&#39;m graceful. Everyone else has said so for as long as I can remember. Everyone calls me as clumsy as an ox. So I might as well be as strong as one,&quot; she said. Shuixing had suffered a lot of mockery because of her homelier looks and heavier body. Dr. Stein intended to make sure that Shuixing had a few appointments with Dr. Jones after her conversion.<br />
<br />
After Dr. Stein, Ping, and Shuixing went into the changing room, Dr. Stein said, &quot;Now, getting a DNA sample for your conversion wasn&#39;t so simple. Water buffaloes aren&#39;t nearly as common in America as they are in China. However, there are some dairy farms in the States who are using them, namely to make high-quality mozzarella. So we were able to get this transported.&quot; With that, he opened the mini-fridge that was in the room. The fridge was usually used to contain foods that the newly converted would want to eat after their change. Dr. Stein pulled out a thermos and handed it to Shuixing.<br />
<br />
Shuixing opened the thermos to find it filled with milk. &quot;Did you already change a buffalo?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but we did get that container of milk and dosed it with the Animalian virus,&quot; said Dr. Stein.<br />
<br />
&quot;It should have the effect of the milk our Animalian cows produce, except making you into a buffalo, of course,&quot; said Ping.<br />
<br />
&quot;There should be enough milk to give you a double dose,&quot; said Dr. Stein, &quot;Just keep drinking it as you change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And welcome to Animalia,&quot; said Ping as she and Dr. Stein left the room.<br />
<br />
Shuixing sniffed the milk in the thermos. It seemed fresh enough and she was eager to get the transformation started. She lifted and started chugging down the milk. It was good and fresh, certainly different from what the dairy cows produced. When she paused to catch her breath, she could see the changes were starting. Her fingernails had turned black as they were swallowing up the tips of her fingers. Black hairs were starting to spread across her body. Shuixing felt a pounding sensation on her forehead. She reached up to massage it to find two large bumps on the side of her head. Presently, the skin parted as the beginnings of her horns started growing out. She could also feel her ears getting longer and could feel them moving on her own. Her feet were getting more uncomfortable so she leaned down to take off her shoes. Her feet were already halfway to being hooves by the time she got them off. She could feel her tail growing and pulled down her pants to give it more room.<br />
<br />
Shuixing became alarmed when she felt her changes starting to slow, but then she realized she was reaching the end of what her first dose would change. She grabbed the thermos, her hoof-like fingers not finding it hard to grab. She poured as much milk as she could down her growing muzzle. This time she was able to swallow a lot more before coming up for breath. Then Shuixing felt her body really growing again. But her body wasn&#39;t becoming much more animal, asides from her growing horns. Now she was gaining mass, quickly shooting up in height. The shape of her body was easy to see changing through her increasingly small clothes. Her once heavyset body was re-sculpting into one that exhibited more muscles and curves. Her protruding tummy had hardened into a solid six-pack, her oversized rear being molded into one that was much more appealing. Her breasts were ganging much more mass, changing from flabby cones to huge orbs that were filling up with an impressive milk reserve. Shuixing gave a few bovine grunts as she became too big for her clothes. That situation was soon fixed by her clothes splitting open, allowing her bovine beauty to be seen it its full glory. She gave a surprised bellow as her nipples suddenly gushed milk.<br />
<br />
As soon as she felt the changes stop, she looked at her new reflection. Instead of the dumpling of a Chinese girl she once was, she had become a water buffalo woman with very impressive muscles and curves. She thought she looked bigger than Tuxing, which made sense since water buffaloes were bigger than tigers and Shuixing certainly produced more milk than Tuxing now. In most respects, Shuixing was a lot like the other cow women in Animalia. But she was noticeably broader in the shoulders than them and her larger horns showed that she was a buffalo. After admiring herself, Shuixing went to the door and carefully knocked. &quot;Can I get some new clothes?&quot; she asked with her deeper, mature voice.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Muxing was the last of her sisters to convert and she seemed to be the most dangerous among them. She carried the biggest grudge against her former slavers and did not seem trustful of anyone outside of her sisters. Her choice of animal didn&#39;t make her less threatening. The Chinese tree viper was known for causing 50% of venomous bites in certain regions of Southeast Asia. The venom is rarely lethal, but very painful. Unlike other snakes, the tree viper would more likely bite than run away. Paired with a bitter and vengeful individual like Muxing did not inspire a lot of confidence. She was more required to see Dr. Jones after her conversion than Shuixing.<br />
<br />
Muxing didn&#39;t want to mince words. She wanted her conversion to be done as soon as possible. While she did show Ping some respect since she did rescue Muxing and her sisters, she barely addressed Dr. Stein directly. Not that she could much since she was still learning English. Muxing seemed to be wanting to prove she was tough as instead of being dosed with the Animalian virus treated with tree viper DNA, she wanted to be injected with tree viper venom that was laced with the Animalia virus.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t really have to do this,&quot; said Ping, &quot;It won&#39;t kill you, but you are going to feel pain before the transformation fully kicks in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You westerners have a saying,&quot; said Muxing, &quot;What doesn&#39;t kill me makes me stronger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ping sighed. Muxing was obviously a very complex case that required a lot more counsel than Ping was able to give. &quot;Where do you want us to inject you or did you have a preference?&quot; asked Ping.<br />
<br />
&quot;In my foot,&quot; said Muxing, having already taken off her shoes, &quot;I won&#39;t be needing it anymore anyways.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; said Ping, &quot;You might want to remove your pants and underwear before you change. The merging of your legs would make it really uncomfortable.&quot; Muxing didn&#39;t say anything but she did give a stiff nod. She wasn&#39;t about to strip in front of a man anytime soon. Then Dr. Stein leaned down and injected the two syringes into Muxing&#39;s foot, leaving a mark much like a snake bite. &quot;Welcome to Animalia,&quot; said Ping as she and Dr. Stein walked out.<br />
<br />
Muxing tried to keep her face from showing her pain, but the venom felt like a hot brand. Instead, she worked on removing her pants and underwear. She was starting to feeling numb in her foot. She looked down, expecting it to be turning black as the flesh died. Instead, it was turning green. As soon as she was bare below the waist, she sat on the bed as her legs were losing their feeling. Her right leg was showing the most change, emerald scales racing up it as the foot grew longer, losing toes and definition. Her left leg didn&#39;t seem to change, but Muxing could feel the bones in it growing weaker. She watched her left leg go limp as the bones in it dissolved. By then, her right leg was gaining more mass, in width as well as length. When it eventually made contact with her useless left leg, the skin between them parted and green scales spread over her left leg. Muxing watched with fascination as her left leg was absorbed into her right leg, which became larger as fully connected with her spine and became a long serpent&#39;s tail.<br />
<br />
Then the transformation-inducing venom started moving to the upper half of Muxing&#39;s body. Muxing lifted her shirt with interest to see the scales go up her belly. The slight burn of the venom matched the sensation of her muscles growing as her abs became more defined. When the burn reached her shoulders, Muxing was briefly worried that she&#39;d lose them too. But the scales went down her arms without showing signs of them withering and she watched with fascination as her nails became claws. She wondered briefly if her claws could inject with venom as well. Then she felt a discomfort in her chest. She thought her heart was stopping, but it was actually from her breasts. They grew considerably bigger, taking up more space in her shirt, forcing it to be drawn upwards, revealing her scaly abs.<br />
<br />
When the changes reached her head, Muxing worried she&#39;d lose her hair, but it didn&#39;t fall out. She looked in the mirror to watch the change. It was a bit disconcerting to see her pupils become slits, her nose vanish as her nostrils were pushed to the front of her extending mouth. She opened her mouth to see several teeth disappearing, the remaining ones becoming sharp fangs. Her tongue grew longer, a fork forming as it became more sensitive. Flicking her tongue out, she returned to her mouth and touched it to a hollow forming in the roof her mouth. Immediately, she could smell what she had just tasted. A pair of small pits like nostrils appeared on her snout, but they weren&#39;t for smelling. Like pit vipers, the tree vipers had special sensory organs for detecting heat. With a bit of focus, Muxing could shift her sight to a thermal-based vision. Though it didn&#39;t reveal a lot in this room with only herself in it.<br />
<br />
Switching back to her normal vision, Muxing was pleased with her new reflection. The snake woman looking back showed both beauty and deadliness. Her raven hair went quite well with her new emerald skin. She wasn&#39;t as bulky as Tuxing and Shuixing, but her muscles were well-toned. Her breasts were certainly larger, but they weren&#39;t impeding. Below her waist was a long, coiling tail. Her reformed vagina was barely detectable among her new scales, a slit that could be easily overlooked. With a nod of satisfaction, she headed towards the door. Slithering was much different from walking and it took Muxing a few tries before she was able to make to the door. She might not be a mammal like her sisters, but no one would be able to harm them again.</p>
