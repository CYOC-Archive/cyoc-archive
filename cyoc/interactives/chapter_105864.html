<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Robert stared at his reflection and groaned to himself, rubbing his groin as he felt pain towards down there. Like he over exerted his strength and energy over the good fuck he had last night, &quot;a huge ass hang over&quot; he thought, as he went off to the shower to try and fix his aching sore body in the morning. Only issue was that...he was sure he didn&#39;t drink last night...but conflicting memories said otherwise, already affected by the serum that&#39;s changing him inside out, and not the way that Jamie experienced. <br />
<br />
After all, traces of the serum was transferred onto his skin starting from penetrating Jamie&#39;s ass from the back, whilst James&#39;s serum was injected into his bloodstream immediately. By order, the serum took his appearance as the stereotype he was meant to be, rather than what he truly was from the inside. <br />
<br />
Robert groaned and groaned, feeling his muscles aching like never before, sure his body looked pretty straight with the way he dressed himself occasionally. But it lacked the experience and stereotypical personality of one, having being a closet gay back in school and only coming out recently prevented him from all these heists of cat-calling girls and making queer jokes with the other guys in sports. He wasn&#39;t one of them and would never insult his own sexuality, well...he wasn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ughhhhhh.&quot; Robert released some of the pain by flexing his own arms , showing his biceps off like he was trying to get more attention, feeling proud as he noticed that they&#39;re looking more defined than ever before. He never recalled showing off that often back in high school...but suddenly, he remembered mobs and mobs of girls swarming to him--giving him loads of attention. Of course, Robert felt it was weird knowing he kept a low profile back when he was younger...but for some strange reason, he kinda relished in these new thoughts of people giving him attention--especially the girls. --<br />
<br />
&quot;UGH...FUCKING DICK!&quot; Robert sped up his wash time in the shower, not bearing the pain in his dick any longer as he quickly rubbed the suds around his body, not even bothered by the water shifting from warm to cold as the seconds fly by. &quot;Cold is good for fixing pain.&quot; His mind told him, suddenly recalling a coach stating that after a workout. His muscles swelled more and his height rose decently until he was able to reach the shower top. After five minutes in attempt to chill his boner, he decided to screw it and fix the problem later.<br />
<br />
As Robert wiped his body in record speed, he noticed the hairs in his body kept at a nice-but manly length, an perfect balance that he knew that complemented his athletic body, noticing it&#39;s shape looking more toned and tanned than ever before. &quot;Sweeeet!&quot; He spoke like a bro, as he felt the deeper chords and tougher voice coming out through his mouth. His grin became cockier than ever, like he knew he was hot for a long while, with numerous people coming over and stroking his ego. <br />
<br />
He ferociously wiped and messed with his brown curls, as they straightened up and short spiky bristles poked from his head, with the back and sides shaved off. Spotting a nice manly crew cut. He proudly flexed his larger muscles once more in front of the mirror, tied the towel around his waist, he swaggered out of the bathroom in style.<br />
<br />
He re-entered the room, feeling it looked bigger all of a sudden. He scratched his head and looked at the bed he was on...although there were two beds now! One he was almost for sure that it was his boy-he lived there...right? He remembered signing the papers for the rental after all. He looked over to the bed closer to him, and noticed Jamie still sleeping, he felt his dick throbbing memories of last night still fresh in his---huh? What the fuck? He was totally wasted after drinking at the bar, he definitely didn&#39;t spend time with that twink shit. But wasn&#39;t he so cute---his dick tried to find substance in any relationship they might&#39;ve had, but nothing came up.<br />
<br />
He body sauntered over to the second bed, passing the walls of pink, layered with boy band and gay pride posters, his mind urging him to get away, scooch over to his side, it didn&#39;t want to play a part in the overwhelming streaks of gay pride. He layed over on his bed and flipped open his iPhone, placed a pair of earphones over his ears and jammed to light hearted music as he opened up Grindr, trying to look for hotties to score.<br />
<br />
He began sliding Xs and Xs past the many men that appeared on his screen, not even bothering with them despite them being fine ass twinks and studs. Not knowing as every guy he rejects, a gay pride poster from his side of the room shifts to Football, walls start streaking themselves with a dark green coating, and boy band posters began girl-ing into hot chicks.<br />
<br />
The music became more crude and hip hop, as they shifted to rap bursting rudely about  Sex and shit. Robert bobbed his head up and down and snagged a newly appeared SnapBack over at his bedside table and wore it backwards like he instinctively always did. Creating that douchebag look that swelled his ego and pride even further as he looked over to his phone and posed a duck face, feeling that fraternization within him as a nicely trimmed stubble layered over his squarer jaw. He was always so arrogant and cocky about his looks. <br />
<br />
Confidence to pure cockiness as he was proud of how sexy the photo looked, posting it on his social media.<br />
<br />
Almost instantly,  numerous incoming messages flooded from his Samsung phone as he hurriedly clicked on them, with stuff like Football messages from his  Fraternity Bros back in college, university freshmen shit and a distinct one from an unknown number, it reading &quot;hey Roger ;) , why not you come ever to my place we&#39;ll make it even hotter.&quot; Attached being a photo of a sexy chick that was posed indecently yet sexily.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, almost as though the new message triggered a spark in him, he whipped out his dick and started pumping away. Free hand pushing past his sheets and suddenly discovering a pair of lacy underwear at the corner as he fantasised fucking his babes over and over. &quot;FUCK YEAH BITCH!&quot; He bellowed, erecting literal walls and a line between Jamie and himself like he was now an outsider in his life. Divided rooms , with his room becoming completely messy and lined with Football memoir.  Sheets stained with conquests after conquests, with the scents mixed with musk and perfume getting to his head.<br />
<br />
Roger re-opened the data app, It was tinder after all, why would he use gay ass shit like his disgusting roomie Jam...Jam...Whatever! He swiped &quot;ticks&quot; to all the sexy sorority girls and different kinds of babes that appeared before him. As layers of experience, crudeness and popularity stroked over his ego, making him the manly man he ought to be. Inside out. Reality change almost completely shifting as the transformation sealed his new self into place.<br />
<br />
&quot;WOOOOOO! WOOOO!&quot;  He shouted, loud as ever like during Football nights with his Bros. Spluttering out the last traces of any gayness out onto his bed. Kicking back and laid back on his beefy arms. It was Sunday morning, he could chill for the rest of the day getting drunk and watching sports. He was taking a break from his part time job working as a model, &quot;being a stud has his benefits&quot; he smirked.<br />
<br />
KNOCK! &quot;Will you keep it down in there?! Some of us still need our beauty sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roger rolled his eyes at his homosexual roommate, if it wasn&#39;t a gay friendly apartment he would beat up that fag up. Call it Homophobic or whatever , but the two of them were the worst of roommates. The jock and the twink , the frat boy and the sissy boy, an alpha male and one that&#39;s lower than a beta. Each of them would get on the other&#39;s nerves constantly , fighting verbally whenever they clashed, like a married couple. <br />
<br />
&quot;Married? Ha! Sissy boy wishes. Fucking faggot.&quot; He spat , before realising it wasn&#39;t worth it. He was going to move over to the university dorms pretty soon, he just got to tolerate a few days with living with the twink. Sides, he could always stay over at any of his babes&#39; houses if he wanted--and maybe he&#39;ll do just that! <br />
<br />
Roger was glad he was straight, a heartthrob heterosexual hunk that the ladies swoon over, and wouldn&#39;t dare imagine what his life would&#39;ve been like if it wasn&#39;t so.</p>
