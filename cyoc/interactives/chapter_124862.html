<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The moment Olivia eagerly nodded, Sorcerer Spectra gave a snap of the fingers. More smoke and sparks appeared, and the crowd of kids ‘oooo’ed at the sight of a small rectangular table suddenly sitting on stage. A flat cushion filled up the tabletop’s surface.<br />
<br />
“Now don’t go ‘ooooo’ just yet!” said Spectra. “For our second step, our brave volunteer Olivia will lie her belly atop of this table. Olivia, if you please…”<br />
<br />
Olivia obeyed. With a bit of a magical boost from Sorcerer Spectra, Olivia climbed onto the table, and lay front-first atop of the cushion top, when she heard the Sorcerer laugh.  “Oh, no <i>no Olivia</i>, the <i>other</i> way.”<br />
<br />
Quite a few kids giggled, and Olivia blushed sheepishly as she oriented her rear away from the audience. “She really likes showing her peachy cheeks to everyone, doesn’t she?”, the Sorcerer joked. In truth, Olivia didn’t find showing her personal bits too bothersome. It was embarrassing, but somehow it made her more thrilled at whatever’s about to come.<br />
<br />
Olivia lay her belly upon the table as Spectra ordered. The table wasn’t too big, so Olivia found her limbs dangling a little on the sides. “Don’t worry, the fun part’s about to start soon,” said Spectra. “Let’s get your brother over here.” Little Caleb was busy sucking his thumb on the floor, when with the wave of Spectra’s hand, Caleb found himself floating up in midair. He laughed with high-pitched glee as he hovered over to his sister, who was fidgeting with anticipation as she heard his sounds. <br />
<br />
“Now Olivia, I am going to place your baby brother on top of your back. Hold still, alright?” <br />
<br />
In the stands, Nate and Katie watched as Caleb descended atop of Olivia. “What is she turning into?”, Katie asked Nate, who was watching intensely. Nate had a few ideas, but they all made him too squeamish to answer. <br />
<br />
“Let’s hope he doesn’t have to pee just yet,” the Sorcerer quipped, as Caleb patted his hands atop of Olivia’s back, which made Olivia laugh. “And now, the <i>fun</i> part.” <br />
<br />
Sorcerer Spectra gave another wave, which was paired with another sparkly noise. Immediately, Olivia felt a rush of wind as the entire world around her grew larger, and her limbs were no longer dangling from the table’s sides, but lying flat against a fast expanding cushion. The audience leaned closer to watch as Olivia shrank smaller and smaller, with Caleb weighing heavier atop of her body. When the shrinking stopped, Olivia found herself only half as tall as baby Caleb, but still with the proportions of an eight year old, squashed under Caleb’s legs and butt.  <br />
<br />
Olivia looked back in awe as a gigantic baby Caleb towered his happy head above her. She grinned with delight, but her cheeks turned even pinker when she realized she could feel her brother’s large baby dickie brushing against her hair and her neck.<br />
<br />
“There we go, ladies and gentlemen. We just made Olivia the little sister again!” <br />
<br />
A few boys in the stands made some loud joking groans. “Alright alright, no more puns,” the Sorcerer joked back. Olivia watched as Sorcerer Spectra loomed over her and her brother like a living, naked Statue of Liberty.  “We’re only just getting started! Olivia, do you know what I’m going to turn you into?” <br />
<br />
Olivia actually had no idea. These past few minutes have already become the strangest moments of her entire life, and she didn’t know what was in store for her now. Her body was jittering all over, but she didn’t stop smiling.  <br />
<br />
“…uh, no?” <br />
<br />
“Good answer!”, Spectra boomed. “It’s always nicer when it’s a surprise, isn’t it children? Now Olivia, you can move your legs behind your brother’s bottom, right? See if you can hold them with your hands.”<br />
<br />
Olivia bent back to look, wondering for a moment how she could even manage that. With a moment of thinking, Olivia bent her back up, and began reaching her arms backwards around her giant baby brother’s sides. For some reason, Caleb didn’t try to touch or play with Olivia, or do anything to accidentally disrupt Sorcerer’s Spectra’s act. Spectra bent her head up close to Olivia, enough that Olivia can feel the Sorcerer’s warm peppermint breath atop of her.  “That’s right, you’re getting it…”<br />
<br />
Olivia kept reaching, and she raised both her feet up so that she could get a closer grab. It wasn’t too much strain on Olivia, thanks to her time in her school’s gymnastics classes. Her hands eventually grasped upon her left and right ankles. <br />
<br />
“Perfect!,” Sorcerer Spectra exclaimed. “Don’t let go, just stay like this for just a moment. Hold on tight.” Spectra raised her hands and twirled her fingers. The table began to rotate like it was on an invisible turntable, and the audience got to get a look at Olivia and baby Caleb from all angles. High up above the stage, Sorcerer Spectra also conjured a magical screen that allowed the kids to see up close on Olivia from some invisible camera.<br />
<br />
In the stands, Katie frowned when she heard a few excited and sudden whispers in the audience. Was she starting to change already? Looking back at the stage, Olivia still seemed human. She seemed to be holding her pose pretty well too, though it did seem embarrassing. It was like Olivia was posing herself like an underwear around Caleb, or a-<br />
<br />
Katie’s eyes went wide.  And so did Nate&#39;s. <br />
<br />
“<i>She’s not…</i>” <br />
<br />
“You all had a good look?”, Spectra asked out loud as the table continued to rotate. “Alright. Great ready Olivia, here’s the <i>really</i> fun part.” She waved a hand, and more magical sparkling noises sounded. <br />
<br />
And then the real changes started. <br />
<br />
As calming, spectral music began playing from somewhere in the tent, Olivia felt her hands being glued to her ankles, and her arms and legs bending in ways that limbs shouldn’t, as if her bones had suddenly gone soft like rubber. Her lower legs were being stretched closer to the front of her body, while her arms sank into them like fluid, all while her hands and feet melded away.  <br />
Olivia’s insides felt mushy and weird, and she couldn’t feel any of the normal sounds coming from inside her body. To her shock, Olivia found she wasn’t even breathing anymore, and yet she didn’t feel any need for air. The young girl&#39;s torso began to go numb, and slowly pressed into a flatter shape and curved upward.<br />
<br />
At no point did Olivia feel any pain. In fact, the changes tickled her all over that it made Olivia quietly giggle (her lack of lungs meant she couldn’t let out her voice), and she felt strangely ‘fluffy’ as parts of her body puffed out. It was all warm and comfy, and also <i>really</i> good. <br />
<br />
A light pastel pink rapidly spread over Olivia’s skin. The patches of color appeared near her shoulders, and from there they went down the little girl’s entire torso (sealing and covering up her nipples, belly button, vagina and anus), and then eventually her former arms and legs. Wherever the pink spread, Olivia’s skin also began to crinkle up till it looked more like plastic fabric. <br />
As Olivia’s body changed even further, the only human and animate thing left on Olivia’s morphing body was her head. With her torso continuing to flatten, Olivia found herself being forced to look forward towards a stunned kid audience, while her head was being pulled downward by her vanishing neck. <br />
<br />
Her hair began dissolving into golden magical dust (which had Olivia letting out an awed, quiet ‘whoa’), and her head compressed pleasantly till it was as curved and thin as the rest of her torso. The form then sank into Olivia’s former shoulders, while her visibly awed face shifted down to her former chest. <br />
<br />
When Olivia’s face had slid down far enough, straps and creases began to appear as her fused and flattened limbs began showing signs of separation again. Olivia’s old legs were now wrapped over baby Caleb’s sides and former arms, and attached to the sides of her smoothed shoulders through two Velcro tapes.  <br />
<br />
Finally, the table stopped moving, leaving the audience with a front view of Olivia, who was now just a diaper with her living face on it. The whole time, the kids in the audience watched in absolute fascination. Neither Nate or Katie knew what to make of it. Watching a boy rapidly shrink into a baby was one thing, but a girl slowly turning into a diaper? And probably getting peed on by her own brother? It sounded horrifying and disgusting, and yet Olivia doesn’t seem frightened by any of this at all. “<i>Maybe she’s really hypnotized!</i>”, Katie whispered to Nate. <br />
<br />
The two siblings watched on. While the music continued, Sorcerer Spectra stepped closer to the table, and reached her right hand over down to Olivia. Baby Caleb had remained still and quiet, almost as if he were put in a trance during the entire performance. <br />
With a finger, the Sorcerer tickled Olivia’s plastic cheek. This brought out yet another little giggle from the transformed little girl. The Sorcerer grinned, and then brought the rest of her hand closer. She waved her fingers once, and Olivia’s nose sank into her body while her nostrils sealed up.<br />
Then, Sorcerer Spectra motioned her fingers for Olivia to smile, and pointed towards the audience. Olivia happily obeyed, and gave a wide grin while looking forward. Spectra waved a swift hand over Olivia’s face. <br />
<br />
The audience of kids gasped. In an instant, Olivia’s eyes and mouth, all that was left of her animate human face, had become just a two dimensional drawn image on the front of the diaper. <br />
<br />
A few kids began to applaud, but Sorcerer Spectra raised a finger for silence. There was just one tiny little touch left. As the children hushed up for a little longer, the Sorcerer waved a hand over Olivia’s flattened face. Olivia’s eyes morphed into round circles of flat brown, and drawn colored petals began pushing out of the sides of each one, leaving two simple cartoon flowers. The drawing of Olivia’s mouth dissolved into a few separate dots forming a rough form of her smile, with each dot eventually growing into a cartoon flower like her eyes, even matching their size. <br />
The Sorcerer gave one more wave of her hand, and the cartoon flowers ‘blew’ around the diaper front until they formed a happy pattern one would expect on any disposable diaper. There was not a single trace of Olivia left on the diaper, or any hint that the diaper was ever an eight year old human girl.  <br />
<br />
Sorcerer Spectra picked baby Caleb up with her hands, and hoisted him up in the air with his pink, flower-pattern diaper in full view.<br />
