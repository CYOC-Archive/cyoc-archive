<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;m going to turn you into diapers.&quot;<br />
The two boys still felt weird, and couldn&#39;t really get what she was saying. Not in fact, as if she was speaking a different language, more as if they were sleepy, and the full meaning of the words had yet to reach them.<br />
Kat continued her spell. This was going to be so fun.<br />
The boys began to feel their body going numb as they could see their extremities begin to flatten.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re actually not going to need this&quot; Kat said as she magically removed their clothings. She didn&#39;t want to have the search a pile of clothes to find the new diapers.<br />
The skin of the two boys was becoming paler each second, and their body were beginning to lose their human shape, though it was still imperceptible. Their neck were getting shorter and their leg were slowly but surely taken apart.<br />
The realization of their fate finally sank in.<br />
&quot;What, so this was real ?&quot; John shouted (or tried at least, his mouth was getting harder to control)<br />
&quot;I told you my sister wouldn&#39;t lie to us&quot;. Patrick then turned to Kat<br />
&quot;That was unexpected sis, why would you turn us into diapers ?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, I find it kinky. Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;re going to love it.&quot; She answered truthfully. The idea that the two boys were soon going to be just a pair of diapers was really turning her own. She was going to leave them aware. She considered that if she did not then it would be the same as killing them and popping diapers. Somehow that was not as exciting. Suddenly her mom came in.<br />
&quot;Hi mom, what are you doing here ?&quot;<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t want to miss my girl first transformation, and beside, it&#39;s always fun to watch&quot;. She bent towards her daughter ear and whispered :<br />
&quot;Even more so when children realize their mom are totally fine with them being transformed. Believe me, I&#39;ve once turned a friend&#39;s daughter into a dog because her mom was getting fed up with her, that was hilarious.&quot; She picked up. &quot;So anyway, what are you turning them into ?&quot;<br />
&quot;Diapers&quot;<br />
&quot;Ho, you have a kinky side in you.&quot; She chuckled.<br />
&quot;Mom aaa... aaahee hou ohay widd whad shed doing do us ?&quot; John shouted (tried).<br />
&quot;Well of course dear, it&#39;s a tradition for a witch to make a first spell on her family. Beside, you were practically begging for it. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll love it.&quot; She laughed.<br />
&quot;How coooul... wheee... lofe ...eeing ...iapers ?&quot; Talking was becoming almost impossible for John, but he was still shocked, first by the fact the Kat was a real witch, and second by the fact that he was going to become a diaper, a waste holder. He would spend a day hanging around the hips of... he didn&#39;t even know who to be filled by his/her poop, just to be thrown away and rot for eternity.<br />
&quot;Because I can make it so silly.&quot; answered Kat maliciously. &quot;Now shush, and enjoy your transformation.&quot;<br />
As Kat said those words, the transformation sped up. The &quot;boys&#39; limbs&quot; were now complete white tapes, and their head had almost receded into their &quot;bodies&quot;. They also began shrinking and a subtle mental alteration was taking place. John was not able (and neither was Patrick, though it was not his main issue) to be horrified by what was happening to him anymore, thought he knew he was supposed to be. <br />
<br />
A few minutes later the changes were coming to an end. Were two boys had stand no lied two disposables white diapers.<br />
Kat bent over them and picked them up.<br />
&quot;Are they still aware ?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes they are, otherwise it wouldn&#39;t be as fun.&quot;<br />
&quot;So what are you going to do with them ?&quot;<br />
&quot;I wasn&#39;t sure at first, be I think I&#39;m gonna use them.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, so they are going to trash in a little while ?&quot;<br />
&quot;Humm... no, I&#39;ll use one of them a day, while the other recover from the day before. Trashing them would not be nice&quot;<br />
&quot;Turning them into diapers is ?&quot;<br />
&quot;They asked for it. Literally.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay, I&#39;ll let you change then, come see me when you&#39;re done.&quot; She got out of the chamber.<br />
<br />
Kat considered the two diapers. She couldn&#39;t which one was who. She could have checked their thoughts to know, but that would be considering them still as human beings. Maybe she&#39;ll try in a few weeks. She picked one and proceeded to change into it. As one would expect from a magically formed diaper, it fitted like a glove. She got in front of the mirror to check her looks. It looked real cute. She didn&#39;t want to hide it, so she just picked up a T-shirt, putted it on, and went to join her mother downstairs.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, John (he was the one that was picked) finally came to the realization that he was a diaper. He couldn&#39;t see anything, but he could still feel and hear. He would soon see that his senses of smell and taste also did, so they were altered. He had felt himself begin being wrapped up around Kat&#39;s waste. The fact that is position felt real nice was upsetting him. He was supposed to hate it, and the fact that he couldn&#39;t bring himself to do it made him feel strange. He then felt Kat move, and he couldn&#39;t help but feel proud that he was holding so nicely the waist of Kat.<br />
<br />
Kat was coming downstairs. Her mom saw her. A smile passed on her face and she made a gesture. Suddenly Kat felt her bladder and bowels fill and give out. Her diaper tripled in size and she felt both a nice wetness and a hot mush spreading around her but cheeks and front, though none of it leaked. John felt really proud that he had been able to hold all that mess, then realized this was not what he was supposed to feel. What&#39;s more, he realized that it had quite a good taste and smell and this left him dumbfounded.<br />
&quot;Hey why did you do that ?&quot; said Kat, putting on a pout.<br />
&quot;Sorry sweetie.&quot; laughed her mother &quot;Seeing you in just the diaper just made to tempting.&quot; She sniffed the air. &quot;Pew, someone is a little stinker huh&quot;.<br />
&quot;And whose fault is it I wonder.&quot;<br />
&quot;So, how is your diaper doing ?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, you could just ask it yourself.&quot;<br />
So she did. She touched John&#39;s consciousness with her own.<br />
&quot;So how is my little boy doing as a diaper&quot;.<br />
John was surprised by the sudden voice of his mother.<br />
&quot;Mom you gotta help me. I  think I&#39;m going crazy, please turn me back.&quot;<br />
&quot;Haww... is that so ? But you look like a really nice diaper to me.&quot;<br />
John somehow didn&#39;t know how to feel about what his mom just said.<br />
&quot;Wh-What do you mean ?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well did you see how you held Kat&#39;s mess without even a leak. That was impressive, I don&#39;t know many diaper who could have done that.&quot; she whispered with her sweetest voice. John was suddenly filled with pride, though he knew that was strange.<br />
&quot;That was nothing&quot; he boasted, &quot;I could have hold much more !&quot;<br />
&quot;Is that so sweetie ? Whoa, I would love to see that.&quot;<br />
Kat&#39;s mother (her real body) made the same gesture as before, and Kat felt the same sensation as before before filling her diaper even more. Her mess had spread everywhere inside her diaper, but none of it got out.. Fortunately, she had made it so that she would get no diaper rash.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you see that ?&quot; asked John to her mother.<br />
&quot;I did sweetie. I&#39;m very proud of you. I gotta go. Keep mommy proud by being the best diaper ever sweetie.&quot;<br />
&quot;I will !&quot; assured John, felling prouder than ever.</p>
