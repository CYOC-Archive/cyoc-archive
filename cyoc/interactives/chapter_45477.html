<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>"This sucks," Daniel noted, as his 3D view of the pedestals containing each of the possible two-person teams were shown before them.  He walked as a formless ghost up and down the isle, noting Tome's presence in the friend's list as the two of them look in the sights of all the possible choices.</p>

<p>"I agree," Tom said, taking in the appearances of all their current characters... it was a problem, the two were realizing, because all the choices of the six accounts laid out before them were of either a man and a woman or two woman.  They didn't much care for the backgrounds, but there weren't any choices for two men.</p>

<p>"We got knights, we got mystics, we got what looks like two n00bs trying to create Superman and Lois Lane," Daniel added to his previous thought.  Nothing looked that enticing.</p>

<p>"I guess it's gotta be these two," Tom said, stepping over to Misty and Tracy.  They looked like werewolves of a sort.  They were about nine foot tall, fairly muscled, and barely dressed at all in some sort of shamanist clothing like they were in the middle of a ritual.  Their background image showed them to be inside of a hut somewhere.</p>

<p>Daniel smirked somewhere back on his own side of the login screen.  He'd been looking at them too, "Gotta be the twins," he agreed, noting that the two woman were identical except for a few pieces of their attire.  "I'm always up for not playing a human," he added.</p>

<p>"I've played a mystic before," Tom noted, "So I could probably figure out our talent trees," he said.</p>

<p>"And I've played a Canis Sapien before, so I know some of their culture," he added.  "There's a lot of rituals involving sex and blood and sacrificing people," he laughed.  "Gotta love an A-Rated Game."</p>

<p>"Agreed," Tome said.  "I call dibs on Tracy."</p>

<p>"Fine with that, but why?" Dan asked.</p>

<p>"Tom and Tracy both start with T... and Misty sounds like the name of a sexual deviant, which is what you are," Tom laughed.  Daniel said nothing, but hit his own 'Enter the Kingdom' button that was just hovering out there near his incorporeal hand.</p>

<p>In the next moment, Daniel and Tome both shook themselves off as they became Tracy and Misty inside the game.  The two Canis were laying beds of pillows on either side of a room inside a wooden and straw hut.  There were the sounds of howls and song going on outside, and it sounded like a celebration was going on.</p>

<p>"Sounds like someone's having a good time," Tracy said as she sat up from her bed and went to go look out the front flap of the hut.  A few people looked at her, and she waved plainly.  The night war warm, and there was a firepit with people dancing around it while others sat and drank from flasks.</p>

<p>"Oh shit," Daniel as Misty said, looking around the room.  Her canine nose sniffed the air, and she put a hand to one of her breasts.  Tom as Tracy looked back at her just in time to see Misty put a hand down her front behind her loincloth.  Misty sniffed her hand as she looked up at Tom, and then shook it as if it were wet with something.</p>

<p>"What they hell, man?" Tracy asked in a slight growl of a female voice.</p>

<p>"Don't you feel hot?" Misty asked as she stood up and walked over to a tray of candles set up against one wall.  She looked them over as Tracy looked down at herself, checking under her cloth bra.  "I'm in the middle of," and then Daniel turned Misty's head around to quickly look to a similar set of candles along the opposite wall.  "<i>We're</i> in the middle of an honorable mating ritual," she said.</p>

<p>Tracy thought that explained the flush feeling she had, or the 'itch' between her legs.  She frowned and looked around the room.  There was incense that smelled wonderful, a little bit of smoke in the air, and two fairly large beds of pillows large enough for four or more people.  "But we're girls," Tom said, looking at Daniel, "And brothers."</p>

<p>"Not with each other, you ditz," Daniel slapped Misty's forehead.  "Twins are a mystical sign of awesome among the Canis.  It's a buff to our powers when near each other, and a debuff when not," she explained in game terms.  "But the mating of twins with twins creates something akin to a new life-path for whatever class that's been chosen.  If we're both mystics, we'll probably be able to summon all kinds of creatures and abilities if we go through with this," she said.</p>

<p>"So when you say Twins with Twins, you mean that we're sisters about to be mated to two brothers?" Tracy asked.  "Forget that.  If they're NPC's, we can just avoid them," she said.  "With NPC's, you have to consent.  You know that," she said, putting her hands on her hips, her tail flicking back and forth.</p>

<p>Misty pointed each of her index fingers at a different set of candles, "That doesn't apply here, because the ritual is already in progress," she said.  "Whoever had these characters logged out in the middle of the rite.  This is the part where the males go off and commune with spirits and gain their energies before coming back to make it official," Daniel said.</p>

<p>"Then we'll just log out," Tom as Tracy said, not liking the sound of this.</p>

<p>"But what about the power?" Daniel asked, and Tom just gave an exasperated look.  "Look, I'm just saying.  All our other choices sucked and could be worse than these.  If we go through with this, we'll at least have special abilities when it's all done," Daniel explained in the female Canis' voice.</p>

<p>Tom and Daniel only had this moment to chose, as the sounds of the two large Canis males were approaching the tent.  Their musk entered the hut before they did, and Tracy and Misty both felt a ripple across their bodies as they understood the want and need to be with them.  Though their minds were unclouded, the bodies said they looked forward to it.</p>

<p>"Well?" Daniel asked, "What do we do?"</p></p>
