<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Liam and Grayson made a good pair down at the lake. Liam managed to wrangle all the young boys. He had that sort of air about him that goo coaches have, the masculine beaver got plenty of respect out of the smaller critters. Meanwhile most of the girl campers flocked to Grayson, his surfer boy good looks meant he was one of the favorites in the girl cabins, if only they knew.<br />
<br />
Swimming and boating lessons went quick, then it was time for free swim. Grayson say perched up in the lifeguard tower with a good view over the lake to keep an eye on everyone. Liam leaned against the tower, keeping a closer eye on things that were happening on the small sandy strip along the lake shore.<br />
<br />
Grayson had to admit, he didn&#39;t think much of the beaver at first with his slow country drawl and oversized muscles. He figured he was going to be some dumb, red-neck jock. But Liam had a wicked sense of humor and a sharper wit than the otter had given him credit for. And he had to admit, the easy confidence was kind of sexy.<br />
<br />
A floating memory made the otter wonder who the beaver had been. Grayson had accepted the camp pretty quick, being the first and easiest to fall in line on that first day. He knew he had been someone else only a few days prior, but that was a fleeting memory, and one the otter preferred to forget. When the shy and mousy Gloria woke up in the body of a sexy, surfer otter she hadn&#39;t even questioned it. Even the change in gender seemed right. Liam being around had that same feeling of rightness to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, about this morning in the shower..&quot; Grayson started, not taking his eyes off the lake but still obviously addressing Liam.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about it?&quot; Liam had pulled another of his chewing sticks out, this one had the sweet smell of sassafras that Grayson could smell from his seat on the tower. &quot;Derek! Henry! Put the sticks down!&quot; Liam snapped at two of the campers that had started sword fighting with a pair of fallen tree branches. They complied and went running back into the water.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was that just a.. thing, or did it mean something?&quot; Grayson looked down at Liam for just a moment before he looked back out at the lake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want it to mean something?&quot; He could almost hear the beaver smiling, he knew his cabinmate was being purposefully obtuse, prodding him into embarrassment seemed to be Liam&#39;s new favorite hobby.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like it to.&quot; Grayson said, feeling at least confident enough to be direct. He knew Liam attended the same college as him. Most of the counselors attended the same college, but it was a big school so it was no wonder they hadn&#39;t run into each other last year. Both of them going into their sophomore year come fall. But being from the same school also meant this could be something more than a summer fling, if Grayson played his cards right.<br />
<br />
&quot;That so?&quot; Liam said as he looked up at the otter from below. &quot;So was walking around the cabin naked a hint?&quot;<br />
<br />
Grayson felt his cheeks heat a little but shook his head. &quot;Nah, I just like being naked when I can be. Drove my roommate last year nuts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;re no squirrel but you do have nice nuts.&quot; Luckily there were no kids in earshot to hear the beaver&#39;s joke. &quot;Nicer buns.&quot; Liam was looking up at Grayson in a way the otter knew he was being pictured naked.<br />
<br />
Grayson couldn&#39;t help but laugh. He was going to ride himself a beaver before this weekend was over, he was sure of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is everyone here? I think we&#39;re missing someone.&quot; Liam said suddenly a little serious. &quot;Ollie and Marty.&quot; He said, picking out the missing kids instantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that you mention it, I haven&#39;t seen them since free swim started.&quot; Liam sighed. &quot;Bet they snuck off, I&#39;ll keep an eye on the kids here, you wanna look around for them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess I better.&quot; Liam headed off down to the lakeside, probably to ask any of the kids if they saw the pair. He shot Grayson a thumbs up and turned to head towards the woods.<br />
<br />
------------------------------<br />
<br />
After lessons finished, Liam and Grayson had stepped aside to get things changed over for free swim, the two counselors bantering between each other. Marty grabbed Ollie&#39;s hand and gave it a little tug, motioning him to follow. The rabbit led the coyote away from the lake side and into the trees, a bit back from shore where an old picnic table sat under the shady canopy.<br />
<br />
They could still hear the activity at the lake, but the leafy trees hid them from sight as they both sat on the table, their feetpaws on the bench.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feeling better?&quot; Ollie asked, his tone a little concerned. &quot;You had me a bit worried this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just had a weird dream.&quot; Marty said, scrunching his nose as some of Marie&#39;s memories of yesterday floated up. He reached out and took Ollie&#39;s paw in his, which helped ground his Marty self.<br />
<br />
Soon the two teens had their muzzles locked together again, enjoying their second make out session. They were both still new and clumsy, but neither of them knew any better. Marty felt giddy at it, like this was both the first time and the end of a long drought of no romance. Sure, it may just be puppy love, or a thing for just their time at camp, but it was the thing Marty needed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahem..&quot; The throat clearing had the two teens suddenly separating. Both looked over to see Liam standing a few yards off, hands on his hips in a way that made his already powerful arms bulge. &quot;I&#39;m going to walk back to the lake. I expect to see the two of you there by the time I reach the lifeguard tower. I&#39;ll pretend I didn&#39;t see anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Liam and Marty&#39;s eyes met. And both of them had a sudden jolt of memory, memory that disappeared faster for Liam than it did for Marty. The beaver just shook his head and headed back to the lake, muttering &quot;Kids,&quot; under his breath.<br />
<br />
Marty knew. Or rather Marie knew who that Liam was. She felt like she was losing her son, but something in the back of her mind told her he was better here, that as a mother she should let him go to be happy, but Marty&#39;s thoughts washed back over those like a wave as Ollie got up and hopped off the bench. &quot;Better do as he says. I&#39;m not crossing Liam. Dude&#39;s scary when he gets angry.&quot; The coyote seemed to consider his words. &quot;Super hot, but super scary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed.&quot; Marty said as he joined Ollie for the walk back to the beach. Soon the pair were back on the lakeshore just as Liam resumed leaning against the guard tower. He said something Marty was too far away to catch, but the amused laugh from the otter was clear enough. &quot;Aww man. Now every counselor is going to know.. George, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ollie just patted the rabbit on the shoulder. &quot;Well, I think your brother already figured it out, but.. we&#39;ll figure something out.&quot;</p>
