<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Melissa had been camping in a state park, but unforseen events have gotten her in a pickle of a situation. Melissa is a young adult woman who is 5 foot 10 inches tall, weight of around 140 pounds on a good day and 150 pounds on a bad day. She is a brunette and is overall very fit. She has around B cup breasts with what you can call a bubble butt. Hearing how her boyfriend James Miller was going on a trip had made her wanting to go on her own trip. You could say it was almost a little spitefull. Do you know Veruca Salt? She&#39;s the girl who has a daddy complex in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, well Melissa has a little bit of that in her; A matter of fact Melissa&#39;s dad actually is the boss of henry and that&#39;s how Melissa and James met to begin with!<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay this isn&#39;t funny....&quot;, Melissa was completely lost and camping alone did not help her situation. She could see on her phone that it was 6:30pm and she was heading east with her compass app guiding. She wasn&#39;t stupid and east is where the campground is, but no matter which direction she goes it seems to lead her nowhere. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is it hot out here our is it just me?&quot;, it got 20 degrees hotter in like 10 minutes and the heat was killing her right now. With the heat and fear of being lost starting to scare her she decided to put her mind on other things...... Thinking about James and her own thoughts about him,&quot; James baby I wish you were hear right now&quot;, In thinking about him came out another thought however........ She absolutely hated that Joan with an absolute passion, if she was going to have a serious relationship with James that mom has got to leave the picture. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can just force James to never see her again&quot;, She had never thought of herself as a bad person, but one can only wonder what James sees in her?<br />
<br />
Melissa rounding a corner finally found something &quot;A open clearing sweet!, Looking further she couldn&#39;t really make out what she was seeing. It looked like maybe a tan colored tent that wasn&#39;t fully built yet, and even better yet there was a person standing a ways away from the tent.<br />
<br />
&quot;That must be a camper who is still building a tent!&quot;, Melissa&#39;s fear went down significantly and preparing her voice decided to yell out &quot;Can Anyone Help Me Im Lost!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Joan had seen the brunette far before even she yelled out to them, horny and honestly about to have a threesome with Dakota and James, the only thing that stopped her was a smell. Her muzzle had probably been half grown just from lust alone, but she could still smell a woman that she&#39;s smelled before? This made her stop in her tracks and focus on her surroundings, it was that perfume..... She only encountered one person in her life that wore that perfume and it was that girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;you&#39;ve got to be kidding me....&quot;, She could see someone walking in the distance and she just knew it was her. The yelling and hearing that voice only confirmed what she already knew &quot;It&#39;s Melissa&quot;, Joan had personally never liked Melissa and she reminded her of a graverobber Money, Money, Money, It didn&#39;t matter how much she has or she will eventually inherit, If she can make a quick buck she will stab you in the back. In many ways Joan and Melissa were a lot alike, but the difference was Joan grew up and changed when she met Henry and Melissa might never change! <br />
<br />
Melissa started to walk towards the camper and the tent. Joan was beginning to panic and needed to act fast. &quot;Atleast the two love birds didn&#39;t hear anything&quot;, James and Dakota were still doing their thing and wouldn&#39;t care less anyways. Joan still loved her son and acting on her mothers instincts decided to act.<br />
<br />
Joan will not let Melissa see James or what he&#39;s doing &quot;He doesn&#39;t deserve that&quot;, As Joan said this her muzzle had completely shrunk down and in acting like a guardian; Joan could feel something else, maybe it was pride, but her own willpower has grown from what she&#39;s about to do. &quot;I will not have sex today or ever again&quot;, A blank statement that definitely won&#39;t hold up, but seeing Melissa has given Joan some inspiration and she will not let that dumb girl watch her become a goat!<br />
<br />
Joan started to run, breasts/udders flinging in every direction, she was going to scare Melissa knowing that there is no way she could ever reason with her, especially in her current state.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is that person running?&quot;, She had asked for help and appreciated the enthusiasm, but...... This person was running straight for her like its a 40 yard dash. As this person got closer, and closer, and close; Melissa&#39;s enjoyment turned back into fear, she didn&#39;t know whether or not to laugh or be scared. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is that a costume?&quot;, stuttering to herself now it was complete terror as the goat freak got closer &quot;Shit&quot;, up until this point she didn&#39;t feel she was in danger and never grabbed her bear mace in the open slot on her backpack.&quot;Shit Shit Shit&quot;, She threw off the one strap of her backpack and quickly grabbed it. Finally grabbing the canister she looked up to see the goat freak standing right by her....... Melissa never thought of herself as a lesbian, but the breasts on Joan had distracted her for a couple seconds giving Joan sometime to catch her breath and think of how how she will scare Melissa.<br />
<br />
&quot;BLEATTTTTTT!&quot;, Joan made the natural sound a goat would and did it as loudly as possible!<br />
<br />
Melissa stunned and mesmerized by boobs had her body jump and shake from the sound this monster made. Melissa panicked with shaking hands aimed the bear mace and intended to use it<br />
<br />
&quot;Eat this you psycho BITCH&quot;,  Melissa aimed the Mace....... but nothing happened. In her panic and being distracted by boobs; She had forgotten the switch needed to be put on in order for the mace to work.<br />
<br />
Losing her edge Melissa ran as far as she could away from this hell hole and hoped she would find her campground even though she dropped her phone back in the open area. Hoping in her panic god would guide the way.<br />
<br />
&quot;bitch&quot; Joan could only smurk &quot;I couldn&#39;t have chosen a better animal for you myself Melissa&quot;.</p>
