<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Derrick stumbled back to his feet and frantically dashed to the sauna door. He wasn&#39;t going to spend another second in this death trap. It was literally draining his life away, sweating out his youth and making him older the longer he stayed in there. But as he turned the door handle, he found that the door wouldn&#39;t budge. It had been locked from the outside, with no means to open it from the inside. Derrick panicked, surely this was a building code violation at the very least! He banged his fists against the door and yelled, trying to get someone&#39;s attention. However the saunas were at the back of the spa where nobody could hear his screams. Derrick yanked and pushed on the door with all his might to try and force it to open. Then he backed up and charged into the door, slamming all his newly acquired brawn into the heavy metal. Alas, it didn&#39;t even shift an inch. Derrick made one last feeble slam against the sauna door before turning his back to it and sliding down to the floor, clutching his large calves with his broad hands and resting his bearded chin on his knees. There was no way out. He was trapped inside the sauna for as long as his session was. But how long would that be? <br />
<br />
Even as he sat on the floor, Derrick could feel his youth seeping out of him. The way his body was subtly growing bulky and burlier. The almost irritable itch as new body hair sprouted across his shoulders and upper back. He had to be in his mid twenties already, how much older was he going to get? He thought back to the middle aged man he encountered before entering the sauna. How old was he before he had his treatment? Was Derrick going to suffer the same fate, was he going to leave looking like someone&#39;s grandpa? And that guy was happy to be a man in his fifties! Not like Derrick, He didn&#39;t even want to be a twenty-something until he&#39;d naturally aged into one. What was going to happen when he got home? He&#39;d be far, far too old to go back to school. And college was out of the question without any qualifications to his name. No, he&#39;d have to get a job somewhere. He would always be welcome at his dad&#39;s company, but would they want a middle-aged high school drop-out? Because that&#39;s basically what he&#39;ll become if the last guy was any indication. He&#39;d be even older than his dad... a chill went down his spine. What if he was trapped for longer, ending up at retirement age? He knew his family wouldn&#39;t hesitate to put him in a care home, his life wasted, his dreams unfulfilled, having had no chance to make an impact on the world. Derrick choked back a sob. He felt lost, and hopeless. He was close to breaking down in tears, he didn&#39;t want any of this to happen to him! All because he tried to flirt with and impress that spa chick! He realised now that she probably wasn&#39;t lying to him when they first met. Maybe she really was some old woman who accidentally used too much magic youth cream and ended up a teenager. It sounded like fiction, but here he was growing beefier and hairier by the minute so it had to be true. <br />
<br />
Derrick paused for a moment and went back over his thoughts. Magic youth cream? That&#39;s it! Whatever happens to him in the sauna, however old he gets, he could always reverse the effects by using whatever magic anti-ageing stuff they had! It&#39;s all Hebe was talking about, and she was the expert on it too! He could get her to give him a massage, he could be young again and all would be well! Hell, maybe he could keep a bit of his maturity and stay as an adult until the vacation was over. Being a man wasn&#39;t all bad, it did have its perks aside from his hulking, hairy bod. It was pretty awesome to be of drinking age after all. He could hit the bar, chat up some cute honeys and maybe even lose his virginity. There was a silver lining to this after all. Derrick took in some deep breaths and gradually regained his composure before pushing himself back to his feet and straightening his back, only to bash his head against the ceiling again. He cried out in pain and annoyance, rubbing the top of his head where it hurt. His face scrunched up in confusion as he noticed something drift down past his vision. The area his head hurt felt unusual. He pulled his hand back down and his eyes darted to the abnormal amount of loose hair clinging to his palm. &quot;Oh no...&quot; The realisation struck him in the chest hard, and he scrambled back to the mirror. <br />
<br />
He growled in frustration as he saw what he had feared in his reflection. His hair was falling out in clumps. His forehead had already expanded by an inch at least, as his hairline crept back and formed a harsh M shaped across the top of his scalp. He bent over and brushed his hands through his thinning hair furiously, watching loose follicles float down like he&#39;d received a haircut, and poofing out of existence before it reached the ground. He stopped after a few seconds and looked back to the mirror to study the damage. There was already a small, yet glaringly noticeable bald spot at the back of his head. What remained looked exceedingly thin and fragile, his scalp visible underneath. He threw his hands up in the air and slammed them against his thighs. &quot;Great! Just great!&quot; he yelled sarcastically. Of course he was losing his hair already. He&#39;d always known he&#39;d go bald at an early age. Hell, there wasn&#39;t a man in his family over thirty who had a full head of hair. It was inevitable given the plentiful body hair, endomorphic bodies, and high levels of testosterone in their bloodline. And Derrick had accepted this, even low-key yearned for it to happen when he was much younger. It was just as much a rite of passage in his family as anything else. But he always thought he&#39;d have at least another decade until he had to worry, and now it was all evacuating his scalp at once. Derrick gulped down his annoyance and tried to think about the treatments he could get upon leaving the sauna. He&#39;ll have his hair back again in no time. <br />
<br />
He brushed off his body, unsure what was loose head hair and what was actual body hair now it had grown to cover even more of his exposed skin. The front of his torso looked like he&#39;d stuck a fur rug to himself with its thickness and density. The hair grew thinner along the sides of his body before growing thicker again as a healthy coating of hair spread across his entire back. Even his ass cheeks had been smothered with a barrier of soft hairs. His beard had filled in completely and added another half inch to its length. If Derrick looked closely, he could see a few strands of silver were piercing through it&#39;s dark mass. His waist was thick, solid and rough, no longer sporting his hard-earned abs but still strong and imposing. Meanwhile his pecs had grown bigger and more voluminous, pushing his broadening shoulders back and making it hard to keep his bulging arms to the side. He was no longer strong in an aesthetically pleasing way, with the the lean, defined musculature he&#39;d worked hard to maintain. Instead, he looked strong in a more practical way. No longer defined but pure bulk. He had definitely joined the ranks of men in his family now. Balding, hairy, burly. Derrick already looked to be over double his original age and had no idea how much longer he had to endure this rapid ageing. Would he make it out before he reached his dad&#39;s age?</p>
