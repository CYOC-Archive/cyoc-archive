<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was the end of her only child, Emily&#39;s, birthday. She had just turned 10, and Rebecca couldn&#39;t be more proud of her. It was also a fairly big day for Rebecca... but for different reasons. <br />
<br />
A little over 10 years earlier, Emily wasn&#39;t her daughter, but HIS girlfriend. The two had been college sweethearts, and everything seemed to be going well... until they bought that magical camera. It could change reality itself at random, and later they even discovered there were specific modes to specify crazy changes. Unfortunately, they had used it willy nilly.<br />
<br />
All it took was one wrong picture, and that was it. Emily had it when they used it, and when it made her an unborn fetus, it went away with her, stranding Rick, now Rebecca, in this new reality as an adult, pregnant woman. At first, Rick was mortified. He searched for as long as his tired, pregnant body let him.<br />
<br />
He soon realized he was stuck, and tried to make the best of it. To his surprise, this life wasn&#39;t so bad. He had tons of girlfriends, all of which were so nice and caring. He had so much time off and found himself enjoying stuff like Grey&#39;s Anatomy and the Real Housewives way more now. He also had a husband, Mr. Powell, his former single neighbor...<br />
<br />
He... no, she, fell in love with him. He was beefy, handsome, was so kind and romantic to Rebecca, and in bed... in bed. Thanks to being pregnant, they fucked... a lot. The way he ate her out, his tongue flying all over, stimulating her clit, she felt like she ascended. The feeling of a long, fat cock in her, the multiple orgasms, hell even the sexy bed talk just hit so much better as a woman. <br />
<br />
Of course, she felt more of a woman now and more in touch with her life, but still thought of herself as Rick, if nothing else for Emily. While she enjoyed herself, she felt so guilty... like she was cheating on Emily. That was, until the day of her birth. It sucked, and Rick seemed to almost be pushed aside in the process. She knew, holding her adorable baby girl in her arms, that she was Rebecca. Who cared if things were once different. Reality itself changed, and according to everything this is how it always was, and Rebecca wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.<br />
<br />
These were just some of the thoughts as she picked up the scattered plates form her daughter&#39;s friends. The party was basically over as the last few kids left, and Rebecca was at peace. She considered this day, Emily&#39;s birth day, to almost be Rebecca&#39;s re-birthday. The day she accepted who she was. Of course, like every life, this one didn&#39;t come without complications....<br />
<br />
Out of the corner of her eye, she spotted Emily smiling hard at the pony they had hired for the party. It was a white little thing with pink bows in its mane named Ariel. Rebecca was going to think nothing of it, until she looked harder at her daughter&#39;s smile... it was that smirk, that sly smirk she did when she used her powers.<br />
<br />
Those damn powers. It didn&#39;t take too many years before Rebecca realized what happened to the camera, and she did her best to instal good morals in Emily, to ensure nothing went awry, but she still had a mischievous streak that couldn&#39;t be extinguished. Thanks to her history with the camera, she was in the best position to spot changes to reality, though wasn&#39;t always perfect. <br />
<br />
She went over everything in her head. Everything she thought for the past minute, hour, day... and one thought struck her... only child. Emily wasn&#39;t an only child. She walked up to Emily, arms crossed, and Emily crouched in shame.<br />
&quot;H-hi mommy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rebecca didn&#39;t always know as much as Emily thought she did, but always tried to maintain an aura of confidence to ensure she didn&#39;t try to sneakily get away with too much.<br />
&quot;Fix it NOW young lady.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes mommy.&quot; She sighed sadly, and after a bright FLASH Rebecca remembered everything. <br />
<br />
The truck loading the pony vanished, and standing there was a little boy, a few years younger than Emily, looking confused.<br />
&quot;Ewww, Mommy mouth taste like dirt.&quot; He whined.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Aaron baby I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She ran over and gave him a kiss. &quot;Go have whatever you want from the fridge okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yay candy!&quot; He laughed before running off.<br />
<br />
She glared at Emily, who had her head fall in shame.<br />
&quot;It was just for the party.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go to your room young lady. You can still come out and play and everything today since it&#39;s your birthday but tomorrow you&#39;re grounded. No changing the fabric of reality for a full week.&quot; She replied sternly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; She glumly replied before walking off.<br />
<br />
Rebecca watched as she walked off sadly, and she sighed to herself. God, what the hell was she gonna do about this kid.<br />
&quot;Oh boy, what&#39;d she do?&quot; A voice rang up behind her.<br />
<br />
Rebecca turned to see her husband, Greg, who walked up beside her, and wrapped his arm around his waist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing to important baby.&quot; She answered, meekly. She wanted to tell Greg but... she just couldn&#39;t. Just the idea of telling him there could have been a world where they weren&#39;t together broke her heart. Not to mention going &#39;hey, I used to be your 20 year old male neighbor that annoyed you&#39; probably wouldn&#39;t go over well.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need some... stress relief?&quot; He smirked, pinching Rebecca&#39;s fat butt cheek.<br />
<br />
She smiled back, then answered with a whisper. &quot;You know it big boy... but after dinner, k?&quot; She laughed. She brushed her curly red hair to the side, then made sure to strut inside, swaying her ass to purposely turn him on. That was another thing she loved about this day... the sex was always divine.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
It was a quiet evening, and Rebecca was sitting in a large auditorium. She was alone in the audience, as Greg was at work and Aaron was too young to be out this late. She was attending her 13 year old daughter&#39;s play of the Wizard of OZ. Of course, she only played one of the trees, but Rebecca was still so proud of her baby girl landing a role. Emily expressed her distaste, but her mother encouraged her.<br />
<br />
She was recording the scene with her phone, watching through the screen. At first, she couldn&#39;t be happier... that was, until she spotted her daughter. Initially, her girl seemed sad, her face hilariously poking out from a hole in the fake tree. But then, a smirk arose. That damned smirk that Rebecca knew too well, like when she made her dentist into a toothbrush or when she made her family into royalty so she could be a real princess.<br />
<br />
Rebecca tried to make eye contact with her daughter, but it was no use. She began to raise her hand, and Rebecca sprang up, causing eyes to gaze towards her.<br />
&quot;Emily don&#39;t you dare!&quot; She yelled, but Emily ignored her.<br />
<br />
FLASH<br />
<br />
Rebecca felt.... REALLY off. She stumbled slightly, then looked down. Her vision was all blurry. When she moved, the image almost felt delayed to reach her. She could tell a number of things though. SHe was young, way young. Her tits still looked great, but lost some of the size that child birth gave her. She was skinnier too, less thick. Her hair was still curly and red, but at the tips was a faded purple. She. also realized, quite to her embarrassment that A) She was standing on a table, B) She was wearing a cocktail dress but pulled down slightly so her boobs were showing, and C) She was surrounded by obviously drunk college students.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wooo!&quot; Some voices hollered. &quot;Yeah bitch!&quot; Others screamed. And she could even hear someone say &quot;Damn Becca you&#39;re such a slut!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O-oh shit.&quot; She muttered, hearing that she was slurring her words. She did her best to hop down from the table, and luckily a guy helped her down. &quot;You good babe?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
Rebecca looked up to see some generic bro dude staring at her. He kinda looked like another mother, so it was probably her transformed.<br />
&quot;Are you my boyfriend?&quot; She asked him with vile in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;U-uh... no? But if you, like, wanna b-&quot; He began before Rebecca shushed him.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-where the *hic* fuck is Emily?&quot; She asked. <br />
<br />
Rebecca remembered him pointing. She remembered finding someone, holding back hair as someone puked. She remembered taking a few more shots and laughing with some other girls... oh god, and fucking... someone, but luckily just butt stuff. She thunk. Then her memories fully faded.<br />
<br />
The next thing she knew, she was waking up in what looked like a dorm room. She was naked, only wearing her stilettos still stuck on her feet. She looked to the side and saw a cute, African American jock of a man. She recognized him as Lashonda... the chubby school librarian. &quot;Damn, you turned out hot.&quot; She thought before feeling a sharp pain on the side of her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, I haven&#39;t drank that hard since... forever.&quot; She muttered. <br />
<br />
Rebecca rolled out of bed, kicking off her shoes, then through on a way too big sports-themed robe that was obviously male, college Lashonda&#39;s and walked out into the main sitting room. Sprawled out on the crappy sofa was a half awake Emily, clearly at least 8 years older, wearing a dress and had a mouth outlined in vomit. She was moaning and holding her head until she saw Rebecca towering over her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn bitch. I see you finally got railed like Lance, nice.&quot; She laughed before wincing from a headache. &quot;Was it as nice as you hoped?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is WAY too inappropriate for you young lady.&quot; Rebecca seethed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about girl.... and please not too loud I&#39;ve got a wicked- OW!&quot; She yelled upon Rebecca flicking her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, what the hell is wrong wi- oh, ohhhh shit.&quot; She groaned, beginning to tear up. &quot;Mom. Crap Mom I am like SO sorry I just though college parties were cool fun I didn&#39;t think they got that... intense.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll talk about this later. I&#39;m gonna take a quick shower, then you are, and then we have work to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? I can&#39;t work now like, everything hurts.&quot; She whined.<br />
<br />
&quot;TO. BAD.&quot; Her mother practically growled. &quot;We are going to go around and change back every single person you transformed last night, and then once we&#39;re back maybe I&#39;ll CONSIDER letting you use your powers again, got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yes m&#39;am.&quot; She sighed, holding back tears.<br />
<br />
Rebecca wandered off, hoped into the shower, and began to deal with her own hangover. The two eventually reconciled. A week after fixing everything, Emily broke down in tears, genuine regretting all she&#39;d done. They both grew closer, and Rebecca told her the story of a man named Rick<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Emily stormed into her room with a thud. She held a small doll in her hand, looking it over. It was a baby doll with thoughtless plastic eyes, a big puffy diaper, and a cotton red dress. She chucked it haphazardly into her hamper and began to browse on her laptop. Rebecca knocked on the door, and walked into the doorway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey?&quot; She asked softly. &quot;Honey what are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What does it look like.&quot; She sneered. &quot;I&#39;m 15 I don&#39;t play with baby dolls, so I&#39;m selling it on Ebay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Baby, that&#39;s not a doll.&quot; She sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it is! It&#39;s all it is and all it deserves to be.&quot; She hissed, holding back tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Emily. You changed reality, so I can&#39;t remember... but whatever they actually are, we can talk about it.&quot; <br />
<br />
Emily was gonna snap back. Part of her felt the FLASH begin to emerge from her body. She thought about turning her mother into a poodle. A damn dog so she&#39;d never order her around again... but then the horribleness of the thought sunk in. She felt like a monster, and the truth about the doll hit her just as hard as tears welled to the surface.<br />
&quot;H-he dumped me!&quot; She wailed. &quot;And I deserve it!&quot; She cried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no no baby no you don&#39;t deserve it.&quot; Rebecca sighed, running in to hug her daughter. &quot;What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;H-he, *sniff* he broke up with me via text... a-and he started going out with Vanesa. MY fucking bff.... Ugh, ex-bff.&quot; She yelled with tears falling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey that&#39;s terrible. Nobody should ever be that awful, you have the right to be upset.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I don&#39;t have the right to just, change people... but I do. I mean fuck mom, I left my bully as a bra for years. Like, I threw her into the hamper and didn&#39;t look back... fuck, just like him I guess. I&#39;m a monster.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Rebecca replied sternly. &quot;You&#39;re no monster. A monster wouldn&#39;t have regrets, would they?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right baby. You have immense power, but as long as you choose to do the right thing in the end, you&#39;re no monster.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I don&#39;t exactly disagree with a punishment for this brat.&quot; She sneered, looking at the dolls fit which stuck out of the hamper. &quot;But maybe permanently leaving him like this is a bit hard.<br />
<br />
Emily laughed through the tears.<br />
&quot;Y-yeah, you&#39;re right... I actually uh, don&#39;t really feel like being... me, right now. I just want a break from bullshit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Rebecca thought, looking at the doll. &quot;You could be my baby again. Just for a few day!&quot; She quickly added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, you and babys.&quot; Emily smiled. &quot;Is that why you had a 3RD freakin kid?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well that and of course, because your father and I love each other in many wa-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;EWW, gross Mom!&quot; Emily laughed, finally feeling some of the sadness leave. &quot;Okay... why the hell not.&quot; She laughed before snapping her fingers.<br />
<br />
FLASH<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Rebecca felt her adorable daughter in her arms again. She babbled happily, and smiled at her mother.<br />
&quot;So, just me you, and you taking a break. No work, no worries, just tasty milk, fun toys and me giving you all the love.&quot; She said before giving her a big kiss. &quot;Oh, and, I don&#39;t want to waste money on disposable diapers... how about, a reusable one?&quot; She smirked, gesturing towards a doll that now sat at the top of a diaper pile.<br />
<br />
Emily giggled, then let the FLASH engulf the room once more. Now at the top of the pile sat a pink, washable diaper that made Rebecca chuckle. <br />
&quot;Great choice, I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be used quite a bit. Now, let&#39;s give you a bath in the sink aw I miss that so much.&quot; She squealed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gwbaba.&quot; Emily muttered with a sigh in her tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;What I just miss having babies so much you&#39;re all so cute and-&quot; Her voice faded off as they walked towards the kitchen, leaving the former man to sit as nothing but an object in the newly transformed nursery.</p>
