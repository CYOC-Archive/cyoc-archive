<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Janet gazed down into her husband&#39;s eyes.  His body was so large that his back muscles propped him up so that his head was hovering at Janet&#39;s waist.<br />
&quot;I have a few ideas...&quot; Janet replied coyly tickling the top of Matt&#39;s enormous left pec.<br />
Just then, Janet&#39;s phone began ringing.<br />
&quot;shit!&quot; Janet explained as she leaped over Matt&#39;s bulbous upper arm and dug her phone out of her scrubs pants she had left crumpled on the floor earlier.  She hurriedly answered it as she stepped into the hallway.<br />
Matt took the moment to survey what he could.  From his vantage point, all he saw were giant globes of rippling flesh.  He saw his two great pecs rising from his chin sticking straight up in the air.  Straining, he could make out the upper sweep of his mounded gut as it rose up and up before disappearing far below him.  The gut was made up of enormous abdominal muscles, each the size and similar shape of cinderblocks.  Glancing with his eyes to the left and right he saw the tops of his titanic biceps disappearing from view in either direction.  <br />
He couldn&#39;t believe his size, as he took it all in breathing heavily.<br />
Janet came back in after her phone call and surveyed the sight before her.  Matt was a series of huge spheres, each one pressing tightly into the one next to it, rising and falling with Matt&#39;s labored breathing.  A sheen of light sweat covered him from head to toe.  She laughed.<br />
&quot;what are you laughing at??&quot; Matt said from somewhere beyond the mountain of muscle laying on the broken bed.<br />
&quot;I just can&#39;t believe how ridiculous you look.  You&#39;re not even human.  Just a bunch of balled up muscles stuffed in skin.&quot; Janet giggled as she made her way back to Matt&#39;s head.<br />
&quot;That was work on the phone, babe,&quot; Janet said as she leaned on Matt&#39;s wrecking ball left shoulder, &quot;they need me to come back in.  I tried to get out of it, but I was lucky to get the time off to come quick and check on you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ummm, so what am I gonna do?  You can&#39;t leave me like this!&quot; Matt replied gesturing with his eyes downwards at his blown up body.<br />
&quot;Oh.  Yes I can.&quot; Janet replied with a smirk.  &quot;I&#39;m going to leave you just like this so I know where to find you when I&#39;m done with my shift.  Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s only a few hours!&quot; she giggled as she climbed up onto Matt&#39;s shoulder and strained to reach his salad plate-size nip and tweaked it once.  Matt shuddered with pleasure as he groaned.<br />
&quot;A few hours?!  What am I supposed to do in all that time?&quot; he said.<br />
&quot;Maybe try something different.  Surprise me!&quot; Janet said as she slipped back into her work scrubs and made for the door, throwing a top sheet over the tops of Matt&#39;s redwood thighs and footlong dick.  &quot;I can&#39;t wait to see what you come up with!&quot;<br />
And with that Janet was gone, leaving the monsterous form of her husband wriggling helplessly on the bed, buried under over 1000 pounds of muscles.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe she&#39;s leaving me here alone...&quot; Matt thought to himself as he lay there.  Then he grinned to himself.  &quot;I&#39;m gonna try and do something shocking to get her back, but first let&#39;s get down to a manageable size.&quot;<br />
Matt lay there and concentrated on a smaller form.  He couldn&#39;t believe how ridiculous he must look.  Then he felt it.  A familiar feeling of pressure being released.  He felt relief as his monster muscles shrank away from each other and didn&#39;t press quite so tightly together.  Slowly but surly, he lost pound after pound of the mammoth muscles.<br />
<br />
About 5 minutes later, he was still concentrating hard, but noticed that nothing was changing.  His body wasn&#39;t getting smaller.  He opened his eyes and looked down.  He was able to move his neck slightly, but as soon as he looked down, his stubbled chin jammed itself into the huge cleavage of his pecs.  He tried to sit up, but his arms were still severely limited in their movement.  Only able to move about a foot in all directions.  He wasn&#39;t able to sit up as his pecs, bulbous gut, and sewer pipe legs still fought for space.<br />
&quot;Dammit.&quot; Matt said aloud.  He laid there concentrating harder and harder, for another hour.  No matter what he did he couldn&#39;t get smaller.  Matt lay there thinking of what to do.  Then he remembered how his subconcious was influenced earlier that day by seeing Guy and Cray in their hugely muscled forms.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it!&quot; he said aloud.  &quot;I need some inspiration for what I should look like.  Then the problem presented itself.  There was no one here, and his phone might as well have been in China for all the good it did him on the nightstand just a couple feet away.  There was no way he could reach it to pull up a picture and look at it, or even to call someone for help.  That&#39;s when it hit him.  Siri.  He could ask the phone&#39;s virtual assistant to get someone over here to help him out with a body goal inspiration.<br />
<br />
He started to ask Siri to call Cray, his friend he had seen earlier that day, blown up to nearly immobility.  Then he stopped himself.  There was no telling what shape Cray, or even Guy for that matter, was in at this moment.  For all Matt knew, they were inflated to house-size proportions and would do nothing to help him get smaller.  Then it clicked.  His little brother, Nate!  &#39;Little&#39; being the operative word.  Nate was a a few years younger than Matt, but about 3 inches taller and 50 pounds heavier.  Or at least he was before Matt had been blown up to balloon animal proportions by his wife.  Nate was a competitive bodybuilder and quite large at about 250 pounds in-season.  He was in the heavyweight division of every competition he signed up for.  He would be the perfect inspiration to help Matt shrink down to a relatively normal size.<br />
&quot;Siri,&quot;  Matt said and listened for the chime that told him she was listening. &quot;Call Little Bro, speaker phone.&quot;<br />
&quot;Calling Little Bro.&quot; Siri replied.  The phone rang three times before he heard the other end pick up.<br />
&quot;Yo, Matty!  What&#39;s up?&quot; Nate said on the other line.<br />
&quot;Nate!  I need your help with something.  Can you swing by the house quick?  It&#39;s urgent.&quot;<br />
&quot;Is everything ok?  I was just about to head out to the gym.&quot; Nate responded<br />
&quot;Um, yes.  It&#39;s all good, if you wouldn&#39;t mind, just swing by on your way to the gym.  You can let yourself in.  I&#39;m in the bedroom.&quot;<br />
&quot;Uhh, ok, bro.  You&#39;re lucky your house is on the way to the gym.&quot; Nate responded with a chuckle.  They hung up.  Matt knew Nate lived only a couple miles away, and wouldn&#39;t be waiting long.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, about 10 minutes later, Matt heard the front door open and close, and Nate calling up the stairs as he made his way up,<br />
&quot;This better be good, man.  I already took my preworkout and it&#39;s gonna start hitting soon,&quot; Nate said as he walked heavily up the steps, &quot;alright, I&#39;m here.  What do you need my help with, Big br......big...big...&quot;<br />
Nate stuttered as he stepped through the bedroom door.  He was wearing an oversize t-shirt, which for him was a XXL, and shorty short lifting shorts.  The kind with the built-in liner underneath.  The shorts clung to his defined quads and fit snugly over his bubble butt.  His calves were sweeping balls of muscle being wrapped tightly at their base by white Nike crew socks that went down into white Converse sneakers.  His shirt draped over his meaty pecs and showed off his wide shoulders and trapezoids.  The base of his large biceps were just visable under the hem of the sleeve.  His brown hair cut in a fade was hidden under a backwards ballcap.<br />
Nate was nothing to compare with the monstrosity laying in front of him.  From his angle as he turned into the bedroom, all he saw was two relatively small feet, attached to great orbs of muscle, that fell down to tiny-looking knees, before blowing up immensely into pipe-like quads.  But that was nothing compared to the swell of the biggest roidgut Nate had ever seen in all his years of bodybuilding.  It inflated up into a 6-foot tall mound covered with huge abdominals.  Sticking out on either end were huge biceps and forearms.  The shape wriggled slightly, and he heard his brother&#39;s voice.<br />
&quot;Nate... don&#39;t freak out.  I can explain.  Can you come around the side of the bed so I can see you?  Please?&quot;<br />
&#39;WHAT.  THE.  HELL.  DUDE.&quot; was all Nate could say as he circumnavigated the wriggling pile of muscle on the broken bed and came to Matt&#39;s head.  &quot;How did this happen to you??  Is it allergies or something?  Did you take some illegal roids???&quot;<br />
Nate reached up and squeezed at Matt&#39;s biceps, pecs, and traps.  <br />
&quot;I can explain everything.  Just promise not to interrupt.&quot; Matt replied as Nate continued to squeeze the huge muscles.  &quot;Oh, and before I do explain, can you help prop me up a bit?&quot;<br />
&quot;Uhh, I guess I can try.  You&#39;re pretty big, dude.  You probably weigh at least a half ton...&quot; Nate said.<br />
&quot;Just see if we can get me spun so my head is at the headboard and I can lean back on that and the wall.&quot; Matt replied.<br />
<br />
So with a great amount of effort, Nate grabbed Matt round one armpit and heaved and dragged Matt around so he was laying on the bed the correct way, with Matt wriggling and squirming as best he could flexing his enormously worthless muscles with effort.  Nate worked up quite a sweat in the meantime, and stripped his baggy shirt, revealing a handsome six pack and defined pecs and obliques as he pushed and pulled his pincushion brother into a reclined position.  In the end, Matt was leaning his upper back and neck against the wall and headboard as his stubbled chin rested in his pec cleavage and his gut pushed up against his pecs and down on his huge quads laying somewhere out of view below.<br />
Nate stepped back, putting his hands on his bare waist at the waistband of his shorts and panted as he looked up at the massive form of his brother.  Nate wiped his mouth with his rippling forearm as he surveyed his equally heavy-breathing brother.<br />
Unbeknownst to him and Matt, as he wiped his mouth of the sweat accumulated there from the strain of moving such a large person, he inadvertently ingested some of Matt&#39;s sweat as well.  Sweat that was laden with the mysterious ointment that was force-fed to him at Cray&#39;s house.  It quickly made it&#39;s way through Nate&#39;s system and settled into its new host...<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, big bro.  Let&#39;s have the story.  This is insane&quot; Nate panted.<br />
<br />
Matt proceeded to tell the whole tale from going to Cray&#39;s house and discovering the two men in outrageous proportions, to being forced the odd medication, to blowing up to immoveable size, to waddling home in a panic, to Janet discovering him and realizing her subconscious could also control his body size, and her blowing him up into the biggest freak there was.<br />
Nate nodded along as he surveyed his brothers heaving muscles, occasionally reaching out and touching or squeezing this quad ripple here, or that bicep vein there.  He was in disbelief.  Matt finished the tale and came to the present,<br />
&quot;So the reason  I called you here is that I realized that having someone to look at helps my subconscious focus on a form I want.  Clearly I want to be extremely large deep down, and it&#39;s hard to shrink back once I&#39;m this size.&quot; Matt said as he gestured best he could.  &quot;Obviously, I needed someone that was still very large but also someone I can trust.  And here you are.&quot;<br />
&quot;This is nuts,&quot; Nate said, &quot;so all you need to do is look at me and you&#39;ll be my size in a bit?&quot;<br />
&quot;Hopefully, that&#39;s what happens.&quot; Matt shrugged his giant shoulders.<br />
&quot;Alright.  Let&#39;s go for it.&quot; Nate&#39;s curiosity had gotten the better of him, he wanted to see this work.  He couldn&#39;t help but feel a little jealous of his monsterous brother, though.  He definitely didn&#39;t want to be blown up like some muscled balloon animal with a giant ball gut, but he could go with more size.  Especially if it didn&#39;t require any effort.<br />
&quot;What do you need me to do?&quot; Nate asked.<br />
&quot;Just, um, stand there where I can see you.&quot; Matt responded.<br />
<br />
Matt focused on Nate&#39;s muscled 250 pound frame and concentrated.  A couple minutes ticked by as Nate watched incredulously.  Then he saw it.  Matt was shrinking.  The muscles withdrawing on themselves as he took on a more human-looking form.  Little by little, Matt dwindled down to a much more reasonable size.  Thankfully, the bedsheet stayed on and kept Matt decent in front of his brother.  Matt continued his deflating until he reached about 300 pounds.  He had all the size and shape of his little brother, but had kept a respectable rounded muscle gut.  Matt blinked and looked down and sighed with relief.  He gathered the sheet around him and waddled over to the dresser, pulling on a pair of boxers, snugly fitting over his bubbled frame.<br />
&quot;There, that&#39;s more like it.  You can put your shirt back on now, Nate, this worked perfectly,&quot; Matt said with his back turned still, pulling up the boxers.<br />
Nate stood there mouth hanging open, as he pulled on the shirt.  All this time, watching his brother shrink to a size to rival his own, had got his mind reeling.  Wondering what it would be like to be bigger.  Much bigger.  Not with the inhuman shape of Matt&#39;s bubbled muscles, but with real, proportional, and aesthetically pleasing muscles.  He thought how amazing it would be to be a similar shape he was now, but bigger.  And taller.  All while being proportional.<br />
The ointment made its properties clear once again as it began working it&#39;s way to Nate&#39;s muscled frame and pumped him slowly and surely larger.<br />
&quot;Maybe I&#39;ll hit the gym with you and try out this new bod...&quot; Matt said as he turned his large frame around and flexed his biceps.  He stopped short when he looked at his brother.  He gaped at him.  Nate was already six inches taller and swelling bigger in all directions.  He clearly hadn&#39;t noticed yet.<br />
&quot;WHAT THE FUCK.&quot; Matt yelled as he stared at his brother.  Nate shook himself and looked down at his older brother.  <br />
&quot;What?&quot; Nate said stupidly.<br />
&quot;Look at yourself!!&quot; Matt responded in awe.<br />
Nate looked down and his eyes widened.  All he saw were pecs.  He noticed right at that moment that his baggy shirt was no longer that.  It was snugly taut over his rising and falling chest, the sleeves completely filled and creeping upwards.  He felt the AC hit his lower abs as the shirt pulled higher.  His shorts were getting tight, despite their stretchiness.  He looked up and then down again, realizing his height was increasing.  He had walked into that bedroom at a respectable 5&#39;11&quot; but was now towering at a height of 6&#39;7&quot; and he was still growing.  He was definitely not a bean pole.  His muscles kept pace and he looked proportionally bigger than he had at 250 pounds.  His arms were significantly larger in circumference, as were his quads.  His butt had blown out much larger than before and his traps were pushing his arms higher and higher.<br />
&quot;What the hell?!&quot; Nate exclaimed, looking down with excitement at his growing body, &quot;how is this happening?&quot; <br />
Just then, the brothers heard seams popping on the shirt and shorts, as the shirt began splitting down the side seams.  Nate ripped it off to reveal an enormous torso, swelling and heaving with rippling muscle.  By this point he had reached 7&#39;6&quot; tall and was still growing.  His head inching closer to the ten foot ceilings.  His stretchy shorts clung for dear life, loudly snapping threads.<br />
Matt thought about it watching his brother swelling before him.  He stood there gaping in his tight boxers and his round gut sticking out pondering.  As Nate reached 8&#39;5&quot; he came to the conclusion that it was transferred by touching or bodily fluid like sweat and said as much to the still inflating Nate.  <br />
&quot;uggggh!&quot; Nate groaned as he felt his feet outgrowing the converse shoes, and heard a loud ripping sound as they burst out of them, with his socks clinging to his giant feet.<br />
&quot;When is it gonna stop??&quot; Nate said peering over his pecs down at his average 5&#39;9&quot; older brother below him.<br />
&quot;When your subconscious gets what it wants!&quot; Matt called up to him.  Matt then felt that familiar creeping in his skin as his own subconscious responded to the mammoth man before him.  He had not ever considered a height change, and felt his own bones stretching him to a higher height as his muscles pumped jucier and jucier.  He closed his eyes and turned trying to focus, and feeling his own growth subsiding as he controlled it.  He heard a &#39;POP!&#39; and heard Nate say,<br />
&quot;dammit, my drawstring!  It popped off.&quot;  Then there was a ripping sound as the outer shorts part of the lined material began tearing off and the waistband reached its limit and tore just at the crotch.   Matt turned and saw the shorts were little more than a thong at this point, given Nate&#39;s mammoth size.  The liner from inside the shorts had ridden up his now compact-car sized quads and was stretched so far, it was puckered and malformed over the tongues of his quads.<br />
&quot;Ouch!&quot; Nate called out as his head bumped into the 10 foot ceilings.  Nate crouched a bit as best he could as he continued to feel pound after pound pumped into him.  But it wasn&#39;t for long.  He reached a staggering 10&#39;3&quot; tall and his muscles matched every inch of that size.  The floors creaked loudly as Nate lowered himself as best he could into a sitting position.  His abs and arms rippled and bounced with every movement as his quads formed and unformed with his flexing.<br />
&quot;Wow.  I had no idea this was possible.&quot; Matt said staring up at the heaving gigantic form of his &#39;little&#39; brother.  &quot;It gives me an idea, though...&quot;</p>
