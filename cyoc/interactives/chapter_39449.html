<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Melissa woke up with something warm and fuzzy pressed tightly against her she was alarmed, until she remembered the events of the previous evening. Once she had scratched Jessica behind the ears the girl-turned-jaguar-man had been all over her, rubbing his head against her and trying to sit on her lap to snuggle against her like an over sized house cat. From there Jessica had not wanted her to leave and practically begged her to spend the night. Once she agreed Jessica gave her a crushing hug. The next thing she knew, she was sitting on Jessica's bed with her friend laying across her lap, lifting his shirt and begging for a belly rub.<br />
<br />
None of it had been in any way sexual for Jessica, even when he removed his shirt and, now useless, bra to give Melissa better access to the fur of his stomach and chest, he just wanted to be cuddled, not to mention Jessica had no clue that he was no longer a she.<br />
<br />
After that she must have fallen asleep on Jessica's bed, which explained her current situation.<br />
<br />
Next to her Jessica sighed deeply and snuggled more tightly against her. In return Melissa reached around and petted the fur on her friend's shoulder, all the while wondering what else she could do with the Chronivac. Maybe the next changes she made would be to herself. Jessica certainly seemed happy, if ignorant of the changes, since being changed and Melissa was starting to wonder if she was missing out on something. Anyway, she could always change herself back if she didn't like the results.<br />
<br />
That settled it, she was going to give it a try. Giving Jessica one last pat she slipped out of bed and went over to the computer to decide what to do to herself. Her first thought was to just make herself more attractive, but looking back at Jessica, she decided that such a change would be too mundane for her first experiment on herself. Looking at Jessica and thinking about how happy he seemed gave her an idea.<br />
<br />
Melissa decided to do something similar to herself, only a lot more mild and without the mental changes. She selected the animal option to make herself ten percent tiger, then selected the gender option to make herself ten percent male, since she was curious how percentages would work with gender change. She kept her own awareness of the changes, but set it for reality to adjust. The changes themselves would be instantaneous and last until she undid them.<br />
<br />
One click and it was done.<br />
<br />
The changes were so slight that it was hard for her to notice at first, the only really obvious thing was that her hair had changed to orange with black stripes. To get a better look she got up and went to examine herself in the mirror. Her eyes had become a deep green, which she liked and her lips had puffed out a little, short thin whiskers sprouting from them and the smallest hint on a split under her nose. When she smiled she saw that her teeth were a little larger and sharper. Running her tongue over them further confirmed this, as well as revealing that her tongue had become slightly rough, like a cat's tongue. There was a light dusting of fur along her cheeks and chin, hardly noticeable at all.<br />
<br />
Her nails had grown longer and thicker, curving slightly, but they weren't retractable claws. On the palms of her hands there were areas where her skin felt tougher, like the start of paw pads.<br />
<br />
Lifting her shirt showed that her shoulders were slightly wider and she had better muscle tone. Her breasts had shrunk slightly and like on her face, there was a light barely there, dusting of fur on them. This fur got slightly thicker going down her stomach, a little trail of white fur going down to where it was hidden by her pants. To see what else had changed she pulled down her pants and saw that the hair around her womanly parts had turned soft and white. As for her feminine anatomy, maybe it seemed slightly larger, but other than that it was unchanged, which she realized was to be expected since she was only ten percent male. She also had a short tail, only six inches long and covered with soft, downy fur.<br />
<br />
She turned in front of the mirror to see herself from all angles and decided that her hips were slightly more narrow, other than that she didn't look all that different. Maybe her body hair was slightly thicker and more abundant, but there was still so little of it that it was hard to see that it was black and orange.<br />
<br />
Going back to the computer she set both changes up to fifteen percent and applied them.<br />
<br />
This time she was more pleased with what she saw. Her breasts had become considerable smaller and aside from their presence her figure resembled that of a teenage boy with fairly well defined muscles. More importantly her body hair had become plentiful enough that her stripes were faintly visible. <br />
<br />
Her tail had grown to two feet and it waved lazily through the air as she turned in front of the mirror to admire herself.<br />
<br />
Nestled amidst soft white fur, her womanly parts were defiantly more noticeable, but with all of the other changes, her attention did not linger there.<br />
<br />
Her ears had moved slightly higher on her head and the fur along her cheeks was much thicker. In addition, her lips had puffed out further and developed a noticeable split. When she bared her teeth they looked much more like fangs and she thought her nose looked a little wider and flatter.<br />
<br />
At the tips of her fingers she now had proper claws, though they only retracted about half way, leaving half an inch of sharp, curved nail visible. On her palms she had thick, dark paw pads. Looking down at her feet she saw that they had changed just as much and that she was starting to stand on her toes somewhat.<br />
<br />
Satisfied that this was enough she exited the program just as Jessica was getting up.<br />
<br />
Yawning, showing large fangs, Jessica stretched in a very cat like manner, kneading his claws in the blankets, rolled over to scratch absentmindedly at the fur on his belly and slid out of bed.<br />
<br />
Melissa blushed slightly, though it was mostly hidden by her fur, when she realized that Jessica was naked. To think that she had spent all night curled up with a naked jaguar man. Of course there was no risk of anything happening since Jessica didn't know that he was male, but still the thought was something else.<br />
<br />
He padded over to her and wrapped his arms around her from behind, resting his head on her shoulder he growled softly in her ear &quot;Have a good night's sleep?&quot;<br />
<br />
Between the fact he was walking on his toes and the height his change to a male had added to him, Melissa realized that Jessica now stood a good eight inches taller than her.<br />
<br />
Her eyes went wide at the feel of her friend's masculine anatomy pressing gently against her back, but she reminded herself that Jessica still thought he was a girl and he would never do anything to her, he just wanted to cuddle. That didn't stop it from being very weird, but it made her feel better, besides, she was the one who had made it so that Jessica would act that way.<br />
<br />
&quot;I slept fine,&quot; she replied, noticing that her voice had become slightly deeper with a pronounced feline growl, though no where near what Jessica's was like.<br />
<br />
He rubbed his head against her cheek, his long whiskers tickling her face &quot;That's good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa nodded slowly and scratched him behind the ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;That feels so good,&quot; he rasped, leaning heavily against her, &quot;Please don't stop.&quot;<br />
<br />
After a moment of thinking he amended, &quot;Or you do stop, let it be to rub my back or belly. I don't know why, but until yesterday I never realized how good it felt just to be petted and snuggle. Is that weird?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all,&quot; Melissa giggled.<br />
<br />
He nodded and sighed contentedly, &quot;I was just thinking, want to try using the Chronivac to change ourselves a little?&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa was shocked at the question, but delighted to have another excuse to play around a bit more, &quot;Sure, who goes first?</p>
