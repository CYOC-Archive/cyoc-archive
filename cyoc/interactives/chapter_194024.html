<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Out of the corner of her eye Molly spied her little sister Hanna, mobile out standing right at the entrance to the kitchen videoing the scene.  Too late to stop now, Molly finished what she had started.<br />
<br />
“Is my baby boy ready to behave?”<br />
<br />
The spanking took all the fight out of poor little Jasper.  <br />
<br />
Molly could see she had made her point and once again, lifted her infantile husband and cradled him onto her lap, careful to not let him her sister.  <br />
<br />
Hanna kept quiet, standing there for a moments as Jasper peacefully accepted the spoons full of baby food with little fuss.  Then she moved about to capture the all she could on video.<br />
<br />
Molly glared disapprovingly at her younger sister.<br />
<br />
The teen was unfazed by her older sister’s attitude and once it seemed clear that the second then third jar of baby food were exhausted, Hanna made herself scarce.<br />
<br />
Molly cleaned up the table and her baby’s messy face.  Tears formed in little Jasper’s eyes.<br />
<br />
Jasper was still uncomfortable.  He was put in his place and no longer felt so happy about playing a baby.  It was still nice to be held and comforted, but now he just felt helpless and controlled.  The spanking took a lot out of him and he just wanted all this to end.  He had lots of happy moments and that could be enough for now.<br />
<br />
Molly looked into Jasper’s face and noticed his look of exhaustion.  She had forgotten how easily a little one could be ready to sleep.  She could use some rest as well and now that Hanna was here, Molly thought, maybe she could shower and take a little nap.<br />
<br />
Jasper’s mind drifted and he tried to focus on the nice parts of this.  Like now, there was warmth he felt, it was spreading all around his bottom.  That was one of the perks of being …. of being…. of being ….his thoughts were becoming unfocused and soon he realized he was just thinking of colors and shapes.  He was smacking his lips.  He missed something.  He wanted something, but could figure it out.  He heard his mommy’s voice, but didn’t understand what she was saying.  It sounded warm and soothing.<br />
<br />
Molly looked at her baby husband, he didn’t look like he had the moment under control.  He was moving his lips around, she knew what that meant, he wanted something in his mouth.  Well, maybe it is time for him to be put down again.<br />
<br />
“Come baby, let mommy take care of you” Molly had him under her thumb now.  She sat on the couch made herself comfortable and exposing her breast, positioned Jasper to once again to nurse.<br />
<br />
Hanna was not far behind and quietly sat across from the two and recorded this intimate moment.<br />
<br />
Jasper, latched on immediately and a blissful feeling took over, he closed his eyes and surrendered to the moment.<br />
<br />
The two sisters looked at each other and just smiled, each wanting to just laugh.<br />
<br />
“Well Jasper, baby, don’t you just love nursing from mommy? Yes you do, yes you do.” <br />
<br />
Hanna understood immediately that he must have been nursing for much of the weekend.  <br />
<br />
“Mommy’s little baby is having a lot of fun toddling around holding mommy’s hand so he can walk.  I think you started to forget how to walk and are just a crawling little baby now.  But that’s okay mommy knows it can be hard to walk.”<br />
<br />
Molly stroked Jaspers head and then patted his bottom.<br />
<br />
Hanna was having fun with this secret communication.  She had a look she gave her sister begging for more.<br />
<br />
“It’s hard for a baby to grow up, but mommy’s are here to help.  Maybe some day, you can be ready to potty train.”<br />
<br />
Hanna’s jaw dropped with that revelation. <br />
<br />
Molly mouthed and in an almost whisper said “he’s wet…in his diaper”<br />
<br />
Hanna did all she could to contain herself.  She loved to tease Jasper, and this would be grist for the mill….. for…. for.. forever.  He is swaddled and diapered and he is nursing in a wet diaper.  She wondered if he wet it while he was nursing.  Did he know he wet it? did he do it intentionally? Did he know his diaper was wet now?<br />
<br />
Jasper was so at peace, he didn’t even stir as he heard voices around him.  He knew the voices were familiar, that one was his mommy, but he couldn’t focus enough to know what was being said.  Nursing was his whole world.  All was right with that world, his troubled mind was back as ease.<br />
<br />
Molly refrained from mentioning that Jasper had previously shit himself each time he had nursed.  She figured it would be much more dramatic when he actually did it again now.  But that moment didn’t come.<br />
<br />
Soon Jasper had finished nursing. <br />
<br />
Molly once again burped her infant husband.  After his meal, this time he spit up a much more.  Once again, he fell into a heavy slumber.<br />
<br />
Hanna stepped over to her sister.  “Why don’t you take a moment for yourself, I’ll put him down for his nap.”  Hanna had to giggle and she said it.  She took Jasper and held him and rocked him and Molly stood there not sure if this made sense.<br />
<br />
“Go!” Hanna insisted.<br />
<br />
Molly was hesitant, but she was tired and needed to shower and take a nap herself.<br />
<br />
“Shower, and if you are asleep, I can take Tess to her Birthday party.”<br />
<br />
Molly wasn’t even thinking about that.  It was this afternoon.  “I really should do that.” <br />
<br />
“Nonsense.”  Hanna replied.<br />
<br />
No soon had Hanna said that then Jasper made his presence known.<br />
<br />
Hanna had been holding her brother in law’s swaddled body upright against her own, with one hand resting on his back while the other lifting him on his bottom.<br />
<br />
Hanna felt it as both she and her sister heard the crackling sound of the little guys tiny farts.  Hanna had a look of surprise which is just what Molly expected as she looked over at her sister. <br />
<br />
The two sisters continued to gaze at each other realizing what was happening.<br />
<br />
Hanna felt the babe in her arms body contract a bit as she felt the solid mass of poo extrude onto where her hand rested on his bottom.  Try as she did she couldn’t suppress her giggle and Molly joined in.  The two sisters gave a hushed bust of a giggles as they couldn’t help but be amused at Jasper’s expense as the still sleeping infantilized man shit his diaper in the arms of his sister-in-law.<br />
<br />
After a long moment, Jasper had finished taking his dump.  He hadn’t even roused himself to notice.<br />
<br />
The odor was pungent to say the least.  More like an adult then like an infant.  Soon Molly and Hanna had started walking around the room.  It was more to escape the stench Jasper was emitting than to keep their little baby sleeping. <br />
<br />
“Should I change him?” Hanna timidly asked<br />
<br />
The two sisters again nearly laughed out loud.  <br />
<br />
The very thought of Hanna changing Jasper’s diaper was much to amusing to each.  After all, Jasper had been part of Molly’s life long enough that if he weren’t a boy, he might have changed Hanna’s diapers when they were younger.<br />
<br />
Let sleeping babies lie.</p>
