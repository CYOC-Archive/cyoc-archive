<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I rapped my knuckles on the door. &quot;Si--Trish?  You okay in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Silence.  &quot;Trish?&quot; I rattled the doorknob &quot;Everything okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
I could hear plastic bags rustling, not with my magical hearing, but because my ear was pressed to the door by then.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sis?  Do you need help?  Should I call 911?&quot;<br />
<br />
I bit my lip, wondering what a bunch of cops and paramedics would make of the lacy red bra. For a moment I was filled with anger, literally seeing red &amp; ready to pull the knob out of the door and tear it to pieces!  Instead I stumbled as Trish opened the door I'd been pressed against and I fell into the room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoop!&quot; she yelled and lunged to catch me as I fell. I tried to get one hand on the door frame and the other around her but lost my footing entirely. Trish had grabbed my neck and as my feet slipped out from under me my face pressed into her cleavage before my weight knocked us both down.<br />
<br />
All I could see was green. Kelly green, one of Trish's favorite colors. One arm was trapped underneath us, but I managed to raise myself up using the other. I was lying on top of Trish, who had apparently pulled on a polo while I was thinking about firemen hitting on her.  <br />
<br />
Her arms were still around my neck and my face had wound up pressed between her tits once we landed. Her nipples were still erect, and the thin summer shirt clearly wasn't covering a bra of any kind. I looked up at her face. She was biting her lip and was blushing intensely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeez Tish I--&quot; I stopped apologizing as she burst out laughing. Not a gentle tee-hee-hee, but deep belly-wrenching laughs that left her gasping for air. I tried to be angry about her laughing at me, but I was so happy to see her in a good mood that I found myself joining in.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later we were spent and sucking in desperately needed air. I started to get up and Trish tightened her grip, pulling my head down onto her chest.  Her boobs had kind of slipped off to either side, so it wasn't as sexual as it probably sounds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus Joey! are you ever gonna stop being clumsy?&quot; Trish petted my hair idly and I found myself hoping she'd continue for a long while.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know, maybe when I stop growing.&quot;  I felt her tense up at once and she stopped petting me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; She said flatly. &quot;Here's to hoping our bodies settle down soon.&quot;  She patted me on the back brusquely.  &quot;Okay, up now!&quot;<br />
<br />
I stayed where I was and turned to set my chin on her sternum. &quot;Why?&quot; I said, my opening jaw making my head rock back. &quot;You're real comfortable to land on!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because,&quot; she said, trying to lever me off. &quot;You weigh a ton and I'm getting squished.&quot; She stopped trying to shift me and instead began tickling me under my ribs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; I shouted and pulled back, raising myself onto all fours then to a kneeling position.  Trish had sat up and continued to tickle me so I grabbed her wrists and held her hands away. Her hair had fallen partly over her face, and her boobs were making her shirt rock back and forth as she struggled.<br />
<br />
I worked and finally got both her wrists into one hand. &quot;Ha ha! Revenge is mine!&quot; I reached over and slipped my hand under the trailing edge of her shirt where I could get at the sensitive skin around her bully button.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joey, hey! Joey-hee-hee-hee!&quot; Trish convulsed with laughter as I mercilessly tickled her.  Eventually she managed to get her legs under her and we both struggled to our feet.  I pulled Trish's arms over her head and her shirt raised up as well, baring a few inches of pale skin.  I leaned forward and blew a loud raspberry on her belly. <br />
<br />
She shrieked and I let go of her wrists.  I expected her to either try to tickle me again or to move back out of range.  Instead she grabbed my face in both hands and pulled me up for a kiss. <br />
<br />
I was so startled that she caught me with my mouth open, and the next thing I knew her tongue was rubbing against the roof of my mouth and Trish was moaning loudly.  I wrapped my arms around her and savored the feeling of her body pressed up against mine. Trish was making soft mewling noises as she worked her tongue.  Finally we came up for air and she flipped her hair back over her shoulder.<br />
<br />
I was a bit taller than her and we looked wonderingly at each other. I smiled slightly and hugged her closer.  Trish tucked her head against my chest and whispered softly 'Thank you.'.<br />
<br />
I began to say something but she shushed me and pulled herself tighter against me.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know if it's these boobs, or if they're a result of the hormones, but I've been so flipping turned-on the last couple months I haven't let anyone close 'cause I wasn't sure I'd be able to stop myself if things got going.&quot;  She swallowed loudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn't help that my little brother isn't so little any more, and does his workouts in nothing but boxers.&quot; I must have made some noise, because she looked up at me then. &quot;I'd sneak downstairs and ease the door open a crack so I could watch you sweat.  You're a heck of a stud Joey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-- I'd hear guys saying things about you, and I'd get so angry that they--&quot; I paused to take a deep breath &quot;that they had a chance to be with you, but I couldn't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Joey, I wish we could be together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish we could too.&quot;</p>
