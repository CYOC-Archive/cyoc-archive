<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Janet took a pen in her hand and started to write:<br />
<br />
&quot;Dave never interrupts me when I write.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave looked at the paper. He shuddered. Somehow he knew that what he did is not going to turn out good for him in the end. Especially now, after he became unable to interrupt what Janet was doing with the pen.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the change to be unpleasant for me, just as Dave wanted, I wish I became a man in looks and behavior by switching bodies with Dave.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh no! Dave was devastated. Yes, he wanted Janet to not to like the change but he thought that would involve him doing nasty things to her, not the other way around! He swore quietly as he saw Janet writing more. What he didn't know was how much worse his situation was going to get as Janet took the paper on side and stared to scribble more...<br />
<br />
&quot;To make it most perverted though,&quot; Janet wrote &quot;I wish that because of the slightly different evolutionary path human species have followed, the difference between males and females would be much, much more pronounced than it is now now and match the following description:&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Human pregnancy is extremely hard to achieve thus it is balanced by women having multiple children in each pregnancy. To make this possible female physiology differs quite prominently from the one before the wish. Extremely high levels of estrogen have a profound impact on both females' looks and behavior.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First of all, the average height for women is now to be 4'10'' with some rare cases reaching 5'2''. They are also much weaker and fragile even when compared to pre-wish women of the same size. Their whole body is skinny, soft and petite but with some exceptions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In order to make a delivery of few children at once possible female pelvis needs to be bigger than its pre-wish equivalent. A current average waist-to-hips ratio of 0.7 after the wish becomes 0.55 . With their hips almost twice as wide as their waists women basically can't make any major move without twisting their bottoms in ways considered now to be sexy and seductive. Wider hips also mean greater leg separation which would result in female reproductive organs being exposed thus prone to injuries. To avoid that Mother Nature gifted them witch much thicker thighs and therefore more pronounced buttocks (which add to the increased pelvis size).&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The breasts, now needed to feed many children at the same time rather than just one, are to consist now mainly of the milk-producing tissue rather than fat like in those of the pre-wish women. This makes them more dense and therefore heavier than pre-wish equivalent of the same size. Milk tissue's firm consistency, however, prevents them from sagging while maintaining (and even increasing) their softness. If the breasts were to be proportionate to the body size in a pre-wish way, even with the milk tissue amount increased they simply wouldn't be able to provide enough milk for numerous human offspring. That's why after the wish the average breast size for a 4'10'' woman would be what an average size for a current 5'8'' woman was before the wish - a C-cup, and tending to get bigger. Also, their nipples are unproportionally enlarged measuring on average one inch long and across. The increased amount of milk tissue present makes spontaneous lactation quite common, with almost 65% of women lactating permanently.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Female reproductive organs also differ from the ones most of the pre-wish people are used to. The most prominent difference is in their size. To accommodate more babies women uterus needed to be more stretchy but also generally bigger in size. Evolution achieved this by enlarging the whole female reproductive system all together, therefore filling the unused space in the much bigger pelvis. The organs are generally twice as big as the pre-wish ones, meaning that for example vagina's average depth goes up form 5in to 10in when not aroused.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In addition to that and other physical changes caused by the elevated estrogen levels (like the lack of body hair in places other than head, or simply finer complexion) there's also a couple of mental/behavioral differences that need to be described. Because of the unlikeness of getting pregnant the Mother Nature had to tweak women desire to become pregnant. This was achieved by making two major psychological changes: increasing maternal instincts and increasing sex drive. When women don't have children (majority of them) their maternal instincts usually are satisfied by a woman excessively caring about the others which combined with the increased libido makes them extremely docile and submissive towards men. Women intrinsically want to take care of their households and men, therefore female emancipation never happened (because they simply had no interest in the ideas of feminism).&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even though females are used to their body shapes, they do tend to feel very uncomfortable and physically limited because of the contrast of their tiny frames with their disproportional (as for pre-wish conditions) sexual characteristics. However, there's absolutely no desire among women to interact surgically or otherwise with their female attributes as their instincts make them accept their roles willingly. Even if that means they have to suffer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Men had to adapt to the change in the way humans reproduce as well, only for them the changes went in opposite direction. The elevated level of testosterone was supposed to increase their sex drive in order to make rare conceptions more likely to happen. This succeed in a way but also introduced a range of other changes. The average height went up from 5'10'' to 6'4'' and overall physical fitness also improved dramatically even for the specimen who never particularly exercised. Women being so fragile and weak needed more capable men to provide them with food, various supplies and protection for their numerous offspring (if they were lucky enough to have any). In the times before technology this meant a lot of hard physical work where muscles happened to be very useful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Men also had to adapt to the changes in female reproductive organs. Deeper vagina needed longer member to be penetrated properly, so male penises grew to the adequate length and width (oscillating around 11 inches when erect). Also the amount of semen produced changed. More sperms mean greater chance of getting woman pregnant so the production of semen increased fourfold. In order to supply this amount, male testicles increased adequately, proportionally to the growth in penis size.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mental changes in men were a side effect of the testosterone increase. Increased aggressiveness and a need for dominance were the main ones. This, however, could easily lead to unending wars between bloodthirsty men so evolution found another way - it channeled both of those instincts to be purely sexual in nature therefore changing only interactions with women. Females were too valuable to hurt them though, so the aggressiveness resulted in humiliating and lowering them rather than assaulting physically. In the end this sort of behavior became rewarding and enjoyable for women (again, evolution in action).&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When the changes to the world are done, I want for the two people present here, in the room where the wish was written down, to keep their own minds and memories and to remain mentally unchanged. Nevertheless, I wish their bodies' behavior to exactly match the description I made, which will result often in them being helpless but to watch what their body is doing against their will.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Dave could see pain on Janet's face as she was writing more and more of the sick stuff from the depths of her mind. Suddenly she stopped, raised the piece of paper she was writing on and shown it to him. He felt worse and worse as he was reading through. He definitely didn't want to spend the rest of his life like this! It was to late for complains though as Dave and Janet felt some tinging spreading through their bodies...</p>
