<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A quiet groan slips from Kairos’ mouth as he returns to the waking world. His blue eyes flutter open, disoriented gaze coming upon a dark sky, the only form of light provided by the largest full moon he had ever beared witness to. Lifting a hand in front of his face, the young warrior grimaces at his shaking hand, unable to still it&#39;s movement.<br />
<br />
Trying to ignore the cold, his gaze shifts to the many trees around him, coming to the simple conclusion that he was still in the woods. Attempting to lift his head from the ground results in nausea overtaking him, forcing him to stay down.<br />
<br />
The pale moonlight illuminated the trees above him, their leaves swaying in an almost hypnotic motion from the cool breeze. A comfortable pillow of grass cushioned his head, the damp grass at his back seeping through his red tunic to the chainmail beneath.<br />
<br />
Sliding his right hand down to his hip, he desperately pries open the small leather satchel at his belt, grasping a small bottle of red liquid. Pushing himself against the trunk of the tree, his eyes shut as his vision begins to spin, accompanied by a terrible migraine.<br />
<br />
As the pain faded, Kairos’ eyes open, staring blankly at the contents of the healing potion. Popping the bottle open, he swallows it&#39;s bitter contents without hesitation. Energy fills him as the weakness from his limbs and ringing in his ears leave him. Yet the nausea remains. Panting, the red clothed human returns the empty bottle to the satchel. <br />
<br />
Not a single sound graced his ears aside from his own breathing.<br />
<br />
Shifting his legs, Kairos grunts as an unusual discomfort fills them. Slowly bringing his leg to him, puzzlement washes over his face as a noticeable white object was poking out from his black trousers, embedded in his right thigh. <br />
<br />
Pulling it out with a hiss, blood is drawn from the object’s removal. The swordsman cringes as he brings the sharp white item up to his face. Upon inspection, it appeared to be a <i>canine</i> tooth, and an abnormally sharp one at that. Had something bitten him?<br />
<br />
Clasping his head, Kairos struggles to remember how he had ended up unconscious with a tooth in his leg. His attempts at recalling are brought to an end as a terribly foul odour wafts to his nostrils.<br />
<br />
Covering his nose did little to alleviate the scent. The entire grove reeked of blood and other terrible things.<br />
<br />
Kairos’ vision darts around in silent fear, the grass around him was stained red. A few pieces of armor lay scattered about, with one piece resembling a shoulder pad. His eyes came upon what appeared to be a mess of innards alongside the armor and pieces of grey fur.<br />
<br />
It was almost as if something… <i>someone</i>... had...<br />
<br />
<i>Exploded...</i><br />
<br />
“<em>Orveus</em>!”<br />
<br />
Memories of what occurred mere moments earlier flew back to him. The werewolf&#39;s bloating body flashing through his mind. Even as he sat in shock, the entire world spun. Kairos’ blue eyes water as he stares at the werewolf&#39;s tooth, clenching it tight within his fist, the leather gauntlet preventing it from cutting into him.<br />
<br />
He hadn&#39;t known how much time had passed until he finally rose to his feet. Staring at his open palm in a trance, the human&#39;s gauntlet covered hand turns over, the tooth falling to the grass. Closing his eyes, a shaky sigh releases from Kairos.<br />
<br />
His eyes open once more. Whether guided by his will to not look at the bloodied remains of his friend or by some unknown force, his blue eyes rose to the full moon. The light it offered gave him solace against the darkness of the forest.<br />
<br />
It was… <i>Comforting</i>...<br />
<br />
<i>...Arousing?</i><br />
<br />
A blissful grin spreads across the blue eyed swordsman&#39;s face as his cock begins to harden beneath his red tunic, it&#39;s tip brushing up against his trousers.<br />
<br />
The blood, his deceased friend, it didn&#39;t matter as long as he focused on the moon…<br />
<br />
<i>That didn&#39;t matter…</i><br />
<br />
Kairos’ legs buckle, the human collapsing to his knees. A sensual gasp slips from his lips as weakness overpowers the effects of the potion, accompanied by an unusual yet blissful tingling spreading throughout his entire being. Falling to his back, the human&#39;s limbs splay out, craving the moon&#39;s light. <br />
<br />
<b><i>Only the moon mattered...</i></b><br />
<br />
Kairos shudders as his entire body begins to spasm and twitch, the feeling growing more and more intense. Trapped in a hypnotic state of endless pleasure, the human desperately fiddles with his belt buckle, trying to remove it to free his painfully throbbing cock.<br />
<br />
Hissing, Kairos thrusts his hips forward, dick twitching as if he had already came. His misty blue eyes glance down, widening as the tent between his legs appears to <i>grow</i>. His balls continuously swell, gurgling and growling as more of his seed is procured. A moan freezes within the human&#39;s throat as the tip of his throbbing cock flops out from under his white undershirt, the black fabric of his trousers struggling to restrain his growing ball sack.<br />
<br />
Lustfully bringing his hand to stroke himself off, Kairos shivers as his member had grown so wide he was unable to fully grip it with one hand. Even as it reached up to his chest, the large sword of meat continues to grow larger and larger. His balls had grown to the size of oranges, barely restrained by his black trousers. <br />
<br />
Gasping, Kairos’ hand suddenly retreats from futilely trying to stroke his cock, clenching and unclenching as if it had a will of it&#39;s own. Glancing at it, Kairos pants as his nails sharpen into deadly claws. Admiration of his new claws was interrupted as his pulsing cock bops his chin, smearing pre on his lower jaw.<br />
<br />
“<b>GRARGH</b>!” Kairos’ mouth flies wide open as his canines throb in pain, the pair of teeth lengthening and sharpening into small daggers. Unbeknownst to the human, the canine at the left half of his mouth had grown longer and sharper than the canine on his right half.<br />
<br />
More pain fills the changing human as his right arm cracks and bends in nauseating ways before slowly and excruciatingly extending from his body, doubling length within seconds. The muscle on his arm was rigid, thin and bony.<br />
<br />
This sight was short-lived as his muscles began to pulse, his forearm and bicep inflating in size. Unwillingly flexing, Kairos’ face scrunches as his bicep crests up, the immense girth shredding the white cloth covering it and forcing the sleeves of his tunic and chainmail to move up to his shoulder, the chain and cloth beginning to tear.<br />
<br />
<b><i>SCHRIP</i></b><br />
<br />
The front of his trousers gives way as his massive balls flop down to his knees, pulsing with seed. Another crack resounds as Kairos’ other arm elongates, muscles inflating to the same size as the other arm. The red cloth and silver chain burst apart as his shoulders swell.<br />
<br />
A painful throbbing at his feet cause Kairos to look down. His brown leather boots shifting around as his feet grew larger. Grunting, Kairos watches in shock as three clawed toes shred the tip of his boot from his left foot, while four shred from his right. Oddly enough, his left foot beared resemblance to the foot of a reptile, while his right looked closer to that of a wolf&#39;s paw. Kicking his boots off, he sighs in relief as the cool air licks against his bare feet.<br />
<br />
The difference was unwillingly ignored as the human&#39;s legs tighten, the appendages growing thin as bones crack and elongate while the muscles painfully stretch apart. Kairos’ viewpoint shifts as his lengthened legs eventually grow to match the proportions of his arms. The base of his throbbing member reveals as his tunic pulls up. The human squirms as the muscle at his legs start to pump up, calves growing to smooth perfectly carved spheres, while his quads gained a distinct teardrop shape only present on the most hardworking bodybuilders. <br />
<br />
Gurgling from his stomach causes Kairos’ gaze to shift to his abdomen. Groaning, his expanding ribcage and rearranging insides renders him ill, tunic stretching tight as his spine pops from his growing frame.<br />
<br />
Grunting, Kairos puffs his chest out. His elongated torso cracks and convulses as it begins to broaden, the transforming human gasping as the growth starts to tear the last remaining clothes preserving his modesty. Reaching down with one of his monstrous hands, a moan slips from the human&#39;s throat as his stomach shifts. The red tunic, silver chainmail, and white undershirt rip down the middle in unison as each row of abs grow in.<br />
<br />
Kairos grunts as his chest warms up, before one pec explodes in size, tearing one half of his tunic to shreds as it grows to a tough, massive slab of meat, the other growing to match it&#39;s twin. The transforming human&#39;s larger pecs cut off his lower view, bumping up against his chin and grinding against his dick. The cool air from the night causes his nipples to harden, the destruction of his tunic leaving him in the torn remains of his black trousers. Unable to resist their sensitivity, Kairos teases one of his nipples with his claws, his cock pulsing painfully at the prodding.<br />
<br />
Another moan freezes within his throat as his skin begins to tingle and itch. Bringing both hands to his face, Kairos’ jaw drops as his right hand begins to grow golden fur, the color resembling his hair. The skin on his left hand and arm grow slimy and scaly, turning a deep shade of blue, resembling his eyes. Glancing to his legs yields the same result, and an explanation. The toes on his left foot curl as cool scales envelope them, while they spread on his right as warm fur sprouts.<br />
<br />
The scales and fur rapidly spread up his body, the left side of his body and face enveloped in scales while the right is covered in fur. Rubbing his reptilian foot against his canine foot, Kairos rasps at how natural they feel against each other despite such conflicting texture and traits.<br />
<br />
A final pulse catches the hybrid&#39;s attention, glancing to his legs as his trousers struggled to contain his manliness. Kairos’ body twists and sways as his spine warps, his cock falling and slapping against his thigh. Shuddering, Kairos’ reptilian hand gropes his ass as it tenses up, the flesh hardening as the fabric strains against it. Kairos moans as he squishes the globes, the trousers finally beginning to tear due to his rump&#39;s enormous growth.<br />
<br />
<b><i>CRACK</i></b><br />
<br />
Yelling in pain, Kairos’ hands and feet clench as his spine snaps, reforming. His thickening thighs begin to tear the legs of his trousers as his ass expands into two heavenly carved orbs. His tailbone pushes out, both of Kairos’ hands clutching his ass in lust as a new appendage sprouts from his backside. Muscles form as the new appendage thickens, beginning to move with every conscious thought. Blue scales overtook the serpentine tail, the prehensile appendage growing twice as long as Kairos’ lengthened body and much wider than his barrelled arms.<br />
<br />
Kairos moans as his pecs grind against his enormous shaft, massive amounts of pre trickling from it to the grass covered ground. His smooth, cool snake-like tail coils around his balls, the tip consistently smacking his sack. Kairos’ beastial hands grasp at his throat as it broadens and thickens, every pant and grunt growing deeper and more guttural, his voice losing it&#39;s humanity through every breath.<br />
<br />
Kairos’ hands shift to his head, clasping at his face as it begins to morph into a twisted mix of features. The ear on his right side grows to a point, shifting to the top of his head, while the ear on his left side shrinks into a small hole into the side of his head. Writhing around in a mix of pain and bliss, Kairos yells as the right half of his face morphs and changes to resemble a wolf&#39;s features, while the left crunches and shifts into that of a snake. <br />
<br />
The split structures neither clash nor mesh as every last part of Kairos shifts, completely unrecognizable from the human he had always been. Even his eyes began to change, his left eye&#39;s pupil becoming a thin slit while it&#39;s blue grew richer, while his right eye&#39;s pupil became filled with a primal lust, a crimson red overtaking the ocean blue.<br />
<br />
“<b><i>GRAH</i></b>!” The half-snake half-wolf hybrid yells, clutching his head as a rush of foreign thoughts floods his mind. <br />
<br />
A mix of a serpentine hiss and a wolfish growl releases from Kairos’ throat as he reaches his limit. His balls throb, cock tensing before it explodes into a geyser of white seed, the white liquid shooting into the ground, drenching the hybrid&#39;s legs and feet in cum. The feeling of his furs and scales drenched in his seed causes Kairos’ gaze to gaze up at the night sky, the moon illuminating his split facial features.<br />
<br />
Panting, Kairos stares at his hands, his eyes widening in realization. Nausea suddenly washes over the newly transformed being as the transformation takes it&#39;s toll. <br />
<br />
The last thing Kairos sees are two entities standing over him. Unable to discern their features out of fatigue, the hybrid slips into sleep.</p>
