<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff looked at the directions of the Random option and finds it to be a bit risky.  Sure he wants to try being a random inanimate object, but he doesn’t know what kind or better yet, how long it will last.  But he does want to try it out and see where this will go.  So without giving it much thought, he pushed clicked on the yes option to continue and waited for the change to happen.<br />
<br />
In a matter of seconds, he could feel the tingling started and was getting excited.  Sure he didn’t know what he was going to become, but he couldn’t wait to see the changes himself.  Quickly, he got out of his chair and took off all of his clothes to see the change first hand, leaving him completely naked.  By the time he had turned around to look at the mirror, every hair on his body had retracted into his skin, leaving him bare. <br />
<br />
Jeff felt a strong prickling about his groin and buttocks.  He looked down just in time to see his penis and both testicles disappear into his groin.  Curious he cupped my bare groin in his hand, gently caressing what had once been his genitals, now only flat, bare skin.  The sensations were overwhelming.  Jeff reached around to feel his backside, discovering that his buttocks had fused together, sealing his anus shut. <br />
<br />
He then walked over to the full-length mirror to examine the rest of his progress.  His skin had become smoother, and glistened slightly, and was becoming paler by the second.  Jeff spread my legs and positioned himself in a squatting position while doing a few flex poses.  He tried to stand up straight, but he couldn’t.  For some strange reason he stood fixed in a squatting flex pose while his muscles strained to move his inert bones, but it was as if they had fused together into a solid structure.  Jeff wouldn’t have been surprised if that were actually the case.<br />
<br />
As he stared at myself in the mirror, he saw his belly button fill in and vanish, his muscles meld together and smooth across my torso, and his nipples assimilate into his chest.  Jeff was breathing heavily, causing my torso to bob up and down, his groin jiggling slightly.  He couldn’t help but chuckle at his reflection and looked quite amusing.  But the changes progressed as he was loosing more of himself.<br />
<br />
He could feel all of his organs melting into a solid mass of flesh and blood.  Soon enough, his esophagus expanded, sealing off his throat.  He couldn’t breath, and he had no heartbeat, but he was still alive at the moment.  In a matter of seconds, Jeff’s head was next to change as his mouth fused shut, his nose disappeared, and his eyelids stretched back into my eye sockets.  He couldn’t blink, or close his eyes.  Yet even if he could, he was still far too fascinated by the transformation to even care. Just then, his eyes felt dry and began to harden, glazing over and disappeared completely while leaving him blind.  But still, he could imagine what is bound to happen next.  His head sank into his shoulders and disappeared from view, as he was a headless body. <br />
<br />
Jeff’s arms were next as they began to shrink.  His fingers sank into his hands, his hands sank into his wrists, his forearms sank into his elbows, and what was left sank into his shoulders, which rounded themselves to his form until they were indistinguishable from my chest.  Next, his torso shortened, lowering his chest until it almost merged with his groin, making his buttock and upper back touching each other.  Over the next few seconds, Jeff’s body formed itself into a spherical shape, with legs connected to it.  But that would soon change as the rest of his body finished transforming.<br />
<br />
His legs were next to go as they began to retract the same way as his arms and slipped into his rounded body.  With no legs to support his balance, Jeff fell forward onto what had once been his belly, but was now a combination of his chest and groin. As soon as his feet finished assimilating into his posterior, he began to shrink away, growing more and more microscopic by the second.  As the changes finished up his skin and everything inside him began to harden and as the sensations of the transformation faded, so too did his consciousness.  With all of his senses gone, all Jeff can do is feel everything around him.<br />
<br />
The transformation was finished. Once was a 16-year-old Jeff was now a grain of sand, nothing more than a lifeless, sexless, microscopic hunk of dirt laying on the bedroom floor.  And though Jeff didn’t see the rest of it, he knew what he had become and enjoyed it.  What he didn’t know was that the Chronivac has the time on how long he had to stay.  Turns out, he has to remain in that form for a million years.  That means that he was going to spend the rest of his life as a piece of sand forever, at least until the time is finished.<br />
<br />
The moment his changes were done, he was immediately transported into a nearby beach soaking up on the hot sun and letting the cold ocean wash over him.  During that time…</p>
