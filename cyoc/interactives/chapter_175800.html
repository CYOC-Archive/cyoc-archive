<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rose held the message from Angelia in her hands, she looked around the table where her friends and Princess Amara was gathered. She really liked Amara and considered her a friend already and in time a sister not just a sister-in-law. Truth be told Amara would never be as close to Rose as Taylor and Angelia where to her, but that was because outside of blood they were sisters. Taylor grew up across the street from her and Angelia was five houses down from them and their mothers had taken turn baby sitting them so some of her kids<br />
memories where of the three of them being together. From Taylor’s mother, Karen teaching them how to plant sunflowers in the garden, to finger painting with Angelia’s mother and her own mother reading the three of them a story before they took a nap when they where kids.<br />
 <br />
“I must admit, I was worried you would be upset that Angelia turned you down.” Admitted Amara as Rose shook her head. <br />
<br />
“I actually expected it, but she is basically a sister to me, I had to give her the choice.” admitted Rose as Amara nodded her understanding. <br />
“Do you think we can go see Karen and Kat while they transform?”<br />
<br />
“Getting everyone but Nate and yourself there will be easy, but the school of Press waiting outside the gates would kill a shark with ease, there is no way to sneak you or Nate out.” explained Amara as Rose sighed, that was understandable, the crown prince had just come back from the dead and was engaged to a mermaid, Her it would have been odd if the press hadn’t been there. She had seen the Press through a window and they had seen her, the image of her looking out the window was on the news within moments. They actually cut away from live TV to show the first “live” images of the future Princess.<br />
<br />
“Better get used to the Press Rose, they aren’t going anywhere if the surface world is any sign of what it is like down here.” added Kelly as she looked at her book on how the merfolk used water to actually power some of the machines. “Glade, I can just blend into the background.”<br />
<br />
“Well you will not be blending into the background at the Glaucus Gala in two weeks.” countered Amara as everyone looked at her somewhat confused. <br />
<br />
“Wait…I read about that.” said Nate as he flipped open a book. “The Glaucus festival is the one of the largest religious and state holidays isn’t it.”<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Confirmed Amara “The Gala is the massive party that our parents hold every year in the capital. It is one of the royal duties which happen every year. Normally it is huge, over a weeklong celebration and it also the wedding anniversary of our parents and our grandparents.”<br />
<br />
“Wait…mom and Dad’s wedding anniversary is in two weeks…I have to.” Started Nate only to get a playful punch in the shoulder by his sister. <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about getting them anything, you being back is more then they ever wanted.” Countered Amara<br />
<br />
“Wait…you said Nate’s…sorry Cain’s parents and grandparents all share the same anniversary?” inquired Rose<br />
<br />
“Yes, so will you and Cain when the time comes, same with me and whomever I marry.” Stated Amara “That tradition dates back to before the founding of the kingdom when we where likely nothing more then traveling bands. It is a high holy day as well.”<br />
<br />
“Like having the King and Queen of a nation always getting married on Christmas or something like that.” stated Taylor, as she looked at Rose. There was no way Rose would be able to change a tradition dating back that long so when she married Nate be it next year or whenever it would happen during this festival, but it could be far worse.<br />
<br />
“And we are taking part in this Gala?” inquired Nate/Cain <br />
<br />
“Yes.” confirmed Amara as she saw the look at the worried faces on everyone most of all Rose and her brother. “Don’t worry we are moving the Gala here and it is going to be much smaller. Just family and a few government officials. The biggest guests will be our parents and my uncle and his wife and our cousins.”<br />
<br />
“Wait…isn’t your other Uncle a King as well?” inquired Stacy as Amara nodded, that meant two royal families would be gathering here in two weeks and there would be press of course and being the newly returned Prince and his friends, they would be the center of attention.<br />
 <br />
“Don’t worry, Mom will protect you all like a mother whale protecting her baby, if anyone comes close to you they will pay.” Reassured Amara before looking at Rose with a smile. “I am sure the jewelry will also have your engagement necklace done by then.”<br />
<br />
Rose reached to her ring finger out of habit before remembering that because of their webbed fingers merpeople did not wear rings. Instead, engagement necklaces which looked like something out of ancient Egypt was the norm, her engagement ring had been sent to the best jeweler in the kingdom who at this moment was working into the heart of a new necklace. <br />
<br />
“Well, I’ll leave you all to listen to the message.” said Amara before looking at Amanda and Taylor. “Your mother and girlfriend will be out for at least a day, I’ll arrange you two to travel to the transformation center, a nighttime transport should get you there in time to see them wake up.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks.” said Taylor as Amanda smiled and nodded her head. <br />
<br />
“I would like to be there as well?” asked Sam as Amara nodded her head, he was Taylor’s boyfriend so it made sense.<br />
Once Amara left the room, Rose placed the disk in the center of the table and hit play. The image of her friend filled the area above the disk. <br />
<br />
“Well Rose, I can’t say how much I am happy to hear that you are alive, I can’t believe it. Mermaids are real and Nate is a Prince.” said Angelia with a sad but Happy smile. “I wish so much to be there for yours and Nate wedding, but I can’t leave my family behind, I am sure you understand. I guess Taylor will win the place as maid of honor, but a new challenger has appeared in this mermaid Princess for a sister-in-law. Taylor I expect you to win.<br />
<br />
“I will.” said with a grin. <br />
<br />
“I will try to remember this, but I don’t think I will and if I do I will consider it nothing more then a bad dream.” stated Angelia “Still for this moment at least I know you are all ok and I hope you all have a wonderful life. Goodbye.”<br />
<br />
With that the image faded as the hologram turned off. <br />
<br />
“Goodbye my friend.” Said Rose as tears entered both her and Taylor’s eyes. Nate and Sam moved to each of their sides and pulled the close as they prepared for the next phase of their new lives.</p>
