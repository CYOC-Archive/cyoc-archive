<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Dara and her fused friends wait for an ambulance, the cum that flooded her apartment began to permeate every corner it could reach. Unfortunately for the other people in the building there were several places where the cum found a place to drain, a leak in the floor, the crack under the hall door, and an air vent placed low enough for the tide of cum to reach. <br />
<br />
**************************************<br />
<br />
Tyler was a student at the nearby collage. He had waited a few years to save money so he was a little older than most of the students at twenty-two. Luckily, he had found a group of friends and had started a Tabletop RPG group with them. Today was their meeting day and the group had just finished the day&#39;s session when the alert about the outbreak happened. After a bit of discussion, everyone agreed to stay at Tyler&#39;s overnight so that no one had to go home while it was unsafe. Just a few minutes later Steven, the groups game master, had been getting snacks in the kitchen when he had spotted two mutants masturbating in the alley and the others felt confident that their decision was the right one when he told them what he had seen.<br />
<br />
About fifteen minutes later, the group was sitting around in the living room while Tyler was making dinner for them. The group consisted of five guys, all students at the local collage, who had been playing tabletop games together for the past year and a half. Sitting on the couch were James and Kyle, who had been best friends since middle school. Off in a corner was Jacob, who was getting in a bit of extra studying before finals. Finally, Steven was going over the notes for today&#39;s session and organizing his GMing materials.<br />
<br />
Tyler was in the apartments small, separate, kitchen. Not having planned to have everyone stay overnight, he had wanted to simply order food, but due to the outbreak none of the local restaurants were delivering right now. Luckily, Kyle had brought tortilla chips for snacks to eat during the session that had been left mostly untouched. With the leftover chips, and some ingredients he had in his fridge, Tyler had thrown together enough nachos for everyone. With the nachos currently cooking in the oven, Tyler had just finished throwing some sour cream and bottled salsa into bowls when the first drips of Dara&#39;s cum had begun to drip from the floor above. With the nachos still a few minutes from being done, Tyler left the bowls of dip on the kitchen counter and went to hang out with the group for a little bit, meaning he didn&#39;t see the slow but steady drip of cum landing in the bowl of sour cream. When the oven timer went off Tyler jogged back into the kitchen, plated the nachos on the two biggest plates he had and brought them into the living room before going back to grab the dips. As he was doing this he noticed that the dips were getting a little liquidy, so he gave both of them a quick stir, inadvertently mixing his upstairs neighbours cum completely with the sour cream.<br />
<br />
The smell of food quickly gathered all five men to the coffee table and each of them started digging in as soon as everything was set out. Kyle and James were the first to eati the infected sour cream, taking big scoops of it on each chip. Steven also managed to get a few bites with some before needing to go to the bathroom. The remaining four continued eating for a bit longer before the first signs of mutation were noticed when Jacob saw that Kyle&#39;s skin had begun to change tone.<br />
<br />
“Hey Kyle are you ok? Your looking a little red right now.” at his friends prompting, Kyle looked down at his hand curiously and, sure enough, his skin was tinged red and it was getting redder by the second.<br />
<br />
“Oh shit, whats happening to me?” Kyle shouts as his whole body becomes a shade of dark red<br />
<br />
“You must have gotten infected somehow, we need to get out of here before we get infected as well!” Tyler grabbed James and pulled him up from the couch, but felt resistance as he tried to pull the other man towards his bedroom, which had the only inside door with a lock.<br />
<br />
“Ow! Stop pulling, I think I&#39;m stuck on something!” James said, freeing his wrist from Tyler&#39;s grip. When he checked to see what he was stuck on however, his blood ran cold. From his tailbone a scaly green tail had connected to the same place on Kyle&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m mutating too, it must have been the sour cream. You need to get out of here before you get infected as well.” James ordered, pushing Tyler away.<br />
<br />
“Wait. If it was the sour cream, then Steven might be infected as well! I&#39;m going to check on him!.” Jacob moved towards the bathroom as quickly as he could, worry for his friend causing him to forget that Steven was just as infectious as Kyle or James. Tyler was unable to warn him however, as when James pushed him he stumbled on the coffee table and fell over, landing hard on his back. James went over to check on his fallen friend, finding that the tail connecting him to Kyle had grown longer and thicker, allowing him to kneel down next to Tyler. <br />
<br />
Kyle meanwhile was watching as his hips and thighs began to grow, tearing through his pants and leaving him naked from the waist down. A thin coat of reddish brown fur quickly covered his legs, as if to replace his clothing. His feet tore out of his socks as they morphed into equine hooves leaving him standing on a pair of thick, horse legs. His average six-inch cock now looked tiny and out of place compared to his massive equine lower half. This soon changed as it began to rapidly expand, it&#39;s head flattened and the shaft developed brown mottling. Soon he had a massive three foot long horsecock, it&#39;s shaft wider than his torso and it&#39;s tip higher than his head. His ballsack had also grown, it now contained four basketball-sized testicles and hung down to his knees.<br />
<br />
As this was happening, James&#39;s own mutations had continued to progress as well. The serpentine tail that connected him to his friend had begun to cannibalize his legs, becoming close to five feet around on his end and slowly tapering off along it&#39;s now ten foot length to a still huge two feet around where it connected to Kyle&#39;s now much larger behind. The tail continued to absorb James all the way up to just before his pecs, his cock taken with the rest of his lower body. Despite his lack of legs, James found that his tail and Kyle&#39;s body were muscular enough that he could hold himself up and move around still. Tyler meanwhile, had gotten up and was backing away from his mutating friends, hoping that they wouldn&#39;t notice him while distracted by their changes. <br />
<br />
Both of the fused mutants were overcome with pleasure as the final stage of their transformations took place, their arms becoming toned, but unmistakably feminine limbs, their fingernails growing out and sharpening into points. Their chests ballooned out into breasts, Kyle&#39;s stopped at F-cups while James&#39;s grew into massive H-cups. Both of their faces then morphed into those of sexy, mature, women, with Kyle growing a pair of curved horns and James&#39;s pupils becoming slitted. While Kyles changes stopped there, James had one last change left. A strange feeling began rising in the lamia-tail&#39;s mouth before a blast of cum came flying out of it. This blast of cum landed a direct hit on Tyler, as James realized that he was now also a cock, with semen being stored in his breasts.<br />
<br />
Now that Tyler had been infected, all he could do was hope that his mutation didn&#39;t leave him completely unable to do anything like some of the people he had seen on the news. Much like his friends, it seemed that the mutation liquid wanted him to have a feminine body, as his frame became much more delicate and girly. His ears then became pointed, and his hair grew down to his waist. A pressure appeared in his groin and Tyler feared that he was losing his cock, but instead a third legs grew between his original two, his cock and balls being duplicated into his new crotch. The pressure then moved to his sides as two new arms grew below his original pair. His head shifted to one side as his sight doubled, now shared between the extra head that now sat on his shoulders. The last signs of his old figure, his flat chest, sprouted three new nipples which, alongside his original ones, sprouted into C-cup breasts. Each of his cocks then split into three, leaving him with six cocks split between his two groins, with six matching ball-sacks as well. The pressure then moved just behind Tyler&#39;s balls, forming two vagina&#39;s each with their own womb and ovaries jammed inside the mutant&#39;s torso.<br />
<br />
All three mutants took a moment to take in their new bodies, Kyle was a demonic horse-satyr, James was Kyle&#39;s lamia/cock tail, and Tyler was a hermaphrodite elf with several extra body parts.</p>
