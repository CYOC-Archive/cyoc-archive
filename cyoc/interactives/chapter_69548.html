<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steven was the kind of guy other guys envied, at age 22 he stood over 6 feet tall and had the body of a gymnast. For Steven life was good that <br />
is if it weren’t for Jos&eacute;. Jos&eacute; was his mothers new plaything and was a older Latino man whom frequently got on Steven’s bad side.<br />
    Steven didn’t understood his mothers fascination with foreign men, which only seemed to get worse as the years went on. Normally hired to <br />
help around the house the men in her life were usually fit and somewhat attractive, this was no different for Jos&eacute;. It didn’t take long for his <br />
mother to invite Jos&eacute; to move in so he wouldn’t have to transit to work each day. Since then Jos&eacute; had made himself quite at home almost never <br />
lifting a finger to help with anything. <br />
    In some cases this wasn’t so bad considering the condition Jose always looked when he did work. Covered in sweat and rarely wearing pants, <br />
Jos&eacute;’s choice of work clothes consisted of old underwear and a tank top, which disgusted Steven even more than usual. Comparing the two of <br />
them just wouldn’t be fair as Jos&eacute; was nearly a foot shorter than Steven at around 5’2”, and while he had muscle he also sported quite the <br />
sizable gut when compared to Stevens six pack. To Steven, Jos&eacute; was a slob just using his mother for a place to stay, something he argued with <br />
her about.<br />
    Things had gotten rough between she and he and their latest argument ended with Steven telling her she was a whore and her threatening <br />
to kick him out. Never one to lose he told her he’d leave and didn’t have to put up with her anymore, but of course this was just a threat as well <br />
and nothing would ever come of it. Having played this game before Steven decided to wait things out until his mother would come to him <br />
begging for forgiveness usually offering to buy him something expensive to make up for it. Having not talked to his mother since their last <br />
spat, Steven figured he’d milk the situation until she returned from work on the weekend. He smiled to himself thinking of all the times he’d <br />
done this as a kid with his brother and how easy it had become as time went by.<br />
     Out on the lawn Steven laid in a lawn chair in his board shorts catching the sunlight for a tan. The back door opened behind Steven and a <br />
Chihuahua scampered out onto the lawn, Jos&eacute; following it outside in a tight pair of swimming trunks holding a cold beer. As usual he looked <br />
sweaty, his dark skin glistening in the sun and hair greased back. Steven rolled his eyes behind his sunglasses and hoped he would just go <br />
away. <br />
“Haven’t seen you in awhile chico” Jos&eacute; stated with a tone of interest as he watched the dog out on the lawn. The poor creature shook as if <br />
someone had just shot it, trembling and looking at Steven it squatted to relieve itself.<br />
    Steven pulled his glasses down turning to look at Jos&eacute; “Listen, creep, I don’t want to see your face at all for the next few days so why don’t <br />
you put on some clothes and actually do what my mom hired you to do whatever that is. Also don’t forget to clean up after that fucking rat of <br />
yours.”<br />
“Oh,, you mean Kyle? Don’t worry about that chico, he cleans up after himself, and about your mom, no can do” Jos&eacute; replied, taking a swig <br />
from his beer and adjusting himself in his swim suit.<br />
“And why the hell not?” Steven was starting to get agitated as he watched the Chihuahua turn around to smell its own mess.<br />
“Your moms not here, and you know how she likes it” Jos&eacute; laughed insinuating about his sex life with Stevens mom. <br />
Steven had known for awhile that Jose and his mom screwed regularly when she was home. Anyone in the house at the time could hear them <br />
they were so loud. It disgusted him and the thought of it now was really pissing him off. <br />
“I’ve had enough of this, go clean something and take Kyle with you” Steven turned away from Jos&eacute; reaching for an Mp3 player nearby.<br />
“you know chico I’m not that bad a guy, heck maybe even you and I could get along” Jos&eacute;’s tone changed, he had leaned over Steven and <br />
placed his sweaty hand on the boys thigh.<br />
“What the fuck! Dude fuck off!” Steven slapped Jos&eacute;’s hand away pushing him back as he stood up looming over the smaller man. <br />
“Hey, just kidding chico I know you don’t like to play” Jos&eacute; smiled looking down at Stevens crotch winking, and putting his hands up in defense.<br />
“fucking right I don’t faggot!” Steven had had enough he was shaking and in the moment of things let his anger get the better of him pushing <br />
Jos&eacute; down to the ground causing him to drop and break his glass of beer.<br />
Kyle yelped in fear and began barking at Jos&eacute;. <br />
“Whoa, whoa there chico” Jos&eacute; pleaded from the ground.  “Oh man, chico my beer why you gottah do that? Kyle shut up” Jos&eacute; turned to the dog <br />
which silenced itself.<br />
“Fucking clean it up, and after that go do some work” Steven barked, turning to grab his things and walk away.<br />
    For the rest of the night Steven avoided Jos&eacute; and it seemed as though the smaller man as avoiding him as well. When he’d left him Jose <br />
actually looked pretty pissed off, Steven grinned thinking about the look on the mans face. This wasn’t the first time he’d pushed Jos&eacute;.  When <br />
they first met he had shoved him into a wall as a display of his dominance, he was alpha male of the house. Despite this he found himself often <br />
running into Jos&eacute; breaking the boundaries and pushing Steven a little more each time.<br />
    As Steven lay in bed flipping through a porno and planning to have friends over while his mother was out he heard familiar chanting from a <br />
room nearby. Jos&eacute;’s bedroom was adjacent to Stevens allowing for him to be heard now and then through the wall, lucky for Steven most of the <br />
time Jos&eacute; was with his mother so he didn’t have to listen while Jos&eacute; prayed before bed. Having tried to tell him to shut up before and failed <br />
Steven did his best to ignore it and soon found himself drifting to sleep while the chanting seemed to go on through the night.</p>
