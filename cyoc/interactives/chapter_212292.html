<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I hope this can give some insight to what &#39;helping people in all the wrong ways&#39; looks like</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jen walked down the street, she noticed a small boy, likely no more than five or six, wandering around on the sidewalk. He was clutching a small backpack tightly in his arms, and his eyes darted around nervously. Her face softened, and she made her way towards him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there, are you lost?&quot; she asked as gently as she could. The boy stuck to her side but didn&#39;t make eye contact. <br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; he muttered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Then where are your parents?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I&#39;m a bit lost, but don&#39;t take me back to them!&quot; he suddenly cried out. &quot;I don&#39;t wanna go back, I&#39;m running away &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, I see.&quot; She nodded along, not wanting to scare the boy away. &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
It took a few moments for the boy to finally concede, &quot;Oliver.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, Oliver. Now, can you tell me why you&#39;re running away?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because my parents are mean! They have so many rules, and now they have a baby and they don&#39;t do anything fun with me anymore and I hate my little sister!&quot; He stuck out his lip in contempt. &quot;So I&#39;m running away to go live in the forest! But I can&#39;t find it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, well, living in the forest by yourself can be really hard, and really dangerous for little boys like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that! And I&#39;m not a little boy, I&#39;m a big boy!&quot; He puffed out his chest. &quot;I&#39;m five-and-three-quarters!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer bit her lip trying not to smile at his display. &quot;Are you sure you can handle living all alone in the forest?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if you&#39;re sure, I can help you along a bit, how about that?&quot; At Oliver&#39;s nod, Jennifer smiled and snapped her fingers, letting wisps of blue-grey magic drift out and cover his body.<br />
<br />
Immediately, he began to change. The little boy shot up in height, growing to an incredible height of 8 feet, while his body and face quickly matured to a man around the age of 25. As his clothes had been shredded instantly in his immense growth spurt, Oliver found himself running his hands over his bare, fit physique, deep grunts coming from his newly-formed Adam&#39;s apple. Jennifer bit her lip as she grew his cock out from his tiny pre-pubescent prick to true manhood, a whopping 10 inches flaccid, but quickly hardening as Oliver&#39;s hands explored its length, bringing it to its full 12-inch hardness.<br />
<br />
It was as Oliver discovered the pleasures of being an adult that Jennifer continued to &#39;help&#39; the man in his quest to live in the wilderness. His fit physique quickly began to expand, as if someone had fitted an air hose to his muscle and started to pump. His biceps swelled larger than the width of Jen&#39;s torso, and his stance reformed to allow space for his tree-trunk thighs and telephone pole calves. The washboard abs he had before were quickly overtaken by the sheer size of his cinderblock abdominal muscles, surrounded by obliques that could crush steel. One could mistake his pecks for a brick wall as they jutted nearly a foot from his chest. His back wasn&#39;t spared either, with huge wings of muscles that cast a formidable shadow over the much tinier Jen. <br />
<br />
As Oliver stroked, now with far more speed and strength than before, he noticed something odd about his gigantic cock. First, his egg-sized balls were growing increasingly furry, and the grey pubes were slowly creeping towards his crotch. Secondly, the shaft seemed to be growing longer, as something started to appear at the base, swelling larger with each passing second. Thirdly, the shape was starting to change, and become a little less human...<br />
<br />
As his pubes reached his crotch, their fur began to spread outwards all over his body as the final set of changes began. A white fur trailed up his underbelly to where it met the darker grey-blue fur at his shoulders. It spread down his back until it came to his muscular bricks of an ass, where Oliver suddenly felt a strange pokibg sensation as a bushy wolf&#39;s tail began to grow out. His pants and moans became deeper and more feral as his face and voicebox changed to that of a wolf&#39;s, his ears pinned back as he lost himself to the throes of lust. He didn&#39;t notice his legs reforming, bending in a way no human&#39;s ever could. He didn&#39;t notice as his hands became paws and his sharp claws gently stimulated his dog cock. All Oliver could focus on was the intense pleasure he felt, building to a fever pitch as he finally unloaded his balls with a loud howl. <br />
<br />
The enormous, 8-foot anthro wolf looked down at Jennifer, who had watched the whole thing happen with a bemused smile on her face. He stepped closer, using his immensely muscular body as intimidation. &quot;What did you do to me?&quot; he growled at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you said you wanted to live in the forest, I just made it a bit less dangerous.&quot; She winked at him. &quot;You&#39;re going to be the only predator in there now, big boy.&quot; <br />
<br />
She patted his chest before he turned tail and bolted in the direction of the nearest nature reserve, with something like fear in his animalistic eyes. Jennifer sighed happily. She was making the world a better place, one person at a time.</p>
