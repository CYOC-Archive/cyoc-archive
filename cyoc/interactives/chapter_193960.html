<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey Sam, have you seen David? We&#39;re supposed to go over the notes for the presentation at 2, but he&#39;s nowhere near his desk,&quot; Jeff said, feeling irritated that David likely was lingering at lunch. Jeff and David had come to a truce years ago that Jeff would do the background work, they&#39;d meet and Jeff would explain everything to David, and David, using his good looks and charm, would sell the presentation while talking up how they both had worked together on it. It wasn&#39;t an ideal arrangement, but Jeff had to admit that David could charm the panties off an Evangelical missionary, which was far more useful when backed with the professionalism, data, and facts that Jeff could supply him. In an odd sense they both needed one another to make their careers work, something which David was apt to downplay and forget from time to time when his ego would get the better of him. Jeff himself was the brains of the outfit and arguably the oldest of the group at nearly pushing 40.<br />
<br />
&quot;Last I saw he was following Mary into the break room,&quot; said Sam. Sam was a young fresh faced kid out of college, still learning the ropes. He was neither overly handsome nor a genius in his own right, Sam was really just a regular guy just trying to find his own niche in the team beyond being the designated &quot;gofor&quot;. <br />
<br />
Jeff rolled his eyes. David had been trying desperately to get Mary, their project leader, to go out for a drink with him for as long as they&#39;d been assigned together. A leopard can&#39;t change his spots.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s see if they&#39;re still there,&quot; grumbled Jeff, as he ran his hand through his thinning dark hair with prominent gray hairs.<br />
<br />
Jeff led the way with Sam following quick on his heels as they headed towards the break room only to find Mary emerging from the small room designated for young nursing mothers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary, where&#39;s--&quot; started Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary, you look great!&quot; interrupted Sam, to which Jeff took the moment to pause and had to admit that a certain &quot;glow&quot; had overcome Mary that was different from earlier in the day. Heck her breasts along looked much fuller and as though they were about to burst out of her blouse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why thank you Sam, though don&#39;t think that flattery will get you out of that archive request I asked for,&quot; said Mary with a sly smirk which took Jeff by surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not, I&#39;d never even...&quot; trailed off Sam.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were looking for something, Jeff?&quot; asked Mary<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh, yeah, I was wondering if you had seen David around? We had... we had a meeting at 2 to go over the presentation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t think Davey is going to be able to make that meeting,&quot; said Mary as she placed her hand over her mid section.<br />
<br />
So David finally got inside Mary&#39;s panties... great, that&#39;s not going to backfire when he fucks it up, like he always does.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, can&#39;t he get his clothes back on in five minutes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, I don&#39;t think--&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff though was annoyed enough that he was going to open the door, buck ass naked David or not, and get him moving as soon as he could. He moved past Mary and opened the door only to find the room completely empty. It stank of musk as Jeff expected, but there was no other exit that David could have gone out of to explain his absence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is David, Mary?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam himself poked his head into the room to take a look.<br />
<br />
&quot;I tried telling you that Davey&#39;s not going to be able to make that meeting, nor any meeting coming up, to be specific... in fact it might be time to consider replacing him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary... did you fire David?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No exactly... you could say he received a demotion though,&quot; said Mary with an odd look on her face as she approached the room that Jeff and Sam had now entered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jeff, look at this,&quot; said Sam, and Jeff looked to see in the wastebasket what looked like a crumpled up suit... but not just any suit, David&#39;s suit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary, what happened?&quot; asked Jeff, feeling an odd strange feeling as Mary entered the cramped little room, closing the door behind her. There was something ominous and yet inviting about Mary which caused both Jeff and Sam to feel at once frightened and yet oddly soothed by her presence. And that odd musky smell was starting to cause Jeff and Sam&#39;s thoughts to cloud up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well boys, Davey decided more than anything he wanted to go home to his mother... so I just helped things along.&quot; Mary was starting to unbutton her blouse.<br />
<br />
&quot;How so?&quot; asked Sam with a visible gulp, his stomach audibly gurgling at that moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary... whatever happened, you can tell us... we&#39;re a team,&quot; said Jeff, who felt his own stomach starting to flip flop.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, we&#39;re not just a team, boys... we&#39;re family... and I wasn&#39;t at first so enamored at the idea of triplets, but given the development of things once I saw you... and the situation we find ourselves in... I guess it is what it has to be.&quot; And with that said, Mary took off her bra, exposing her breasts to both Jeff and David, and suddenly a strange series of thoughts began to overcome Jeff and Sam as their stomachs yearned for breast milk. Breast milk that was now leaking from Mary&#39;s large breasts, just urging to be suckled. All thoughts of work, their lives, their worries and concerns faded with just the infantile longing to feed overriding everything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me sit down first boys, and then you can have your treat,&quot; promised Mary and she took her seat and opened her arms wide. The only way to have them both suckle and fit in the room was to have them both kneel on either side of her and have her lean over so they could both nurse at once. It was an odd feeling having her breasts which had magically refilled at the sight of Jeff and Sam, and expanded to even larger than they had for David, pulled in separate directions, an odd tug at her chest in either direction, but it would be worth it when her boys were all together, as she somehow knew they would be.<br />
<br />
Signs of returning youth were more apparent in Jeff, who seemed to be getting younger than Sam at a faster rate than his soon to be brother. Gray hairs were vanishing, his head hair growing thicker, his lean physique becoming tighter as his thirties gave way to his twenties. Sam meanwhile barely looked younger as he nursed away his college graduation. Soon, it appeared as though Sam and Jeff were about the same age, two freshman college students, both lean and barely looking man enough for the activity they were doing, but with the next gulp they returned to late high school years as their lean builds gave way to lanky and angular facial features were rounding off.<br />
<br />
They continued to regress about the same pace now, the lanky thin boys beginning to experience shrink spurts which caused them to have to adjust how they were kneeling, and at this point, Mary decided to pull back, causing both her pubescent boys to stop chugging her milk with a &quot;pop&quot; as her aerolas were freed from their mouths just a second as she readjusted herself into a far more comfortable position and forced the 13 year old Jeff and Sam to have to stand and lean forward over Mary to continue to suckle. Standing up as they did, they stepped out of their now too large shoes and socks, while their pants fell to the floor along with underwear, leaving them only in outsized dress shirts and ties which didn&#39;t cover their modesty until they started once again drinking from Mary&#39;s breasts, and their dwindling hard-ons softened and shrank as their shirts grew to cover them.<br />
<br />
They continued to shrink at a relatively decent pace and through shrink spurts that brought more rounded childish features to her boys and more and more baby fat as well. She stopped them again when their heights made it once again more difficult to reach over their Mommy for their feeding. They were somewhere around Kindergarten age it looked, and Mary knew at this point they soon would be young enough to begin the process to join Davey, and that it was time to get naked once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Want more!&quot; insisted Sam with a pout.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shh, it&#39;s all right my sons, you&#39;ll have more soon, but we need to get these clothes off first,&quot; said Mary, and with a decided fit of independence, Sam tried eagerly to get out of his shirt, only to get more tangled up in it, while Jeff managed to eagerly and quickly slip out of his shirt, his glasses also falling to the floor at this point, though they had already outgrown his diminishing head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, help your brother while I get ready myself,&quot; urged Mary as she tugged at her own pants, readying for the arrival of two more bundles of joy to join the already awaiting Davey.<br />
<br />
Once Mary herself was naked she positioned herself back in the chair and watched as Jeff managed to finish helping Sam out of his shirt, which was tossed to the floor the way a toddler would disrobe.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right Jeff, for helping Sam like a good brother, you get to go first. Sam, sit on the ground for the moment and wait your turn.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s eyes lit up and he hurdled himself onto her lap and curled himself up eagerly as he reaquainted himself with the breast he had been suckling on before she had paused his treatment, his curly dark brown hair very thick and rubbing up against her chest. Jeff then immediately began to grow younger as Mary moved to hold him, baby fat overtaking height as Jeff shrank into toddlerhood, and then as his luscious hair began to thin again back into being a baby and infant. When he eventually seemed to grow no younger, only then did his umbilical cord begin to grow out of his belly button and Mary knew she would need the floor once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sammy, get up on the chair for now and keep waiting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeffy&#39;s really small,&quot; said Sammy in that amazed tone that most young children have.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, and soon you&#39;ll be just as small as him,&quot; said Mary as she laid down and helped the umbilical cord find her vagina. It connected like before, and she felt the contractions pulling Jeff in. At one point, Mary looked up to find Sam watching in amazement as Jeff was slowly stretching and pulled into her vagina by his feet, then his arms, and finally his head. At one point she may have even seen Sam push Jeff in in a futile effort to &quot;help Mommy&quot; as most young children are eager to do. Mary&#39;s belly stretched out once again, and then she looked to Sam.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow... and Jeff&#39;s inside your tummy now?&quot; he asked, seemingly free of all adult knowledge in spite of what he had just witnessed. He pressed his head against Mary&#39;s belly and she saw a foot kick against where Sam had leaned, causing Sam to giggle at the interaction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, right along with Davey. All right Sammy, let&#39;s do this quick.&quot;<br />
<br />
And without further invitation needed, Sammy eagerly returned to the breast he had been drinking from and soon his auburn locks were growing wispy as well and his own umbilical cord was searching around her bulging belly for her vagina. Compared to Davey and even Jeffy, Sammy almost slid quick into her stretched out vagina and cervix. When the contractions died down, Mary stared at the overly pregnant belly had with her pinned down with, and Mary knew what she had to do. With exaustion she reached down for her stretched out breast that Sammy had been suckling from and with some positioning, managed to pull a bit of her own milk from it, causing her bulging belly to shrink, but not as much as she thought it would. It seemed Sammy only shrank to join Davey at three months along, while Jeffy remained ready to burst at any moment. Well, that would be just as easily remedied, and so Mary switched the breast of her attention, and soon her belly shrank down to a bit more than she had when she had just been pregnant with Davey. She could sense that all three of her boys were now three months along, and she was now about two inches more of fitting back into her clothes. She took another few drops from each breast and felt her belly shrink all three even more to two months along, just barely knowing she was pregnant and able to slip back into her clothes. This time, she&#39;d have to get rid of the boys&#39; adult clothes more discerningly... she could fold them, gather them all into a bag, and say they were a goodwill donation--that&#39;d work.<br />
<br />
And so at long last, Mary left the break room hoping to not run into her boss.</p>
