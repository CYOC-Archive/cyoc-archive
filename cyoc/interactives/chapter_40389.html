<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, I'm off to see what Martin's up to tonight,&quot;  Gina announced, pushing away from the computer.  &quot;Wish me luck!&quot;<br />
<br />
Debra rolled her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I wish you luck, whatever that may be,&quot; she sighed, wondering about her co-worker's taste in men.<br />
<br />
Gina merely smirked and headed out the door.<br />
<br />
Debra looked at the computer, still displaying the newly minted man, and briefly thought about messing with his stats before Gina arrived.  It might be funny, but she really didn't have the heart to disappoint Gina like that.<br />
<br />
As she stared at the screen, Debra remembered her comment about the janitor, Octovio.  She realized that she really didn't know much about him, other than he was always nice to her and everyone else at work.  She didn't even know his last name, or what nationality his name was.  It sounded Mexican, although he looked decidedly Caucasian. <br />
<br />
Now curious, she entered his stats, finding it a little more difficult since she had less information to start with.  When she finally was finished, she sat back and stared at the screen, feeling more than a little surprised.<br />
<br />
For starters, it seemed &quot;Octovio&quot; was a nickname.  Apparently it came from his age-- 85, not 65 as Gina had guessed.  (He really didn't look a day over 65!  Somehow he was remarkably well preserved for his age.)  He was straight, but had a surprisingly low sex drive, which she guessed was why he was single.  That, and his testosterone seemed surprisingly low-- almost non-existent.   He was reasonably intelligent-- no genius, but far from stupid.<br />
<br />
Doing a bit more investigating, Debra decided that the web site was a good source for investigating guys on.  It seemed that Brian, which was &quot;Octovio's&quot; real name, was retired from state employment, and that this was his way of making ends meet on a too small pension.  He had a weird assortment of hobbies, welding, alternative energy (making his own diesel fuel, wind generators, and other things), grew his own vegetables, and liked to travel.<br />
<br />
'I wonder what he would have been like as a younger man?' she found herself thinking.  'Maybe a bit more masculine and a smart college guy...?'<br />
<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The man everyone called &quot;Octovio&quot; was working on clearing a particularly stubborn clog in the Men's rest room.  He suspected someone had come in off the street to use it, since only he, Sean, and Martin used it, and none of them had tried to flush a McDonald's Happy Meal, still in the bag, down the toilet.  Most of the meal had finally come back up, and he suspected it was the toy still blocking the pipes.<br />
<br />
Leaning back, the plunger dripping onto the tile floor, Brian wiped his brow with the back of his hand.  This was certainly not the place he'd wanted to be at this point in his life.  Of course, most of his life hadn't gone the way he'd wanted.  Never having completed college, he'd managed to drift around until he landed as a clerk working for the state for 33 years, finally retiring at 72, only to find his pension really wasn't enough to make ends meet, so here he was-- standing in a stall trying to out muscle a stubborn clog in a toilet... and he'd never really been able to add muscle, no matter how hard he'd tried...<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a weird wave of pleasure swept over him, causing him to drop the plunger in surprise.  As a further surprise, Brian/Octovio  realized he was now naked.  His cock imitated a turtle in the cool rest room air, and the white hairs on his chest and stomach stood up as goosebumps swept over his body.<br />
<br />
The old man suddenly found his back straightening, and his height increasing as he went through a surprising growth spurt-- a growth spurt which left him at first at an even six feet, then resumed until he was 6' 7&quot;.  While he grew, his body hair at first darkened, then fell out, leaving him bare chested, and bare stomached.  In fact, other than under his arms, around his genitals, and a slight dusting on his legs, his body was now completely hairless.  Next his body fat melted away, leaving him incredibly lean-- every muscle stood out in detail, every vein was now visible.  As his fat disappeared, his skin rejuvenated, wrinkles smoothing out, elasticity returning, until he had skin as good, no, actually better, than he'd had as a teenager.  The remaining hair suddenly darkened, at first retuning to its original brown, then, oddly, switching over to a reddish brown.  His hair was now auburn.  Then, although he could not see it, his eyes switched color to a vivid, clear green, and his eyesight became incredibly sharp.  His muscles next ballooned up, growing into an athletic coaches dream, while Brian's reflex's sharpened to perfection.  <br />
<br />
Even though when he'd entered the bathroom, Brian had over a day's worth of stubble on his face, he was now surprising clean shaven.  In fact, he no longer was old enough to actually grow a beard.  After all, he was now only (barely) 18, and a college freshman going to school on a full basketball scholarship.  He was only working here part time, and for extra spending money.  <br />
<br />
As he stood there, staring at his new body and sorting the new facts about his life, Brian found himself daydreaming about the woman who worked here, and how lucky he was to be one of the few guys working there (and one of them was gay!).  <br />
<br />
His cock subtly lengthen, his balls grew slightly, as his testosterone level increased to that of a healthy, athletic teen, then a bit higher. His clothes returned-- a t-shirt with the university's mascot on it, jeans he didn't mind getting dirty, athletic shoes-- as his mind settled on Debra, the hot intern his age.<br />
<br />
Brian picked up the plunger, and with a few quick strokes, the Happy Meal toy came back up the plumbing and into the toilet bowl.<br />
<br />
The action of pushing the plunger into the toilet and pulling it back out made Brian think of sex-- and he decided it was about time to ask Debbi out...<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Debra, or Debbi as everyone now called her, leaned back from her computer screen, admiring the changes she made in both the janitor and herself.  They were both now college freshmen, living in the same dorm, in fact.  He now seemed headed for some sort of alternative energy engineering major, and she was majoring in business.  They were now both young, athletic, and would make a great team.  She'd designed them that way.<br />
<br />
Carefully bookmarking the site, and sending a copy of the link to a backup email account she had, Debbie shut off her computer and decided to look for Brian, to see if he would be interested in going out with her...</p>
