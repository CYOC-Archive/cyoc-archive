<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty scopes around the room looking for his next target. His gaze stops on Miss Emily Smith. Not many would focus on her with her mousy-brown short hair and her completely average body covered up in baggy clothes. But  looking at her now, there&#39;s no way anyone would ignore her today. She&#39;s still sitting in her seat panting from being exposed to Herc and her hand is resting on her giant pregnant belly. She won&#39;t talk to anyone about it, but everyone guesses that she&#39;s about 7 months along and the dad is someone she met at band camp during the summer. And how could she deny it: her tiny petite figure blew up within a few weeks and she holds herself like any expecting mother. Her old oversized clothes are now pulled tight across her frame; her sweats barely fit and her t-shirts slide up exposing her huge belly. And she can&#39;t even pull her hoodies across her chest because her boobs have exploded over the past few months. With no friends to talk to, she just waddles through the halls, trying to avoid everyone&#39;s stares at her belly.<br />
<br />
Even now, obviously turned on by James&#39;s presence, she couldn&#39;t get up and join the rest of his harem due to the massive weight of her growing figure. But interesing enough, shy little Emily seems to be the most &quot;bothered&quot; out of all of the class. Her face has turned beet red and sweat stains have started to appear all over. One hand reaches the back of her neck as she tries to cool herself down as the other starts clawing at the collar of her shirt, trying to fan herself with it. But even though the shirt was big enough last semester, her new giant mams and belly are way too big to give way and the shirt stays pulled tight against her body. Ty watches her squirm in her seat and notices her legs shuffling under her desk. Her hands dash to her jeans to try to &quot;relieve&quot; herself but her womb is just too big for the new momma.<br />
<br />
Ty thinks to himself &#39;Those pregnancy hormones are a bitch&#39; and starts to feel bad for her. Watching her, Ty gets an idea. He looks back to the board and finds a name. &quot;Hera, Goddess of Childbirth and Marriage. That could be helpful.&quot; He refocuses on the suffering Emily and silently makes the wish.<br />
<br />
The changes start slowly. First her hair grows long and thick, with chocolate curls draping over the back of her seat. Her acne-ridden face clears up and her complexion evens out leaving her with a fairly pretty face but it continues to morph into one of awesome natural beauty. It still looks like Emily, but if she was a supermodel instead of a poor high school student. Now her body starts to grow in the seat. Her legs elongate and thicken and he can see, due to her arching back, that her ass is growing very plump and is pushing her sweats to their limits. Luckily they&#39;re super stretchy because jeans would have been torn apart. Unfortunately as the rest of her grows, her other clothes aren&#39;t so lucky. Emily&#39;s belly and breasts grow, her torso stretches upwards, and her arms & shoulders grow stronger, ripping her shirt and hoodie off her body. Her face winces in pain and Ty can see her belly start to push against her desk. &quot;Oh shit the baby!&quot; But before he can make a wish, the desktop is snapped off the the rest of the desk by Emily&#39;s new Goddess strength and thrown across the room. Now completely unhindered by the desk&#39;s limits, Emily starts to enjoy her changes and starts to lose herself in her new body. She starts to sigh as she runs her hands through her long hair.<br />
<br />
All eyes in the room, including James and his girls, are focused on Emily as starts to gasp louder and louder. She starts rubbing all over herself as it&#39;s obvious she is really enjoying her transformation. Ty can feel the energy she is giving off from a few desks away and wishes he wouldn&#39;t be affected by her extremly potent pheromones. But everyone else is getting whammied across the room and the other classmates are starting to look at each other with strong intent. Mr. Reynolds, unable to control himself, runs out of the classroom and down the hall to a certain Ms. Fischer&#39;s room, leaving the room full of horny teenagers.<br />
<br />
James in the back of the room is first one to make a move as he grabs one of his girls and pulls her down onto his lap to make out with her. She welcomes him by pulling off her shirt, unzipping his jeans, and pulling his massive penis out of them. He picks her up by her waist and slams her down onto his throbbing erection and fiercely fucks her to the rhythm of Emily&#39;s cries. Some of his other girls start to join in on their man and his chosen bimbo and grind and kiss him as he fucks his first one. He quickly blasts into her and trades her out for a new one, letting her get rest on the floor surrounding his throne as she cradles her ravished midsection. As the pile of bimbos on the floor grows they start to kiss, spoon and cuddle each other, obviously still very horny until James grabs one of them to fuck again. Ty&#39;s other classmates start to pair off (or group off) and they all slowly but surely make their way to bonetown. The orgy is very extensive with some students fucking on top of their desks, one guy has another pushed up against the wall their swords out and crossed, two girls make out on the floor with a crowd of guys jerking off to them before a third jumps in, and one girl is giving some guy a blowjob under his seat while another guy rams into her ass.<br />
<br />
With her every cry, Emily sets a cadance that the rest of the class follows through with their orgy. As Emily gets more and more excited so does the rest of the class until she stops growing and reaches the highest climax she could ever imagine. The rest of the class soon follows and they all sit, lay, or stand together (freaky kids) in a hormone fueled daze.<br />
<br />
Ty, completely in awe of the actions before him, looks back at his new Goddess. Emily Smith sits in her chair rubbing her belly and breasts in complete ecstasy, not caring about her new giant size or shredded clothes. &quot;God damn, she&#39;s huge! She looks taller than James.&quot; And she is, Hercules is only a demigod after all. But as radiant as she is, her tattered clothing is unfitting such a woman. So Ty wishes up some appropriate Goddess attire. Her shredded clothes glow and melt across her body, moving around every curve like liquid, and reform into a classic Greek, floor length, purple toga complete with a golden laurel wreath on her head, golden arm bands, and golden leather sandals. She truly is a Goddess now.<br />
<br />
Finally calmed from her orgasmic transformation, Emily rubs her belly intently and stands up, her head scraping the ceiling. Ty wish it higher and she stands up straight at 10 feet tall. With every step her new volumptuous figure slinks under her toga, giving her an incredibly sexy silhouette. She walks over the half naked and entangled students and stands in the front of the classroom with a confidence she never had before. Emily brushes off her toga and crosses her arms over her protruding belly, now big enough to be holding one of her fellow classmates inside. Her sultry face then contorts and a look of calm fury spreads across it in an instant. She casts a stern glance over the room, grabbing everyone&#39;s lovedrunk attention. &quot;One of you has dishonored me. One of you has left me with child but has not stepped up to claim me as yours. For months I walked through school, teased, alone, and scared. But no more. You will be mine, or face the consequences.&quot; She locks eyes on the father. &quot;Choose now.&quot;</p>
