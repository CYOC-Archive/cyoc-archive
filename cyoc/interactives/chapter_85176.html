<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andrew arrived in his college level calculus class, sat in his usual seat preparing for his last class of the day. Everything was just like it always was, except he noticed a prospective student in the class. <br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s pretty cute, I hope she decides to attend here.&quot; Andrew thought.<br />
<br />
The lecture began, and after a few minutes of boredom Andrew was alerted as a note fell on his notebook. He passively noticed that the note had come from the direction of the prospective student.<br />
<br />
“What’s this?” He thought to himself, looking over the page.<br />
<br />
To my new friend,<br />
<br />
You’re not happy with you are, are you? Here&#39;s a game to make a change in your life. Have fun! I know I did! Your new friend.<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s strange....&quot;,  Andrew thought, &quot;What sort of note is this? Who would give this to someone?&quot; He may not have wanted to admit it, but the note was right. He wasn&#39;t happy with who he was, and desperately wanted a change.<br />
<br />
He took a pen out of his pack with some trepidation and started the survey.<br />
<br />
1. If you were a girl, would your handwriting be nice?<br />
<br />
He answered: My handwriting would be neater than it is now, but generally the same. Definitely not too feminine.<br />
<br />
Andrew’s somewhat messy notes shifted to become more legible, but he still recognized it as his own hand. Taking note of his handwriting, He blinked a few times as his mind processed what he saw. Glancing around, a grin spreading quickly across his face. “I…is this for real? I can change who I am?” Any trepidation he felt just moments ago, had vanished like smoke in the wind. This was his chance to get what he wanted.<br />
<br />
2. If you were a girl, would you like pink?&quot;<br />
<br />
No more than I do now.<br />
<br />
No change occured, since he hadn&#39;t changed anything with his answer. <br />
<br />
3. If you were a girl, would your hair be straight or curly?<br />
<br />
Thinking for a moment, he wrote:<br />
<br />
Straight, but with enough volume to style it if I feel like it.<br />
<br />
Andrew noticed the only change to his hair as how soft and silky smooth it now felt. It felt more feminine, even if it was still the same length and style.<br />
<br />
4. If you were a girl, what would your favorite color be?<br />
<br />
He wrote: Blue. I still like the same colors I do now.<br />
<br />
While he wanted change, he didn&#39;t want too much. There were things he liked that didn&#39;t need changing.<br />
<br />
5. If you were a girl, what color would your hair be and how would you wear it?<br />
<br />
“This is were I can start to make real changes” Andrew smiled as he wrote: <br />
<br />
My hair would be slightly more blonde than it is right now, and it would reach just past my shoulders. <br />
<br />
His smile widened even more, as his hair flowed down from his head. As it grow it brightened to his desired blond shade stopping gracefully as it reached it’s desired length. Andrew marveled at the foreign sensation of having long hair. It fell into his field of view and brushed against his shoulders in ways that felt very strange to him. He was relieved that these changes felt abnormal to him, he didn&#39;t want to change his memories or anything. <br />
<br />
6. If you were a girl, what color would your eyes be?<br />
<br />
My eyes would be a richer, more vibrant blue than they are currently. <br />
<br />
Andrew felt like his eyes were very dry for a moment as his irises changed color, but a few blinks alleviated that.<br />
<br />
7. If you were a girl, what kind of skin color and what kind of complexion would you have?<br />
<br />
My skin color is basically the same as it is right now, but flawless, smooth, and soft. My complexion is perfect.<br />
<br />
He shivered as his skin shifted, becoming more feminine and all the moles and freckles he had faded away, leaving flawless skin behind. Andrew paused for a moment to touch his skin. His hand trembled as it touched his arm. The soft smooth skin he felt filled him with joy. “I have to finish this ‘game’. The sooner the better.” He picked up the pen, smiling at his smooth hands, noticing the blue nail polish that had appeared on his fingernails.  <br />
<br />
8. If you were a girl, would you be sporty?&quot;<br />
<br />
Generally yes. I like all the sports and activities I do right now. However, I don&#39;t need to exercise or watch what I eat to maintain my great figure. I&#39;m very healthy and have a great metabolism.<br />
<br />
Andrew felt tingling in his legs and arms as they seemed to become more feminine in their shape and muscle tone. <br />
<br />
9. If you were a girl, what over activities would you be involved with?<br />
<br />
He tapped the pen to the paper in thought, he had missed out on being a part of his school&#39;s Formula SAE team because he hadn&#39;t kept up with the events. This was a chance to fix that. He wrote:<br />
<br />
 I am involved with my school&#39;s Formula SAE team, both in the design and driving. <br />
<br />
This didn&#39;t add any memories, but a cursory check of his email confirmed that he was now on the team.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll probably have some catching up to do, but now I&#39;ll finally be involved!&quot; he thought.<br />
<br />
11. If you were a girl, would you wear dresses and skirts?<br />
<br />
He wrote: Not usually, but I would if the occasion called for it. My mother encourages me to wear dresses for events like weddings. I might wear a skirt if I felt like it.<br />
<br />
12. When you are a girl, how many siblings will you have?<br />
<br />
“Dropping the disguise, huh? Good, now we can get down to business” Andrew chuckled.<br />
<br />
My family is the same as it is right now, no changes.<br />
<br />
13. When you are a girl, will you wear high heels?<br />
<br />
Yes, but only when I have to. I’m usually wearing sneakers, flat slip-ons, or sandals.<br />
<br />
He watched as his feet became small and dainty. His shoes stayed the same, but changed in size to match his feet. He couldn&#39;t see it, but his socks gained some pink on the heels.<br />
<br />
14. When you are a girl, will you wear jewelry?<br />
<br />
Yes, I wear small earrings or studs occasionally.<br />
<br />
A piercing pain emanated from his ears as they shrank and diamond studs set into the lobes. <br />
<br />
15. When you are a girl, would you have any other accessories like glasses or hairbands?<br />
<br />
Generally not, but I would wear sunglasses if it&#39;s sunny outside, or maybe a hairband rarely.<br />
<br />
16. When you are a girl, what size breasts will you have?<br />
<br />
Without a second thought he wrote: I have B cup breasts that are very perky. <br />
<br />
Andrew felt his nipples started to itch, before puffing up and becoming more feminine, but not too large. His chest then became tender as two perky breasts started to inflate. As they finished, Andrew now had two perfect B cup breasts pushing out his shirt, exactly the sort he liked. He was starting to look more like a she.<br />
<br />
17. When you are a girl, will you be attracted to guys?<br />
<br />
No. I am a lesbian and only attracted to girls. <br />
<br />
18. When you are a girl, what kind of shirt will you be wearing?<br />
I would be wearing a feminine equivalent of the shirt I&#39;m currently wearing. <br />
<br />
The plaid button down shirt she was wearing shifted, accommodating her new breasts and slim feminine torso. The buttons flipped to the other side, and another top button unbuttoned itself. The white undershirt she was wearing became a tank top that covered up some of her cleavage. <br />
<br />
19. When you are a girl, will you shave?<br />
<br />
Yes, I shave my legs and underarms, although I have very little body hair naturally. I only trim my pubic hair since I don&#39;t have that much naturally.<br />
The unsightly hair she still had instantly vanished. The sight of her bare smooth skin made her happy.<br />
<br />
20. When you are a girl, will you use tampons or a pad?<br />
<br />
Knowing what change this would bring, Andrew eagerly wrote: I usually have a lighter flow, so I generally use pads. I use slim tampons if I&#39;m swimming or doing something where I can&#39;t use pads. My last period ended four days ago.<br />
<br />
Her grin widened again as she felt her genitalia pull inside becoming their female counter parts. She felt her internal organs shift around becoming female. She couldn&#39;t see, but her new vulva was nice and flat and her labia were slim and small, just the way she hoped for. Her hips flared out slightly as her thighs and butt became more feminine while her waist pulled in. This felt incredibly strange, the absence of the genitals she was familiar with felt a bit like the empty space of a missing tooth, but she was so happy it didn&#39;t bother her in the least. <br />
<br />
21. When you are a girl, what kind of underwear will you wear?<br />
<br />
I have all kinds. But today I’m wearing polkadot blue bikini briefs.<br />
She gasped as she felt her underwear slide around her butt and hug her hips, making the flatness in her crotch even more noticeable. <br />
<br />
22. When you are a girl, what kind of bra will you wear?<br />
<br />
She wrote: Right now I&#39;m wearing one that matches my panties. My breasts are perky enough to not need a bra, but I usually wear one because my nipples are sensitive.<br />
<br />
She felt a soft, silky material cup her breasts. The subtle lift made them look slightly larger, and the padding did feel very nice.  <br />
<br />
23. When you are a girl, what will your intelligence be on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 being a ditzy bimbo and 10 driving the class nerd up the wall)?<br />
<br />
&quot;A little bump couldn&#39;t hurt, it would definitely make my classes easier.&quot; Andrew thought while writing down the number 10.<br />
<br />
She felt a slight headache as her knowledge expanded. Although she hadn&#39;t been paying attention, the lesson on the board suddenly made perfect sense and actually seemed quite easy. She even read and processed it faster than she would have before. She winced slightly from the headache, which quickly subsided. <br />
<br />
24. When you are a girl, will you wear makeup?<br />
<br />
Only occasionally. My skin is so perfect that I don&#39;t need much makeup, but I occasionally do wear small amounts to accentuate my natural beauty.<br />
<br />
Her face became female, and although she didn&#39;t have a mirror she knew it was just what she wanted. She would have to look up how to apply makeup if she ever felt like wearing any.<br />
<br />
25. When you are a girl, what is your age, height without shoes and weight without clothes?<br />
<br />
I&#39;m 6&#39;0&quot;, and 135 lbs. I&#39;m 20 years old, but I look like I&#39;m about 17. My body will age very slowly, I&#39;ll still look 20 even when I&#39;m 40. <br />
<br />
Andrew shivered as she shrank from her current 6’2” down to 6&#39;0&quot; and lost some weight. Any remaining masculine features vanished. She was left with a fit, trim, slim, and very pleasing body. Her body was now completely feminine. She looked like her ideal female version of the boy she had been just minutes ago. <br />
<br />
26. When you are a girl, what sort of libido will you have?<br />
<br />
Slightly higher than it is now, my erogenous zones are more sensitive than the average girl, and I have much more pleasurable orgasms than I ever did as a guy.<br />
<br />
“Okay last question.” she thought to herself.<br />
<br />
27. Final question. When you are a girl, what will your name be?<br />
<br />
Anna Sophia Kuper, she wrote, almost like a signature.<br />
<br />
After she wrote her name, “If you want to have a happy life as a girl, pass this on to the next person. Boy or Girl, don&#39;t matter.” Appeared at the bottom of the page.<br />
<br />
“Will leaving it on the desk for the next class be okay?” Anna wondered.<br />
<br />
The word &quot;Yes&quot; appeared below the statement.<br />
<br />
That was a clear answer, so she folded up the quiz and placed it on the empty desk next to her just as the class was wrapping up. Eager to see herself in a mirror, she clumsily scooped up her backpack, which hadn&#39;t changed. Her new body would take some getting used to. She left the classroom and almost walked straight into the Men&#39;s Restroom directly across the hall, but quickly remembered and walked down the hall towards the Women&#39;s. Even walking felt different, her new hips and legs changed her gait slightly, and being slightly shorter made the hall seem taller. <br />
<br />
As she entered the bathroom and saw herself in the mirror, she couldn&#39;t help but smile. She felt overjoyed, almost to the point of tears, but kept her composure since there was another girl exiting a stall. Everything about her new body looked and felt perfect to her. She was still the same person, but her body had finally gone through the change she wanted. She was relieved that her mind and memories were unchanged, apart from the intelligence boost. Whoever had given her that note had made her dream come true.</p>
