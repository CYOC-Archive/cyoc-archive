<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The screen split apart, forming a divider in the middle as it separated the boyfriends apart from one another. Symbolizing the division in the household, and the abandonment of their former relationship.<br />
<br />
—————————————<br />
The mist shifted its scent to herbal deodorant, as a new channel came into play. Loud cheers sounded, and a gunshot was fired, as with a SPLASH! The triathletes swan into play, focusing on the male ones as tight shots of asian athletes in skintight suits, swimming across the pool were...so good...<br />
<br />
He had to-<br />
<br />
GRAB!<br />
PUMPUMPUMPUMPUMP!!! <br />
<br />
Jackson began jerking off, the hypnotic scent mixed with strapping muscles were too much, grabbing through his boxers as his ripped jeans, gothic boots alongside those ridiculous belt accessories, were tossed aside by mechanical arms, never to be seen again. As he focused on those shots of the men swimming.<br />
<br />
&#24555;...&#24555;...<br />
<br />
Strange symbols flashed across the screen in intervals, not knowing why-but his hormones flourished younger and younger, down to a man who just reached his 20s. <br />
<br />
His Asian-ness had to be rekindled, as his skin took on a very familiar yellowish hue to a certain Liong, before tanning it gently as the men got out from the pool, pushed aside their googles and BLAZE was the heat of the marathon.<br />
<br />
The hotness escalated into the room as he felt so hot, both literally and sexually, that with the assistance of the machine, they ripped off the monster tank top from existence. He was drenched with sweat, but had to keep pulling.<br />
<br />
Pull!<br />
<br />
His biceps swelled thickly from the pulls, as he gave tougher tugs. His hands were rough, but...it felt...good, with those longer and tougher fingers that felt like they have been weightlifting and doing handstands for years.<br />
<br />
Its soooo good...<br />
<br />
“Faster...Faster...” <br />
<br />
He begged, as the runners ran even quicker, he felt out of breath as though running when them. Over a decade’s worth of exercise being struck into him as the sporty chinese deodorant covered up his musk...no, it was his musk. His veiny forearms tightened, meat was layered every inch upwards as his Shoulders spreading far apart, his muscular traps making way for the slabs of muscle intwining around his spinal chord as his skeleton had to react. From all the way down to his knees and feet, and up into his head, a 6ft 2 giant kicked back masturbating, sending even greater waves of pleasure as the athletes continued to run.<br />
<br />
He knew how to exercise, high sets and low reps, and do it regularly. He was not going to allow any of his classmates overtake him in any subject, especially anything to do with PE. <br />
<br />
He was still schooling after all, and a very important school and time of his life at that, University. The school’s regulations prohibited many things, one of which were tattoos, and like a chalkboard, the markings and traces of rebellion were bathed in deodorant, giving his back a pure clean slate, one that never saw detention his whole life.<br />
<br />
Yes, this asian man never got into trouble, definitely not. He wouldn’t even TALK BACK to his teachers.<br />
<br />
“Faster!!! Faster!!!”<br />
<br />
With the first change in personality, Jackson become more desperate. Gripping his dick and massaging his balls harder with his right hand, while pressing against his chest with the left. But that will prove fatal as with every touch of his chest, his fat percentage was inversely proportional to his muscle, abdominals crunching those Abs like numbers on a calculator, as his pectorals swelled up like a jock, solving the equation: He was Buff.<br />
<br />
Every pump, every rep, the top of everyone and everything. As he masturbated at the speed per second of the fastest athlete, watching his movements, and keeping up...needing to out speed him as his balls churned with adrenaline, his member girthing to an erect 8 inch. Black strips of hair replaced his old pubes, as they were neatly maintained.<br />
<br />
His attempts of rebellion, resistance to the process only speed it up, as with every jerk off, especially the ones intwined with personality changes, comes with a greater effect. Yes, he is NOT UNIQUE, he was exactly like his peers since young. Competitive yet respectful. But he was always the top of his batch and group, and that was what made him stand out. NOT by being REBELLIOUS.<br />
<br />
“K...Kuai dian! &#24555;&#28857;&#25289;! ”<br />
Hurry up...HURRY UP LA!<br />
<br />
Shots of the lead triathlete’s butt were shown, causing a JERK! From the half sofa as it stretched to a long single bed next to the wall. His legs resting to the edges of the bedding, lying perfectly straight as he never tosses and turns in his sleep.<br />
<br />
It was without a doubt that the rest of the room started to develop from those strands of rocker memorabilia. A long study table with books, a proud book shelf and closet filled with sets of ‘Chinese approved’ clothing, the workout equipment and huge space in the center for his stretches and meditation, and of course, numerous of 1st place trophies just below the television monitor.<br />
<br />
Most notably however, was the picture on the table side desk next to him, the picture of the rocker group. It shifted to solely him in a suit and tie, receiving his honours for his University medical science degree, his parents standing proudly next to him alongside the Chancellor, his favourite teacher and a few others. The only oddity in the picture would be how Jackson looked, aside the upper torso, as the Mist began to correct that, by correcting him.<br />
<br />
Legs kept congested together, rubbing against his balls as his freedom was limited despite the large open space just next to it, but it became manageable with the toughening and tightening of the calves and thighs. Briefly noting his favourite exercise bike next to the TV, his large legs exploited the tight space, churning bicycle reps in order to tense up his arousal, as drool trailed from his lips.<br />
<br />
Less freedom meant more focus on whatever he can do. Which is why he was always the best runner and cycler in his school.<br />
<br />
The leading man started to cycle, way ahead of the others as he was focused regardless of his lead. Peddling similarly to the circular motions Jackson was doing with his legs, as his feet stretched wider beneath those socks, growing, RIPPPP! continued to do so until size 12s, as they get sealed up into waterproof jade green triathlon socks like the man’s....yeah, it was exactly like his.<br />
<br />
Close-up back-shots of the man’s ass reappeared, the stinging sensation never left his behind as it dug in DEEP! “UGH!” He yipped, like an...object placing there as a form of punishment instead of pleasure, slowly sliding out, the young man begging it to leave as his ass swelled thicker and harder like jock in the playback recording, almost out-as he remembered his dad did that when he was young so as to teach his son that HOMOSEXUALITY IS DISHONORABLE in the family. <br />
<br />
OUT!<br />
<br />
The invisible ruler was pulled out, as his steely buns clenched and sealed up the decade long discipline. Committing it to muscle memory, never let a man penetrate him...no matter the cost. Heh, how dishonorable can these millennials get? They should be raised the right way! Which is the traditional way!<br />
<br />
Still tugging his member, kneading beneath an aquatic turquoise jockstrap before sliding up and out as he was about to hit the climax. Grabbing the remote, fast forwarding to the end...the final race, with a lady dashing speedily behind him.<br />
<br />
How could he forget! His mistake! He was so focused on himself, he never noticed how hot and powerful the Female Athletes were!<br />
<br />
“Oh Mannnnnnn....” <br />
<br />
A stereotypical, asiantastic groan echoed the room, complaining but in a good way. Yes-he was always was good in many things. Martial arts, fencing, but a triathlon could show three of his expertise at once! But he never knew a girl could even get this far behind him on 2nd place.<br />
<br />
Yes, Jackson had experience topping and hollering with Watson. But in reality, Jia Xuan never had experience dating with a girl! Aside his vast textbook knowledge, he was as clueless as a Himbo when it comes to dating! He had to focus on his education and being top after all...<br />
<br />
He pressed his palm his thick neck, sliding upwards as it buzzed away the excessive hair that was only meant for girls! What? He is NOT GAY! As evident by the buzzed sides and back, with a slicked back conservative cut like his fathers. The Liong choice at that! Which looked neat whether its combed or dry. Plus with how strictly he abides to the school code since young, dye, much less gay purple dye, never graced his studios visage as it returned to a natural black.<br />
<br />
He was just like how father and mother raised him! Gone were all the traces of Caucasian, his jaw squared and was chiseled handsomely, as the goatee and aftershave disappeared like it did not belong. He was respectful, as the edges of piercing snapped off with the skin sealing up every blemish and trace of his former rebellion.<br />
<br />
He was CHINESE! As his lips thinned and flashed those charming pearly whites, his taste buds could still taste his favorite chinese delicacy, as his nose angling and adjusting to match that of his father, as his cheekbones rose cheekily like that of his mother who never gave up trying to get his father to smile.<br />
<br />
And her determination plus his father’s strictness were what drove him onward. This is not a challenge for the man who was always top of the class! Plus, he always wanted score some chicks for a long time! What better than a hot female, asian athlete who scores the same values! <br />
<br />
His brows furrowed ever his scholar bearing forehead, eyes narrowed as his vision blurred, the metallic remnants connected at from his ears to his nose, developing thick black frames around his eyes with a transparent glass, increasing his clarity as his epicanthic folds filled up to the brim, and a pair of prescription glasses cleared any doubt that she was his girl.<br />
<br />
“Distinction in sex cummin’ right up!!!”<br />
<br />
Yes, he always scored distinction, and that always made his father proud. And you know what! He actually liked when his father disciplined him, helped toughened up the competitive spirit in him. Doctor? Athlete? Why not both?<br />
<br />
And this lady, his future wife, will be so proud of him too...and not just how he was going to raise their kids but...thinking about ploughing her, its just-<br />
<br />
Too<br />
“&#21834;&#21834;&#21834;...&#21834;&#21834;&#21834;...”<br />
Much!!!<br />
“&#21834;&#21834;&#21834;&#21834;&#21834;&#21834;...!!!!!!!!!!!”<br />
<br />
Liong Jia Xuan came in mandarin, as his eyes flashed an intelligent but innocent dark brown, like the pure-chinese son he is. Practicing his sexual appetite for her.<br />
<br />
“&#22909;...&#65292;&#24456;&#22909;!”<br />
<br />
It was a good workout. A very good workout. The 6ft 2 Asian Jock smiled satisfyingly with his daily fantasies of hot asian chicks, mostly at his future wife, who came seconds behind him and gave him a firm competitive handshake. <br />
<br />
Wiping away the semen from his 8 inch dick as he felt energized more than ever! He was going to win her TODAY! But better safe than sorry, you can never have enough warm ups...<br />
<br />
“LIONG JIA XUAN!”<br />
<br />
How can he forget, father is calling him! Despite just being past his teens, the 20 year old would not disobey his dad in spite of the desire to go for another practice run. Nevertheless, this would be a good opportunity to tell father the good news on his future wife, he was ordered to find one by the end of this week, and he’s determined to fulfill that command.<br />
<br />
Father will be so proud!<br />
<br />
Cheekily grinning at his reflection, as he swiftly dressed himself a pure white suit and a navy blue stripped tie. Shutting off the television, the triathlete slid on a pair of dress shoes and sauntered out his bedroom door, never looking back.<br />
<br />
Besides, this meeting was important, like all the others, it wasn’t just him and dad talking about his marriage life-</p>
