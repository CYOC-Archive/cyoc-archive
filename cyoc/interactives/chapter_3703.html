<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John rode his horse back to the main farm stable and after a quick supper said he's go for a walk. Walk turned to a run and in time he came to the Thomas farm.
<br />

<br />
Dusk was becoming night as he played with a basement window that Jarred and he had used many a time. Jarred alway came home late and snuck into the house through this unlocked window.
<br />

<br />
Moving quietly he reached the door to the kitchen.  As he opened it slowly the kitchen was dark. Stepping softly across the tile floor he peered into the living room. Mister Thomas was asleep on the couch with his back toward the room. So John walked ever so softly to the stairs.  The steps would not creak if he stepped closed to the sides and soon he stood in Jarred's room.
<br />

<br />
Looking around the silver buckle glowed of it's power as it lay on the endtable by the bed. John pocketed the buckle and began his return to the basement window. As he peered a look at mister Thomas the phone which was next to the couch rang.
<br />

<br />
Scared as Hell he took off on a run to the kitchen and then to the basement. &quot;JARRED is that you,&quot; called mister Thomas seeing a blur of someone running out of the room.
<br />

<br />
John crawled out the transom window and ran to the roadside. Walking fast and soon broke into a run he headed for home.
<br />

<br />
It was all of five miles to home and a dark night with no moon light left him itching to get home.  &quot;Darn it's almost as far to go home as Jarred is out in the East pasture,&quot; John thought.  Walking along the road was without cars and the cool dampness was settling down.
<br />

<br />
When John had left home the sun was still out and the air was a warm 70 degrees.  Cold and damp he began to shiver, &quot;Blast, it's getting cold Jarred won't feel the cold in his bullish fur. I wish I had fur  to keep me warm like my friend Jarred the bull!&quot;
<br />

<br />
John felt the silver buckle vibrate but he thought nothing of it. Walking along he felt a warmth and comfort like he was wearing a coat. Stopping he was tired and gave a good stretch as he rubbed the sleep from his eyes.  &quot;What!&quot;  John stopped rubbing his face and looked at his hands.
<br />

<br />
Fingers, hands, arms, covered in thick black Angus bull like hair. Pulling up his pant leg he saw even in the dark thick black hair. John began to strip as he stood on the roadside. &quot;Good Lord,&quot; he exclaimed as he stood in naked beauty!  Hair thick black bovine hair covered his total body head to feet, how he wondered?
<br />

<br />
Suddenly he thought of his wish to be warm and now he wore bullish hair like Jarred. &quot;Wild, this is really wild that buckle has magic power!&quot;  John got dressed and continued to walk along. &quot;I know how Jarred did it he wished and it came true, this is neat!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Walking along he neared the farm and home. A group of cows stood at the fence huddled together. &quot;I wonder if this hair is as thick as a cows', thought John.&quot; Stepping close to the fence he jumped it and the shock fence too. As he walked to touch and feel the cow's hair he saw a car coming down the road.
<br />

<br />
It was a farm truck and it pulled to the side of the road. John knelt down between the cows.
<br />

<br />
&quot;I tell you I saw something jump the fence and it looked like a man, said the ranch foreman coming from his late night card game.&quot;
<br />

<br />
John was scared, mostly because he was now covered in hair. How could he explain it, no way! Just then the cows moved and John fell backwards into a fresh pile from a cow. He moaned as it smeared his face which drew the look of the men at roadside.
<br />

<br />
John feared he was caught and let his fear guide his tongue. &quot;Wish I could hide till morning like Jarred looks all day!&quot;
<br />

<br />
The foreman stepped up to the fence and flashed his flashlite over the standing cows. The beam hit John in the face. It was so bright that he knew he was caught so he got up and just stood there.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Nope, I don't see anybody said the foreman, just some cows and a very satisfied bull.&quot;
<br />

<br />
The men crossed the road and got in the truck and drove off. John stood by the fence stunned he was not caught. Lifting a leg he tried to cross the fence.
<br />

<br />
ZAP, went the shock fence and John let out a scream. As the pain died down he remember the sound he made and it was more a bellow than scream. Looking at his leg he stared in horror. The leg he lifted to jump the fence was a foreleg. A foreleg of a black Angus bull, him!
<br />

<br />
Turning in circles he viewed his form with wild sensual delight. &quot;I'm a bull, a real nice bull, he thought.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Nice bull indeed thought a cow as she stepped close and turned her juicy cunt to John's bullish nose. The smell of her scent drove the bullish desire wild. Johncould not help or hold himself back. In a jump he straddled her flanks and pushed his errect bull cock deep into her sex.
<br />

<br />
Thrusting he unloaded his balls into a bovine cow. As he dismounted the scent of all the cows began to give wild beastly desires. The bull body and his now animal brain won over any will he had to wish to stop. John mounted cow after cow till the glint of sunlight caught his bulls eye.</p>
