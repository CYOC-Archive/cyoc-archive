<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>{Some parts may be darker, but that&#39;s just because i find it interesting and refreshing to write variety to get the writer&#39;s block out. I plan on some affection and love scenes building up relationships with any of the survivors later on or if any characters seem of note.. The land may be harsh, and punishing.. But that can make it all the more rewarding to find a worthwhile love within it&#39;s world... When that time comes... } </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your story begins the moment you entered the doorway of Dimensions.. For a moment. Your eyes went blank.. The whole world turned black. All cries, became silent. For a moment, the cries of darkness overtook you.. Horrible shrieking.. Followed by laughter.. You could see a world where great problems existed.. Yet also love. A King, kissing the lips of a loved queen who caressed his arm as they stood proudly, smiling within the kingdom.. A flash of blood, as all that was cherished, was ripped away.. A tribe of humans, invaded by the Lycans screaming and running away.. it appeared.. Flickering for a few moments.. And then time began to unwind what seemed to be a few minutes.. The caress of the smiling King&#39;s face falling upon the queen. A whisper emerged.. &quot;.. I.. Always loved you.. This, might be our end. Please.. Keep our child safe.. Call the guards of the city.. They must.. Defend all we hold dear against the invasion... Our city stands at the forefront of all humankind against these beasts. You.. You have to protect them.. Even if i fall.... Every day i spent.. I spent thinking of you. Cherish them.. Save them..&quot; The king&#39;s voiced cracked.. And then.. The noises faded.. Then.. The light...  You were gone.. Cast into the void.. for just a minute. Twisting and tumbling inside of a brand new world&#39;s call.<br />
<br />
Time passed, you could feel your body fade away as it began to change, subtly as your flesh melted, reshaped, molded and grew and shrank... Unknowingly.. Then a wisp of what seemed to be your thoughts seemed to wander through the sky.. Catching a glimpse of what seemed to be a curious mind of person you would trade lives with.. A simple, but curious mind from a magical world that would grow to find themselves amazed by the wonders of technology, the freshness of it all, before the dull dreariness set in. Your life.. would be to reborn as you took over, his life now your own, and your own past earthly life in the modern world, his to take.<br />
<br />
You drifted.. Until you felt your consciousness blip again. You blinked and you saw a pink hand in front of you.. It looked strangely familiar,, and yet different.. Soft trails of magic sparked from your hand.. reminding you of a time when you were a child and rubbing a blanket to see electricity crackle from your fingertips like a magician.. Except this time.. You could feel your soul resonating with it... A strange feeling.. Almost instinctual told you to trust it.. <br />
<br />
You held your hand out.. A weak aura of shapeless magic, forming as if like putty.. It formed a soft, smoky trail as your hands felt soft wisps of smoke filled gusts drift as you wondered what was to come..<br />
<br />
Your gift.. In this world that i never had the chance to create.. Would be the spirit blade.<br />
By focusing within your hands, grasping on the air, and closing your eyes and focusing on your internal strife, hopes, and fears.. You could conjure up a ethereal blade, as light as air, as thick as smoke.. That could cut wounds or choose to heal. It took on the form of solidified smoke.. As if smoke, frozen in place, to create a pronged ghostly blade.<br />
<br />
By focusing your emotions upon it, you could feel your very own body changing in perhaps subtle ways, not quite physical yet, but quite mental. Your breathing focused, your eyes opening wider as you felt your heart beating stronger.. Faster..<br />
<br />
The fresh air of this new world was crisp and earthly fresh.. The scent of falling rain seemed delightful.. But something else seemed dark. The sky of darkness fell upon a beastly realm.. You looked with a soft shudder. Inside of your brand new, delightsome world was a hollow shadow.. The horrors of a world where Bloodlust, savagery.. and inhuman desires plagued the dark filths of the depravity of humankind.. The Nightfang Lycans.. <br />
<br />
Nightfang Lycans were every ounce of purest monstrosity, misery, savagery and raw power that the horrors of your childhood tales could have ever known.. Bloodthirsty, instinct driven semi feral werewolves.. their only virtue was they still stood on two feet in beastly manner.. But their blood ripping claws, their lust to corrupt, breed, rape or kill was no light concern...<br />
<br />
These were not the lycans that gave you a little bite and let you go free.. These Lycans were the dark fantasies of a creature losing all control.. A human losing everything that left them human.. Passion.. control.. love.. Care.. Only animalistic desires with a towering 8&#39; Foot to 9&#39;  Foot high frame.. Most human males would only stand about chest height next to one even at 6&#39; Feet tall... Your eyes would just barely come to grip with their chest&#39;s nipple.. their hardened stone cold abs underlined by their ability to rip unwary adventurer&#39;s apart into corpses as easily as twist bone and flay them.. They had blood ripping claws with clawed bone tips 8 inches long on gaping, boney claws with hands the size of baseball mitts  with clawtips that ripped through flesh as easily as it could push one down and take what it wanted.. <br />
Submitting against them.. if you even survived.. Would have to be at their own mercy.. You would have to fight for survival and play your cards right.. If you wanted to stay with your pride intact. Or swallow it, push it down, in order to survive? <br />
<br />
A soft chill went down your throat.. Inside.. You told yourself you would survive.. But did you know, really? Surely??? The chapters of any new story never ended on the page of the beginning.. But.. Could that change at any moment? Was your life of any importance to these people, a peasant before the world, called as a guardian to a dying king? You had just barely been introduced to this world... Surely it would be a waste to die so soon.. But inside.. A gut wrenching feeling tore at you.. Life or death.. You had to be there if you wanted to defend these people... You did not know them yet.. but a old voice inside, the presence of the voice inside whispered inside to save them.. But could you risk more than your life, if something else happened against the mercy of the savage beasts!?!?  If you fell instead, prey to the beasts who plagued Darkcrawl Crest, the wolf infested dark land to the west? <br />
<br />
Would death be the reward.. Or would you be pinned down.. pushed and pinned.. raped and claimed like another bitch in heat as a giant throbbing lycan dick penetrated you and caused  infection to spread as just another werebeast of the tribe.. <br />
<br />
<br />
You shivered, your blood running cold.. The tales urged caution.. Lycanthropy spread through touch.. and the tales of lycans were that there were prolific breeders with crimson knotted cocks just as large as they were tall.. Even males were rumored to not be safe against a lusty lycan if tables were to fall down.. Some considered it a fate.. more merciful than death.. other&#39;s worse.. The only assurance was any prey they fucked was usually kept alive... <br />
<br />
Those who resisted.. Often found a simple and bloody end.. like any other adventurer to fall before a savage and bloodthirsty beast.. Others.. Would have to learn to live within their curses, or even help with the infected survivors cope.... <br />
<br />
You had to go save the others.. Or at least, spare and take the burden from the others to have as many survive as possible.. You had your spirit blade whisper along with you.. Conjuring up into the air as it shot spears of flames as your awakening spirit grew alongside you to protect yourself.. You had a chance.. But would you choose to spend it?</p>
