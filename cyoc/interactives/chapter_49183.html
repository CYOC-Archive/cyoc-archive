<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The DVD he selected was one of several that did not have proper covers, instead they were in plain, white paper cases with labels written on them in marker.<br />
<br />
Kyle smiled sadistically at Jennifer, &quot;I'd like to share some of my special collection with you. They don't have much in the way of plot, of course, but they're still pretty interesting. This one right here is one of my favorites.&quot;<br />
<br />
He held it up so that she could see what was written on the paper.<br />
<br />
'pregnant asian group bath' was what the crudely scrawled words said and Jennifer scowled.<br />
<br />
Her obvious distaste only made Kyle laugh, &quot;The title isn't that creative, I'll admit, but I think you'll like it once it gets started.&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as the DVD started it was obvious that it was not professionally produced, the camera was slightly shaky and from the very start it was nothing more than a group of about a dozen Japanese looking women together in what looked like a spa. They were all attractive enough, small and slender, with cute round faces and dark, seductive eyes, and they were all also heavily pregnant. Their perky little breasts were swollen and heavy with milk and their round stomachs looked even larger on their delicate bodies.<br />
<br />
Kyle was really enjoying himself, judging by the way he was working on his massive member, but Jennifer could not help but notice that he was paying as much attention to her as he was to the movie.<br />
<br />
Trying to hide her disgust, she made a point of looking away from him, and soon found herself watching the movie for lack of any other distraction.<br />
<br />
She watched as two of the women began to massage each other, and, thanks to the curse she found that she was actually getting turned on by it. One of her hands slid its way between her legs while the other went to her breasts, which were beginning to feel strangely warm.<br />
<br />
The women in the video were now gently rubbing each other's breasts, and Jennifer let out a little gasp as milk began to flow from the breasts of the women.<br />
<br />
Unable to help herself, Jennifer orgasmed when the two began to nurse each other. For some reason the idea of another woman sucking on her nipples seemed incredibly erotic to her at the moment and in response she rubbed her breasts even harder, rolling her nipples between her fingers and feeling their firmness.<br />
<br />
Under such attention, her breasts began to feel, for lack of a better way of putting it, tight, like something was pressing on them from within, but she failed to notice it through the haze of pleasure she was in. There was also a strange warmth emanating from the pit of her stomach, but she ignored it, fixated on the women in the video.<br />
<br />
There were women nursing each other, women rubbing each other's big, pregnant stomachs, women fingering themselves and each other, and women engaged in all manner of erotic acts.<br />
<br />
Though she never would have found such things arousing in the past, she found herself wondering what it would be like to rub one of those girl's big, sexy bellies, or lick and suck at those dark, perky nipples, tasting the warm milk that beaded on their tips. She rubbed at her breasts with such intensity that it almost hurt, trying to pretend that someone was sucking on them while running their hands over her tight, swollen belly.<br />
<br />
The video was short, no more than forty minutes, but during the course of it, Jennifer must have orgasmed at least three times. It was hard for her to tell for sure as lost in sensual feelings as she had been, all she knew was that when it was all over her breasts were hot and tender and her stomach felt strange.<br />
<br />
As she regained focus on the situation she could hear Kyle panting.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was intense,&quot; he laughed, &quot;And I could tell you liked it too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's only because of that horrible curse,&quot; she retorted, crossing her arms over her chest, only to become aware of a wetness there.<br />
<br />
Looking down at herself, she saw that there were twin wet patches on her shirt over her breasts and that her shirt had been pushed up by her swollen stomach. Unable to believe what she was seeing, she brought her hands to her stomach and felt its round firmness. It looked as though somehow during the course of the video she had become nine months pregnant.<br />
<br />
Kyle laughed even harder at her shock, &quot;Come on, don't you think that's hot?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; she cried, her hands still on her stomach, as she marveled at the feeling of heaviness there, &quot;What did you do to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
She tried to stand up, and nearly lost her balance because of the change to her center of gravity. Her stomach felt so very big and her breasts sat heavily against her chest, tender and full of milk. In an attempt to ease the pain, she rubbed at them and shuddered at how good it felt. Milk began to flow from her nipples, soaking the front of her shirt with its delightful warmth.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is terrible! I...I...&quot; she looked down at herself again, lifting her shirt so that she could remove her soaked bra. Without the support her breasts felt even heavier and she cupped her hands under them to alleviate some of the weight, flicking her thumbs over her big, dark nipples as she stared down at the curve of her stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please just let me go home!&quot; she whimpered, tears flowing from her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know, maybe one more video...&quot; Kyle grinned most evily as Jennifer fell to her knees at his feet, sobbing and begging.</p>
