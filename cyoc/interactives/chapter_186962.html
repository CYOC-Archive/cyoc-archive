<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jamie scouted ahead for the new satyr Nate as they made their way through the streets to her witchy aunts&#39; house. She would run ahead a ways and quickly return to let Nate know the coast was clear.  They had been lucky so far and not seen a soul. The journey for Nate was becoming more difficult. The transformation into a satyr had seemed to send his senses into overdrive. His goatish nose was assaulted by a myriad of scents he couldn&#39;t identify unless he really concentrated. His caprine ears twitched as they picked up sounds beyond the range of human hearing. Nate also felt restricted in the clothes he was wearing. He felt a growing part of himself wanting to simply remove them and keep going. However enough of his human will remained to keep them on as he followed Jamie. The duo stopped crouching behind a clump of thick bushes before a residential area.<br />
&quot;Wait here,&quot; said Jamie, &quot;This is the stretch with the least amount of cover. I&#39;ll be gone for a little bit, but let me run ahead and see if I can&#39;t find a safer route to my aunts&#39; house or maybe go and borrow some invisibility magic from them. I&#39;ll try to be back quickly.&quot;<br />
Before Nate could offer any affirmation or rejection of the plan, Jamie shot off like a bolt in the night leaving Nate hiding in the bushes. <br />
Since Jamie had left and Nate was confident he could hear or smell her returning he gave into his instincts and shed his human clothes. The warm night air felt wonderful on his skin and exposed cock. Nate took a deep breath taking in his new sweet and earthy satyr sent. As he was taking himself in the wind shifted briefly and his nostrils suddenly caught a scent not too dissimilar to his own, and It was close and coming closer. The scent grew thicker and Nate&#39;s ears twitched as he heard someone come around the corner and towards the bushes he was hiding among. Nate could tell this scent wasn&#39;t Jamie, unfortunately due to the wind change he could no longer smell her. Nate&#39;s fuzzy caprine ears twitched as he heard this earthy and sweet smelling stranger getting closer to his hiding place. As it got closer Nate could feel an unwilling erection forming between his hairy thighs.<br />
&quot;Not now,&quot; Nate thought to himself. He didn&#39;t know what to do. Should he run from this figure or simply hope Jamie would get back in time to rescue him. Before he could make a decision the owner of the captivating scent yelled out:<br />
&quot;You can come out you know, a male voice said, &quot;I&#39;m not going to hurt you. In fact you and I have quite a bit in common kid.&quot;<br />
Whoever this person was he clearly knew Nate was in the bushes so there was no point in hiding. Nate wearily peaked out from his hiding spot to where this new figure was standing. Suddenly the sweet earthy scent made sense to Nate. Illuminated in what little nighttime light there was around stood the visage of a satyr like Nate. <br />
&quot;I knew I smelled a new boy,&quot; said the satyr. Nate couldn&#39;t quite tell in the darkness, but he thought he could see this new satyr smile. &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot; the new satyr asked. <br />
&quot;Nate,&quot; he nervously replied. <br />
&quot;My name is Max.&quot; replied the mystery satyr.<br />
Although this new satyr, Max, seemed friendly enough Nate was still nervous. He kept wishing Jamie would return to at least help bolster his confidence.She was used to dealing with magical creatures, Nate had only been one for about half an hour. <br />
&quot;You&#39;re waiting for that witch right?&quot; asked Max the mystery satyr very matter of factually. &quot;I know she&#39;s probably your friend, but I don&#39;t think she&#39;s going to be able to help you get a handle on what you are now. I think I can help you though.&quot;<br />
&quot;How can you help me?&quot; asked a still nervous Nate.<br />
&quot;Well most importantly I&#39;m a satyr like you so I know firsthand what you&#39;re going through and can help you handle it. Though probably most importantly I can take you to others of our kind here on campus.<br />
&quot;There are other satyrs on campus?&quot; inquired Nate.<br />
  &quot;Oh yeah there are a few of us here,&quot; replied Max. &quot;You could think of us like an underground fraternity. We&#39;re actually having a party right now. I&#39;m sure everyone would love to meet a new cutie like you.&quot;  <br />
Nate felt his cock quiver in excitement a little when he heard Max call him a cutie. Even though he didn&#39;t know this person Nate could feel himself being drawn towards Max and the opportunity to meet more people like himself. But what about Jamie? Should he really run away with a stranger over his best friend just because the stranger is a satyr? Nate didn&#39;t have his phone so it wasn&#39;t like he could call and ask her, and she had been away for some time. <br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about the witch, kid,&quot; stated Max as though he could read Nate&#39;s mind. &quot;You can always tell her what happened later and I&#39;m sure she&#39;d understand. <br />
Max wasn&#39;t entirely wrong. Jamie had always been a very understanding person. I&#39;m sure she would understand not passing up the opportunity to meet other satyrs so soon after becoming one.  <br />
&quot;All right,&quot; stated a still slightly nervous Nate, &quot;I&#39;ll go with you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Excellent!&quot; exclaimed Max as he gave a slight hop of excitement on his goat legs. &quot;Follow me then. Our spot is close, oh and leave the clothes. <br />
Nate did as he was told and followed naked after the new satyr Max. Nate couldn&#39;t get a very good look at Max in the Dark, but it looked like he was a bit older than Nate. Max had dark curly hair, a bit more muscle, and slightly larger horns than Nate. Nate could also tell Max sported some decent body hair on his arms and chest.<br />
Max led him just a few blocks away to a small normal looking house like any normal college students would live in.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s around the back,&quot; stated Max.<br />
Nate followed as Max led him to what looked like the doors of an old tornado shelter you&#39;d find in the mid-west except there was no lock on the door. <br />
&quot;This is the spot,&quot; stated Max, &quot;this door is special it can only be opened by our kind. Go ahead and give it a try kid.&quot;<br />
Nate didn&#39;t know how much he liked being referred to as &quot;kid&quot; by Max the satyr, but he did as he was told and opened the seemingly heavy doors without issue revealing a set of stairs to what looked like a large well lit room.<br />
&quot;Here we go,&quot; said Max as he led them both down the stairs into the seemingly magical satyr cellar. Once he hit the bottom of the stairs Nate saw...</p>
