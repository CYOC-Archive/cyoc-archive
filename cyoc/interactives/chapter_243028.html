<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer won the mental struggle inside her mind and decided to not to interfere with Frank’s and Silvia’s love making. When the foreplay ended the voices inside Jennifer got quieter. Jennifer had a clear view to what Frank and Silvia was doing but they weren’t able to see Jennifer because how busy and focused they both were. Jennifer had seen porn here and there but it was oddly exciting to peek behind the door frame and watch when when mother did it live.<br />
<br />
Jennifer felt ashamed that she might had been a little pervert by being so interest what her mother was doing in the living room but Jennifer didn’t care. Jennifer’s main goal was to make sure that Frank wouldn’t do anything suspicious after Silvia passes out. Jennifer felt it was important for her to see when Silvia’s vagina lips swallowed Frank’s cock’s tip inside her pussy and bit where Frank’s cock bopped up and down. Jennifer saw how Silvia got more sluggish and her mother’s movements looked odd. Jennifer didn’t know what was going on but when her mother fell on to the floor naked it was clear what had happened. Frank stood up and approached the bedroom. Jennifer wanted to hide but Frank had made sure that there were no spaces where Jennifer could hide her tiny body. She was essentially trapped.<br />
<br />
Frank opened the bedroom door and looked confused when Jennifer was standing in the middle of the bedroom waiting for him. Frank apologized for Jennifer that it took that long for the drug to affect Silvia and that he really struggled to keep his tiny men inside his balls. Jennifer didn’t know what to say as it felt like Frank was talking to Jennifer as if she was an adult. He mentioned how he couldn’t care less of Jennifer’s sister and instead found it more natural to be with Jennifer. Frank asked from Jennifer if she wanted to do it raw or use protection.<br />
<br />
Jennifer explained to Frank that there was a possibility that if he fucked her raw Silvia would know that they&#39;ve done it. Frank nodded his head and walked to his nightstand to grab a pack of condoms. Jennifer had to make sure that this was the only thing that worked the way she wanted. She didn&#39;t care what happened to her in the future. Jennifer couldn&#39;t say no to Frank so this was the best she could do. Jennifer couldn’t tell Frank the truth either. Frank&#39;s shock would would have sent her back in past even further. Still Jennifer didn’t want to have sex with Frank as it felt “wrong”. Jennifer wanted to post-pone it further but she couldn&#39;t. She wasn’t mentally ready to cross the line and it made her feel dirty. Jennifer gritted her teeth and decided to bare the consequences that was going to happen to her. Jennifer blamed the curse for the misery she was about to experience but what had to do this. To Jennifer this was the best outcome she could have wished for and she was going to take advantage of it.<br />
<br />
“Frank. Let me very clear with you about things that are bothering me.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah?”<br />
<br />
“First of all. I’m a virgin and I want us to be on the same page. I want you to say to me who I am and how old you think I am.”<br />
<br />
“You are Jennifer Smith. An eighteen year old high school student. I figured that long time ago that you are virgin. Even now you are shaking like crazy.”<br />
<br />
“I am?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah. You are. I heard from your sister how young you Smiths look. We talked about this for a long time. We are doing this the way you wanted. I don’t want your first experience be something you are going to regret.<br />
<br />
But that was it. Jennifer was going to regret her decision regardless what Frank wanted her to feel. Jennifer had to make sure that she wasn’t going to get pregnant as that was the thing what mattered the most to her. Jennifer laid herself on the bedroom and was mentally prepping herself for what she was going to do with Frank. This was it. There was no more going back from this rabbit hole once Frank was on top of her.<br />
<br />
“Frank. Let’s do this.”<br />
<br />
Jennifer felt emotional. She knew how wrong this was but she couldn’t say no to him. Jennifer didn’t want to wake up one day as a tween and be forced to go through the same emotions again. She had to hold her tears and not show her true feelings to Frank. If she let one of her tears from her eyes. It was all over. She allowed herself to cry when Frank didn’t see her face. Jennifer took her clothes off slowly and Jennifer begun to feel dread when she saw the massive meat that was going to go inside her. Jennifer’s arms and legs were trembling. She wanted to get over it and forget everything. She didn’t want to get fucked by a man that was twice old as she was but she had to in order to grow up older. The thought of her getting younger and having to go thought all the same emotions would had broken her tiny mind to even smaller pieces.<br />
<br />
Jennifer was completely naked on the bed and when Frank shuffled himself on top of her and put his cock inside a plastic wrap. Jennifer realized how the cock was going to break her. The adult sized big dick looked like a huge horse cock compared to Jennifer’s current size. Frank leaned forward to kiss Jennifer in mouth. Jennifer had to repeat in her mind that she was 18-year-old girl and there was nothing wrong with this. Jennifer was only smaller than usual and Frank thought that she was 18-year-old girl with a petite body. Jennifer had to discard the nugget of truth what was making her a nervous wreck. Jennifer couldn’t stop the trembling which made her whole body involuntarily twitch like crazy. The first time truly felt like a first time. The cocktail of emotions inside Jennifer’s brain were the same.<br />
<br />
When Frank slowly begun to insert this wooden pole inside Jennifer’s tiny hole. Jennifer’s whole body reacted with an awful jitter. The brain was screaming in terror while Jennifer tried to actively calm it down. Jennifer felt how sweaty she had become and how tense her body was. The stiff alien rod was getting deeper inside her body and it made Jennifer’s body go mad. Jennifer felt how quickly her mind got exhausted when she raised her legs up in the air. The first pull and push Jennifer felt was like a punch into her gut. Jennifer couldn’t stop her mouth from the letting the loudest moan she had ever made in her life.<br />
<br />
Jennifer felt how Frank’s cock twitched inside Jennifer’s vagina. Frank got more excited when Jennifer had moaned just now. It was like a blow from a bat straight into her head when Frank had pushed his cock down to her hole more than two times. Then it happened again. Another involuntary moan. Jennifer felt that her brain was filled to brim with dopamine. Jennifer’s brain chemistry was changing rapidly as the trembling stopped. The dread was dissipating. Jennifer felt more relieved when Frank begun to hump her insides in steady rhythm. Jennifer felt happiness and joy when her body had finally given in for the sensation.<br />
<br />
Jennifer’s surrounding begun to wobble as all the walls and objects turned into squiggly lines and mush. Jennifer’s vision slowly became blurry when everything around her lost it&#39;s color except for Frank on top of her. The time slowed down and Jennifer let out a moan. Frank replied to the moan with his grunts and suddenly the whole white bedroom space broke like glass on top of a snow globe. The glass shards broke the bedroom floor under Jennifer and turned the white space into a black space while the glass shards looked like stars. The bed where Jennifer laid was broken into pieces by the falling shards and she was forced to a freefall by gravity. Frank stayed in his place like a statue and didn&#39;t move at all while Jennifer was falling. She watched how Frank quickly became a small gray dot and vanished into the void above her. Jennifer turned around and wanted to see what was happening under her. She was falling down into the even darker void with the glass shards still following her. These shards looked like movies that were played in loop. When Jennifer looked at one of them she cold see herself inside them moving and doing things in fast motion. The snippet that Jennifer saw must have been weeks worth of activity. Some of the shards exploded into tinier pieces while others that fell with Jennifer stayed the same size. At some point Jennifer saw that a familiar looking single wide sized house that appeared under her. She was nosediving straight at it. Before Jennifer hit the roof of the house she closed her eyes and braced for the impact.</p>
