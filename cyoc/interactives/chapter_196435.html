<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meanwhile, back at Jeff’s family home, his brother Jared is lying in his bed deep in thought, ‘okay, now that I set Jeff’s mind to that of an eight-week-old puppy, what breed do I want him to be,’ he asks himself. After a while of thinking, the boy smiles, “a Labrador Retriever! Yes, that’s a great breed, they are intelligent and obedient dogs. They are also easy to train and one of the best family dogs,” he says to himself. Jared gets up from his bed and walks back into Jeff’s room, he sits down at Jeff’s computer and boots it up, “Jeff is to big to come across as a 8-week-old pup,” he mumbles to himself, “so, let’s bring him down to eight inches. Next, I’ll add his new name and make it so that he responds to his “old” name and his new name”. Jared opens the Chronivac and starts to edit Jeff’s stats, he sets the change to happen the second Jeff enters the house. The boy is about to shut off the computer as an idea pops into his head, “I should download the Chronivac on to my phone,” he says, “that way I’ll always be able to “fix” stuff any time,” so, that is what he does. After downloading the Chronivac to his phone, Jared turns Jeff’s computer back off, he then walks back to his room, grinning to himself, “I wonder when “Milo” will arrive,” he says with a giggle.<br />
<br />
As Jared is sitting in his room he hears the front door opening and closing, a second later he hears a terrified scream, “WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON!? WHY AM I SHRINKING,” the 10-year-old grins as he jumps up from his seat and hurries down the stairs. As he reaches the end of the stairs, he is just in time to see his “big” brother disappearing in a pile of clothes. Chuckling Jared kneels down and starts to dig through Jeff’s clothes until he spots his shrunken brother, “hey, Jeff,” he says with a grin.<br />
<br />
Jeff looks up and lets out a scream and tumbles backwards, falling over his old clothes as he sees his “little” brother towering over him, like a giant. “J-Jared? Wh-what happened,” he asks, “wh-why are you so b-big, and…,” Jeff trails off as he sniffs the air, “…why d-do you sm-smell so… so strange? It is… it is as if I have to… obey you”.<br />
<br />
Jared smirks, “well, bro,” he starts, “I used your Chronivac. I caused you to shrink, I set your hearing and smell to that of a dog and I made everyone think you are a dog”.<br />
<br />
Jeff can’t believe his ears, “WHAT! CHANGE ME BACK RIGHT AWAY,” the tiny human shouts.<br />
<br />
“QUIET, BOY,” Jared shouts back and Jeff falls silent, Jared grins, “why would I want to change you back? I am tired of you bossing me around, now I AM the one in charge, and you have to do what I say”.<br />
<br />
“B-but…,” Jeff starts.<br />
<br />
“Quiet, I have not allowed you to speak,” Jared says, “oh yeah, by the way, only I AM able to understand you. If you’d try to tell anyone, even our parents, they’ll only hear barking and dog noises coming out of your mouth”. Jeff is dumbfounded, his “little” brother smirks down at him, “we have a lot to do, let’s go to your room and start getting rid of those pesky clothes and human belongings”. Jared stands up and starts to walk towards the stairs, he senses that Jeff is not following him, so he turns around and says, “come, Milo”.<br />
<br />
Jeff suddenly feels his legs start to move as he starts to walk towards his brother, “wh-what? B-but my name is n-not Milo,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jared grins, “it is now,” he says, the boy bends down and picks his 20cm tiny brother up, “I’ll carry you up the stairs, a 8-week-young pup should not climb stairs. It’s bad for the joints”.<br />
<br />
Jeff lets out a squeak as his little brother picks him up without difficulty, “8-WEEKS-YOUNG,” he shouts, “JARED… STOP JOKING AROUND! THIS IS NOT FUNNY”.<br />
<br />
Jared starts to climb the stairs and walk towards Jeff’s room, “haha… who says I am joking? You’ll be MY DOG as long as I want you to be,” he says. The 10-year-old smirks evilly at Jeff, who gulps, “I am in charge now, you’d better get used to it”. When Jared enters Jeff’s room, he sets his miniature former big brother down and starts to open Jeff’s wardrobe.<br />
<br />
“Um… w-will I have to crawl around on all f-fours,” Jeff asks carefully.<br />
<br />
“Not at the moment,” Jared says over his shoulder as he starts pulling out Jeff’s clothes and throwing them on the floor. After Jared had emptied Jeff’s wardrobe, he turns to face Jeff, “Milo, go grab some big plastic bags and start filling them with those clothes,” he says. Again Jeff feels himself obeying, he tries with all his might to stop himself, but without success. Jared watches Jeff walk out the room with a evil grin on his face, “I can’t believe how perfect this works,” he says to himself.<br />
<br />
Jeff/Milo walks towards the small room next to the bathroom, the small human notices the door is a jar and assumes that Jared had already opened it, to make it “easy” for Jeff to fulfill the command. With tears in his eyes, Jeff watches as his tiny arms and hands stretch forward and grab the roll of plastic bags. ‘What have I done to deserve this,’ he asks himself as he walks back to his room.<br />
<br />
“Good boy, Milo,” Jared says, smirking, “now, fill the bags with the clothes and your belongings, including your laptop and phone”.<br />
<br />
Jeff lets out a whimper as he starts to stuff his clothes into the plastic bags, after all the clothes are stuffed into bags, Jeff walks over to his desk and looks up. “Man, I am so tiny,” he says, “there is no way I can reach my laptop”.<br />
<br />
“Let me get that then,” Jared says, he walks over and takes Jeff’s laptop and stuffs it into a bag. He then turns to Jeff, “now, where is your phone,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“It… it’s in my cl-clothes, which are st-still downstairs,” the small human says.<br />
<br />
Jared nods, “okay,” he says, “you be a good boy and stay”.<br />
<br />
Jeff watches Jared leave the room, taking the bags with him, ‘this is my chance to escape,’ he thinks to himself. He tries to move but no matter how hard he tries, it is as if he is glued to the spot, ‘master told me te stay, so me be good boy and stay,’ he suddenly hears a tiny voice in his mind. “Wh-what the…,” Jeff exclaims, “what the hell was that? D-do I have two minds,” he asks himself.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes, Jared returns, the moment Jared re-enters Jeff’s room, Jeff feels a strange overwhelming happiness erupting inside of him, the urge to run over to Jared and lick his face creeps up inside of him. Jeff feels his butt and hips start to violently shake back and forth, Jared notices and grins, “hehe… you seem happy to see me, eh Milo,” the boy asks.<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah… I d-don’t understand why though,” Jeff says, straining to get his body under control.<br />
<br />
Jared grins, “well, you are my pet,” Jared says, “you sense that I am your master. Dogs are always happy when their master is around or returns from somewhere”.<br />
<br />
“Bu-but… I am no dog,” Jeff says, “I… I don’t wanna be your pet”.<br />
<br />
Jared simply smirks, “well, you ARE my dog if you want to be or not,” he says, “now, I have thrown all your belongings into the trash,” he continues.<br />
<br />
“B-but… what will mom and dad say,” Jeff asks, “especially when seeing me like this”.<br />
<br />
Jared grins, “as I said before: you are just a dog in their as, and as far as they are concerned is they never had a son “Jeff”. I AM their only son, “Jeff the human” never existed”.<br />
<br />
“WHAT,” Jeff screams, “WHAT ABOUT SCHOOL… MY FRIENDS?!”<br />
<br />
Jared smirks, “oh, dogs don’t go to school and as for your buddies, well… they will see you as a dog, but still remember the human “Jeff”. They’ll assume that you are ill or that you have gone somewhere, they will not see you as a human, they will see you as a dog”.<br />
<br />
Jeff stands there, his eyes widen in fear, “wh-what have I done to deserve this,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Jared smirks, and simply says, “you have been mean to me. You always bossed me around, you called me names”. The boy walks over to his former brother and kneels down, he reaches out a hand and starts to stroke Jeff’s head, “don’t worry, Milo,” he says with a smirk, “I’ll take care of you and you’ll become a great dog. Now, we need to get you to the vets, you need your shots and you have to get chipped”. Jared picks jeff up and carries him down the stairs and out the house.<br />
<br />
Jeff starts to struggle violently, but Jared held him tight as he walks down the street, “THE VET,” Jeff shouts, “I AM NOT A DOG! I DON&#39;T WANT TO GO TO THE VETS! YOU ARE OUT YOUR DAMN MIND,” passersby stare at Jared and his barking “dog”.<br />
<br />
“Your dog needs obedience school,” one man says.<br />
<br />
“Get your damn dog under control,” a woman says.<br />
<br />
Jared simply replies, “he is still very young,” and, “no worries, I plan to take him to an obedience school. Is there one you could recommend,” he asks the man.<br />
<br />
The man looks at Jared and his “dog”, which seems to looks terriefied but the man shrugs it off as he answers, “Hand in paws, is a very good obedience school. They treat the dogs with respect but sternly”.<br />
<br />
Jared smiles, “thanks, I look them up,” he says and continues on his way, “and as for you, Milo,” he says sternly, “you can call yourself lucky that you are still human, but I can change that if you want to”.<br />
<br />
Jeff/Milo gulps, “n-no...,” he says quietly in defeat, realizing he has no chance of escape.<br />
<br />
“Good,” Jared says, smiling.</p>
