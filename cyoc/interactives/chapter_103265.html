<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Clark?!&quot; Guy asked desperately. <br />
&quot;Guy!? I&#39;ve been looking all over for you! Where are you!?&quot;<br />
&quot;You won&#39;t believe me if i tell you. Can you come over?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure! I&#39;ll be there in a bit - I&#39;m in Chinatown now and...&quot;<br />
&quot;WHAT? NO! Stay away from that place, come here right now man!&quot;<br />
&quot;What the fuck? Ok, fine. I&#39;ll get there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Guy hung up and immediately got naked. He saw himself in the mirror just to make sure nothing had changed in the last couple of minutes. He was confused, angry and a little bit turned on by what he experienced. The transformation was such a rush but he sure as hell did not need to become a 700+ fuck blubber for Cray again. And from what he remembered Cray had also gained fat, but not as much as he did, he also remembered everything else and felt like taking a cold shower again.  He didn&#39;t know who Cray was or whether he even was using a condom when he went in. A million thoughts ran through is mind as he waited for Clark.<br />
<br />
A knock on the door interrupted him. He hastened to the bathroom to wrap a towel around his waist and opened the door for Clark. <br />
<br />
- Guy! I&#39;ve been looking for you, man. Where&#39;ve you been?...<br />
Guy stood there, with a blank expression on his face. <br />
- Are you alright - asked Clark, as he made himself in, and hugged his friend. Guy immediately latched onto Clark and hugged him with all his strength.<br />
- Guy! Dude, watch it, you&#39;re going to break me like a twig, big bear. <br />
Guy started sobbing, then Clark realised that something had gone awry. His friend had gone through something, and he was going to find out now. Struggling to caress Guy&#39;s head, he whispered &quot;Guy, you&#39;re safe. I&#39;m here for you&quot; as Guy&#39;s hug started to soften. Clark held his hand and locked the door behind him, then proceeded to walk Guy to the couch where he sat down with him.<br />
<br />
- I know something happened, Guy. I know it was bad. You&#39;re not like this. We  don&#39;t have to talk about it now, but when we do we will talk. For now, let me make you some tea.<br />
- I...<br />
- Yes? - Clark asked, calmly. <br />
- I don&#39;t want to talk now. Please, just hold me.<br />
<br />
Soon enough they both sat on the couch hugging each other. Clark was dwarfed by Guy. His 5&#39;7&quot;, 130 lb athletic frame was no match for the 190 lb 5&#39; 10&quot; bodybuilder. Never the less he sat with him and held him. Just like Guy had done before for him. It was some time before Clark decided to go to the bathroom, and Guy soon followed. Clark didn&#39;t mind, so they made small talk while they were there. He figured making Guy talk would help him loosen up. Eventually it did. Guy came clean to Clark about Cray, and what had happened. And to Guy&#39;s surprised, Clark believed him. Having already seen a guy going from fat to bodybuilder in mere minutes he testified and delivered his experience as well. Already suspicious, he knew Guy was probably referring to the same person. Clark zipped up and turned around to face Guy, who was standing at the bathroom doors frame, with just a towel covering him. Clark was at awe of his friend, but he had his qualms given the situation. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s get you dressed up, man&quot; he said. They both walked into Guy&#39;s bedroom. Clark picked up some stuff and left it on the bed. &quot;I&#39;m going to be outside fixing you a cup of tea, ok?&quot; - Clark said. &quot;No! Wait! It&#39;s fine. Just stay here. I... I don&#39;t mind&quot; - Guy replied. Clark being there meant he felt safer, his friend was there and he didn&#39;t want to be with anyone but him at that time.<br />
He watched Guy get dressed, seeing his muscular body flex and stretch as he got dressed. His veiny arms stretching his t-shirt sleeves. Clark lusted for Guy today, more than before for some reason.<br />
<br />
They sat down and drank tea, Guy&#39;s short were leading Clark&#39;s eyes towards his massive quads and hamstrings, while his bulge sat there, massive. Guy looked at Clark, as Clark snapped out of it he gazed up and saw Guy in the eye. Staring at each other Guy approached Clark and kissed him. No hesitation on either party, as Clark approached squeezed Guy&#39;s arms and started feeling the solid mass. As Clark leaned back Guy smiled, and gently leaned towards Clark to kiss him, and then sit up to take off his t-shirt. &quot;You look so muscular&quot; - Clark said. Guy grinned proudly and did a double bicep. His body started feeling hot again, as his crotch felt incredibly tight. Clark noticed how beads of sweat were accumulating on Guy&#39;s pecs. He felt the weight of Guy increasing on top of his pelvis. Guy did a most muscular, which further distracted Clark and had him completely  hard. Guy moaned, and panted... He felt a familiar feeling and unmounted Clark... &quot;What happened?&quot; Clark asked from the couch. &quot;I feel so... tight, these shorts,  they&#39;re so constraining&quot; - Guy replied as he hunched forward - &quot;I&#39;m gonna take them off!&quot;.<br />
<br />
As he was about to pull them off, Guy started contorting, he felt shooting pains on his left arm, as his left hand started to swell. Clark&#39;s jaw dropped, as Guy over all had probably put on lean muscle mass in just that short bit of time. His shoulders seemed broader, and his arms more vascular. Guy smiled while he panted, &quot;This must be a side effect. That bastard.&quot;.  Clark immediately reached out for Guy but he stepped back. A loud rip came out as Guy&#39;s gluts had become rounder, more muscular and torn his shorts apart. &quot;Fuck yeah!&quot; Guy screamed as he stood up right as best he could. His right hand started to match his left hand as his thighs and calves grew bigger and bigger. He widened his stance as his lower body grew more and more muscular. Calves were probably around 17, 18, then 20 inches thick, and well conditioned. All heads of his quads grew, as well as his hamstrings, pulling up the tattered shorts towards his crotch. Thighs now probably measuring 33 inches around. &quot;Fuck...&quot; Clark said as he was even more aroused at Guy&#39;s growth. Soon enough his upper body started catch up as he breathed deeper and deeper, the stomach vacuum becoming more and more impressive as his lats started to creep out further. Veiny forearms started to swell as well as his wrists widened to match his thick strong hands. &quot;Guy, you&#39;re growing huge!&quot; Clark said, to which Guy smiled as he felt the soreness and pain of the sudden growth of his muscle mass. &quot;For you, babe&quot; Guy replied as he took a deep breath and, did his best double bicep while standing. His massive forearms might have been 20 inches thick now, dwarfing his upper arms and even shoulders. He flexed hard once as the veins started popping up more, all the connecting muscles of his upper arms responded by growing. One more flex took his 17 inch biceps to 20 inches. Once more, as veins grew thicker, they went to probably 23 inches. Guy felt more in control, as the pain had become more familiar. The shorts had started to pull down revealing his pubic hair, and further more the base of his thick cock. He decided to do a side tricep now, but then felt a rush of blood to his upper body. His shoulders, traps and pecs started inflating with size. Blood engorged muscles started thickening, becoming denser. His neck became more muscular and thick as his face turned bright red. Pecs started to become thicker, eventually making a shelf atop of the rest of his body, as the growth subdued he posed for Clark, triggering his triceps and forearms to grow further more. First on the left side, then on the right. He panted and winked at Clark, licking his lips and grabbing his swollen crotch. &quot;For you.&quot; he said as he turned around and tried to do a back double bicep, but his back started to grow more and more muscular, making him hunch over again. Fighting for control of his body he planted his left foot towards him and his right foot behind him exposing the growing hamstrings and calves. The shorts kept ripping apart more allowing Clark a full view of striated gluts as Guy&#39;s back had kept growing in pulses and waves. His traps looked as if they were throbbing as they grew more and more. First Guy pulled his elbows back, showing off his thicker lower back. Then he proceeded to do a lat spread, which showed his growing wing span. Clark couldn&#39;t help himself, he dropped trousers and started to stroke. He wanted to feel Guy&#39;s back. As Guy finished his shoulders grew some more, he lifted his arms showing off his thickness and definition and slowly lowered them to a double bicep, flexing once and then again harder which triggered further growth. He panted, and moaned, turned around to face Clark. His cock was now further exposed, thick and veiny, as he walked toward Clark. Immediately Clark approached him, without any restraint and started groping his pecs, he felt the stubble of Guy&#39;s shaved chest growing thicker. Guy moaned as his dick was hard and ready to come out of his shorts... Clark&#39;s hand traveled from Guy&#39;s pec, rubbing his nipples and then slowly feeling his abs. He wanted to help Guy undress, but was stopped by Guy&#39;s hand &quot;No, i&#39;m going to grow out of this pair for you.&quot; Guy said to Clark and stepped back... Soon after Guy&#39;s breathing became heavier. Muscles stretched further more, and swell up to proportions that were not necessarily following traditional bodybuilding aesthetics. His pecs inflated to the point that they touched his chin, as Guy faced down. His abs bowed forward a bit as he widened his stance more and more allowing his legs space to grow. Shorts were already tight enough to work as a tourniquet around each thigh, but not for long as upper thighs and gluts snapped what was left of the rim of his shorts. Guy moaned and started to touch his nipples feeling his pecs growing. Cock started to lift up the remaining fabric up as Clark watched in awe. Guy&#39;s already massive cock had grown thicker, more vascular and longer. Guy&#39;s treasure trail was thicker and covered a bit of his cobbled abs, as it lead to his mammoth, furry pecs. As the growth subsided he walked towards Clark, the rest of the fabric of the shorts fell off, except for a piece that Guy had to pull out from between his thighs. <br />
<br />
Clark stared, in disbelief, pre cum drooling out of his cock. Guy smiled and picked him up with ease, to kiss him passionately, as Clark immediately shot his wad, shooting to the lower part of Guy&#39;s shelf like pecs, which were so big that they block the semen from hitting up. Clark was embarrassed. He wanted this to go further, and shied away from Guy. But Guy immediately kiss him again, which prompted him to start moaning with pleasure. &quot;On me&quot; - Clark said - &quot;I want you to cum over me.&quot; Guy nodded as Clark laid on the floor, his legs up, Guy got on his knees and looked down at Clark while he stroked and moved his hips forward and back to feel the Clarks thighs. Moans were longer and louder, Guy&#39;s face and dick were getting red as veins popped on his temple, with a final moan Guy came, shooting towards the ceiling and hitting it. Then two more shots came out, hitting the ceiling again. Guy kept stroking, as if nothing had happened. Clark was starting to get aroused again, as he watched Guy&#39;s muscles contract, his massive pecs bouncing, his abs tensing when he climaxed. His friend was a beast. Guy moaned once more shooting 3 more loads. &quot;Oh GOD!&quot; - he screamed, his thick cum was now hitting the lower part of his pecs, blasting it. He then stopped, getting in all fours on top of Clark, his throbbing dick&#39;s head was touching Clarks chest. <br />
<br />
Guy felt like he couldn&#39;t hold himself up longer so he rolled off from Clark and plummeted next to him. Carefully laying his massive arms to the side as not to hurt Clark. &quot;Fuck, you&#39;re massive&quot; Clark said. Guy immediately felt a rush of blood fill up his cock again, and immediately came over himself. Clark had no idea until now how much Guy enjoyed this. The two laid there, Guy&#39;s apartment was a mess. They cuddled and fell asleep. <br />
<br />
Waking up hours later, as Guy returned to his normal size.</p>
