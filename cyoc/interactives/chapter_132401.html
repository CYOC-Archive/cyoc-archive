Once back inside I returned to my room. I wanted to check out the iPad properly. It was low on power so I put it on charge and opened up Jenna’s Facebook account. There were two new posts one from Gabby saying she, Em and Shaz were off to Dino’s bar tonight and if I changed my mind about going out contact her. <br />
<br />
A second post was from someone called Cathy Smart. She was going to be in town over the weekend and wanted to catch up. Could I meet her for a chat over a coffee either today or tomorrow? The post had been sent yesterday. I looked in my phone there was a Cathy Smart listed as a contact. She sounded innocent enough. Should I make contact?<br />
<br />
I filtered messages from Cathy Smart. It seemed that she and Jenna got together every 6 months and had been doing so for the last 2 years. In the 1st post Cathy introduced herself as Jenna’s sponsor. I read the post more thoroughly. That 1st post had some links attached. I followed them and came to a site SLAA. It was for ‘Sex and Love Addict Anonymous’ I was a nymphomaniac. But I suppose at least Jenna had recognized this and had sought help. I immediately rang Cathy’s phone number.<br />
<br />
She answered on the 3rd ring. “Hello Cathy speaking”<br />
<br />
“Hello Cathy, It’s Jenna McKenzie here” <br />
<br />
“Oh Jenna. I was beginning to think you wouldn’t make contact. I’m in town visiting some relatives and thought I should give you a call and see how you are going. Could we meet up somewhere?”<br />
<br />
“Sure, maybe after lunch today. I have to be home from about 5.30. Before then?”<br />
<br />
“I’m expected at a family gathering at 4. How about I meet you at the botanic gardens at 2. Maybe one of the seats near the fountains?”<br />
<br />
“Ok I’ll see you at 2”<br />
<br />
I went back to the iPad and looked up all I could on SLAA. It seemed to be a religious group determined to help me overcome my evil ways. I was regretting agreeing to meet with Cathy. However they said they were non-judgmental and that sponsors were recovering addicts themselves. That made me feel a bit better. I decided I would meet with her and see what she had to say. I could always walk away.<br />
I was starting to feel hungry so went to the kitchen and made a toasted sandwich. I finished lunch with a pear. I told Mum I was going out for a while. I would see her later but that I would be having pizza next door with Chrissie.<br />
<br />
I got my bag and drove into town, parking near the gardens. It was only 1.15 so I walked across the road and window shopped. One of the shops was the boutique where Amanda worked. She didn’t usually work on a Saturday so I was surprised when she stuck her head out the door and invited me in.<br />
<br />
She said they were having a quiet afternoon and she recognized me window shopping in spite of the perm. She told me another staff member was on holiday and she was helping out.<br />
<br />
We were alone in the shop. I sat down on a stool and chatted with her. She had her dress for the funeral ready. Zach had taken Rod’s death very hard and had been working on his eulogy. He had been spending a lot of time with Hilda. She ended up showing me the latest fashions. I was impressed and she goaded me into trying on a 50’s style, teal cocktail dress. It had a fluffy petticoat underneath to make the skirt flare out. I looked and felt fantastic. She said I should have been a model. However the dress cost over $400, it was an exclusive boutique. <br />
<br />
It was nearly 2 so I told her I had to meet someone across the road and that I would see her on Monday. <br />
<br />
I crossed over to the gardens and walked up to the fountains. There was a family with two toddlers feeding ducks and a 40ish woman sitting alone. I guessed that was Cathy. She stood up as I approached and gave me a motherly cuddle asking how I was.<br />
<br />
I told her about starting my job and my sister’s fiancé dying. Yes I was close to him I admitted and had taken it hard. She asked whether I was sticking to the plan. I had no idea what she meant so was non-committal in my answer. She opened up about herself saying how hard it was to stay in control when you were hypersexual. From her own experience she said that recognizing you had a problem was half the solution and that I had achieved that. <br />
<br />
She asked me how many men I had been with in the last fortnight. I replied 2, thinking of Rod and Robert. She said that was great, I really was making progress. She asked if the doctors were giving me any drugs to control my libido. I mentioned the doctor had me on Yasmin and that maybe it was having some effect. She thought that was good. Birth control and a lowering of my libido.<br />
<br />
Cathy said that at a previous meeting I had described my lack of female friends, as I had seen them as competitors. Evidently I had a goal of making female friends. Had I succeeded? I was getting there I replied. I was no longer feeling all other females were competitors. I was getting on with my sisters and work colleagues. I mentioned only this morning I had shared a coffee with some girls after Pilate&#39;s and had been chatting to a female friend in a shop while waiting to meet with her.<br />
<br />
“That’s fantastic Jenna. I’m proud of you. Keep up the good work” She was either easily pleased or I was coming from a low base. “Before I go just remember. It is normal for a girl to find men attractive. But that does not mean you have to make love to every man you see. The good men out there find promiscuity unattractive. Remember to try and play hard to get” She held my hand “I need to go now. I’m up here for my niece’s 18th birthday party. I’m going to find it hard myself tonight. The men will all be dressed up. I will just have to keep reminding myself that I am old enough to be their mother. Stay strong”<br />
<br />
She got up and walked towards the street. Giving me a wave as she climbed into a white Toyota. I waved back. Was that what I had to look forward to? Finding it difficult to control myself around 18 year old guys when I was 40? I hoped not.<br />
<br />
I walked back to my own car and drove home.<br />
<br />
Back home I said hello to mum and dad and googled &#39;hypersexuality&#39; on the iPad. It said it was often associated with bipolar disorders. I didn’t think I had become bipolar. Maybe that meant I wasn’t hypersexual. I hoped I could discuss this with Sarah sometime.<br />
<br />
Dad was watching a football game on TV. I sat down and watched with him. It wasn’t the Tigers playing but the athletes did have good bodies. Hell maybe I was hypersexual. When male I had always admired fit female bodies surely there was nothing wrong with my female body admiring a male body. So long as I didn’t get obsessed with about it. I was confusing myself, but gee they did look hot. <br />
I dragged myself away. Richmond were playing later tonight. Hopefully I could watch it next door. I hadn’t thought of that when I said I could babysit. <br />
<br />
I looked out and saw my clothes were still on the line so grabbed a basket and bought them in. I went to my room and put everything away. I went to the toilet. My period was finally over there were no spots on the pad I had put in this morning. I discarded it and did not replace it. The satin undies felt much smoother without a pad.<br />
<br />
I went into Monique’s room and had another look through the clothes in the wardrobe. I found a few different outfits that I thought I could wear to work. I took these into my room and hung them in the cupboard. I ended up reorganizing my wardrobe. Making one end for work wear and the other for party dresses and such. On the other side of the robe I put the more casual clothes I thought I might wear when at home. <br />
<br />
I went back to Monique’s room and retrieved the 21st dress. I was curious. It felt lovely to touch. I checked the label. It was 100% silk. I couldn’t help myself. I got out of my jeans and top and put the dress on. I looked fantastic. I swung around. I would have to find somewhere to wear this. Just not when Sarah was around. That would be cruel.<br />
<br />
Feeling guilty I took the dress off and hung it with the party dresses. I put my jeans and top back on.<br />
<br />
I went back out to the lounge. Dad was wearing new trousers and an ironed shirt. Mum was in a dressing gown obviously she had just had a shower. It was only 5.30. I sat down and turned the TV on.<br />
<br />
When the quiz show finished at 6, I gave Dad the remote. Mum was now dressed but still applying makeup. Dad had sat down with me to watch TV. I told them to have a good night and wandered across to the neighbours.<br />
<br />
As I approached I heard Chrissie call out “She’s here” She opened the front door and let me in. She gave my legs a squeeze. I squatted down and gave her a proper hug. <br />
<br />
A good looking blonde man poked his head around the corner and said “Hello Jenna, It’s good that you could come. Linda is nearly ready. Come into the kitchen. The pizza is in the oven. I followed him and Chrissie to their kitchen. <br />
<br />
&quot;You can sit here&quot; said Chrissie pointing to chair. I sat down and she sat at the table beside me. <br />
<br />
Linda entered the room. She was in a navy dress and had done her make-up. &quot;Hi Jenna, The pizza should be ready. Chrissie will go to bed at 7.30. She can get 1 story. Feel free to watch the TV. We will be back before 10. You have my phone number don&#39;t you? It&#39;s on the wall over there anyway&quot; She pointed to a list on the wall. She took out some plates and turned the oven off.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can look after that. You get going&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok. See you later&quot; She hurried back to her room. A minute later she had high heels on and her handbag over her shoulder. She and Tony said goodbye to me and kissed Chrissie goodnight.<br />
<br />
Once they had gone I served out the pizza. Chrissie wanted 2 slices.<br />
<br />
We ate dinner then had an icy-pole each. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can we play with the teddies again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. Lead the way&quot; She took my hand and led me into another room.  I turned the light on. It must have Chrissies bedroom. There were 4 teddy bears sitting on a shelf. &quot;Ok which teddy bears can I play with tonight?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Silly you have Jenna and Sarah&quot; She handed me a yellow Teddy and a brown Teddy. &quot;I have Little Ted and Red Ted&quot; It was fairly obvious how the teddies got their names.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what are the Teddies going to do tonight?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Can they have a Picnic?&quot;<br />
<br />
That&#39;s a good idea. Where will we have the picnic?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In the lounge room&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do we need to take?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A rug and some plates&quot;<br />
<br />
.......... You get the idea. We played Teddies for an hour then I made Chrissie put her nightie on. We put the teddies to bed but Little Ted had to stay with Chrissie. I made her go to the toilet and clean her teeth. She chose a book to read. I was surprised when she handed me the old Dr Seuss book &#39;One fish, two fish, red Fish blue fish&#39;<br />
<br />
I remembered this story from my own childhood. It was an old story then. I put her to bed and read the story to her and Little Ted. When I had finished, I kissed her goodnight and turned the light off. <br />
<br />
I went to the kitchen and cleaned up the plates we had left there then moved to the lounge and put the TV on, finding the Richmond game. It was quarter time the Tigers were 10 points down. I went back and checked on Chrissie. She was sound asleep.<br />
<br />
I returned to the lounge and settled down to watch the remainder of the game. I had never realized just how good looking Alex Rance was. I actually found myself with my hand down my panties as Alex saved the game for the Tigers in a thrilling finish. I can&#39;t say I had ever found footy an erotic experience before.<br />
<br />
I went to the toilet and checked on Chrissie once more. She was still sleeping soundly and I couldn&#39;t help but think what a little cutie she was. I wondered if one day I would have a daughter of my own.<br />
<br />
Not long afterwards Linda and Tony returned. They had enjoyed their evening. I suspect Linda was a bit under the weather, taking advantage of Tony driving. I refused the $40 Tony offered me saying I would think of some way he could repay me in kind, said goodnight and walked back home. <br />
<br />
Dad&#39;s car was back in the driveway and the front light was on but the rest of the house was dark. I turned the light off and locked the door. Went to the bathroom and did my nightly routine. I put my red pyjamas and turban on and went to bed. I picked up the pirate book and got back into Charlottes tale.<br />
<br />
Her ship was taken by the pirates and she feared for her life and her virginity. She was taken by the pirates and thrown to the ground by the bloodthirsty pirates who had murdered the ship’s crew. Only the intervention of the debonair French captain saved her and her maidservant from ruin. She was ensconced in his cabin but treated as a lady. She would only be released if her husband to be, paid a ransom. Her faithful maid was delivered to a Scottish port in the dark of night with a message to her betrothed. However at the arranged rendezvous a week later the maid returned alone with a message from the lord that he did not want anything to do with tainted property.<br />
<br />
With her life in ruin. Charlotte was comforted by the captain and one thing led to another. I found my fingers fondling my clit again as her seduction occurred. I decided this was a time for Mr Millionaire to come out of his box. As Charlotte’s vagina was penetrated by the captains, mine was as well. Mr Millionaire roused me to ecstasy multiple times. It was only when I realized I was involuntarily moaning that I decided that was enough for one night. I put the book down, turned the light off and the vibration off but left Mr Millionaire in place. I enjoyed the feeling of being filled. <br />
<br />
10 minutes later I pulled him out. I had decided I didn&#39;t want my muscles stretched.</p>
