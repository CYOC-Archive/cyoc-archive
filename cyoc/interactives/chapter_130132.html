<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a week since Steve had sabotaged the program and some routines of sort had taken shape. Tyler was now smoking all day, hardly ever without a lit cigar or pipe in his mouth, and he loved the taste of both and was thinking about what his next smoke would be while finishing his last. He would prepare and light Scott’s big cigars regularly throughout the day and occasionally he’d have a big stick for himself and loved the longer, heavier smoke. Even though they were comically large for him and so heavy in his jaw, he got used to placing them in the corner of his mouth. <br />
<br />
He had sheepishly tried inhaling some smoke while the others were out of sight, first with the pipe and then cigars, starting with nose exhales and then taking the smoke right into his lungs, and loved the buzz from it, so it became the norm, and as time went on he found he needed to inhale more deeply to satisfy his craving for smoke. Before he knew it he was smoking Scott’s bigger cigars more than the 60-ring maduros, mimicking his master’s technique of inhaling deep with his mouth locked shut, inhaling deeply and then exhaling out through his nose. Scott and Doug looked on with immense pride. He had dip in almost all day and occasionally swallowed the spit without any ill effects. His beard and pelt had filled our beautifully and he couldn’t keep his mind off of it, it was a sexual thrill and he was horny as hell, constantly rubbing the new fur and stroking his beard, excitedly hoping for more growth while looking forward to giving Scott or Doug their next smoky blowjob. He was definitely beefing up and felt like the proverbial prize beefcake, and although his receding hairline wasn’t something he really imagined having at 19 he didn’t mind too much, his memories of being a scrawny pizza delivery boy didn’t seem real and his new appearance helped him look more mature and could easily pass for his twice his real age, and the changes turned all three of them on. <br />
<br />
Doug was inhaling his pipe smoke far more deeply than ever and started to think more about using the other smoke box himself but didn’t feel quite ready. But had a strange feeling that he was getting shorter. He had to look up more to talk to Tyler and Scott was even further up in the sky. <br />
<br />
The giant of the house had indeed gained extra size and height, but as he was so big anyway he didn’t really notice that much. Scott continued to use the night smoke gear and still loved it. But his sleep was a little more fitful, so he now woke up for a cigar or two in the night, as the smoke box wasn’t quite intense enough, no matter how much smoke Tyler filled it with. He used the gas mask for more of his cigars during the day, occasionally he’d smoke one after the other that way. But his good mood of a few days earlier started to wear off, once again causing the others concern. His smoking had reached ridiculous levels but all he could think about was ways to get more. He wondered how far the program would end up taking this, but still loved the thrill of being more of a slave to his cigars – smoke was all he ever thought about, and his body and mind thrived on it. <br />
<br />
On the odd occasion when Tyler wasn’t around he would have to prepare and light his own sticks, so he’d get the next ready while his current cigar was entering its final few minutes - he smoked each stick until the nub was close to burning his facial hair. But lighting up big sticks took up precious time and his twitches and shakes were showing signs of reappearing, he needed to come up with a new way to light up and not miss a second of smoking. With the nub of a cigar still smouldering in the corner of his mouth he found he could light up a fresh one, initially it was a little awkward, but he was soon performing the new ritual with consummate ease – he’d then smoke the nub and the fresh cigar concurrently and loved the extra hit from smoking two fat cigars together for the first time. This quickly became the norm and he found himself preparing his next cigar a little earlier each time, so he was smoking doubles for longer and longer. Before long he felt an emptiness gnawing away when he only had one cigar on the go, so smoking doubles became the new norm and he even tried and enjoyed smoking a cigar and pipe at the same time, the mix of flavours was intoxicating. <br />
<br />
Tyler proudly made new attachments for the gas mask that meant Scott could smoke two cigars, or alternatively a cigar and pipe together, that way. Before long Scott was using the attachments all the time and was beaming again. Even with twice the smoke he noticed that he was exhaling a lot less, and what smoke did escape was taking longer to leave, as though his body didn’t want it to depart. <br />
<br />
He then remembered he’d seen videos of guys smoking through their nose for a dare and what a rush the nasal receptors got as well as the extra hit from the smoke. Because of his giant features, with a bit of a push he could fit a big 90 ring cigar up each nostril for a nice tight fit. He lit up both cigars with his mouth and inserted one then the other up his nose. The rush as he took his first inhale was incredible. For an even greater hit he tried lighting them through his nose and this became the norm, he could even do it with the nub of a cigar still burning away in the corner of his mouth. <br />
<br />
Unlike those videos where the cigar was soon removed from the nose when the prank was over and to avoid being sick, Scott thrived on his new method and found he could enjoy the nose smokes down to the nub, lighting a fresh cigar in the conventional manner (his mouth) when the pair were nearly spent. When he had three sticks on the go his mood was delirious, and each time he tried the nose inhaling he’d light up the third one by mouth a little earlier to try and repeat that first big hit, and before long he was lighting the third straight after the initial inhales on the nose pair and taking in huge amounts of smoke. He thought he must look demented smoking like that but didn’t care – it was what he needed. Between smoking doubles, the nose inhale triples, the gas mask and the sleep box, Scott was in smoke heaven. <br />
<br />
Tyler and Doug continued to be in awe and encouraged any adventure which would keep Scott’s dark moods at bay. None of them had any idea how far this would go, but were so happy as smoke pigs that they were hard pressed to care. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile Steve looked on with intense pride at what he’d done, and wondered what he could come up with next.</p>
