<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tracey struggled with her bags as she walked to her apartment. She may have gone on a shopping spree and might have bought more than she should have. It didn&#39;t matter to her though. Her books were selling like hotcakes. Her most recent one involved a scientist opening a portal and meeting a beautiful lady from another dimension. Sylvia was helpful. Her roommate told Tracey how the science would most likely work. Even though she was just an accountant she still knew more science than Tracey.  <br />
<br />
Tracey was snapped out of these thoughts as the elevator dinged. She stepped onto her floor and went to her door. She tried to reach for her purse and get her keys. Sighing she decided to knock on the door as Sylvia was most likely home. Tracey wasn&#39;t a very patient person so after a few seconds and some noise behind the door she put down her bags and opened her purse. After unlocking the door with her keys she put them back and unlocked the front door.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Sylvia I&#39;m home&quot; Tracey called out as she shut the door behind her with her foot. She could feel her fingers hurt from holding these bags for so long. Setting them down by the door she shut it. &quot;Sylvia?&quot; calling out again. Tracey suddenly felt a feeling of unease as the apartment was oddly quiet. &quot;I know you&#39;re here&quot; Tracey turned on the lights and gasped.  <br />
<br />
Claw marks could be seen on the light switch and walls. Turning her head Tracey saw deep gouges in the wooden floor leading to the hall. Tracey covered her mouth as she saw Sylvia&#39;s door busted open. Tracey needed to leave, she&#39;d call the police or something. A click was heard and the lights went out.  <br />
<br />
She let out a yelp and turned to where the door was. There was a hulking eight-foot brute with glowing blue eyes. It straightened up and grinned at her. The light coming in from the window was all she could use to see the beast. Its muscles looked bigger than both her legs. It did look like it had a muscle gut though. Each finger and toe ended with large white claws that looked as sharp as the knives in the kitchen. Encircling its head and covering its shoulders was a huge black mane like one would see on a lion. Its extremely fluffy grey tail made it seem more canine in appearance as did the two fangs poking out of its growing muzzle. It gave off a smug grin as it knew Tracey was taken in its amazing body. He then stroked his giant cock and Tracey realized what he wanted. &#39;no woman could handle that massive thing. It&#39;s got to be at least as big as my torso&#39; she thought. His hairy balls were so heavy they almost touched the ground. He took a few steps before his human feet began to change. He lost a toe on each foot as his ankles raised and pads appeared on his soles and palms. This caused him to trip over her bags and give Tracey a chance to run.  <br />
<br />
If she was thinking straight she could&#39;ve run to Sylvia&#39;s room as it had a fire escape. However in times of fear people rarely behave with a level head. Tracey ran to her room as the werewolf got up. Grey fur quickly covered his feet and stopped just below his knees. He walked over to the locked door. Dark grey fur grew up his legs and up his back and sides. It stopped at his elbows and began to turn grey. More grey fur covered his front and inner thighs as he breathed in the scent of his prey.  <br />
<br />
Tracey panicked as she looked around her room. She pushed her dresser in front of the door. She turned on the light so she could find something to defend herself. She then fumbled in her purse for her pepper spray and phone. She began dialing right as the werewolf&#39;s grey fist broke through the door. He then grabbed at the hole and broke the door more. With a swift kick, the dresser and the bottom of the destroyed door were tossed into the room.  <br />
<br />
Tracey could see him better now with the light. Even though the muzzle was almost finished growing she recognized her roommate. &quot;Sylvia?&quot; Tracy asked in utter shock. Confusion was briefly seen on the werewolf&#39;s muzzle before he gave a tooth-filled grin. &quot;not anymore. Call me Silver&quot; Silver said. He then pounced on Tracey and forced her to the floor. His now canine dick was even bigger with an equally big knot and pulsing veins. Dark grey fur surrounded his eyes and grey fur covered right below his muzzle.  <br />
<br />
He pressed his giant cock against Tracey and made sure the tip was right in front of her mouth. Tracey panicked and tried kicking his balls. This only resulted in a deep chuckle as she landed some hits. &quot;that tickles&quot; he then began thrusting. Tracey tried to escape but he had her pinned. Under his arms, thick patches of thick black fur grew. With each thrust more thick black fur grew. It appeared on most of his chest and the front of his forearms and calves. His bush was the last to get these patches as he sprayed hot cum across traces face.  <br />
<br />
She gagged as some got in her mouth and nose. She suddenly sneezed and that&#39;s when Silver let her go. &quot;don&#39;t worry it&#39;ll be over in no time&quot; Silver blocked the door as Tracey got up. &quot;what happened *ah-choo* to you?&quot; Tracey grabbed her blanket to wipe the cum and snot. Though she did end up licking the cum much to Silver&#39;s satisfaction.  <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s even faster for you&quot; he leaned on the doorway. Tracey was confused only to feel hot suddenly. The urge to strip was so strong and she complied. Once she was nude another urge came even stronger than the first. The desire to masturbate. Suddenly Silver&#39;s cock seemed so handsome. Not just his cock he too looked amazing. She let her forked tongue out and her vagina became bigger and stretchy. Her breasts tripled in size as her hair fell out.  <br />
<br />
&quot;well let&#39;s just how fast you are&quot; she lay on her bed. She shifted slightly as a green-scaled tail grew from her rear. &quot;I was hoping you&#39;d say something like that&quot; Sliver approached the changing woman as the green scales spread down her ass and legs. Dull white scales covered her front as he spread her legs. He plunged his cock so far into her that the tip bulged against her stomach. Despite this, they let out a moan of pleasure and then a flame. Her nostrils smoked on her growing muzzle as her ears disappeared. Her nails lost their nail polish and became dark green claws.  <br />
<br />
She tore into the bed as he thrust into her over and over. Her eyebrow ridges became more prominent as two large horns grew from her skull. Silver cummed into the dragon after a while and both panted. Despite just having sex they wanted more. &quot;maybe it&#39;s because we&#39;re not the same&quot; Tracey said. &quot;you&#39;re right, well there&#39;s a whole world of prey out there. We&#39;re bound to find our mates somewhere Tracey&quot; Sliver said.  <br />
<br />
Chuckling the dragon reached down for her purse. She pulled out her wallet and then her ID. She tightened her grip and shattered it with little effort. She then said &quot;The name&#39;s Emerald now Silver,&quot; She dragged her claw lightly under his muzzle. They then agreed that Emerald would search for a mate in the apartment while Silver searched outside. He opened the window in his room. &quot;oops&quot; he said as he broke the window with his enhanced strength.  <br />
<br />
He then stepped out onto the fire escape. It groaned under his weight but held. he looked down and saw police and SWAT battling several myths as more came out of the apartment. One got tackled by a feral male Cerberus. Silver smirked as he realized he had gotten the easier route.  <br />
<br />
Emerald would be lucky to find any humans at this rate. He jumped off the fire escape and dug his claws into the other building. he dropped into the alley and sneaked away from the fight. Those humans would be those myth&#39;s prey. He&#39;ll find some of his own.  <br />
<br />
That&#39;s when he spotted a reporter and her cameraman. &quot;...and the fight seems to be only intensifying as time progresses. No one knows quite how it started but experts are asking people to begin evacuating the area around Oakland apartments,&quot; the reporter stopped as the cameraman pointed behind her. Silver grabbed her drawing blood when the cameraman tried to tackle him. Tossing the lady away he decided to make this fool his prey. he forced his cocks tip into the man&#39;s throat as his balls pumped cum down his throat. he looked unsatisfied as a longhorn grew from the center of his forehead. At least she lost her cock. He decided to let the rabbit centaur reporter plunge his cock into her. He grabbed his dick as he imagined his ideal werewolf mate. The dropped camera was filming the whole thing. People were seeing firsthand that Halloween had come early this year.</p>
