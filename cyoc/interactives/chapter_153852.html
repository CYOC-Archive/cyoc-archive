<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Game time: cheerleading fight!&quot; Allison read her card aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh cool! I could fuck a few cheerleaders right now!&quot; Ken shouted before everyone were teleported to a big football field. &quot;Ah, I&#39;m in my element!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop acting like a jerk, Ken!&quot; Jill shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t control my new jock instincts.&quot; Ken apologized. &quot;Anyway, where are the babes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are.&quot; Josh replied a little pissed off.  When everybody looked at him, they noticed that he was wearing a red hot cheerleader uniform. &quot;I feel so stupid right now!&quot; He said as he tried to cover his big junk with his very small skirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look pretty good in those garments, guys!!&quot; Allisom joked when she saw Marcus and Ken with those girly clothes too. They used to look more manlier than Josh, so seeing them like that was totally hilarious, especially Ken who now was a big, hairy and manly professional football player. &quot;Of course, Jill and I look beautiful!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up! Allison!&quot; Marcus yelled as he tried to adjust his clothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;The game is going to start.&quot; A mysterious voice sounded. &quot;Each contestant has to make a cheerleading routine, the first three with the best crowd reactions win!&quot;<br />
<br />
A crowd suddenly appeared on the stands expecting for the competition.<br />
<br />
&quot;This will be easy!&quot; Allison smiled as she run in front of the crowd. &quot;Are you ready?!!&quot; The crowd went crazy as they saw Allison jumping,  yelling and dancing in a routine that she was so used to do. She did some back flips before she ended. &quot;Thank you! I love you guys!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, I&#39;ll try it.&quot; Jill said as she entered the stage. &quot;How are you doing so far?!!&quot; She used to do some ballet, so she mixed it with some yells to create an unusual but satisfying routine that made people cheer her. It wasn&#39;t as enthusiastic as Allison&#39;s but it was a good one. &quot;The end!&quot;<br />
<br />
After Jill left the stage, the three boys stared at each other doubting to do anything. It wasn&#39;t embarrassing enough to be wearing cheerleading uniforms, they also have to dance and act like them too?<br />
<br />
Josh sighed before he decided to go in. It was the best three, right? He thought. He just have to beat Marcus and Ken, he could do that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good night, people!!&quot; He yelled as he entered the stage. &quot;It&#39;s time to get some fun!&quot; He started to dance, kind of, run and jump everywhere. It was very disorganized but people reacted very well and he got some support as he made his goofy dance moves just like a school mascot. &quot;Josh! Josh!! JOSH!!&quot; He yelled as he left the stage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit, I&#39;m going to lose at this rate!&quot; Marcus shouted before he entered the stage. He tried to act cool and make some back flips and other stuff that he knew he can do. He was getting people attention, and it grew more and more as he did more risky stunts. However, he forgot about his new big feet and messed up during a side flip, he fell on the ground and stayed there for a while due to the pain. The people immediately lost their excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ok, Marcus?&quot; Jill asked him as she helped him to stand up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but I won&#39;t gonna win.&quot; Marcus said as they left the stage. &quot;I hope the punishment won&#39;t be so bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you waiting big guy? Are you scared of the big crowd?&quot; Allison mocked at Ken who was doubting to do a cheerleading routine. He used to be the shyest guy when he was in front of a crowd. Now, being a big dumb jock and wearing so ridiculous, he was so embarrassed that his beefy jock legs were shaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will do it!&quot; He yelled and run to the crowd. This little boost of confidence quickly vanished when he made a step in front of the public. He watched at the people staring at him and he froze. He had no idea of what to do, so he let his jock side to take full control of him and he made some poses, flexed his muscles and showed off his football abilities. Surprisingly, the crowd reacted well and he got a very good support at the end.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s done!&quot; The mysterious voice said. &quot;The winners are... Allison, Jill...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No surprise.&quot; Marcus said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And... Josh!&quot; The voice said before everyone were teleported back to the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!!&quot; Ken yelled. &quot;That&#39;s bullshit! After all I&#39;d done!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down, alpha man!&quot; Marcus said. &quot;We knew this was going to happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t understand, dude!&quot; Ken said. &quot;I had to left my jock side to take more control of me! I barely remember my former personality now!&quot; He started to sob. &quot;I don&#39;t want to end up like this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Ken. That won&#39;t happen.&quot; Jill told him. &quot;You&#39;re going to turn back to normal when we finish the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you so sure?&quot; Ken replied. &quot;We don&#39;t have any idea!&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison picked the card with the punishment and read it aloud. &quot;Losers got dog tongues.&quot; Marcus and Ken immediately felt their tongues changing and lengthening inside their mouths. &quot;Haha, guys let us take a look at them!&quot;<br />
<br />
Both guys shook their head in denial but Allison remembered that Ken was also cursed with tickles weakness, so she jumped on him and started to tickle his big jock feet. Ken can&#39;t avoid to laugh and his long dog tongue jumped out of his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s better!&quot; Allison said as she stopped tickling him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you really look like a freak now.&quot; Josh said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I canff putff itff baff inffide my mouff!&quot; Ken managed to said as he uselessly tried to put his tongue inside his mouth again. At the end, he resigned and let his dog tongue hanging out freely.</p>
