<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason let out a slight gasp as Andrew let his pants and boxers fall to the floor. His dick bobbed slightly as Andrew straightened up and crossed his arms over his chest. Even soft as it was, his cock was enormous, growing from a thick patch of brown pubic hair. It ran down the length of his inner thigh almost down to his knee, and thick as a beer can. His balls were equally large, like a pair of hairy naval oranges hanging between his legs. Jason drank in the sight and Mr. Andrews seemed to enjoy it, because his cock began to throb with his heartbeat and grow. Jason watched as it continued to thicken and lengthen, the head emerging from its foreskin as the cock began to rise from Mr. Andrew’s crotch slightly until it became fully erect. He noticed with a strange sense of glee that this man’s dick much larger than Larry’s, and by more than just a few inches. His tiny cock, already straining against my boxers, almost came right there at the relief that that asshole was outsized by someone at least. <br />
<br />
Mr. Andrew cleared his throat, and Jason looked up from his glorious schlong and up along his lithe but defined chest to meet his neutral gaze. His eyebrow was arched slightly, his freckled cheeks held in a relaxed smirk. “Do you like what you see?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes, its beautiful!” Jason almost gushed. “If you don’t mind me asking, Mr. Andrew, how big is it?”<br />
<br />
He chuckled. “I don’t mind you asking, but the next time I ask you to call me Andy, it’ll be an order.” His voiced got deep there at the end, before he continued, “Its eighteen inches, but ten inches when I’m soft. And ten inches in girth”<br />
<br />
“Bigger than Larry,” Jason said without thinking.<br />
<br />
“Yes, bigger than that asshole,” Andy agreed, taking a step backward and falling onto the couch. His giant cock landed across his thigh, the head making a slight thump as it hit the couch cushion. He looked at Jason and patted the space on the couch next to him, still with that congenial expression on his face. Feeling confident, Jason stood up and joined Andy on the couch, opting to keep his clothes on for the time being. He was starting to enjoying having this large-dicked man all to himself. <br />
<br />
As Jason sat down on the couch Andy lifted his arm, inviting Jason to cuddle up against his chest. Jason took this invitation and nestled against him, feeling oddly comforted and secure in while held in this man’s arms. Something hard suddenly landed against Jason’s stomach, and he looked down to see that Andy had landed into his lap as they had adjusted themselves on the couch. Jason’s mouth watered.<br />
<br />
“Can I touch it?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“I thought you wanted to be the one telling me what you wanted?” he countered, his other hand drifting down to grip the base of his shaft. <br />
<br />
With that said Jason reached out with his right hand and delicately gripped Andy’s warm, firm shaft. The skin beneath his fingers was smooth and lightly traced by veins; it was too thick for him to wrap his fingers completely around it. Jason ran his hand along the length of Andy’s shaft, making the cock pulse and Andy let out a deep, satisfied sigh. <br />
<br />
“Speaking of,” Andy began, as Jason took his cock in his left hand so he could fondle Andy’s massive balls with his right. “You really let that asshole go to town on you.”<br />
<br />
Jason blushed, but strangly he didn’t feel any shame. In fact, he remembered the satisfaction he had felt when Larry had unloaded his big balls down his throat, how hard his tiny cocklet had came as he was used by Larry in front of his neighbors. “Yeah. I honestly don’t know what came over me.” He finally said.<br />
<br />
“Its okay. I know how you small-dicks love to be humiliated and dominated by large-dick men like us.” Andy shifted himself so that his arm was draped across Jason’s shoulders. “My younger brother is a small-dick. Maybe that’s why I have a soft spot for little-dicks like you.” He looked down to Jason’s crotch and chuckled. Jason looked down himself and noticed the front of his shorts were wet with precum from his rockhard chode. <br />
<br />
“Maybe I should take these off,” Jason suggested. <br />
<br />
“If that’s what you want.” Andy replied with his lazy smile. Jason felt himself get lightheaded as he contorted himself on the couch, shrugging out of his shirt and, with some hesitation, pulling down his shorts and his boxers. He quickly covered his crotch with his hands but Andy leaned forward, his big cock flopping down to drape over the edge of the couch, and grabbed Jason’s wrist to stop him.<br />
<br />
“Don’t,” the Man almost ordered, before stopping himself. “I’d like you not to hide yourself. Please?” he added, his hand loosening its grip on Jason’s wrist. Jason took a deep breath and let his hands fall, leaving his tiny, superfluous cocklet in full display to this big-dicked specimen of a man. <br />
<br />
“Wow, that is small,” Andy admitted, blushing when he saw Jason jerk slightly from the pleasure of the humiliating compliment. “Smaller than my brother’s even.” Jason felt a strange surge of pride at that remark, but then he said something that Jason wasn’t expecting. “It’s beautiful.” He said, echoing Jason’s words.<br />
<br />
“Really? You think so?” Jason asked, as a feeling of warmth crept up over him in response to the compliment.<br />
<br />
“I do,” Andy confirmed, his eyes transfixed on Jason’s inch long erection and marble-sized balls. “May I touch?” he asked, his eyes meeting Jason’s with a hungry expression.<br />
<br />
“Sure, I guess,” Jason said, his confidence building. <br />
<br />
Andy reached out with his large to grasp Jason’s manhood, only it was more of a pinch. Jason moaned when Andy took his hard cocklet between his fingers, gently stroking and rolling it between them. With his pinky and ring fingers Andy massaged Jason’s balls, eliciting such strong pleasure from the small-dick that Jason’s knees became weak, his hand reaching out for something to steady himself with and meeting Andy’s firm shoulder. This brought Jason’s crotch closer to Andy’s face, and without hesitation, the Man leaned forward and took Jason’s desperate cocklet and balls into his mouth. Jason found himself haunching over Andy as the man licked and caressed his tiny package with his tongue, Jason’s rubbing over Andy’s wide back as the Man continued his passionate ministrations. He could feel Andy’s cock throbbing against his leg, the oozing precum bellying how much Andy was enjoying his task. One of his big hands reached up to tweak Jason’s sensitive nipple while he massaged Jason’s balls with his tongue, and the sensation was too much. He felt his legs give way underneath him as his orgasm washed over him, his tiny balls clenching as his cocklet came, Andy not removing himself for an instant. As he fell Jason felt Andy’s arms wrap around him in a strong embrace, holding Jason in place as he recovered from his orgasm. He let Jason slide from his grip just enough until they were face to face before he leaned backwards against the couch, holding Jason in his lap against his chest. The two men sat like that on the couch for a moment, Jason clinging tightly to Andy’s chest while Andy’s hand explored Jason’s lithe body and supple bottom. Jason felt so relaxed, for once today, that he had pretty much forgotten that Greg still hard the book. At least, for now.<br />
<br />
Of course, Greg did have the book and was busy making some changes of his own. Neither Jason nor Andy seemed to even skip a beat as the changes took place, but Jason did begin to notice a couple of things. With his ass he could feel the massive, semi-soft cock coiled underneath him, and the warmth of Andy’s heavy balls, which felt a little larger than they did a few moments ago. The sensation triggered a strong feeling in Jason’s stomach which his brain quickly interpreted as hunger, and Jason’s stomach growled.<br />
<br />
“Why am I so hungry all of the sudden?” Jason asked, clutching his midriff, as he heard Andy smack his lips together and say, “Its so bitter.”<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“I forgot how bitter your small-dick cum can be,” he said, running his tongue over his teeth. “And you’re hungry because you came without getting fed.”<br />
<br />
“What are you talking about?” Jason asked, confused.<br />
<br />
Andy gave him a skeptical look. “You haven’t fed since…you know…out in the hall with Larry. And coming for a small-dick takes a lot of energy.” Jason felt the usual pang of humiliation and pleasure when Andy referred to him as a small-dick, but his hunger also grew more forceful. <br />
<br />
“I’ve never felt this hungry before,” Jason said, pushing himself off of Andy as he was starting to sweat. “Like I haven’t eaten all week…” he said, groaning as his stomach started to cramp, his cocklet painfully hard despite his recent orgasm. <br />
<br />
Andy gave the small-dick a sympathetic look before saying in a sheepish tone, “I don’t know what’s going on between you and Larry, but I could feed you, if you like.”<br />
<br />
“Oh my god, do you have snacks?” Jason asked hopefully.<br />
<br />
“More like a full course meal,” Andy chuckled. Jason was starting to find it endearing, when his Andy’s large-dick ego would occasionally break through his casual and friendly demeanor. “If he’s your feeder, that’s cool. But if you’re really hungry, I’m happy to oblige.” He said, hefting his semi-hard schlong up by the base to entice the small-dick.<br />
<br />
Jason was about to ask again what Andy was talking about and where for the love of god are the snacks, when his eyes locked onto Andy’s hardening schlong. A strong, musky, masculine smell invaded his nostrils, and Jason felt himself drifting closer, his hand reaching out to grab the prodigious club and bring the throbbing head into his mouth. Jason’s eyes closed as Andy moaned and the hard head of his cock was slowly enveloped by Jason’s expanding jaw. <br />
<br />
“That’s it baby, get your meal,” Andy almost whispered, lifting his pelvis off the couch to gently coax more of his cock down Jason’s throat. Jason’s eyes were watering has he felt his throat expand and dilate around Andy’s shaft, inviting him in deeper. He took a gentle, but firm, grip of Jason’s head and pulled the small-dick closer, lower. “I’ve wanted to be your feeder for a while,” Andy half-groaned as Jason flex his throat muscles around Andy’s cockhead and massaged his shaft with his tongue. “But my size can be pretty unmanageable, even for a small-dick.” He paused and leaned his head back for a moment as Jason used his free hands to squeeze and massage Andy’s massive testicles, one ball in each hand. Jason took initiative and brought himself down a few inches further, his insides feeling odd as they stretched and rearranged to make a path for Andy’s invading phallus. When he looked down for a moment, he was shocked to see Andy’s hairy crotch only a foot away from his face; he’d only swallowed the first eight inches or so. Andy must have sensed his trepidation.<br />
<br />
“Keep going, little-dick. You’re doing so well.” He said, his voice husky but warm with encouragement. Emboldened, Jason worked the schlong further down his throat, inch by glorious inch, his throbbing cocklet almost forgotten.<br />
<br />
“When my brother transitioned,” Andy continued, his hand tracing Jason’s nipple, “My father gave me a talk about the way things would have to change now that there was a small-dick in the house. He told me small-dicks need to be humiliated, that their purpose was to serve and satisfy greater men like him and me. You think I’m big? Where do you think I inherited this thing from?” he asked rhetorically. “But we both learned from my brother than even small-dicks can’t service every superior man. We were both too big for him; so he had to get fed from someone else.” Andy trailed off as Jason gripped both of Andy’s thighs and pulled, forcing the shaft of Andy’s mighty cock further down Jason’s throat into what Jason imagined had to be his stomach by now. The feelings of tightness slowly began to subside until Jason realized that the movement of Andy’s cock was stimulating pleasure points along the whole of his throat. He moved his body back and forth experimentally, moaning around Andy’s shaft as it glided over the erogenous zones he discovered were deep inside him. As if he were truly meant to take cock. <br />
<br />
“I haven’t come across a man or a small-dick who could take most of me, let alone all of me.” Andy went on, “But seeing you in the hall today with Larry, well, not only was I little jealous of the prick, but I saw something in you. Something that I think needs a little bit more of a tender hand than what Larry can offer you.” He looked down at Jason, between his legs, only six inches away from the base of his shaft. “Keep going, beautiful. You’re so close.” He encouraged, running his hands through Jason’s hair. Again, Jason felt his cocklet surge and strain between his legs at the foreign-sounding compliment.<br />
<br />
Andy stood up, taking care not to dislodge his cock from Jason’s body by even a centimeter. He took a firm grip of Jason’s head and, at a measured pace, guided the last of cock into Jason’s throat until the small-dicked man’s face was flush against his pelvis. Both men moaned Jason took the last few inches inside him, his nose buried in Andy’s dense nest of public hair, the Man’s balls heaving against Jason’s chest. Jason took a deep breath through his nose, inhaling Andy’s masculine, slightly musky scent. Andy withdrew himself by a few inches before driving himself back in, pulling out and then thrusting back until he was fucking Jason’s face and throat at a brisk pace. <br />
<br />
“I knew you had it in you baby,” Andy growled as he thrust into the small-dicked man. Jason was in pure bliss. He wasn’t even touching his cock, yet it was practically bursting with pleasure from the stimulation in his throat and abdomen. “I can be your feeder, all day every day, and keep that asshole off your back. I’d almost call him a small-dick, but that would be an insult to beautiful small-dicks like you.” He said as he picked up the pace and began fucking Jason’s face harder and deeper. “You ready, boy? I’m gonna fix you the best meal you’ve ever had!” he groaned, his grip on Jason’s head tightening as he began hammering into him. <br />
<br />
Jason could feel the schlong pulsing and swelling until finally and with a deep groan Andy came, the Man’s balls heaving against Jason’s chest as they unloaded a massive torrent of cum deep inside the boy. Jason hadn’t realized how strong his hunger had become until the feeling vanished, replaced by an almost overwhelming sensation of contentment and fullness as his tiny cock came again. His stomach seemed to bulge for a moment from the size of Andy’s load before quickly resuming is smooth, toned appearance. Above him, Andy was taking deep breaths as he tried to steady himself. “Thank you, baby. You don’t know how long its been.” He said, leaning down to kiss the top of Jason’s head. Jason felt a rush of pride, gratitude and something else to, for the large dick that had just fed him. <br />
<br />
Andy began to pull his schlong out from Jason, taking it slow as both men were still sensitive and stumbling through the aftershocks of their orgasm. When the last of his cock left Jason’s mouth, and the softy, spongy head slipped out and over Jason’s tongue, he got a taste of the Andy had just so generously filled him with. It was salty, savory, almost a hint of citrus, more delicious than anything he could remember tasting in a long time. He’d swallowed more than he’d cared to admit over these last few hours, but it had never tasted like this.  It suddenly occurred to him that Greg must still be manipulating things with the book, and that this development might just be his latest edit. But Jason was districted when his Feeder, or Andy, he tried to remind himself, spoke to him again.<br />
<br />
“I bet you’re full now.” He said, letting his softening cock fall between his legs. <br />
<br />
“Mmm, yes,” muttered Jason, eyes closed, still on his knees. <br />
<br />
Andy chuckled and said, “You know I never got an answer.”<br />
<br />
Jason opened his eyes and looked up at him. “What do you mean?”<br />
<br />
He looked almost a little hurt. “I’d like to be your feeder, full time, if you’ll have me.”<br />
<br />
Jason still wasn’t sure what that meant, but he played along to find out. “And what would that entail exactly?”<br />
<br />
Andy shrugged his big shoulders, his more demure side taking over as his cock fully softened. “Well, you know, any time, day or night, when you’re hungry or when I’m horny, I’m available to feed you my cum. I’ll keep Larry and the other Large-dicks off your back. You service and feed me, I service and feed you.”<br />
<br />
“And what’s the catch?”<br />
<br />
“The catch is: you might want to consider moving in here with me, because Larry has a key to your apartment.” Andy said, walking to the kitchen to grab a glass of water.<br />
<br />
“You want me to move in with you?” Jason asked as Andy returned to the couch, surprising him with a second glass of water for Jason. He took it and took a few deep gulps. <br />
<br />
“Why not? Lots of small-dicks move in with their feeders.” Andy took a sip from his glass. “At least, the unmarried ones do, I guess. Besides, it’ll give you some time to find that book.”<br />
<br />
Jason choked would have choked on his water at that remark, if his body still had a gag reflex. “What do you mean?” he asked in an innocent tone.<br />
<br />
Andy dropped himself back onto the couch, ameuvering his large but now flaccid cock so that it was draped across his thigh. “Come on, dude. You know what I’m talking about. Even if I didn’t hear you arguing with Greg and Larry all day about the book, I would still know you used it to make changes to the world.”<br />
<br />
Jason was shocked. “You’ve had the book before?” he inferred.<br />
<br />
Andy nodded. “Yeah, though unlike you I used it do sensible things like pay off my student loans and fix my crooked teeth. Clearly you had other things in mind….” Andy said, his hand coming to rest on his soft cock for emphasis.<br />
<br />
Jason blushed. “That idiot Greg has it. I need to get it back before he makes any more changes. Will you help me?”<br />
<br />
“If you accept my offer, then I’ll do anything you ask.” Andy replied, his hand encircling his shaft, which Jason could swear was starting to grow again. “I’ll help you in every way I can.” He said with a smile.<br />
<br />
“Well, then I accept. You can be my…feeder, I guess.” The word made Jason’s cocklet harden.<br />
<br />
Andy’s face broke into a look of happiness and satisfaction. He grinned and leaned over to give Jason a strong embrace before kissing him passionately on the lips. Jason found himself returning the kiss, holding Andy closer and tighter against himself as they kissed and explored each other with their tongues. Andy’s cock swelled to life underneath him; Jason could feel it poking against his stomach, rousing a hollow, yearning feeling out of Jason.<br />
<br />
Andy pulled away after a minute and said, “Thank you, Jason. I’ll be a good feeder,” he promised.<br />
<br />
“I hope so, because, um…I’m feeling kind of hungry again.” Jason confessed, reaching out to grip Andy’s hard schlong.<br />
<br />
“I’ve got a fresh batch for you, baby” he said, cupping his balls to emphasize. “But lets take this off my couch and into the bedroom. I’ll show you another way you can earn your meal.”<br />
<br />
And stood up from the couch, pulling Jason up by the hand with him before leading him into his bedroom.</p>
