<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>/*<br/>
Hi there, dear folks!<br/>
I am the author of this story. As you might have read one previous chapter by me, you might have noticed some expressions that are weird or don&#39;t even make sense. <br/>
Apologizes, and please let me explain. I am a mainland Chinese, whose mother tongue is not English, and who didn&#39;t know anything about English until 9 years old. So I am still struggling to straighten everything up.<br/>
Anyway, thank you for reading. I spent a long time making adjustments to the story, language, grammar and so on to make this story better and better. Hope you will enjoy it. If not, feel free to tell me your dislikes in the comment, and I will try my best to catch you guys up!<br/>
Should you have further inquiry, please contact me at mi888uzl@outlook.com, inbox checked every day.<br/>
*/</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Blinking your eyes, you were wishing desperately this is just a lucid dream. But it was completely useless. <br />
You knew it was, opening your eyes, but meeting your furry hands again and again.<br />
How did this happen? What am I transforming into? Being terribly worried, you repeated these questions in your mind.<br />
Although being terrified, your hope of straightening out the mess you are in never died. <br />
Getting your eyes off your hand, you held the flashlight with your paw-like hand and observed carefully all over the rest of your body. Everything looked perfectly normal. You smiled a little out of relief, knowing you will find a way out before it gets any worse.<br />
Then what happened next truly was hope-killing.<br />
&quot;Ahhhh!&quot; Was all you could manage when you felt one, or even more needles being spiked into the skin on your back. <br />
Before you could possibly find out what was wrong. More &quot;needles&quot; had come, cruelly digging themselves deeply into your weak skin, ferociously invading your fragile body. <br />
In great pain, you felt every one of your vertebra crack, liquify, reshape, and solidify, repeatedly deliver unbearable agony. It made you collapse to the ground, screaming, hoping the pain would lessen, even by a little bit. <br />
But you knew you have read transformation stories a lot. You realize it with a shock, that the pain wasn&#39;t going to lessen.<br />
You&#39;re right, it really didn&#39;t, but grow stronger, spreading across the lower part of your body, your haunch, your thigh, shank, and eventually your feet, the most painful part of all. You, being almost paralyzed by the pain, could do nothing but taking off your shoes, hoping the pain will die down a little in this way. But you knew it won&#39;t work.<br />
For times, you almost fainted. But the dramatic change on your lower body, as you looked at it, shocked you and kept you conscious. The pain didn&#39;t come out of nowhere. It was growing pain! You realized it, looking at your shortening leg (including your thigh and shank), and equally lengthening feet. With your knees and ankles moving up, in different hight. You came to realize that your human, plantigrade legs had been replaced by animal-like, digitigrade ones. You found your toes, with agony (since feet are the most sensitive part in the human body), had become thicker and tougher, with big toes moved to the center of your feet sole.  The nails on them also deformed into razor-sharp claws. Despite being pretty short, they were sharp enough that you can almost tear one apart simply by kicking him in the stomach. <br />
Just then, the pain seemed to cease a little bit. Once torturing agony had become somewhat bearable, giving you a chance to breathe, and the opportunity to take a look at how much you had changed. Looking down, your newly-transformed legs met your eyes first. Even though covered in human jeans, they looked completely inhuman. The once comfortable jeans now felt unreasonable tight so you took it off. It took you some effort to do so as you can barely move your ankles and knees individually as if there was a linkage between them. Putting your jeans aside, you took a closer look at your legs. They really were inhuman, looking exactly like something you would from an animal&#39;s body, except for your still-human-like skin. Your noticed your spine also grew spiky, running your hand across your back. A tail also formed on your bottom, moving a little bit, as if with a will of its own.<br />
Though hoping that everything will be fine, you had a strong sense of foreboding that this was not going to end up well.<br />
Sorry, it really didn&#39;t.<br />
Just as you tried to stand up and learn to walk a little. The pain came back. Being less intense than before, the pain, fortunately, didn&#39;t make you faint. Unfortunately, you&#39;ll have to experience the pain with full consciousness.<br />
The pain had changed its form as well, from spiking to burning. You felt your skin on fire. It was changing like your bones, altering its texture from smooth to rough, changing its color from light brown to dark brown. In burning pain, you struggled, rolling about on the ground. You suddenly noticed that the ground didn&#39;t felt icy-cold as before. As if there were something between your skin and the ground. You curiously looked down, to find dark fur spreading on your lower body. <br />
The waves of growing fur also entered your upper body, creating burning pain that made you shiver for instance. Having an extra layer of cloth underneath, the unbearable heat drove you to take your shirts off, leaving only your vest and short on you. The vest was completely wet, because of your serious sweating during the transformation. Apart from these two pieces, you saw you were covered in fur, full-body, with the dim light from the flashlight. Your tail instinctively curled up around you, motionlessly.<br />
You, being exhausted after the long transformation, thought it was over, ignoring your still human head. <br />
Just as you were about to take a better look at yourself. You heard some whisper out of somewhere. Grabbing the flashlight, you looked around the tomb room and was surprised to find that the sculpture of Anubis in the middle of the room had disappeared. Precisely speaking, its body disappeared, leaving the head of the sculpture placed on the base.<br />
Its eyes were still glowing, at exactly your direction. Facing it, you froze again like the last time, knowing that the whisper came from it. <br />
It had changed your body. Now it will change your mind.<br />
You tried turning your head away from it, but your body refused to follow your command, straightening up and facing it as if under a spell. The whisper became louder and louder as you uncontrollably stare into its glowing red eyes. It was talking to you, in a strange language you seem to understand more and more, better and better. You started being spellbound to the ancient Egyptian story it was telling, as your body relaxed and lean toward it, partly forced and partly out of your own will. You saw across the rise and fall of the Egyptian Empire, the form and grow of the World of Dead, and witnessed everything the Gods of the Egyptian does. You had formed a clear image of how the circle of life work, how modest people gain a second life and how lustful people were punished. You&#39;ve learned the ancient Egyptian Language, the way Egyptian gods do things, how they communicate, how they entertain and most importantly, how they govern the World of Gods so well. It felt like a hundred years until there was a flash, showing the slump of the Gods&#39; World. <br />
And everything when dark. The glowing eyes of the head darkened and eventually went off. You gasped with shock, as the head then collapsed into a pile of dust.<br />
 Something was definitely wrong, you suddenly noticed, that you didn&#39;t feel like yourself anymore, you felt as if you, yourself, was the great God of the Dead, even though you know who you were before, a young human, an archaeology hobbyist. <br />
Mental change wasn&#39;t all, you felt the room around you lit up a little bit as if you have just gained night vision. With enhanced sight, and the linguistic staff you learned just now. You now are finally able to understand the word on the wall. You came closer to one of the walls, reading the biggest figures in the center. &quot;Look Up And Face Yourself!&quot;<br />
As if out of instinct, you looked up at the ceiling, finding that the entire ceiling was a big mirror.<br />
Also, you saw an anthro jackal, setting on the ground, looking back at you, with a pair of glowing yellow eyes.<br />
Even though scared a little, you knew that WAS you!</p>
