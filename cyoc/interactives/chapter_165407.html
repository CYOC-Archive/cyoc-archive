<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Looks like it’s our turn!”  Arthur told his nervous boyfriend.   “Already?!” Drew replied.<br />
<br />
“I’ll go first to show you that there’s nothing scary about it.”<br />
<br />
Drew watched in anticipation as his beloved made his way to a large door.  Most of the family were focused on the door for when Arthur emerged, but many also had and an eye on Drew to see his reaction. Newbies always made for some good entertainment.<br />
<br />
Less than 5 minutes later the door swung open and Arthur came out, only he didn’t look like Arthur, it turns out he got his cousin’s husband, Oscar!  He was wearing a white wife beater tank top and some weathered work pants.  The crowd clapped as Arthur flexed for them.<br />
<br />
As he walked back to his seat Drew pulled him aside.  “OMG? Is that really you?” Arthur once again flexed his larger bicep, “In the flesh! Things could have ended up worse huh?” He joked. “You better hurry up and change babe. Everybody is waiting!”<br />
<br />
Drew still couldn’t believe his boyfriend was suddenly another man.  He wanted to ask more questions but was quickly ushered out of his seat.  He took a small green present and entered the strange door.  He gulped as he heard it lock behind him.  He was surprised to see somebody already in there, a woman.<br />
<br />
“Hi! I’m one of Arthur’s relatives. We always have somebody in the bathroom to help get people dressed in their new bodies. It’s especially helpful with the younger kids. But lots of adults still need help getting into their clothing.” <br />
<br />
Drew seemed to understand. It was probably smart that somebody was there to help keeps things running smoothly. Drew figured the small green gift he chose was a safe bet.  He unwrapped it and was confused to what was inside. <br />
<br />
He held up what seemed like a white loincloth in the air “What’s... this?” Drew asked<br />
<br />
The lady let out a chuckle, “Apparently Uncle Ichiro has a sense of humor.” Drew was confused, <br />
<br />
“Who is Uncle Ichiro? And what is this thing?”<br />
<br />
The woman tried to contain her laugher, “Ichiro married to Arthur’s Aunt Frida. She met Ichiro in Japan when she studied abroad. They’ve been married for 15 years or so. Did you see him out there?”<br />
<br />
Drew tried to remember what everybody looked like in the huge crowd of relatives.  He suddenly got a nervous feeling, “Oh no! You can’t be serious!”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry sweetie. It’s not permanent!”“ She pointed to the large stone mounted on the wall and winked, “Welcome to the family!” <br />
<br />
Drew stripped off his normal clothes and pulled the loincloth up.  He had to keep one hand on it at all times so it wouldn’t slide down his skinny legs.  He touched the glowing stone mounted in the wall and closed his eyes. He felt his body growing and getting heavier. His cock began to stir as he felt something surge in his crotch.  He reached down to feel an appendage that certainly wasn’t his. He felt around and found two giant balls that were much heftier than his previous pair.  When his body stopped changing, he opened his eyes and let out a shriek, “Ahhhhh!” He was now an overweight, middle aged Japanese man wearing some sort of sumo wrestling loincloth. He wasn’t cartoonishly fat, there was obviously a healthy combination of muscle in his new body.  Nevertheless he was still distraught as he talked to the lady, “I’m not going out there like this!”<br />
<br />
The lady got a serious look on her face, “You have to. That’s part of the fun. You need to relax and embrace your current body. It would be insulting to the family if you didn’t go out there with confidence!  Just do a few wide steps and slap your hands together. Strike a pose like a sumo wrestler and wait for everybody to cheer!”<br />
<br />
Drew didn’t want to burn any bridges with the family on his first visit. Especially considering the things this family was capable of.  He didn’t want to be stuck like this!  He took a deep breath and unlocked the bathroom door. He couldn’t believe he was about to face his boyfriend’s family in the body of a middle aged fat man.<br />
<br />
The crowd erupted after Drew made his grand entrance. After some whistles and jokes, the crowd’s attention went to the next person in line. Drew managed to slip back to his seat to reunite with Arthur. <br />
<br />
Arthur was seated with a huge smile on his borrowed face. “Hey there big guy!” Arthur said as his boyfriend clumsily sat down.  He felt like the chair was going to break. He rubbed his big, round muscle gut and joked, “..Well this wasn’t’ the way I imagined I spend the first day meeting your family...”<br />
<br />
Arthur rubbed his now strong pecs “…It’s the luck of the draw hun. That’s what’s so fun about my family parties. You never know who you are going to end up as.”<br />
<br />
For some reason, Drew started devouring his dinner plate. Once it was gone, he laughed, “You know, This could be kind of fun! At least I don’t have to worry about watching my weight with Ichiro’s body!”<br />
<br />
Arthur smiled, “It’s nice to see you finally relaxing a bit!” Austin saw how Drew was eyeing his dinner plate and slid it over, “Go ahead! Oscar probably wouldn’t be happy if I put a few pounds on his body while I had it!”<br />
<br />
Drew smirked as he devoured Arthur’s plate. Suddenly, the crowd clapped again after the next person appeared. Drew looked up and instantly lost his appetite.<br />
“Hey! That... that’s MY body!” Drew watched as his body did a spin on the stage then used his hands to lift up his shirt. The crowd erupted even louder with cheers. <br />
<br />
-“Twinks gone wild!”  <br />
-“Arthur sure is a lucky guy!”<br />
-“Nice perky ass too!”<br />
They howled.<br />
<br />
Drew nudged Arthur, “OMG! Who got my body?”<br />
<br />
Arthur leaned over with a laugh, “It looks like Grandpa John just ended up with your body!” Drew watched In horror as Grandpa John did a quick dance with his body. He then lifted his new leg up to the wall to show off his newly gained flexibility. Drew was somehow embarrassed and put his hands over his face.<br />
<br />
“OMG! This is so embarrassing! Your Grandpa ended up with MY body?” <br />
<br />
Arthur consoled him, “Don’t be embarrassed. Everybody has to end up with someone’s body. Grandpa John is funny and outgoing. I’m sure he will talk to everybody while he is in your body. It will give everybody a chance to get to know you!”<br />
<br />
“Get to know me? That’s not me! That’s your grandpa in MY body!” <br />
<br />
Arthur nodded, “That’s not what I meant. I meant to say that since he has your body for the night, lots of people will get to talk to him. I’m just saying it’s good for you because it gives your body exposure with the rest of my family. People will probably feel more comfortable around you now.”<br />
<br />
Drew seemed to feel better about the situation. He then pointed to the next person that appeared, “WOAH, That’s YOU!” <br />
<br />
Arthur laughed, “That’s funny. It looks like my Dad ended up my body!” They watched as Arthur’s father raised his hands up and walked around the stage. The crowd erupted with laughter and clapping. <br />
<br />
Eventually everybody was finished using the stone. The party seemed to take a new level as everybody walked around in their new bodies.</p>
