<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With his changes now complete Sam went about getting dressed. He took the bra, the beige pants and the panties into the bathroom. He also wanted to examine his new groin with a bit of privacy. He was embarrassed that his pink nipples on his now seemingly enormous breasts were hard and erect, giving away that despite his changed gender Sam was still very turned on. Jordan had done a lot of giggling and smirking for the last 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
In the privacy of the bathroom with the door locked, much to Jordan&#39;s disappointment, Sam removed his now ill fitting boxers and had a first look at his feminine sex. This girl was seemingly a natural blonde with a neatly trimmed triangle of pubic hair surrounding her very neat looking vulva. Somehow it was easier to think of the girl in the mirror as someone else, she was quite a beauty and very much a she, whereas Sam&#39;s mind still considered himself a man.<br />
<br />
This girl was slim, tall and leggy but with apparently oversized breasts. Sam looked at the pink bra. It said it was a size 32D, he didn&#39;t know what that actually meant, other than D was bigger than A, B or C. Certainly the breasts seemed huge from his current perspective. His admittedly smaller hands could not cover the breasts. He had also noticed how much they wobbled in the short walk from Jordan&#39;s bedroom the bathroom. These breasts would certainly need support.<br />
<br />
He examined the girls face. It was the face Jordan had sported on their last trip. It was completely void of make-up yet still beautiful. The girl had blue eyes, puffy lips and large, very white teeth. The girl&#39;s face was oval but her chin was square. Her nose was long and skinny but did not stick out a lot. Her complexion was seemingly flawless and her skin tone was pale but not albino. If Sam had to guess this girl&#39;s ancestors were German or Scandinavian and that the girl was in her mid twenties.<br />
<br />
The pretty face was framed by blonde, wavy hair. The hair reached her armpits and seemed to have a part in the middle. She did not have a widow&#39;s peak, something that Sam was used to when checking his own reflection. Sam checked the girl&#39;s earlobes. They were pierced. <br />
<br />
He then examined the girl&#39;s arms and legs. They were slim and long, as were her fingers. The girl had long fingernails that extended a quarter inch beyond her finger tips. The seemed well manicured but bore no polish. <br />
<br />
Sam&#39;s examination was interrupted by Jordan knocking on the door. &quot;Do you need help in there. I have a blouse that I wear with those slacks. I&#39;ve also made a reservation at the hotel restaurant for 6.30 so you need to hurry a little bit&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t we just have room service? I don&#39;t think I&#39;m ready to face the world&quot; Sam was once more shocked by the feminine voice he now possessed<br />
<br />
&quot;No we can&#39;t just have room service. We need to get you practised at interacting with people. In the morning we are to give a presentation. We don&#39;t want that to be the first time Samantha appears in public&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam could see her point. He wouldn&#39;t give a good presentation if he was nervous. Right now his almost disabling fear was appearing in public as a female. The best way to overcome that fear was to face it. That involved heading out and interacting with strangers. Hopefully prove to himself that he could do it, then tomorrow all he had to do was concentrate on his sales pitch. &quot;Okay, give me a minute&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam didn&#39;t let Jordan in immediately, He pulled the panties that had changed him up his legs. They were a perfect fit. He then put the bra on and was surprised that he had no difficulty reaching behind his back and doing up the clips. Was this one of the &#39;Instincts&#39; Jordan had spoken about? His breasts filled the bra cups and enhanced his cleavage. The bra transferred the weight of the breasts to his shoulders. He then stepped into the beige pants Jordan had given him. They seemed quite tight and a bit short, exposing four inches of shin above his ankles, however once he had pulled them over his wide hips he had no difficulty doing up the buttons over his narrow waist. He grimaced as he observed that the pants were of a very feminine body hugging style and did nothing to hide the lack of a bulge in his crotch.<br />
<br />
Only then did Sam unlock the door to see what shirt Jordan had decided he should wear.</p>
