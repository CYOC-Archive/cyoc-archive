<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tempting as it is to jump right in and become a part of your new friend, though, your friend has taken a liking to you, and you wonder how this might affect that relationship.  &quot;What about communication?  Can the person still talk?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, no.  It&#39;d be pretty weird for people if my body part started talking to them.&quot;  Your heart sank for a moment.  You didn&#39;t want to become a part of your new friend if you could never speak to each other.  But he continued.  &quot;However, being a part of my body, we can communicate with each other mentally.  That&#39;s part of the reason it&#39;s important to find someone willing.  Don&#39;t need someone screaming in my head for the rest of my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
You started getting excited again.  Still, best not to rush into this.  Maybe your new friend wanted to keep you as a human.  &quot;What if... maybe I became a part of you?&quot;<br />
<br />
He looks at you in surprise.  &quot;You?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod sheepishly.  Having just asked to become someone&#39;s body part makes you more than a little embarassed, especially as you realize you are still in a public restaurant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure?  Like I said, it is completely permanent.  There would be no going back.  You would be a part of me for the rest of my life, and I intend to live a long one.&quot;<br />
<br />
You sit silent for a moment, not because of uncertainty, but because of embarassment.  He must see it in your face, because he responds with compassion, &quot;I would love for you to become a part of me, my friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
You smile.  You&#39;re able to do this.  You&#39;re actually gonna do this!  But, what you want to ask for, is even more embarassing.  So you test the waters.  &quot;What are my options?  Any limits?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could be any part of me you want.  Could be my hand or foot.  Could be my belly, and get to feel yourself filled when I vore someone.  Could be my beak or my tongue.  Could be my eyes, and watch the world through my eyes.  Or...&quot; and he leans in close, &quot;you could go more intimate.&quot;  He winks at you.<br />
<br />
The good news is that your options are open.  The bad news is that he didn&#39;t specifically name the part you were you were interested in, even though it was in the ballpark.  Well, you&#39;re already waist-deep into this request.  Might as well go all in.  &quot;Can I be your... tailhole?&quot;<br />
<br />
You expected to again see a look of shock.  But instead, he had a look of amusement.  &quot;But of course.  Though again I should remind you, you would retail many of your senses.  No smell, but you would definitely retain your taste.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but... can we continue this after we&#39;re done here?  Maybe we can do this at... your place?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand.  It can wait.  Give you more time to think about this.&quot;<br />
<br />
And so the rest of your date went as normal.  The food was good, and you got used to being naked pretty quickly.  Granted, being naked was nothing compared to the conversation you just had.  Soon, though, the bill was paid, and you followed your new friend and potential owner to his home.  Go figure that he lived in a treehouse.  And it wasn&#39;t a kid&#39;s clubhouse either, but a proper home, albeit a small one.<br />
<br />
Inside, he asks, &quot;Have you given more thought about being my tailhole?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.  And, I really do want to live as your tailhole, for the rest of your life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there any particular reason?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  I find the idea very fascinating.  I know it&#39;ll be very gross.  And as a human being, having poop come out of my mouth would be very unhealthy.  But as your tailhole, that would be my purpose.  In a way, that would make it okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
He nods in understanding.  &quot;Very well, then.  I accept your offer, my friend.&quot;  He turns and lays on the floor, his tailfeathers raised to present himself to you.  &quot;When you are ready, strip, and push your head into my tailhole.  My body will handle the rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
This was it.  You were actually going to do this.  You take a deep breath, knowing it&#39;ll be one of your last.  You strip down, and get on the floor behind the raven.  Normally, you would never put your face this close to someone&#39;s behind, let alone make contact with their tailhole.  But this is where and what you are going to be.  Without hesitation, you spread open his cheeks, and push your head in between.  To your surprise, your head goes furthur than expected.  His tailhole had very easily been pushed open, and was now beginning to suck you in.<br />
<br />
It only took a few seconds before your head was in.  To be face-deep inside someone&#39;s tailhole was definitely gross, mentally more than physically.  It was already impossible to breath, though you tried not to panic, as you knew that in moments, you wouldn&#39;t have to, anymore.  You felt yourself continue to get sucked in, his tailhole accomodating your shoulders.  This part went slower than your head, but once your shoulders inside, the process went much more quickly.  You don&#39;t know how you were able to fit inside the raven&#39;s behind, but as you were sucked in, you found yourself curling up into a ball.  In went your own behind, quickly followed by your legs.  And with one final slurp, your feet were sucked in.<br />
<br />
You could feel the muscles inside the raven&#39;s behind moving you around, reorientating yourself into a position proper for your new purpose.  It felt very hot, and you could feel parts of your body disappearing, as the raven&#39;s body was consuming your own and using the energy from its meal to reconfigure you.  As more of your body disappeared from your sense of self, you felt smaller and smaller.  Your mouth felt especially strange, as it was tightening up, your teeth disappearing and your tongue melting to its insides.  Externally, you could feel yourself merge with the raven.<br />
<br />
And then, moments later, you realize, it has stopped.  The transformation had completed itself.  To say you felt strange is an understatement.  You could no longer feel your arms and legs, as they no longer existed.  And despite how much of your body had been burned away in the process, you still feel like you had a front and a rear, just compressed and tightened in a small space.  And perhaps the most unusual thing was how your sense of disappeared beyond your form.  You had no outer surface, aside from your former face.  Inside, your body connected with the raven&#39;s, and you could not feel him, though he could certainly feel you.<br />
<br />
What else occurs to you is how dark it is.  That is, until the raven&#39;s butt cheeks are pulled apart, and you realize you find yourself surrounded by his feathery mounds, his tailfeathers looming high above you.  You hear his voice.  &quot;Are you alright in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
The voice didn&#39;t come from the outside, but from inside your mind.  You try to mentally answer.  &quot;Yeah.  I&#39;m here.  Just... processing what has happened to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The raven releases his butt cheeks, and you once again find yourself in darkness.  You suddenly feel movement around you, as the raven gets up and begins to walk.  His walking produces a slight swaying of the his cheeks.  The motion only makes your new form more apparent, as only a tailhole could feel motion like this.  Moments later, the raven pulls open his butt cheeks again, and you are greeted of a close-up view of the raven&#39;s own behind, reflected in a full-size mirror.  His tailfeathers are raised up, and you can see him using his taloned hands to spread his feathery cheeks.  And in the middle, is his tailhole.  A familiar sight, given you just pushed yourself into it only minutes ago.  Visibly, there&#39;s nothing different about it.  But you are well aware that you aren&#39;t just looking at the raven&#39;s tailhole this time, but a reflection of yourself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to your new home, my anus.&quot;</p>
