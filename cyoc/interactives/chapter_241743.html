<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jules found himself in a endless hallway. <br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t sure how he had got there, but there was a faint light at the end of the hallway. For some unexplainable, reason, he knew he had to reach it, and he began to run. Despite his considerable speed, he seemed to make very little progress, almost like the hallway was getting longer the more he ran. As he ran, he started to think about his life.<br />
<br />
He remembered how his mother used to sing to him when he was young, and how his father used to play with him. He was happy. That all changed when his mother passed away. His father had not taken the loss well, and used alcohol to cope, which furher distanced him from a young Jules as they fell into poverty. As Jules grew up, he vowed that if he one day became a father, he wouldn&#39;t let his children grow up in the same way. Even if he would be faced with personal loss, he would persevere, much like he had growing up, for the sake of his children.<br />
<br />
Jules saw the the light at the end of the hallway get much bigger. He had to be close now. But why was he even in this hallway? This all felt, surreal. Despite the fact that he had been running for a long while, he did not feel tired at all. As he reached the light, it seemed to dim, revealing an ordinary door. Jules felt a chill creep up his spine, an unnerving feeling that he would regret opening this door. But as there was seemingly no other way out, Jules took a deep breath, and opened the door.<br />
<br />
On the other side of the door, was a small roon, with a tiny, young girl, who coudln&#39;t be more than 6 years old. The girl seemed rather distressed. As Jules looked at her, he couldn&#39;t help but feel that she bore a striking resemblance to... Himself? The girl&#39;s eyes suddenly lit up as her eyes met with Jules.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jules suddenly awoke in a cold sweat in his bed, gasping for air, what the hell was-<br />
<br />
His voice wasn&#39;t his own, it sounded strangely feminine. His eyes darted downwards, as he saw two breasts and a protruding belly, he started to remember everything that had occured before he fainted. Was he... Was that little girl... Could he really be... Pregnant?<br />
<br />
Suddenly Rob entered the room, &quot;Oh thank god you&#39;re awake Julie!&quot;, Rob said, giving Jules a hug, &quot;I-I wasn&#39;t sure what to do when you passed out! I took you back to bed and just panicked. I was just about to call an ambulance when I heard you wake up! Are you feeling okay? You were acting real weird and saying some strange shit right before passing out!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jules just started in silence at Rob as he started to panic internally. God, this really was happening, wasn&#39;t it? But how, how the hell did he end up like this? While he was still processing what was happening, he saw Rob&#39;s face increasingly grow more worried with the lack of a response, and he quickly stuttered something out<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yes, I am feeling better, I-I just, I didn&#39;t remember anything!&quot; Jules squeaked, technically telling the truth. Robs face seemed to calm down slightly, &quot;Oh, when you wake up and can&#39;t remember anything, doesn&#39;t that have a name? Amnesellic, or something, I think. So that&#39;s why you were so shocked when I said you were pregnant! I get it now! Does that happen when you are pregnant or something? Wait, do you remember everything now, babe?&quot;, Rob asked, concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-well, not exactly, no,&quot; Jules admitted, still technically telling the truth. &quot;It&#39;s okay babe, you can ask me about anything that you don&#39;t remember!&quot;, Rob said, a proud smile forming upon his cheeks. &quot;No, that&#39;s alright, I think... I think I just need, uh, a glass of water?&quot; Jules blurted out, not wanting to learn more details about this horrifying predicament. &quot;I&#39;m on it&quot; Rob said, quickly scambering out of the room, leaving Jules to his own thoughts.<br />
<br />
Jules fearfully removed the blanket and looked fearfully down at his- her? New body. He was unable to focus on anything except the belly. It reminded him a bit of the beer belly that his father had acquired from several years of drinking, but he would much rather that this was a beer belly. He... He was pregnant, with Robs child, it seemed. He didn&#39;t understand how or why, but he could not deny that was the reality he was now living in. And... Was he... Going to give... B-birth? The very idea horrified Jules, as he suddenly felt an unfamiliar movement from his stomach. Oh god, that was- a kick? The baby just fucking kicked!<br />
<br />
Nonononononononono! Jules refused to accept this, starting to slightly hyperventilate. If he suddenly changed in this manner, there had to be a way suddenly to change back. The last thing he remembered before suddenly waking up pregnant was sitting in the bathroom stall. But he had done that many times before, what was different this time? That was when it clicked. That stone he took from the janitor, it glowed slightly before changing him! He couldn&#39;t think of anything else. But, where the hell was the stone now?</p>
