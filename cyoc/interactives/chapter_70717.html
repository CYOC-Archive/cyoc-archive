<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bradley stared at his genitals for a bit longer, still believing he'd done nothing wrong and that there was absolutely no reason as to why he was being turned into a Mare. A snort escaped him and letting his eyes drift away, he took in how from the haunches down to his rear feet he looked like a horse, completely with a covering of soft, white horse hair. Shifting, he stood and gazed about the pasture, still trying to wrap his mind around the fact that he now went about on four legs rather than two.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir,&quot; a voice said, breaking his concentration from where he was standing and looking in the direction, he watched as his father and gypsy man approached, the new help saying, &quot;It this one I wish to purchase from you. She's good at the tasks she does and I believe her thread is good enough to breed,&quot; as he indicated toward Bradley.<br />
<br />
Realising that his father was talking about selling him, Bradley whinnied out, &quot;Please don't sell me. Not to this man,&quot; distraught over what was happening to him.<br />
<br />
As the two approached Bradley, apparently not understanding what he was saying, they continued to talk. As they did this, the gypsy man ran a hand over Bradley, starting at Bradley's flank and hunches and moving forward. Feeling something cool being rubbed over him, Bradley neighed out, &quot;What are you doing,&quot; as he skipped a couple steps to his left.<br />
<br />
Chuckling, the gypsy man replied, &quot;She's a spirited girl,&quot; as Bradley's father laughed in response and clapped a friendly on Bradley's back and replied, &quot;Yes she is.&quot;<br />
<br />
And than the gypsy man started once again rubbing Bradley once again. As he did this, he and Bradley's father returned to talking about price and why the Roma wanted to purchase Bradley and after a bit the gypsy man stopped rubbing Bradley, ending at his face, and turning, he grinned as Bradley's father said, &quot;Well, than the only thing now is to draw up the bill of sale.&quot;<br />
<br />
Horror washing over Bradley as he realised he was being sold, he watched as the two turned and began walking back across the pasture. Wanting to follow and make his father understand, Bradley took a step, but than stopped as he realised that something was off.<br />
<br />
Gazing down at his arms and hands, he let out a squeal of alarm as he watched his arms transform into the front legs of a horse. As they did this, a white hair started to cover his forelegs and than his hands started to morph into hooves. Looking up, alarm spreading through him, unaware that it wasn't just his arms and hands that were transforming but also his ears, face and hair, Bradley took off at a quick gallop toward the stables.<br />
<br />
As he approached the barns, he let out a neigh of alarm as he finally realised that his nose was lengthening into a proper horse muzzle and wanting to find something reflective, he looked about and seeing the horse trough, Bradley cantered over to it.<br />
<br />
Peering in, he let out a combination of a squeal and a snort as he saw not his normal human face, but the head of a horse. Shaking his head, watching his mane flop about, Bradley realised that whatever the gypsy man had been rubbing on him had finished the transformation and that he was now fully a mare. The sound of somebody approaching caught his attention and looking in the direction, he saw his father and the gypsy man coming toward him, a halter in his father's hand.<br />
<br />
A feeling of wanting to run, to cry, to do something crossed Bradley's mind, but instead he neighed out, &quot;Please don't sell me. Whatever I did wrong, I won't do it again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure what he'd done to deserve being turned into a Mare, Bradley watched as his father fastened the halter over him and than handed the lead to the gypsy man. As the gypsy man thanked him, Bradley's father commented, &quot;You ever need a vet for Bradley here, don't be afraid to stop by,&quot; to which the Roma man thanked him again and than, making a clicking noise, began to lead Bradley away.<br />
<br />
Wanting to stay, Bradley glanced back at his father, but was immediately disappointed when he noticed the man had turned away and was heading for the stables. Realising that he was being treated just like any of horse on the farm and that he'd been sold like any other domesticated animal, Bradley let out a whinny.<br />
<br />
As he was led toward a trailer, Bradley heard the gypsy man comment, &quot;I know you can understand me, Bradley. Though you appear to be horse, your mind is still human. And it shall be like that until you learn what you did wrong and repent for your transgressions,&quot; and opening the back of the trailer, the Roma man explained, &quot;My clan of gypsy, the ones running the carnival, are a long lived sort. We have been alive since the seventeenth century and will be alive a long time from now. As will you, Bradley. You have a long life as a work and breed horse ahead of you. So until you figure out your crime, you may as well get used to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Neighing out, &quot;I don't want to be a horse. I didn't do anything wrong,&quot; Bradley listened as the gypsy man chuckled and than, without another word, slammed shut the trailer.<br />
<br />
A feeling of wanting to cry came over Bradley and as he heard another door slam shut, this one coming from the cab of the truck, Bradley let out a nicker of frustration, followed by a snort and squeezing his eyes shut, he wondered what he should do. Within a short time, Bradley found himself back at the carnival. Being led to a horse corral, Bradley looked at the other horses and after a moment, trotted away, wanting only to be left along.<br />
----<br />
<br />
As Bradley adjusted to his new life as a horse, attempting to learn what he'd done wrong, the gypsy carnival eventually packed up and moved on. Soon it came to a new stop and with it, more people came to visit and be transformed.</p>
