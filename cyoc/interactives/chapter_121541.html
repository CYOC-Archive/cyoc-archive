<br />
The past hour was a lot to take in.  Reuniting with your family, sending them away, and becoming Rowan&#39;s true brother rather than a familiar.  It was just too much.  You decided that the best way to take it all in and understand the situation was to walk around the mansion Rowan just created.  You noticed that it was just like your castle back in Kelper.  The furniture, decor, everything!  This made you feel right at home.  Yet, there was something about it that you didn&#39;t like.  This was not Kelper.  This was not the world you only thought would exist in fantasy.  This was the USA.  This was New Jersey.  You should at least live like that fact.  After walking around for a bit, you came across Rowan, who was sitting in a study room.  &quot;Ah, Adrian.&quot;  He smiled, looking at you from behind his book.  &quot;What brings you here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Brother.&quot;  You chuckled.  &quot;We&#39;re not in Kelper anymore.  We should at least have a home that reflects that fact.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;  He asked, wondering how you were going to follow up that statement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, as you said when I first met you.&quot;  You started, your hand glowing green.  &quot;While my plane, this plane, excels at creating technology, yours excels at magic.  I think our house should have that technology.  Rather than recreate our castle from back in Kelper, I think I&#39;d rather live in a mansion that reflects this plane.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go right ahead Adrian.&quot;  Rowan smiled.  &quot;You&#39;re not a familiar anymore.  You don&#39;t need my permission to do things anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.&quot;  You smiled.  &quot;I just wanted to let you know.&quot;  The green energy surrounding your hand glowed even brighter, before flooding the whole mansion.  Soon, it changed from medieval castle to modern mansion.  The once antique-looking furniture transformed into the latest kind.  The study, once full of scrolls and books, was replaced with a sleek and elegant looking library, complete with computerized catalog.  The layout transformed into one reflecting modern architecture.  An open floor plan living room and kitchen, decorated with pictures of you, Rowan, and many other beautiful things.  Every single nook and cranny of the mansion was changed to reflect your vision.  Rowan could only gasp.  &quot;This is more like it.&quot;  You smiled, proud of your work.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is how people of this plane live?&quot;  Rowan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;More or less.&quot;  You smiled.  &quot;I added a couple of my own flares and magical things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s a great deal of things I don&#39;t understand about this plane.&quot;  Rowan laughed, looking and prodding at a wall-mounted TV.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;m here for Bro.&quot;  You laughed.  &quot;Come here.&quot;  You showed your older brother around the mansion, explaining every single piece of technology in it, from the microwave oven to the shower.  You even taught him how to use a computer, which you carefully programmed to accept input in both the draconic and demonic languages.  You really impressed your new older brother.<br />
<br />
It took almost 36 hours to explain the whole house to Rowan, but that&#39;s fine.  When you&#39;re an immortal being that doesn&#39;t need to eat or sleep, you have a lot of time to kill.  Once you were completely finished, you showed Rowan to his bedroom, one of the two Master suites.  You joked about having a bedroom despite not sleeping while giving Rowan the grand tour.  You told Rowan that he could shape his bedroom however he desired, as it was his private suite.  You even set up guidelines about how to show whether or not you desired privacy.  Not that you would ever need to use them.  You and Rowan were closer than any other two beings.  The bond you shared was much stronger than brothers.  Much stronger than friends and family.  You were connected by soul.  Your souls were intertwined.<br />
<br />
Once the full tour was over, you retreated to your bedroom, which was a large suite, complete with walk in closet, study, and bathroom.  As you laid down on your gigantic bed, you started to think.  How were you going to start your takeover of this plane?  Would it be hostile?  Will it be quick?  What did you want to do exactly?  After pondering for quite some time, you decided that the best way to clear your head was to shower.  Shower thoughts always make sense, right?  As you were taking off your shirt, you realized that this was going to be the first proper shower you had in nine years.  You needed to make this one count!  As you dwelled on this thought, looking at your shirtless, toned body in the mirror, you came to a conclusion about how you&#39;d conquer the plane.<br />

September 30, 2017<br />
<br />
As you stepped out of your car, you looked up to the sky.  The skyscrapers of New York City lined your field of vision, which centered on a near cloudless sky.  As you looked down, you saw the busy Times Square in front of you.  All around you were people, shops, tourists, theaters, restaurants, and more.  Cars lined up at the traffic lights, people lined up on the sidewalks, and costumed performers danced by the streets.  It was a normal autumn day in New York City.  That was about to change soon.  Rowan stood next to you, looking at the scene play out in front of him.  However, it didn&#39;t take long for people to realize that the billionaire Tyrell Brothers were standing in the middle of Times Square, minding their own business.  People rushed over to you, asking you many questions about how you made your money, and how you were so successful at such a young age.  It was too much, and the violet fires in Rowan&#39;s eyes lit up.  You put your hand out in front of him, signaling him to calm down.  &quot;Rowan.&quot;  You said to him.  &quot;Try to keep your cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about that Adrian.&quot;  He started.  &quot;I don&#39;t like being mobbed.&quot;  As soon as he said that, the mob of people backed away.  &quot;Thank you.  I need personal space.&quot;  Once the two of you were alone once more, you sent out an invisible wave of magic to subconsciously deter people from hounding you and Rowan.<br />
<br />
After walking around Times Square for a bit, you decided to start the plan.  You started to grin an evil grin as you walked into the middle of the busy intersection.  Cars swerved all around, crashing into each other.  People looked on in horror as who they thought was a young billionaire walked into busy traffic.  At one point, one of the cars came rushing towards you.  People everywhere were terrified to watch you bite the dust.  But they were not ready to watch what actually happened.  The car crashed into you and stopped immediately.  It was as if it had hit a metal pole.  You were fine, but the car was mangled beyond repair.  You laughed as you walked over to the car, reached under it, and picked it up like it was made of paper.  People were screaming in terror, exactly as you planned.  You took the car and magically threw it into a building.  It exploded, taking the building down with it.  As soon as you made your presence known, you transformed into the Angel of Death, pointed your finger to the sky, and shot a beam of pure black energy directly up.  Rowan followed suit, and the two beams collided in mid air.  Dark clouds swirled around the beams, causing the beautifully blue sky to turn ominously black.  Dark purple lightning poured from the clouds, striking everything.  A cacophony of loud booms and lightning cracks enveloped the whole city, as you and Rowan flew to the top of the Empire State Building.  You perched at the top of the antenna of the skyscraper, before turning into your large dragon form.  Your body was enveloped in dark blue scales as your red eyes turned sapphire blue.  As you roared from the top of the building, spitting dark flames all over the city, Rowan started his part.  &quot;Citizens of New York City.  You are the first to witness the beginning of my takeover.  You may know my brother and me as the billionaire Tyrell brothers, but thinking that this alias was true would be foolish.  I am no billionaire investor.  I am a God.  My brother is a God.  Together, we will rule this, and every universe.  Say goodbye to your foolish beliefs, your false Gods and religions, and accept us as your rulers.  Resistance will bring only punishments worse than death.&quot;  Rowan smiled evilly as he pointed his finger down the antenna of the skyscraper.  It glowed black before engulfing the whole building in a sea of black energy.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, you switched buildings to the Chrysler Building.  You watched as the mortals below you cowered in fear.  Many were running for their lives while other were petrified.  After destroying the building with your claws, you transformed back into your human form and landed on the street.  A small crater formed by your feet from the impact.  You loved being the God that you were.  As you stood in your little crater, watching the mortals cower in fear from your presence, you couldn&#39;t help but laugh an evil laugh.  &quot;You mortals.&quot;  You laughed evilly.  &quot;Watching weaklings like you cower in fear before me makes me feel so good.  Anyway, I have a proposition for you.  Bow before me or suffer for eternity.&quot;  People continued running from you in fear as if you&#39;d never said anything.  You stretched out your arm and immobilized all of the people running.  Thrusting your arm back, you forced them all to rush to directly in front of you.  &quot;I said bow before me or suffer for eternity.  Which do you choose?&quot;  You said with a slightly agitated tone.  People in front of you were bowing, most likely out of fear.  &quot;Perfect.  This is how you are supposed to treat a God.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;F-f-freeze!&quot;  Someone yelled, clearly terrified.  You turned your head and noticed someone holding a gun towards you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect.&quot;  You grinned.  &quot;You now have an example of the fate you narrowly avoided.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m warning you!  I&#39;ll shoot!&quot;  He stuttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please shoot!  Make my day!&quot;  You yelled, laughing.  &quot;Prove to me what mortals like you can do to me!&quot;  The man shot his gun, the bullet careening towards your head.  You let it collide with your temple, and let the gunman watch it harmlessly crumple against your head.  The gunman screamed as he tried to run away, terrified.  Before the bullet reached the ground though, he was in your clutches.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you?&quot;  He cried.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am many things.  A dragon, a demon, a human, and a God.  Right now though, that doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;  You grinned, terrifying the man.  You grabbed his neck and held him in the air with one hand, proving your physical might to the terrified onlookers.  Your hand started to amass a terrifying black and white aura.  &quot;What you are about to witness, my hopefully loyal subjects, is what happens if you defy me or my brother.&quot;  The aura surrounded the gunman&#39;s body, before being absorbed into it.  You let go of him, sending him falling to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do to him?&quot;  One bowing woman asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll forgive the lack of formality for now, as I have not gone over how to properly address your new God.&quot;  You started.  &quot;I made him unable to die.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would you do that?&quot;  Another bowing man asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad you asked.&quot;  You laughed as you grabbed the gunman and threw him into a building, sending him through it and watching him land on the street on the other side.  &quot;It&#39;s so I can do that to him without risking him dying.&quot;  You snapped your fingers and watched as he sped back towards you.  With another snap, he disappeared.  &quot;Before you ask where he is, he&#39;s currently rotting in a dungeon with some other traitors.  Now, my subjects, you will spread news of what happened here in New York.  By the end of the week, I will leave my mark here.  Any person left in the city will perish.  Let the world know that it has new rulers.  Finally, if you are ever addressing me, refer to me as My Lord.  My brother will be My King.  He&#39;s more powerful than I and prefers the title of King.  I prefer Lord.  Are we clear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes My Lord.&quot;  The crowd of people in front of you bowed before running off around the city.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rowan?&quot;  You asked telepathically.  &quot;How are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty well.  Amassed some followers for our cause.  You?&quot;  Rowan casually responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Same.  One guy tried to shoot me with a gun, that thing I told you about that shoots metal really fast.&quot;  You laughed.  &quot;He&#39;s currently in the dungeon with no functional bones.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice.&quot;  Rowan laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  By the way, I told my followers that they have one week before the city ceases to exist, and to address you as King.&quot;  You added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just like the plan you hatched up.&quot;  Rowan laughed.  &quot;I did the same.  You don&#39;t have to tell me that you&#39;re following the plan you made!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Bro.&quot;  You laughed.  &quot;Still used to being the familiar.  Did you have fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;  Rowan answered.  &quot;Although I still haven&#39;t gotten to experience my full power.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, same.&quot;  You said.  &quot;I barely even used a fraction of my power.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Soon though.&quot;  Rowan said with an evil tone.  &quot;Soon.&quot;  After terrorizing the city for a couple more hours, all the while amassing more followers, you headed to your mansion in Alpine.  You celebrated a job well done with watching the news about your attack.  News outlets from all around the world were commenting on your spree in New York.  &quot;They don&#39;t realize that this is not even the beginning.&quot;  Rowan chuckled, drinking a glass of wine.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just excited for when we really let loose.&quot;  You smiled alongside your brother, holding a glass of the same wine.  &quot;Here&#39;s to the beginning of our Godhood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here&#39;s to that indeed.&quot;  Rowan smiled, clinking his glass with yours.<br />
