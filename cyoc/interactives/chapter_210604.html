<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff looked around. The living room he was in was quite expansive, and several cat toys were neatly placed in a bin near a few other cat accessories. A vast window opened out to a gorgeous view of a treeline and a lake in the distance. The furniture was also seemingly high quality, comfortable and modern in design, including a large television and a few game consoles and other electronic devices. He looked behind him to see the space open up into a kitchen and dining area, with pristine wooden flooring and plush rugs. A couple bowls were situated on the floor, one reading Mist and the other turned away at the moment, as well as a water bowl. He noted that while the bowl likely intended for the other cat seemed to contain cat food, his own bowl seemed to contain some ground hamburger, with other things mixed in. He smiled. It seems he was already being spoiled, by cat standards.<br />
<br />
He looked down at himself. He was still clothed, and entirely human, at least from what he could tell. But he knew the clock was ticking, and that his changes would soon begin. He actually made sure his clothes were part of that change before, making it so they would adjust with him but fade from reality as he became more catlike. He also set it so his shirt collar would transform into his cat collar. It would make it easier on him, he felt.<br />
<br />
Having nothing else better to do, Jeff walked around to search for his owners, and the other cat. He searched around the expansive household, finding bedrooms, bathrooms, and the garage, which held a parked luxury car. Closing the door, he figured the humans of the household might be out on some errand. It was then he saw a gray cat turn a corner, moving with purpose. This being the other cat, Jeff paused. He was curious how the cat would treat him, wondering if it would find him to be weird or out of place. But the cat simply approached, sniffed a bit, and went on his way. Jeff watched as it moved down the hall towards the living room. He shrugged, and continued to explore the rest of the house.<br />
<br />
The backyard was expansive and well kept. Jeff noted that it only seemed closed in to keep the cats in, as there wasn&#39;t any surrounding property. Jeff went back inside, noting the cat flap on the door to the yard. There was a door to the basement, and a stairway to another floor with the master bedroom and even a hot tub in the master bathroom. This was the kind of house he would have loved to live in as a human. But as a cat, most of this would be reserved for his owners. He went back to the living room. The other cat was there, seemingly napping on a chair. Jeff went up to him carefully, looking down at him. The cat opened his eyes, looking up to Jeff&#39;s gaze. Jeff wasn&#39;t sure how to act. Cat instincts weren&#39;t set to kick in at the start, only while he was changing. So he simply leaned down and carefully sniffed, repeating the gesture the cat had done to him. The cat didn&#39;t seem bothered by it, so he laid his head back down without a fuss. Jeff moved away from him. Now that he explored the house, he supposed the only thing he could do was wait for the family to return. He decided to follow the example of the gray cat, choosing to lay down on the couch, closing his eyes for a nap. <br />
<br />
It took a while, but Jeff managed to fall asleep. When he awoke, he sat up and looked around again. The gray cat was on the floor licking his fur, minding his own business. Jeff glanced at a clock, seeing it was about thirty minutes later. He considered it a successful catnap. Getting off the couch, he didn&#39;t feel particularly different, so he decided to check again for humans. He figured he would have been awakened sooner if they had arrived, but he really couldn&#39;t think of another thing for him to do. He was worried he was going to get bored with being a cat, but he wanted to at least let the transformation happen fully before he made any judgments on if he wanted to ride the rest of the time he set for staying a cat out. Nobody was home, but he had figured as much.<br />
<br />
Jeff wondered if his best option was to take another nap, but he happened upon a different idea. He went up the stairs, through the master bedroom, and into the master bath. He&#39;d set it so he had free reign of the house, so from what he understood, he was to be let into wherever he wanted to be, even if the other cat wasn&#39;t. And since he could open doors and use things still, he was going to enjoy this while he still could. He turned on the hot tub, and waited for a time until it was nice and full of warm water. He stripped completely, and got in, relaxing.<br />
<br />
The hot water felt nice on his still human skin, and he sighed. While he was still human shaped, he could probably get away with utilizing some of his owners&#39; things. He felt himself becoming increasingly erect, suddenly realizing this might be one of the last few times he would be over the coming weeks. He grasped his penis, eager to give it a sendoff it deserved. The warmth of the hot tub and his efforts combined ultimately led to his semen spewing forth. Jeff let his hand settle in the hot tub, content. However, semen continued to drip out into the water, his erection not really going away. Jeff watched for a while, curious, before it finally seemed to stop, at least for now. But his erection remained. Tentatively, he grabbed at it again. His mind wasn&#39;t really clouded by hormones anymore, but nonetheless with some additional coaxing, more sticky bursts of his seed shot forth. This went on for some time, Jeff enjoying the extra bit of pleasure each rope brought, until his testes were seemingly drained of semen entirely.<br />
<br />
Finally spent and satisfied with his time in the hot tub, Jeff let the salty smelling water drain and got out, vigorously drying himself off. After getting his clothes back on he went back down to the living room, the other cat now in the kitchen drinking some water. Jeff felt like he could probably nap again at this point, still warm and content, but he suddenly heard the sound of a car pulling into a drive. Jeff perked up, as did the other cat, though he swiftly returned to drinking water. Jeff moved to the door, still standing, eager to see how his new owners would treat him.<br />
<br />
The first to open the door was the woman, her left hand holding a couple bags of groceries. She smiled seeing Jeff, but moved past him, seeming to be moving towards the kitchen. She was followed by a young girl, perhaps 8 or 9, who enthusiatically came up to Jeff. &quot;We&#39;re back Misty!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled at her, as she raised her hand up. Jeff quickly leaned down, and the girl patted him on the head a few times. He closed his eyes as she stroked his hair, smiling. It had really worked, they saw him as a cat!<br />
<br />
The man came in last, well dressed yet somewhat rugged looking, and he watched the girl pet Jeff for a moment before he spoke up, saying, &quot;You can play with Mist later, Lucy, you promised to help daddy put the groceries away,&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy pulled her hand away and followed her father to the kitchen. Jeff followed them, but settled in the living room on the couch, waiting for them to get done. He watched and listened, learning the man&#39;s name was Terry and his wife was Grace. Once the groceries were done, Lucy came to sit next to Jeff, who curled up as tight as he could and let the her pet him. It was pleasant. He was already fond of her, and when her father came and stroked him a bit under his chin, he could tell he was loved by the whole family. Jeff noticed the other cat now walk into the space, eying him and Lucy a bit. She smiled at the cat, saying, &quot;I&#39;d pet you if you let me, Steam!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff looked at Steam, who turned away as if to huff in jealous frustration. Jeff hopped down off the couch, moving on hands and knees over to the him, still human in his form, but nobody cared. He nuzzled Steam a bit, eliciting some &quot;Aww&quot;s from Lucy and her mother. Steam hesitated, but licked Jeff&#39;s face a couple times in approval before heading to the chair once again. After some time, the family dispersed, leaving Jeff and Steam alone in the living room. Jeff stretched out on the couch, smiling. He looked at Steam, curled up on the chair, and laughed a bit to himself. It was funny how the cat had a name that matched the one he had chosen for his new cat self. Steam and Mist, a pair of housecats for a lovely family. He yawned, now feeling ready for another nap.<br />
<br />
He woke up some time later. He got up and stretched, checking the clock once again, but realizing he didn&#39;t really know when he actually fell asleep. It was about four hours since he&#39;d first arrived, though. He decided to go check a mirror. Maybe the first changes had begun. As he walked, he already felt a bit shorter. Things he had seen at about eye level were now perhaps an inch or two above that. He moved to a hanging mirror, and saw his face. Not much was different, but he saw his ears were a bit pointier and his eyes a bit of a different shade of blue. He felt giddy. The changes were really happening! Soon he&#39;d be a cat. For now, though, he realized he was hungry. <br />
<br />
He moved to his bowl, labelled Mist, and got down to smell it. The scent was a touch spicy, and there were some stir-fried bell peppers mixed in with the meat. He smiled, and dug in, not caring about the lack of silverware, but being cautious to not get it in his eyes. He noted his teeth felt a bit different to his tongue, which only made him more excited. After he finished, he licked his lips, and eyed the bowl once more. Now devoid of food, yet still proudly displaying &quot;Mist&quot; upon its front. He smiled. He didn&#39;t look it just yet, but he was a cat named Mist. His owners said so, his bowl said so. And slowly his body was saying so too. He noticed a bowl of what seemed to be milk set aside for him, specifically, and he went to drink from it. Doing so, he suddenly realized it was melted vanilla ice cream, which was all the better. The lingering spice in his mouth from the meal faded with each lap from the bowl.<br />
<br />
Mist noted it was pretty late now. He decided to go to the guest bedroom to actually sleep, but on the way he was stopped by Lucy. &quot;Goodnight, Misty,&quot;<br />
<br />
Mist leaned down to let Lucy pet him again, but she gave him a hug instead. Softly, he whispered, &quot;Goodnight, Lucy,&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy paid it no mind, because as of right now Mist could still talk like a human. So it was normal to her. But she hugged him tighter, before letting go to head off to sleep. Mist sat there for a while, content, until the adults moved out from her room and up to their own bedroom. He turned to watch them as they disappeared up the stairs. He decided it would probably be fine to sleep himself, even after his two naps. He went to the guest bedroom, laid down to rest. He was eager to see what he would be like in the morning.</p>
