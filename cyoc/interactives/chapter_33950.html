<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ray watched just long enough to see Nate kneel before James and take his balloon cock deep into his throat. Soft, rubbery squeaks mingled with the two men's groans as Nate slid his lips up and down the shaft, his own balloon cock squeaking softly as he stroked himself slowly. Glancing down, Ray saw Nate's legs darken and grow shiny, his feet pulling in and inflating as they turned into latex hooves. Apparently, whatever magic was causing the changes in all of them was triggered by sex. Still, not a bad way to go, Ray thought wistfully as he turned and walked into the house.<br />
Walking inside, Ray was met by a similar sight to the one outside as he saw Jake and Matt cuddled on the couch in the living room. The two men were wrapped tightly around each other, lips locked in a passionate kiss as their hands stroked each other's cocks and tails. Their latex-covered legs rubbed together noisily, and their faces had pushed out slightly into small muzzles. Glancing back over his shoulder, Ray saw through the open porch door that Nate and James were now sprawling on the pool deck in a passionate 69, their bodies a rich brown color that shined in the sun. A low moan brought his attention back to the couch, where Matt now had his head bent to Jake's cock and was deep-throating the man's large balloon cock. Another low moan came from somewhere off to his left, and he turned to see another man sitting on a folding chair up against the wall, his hand grasping and stroking himself through his white shorts as he watched the two men going at it on the couch. <br />
Ray reached down to fondle his own groin, feeling his cock ballooning out as he wrapped his hand around it, and sauntered over to the other man. He stopped right in front of him, noting the guy appeared to be close to his own age, and let his cock bob freely before the young man's face. No words were exchanged as the man glanced up briefly, and, seeing Ray nod, eagerly lowered his face to take the proffered cock into his mouth. Wrapping his lips around it, he ran his tongue along the shaft, eliciting small squeaks and moaning with pleasure at the feel and taste. Ray gasped as the moans sent tingles through his body, his cock inflating even more and forcing its way down the man's throat. As the man continued to suck him, Ray noticed the magic working quickly to change him, his skin darkening slightly as his ears began to grow long and pointed, hissing softly as they inflated.<br />
The man seemed to notice as he pulled off Ray's cock and reached up to rub his hands along his ears, shuddering slightly at the touch as they squeaked softly.<br />
&quot;Feels good, huh?&quot; Ray asked. The man gave a slight nod, glancing toward the couch where Matt and Jake were now locked in a 69. Their bodies now gleamed in the dim light, seeming to be almost completely brown, shiny latex, and squeaked noisily as they continued to rub against each other. Out by the pool, James and Nate continued to down each other's cocks, not realizing or not caring that they were looking more like donkeys and less like men with each passing moment. Even now, their hands were reshaping into rubbery hooves as they bucked and thrust against each other.<br />
&quot;I'm scared, though,&quot; the man whispered.<br />
&quot;What's your name?&quot; Ray asked.<br />
&quot;Tim.&quot;<br />
Ray smiled, pulling Tim gently to his feet. One hand wrapped around his waist to pull him close, the other reaching down to cup Tim's balls, eliciting a low moan. &quot;Don't worry,&quot; he said. &quot;It will be okay.&quot;<br />
Leaning into each other, the two men shared a deep kiss as Ray slipped his hand inside Tim's shorts and wrapped it around his cock. The young man was fully aroused, his cock seeming to grow even bigger as they kissed. Large bulges in both the front and back of his shorts soon caused them to slip down his legs, a tail sprouting from his ass as his cock swelled out before him, the skin turning a rich brown color and inflating like a balloon. <br />
Tim stopped to stare at his balloon cock, rubbing his hand along the smooth, shiny length. He moaned in ecstasy as Ray knelt before him and wrapped his lips around it, sliding along the rubbery shaft. Tim could only shudder and gasp at the sensations. Never had he felt anything as good as this. <br />
&quot;Ah, ah, ah, ahhhhHEEE....HAWHEE,&quot; he cried, his gasps becoming brays as the changes seemed to spread through him faster. Ray watched as the color of Tim's cock spread down his legs, the skin turning a shiny dark brown as they became latex. He let go of Tim's cock to watch his feet pull in and turn into rubbery hooves. As he stood, he ran his hands along Tim's back, feeling soft rubbery bristles beginning to form a mane down his spine. <br />
He glanced out to the deck to see a couple of balloon donkeys lying near the pool, Nate and James having apparently completed their changes, while over on the couch, Matt and Jeff seemed to nearing the end of their own changes. Both men were grunting and squeaking loudly now, their muzzles complete and their hands turning into hooves even as they bucked wildly against each other. A hand stroked softly along his lengthening face, and he turned to gaze into Tim's deep brown eyes. <br />
&quot;Like you said,&quot; Tim whispered, &quot;It will be okay.&quot; <br />
The two men wrapped their arms around each other and shared a deep kiss as they stroked each other's bodies. They could feel themselves turning faster as their passion grew, smooth latex spreading over their chests, backs, and arms. Tim pushed Ray down to the floor, wrapping his lips around his cock as he turned his body around to straddle Ray's chest, moving into a 69 position. Ray eagerly swallowed Tim's cock, feeling it inflate further and fill the back of his throat. Loud grunts and brays brought his attention back to the couch, and he watched out of the corner of his eye as Matt and Jake thrashed on the couch. The two men were now almost completely changed, their cocks and balls pulling back into their shrinking bodies. Nozzles popped out from where their belly buttons would have been, and their limbs seemed to be stiffening up. Suddenly, Matt and Jeff each let out a loud bray that was abruptly cut off as each man's mouth sealed shut. Ray watched a final shudder pass through each of them as they slid off the couch and gently bounced a couple times on the floor and lay still, their transformations complete. The thought that he and Tim would soon be joining them only served to excite him more, and he began to thrust himself wildly into Tim's throat as if to speed up the changes. Tim seemed to get the idea as he sped up his own actions in time with Ray's.<br />
Their bodies squeaked noisily against each other as they bucked and thrust, their groans turning to brays as they changed. Ray felt his hands tighten, the fingers merging as they swelled up into balloon hooves, his nose and mouth stretching out into a full muzzle. He welcomed the changes, feeling his orgasm building. He could feel Tim's cock slipping from his mouth as it started to pull back into his body, his own cock shrinking even as the pleasure grew. The two continued to buck against each other, grunting and braying like animals. Ray felt his mouth seal shut but no longer cared as he felt the most intense orgasm he'd ever had surge through his body. He felt Tim's body shuddering against his own as they shared their climaxes, then neither of them could move any more. <br />
The changes were now complete, and a half dozen donkey pool toys lay around the house, each filled with a warm, satisfied glow.</p>
