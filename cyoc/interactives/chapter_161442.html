<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;This nap will complete your changes. While you will be as real a donkey as if you were born one, you can still understand me for one simple reason.&quot; Irene said to Carissa and her mate Randy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Every kid that comes to this island and acts like an animal, devoid of rules, we urge them on trying to get them to accept their changes. Most children go into a panic when their animal spirit begins molding their body to fit their behavior. However this time something interesting has happened. The majority of the kids that came with this group changed willingly. Most of them weren&#39;t aware of the changes, they just adapted to them as they happened, unwilling to stop having fun.&quot; Irene explained to Carissa, &quot;A few, such as you and your mate, even sought the changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Later, while the couple slept, Randy&#39;s hands and feet shifted as he dreamt, curling into shiny black hooves while his arms lengthened and his thighs and legs straightened out. He brayed in his sleep, the bray pushing his mouth into a full muzzle. This woke him up. Standing to all four hooves he looked around. <br />
<br />
Carissa was laying asleep next to him. Randy gave a soft snort as fur covered his body in a wave, and settled back down to sleep, now a complete donkey. <br />
<br />
&quot;I apologize for waking you. I have instructions for you and all the donkeys of this island. We are going change this place. I want it to become an amusement park that draws the donkey out of people....willingly. The kids that come here will eventually be just like you and Carissa. Some may struggle at first, but in the end they will either accept or actively seek the changes&quot;, said Irene to Randy.<br />
<br />
When the two donkeys finally woke, Randy and Carissa spent the next few months wandering the island along with the other kids turned donkeys. Although they had let go of all human desire shortly before their body corrected itself, they had retained a bit of intelligence. This further degraded the longer they behaved like their bodies desired. By the second month, they were no different from any natural born donkey. <br />
<br />
Carissa and Randy Crawley always brayed at the newcomers kids, most kids ignored them and ran wildly by towards whatever caught their fancy, though. But a few of them stopped to pet Carissa and Randy. Guided by the instinct planted by their guiding donkey spirit, they trotted slowly after the mob of children, making sure to always be in sight of at least a group of kids.<br />
<br />
The human children on the island weren&#39;t acting like human children. They were going absolutely wild. Not one of them was holding back. <br />
<br />
While many children were petting them, most didn&#39;t have an attention span long enough to stay in place for more than a minute. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi there guys!&quot; Came a small voice Carissa looked up from the grass to what looked like a seven year old girl walking towards them. She could only have been four feet tall. The girl ran the rest of the way to them, throwing her arms around Carissa and Randy with the typical girly cries of cuteness. <br />
<br />
Carissa looked up from her grazing and brayed greeting at the girl. The girl broke the pattern of the short attention spanned kids. She had been moving from donkey to donkey, petting each slowly. She spent most of this time with Carissa. &quot;My name is Jenny.&quot; Lowering her voice to a conspiratorial whisper, she added &quot;Don&#39;t tell anyone, but I&#39;m not supposed to be here.&quot; She whispered in Carissa&#39;s ear with a giggle. &quot;My parents died when I was very little, I live at the homeless shelter and I am not allowed out after curfew,but I saw this flyer for Pleasure island and I couldn&#39;t resist! I snuck into the carriage and here I am, having the time of my life! I&#39;ve been playing anything and everything, even drinking beer! But you guys are a lot more interesting, you listen to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
A bray broke into Randy&#39;s mind followed by Irene: &quot;Adopt her. Show her how to live like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carissa and Randy suddenly moved close and nuzzled the little girl. &quot;He he he! You guys like me?&quot; She giggled at them.<br />
<br />
Randy gave a bray and lowered his head a bit. Jenny&#39;s eyes lit up.<br />
<br />
&quot;A ride!? YAY!!!&quot; Randy lowered his front legs to help the girl climb onto his back, and then trotted slowly through the streets, stopping to let the girl off to play at whatever she wished. But inevitably, she always came back. Smells were changing around the island, becoming more...familiar to the donkeys. <br />
<br />
Occasionally a bray cut through the air, making his ears twitch. Jenny came running back again. &quot;I saw a boy with a tail sticking out of his shorts, and another with long, furry ears like a rabbit.&quot; Instead of panicking, she laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;They were still having fun though!&quot; thought Carissa setted down to rest a bit. Jenny still didn&#39;t leave them. She sat down near them, just watching the kids go by. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my stomach is grumbling at me.&quot; Jenny said pitifully. &quot;I&#39;m hungry, but I don&#39;t want more junk food.&quot; Randy did the only thing he knew how, he nudged Jenny gently towards Carissa where were her teats to nursing her. <br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Jenny asked. Carissa moved her head down towards and looked back to Jenny. <br />
<br />
&quot;You want me to drink that?&quot; Jenny said uncertainly. <br />
<br />
Carissa and Randy brayed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well it&#39;s definitely more healthy.&quot; Jenny said brightly.<br />
<br />
Jenny lowered herself to the ground and gently took one of Carissa&#39;s teats in her hands. She stared at it for a moment before she pressed her face into Carissa.<br />
 <br />
Randy nuzzled the girl as she nursed. Carissa looked at him and brayed happily. Finally, Jenny had her fill and stood. &quot;Thanks Mom!&quot; She joked with a giggle. &quot;I&#39;m going to go play some more!&quot; She ranoff.<br />
<br />
Carissa and Randy returned to their grazing while Jenny ran off to play. Kids continued to stop and pet them. Randy&#39;s ears perked up as he heard braying nearby and a saw a boy falling to all fours.<br />
<br />
No one batted an eye, they just moved up in line. Surprisingly most kids had very few equine aspects to them. A patch of fur here, a tail there. Things seemed to be going at a much slower rate. But Carissa didn&#39;t care. She brayed happily at the site of more of her skin, and returned to her grazing.<br />
<br />
Not one child had panicked as the changes began in the island. The downside was that they seemed to be changing slower than when the island had panicking kids all over it. Most children were running wild around the island, misbehaving to their heart&#39;s content, adapting to changes as they came. The only exceptions were those kids that really went out of control. These children were donkeys within hours. <br />
<br />
Although watching the kids slowly accept their changes was quite enjoyable for Irene, she grazed peacefully behind the coachman&#39; mansion, admiring his shiny hooves and waving tail. <br />
<br />
Jenny was having the time of her life. She felt so young and innocent, like nothing would ever matter again. The little girl did whatever she wanted without the mean people at the shelter telling her what to do. Best of all, everything was free. But what really made the place was the two donkeys she had found while wandering the streets. They were nicer to her than anyone ever had been. Jenny ran wild and free through the island, playing with whatever tickled her fancy at the moment. A boy rudely pushed past her. &quot;Haawwwwwatch where you are going!&quot; The mean boy said, and with a flourish of his tail, ran off into the crowd.<br />
<br />
Jenny sobbed a little bit. Why were kids so mean? She grabbed a beer to drown her tears. The drink was nasty, and she didn&#39;t like it, but it numbed her. Sniffling she tried to shake if off and have some more fun.<br />
<br />
Finally she found what she was looking for. A house with a sign that said &quot;Open for destruction.&quot; Maybe breaking some things would make her feel better. Jenny entered the house and went wild, tearing apart anything she could get her hands on. Jenny was laughing hysterically with the other kids in the house. Continuing to destroy everything she could get her hands on, her laughing began to break as she felt a pressure build in her chest. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha haw haw haw hee haw heeeeeeeeehawwww!&quot; But Jenny couldn&#39;t care less. As she walked out of the house, the boy from earlier ran up to her. He brayed loudly and pushed her to the ground. &quot;Heeee HAW! Out of my way pipsqueak!&quot; With that Jenny broke into crying. Suddenly, she remembered what would make her feel better. The jenny who had given her that delicious milk earlier. <br />
<br />
Not bothering to think about the strangeness of this thought, she gave a high pitched bray and started back towards where she had left them. <br />
<br />
Randy continued his grazing, oblivious to the changing kids around him. The smell of donkey was growing stronger by the moment, and it helped him relax....&quot;Heeeeeeehaawww!&quot; Randy&#39;s ears perked up. That bray had sounded like the small human girl voice that had nursed from his mate earlier. He looked up to see Jenny running towards him, with a donkey eared boy yelling insults at her from behind. <br />
<br />
Carissa brayed at him with fear at the sight of the endangered little girl, and Randy began to feel a instinctual rage build in him. This strange donkey was not going to hurt Jenny! With a loud bray he stood square against the onrushing boy while Jenny hid behind his flank. Randy dug his front hooves into the ground and brayed continuously at the boy until he backed off.With one last full throated bray from Randy, the boy fell on his tail with a yelp and ran away. Satisfied that the threat was gone, Randy turned to look at the small human girl hiding behind him. <br />
<br />
The skin of her ears was now gray. He put his muzzle in her hair and sniffed. She smelled like baby jennet. He felt something tickle the underside of his muzzle. Pulling back, he saw that her ears had grown a good four inches and the gray skin had given way to gray fur. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, Jenny jumped up and hugged him around the neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you soooooo much daddy. That mean boy was going to hurt me!&quot; Jenny put her face into his chest and cried into his fur.<br />
<br />
Randy looked over at Carissa, and nuzzled the small human girl towards her. As Jenny snuggled into the donkey&#39;s fur, she thought of how lucky she was. She had reached her dad just in time. Something felt odd about thinking of the big donkey as her dad, but she didn&#39;t care.<br />
<br />
The kind animal had saved her and shown more attention anyone ever had. She was broken from her happy thoughts when she felt the donkey gently nudging her.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; She asked curiously. The donkey kept nudging her until she was turned around facing the female donkey she had nursed from earlier. A pleasant fog entered her mind. Carissa brayed at her and Jenny felt a strong urge to bray back. &quot;Heeeeeeee Haaaaaaaaawww!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then, Jenny rushed forward and dropped to her knees. Lowering her head to Carissa&#39;s belly. She didn&#39;t bother to use her hands, she just put her mouth to the teat and began to nurse again. The warm milk flowed through her body and made her feel amazing...but strange. Sitting back to better drink, she gave a yelp as she sat painfully on a lump.<br />
<br />
Adjusting to where it didn&#39;t hurt, she continued nursing. Finally, she had her fill. She looked up to see a curious foal braying cutely at her, it was Carissa and Randy&#39;s son.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s play!&quot; Jenny said happily. Randy and Carissa stood up as Jenny started towards their foal. They looked at each other as they noticed thow their foal now towered over the little human. Jenny was no taller than the foal. Suddenly Jenny stopped and turned back to Randy and Carissa.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid of him!&quot; She said shakily as she ran back to hug Carissa&#39;s foreleg. Their foal brayed and they saw Jenny&#39;s little gray ears swivel towards him. <br />
<br />
Slowly she turned around and looked at her foal. Randy nudged her forwards. Jenny looked once more back at the baby donkey. Later, Jenny laughed and ran after the foal, playing chase.The two donkeys watched the human play with their foal. They seemed to have boundless energy. <br />
<br />
Occasionally Jenny would fall to her hands and run on all fours for a few seconds before standing back up. Finally the two tired out. Jenny sat down gingerly as their foal slowly grazed. <br />
<br />
Feeling that their foal and Jenny were safe, they watched the kids of the island. If they could be called kids. Most that they saw were on all fours, and even the ones on two legs were covered in various colors of fur. None of them seemed to care.<br />
<br />
No matter how she tried, Jenny just couldn&#39;t sit comfortably. She felt like she was sitting on a large stump. She kept trying to make the pain stop, but it just wouldn&#39;t. Finally she began to cry. &quot;Mommeeeeehawwwww! Hee Haw! Hee Haw!  I can&#39;t sit doawwwn without hurting!&quot; She whined pitifully to the donkey she had nursed from. <br />
<br />
Jenny turned back around and put her head between her knees rocking back and forth...until she felt a gentle pressure on her back.<br />
<br />
Jenny allowed Carissa to push her up to her hands and knees. With Jenny standing properly now, Carissa saw her adopted foal&#39;s problem.<br />
<br />
The back of the girl&#39;s pants was tented tightly, and black hairs were sticking out through a slight rip at the tip. Her tail was caught! Carissa took the tip of the tented fabric in her teeth, careful not to pull on the hairs of the tassel, and tugged. With a soft rip, the fabric tore, allowing Jenny&#39;s tail to hang free.<br />
<br />
Irene wandered around the island, enjoying the sight of the many donkeys and soon to be donkeys milling about calmly. Finally coming to her favorite pair, she gleefully found that Randy and Carissa had adopted the girl as she suggested.<br />
<br />
The girl was on all fours with her hands and knees on the floor, had small gray ears stuck out to the sides. Her hands were planted in front of her. Carissa was currently pulling at the girl&#39;s pants to free her tail. <br />
<br />
When the gray appendage finally hung free, Irene saw Jenny hop up and hug Carissa. The little girl then turned back to the foal to watch him graze. <br />
<br />
Irene neighed happily. Every kid that had come to the island with this batch was calmly transitioning into their proper bodies....well almost every kid. There was one boy who was virtually unchanged except for the occasional break in his laugh. He wasn&#39;t panicking though. Irene thought hard about this young boy...Yes. The boy clearly had plenty of equine urges. If he stayed here, it would only be a matter of time. But Irene had a better idea. He&#39;d send him back to his parents with these urges. With the power of his spirit growing, there was little doubt that he could get the boy&#39;s parents to adopt their son&#39;s behavior at home.<br />
<br />
Jenny&#39;s desire to wander off into the island had evaporated when she felt her new mom get rid of her pain. She wanted one thing now; to stay with these donkeys forever. Not bothering to get off her hands and knees, she crawled towards her new brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heeeee haaaaww! Leeeet&#39;s plaaaaay!&quot; But the little donkey was absorbed in his eating. Jenny&#39;s stomach grumbled. She watched him as he pulled up clumps of grass. Taking note of how he used his rubbery lips to grip the grass, and his teeth to pull it away, she decided to try it. She put her face to the ground and tried to close her lips on the grass. After several tries her now rubbery lips finally gripped the grass and she ripped some out. <br />
<br />
Chewing slowly, she realized that it was delicious. She turned to her parents happily. &quot;HEEEEEEEEE-HAAAAAAAAAAWWWW!!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two adult donkeys suddenly looked on Jenny with love when they saw her new little muzzle opened with her blocky teeth to let out her first real bray. <br />
<br />
Randy and Carissa trotted over to Jenny and began to groom her. The little girl didn&#39;t speak, she just brayed with joy as her parents licked through her hair. With each lick, Jenny&#39;s hair shortened and darkened until finally, her hair was gone, replaced by short fur with a coal black mane running into her shirt. <br />
<br />
Jenny began to feel itchy. Seeing his daughter&#39;s distress, Randy grabbed her shirt and ripped it off, allowing her gray fur to finish covering her body. <br />
<br />
Jenny tried to get up, but brayed in distress as she wobbled. Randy stuck his head under her to catch her and lower her gently to her front hooves.<br />
<br />
Carissa took care of her pants, ripping them off, revealing her shortened legs tipped with coal black hooves. <br />
<br />
As if sensing her nakedness, the fur rushed to cover the rest of her body. Jenny lowered her head to the ground to rip out another clump of grass moving her tail back and forth. When she looked up, Carissa saw the head of her new foal.The overwhelming affection her parents had suddenly lavished on her had quick chased all worries from her mind. Jenny brayed happily as she curled up with her family to nap.</p>
