<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">---------------------------<br />
Jeff has been sitting in his room. His sight were glummy, all his thought were about Chronivac. His previous changes made world to have bigger and bigger giants, who made him felt small. He tried to find ancestors of these giants and he was surprised. They all have the same proro-giant grandgrand...grandfather. So, he started to recombinate the genes in the way that only his branch has all huge people and other families do not. When he finished, former huge tree became a river, connecting him and this protogiants. He sorted all people alive and dead and cut the branches where someone had comparable size to his giant ancestor. He didn&#39;t know his future size, so this titan was his perfect etalon. Noone should be as high as him or close in muscle mass. When he finsihed he pushed the button.<br />
He waited a few minutes but nothing changes. He has his good musclure body and that&#39;s it. Nothing facinating. Jeff was really upset. He lay on his mattress and fell asleep. Next morning his father knocked into his room.<br />
&quot;Son, time for breakfast&quot; he said.<br />
&quot;Ok, Dad&quot; Jeff stood up and stretched his muscles.<br />
&quot;Come down when you&#39;re ready,&quot; Chris said.<br />
Jeff got dressed and made his way to the kitchen. He saw his father Chris and grandfather Derek there. They were talking about something.<br />
&quot;Hey, son, we&#39;re going to visit our family nest in hte mountains. Do you want to go? I believe it will help to fell better and more confindent for you competition&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, I think it will be a good idea&quot; Jeff said.<br />
After the breakfast, when Jeff felt himself full enough, whole family squissed in the truck and drove to their familie nest. It was a big and beautiful house in the woods, where they could spent the best holidays and rest after hard training. They arrived at noon and started to unpack their things. The door was huge, about 25 feet height and 15 feet wide. House had only one floor anb huge basement. Jeff and Derek were unpacking their things and Chris was cooking the lunch. Than David came over.<br />
&quot;What a beautiful house we have!&quot; he said.<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Derek said.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so hungry, what&#39;s for lunch?&quot; Jeff asked rudly. This house made himself felt smaller, he was mad.<br />
&quot;Patience, son, the food will be ready soon,&quot; David said.<br />
&quot;Jeff, while we are waiting, don&#39;t you want to observe family artifacts?&quot; Derek asked.<br />
&quot;Sure, grandpa&quot; Jeff answered.<br />
Jeff followed Derek inside the house, and they went into a room with many old photographs and other memorabilia.<br />
&quot;Wow, this is amazing,&quot; Jeff said. Giants and titans were looking on him from this photos. Some of them were smaller than Jeff, but the major part were taller and part had better muscles. Jeff looked at the photos, and was amazed by the size of his ancestors.<br />
&quot;They were so big,&quot; he said.<br />
&quot;Yes, they were,&quot; Derek said. &quot;They were very strong and powerful.&quot;<br />
Beside photos and pictures, there were some gym plates, stones and other things. Jeff asked Derek what the meaning of these items. Derek told that it is playing equipment of the ancestors.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you remember how you play with them when you was small boy?&quot; he asked. &quot;I remember that one day you were so proud to lift this plate&quot;. His finger pointed to the stone plate, what was about 950 lbs. &quot;It was heavy but you did it and you were so happy. We were so proud of you, because for your dads it was real weight and you was just a six years old boy. Our Jeffy.&quot;<br />
Jeff felt that his head was spinning. He could feel that his muscles swelled and his body became taller. His cock was throbbing and his balls were swelling.<br />
&quot;Look, grandpa, I can lift it,&quot; Jeff said. The musclebound giant picked up the stone plate with ease, his muscles bulging.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so proud of you,&quot; Derek said.<br />
Derek left the room and Jeff started to lift the plates and stones. He was lifting more and more and more. Each plate was heavier than the previous one. The stone plates were increasing in size and weight. Jeff was feeling great.<br />
He was getting hungry, so he left the room and made his way to the kitchen. There, he saw Chris, David and Derek. They were sitting around a huge table, talking. <br />
&quot;Lunch time!&quot; Chris said.<br />
Jeff sat down at the table, and his father placed a massive plate of food in front of him. <br />
&quot;I make today special local meat. It is a special bread our family made to help us grow. It contain more energy and protein, than the best &quot;Muscle Freak&quot; protein shake&quot; Chris was proud of his cooking skills.<br />
Jeff started eating his lunch, and was surprised at how good it was. His stomach was filling quickly.<br />
&quot;I love this dish. I hope you did extra for my standard 3-plates family grill plate&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
&quot;Of course, son, we know how you like it,&quot; Chris said.<br />
Jeff was feeling lightheaded. His body started to grow, his muscles swelling and his cock getting bigger. His clothes were ripping, exposing his huge, hairy muscles. Jeff felt himself getting stronger and more powerful. His family pretends to not admit that Jeff were naked, when he blinked he noted that everyone were naked. He ate and ate and ate. He kept eating until there was nothing left on the table. Then, he licked the last bits of food off his plate. &quot;That was delicious,&quot; Jeff said. The four giants laughed. Jeff tried to stand up, but his cock was too big so he rolled the table. <br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; Jeff said.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s ok, son, we know how big you are,&quot; Derek said.<br />
Jeff went into the living room and sat down on the couch. He turned on the TV and started watching some muscle movie. He was feeling hungry again. His stomach growled loudly. He stood up and went into the kitchen.<br />
&quot;What are you doing, son?&quot; Chris asked.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m hungry,&quot; Jeff said.<br />
&quot;Do you want some more food?&quot; Chris asked.<br />
&quot;Can you make me a shake. 5 portions.&quot; Jeff said.<br />
&quot;Sure, son,&quot; Chris said.<br />
The giant turned to the fridge and pulled out the ingredients for Jeff&#39;s shake. He put them into the blender, and pressed a button. The blender roared to life, and the mixture was blended together.<br />
&quot;Here you go, son,&quot; Chris said.<br />
&quot;Thanks, Dad,&quot; Jeff said.<br />
The musclebound giant began to drink the shake. He felt that something is touching the chick of his ass. It was David&#39;s cock.<br />
David asked Jeff didn&#39;t he want to have a walk to the woods. Jeff answered that it is a good idea, but first he needs to finish his shake. David waited a few minutes and they made a way. &quot;let&#39;s go to the Murabar tree&quot; he said.<br />
&quot;The Murabar?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
&quot;You will see&quot; David answered.<br />
They went from the spruce forest. Jeff and David had to choose the path wisely, because Jeff was too big to squisse between trees. It was old forest, trees were high and thick. Long and after they approach the titan of the trees: the Murabar tree. Murabar was the tallest and hugest ancestor. <br />
Jeff said &quot;I remember this tree. I even has the marks of my growth there&quot; He pointed to the marks far from David&#39;s head.<br />
Jeff was feeling a bit weird. His body started to grow, and he was getting taller and bigger. His cock was throbbing and his balls were swelling. In a few minutes his father were smaller than his thigh. Than Jeff was feeling a pain in his cock, it was too big and hit the tree nearby.<br />
&quot;Ouch!&quot; Jeff said.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re getting so big,&quot; David said.<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Jeff said. He was feeling horny. His cock was getting bigger and harder. Jeff tried to do a blowjob, but his chest was too big. &quot;Dad, I need your help&quot; he said.<br />
&quot;Of course, son,&quot; David said.<br />
The musclebound giant knelt down, and his father helped tried to use both his hands.<br />
&quot;You are so big, son,&quot; David said. &quot;I&#39;m afraid I need to call others&quot; He phoned Chris and Derek and asked them to come over.<br />
&quot;Jeff, let&#39;s sit on the ground and wait for them&quot; David suggested.<br />
Jeff sat on the ground, and it&#39;s shaked. David&#39;s body jumped. After a 30 minutes the rest of the family appeared.  &quot;Jeff, you&#39;re so big,&quot; Chris said.<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Jeff said. He was feeling horny, his cock was throbbing and his balls were swelling. The musclebound giant looked at his father and asked him when they would give him a blowjob. Six hands lay on Jeffs cock <br />
&quot;We will, son, we will,&quot; Chris said.<br />
With all of their combined strength, the giants managed to wrap their hands around Jeff&#39;s cock and began to stroke him. They stroked him faster and faster. The musclebound titan groaned in pleasure, his huge chest heaving and his huge arms flexing.<br />
&quot;You are so big, son,&quot; Derek said.<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Jeff said. His body continued to grow, his muscles swelling and his cock getting bigger. His family was still trying to give him a handjob, but the more they stroked the more the size of his cock increased. Soon, they could not reach the end of his shaft.<br />
Jeff wanted to be the biggest. He was 21 feet and 3000 lbs and he was not satisfied. His family couldn&#39;t stop their strokes, their hands were stuck to the rock hard cock of their son and grandson. Jeff was enjoying this feeling and wanted more.  His body was growing, and his muscles were getting bigger. Soon, he was 25 feet and 4000 lbs, and still growing. With loud bass groaning he came. The first jet of cum flew like a missile and destroyed the Murabar tree. Another one went even farther.<br />
Jeff stood up in his whole 30&#39;8 and 5000lbs. He felt that the world is perfect now. There is the one who could be his equal. <br />
&quot;Now I fell that I&#39;m ready for the compition&quot; he said.</p>
