<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff sat back and waited for the changes to start.  He did set it to a random change and that he would be mentally changed into the person he would be for this new life.  Along with altering his reality about him to fit this life of his and having it permanent.  He couldn’t wait to see what he would turn into.  Doesn’t matter if it’s a man or woman, gay or straight, young or old, child or adult.  As long as he’s happy with this life, he would cherish it forever.  As he was wondering about it, he could feel the body beginning to tingle and knew that the changes have actually started.<br />
<br />
As he waited to see what happened, he placed his hand on the table to tap his fingers, only to self something wet underneath it.  Curious, he lifted his hand up to see what he was feeling.  What he saw is a brown like liquid that was dripping down his hand, the exact same color as his desk.  Looking down, he could see that his table is somewhat melting as the bottom was dripping down on the floor.  “Wha…” Jeff said as he was confused by this strange site.  But then, he felt something drip on his shoulder and looked to his side to see something white and was coming down his sleeve.  He looked up to see the ceiling was dripping droplets of white paint while the light fixture was drooping a little bit.  Almost realizing it, he got off his chair and looked around his room, only to see what same result.  Around his room, everything was melting from his bed, TV, dresser, computer, his clothes, his books, even his chair that he sat on.  It was almost like the room was entirely made of ice cream.  He could even feel his clothes getting wet too and he looked down to see his own clothing melting off of his body and was halfway of being naked.  He then wonder if everything else is melting.  Rushing to his nearly melting window, his fears were confirmed.  Houses, cars, trees, lampposts, even the clouds and sun, were melting away and was looking like a Picasso painting.  Even the people walking about were very unrecognizable as they were slowly melting to the floor, yet they’re acting as if it’s natural to them.  Jeff looked to all of this and said out loud, “What the hell.  Why is everything melting away but me?  This doesn’t make any sense.”<br />
<br />
As he was thinking about it, he could feel some unknown force lifting him up in the air, almost like he was levitating while what’s left of his clothes dripped off his body and left him completely naked.  Jeff was caught by surprise and didn’t have a clue what is happening this time.  Just as he was thinking about his room and the world around him was nearly done with melting to nothing.  The multiple colors of goo then started to swirl around him like a colorful tornado with no end from top to bottom as Jeff was in the middle of it.  Jeff looked on and was amazed by what is happening around him.  He felt like he was weightless in the air while the colors spins around him.  Yet he still has no clue what is going on or why would all of this has to do with giving him the New Life the Chronivac promised.  Just as he was thinking about it, he started to feel a little tired, almost like something is putting him in a trance.  He tried his best to stay awake to see what’s going on, but his body wouldn’t respond, as his eyelids were getting heavy.  Almost immediately, he gave up the fight as his eyes closed, putting him in a deep sleep.  Soon Jeff was sleeping, floating in the cyclone of colors.  He didn’t even know that the Chronivac was doing what he wanted him to do.  Giving him a random new life with a physical and mental change while altering reality.  But this was a little different then what he imagined.  The program was changing him and the world around him differently.  Once the world begins the alteration, his body quivered as the physical changes took place, but in a different approach.<br />
<br />
First thing that happened was that that all the hair on his body shrank into his skin.  The top of his hair shrank to the point it was completely bald and the little body hair sank right into his skin.  Even the hair on his penis uncurled and disappeared in his skin.  Now he was completely hairless from head to toe and was devoid of any blemishes what so ever.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s head started to tingle as the change continue from there.  One by one, features one his face started to disappear on him.  His ears was the first to go as they shrank and grew less defined until they were flat as the holes sealed up completely, leaving him with nothing to hear.  His nose started to shrink and absorbed into his skin as the holes in them close off, making it impossible to breath.  His eyes, which are closed during the changes, were merging into the skin and the lids zipped up like a zipper, meaning that he won’t open them forever.  Now his head was completely featureless except for the mouth, where a different change is taking place.  His lips started to fade and flatten as his mouth opened on it’s own accord.  In his mouth, all of his teeth shrank into his gums as the gums themselves soften.  His tongue thinned and shapen into a cylinder with a little hole in the top, looking almost like a cloitus.  The mouth then closed but it was more of a vertical then a horizontal, making it looked more of a woman’s vagina.  The featureless head started to shrink and meld, as the neck grew smaller until he has no neck at all.  The Adam’s apple he had split in two and shrank away as it started to produce eggs, turning into a pair of ovaries.  As the head merged with the top part of the body, it disappeared completely and in its place was a pussy on Jeff’s body, almost looking headless.<br />
<br />
Once Jeff’s head was just a vagina, his arms started to tingle and they were the next to transform.  They started to lift up on their own and stretched high in the air as his hands bended to a strange position.  When that happened, his hands started to crack as the bone begin to alter.  One at a time, each of his fingers grew shorter and stubbier, making it impossible to flex.  It almost looked like little toes and red nail polish appeared on each nail.  His palms grew rough on the bottom and the top part grew boated and dainty, turning his hands into a pair of female feet.  His arms grew and muscles alter into something shapelier, while bones shifted and altered to fit into a one-bend direction.  Now his arms and legs turned into a pair of long and elegant female legs.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s chest started to change next as his heart was beating really fast.  The teenage pecs flattened to a washboard and his nipples drew closer together until they merged in the middle.  Once it formed into one nipple, it started to deepen and went inside, looking like a belly button.  The sides started to compress and formed into a curvy hourglass as the bones alter to make a fitting change.  At the top of his back, a crack appeared in the middle and went down to the middle as muscles grew where the shoulder blades disappeared to, looking completely bubbly.  It rounded and shaped into a heart shape appearance and improved on the curvy hips he was developing.  In the course of a minutes, Jeff’s chest and back turned into sexy hourglass shaped flat stomach and a round and bootylicious ass and his body looked freaky with half the bottom a male and half the bottom of is that of a woman.<br />
<br />
That of course soon changed as Jeff’s stomach and back gurgled and started to change next.  When he was starting high school, Jeff was working out a little bit as it showed a little ab work on the stomach.  Now thanks to the Chronivac, the abs that started to show soon vanished and there was no beginning definition what so ever.  His navel did the exact opposite of the female version as it filled in and grew pointed, creating a new nipple.  That said nipple split in two and separated, spreading to the spots where the chest would be.  As that finished, Jeff’s balls started to wiggle for a bit until they migrated downwards to his chest and grew into melons.  The ball sack softened and merged into muscles as his sperm liquefied and turned to milk.  Meanwhile, Jeff’s butt cheeks started to close and zip up completely as the fat of that migrated to his newly created chest, expanding his boobs more and making the auroras bigger.  In his body, organs started to arrange and change into the opposite directions, as the heart turns into stomach, lungs to kidneys, and vice versa.  Now his stomach and ass were no more.  In it’s place were a pair of female breasts that expanded between the CC and D cup, bouncy and sultry.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s legs were next to go as they begin to tingle and shifted.  Bones cracked and muscles ache as they started to bend to the point where legs can be bend.  Soon enough, it was to the sides of the body and started to gain some womanly tone.  His feet started to ache as they grew small, dainty, and flatten to look like palms of the hands.  His toes grew and extended, some are smaller and some are longer.  The tow nails extended and grew a couple of inches as red nail polish coated each of them.  In seconds, Jeff’s legs and feet turned into womanly and smooth arms and feminine hands.  Now in the vortex of colors floats a female body with a penis on the top.  Of course that was short lived as Jeff’s dick trembled began to change.<br />
<br />
His shaft started to get excited and went stiff by itself, yet he no longer as the balls to produce sperm since they turned to boobies.  As it got erected, it soon expanded, as the mushroom tip grew wide.  As it was growing and expanding, the top part bended to look like the tip was looking to the front.  The top then grew and shifted to look like a human like head.  Features soon appeared as ears grew to the side of the head, a nose grew in the middle, and two spots appeared and eyelids were visible.  The little opening what was the tip of the penis grew wide and opened its hole, revealing the changes in the mouth.  Part of the inner skin hardens to gums as pearly white teeth grew out of it.  A little appendage grew in the mouth and expanded into a human tongue.  The tip widens more and went horizontal, closing into a human mouth.  The skin around the mouth grew and plumped to become lips as red lipstick adorned the lips of the face.  Makeup was then applied to the face completely with eyeliner, blush, and other product to increase that beauty.  An itching then came to the head’s scalp as little hairs grew out of it.  Those hairs continued to grow as it went down the nearly created head, to the shoulder, and reach the middle of the back.  It then it then restyled itself into a fancy cut, looking now like raven black hair with a bang coming down one side.  In a matter of minutes Jeff changed from top to bottom into a naked and voluptuous woman at thirty years of age.<br />
<br />
As the physical changes finished, the colored vortex expanded and a few splatters came out of it and headed to the naked woman.  Two of them connect to her breasts and hips and wrapped around him, hardening and turning into lace.  They were turned into a black strapless bra and thin G-string panties.  Another black like paint came down to her body and engulfed her partly.  The very color hardened into a fabric and was made completely out of silk as the bottom part extended to cover only one leg.  It now started to look like a fancy, yet expansive dress that shows off her ample cleavage.  Two black splotches then came out and wrapped around her arms and hands, solidifying and turning into a silky like texture.  Those two were turned into long black gloves that go all the way up to her upper arms near her pits.  Another two came out of the expanding cyclone and wrapped around her feet, hardening and growing a three-inch cork at the bottom back.  This woman was now wearing a pair of black 3-inch heel shows that looked elegant and shiny.  A few smaller splotches and flew around her and landed around her neck and ears, hardening, forming little objects and was all shiny.  Soon enough, she was adorning a fancy necklace with studded jewels and golden earrings with black rubies dangling her ears, all of which looks super expensive.  This woman that was once Jeff, now had on the richest of dresses that all women would be jealous about.<br />
<br />
The cyclone continued to expand as some colors merged while others disappear.  Everything hardened as wet columns rose and connected to the ceiling like structure that expanded to a couple of domes while the paint like substance dripped down to the middle of the ceiling and hang there for a while.  The ground hardened to turn to marble floors as the woman levitated downward and landed on her high heels.  She opened her eyes for the first time and showed those green and shiny irises.  She slowly started to walk in a sauntering way with her hips gyrating and boobs bouncing in every step.  As she was walking, the world around her hardened as columns rose high to the sky as diamonds appeared and hardened with lights glistening the are while walls were decorated with paintings and tapestry, making it combination of a ballroom and a museum wing.  There were then puddles of multi color goo around her as they grew and take shape, half of them males, half of them females.  The moment they took form, there turned into living and breathing people that were dressed in multiple garments and were sophisticated.  A waiter emerged from one of the puddles and offered her a glass of wine.  She took one of the glasses and started to drink it, not knowing that it was part of the puddle, yet it tasted good to her.  Walking up the steps that were formed, she reached the top to look at the view.  There was a swirl of colors on the outside as they were reshaping and altering, growing into buildings and the night sky.  Just then, something big grew from the back and turned into a tower like triangle shape with metal stilts.  Looking onward is the Eiffel Tower as she was now in Paris France with fireworks exploding in the sky.<br />
<br />
In just about half an hour, Jeff was no more as he disappeared out of existence.  Now in his place is a rich and voluptuous woman that owns a privately owned oil corporation that was passed down to her family for generations.  Her knowledge of finance, trade, and problem solving helped her company rise to greatness.  And with her mature and beautiful body, it gets every stockholder attention and makes her the main focus of her industry.  Yet of all that she had accomplished, there was one thing that she was missing in all her life, family.  She wanted to continue the generation to keep her family’s company thrives and with her being single, it was a difficult road to get through.  Sure there were a lot of guys that wanted to become the groom for this lovely lady, formerly a teenage boy.  But they want her just for her money or body.  She wanted a man the looked at her at whom she really is; a lovely woman with wants to have a family to raise.<br />
<br />
As she was thinking about it, a puddle of multi colored goo was next to her as it started to grow when she thought of it.  It grew up to her height and took shape, giving out a male appearance with a fancy looking suit.  The newly created male looked to the woman and said, “Why hello and dear lady.  Aren’t you quite a beautiful girl?  Did you come here alone?”<br />
<br />
The woman turned to him and said in a lush and sultry tone, “Sadly, yes.  A woman of my caliber should be with someone of the opposite gender.  Such a shame that I don’t have one at the moment.”<br />
<br />
“So I could see…” the man said as he made an introduction, “The name is Jason.  I sort of an… entrepreneur.  Yours?”<br />
<br />
The woman looked to the man named Jason and has a bit of intrigued to him.  He was looking at her as not a rich person, but as a woman that needs a family.  With a quick smirk to her lips, she said in a introductory form, “Victoria.  You can call me Victoria.”</p>
