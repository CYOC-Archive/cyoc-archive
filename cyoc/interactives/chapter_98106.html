<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The battle between the three was an epic one for most people, but anyone can tell it was also a one-sided battle. Tabra/Janice began slashing at one of the Tammia, but the other clone would then fire a spell of fireball to blast her away. When Tabra try to back away, the two get her on both sides and dish some damage, as they giggle in enjoyment. Even when Tabra was an inch close to attack Tammia, the other appears right behind her and kick her hard t the wall. Tabra try bring herself up to stand and fight, but the injuring&#39;s and bruises she was getting was easily seen all over her body, even on her wings.<br />
<br />
The twin Tammia&#39;s stood together without even showing any sign of damage on their bodies, as they continue to laugh at the already weaken Tabra/Janice. &quot;Oh, you don&#39;t look like you are doing  so well with this game of ours. Why not just give up. It so much easier that way. The twin once more spoke in union as they charge right at Tabra at full speed. Tabra attempt to dodge, but because of the her body screaming with pain, she was unable to do it in time, as the twin both kicks her hard in the torso and send her flying to the opposite wall.<br />
<br />
Tabra was down on the ground, her body no longer even listening to her command. &quot;Tabra, you can&#39;t beat them on your own! There must be something else we can do?&quot; Janice scream to Tabra, but she hardly had the strength to speak at all. &quot;At this rate, were going to die! There must be...&quot; And just then an answer soon came to her, but it was both a dangerous and risking move. She would lose her own self identity if she does it, but looking at the situation, there was no other chose. The twin were moving closer to the unconscious body of Tabra with a sly grins on their face.<br />
<br />
&quot;well this was a rather boring fight, but thankfully we can now spend our time with our lord when this is over soon. Thank you my old friend for giving both your body and life to make me this form, but now it time we say our farewell.&quot; As both Tammia&#39;s began to charge a magical spell, Janice try reaching her voice to Tabra unconscious mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, no matter how you see it, we are left with no choice but to truly become one. I wanted to returning being my old male self again, but if it would take to bring down Tammia&#39;s and save everyone, I would risk anything just for that. I&#39;m sorry what I&#39;m about to do, but you must win this fight for everyone. When this is over, can you tell everyone that I will always love them. Farewell.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the two unleash a giant ball of fire, for a brief moment Tabra body began to glow white, which made Tammia&#39;s nervous just a mere moments. Having no clue what was that, Tammia&#39;s rush their spell and fire the incomplete fire ball to destroy the body, unleash an explosion of fire all around the room. As the smoke began to dissolve away, the twin grin at the thought of their victory, but that lasted shorty as the body had completely disappear to their shock. The twin look around to find where it go, but in that instant a barrage of slash attacks began hitting the Tammia Clone, as it was send upper ward to the sky before being force down by a mysterious figure, sending the Tammia clone crashing down to the ground. <br />
<br />
The Tammia clone try to get back up, moving her head upper ward to see Tabra standing right before her, but now had glowing white hair and eyes, while her wings had grow double in size and had another pair of wings on her back. The Tammia Clone attempt a fire blast at the angel, but Tabra was much faster than her and began her counter attack, unleashing a beam of pure light that cover the clone in it. Few seconds soon pass till the beam stop and where was once the clone now was Alexandra, return back to her old self again, as the original Tammia was in complete horror, never to see Tabra this powerful before and had easily beaten her clone who had the exactly same power level.<br />
<br />
The being that was Tabra pointed her holy sword at Tammia with the attempt to end this fight for good. &quot;I am neither Janice or Tabra; I am a being born by their desire to end this chaos. I will free the curse that inflicted you and all inside this castle and rain judgment on the one responsible for this.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tammia was now being overpower by this new being stand before her, she can&#39;t beat it yet she can&#39;t leave her master to be punish. Her sole purpose was to serve and protect her master, which met that she must break the one thing that was restricted her from doing what her master didn&#39;t want to do. She carefully concentrate that spell that was restricting in her mind and with ease broke it, as she move carefully to her weaken master.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lord Karther, are you alright?&quot; Her voice awaken Karther his sleep and turn his head slowly to her.&quot; Ah, my queen, you have come back to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes my lord, but we are in a dire situation. My life was to serve and protect, and so it is why that what I am about to do is for your protection and care.&quot; Karther was concern of the way Tammia had said that, but before he could say anything else, Tammia whole body began to glow blue as she began to grow smaller it she was now a ball of blue light that enter through Karther body. <br />
<br />
Karther was shock at what just happen, but for a moment he began to feel his powers return back to him...in fact he was feeling more power than he can ever imagine. But as he felt the pleasure of the power flowing in his body, he was unaware that his body had quickly grew three time to the size of a giant statue, his clothing now being complete destroy as a result. The power just kept flowing and this time Karther was having a hard time even stopping the changes happening in his body, as multiple tails sprouted out from his body, as well as his body losing any form or traces of masculine. As his hip and ass grew out, his waist went narrow and two mold of breast sprouted from his chest, his face and body began to take the appearance of Tammia, but now with long raven hair and silver eyes that could scare the living to death. Anything that was Karther slowly being assimilate to the foreign soul that was within the body, and a familiar giggle could be heard coming out of &quot;her&quot; mouth as she make a sexy pose with her right hand on her hip. Now stand before the angel was a giant-size Tamther who now have up to nine tails, which made here even more powerful than she was ever before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, it feel so good to merge with another being, especially with my master. Now me and my master are as one, and not even you could match to our combine strength.&quot; Tamther body begin to have a giant glow golden aura surrounding her body, but the angel was not going to be imitated by this new foe. &quot;I will bring justice upon you!&quot; The two beings jump toward each other, both sword and magic ready in hand. the first to strike will decided the fate of the earth.</p>
