<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As we dry each other off (sensually) and get into out clothes,<br />
And watch as my wives gleefully shake their chest to get their breasts to jiggle and bounce uncontrollably,<br />
<br />
I can&#39;t help but think as to how it all got so good.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------<br />
<br />
2 years ago, my marriage was just coming apart with my original single wife, Ellie.<br />
It just wasn&#39;t like how it began.<br />
We didn&#39;t understand each other anymore, and didn&#39;t communicate at all.<br />
<br />
We no longer shared a bed, a shower, a couch, meals, etc.<br />
Or laughs or smiles.<br />
We just shared a roof.<br />
<br />
My then-mom Nancy talked to Ellie often and became good friends with her, but despite her efforts and advice, our marriage still remained in shambles.<br />
It was still in better shape than what it had been a year before that - we couldn&#39;t stand each other then.  Always yelling and fighting.<br />
Thankfully, we made it slightly better.<br />
<br />
On the day the Fusion Wave royally fucked over the entire world, I was at my office, while Ellie was at home for the day, sick.<br />
<br />
That hot red flash knocked me off of my feet and drenched me in sweat, but I stayed conscious.<br />
<br />
Pulling myself to my feet, I knew, as I saw the flesh shifting on my coworkers, that I just had to get out, and get home, fast.<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t even pay attention to any of the transformations in the building - everything was going by in a blur.<br />
<br />
The only two that stood out were the transformee I slammed into coming down the stairwell - a man turning into a woman and then gaining an additional five breasts, which actually padded my fall - they popped into existence as I hit him, <br />
and an unlucky fellow who had his head attached backwards on the body of a woman.  Her head was attached to his, albeit to his crotch, and with a penis replacing her nose.<br />
They all still work at the office, actually, and have gotten quite used to their new bodies, except for Joe - its hard to live with a woman&#39;s body, but especially if your head is on backwards.  He and the woman he swapped with became a pair though.<br />
<br />
There was no way I could take a car home - the streets were clogged and frozen with disordered traffic.<br />
I figured that I could run home - I&#39;d done it before, it would only take 45 minutes.<br />
<br />
<br />
And those were about the strangest 45 minutes of my life.<br />
<br />
An easily 70-foot tall giantess was curled in a fetal position, sobbing, doing her best to cover her privates as she leaned against a building, afraid to touch and crush anybody.  <br />
Her sobbing was as loud as a jet plane, and large tears were streaming down her face and legs and smashing into the asphalt.<br />
She looked just like an upscaled human female save for her lack of arms and the presence of four legs instead, two behind her original pair, complete with a butt and everything.  <br />
It certainly would make walking without killing anybody a challenge.<br />
<br />
I slowed down to stop and take a look at a woman whose feet enlarged to an almost cartoonish size.  The same then happened with her hands, which then turned into feet, the same sizes as her lower pair.<br />
Forced to walk on all fours due to the weight, the woman groaned as her neck shot outwards as curled up, becoming veiny and darkening in the process.<br />
Her breasts swelled, wrinkled and turned into hairy scrotums as her facial features stretched on her reddening face.<br />
Her mouth stretched vertically into a urethra as her eyes were pressed to the sides of the head of a penis her head had morphed into, before melting away.<br />
I almost stepped in to aid the panicked blind, deaf, and likely suffocating mutant before a loud gurgling sounded and her asscheeks engorged, ripping her pants and unveiling themselves as new breasts.<br />
Two eyes popped into existence above her puckered anus before it transformed into a mouth.  As a nose and eyebrows were added, the face rose from between the asscheeks/breasts and became a full-on head, which began gasping in shock.<br />
An audible fart sounded from an anus that appeared between the woman&#39;s shoulder blades.<br />
Sweaty and nervous, she looked at me.<br />
I gave her a thumbs up, to which she confusedly nodded to as I continued my trip home.<br />
<br />
A pair of transformed joggers asked me for directions - minus her arms, one of the jogger&#39;s upper torso (breasts, up to the head) had swapped places with her fellow jogger&#39;s head and neck, now situated on her original stomach and legs, with her original arms attached to  the hips, like an unorthodox SWB.<br />
The breastless transformed jogger had an originally black body, while her partner was white, making the sharp contrast in skin tone something interesting to behold.<br />
I did my best not to look at the upper-torso-transplanted jogger&#39;s breasts.  She still had a sports bra on, but they were quite prominent.<br />
<br />
Shortly before I arrived at the street I lived on, I narrowly dodged a shot of cum from a trio of young women sharing a penis.<br />
They all apologized before cumming again, the gunk splashing against a tree as they moaned.<br />
They were all teenagers, two Latina and one Asian, not transformed or conjoined in any way save for the massive dog penis somehow attached to all of their crotches.  It was hard, quite red, a couple of feet long, and about as girthy as a jar of pickles.<br />
It was ringed by a great mat of black fur.<br />
Below it was a large pair of furry testicles, each about the size of a basketball.  It was droopy, and the girls were struggling to keep it from dragging on the ground.<br />
Between the testicles sat 3 vaginas, vertically arranged.<br />
I offered to help them before they screamed at me to get away from them and, moaning, cummed again into a picket fence, some cum seeping through the cracks and drenching the wall of the house.<br />
<br />
I heeded their advice and ran.<br />
<br />
<br />
When I had finally arrived home, I was greeted by Ellie and my mom Nancy, who had made a surprise visit that day.<br />
<br />
Neither of the ladies, at that time, were transformed.<br />
<br />
We prepped and ate dinner together, and afterwards, sat, side by side, on our couch and watched the news for a few hours.<br />
For the first time in a long time, Ellie and I cuddled together, to my then-mother&#39;s great smiling approval.<br />
That made most of the chaos melt away.<br />
<br />
I woke up at 2:31 A.M. to screams in the kitchen.  I would later learn that, unable to sleep, Ellie exited her bedroom to get a glass of water, and met Nancy, who had awoken to relieve herself.<br />
<br />
I rushed out of bed and saw the whole thing.<br />
<br />
They were flailing on the ground, Nancy&#39;s right arm stuck to Ellie&#39;s left one.<br />
Attempting to pull apart didn&#39;t help, the space between them closed as their shoulders eventually made contact as the sides of their bodies pressed against each other tightly as they were yelling.<br />
<br />
I froze, unable to move as they yelled for help.  What could I do?<br />
What if I fused with them?<br />
<br />
And then their clothes burst, as they practically &quot;flowed into each other&quot;.<br />
<br />
Nancy exclaimed as her flesh began to ripple and smoothen out.  It was as if someone had spilled a bucket of paint that was the texture and consistency of Ellie&#39;s skin all over her.  It spread, first across the torso, then up to her head, to the left down her arm, and south, towards her feet.<br />
Her Breasts inflated, and her lips filled into a beautiful pucker that became just at home on her now young face as it became full once again, wrinkles vanishing.  Her asscheeks and legs became supple as visible veins under her skin disappeared from view.  All the while, her hair had turned from greying into brown.<br />
With many unnatural cracks and moans from Nancy, after a quick 20 seconds, she had, without a doubt, de-aged to look the same age as Ellie, her back and joints having straightened out as she gained back height to match Ellie&#39;s.<br />
<br />
And then<br />
Ellie&#39;s left leg and Nancy&#39;s right pressed together and fused before it shrank and melted away.<br />
Their breasts squeezed in an increasingly tight row of four before they all merged into the perfect pillows they share today.<br />
And any extra space on their torsos mashed together.<br />
<br />
They came to in the morning, and it took a while for them to calm down.<br />
Nancy was overjoyed at her new youthful appearance.<br />
<br />
I helped them function for a week before they finally got a hang of coordinating their shared body.<br />
<br />
A month in and they had become essentially sisters.<br />
And my relationship with Ellie had been steadily improving, thanks to Nancy&#39;s constant gentle coaching.<br />
<br />
Two months in and Ellie and I were warm again.<br />
And it was then that I noticed something new and strange flickering in my mom&#39;s eyes.<br />
It revealed itself through barely noticeable flushes and the occasional crossed legs.<br />
<br />
We kicked it off 6 months after the Wave.<br />
We couldn&#39;t deny anything anymore.<br />
The feelings were burning so bright now.<br />
<br />
. . .<br />
<br />
And its been great since!</p>
