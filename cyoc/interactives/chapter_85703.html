<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“A female Blood Elf?” he asked in confusion, and then excitement, “I’m going to be a female Blood Elf?  Super cool!”<br />
<br />
Just as he said that, the computer and the desk vanished completely and his clothes followed suit, leaving him completely naked.  Jeff immediately covered himself, feeling embarrassed in front of all of these people.  Yet for some strange reasons, they didn’t notice him yet as they go about their business.  To his guess, Jeff hasn’t fully changed yet and has to wait until the villagers notice him.  So he remained where he was until the changes actually start.  Just then, Jeff could feel the tingle in his body, as he knew that the changes are actually starting.<br />
<br />
Looking down to himself, Jeff watched first hand as the transformation started on his skin.  All the small hairs and blemishes dotting across his body faded away completely as the surface and smooth and silky.  He then looked to his hands and notice that they was getting small and slender with his fingers thinning and his nails lengthening.  Same thing happened with his feet, as they grew small and dainty.  He could even feel his body shifting as he grew a little taller and gained some muscles there were both feminine and strong.  He could feel his body shifting some more to become more female then male.  His hips expanded while his stomach curved in the middle, to give him a sexy hourglass figure.  His rear followed suit and as it expanded to match his gyrating hips.  He could feel his plumbing change as well as his penis shrank into a new opening and his balls went in next, turning into ovaries.  Jeff feels his new vagina and felt a little turned on.  It was obvious that he wasn’t a he anymore, more like a she from here on out.  Jeff also feels a tingling in her chest and look down to see mounds growing out of it.  Those mounds soon grew into breasts as they upgraded from A cups, to Bs, all the way to round and melon shaped Cs.  Jeff rubbed her new assets and gave them quite a squeeze.  With a slight blush in her face, Jeff never really knew what real breasts felt like until now.  Looking down at her body, Jeff could tell that she is now a woman from the neck down.  Meaning that her changes were almost finished.<br />
<br />
Feeling the tingling sensation on her face, Jeff found a bucket of water and used the reflection to see the rest of the changes.  What she saw was truly beautiful.  Her face was molded into a slender oval shape with no pimples or stubble what so ever.  Her nose grew long and thin while her lips puffed up and looked kissable for any man.  But as the changes were that of a woman, other changes took place that were different.  For one, her hers grew pointed at the top and extended to the back of her head.  Then her eyebrows grew incredibly long that they stick out of her face.  Then her eyes did a huge change as they glowed a green hue until it covered her eyes completely, with no pupils to look at.  Yet for some strange reason, Jeff could see everything, but it’s much more clearer then her normal sight.  Her hair grew long and straight as it went down to the lower end of her back.  The brown color on both her hair and eyebrows changed color and darken into a purple hue, a very elegant color nonetheless.  Looking at herself, Jeff has turned into a beautiful and sexy blood elf, with nothing that resembled the old Jeff.<br />
<br />
Jeff continued to stare at herself and notice that she was still a little naked, giving that she lacked the clothes.  As she was thinking about that, clothes suddenly appear and looked like she was ready for combat.  She was wearing a dark red body suit with no sleeves and black armor in separate places.  She had a chest piece over her breasts, armored plating on her legs, metallic boots, spiked shoulder pads, and gauntlet gloves, all of which are coated in coal black.  Her back then felt heavy as a sword and shield appeared on her back, making her warrior class.  She looked back and forth as her armor and Jeff liked her appearance.<br />
<br />
Just as she was getting comfortable, Jeff felt a minor migraine and rubbed the temples of her head.  What actually was happening was that her old memories were being arranged as new memories were and knowledge was inputted to her head.  She remembers being born as a blood elf, destined to be a warrior, the training, the adventures, the victories, and the tragedies.  She even remembers that she was no longer Jeff anymore.  Instead, her name is Jada, the elvish name for wise.  As the changes were finished, Jada looked to herself and was astonished by her appearance.  “Hmm…  Not bad for a Blood Elf.” She said as she rubbed her throat, hearing her new and very feminine voice for the first time.  Taking a nice stretch, Jada was ready to take on this new world and the many adventures that await her.  What is the first thing Jada did.</p>
