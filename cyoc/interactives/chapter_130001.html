<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gloria rubbed her chin thoughtfully as she looked at Claudia. “Would it be possible to do both,” she asked. Claudia smirked as she looked at the young teen. “I like the way you think,” she said. Gloria now smiled as she looked at Claudia.<br />
<br />
“So if we’re going to watch the two of them how are we going to do it with out being see?”<br />
<br />
Claudia smiled as she touched her necklace. “Let’s head over to the mirror and I’ll show you.” Gloria nodded obediently as the two made they way to her vanity mirror. As the two now stared at their reflections Claudia touched the necklace lightly. “Just watch,” she said pointing to the mirror. Gloria did as she was told watching her reflection. As she did her jaw slowly fell open.<br />
<br />
Gloria and Claudia’s reflections seemed to be growing fainter, almost transparent. At first it looked as if they appearances seemed muted like they were in poor lighting. As Gloria continued to watch she could see her appearance becoming more and more transparent. In only a few seconds Claudia and Gloria’s reflections vanished from the mirror. “What happened to our reflections,” Gloria gasped.<br />
<br />
Claudia turned to the girl with a wide grin. “We’re invisible now,” she smirked. Gloria looked at her now in confusion noticing that from her perspective she and Claudia seemed unchanged. “If we’re invisible how come I can still see you?”<br />
<br />
“The magic I used makes us invisible to everyone else,” Claudia said. “It’s kind of an illusion, we can still see eachother but no one else can if they don’t have the necklace or are aware of the spell.”<br />
<br />
Gloria nodded her head still in bewilderment that she was now invisible. “Okay so no one can see us,” she said. “So where should we go first?”<br />
<br />
“Chances are my parents are having dinner now,” Claudia said. “I say we peak on them first before we go check out yur parents.sound like a plan?” Gloria nodded in agreement. “Okay,” Claudia smiled pulling Gloria close. “Now hold on I’m going to take us to my parents house.” Gloria reached out grasping Claudia’s hand as the coed now touched her necklace. In a flash Gloria felt themselves being whisked away.<br />
<br />
The trip, while brief, was interesting. Gloria felt as if she was being pulled quickly towards something. The only feeling she could relate it to was the slingshot ride she once rode at the amusement park. Gloria’s body seemed to jerk forward quickly as she felt wind rush past her face. The feeling was momentary as the two arrived in Claudia’s front yard, Gloria swooned slightly as she now tried to get her bearings. “Whoa that was weird,” Gloria muttered, raising her hand to her head. “Yeah I’m still not used to it either,” Claudia mentioned shaking her head. Collecting themselves the two now gazed at Claudia’s house.<br />
<br />
It appeared that the Harris family was having an impromptu family reunion as Claudia noticed not only Derricks car but Cole and Julia’s as well. As the two now peered in the window they could see Tom and Marjorie Harris happily talking with their children as well as their daughter in law Kumiko. Tom Harris, as he so often did now, held his grandson in his arms. The giant of a man made funny faces trying to get his chubby infant of a grandson to laugh.<br />
<br />
“Wish we could hear what they were saying,” Gloria frowned as she watched the happy family. Claudia smiled down at her before touching her necklace. All at once Gloria could hear what was being said inside as if she were standing right next to them. Gloria gaped up at her sisters friend as she laughed. “Another little trick I picked up,” she laughed. “Super helpful when I’m in one of those huge lecture halls and the professor is too quiet.” Gloria smiled as the two now watched the Harris family.<br />
<br />
“Cmon dad hand the boy over,” Cole grinned as he approached his father. Tom smiled as he looked at his eldest son. “Cole I got him relax,” he smiled. “Besides Tommy here is having fun with his grandpa. Aren’t you Tommy?” The chubby one year old chortled with laughter as Tom Harris cradled him. Cole could only shake his head and smile as he looked at his father. “Look dad glad you’re having fun but Kumi needs to feed him and I’m pretty sure mom needs your help in the kitchen.” Tom sighed happily as he now handed his grandson back to Cole. “Okay, Okay,” he sighed.<br />
<br />
Cole now cradled his son as he approached Kumiko. “Hey hon finally wrestled the boy away from his grandpa.” Kumiko smiled as she cradled her son in her arms. “Thanks sweetie,” she said. Standing on tiptoes she tenderly kissed Cole on the cheek as she now took Tommy to his high chair. Cole lovingly gazed at his wife as she now began to feed their son. Despite Kumiko having put some baby weight on her hips she was still a beautiful woman, if anything he now found her even more beautiful. Smiling her now stood behind her running his hands through her long chestnut locks.<br />
<br />
“They look so happy,” Gloria sighed happily as she looked at the married couple. “Yeah Cole has always been a big teddy bear,” Claudia said. “Still amazed how well he’s adjusted to civilian life.” The two girls now watched as Julia, Tom and Marjorie exited the kitchen with dinner. Quietly everyone took their seats and much to Gloria’s surprise Morgan now sat next to Derrick.<br />
<br />
“Wow Ms. Dean look nervous,” Gloria stated looking at her teachers. Claudia could only giggle as she watched her brother and his ex girlfriend squirm, “Yeah So is Derrick,” she smirked. “If there’s one thing I’ve learned over the years, anyone dating one of the Harris kids is always in for a rough ride.”<br />
<br />
Claudia and Gloria watched as Tom Harris now looked over Morgan Dean with a critical eye. “It’s been a long time hasn’t Morgan,” he said sternly, spooning some mashed potatoes onto his plate. Morgan nodded and smiled nervously as she looked at Tom. “Morgan and I are working at the school together,” Derrick said nervously as he looked at his father. <br />
<br />
“So she’s a sub too,” Tom grunted causing Derrick to sigh. “N..no sir I’m working full time,” Morgan said nervously. “And Derrick is one of the best subs in the district. It’s only a matter of time before he’s hired full time.”<br />
<br />
Tom grunted as he looked over his son and Morgan. “So until then he’s still a sub and still living at home,” he said. “Which reminds me Morgan dear what brings you to our home tonight. Didn’t you and Derrick break up?”<br />
<br />
“I invited her dad,” Derrick groaned as Morgan blushed crimson. “Seriously what’s with the third degree? Didn’t you scare her enough when we first started dating in high school?”<br />
<br />
Tom raised an eyebrow as he looked at his son. “So you two are dating again,” he asked narrowing his eyes. Derrick and Morgan blushed, lowering their heads under Toms intimidating gaze. “Ummm I...Uh I don’t know,” Derrick stammered as he glanced at Morgan. “We...um...really haven’t talked about...um that,” Morgan answered. “I mean I would like too but um only if Derrick wanted to.”<br />
<br />
Tom gave the two teachers a steely glance as he watched the two of them squirm. Rubbing his chin thoughtfully he looked at them. “I know my son pretty well and I can safely say he definitely wants too,” he smirked. “But I will say this Morgan you best not break his heart again. Poor kid was so depressed when you dumped him last time he spent the entire summer locked in his room listening Adele.”<br />
<br />
Morgan now tried to stifle a giggle as Derick buried his face in his arms. “Ugh dad seriously,” he groaned. Tom smiled as he watched his son. “What it’s not like I’m lying,” he chuckled. “You were head over heels for the girl. And she did make a good impression with us. You two were good for eachother, still you best run this past your mother. She was the one that was most upset by the breakup.”<br />
<br />
Morgan now looked over at the stern face of Marjorie Harris. The petite blond woman glowered at Morgan causing the auburn haired woman to squirm in her chair. “Morgan,” she said sternly. “You broke my sons heart last time. If you do that again your going to find out that I’m even scarier than Derricks father.”<br />
<br />
Morgan went pale as the Harris family now laughed. “Your in trouble now Morgan,” Julia laughed. “Mom here is even scarier than dad, especially when it comes to her kids.” <br />
<br />
Derrick smirked as he now took Morgan’s hand in his. Smiling he mouthed the words don’t worry as the family began to eat and talk.<br />
<br />
“So Ms. Dean and your brother are a couple now,” Gloria said in awe. Claudia nodded and smirked. “Guess so,” she said. “Good for Derrick but Morgan better watch it. If mom is watching them then she needs to be careful.” Gloria and Claudia giggled as they turned away from the house. “Well that was fun,” Claudia said. “So you ready to check on your parents?” Gloria nodded as she took Claudia’s hand, in a flash the two vanished from Claudia’s front yard journeying to Where Jason and Lisa were across town.</p>
