<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You just put the can of cola (that once was Keith) back into your trunk and, figuring that it was safe enough there you decide to go for a bit of a walk. You don’t bother to lock the car for two reasons; first of all, there is a muscle-bound police man sleeping on the backseat, so it was pretty safe from being stolen and second, you didn’t want to know what might happen if you used the keys on the car with the cop and Keith inside. <br />
<br />
Walking across the parking lot you try to come to terms with all that has happened in the last few hours; by some cosmic coincident you have been given the power to…change…things, but you had no control over those changes. So far this has led to you getting an awesome new car, your friend being turned into a dog, then dog shit and finally into a can of coke and some random rookie cop being turned into a hot leather hunk, who, while still a cop was a completely different individual than what he had started out as. <br />
<br />
You really needed to figure this out; how to reverse the changes…and whether you even wanted to reverse them. Sure you wanted Keith back, but you liked your new car just the way it was and…well didn’t Officer Martinez just have just as much right to exist as the rookie he was created from? Plus, he was definitely hotter than before…<br />
<br />
You look at the keys…if you could just control those things… you come across a few dumpsters at the edge of the parking lot. They are open, with trash piling out and scattered across the floor and decide to try to figure the keys out by practicing on the trash. <br />
You point the keys at an old coffee cup and press; it goes blurry and morphs into a rubber plunger, you press again and it becomes a straw hat. Then a desk lamp, a porcelain ballerina, an apple… <br />
Stopping in your attempts you sigh…this all just seemed so random…maybe there wasn’t a way to bring back Keith at all? <br />
<br />
A loud, high-pitched squeak startles you as a large, dirty rat plummets form one of the dumpsters and scurries across the ground. In a mixture of shock and disgust you point the keys at the rat and press. <br />
<br />
The rat seems to stumble over its on front legs and performs an involuntary summersault as it does so the sun suddenly starts to make its fur glisten like gold, its proportions change as it becomes even larger, its legs growing, its ears fanning out. And as the rat gets back on its feet it has ceased to be a rat and instead it has become…well it takes you a moment to recognize the animal as a fennec fox. <br />
<br />
The newly created fox wastes no time in getting yup and continuing its flight. For a moment you just look at it, but soon you realize that fennecs are not native to your region and, worried for the little thing you press the keys again, maybe you could turn it into an ordinary fox, or a coyote, something that would have an easier time surviving here. The fox stops running, freezes in place and soon the sun is not making it’s fur shine like gold anymore…because now the little fox IS composed of solid gold. You walk closer to inspect it, you pick it up…yes it is a gold figurine of a running fennec fox… <br />
<br />
“Fuck…” you mumble, feeling bad for the little thing. You figure the only way to not cause more stuff like that to happen was to just not use the keys anymore. The motorcycle cop would remain a motorcycle cop, the fox figurine would remain a figurine and…you gulp as you think of Keith… <br />
<br />
Carrying the fox back to your car you walk back to the car and what you see there makes your jar drop in horror; the cop has woken up and is currently chugging down the last drops of a can of morpho cola. THE same can of morpho cola that once was Keith! <br />
<br />
“No!” you scream. <br />
<br />
The Cop chuckles at your shock “What’s the matter kid?” he licks a bit of coke residue from his lip and then crunches the can in his big, leather gloved hand before dropping it to the ground “Getting sucked off always makes me thirsty…” <br />
As you look at the crushed can on the pavement the cop puts his mirrored sun glasses back on “Well, this was fun, but I gotta get back on patrol, see ya, kiddo!” and with this he spins around on his boot heels and starts to walk off. <br />
<br />
You, meanwhile, still stare at the can, hoping, praying, that Keith was alright you aim the keys at the can and press focusing all your mind on Keith and hoping that it will help. Your heart sinks as the can transforms into an empty pile of clothes, and not just any pile of clothes; Keith’s crocks, grubby jeans and Pink Floyd t-shirt. <br />
Dammit! That means the can was just the clothes…and the coke was Keith…the coke that was now inside the cop. You had to keep him from leaving. <br />
<br />
“Wait!” you call after him. <br />
<br />
He waves dismissively with his hand “Go home kid!” <br />
<br />
“You can’t leave!” <br />
<br />
You hear him chuckle “Don’t gimme that shit now, you’re too young for me…” <br />
<br />
He continues walking away and seemingly nothing you say can stop him, and with him he carries Keith sloshing around in his belly. You have to stop the cop before he can piss out Keith into some toilet…you look at the golden fox figurine in your hand. You have no choice… <br />
<br />
“For Keith!” You scream as you aim the keys at the cop and press. <br />
<br />
The Cop turns around to look at you just in the very moment the keys start working. However, nothing about his muscular body or black leather uniform changes, nothing at all…except his face. <br />
His facial features become blurry as a ripple goes through his dark, greying hair changing its colour to dark blond and making it somewhat thicker while keeping the slicked-back style. The facial features come back into focus and...they are not the cop’s and not those of the rookie he was created from either…instead they belong to someone far more familiar to you… <br />
<br />
“Keith?” you say, breathlessly. <br />
<br />
Keith removes the mirrored sun-glasses his wearing and grins at you “Hey buddy!” His voice has changed, sounding deeper and manlier now, even a little bit older, but it is definitely Keith’s! <br />
<br />
It takes you a while to realise that Keith has retained both the motorcycle leathers and the muscular stature from the Motorcycle cop. “Woah…you’re huge now..” <br />
<br />
Keith chuckles, in the same manner the cop had done so, as he looks down at himself, starting to flex his hands and curl his fingers inside his skintight gloves with much gusto, making the leather creak. ”So I am…” <br />
You’re in awe of this new Keith…he seems calmer than before, more confident…hotter… <br />
<br />
He then retrieves the police ID from his jacket and shows it to you “And what’s more I’m a real, bona-fide motorcycle cop…” You look at the badge and he’s right the badge now shows Keith’s picture and personal information in place of Martinez’ <br />
“So it looks like I got a new career after all,” Keith remarks as he returns the ID into his jacket. <br />
<br />
It takes a moment for that to sink in. <br />
“Wait what? You want to stay like this?” <br />
<br />
“Yeop,” Keith  marks as he puts his sunglasses back on and cocks an eyebrow “gotta problem with that?” He chuckles again, dragging his tongue over his teeth.</p>
