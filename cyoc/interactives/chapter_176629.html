<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex looked down at the table. &quot;This would pretty much be accepting there&#39;s no way home for me. I&#39;d be taking on a new life here..&quot;<br />
<br />
Pascal nodded slowly. &quot;That&#39;s true, boy. But is that really such a bad trade? I saw your life back on your world. With this deal you&#39;d be a powerful man in this world. Son and heir to one of the most influential men in the kingdom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not about power.&quot; Erick cut in, favoring Alex with a smile. &quot;I knew he was a good man the moment he put himself in harms way to save that kid. That&#39;s who my son was and someone who I would be proud to call a son.&quot;<br />
<br />
What was Alex giving up? A shitty apartment, college, his job waiting tables, an eventual dead end job working behind some desk until retirement. Sure he&#39;d miss his family, but he had few friends and no boyfriend. &quot;Alright, I&#39;ll do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erick clapped his hands together, &quot;Excellent! When shall we get started?&quot; The man was so happy, Alex felt his heart melting a little just to see such a giant of a man as giddy as a child.<br />
<br />
Pascal rubbed his belly under his loose robe and shrugged. &quot;No time like the present, I&#39;ll need to get the components from the safe in my shop. And a guard or two wouldn&#39;t hurt for the trip. It would be sour luck to lose those items just now that we have everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erick nodded and raised his voice. &quot;Maris!&quot; The door to the room opened and a young man stepped in. He was probably around Alex&#39;s age, his brown hair was cut short except for one long braid that hung from behind his ear and down his strong chest. He also had a short beard, though left long and braided at the chin. Must be some Eastland fashion Alex though giving a look to Erick&#39;s own braided beard and the few plaits in his long hair. He rubbed at his stubbled jaw thinking how he&#39;d look with one. Maris was dressed in a kilt as well, and had bits of well polished armor strapped across his arms, legs and chest. One hand rested on the sword hilt hanging from his belt and the other held a helmet at his side. He wasn&#39;t as big as Erick, but he had the confident air of someone who knew he wasn&#39;t to be messed with. &quot;Maris. I need you to accompany Pascal here to retrieve some items from his workshop. This needs to be completely secret. You will tell no one and forget you ever took this trip or had these orders once you return, clear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As crystal, my lord.&quot; Maris&#39; tone was deep and smooth. Alex felt those blue eyes pass over him for a moment, but Maris asked no questions, merely waiting for Pascal who was getting up out of his seat and heading to the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll go with them. You two should probably have some time alone before this.&quot; Marsyas said as he stood up. Erick nodded his assent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Marsyas.&quot; Erick&#39;s voice stopped the faun. &quot;Come see me in the morning, I think I have a job for you.&quot; The faun bowed and then followed Maris and Pascal out the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;I trust Maris more than any of my other knights.&quot; Erick said once they were out the door as if reading Alex&#39;s mind. &quot;He was my son&#39;s best friend, inseparable since they were boys. I even consider him a son in a way, though the law wouldn&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not use him for the spell then?&quot; Alex said, hoping it didn&#39;t sound like he was going to back out.<br />
<br />
Erick laughed. &quot;He would be noticed missing. He&#39;s also the son of one of my barons. Our families have been close for many generations, but I couldn&#39;t take their house&#39;s heir. I worry how he may react to me revealing I have another son, though. But just a little. He&#39;s loyal but he may give you a tough time until you prove yourself to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex hoped he didn&#39;t look as worried as he suddenly felt. &quot;Anything else I should know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Suppose we should get our story straight.&quot; Erick folded his hands together in front of him and looked at Alex. &quot;I&#39;m going to say you were conceived while I was away on campaign when the Orcs were invading from the north. That you grew up on a small farm here in the Southlands, and though I couldn&#39;t acknowledge you I kept tabs on you. When my own heir passed, I decided perhaps it was time to bring you home and legitimize you. Even better to say your other parent passed away, one less weak link in the story. Keep any tales of your childhood simple and straight. Better if you can avoid the topic all together. Luckily, most people are not in the habit of grilling a duke&#39;s son.<br />
<br />
Alex gulped but nodded. &quot;I will do my best... my lord.&quot; He added the title after a moment, figuring he better get used to it.<br />
<br />
Erick scoffed. &quot;You&#39;d best get used to calling me father. I&#39;m not in the habit of taking obsequiousness from my own blood. A few slips ups will sell the suddenly elevated farm boy story, but..&quot; He reached out and took Alex&#39;s hand in his much larger one. &quot;I don&#39;t just want this to be a falsehood we try to live. I hope we can come to see each other as family, even as father and son, eventually. I don&#39;t want to replace your fathers back where you came from, but, we can still be a family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll try.&quot; Alex grinned a little, amused once more at the difference in this world. Fathers.. his own father back home would have a heart attack thinking about that. &quot;Father.&quot; He added after a moment with a smile.<br />
<br />
Erick nodded and leaned back in his chair. The two sat in a somewhat awkward silence waiting for the others to get back. About half an hour later there was a knock at the door followed by Pascal, then Maris carrying a wooden chest about three two feet across and one foot high that made a surprisingly heavy thump when set on the table, and Marsyas bringing up the rear.<br />
<br />
Pascal then waved to the two men following him. &quot;Out, we need privacy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maris didn&#39;t leave until Erick gave him a nod. Marsyas instead came up to Alex. &quot;Good luck. I&#39;ll see you in a bit. Well, the new you.&quot; Then he shocked Alex by pulling him into a powerful hug, their lips meeting in a long kiss. Alex even felt a hand creep down and grope him through the fabric of his kilt. Once the kiss broke, Marsyas bowed to Erick and made his way out of the room.<br />
<br />
Alex was blushing, though Erick and Pascal looked barely phased. Erick actually laughed when he looked at Alex. &quot;Never had a faun as a friend before I assume? That&#39;s the sort of farewell you get before a long journey. If not outright sex. Been a while since I had a faun kiss me like that. Flings like that are for the young.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pascal was already setting to work. He had pulled a large stone bowl out of the chest and was pouring and sprinkling various ingredients into it, reading off a scroll spread out on the table. &quot;This is very old magic. Very powerful, very old. Both of you strip.&quot; He picked up a pestle and started grinding all the ingredients together in the bowl, chanting something over them as he did.<br />
<br />
Erick began taking off his armor, laying it aside carefully along with his kilt until he stood there completely in the buff. Alex shook his head. The man had to be pushing fifty and still looked like a bodybuilder. He&#39;d be surprised if there was even five pounds of fat anywhere on the duke. Had he been in his twenties or thirties back home, he was exactly the type Alex would have been all over. Well, Alex probably would have been fine with him even at this age. There was a scar along his pelvis, probably the injury he said made it difficult for him to have sons. And then there was the sleeping monster between his legs. Every time Alex thought he had seen the most impressive cock possible in this land he was surprised again. It was as long as his own, well as long as his was now with the additions from Bo and Roc, but looked even thicker. His balls though were large and heavy like a pair of lemons. Alex had never seen a pair like that before, then remembered that Pascal said the duke&#39;s line had minotaur blood. He&#39;d need to see a minotaur some day for comparison.<br />
<br />
&quot;Both of you.&quot; Pascal muttered, snapping Alex out of his sating trance. He quickly removed his kilt and set it aside, not even bothering to hide the fact he was already as hard as a rock.<br />
<br />
Pascal was now pouring a few things into a goblet, then held it out towards Alex. &quot;Drink this and lay on the bed.&quot; Alex looked down at the crimson liquid, then sighed and knocked it back. It tasted like sweet, spiced, wine with some sort of floral taste to it he couldn&#39;t quite identify. He thought he could feel it settling in his stomach, radiating warmth throughout his body. Then doing as Pascal ordered he went and laid down on the bed.<br />
<br />
Pascal now had the bowl in hand with a brush he was using to paint red lines on Erick&#39;s body with whatever mixture the bowl contained, all the while chanting as he worked. In some places it looked like strange geometric symbols, in others it was just lines. His cock and balls got completely painted in the red pigment. Erick stood stock still until Pascal set down the bowl and handed him another goblet to drink.<br />
<br />
&quot;The next part is up to you, and will be just between the two of you. Alex will be reborn, and as with all new births there first needs to be a coming together of two men to form the new life. Erick you will need to give your seed, and Alex will serve as the vessel.&quot; Pascal bowed to the duke and went to the door of the room, silently slipping out.<br />
<br />
Alex looked over to Erick who was striding towards him, then placing a hand on his cheek. &quot;Don&#39;t worry.&quot; Alex nodded and slowly spread his legs. He hoped this didn&#39;t make things awkward between them. They were going to be father and son and it was going to start with having sex. Though Alex guessed it wasn&#39;t incest if he wasn&#39;t actually Erick&#39;s son.. yet.<br />
<br />
Erick was gentle, he spread Alex&#39;s legs apart and pressed the head of his cock against Alex&#39;s hole. He was getting used to taking large cocks, but this was going to be different. He gasped as he felt that thick cock sliding inside of him, Erick taking it slow to make sure he was getting used to the thickness before sliding further in. But it felt strange at the same time, electrical. It was similar to the feeling of awareness he had when having sex with Marsyas, a connection. But this wasn&#39;t empathy, it was like something tethered them together now more than just a cock in his ass.<br />
<br />
As Erick trust into him the painted markings on him began to glow. They got brighter and brighter with each thrust, and Alex felt like he was touching a live wire, every hair on his body was standing on edge. Then the lines began to disappear from Erick&#39;s body, starting with the outermost designs, all of it vanishing towards his painted cock. And as they disappeared from Erick, they appeared on Alex&#39;s body. First his cock and balls turning a bright glowing crimson, from which lines and symbols began to spread out, painted by an invisible hand.  The closer he got to orgasm the faster the lines spread. With a growl he felt Erick give one last thrust into him, warmth and electricity flooding his body, causing his own cock to twitch, and orgasm. Though he shot just his own seed over his head to splatter on the stone wall, it felt like his cock should be shooting fire.<br />
<br />
The magical rush started to fade, the lines losing their glow and vanishing as they did, as if they never existed in the first place, just melting into Alex&#39;s skin. Erick pulled back and sat on a chair, breathing heavily. Alex could understand, the orgasm felt like the most powerful one he had ever had. He felt cold now that it was over.<br />
<br />
As quickly as it left, he felt heat flooding through him again, he looked down expecting to see his bones glowing under his skin. But instead he say himself stretching, reshaping. A few inches of height came with much broadened shoulders. Alex arched his back as he felt his body shifting against the bed. It didn&#39;t hurt, but it was hardly the comfortable warmth of the last time his body was remade. He could feel even his hands and feet getting larger, stretching under his skin, lengthening his muscles, a growth spurt happening in a matter of seconds.<br />
<br />
Heat passed from his bones, and into his muscles which started to bulge and pump with newfound strength. He could feel his blood rushing through his veins and arteries, feeding his rapidly swelling flesh. His already enhanced physique growing even stronger. He could almost feel the wolf magic inside him urging it on, making it even more potent. Where Erick&#39;s muscles were all heavy slabs, Alex form was different by youth. His muscles were growing huge, but still lithe, more like a powerful tiger&#39;s sleek form. He could feel the fire in his cock, thickening his already impressive member, fire swirling in his balls as they grew larger and larger, two heavy weights between his legs. <br />
<br />
He felt fire in his head. He pressed his hands against his face only to feel his features shifting under his larger fingers. His jaw growing broad and strong, his brow heavy, the same hawkish nose that Erick sported.<br />
<br />
Soon the heat was only left in his skin. The hair on his body thickened a bit more, growing denser and curlier but shifting from the dark brown it had been to a bright golden blond. Slowly the heat subsided and Alex felt bone deep cold and exhaustion but he knew it was over. He tried to sit up, but his muscle despite their new size felt weak and he instead rolled out of bed and landed on his hands and knees on the floor.<br />
<br />
He felt a strong arm wrap around his shoulders and another strong hand on his chest. &quot;Easy there, son. That looked like it took a lot out of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Son.. Right.. Alex lifted his head and looked over to meet Erick&#39;s gaze. And expression of worry turning to a bright grin, &quot;My gods.. it worked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erick helped Alex to stand, and he noticed he was now the same exact height as Erick. Erick still might have been just a little bit bigger than him, broader of chest, but it would be splitting hairs. Alex felt heavy. He couldn&#39;t explain it if he wanted to, he just felt heavier and more solid. Too bad he felt so weak, he wanted to see what this new physique could do, but instead Erick helped him to sit on the bed, then Erick pulled a chair closer, putting a hand under Alex&#39;s chin to get a look at him. &quot;Gods, you could almost be my son&#39;s twin. We&#39;ll need to grow out your hair though, get you a proper braid.&quot; <br />
<br />
Alex grinned. &quot;Don&#39;t supposed you have a mirror.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erick held up a finger and went to rummage through a chest at the foot of the bed, returning with a hand mirror. Alex regarded his new face with a bit of shock. He could see Erick in it plain as day, no one would mistake him for anything other than his son, though he could still see some of his old face peeking through. The set of his eyes, the way his lips pressed together. His eyes had even stayed brown rather than Erick&#39;s bright blue. His hair was golden blond and short, and he now sported a full beard even if it wasn&#39;t very long. He wasn&#39;t a clone, but blood relation wouldn&#39;t be in doubt to anyone with eyes. He then looked down between his legs, pleased to see that Erick&#39;s package seemed to have been passed on in full. It was going to take getting used to having those two orbs hanging down there.<br />
<br />
When Alex looked away from the mirror, Erick was at the door letting Pascal in. The wizard took one look at Alex and clapped. &quot;Excellent!&quot; The wizard came over and put his hands on either side of Alex&#39;s head. He felt a tingle rush through him, then pull away as Pascal did. &quot;He&#39;s in perfect health, and everything seems to be in working order. Let me know if you feel anything strange in the next few hours. I&#39;ve arranged to stay up here in the keep to be on hand this evening.&quot; Pascal looked Alex over again and shook his head. &quot;Remarkable. It worked better than even I had hoped. But he needs rest. You as well, my lord. I also had them prepare another room for Alex here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erick waved his hand. &quot;Let Alex stay here for the evening, I&#39;ll take the other room.&quot; Erick strode over to Alex, leaned over and wrapped him up in a strong hug. &quot;I&#39;ll see you tomorrow.. son. Sleep well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex was in no place to argue, he just laid back on the bed as he heard the wizard gathering his things and then following Erick to the door. &quot;Maris.&quot; Erick&#39;s voice was pitched low. &quot;I want you on guard here tonight. Only myself or Pascal through.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, my lord.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good lad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex felt himself drifting off to sleep.</p>
