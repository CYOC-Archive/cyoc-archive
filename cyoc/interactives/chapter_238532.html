<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gavin took a deep breath as he lugged his ginormous balls out of his mom’s car before climbing out himself. There was no way to prepare for this—returning to school, completely naked, with everyone watching. The familiar sight of the schoolyard felt alien as he walked forward, acutely aware of the dozens of eyes staring at his exposed cock and inhuman-sized nuts dragging along behind him. He watched as a few girls he recognized from his class two years ago started whispering to each other, some pointing straight at him. The middle girl Emma said something with a smirk and they all started giggling. Gavin couldn’t help but go bright red with embarrassment, but what was worse was that feeling of his cock slowly getting hard. *No, not now, no please don’t* He begged internally, but unfortunately the combination of his body’s heightened hornyness and the humiliation factor of the girls seeing him got his blood pumping down to the wrong area. Feeling the girls watch in shock as he grew a semi right in front of them, he picked up his pace to find his friends. <br />
<br />
Gavin spotted a few more naked boys when he entered the building. Some were grouped together covering their junk the best they could, others like Johnathan had no shame, and tried to make light of the whole situation. Boner at full mask, he was letting a few of the nearby girls feel his toned muscles and answering all their questions. To his relief, Gavin found part of his friend group by the lockers. Phil, Roy, and one of the twins, Jeffery, were chatting away with the fully clothed Samuel. Gavin still wasn’t sure if he would have traded his manhood to avoid being a perma-nude freak, the way Samuel basically had, but at least Sam’s missing nuts were hidden by his clothes.<br />
<br />
Gavin approached the lockers, apologizing to multiple students along the way whenever his yoga-ball-sized nuts collided with bystanders as he dragged them through the bustling hallway. Phil and Jeffery waved him over, their equally oversized nutsacks resting heavily on the floor behind their legs as they leaned casually against the lockers, trying—and failing—to look nonchalant. Roy, standing between them, smirked as he adjusted his comparatively small, baseball-sized balls, which still seemed out of place but nowhere near as cumbersome.<br />
<br />
They watched a very shy Ben walk passed with his clothed mates, all giving him a hard time for not only being stuck naked but now can’t hide having the smallest dick in the whole school.<br />
“Poor Ben,” Phil said after Ben and his friends were out of earshot. “Bet he had hoped that the pills would have grown his mirco-penis like it grew his balls.”<br />
“He should at least trim his bushy pubes, his dick is so short you can’t even see it through all of that mess.” Jeffery added, who had no visible public hair himself.<br />
&quot;At least all of this doesn’t seem to have affected Randell and Chloe’s relationship.&quot; Roy added, subtly pointing out the overly affectionate couple walking past. Randall had his arm around his clothed girlfriend’s shoulders, just like any normal boyfriend might. The two of them completely ignored his swaying nutsack and his fully erect cock that bobbed up and down as they strolled along. Gavin could see the tip of his cock releasing a steady stream of precum, which then trailed along behind him, leaving thin puddles on the hallway floor like a snail would. Chloe seemed to encourage this by squeezing his firm butt-cheeks or caressing his abs on occasions.<br />
<br />
After a bit more awkward chatting back and forth the school bell rang and they headed to their first class in 2 years. For Gavin, it was math class. Since he couldn’t move through the school halls as fast as most, that meant most of his classmates were already at their desks when he arrived. The “clothed” students openly stared, some letting their jaws drop while others awkwardly whispered to each other or turned away quickly, pretending not to see the naked, big-balled freak standing in the doorway. He felt his cheeks flush but kept his head up, refusing to look down. He caught the teacher’s face too—a strained smile, barely concealing Miss Lighten’s discomfort. <br />
<br />
Even the classrooms had been set up differently, with special desks for the transformed boys. Those with balls like Gavin were assigned desks that had their chairs removed entirely, replaced with extra padding on the floors to allow the boys to sit on their oversized anatomy comfortably. Additionally, each of the transformed boys’ desks, regardless of the size of their balls, had an automatic masturbatory pump attached. Most called them “milking pumps” since they looked and acted like the pumps farmers would use on cow udders. These were installed so that at any time, if a boy got too horny and needed to empty his balls during class, the pump would discreetly do the work for him and collect the ejaculated semen without much disruption. Given how much cum Gavin produced each day, this was a necessity for him to have a remotely functional school life. The stored semen would then be collected at the end of each day and shipped to Genodyne for further study. For Gus, who was also in Gavin’s math class, additional desk pumps were suction cupped over his cock-nipples as well. Unlike the others, these pumps aren’t hidden below the desk, so anyone looking could see Gus’s nipples cum into the pumps’ clear cylinders anytime he’s a little too horny. <br />
<br />
Gavin dragged himself over to his own desk next to Gus and sat on his balls and slipped his semi-hard cock into the desk’s pump. Gus gave a mock-salute as a form of hello, his plump butt-cheeks sagging over the sides of his chair due to their size. There were four other naked students in this particular class, Axel, Declan, Charles, and Elijah, but the one he really wanted here was his boyfriend Myles. With the size of his balls being so big they could not fit through even the widest of the school&#39;s doors, he had to continue being privately tutored at the Genodyne facility he was living at. Sure the two would facetime often, but it wasn’t the same. He wanted to be able to hold is hand again, and give him kisses, and cuddle up against his- **Vrmmmmm** Gavin’s thoughts were interrupted by the sound of his pump turning on below his desk. Caused by his daydreaming getting him extremely horny, his fully engorged cock triggered the milking sequence. The sound drew the attention of the whole class, many turning towards him to see what was happening and started snickering. A few of the girls looked away, disgusted. Even Miss Lighten paused her demonstration to observe the pump working for the first time. Gavin, unable to stop the process, was mortified that he let himself be the first to use the pumps and his entire naked body when bright red, which just made things more embarrassing. After the pump wanked his throbbing dick continuously for a few minutes, Gavin could feel himself getting closer and closer to climax, until he could not hold on any longer. With a loud groan of pleasure, he shot his load down into the pump and the collected fluid slid down the tube and into a storage flask.<br />
<br />
The teacher cleared her throat. <br />
“I am glad the machine is working, but Gavin, in future, please do not disrupt the class with your moaning.”<br />
The class erupted in laughter, and Gavin wanted to shrink so small that no one could see him ever again.<br />
<br />
By lunchtime, Gavin was mentally exhausted. He and his friends, Samuel, Phil, Neal, Jeffery, Roy, Axel and Oscar, found a spot at the edge of the schoolyard, away from most of the crowd, and finally exhaled together, sharing some much-needed laughter to cut the tension. Despite the strangeness of it all, Gavin felt a sense of comfort being with the others, like they were all holding each other up in this surreal new reality. They exchanged jokes about the day, the absurdity of it, the insane twists their lives had taken. And while they laughed, Gavin felt something like normalcy—for the first time, maybe, in months.</p>
