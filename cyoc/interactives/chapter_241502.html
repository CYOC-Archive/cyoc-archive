<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Taking a peak at everyone else to see how they try to eat the &quot;World&quot; felt a bit like cheating. The world seemed to be primordial in a sense, not a lot of civilization. There was vegetation covering decent amounts of landmass and maybe there were animals, but at this scale any individual life wasn&#39;t really visible. Ken started tasting the different lands. The deserts being more grainy and salty, the snow/ice being cold but sweet, the forests reminiscent of the Forest meal, the seas also being quite salty in their own way. There were numerous ways to eat the surface in interesting ways, but Ken figured that the real treat was beneath the surface. The deeper he dug the more of a &quot;soup&quot; he found in the soil/rock/minerals. The molten core had a somewhat meaty flavor mixed with... possibly solidified magic or something. In the end the &quot;World&quot; was just a really well done using some magic to make the aesthetic work. You could mix or eat the biomes as separate as you wanted, mix the sea with the core, etc. Ken was thankful this was a relatively normal meal as his stomach was still a little magic queasy from eating so far into the forest. While he was taking peaks at the others he noted that Kate was half eating with her mouth and half... borging the world as she analyzed bits an pieces. Meanwhile the simulation twins were just eating the food like Ken was. There was no some great dissection or using of special abilities to eat more efficiently or gleam additional information. It was simply eating a meal. Enjoyable and the first part that Ken had actually finished although it was getting closer to a sludge near the end. Still being floating orbs helped getting the last bits.<br />
 The main course was ending and Harry yawned a bit and said &quot;Well that was a nice main course. Wish you a good desert.&quot;<br />
&quot;Likewise&quot; Barry noted as the simulation twins started to leave the young couple alone again. <br />
<br />
Ken asked &quot;Find any new rare minerals in the World?&quot;<br />
Kate said &quot;Yes, there were lots of compounds specially designed that are intriguing and may be tricky to reformulate with my nanomachines. However aside from the technical marvel and a bit of magic... it was mundane.&quot; There was a hush as the Chief came out. <br />
&quot;Ladies and gentleman, I hope you&#39;ve had a good meal. While I believe that a good desert is best held at a specialty store I do need to provide a desert. So here&#39;s the Last Course.&quot; The Chief announced as staff came out with plates with silver domes on top. They were placed in front of everyone and then as the Chief announced the name of the dish the domes were lifted &quot;The After dinner Mint.&quot; and underneath them all was one mint wrapped in plastic. Much like Ken had received after his appetizer. He took the mint and looked around seeing most everyone including Christoph pocketing the mint. Kate as well pocketed her mint. Then the dinner was over, no paying a bill... presumably the Chief didn&#39;t really care about getting it and whatever favors were done or will be done had been noted. <br />
Ken stood up and said &quot;Well I need to talk to Joanne about that magic education. You making any deals?&quot;<br />
Kate said &quot;...I think... I may... ask one of the people I was talking about earlier about getting a territory marked down. An area that we all can collectively say is under my influence so I&#39;m not afraid of stepping on someone&#39;s toes while I experiment with my abilities.&quot;<br />
&quot;...Didn&#39;t you say they were either a super nazi or a super commie?&quot; Ken asked concerned<br />
&quot;There was a third person I didn&#39;t tell you about... although there&#39;ll probably be talks with the other two... It wont affect more than a single city and it&#39;d be my territory anyways...&quot; Kate said sounding somewhat unsure<br />
&quot;I suppose that&#39;s your decision just like the magic thing is mine.&quot; The two left to talk to their seniors <br />
<br />
&quot;Just live your life and in a few days I&#39;ll have found someone and we can set something up for you.&quot; Joanne said she then thought for a second and added &quot;If you want maybe I could even add in a family member or two of yours if you want. Magical aptitude has a chance to be hereditary so if you have a sibling or maybe even your parents may have some talent. Bring some of your old life into the new?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not... sure how I&#39;d feel about THAT... It may be nice, but this also feels somewhat dangerous right?&quot; Ken asked<br />
&quot;Dangerous? You&#39;ve found out there&#39;s a whole other world in the shadows with many people who can wipe out towns by accident, and you think leaving them in the mundane world is safe? Admittedly if they step on the wrong person&#39;s toes there&#39;s a whole different sort of danger, but it&#39;s better to arm them and be able to defend themselves right?&quot; Joanne asked<br />
&quot;...I&#39;d rather leave it up to them.&quot; Ken said acknowledging Joanne&#39;s logic but still unsure. <br />
&quot;Do you need a way home? I could cast a quick spell if you&#39;d like.&quot;<br />
&quot;I need to check out of a hotel tomorrow morning and I should go with my friend&quot; Ken replied<br />
Joanne looked over to Kate and said &quot;I suspect your friend may be out late. I can still port you to your room if you&#39;d like.&quot; <br />
Ken sighed and said &quot;I&#39;ll just walk.&quot; A bit sad that he and Kate may be drifting Ken exited the restaurant and took his phone... He&#39;d nearly forgotten Gerome was his phone. &quot;Hey Gerome, could you text Kate that we&#39;ll be walking to the hotel ahead of her?&quot;<br />
Gerome said &quot;Done, you ok dude?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just a little concerned about Kate... Also you a bit, why have my friends turned into robots?&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey, I&#39;m an A.I. not a robot there&#39;s a difference.&quot;<br />
&quot;Your an inorganic lifeform running off... code and soul stuff I&#39;m guessing. Basically a robot with a soul... Sorry, just feel like we&#39;re drifting apart in senses. You two went a sci-fi route and I went magical despite originally gaining power through the remote.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m thankful that Barry has some of his stuff free to download if you know where to look. I&#39;m living pretty well in a simulation I cooked up.&quot; Ken leaned against a wall and actually booted up his phone to see that Gerome had a well muscled body, chilling in a pool sized hot tub and was surrounded by busty babes of all sorts with some of them feeding him food and drinks. Gerome grinned and looked up at the &quot;camera&quot; and said &quot;Hey, you could turn some. not even some random person but even like an ant into a busty chick for you if you want.&quot;<br />
Ken sighed as he powered down the screen and said &quot;I&#39;m not sure if I should&#39;ve expected something else. Your going Hedonistic, Kate&#39;s experimenting with what she&#39;s got... and I&#39;m... doing nothing.&quot;<br />
&quot;No, you made preparations to get more power. Also that remote does link to Penny in terms of history so if your worried about what she&#39;d think of you that&#39;s valid. I&#39;m a bit worried she may have bugged my phone body or code or something.&quot;<br />
Ken walked back to his hotel room just digesting everything and went to bed.</p>
