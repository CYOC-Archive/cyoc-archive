<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You look to the left pathway, kneeling down to examine the muddy footprints. Though they&#39;re not really footprints, they&#39;re hooves. A pair of four heading off down the dark passage. What would an ordinary animal be doing down here? This is a den for monsters, for corrupted creatures looking for another human to turn. Maybe August will know, he is a hunter.<br />
<br />
&quot;A... horse?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Centaur.&quot;<br />
<br />
Right, that makes a lot more sense. You&#39;re not the most experienced on the topic, but you do know that these creatures are raiders. Usually attacking human villages and kidnapping a guard or two while they&#39;re at it. Though they&#39;ve got more intelligence than your ordinary orcs or goblins. Able to spin calculated plans and use a good bit of magic. Seems like it&#39;s not going to be easy for you, but also, facing something dangerous is exciting. Maybe it&#39;s August&#39;s influence, but you look forward to testing yourself against these monsters.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready to prove yourself, boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hah, of course!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good lad. I&#39;ll be watching.&quot;<br />
<br />
You feel the older man&#39;s spirit dull. Deactivating, yet staying bonded with you. It&#39;s a familiar process, but there&#39;s also a hole in your memory. How the hell did the two of you bond again? You try to remember it as you track the centaur. Finding the stone walls spreading out and reaching their end, opening into a mystical forest where whisps of magic dance through the air. It&#39;s familiar, planting a memory in your mind that you are eager to accept. How you found August bleeding out in a similar environment. How he was never going to achieve his dream of feeling the pleasure of transforming into a monster. How he planted his spirit in you so that if you ever fell, he would get that rush he wanted before passing to the next life.<br />
<br />
With that memory a new part of you, the exploration of this strange passage continues. Its completely alien compared to the part of the dungeon you were just in. There&#39;s no walls, just an expansive woods with dark brown trees and bluish green leaves. High above you is a ceiling of some kind, but it&#39;s still blinding. Bioluminescent vines and plants having attached themselves to the roof, and illuminating this faux-forest as if it was the middle of the day. It really is just an underground woods, how strange...<br />
<br />
The footprints continue deeper into this &#39;forest&#39;, through a winding dirt pathway between the cluster of trees. Next to a flowing stream, loud enough to hide the chittering sounds of the woodland creatures. The clear water rushing to who knows where, it looks clean, probably the main source for the animals and monsters. If this place wasn&#39;t in the middle of a dungeon, it&#39;d be relaxing. Even the air is so clean, you taking in a deep breath and loving the smell of the plant life. How can an area so deep underground be so pure?<br />
<br />
As you continue to bask in the natural beauty around you, your guard drops. You&#39;re aware that there&#39;s centaurs around, probably also orcs and goblins and bugbears and who knows what else. But your fixation on those monsters, and on continuing to take in every odd plant or critter, leaves you oblivious to the rope that tightens around your right leg. Lifting you up off the ground, suspending you in the air as you&#39;ve just been caught in a hunter’s snare. Dangling from your leg, a good two feet away from the ground, and several away from the branch the rope is tightened against. You try to adjust, to bend up and undo the binding. But you have no sword to cut yourself free, nor the strength to loosen this restraint. All you can do is wait until the sound of clopping hooves greets you from ahead.<br />
<br />
The very centaur you were trailing steps into view. Naked, as per usual with these monsters. The only &#39;clothing&#39; of sorts on him being a bow strapped around his burly chest. He looks strong, muscles as big as your former barbarian friend. Two firm pecs, a set of abs, and the monster’s horse-like lower half. Chestnut coloured fur covering his strong legs and tauric bottom half, the same colour as his braided full beard, and short cut hair. The centaur’s expression is rough, eyebrows low, mouth in a slight frown. But the more he looks at you, the more that frown turns to a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t expect my traps to catch a human. What&#39;s a guy like you doing in my woods?&quot;<br />
<br />
He&#39;s just... talking to you? No breaking the rope and pushing you against a tree? His speech doesn&#39;t even mention anything about converting you. Maybe... he&#39;s not a monster? You think back to your former companion, he did seem human too even after turning. What if they&#39;re not all... monstery. Still, you&#39;re not entirely comfortable. From this angle you can see his sheath, and the horseheaded pole that&#39;s already standing erect under his lower half. Drips of pre mixing into his fur, and the dirt underneath him. It&#39;s clear he&#39;s aroused... but still, he isn&#39;t doing anything... yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah. Just an adventurer trapped down here. You know the way out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I do, human. Let me help you down.&quot;<br />
<br />
The monster reaches for your legs, though he takes his time to get there. His thick fingers pressing into you, one hand on your chest, the other your back. Getting a feel for your smooth skin, your thin chest, and eventually your ass. Giving it a tight squeeze, holding onto your plump rump, and then bringing his fingers around your erect cock. Giving your small dick a few strokes, which is enough to push you over that limit. Everything has been so tantalizing, so stimulating. Your gruff friend becoming a sexy naga. Those illustrations all across the dungeon walls. And now this centaur grabbing onto you like an animal he has caught. Your load sinking into the grass and dirt under you, mouth wide opened as the man brings you into an awkward kiss.<br />
<br />
His clean beard tickles the top of your head, one hand staying on your ass, and the other now undoing the ropes. You getting a good taste of this man. His lovemaking putting you in your place, convincing you to just stay still as his tongue invades your mouth. Enjoying as much of you as he can, even as the trap is undone, and you start to fall. Not even dropping an inch as his grip on your ass tightens, and the centaur rotates you to properly face him. The awkward kiss now far easier, your small body cuddling against his burly chest. Arms wrapping around his compact back. Supporting you against him, as he begins to trot away. Bringing you to who knows where, not that you&#39;re caring. Right now, all you want is more of this centaur.<br />
<br />
He continues to lead you as your mouths remain linked. Not letting go of your ass, and not letting you escape his lustful kiss. You just looking into the silver eyes of your conqueror, and feeling the glory of his magic work itself into you. Your ass getting thicker, getting plumper as he continues to squeeze and feel your newest asset. Your thin chest getting even thinner, arms losing even the most basic of muscles. Becoming smoother, and your form becoming curvy. Completely flat chest rubbing against his masculine pecs, smooth skin stimulated by his burly build. The new you feeling so good, so ready to be protected by this brave centaur. You ignoring everything besides him, even the sounds of the animals, and the other centaurs that congratulate this hunter on his catch. <br />
<br />
You are led through the village, and to this beast’s own home. The door kicked opened, the centaur giving your rear one last squeeze, before dropping you onto a pile of cushions. The pillows absorbing the entire impact of the fall, you landing on your ass. Now staring at the lower half of the centaur, and his equine pride. It’s at least twice, if not three times as big as your own human member. Though the size differences only increase as your cock shrinks and his... grows. He’s stealing the length from your cock, taking away everything you no longer need. Getting you ready to become something better, something just for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I get pretty riled up after a successful hunt. Want to help relieve me?&quot;<br />
<br />
You do, but you don&#39;t. This is the line that will break you, that will make you into another centaur. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t... know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, human. I&#39;ve been wanting a husband for a long while, and I&#39;d think you&#39;d make a perfect one.&quot;<br />
<br />
You would, of course you would. Your own tauric body much smaller than his. Your form made for squeezes and gropes, to be appreciated by your very own stallion. To organize your home, prepare your meals, and lean against your better half. It would be heaven, having a new home with such a kind and brave centaur. As you continue to dream of this possible future, the centaur starts to trot off to his table. Setting down his bow, though not before pulling back the string and flexing his muscles. Showing off for you, and only you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got to get some more arrows. Think you&#39;ll be more in the mood for this when I get back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... yeah, um. Thanks…&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Barsein, and don&#39;t worry. You&#39;ll get your own centaur name when you become one of us. Now I gotta be quick, don&#39;t want to keep you waiting.&quot;<br />
<br />
He practically knocks the door off its hinges as he rushes outside. You can&#39;t imagine this stud will be gone long, and you can&#39;t wait for him to return. Unless... you are really planning to leave. The door is open, you could just walk out. But that would leave Barsein heartbroken, and also, leave your needy ass unsatiated.</p>
