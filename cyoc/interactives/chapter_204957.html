<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I don’t see why.“ Brent Hollins nibbled on his turkey and swiss sandwich as he looked over at his girlfriend, Dina. He adored the dab of mustard around the edge of the sandwich. Honestly, he could just eat packet after packet of this kind of mustard and never get tired of it. But he resisted that urge when Dina was around because she said it made her sick to her stomach.<br />
<br />
“I don’t see why. I don’t see why… Listen to yourself. First of all, vision coded language is something you need to work on. Imagine if you ran into a blind person and you told them… I don’t see why. Consider instead, I don’t feel that is correct or I don’t believe that. Don’t presume that something is visually obvious, please.”<br />
<br />
Brent nodded and finished up the last of his sandwich. He wasn’t gonna bother fighting these points with her because they had fallen backwards from Dina‘s original idea. She wanted him to partake in a new store which she claimed broke down caustic and painful gender roles. He was all for that kind of thing. Most of the time, it just involved Dina recommending “safe and low confrontation“ colors of clothing to him. He was, of course, perfectly allowed to wear whatever he wanted, but the colors she liked him wearing kept her mental health regulated.<br />
<br />
Since her hair was neon pink, that was her preferred tone for his outfits. Brent honestly had never worn that color for any length of time before meeting Dina at a required gender studies course at the community college. It wasn’t that bad. He found a wide variety of whimsical outfits which met with Dina‘s wholehearted approval. She just had her random things and pet peeves and he was more than willing to oblige her idiosyncrasies. He did his best not to verbally refer to her qualities that way though, also avoiding ‘quirks’.<br />
<br />
This time, however, she had laid down quite a big ask. She wanted him to spend some time transformed into a girl. Dina framed it as part of a sample exploration for one of her term papers in Sociology and part educating him on the toxic qualities of masculinity. He didn’t particularly see why him in particular because he felt like he was very flexible when it came to that sort of thing. but Dina had been going to the college for at least five years, so he deferred to her. <br />
<br />
Dina had also scheduled his appointment at this place and cancellation incurred a penalty. She slipped over and settled against his lap as she cajoled him, “I know you don’t mean to be ignorant and biased. Society just feeds it. You rise above all that. You’re sexy. And I want you to be your complete self. Be a gender fluid being who understands things across the spectrum. That’s so hot.” <br />
<br />
He considered himself a simple man and that was about all the convincing he needed. There were plenty of hints about how mind-bending the female orgasm was. But helping Dina complete her project was enough for him. She eased his worry with several hours in bed, doing whatever she wanted. <br />
<br />
The whole matter felt rather like a dentist appointment to him. He had no idea what to expect from this place but there were plenty of rumors.<br />
<br />
The technology had existed for a few years to rewrite men into women and vice versa. It was a nano particle that spread through the blood. A bunch of largely novelty stores sold the Chinese variant very cheap and he once witnessed, like a parlor trick, where a guy got on a specially modified stationary bike and the pounds and his sex just melted away. That was a version. It was rather like those tilt to move rolling things popular at least a decade ago. They tended to show up on movies and in the random news items, but no one he knew got into them. <br />
<br />
Dina described this new boutique place as being like the Apple Store of customized transformation. That notion stuck in Brent‘s brain as they finally arrived on the appointed day. The store itself seemed quite cozy with a pleasant aroma and lots of places to sit and stretch out. Bands of twisting rainbow color wove along the ceiling and to the sides. Video of happy people filled the walls beside all sorts of marketing slogans. <br />
<br />
Brent poked at his phone while Dina waited in line up front and dealt with the important things. His heart thundered in his ears. He wasn’t gonna chicken out, but he also just wanted to get on with it. Dina soon returned with a pamphlet bearing a QR code for an app. She delighted, “They have so many ethnic choices. I have to tweet about this. While it would be eye-opening to lean into that, it would also be problematic if we changed your race. Like blackface or something. Learning about the other half spectrum should be enough.” Brent‘s head swam too much to raise any objections.<br />
<br />
It didn’t take long before one of the Experience Assistants joined them with a tablet and cordially asked, “Can I help you with fine-tuning your experience or any other technical considerations? With the app, you can submit your whole request on your own or I can walk you through it.”<br />
<br />
Brent suddenly felt sweaty all over. Walking into this place and hearing about it was one thing. Being there as a serious person seriously walked through all this stuff and it wasn’t one big joke, made him feel woozy. He knew that Dina had told him that the “meat space” wasn’t a big deal and everyone could decide what gender along the spectrum they were no matter what physically, but changing up his entire perspective was daunting when looking at right in the face.<br />
<br />
The lady seemed to catch this without him saying. She was slightly taller than Dina with a rounded but sleek face. Instead of being spiky, her brunette hair fell like a theater drape across her shoulders. She smiled a lot more than Dina, but Dina often vented about that sort of thing. She gave her name as Misty and reassured Brent that she would make sure everything went smoothly.<br />
<br />
Her uniform was a strange combination of muted gray with radiant light peach rising up in twisting bands interlaced with sky blue strands. It was like an inverted, strangely colored solar radiance emerging from the ground or a sunrise. That was apparently the company logo, but she wore it well.<br />
<br />
Dina rolled her eyes and folded her arms as Brent took a breath and explained that he wanted to be walked through just for reassurance. He was about 6 feet tall but his other self would be around 5 foot 3, just shorter than Dina but not too much. His sandy blonde hair would be lightened to a fair blonde because Dina enjoyed that color but not enough to dye it.<br />
<br />
His rather bulbous nose would be slimmed into a shape that matched his maternal genetic history while his rather round face would be more of a stretched oval. Misty tapped on her device and then showed a provisional facial example. Brent couldn’t imagine such a girlish face being the one he would see in the mirror. The full lips also seemed a bit absurd. Dina quipped that they weren’t turning him into a bimbo, just a normal lady. The example neck seemed so tiny though.<br />
<br />
Brent had a sense it was coming but, when they got to bust size, Dina kept expanding the option until it landed on what had to be a G cup. She teased that this would be an education in reality versus fantasy, adding, “Prepare for intimate knowledge of how much back pain matters and isn’t a joke and how often reductions are done for important reasons.” He didn’t think that he joked about this sort of thing ever, but he had to admit that his eyes did wander to very prominent chests, like the one being previewed on the screen. <br />
<br />
He felt quietly embarrassed about the developing figure depicted but Misty remained the consummate professional. Curvy hips and thick thighs, along with a prominent rear end also had to be included. While the starting position included light body hair, Dina made a point of setting it so the growth rate would be at least normal for an adult woman. She wanted to make absolutely sure Brent knew about depilatories, bikini areas, and the “burden” of beautification. <br />
<br />
Misty flashed a sympathetic smile as they finalized all the physical details. Beyond that, Dina made absolutely certain that the organization of nerves meant the new girl would have a tricky, but still normal time getting off instead of an easy one. Brent didn’t have any problems with that because he wasn’t particularly focused on those things. He was also fine with a challenge. He figured Dina would educate him on the nuances so he could wind up a better lover too. <br />
<br />
The company couldn’t do much to mental states but Dina emphasized tweaks to brain chemistry for sharpened emotions and low end feelings for the sake of education. It wasn’t that she wanted Brent to be sad as a girl, but she noted that this was meant to be educational about the fullness of being a woman. Plus, what she was studying involved mental health in women, so this was necessary. Brent had given up trying to object and patiently waited for it to be finished.<br />
<br />
So far as a method, Dina delighted at a couple which included a simulation of a thunderstorm, magic showers, and being assaulted by clothing. Brent would’ve been fine with just walking through a door and walking out as someone else but he agreed to a thunderstorm because he liked them and things had been dry lately. <br />
<br />
The duration was automatically set to a month based on the promotional rate they received with Dina as a student. Instead of $49.99, it was bumped down to $34.93 without additional fees. Dina insisted on a pairing crystal. This allowed her to control the transformation and revert it when necessary. <br />
<br />
Misty cautioned that, despite the fact they were set to a month, if they lost the crystal then they would be unable to do any further modifications or even deactivate it. She strongly advised the inclusion of a failsafe at the six month mark for the nano particles, but Dina promised she would take care of the crystal. <br />
<br />
Brent was vaguely aware of all this technical junk but rattling nerves blinded him to dwelling on it. For legal purposes, they decided on Lucy Amanda Hollins for the new girl’s name. Brent could barely process the looming prospect of that being his name for any length of time.<br />
<br />
Once everything was settled and signed, with full agreement, Misty ushered Brent back into one of the private suites at the rear of the boutique. She explained that the nano particle would affect his perceptions so that it seemed the room led out into an area about to rain and then the scenario would commence. <br />
<br />
She additionally explained that clothing was provided in a cabinet at the side of the suite. She also made it clear that nothing in the suite was filmed for privacy reasons, but his vitals were being monitored all the time. If he wanted out of the scenario, then the code phrase was “chiffon“ and she would terminate everything immediately.<br />
<br />
“Are you absolutely certain you want to do this and you choose to do this out of your own free will?” Her silvery eyes narrowed at him with an edge of concern. She looked only back at him. Brent felt an internal wavering. He asked what Misty would tell Dina, if he canceled. <br />
<br />
“There is a certain percent of the population which has an extreme negative reaction to the nano particle. They can still go through with the process but legally in the state we need to run a blood test and extended testing that can take upwards of a minimum of 60 days. I really don’t think you have that but one never knows. If you’re concerned that you might, feel free to tell me please.” She all but winked.<br />
<br />
A part of him absolutely wanted to take her offer and pull him back from this crazy cliff. Another part of him didn’t want to disappoint Dina. And the rest grumbled about how indecisive he was being. Ultimately, he said,” I’m fine. Let’s do this.”<br />
<br />
Past a black curtain, he opened very normal door and stepped through another curtain into what looked to be luxurious suite at a nice hotel. The impossible fact was that this room overlooked a spacious pool and outdoor garden. It was afternoon and huge masses of thunderclouds loomed in the sky, blocking out the day. <br />
<br />
Based on the structured scenario, Brent knew that if he tried to hide inside from the rain, that it would just work its way into the building anyway. Besides, he already felt like he was being weak. If he presumed to be a man, then he also knew that wearing the kinds of colors Dina wanted and setting aside that manhood temporarily only strengthened his resolve that he was a true man underneath it all. <br />
<br />
He could do this and he would do this and it wouldn’t be a big deal. Gender stuff was just made-up things anyway, according to Dina. No matter how he looked, he would still be the same person. This might even help her to get a really influential paper together and it could be like her final thesis. She hadn’t really suggested that, but he knew, as she continued her education, that if he provided a resolute example, then that would be a big help to everyone.<br />
<br />
Brent stepped outside right as drops of rain started to darken the cement. One speck falling on his head became several. It toyed with the length of his hair, unfurling it from a close bowl shape into bright dangling locks that framed his vision. This was actually fucking real, was a notion that swiftly dawned on him. Retreating suddenly felt like a good idea even though he knew it would rain through the ceiling.<br />
<br />
Every feeling and notion inside his head as a little boy growing up into a man echoed like a declaration. He was about to be emasculated. He was about to be turned into one of them. A fearful strand of the notion felt oddly sexy amidst the rising terror. But that sensation stopped at the actuality of being turned into a woman. <br />
<br />
It wasn’t enough to make him want to yell chiffon because that would be giving in but he reminded himself of that word as heavy curtains of hair spilled past his shoulders and his face started to tickle with the rain collecting on his features. In his head, the water almost felt like it was melting him. It wasn’t painful though, not physically. The sense that his flesh was shifting felt intimately disconcerting. Like tearing away skin to reveal new skin underneath. The process cooled and soothed, as though trying to convey that it was just cleaning away mud, but Brent wasn’t fooled.<br />
<br />
With a flash far away and a thick crinkle of thunder, the downpour unleashed. Brent could feel the way that he breathed changing. The structure of his ribcage shifted, even before the presence of weight started to develop. His arms felt immensely heavy even as they dwindled to slender, almost sticklike extremities. <br />
<br />
Everything about him lost bulk. Dina mentioned the other day when she was scheduling that she wanted a figure for him more curvaceous like her with what she referred to as “normal body fat”. The representative relayed that state regulations prevented them from crossing a certain threshold because of the health risk. Dina made much of that and vocally complained, but that was all.<br />
<br />
Moderate degrees of thickness settled into his behind and along his dampened legs. The weirdest sensation he could track was how far his hips spread out with an obvious flare and his legs situated afterwards. Just shifting in place required gradual adjustment and walking seemed bizarre. He didn’t fall, but did wobble with uncertainty. Getting shorter certainly didn’t help. <br />
<br />
Thoroughly drenched now, the tingling lanced between his legs as sensations sunk to a strange, dimpling fissure in his being. With resigned awareness, he was a she. But that was just the meat. It’s still meant a lot to him though, despite trying his hardest with Dina‘s suggestions.<br />
<br />
The weighty presence of the rain dragged his saturated clothes down to the point they were nearly falling off, except for the front of his shirt, which flared up with obvious twin mounds. Watching the development kindled different sensations than realizing he was the participant. The absolute mass on his chest spilled over onto the sides such that there was no way to move his arms and avoid bumping into some warm, fleshy soft part. <br />
<br />
He could easily see the disadvantage and the overwhelming presence was greater than anything else. A feature that felt impossible to overlook. Even adjusting the pendulous weight to see past them took effort. The rain abated and he ventured back into the suite to look for clothing. As established, the cabinet was full of options meant for him. The fancy and dressy options were the first overlooked since Dina made a big deal of taking him shopping for the full experience. Brent instead gravitated to a gray cotton poly long sleeve shirt which didn’t have too much cling but also rested above his hips. <br />
<br />
Undressing was an adventure as whatever denials were shed with the reveal of his altered flesh. He looked so girly from his long slender limbs to his narrow shoulders, tiny waistline, and plush thighs. The absolute coup de grace was seeing the understated, receding dimple crease of suggestive flesh flanked by a puffy crown of blonde pubic hair instead of the modest but obvious manhood that should’ve been there. He knew not to fixate on the physical, but it still felt like a stark loss. <br />
<br />
The general first impression of this new body in his all together… her all together, was she felt immensely fat despite the regulations. Everything encompassing her was soft to the point of absurdity. Even her skin felt like someone had inserted extra padding. At the same time, it felt scoured, raw, and much closer to the surface. Her entire body tingled despite the changes fully completed. Even her face felt fat because of the jutting profile of her lips. And whatever didn’t feel fat on her instead seemed dinky and like a child’s version. It was an absolutely creepy fun house twisting and contortion of everything she might consider part of her being. That was absolutely eye-opening so far as perspective. Processing it felt overwhelming. <br />
<br />
Shorts and drawstring pants provided some insulation. Before leaving, she found and slipped on a generous brassiere with openings in the front. In the nearby mirror, instead of Brent, she found a blonde woman with disheveled hair, and a rather generic workout outfit. A certain part of him instantly thought that she could’ve shown a little more skin while the rest was perfectly fine not showing off anything. It was bad enough to her that the curves of her chest and the suggestion of her butt just seemed to keep going and going and flowing and spilling and stretching to the point of absurdity. She could find no respite for her awareness to land which felt like familiar territory. <br />
<br />
And that was supposed to be the point. An adventure outside of everything he knew, stretching into the aspects of being human that he otherwise would never really understand. Even like this was just the Cliff Notes since, as Dina reminded him, he would just be strapping on this form for a short time versus growing up from a girl to a woman. <br />
<br />
It was easy to fuss, fear, and feel nervous emotions in the mirror. The brain chemistry changes were intended to intensify moments like this as well. She steadied herself and tried walking as normal as possible. It still wasn’t smooth, but she didn’t feel like she was going to face plant if she made a mistake. Her altered stomach didn’t want anything and further insisted it was ready for a full clearance without warning. She mentally squeezed that down and did her best forget. <br />
<br />
The world outside seemed especially terrifying now, but she relaxed as much as possible and gingerly stepped towards the curtain and the door that led out.</p>
