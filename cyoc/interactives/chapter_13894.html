<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">All of them were thrown back onto the floor after this ordeal while Zodis approached them once again. A dagger appeared in his hand, pulled from his sleeve.<br />
Six flashing cuts from it freed the boys from their cuffs.<br />
Although they wanted, the power to stand up wasn't theirs.<br />
The best they could was get onto their bellies. All of them tried to vomit, to get rid of the potion that was taking his effect.<br />
&quot;M....my body....is....burning!&quot;. escaped from the lips of Harold.<br />
&quot;I need air... can't breath.. &quot;, Matthew gasped.<br />
His coat of mail was stretched to its maximum. His chest appeared to have swollen. He was trapped inside a metal corset. Suddenly a metal-like sound was heard. First one, then two, then more of the small rings in his coat gave away, allowing his chest to expand.<br />
Gideon on the other hand was rubbing at his ears. They hurt like hell. Little did he noticed that they were pointy. A burning sensation, starting from the back of his head started to travel down along his spine. Seconds later He too stated gasping for air. His coat was also getting to small. Lucky for him, his coat gave away more easily because the straps gave away because they were damaged.<br />
Both of the boys arched their backs to ease the burning sensation. To get it free from their clothes. Their tunics ripped soon after their coats exposing growing hairs. Long coarse ones on their spines, softer one on the rest of their back.<br />
<br />
Harold was experiencing another discomfort. His tights were stuck inside his armor. He had already removed the upper part, seeing his friends going trough the changes, but failed to get his trousers of.<br />
Finally being able to get upon his knees, he succeeded to unbuckle his pants, temporally relieving some of the restraint. Then he too heard a ripping sound. His pants gave away, almost immediately releasing an already four foot long tail. A goldcollored tail. Excited from the relieve he yelled, rose up and let himself fall on his back, covered in sweat, now laing naked in front of a very amused Gregory.<br />
His legs were now slowly pushed apart. He was a bit shocked to see his genitals expand. His balls and sack pulsed slowly, relentlessly getting bigger, darkening and when he felt with his fingers, leather like. His penis was also pulsing. Dark red , it was forming a fleece between his abdomen and his shaft, also darkening, becoming more and more that of a horse. On top of that he felt the urge to cum.<br />
It puzzled his racing mind. Could he be turned on because he was becoming a horse.<br />
<br />
Gideon and Matthew lost their upper clothing exposing an expanding back and chest that was gradually covered with hair. Matthew got dark brown hair with a dark line in the middle to match his hair color that grew out into a 5 inch long mane.<br />
Gideon sprouted a variation of colors. Patches of white, black and brown mixed to cover his back and traveled down to his belly.<br />
A sudden surge rippled trough them, forging their tails right trough their pants. Within seconds they were fully grown, functional tails matching the rest.<br />
Internal reformations forced them to get onto their knees and hands while two guards removed the remaining clothes from them as a gesture of goodwill, under a somewhat disliking eye of Gregory.<br />
<br />
&quot;I introduced the need to cum as an experiment, and to somewhat comforting the transition.&quot;: Zodis gniffled.<br />
&quot;Of course it can be removed if My-lord wishes it.&quot;, he hastily added, seeing the flickering eyes of his master rushing to meet his face.<br />
Gregory let his eyes travel back at the three boys and slowly stood up. He began to circle around them to look at them, while the changes proceeded.<br />
Gideon and Matthew were now both supporting a horse trunk. Gregory watched their legs also being forced apart to accommodate their growing equipment. All three of them were now having an erect almost fully complete horse dick.<br />
A sudden jolt of arrousment forced them to eject a mass of cum, some on each other, some against their bellies, and most on the floor.<br />
a second wave of transformation set in, forcing their hindquarters up.<br />
Shifting bones forced them to stand onto the tip of their toes, while fur crepped downward. It felled like there legs were forced into a mall. Toes forced together, slowly combining to one. Bones being stretched liked clay.<br />
Harold was the most submitted to changes in this face. His transformation had also expanded his chest, leaving all three of them with hindquarters and trunks of a horse.<br />
They felt the internal &quot;storm&quot; subdue for a moment, giving them a moment to rest.<br />
It was a strange sight. Three boys, partial transformed with their hindquarters in the air. They couldn't go to lay down. In order to do that, they needed to shift weights with the forelegs.<br />
Forelegs? they didn't have forelegs yet, just arms. Arms that couldn't bear the weight of their new bodies.<br />
&quot;Is that all?&quot;, an irritated Gregory asked to Zodis.<br />
&quot;Not at all!&quot;,he replied while watching a strange amulet he was holding in his hand.&quot; you see. This amulet gives me the ability to see if the potion has done its work. As long as it glows, it is still active. The forces are just giving them a break.It will give me the ability to command them from a distance, even to talk to them.<br />
But others will only hear whinnying. If you want to question Harold or the others you'll need to give them the amulet. Then all of your generals will be able to hear his answers without you repeating them to them.&quot;<br />
A sudden flash from the pendant broke him of.<br />
&quot;It has started again&quot;: Zodis yelled franticly.<br />
Indeed it started again. their faces were pulling out, teeth fell out, immediately being replaced by new ones to accommodate the muzzle.<br />
&quot;If we get you for this, you'll pay for this&quot;, escaped from Harold lips, accompanied by two echos of the other boys:&quot;You'll pay for this. You'lliiihhhg hihihihiiir.&quot;<br />
Changing vocal cords cut them of from human speech.<br />
In the mean time their dicks were still erect and pouring an ever growing pool of semen onto the floor.<br />
Hooves had formed in the meantime, While elongating arms, now forelegs were forcing their heavy bodies up.<br />
Still unsteady, they did not charge, unable to and restraint by a strange force.<br />
After a few more minor adjustment the pendant started to fade. Facial markings were erased, fur has completely covered every part of their body, new sound and smells poured into their heads trough their noses and ears.<br />
But why were their intestines still rumbling.<br />
Suddenly, almost together, they had to vomit, forcing the meals they had earlier onto the floor, while their asses produced their first dung.<br />
&quot;Horses do have other eating habits then humans&quot;, Zodis explained.<br />
&quot;Are they becoming any bigger anymore?&quot;:Gregory asked on an irritated tone almost unable to overcome the noise the three newborn horses made.<br />
&quot;No, I'm afraid not&quot;, Zodis replied to him while looking at the pendant.<br />
&quot;Those are useless for my army. They are only the size of ponies, you old fool.&quot; He shouted.<br />
&quot;But My-lord. This is an experimental potion, based on the info i got from the scrolls. Surely you wouldn't expect me to translate them so quickly and achieve a flawless result.It requires a lot of skill to translate brew this concoction. I think it is age related&quot;<br />
&quot;alright, i guess they could still be useful for my boy in the tournament or in the mill, but could you do something for me?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, My-lord?&quot;<br />
&quot;let them shut up.&quot;<br />
&quot;Certainly, My-lord&quot;. A quick gesture forced the three boys to shut up due to the magic of the concoction.<br />
&quot;Put the magic halters around their necks and clean them and give them a good grooming and food. They will perform in the junior devision being ridden be my junior team&quot;. Gregory ordered.<br />
They are led away toward new stables. Prepared for the tournament.<br />
<br />
There they stood.<br />
Three new ponies. Harold: A light brown draft horse with golden manes, little white feathers at his hoofs, a fluffy tail and the most muscled of the three.<br />
Matthew: White with a black manes, black hooves ,the most striking of them all.<br />
Gideon: Three-colored( black, brown , white), the smallest of them all, the cutest of the three.<br />
They wanted to join the game. Now they have joined. They are in the game.<br />
They will see the whole game from the first row.<br />
They will see the whole game from underneath the performers.<br />
THEY ARE THE SHOW.<br />
<br />
<br />
Forced by magic to do the bidding of Gregory, Will they be able to escape and attain their former shape? Or are they doomed to fight with the knights who rides them?</p>
