<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This is my last entry, feel free to continue</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Eric&#39;s shrinkage had stopped, he was finally fully conscious. And boy, was he horny. His cock stood at full attention, as he began to massage it. He noticed that he at least felt lighter, compared to just minutes ago, and his bulk was a bit smaller, though still enormous. Eric was slouching in the couch, his fat cock pointing straight up. Just as he was about to nut, his former nerd brain ticked in. How big had he gotten? He knew there was a measuring tape here somewhere, his brother had been using the garage as a weight room from time to time, and liked to know his measurements.<br />
<br />
It was difficult to walk, since he had to calibrate his movements to fit with his new, giant proportions. Every step made his belly wobble, and his pecs shook too. He could see the head of his fat cock bobbing up and down. After some time looking, he found the tape measure, and also a weight scale. Did he dare? &quot;Of course,&quot; he smiled to himself. He&#39;d been 155 lbs at the start of all of this, now he was... <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit.&quot; The scale said quite clearly: 346 lbs. He&#39;d more than doubled his weight! After processing this for a few minutes, he turned to the tape measure. He knew that he&#39;d been rather small downstairs, around 4,5 inches, but earlier today he&#39;d been certain that he was a full footlong. It didn&#39;t take much for his cock to plump and stiffen up, reaching for the sky. Along, 10... 12... His heavy, bearded jaw dropped. His cock was a full fourteen inches long! That had to be the biggest in human history! Then he remembered that he had just been able to fit his hands around the thing, and measured the girth. He&#39;d heard that four to five was the normal in girth. He didn&#39;t even have 8 or 9 inches, he had 11 fucking inches! The thought of it all was too much for him to bear, and soon he was on the brink of emptying his big balls again. Just as he was about to orgasm, though, he remembered: Kyle had spent some time inside the house, a house in which one room was filled with magic! &quot;I have to- AAAAHHH!&quot; he came powerfully, coating the couch with his spunk. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Kyle had been walking around the house, trying to determine where Eric had hidden the jacket. He&#39;d looked into Eric&#39;s room, the laundry room, the basement... nothing. But then he remembered that Eric had been standing right next to the door to their living room, and hurried down there, his steps down the stairs sounding a bit heavier than usual.<br />
<br />
You see, as Kyle had been searching around the house, the magic in the living room had sensed the presence of a young man with much potential, a man the jacket&#39;s magic recognized, a man whom the jacket had given shredded muscle and defined mass. The jacket also felt that some of the growth that had been given to the other one, the one that had grown so much that the jacket had torn, had passed on to this boy. And so, the magic, which was partly influenced by Eric&#39;s growth, had seeped in microscopic amounts, through cracks, to reach Kyle. By the time he&#39;d reached the door to the living room, he&#39;d put on another twenty pounds, most of it muscle, some of it - through Eric&#39;s influence - fat. Because he felt it, perhaps subconsciously, he&#39;d removed his jeans, which had begun tearing. Kyle opened the door to the living room. When he peeked in, he saw the tattered remains of Eric&#39;s clothes, and there, by the table, the remains of his jacket. Kyle didn&#39;t spot the magic that was swirling around in the air, and stepped in to examine the jacket.<br />
<br />
As he was holding the rags, he said aloud: &quot;Oh, come on, Eric, you big, clumsy- urk!&quot; The last sound was because of the feeling that came over him. The magic had invaded him, and suddenly he could see the rivers of light that were penetrating his skin, into his muscles, his face, his bones, his genitals. &quot;Aaaah!&quot; Kyle felt himself growing, all of his muscles suddenly feeling as if on fire, blood pumping throughout his body, his cock growing painfully erect. As Kyle swelled bigger and bigger, his abs faded slightly, his brawn taking on a layer of fat. He came, several times, and still his cock hardened and he ejaculated. It felt like it had taken hours, but in reality, it had only taken five minutes, the &quot;freed&quot; magic working much more quickly than the jacket. He looked at himself. Enormous. Then his vision blurred, as he orgasmed again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Eric had hurried as much has he could, to stop Kyle from entering the living room. But when he trotted into his house, he saw the door to the living room wide open, moans coming from the inside - far deeper than Kyle&#39;s voice. The sight that met him was astounding.<br />
<br />
Kyle had smashed the living room table, presumably because he&#39;d toppled, and was now slouching in the couch, his thunder-thighs spread wide. In his hand was a second jug of milk, the origins of which Eric couldn&#39;t imagine, and the cardboard from three frozen pizzas were torn open across the room. A large puddle of cum that Eric had not been responsible for coated the carpet, and Kyle was completely nude. And, he was bigger than Eric. <br />
<br />
It certainly looked like it, in any case. The huge teen&#39;s cock was at full erection, his balls resting on the couch, while the thighs were spread wide. &quot;Kyle?&quot; The bull put down the jug, licking his lips, looking towards Eric, who still was watching from the doorway. &quot;Eric!&quot; he boomed. Kyle&#39;s voice was every bit as deep as Eric&#39;s, but it was more melodious and rich. Eric was also surprised to see that although Kyle did have a light scruff, his face hadn&#39;t gotten a lot older-looking. Instead, he&#39;d become broader and a bit more chiseled, but his face was still boyish, contrasting with the massive body. Kyle didn&#39;t look like he was going to stand up, so Eric stepped into the room. He could see clearly now, that Kyle was bigger. &quot;Well,&quot; Kyle said, &quot;do you want to measure me?&quot; At first Eric didn&#39;t get it. But then he saw that he was still holding the measuring tape in his hand - he&#39;d come in the garage with it in his hands, and then run straight inside. &quot;Dude,&quot; Eric began, still not used to his new voice, &quot;I tried to stop you from coming in here. I- I measured myself, that&#39;s why I have this. But I didn&#39;t mean for the jacket to tear, I just couldn&#39;t get it off, and then I tried to shut it in here, but you clearly came in here, and-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bro, I&#39;ve lost count on how many times I&#39;ve come in here the last ten minutes. But yeah, it&#39;s a bit much. You have too little food, though, I had to use my own.&quot; Eric looked from Kyle to the jug of milk. Kyle lifted it to his mouth and chugged the remains as if his life depended on it, the sticky, viscous remains... &quot;DUDE! Are you drinking your own cum?!&quot; Eric was appalled. &quot;Well, yeah,&quot; Kyle said, before burping, &quot;it&#39;s not like there&#39;s anything else here to eat, besides, cum has a lot of protein and fat!&quot; With that, Kyle gave his gigantic cock a quick rub, using both hands. Moaning, he directed the milk jug towards his piss slit, and he stretched his arms as the jug slowly filled with thick, viscous semen. It looked like Kyle&#39;s cock might go down, but it suddenly became erect again, pulsing and throbbing. &quot;You see,&quot; Kyle said, in between big gulps, &quot;I don&#39;t - swallow - think - swallow - that I&#39;m - swallow - done - swallow - growing!&quot; <br />
Eric could see Kyle&#39;s stomach more clearly now. It wasn&#39;t the ripped and shredded eight-pack that he&#39;d expected, instead Kyle had a generous spare tyre around his waist, his gut becoming more prevalent as he gulped down a gallon of his own cum.<br />
<br />
&quot;OOOH,&quot; Kyle moaned as he finished the gallon, &quot;It&#39;s happening!&quot; Kyle sagged further down into the couch as he relaxed, the jug falling to the floor, his cock becoming even harder. Eric watched as Kyle&#39;s skin reddened, his veins in stark relief. <br />
<br />
Kyle felt the bulking begin. A few minutes earlier, he&#39;d burst out of his underwear, as his ass and junk became too much for the fabric to handle. Now, he felt himself rising slightly, as his rear gained ever more mass. His muscles were stretching, pumping, contracting and growing, and he looked down, to find his downwards view steadily shrinking, as the two slabs of meat that were his pecs were swelling, bigger and heavier, each a bloated, heavy sphere. At the same time, he felt his midsection thickening slightly - he didn&#39;t get the belly that Eric sported, but nor did he possess the wasp-waist that he&#39;d had earlier that day, the slim, lean boy having thickened and bulked out massively. Though his abs were slightly visible, they were hidden under a moderate layer of fat. He did have a gut though - bloat, full of nutrition. He could feel his thick cum sloshing around, as the nutrients were absorbed into his body. While the gut subsided, he felt bones snapping and reforming, his shoulders widening, his deltoids swelling to the size of basketballs, while his upper arms packed on girth. The pecs were still growing, though slower, and he noticed that, while he&#39;d been focused on his upper body, his thighs had packed on mass too - he had to spread them further to avoid crushing his junk. Speaking of...<br />
<br />
His balls had swollen past grapefruits and cantaloupes. Now they were approaching the size of soccer balls, heavy as they rested on the couch. His cock was bigger, too. A lot bigger. The gigantic, fat penis had been relatively slim for some time, but just as Eric&#39;s influence caused him to gain fat, not just muscle, so did it give him a massively girthy cock, with accompanying huge balls. His cock pointed straight upwards, and reached the bottom of his round, heavy pecs. He wondered... and tried. He could barely touch his middle fingers around his cock, that&#39;s how thick it was, and he steered the cock towards his mouth, crouching his upper body. The trouble wasn&#39;t even his length, it was that his thick pecs were blocking him from reaching. With some effort, crunching his abs, he put his dick between his pecs, and reached with his mouth. It was too big for him to take in his mouth, so instead he licked and kissed the fat head, sucking on the slit. He came several times, each time further filling his stomach with his own cum, producing more. At last, he felt the swelling subside, and he removed his cock from his mouth. Kyle looked down at himself. He was... enormous.<br />
<br />
Eric was looking at Kyle, remembering just an hour ago, when he&#39;d thought that he was one of the biggest people alive, not to mention, certainly, the owner of the biggest cock in human history. When Kyle got up on his feet, the difference was clearer. &quot;Wow,&quot; rumbled Kyle, &quot;we&#39;re not that different, though.&quot; And they weren&#39;t. Kyle had been a slender, athletic boy just hours ago, but now he&#39;d packed on an incredible amount of bulk. It looked as though they were about equal in width, the shoulders of Kyle slightly thicker, Eric&#39;s biceps and triceps slightly bigger. Eric was hirsute, while Kyle almost didn&#39;t have any more body hair than when he&#39;d started. Eric had his massive gut, while Kyle had a light spare tyre. Kyle was taller, though he wasn&#39;t sure who was heavier overall. Looking at Kyle&#39;s chest, Eric had an inkling. The two huge spheres hung heavily down towards Kyle&#39;s stomach, and they jutted out nearly a foot, it looked, forming an imposing shelf of flesh. Their lower bodies were about similar, Kyle&#39;s ass being more perky and toned, Eric&#39;s being wider and bigger, while their thighs and calves were the same. <br />
<br />
They weren&#39;t the same in the crotch, though. Kyle gestured towards the tape. &quot;Do, uh, do you wanna do it?&quot; He seemed unsure. Right now, he was flaccid, and the fat sausage reached over halfway down his thigh, pushed out by his balls, each having subsided from their orgasmic state, to a more manageable size - if cantaloupes could be called manageable. Eric was painfully erect, and he suddenly became self-aware. &quot;Uh, sure. I could, uh, well, y&#39;know...&quot; Eric was hesitant, but Kyle seemed to understand. Apparently the euphoria that was spurred from his growth had passed, and he, too, was more self-aware. &quot;Yeah, I mean, we&#39;ve already seen each other cum, so, well...&quot; <br />
<br />
Having measured himself, Eric started with those results. &quot;Okay, I am, right now, fourteen inches long, and eleven around.&quot; Kyle whistled softly. &quot;That&#39;s a big steak you&#39;ve got there, bro.&quot; Kyle seized his cock and began stroking it, quickly hardening. His cock reached to his pecs, standing up. &quot;Yeah,&quot; Eric said softly, &quot;but I think you&#39;ll find yourself blown away right now.&quot; He smiled to himself. &quot;And not just because you just blew yourself, either.&quot; Kyle snorted, this was more like they used to be. Fun banter, teasing each other and stuff.<br />
<br />
He felt Eric&#39;s fingers touch his cock, and tensed. &quot;You okay?&quot; Eric&#39;s gravelly voice asked. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine,&quot; Kyle responded. &quot;Just need to think about Ms. Carson, then you can go nuts.&quot; He did a few quick strokes, thinking about the delicious-looking tits of their English teacher. Eric was quiet for a few seconds. &quot;Whadd&#39;ya find out?&quot; Kyle asked. He felt the need to cum. Eric cleared his throat. &quot;Uhrrm, uh, wow. Just wow. Dud- bro, your cock is nineteen and a half inches long,&quot; Kyle became, if possible, even harder, and he felt his balls rise and swell, &quot;and around, you&#39;re thirteen and a half. That&#39;s thicker than a soda bott-&quot; Eric was interrupted by Kyle orgasming hard and heavy into his face. Opening his mouth, Eric took a good gallon of thick semen, further filling his stomach. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Kyle panted, his erection finally going down, &quot;I couldn&#39;t hold it any longer. I&#39;ve... I&#39;ve got an almost twenty inches long cock.&quot; He smiled, and sat back down in the couch, panting. &quot;Holy shit!&quot; he kept saying. <br />
<br />
There was a knock on the door...</p>
