<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! <br />
<br />
Carina stopped running madly around her room when she heard someone knock on the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Carina! Are you all-right?” A sweet soft but concerned voice came out from the corridor. &quot;Several weird noises coming from your room woke me up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carina immediately recognized that voice (plus, her long new ears made it easier for her to recognize any sound). It was her friend Francesca, a beautiful young, well-behaved, studious and hard-working girl whom Carina had persistently persuaded to come to Pleasure Island.<br />
<br />
However, there was no response. Carina remained speechless, motionless, staring at the door without knowing what to say. What was she going to say? That she was sick? That she was turning into an animal? What if now only brays were coming out of her mouth?<br />
<br />
Francesca knocked the door and tried again, &quot;Carina, what happened? Can I help?”.<br />
<br />
Full of fear and shame, Carina plucked up the courage and responded. &quot;Oh Francy! Help me! I... I can&#39;t stand up.&quot; <br />
<br />
Francesca opened the door. Immediately she discovered a messy room filled with strange shadows caused by the weak candle flame that was in the back of the room. Sheets, plush toys, and ornaments had been thrown on the floor as if a whirlpool had passed; even a little table holding sweets, cupcakes and pieces of pie had been knocked over, dropped and with pieces of smashed plates around. With trepidation, Francesca entered but she decided to stand near of the doorway. <br />
<br />
And that&#39;s when Francesca saw Carina on the floor, on all fours, with her hips lifted towards the ceiling and with two long, droppy and furry ears coming out of her red waterfall hairstyle. Carina had her head down and her gaze lowered in shame. <br />
<br />
&quot;Carina...?! What’s going on here?!&quot; Francesca was astonished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Francy, please help me! There is something very bad happening to me.&quot; Carina begged still looking at the floor and shedding tears. &quot;I think ... I think ... I think I&#39;m turning into an animal!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Francesca asked with an incredulous look. &quot;Did you say an animal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. I woke up ... and couldn&#39;t stand up. I fell to the floor ... and ... and ... and ... Heee hawww! Heeee hawwww! Heeee hawwwww! Heeeee ...&quot; Carina brayed in a voice that was still mostly human, closing tightly her eyes at each bray.<br />
<br />
Faced with that event, Carina immediately flattened herself on the floor and covered her face with her arms to stop emitting that sound from her mouth. She was horribly embarrassed.<br />
<br />
But Francesca started to giggle, thinking that Carina was joking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! What was that?&quot; asked playfully Francesca when Carina stopped braying.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH BOO HOO HOO! Francy, I&#39;m turning into a donkey!&quot; Carina wailed with her face lying down. &quot;Get me out of here! Don&#39;t let me be an ass!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then there was a brief moment of silence in the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pfft! HA HA HA HA!&quot; Francesca tried but failed to hold in her laughter. &quot;Nice try, Carina. But I&#39;m not falling for something as silly as that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Carina, still lying on the floor, was surprised by Francesca&#39;s reaction. She began to stop hiding her face behind her arms and peeked through them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you’re pulling my leg again, Carina. Look, I know you&#39;ve always liked to make jokes and pranks to make us laugh, but wake me up to see that charade? Really? Believing you are a donkey? HA HA! Better come back go to sleep...  and take off those ears! &quot; Francesca said as she pulled on one of Carina’s long ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;OUCH! Don&#39;t do that! That hurts!&quot; Carina screamed, squeezing her eyes in pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah right! Sure! Like you suddenly grew a pair of donkey ears&quot;. Francesca said jokingly without believing her friend.<br />
<br />
Francesca was about to leave the room when Carina surprisingly jumped up and climbed up in Francesca&#39;s face so she wouldn&#39;t leave her alone, with her hooves on her chest, totally overwhelming Francesca.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen to me well! I&#39;m not ... AAAAH!&quot; Suddenly, Carina&#39;s blood ran cold and she gave a loud cry. She fell backward to get away of Francesca. Shocked and astonished, Carina stared at Francesca with open mouth and wide eyes, seeing the scariest thing she had seen in her short life.<br />
<br />
The dim light in the room and her constant whimpering hadn&#39;t allowed Carina to see Francesca&#39;s face until she approached her. Carina analyzed her while the innocent Francesca was completely unaware of what was happening to herself.<br />
<br />
It was an unbelievable sight. Francesca, the best student in her class, now possessed the head of a little young donkey!  And not only her head had been turned into a donkey’s, her beautiful green eyes were replaced by the dark eyes of an animal that looked like two black pebbles. Her ears had grown significantly, now sticking nearly a foot above her head and covered in soft dark grey hair with black ear rims. Her small human front teeth had turned into massive donkey front teeth, perfect for grazing. And her pretty face was now a furry but still short equine snout. From her head she only kept her midback-length ginger bohemian side braid which was tucked behind her long ears, that made Francesca&#39;s braid not touch them and therefore she did not notice the change in her ears yet.<br />
<br />
It was too bizarre for Carina to see a donkey with a gorgeous girl hairstyle, on two legs, wearing a long dark blue dress and talking like her friend Francesca.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s gotten into you, Carina?&quot;, asked  the donkey-headed girl completely bewildered. Carina was about to answer when she saw a dark brown furry tassel swinging like a slow pendulum under Francesca&#39;s skirt, behind her calves. She had already grown a tail too!<br />
<br />
Carina gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my godness! Francy ... YOU&#39;RE A DONKEY!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Are you out of your mind?&quot;, Francesca was offended, unaware of her tail was now swishing from side to side of her long skirt like a clapper inside a bell. &quot;If you want to consider yourself an ass, that’s you. But I&#39;m not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Francy I&#39;m serious. We have to seek help before we get worse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on! Me? An ass?&quot; Francesca continued still blissfully unaware of her altered appearance. &quot;The girl who gets the best grades in school? Actually, that&#39;s fun, Carina. Ha ha ha ha!&quot; <br />
<br />
Francesca cracked up showing her now big set of teeth, Carina got up from the floor on all fours without knowing what to say to the disbelief of her friend. Francesca continued teasing Carina. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now that I remember, you were the girl that the teacher punished the most by standing in the corner of the classroom. Why? Because you never answered one of her questions well... you always were fooling around during class! Ha ha ha! Who is it the real ass now? Ha ha ha haw haw HAW? HAW! HAW! HAW! HEEEEEEEEEEEEEE HAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!” <br />
<br />
Francesca’s girlish laugh devolved into the noisy sound that a donkey foal commonly used to call out to its mother. Her eyes widen and she quickly slapped her hands over her mouth at that unnatural sound, Francesca’s shock multiplied when her hands came in contact with leathery lips that stuck out much further than they should have.<br />
<br />
“C-C-Carina? D-d-did I just… did that s-sound… co-come out… of me?” Francesca asked Carina, who timidly nodded. “No… I-I couldn&#39;t… I couldn&#39;t m-make that… that s-sound… impossible…I… I…” <br />
<br />
Still trying to grasp what was happening, Francesca returned her hands to her face, once again inspecting the leathery tip of her new snout, complete with massive, flaring nostrils instead of her little nose.  At the same, time, Francesca probed her tongue throughout the inside of her mouth, noting the unsettling feeling of larger, blockier teeth now perfect for grazing. Shifting her hands further away from her mouth, Francesca was in dismay to feel soft fur covering the rest of her face, the shape of which was just as striking. Migrating further up her newly changed cranium, Francesca finally grabbed her new twitching donkey ears, running her fingers up their entire length, eventually pulling in a futile attempt to remove them. <br />
<br />
While Francesca was examining her head, she had been instinctively stepping backwards until she backed up into a side of the door jamb. However it wasn’t her rear which came in contact with the door jamb, it was her tail. <br />
<br />
“Eeeeek!” Francesca squealed startling at the foreign sensation.<br />
<br />
Trembling with fear, Francesca looked back at her butt and finally realized that there was something under her long skirt, hanging behind her.<br />
<br />
Francesca slowly released her ears and then she bent over, lifted her skirt from behind to reveal her bottom and turned around to find a ropey tail dangling from a torn hole in her cotton drawers (her undies), just above Francesca’s butt.<br />
<br />
Grabbing the appendage in her hands, Francesca pulled it around to her front to get a better view, gawking with eyes wide open at the grey fur and brown tassel.  The worst part was to discover that she could feel and move it.<br />
<br />
“No. No… this isn’t happening. This is… this is all just some kind of… of weird fever dream from… eating too much cake and ice cream.” Francesca nervously assured herself as she inched towards the large mirror of the room to inspect her reflection. Gazing upon her reflection confirmed Francesca’s suspicion – her head had transformed into the head of a young female donkey. <br />
<br />
“AAAAAAAAAAAAAARRGHHHHH!!!” Francesca reacted the only way she knew how, by letting out a blood-curdling scream that could be heard throughout the entire floor. “OH MY GOSH! OH MY GOSH! HELP! HELP! SOMEBODY HELP ME!” Francesca shrieked in a fit of panic as she tried to process what was happening to her. Terrified beyond her wildest dreams in her short life, Francesca was jumping and running frantically about the already messy room, looking for anyone and anything that could possibly help her unusual predicament until she caught sight of Carina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Francy! Francy, stop!&quot; Carina, who was scared and stucked in her quadrupedal stance, yelled at her hysterical friend while a tear trickled down her cheek. She had backed away until she was against the wall so Francesca wouldn&#39;t trip over her. <br />
<br />
Francesca ran to her friend as if she was seeking comfort from her own mother. <br />
<br />
“Carina! Carina, you’re right! Please! Please, help me… what&#39;ll I do? What&#39;ll I do?!” Francesca implored while she poked her new snout a couple of times with both hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you. It must be a disease or something! We should seek help ...&quot; <br />
<br />
“WAAAAAAAAAHH! This has to be a nightmare! I’m not an animal!” Francesca broke down crying uncontrollably interrupting Carina and whining about her humiliating situation. “I want my mommy! I want my mommy!! Mommyyy!! Daddyyyy!! WAAAAH!!!”<br />
<br />
“Francy, control yourself! That way you won&#39;t solve anything!” Carina demanded. “Come on, we ha-A-AAA-A-AA—AAAAHH… hawww! Haw! Haw! Haw! Haw! Haw! Heeeeee hawwww! Heeeeeeee hawwwww! Heeeeeeeeeee-heeee-heee!”<br />
<br />
Closed eye, Carina brayed impulsively at Francesca, jerking her body back and then forward as she let out each bray. Every time her brays became more animalistic and therefore less girlish.<br />
<br />
Shocked by Carina’s screeching brays, Francesca gasped covering her snout with her hands.<br />
<br />
When Carina managed to shut up, both girls looked at each other with wide eyes. There was a brief moment of silence as they breathed heavily, knowing they were suffering the same misfortune.<br />
<br />
“Oh Carina! I&#39;m scared!&quot;, said Francesca after the brief silence. &quot;Why are we turning into... into animals?” <br />
<br />
&quot;I-I-I really don&#39;t know... b-but we have to get out of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
“But.. but… but I can&#39;t go out like this! I LOOK LIKE A MONSTER!” Francesca tried to hide her asinine face from Carina by covering it with her arms. <br />
<br />
“Do you have a better idea?”, asked Carina. Of course neither of them wanted to walk into an island full of girls looking like donkeys; both girls thought they would be a laughingstock. But what else could they do? <br />
<br />
So, Francesca nodded with tears welling up in her eyes; her hairy cheeks were wet with tears. Until that moment, she began to analyze the situation a little more calmly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yes! Yes, you&#39;re right! We must find the Coachwoman or Filippo. Maybe they know what happens to us and can help us&quot;, said Francesca hopefully. &quot;I saw Filippo on the ground floor yesterday, maybe he is... &quot;<br />
<br />
But Francesca stopped talking. Suddenly, Francesca felt a strange sensation under her abdomen that, despite not being painful, forced her to bend over. She let out an undignified &quot;Eeep&quot; as she held her groin with her hands.<br />
<br />
Francesca lifted up her dress again to see that her groin and her abdomen had started to cover with dark grey fur. <br />
<br />
“Owwww... oww! What’s going on…” Francesca moaned. In a panic, she had to strip off her cotton drawers (undies) to get a better look at her body and there she discovered that patches of grey fur was growing in her pubis too.<br />
<br />
Francesca hesitantly touched the fur that covered her groin. It was then that she found that touching that fur was a bit pleasurable. Francesca couldn&#39;t stop the soft bray-like moan that escaped her throat. But it was very sensitive, so much so that she didn&#39;t even consider pulling her underwear back up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Focus, Francy!&quot;, yelled Carina as she ran out towards the door making &#39;clack&#39; noises with her four hooves. &quot;Let&#39;s get out of here. Come on!&quot;<br />
<br />
Francesca was snapped out of her trance and obeyed Carina. She pulled her skirt down and followed Carina, but Francesca was unaware that the same front grey fur was now spreading behind her, covering her buttocks and forming a kind of &#39;fur knickers&#39; on her hip that matched her tail. <br />
<br />
Carina and Francesca ran down the long, dark hallway to go down the stairs at the end. <br />
<br />
Each time Carina ran better on all fours, and that was because her arms slightly lengthened until they had the height of her legs. Carina realized that but she did not give importance since she could now move better and without her hip pointing towards the ceiling. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Francesca was pulling at the collar of her dress with a finger because she was feeling too warm. She was finding now her clothes confining and uncomfortable, even Francesca considered taking her dress and chemise off right there like she had done with her undies in Carina’s room. Without noticing, Francesca was losing her feelings of modesty and shame. <br />
<br />
The girls were about to reach the stairs when the door to the room before them burst open causing Carina and Francesca to stop in surprise. They were about to look into the room when they heard a familiar voice:<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha ha ha! You are extraordinary! Ha ha! You were still in bed and you were already braying and even chewing up the pillow stuffing. That&#39;s no pasture, darling. Ha ha ha ha!&quot;<br />
<br />
A man was leaving the room with an oil lamp in his hand while with the other hand he held a rope that was pulling something inside the room and he did not lose sight of it, so he didn&#39;t notice the presence of Carina and Francesca in the corridor. That man was Filippo. <br />
<br />
Scared, Carina and Francesca hid against the wall in silent. The darkness of the corridor helped them to go unnoticed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at yourself, you don&#39;t have any change! The good thing is that you are docile, it was not difficult to catch you&quot;, continued Filippo while he was pulling the rope to get a little girl who was crawling out of the room. That girl had a rope tightly tied around her neck and was dragging her white dress but she didn&#39;t seem to care, her big amber eyes were staring at the hallway runner rug.<br />
<br />
But when the girl stopped at the man&#39;s feet, she looked up at Filippo dumbly. She stared calmly towards him as Filippo began petting her head. That made her head itch so the child shook her head from side to side exactly like an equine animal would and finally she gave a soft snort. <br />
<br />
Carina and Francesca recognized immediately that girl: it was Noemi, who was very quiet now compared to what she used to be. She was behaving  like a meek donkey, her mind seemed to have transformed into that of a unthinking beast.<br />
<br />
Atonished, Carina and Francesca were speechless, there they had discovered that the island was a trap and Filippo was involved in it. <br />
<br />
&quot;OK, donkey girl. I&#39;ll tie you to a post out there and then return to this floor to find your friends who I heard braying perfectly like you,&quot; Filippo said softly as he pulled Noemi. Without resisting, she followed him crawling and they both went down the stairs. Carina and Francesca saw that they were leaving them behind and the light from Filippo&#39;s lamp faded away.<br />
<br />
But as Filippo and Noemi was walking down the stairs, Carina y Francesca saw something odd on Noemi&#39;s dress. A bulge started to poke out just above her behind. Then a small tuft of hair ripped out and started to stick out of the skirt of her dress. <br />
<br />
&#39;What the...?&#39; Francesca thought.<br />
<br />
The tuft of hair crawled further out of the dress, it seemed like it was attached to a dark brown furred rope like that was becoming longer and longer. Carina y Francesca had realized what it was, a long brown donkey tail with a tasseled tip had ripped a hole in Noemi&#39;s bloomers and white dress. It began to lift itself up and flick around.<br />
<br />
When Filippo and Noemi disappeared, the two girls looked at each other panicked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my godness! So he is in on this whole thing, he did this to us! And he&#39;s coming back for us!&quot; screamed Francesca in horror. <br />
<br />
&quot;Poor Noemi ... And why didn&#39;t she say anything? She acted like a ... like a real donkey,&quot; Carina said hysterically. <br />
<br />
&quot;What if that happens to us?&quot; Their eyes widened and their new ears drooped down imagining that possibility. Francesca started to panic even more. &quot;No .. NO ... NO! This isn&#39;t happening!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Owww ... what are we going to do? What are we going to do? I don&#39;t want to be or behave like an ass. Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo!&quot; Carina broke down crying again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither do I. B-but we have to find another way out so Filippo doesn&#39;t see us,&quot; Francesca said trying to calm herself down. &quot;I know! We can go out through the window of my room, it’s big and surely nobody will see us.&quot; <br />
<br />
Francesca ran as Carina followed her toward Francesca&#39;s room.</p>
