<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
The diner was fairly empty for a Saturday night. The four enter the diner, and see only a handful of other couples eating, or truckers passing time watching TV. They each ordered a soda and appetizers. <br />
<br />
“So, what’s up with you two? I thought you were on house arrest Spencer?” Ben asks, sipping his Cola. <br />
<br />
“My dad was feeling generous today. And my mom and grandpa put him in his place earlier.” she said. <br />
<br />
“What’s he like, your grandfather?” Eric asks. <br />
<br />
“All in all, he’s okay. He’s just a cranky 298 year old werewolf who spends the rest of his lonely days smoking cigars, drinking whiskey and watching ESPN.” Spencer shrugged.<br />
<br />
“Sounds like a good life.” Alex said, meaning every word. He hoped he’d live to see the day he could do nothing but relax. As much as he wanted to become a doctor, he wanted to retire in luxury even more. Champagne tastes, as his father said. <br />
<br />
“How old are your parents?” Eric asked, having forgotten that weres live much longer than humans. It was something to think about, the fact that his parents, Nate, and eventually himself would live to see a new century. Several new centuries. <br />
<br />
“Mom’s in her late forties, Dad in his early fifties. Don’t worry, I’m still fifteen. They waited until the 90s to have me.” Spencer says. <br />
<br />
“Wouldn’t matter that much to me, if you’re fifteen or fifty. Though that would be kinda weird.” Eric said. The two laugh, and for a moment just stare at each other. Ben and Alex both have the same question biting at their tongues. But they decide to wait until after Spencer leaves to ask it. They let the two have their moment, knowing they’ve had their fair share of moments. <br />
<br />
“So, do you two have any plans for tomorrow? More football practice?” Eric asks after breaking the gaze between himself and Spencer. <br />
<br />
“No, we get most Sundays off. Just going to spend the day doing chores. Alex and his parents are going up to Kent see some relatives.”  Ben said.<br />
<br />
“My father’s brother’s family. We go to my mom’s for the holidays,” Alex clarified, “but what about you, what are your plans?” <br />
<br />
“Boring stuff, like Ben.” Eric said. <br />
<br />
“Oh come on, it can’t be that boring.” Alex said. <br />
<br />
Truthfully, Eric didn’t think his plans were boring, but wasn’t eager to share them. It was a little embarrassing, spending his entire day with his mom cooking. Of course Eric had no way of knowing Ben planned on doing the very same thing. They were both fairly good at cooking. Granted nothing spectacular, but they wouldn’t go hungry when they moved out. <br />
<br />
“Ya, it kinda is. Very boring.” Eric mutters. <br />
<br />
“And you Spencer?” Ben turned to her next. <br />
<br />
“Well, it’s only boring if you don’t have interest in motorcycles.” she said. <br />
<br />
“Are you kidding? I’ve been studying the driver’s ed manual since I was ten. I’m taking the test in the spring.” Alex announced. <br />
<br />
“Have you actually ridden a motorcycle?” Ben asked, knowing Alex’s parents only owned the two cars, and a moped. <br />
<br />
“I’ve sat on my uncle’s.” Alex said, blushing. <br />
<br />
“So that’s a big, fat NO.” Ben snickers. Alex blushes even more. His parents weren’t exactly thrilled to learn their son wanted to learn how to ride motorcycles. His father worked at a race track. He knew how dangerous cars where, let along motorcycles. <br />
<br />
“If you’re serious, I could teach you.” Spencer offers.<br />
<br />
“You know how to ride?” All three boys ask at the same time. Now Spencer’s blushing.<br />
<br />
“My dad likes to rebuild motorcycles and cars. He figured teaching me would be better than my sneaking into the garage at night and backing into a wall.” she said. <br />
<br />
“He wouldn’t mind?” Alex asked eagerly.<br />
<br />
“He’s always happy to meet another enthusiast. Usually it’s just me, him, and Uncle Jon. I’ll run it by him, but he’ll probably say yes. You’re welcome to come to Eric. If you’re up for it.” Spencer wasn’t sure if Eric was the “mechanical” sort of guy. Nate struck her as the car enthusiast of the Andersons. <br />
<br />
“I’m doing some stuff with my mom in the morning, but I could come over in the afternoon.” In response Spencer leans over and kisses Eric’s cheek. There’s another brief moment had between the two. This time Ben breaks the silence. <br />
<br />
“If you don’t mind my asking, what’s with the fancy get-up?” Ben asked, pointing to Spencer’s dress with a french fry. She shrugs in response.<br />
<br />
“Just an excuse to get dressed up really. I’ve never gone to a dance or anything. The last really ‘fancy’ event I went to was a stupid father-daughter dance at the Naval base like two years ago.” <br />
<br />
“Seriously, you’ve never been to any kind of high school dance?” Eric asked in disbelief. <br />
<br />
“Nope. Banned twice, kicked out four times, and grounded for another.” Spencer said, almost proud of her accomplishments. Dances weren’t her thing, but it was better than spending the evening at home with her father, who would complain that she didn’t socialize enough. <br />
<br />
“Geez. Guess that prank with Polk was just the tip of the iceberg.” Alex laughed.<br />
<br />
“A very large iceberg. Like the kind that sunk the Titanic.” <br />
<br />
“That big?” <br />
<br />
“More or less.. Would you believe me if I told you I recreated the prom scene from ‘Carrie’? I mean, without the blood of course. Just corn syrup, cornstarch, red food coloring, and a lot of buckets. And I dumped it on a group of teachers, not some poor girl.” Spencer smiles sheepishly. <br />
<br />
The boys have to laugh at that. Ben comments that at least her school dances were more eventful than theirs. Eric too, but mostly because he’s never gone to one. He never had any interest in going. And more to a point, couldn’t get a date. Until now. <br />
<br />
“So, does that mean you wouldn’t be willing to go with me to a dance?” Eric asked softly. <br />
<br />
“Depends. Is this an invitation, or a hypothetical?”<br />
<br />
“More hypothetical since freshman don’t have any dances besides homecoming. And that was a month ago.” Eric said. He’d taken Julie, and despite initial concerns had a really good time. That all seems like a past life now. <br />
<br />
“Sophomores get a winter formal though.” Alex said, looking at Spencer.<br />
<br />
“Not exactly a sophomore,” she said, “I’m smart enough to take junior classes, but technically I’m just a freshman. Given my, uh, track record…” <br />
<br />
“Meaning?” Eric asked. <br />
<br />
“You have to be smart, and behave yourself in order to join the smart kid club.” Spencer said. Not that it bothered her much. She hated it when people assumed that, just because she’d inherited her mother’s brains, she was on the fast track to becoming a doctor, lawyer, politician or something equally boring. <br />
<br />
“So you’re a freshman?” Eric asked.<br />
<br />
“I like to think I’m more of a fresh-more.” Spencer said with a smile. <br />
<br />
“That doesn’t sound cheesy,” Ben laughed. Spencer picked up a fry and very skillfully flicked it into his hair. Eric and Alex laughed, until Ben threw two fries at each of them. And so began a small food fight, which ended after Alex got a fry covered in ketchup on his forehead. Ben was more than happy to remove it, and then lick the ketchup from his head. That sent veritable chills down both their spines. Eric, meanwhile, was picking a fry from his shirt. He looked down to find it, and saw Spencer leaning forward to pick up something from the floor. <br />
<br />
And then all three boys were left with uncomfortable erections. Spencer wasn’t oblivious, but she pretended to be for their sake. She found the situation rather amusing, but didn’t want to embarrass the guys anymore than they already were. The four split the check, and made their way back towards the Anderson and Twist homes.</p>
