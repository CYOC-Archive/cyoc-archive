<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Andersons and Hales quietly made their way back toward their home from the sheltered grove that the Hales had lead them to the night before. As they did so, and before the morning light rose over the eastern horizon, Martha smiled held onto William&#39;s arm. Things had progressed so well and Moon Lake did become the new start for them after everything. Obviously it wasn&#39;t what either of them had expected or initially wanted, but Martha knew she would never go back even if she could. She felt truly secure in her marriage, which was something she hadn&#39;t really felt in a long time and she felt comfortable in her sexuality, which she&#39;d really never been before.<br />
<br />
Paying little attention to the rising sun and the brightening sky, William could only smile back as he looked down his vulpine muzzle to see Martha&#39;s brown furry feline head resting on his shoulder. Like his wife, he wouldn&#39;t go back to being a normal human even if he could, and there were a few things about being a werefox that privately made him happy Yvette had clawed him. His life/mate bond to Martha had reinforced the decision to work to save his marriage in Minnesota and a werefox&#39;s instinctive knowledge on how to pleasure Martha to levels they had NEVER attained before their respective transformations was not only helpful but great fun.<br />
<br />
As Martha smiled back to him as they walked along, William knew that things had progressed even further. When William had offered Martha an open marriage and the freedom to indulge and enjoy her full sexuality, it had been to make her happy and help her feel complete while also allowing Martha to &quot;get even&quot; for his past mistakes. He also came to see some of the special love that went between Martha, Samantha, and Frances. It wasn&#39;t something that would ruin Martha&#39;s marriage to William or Samantha and Frances&#39; love for each other, but it was something was in its own way beautiful that made Martha happy. It made for his wife&#39;s happiness and that was William&#39;s foremost desire. Yet, after their day and night of hot sex with the Hales, Martha had told him that she would share her women with him if they were also bi and the circumstances allowed for it and that they were moving into a true open marriage for both sides, so long as they returned to each other&#39;s side and their love undiminished. And as William looked into Martha&#39;s eyes, he could see her strong love for him in them. They kept their focus on each other, smiling as they walked toward their home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... the two of you showed us a very lovely time,&quot; Dawn said to them as they reached the back door and William reached out with one arm to open it.<br />
<br />
The comment made William jump a bit, as he had been so lost in Martha&#39;s green feline eyes that he&#39;d actually forgotten the Hales were with them. He then looked up to them to see Dawn and Douglass standing much the way he and Martha were standing. Douglass, a werefox based on the silver phase of the Red Fox, stood beside Dawn, a werefox based on the standard red phase of the Red Fox and both looked as happy and loving as William and Martha did.<br />
<br />
&quot;We do our best,&quot; Martha smiled and squeezed William&#39;s hand, &quot;it&#39;s good to make new friends here in our new home... and you showed us something truly beautiful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And woods were beautiful, too,&quot; Dawn smiled and gave her breasts a squeeze.<br />
<br />
&quot;That too,&quot; William and Martha both managed a laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;A shame we can&#39;t do more today,&quot; Dawn gave a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Preparing for the week, I take it?&quot; Martha inquired, remembering that she did a lot of her planning for school during the weekend when she was still teaching, and knew that she would be doing the same again once she got her certificate to teach in Washington State and Moon Lake specifically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Dawn gave a smile, &quot;and since we all enjoyed a day of fun yesterday, I&#39;ll still have some lesson planning to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
William and Martha nodded. William figured he&#39;d need some time to go over his lectures for the next week as well. Martha felt a slight bit of relief, as while Douglass didn&#39;t taste bad, she still felt that William as all the man she needed and wasn&#39;t fully sure she was ready to switch partners, even if she was willing to share girlfriends with William.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s perfectly fine,&quot; William said to Dawn and Douglass as they all climbed the stairs so that Douglass and Dawn could to recover their clothes.  &quot;We&#39;ll have to do it again sometime.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Dawn and Douglass both agreed.<br />
<br />
As they reached the bedroom, the four of them began to transform back to their human forms. Their fur receded back inside their skin while their claws shrank back and rounded and flat finger and toe nails. Their tails pulled back inside them while their ears rounded and slid back down to the sides of their heads. Their feet shortened down and they took the more plantigrade stance that normal humans had rather than the digitigrade stance of their were-forms. As they returned to their human forms, William and Martha stood by each other as their guests from the previous day dressed themselves and prepared to make their way home, neither feeling much in the way of shame at the fact that they were naked. William&#39;s member hung flaccid between his legs, but was easily bigger than what he&#39;d been before and likely bigger than what most other men were while Martha&#39;s E cup bosom stood firm and proud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about issues with your certification,&quot; Dawn said to Martha once the werevixen was fully dressed, &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll do fine and I&#39;m sure the district superintendent or one of the school principals will call you to do some subbing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be another vote of confidence,&quot; Martha smiled and then hugged Dawn, &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two then lead Douglass and Dawn back downstairs to lead them back to the front door and see them on their way in a friendly way. They reached the door for the pair of werefoxes, though doing the best to make sure their nudity wasn&#39;t clearly revealed to of their neighbors.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was fun,&quot; Dawn said to Martha.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure the four of us will get time for some more in time,&quot; Martha commented, &quot;even if it&#39;s just you and me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Dawn smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re both glad you&#39;ve come to accept being a were and a werefox,&quot; Douglass said to William.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve found reasons to love it,&quot; William answered while wrapping an arm around Martha.<br />
<br />
&quot;May your bond always be strong!&quot; Douglass and Dawn smiled and made their way out, waiving good bye as they did so.<br />
<br />
William and Martha waived back and then shut the door. With her husband&#39;s arm still around her, Martha lead her husband back upstairs with the intent to shower and get cleaned up. They&#39;d figure out what to do from there. Before the weekend, Martha had hoped to get William to Awareness and its section for males, so that he could get at least some clothing that would not only fit the new him better, but would be able to shift with him when he transformed. That, however, was lost when they hosted Dawn and Douglass for yesterday&#39;s sexual adventures as its hours were shorter on Saturdays and the shop was closed on Sundays. Regardless of that, there were plenty of things to do and having Dawn and Douglass visit was quite pleasurable.</p>
