<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Madam Serenity's curse, though she didn't know it, also gave her immunity to cancer, since <br />
this too was a form of transformation. <br />
<br />
When Serenity returned to the church, she thought if she'd want to go back to having the <br />
body she had before now... after all these decades. And firmly decided, 'After going <br />
through the tears, pain, and misery of getting myself back together when my DNA was <br />
screwed with ONCE, you couldn't PAY ME to go through all that again!!' <br />
<br />
Serenity spent the rest of the evening helping the brothers to make enough of the cure so <br />
they'd reach their quota within a week's time. Though she did go over mentally what she <br />
wanted to say to the mayor the next morning. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the cascade of the leoman transformation continued to spread via the bounds <br />
of Love Between Partners, Love Between Family, and Love Between Friends...  Of course, <br />
Madam Serenity had to always remain human, so there would be always at least one line of <br />
humanity left in the history of the world. <br />
<br />
 Of course, the Wyes and the Waynes didn't have this power, haven't been born from <br />
Penny's power to restore object victims of the game rather than as part of the case cascade. <br />
Of course this meant there had to be a logical reason for them to be Leomans, and so the <br />
transformation began the slow reverse down their blood lines into the past. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;And the fairies were left to themselves to debate and discuss weather Marie Cruz was <br />
right, or weather Linus Sure was right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maddex said, &quot;Of course we all know what their verdict was.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll get to that.&quot; Marie-Eliza rose her paw for silence. &quot;But a lot can happen in an hour. <br />
And everyone involved had their own thoughts on things.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
1689 August <br />
<br />
Linus Sure looked at where his hands used to be. He didn't feel sadness or dread, only a <br />
powerful frustration! All his hard work, all his experience, much of it rendered useless! 'I <br />
almost might as well have remained a naked armless woman statue!' Linus Sure thought of <br />
embracing that suicide, of embracing that simple, blissful existence of being just artwork <br />
to be simply admired and looked at, no other purpose. But his sense of duty would not <br />
allow that, he would not be a muted nothing!  And he would not grant these witches <br />
another mark on their trophy scores! <br />
<br />
Linus Sure looked at the chairs, nicknacks, pitchers, art, and other things in the witches' <br />
house hold... and wonder how many of them had been people, reduced to nothing more <br />
than material objects that happened to have souls with no clue they had been anything <br />
different or still remembered and were silently screaming. One was murder, one was Hell. <br />
<br />
He looked at a smiling monkey statue, and wondered if it was screaming inside, had no <br />
mind, or thinking repetitive perky tripe. And the soul of the grandmother's killer continued <br />
to experience what could be for him best described as Heaven. <br />
<br />
'I only worry those fairies aren't going to be unbiased as they say and are going to declare <br />
the witches not guilty out of loyalty for being their creations or sympathy for being <br />
creatures of magic as well.' <br />
<br />
In their privacy as the jury discussed, Hermia the fairy thought to ask, &quot;Do you think it's <br />
true? That were once humans?&quot; <br />
<br />
Gruoch the fairy answered first, and the others consented, &quot;It doesn't matter. This is the life <br />
I have now. This is the life I remember. This is the life I am living. And this is the only life I <br />
want. If what the human said is true I don't know if my life is better or worse than the one I <br />
had before if what the human said was true. We do not know if it is true or not. Do any of <br />
you want to be human?&quot;<br />
<br />
They all shook their heads. <br />
<br />
&quot;Neither do I. We are with our families, that is what matters... and it does NOT relate to <br />
weather the witches are guilty or innocent of what they have been charged with.&quot; <br />
<br />
Hermia nodded as did the other fairies. <br />
<br />
Sister Kathrine looked in a mirror. And remembered her short time before Maria had struck <br />
down the witches' power and restored her, Draco, and Linus to normal from what they had <br />
been while they bought time. Sister Kathrine shivered remembering the sweet purity and <br />
innocence of being a child again among the familiars, of seeing the world in much simpler <br />
and peaceful terms. She could be perky and happy and not be pretending. She could have <br />
friends who didn't judge her. <br />
<br />
How easy it would be to just have accepted that paradise and let everything else go.  'I <br />
wonder if that is a form of paradise... but if it is... the witches aren't the ones to bring it <br />
about... ' Sister Kathrine thought of those the witches had made into minions, protectors, <br />
slaves, objects, all in the name of tearing down oppression and bringing them happiness... <br />
'They aren't the ones to bring it about... I doubt any mortal is the one to bring it about... <br />
only the Lord is the one fit to bring it about.' <br />
<br />
Father Draco Fire sitting with Marie Cruz unlike Linus and Kathrine shivered with absolute <br />
disgust at the memory of being made a feral dragon with the attitude and brain of a puppy! <br />
Reduced to the mentality of a loyal pet! It disgusted him, being reduced to nothing more <br />
than animal! The witches had given him a DISEASE among dragons! The dragons of legend <br />
who never stopped growing, went on all four like the animals they could no better reason <br />
as, and sought the flesh of that of Man. Yes, there was a very good reason like Father <br />
Draco Fire had no desire now or ever to discuss what the familiar had turned him into. <br />
<br />
'Forced Salvation is no Salvation at all... ' Was all he thought of the witches her wish to be <br />
queens of the world even if in their madness they didn't recognize that was precisely <br />
they'd become even as they shouted they wanted only a world that was flawlessly fair and <br />
perfectly equal. <br />
<br />
Sister Marie Cruz merely looked at the Witch Pride, Child familiars, and the human <br />
retainers who served the witches, most as far as they were concerned of their own free will. <br />
Their unconscious bodies organized and categorized as best they could be. 'Will killing the <br />
witches really wake them up? Or will that kill them utterly? Are we just telling ourselves <br />
they'll wake up so we don't have to think that killing them wouldn't have any price that will <br />
be paid by anyone but them? Will killing the three of them just doom their creations to <br />
sleeping forever? Are the witches the only ones who can actually wake them up? ... I'm <br />
sorry you had to become a killer like me Kathrine, I'm just so sorry... ' Marie Cruz looked at <br />
her hands, clean, but with little scars, she thought of the criminals, spies, assassins, <br />
monsters, horrors, abominations, and other dangerous things that went bump in the night <br />
she had killed over the years and how many had ben before being made pawns had been <br />
innocent people who had been in the wrong place at the wrong time... Maybe at the end, <br />
I'm a thing of the dark that belongs stalking the shadows as much as they do... ' <br />
<br />
Dr. Azrael merely stood observing. Of course he was several places at once, in fact, he was <br />
many, many place at once, whenever a creature that had a soul, sapient or not, he came <br />
when their fate had run it's course. The world didn't stop for this trial. A war was still be <br />
waged. People were still dying, killing each other, some calling out for him to end their <br />
misery, others screaming for him to visit their enemies so they themselves might go home <br />
and return to their loved ones.  These three witches of course would face a completely <br />
different judgement when the time came for their death. And that judgement would be <br />
final and decisive, each of them individually judged. <br />
<br />
&quot;What shall we do with their familiars?&quot; Father Draco Fire asked Linus and Marie even as the <br />
two were on opposite sides in the current decision. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing.&quot; Marie Cruz said simply, &quot;With the witches dead, their familiars will have no <br />
power. A familiar's power come from their master. They'll be but stupid, mindless, <br />
mundane beasts again.&quot; <br />
<br />
Linus looked at Marie Cruz, rather vexed she'd over speak him when his experience in <br />
such matters out stripped hers. <br />
<br />
Father Draco Fire asked, &quot;Then why did you go to all the trouble of talking of the children?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie Cruz, &quot;Because from what I understand, you aren't supposed to use something that's <br />
already a person, already self aware, and not a dumb animal, as a familiar, otherwise they <br />
develop and grow magic on their own... or that's what I've been able to dredge up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Linus said nothing for the moment. <br />
<br />
Herodias also known as Princess in her early years by her master, thought of her sons, <br />
daughters, and their litters, and their litters litters... she had become quite famous among <br />
them... but animals could smell death. And Herodias smelled it on the thing claiming to be <br />
human and claiming to be a doctor. And Herodias knew none of her family would dare <br />
come within a mile of this place as long as the so called Doctor remained. She didn't <br />
mention this to her master... least it upset her...  'Damn you Marie Cruz, you were <br />
supposed to be one of us. There were supposed to be four witches! Not three! How did this <br />
happen?' <br />
<br />
Lilith thought of Lucky, or rather Solome... at least that damn dog got what was coming to <br />
him! Her one hope was if the fairies proved to be idiots like Lilith suspected they were was <br />
that a great and terrible revenge would befall her master's that of her master! <br />
<br />
Gaal thought of where she had led her sisters... her only regret was that she had failed... if <br />
only they could have worked a little faster... be a little bit stronger, 'We were the most <br />
powerful witches to have ever existed... we were going to topple a jealous and unfair god... <br />
and we fell to a mere human with bones stolen from our own grand mother... it's not... it's <br />
not... IT'S-NOT-FAIR!!!!' <br />
<br />
Golgtha thought of what little her sixth sense could tell her through the fog of whatever it <br />
was cutting off her power from the reset of her... 'She'll pay... they'll all pay.. and our <br />
paradise WILL come about...' <br />
<br />
Gomorrah meanwhile thought of when she had been adopted into her sisters' family, her <br />
own family taken by sickness. She thought about it, and came to a very simple conclusion, <br />
'I don't regret any of it. I'd still be their sister if I could have it all over again...' <br />
<br />
Monica, Rosa were the only real adults native to Glendale currently awake and aware, even <br />
if their bodies created the illusion of them being children. They collected the children who <br />
had fallen off purple horses when the geass shattered.. the ones who had been dancing on <br />
the top of stairs. Grave digging would take time.   They had no idea that the silver twins <br />
were doing much he same thing with the pack members who had fallen where they stood <br />
when the geass had lost it's effected. The Glendale Wolves were known for only traveling <br />
into town when they wanted, the Big Bad Wolf Estate was nearly an entirely different <br />
community! <br />
<br />
Mal'Akh Bialyk on the other hand... stayed close to Armisael... there was no Army on Earth <br />
that would make her leave her sister's side, telling herself over and over her sister would <br />
perfectly sane and whole when the witches were killed and she woke up. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Was Armisael sane when she woke up?&quot; Abbey asked worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moving on.&quot; Marie-Eliza said pretending to not even hear the question. <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
Joella thought again and again of her mothers, and their fate, and wished she had a god to <br />
pray to for their safety... the witches had mocked all religions as just bowing to those more <br />
powerful than you were... 'But... my mothers are more powerful... and a lot bow to them.. <br />
and they just want to help everyone... having power, isn't bad in of itself right?' <br />
 <br />
Vatican merely escorted the girl home as was his request by Marie Cruz. <br />
<br />
Joseph Running Bear meanwhile sat in his chair, and felt the pain in his chest. 'Maybe... I <br />
won't have to see them die after all...'<br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;All hunters of course were present during the witches' hanging, and all five were struck by <br />
the game. Thus why the limit of people who can be effected by the game at once is five <br />
and anything over that causes the turn to fizzle...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What was the Transform or Dare for each of them?&quot; Lilly asked. <br />
<br />
Maddex's heads asked above his twin daughter, &quot;I assume that each of them, or at least <br />
some of them, then used the game eventually? After all, if the game had ended with them, <br />
we wouldn't have had the mess with curse!&quot; <br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza said, &quot;I'll get to that in due time. But before that, we have the Verdict to go <br />
over.&quot;</p>
