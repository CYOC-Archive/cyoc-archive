<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was 6 o' clock in the morning and Shawn was getting up for school. Shawn is about 5'11 148 pounds and is all muscle. As he got up he climbed down he's stairs. Also his cousin Gareth was getting up also for school Gareth is about 6'2 152 pounds and is all muscle. He got up and went to the bathroom to take a shower. While Shawn was getting dressed, Shawn wore a plain green footlocker tee shirt with a dirk jersey over it and wore South Pole blue jeans. Once Gareth got dressed he wore baggy black fox racing shirt, black South Pole jeans and a black fox-racing sweater. While heading to the bus stop Gareth grabbed his soccer ball and gear. While Shawn grabbed his basketball shoes to play basketball after school. Once the arrived at the bus stop the bus was just pulling up. They both got on and headed towards the back and sat next to each other’s friends.<br />
 <br />
            Once at school they went to chemistry class. IN chemistry they were mixing chemicals to make a small bomb.<br />
<br />
 Gareth: &quot;hey teach think we can make a bomb big enough to blow up a desk?&quot;<br />
Mr. Sullivan: &quot;no Gareth now quit messing around and get back to work!&quot;<br />
 Shawn: &quot;Gareth watch out!&quot;<br />
    All of a sudden Gareth got splashed by chemicals and flew back. Gareth awoke in the nurse’s office. He started to realize he felt dizzy.<br />
 Nurse: &quot;lay back down you just got shot with one of the bombs in class and you need your rest.&quot;<br />
 Gareth:” I’m fine I think ill go back to class.&quot;<br />
 Nurse: &quot;fine but if u fell anything come back here.&quot;<br />
   So Gareth went to his locker and next to him was the hottest girl in school her name was Lacy Anderson. Gareth tried not to stare, but then her jock football player boyfriend Todd Tucker appeared next to her. Gareth got mad and mumbled &quot;I wish I could trade places with Todd Tucker.&quot; all of a sudden Gareth closed his eyes and opened them and he was standing in front of Lacy.<br />
Lacy: &quot;Todd are you ok you seem off. I don't u want you to lose the game tonight!&quot;<br />
Gareth (in Todd’s body): Whoa re u talking to I’m Gareth not Todd.&quot;<br />
Lacy giggled: &quot;Todd quit joking around.&quot;<br />
 Then Gareth ran towards the bathroom and looked in the mirror. Gareth Screamed!&quot; OH MY GOD what happened to me this isn’t my body? Wait if I'm Todd then who’s me? Oh no Todd’s me!&quot; Gareth ran out of the bathroom and ran to his locker and saw Todd in Gareth’s body sitting there freaking out looking in the mirror. Gareth walked over and said &quot;Todd?&quot;<br />
Gareth (Todd):&quot;yaw GARETH WHAT DID U DO TO ME! I WANT MY BODY BACK!!&quot;<br />
Todd (Gareth): :I don’t know how I didn’t do anything I just wished I was you because you were dating lacy so I wished it and then I turned into you.&quot;<br />
Gareth:” well the games tonight and you don’t know how to play football only soccer!&quot;<br />
Todd: &quot;please I'm you look at these muscles.&quot;(Flexes huge muscles)<br />
Gareth: &quot;just change us back you don’t know how to hang out with other jocks.&quot;<br />
Todd: &quot;fine ill change us back as soon as I make out with Lacy.&quot;<br />
Gareth:” NO!&quot;<br />
Todd: &quot;fine, I wish I was my self again.&quot;<br />
   Gareth fell on top of his body inside Todd’s body. When they awoke they where back to normal. Then Gareth got an idea he was going to switch places with has cousin Shawn because Shawn always got the girl and he didn’t because Shawn was the star basketball player and soccer wasn’t one of the coolest sports at his school. So Gareth headed towards class when he got another idea &quot;imp going to switch places with my teacher Mr. Bowen, even though he’s old I'm going to have fun with this. &quot;I wish I were Mr. Bowen. Gareth felt drowsy and opened his eyes in the classroom wearing a checked button up shirt, dress pants, and Nike sneakers. Gareth also realized it worked and kids started to poor in. Gareth noticed that his body finally came in tardy. So he got a crazy idea he was going to stay his teacher for a couple days. &quot;Gareth comes here&quot;<br />
Gareth (Mr. Bowen): &quot;yes sir&quot;<br />
Mr. Bowen: &quot;step out side with me. Class read writes in your journals about what u did yester day.&quot;<br />
 So Gareth and Mr. Bowen stepped outside. And they sat down on some chairs in the hallway.<br />
Mr. Bowen: &quot;ok Mr. Bowen I know you’re inside my body and I'm going to tell you why.&quot;<br />
Gareth: &quot;Gareth your in my body?&quot;<br />
Mr. Bowen: &quot;yes I am and your beards is really itchy and you’re um. Never mind.&quot;<br />
Gareth: &quot;I know but why did you and me switch places with me?&quot;<br />
Mr. Bowen: &quot;I wished to switch places with you because I wanted to see how it felt to be you and I can change us back whenever I want.&quot;<br />
Gareth: &quot;I see so how long are you planning to stay me?&quot;<br />
Mr. Bowen: &quot;I am not sure maybe a day or two because I got plans.&quot;<br />
Gareth: what kind of plans?&quot;<br />
Mr. Bowen you well see now get to class before I give you detention.&quot;<br />
So Gareth inside Mr. Bowens body thought the class what Mr. Bowen in Gareth’s body wrote down for him. After School he saw Shawn and Gareth get on the bus. Gareth then pulled out Mr. Bowen's keys found his car got in and went to his house. When Gareth Got to his house it was a 2 story 2 acre house but it wasn’t to fancy. When he used a key to get in he walked in he went to find the bathroom. He looked and the mirror and pulled out Mr. Bowen’s wallet and saw that Mr. Bowen was 57 years old and he didn’t like Mr. Bowen’s itchy beard so he got his shaver and started to shave it off. Then went upstairs and went into his bedroom. And looked in the coolest and saw that he had a lot of dress shirts and pants. Then he found a t-shirt and a pair of jeans. Then he looked for his under wear. Then opened a drawer and saw bunch of tight whiteys. So then he grabbed a pair and socks and went back to the bathroom and undressed and got in the shower. As Gareth scrubbed Mr. Bowen’s body he heard someone come in the house and heard a female voice call &quot;sweetie are you home!&quot; then Gareth panicked and replied &quot;IN the shower baby!&quot; Then Mr. Bowen’s wife walked in the bathroom and said: sweetie you almost done I want to take a shower to. SO Gareth Turned off the shower grabbed a towel. And stared to dry off and wrapped the towel around is waist. Gareth Got out and saw Mr. Bowens wife and he thought well better make this believable.<br />
Gareth gave his wife a kiss (not really his wife but Mr. Bowens wife she thinks he is still the same old Mr. Bowen) Gareth was like well its all yours. Then he realized it was 9:00 p.m and he said he was going to bed. Gareth went back to the drawers and looked for pajama's and then he found out that Mr. Bowen slept jus in his under wear. SO Gareth put on under wear and a t-shirt and climbed into bed and fell asleep.<br />
<br />
      Gareth woke up and forgot he was still in Mr. Bowen’s body got up and went to the closet and tried to find his clothes. He looks trough everything then went to the bathroom and looked and the mirror and went &quot;I forgot I'm still Mr. Bowen&quot; Then he went back to the closet and found a shirt, grabbed dress pants and shoes. HE got dressed went down stairs grabbed keys and got in his car and drove to the school. When he got to the school he saw that Mr. Bowen in his body was dressed in suit and tie and dress shoes and was carrying a briefcase.  Gareth freaked out pulled up next to his body and told Mr. Bowen to get in. Then he ran home and made MR. Bowen change his body's clothes. Gareth made him wear his soccer uniform and use his sports bag. Then once they got to the school Gareth said, &quot;ok Mr. Bowen it was fun being you and all but your beard had to go ok and so I'm ready to switch back.&quot; Mr. Bowen: &quot;I figured you would but you know I like being young again so I don’t want to switch back.&quot;<br />
   Then Gareth said, &quot;I wish I had my body&quot;<br />
	Gareth felt drowsy and fell on the ground and so did Mr. Bowen in his body. When Gareth woke up he noticed something was wrong. Gareth Looked down and he saw his body but not his clothes. He looked in the mirror but it wasn’t his head. Gareth then started to panic but his voice came out of the body but it was Mr. Bowen’s head. Gareth then thought,  “I have my body and my voice but Mr. Bowen’s head and clothes. Gareth then saw Mr.bowen getting up wearin his clothes and his head but wrinkly skin. Gareth then said “I wish i was back to normal.” Gareth fell back o the ground. He woke up in his body and everything was back to normal. Gareth then learned he had to say it right or it would mess up again.</p>
