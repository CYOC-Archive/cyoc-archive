<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Daisuke waited calmly outside the Jenkins home while the Skulk prepared for the trap to be set the man sent after Jenny Harper and Harry Jenkins. For the moment they had no clear knowledge on who the man was or what his stated mission was, but that was purpose of the trap. This agent couldn&#39;t be truly arrested taken into custody at the moment, as beyond suspicious activity, no real crime had been committed. However, the trap was designed to get that needed information, and with the Jenkins family and Jenny taken to a more secure location, the situation was fairly clear that they would have the safety to execute the trap. After a few moments a black SUV drove up, and Daisuke was quick approach it.<br />
<br />
A door opened quickly and Daisuke could see that Ichiro was behind the wheel with Taro in the passenger seat. In the back seat, Daisuke found a lone male werefox who had worked within the Tachibana Security Services and had been trained by Akane&#39;s grandsons, Yamato, Sora, Ichiro, Yoshiro, Taro, and Daisuke. However, unlike the others, this werefox was not of Japanese descent. He had brown hair and brown eyes and looked like many other typical American men, which Daisuke and his cousins had agreed would be the best option for deceiving this agent of Dieter Wilhelm&#39;s. The man might be a brutish thug, but then he might also be quite clever and they couldn&#39;t take the risk, since the man was already parked outside the Jenkins Construction offices. Beside him was a normal woman with blonde hair, blue eyes and the closest build to what Jenny had before she became Moon Lake&#39;s newest vixen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Has he moved?&quot; Daisuke was quick to ask has he climbed into the SUV.<br />
<br />
&quot;As of the last report... no,&quot; Ichiro answered, &quot;He&#39;s remained parked where he is and has been taking pictures of people they&#39;ve gone into the construction company.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Likely trying to get an ID on Harry Jenkins, not knowing that the company is owned and run by his brother,&quot; Daisuke commented, &quot;and his sole action has been to take photographs?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ichiro began to drive away from the Jenkins home as Daisuke buckled himself in. If the agent did leave where he was parked, they didn&#39;t want to be placed where the guy would get the warning that either someone was on to him or that the Jenkins family was being watched by someone other than this mysterious agent.<br />
<br />
&quot;So far,&quot; Ichiro answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I believe we are safe to move onto the next phase,&quot; Daisuke spoke, &quot;Jenny and the Jenkins family have been safely moved, should he leave and come snooping around the Jenkins home. That&#39;ll allow us to execute our trap with relative safety.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s where we come in, right?&quot; the woman asked to Daisuke from the seat beside him.<br />
<br />
Daisuke nodded to her, &quot;So long as our target remains in front of the Jenkins Construction Offices, we&#39;ll send you both in on a bit of a fact finding mission and to lay the trap that will let him reveal his true intentions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daisuke looked both of them and began to explain the base plan to both Tachibana Security Service Agents.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will park around a corner and out of sight from this agent and will let you and Ian get out and walk along together,&quot; Daisuke spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll need to look like a couple who were very much in love with each other,&quot; Taro commented, &quot;as Harry and Jenny are bonded mates.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can manage,&quot; the woman answered while the werefox, Ian, nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
Daisuke nodded, &quot;Good. That will then let us set the trap. You&#39;re to walk together and go up to the Jenkins Construction offices, however, Ian, you&#39;re to be the only one to go into the offices.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only me?&quot; Ian asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe that the only person that he will likely want to hurt is Harry,&quot; Daisuke answered, &quot;and while he might only be taking pictures at the moment, I don&#39;t want to take the risk that he also has a gun somewhere in his vehicle. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You will go in and talk with Harry&#39;s brother,&quot; Taro instructed, &quot;let him know what is going and where Harry, Jenny, and his parents are. It might also be a good idea to urge him to be careful. We don&#39;t want Harry&#39;s brother to be killed either.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ian then nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about me?&quot; the woman asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is where we&#39;ll then lay the ultimate trap,&quot; Daisuke spoke, &quot;you&#39;re to glance and act as though you partially recognize the man or think he is lost or curious about something. You&#39;ll approach him to offer help. From there, you&#39;re to engage in some small gossip and pretend to be Jenny. Speak highly of Harry and the excitement of the coming wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can do that, but what do you hope to accomplish?&quot; the woman asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully that will entice any aggressive planning on his part,&quot; Ichiro commented, &quot;you&#39;ll then offer him a sort of &quot;carrot&quot; to exercise that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daisuke nodded in agreement, &quot;Tell him that you and &quot;Harry&quot; plan to enjoy a weekend in the normal&#39;s recreation area through the night and into tomorrow. If this man does have plots to murder Harry, he&#39;ll be drawn to it and will give our services and the Moon Lake Police the probable cause needed to arrest him for longer than basic questioning.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, you do have the recording device?&quot; Daisuke asked, &quot;in case he says anything incriminating?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Safely hidden in my bra,&quot; the woman answered, &quot;I also have a ball cap and sunglasses to make sure this guy won&#39;t realize that the woman he&#39;s talking to isn&#39;t Jenny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daisuke, Ichiro, and Taro all nodded. The agent they&#39;d selected, Selena Marshall, was pretty close to what Jenny Harper looked like before she became a werefox, but there were noted differences in her facial features, and while the agent might not know what Jenny looked like beyond a base description, they didn&#39;t want to take the full risk there, either. For, if the agent did have more info, or had a picture of Jenny on hand, he might see through the ruse they intended to pull.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you do have means of protection, should he get fresh with you?&quot; Daisuke asked, &quot;as while we will be close, it will take a while for us to move in should he be aggressive.&quot;<br />
<br />
Selena held up her purse and produced one electric taser and then one can of pepper spray.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m more than ready,&quot; Selena gave a smile, &quot;and if he gets out... thanks to all your martial arts training, I&#39;m pretty sure I can handle him in hand to hand combat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daisuke nodded, &quot;Just making sure we&#39;re prepared and have all things set.&quot;</p>
