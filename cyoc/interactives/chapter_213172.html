<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Oh, crap!” Jeff says as he is holding the towel over his new oversize, eight-and-a-half-inch behemoth with knot, wolf member. <br />
<br />
He and his mom stare at each other for a few moments before she closes the door and locks it. Jeff remembers locking the door, but then sees the spare key in one of his mother’s hands. She walks over to the desk and places the plate of food down before looking at her son again. <br />
<br />
“You know, I thought you were working on the homework was the project Susan was supposed to come over tomorrow to work with you on.” His mother says softly, “Not this. Are you okay?” <br />
<br />
Jeff couldn’t say anything, shocked by his mom’s almost understanding demeanor. Jeff was also not sure if he could even speak in his wolf form.<br />
<br />
“Was this why you didn’t want Jenny in your room? You had already start turning into a…” <br />
<br />
Jeff spoke up, finally finding his words. “Wolf? Yes….” He replies, in a low, deep voice. It sounded like his voice, but just as if he was sick and had a sore throat. <br />
<br />
Jeff’s mom nods and takes a seat on the end of his bed. She then pats next to her, signaling for him to sit down to. Jeff complies, but with the towel still covering his raging wolf boner. They sat next to each other, not speaking for a few minutes as his wolfhood slowly calms down. Jeff keeps himself covered, trying to stay modest. <br />
<br />
“You should wait for your sister to fall asleep before washing your clothes. You don’t want them to e stained by, um, well you.” She says as she leans her head on her now furry son. “I never thought of this being one of my ‘parenting moments’” She chuckled.<br />
<br />
“I would agree,” Jeff responds, “Though, I didn’t think I would be a werewolf a twenty minutes ago either.” <br />
<br />
“Did it hurt?” His mother asks. <br />
<br />
“No, it was like a bad stretch, with some pleasure parts too.” Jeff answers. <br />
<br />
“I saw that part.” His mother chuckles before taking a serious tone. “Can you change back? Are you going to be able to go to school? Have your friends over? Be with your sister?” <br />
<br />
“I haven’t tried yet; you sort of walked in on me.” Jeff replied jokingly. His mother didn’t like the joke and elbowed him in his rips. “Ouch! I will try in a bit. I do need to clean up some. I should know by morning.”<br />
<br />
His mother then stands up and leans over to her oversized son. She gives him a kiss on the head before heading to the door. “Just don’t eat your sister in her sleep.” She whispers. <br />
<br />
“Oh, you can joke?” Jeff says with a huff. <br />
<br />
“Yes,” His mother says before opening the door, “I am your mother.” <br />
<br />
As his mother leaves, he hears and sees the door lock. He takes this opportunity to stand up and walk back over to his mirror. <br />
<br />
He finishes wiping himself off before tossing the towel back over the seed covered pile of clothes. HE then looks himself over from head to paw. He was definitely taller, and not just from his feet now being long paws. His face still had some of his features to it, such as his eyes, but it also looked like a juvenal German Shepherd. Jeff guessed that was what the computer meant bay age group normal and that he would age normally as a human. He also guessed that the “Fertile” was why he essentially hosed down his clothes with his cum. <br />
<br />
Moving down his body; he sees that, even under his fur, his muscles definitely grew. While beastly, he now had the body between an athletic type and someone that is well built. He rubs his hand paw down his abbs, feeling them get tight. He thinks it is funny though, that his fur on his stomach being lighter than the rest. It makes him look more kid like. <br />
<br />
Below his waist, his new sheath and balls did stand out. With light brown fur covering them, they both match his fur on his stomach, but in no way did the blend in. Looking like a large nub with a massive sack underneath, his sheath and balls protruded from his body greatly. His balls themselves just dangled between his legs, being the size of small oranges. <br />
<br />
Jeff moves his paw down to his sheath and finds the opening to his new penis. He figures, even with its shape, he should be able to direct it if he needs to use the bathroom. He also notes that fondling his sheath like he was also very stimulating, as the tip of his new wolf cock popped out enough just to be seen. <br />
<br />
Moving on, not wanting to recreate the situation his mom walked in on, Jeff looks over his legs and his new tail. His Dark brown tail has been waging since his mother left the room. It was as long as his legs, and with its fur, just as thick. His legs on the other hand, look like they were ready to run for weeks. The outside of his legs did seem furrier than the inside, he assuming for when he is running and walking. His feet themselves looked like oversized paws. Jeff thinks about it, looking at his hand paws as well, that they look almost too large as well. He assumes that it is because he is still a teen and not an “Adult” dog. <br />
<br />
Jeff walks over to his computer, carefully taking a seat on his computer chair, his tail and butt almost not letting him sit. He brings up the Chronivac again, looking over the changes. He sees that the changes to himself are set to “indefinite” as well as unsaved. With his mom seeing him as a werewolf already, Jeff decides to save the changes before looking over the rest of the page. <br />
<br />
Going further down, he sees the package tab with an asterisk next to the “Werewolf (anytime)”. He clicks the asterisk and a small window pops up with the following text. <br />
<br />
“Can change forms at will. Does not need a full moon and will not change during a full moon unless willing.” <br />
<br />
“Cool” Jeff whispers to himself. Knowing that he can change back and forth is a good thing. <br />
<br />
Jeff then picks up on the scent of the food that his mom left him. He decides to eat it while he continues to read the page. It was difficult, relearning to hold a fork in his paws as well as learning how to close his mouth so that none of the roast and potatoes fell out. <br />
<br />
Getting to the “Special” Tab, Jeff reads over the different options that were there. He sees that all three special options had links and he clicked each one to read on them. <br />
<br />
Can change others – Able to change others via fluid exchange, other than blood, as long as not diluted. Can be ingested or inter the bloodstream. Example: licking a wound or sex. <br />
<br />
Jeff notes this, as now it is even more important to clean up the mess he made on his dirty clothes. But it is surprising that his blood wouldn’t change people too. <br />
<br />
Next was “Fertile”. As expected, this meant that he would not only produce more cum then normal, but he had a better chance of getting someone pregnant. <br />
<br />
Last was the “Ages as normal human in werewolf form”. It read that, even if he would stay in his wolf form the rest of his life, he would age as a human. Jeff thinks this is good, as he didn’t want to die of old age as a werewolf while still being a teenager. <br />
<br />
Finally, at the bottom of the main page, he sees the “Reality change: no” option. He right clicks it to read what it means. <br />
<br />
Changes reality so that the change of the person will not only be seen as normal, but that it now fits into their normal life. Can be implemented at any time. <br />
<br />
“What would happen if I clicked this?” Jeff whispers. Jeff thinks to himself, would this change his mom into a werewolf too? His sister? What about his dad who was temporary station at a different base? Would it change both his parents, or just one. Or would it change reality that Jeff was bitten at one point and now he is the only werewolf in his family. But that would mean that there would be other werewolves out there. The options and theories were breaking Jeff’s mind. <br />
<br />
Jeff snaps out of it as he hears a knock at his door. “Jeff?” his mother asks. <br />
<br />
“You can come in mom.” Jeff says as he minimizes the screen at his computer. <br />
<br />
Jeff’s mother walks in before closing the door. She had a clothes basket in her arms as she walks in. “Looks like you calmed down.” She says looking at Jeff’s sheath. Jeff blushes as she lets out a giggle. “Hey, I saw you naked in your body for years. It’s fine. Your sister is asleep in my room watching one of her moves. You can do laundry now,” She says as she sets the basket on the bed. “Just clean the basket too. I don’t know what your, um, stuff can do to the rest of us. And I don’t want to find out.” <br />
<br />
“Okay, mom.” Jeff says embarrassed. He stands up and grabs the basket to fill it up. After getting all of his clothes off the floor, and wiping any overspray off, he starts walking to the door. <br />
<br />
His mother wraps her arms around him as he passes. “My little boy is so big now. I thought it was just you needing to shave earlier, but now you are taller than me too.” Jeff looks down at his mom, a first in his life. He is now a good eight inches taller, when he was barely an inch shorter before his change. <br />
<br />
“Mom….” He whines to her laughter. <br />
<br />
“Sorry,” She replies before letting him go. “I guess we will tell your dad when he gets back in a few weeks. Have you tried turning back?” <br />
“Not yet. I will after I get these in the wash.” Jeff replies. <br />
<br />
“Then you were just researching on your computer on how to?” his mother asks. <br />
<br />
Jeff nods in a half lie. “Yes, I should be able to just ‘will’ myself back, since I didn’t change during a full moon. But still have no idea how this happened. Nothing bit or scratched me. I mean unless it is hereditary?” <br />
<br />
“I think I, or your father, would have known that.” His mother says with a little annoyance as they make their way to the laundry room. “That is not something you hide from family.” <br />
<br />
 His mother keeps an eye out for Jenny as Jeff starts his clothes. He is careful not to spread his seed on the washer and washes out the basket in the utility room sink after. He decides to wash everything together, just in case. <br />
<br />
After that is finished, he and his mother make their way back to his room, where she retrieves his plate of food. “Was it good? I know you like roast.” <br />
<br />
“It was great!” Jeff admits. “Eating it like this, it was like eating it for the first time.” Jeff wasn’t lying this time. His new tongue and mouth gave him new tasting abilities that he never knew before. And his nose, he could smell his sister all the way across the house. And his hearing, he could hear stuff for miles, but somehow was able to filter it out when he wanted. <br />
<br />
His mother raised an eyebrow. “Not just saying that?” Jeff shakes his head “no” to his mother’s question. “Fine, I will let you know when the washer is off. Just try to return to your ‘normal’ body.” <br />
<br />
Jeff nods as his mother walks out of his room, closing the door behind her. He too wanted to return to normal, at least until he could explore his body more and see what he could do. He walks back to in front of his mirror, hoping that seeing himself will help. <br />
<br />
“Alright, Jeff, ‘will’ yourself.” He whispers as he closes his eyes. He focused hard, but nothing happened. He tries again, thinking of himself before the change. Slowly, he feels his body tingle and cramp. Not wanting to stop the change, he keeps his eyes closed as he feels his fur and muscles recede. His tail returns in him and his ears move to the side of his head. His hands and feet return to normal, and he could feel his balls pull in and his penis de-sheath. Finally, with a cool breeze from his AC vent, Jeff felt comfortable that he was back to human. <br />
He opens his eyes to find his mother standing there, about to wrap a blanket around him. “I can in to tell you that your washer was done, but you were slowly turning back.” She says as she wraps her son with the blanket. <br />
<br />
“How long where you in here?” Jeff asks, concerned of losing all that time. <br />
<br />
“A few minutes.” She replies. “Enough to see the last of your doggy body disappear. Why?” <br />
<br />
“That felt like seconds to me.” Jeff admits. <br />
<br />
“Maybe because of you having to focus.” His other replies. “Look, go to bed. I will take care of the laundry. You have been through enough tonight. Hopefully in the morning, you can find some answers. Just remember that your sister will be here and so will Susan. Just don’t let them catch you in your furry form.” <br />
<br />
Jeff agrees as he takes the blanket with him to his bed. His mother tucks him in, something she hadn’t done in years, before giving him a concerned kiss on the head. “Sleep well.” She says before turning out the lights and closing the door on her way out. <br />
<br />
Jeff lays there, tired from all the changing, dosing off in his sleep.</p>
