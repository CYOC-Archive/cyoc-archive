<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lilith woke up in the same regal looking room her servant had created, feeling a rag being rubbed over her head. “Ah Queen Lilith, you’re finally awake.”, Her servant said clearly very happy her mistress was well. The room now smelt of heavy fragrances but with the faintest smell of sex to show the corruptive nature of the place. Next to her, Lucy had prepared an array of delicious looking dishes and laid out a choice of clothes to wear, if Lilith chose to. “Even the Demon Queen must maintain some standard of food intake. It&#39;s very clear to me, you had not fulfilled that need for yourself, mistress.”<br />
<br />
Lilith simply thanked her servant, deciding to not argue with Lucy knowing she was correct. “Hopefully soon we will not have to worry about these things my dear. Now tell me, how long was I asleep?” Lilith inquired from her servant. “In human time, 5 nights. You were clearly drained of all your energy.” Lucy immediately answered.<br />
<br />
“I must have used my remaining energy to corrupt your human self. Hmm. And your first corruption? How did it feel?” Lilith mused, curious about the man next door, though she could already feel the incubus’s gratefulness in hell. Lucy smiled and her maidly look slightly faded to answer. “It was wonderful. Fucking a soul from a human is indescribable, not to mention of the taste of the corrupted soul is beyond words as well. But he is not the only one I’ve taken.” Lilith smiled waiting for Lucy to talk about the 4 demons she could sense downstairs. “If you could follow me mistress.” Lucy stood up and asked, helping Lilith out of the bed. Something Lilith hadn’t noticed when she woke up was her bust was now at least a size bigger, reaching full F cups. Now that she was up and moving, she could feel the added weight and pleasure from her exposed breast. “Do not worry Queen Lilith, I noticed the change and already adjusted your outfits accordingly.<br />
<br />
Lucy now wore a gown for a maid, but one that left nothing to the imagination showing a massive amount of cleavage and did nothing to hide her womanhood. Meanwhile, Lilith picked up a couple of the dresses, some more regal looking, others that she might as well continue to be naked, not that the succubus queen minded being, but her servant insisted. She picked up a black and red gradient, silk one piece that was like Lucy’s in that it left little to the imagination. After helping Lilith into her desired attire, she escorted her out of the quiet room where they were immediately met with loud moans ringing throughout the house. In the living room, a pair of incubi and succubi were fucking each other but the presence of Lilith forced them to stop.<br />
<br />
“My my, Lucy. How did these poor saps end up as willing pawns of my army?” Lilith said, impressed by the work she had done with these four. “Well, it was simple, the two red ones came looking for their daughter, believing she could be here. If I recall, they were asking for a ‘Zoe’ at the door. Though after letting them in and a few minutes of ‘convincing sex’ later, they were no longer interested in finding their ‘lost’ daughter, but rather serving their queen. The two purple ones, I believe were once my human forms parents. I let the red ones handle them.”<br />
<br />
Hearing that the last of her old human forms connections to this world were taken care of made the Demon Queen incredibly happy. “Good. Without any connections left here, I can really begin my plans. Now you four, travel to hell and convert every demon currently ‘loyal’ to Baphinox you can. A simple fuck should rewire their loyalty to me. Now go, before I decide to change all of you into lowly imps.” The former parents of the two demons quickly followed the command, a fire began to surround all of them sending them to hell, but not before they all thanked their Queen for awakening them. “I was wondering how we were going to deal with our pesky ‘parents’ but it seems they fell right into your lap my servant. If we didn’t have more pressing matters, I would reward you.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you, my Queen. What do you intend to do next?” Lucy asked having fully regained her maidly façade. Lilith walked back up to the transformed room and looked out the window. “You do not need to worry about being spotted. I have used a spell to make the window always appear empty.” Lucy answers the question right before Lilith asked.<br />
<br />
“I need to set up a place to conduct the early part of my take over. Perhaps…a ‘Gentleman’s Club’ could be a good start. That place alone will give us thousands of humans there to corrupt, not to mention converting the dancers and other employees to our cause.” Lilith gave a stern answer watching as a couple humans walked outside of the house, unaware that their days as humans were more than likely numbered. Lucy quickly answered, “There’s a fairly popular one not too far from here. My old human form knows It well. She had secretly tried to get a job there after her 18th birthday.”<br />
<br />
“Using your old memories are you, my servant.” Lilith looked over giving a stare that would send more running or killed on the spot. “It is as you said, my old self has fallen to your powerful corruption. It has given itself completely over. How do you believe I knew who the parents were? My old self enjoyed letting them be corrupted.” Lucy answered showing no fear on the outside but terrified on the inside.<br />
<br />
Lilith’s expression changed back to an evil grin, happy to hear her assumption was right. If she ever needed to tap into some old human knowledge, what was left of her corrupted soul and mind would fully oblige. “Good. Now let us change into a human form. The humans will have no doubt notice the disappearances over the past few days. We will need to be more selective of who we corrupt and even then, must only choose those worthy of a seal so they can continue to blend in with human society. Lead the way to this club. I would like to…speak with the owner of the establishment about a change in ownership.” Both succubi changed into human forms not to dissimilar to their demonic forms, outside of lacking any horns, a tail, or a pair of wings. They also gained some more discreet clothes since waiting around in a silk dress and a maid outfit would have made them both stand out. Though their figures would certainly draw some attention.<br />
<br />
The two demons walked out the house, never to return since it would conveniently burn down soon, though Lucy looked back for a second. Lilith took notice of this, “My servant. Do Not Force me to completely wipe your mind and completely recreate it.” Lucy looked back; she understood her mistress’s concerns, but she was only looking back to disconnect her last remnant of humanity as well. She turned back to the demon queen, “No need Mistress. Please follow me, the club is not too far from here.” As the two walked, both men and women were entranced by the beauty of the demons in hiding. Lilith smiled at this fact knowing that at some point, they would all be doing more than stare at her. <br />
<br />
“Here we are. The Demon’s Lounge” Lucy stated after a half hour of walking taking in the site of the building. It was clearly not what one would call a family establishment. The neon lights that were hard to see in the daylight but were in the shape of pair of heels that resembled horns. Lilith took in the place, it was a decently sized building that other than the neon lights and sign on the outside, looked like nothing more than a plain building on the outskirts of town. “Hmmmm, yes…this will do. Lucy, I have a plan on how we will take control of this establishment. All you need to know is you will be a ‘business partner’ with me.”<br />
<br />
The two demons entered the club, it was still early in the day so only the bartender was in the establishment. Hearing the door open, the bartender looked up and his jaw nearly hit the floor looking at the two voluptuous ‘women’ at the entrance. Barely keeping himself together “How can I help you two? We don’t open for another 9 hours.” Lilith looked at the young man behind the bar. He had short, dirty blonde hair with a full beard. He wasn’t very tall, maybe just until 6 feet but it was clear he worked out and kept himself in shape. Using her enhanced vision, she could tell he was clearly excited seeing her and her servant. A quick glance at Lucy also told Lilith she couldn’t wait to have her way with him. “My name is Lilith, and this is my partner, Lucy. I’m looking for the owner of this establishment. I would like to talk to him about a potential…deal.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, he’s in the back office. Behind the curtain, down the hall, and past the dressing room on the left.” Lilith smiled and blew a kiss towards the man. “Wait here and have a chat with…” She looked over at the bartender, “My name’s Derek.” He answered with a slight smile. “Derek. I’ll go ‘give my pitch’. Don’t have too much fun.” Lilith smirked as she turned away, exaggerating the sway of her hips as she walked past the purple curtain. Derek looked in awe before snapping out of it as the other beautiful woman came and sat down in the bar stool in front of him. “So…would you like anything to drink while you wait for her to get back?”<br />
<br />
Lucy looked at the man, “Just a glass of wine will do and pour one for yourself I’ll pay for both.” Lucy stated already cooking up a plan. “So, Lucy, how did you and Lilith become business partners?” Derek poured out two glasses of wine. He still couldn’t believe that an absolute bombshell of a woman was sitting in front of him. Her bust was massive, much bigger than any of the other girls who worked here. Although her boss had a slightly larger chest, Lucy’s was still jaw dropping not to mention her seductive face and voice. “Well, we both knew each other in high school and became very close friends and eventually we decided to start working together. What about you? How does a cutie like you end up working here?” Derek took a sip of the wine before explaining his situation.<br />
Meanwhile, Lilith had reached the back office and knocked on the door. “Enter.” Came a gruff and muffled voice from the other side. Lilith walked in and saw what can only be described as a mess. Papers were all over the place, it had clearly not been cleaned in a long time. ‘That’ll change in a bit’ Lilith thought to herself. Quickly taking a glance at some of the papers she gained knowledge about the place and its current business. Namely that it was obvious the man was hiding a rather large amount of cash he was laundering. It would have been impressively devious had Lilith not seen that the man was also a spineless man just by looking at his aura. “Hello there, my name is Lilith and I wanted to speak to you.”<br />
<br />
The nameplate on the desk read ‘T. Warner’. Sitting behind it was a wrinkly old man. It was clearly in his late 60s, youth had passed him by long ago. From what Lucy had told her on the walk to the club, Mr. Warner used to be an extremely successful businessman before his scams were revealed and he had to use all of his connections to stay out of prison. Since then, he’s been relegated to running this run-down club. “So, Mrs. Lilith, what would you like to discuss?” Mr. Warner stated thinking that she was here to ask for a job which he would certainly give thanks to her impressive figure. <br />
<br />
“I wanted to extend an offer to you Mr. Warner, I am currently establishing a foothold in this city for my entrepreneurship. You see, I would like to purchase your business. I’m willing to give you a rather large payment to do so you’ll be able to enter an early retirement.” Lilith said hoping the old man would decline so she could test out her other abilities. Mr. Warner chuckled, “I’m sorry miss but I’m not interested. I am doing perfectly well and enjoy running this business.” Lilith could tell the lies coming from far away. His Money Laundering had taken a toll on the actual profits of the building leading to it appearing to be in debt. “Well that’s disappointing but surely I can’t be a little more persuasive…” Upon saying those words, Lilith’s eyes became slits but instead of their usual Jasmine green, they were a red color. <br />
<br />
Before he could even react to the change in her eyes, Mr. Warner fell into a trance unable to look away from the demon’s eyes. “You belong to me now for the rest of your sad life. You will give me control of the business. You will make that announcement to all the girls you employ here at The Demon’s Lounge tonight. You will also show me where your money is hidden so I may use it to give this place a much-needed upgrade. Once I am done with them, you will meet me back in this office, and I will decide if you are worth anything to me. Now, who am I to you?” The old man had everything the Succubus Queen said to him implanted into his mind. “You are…my Queen, Lilith” he breathed out. “Good, now Lucy should be finished any moment now...”, A loud couple of moans soon followed from inside the main room.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes of conversation, neither the succubus nor man could hold back anymore, one wanting to fuck his brains out by nature, the other being affected by the pheromone Lucy put into his wine when he wasn’t looking. Lucy was sitting on the counter having her clothes being ripped off by Derek, without noticing the small fire they disappeared into. Derek was already out of his clothes as he slammed his lips against Lucy’s as he groped her exposed breast.<br />
Lucy rubbed his exposed and erect member to coax a moan out from Derek, “I’ll take good care of you.” She whispered into his ear. The pleasurable throbs forced him to keep his eyes closed, meaning he didn’t see Lucy drop the human form as she positioned herself over his dick. Before Derek had a chance to recover, she pulled it into her succubus pussy sealing his fate.<br />
<br />
Derek couldn’t think. All he could do was thrust into the most pleasurable feeling in his entire life. His eyes were tied shut due to the sheer pleasure. The images of Lucy kept appearing in his mind, but they soon changed to more than her. They changed to large orgies that only one could dream of. Hundreds, if not thousands, of people all fucking each other like animals. And then a creature…no…a succubus appeared; it was Lilith. The vision of Lilith began to speak with him, “My servant Lucy chose well. A man capable of greed even beyond the owner of this place. I must say, covering as a simple bartender when you really are who Mr. Warner spent the last 5 years hiding his immense wealth with even stealing it for your own gain. But not anymore. It belongs to me, Lilith, your Queen. As do you, now…AWAKEN DRAKEN! INCUBUS OF GREED!”<br />
<br />
Derek’s eyes shot open as a glow between Lucy and him ended, his eyes already darkened with green slits splitting them. On his groin now sat a circular shape with an intricate pentagram designed inside, the incubus seal. “YES LILITH! LET ME BECOME YOUR SERVANT!” The man shouted out continuing to thrust into the Succubus sitting on the bar. A dark shade of green began to spread up and down his body. His muscles expanded at an exponential rate wherever the green touched his body. Lucy could feel his member expand and lengthen inside of her, driving her even more mad with lust and want, “YES! FASTER! CHANGE FASTER!”<br />
<br />
His stomach morphed into a full eight pack, along with his legs and arms gaining unfathomable amounts of muscle to fill out his growing frame. Just as his back was covered completely, a pair of wings exploded out of his shoulder blades. Through his new demonic instincts, he already knew how to control them. They also told him something else about the Succubus he was fucking. “Go ahead Draken.” Lilith had finally walked into the room, completely in her demonic form, “We need more numbers and Lucy here is perfectly willing to help. And she deserves a reward for all the hard work she has done already.” His face had been fully covered by this point as two horns began to push out of his skull until they were the same size as Lucy. Derek was gone. In his place stood the demon of Greed, Draken. “You heard her Draken. GIVE ME WHAT I WANT! GIVE ME YOUR CORRUPTED SEED!” Lucy screamed out.<br />
<br />
“With pleasure Lucy.”, Draken began to speed up his thrusts as he pulled her off the bar and onto the floor. An hour passed before he finally felt his first demonic release coming before without warning, Lucy swapped their positions so she was on top looking down at Draken with her blue eyes beaming down at the incubus. “I’m getting knocked up on MY terms!” The Succubus of Lust shouted. Draken only complied as he got into rhythm with her. <br />
<br />
Draken then felt his throbs become more intense until both demons couldn’t hold back. Lucy was the first to climax, cumming hard on his demonic cock and forcing it to release its corrupted seed into her waiting womb. Within seconds, it had already filled up her womb where an egg lay in wait, something any succubus could control if they wanted to bear a demon. “YES! YES! FINALLY!” Lucy screamed out in relief she was finally being allowed to live out her desire with her Queen’s blessing.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, both the Succubus and new Incubus had already recovered and noticed Lilith sitting at one of the bar stools, “Welcome Draken. How are you feeling?”<br />
<br />
“It’s indescribable my Queen. Had I known what that guitar would bring, I would have tried to release you to corrupt me years ago. The pleasure and power of being a demon is unmatched” The incubus answer before grabbing Lucy and pulling her into a lust filled kiss. <br />
<br />
“I can imagine, now both of you need to get ready. We have some girls arriving here shortly, don’t we? What’s say we help them get ‘accommodated’ to their new owner. Maybe with the help of a little music…” Lilith said as she pulled out the old guitar, Baphinox. “Draken, are they all going to be here tonight?”<br />
<br />
The incubus and succubus were already fondling each other again when Lilith asked the question, “All but one my Queen. Her name is Amanda and compared to the others she’s much more ‘innocent’. She’s only here on slow nights to help pay for college or something. Speaking of payment, don’t worry my queen, all that money will be brought back here soon.” Draken explained to Lilith as he did the best to not start fucking Lucy again, knowing there were other tasks at hand.<br />
<br />
“Innocent you say. Well maybe I will have to deal with her on my own. As for you two, clean up this mess, they’ll all be here an hour prior to opening. We need to make sure their new training goes well.” Lilith said as Lucy and Draken got to work, preparing for the ‘lucky’ girls and customers tonight.</p>
