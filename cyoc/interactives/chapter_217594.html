<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I followed Ethan to one of the small siderooms we had signed for that day.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, no one had reserved it again, so Ethan renewed it for almost two full hours. My heart quailed at the thought of having to study for hours. There was no way my bullbrain could possibly remember all that!<br />
<br />
“Alright, wait here, let me setup my presentation.” Ethan said. “You’re a visual learner and good at hands-on stuff, so I brought as much stuff that I could to make this easy for you.”<br />
<br />
“Mrroo! You’re such a good friend!” I lowed happily, my ears waggling.<br />
<br />
“Friend?” Ethan frowned. “No, just your tutor. Be right back.”<br />
<br />
My ears lowered a bit at that. I’d forgotten we weren’t friends. For the life of me, I couldn’t help but wonder why I kept thinking I was best friends with this strange human. To take my mind off of things while Ethan set up his projector and stuff, I browsed the aisles.<br />
<br />
It smelled like old books and coffee in here. <br />
<br />
Some human students passed by me, wrinkling their noses as they did and hurrying away. I sniffed my armpit. My body reeked of bovine sweat and musk. With a flash of horror, I realized that I had forgotten to shower after the gym. Well, no, that wasn’t entirely accurate-Ethan hadn’t allowed me to shower, so now I stunk like a barn during high summer.<br />
<br />
The looks of disgust made me feel more self-conscious. I wasn’t a stinky bull! Ethan hadn’t let me shower! Mroo! I hated when people thought I stunk!<br />
<br />
“Kevin?” Ethan poked his head out, his nose wrinkling a little but he didn’t say anything. “I’m ready for you.”<br />
<br />
I lumbered inside, taking a seat on the too-small chair. It cracked and started to bend under my weight. I bit my lip, terrified it would break beneath me. Human chairs did that a lot to me and sometimes the shards jab my ass and it hurts a lot.<br />
<br />
“Look, you really need to concentrate, okay?” Ethan said. “Coach Hendrix promised me some special hookups if I can keep his star players from getting kicked out of school.”<br />
<br />
“Really?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes, and this time eats into my work on my thesis, so work hard, okay?” Ethan said, trying to smile and be more upbeat, but I could tell he was faking it.<br />
<br />
I nodded. “Okay, Ethan, I’ll try.”<br />
<br />
Ethan cleared his throat. “Alright. First thing I want you to do is take your notebook and list three things you are good at.”<br />
<br />
I cocked my head. “Why?”<br />
<br />
“Well, I know you’re good at football. What else are you good at?” Ethan explained. “This way, I understand you a bit better. Plus I can phrase questions in a way you can relate to them.”<br />
<br />
“But I didn’t bring my books.” I objected.<br />
<br />
“The notebook and pencil you’re carrying is fine.” Ethan said.<br />
<br />
I grit my teeth, tail, swishing in agitation.<br />
<br />
What should I do? I couldn’t use my notebook for this stuff, it might hurt me! But I also couldn’t tell Ethan I wasn’t going to take notes. He really had me cornered here, getting up to acquire printer paper to write on would look suspicious and I definitely didn’t want him using my notebook.<br />
<br />
“Come on, man, time’s a wastin’.” Ethan said, tapping his fingers on the table impatiently.<br />
<br />
With a sigh, I opened up my notebook. “Fine, okay, I guess I’ll think of something other than football.”<br />
<br />
“Well, that can be your first thing to write down.” Ethan said quickly. “Just two things, now. Two things that you are good at.”<br />
<br />
‘Things I’m good at’ I wrote. Then I wrote down football and paused. What else was I good at?<br />
<br />
“You got this. What do you like doing? Don’t you like drawing? You’re always drawing in class.” Ethan encouraged.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but…” I said, not sure how to tell him that I was doodling because I was bored and they were mostly throbbing cocks?<br />
<br />
“Just write it down.” Ethan waved his hand.<br />
<br />
‘Drawing.’ I wrote. <br />
<br />
My vision suddenly swam as the notebook glowed. When I blinked again, the distortion was gone and Ethan was smiling. He made a hurry up gesture at me. <br />
<br />
“Well, one more.” Ethan said.<br />
<br />
“Uh… “ I thought quickly. “Sexy stuff! I’m good at figuring out hot scenarios!”<br />
<br />
Ethan grimaced. “Uh, sure. Just write it down as ‘Erotica’.”<br />
<br />
I wrote down ‘Erotica’.<br />
<br />
Again, my vision swam and the words glowed. Perverted thoughts crammed into my head. Lustful ones, and they all begged to be drawn. I was good at drawing, after all! Just as I lifted the pencil to start drawing, Ethan cleared his throat.<br />
<br />
“Okay, so we’ve figured out you are very horny and good at drawing! That’s.. progress?” Ethan shook his head. “Okay, so for the next hour, we’re going over anatomy lessons. You’ve got a failing grade in it. Why did you take Anatomy, anyways?”<br />
<br />
“I only signed up for anatomy class because, you know…” I smiled wryly.<br />
<br />
“Right, of course,” Ethan snorted. “What’s your major, then?”<br />
<br />
“Biology.”<br />
<br />
“A lot of science and math for a guy who can’t do either very well.”<br />
<br />
“That’s what Josh is doing!” I protested. “He’s kinda dumb too!”<br />
<br />
“No, he’s taking Sports Medicine and Nutrition classes.” Ethan explained.<br />
<br />
I huffed silently.<br />
<br />
Mroo! How could I be so dumb!<br />
<br />
“Maybe you should change your Major.” Keven suggested. “Try something you’re good at. Maybe art or something?”<br />
<br />
I froze, nodding slowly as I considered the idea. “Yeah… Yeah! Change my Major! Of course! Then college will be easier!’<br />
<br />
“You can’t do it mid-semester but…” Ethan went off on a long winded explanation about how semesters and classes and majors worked.<br />
<br />
I wasn’t paying any attention to him. Why would I? I could change my Major with a sentence. Taking a breath, I wrote ‘My Major in college is Erotica’. The notebook glowed brightly.<br />
<br />
“Oky, so, let’s move on to the demonstration for anatomy.” Ethan said, holding up a plastic anatomical model of a cock and anus, cross-sectioned. “Let’s review your knowledge of the prostate and how best to use a penis to reach it.”<br />
<br />
I chuckled. Penis. Hehehe. Then I frowned as I realized we hadn’t really gotten to that part of the anatomy.<br />
<br />
“Uh, are you skipping over chapters?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“No, How to Find the Male G-Spot is First in Anatomical Studies.” Ethan flipped through his book, which had a very erotic scene of two men fucking-cross-sectioned, of course-on the cover. “And please try to stay serious. You need to find the G-Spot during your next lab.”<br />
<br />
I nodded and tried to stay focused. Unfortunately, my mind kept wandering. It was so difficult to concentrate in here with his droning voice and the smell of old books and coffee! It was practically putting me to sleep! I wanted to ram the model cock in the anus but I knew Ethan would disapprove.<br />
<br />
Mroo! Even when it’s sexy the tutoring was boring!<br />
<br />
Not that it was Ethan’s fault, the material was just very dry. Erotica or not, this was still a college course. Lame. Sad Mroo. My ears fell.<br />
<br />
“Alright, moving on to Fellatio Pleasure Areas…” Ethan droned on.<br />
<br />
Shit! I looked down and realized I’d been drawing a very detailed and realistic canine cock. Veins throbbed and the knot bulged juicily. I grimaced, not having any notes was bad. Especially since I hadn’t been paying much attention. <br />
<br />
“E-Ethan,” I interrupted, “can we go back and hit the major points of-”<br />
<br />
“No!” Ethan snapped, his eyes narrowing as he saw the cock on my notepad. “Pay attention instead of drawing fat dog cocks.”<br />
<br />
“Wolf cock.” I corrected instantly, then realized I’d made a faux pas when Ethan glared at me.<br />
<br />
“Who fucking cares what kind of cock it is when it’s supposed to be NOTES!” Ethan clenched his jaw angrily.<br />
<br />
“Yes, Ethan,” I lowed sadly.<br />
<br />
“Now, like I was saying about Fellatio…”<br />
<br />
I tried to take notes, really, I did. But as the hour went on, I found myself drawing more and more of the art around the big fat wolf cock. The cock was done, but it needed an owner, so I sketched a proper muscular wolf, one with nicely bulgy muscles, softened by a thick coat of fluffy fur. <br />
<br />
It went like that, moving from note-taking to adjusting the sketch of the wolf. <br />
<br />
He needed a nice pair of throbbing balls, so I made two fat tangerine-sized balls, then swelled them a bit bigger. I placed his arms and legs on straps, raising him up like he was on a sex swing, so I could sketch out his nice anus. I tried making it look like it was clenching and needy, but the sketch really couldn’t convey it. So instead, I filled it with a nice big dildo. <br />
<br />
I swapped back to my notes when Ethan switched to another topic, grew bored after he hit the summary, then back to the sketch again.<br />
<br />
Time for the paws. Big and sweaty, clawed toes curling in pleasure as the dildo plunged into his hole, likely smacking the prostate, like Ethan had said earlier. I angled the dildo a little bit to make it more realistic, like an expert was using it. The hand holding the dildo was another anthro… should it be my hand or maybe Ryan? Oooh, Ryan was a good one! He knew how to train people into being proper subs!<br />
<br />
I added a big clawed grizzly hand gripping the dildo. Ethan was talking about eating out ass, so I switched back to my notes, making sure I hit the summary of the section. This was getting much easier, now that I noticed how Ethan was speaking. He’d drone on about boring extraneous stuff, but emphasize the real points.<br />
<br />
Back to the drawing, I tried to imagine what expression the wolf should have on his face. All of Ryan’s boys ended up looking kinda… slutty? It was hard to describe, but I drew half-lidded eyes and a maw that was sagging open, his breath coming in heavy huffs and pants, tongue lolling to the side. I added little blush lines and rolled his eyes upward, as though he was experiencing ecstasy.<br />
<br />
Yes! That was it, perfect!<br />
<br />
I started working in some piercings, a diamond stud in the right ear, a Prince Albert on his cock. Oh! Almost forgot Precum! I drew it flowing down over his shaft and knot, making his ball fur matted and damp with slick goodness. With a flourish, I added a few more details-The room we were in and the library behind it in the window.<br />
<br />
Maybe, instead of a library…I erased the book shelves and replaced them with sex toys and paddles, chains, all kinds of recreational devices. How-to books about sex positions, the Kama Sutra, and other sex books now lined an upper shelf as an after-thought.<br />
<br />
Just as I finished the last line of the sketch-up, Ethan turned off his projector and set down his anatomical model.<br />
<br />
I looked up in horror, realizing I’d forgotten to write down any notes for the last... I looked at the clock, my eyes wide-almost half an hour! Oh no, I was in deep shit! Desperately, I shuffled through my meager notes, hoping they would be enough to at least not earn Ethan’s ire.<br />
<br />
Going through them, my mind felt overwhelmed by information. I followed some advice I’d gotten once and repeated the answers three times in my head. By the time I was done reviewing what notes I had, I was swamped with facts that had no real context.<br />
<br />
Ethan glanced over at my notes and smiled. <br />
<br />
“Wow, that’s a good anatomical drawing!” Ethan pointed at one of the doodles I’d done next to my notes, complete with labels.<br />
<br />
“Thanks!” I blushed.<br />
<br />
Mroo! Ethan liked my drawings!<br />
<br />
“Alright Kevin, let’s review what I covered with you today.”<br />
<br />
“Of course! Review!” I said loudly, trying to hide my nervousness.<br />
<br />
“Where is the prostate?” Ethan asked.<br />
<br />
My mind blanked.<br />
<br />
“Use your notes.” Ethan encouraged. “You’re allowed to for now.”<br />
<br />
I looked down at my drawing and saw the bulb above the anus, behind the cock. <br />
<br />
“There.” I pointed.<br />
<br />
“Very good!” Ethan grinned.<br />
<br />
My heart fluttered.<br />
<br />
He continued going over the questions, and I managed to use my doodles to solve most of the answers. Until we got to the last three chapters he’d gone over. The ones I hadn’t paid attention to.<br />
<br />
“So, can a man cum hands-free?” Ethan asked.<br />
<br />
“Hands-free?”<br />
<br />
“No touching of the cock or balls.” Ethan frowned. “You took notes, right?”<br />
<br />
I felt embarrassed and frustrated. Why couldn&#39;t I have paid better attention? It had been working up to this point, then I got so drawn in by that wolf…<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t remember,&quot; I said quietly.<br />
<br />
Ethan let out a sigh. &quot;Kevin,where are your notes and drawings? How do you not remember anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Ethan. I just have a hard time with this stuff,&quot; I said, feeling ashamed.<br />
<br />
“Let me see.” Ethan said, pulling the notebook to him. He flipped the page and his eyes fell on the wolf. He rolled his eyes. “Come on, Kevin! This isn’t some furry fanart site, we’re trying to get you a proper education here. Stop drawing hot gay wolves and start paying attention!”<br />
<br />
He passed the notebook back to me and glowered.<br />
<br />
As Ethan glared at me, artistic inspiration struck like a lightning bolt. I picked up the pencil as the nondescript young man continued to berate me. <br />
<br />
Going back to the drawing, I erased the wolf’s ahegao expression. No, that was too obvious, too plain. Anyone could draw a sex-addled wolf. Drawing quickly, I gave the figure that same glowering expression Ethan had given me not a moment ago. Now the wolf looked annoyed, impatient. I could practically hear him critique the one holding the dildo.<br />
<br />
Yeah, that was way more interesting! I could just imagine him berating me as… Mroo! Hold the fucking phone! Me shoving a dildo up the wolf’s ass was way hotter than the big grizzly! I erased Ryan’s paw and replaced it with mine. <br />
<br />
Now it depicted my hoofletted hand as I shoved the dildo up the wolf’s ass, trying to find the G-Spot. <br />
<br />
With a few lines of pencil, I added a few more details. The side of the room had a projector now, with a .gif of proper dildonic motion projected onto the wall. An anatomical model of a penis and an anus were in the corner, the cock stuck down the passage of the anus at the correct angle to strike the prostate.<br />
<br />
Then I gave the wolf some nipple piercings and altered his hairstyle and eyes. No, the whole face, adjusting them all just so. Taking the eraser, I added the pair of glasses Ryan was wearing. He could really pull off that glower, after all. There, perfect! <br />
<br />
I titled it ‘Ethan, my best friend and tutor’. As I lifted away my pencil, the notebook glowed.<br />
<br />
“Kevin, are you listening to me?” Ethan said, continuing to glower at me. <br />
<br />
I looked up at him and my mouth dropped open. <br />
<br />
The human’s arms were being raised up over his head by leather straps that were strapped around his wrists. As I watched, his clothes began to unravel, leaving his pale skin and thin, definition-less body exposed to the air. Behind him, the library began to alter as well, shelves of books becoming shelves of pleasure devices and toys.<br />
<br />
“Uh..” My mouth was dry as I watched Ethan’s body begin to pulse and slowly fill with muscle. “Yeah, of course I’m listening.”<br />
<br />
Ethan was stretched into a Y-shape, his feet a few inches off the floor now. His now-athletic body continued to pulse as his muscles expanded and contracted rhythmically, pound after pound of pure man-beef swelling into existence. Ethan’s small cock dangled limply between his legs before it grew erect and began to lengthen.<br />
<br />
“Then do what I asked you to do!” Ethan’s voice was sharp.<br />
<br />
Leather bands dropped from the ceiling and looped around his ankles, pulling the human’s legs up and up. I watched as the hair dusting his body grew denser, becoming a forest of fluffy gray and black fur. There was a popping sound from behind him and a tail curled out from his lower back, brushing the floor as it wagged.<br />
<br />
“And, uh, what exactly was it that you wanted me to do?” I stammered, not daring to believe my eyes as the image I had drawn slowly became reality.<br />
<br />
Out in the library behind him, I saw other rooms like this one, with harnesses. I shook my heavy head, ear wagging, as I corrected myself. This was obviously the Lupanarium, not the Library! Looking back at Ethan, I watched as he face pressed out into a lupine muzzle, his feet growing and becoming clawed paws.<br />
<br />
The wolf growled.<br />
<br />
“The dildo!” Ethan’s yellow eyes shone behind his glasses and his teeth gleamed white. “Pick up the dildo and find my prostate!”<br />
<br />
His paws were raised over his shoulders, the heavily muscled wolf swinging in the harness. I carefully picked up a dildo made of black silicone and looked up at Ethan’s winking pucker.<br />
<br />
I could smell his musk now, heady and masculine. He was definitely horny, though the annoyed look on his face would have led me to believe otherwise. Ethn carefully stuck out a finger and I followed where he was pointing.<br />
<br />
“The lube, Kevin! Hurry up.” Ethan growled. “You need to find my prostate, it’s going to be on your anal exam. And when you’re done, Fellatio studies is next.”<br />
<br />
I stared as his cock continued to grow, reddening and swelling until it was nearly a foot long of hot, throbbing wolf-meat. His balls swelled large, into tangerines, then larger still, sagging low, almost covering his anus.<br />
<br />
Taking the lube, I liberally applied it to the dildo, then squirted the slick liquid into my hoofletted hands, rubbing them together to warm it up. Then I careful rubbed it around the rim of his tight anal ring. Ethan gasped, his hole sucking needily at my fingers.<br />
<br />
“Well? Stop fingering my ass and put that dildo to use!” Ethan growled.<br />
<br />
I nodded and hurriedly pressed the tip of the dildo to his ring.<br />
<br />
It swallowed the dildo, his hole clenching and sucking it greedily into Ethan’s depths. I heard Ethan groan and pressed the dildo in deeper. Finally, it bottomed out, the tips of my fingers half inside the throbbing flesh.<br />
<br />
Glancing at my notes, I angled the dildo and started to thrust.<br />
<br />
“Ah, nff, lower.” Ethan gasped. I adjusted my grip, the dildo squelching. “There. Ngh!”<br />
<br />
I watched as Ethan tried to maintain his composure while the dildo plumbed his depths. The wolf groaned and writhed in his restraints but managed to keep his yellow eyes fixated on me. He glowered balefully at me some more, though his attitude kept slipping the more I massage dhis prostate.<br />
<br />
“G-good!” Ethan said. “Take it out.”<br />
<br />
I gently tugged out he dildo. Ethan growled again in mild discomfort as the dildo popped free. Then I lubed up my hand.<br />
<br />
“What are you-nghf!” Ethan hissed in delight as I shoved my hand up his ass and started massaging him from the insides. <br />
<br />
I worked him like a meat puppet. Ethan’s jaw slacked, his eyes rolling in their sockets. <br />
<br />
“Ngf! Stop! F-fallatio-”<br />
<br />
“It can wait,” I whispered, stroking and rubbing his prostate, exerting firm pressure with my hooflets.<br />
<br />
Ethan growled and musky precum spattered across my face as his cock flexed.<br />
<br />
“Do you like it, Ethan?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“W-what about Josh?” Ethan stammered. I flexed my fist, prompting Ethan’s fat wolf cock to spurt more runny precum. “Nggh!”<br />
<br />
“What about him? Of course I’d help out my best friend when he’s so pent-up.” I said.<br />
<br />
“Oh, you bullheaded-gah!” Ethan grimaced as my fingers tickled his G-Spot.<br />
<br />
“Mrrooo, just relax and let it go.” I lowed happily, my ears waggling.<br />
<br />
I massaged his love-spot relentlessly. Ethan tried to resist, but every flex of my hand brought a whimper to his canine lips and more precum running down my arm. His clawed toes curled.<br />
<br />
“Kevin, I’m-”<br />
<br />
I pumped my fist into his clenching hole. Faster and faster, the wolf squirming in bliss. His pucker started to spasm in a slow roll and his body relaxed against his restraints. I didn’t stop, my fingers pressing and rubbing his prostate.<br />
<br />
The wolf tensed, then let out a howl as his balls emptied their contents across my face.<br />
<br />
Mroo! So much cum! I licked it off my muzzle with my thick bovine tongue and then kissed Ethan sensuously. Ethan’s glare had softened.<br />
<br />
“Sorry for not studying,” I whispered huskily. “Do you think I’ll pass?”<br />
<br />
“Can a man cum hands-free?” Ethan whispered back.<br />
<br />
I nodded.<br />
<br />
“Take this as an object lesson.” Ethan growled playfully. “Now get me down from here!”</p>
