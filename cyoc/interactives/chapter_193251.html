<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Anticipating his next awesome transformation, Josh hastily snatched the dice out of Brandon&#39;s hands with his newly gained brute force and shook them, blowing into a hole he made with is hand for luck. When he let go, the dice fell out of his sweaty palms and rolled onto the table, landing on a one and a three.<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot; Josh exclaimed. &quot;I even blew into it for fucks sake!&quot; What Josh didn&#39;t realize what that his piece was now on the exact same spot as Brandon&#39;s, a fact that had everyone in the room grow silent.<br />
&quot;Why do you all look like that?&quot; Josh asked, before turning to the board. When he saw what his space had landed on, his slight frown turned into a wide grin. &quot;Hell Yeah!!! I&#39;m getting older!&quot;<br />
&quot;Hold on, Josh.&quot; Thomas butted in, &quot;The age space can also make you younger.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well yeah, but like, there&#39;s more of a chance I&#39;ll get older than younger since eighteen is a low number, right?&quot; Josh had a fair point, actually, which surprised everyone.<br />
What surprised Hank even more was the card that he took from the top of the pile as Josh was cheering and dancing. <br />
<br />
AGE SPACE<br />
Age +40<br />
<br />
Hank gulped, and looked upwards from Josh&#39;s card to tell his friend the bad news. &quot;Uhhh, Josh? You might want to-&quot;<br />
However, Hank wasn&#39;t heard, as Josh started growing and Josh blocked all outside stimuli to pay more attention to his transformation. His body was undergoing some of the same changes that Brandon experienced, although as an orc, his were slightly less drastic as he aged, as at age eighteen any male orc looked as though they could pass for twenty five, and Hank was no exception. <br />
However, his body was expanding, and at an alarming rate as well. He seemed to be aging much faster than Brandon, as he wanted to see himself in his full adult orc body as soon as possible. His muscles started growing out a little more than they were before and his beard filled in as well, covering his entire lower face, until you could barely see his mouth. As he grew taller and taller, he simply had to flex a little to relieve himself of the pain of the clothes as they ripped apart into shreds. &quot;Shit, Sorry Brandon.&quot; Josh said in a much lower and manlier voice than before. &quot;Just throw the evidence away and I&#39;m sure your father will never know he lost that shirt.&quot; Not wanting to hurt Josh&#39;s ego in fear that he would receive a knuckle sandwich, (despite his masculine thirty seven year old body that would prove to be some form of defense in such a fight), kept his mouth shut about the fact that Josh had just torn his father&#39;s favorite shirt into shreds.<br />
Another glance at Josh&#39;s head showed that his hair was thinning a lot more, eventually all disappearing into his scalp, leaving him completely bald. Josh had no problem with this, however, as he felt balding was a sign of maturity, and had on many occasions accidentally peered into his own father&#39;s room as he was masturbating, (who was of course also bald but wore wigs in every public place other than his own home), and been slightly turned on by this. Now every time Josh saw his father without a wig, he would sport a small erection and try to imagine himself with bald hair. And now that he was bald...<br />
The underwear which had been supporting Josh&#39;s truly monster member gave in as it was also torn to shreds by Josh&#39;s cock, as it grew and grew, his testicles growing to be the size of baseballs. His cock twitched a little bit before it shot four consecutive loads of cum, completely skipping any need for pre, as Josh was so turned on that the mere sight of his body made him ejaculate. Looking again at his face, his eyebrows were very bushy now and his tusks grew in size, growing curvatures at the tips like a hog. Some of the hair on his body turned grey, another thing that turned Josh on as he came twice, staining the couch they had just cleaned up. Suddenly multiple piercings popped up out of nowhere in multiple areas of Josh&#39;s body. Both of his ears had three small ones, his right eyebrow was pierced with a silver ring, and two rings were pierced on either side of his lower lip. A large piercing appeared near his naval, and a large ring was lodged into the naval itself. And of course, a piercing on the tip of the dick appeared, as he then ejaculated three more times, staining it and the couch once again.<br />
Josh, thinking the changes were over, started to sit down, before he felt an intense pain in his lower back. Realizing he was still changing, he thought that something would grow out of it, but only felt a deep aching pain as if he needed to go to the chiropractor. <br />
Shocked the changes were not over, Josh stood up again and looked down at his thirty something year old orc body as his muscles began to fade, changing Josh&#39;s grin once again into a frown. &quot;What the hell is going on?!&quot; Josh exclaimed, wanting the changes to stop.<br />
&quot;Dude, I tried telling you. Your card said age plus forty.&quot; Hank told Josh, who now loomed over him more than he did before.<br />
Doing the math in his head, Josh let out an angry yell. &quot;FIFTY EIGHT YEARS OLD!?!?!?&quot;<br />
Looking down at his body again, he had stopped growing in height, but his muscles smoothed out as his gut began to bloat out. Looking at his flat and toned chest, he could feel his pectorals begin to droop downwards as they also grew fatter. In fact, his entire body was gaining quite a large amount of weight as he was weighed down by himself and had to sit back on a chair, revealing his back pain, as he gave out a sigh.<br />
Still confused and angry, Josh realized that he was growing even more hair, but the hair itself was now completely gray. His green skin was already darkened quite a bit, but now it looked to be a muggy green rather than a light green. His tusks grew brown and dirty, and his beard finished his look, the look of a grandpa.<br />
Now standing before the younger men, (even Brandon who was still twenty one years younger than him), stood a colossal grandpa orc who still somehow sported an impressive erection despite being completely disgusted by his own body. The men all looked at Josh&#39;s new character sheet that read:<br />
<br />
Name: Josh<br />
Age: 58<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Race: Orc<br />
Height: 7&#39;2&quot;<br />
Weight: 310 Lb<br />
Attributes: Constantly Horny + Son Breeder<br />
Resistance: 49%<br />
<br />
&quot;The fuck does Son Breeder mean?&quot; Asked Josh in his new grandfatherly voice. Before anyone was able to answer his question, however, he took one glance at Brandon and automatically knew what it meant. His dick grew even harder and spurt out another round of even grosser looking seed, which accidentally landed on Brandon&#39;s shirt.<br />
Brandon looked over angrily at Josh wanting to kick his ass. But he stopped after he realized too what Son Breeder meant. His own dick, which had been hard for the last ten minutes thanks to his new attribute, twitched even more, which started soaking his dad&#39;s favorite pants in copious amounts of pre cum. <br />
Much to everyone surprise, including Josh and Brandon, the thirty seven year old man ran into the arms of the currently sitting old orc and kissed his large hairy lips. Josh, not wanting to think about what he was doing, embraced it as he pulled the younger man into his arms and ripped his shirt and pants off, as they both made out, Josh trying not to hurt Brandon too much, but still trying to put his new son in his place. All that was left was Brandon&#39;s underwear which was now completely soaked and dripping with pre. Brandon instinctively put his knees on Josh&#39;s legs and lifted his ass to the older orc&#39;s head. Smirking, Josh pressed his face into Brandon&#39;s soaked undies and let his tongue find its way to Brandon&#39;s tight ass, as he penetrated it with the tip, trying to stimulate his son ever so slightly.<br />
Brandon&#39;s eyes rolled to the back of his head as his dick exploded with need and a river of pre began running down his shaft, never seeming to end. The river of pre made its way into Josh&#39;s gaping mouth as the old orc gave out a soft chuckle and swallowed it, as he had let it puddle in the side of his mouth as he was stimulating Brandon&#39;s prostate with his tongue, lubricating the tight hole. However, just as the fun was about to continue...</p>
