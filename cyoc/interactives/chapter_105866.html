<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Claudia was led out a doorway, where she found herself in a stable like setting. Around her, people in farming clothes rushed around, heading somewhere. The nurse escorting her began to explain where they were going, &quot;We have decided to place you in the human category of cows&quot;. she said. Claudia was confused for a moment, and it showed on her face, prompting the nurse to continue, &quot;This program was started 2 years ago, after scientists confirmed that human milk is more nutritious than cow milk. IN response, we created the human cow program: qualified women are taken, and modified to produce milk as &quot;cows&quot;.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia nodded, and smiled. Looks like she wasn&#39;t looking her figure much at all. They continued to walk down the hay covered hallway, taking an occasional left or right turn. There was silence between her and the nurse, and the only noise within hearing range was the shouts of what the nurse called farmhands in the distance. <br />
<br />
The nurse soon turned into what looked like a high tech doctor&#39;s office, with a strange contraption in the center. It looked like a bed, moulded to fit a woman on her hands and knees. There was also a large area where the breasts would be. From the ceiling directly above, mechanical arms are frozen mid-grab, as if frozen in time itself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please remove your clothes and climb into the machine on your hands and knees&quot;, states the nurse, moving across to a control panel. Pressing a few buttons, the whole room seems to spring to life, the arms beginning to stir and lights flashing across the many computers and panels. Claudia pulled off her clothing piece by piece and flung it behind her into a basket. Then she walked into the center of the room, and carefully knelt into the designated positions, placing her hands in slots. The nurse pushes something, and cold metal restraints gripped her hands and legs, keeping her from moving. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry dear, this is just for safety. We&#39;ve had people hurt themselves during this procedure.&quot; explained the nurse, not turning to face her. As Claudia watches, the arms begin to lower down, until they were right above her. Two arms extended around her till they were poised near her breasts. Another two went down next to her hips and one came down next to her ass. &quot;Now this may sting a little dear, so hold still&quot;, came the voice of the nurse, as the arms reveals needed on the end of them. The ones near her breasts went in for the kill, injecting her breasts, one each, and releasing their contents before coming out and returning to the ceiling hub. <br />
<br />
Claudia began to feel something building in her breasts. She looked down to see her meager breasts beginning to swell. In the midst of her lust-clouded mind, she understood why there was an opening underneath her breasts. However, her swelling breasts sent bolt of pleasure to her brain, flooding her entire body and senses. Her pussy began to drip hot fluid in between her legs. Soon her body began to shiver, as an orgasm rushed through her body, sending quivered through her growing breasts.  Her breasts quickly sped through sizes: melons, bowling balls, but soon began to slow down, until they were as large as watermelons. Then the arms reached back down and injected a second serum into her massive breasts, while the ones near her hips and the one on her ass all stabbing into her, injecting their contents and pulling out, retracting to the ceiling. <br />
<br />
Claudia felt her hips heat up, and as she looked over her shoulder, she saw them expand outward. Claudia also felt something on her ass, as if it was bigger. She would have to check that later. However, all those thoughts were wiped out of her head as her breasts heated up again. They began to grow slightly, and Claudia felt the grow heavier, as if .... filling. Milk was filling her breasts. She felt her cheeks heat up again, but soon it was over. Her breasts felt extremely heavy, as the machine sank into the floor to give her access to leave. <br />
<br />
Claudia tried to stand up, but failed. &quot;Now, this is a common trend with all of the women in this procedure: none of them can stand up. AS such, you will have to crawl around. Your breasts are full of milk, as you could probably tell. Now, I will be leaving you here, since you need to go down that way&quot;, a panel in the wall slid open, revealing another hay covered hallway. &quot;Good luck, and welcome to the organisation!&quot;, said the Nurse as she left the room. <br />
<br />
Claudia moved to crawl to the entryway, but immediately stopped as a rush of electricity raced from her nipples to her brain. Gingerly, Claudia made her way to the hatch and crawled through, the hatch closing behind her. Claudia found herself in a hallway large enough for her to crawl through, but not large enough for a person to walk though. The corridor was cold, and the walls were lined with mirrors. Claudia shivered, and she felt her nipples harden. Crawling down the hallway a bit, she then paused. Straining with all her might, she managed to get onto her knees, and she examined her breasts. She attempted to lift one, but as soon as she touched it, she felt a pulse of warmed throughout her body. Where her small breasts had once resided, there now were two massive watermelons, fleshy and taut. Her nipples were a dark brown, almost black, and an inch long. Reaching down, she gently brushed her nipple and gasped in response. Her nipples were so sensitive.  Something feeling like hot tears dripped from her nipples, and she gasped. Milk droplets hung of the end. Turning to face the mirror face on, she noticed that her hips were wider, and she also noticed her ass was more bountiful. Claudia grinned: this was the start of a new life. Reaching down to her erect nipples, she gently squeezed them. A powerful jet of milk erupted from the nub and splashed across the mirror, a mini-orgasm exploding through Claudia as she moaned quietly. Returning to her hands and knees, Claudia continued on. <br />
<br />
Crawling down the hallway, Claudia soon entered a massive room, the size of a barn. And that was what it seemed to be. Hay coated the floor everywhere, and stall doors lined the walls. Above her, on the second floor, more doors, these full doors compared to the half doors of the stalls, lined the walls. Claudia crawled over to one of the stalls, and the door opened automatically. Inside, there was a machine with clear suction cups. Claudia remembered reading about these in the guidebook, so she crawled into it. Instantly, the machine registered her presence, and whirred into action. A targeting system locked onto her nipples and locked the suction cups onto her erect, dripping nipples. For a brief moment, nothing happened. Then a strong suction began to pull from within the cup. Claudia moaned as her milk coated the inside of the cups, flowing into the machine. Claudia began to pant and moan as pure pleasure raged through her body, all centering on her breasts. Soon, Claudia felt an orgasm looming, and she gave a gasp of arousal as it raged on, smashing through her restraints and causing her to let out an alien sound which she had never let out before: she mooed. Caught up in the thrill of the orgasm, she mooed as the milk flowed from her. <br />
<br />
All too soon, the milking was over, and the cups disengaged. Claudia crawled out of the machine and upto the second floor on a ramp, and found a door with her name on it. As she neared it, it opened up and she crawled inside, finding a room not unlike her former one. It was reasonably spacious, with all sorts of things that she had, simply modified to fit her new form. It looked almost exactly like her room at home, with her computer and her TV and her bed. It all looked the same. In the corner, Claudia saw a small bowl, and crawled over to it. Curious, she crawled over it until it was underneath her nipple and squeezed her nipples. A short burst of milk sprayed out despite having just emptied, pitter-pattering into the bowl. Retreating back a few steps, Claudia examined her milk. It was a creamy white and seemed to so perfect. Leaning her head down, she took a slurp of it, and her eyes opened wide. It was so sweet and creamy. It tasted like liquid ice cream, and she produced it in her own body! Crawling over to the bed, Claudia found that it was liquid-proof, and that it would not irritate her sensitive nipples. She climbed onto the bed and quickly feel asleep, exhausted.</p>
