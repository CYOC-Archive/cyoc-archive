<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">
<P>You watch in horror that arouses something within you as thick black fur starts to spread over the already hairy muscular frame of the stout little man. He's beginning to grow in height as well as muscle. His thick black beard is devoured by black fur. The bearded area around his chin and upper lip is turning a tan color. </P>
<P>He growls in a deeper voice, "You must get away, I cannot control the beast within me for much longer!" Then he doubles over in pain and moans pitifully.</P>
<P>Part of you wants to run, but you can't. What's happening to him has aroused you on a very primal level. It's one of your fondest sexual fantasies; the stout little man is changing into a black bear. You watch, transfixed by fascination, as his ears disappear beneath fur and begin their crawl up his head as his muzzle begins to push out. He looks up at you with pleading eyes.</P>
<P>"Please go!" He rumbles, "The beast has needs I cannot control! Go now and save yourself!" He shouts in a gravel filled voice. He is obviously wracked with pain and falls over on his side. He lies there, convulsing and you begin to move.</P>
<P>But your feet do not carry you away, no; you are very attracted to the werebear and are fascinated by what is happening to him. You move to him, you bend down and begin stroking his changing face. Tears well up in his eyes, "Go, save yourself, please! You'll become as I am." he says and his words are barely intelligible.</P>
<P>"I know." You say, you bend his face toward your own and you kiss him, pushing your tongue into his growing muzzle.</P>
<P>You watch as the werebear completes his transformation and pet his face, neck and shoulders moving down his body ever closer to his huge cock and balls. Your hands reach his endowment and begin stroking it into full erection. You play with the fur-covered scrotum and feel the heat from his huge fist sized balls.</P>
<P>The werebear moans in pleasure. He looks at you and one intelligible word escapes from his muzzle, "No!" It was a plea but you ignore the last warning and begin to suck his huge cock as you massage his enormous balls.</P>
<P>The werebear grunts in pure pleasure and he then pulls his cock out of your mouth leaving a string of pre-come from you lips to his cock.</P>
<P>He stands and is a good seven feet tall with rippling muscle under the fur coat. His belly is nice and round. He is magnificent, beautiful. He is raw masculinity, the very essence of manhood. His form puts every muscle freak you've ever seen to shame. You get to your knees and kiss his erect organ in worshipful ecstasy. You look up into his eyes in supplication and you see the lust burning within the chocolate brown colored eyes of the bear.</P>
<P>You know what he wants and you obey the silent command of his eyes and body language. You strip for your new lover. You know, instinctively, that you will never need these garments again and you throw them as far from you as you can; they are symbols of the existence you are discarding. You position yourself on all fours for the werebear's pleasure, feeling the cool grass beneath you hands and knees. You feel rough clawed hand-paws moving over your back and butt, caressing you with shocking tenderness for such a wild looking beast and it makes you shiver with anticipation and delight. He lowers himself so that he covers your back and rear completely. His broad furry chest and fat belly rubbing sensuously over your back. You feel his huge slick organ sliding in the valley of your ass and you moan as it pokes at your asshole. You spread your legs to accommodate him, inviting the invader into your most secret and sacred places. </P>
<P>"Yes!" you cry out in the vaults of you mind, "This is what I've always wanted! I want to be a werebear! I want to be this bear's Cub!" and then all is fiery pain as his cock-head penetrates your virgin ass. </P>
<P>The bear pushes you to the ground with the constant force being applied to your rear by his huge pole, penetrating you completely. You feel his warm furry balls pressed up against your own and electric pleasure shoots from them all the way up your spine to the base of your skull and radiates through your body.</P>
<P>The werebear then has leisure time to lick you and grunt passionately in your ear. He nibbles your neck and licks your ears as his cock continues to swell and pulsate within you. Slowly, carefully, he begins to move within you. His grunts sending hot breath across the side of your face. You are his mate; you both know it. The sun is setting as he begins to fuck you with long powerful stokes and as the half moon rises, the bear roars in orgasm, filling with a quart of his ursine seed. You come all over the ground beneath you and the bear gently pulls out of you.</P>
<P>You are rolled over by the beast and licked from head to toe by your werebear lover. He pauses at your groin for a very long time and you almost come again from his ministrations. You return his love with passionate kisses, oral love and massage. Finally, somewhere around midnight, with the half moon high in the sky and after your third round of love making, you follow the bear to his cave. He shambles along in the woods and you follow behind on a well-worn path.</P>
<P>You come to a cave and move deep into it. It is dark, but the moonlight is enough for you to navigate, slowly. You come upon a fire-pit area with wood in it set ready to be lit; there are two sturdy stools by the pit. You move past it, following the bear. You are naked as he is. You reach his sleeping area. You notice a rough table with a bottle and candle on it set next to his bed, which is apparently furs covering straw and heather and some soft blankets. There's a large pillow made of furs and wadded up blankets. There is a rough bookcase next near the foot of the bed with a number of old leather bound books and nick knacks in it and on it. </P>
<P>The bear gestures toward the bed and you obediently climb in. He curls up next to you, from behind, and hugs you to him. You feel his hard cock pressing against your back and you move to place his cock inside of you again. He penetrates you and holds you close in his strong furry arms. He radiates great warmth, but he covers you with the blankets and you drift off into sleep, contented.</P>
<P>The next few weeks are a string of strange awakenings. The stout black bearded man, naked from the waste up, puts a cool wet towel on your head and wipes your chest and the rest of you body down with another wet towel. It's the middle of the night, it seems and you think you've slept for a long time. The candle illuminates his broad handsome face that is full of care and worry. Sometimes, when you wake, it's daylight and he is asleep next to you and other times it's afternoon or night and there's a fire crackling in the fire-pit. But through it all, he is always there, always caring for you. </P>
<P>You awake one evening to the smell of roasting meat. You are delirious, fevered and he brings you a thick meaty soup and feeds it to you. He also gives you chunks of the roasted meat that you recognize as rabbit. He finishes that meal by drizzling honey into your mouth from a small pot. There have been many such meals like this over the time you've been ill and you have lost count of the times you have woken with the muscular black bearded man attending you. </P>
<P>Exhausted and fevered, you begin drifting into sleep with the hairy stout man pressing the cool wet towel to your head and chest. You look into his eyes in the low light in the cave and say, "Thank you." Your voice is oddly deep. </P>
<P>He looks away, rubs his eyes and when he looks back you can see that he has tears standing in his eyes. "Welcome..." he says simply and wipes his eyes again. He covers you up as you have a bout of shivers and he moves behind you on top of the covers and holds you close to him. He cries softly, but you are too tired to ask why. You fall deeply into sleep.</P>
<P>A cool breeze wakens you as it brushes your face. Your head is clear and you feel very well rested. You look out toward the mouth of the cave. It's just past dawn, the sun is streaming through the mouth of the cave and you see the stout man tending to the fire on his stool. He is completely naked. His back is to you and you hear soft sobs from him. Quietly you get out of bed; you are naked. You see with some amazement in the early golden light of dawn, that you too are powerfully muscled, well hung and have thick dark hair all over your body. You reach to your face and run your fingers through a thick beard. You can see in the early morning light that it is as black as the werebear's beard. Slowly, and with a stealth you have never possessed before, you approach the bearman who still sobbing quietly by the fire, muttering to himself.</P>
<P>You reach him and place a big thick-fingered hairy hand on his hairy shoulder and say, "What's the matter?" In a deep bass voice that surprises you.</P>
<P>He looks up at you; guilt and deep sadness are in his tear filled eyes. His tear-streaked face is filled with remorse.</P>
<P>"What's the matter?" He rumbles, "Look at you. I've changed you into a werebear. Now you too have my curse. You too will change into a bear... I should have killed myself long ago so that this would never happen. I'm a monster!" He looks up at you and he seems a tortured soul then the werebear buries his face in his hands and his body is wracked by sobs. </P>
<P>You smile and bend to embrace him from behind, resting your head against his shoulder. </P>
<P>"It's OK! Really." You hear yourself say in that amazing rumble of a huge man. "You have to know something about me before you judge yourself too harshly." You say in comforting tones.</P>
<P>"Let me tell you how I feel about the gift you have given me." You say and the bearman pulls his face out of his hands and looks at your with astonishment.</P>
<P>You begin to explain...</P></p>
