<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Anthony walks into his friend's new house. The place is huge and expensive. Anthony takes another puff of his cigarette, and walks into the living room where a huge plasma flat-screen TV is located. Anthony is an 18 year-old skater kid. He's got long wavy blond hair and brown eyes. He's very slim, but also toned, with defined abs, and almost no body hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude,&quot; He says, &quot;This is pretty sweet.&quot; James, his friend who owns the place, nods. James is also 18. He's got short black hair, with green eyes. He is slightly bigger than Anthony, but his muscles aren't as defined. He's always been more of a brainiac, but he's still in good shape.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I'm pretty happy that the bank approved my loan. Of course this compiled with what I owe for college is a steep loan indeed. But I'm sure I'll be able to pay it off.&quot; James comments.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, where you gonna look for a job?&quot; Anthony asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I'm sure I'll get money somehow. Besides, I have college still.&quot; James says critically. &quot;If you think the upstairs is cool, you should come down and check out the basement. That's where I keep my best toys.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright man,&quot; Anthony says as they head through the door and walk down the stairs, &quot;But i don't see what could top that TV.&quot;<br />
<br />
When they enter, they see the basement is a red painted room with another huge TV, video games, movies, surround sound system, a couch, and two recliner chairs. James sits in one and motions Anthony to sit in the other. As they sit, James turns on the massage machines in the recliners. They sit there and relax as the TV comes on automatically and starts playing a movie, and the surround sound kicks in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here man,&quot; James says handing Anthony a black leather collar. &quot;This'll relax your neck too.&quot; He passes the collar to Antony who takes it and puts it on without even thinking, his mind focused on the movie. He questions it in his mind, because it seems weird to put on collar that looks like a dog's. But he goes along with it anyway so he can get back to the movie. After a few minutes Anthony suddenly feels a sharp pain in the back of his neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow! What the hell?&quot; Anthony exclaims. He raises his arms behind his head to feel what had stabbed him, and expected to feel blood. Surprisingly his neck seemed fine, and the pain seemed to be coming from beneath the black collar. Anthony moves his hands around the the front of his neck where the collar's clasp is in an attempt to remove it. But he finds that his extremities begin to feel strange, clumsy.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is happened to me?&quot; He says as he tries to unlock the clasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you'll see.&quot; James replies, still sitting relaxed in his chair and watching the movie. Anthony's arms go completely limp, and drop to his sides. He tries to stand up but just falls forward onto the floor. He flails around for a minute or two, but finally comes to a stop as the last of his muscles quit responding. He's completely paralyzed from the waist down.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's going on man?&quot; Anthony yells, fear in his voice, &quot;Why can't I move?&quot; He can still talk fine, and look around. He sees James typing something into his laptop, then he closes it and gets up. Anthony hears a strange sound and looks over to the wall just in time to see a large full-length mirror sink back into the wall and then slide to the side, revealing a narrow passageway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay now, let's go.&quot; James says as he grabs Anthony's arms and drags him across the floor and into the small passage. Anthony is beginning to become worried about what's going on. One moment he was just sitting there watching a movie with James, and now he's completely paralyzed and being dragged down a mysterious hidden corridor. They're in a narrow hallway with just enough florescent lights to make it visible. Finally, minutes later after taking several turns, they arrive at a small door. James drops Anthony and punches a code into the key-pad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are you taking me?&quot; What's going on? Is this some kind of joke, or a surprise or something? 'Cause if it is you can tell me now.&quot; Anthony tries to find out what's in store for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll know soon enough.&quot; James replies cryptically. Anthony is getting more worried. James wouldn't do anything to him, or would he? Suddenly the door opens and Anthony is dragged into a large laboratory. The place is very clean, and full of computers and pieces of equipment that Anthony has never seen before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here we are, the hidden lair of an evil genius. Don't ya just love stereotypes? Now, let me explain a bit.&quot; James says as he continues to drag Anthony through the lab. &quot;You see, needless to say i haven't been telling you and the guys everything. This house didn't cost me a hundred grand, it cost millions. Aside from the construction, I also had to bribe several higher-ups to prevent any record of this part of my house existing.I even had to install my own water-powered generator so my house wouldn't use a suspicious amount of electricity. I also had to buy all this stuff. See, I've been secretly designing technology for the US military for a few years now. I've changed the way people fight wars, and now I've decided to help myself a bit. You, my friend, have the distinct honor of being the first human test subject for my latest and greatest invention.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What!?&quot; Anthony yells, 'You can't do that! What about human right huh? You can't just make me a test subject. I thought we were friends!&quot; James laughs at Anthony's remarks. &quot;What's so funny?&quot; Anthony asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; James explains, &quot;As far as human rights, There's an unexpected loophole in that. See, this invention of mine, whether you believe me or not, is designed to be able to manipulate the body of anyone wearing it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wearing it?&quot; Anthony asks, then he realizes what James meant. &quot;The collar?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A very astute observation.&quot; James replies, 'Anyway, that collar can alter your body's behavior. A wire connects to your spine, and millions of nano-wires latch onto your nerves. It also releases several million nano-bots into your blood stream. I can manipulate your behavioral patterns, as well as your DNA. You're literally like putty in my hands. So, human rights violation may not be a problem. Because you may not be a human much longer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha- that's insane, it's impossible! You wouldn't! Friends don't do stuff like that!&quot; Anthony yells, his fear turning to anger.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you see, we're about to become much closer friends than ever before.&quot; James says calmly, &quot;You really should be proud, this is a distinct honor. But don't be afraid. I've done DNA manipulation a hundred time and it works. All that's left is to decide what you will be. You're a friendly guy, and you always seem to be horny for the ladies. I've always pictured you as more of a canine, but which breed?&quot; Anthony's mind is blown. He must be joking, this can't be possible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if it is true, how can you just stand there and talk about turning me into an animal?&quot; Anthony asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy,&quot; James says, &quot;Because you won't be a normal animal, you'll be more suited to my liking. Aha, I'll make you a dalmatian. It's perfect...&quot; With that James goes over to a large machine and plugs his laptop into it. After a minute he downloads a file containing all the information he needs. He selects a few options to optimize the results.<br />
<br />
Collar #: 17<br />
Species: Canine, Dalmatian<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Orientation: Homosexual<br />
Age: 1 year<br />
Obedience factor: 5 out of 5<br />
Intelligence factor: 4 out of 5.<br />
Personality traits: Friendly, lustful, energetic, intelligent, animalistic, loving, house-broken.<br />
Maintain core personality?: Yes<br />
<br />
All the hundreds of gigabytes of information needed to make the change are downloaded from the collar's program on the laptop, into the giant machine. James then drags Anthony into a nearby Plexiglas containment zone that is about 10' by 15' and 7' high. Numerous machines stand by monitoring what's inside the cell.<br />
<br />
Anthony still can't believe what's happening to him. It's all just too much to take in. The door to the cell seals shut, leaving him alone in the room with James.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, let me go! I won't tell anybody. I don't wanna do this!&quot; Anthony pleads. Anthony is dropped near the middle of the room, which has a soft padded vinyl floor. Soon he feels James begin to rub all over his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell are you doing?&quot; Anthony asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here's the real kicker Anthony. The part that I'm going to enjoy.&quot; James says with a grin, &quot;You see, I'm going to make you into my obedient sex slave. You'll do exactly as I say, and enjoy it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT!?&quot; Anthony yells in anger and fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; James says, &quot;This invention will make you my perfect pet. You'll be very obedient, friendly, and horny as hell. You'll also be very smart for a dog. You really don't have much to worry about. Your personality will still be intact for the most part, just modified a bit. And you won't have to worry about much anymore. It's really better this way. All you have to do is please me, which isn't so hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck you man! Let me go!&quot; Anthony screams.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehehehe, I do love leaving you able to talk for this part. Enjoy it while you can.&quot; James coos. &quot;There's really nothing you can do. You hold on to this worthless sense of pride and independence. But in time you'll grow to enjoy pleasing me,and it will please you too. Now then, to the actual process...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll never do this! You can't do this to me!&quot; Anthony shouts in vain.<br />
<br />
&quot;It works faster if your heart rate is increased.&quot; James says calmly while Anthony continues his verbal assault. &quot;That way the hormones can be pumped through the body faster. And I know just the way to make your heart rate increase Anthony.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck you!&quot; He shouts.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, fuck you. hehehehehe...&quot; James says as he moves up behind Anthony. He picks Anthony's body up and leans Anthony's back against his chest. Then he reaches around and unbuckles the teen boy's belt, then unzips and drops his jeans, leaving only Anthony's boxers.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! No! You can't do this! I'll kill you!&quot; Anthony says, his words not slowing James down at all. James drops his own pants, then rubs the front of his boxers against the back of Anthony's. Anthony is powerless to stop what's happening. He feels James' rod hardening as he gets dry-humped. Once his cock is fully hard, James pulls down Anthony's boxers, exposing his tight ass and flaccid cock. James pulls a small tube of lube from his pocket and squirts some on his hand, and lubes up his eight inch hard rod. Anthony squints in disgust as he feels the cool lube getting smeared all over his practically hairless ass-crack.<br />
<br />
&quot;You bastard! You won't get away with this. I'll get away, and then you'll be sorry.&quot; Anthony continues to talk, although he knows it won't do any good. James reaches around and jerks his captive's cock, making it hard. Anthony suddenly realizes that he feels very strange. Something seems to be all out of whack in his body. His hands and feet feel very tingly. His mind is taken off that as he feels James' cock slide in between his ass-cheeks. James also continues to jerk him off, and moves his other hand to tweak Anthony's stiff man-tits.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're screwed man.&quot; James says teasing him, &quot;You're gonna take it from me and there's nothing you can do about it.&quot; James takes his hand off of Anthony's cock and lines his own up with the skater's tight ass. Anthony sits there helpless and unable to move. He's about to say something, but his voice breaks into a yelp of pain as his virgin ass is quickly penetrated. Anthony can't even move, let alone fight what's happening to him. He groans in pain as James works up a rhythm of pounding his rump.<br />
<br />
&quot;oohhhh, sooo tight.&quot; James says, &quot;Tight like a vice.&quot; Anthony can't believe this is happening. He can feel every inch of his captor's tool sliding into him, pulling out, and going back in. James pushes the skater boy forward onto his chest, then starts banging his hole doggy style.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh-ahh-fuck ngh!&quot; Grunting as he gets raped in the ass, Anthony is completely humiliated. The inside of his anus feels like it's on fire, the pain is too much. The intensity of the moment makes his heart pound hard, while James pounds his tight rump with abandon. After what seems like an eternity of having a cock thrust into him, Anthony yelps in pain again as the cock inside him goes balls-deep. Then he feels a warm liquid pour into him, filling his inner cavity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that was quite fun&quot; James says as he quickly jerks his large cock out of Anthony, making the boy groan in shock and pain. &quot;I'll be back for more later.&quot; He says as he gets up and puts his pants back on. Anthony can't talk, he can't think of anything to say. He just lays there in defeat, not speaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you'll excuse me,&quot; James says as he heads to the glass door, &quot;I'm going to go pretend to take you home, and clean up all signs of your DNA around here. I won't be back for some time, so enjoy your last hours as a human.&quot; With that he closes the door and leaves.<br />
<br />
Anthony lays there for fifteen minutes before even attempting to move. When he tries, he is surprised to find he can. His heart is still pounding. He tries to get up, but falls back down, then he attempts to hit the button to open the door. Then he notices his hand isn't human any more. It looks almost exactly like a dog's paw. Looking down he sees his feet are the same. Shocked by this discovery, he starts freaking out. He notices that white and black fur is spreading up his arms quickly, his high heart rate speeding the transformation. Then his spine cracks and starts to reform, he feels his insides mixing around. The sensation is so horrible, because of the pain, and because he can't stop it. His knees reverse, his feet stretch out and become more canine. Fur spreads up his back, which has become so contorted and reshaped that it forces him onto all-fours like a dog. His chest expands and his waist contracts. His ears raise to the top of his head, and become canine ears. His whole body is canine except his head. He screams in pain as his face pushes out into a muzzle, his teeth becoming longer and sharped. His cries then change into the barking sounds of a dog. His ass cheeks shrink back and disappear, leaving his anus open to the cool air. A tail pushes out of his rump, and forms fur slowly. Finally Anthony feels incredibly aroused as his human cock gets extremely hard, then changes. It becomes more pointed at the end, and a silky smooth sheath covers it and pulls it up next to his body. He feels a tingly sensation as fur covers his balls.<br />
<br />
The transformation is complete. What was a normal teenage skater kid just twenty minutes ago, is now a Dalmatian pup about 1 year old. Anthony is in a panic. He tries to speak but all that comes out is barking. Finally he calms down and sits there. He thinks about his life, his family, how can he ever go back? Would they know who he is? Then a funny feeling comes over him. Some part of his memory becomes foggy, like he can't grasp it any more. He tries hard, but it's gone. Gradually over the period of an hour more and more things seem to slip away. He realizes with horror that he's losing his human memories. He tries to fight it, tries to remember things he did. But slowly it slips away, where he lives, where he went to school, his family, everything. He can hardly remember that he was human at all. Finally all he can really remember is that his name is Anthony. Then more parts of who he is start to fade, his rebellious nature, his objection to being a dog, on and on. By the end of two hours, the mental transformation is complete. His brain has been re-arranged to make him the ideal pet, and his greatest desire is to please his Master.<br />
<br />
When James opens the cell door, he finds a completely transformed Dalmatian there to greet him. Anthony trots up to his Master and looks up at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see you've had plenty of time to get adjusted my new pet.&quot; James says with a grin on his face. Anthony can understand the words James is speaking, but he doesn't really know what he means by that. But his Master seems happy, so he's happy. James walks over to the pile of Anthony's old clothes. They still smell like him as a human. Anthony can tell the smell is somehow familiar, but he can't place it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on boy,&quot; James says as he gathers the clothes, &quot;Let's go upstairs. You won't be needing these anymore.&quot; He says as he drops Anthony's old clothes into an incinerator.  The dog trots happily along beside his new Master as they head out the hidden passage door and upstairs. Anthony still has a weird feeling about himself, but he knows that he's happier as a dog. And he looks forward to more good times with his Master.</p>
