<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jay Kallum was easily one of the most popular students in the college - being in the student government, playing football on the competitive team, and being by all accounts a handsome, good looking young man would do that. Jay stood six foot four inches tall, weighing in at 215 lbs, and would easily be mistaken for more of a bodybuilder than a college sports player. Still, he had to keep his body in a less bulky state for the sport, something he wasn&#39;t keen on but agreed to do anyway.<br />
<br />
His curly dark hair and intense, hunter-like blue eyes made him quite the engaging looking person, and most people who saw him knew just from a meeting he was ambitious, just slightly amoral, and driven to success. All things that marked Jay for a future in politics, which he heartily embraced. &quot;I&#39;ll be the buffest man to ever enter the White House.&quot;<br />
<br />
As of now he was just finishing up some instructions and plans for the upcoming school festival, an activity he was intent on completing - but which got interrupted when he heard a noise outside. He swore he hadn&#39;t made any booty calls for any of his numerous girlfriends (power came with privilege), but instead he wound up seeing a strange little box resting on his doorstep. He shrugged his shoulders and got up to go get it. Best to retrieve these things before local idiots decided to pilfer it.<br />
<br />
Once he had the box he tore it open on his way back to his desk, and found himself looking at the thin disc form of the Chronivac. He said in a curious tone, &quot;...Chronivac...? Haven&#39;t heard of this brand of...well, anything. Let&#39;s see what you&#39;re all about.&quot;<br />
<br />
For some reason his attention was on the new little device, and even when he tried to return to work, he found his attention irretrievably seized by the Chronivac. So he brought up his work laptop and decided to get this over with. Sliding the disc in, he hoped this wouldn&#39;t just be some stupid prank or idiotic MMO for those content to whittle their lives away. In between his workouts, his plans, and his vibrant life besides he just didn&#39;t have the time.<br />
<br />
When the computer screen went black and then turned to a white and blue checkerboard design, he adjusted the screen a bit and dialed down the volume in case of screamer or bizarre video. What he ended up seeing was substantially more bizarre. He saw a precise, down to the smallest detail 3D rendered nude model of himself, which really got him looking in more closely. &quot;And how the hell did this thing access this photo?&quot;<br />
<br />
He wondered if it somehow accessed old explicit photos, and decided if it did he was throwing it out posthaste. But that was when he noted the presence of several menus and stat lines. He decided to look into that later. This merited his attention.<br />
<br />
Jay pursed his lip as he reviewed his stats, &quot;Black hair, 215.6 lbs, 7.85 inch penis...wait a second, I swear I&#39;m exactly eight inches!&quot; He didn&#39;t know why he got so immaturely aggravated by that frank number, and after a moment shook his head...but noted it seemed the number could be changed. He wondered if this would edit the photo in there like some kind of lewd virtual pet or something. What an odd invention if that was the entire purpose.<br />
<br />
He added an extra inch on there to his tool, and figured he always wanted to be blond, so he changed the figure&#39;s hair to bright platinum blond. When it said duration of change, he put in just a minute, and sat back once he got it started...<br />
<br />
And near immediately grunted as he felt a pleasant tingling sensation in his crotch. It immediately reminded the football QB of the time his ex-girlfriend gave him a blowjob before a game to cool his head. He moaned outloud and felt a tingly sensation spread to his head. Trying not to react, Jay leaned back and just enjoyed how his dick felt - damn but that was incredible. <br />
<br />
Before long though, Jay started to wonder, and then turned to look at his room mirror. He gasped in shock - no more was he black haired, he now had that exact shade of blond hair. Peeling off his pants and boxers, he sat there in just his shirt and saw an inch longer manhood. He grinned - realizing now that this thing was more than just a photo editor. It really could change people!<br />
<br />
Damn but this unlocked so many possibilities, Jay thought. So many things he wanted to explore and experiment with.<br />
<br />
He took off his shirt next and abandoned any thought of finishing his work at least in the next few hours. Jay thought about calling his current &quot;steady&quot; girlfriend up for an encounter, but decided he could just enjoy himself by himself for now. The footballer went back to his laptop and grinned.<br />
<br />
So many possibilities...<br />
<br />
Remembering an ex-girlfriend regaling him with her stories of how it felt as a girl to achieve pleasure, Jay decided to introduce a few elements of such, but not go all the way. After all, he was far too attached to his masculine attributes and manhood to really go that far. Looking at the options, he decided how he&#39;d do this. Gender could be pulled down and changed in percentiles - and it seemed there were some hints. Only at 90% female would he lose his dick, for example.<br />
<br />
So he decided to go ahead and slide, specifying he wanted to keep his muscles, and set the duration for ten minutes. Jay figured if he didn&#39;t like his experimentation he could just hit &quot;Revert to Start&quot; and undo it. Setting the slider to 40% female, 60% male, Jay felt an immediate feeling like a punch in his stomach, grunting and breathing slowly to get him thru this.<br />
<br />
He felt his waist narrow and his hips widen, body hair across his form pulling in and vanishing, his skin becoming so much more sensitive. Jay gasped as he felt his chest pushing out more - looking more than just like ironclad pecs. They pushed out more, developed more into breast-like forms, and honestly? If this was how mammaries felt, Jay knew why his girlfriends broke out moaning at his ministrations.<br />
<br />
Chuckling in carnal amusement, Jay felt his hands slightly become more dainty, feet likewise, and as he bit his lip he felt the lips were somewhat thicker. He loved this so far! There was a slight thinning in certain spots to allow for a more feminine bodily form, but his specification preserved his muscular form if in a new shape. Jay noted his hair grew out longer slightly, becoming softer to the touch.<br />
<br />
He even saw his face get slightly rounder - more pretty...and that was that.<br />
<br />
Getting up, Jay smirked and felt his newly grown bust with the perverse intent of a 24 year old man - for once he had his own boobs to play with, and play he would. He honestly hoped his girlfriends didn&#39;t mind a booty call with him like this instead of his usual. Because with this new sensitive skin he was absolutely loving it!<br />
<br />
Flexing for the mirror, Jay noted how his bum looked now, structured more like one of his girlfriends&#39; asses...which made him check on his manhood. He looked down and noted with a slight frown he&#39;d lost an inch and a half in the course of transforming like this, and his balls looked slightly smaller. But just a touch at his dick made Jay almost fall over from how good it felt!<br />
<br />
Deciding he needed to make some choices, Jay decided...</p>
