<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty and Kent were walking down the hall of the school, talking about classes, teachers, and exams. Ty noticed that Kent has a picture of a stock racing car on the cover of one of his notebooks, which he was holding in one of his arms.<br />
<br />
“Hey Kent, that’s one cool picture! Where did you get it?” Ty asked him, as he pointed to the notebook.<br />
<br />
“Oh, that?” Kent chuckled. “It’s a Chevy car, which is run in the NASCAR races a lot!”<br />
<br />
“Wow… That looks great!”<br />
<br />
“I only buy notebooks, which have pictures of race cars on their covers!” Kent added. “I love NASCAR races!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, really? I didn’t realize you were such a race car fan!” Ty noted surprisingly.<br />
<br />
As soon as Kent and Ty walked out the door, Ty realized that Kent became a little troubled and quiet. Luckily, Ty was able to intercept his thoughts and detect his feelings. He realized that Kent wanted to ask him to change him.<br />
<br />
“Hey Kent… If you want me to change you, just ask! You got nothing to be ashamed of!” Ty assured his best friend, as they walked out on the parking lot. “What do you want me to change you into?”<br />
<br />
“You know…” Kent began. “I-I’d love to feel, what it would be like, to change into a race car!”<br />
<br />
“Well, I can arrange that!” Ty cheered. “You need to show me, what you want me to change you into. Pick one of the race cars…”<br />
<br />
Kent set his backpack on the ground, and unzipped the top zipper. Then, he pulled out five other notebooks, each of them containing different pictures of NASCAR racing cars on their covers! After he spent a few moments, staring intently at the pictures, he then put four back into the backpack, and gave one to Ty.<br />
<br />
“Here… This one…” Kent pointed out. “This is a 2006 Chevy Monte Carlo SS… I love this car! Can you transform me into this?”<br />
<br />
“Sure… Go stand right there, in that empty spot in the parking lot!” Ty instructed Kent. He immediately obeyed, and dropped the backpack on the floor, before he walked over to the empty spot in the parking lot.<br />
<br />
Ty stared intently at the picture on the notebook’s cover, before he closed his eyes and began to concentrate.<br />
<br />
“Oohh mannnnn….” Kent groaned, as he was suddenly overcome by an intense tingling feeling, which surged through his entire body! Luckily, Ty had first made all his clothes disappear and magically appear on the floor beside him, so that they would not be torn by the transformation.<br />
<br />
Kent’s skin started to change, as his smooth flesh became hardened like sheet metal. His pale skin became pale white, making him appear like a ghost! Then his body started to deform rapidly, so that he gained the appearance of a stock racing car!<br />
<br />
Kent’s torso began to grow longer and wider, forming the body of the car, which included the doors, the hood, the fender, and the rear. Glass magically appeared in place, where the windshield and the doors’ windows were supposed to be. Kent became square and then rectangular, with his arms, his feet, and his head slowly disappearing, as they became part of the stock car.<br />
<br />
Four black, radial tires formed out of the white, rectangular body, followed by the hood and then the powerful V-8 cylinder engine, which was covered by it. Next came the interior of the cabin, which was made of fine, black leather. The seats formed, and then the dashboard which contained all the necessary gauges and instruments. The gear box appeared between the two front seats, with the manual shift for all six gears. The speedometer and odometer formed on the dashboard, along with the latest and newest technology.<br />
<br />
Ty opened his eyes and smiled, as he witnessed the incredible transformation while it was still occurring right in front of him!<br />
<br />
As Kent continued to change, the unimposing rectangular metal was slowly being molded into the chassis and frame of a 2006 Chevy Monte Carlo, which had a white, metallic body and a black, rear spoiler. The fender contained large, bright spot lights, which were powerful enough to illuminate the road before it, and was capable of lighting a significant distance in front of the car. <br />
<br />
Just like any other stock racing car, many decals appeared on the sides, the hood and the fender of the car, containing logos and lettering for numerous automotive suppliers. Stunning, bright and red flames appeared painted on the sides of the body and the doors, portraying large flames which ran from the front of the car to the back. These were symbolic of the flames, which came out of the exhaust of a rocket!<br />
<br />
The mighty engine had a remarkable top speed of two-hundred miles per hour, which was without the rescriter plate. Furthermore, the side of the vehicle had a large exhaust pipe, which allowed for the gas fumes to escape as the engine was revved to full speed. The Black Ducktail Spoiler was positioned on the trunk in the rear, and the windows were formed from rough, strong plexi-glass, which protected the driver from the elements.<br />
<br />
Lastly, steel roll-bars formed over the roof of the interior cabin, which protected the driver in case of a roll. The car was completely equipped to take the driver on the most comfortable ride at the highest speeds attainable by this type and size of engine! It was now able to provide the most thrilling ride to anyone who loved speed and mobility!<br />
<br />
“Wow… Look at you now!” Ty grinned, as he approached his creation, which was standing on the empty parking lot.<br />
<br />
Ty allowed Kent to be able to speak, through the speakers in the car.<br />
<br />
“Whoa… I must be dreaming!”<br />
<br />
Ty opened the door and climbed into the low driver’s seat. Even though he didn’t possess his driver’s license yet, he knew that there was no need to drive the car, because it could drive on its own!<br />
<br />
“Let’s go and take these wheels for a spin, alright?” Kent laughed, as he allowed the door to slam shut. “You had better strap on the seat belt, Ty!”<br />
<br />
Ty snapped the buckle for the seat belt in place. As soon as he was buckled in, the engine started, completely on its own!<br />
<br />
VROOOOOOMMMM! It roared, as the powerful engine came to life.<br />
<br />
“Hang on, Ty!” he heard Kent’s voice say, through the speakers.<br />
<br />
The back wheels suddenly kicked in, putting the race car in motion. The car traveled out of the school’s parking lot and onto the street. Then, Ty noticed the gear shift into second, with the engine roaring at a higher pitch. Then, the car shifted into third and then into fourth gears, traveling faster each time!<br />
<br />
“Whooooeeeee!!” Ty cheered, as he thoroughly enjoyed the ride in the race car, which was actually his best friend, Kent! “Welcome to the world of NASCAR, Kent!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah…” Kent cheered, before the engine revved even more. VROOOOOOMMMM!<br />
<br />
“Kent… You haven’t told me; when you wanted me to change you back…” Ty pointed out.<br />
<br />
“Not for a couple of days, Ty!” the car cheered back. “Not for a couple of days… I’m enjoying this too much…”<br />
<br />
Ty just sat back and relaxed, as his Kent-racing car took him to the highway before him, and headed straight west. It was going to be a nice, long ride…</p>
