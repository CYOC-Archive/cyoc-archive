<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You know who we haven&#39;t seen in forever?&quot; Amanda asked as John walked back inside. <br />
<br />
John shook his head. &quot;Uhh... No?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nickie and Ron,&quot; she answered. &quot;I just got off the phone with Nickie and she was really wanting to get out of the house. It&#39;s just been so long...&quot; Amanda got up nice and close, pressing her body against his. She could feel the excitement rising in him. &quot;And then we can have some fun afterwards too.&quot;<br />
<br />
A sudden upturn of the sides of John&#39;s mouth was enough to know she&#39;d won. &quot;If you put it that way...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad you understand,&quot; Amanda ran her hand up and down John&#39;s bulge. &quot;Now go get cleaned up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will do,&quot; John said. As he passed his wife, she gave him a firm slap to his bottom. Part of him almost wondered if she&#39;d follow him into the bathroom. The way she bit her bottom lip in anticipation seemed to show just how raring to go she actually was. But then she&#39;d pulled out her own phone and dialed up the baby sitter.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
John stepped out of the shower and started to get dress. He loved the way he looked in his nicer clothes. They hugged his body perfectly. Tight enough to show off his firm chest and arms, while still being comfortable. His shoulders filled the sleeves and he had trouble buttoning the top button of his shirt, but it only drew his eyes more on him. A devilish smirk filled his face. He stared at the device that had given him this body. &#39;More?&#39; he wondered as he picked it up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost ready?&quot; Amanda called to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh.. Yeah!&quot; John called back. He put the device into his pocket.<br />
<br />
Amanda was already at the front door. &quot;Oh Kelly! I&#39;m so glad you could make it!&quot; She leaned out to give the baby sitter a hug. &quot;I know it&#39;s last minute, but we really wanted to get out tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh it&#39;s no problem. I&#39;m just glad you&#39;re letting Conner come over too,&quot; Kelly said.<br />
<br />
John stopped himself on the bottom step. &quot;Conner? Conner Walsh?&quot; <br />
<br />
Kelly cleared her throat. &quot;Uh-huh?&quot; she stepped inside with Conner just behind her. It wasn&#39;t that Conner was a trouble maker. Just that he was often around trouble makers. His tall lanky body made him easy to spot. And then the smell of pot made it easier even without seeing him. It just seemed like everyone around him would get in trouble for skipping classes or spending too much time in the bathroom.  &quot;It&#39;s alright. Right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course!&quot; Amanda said. &quot;Of course it is.&quot; She elbowed John in the side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; John choked out. &quot;I just didn&#39;t expect him. That&#39;s all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you know the drill. Food&#39;s in the kitchen and then the boys are---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;MOM!&quot; one of them screamed. <br />
<br />
Amanda forced a tight lipped smile. &quot;One second,&quot; she said, then rushed upstairs. Kelly was right behind her. <br />
<br />
Conner was still standing in the doorway, staring at his phone.  It was one of the students the coach really never got along with. With some of the trouble makers, he was able to convince them with sports. Relate to them in at least some kind of way. But with Conner, he just didn&#39;t care about anything. At 20, he was already starting to gain weight. Most likely because of how much pot he was doing. The smell, though softer than it had been in high school, was still abundantly clear. John wondered how Kelly could go with someone who had such an abysmal future. &quot;Can I come in?&quot; he said with a bit of snark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; John motioned him to come inside. The younger man plopped himself down onto the couch and put his feet up on the counter. &quot;You working anywhere?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No?&quot; Conner snorted. He hadn&#39;t even looked up from his phone.<br />
<br />
John felt his eyes narrow. A wave of anger that had been building since the guy was in high school starting to overflow. &quot;Right,&quot; John said. Then pulled out the Chronivac. &#39;Conner is a full time personal trainer at the local gym. He works out all the time and uses his membership to get as big as possible. He refuses to take on female cliental. He tells people it&#39;s so his girlfriend won&#39;t get jealous but it&#39;s obvious to everyone that he wants to build his online fanbase.&#39; John paused for a second before he hit enter. He hadn&#39;t noticed a whole list of options listed right below the enter button. <br />
<br />
Self: &#39;Aware/Unaware.&#39;<br />
Subject: &#39;Aware/Unaware.&#39;<br />
World: &#39;Aware/Unaware.&#39;<br />
<br />
It caused John to pause for a second. He wondered what someone else would do if they were aware that they suddenly changed. Besides self, all of them defaulted to unaware. If John didn&#39;t recognize that something had then what would even be the point. But even as he changed subject to aware, John felt an urge to add one more thing before hitting enter. &#39;Conner does everything I say.&#39; A simple fail safe if something were to go too wrong. Then he hit enter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Conner shifted in his seat. It was the first time that he looked up from his phone. His attention turned to his body. &quot;The hell?&quot; Looking down at his body, it obviously felt different. His thin arms were bulking up. Strong sinewy muscles were starting to form under his skin. Blood pumped through his body faster. The veins bulged out of his skin. &quot;Bro? You seeing this?&quot; he turned to John for some kind of affirmation. &quot;Bro?&quot; he repeated. It didn&#39;t seem like the word he wanted to use.<br />
<br />
But the transformation didn&#39;t stop as more and more weight added to his thin frame. Being so tall it was always really hard for guys like that to gain size. But he was doing just fine. The band shirt that he was wearing turned into a more breezy underarmor sleeveless shirt. A bit of his pecs hung out as the shirt seemed to pull in to show them off. His arms bulged with power. Thick biceps and defined horseshoe triceps made his upper body look massive. But it was his wide shoulders that really added an intimidating factor. He must have gained nearly 50 pounds of pure muscle. <br />
<br />
Conner shifted in his seat as a hand groped his sensitive nipples. Blood was clearly rushing somewhere else and he wasn&#39;t sure how to react. His eyes darted to John, hoping he wouldn&#39;t notice. &quot;Coach? Did you do this?&quot; Conner tilted his head. &quot;Coach?&quot; Again the word was so foreign, yet it came out of his mouth like it was nothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did,&quot; John confirmed. &quot;But here&#39;s the thing. You&#39;re going to start changing your act. Kelly&#39;s a good girl and doesn&#39;t need some waste of space who takes advantage of her.&quot; He leaned forward for emphasis. &quot;Got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
A snort blew out of Conner&#39;s nose. &quot;And what if I say no?&quot;<br />
<br />
John was glad he&#39;d made his contingency plan. &quot;Get down on your knees.&quot; Conner&#39;s body listened. John stood up and stroked his cock. &quot;Open your mouth.&quot; Conner&#39;s eyes went wide. Again he did exactly what the other man said. Even as John pulled out his dick, he couldn&#39;t seem to move from his position. &quot;Go on... Suck it,&quot; John ordered.<br />
<br />
Conner leaned forward. His mouth took the whole cock inside. &quot;Enjoy it. Really show me that you love taking cock,&quot; John ordered. As he did so, moans and groans came from the other man. His face filled with pleasure as he tried his best to please the coach. The thick cock filled his mouth completely, going all the way to the back of his throat. &quot;So good...&quot; John&#39;s firm hand gripped the top of Conner&#39;s head and squeezed. He felt his balls pull up close to his body as they unloaded into Conner&#39;s mouth. &quot;Swallow.&quot; His hand rotated to the bottom of Conner&#39;s mouth and he spoke right up in his face as he squeezed. &quot;All of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?!&quot; Conner looked around wildly. He was more concerned about the mess he&#39;d made in his own short. The stain was spreading out and he could almost smell it. &quot;Shit bro. What the fuck?!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Language,&quot; John tutted. &quot;Don&#39;t curse around my children.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Buh-ro,&quot; Conner forced out. The common jock word still felt unnatural. &quot;What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You listen to me now. Like I said earlier, Kelly deserves a good man. You break her heart and then I turn you into the dog I know you are. Got it?&quot; John turned to his phone again. An evil idea running through it. &#39;I have a costume wolf&#39;s tail with a butt plug attached to it in my hand.&#39; As soon as he hit enter the long gray tail appeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;What-- What&#39;s that for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Put it on,&quot; John said. Conner&#39;s hands grabbed it and then shoved the hard plastic into his rear. He let out a heavy grunt, falling forward onto all fours. &quot;You like the feeling.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bro... What the heck?&quot;<br />
<br />
John leaned down. His hand clenched Conner&#39;s masculine jaw. &quot;It&#39;s just a reminder for the rest of the night. After that, I don&#39;t really care. But if you continue to act out, I&#39;ll make it far worse. Got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Woof,&quot; Conner barked. He didn&#39;t even realize what he&#39;d done until it was over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda came down with Kelly and the kids. &quot;Ready?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Let&#39;s get going,&quot; John said. &quot;You all have fun tonight.&quot;</p>
