<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sophia and Alex were walking through the hallway until they found a big cardboard box. “Ohh, let&#39;s see what&#39;s inside here.” Said Sophia. Before Alex could protest she already opened it and freaked out because of what she found. The box was full of ultra realistic dolls in various sizes, ages and genders. They were incredible detailed, with body hair, long nails, genitals or any other stuff that regular dolls don&#39;t use to have. Additionally, each doll was completely different like if they were made one by one.<br />
<br />
Sophia took a few with her hands while Alex approached and see the box&#39;s content from behind her. “Don’t they look so awesome?” She asked holding up one of them to Alex, he just shrugged. “It&#39;s like they&#39;re real people, but tiny!”<br />
<br />
“And plastic and soulless. It&#39;s kinda creepy but you can keep one if you want, I’m gonna look for something less weird and more interesting.” Alex said walking over to hallway.<br />
<br />
Sophia huffed and looked inside the box to find a doll she would like to keep. There was a lot of pretty women and girls, some cute guys and even, a few dogs. She was getting so excited until she found a pair of dolls that got her attention. “Alex, you must see this.” She says out loud while she showed her brother what she had found. “These ones look exactly like mom and dad!”<br />
<br />
“Oh really?” Alex responded nonchalantly while he turned around. At the same time, he glanced a big burly man coming from behind his sister. He was wearing a staff uniform and sunglasses. “Oh crap! Sophy run!!” He yelled at her but unfortunately it was too late because the man had already captured her with his big arms. He tried to help her kicking and punching the guy but he bothered at all. Sophia was trying to get free but it also was pointless. Then two more men came from behind and Alex knew he had no choice but run.<br />
<br />
Fortunately for him, those men weren&#39;t too fast or too smart, because he easily managed to hide behind a metal door in a corner. He was too worried about his sister that he was wondering how to rescue her, facing those men wasn&#39;t an option so he decided to look around to see if he can find a tool or a weapon that could be useful. However what he found was completely different from what he expected. The room where he was looked very futuristic, kinda alien, and totally unrelated to the luxury and old-fashioned hotel where they are.<br />
<br />
It has a lot of wires and ducts on the walls, weird light orbs and something that looked like a extraterrestrial tanning bed. He was looking around when he heard some steps approaching him. He thought it could be those men, so he quickly hid behind a big pillar that resembles a giant blue vein. Except for those light orbs, the room was pretty dark, so he thought he wouldn&#39;t be seen.<br />
<br />
When the men arrived, Sophia was unconscious on one of them&#39;s shoulders. Alex wondered if they hurt her, she was sedated or she just fainted after do much pressure. Anyway, he can&#39;t do anything but watch how they put her inside the alien tanning bed and leave. When he made sure that they won&#39;t come back, Alex came out of his place and tried to free his sister. Unfortunately, that tanning bed was completely sealed and there wasn&#39;t any visible way to open it. He tried to find a button, a lever or something but there&#39;s wasn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes, he could hear someone approaching. It didn&#39;t sound like those men steps but he still hide again behind the pillar. When the metal door opened, two tall and lean alien creatures came in. They were dressed like scientist with big bald heads, glasses and gloves. Their exposed skin seemed blueish but Alex wasn&#39;t sure because of the poor lights in the place. They moved next to the device where Sophia was trapped and several holographic screens appeared around them.<br />
<br />
“This is one of the two subjects that had been found recently. According to the data it&#39;s a female human, 12 years old. The other one hasn&#39;t been identified but it&#39;s presumably a male human on the same age.” Alex could heard them saying. Their voices sound so similar that he didn&#39;t knew when one or the other were talking. “What’s the next text on our schedule? Time acceleration. We have already tested it on dogs and rats but their short lifespan has caused the test subjects to die. Humans have a larger lifespan so we expect they could support the process.”<br />
<br />
Alex was watching how those aliens moved fast their long skinny fingers through the screens around them while they talk. A brief moment later, the tanning bed raised from its place and took a more vertical position. Then, a bright blue light started to emanate from it and Alex couldn&#39;t resist the urge to do something. Without a weapon or anything he could use, his only idea was to take his sandals off and using like gloves. He remembered a few boxing lessons he took with his father and tried to put them on use.<br />
<br />
He jumped out from his spot and fell on one of those aliens, the holographic screens around them disappeared while Alex and the alien were on the ground. Alex was hitting the creature as fast and strong as he could, fortunately for him they seemed pretty weak because it can&#39;t do anything to defend itself. However, the other alien took a gun like device and immediately shot at him. A weird green light surrounded Alex and he could notice that the world around him was getting bigger and bigger. In fact, he was the one who was getting smaller until he was only 5 inches tall.<br />
<br />
His clothes didn&#39;t shrink with him, so he was trapped inside them but the alien quickly managed to take him out and hold him like a toy with his long skinny fingers. “This must be the male human that was with the female human. Using the shrinking beam was a good idea but we loose the chance to experiment with this subject.” Alex tried to get free from the alien&#39;s hand but it didn&#39;t flinched. If he can&#39;t get free from a weak creature like this, Alex immediately realized that he was completely helpless.<br />
<br />
“Time acceleration test is complete. Let&#39;s see the result on the test subject.” One alien said and Alex noticed that those creatures doesn&#39;t even have a mouth to talk. Using the holographic screens around them they opened the tanning bed and like in sci-fi movies a lot of smoke and blue light covered the area for a brief moment before they could see what it&#39;s inside. When Alex managed to open his eyes he got astounded by what he saw. Instead of his 12 years old sister, there was a 30-something years old woman. Of course he knew it was his sister, but he can&#39;t still believe it.<br />
<br />
She was a whole foot taller, with long hair past her shoulders and lean arms and legs. Her clothes seemed pretty tight on her bigger frame and they seemed old, like if they were way more older too. Alex blushed a little when he noticed that his sister had developed decent C-cup breasts and a wide waist that can be barely covered with her tattered clothes. He was getting turned on by looking at his sister and he can&#39;t avoid but feel really awkward because of that. He thought she looked a lot like their mother which was something even more awkward for him.<br />
<br />
“The test was a success. The female human vital signs are still stable and their body development is satisfactory. We must procede to test their body functions.” One alien said while he moved his long skinny fingers through Sophia&#39;s skin. “What do we do with this one? I can&#39;t do the testing while I&#39;m holding it with in my hand.” The other alien said while he raised Alex a little. “We can test the time acceleration on him too. We have never made a test on a shrunk subject, so the result could be very interesting and useful, and in the case he can&#39;t bear it, we already have a successful subject to study.”<br />
<br />
After hearing that, Alex got in panic. What do they mean with ‘he can&#39;t bear it’? Could he die or something? Are they going to do with him the same thing they did to Sophia? He wasn&#39;t a lab rat and he don&#39;t want to be anybody&#39;s guinea pig. He was struggling a lot, desperately trying to get free but it was useless. A weird machine came from the roof and took Sophia out of the tanning bed. She was above him and he can&#39;t avoid to blush when he watched his sister&#39;s bigger and rounder butt which was partially exposed because of her now small shorts.<br />
<br />
Alex was so distracted by that, that he didn&#39;t notice the aliens had already put him in until they closed the device. Unlike his sister, the bed was huge for him but he still can&#39;t move freely due to a strange magnetic force that kept him on his position. He realized that can&#39;t do anything but pray that the test won&#39;t kill him. After a few seconds of high tension, the blue lights started to covered the place and he could feel something happening with him.</p>
