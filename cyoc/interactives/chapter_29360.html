<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam waited a few minutes before he headed out himself.  He felt bad for telling Max to go by himself, but he needed time away from him to get his head strait something wasn't right and he knew he couldn't trust him even if he wanted to.<br />
<br />
Sam left the hotel and started walking down the streets passing unfamiliar sight after unfamiliar site, till he got tired and sat down.<br />
&quot;Sammy!&quot; Sam heard his voice called, it sounded like Dean, and urgent.  Sam jumped off the bench and started following the shouts, pushing his way past the crowd of people, till he came across the front of a building... the tunnel of love.<br />
&quot;Dean!&quot; Sam yells into the building with no answer &quot;Come on Dean its me this isn't funny  come out!&quot; once again to no reply.<br />
<br />
Sam sighed and went inside, the attraction was deserted no one was inside, but Sam could see a light at the end of the tunnel.  It wasn't that far away there was probably a walkway at the side of the river he could walk past. Jumping over the small swan boat so classically used in these attractions he found a path that followed the river down towards the light. <br />
<br />
Taking his first step down the damp concrete path a fog started to roll in across the water filling the air with a strangely alluring scent.  Sam breathed in deeply as the fog became denser.  It smelled so good it almost made him feel... Sam's train of thought interrupted as he felt his dick twitch.  Damn this fog was turning me on Sam thought to himself as he took another big whiff adjusting his jeans as they started feeling tight.  Sam kept walking the narrow path, the fog nearly leaving him sightless.  Sam's breathing started becoming heavier, whatever this fog was it was making incredibly horny.  As Sam walked he felt his dick push past the elastic band of his briefs within seconds he felt a damp spot form on the waistband.  Sam moaned as he felt himself somehow get harder.  He felt like he was going to burst, but every time he felt like we was about to he seemed to just get even harder.  As Sam found his hand sliding across a metal door.<br />
&quot;About time -ooh!&quot; Sam started saying as he felt his dick twitch again pressing into him.  Strange Sam thought as he opened the door it almost felt like his dick had grown.  <br />
<br />
Sam walked into the dimly lit room.  The room seemed to stink more of the fog.<br />
&quot;Shiiiit!&quot; Sam said as his dick twitched again. he wasn't sure he could take much more of this.  A light flashed causing Sam to stagger back in surprise tripping and falling into a chair the appeared behind him.  Straps suddenly sprang out of the chair holding his chest wrists and ankles in place.<br />
&quot;Hey whats going on? Dean!?&quot; Sam yelled into the blinding light as his eyes were adjusting.<br />
&quot;I'm sorry but he won't be able to help you right now hes a bit busy getting into trouble again... two nights in a row hes quite the mischievous one.&quot; a voice said behind the light, a familiar voice<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; Sam said squinting to see who the figure was.  The dark shape moved in front of the light eclipsing it &quot;Max?&quot;<br />
&quot;Could be you never know in this place do ya?&quot; Max said<br />
&quot;What are you talking about help me out of here!&quot; Sam yelled again<br />
&quot;I'm starting to like this place already, you see you managed to stumble upon a trickster city.  You normally would just get whats coming to you and then some, but a while back you really pissed off one of us and the word spread out.  Normally we leave you hunters alone, kind of a mutual arrangement you clean up the filth on our side and we do the same for your kind, but you boys started a war you are not going to win!&quot; Max said sitting down in a chair that appeared in front of Sam<br />
&quot;A trickster city? you've got to be kidding how many of you are there?&quot; Sam asked<br />
&quot;Could be one could be thousands you never know who is really standing next to you in this place!&quot; Max said getting up again<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you planning on doing to me?!&quot; Sam barked at Max<br />
&quot;Do? I already did what I'm going to do to you today.&quot; Max said.  Sam breathed in preparing to barrage Max with another verbal assault, but as he breathed in his dick twitched again.  Sam heard the small pop of  the metal button of his jeans coming off then felt something slimy push up his chest dampening his shirt<br />
&quot;Holy shit!&quot; Sam yelled seeing his massively expanded tool for the first time &quot;You! why did you do this to me?!&quot; Sam continued yelling trying not to gasp from the increased pleasure he was feeling.<br />
&quot;Consider it a welcoming gift to help you be less shy around people&quot; Max said laughing<br />
&quot;Its not real nothing you do is real!&quot; Sam said watching the precum stream off the tip on his dick flowing down the crevices of his abs.<br />
&quot;True nothing we do without our unique abilities lasts, but thats why we started experimenting with alchemy.&quot; Max said<br />
&quot;But I didn't drink anything... the fog&quot; Sam said slowing at the realization<br />
&quot;Yep theres more then one way to inject a liquid, and you sure did enjoy breathing it in&quot; Max said watching Sam shake as his dick grew longer almost reaching his pectoral muscles<br />
&quot;Will it stop?&quot; Sam said toes curling from the lack of release<br />
&quot;Oh ya, when you go soft it will shrink back to normal size till you find yourself in the mood again and then it will all start over.  Which will be quite often since hearing your name spoken for some reason really turns you on...&quot; Max said smiling at the helpless Sam<br />
&quot;No it doesn't I...&quot; Sam started saying before being interupted<br />
&quot;What was that 'Sammy'?&quot; Max said. Sam let out a load moan as his dick grew yet longer. &quot;Sorry I didn't quite hear that 'Sammy' boy&quot; he repeated.<br />
&quot;Fuck!&quot; Sam said as his dick stretched again pushing almost passed the pectorals.<br />
&quot;'Sammy'!&quot; Max said again walking toward Sam whose hip started involuntary gyrating.<br />
&quot;Ahhhh&quot; Sam screamed as Max leaned over and lightly stroked the ridiculous length of Sam's shaft leaving him quivering.<br />
&quot;Awww wondering why you haven't exploded all over yourself yet?&quot; Sam whimpers in agreement &quot;Quite simple its a balance thing, you've grown quite big, so now you require a big stimulation&quot; Max says wrapping his hand around the head of Sam's dick squeezing it shortly before sliding his hand up and down the shaft, using the precum as lube.  Sam's whole body tensed up but still not achieving release.  Max reached up with his other hand and tilted Sam's head down pressing his chin against his body facing his dick.<br />
&quot;ready or not here it comes... 'Sammy'&quot; Max says<br />
<br />
Sam's body tightened against the restraints as he felt himself finally reach the edge. Sam yelled in pleasure as several massive spasms Sam's dick he shot cum all over his face with incredible force showering his  body.  Between gasps Sam managed to say &quot;Thank... You...&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh come on, you've got more then that in you, besides you owe me a good time and I have all night to play with you before this all becomes normal... &quot;Sammy!&quot; with those words Sam hardened up again<br />
&quot;Fuck... you...&quot; Sam managed to get out<br />
&quot;No no you're going to be too busy fucking yourself to have time for me just yet 'Sammy'.  Trust me you'll learn to enjoy this very few have ever had the chance to do this with such ease&quot; he said rubbing the tip of Sam's dick against his chin &quot;relax you might enjoy it 'Sammy'&quot; he says guiding the growing dick into Sam's mouth.<br />
&quot;enjoy!... 'Sammy'&quot; Max said as Sam's eyes opened wide as his dick filled his mouth...</p>
