<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jarred had found a new desire in life, sex!  The boy was not yet of age in his little world to be interested in the fairer sex much less indulging them.  Now he was a bull and the morals of human society were gone.
<br />

<br />
Feeling no remorse for mounting the young heifer he milled around in the dark with both steers and cows. His strained thought pattern was in overload. The continued wafting of new smells and the friendly senses he felt over one scent compared to the others.
<br />

<br />
As he moved between the standing herd of cows his nostrils picked up the female scent. A large Angus cow stood feeling her sexual need and  not paying any attention to the aproaching bull. Jarred sniffed at her as he had done to his first conquest. 
<br />

<br />
Juices on this cow seemed sweeter and flowed in greater amounts. Her scent was rich and drove his bullish brain plain nuts. Without any physical action he felt his cock move out for some excersize. A jump with his forelegs proved to be a problem. Either he had not tried had enough or this cow was much taller than his heifer friend.
<br />

<br />
Indeed the older cow was taller and strain as he could his sheath and long cock could just barely enter the warm tunnel of love. Bouncing, jumping he tried to thrust deep but to no avail he was still too young and short.
<br />

<br />
Dropping off her his stiff cock wedged into the hard ground. A pain like none he knew raged in his long bull cock. Stiff as it was allowed no severe bending, but as he dropped down it kinked, OUCH!.
<br />

<br />
Like a cold shower the pain cleared his thoughts back to human and turned his will to boyish dreams.
<br />

<br />
The sun was just coming over the Eastern hills as Jarred was beginning to feel less pain in his aching member. As the cows and herd sauntered along grazing and standing round he felt boered and dirty.  Remembering that when a boy he enjoyed a morning shower to start the day, now he had more dust on his hide than ever before.
<br />

<br />
Jarred wandered back to the water trough. As the black bull moved so did his herd. Soon he had to fight for a drink and push the other bovines away. &quot;This is worse than the lunch line at school, he thought!&quot;
<br />

<br />
People can be tough and sometimes unthinking of their actions but Jarred was fast learning that cattle cared even less for other cattle.
<br />

<br />
Midmorning found Jarred engroused in grazing. The bovine act caused his mind and will of fall asleep. Mindless he moved with the herd eating whatever plant came his way. Hours went by and the noon sun became hot. Hotter still to a black hairy bull's body, Jarred began to feel a real need for water and shade.
<br />

<br />
Breaking his mental sleep he lifted his head. Looking round the windmill was nowhere in sight. The herd had mostly wandered away from him and he stood almost alone on the sun dried range.
<br />

<br />
Sniffing the air the animal senses told of water, but the boy inside argued back. The sun and afternoon got hotter yet as Jarred thought, &quot;It must be ninety degrees out here, I must find water or shade!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Suddenly he looked up and found no cows in sight at all!  Afraid he Mooed and bellowed for a friend. Stopping to listen he heard nothing nearby at all! Stating to trott he climbed a small hill for a better view.
<br />

<br />
Turning around and around he saw in the distance a windmill, but no herd in sight. Marking the thought he trotted down the his and aimed himself in the possible direction. Jarred found that walking on all fours gave him a very short ability to see distance. After a mile of range he topped another hill only to find he had gone far left of his windmill and objective.
<br />

<br />
Again he sighted the windmill and started his trudge toward his objective. Now the more he trotted the hotter and more thirsty he became. A hour of maybe two and he was still in open range and had no view of the waterhole.  
<br />

<br />
His strength even as a bull was failing, his sight was blurring. He was more afraid now on dieing out on the range and alone. Putting one foot in front of the other was now getting painful. Jarred wished he'd listened to his bovine senses and followed the herd when the spirit moved him first.
<br />

<br />
He had to lay down, he was so weary. Yet the boy's mind set remembered stories of people in the old west continuing to move lest they fall and just die.
<br />

<br />
The range was steep here and going was so tough. Finally he topped the hill and saw to his very delight a small creek, some trees and to his amazement John Killingsworth fishing off the bank.
<br />

<br />
Remembering his painful encounter with John and his foreman he walked down the hill and a short ways from his friend. Reaching the creek he fell in and wallowed around as if in a bathtub. Drinking his fill he strolled out of the creek and stood about one hundred yards away from John.
<br />

<br />
Startled John stood near his horse ready to ride away if the bull charged.</p>
