<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“If you wish to live among us,” Gretchen replied to Becky’s question, “then you each must become one of us.”<br />
Despite knowing that this was coming, the both of us could feel our own hearts skip a beat at that very answer.<br />
<br />
“Do you accept this?” Gretchen asked.<br />
<br />
“We do,” you reply.<br />
<br />
“It is good to hear such confidence from you, Jess,” Gretchen remarked. “You and Becky come with me. Elise, you can stay here if you’d like. This will take a while.”<br />
<br />
“Okay Gretchen,” Elise said before turning to me and Becky. “Good luck you too.”<br />
<br />
With that said, you and Becky are lead to into a cavern in the mountain, which housed an entire town full of humanoid dragons. The two of you are mesmerized by the sight of the dragons living this way, almost similar to a human town. A minute of sightseeing later, you and Becky are led into a small tunnel which led to a dome-like chamber surrounded by what was obviously lava. At the center of the roof was a fountain that contained a glowing, green fluid that flowed like water.<br />
<br />
“This is the sacred chamber where our race was first born,” Gretchen explained, “This is where you will become dragonesses and join us in our tribe. The fountain that you see before you contains the Elixer of Dragon’s Blood. Once you drink it, there is no going back, and you will become humanoid dragons forever.”<br />
<br />
“We understand,” you say sternly, with Becky nodding in agreement.<br />
<br />
“Good,” Gretchen said, “Now we must do this one at a time as per traditions. Who wishes to go first?”<br />
<br />
Noticing that Becky was shaking, suggesting that she may be getting cold feet about this, you quickly <br />
say, “I’ll go first!”<br />
<br />
“Then go Jess,” Gretchen commanded, “Approach the fountain, shed your clothing, drink the Elixer, and join us as one of our own.”<br />
<br />
“Be careful Jess,” Becky said as you approach the center of the chamber, your heart pounding as you drew closer and closer to the fountain. When you reach it the fountain, you discard all of your clothes, right down to your undergarments, and you step into the large fountain, and approach the center of it. As you cup a small amount of the Elixer in your hands, you look at a reflection of your face, realizing that this was the last time you would see that face. Before having second thoughts, you quickly drink the Elixer, taking more for good measure, and you step out of the fountain, waiting for something to happen.<br />
<br />
It was then that you felt a slight pain in your stomach, and before long you scream in agony as your body feels like it’s on fire.<br />
<br />
“JESS!” Becky screamed as she tried to run to you, but Gretchen stopped her.<br />
<br />
“Don’t be afraid,” he said, “She’s merely transforming internally. The pain will stop right… about… now.”<br />
<br />
Just like that, the pain suddenly stopped, and you struggle to stay on your feet, only to realize that you are starting to get a feeling of vertigo, and look down to actually see yourself getting taller and more mature. Your breasts swelled to DD cups, your height increased up to about 7 feet tall, almost as tall as Gretchen. Then you get a stinging feeling in your eyes realizing that they are changing. You turn back towards the fountain to see your reflection, and you look down to see that your eyes have begun to glow a bright azure, and your pupils have become slitted, giving off a more reptilian appearance, and improving your vision. Then you suddenly feel a strange sensation in your mouth. As if on instinct, you decide to stick out your tongue, only to watch as it becomes slightly thinner, and it splits at the front to become two pronged.  You then feel inside your mouth with your tongue to see that the inside of it seems to be coated in a plastic-like coating. Suddenly, you feel a huge pressure coming from your chest, and going up to your mouth. The pressure is released from your mouth, and out comes sapphire blue fire.<br />
<br />
‘Wow!’ you thought, ‘I’ve got fire-breath now.’<br />
<br />
Then you begin to feel pressure just above your butt, and you look back to see your tailbone extending out of your back, and it quickly grow longer and longer, up to 6 feet, it’s width at the base is about 1’2”, and then suddenly, blue scales began growing all over your new tail, while light blue plates grow on the underside of the tail. As you look in astonishment at your new tail, you feel to point on your back where pressure was building up. You look back and see what looked like a second pair of arms growing out of your shoulders. These “arms” grew long, and the fingers became webbed with a light blue membrane that was mostly opaque. The fingers grew extremely long along with the membranes, while the so called arms grew powerful muscles, and after they were finished growing and covered in blue scales, you were left with a pair of beautiful dragon wings with a wingspan of about 10 to 12 feet. Then you feel pressure on your fingernails and toenails as they slowly cracked, and eventually shattered, making way for long, curled, sharp, black claws. You didn’t notice it at first, but on your wings a spike grew at the top joint of each of your wings. The your feet reformed, and became very paw like, while your hands grew scaly blue paw pads. Then your transformation accelerated as blue scales spread throughout your body, all the way up to your neck, and light blue plate scales formed from your tail up to your private area, covering up your but hole, and your private area itself, as well as your belly and chest (causing your nipples to disappear under the plating), and up to the tip of your chin, leaving your face and most of your head unchanged. Then you felt some tingling at the top of your head, you put your new dragonhead up there, and as your hand touched your hair, it began falling out in clumps, and in seconds, you were left completely bald. <br />
<br />
‘Should’ve seen that coming,’ you thought, ‘I didn’t see any dragon that had hair on his or her head.’<br />
<br />
Then you feel your ears tingle as they shrivel and disappear, leaving a pair of holes in their places. Thankfully your hearing remained unchanged. Then you felt pressure along your spine, tail, lower legs, and forearms. Then before you could think of anything, a row of black spikes grow from the top of your tail, up your spine, and ending at your forehead. It was then that the front-most spike on your forehead grew longer, and another spike grew on her side of your temple, and curved backtoward the back of your head as it they grew longer, becoming three fearsome horns. While that happened, your lower legs and forearms each grew their own row of spikes going down. It was then that the blue scales finally spread across your entire head, covering the last of your human skin, and finally, you feel pressure on your face as it pushes out, nose sinking in, teeth becoming longer and sharper as more grew in, tongue growing longer, peripheral vision improving more, and your head becoming more streamlined, and with one final cracking noise, you gasp as your transformation is finally complete. <br />
<br />
You look down to see your reflection again, only this time you see a blue, humanoid dragon (with some facial features that resembled that of your former self) that was now the new you and it felt natural. In fact you see yourself and think that you are now more beautiful than ever. In the excitement, you through your head up and let out a mighty draconic roar that filled the chamber, embracing your new existence. You then turn back towards the chamber entrance where Becky and Gretchen awaited you. <br />
<br />
“Well,” Gretchen said, sounding pleased, “you turned out very great. You look more beautiful as a dragon, and your roar. Such confidence, such courage. I think you’ll fit in quite nicely here.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you,” you say to your kinsman, noticing that your voice is the same, but more mature. You then look at Becky, her mouth hanging open as she stared in amazement at your new form. “What do you think Becky?”<br />
<br />
“You. Are. Amazing.” Becky said with shock and awe. “At first I thought you were going to die there, when I saw you roar like that, I felt the confidence you had coursing through my veins. How did it feel? The transformation itself I mean.”<br />
<br />
“It was obviously painful at first,” you explained, “but after that, there were only a few minor, uncomfortable moments, but the rest felt wonderful.”<br />
<br />
“I see,” Becky nodded.<br />
<br />
“Are you ready Becky?” Gretchen asked.<br />
<br />
“More than ever now!” Becky replied eagerly.<br />
<br />
“Wonderful!” Gretchen said, “You know what to do.”<br />
<br />
Becky then approached the fountain, stripped off her clothing, and drank the Elixer as you did, allowing her own transformation to begin. <br />
<br />
Basically, Becky’s transformation was the same in most ways (she was slightly shorter than you and had D cup breasts). The only differences were that Becky got a crimson red fire breath. Her regular scales were orange in color, while her plate scales were crimson red. Instead of spikes on her body, she had thick, crimson red spines growing in from her back, and her forearms and lower legs grew crimson red, curved-blade-like growths, and she had two horns that grew from the back of her head on each side of the spines, and curving towards the front of her head as they grew longer, stopping just above her eyes. her muzzle was similar to yours in most ways, but was less aerodynamic and her humanoid features that remained allowed her to be told apart from others. After letting out her draconic roar when her transformation finished, she looked back and giggled slightly as she enjoyed her new self as you do. When Becky rejoined you at the chamber’s entrance, Gretchen then began a speech.<br />
<br />
“I would like to be the first to officially welcome you to the tribe of dragons,” he said, “you have grown to become fine dragonesses. Dragonesses who will contribute greatly to this community, and will live on for the many years to come. So welcome Jess and Becky, and live your life as Humanoid Dragons!”</p>
