<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen and Liz both sat across from one another trying to come up with the best way to proceed wen suddenly Jen had a realization. While thinking about the way Kyle worded the curse she noticed that he missed something. He never said how she was supposed to get the book from him, a very simple mistake all thing considered. But Jen realized that all she needed to do was just sneak over to Kyle&#39;s house and just take it, no need to deal with the little creep at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow&quot; Liz said &quot;that&#39;s convenient but I doubt that it&#39;s going to be that easy&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your right&quot; Jen replied &quot;Kyle likely still has the curse which means if he caches me sneaking around he&#39;ll be able to do what ever he wants to me&#39; but we might have another problem&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;And what&#39;s that&quot;? <br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle&#39;s mom Renee my mom woks with her and I&#39;ve met her before, thing is she&#39;s very religious which means if she found out that Kyle had a book like that I have little doubt she would have destroyed it&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;Which means Kyle has likely hid it somewhere she can&#39;t find it&quot; Liz added. <br />
<br />
&quot;So i&#39;m probably going to have to spy on him to figure out where he&#39;s hid it&quot;. <br />
<br />
The two then spent the afternoon planing and occasionally taking a brake to have sex and genuinely just enjoying each others company. The following day after school Jen quickly went home and got ready for that night&#39;s operation putting on a dark blue hoodie and grabbing a backpack packing a flashlight and a crowbar. That night Jen left home telling her mom that she will be staying with Liz for the weekend before heading to Kyle&#39;s place. Upon arriving at Kyle&#39;s house Jen set about climbing a tree that reached up to the house&#39;s lower roof giving her access to most of the second floor. Do to the fact that most of the houses in the neighborhood were built in the same style it was a fairly simple task to find Kyle&#39;s room. And after a Quick peek in the window to confirm that it was indeed his room, she got herself into a position where she could observe Kyle without him noticing. After watching for a few minutes she was able realize two things, firstly there was a surprising lack of places for him to hide the book which means he likely hid it somewhere else. The second thing she noticed was the awkward way he was moving as she turned her attention to the rather sizable bulge in his pants, Jen soon found herself thinking about what kind of monster he might be hiding. However Jen soon found her train of thought interrupted wen she herd Renee yell &quot;Kyle remember to set your alarm for tomorrow we&#39;er going to the Church to get your..... thing exorcised.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jen nearly fell off the roof trying to hold in her laughter as her increasingly perverted mind began to imagine what a dick exorcism would look like, her mind creating a image of a priest giving Kyle a hand job while chanting (oh God give me the strength to expel this evil seed from this boy&#39;s tainted loins). &quot;Well at lest she hasn&#39;t found the book&quot; Kyle said quietly &quot;damn it Jen what&#39;s taking her so long, I thought she would have broke by now&quot;. &quot;Sorry Kyle I guess you underestimated me&quot; Jen whispered feeling rather relived to hear that the book is still in one piece. After a few minutes had passed Kyle finally left the room giving her the opportunity to get a closer look, sure enough there really wasn&#39;t any good place to hide a demonic text. While thinking about her next move Jen hears someone open the back door she then turns to see someone with a flashlight walking into the woods. Realizing that it must be Kyle she quickly and quietly made her way down from the roof and began to follow him, making sure to keep a safe distance away. <br />
<br />
She followed Kyle for a few minutes before stopping at a rather large tree house and watching as he made his ascent struggling occasionally because of his &quot;package&quot;. Wanting to get a better vantage point Jen quickly found the prefect tree to climb getting a better look. Just as she got into position Jen was able to see Kyle remove a section of the floor to reveal a large black book. &quot;Jackpot&quot; Jen quietly exclaimed barely able to contain her excitement at being so close to her goal now all she had to do was wait for the little creep to leave so she can claim what&#39;s her&#39;s. She watches eagerly as he lays the book on the floor a begins to casually read the demonic text, Jen continues to watch slowly getting bored and nearly falling asleep wen she noticed that he was beginning to look uncomfortable. Suddenly Kyle began to strip removing his t shirt and then removing his pants reviling a massive 18 inch cock, Jen new it was going to be big but that&#39;s just ridiculous. Feeling a mix of arousal and horror she continued to watch Kyle as he began to stroke his quickly hardening shaft the stark difference between his frail effeminate body and his virile dick creating an interesting site.<br />
<br />
Jen found herself getting more and more aroused as she continued to spy on Kyle his cock now covered by a layer of pre. Her mind began to wander thinking about what she wanted to do to him after she becomes a demon imagining him transforming in to a slutty nymphomaniac demon girl obsessed with sucking her own dick. This ultimately drove her over the edge causing her to undo her pants removing them and giving her access to her wet vulva joining Kyle in masturbation. Jen tried her best to keep quiet as she slid her fingers into her pussy sending drops of her juices to the forest floor. She looks back at Kyle who&#39;s clearly getting close to having an orgasm wen she notices that he&#39;s so close to giving himself a blowjob. The look on his face saying it all a look of frustration and a deep yearning to just give into his lust and become the little nympho she knows is hiding just beneath the surface. Just then his body begins to convulse as thick ropes of white hot cum squirt from his throbbing cock covering him with his seed. After recovering from her own orgasm Jen tuns her attention back to Kyle who was laying on the floor his body plastered with cum. After a few minutes Jen herd the voice of Kyle&#39;s mom yelling at him to get to bed, he let out a soft moan before trying his best to clean himself off. Kyle then grabbed the book putting it back in it&#39;s hiding place then finally getting his cloths back on and heading back home.<br />
<br />
After waiting for Kyle to get far enough away Jen sprung into action getting dressed and heading up into the tree house. Once inside her nose was assaulted with the smell of sex threatening to dive her out of control for the second time that night. Regaining her composer she then turns her attention to finding the book, carefully removing the floor boards to reveal the demonic tome. To Jen&#39;s surprise instead of the skull filled necronomicon filled with grotesque imagery she is greeted buy a beautiful black book decorated with silver markings and a large white gem embedded on the cover. The pages were made with black paper, it&#39;s secrets were written with a glowing white ink, and accompanied by beautifully illustrated images of demons and sex. As she continued to study the text Jen found herself getting horny idly fondling herself &quot;wow no wonder Kyle got tuned on this is some sexy stuff&quot;. Deciding to deal with her growing arousal at Liz&#39;s place she packed the book into her backpack and began to make her way back down to the forest floor. As Jen began to make her way to Liz&#39;s house her thoughts turned to Kyle and what she actually thinks of him and to be honest she actually felt grateful. Truth is she loved what she was becoming she felt so free and it felt so good to just give in to her lust having sex whenever she wanted. She didn&#39;t want revenge she wanted to thank him to let him experience the same ecstasy she has. She continues to fantasize about all the fun she&#39;s going to have with him as she makes her way back to Liz. <br />
<br />
Wen Jen finally got to the house she began to knock on the door wen a completely naked Liz answers. Liz&#39;s family had very interesting ideas regarding sex believing it to be the perfect way to bond with each other, often times they don&#39;t even bother to wear clothes wen at home. Before the curse Jen usually tried her best to avoid going there, nowadays she loves spending time with Liz and her family often wishing her Mother and sisters would do stuff like this too. For a long time Jen often wondered how this kind of behavior even started, it was after she was cursed wen she realized that they must have been affected buy it at some pint. After seeing Liz&#39;s naked body Jen could no longer control herself and immediately began to kiss her before quickly striping naked &quot;why do I even bother to wear clothes any more&quot; Jen asked. &quot;Probably because people can&#39;t handle your sexiness&quot; Liz replied before wrapping her arms around Jen &quot;now where were we&quot;? The two girls proceeded to have passionate sex for a few hours before grabbing the book and going up to Liz&#39;s room. They spend the next hour studying the demonic tome trying to figure out which demon would suit their needs.</p>
