<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alix decided that Ricky was being not very grateful and decided that he is the one who is going to change, and was happy, that Max was happy and grateful abut being male again, so he hopped that this change will make him a little happier, and changed Ricky: <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Name: Ricky Evans <br />
Age: 11years old <br />
Gender: male <br />
Race: Caucasian <br />
Height: 4’7 <br />
Body Type: Athletic <br />
Hair style: brown shoulder length. <br />
 <br />
<br />

<br />
Name: Ricky Evans <br />
Age: 7 years old <br />
Gender: male <br />
Race: Caucasian <br />
Height: 3’4 <br />
Body Type: skinny <br />
Hair style: blond medium length fringe going just over his eyes and the rest being cut to 4 cm. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Ricky was in shock, and is surprised seeing everything around him is much bigger and feeling like a stone off wait suddenly fell of him, he felt so light and looking down at himself seeing a very skinny and small body, and realizing that he is a young child now, and let out a gasp looking up at his twin who is now his older brother and then at Alix and shouted “WH..WHAT DID YOU DOOOO!” with his squeaky young voice sounds coming out of him, and Ricky putting his hand up to his throat not liking it and being surprised again from the sound of his voice. <br />
<br />
Alix was also surprised seeing how small Ricky has got, and how cute he looks now, and hearing his little voice yelling at him, Alix could not help but smile at him and say “well little man, you did not want to be your big brothers twin anymore so I made you in to a little cute 7 year old boy. Ok?,  <br />
<br />
And Alix must have had some automatic clothing setting on seeing Max has been wering a black tank top and black sweatpants, and Ricky was now waring little bright blue shorts and a white shirt with cartoon planes printed all around it, what looks perfect for a 7 year old boy, Alix just relaxed at this but he was puzzled how neither of his younger brothers seemed to realised yet. <br />
<br />
Max could not help but look down at his little brother who was his twin less then 5 minutes ago, and could not help but smile knowing this is what he wanted and felt a beam of happiness going over him, knowing he is not a twin anymore, and knew he can push him around now, and have his own clothes and space and everything now!,  <br />
<br />
And he just realized Rickys clothes have changed to suit his body and role of a little boy and little brother, and then realized he is wearing a tank top and comfy trackies/sweatpants, he did not even realize he is wearing them Antill now! But still if he can stay like this and because anything worse if he plays his cards right, so when Alix gives him a go with the device he has lots of ideas to make his new life and body better, and hoping that the rule of not changing Alix means not changing him (Max) or Ricky. liking everyone&#39;s place in the family right now, and looked back at Alix seeing him looking at Ricky (with Ricky going into a tantrum knowing he is not going to get turned back) and    Max said “hay Alix, when is it my turn with the device? If that is alright to know big bro?” trying to be polite, not wanting to push Alix at all. <br />
<br />
Alix was constantly replying to Rickys constant asking to be turn in to a “big boy”, with him knowing his head is catching up to his body, not being able to say any complicated sentences/words and will have you use words like “Big Boy” instead of “back to being a teenager” or the word “older”  and kept on saying “no little bro” and “stop asking that” it was actually getting annoying, and he thought that this is what people mean  when they complain about their “annoying little brothers” and before he was about to yell at Riky, hoping that will shut him up, Max asked about using the Device (what he said in the last paragraph) and Alix knew he did not want it to be used anymore, but Max did ask very nicely so he was not going to be mean but try and explain what he has planned on how to use the device and explained it to him <br />
<br />
“Well Max, I think we have used it enough today, and I think it will be safer for me to keep it for now and you both can tell me what changes you want to make and I can decide if they are safe, and you are not going to regret it after changing, like what you and Ricky have done all day today, and I know you don’t want a repeat of today, do you?”  <br />
<br />
Max did not want a repeat of today, but he did not like the sound of Alix having control of the remote and will decide what changes or his are good or bad, but he is his older brother now and Max knows he won’t hesitate changing him like he did to Ricky, and his new roles means, Ricky won’t be able to change him into anything like he has been doing all day, so that is a good idea, what he guesses he likes the sound of now, and said “ok, I guess that sounds fair, so I might have something to change tomorrow then bro?” but Ricky was not having none of it, and started yelling saying that he wanted his turn, so he can turn himself back in to a 14 year old.  <br />
<br />
Alix sighed hearing Ricky going off again, and knew he needed Ricky and Max out of his room before he gets a migraine, so he said to max “ok that should be fine if it is nothing stupid, so now that is all settled can you get out of my room now! I need some peace, and take your little brother back to your room as well please?”  <br />
<br />
Max nodded yes at him not wanting to say anymore, seeing Alix getting fed up, so he walked to his little brother and said “ok Ricky time to leave are big bro alone, we can see what are new room is like huh?” but once again Ricky was having none of it, and started to yell at max now about how could he ok with this? and how Max should be the little brother and not him.  <br />
<br />
Max was the one to sigh this time, knowing he is going to have to throw around is wait, if Ricky carries on being a brat, knowing he is still sharing a room with him, with there being no other rooms in their house for them to have their own each, and new, Alix was getting annoyed and did not want any more problems so he grabbed Ricky and put him into a fireman&#39;s hold over his shoulder with him trying to wiggle out of it and hitting his back, with max smiling now, with it being a surprise at how easy his ex twin, now little brother is to control now, with his wiggling and hitting not doing anything to him and he just said “see ya big bro” to Alix and left the room with Ricky still hitting him on Max’s back screaming his lungs out, and tears starting to full down his face. <br />
<br />
Alix shut the door behind them happy he is now alone and can now look at his new body and experiment with his new gender, and new he is going to put the Device on top of his big wardrobe knowing Max or Rick won&#39;t be able to reach up there now in there smaller body&#39;s, but should he use it on himself first, maybe 18 is too old, he has skipped a lot of school and a lot of his childhood, it could be fun to see what it is like to be a younger as a boy with becoming Max’s twin at the youngest he would get, or he could change his body buy giving himself bigger muscles, or seeing what being fat is like? Or maybe something else?</p>
