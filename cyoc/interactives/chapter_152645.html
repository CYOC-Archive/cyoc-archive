<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day she woke up late, but she headed to the market and bought herself some new clothes.  Selling the were pelt covered that and more.  She bought herself a novice sorceress&#39;s robe that would enhance her magic and a staff that would do the same, as well as allow her to apply half of her wisdom to melee attacks.  Even with all that, her budget was extended 2 days.  She felt she was ready to join a party today.<br />
<br />
First, she spent half the day grinding Fireball to level 3, and Illusion to 2.  Then at noon she went back to the town square.  As she looked at the bulletin board, she became aware of a pair of eyes on her. She turned to look, and saw a boy her age blush and look away. Apparently she had an admirer.  Uhg.<br />
<br />
He walked over to her. &quot;Hi!&quot; He said cheerfully. &quot;I&#39;m Luke.&quot;   He had an innocence and naivete that she found irritating, but as he tried to chat her up she had to admit he was quite hot.  He had some muscle, and a rather impressive bulge in his pants.  <br />
<br />
&quot;So, you from around here?&quot; He asked, &quot;You look like a local, but I&#39;ve never seen you before?&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, he probably hadn&#39;t seen her before because he didn&#39;t frequent the horrible part of town that she was from.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m local, yes.  I&#39;m from the Flaremouse district.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; he said, looking embarrassed.  He likely knew that being from Flaremouse meant she was probably dirt poor, but if that bothered him he didn&#39;t let it show.  &quot;Well welcome to Broadberg!&quot; he said, beaming. &quot;Can I show you around?&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly two exclamation marks appeared above his head, one pink and one red. She focused first on the pink one.<br />
<br />
:::<br />
Quest Available!<br />
<br />
Relationship Quest: Loverboy Luke<br />
Information: Luke has a strong good alignment, and forming a romantic relationship with him will grant you good alignment points periodically. Additionally, the higher your relationship points with him are the more often he will give you gifts. At 40 points he can be added to your party. At 100 points you may marry him. Additionally, a maxed-out good alignment and a marriage to Luke will allow a race change from half-succubus to half-angel starting at level 10.<br />
:::<br />
<br />
Well, that was interesting. She didn&#39;t have to be a succubus forever? Now that was the kind of miracle she needed! but, she&#39;d have to *marry* Luke?  She didn&#39;t think so.<br />
<br />
Then she looked at the red exclamation mark.<br />
<br />
:::<br />
Quest Available!<br />
<br />
Dark Quest: Corrupting the Innocent<br />
Information: Turn Luke&#39;s love to lust, corrupt him, and either devour his soul or turn him into your permanent sex thrall.<br />
Rewards: 1000 XP, 80 points evil alignment, possible gaining of a permanent thrall, Embracing of the Dark passive skill: By staining your soul with darkness you attune it to your succubus side. You will no longer risk losing yourself to succubus transformations, but you will gain massive evil points and be forever banned from becoming a half-angel.<br />
:::<br />
<br />
She blinked.  Now THAT was interesting.  Immunity from losing herself to her transformations was a dream come true, but apparently she&#39;d have to kill or enslave this guy to do it?  She pondered.  It was only a game, right?  I mean he wasn&#39;t real, was he?  She supposed she wasn&#39;t sure though, so she couldn&#39;t do it...  She noticed him stealing a glance at the cleavage that her sorceress&#39;s attire exposed, and snickered.  It wouldn&#39;t be hard, would it?  But no, she couldn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
Well, she&#39;d had enough of Captain Optimism for now.  He was grinding on her nerves.  She made a polite excuse and left.  Maybe she&#39;d invest more time in him later.<br />
<br />
Eventually, she did find a party.   They were interested in treasure hunting, mostly. The leader was Miles, a level 5 Shieldmaster, which was a rare special class variation of a Fighter with extra effectiveness with shields. They also had Erika, a level 3 Paladin devoted to Ellnesis, goddess of warriors, and Venrie, a level 4 Cleric from the Order of Arkenos, which was a holy order devoted to a nature god. In short, they were a pretty tanky party, perfect to protect her while she cranked out the DPS, which was something she could now do fairly well with her leveled up fireball and her power enhancing items. Miles was human, Venrie was a wood elf, and Erika was a half-nymph. It was obvious that the males wanted Lillian in the group in part because she was sexy, and that dissent came from Erika out of jealousy, though the half-nymph was almost as attractive as she was, but when she turned on her charisma she managed to win the half-nymph over.  It definitely helped that the other girl seemed to be a bit bi.<br />
<br />
When she joined the party,  her occupation changed from &quot;none&quot; to &quot;adventurer&quot;.  It was about time.  She hoped she&#39;d never see Saldric again.<br />
<br />
The party agreed to meet tomorrow for some monster clearing in the morning, and an escort mission in the afternoon.  As they parted ways, Lillian suddenly noticed a familiar face in the crowd.  It was the bandit that she&#39;d spared!  He saw her too, and ran.  She couldn&#39;t let him escape!  If he told people about her, she might be burned at the stake!  She chased him through the crowd.  He was fast, but she was small and agile and had Lillian&#39;s memories of being raised on these streets.  Soon he took a wrong turn and she&#39;d cornered him in a dead end alley.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what you are!&quot;  he stammered.  &quot;You&#39;re a demon! A succubus!  I&#39;ll tell everyone!&quot;<br />
<br />
She&#39;d spared him before, but she wasn&#39;t feeling merciful today.  This filth had tried to kill her, and as a result she&#39;d been forced to turn into a monster.  She still felt a dull ache inside of her from the transformation.  She wanted to kill him for setting her down this path, and at any rate, if he&#39;d tell about her then she had to.  <br />
<br />
Then he froze.  Everything froze, as if the game were paused.  A game message appeared.<br />
<br />
::::<br />
Key Choice!<br />
Information: Special &quot;key choice&quot; moments will occur in the game. These moments will determine your character arc and plot, and may have an extra strong influence on your alignment. Killing the bandit in cold blood will grant 30 points of evil alignment, while letting him go will grant 30 points of good, but may lead to trouble for you later. Note that your alignment when reaching level 5 will determine what sort of succubus you can evolve into.<br />
Progress Reward: 300 XP<br />
