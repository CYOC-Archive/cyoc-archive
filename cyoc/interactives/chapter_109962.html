<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Robert&#39;s eyes glazed over for a moment, and Jennifer realized she had shoved him backwards to hand. He his head had rebounded. While Robert was trying to refocus, she quickly pulled him deeper into the alleyway. &quot;Come on. Come on. Say one!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whuh... what?&quot; Robert said, slowly coming to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or dare?! Transform or....&quot; Then, like a click in her head, she knew both curses were open and ready for her commands. &quot;Oh, fuck me,&quot; she muttered. Suddenly one of the two paths in her head closed. Her eyes widened. &quot;No. No no no! That was not a d-!&quot;<br />
<br />
Robert&#39;s expression suddenly changed from one of dazed to confusion to one of complete and total lust. With a strength that somehow overpowered even her, he lunged forward and tackled her backwards. In moments, she could feel him desperately trying to get her clothes off. As fear mounted within her, she saw something else creep into Roberts eyes. He was just as terrified as she was. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; he spat out between he desperate gasps of breath. &quot;I can&#39;t... I can&#39;t stop! Help me! Uh, transform or dare? Transform or dare?!&quot;<br />
<br />
She winced. Unfortunately there were no immediate backsies, as Paula had put it. The curse did not activate. There was no stopping this.<br />
<br />
Well, Jennifer thought with resignation, it could had been with someone worse. She had screwed this up by literally telling him under magical duress to do this, she admitted to herself. And so she stopped fighting him and decided to let this get over with.<br />
<br />
She could see the strain in his eyes as mentally he was trying to stop himself from taking her in the back of the alley, but it was no good. He eventually pulled his pants and underwear down, yanked down her panties, and plunged in.<br />
<br />
The wolf within her awoke in ecstasy. She felt a wealth of passions stoke up from within. She had been hoping to just endure her mistake, but... this felt wonderful.<br />
<br />
Is this the wolf, or is it just me? she thought, completely unsure.<br />
<br />
Whatever resistance Robert had was also failing. The regret in his eyes were mixed with the desire and the need. His thrusting came longer, harsher, harder, and faster. He repeated apologies faded, and eventually he grabbed her head in his hands and kissed her deeply. His smell filled her nostrils, and she gave in to the enjoyment as much as he was. She wrapped her legs around his thighs, entrapping him slightly, and pushing him further in.<br />
<br />
She wanted more.<br />
<br />
As time continued and the passions mounted further, his kisses began to grow harder as well. She returned them, sometimes dragging her teeth along his skin, sometimes his neck. He tasted wonderful. <br />
<br />
She needed more.<br />
<br />
Between kisses and nibbles, her desire hit a point where she would be willing to destroy anyone and anything to have more of this. Then she realized there was still something open in her mind, something putting him completely within her control. The wolf inside her mind gave a toothy grin, and Jennifer followed. &quot;You are a perfect breeding machine,&quot; she said during the thrusts. She was so close to climaxing. She had to make sure it was all worth it. &quot;You will be the ideal mate. You will be the ultimate mate this world has ever seen. You will be the greatest werewolf lover that can ever be.&quot; And with that, she bit down hard on his shoulder. The second door in her mind closed. Her control of the curse was gone.<br />
<br />
Robert&#39;s face cringed in pain. Jennifer couldn&#39;t tell if her wolven teeth had come out of not. She didn&#39;t care. She drew blood. It tasted glorious.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, his scent changed. It grew stronger, and during those moments, she felt him fill her. He had grown within her, and the rest of his body started to expand piece-by-piece, growing stronger and more massive. Parts of his face reshaped. His face showed he was in pain, but his thrusting would not stop. Each stroke grew faster and more violent. Robert&#39;s body hair then began to thicken, covering everything in a solid mass of black fur. His teeth started to elongate at the same time his spine grew longer, jutting out from the base of his spine, forming a long glorious tail. Within the span of two minutes, Jennifer was covered by a beast nearly 10-feet in height who continued to pound deeply inside of her. Her mate. The smell of her mate was everywhere. The sensation she usually just felt in her privates now tingled throughout her whole body. She could had climaxed by now, but she couldn&#39;t. It just kept building, and building, and....<br />
<br />
FINALLY. Jennifer&#39;s body shook as she howled. She had no wolven throat, but she howled. It was fantastic. In that moment, Robert... what had been Robert... came within her. He exploded inside of her, filling her again. His form knotted inside her, not letting a single drop of his or her juices out. A minute later, the two slowed down, regaining their breaths.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit,&quot; she said, finally. Looking up at the horrific beast, she now could see something similar to what she must had been the night before. She felt no fear. Instead, she saw perfection. Robert leaned into her, smelled her gently, nibbled at her upright ears, and then slowly withdrew from her. Even that sensation was pure bliss.<br />
<br />
Does he even know what he is? she wondered. How much of Robert is there?<br />
<br />
&quot;Robert,&quot; she said slowly. &quot;Can you underst-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer! Are you alright?&quot; calm a voice from the mouth of the alley. Turning her head, she saw Peter standing there, looking sweaty and panicked. However his eyes had fallen on Robert, and then glanced at her. &quot;Oh crap,&quot; the kid said. Robert had already closed the distance by far more than half before Peter would even turn around to run.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!&quot; Jennifer yelled, but it was too late. Robert grabbed Peter and spun him around. Jennifer tried to get up, but her legs weren&#39;t stable enough for her to act as quickly. Robert then did something Jennifer did not expect. He slashed downward with his long claws, causing Peter&#39;s pants to drop to the ground as he was pressed up against the wall. Then, with a spasm, Robert&#39;s body began to change. To Jennifer&#39;s confusion, Robert&#39;s form adjusted. His muscles leaned slightly, his hips widened, and his mussel lengthened and thinned. Then his long wolven penis retracted up into his fur as rows of massively round breasts began to push out of his chest and upper abdomen. Down below, a slit opened between Robert&#39;s legs. Within seconds, Robert had changed into an equally impressive female.<br />
<br />
Shit, she thought. He&#39;s a perfect mating machine. I never said for which gender or for who.<br />
<br />
Peter&#39;s jaw worked up and down, without any words coming out. He was too terrified to speak. However Robert then leaned in and exhaled on him. Instantly Peter seemed to relax and stop struggling. He also instantly grew aroused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no,&quot; Jennifer thought again. She staggered forward, only then noticing part of the scene beyond them, outside of the alley. Men and women were lying with each other, some partially naked, others completely. All of them had either just had sex or were still in the process. &quot;What the hell?&quot; She tried to think back on her words to see if anything she had said would cause this or if it was just the smells permeating the area causing the reactions, but then she heard Robert speak to Peter in a very deep yet alluring feminine voice, &quot;Transform or Dare?&quot;</p>
