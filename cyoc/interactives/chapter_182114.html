<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Fukushu frowned as he gazed into his world mirror. He had not anticipated this.<br />
Evan Harris&#39;s revival had taken the magical world by surprise, what was even more shocking was the demise of Lynne Harris.<br />
<br />
Lynne had long been considered the most powerful sorceress in all reality. That her resurrected child could destroy her so easily alarmed many, including Fukushu. Fukushu recalled how he had pushed the young man towards darkness, useing illusions, deception, and cunning. At the time he had been consumed with destroying the wizards, a task he had mostly succeeded with. Now though, Evan walked the world of the living once more, meaning none would be safe from his wrath.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look tense.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukuahu turned to see Abolith approach, the dark elf delicate features gazing at him with concern. &quot;I am simply deepening thought,&quot; Fukuahu said quietly. &quot;I had not anticipated Evans return. The boy is twisted. I do not know if his rage can be contained.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let the wizards deal with him,&quot; Abolith replied quietly, placing a hand on Fukushu&#39;s cheek. Fukushu now gave his beloved a small smile, caressing her cheek as she gripped his hand tightly.<br />
<br />
For a moment, Fukushu relaxed. Abolith was right. Let the wizards deal with Evan like they had dealt with him before. The two would remain hidden, maneuvering and strengthening themselves in the shadows as they had for almost a century. It was only the sound of a shot that now broke their peace.<br />
<br />
Abolith cried out in pain, the bullet tearing through her. Fukushu gasped, his face and chest sprayed with blood. Abolith now slumped forward into his arms.  &quot;Beloved!&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith snarled, placing a hand on the wound in her chest. The assassins body was already healing. &quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; she growled. Fukushu howled with rage, who would dare enter his sanctum? As the kitsune scanned the room his eyes narrowed as he caught sight of their attacker.<br />
<br />
With but a flick of one if his tails, the kitsune now ensnared their attacker, dragging them through a portal of darkness and before the self proclaimed Kitsune Lord. &quot;The Normal,&quot; he exclaimed, his eyes burning red. &quot;You insects DARE attack me! In my sanctum!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Normals sniper never had a chance. Fukushu now used his tails to bind each of the would be killers limbs. Stretching their attacker before him Fukushu now tore the man to pieces, blood now staining the floor. &quot;Where are the rest of you,&quot; he yelled.<br />
<br />
A single figure now emerged from the darkness, slowly applauding Fukushu&#39;s brutality. &quot;Very impressive,&quot; the Boss stated. &quot;I&#39;ve been told kitsune were strong. Just had to see for myself though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have some nerve mortal,&quot; Fukushu snarled. &quot;Entering my home alone, attacking Abolith without provocation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well your companion did bring this upon herself,&quot; The Boss stated. &quot;Did she really think that playing our organization for fools would go unpunished. The Normal don&#39;t like being patsies in someone else&#39;s plans. Oh, and I&#39;m not alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushus eyes narrowed as he observed several soldiers now emerge from the shadows, their laser sights targeting him and Abolith. The kitsune simply chuckled, slowly withdrawing the kitana by his side. &quot;Idiot human,&quot; he scoffed. &quot;Soldiers with guns? Do you truely think they are enough to destroy me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh them,&quot; The Boss replied. &quot;No, they&#39;re hear just in case. Its him you really need to be worried about.&quot; The Boss now motioned towards the far end of the room, Fukushu&#39;s eyes growing wide as a man now conjured a ball of fire, illuminating himself. &quot;Remember me,&quot; Evan grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Evan Harris,&quot; Fukushu grumbled. &quot;The prodigal son returns.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan smirked, firing off a series of magical blast in the kitsunes direction. Fukushu simply cleaved the bolts in half as he stood in front of Abolitb. &quot;You&#39;ll need to do better than that boy,&quot; Fukushu bellowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Evan laughed. &quot;This was just a warm up. Besides, there&#39;s an old friend who wants to say hi.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu raised an eyebrow, puzzled by the wizards words. As he deflected yet another attack, he failed to see Casseus materialize behind him. Abolitb called out to Fukushu too late as Casseus now impaled the kitsune with his spear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Fukushu,&quot; Casseus smiled. &quot;Did you miss me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu spit out blood, backhanding the wizard into a nearby wall as he grasped his injury. &quot;Fukushu,&quot; Abolith called, racing to her beloved side. The wound was severe but he would recover.<br />
<br />
&quot;As much fun as this has been I have a million other things I have to do today,&quot; The Boss sighed. &quot;Take em out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith and Fukushu&#39;s eyes went wide as the Normal soldiers opened fire on the two of them. Grabbing Fukushu Abolith now lept for cover as bullets riddled the throne room. &quot;Can you move,&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need a moment,&quot; Fukushu grunted. Abolith simply nodded, unsheathing her blade as she turned to fight. <br />
<br />
The Boss and Casseus now stood back as they watched Abolith leap into action. While the plan was to assassinate the two, they realized it was a Longshot. The Boss now watched as the dark elf assassin seemed to bound from pillars, dodge bullets in mid flight before slashing his soldiers to pieces. &quot;Wow she is an amazing fighter,&quot; the Boss said in awe. &quot;You werent kidding when you said she was fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True but she lacks magic,&quot; Casseus stated. &quot;Her skills may have been enhanced but she is still vulnerable. Just watch.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Boss watched as Abolith tore theought his troops, the assassin showing no mercy as blood splattered the floor. Evan in seeing this simply frowned before casting a series of spells.<br />
<br />
The first was a simple fireball, a ball of fire the assassin simply cleaved in two. The second was meant as misdirection.  Evan created a clone of himself, one that would charge Abolith and attack. Seeing as the clone was a near perfect copy, Abolith now advanced on the clone, dodging spells before impaling the clone thought the heart. As she did so the true Evan appeared behind her, unleashing a powerful blast of energy.<br />
<br />
Fukushu watched as Abolith now screamed in pain, the dark elf writhing as she collapsed in a heap. Evan now electrocuted her, the dark elf falling into a seizure at his feet. As Evan now looked to deliver the fatal blow, Fukushu appeared before him, delivering a devasting magical blast to Evan before vanishing with Abolith.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold your fire,&quot; The Boss bellowed. The remaining soldiers stooped firing as the Boss now approached Evan before helping him up. &quot;How you feeling?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Feels like I got kicked in the by a mule,&quot; Evan grunted. The Boss simply nodded as he looked towards Casseus. &quot;Well Casseus do you have what we need?&quot;<br />
<br />
Casseus smirked as he now collected the spilled blood of Fukushu. &quot;This should be plenty,&quot; he grinned. &quot;I should be able to open a portal now to the kitsunes home.&quot;</p>
