<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After 15 minutes of careful preening, Roderick finally turned off the electric razor and stepped out of the bathtub. He grimaced at the amount of body hair he just had to shave off. It was a large mass of brownish hair that clumped together and clung to the damp sides of the tub. He was used to keeping his body smooth yet even he couldn&#39;t imagine having to shave that amount off every other day. Maybe he could gradually shape and sculpt the hair over the next few months so it looked like it had grown naturally instead of overnight. He could even start a trend amongst the school to stop shaving and go au natural for once. But only the guys, he didn&#39;t want no furry-legged feminists trouncing about. That is all assuming he didn&#39;t find out who cursed him to this messed up fate and hadn&#39;t beaten them to a pulp until things went back to normal. With a sigh, Roderick turned on the taps and tried to wash the dark hairs down the drain, only for them to clump up inside the plug hole. He groaned loudly, knowing his parents wouldn&#39;t be too pleased with a drain clogged with hair. But he had other things to deal with for now, deciding to leave the rest for later.<br />
<br />
Roderick now turned his attention to his facial hair. He returned to the mirrored cabinet above the sink and caught a glimpse of his flabby torso again. It looked strangely sad and even more noticeable with the absence of hair. Cringing, he ran out of the bathroom and to his parents&#39; bedroom, opening his dad&#39;s wardrobe and putting on one of his shirts. It was a loose fit but it hid his embarrassing belly completely, something that none of his shirts could ever do since he intentionally wore them tight to emphasize his once-muscular frame. Pleased to not have to look at that mess, he returned to the mirror to begin tackling his denser stubble. He shaved away the hairs above his lip, along with the straggly hairs that dotted his cheeks and jaw. Finally, he picked at his chin until it somewhat resembled the faint goatee he was used to having. Stepping back, Roderick admired his handiwork. He almost looked just like his old self again. A good hair dye job and a month&#39;s worth of intense dieting and training, and he&#39;ll be back to normal in no time.<br />
<br />
Now that he had finished dealing with his hairy situation, Roderick had time to think about who could have cursed him. He leaned back against the bathroom sink and stroked his chin in though. Maybe it was Zane, he always seemed jealous of his star status on the team and around the school, always playing second fiddle to his achievements. Or it could have been Emily, that girl definitely had some sort of grudge against him for some reason, a grudge rivalling his intense desire to get with her. Hell, even Mr. Grimaldi could be suspect. He did seem very eager to wear him after all. Roderick was finding it hard to think up more suspects since his entire body itched like hell after shaving a majority of his body hair off. Everywhere had an unpleasant tingling. His arms, his legs, his stomach, even his groin and backside. He scratched at the most irritating parts for momentary relief, yet he just couldn&#39;t seem to relief the itch around his butt cheeks through the fabric of his underwear. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, realisation hit Roderick like a truck. His ass shouldn&#39;t be so itchy since there wasn&#39;t any excess hair there for him to shave. Plus, he wasn&#39;t wearing any underwear, was he? He looked at himself in the mirror through squinted eyes as he lifted his shirt up, revealing to his horror that the gold-banded underwear had returned. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no...&quot;<br />
<br />
He yanked off his shirt and desperately clawed at the magic fabric to no avail. As he helplessly struggled, he felt his hips turn noticeably softer and pliable to the touch. The white coloured fabric began to slowly spread up his torso and down his legs as his desperate hands began deflating and his arms shrivelled back into his torso. <br />
<br />
&quot;FUCKFUCKFUCK!! NO!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Roderick glanced back at the mirror, a look of utter horror and fear etched into his face. A face that was growing less distinct by the second as his features faded away, smoothing and flattening into his increasingly paler skin. His hair receded back into his scalp, his lips melded together while his eyelids closed over his frightened eyes that were still able to see his freakish, knitted head. It was one thing to experience his defeated body collapse into underwear the first time around but to actually see this hellish transformation occur to him in the mirror was too much to handle. But he couldn&#39;t look away, frozen in place by fear as his skin shifted and transfigured into thin, white cotton. His bones and organs shrank and completely vanished to the point that the shell of his figure sank and caved into itself as he fell to the floor with a soft thud. He mustered up all his willpower to try and drag his body towards the door, but it was useless. He craned his neck around to see his flailing limbs absorb into the soft, white cotton confines of the evil underwear. Roderick screamed inside his head as he saw the underwear draw ever closer to his indistinguishable face, dragging his torso into its gaping maws. He lost all his energy to struggle as he completely merged with the underwear and was left laying on the cold, tiled floor of the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Try all he might, Roderick couldn&#39;t even muster up a tiny movement. He was in the same predicament as earlier on in the day, only this time there was no knowing if he&#39;d ever be discovered by anyone until the next day. Both of his parents often worked late into the night, occasionally even going full nights without coming home. He was stuck glancing up at the ceiling and the sickly fluorescent lighting above. Roderick eventually decided to disable all of his senses, aside from his hearing. He passed the time imagining all the different kinds of punishments he&#39;d inflict on the sick, twisted bastard who&#39;d forced him into this nightmareish predicament. <br />
<br />
After what felt like hours, he finally heard his dad&#39;s SUV crunch onto the driveway, followed by one of the car doors slamming. He heard keys jingle and twist inside the house door before it swung open and shut. Slow, heavy footsteps walked the perimeter of the house, occasionally punctured by a gruff call of Roderick&#39;s name. He desperately wanted to get the man&#39;s attention and screamed as loud as he could in his mind as if it could make an impact. But instead, the footsteps stopped and Roderick could hear muffled dialogue and music coming from the TV room. He sighed, realising it would take even longer for him to be found now.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the TV was switched off and the footsteps finally stomped up the stairs, coming ever closer to the bathroom. They diverted away from the bathroom and towards his dad&#39;s bedroom. He could make out the shuffling of clothing being taken off. Roderick cringed at the noise and hoped his dad would at least keep his boxer shorts on. Unfortunately, the door finally opened and his dad&#39;s naked physique stood in the door frame, an exasperated look on his face at the mess in the bathroom. &quot;Oh for crying out loud! I keep telling that boy to clean up after himself and he never listens! Is that hair in the bathtub? What was he even thinking... Oh he&#39;s definitely grounded when he gets back from lord knows where...&quot;. He stumbled over to the bathtub to give it a thorough clean, stepping right over Roderick who disabled his sight just as his father&#39;s large manhood dangled over his crumpled form.<br />
<br />
While Roderick and his dad had plenty in common, physically they were almost complete opposites. Rigby was a tough, brawny man who loved lifting weights just as much as he enjoyed eating food. It certainly showed in his physique as he had large muscles adorning his arms and chest, combined with a hefty, taut gut that slightly wobbled with every movement. His body was adorned with plenty of body hair, even rivalling Mr. Grimaldi in density and coverage. Unlike his coach, Roderick&#39;s dad had a full, trimmed beard littered with grey hairs, combined with a horseshoe of greying hair surrounding his otherwise bald scalp. The only thing Roderick inherited from his dad was his trademark honey blonde hair and deep blue eyes. Roderick was often glad that he more resembled the men from his mom&#39;s side of the family. They had slender figures and handsome faces, they were mostly smooth-skinned and managed to avoid losing their hair well into old age. In comparison, his dad&#39;s side of the family were portly, burly men with a barrage of body hair to compensate for them all going bald before they reached thiry. And after keeping a few characteristics of Grimaldi after his original transformation, Roderick began to worry what would happen if his dad were to wear him.<br />
<br />
Rigby muttered curse words and threatening statements while he unclogged the bathtub and cleaned away the remaining hair. Next he reattached the shave guard to his electric trimmer, he didn&#39;t want to accidentally shave his beard off in the morning, and stuck it back into the cabinet. Finally, he picked up the clothes that spread about the bathroom floor. He only recognized one of the shirts as being his. The other shirt and pants were unfamiliar, and bigger than his usual size. Then he came across a clean white pair of briefs adorned with a gold band. He picked them up off the floor and stretched them out with both his hands, studying them under the light. They looked too big to be his son&#39;s yet they looked to be the perfect fit for himself. However he only stuck to boxer shorts, finding briefs fit too uncomfortable around his junk. How they managed to appear in this bathroom was a mystery. He almost chucked them into the pile of other clothes but stopped himself at the last minute. There was something very alluring, almost hyponotizing, about the underwear. He had an urge to try them on. But he couldn&#39;t just put on some strange underwear on a whim. That would be mad! He stroked his beard in thought, the underwear scrunched up in his other hand. They did look like nice underwear, brand new even. He brought them up to his nose and gave them a whiff, finding they smelt just as clean as they looked. &quot;Ah fuck it!&quot; he said with a shrug of his shoulders. He needed something to wear to bed anyway. Rigby opened up the band and stuck both feet through the leg holes. He pulled the underwear up to his hips, snapping the gold waistband against his thighs and adjusting the position of his cock and balls inside the pouch.<br />
<br />
Roderick was mentally screaming, horrified that his own dad would be the one to wear him. His dad even hated briefs! He mentioned it to Roderick every time he bought a pair and now he was just wearing him, now an actual pair of briefs which is still maddening to his mind, out of nowhere! Roderick could pick up the scent of his dad&#39;s sweaty junk and swiftly blocked out all of his senses as his dad pulled him up and up, ever closer towards them. After a few moments, he cautiously activated his sight again to see he was staring at the base of the sink. Looking up, he could see his dad was brushing his teeth. The man leaned over and spat the gunk into the sink, and turned on the taps. A bit of water back-splashed and hit Roderick square in the... He wasn&#39;t exactly sure where since he was just a piece of fabric stretched over his dad&#39;s junk and ass-cheeks. But it didn&#39;t matter since a massive, meaty hand suddenly blocked his view and wiped at the water stain, only really managing to spread the dampness on Roderick&#39;s flimsy body. The hand then re-adjusted the meat contained in his pouch before finally leaving him be. This was already more worse than when Grimaldi wore him. At least he was left alone inside his shorts for most of the time instead of being manhandled all the time. He couldn&#39;t even project his vision up through his dad&#39;s eyes since he was getting ready to go to bed so there wouldn&#39;t be anything to even see.<br />
<br />
There was a sudden jolt of movement as Rigby left the bathroom and entered his bedroom. He stopped in front of the bed to draw back the covers, but it was enough time for Roderick to spot a small mirror standing on the bedside table. What he could see in its reflection was the mid-section of a middle-aged man wearing a pair of white briefs, the front tightly packed and slightly damp with water. He knew with a drop in his non-existent gut that he was that flimsy piece of material that wrapped around his dad&#39;s waist. And he knew that was now his life for the time being, until his dad eventually took him off. Yet as the man swung around and laid down in his king-sized bed, Roderick knew there was no chance of that happening anytime soon.</p>
