<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mikito thinks for a while, “you know, it’s such a hot day,” he then says, “I’d love to go to the beach, but I don’t have my swim shorts with me”.<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckles, “don’t you worry,” he says, “maybe Andy and Cody would like to join us, or at least Cody might burrow you one of his swim shorts”.<br />
<br />
Mikito gets an awkward expression, “um… we… we don’t really get along,” he says, “they… they find me to “weird” for spending time with you”.<br />
<br />
Jeff rolls his eyes, “those two really are asses,” he mumbles, he then smiles at Mikito, “wait here, I think I know where my mom stored my old swim shorts. I’ll be back in a few”.<br />
<br />
“Okay, I’ll wait here,” Mikito says.<br />
<br />
Jeff nods and heads out of the room, heading towards the stairs which lead to the attic.<br />
<br />
When Jeff had left the room, Mikito turns to Jeff’s Laptop, ‘phew, luckily he hasn’t noticed that I created a separate slot with my name,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I really wanna try the game out, but I think it’s best to delete the slot. Besides, I’ve copied the game over to my phone, so no point in having a slot on Jeff’s Laptop,’ the 10-year-old clicks on the file with his name, which had changed from “Mike” to “Mikito” after Mike had changed himself into the young Japanese boy, and deletes it. However, this causes the change to become permanent, and also causes the file in the independent App on Mikito’s phone to vanish too.<br />
<br />
Mikito turns when he hears Jeff return, “I’ve found a shorts that should fit you, Mikito,” Jeff says, smiling and holding up a blue swim short, “why don’t you head into the bathroom and try it on?”<br />
<br />
Mikito takes the swim shorts, “okay,” he says and hurries into the bathroom.<br />
<br />
After locking himself in the bathroom, Mikito takes off his jeans and underwear, he then grabs the swim shorts and for some reason sniff them, ‘they… they smell like Jeff,’ he thinks to himself, blushing hard when he feels his 3 inch cock start to harden, “why… why am I getting a stiffy? I… I don’t understand? Is… is it because I just like Jeff so much?”<br />
<br />
Mikito shakes his head, “focus, Mikito,” he mumbles, “just put the shorts on,” so the boy slips the skintight swim shorts onto his body, “they fit perfectly,” he says, smiling. Since the shorts reach his knees, Mikito decides to just wear his t-shirt, the boy grabs his underwear and jeans and heads back into Jeff’s room.<br />
<br />
Jeff looks up when Mikito returns, the teen smiles, “they look good on you,” he says.<br />
<br />
Mikito rubs the back of his head, grinning a little sheepishly, “th-thanks, they… feel kinda nice,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiles, “if you like them, I don’t mind you keeping them”.<br />
<br />
Mikito’s eyes widen, “y-you serious?”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods and smiles, “yeah,” he says.<br />
<br />
Mikito smiles, “thanks Jeff,” he says.<br />
<br />
“No problem, Mikito,” the teen replies, for some reason, Jeff finds himself looking directly at Mikito’s bulge, ‘damn, he looks big for a ten-year-old,’ he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
“Um… Jeff, why are you staring at my bulge,” Mikito suddenly asks.<br />
<br />
Jeff blinks as if awaken from a trance, “s-sorry… I… I didn’t mean to,” he stutters, blushing hard, “it… it’s just… y-you look bigger than… the… the average… ten-year-old. I… I hope you d-don’t hate me now… I… I really didn’t mean to stare!”<br />
<br />
Mikito looks down at his bulge, “I’m not that big… my penis is only 3 inches,” he says, he then looks up at Jeff, “and I don’t hate you,” he says, blushing a little as he giggles, “actually, I kinda feel proud if you think I’m big… hehe!”<br />
<br />
Jeff smiles and lets out an awkward chuckle, “I’m glad you don’t hate me,” he says, “anyway… ready to go?”<br />
<br />
“Ya, let’s go,” Mikito says, smiling.<br />
<br />
The two leave the house, not bothering to let Andy and Cody know, thinking that wouldn’t care anyway. As they walk to the bus stop, to catch the bus that would take them to the beach, Mikito can’t stop thinking about Jeff staring at his bulge. The 10-year-old is deep in thought, ‘I wonder why Jeff stared at my bulge,’ he thinks to himself, ‘he acted shocked and seemed a little scared when he realized that I had noticed it. I honestly don’t think that the reason he gave me, that he was just surprised about my size, is the real reason. But… what other reason could there be? And why did I get the feeling that he seemed to be curious? He had a curious look on his face, and I feel like he’d like to see… it, but why? He has a girlfriend and I’m a boy… it… it would be wrong to show him… but I don’t wanna see him so sad. I gotta think about it… I’ll keep my eye on him, maybe how he continues to act around me will give me some idea or at least make it easier for me to figure it out’.<br />
<br />
After an hour they finally arrive at the beach and quickly find a nice quiet spot under a palm tree, “ready to hit the waves, Mikito,” Jeff asks, smiling and already taking off his t-shirt.<br />
<br />
“Ya, I’m so ready,” the ten-year-old says, smiling back, taking off his own shirt.<br />
<br />
Jeff doesn’t notice as he stares at Mikito’s athletic figure, ‘he really has an amazing figure,’ he thinks to himself, his eyes then widen when he feels his cock twitch and start to become hard, ‘what the fuck?! Why am I getting an erection? I’m NOT into boys, and certainly NOT into such young ones, besides I have a freaking girlfriend and I am straight!’<br />
<br />
The teen is so shocked and confused that he’s unaware that Mikito noticed Jeff’s bulge becoming bigger in his swim shorts, ‘is… is his penis getting stiff,’ the 10-year-old asks himself, ‘what… what does that mean? Is it because he’s seeing me half naked? But… that can’t be right… he has a girlfriend… why would he get stiffy when seeing me half naked?’<br />
<br />
“You okay, Jeff,” Mikito asks.<br />
<br />
Jeff jolts out of his shocked state, blushing hard, “y-yeah… I’m okay,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Um… why… why is does your bulge look bigger,” Mikito asks.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s eyes widen and he his face seems to become even redder, “I… um… sorry… I guess I was just… thinking about my g-girlfriend,” he stutters, sounding not really convincing. The teen quickly turns around and starts heading for the water, “c-come on… let’s get into the water,” he mumbles over his shoulder.<br />
<br />
Mikito watches Jeff walk away, ‘so… he DOES wanna see me naked,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I should be freaked out… but… I honestly would also like to see him naked… I… I guess I am just curious, and there’s nothing wrong about that, right? I got to check online if I find anything, this is all so new to me, before I ask him… I better do some research… just to be sure’.<br />
<br />
The situation is quickly forgotten as Jeff and Mikito start having fun in the ocean, splashing each other with water, trying to dunk the other under water and just having fun.<br />
<br />
After some time in the water, Mikito and Jeff decide to take a break and head back to their towels. While Jeff is taking a nap, Mikito takes his phone and opens the browser, typing into the search field “why does my penis become stiff?”<br />
<br />
“Your penis erects when the blood flow in your penis increases, this is caused either by sexual stimulation or excitement,” Mikito quietly reads, not wanting to wake Jeff, “what… what is sexual stimulation,” he asks himself. After typing that into the search field, the answer he gets is, “Sexual stimulation, in everyday usage, is anything that leads to, enhances and maintains sexual arousal, and may lead to orgasm”.<br />
<br />
The more Mikito researches the more he believes that the reason why Jeff’s bulge got bigger when the teen had looked at him, is that Jeff seems to be attracted towards Mikito. Mikito turns his head to look at Jeff, who is still sleeping, ‘so… so, that means… I’m also attracted to him,’ he asks himself, ‘because… whenever I think about him, my penis gets all stiffy. But it gets stiff when I think of girls too, though… I honestly am more curious to wanna see Jeff naked, and he seems to wanna see me naked too’. Mikito looks back at his phone, he then types, “what helps against an erection,” into the search field. His eyes widen and he blushes when the answer comes back, “there are couple of ways to deal with an erection. Either the man can masturbate, or a woman can suck on the man’s penis, or the man can insert his penis into the woman, this is known as sex, and if the man should shoot his sperm into the woman, this can cause the woman to fall pregnant and birth a baby”.<br />
<br />
Mikito’s eyes widen and he looks over at Jeff, ‘is… is that the reason he is so unhappy,’ he asks himself, ‘does… does Jeff really want ME to make him pregnant? But… but he’s a boy… boys can’t get pregnant. But… I wanna see Jeff happy… I wanna make him happy… maybe… maybe I can at least make him happy if… if I have sex with him? I… I’m so curious… I wonder what it would feel like’. Mikito blushes more as he feels his 3 inch cock erect, the 10-year-old bites his lower lip as he stares down at his growing bulge, then back at Jeff, a smile then appears on his face, ‘ya… I gotta know and it would make us both happy,’ he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
The ten-year-old decides to try out the game he had transferred onto his phone, opening the App, the boy first reads the manual, raising an eyebrow in skepticism, ‘yeah… as IF that is possible,’ he thinks to himself, the former grown up completely forgotten who he truly is, Mikito looks over at Jeff, ‘but… if it really should work… I… I could make Jeff even happier by transforming him into a girl, that way he’ll be able to become pregnant and birth babies! That is what he wants after all: become pregnant and create a family!’<br />
<br />
Mikito turns back to his phone, ‘maybe I should do a small test first,’ he thinks to himself, ‘just to be sure that it actually works’. The ten-year-old thinks for a while, ‘what if I make myself older? Maybe 14,’ he asks himself, ‘that would be cool, then I would not have to deal with Andy, Cody and all the others in school being so mean to me. There might even be a way to cause me going to the same school as Jeff! Then we could see each other every day! That would be SO cool!’</p>
