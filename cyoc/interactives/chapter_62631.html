<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Carter was sound asleep dreaming of being Ryan Standish.  It was a hot night, and he was sleeping naked except <br />
for his living jockstrap. The jockstrap wrapped around Carter's manhood was soaked with sweat and straining <br />
with  Carter's morning wood.  In the dream, Carter was Ryan quarterbacking the team during the Championship <br />
game.  All the plays seemed to come so effortlessly to Ryan.  He was staring at the guy's tight bubble butt in <br />
front of him getting ready to hike the ball. He licked his lips admiring the center's butt, and wishing the <br />
seams would split on both of their football shorts, except in different places.  He was eyeing the center's <br />
butt and slowly calling out numbers, &quot;69, hut, 69, hut, ...&quot;.  He couldn't believe it, the seam going down the <br />
butt crack and torn and was starting to unravel to display the the guy's anus, as he stood there with his legs <br />
spread bent over the ball. &quot;Hut, 13, hut 23,...&quot;drawled Ryan slowly. He could feel his own football pants <br />
changing into a crotchless pair.  His cock was rock hard. He moved in close for the hand off, &quot;5, 4, 3, 2, 1, <br />
HIKE!&quot; he shouted. His cock head pressed as the resisting hole and pushed deep inside.  He glanced at the <br />
jersey of the player he was fucking and recognized his own -Carter's-number. Carter was shrinking around <br />
Ryan's member.  Ryan held the football, and ran through the opposing team's line effortlessly.  His football <br />
uniform pants were whole again-sort of.  You couldn't see his bare skin, instead you saw a tight fabric <br />
version of Carter's head with his mouth pushed out and tented by Ryan's massive boner.  Then everything <br />
exploded. Hundreds of players came out of nowhere and tackled Ryan.  His cock exploded as it was drilled into <br />
the grass and ground. <br />
<br />
Carter sat up in bed exposing his naked upper body. The noise hadn't been bodies crashing down on him, but his <br />
desk chair toppling over a very naked Horst, Carter's gym bag, shoes, and his small Superman trashcan. It was <br />
still dark. Carter stared at Horst in the dim light from his digital clock. Carter was breathing hard due to <br />
his untimely sudden wakening.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing here, Horst?  How did you get in?  Do you know what time it is?&quot; Carter whisper shouted as <br />
he hoped that his parents wouldn't hear him and wouldn't have heard the commotion Horst had already created.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, sorry,&quot; Horst whispered apologetically, &quot;I know you sleep in the nude...&quot; His voice trailed off as he <br />
sought for words.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you came to join me?&quot; Carter asked dubiously.<br />
<br />
Horst apparently had forgotten he was naked, as he looked down at himself.  He blushed in the darkness and <br />
whispered loudly, &quot;No!&quot;  Then in a softer voice he added, &quot;I thought about Ryan lying rolled up and rumpled on <br />
the floor with your other discarded clothing, and figured it was already tomorrow - I mean today, and it's my <br />
turn to wear Ryan.&quot; He licked his lips and paused as he considered his next words, &quot;Anyway, I came over. Your <br />
house was still dark.  So I climbed the oak tree and came through your bedroom window.  Then I saw you were <br />
asleep, and the room was dark. I figured that I should strip down, so that when I found Ryan on the floor it <br />
would be easier to put him on. Anyway, I found your regular jockstrap - the red Safe-T one, but in the dark on <br />
the floor, I could only tell by feel that it was a jockstrap.  I figured it was Ryan, and pulled on it, but <br />
apparently, it was tangled around your floor lamp's electrical cord, and well that came crashing down on me, <br />
and I jumped back and tripped over your gym bag and toppled your chair, and I'm sorry. I should have woken you <br />
up first, but you were dreaming and moaning and gawd, your sheets were tented. So I didn't want to - uh, <br />
where's Ryan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Oh, I'm wearing him,&quot; Carter answered.  He paused, &quot;I was so tired when I got home, I just lay down for <br />
a few minutes to rest and I fell asleep wearing him.&quot; He suddenly felt nervous about his dream and being <br />
tented when Horst had come in.  He felt certain from the softening of his damp cock and the empty feeling in <br />
his balls that he had had a wet dream.  Carter was seeing more clearly now.  It wasn't just that he was waking <br />
up more, or that his eyes were adjusting more to the dark, it was that sky out the window was now light grey.  <br />
The sun would be rising soon.  It was already early dawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? You want to peel him off and toss him over here?&quot; Horst asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding?  It's still night. I'm going back to sleep.  You can go home or climb into bed with me to <br />
wait. You can put Ryan on when the sun's up, just don't wake me taking him off me,&quot; groaned Carter, as he lay <br />
down and rolled over into far side of his bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh?&quot; said Horst. Then he shrugged, and dropped the red jockstrap he was still holding and climbed into the <br />
bed next to Carter.  The spot he was now lying in was soaked with Carter's sweat. Horst was glad Carter was <br />
facing away, as his own cock rose to full staff tenting Carter's sheets. Horst closed his eyes to rest. He <br />
dozed briefly.</p>
