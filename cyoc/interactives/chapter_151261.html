<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After his immensely satisfying masturbation session and leaving a horrible mess on his parents&#39; carpet, he slowly stood back up and sauntered back into their bathroom. The tap is still running. All he had to do, was lift the round pin thing to turn on the showerhead. <br />
<br />
This was easier said than done. It was small and round, and it was difficult to get his mouth around it as there wasn&#39;t much room for his huge snout. Everything is a problem with the body of a donkey in a world made for opposable thumbs and fingers! He&#39;s had trouble opening doors, turning on lights and now trying to turn on a shower.<br />
<br />
Well, at least he was able to do so with a bit of effort and perseverence. Donkeys can&#39;t otherwise give themselves showers, as those are usually behind closed locked doors, in narrow doorways and small bathrooms. At least his parents&#39; bathroom was large. Large enough for an overweight fully gown jackass to comfortably move around in. <br />
<br />
After several tries and grunting donkey brays, he finally managed to turn on the shower head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hhhhhhaaaawwwww,&quot; he contentedly sighed outward as he stepped his front half into the tub and underneath the warmish-cool sprinkling water. <br />
<br />
Though the tub&#39;s basin was made for a human, it was actually fairly large. Large enough to fit half a donkey inside! And so, he got as much of his body under the spray as he could. It was so refreshing that he just stood there on all fours with his eyes closed.<br />
<br />
He began to daydream about how terrible it would be for a human boy to have the body of a donkey for more than 24 hours. He was fine with this body for less than an hour to go, with each minute ticking towards the end of his nightmarish ordeal. But to be stuck as a donkey for the rest of his life? &quot;Haaaaaawww,&quot; he sighed in disgust.<br />
<br />
After about a half hour, he started to get slightly bored, just standing around in the showrer. But at least it&#39;s much better than just standing around in an open field eating grass for half the day, and just standing there for the other half doing nothing at all. Or standing in a barn, also doing nothing at all. With nothing to do, and no abilities to do it. <br />
<br />
And so, he waited out his time until mere seconds remained.<br />
<br />

<br />
*FLASH!* <br />
<br />
Instantly, he was back in his room behind closed doors, standing on TWO legs, naked! <br />
<br />
&quot;Whhhaaaa?&quot; he breathed out, not actually believing he would be able to say anything other than &quot;hhaaawwww&quot; <br />
<br />
He sharply breathed back in, opened his eyes, and looked down. There! Two hairless human legs on a short, thin human torso! Standing on a BROWN wooden floor! <br />
<br />
Lifting an arm up, he sees a hairless skinny stick. Forcing his mind to adjust to having hands, he tries flexing them. And they move! He begins wiggling his fingers as a smile spreads across his face! He looks at his other arm and does the same! He wiggles his toes while he was standing upright on two legs. <br />
<br />
He started giggling, then laughing. A child&#39;s laughter in the midst of puberty as a new teenager! (His 13th birthday was just 2 weeks ago.) He lifts both arms above his head, and peers at his hairless armpits. He uses his hands to feel his own body.<br />
<br />
Laughing some more, noticing he can make a sound other than &quot;EEERRGGHHH HHHAAWW&quot; he runs to his full-length closet mirror and sees his former….his CURRENT self….staring back at him! It worked! He&#39;s not a donkey any more! Not ever again! He won&#39;t have to be stuck eating grass and standing around all day, every day! The chronivac worked! <br />
<br />
Staring back at him from the mirror with short, dark brown hair and piercing blue eyes on a perfect body with blemish-free hairless skin, is him!! He looks down between his newly-aquired human legs, and sees a small penis. A pathetically small penis. It was actually kind of…..cute! Cute!? &quot;I&#39;m cute!&quot; He realizes how good he actually looks, and even better, how he feels. <br />
<br />
It&#39;s like the feeling of being buried alive in a small coffin, unable to do anything, then instantly being free and moving about freely. It was a most wonderful feeling, to be a boy again! <br />
<br />
Laughing some more, Jeff turns around to look at the damages of his smelly gross room. And notices nothing out of place! No disgusting mess on the floor. No broken floor boards. The bedroom door back on its hinges in one piece on its door frame where it belongs!<br />
<br />
Pleasantly surprised, he ran to his door, lifted his arm slowly, and slowly spread his FINGERS! He easily grasped the doorknob and turned it to the right. He then pulls the door open with ease! <br />
<br />
Peering out into the hallway with his new sharpened eyesight, he saw everything in bright, colorful detail! Again, no broken floor boards. No smashed door. No donkey piss or semen anywhere. <br />
<br />
He stepped outside his room through the door frame that was much larger than his human boy frame without the slightest bit of struggle! He was able to easily and quickly race to the hallway light and use his nimble human fingers to flick it on. He went to his parents&#39; room to make sure no mess existed there either. He was not disappointed. The chronivac must have put everything back the way it&#39;s supposed to be!<br />
<br />
Curiosity got the better of him, and he went to their bathroom to check out those mirrors with that mysterious door. But then, his parents walked through the door downstairs! <br />
<br />
&quot;Honey? Jeff? We&#39;re home early,&quot; his mom said.<br />
<br />
This made his heart leap, but looking around, there was no reason to worry. Everything was as it should be. <br />
<br />
Breathing a sigh of relief that came out like a human-sounding sigh rather than a donkey-sounding &quot;haaawwww,&quot; he quickly left their room and shut the door. Wondering why they were home so early, he cleared his throat and asked just that in his human boyish voice. Puberty just setting in for him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you home so early?&quot;<br />
<br />
Going over to the staircase, he felt a draft, looked down, and noticed he was naked! As a donkey, it didn&#39;t seem to matter so much. Especially since he was home alone. But now his parents would wonder what he was up to, and he saved himself the embarrassment by quickly racing to his bedroom to at least put on a pair of shorts. He threw on a shirt as well. As he was putting on his clothes, he heard his mom&#39;s muffled voice say:<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that, dear?&quot;<br />
<br />
Coming back out of his room, this time barefoot while relishing the feel of the different floor material between his hardwood bedroom floor and the carpeted hallway floor under his soft and sensitive boy feet, he asked again:<br />
<br />
&quot;Why you home so early?&quot; he said as he walks down the stairs to greet his parents. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well, one of the partners had a family emergency and we decided to end things early,&quot; said dad&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How was your day?&quot; mom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was good mom. A little boring,&quot; not exactly lying, but not exactly truthful.<br />
<br />
&quot;You do anything fun?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, just stayed home and played a few games,&quot; Jeff outright lied that time. What was he supposed to tell them anyway?<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, tonight we are going to take you out to dinner and a movie, since you&#39;ve been good. We might as wel anyway, since we have no plans.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff and his parents went to dinner and a movie later that evening. When Jeff put on his shoes and socks, he tried wiggling his toes. But felt constrained. Strangely, his little penis started getting hard. He decided to forgo his shoes and just wear sandals instead. Besides, it was promising to be a hot and humid summer night. Wouldn&#39;t at all be out of the ordinary for him to wear his sandals out.<br />
<br />
The following day, he got to hang out with his best friends, Ant and Vin. They are identical Italian twins, and really cool dudes. All summer long, they would be out riding bikes, playing football, or swimming. Jeff also played baseball on the local Little League team. He tried to get the twins to play as well, but their love was football. <br />
<br />
Jeff made the All-Star team that summer, and had tournaments all through late summer into August. His team was finally eliminated deep in Regional play, and they had to come home; his baseball season over with. He used the rest of summer to hang out with his friends, go to family functions, and eat lots of BBQ chicken and watermelon. He had a great childhood, and it was a glorious summer. However, school would start soon and he was going into middle school that year. 7th grade.</p>
