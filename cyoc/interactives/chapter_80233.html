<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff looked at his middle age body and was surprised that he looked exactly like his dad, with the exception of the eye color.  Taking a few quick poses, he could tell that his dad was athletic back in the day.  But as he looked at himself, something just occurred to him.  If he’s around the same age as his dad and if his father saw him, he would freak out about it.  Jeff had to do something and quick before that happens.  He knows that dad is downstairs watching TV and it will be a matter time before he comes upstairs to see him the way he is now.  He had to do something a quick before he suspects something or call the cops.<br />
<br />
Just then, an idea popped up in his head.  If Jeff is at his father’s age, why not make him Jeff’s original age.  It would seem all too perfect.  All he had to do is change his father’s age both physically and mentally.  But then he would be concerned about the fact that his entire family would see him like that as well.  Not to mention his own dad will get confused about this strange man in the room.  He had to do something and fast before things could get complicated.  Thinking this through, he decided to change reality and mentally change them all, so that way they all might think he’s both a father and husband.  Nodding in approval, he went on the Chronivac and decided to make some changes.<br />
<br />
He started by entering his father’s name so it won’t complicate things.  Next he starts changing his father’s age to sixteen just like he used to be.  He then went to the mental change option and chose ‘yes’ on the drop down list.  Finally, he went to the aware toggle and selected off with the exception of himself.  The last thing he wants is to forget what he is and what age he used to be.  Once he got the information down and started to skim it.  All he had to do is to get the time limit for the change.  Thinking this one through, he decided ten minutes.  Not too fast, not too slow.  Perfect enough for a slow and steady change.  Once he’s ready, he moved the mouse icon to the start button and clicked on it.  Just then, another window popped up stating that if he really wants to do this.  Reading the warning, he decided to do it anyways and clicked the ‘yes’ icon.  The moment he saw the timer counting down, he sat back, and waits for the end result to happen.<br />
<br />
Back downstairs, Jeff’s father, whose name is John, was sitting on his sofa watching the game with a beer in his hand.  He’s forty-seven just like his son after the Chronivac with a beer belly, thinning hair with gray streaks, and worn out face.  He was wearing a suit since he got back from working at accounting and decided to take a little football break.  As he was watching the game, he looked up and wondered about his son.  “Hmm…  Jeff’s been quiet upstairs as of late.” he said feeling a little curious, “I wonder what he’s up to?”  Just as he was thinking about that, a cool breeze hit him from out of nowhere.  At first he thought that it was the air conditioning that went a little high, so he brushed it off and continued watching.  What he didn’t know is that the Chronivac Jeff is using is doing the work and he was beginning to regress through his forties.<br />
<br />
It started less noticeable though, but was showing signs of his youth returning.  His muscles were beginning to tense up and slowly regaining it’s tone as his beer belly began to deflate.  Some extra strands began to grow in as he was loosing his bald spot while gray follicles started to faded to replace with black.  His clothes remained the same, but his tie started to unloosen itself and was now hanging on his neck.  He even feels more relaxed then before, almost like he had a few demotions going.  As he was watching the TV, he looked at the stairs and decided to see if his son is doing something important.  He then said, “You know what?  I should go check what Jeff is doing.  I mean it’s not like I have anything else better to do right?”  So he turned off the TV and got out of the sofa, heading to Jeff’s room.  As he started to head there, he left his forties behind and was traveling back to his thirties.<br />
<br />
His bodies kept on gaining muscles while his belly was slightly fat and showing off his abs underneath the button shirt.  His face was youthening too as his wrinkles looked less noticeable and the skull structure was hardening.  There was not much balding on his head as more hair continues to grow in and there was a few gray hairs were visible on his black color.  His suit kept on changing as the first few buttons on the top unbuttoned themselves to reveal his undershirt and he slowly took his jacket off and put it on the coat rack.   As he reached the stairs, the thirty-five year old, looked on and was a little concerned about Jeff.  “I wonder what Jeff is up to?” he asked himself, “Hope it isn’t anything too private.”<br />
<br />
Slowly, he reached up the stairs in order to get to his son’s room.  But every step he took, he gets younger and younger.  Soon enough, he left his thirties and entered his twenties.  His body now looked like a medium body builder.  He now has strong pecs, hard six pack abs, and toned up arms and legs.  His face has no wrinkles and had some grizzled looks and a bit of stubble on his face.  Plus his hair is back to the way it was, with no baldness and gray anywhere.  As he entered his twenties, his clothes changed some more.  His white-buttoned shirt opened up fully and changed texture to something more fitting.  The color darkened to a black color and went from soft to leather with buttons disappearing to replace it with a zipper.  The shirt underneath changed colors from white to dark blue and has a design on it made for young adults.  His dark pants lightened to dark blue and turned rough, making them look like blue jeans.  And his dress shoes changed into a pair of Nike sneakers.  The strangest thing that happened to him was that the wedding ring he had back when he was in his thirties disappeared off his finger, making him single again.  Not only that, but his mind and reality around him altered to match his age.  By the time he reached the top of the stairs, he was a twenty-four year old college student on the verge of graduating.  He looked to the right and saw the door that leads to Jeff’s room.  He smiled and said in his youthening tone, “Let’s see what my younger bro is doing.  I bet he’s just playing video games or something.”  Another thing is that his life was altered as well.  Instead of thinking of Jeff as a son, John thinks of him as a brother.  But he has no idea that Jeff is a middle age man he used to be.  He then turns to the right and headed to Jeff’s room.  As he was heading straight to that room, he regressed past his twenties and entered his teen years.<br />
<br />
Slowly but surely, his adult attributes were slowly loosing itself as he approached his teenage looks.  He was already beginning to shrink as he want below five feet, his muscles was slowing melting away, leaving him a little gawky and skinny.  Yet they were skill toned for a young teen.  His face started to cross the barriers from adult to childhood as his face is rounded, his nose was growing smaller, eyes were starting to grow big, and a pimple or two here and there.  His hair brightened and grew a little shorter into a style for teens.  His clothes shifted to teen looks with his shirt changing colors to red with a skateboarding logo on it, his pants changing to faded blue jeans, and shoes turning into Converse sneakers.  As he reached the room, John took a breather and slowly started to turn the knob, without noticing that reality changed yet again.<br />
<br />
Inside what was once Jeff’s room, Jeff felt everything changing around him and liked it.  “Wow…” he said in sure belief, “That was something different.”  Looking around his room, he noticed that a lot has changed.  It's still the same room as before, but this time all the names of homework and honors had been changed from his name to his father’s, John.  When he looked at the mirror, he noticed that he changed as well as the same suit his father had on was now on him.  Turning to get a good profile in, he smiled and said, “I got to admit, I look good in a suit.”  As he was admiring himself in the mirror, he didn’t notice the door opening near him.  That was when he heard a young voice from not far from him.<br />
<br />
“Dad, what are you doing in my room!?”<br />
<br />
Jeff turned around and sees his father, looking like the exact replica of himself, looking shocked and angry.  “You know my room is off limits!  Why are you here?” John said feeling a little angry.  Jeff looked at his now son and said, “Sorry John, it’s just that I got a little lost and stumbled upon your room by mistake.  But rest assure, it won’t happen again.”  John crossed his arms and said in an irritating tone, “Well for your same dad, it better be the last.  Now out!”  Raising his hands in defeat and slowly left the room.  Once John closed the door, Jeff smiled and said, “So now I’m the father and dad is my son.  This is going to be very interesting…”  He started to walk away and was ready to take over as his dad.  But what is he going to do?”</p>
