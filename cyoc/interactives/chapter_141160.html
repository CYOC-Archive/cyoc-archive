<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris mewled as the musclefreaks above him made out with one another. He could here their sloppy kisses and bovine moans as their huge bodies ground up against one another, their hands roaming across their sculpted, gargantuan physiques, their fingers playing with the dense forests of body hair that covered their testosterone-suffused bodies. Dom&#39;s huge cock spasmed inside his ass, lubed with the sheer volume of pre-seed that would&#39;ve rivaled the loads of the entire wrestling squad he was on. Jeff powerslammed forward at the same time, his giant shaft stretching Chris&#39; mouth and throat well past what was humanly possible. The teenbeast&#39;s pubes scratched against Chris&#39; face as he mounted down to the hilt, pulling himself closer to the other giant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, fuck,&quot; Jeff wheezed, pulling his mouth away from Dom&#39;s hungry maw, strands of their mixed saliva running down their strong chins. Jeff&#39;s eyes rolled back and he let loose a low moan. &quot;I... I&#39;m cumming,&quot; he roared. Chris&#39; eyes went wide as the pelvis in front of him began to buck violently into his abused face. Dominic roared moments later, his cock engorging itself as he too began to blow, his oversized nuts pulling agonizingly tight against his body. Chris&#39; eyes roll back as his gullet is filled from both ends, his body stretching as his tight mouth and ass keep all of the muscle-monsters&#39; load inside him. His stomach began to stretch and a wave of contentment washed over him. Minutes passed and he felt pleasantly full.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god,&quot; Dominic whimpered, finally coming down from his afterglow high after a minutes-long orgasm. His dick twitched as it softened inside his tiny lover, but Jeff&#39;s elephant balls continued to blow, the bigger beast clenching his jaws as he continued to unload into his &#39;little&#39; brother. He stared down in a mix of fascination and horror as he watched his best friend&#39;s stomach bloat further and further. There was no way a human could possibly survive the sheer amount of liquid being pushed into them!<br />
<br />
Jeff shoved Chris off his cock and let the last few blasts of his seed splatter across his heavy abs and chest, rubbing his titanic shaft with both hands and grinned like a fool. Chris let out a small burp, tasting his brother&#39;s seed mixed with Dominic&#39;s. The small, bloated emo looked like he was pregnant with octuplets and he rubbed his belly. He always knew he could take some giant loads, but never did he think he&#39;d be able to take that!<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeez, C-Chris, are you okay?!&quot; Dom whined, moving forward and placing his hand on Chris&#39; stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, Dom, you know I can take guys like you,&quot; Chris cooed lightly. He&#39;d always been stretchy, found that out when he accidentally ordered the biggest dildo in the catalogue and took it without any trouble.<br />
<br />
Chris sat up, Jeff and Dom helping him with his giant belly. The tiny emo leaned up and kissed Dom sweetly, their cocks going hard once more. Chris&#39; head was jerked to the side as Jeff wanted a turn. Dominic began to furiously beat off as the two brothers began to make out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmhmm, I could go for another round,&quot; Jeff snarled, more of a demand than a suggestion. Dominic nodded dumbly and Chris...<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll have to empty myself a little first,&quot; the emo said with a wink. The raven-haired twink stood and as best he could, sashayed out of his room, letting Dominic and Jeff&#39;s tongues hang out of their mouths like dogs as they ogled his sensuous ass. As he turned the corner, he could already hear Jeff pounce on top of Dominic, his huge brother completely dominating his best friend. It only made him hornier and he rushed to the bathroom so that he could join them as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
Chris sat on the toilet, the whole house shaking as Jeff and Dominic went at it down the hall. Chris nursed his small, 4&quot; prick underneath his bloated belly. He tensed his stomach and felt an unholy release from his bowels, pearly white liquid gushing out as his body purged itself of Dominic and Jeff&#39;s cum. As his belly deflated, he chuckled, &quot;Guess being stretchy has it&#39;s advantages.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he made his way back to his room, two animal, guttural bellows blasted from inside, the whole house shaking enough for him to be knocked off his standing. He tumbled into Jeff&#39;s room next door. His surroundings were so unfamiliar, cum stains on the ceiling, walls an floors, bodybuilding trophies and pictures of freaky mass-monsters on all his posters. This wasn&#39;t the brother he remembered. And something else he never saw in his brother&#39;s room, a small device attached to his PC.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chronivac 4.0, what the heck is that?&quot; Chris hummed, his giant balls jostling and his tiny prick standing at attention as he looked at the stats of a giant on screen. &quot;Damn, my brother really is huge!&quot; 650 pounds, 6&#39;9&quot;, unf what a beast! He flicked through the tabs to Subject 2 and Subject 1, Dominic and himself. &quot;What is this all for...&quot; He clicked on his own profile and wondered what would happen if he clicked the &#39;return to default&#39; button.<br />
<br />
What happened shocked him. He watched as the preview of the image of himself onscreen changed. The man onscreen, his hair shortened from his shoulder length locks to a sporty hair cut and lightened from black to blond. He grew taller, his muscles filling out. The man&#39;s cock filled out from his pathetic 4&quot; to a thick, mouthwatering 8.5&quot;. His balls shrank from his giant jugs to respectable lime sized testes.<br />
<br />
Chris&#39; stomach twisted into knots. Jeff had changed him somehow. He looked at the hunk on the screen, beefy, muscular and hairy, sharp blue eyes and strong facial features. He realized he was supposed to have a girlfriend too. That was supposed to be him? A wave of revulsion washed over him... he was... he was so...<br />
<br />
Mundane.<br />
<br />
Sure, the guy on screen was hot, but Chris couldn&#39;t bear to think of what life would&#39;ve been like if he couldn&#39;t take two sexed up musclefreaks at the same time, if he couldn&#39;t survive their epic loads being pumped into them. How could he live if he couldn&#39;t take massive cocks up his ass and slurp down dick as well as he could now? How the heck was he supposed to devour cock in his mouth and ass all day if he was with a girl? He shook his head, he&#39;d never go back to being that Chris again.<br />
<br />
Still... he looked at all the options on the Chronivac. He would bend reality to fit his subby, twinkish desires...<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
As Jeff pounded Dominic&#39;s ass relentlessly, howling with atavistic delight, he knew something was going on, the world around him shifting subtly... He groaned as Dominic&#39;s ass felt so tight against his titanic rod. And then he realized why. His eyes went wide as Dom&#39;s physique began to billow out, his muscles audibly groaning as they added more mass and might. The huge beast&#39;s moans grew louder, deeper and more inhuman. Veins writhed along his giant arms which only grew thicker, hairs sprouting out of his pores like a growing forest.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, Jeff, fill me up, bro!&quot; Dominic snarled, his voice deeper and more dominant that before. &quot;Aw fuck, do I gotta do everything, man?&quot; he roared. He sat up and flung Jeff to the bed onto his back. Jeff whimpered as he stared up at the massive monstrosity of muscle Dominic was becoming. &quot;Man, you and your bro are so small,&quot; Dom chuckled. The huge, and increasingly hairier, beast cradled Jeff of the bed and sat his hairy ass down on Jeff&#39;s waiting cock. The now smaller muscleman yowled as Dom pistoned himself onto Jeff&#39;s cock.<br />
<br />
Jeff could barely make out Dom&#39;s face as his pecs grew to ever increasingly huge proportions. Dominic was a literal mountain of muscle and Jeff&#39;s cock couldn&#39;t take anymore. He let out a pathetic whine as he flooded Dom&#39;s ass with cum. The bigger man chuckled lewdly as he rode Jeff&#39;s cock, wanting more.<br />
<br />
Dominic sat up, pleasantly filled by Jeff&#39;s meager offering, though he was still hungry for more. For his part, Jeff shot up and looked at the door. He knew this was Chris&#39; doing. He stormed his way to the door...</p>
