<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The teacher tapped her chin thoughtfully, fascinated by a series of events that was unusual even for the standards of this school. &quot;Personally, I think you&#39;d be missing out an incredible experience to seperate so quickly,&quot; she commented, before letting out a small sigh. &quot;But if you insist on undoing this merging, then yes, I believe I can still filter you all out. I only need to warn you, it may be... messy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Messy?&quot; All four girls asked in unison, three of them raising their eyebrows as Sofia tried to do the same, but failed. When one of them spoke again, it was Rhonda. &quot;Messy as in... like... blood and gore? Please tell me no blood and gore.&quot; She&#39;d been a zombie for a few days, a few Halloweens ago, and by no means did she want to endure feelings like necrosis or chunks of flesh being knocked off yet again. One time through that hellish experience had been more than enough.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, Wandler shook her head. &quot;Not at all. Messy as in, you may find some of your transformationas have been spread out and shared. Now that you&#39;ve all shared a body, a certain amount of magic will be present in all of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The four girls looked between themselves, before offering up a unified shrug. All four of them had already been changed in plenty of ways - at this point, they all just wanted to be changed as their own individual people. This was all the confirmation Miss Wandler needed in order to begin chanting and drawing runes upon the air, taking a few moments to cast the spell and let their collective anxiety build up before a bolt of occult energy lashed out, striking them in the gut.<br />
<br />
For a moment, the world went completely white, a buzzing filling Rhonda&#39;s ears that was not unlike the one time she&#39;d gotten flashbanged. The only sensation that permeated the bright void was a feeling of being yanked, quite violently, in four different directions all at the same time. She would&#39;ve groaned if she could move her mouth, but as it stood, Rhonda could do little but float helplessly in the emptiness, begging inside her head for it to clear so that she could know what had happened.<br />
<br />
Relief from the blinding came slowly, her vision very gradually returning and needing a moment for both eyes to get aligned again. The first thing she witnessed was at least quite pleasant: the face of May, eyes-half open to reveal that they still bore slits, adorable horns and scales still framing her pretty face. It made her heart skip just a beat, though fear quickly took over as she glanced down, expecting to see that their necks still connected to the same torso.<br />
<br />
Miraculously, this wasn&#39;t the case. Concerningly, May&#39;s torso was not at all how it had looked before. Aside of the fact that she was stark naked, causing the latina to blush hard, the violet-colored scales traveled all the way down her body. The color, though, it wasn&#39;t quite the same as their merged scales had been. It wasn&#39;t purple, but white, a porcalien just like her doll-arm had been. As her eyes trailed over the rest of her bare body, she could tell that the whole of the girl&#39;s skin was smooth save for where the dragon-scales were found. Her arms and legs had the scale patterns too, a tail slipping out from her rear end, but her skin was otherwise plastic-smooth, balls of black material sitting in place of her joints.<br />
<br />
As an equally plasticy pair of wings stretched out behind her back, Rhonda glanced over to the other side of herself to find that Abigail was in a shape that was different yet familiar. She, too, had horns and scales and slitted eyes, but her own scales were the same color as her skin, more bumbs on her skin than changes in color. She was rubbing her head, pressing down on her legs, and seemingly horrified to find that her entire body was somewhat stretchy. The whole of her form ahd become rubbery just like her ass, causing her to squeak as she experimentally flexed her wings - oh god, they squeaked so very much.<br />
<br />
Muttered obscenities in German drew her attention to Sofia sitting in front of her. Unlike Abigal and May, she lacked human skin, still appearing to be a slime girl, but her humanoid shape was more solid now. More like jello than pure goop. She too had draconic features, the shape of a dragon-morph girl in purple slime that was, if nothing else, holding its shape better. The dark core inside her chest still pulsated as she stood up, glancing down over herself before looking up at Rhonda with wide eyes. Without a word she picked up a mirror, allowing Rhonda to get a glimpse of her own bodily state.<br />
<br />
It was... quite something, that was certain.<br />
<br />
The other girls had become a mix of their own prior transformations and Rhonda&#39;s draconic features - but Rhonda, the centerpiece of the grand merge, had taken something from all of them. Though she&#39;d returned to having her black scales and auburn hair, her skin had become a smooth, rubbery, stretcy, tough like an especially hard ceramic yet with a bit of a rubber-like stretch. Completely hairless, too. All along the skin, her veins had taken on a light purple glow, going so far as to cause the red parts of her eyes to appear gooey and violet, as if there was nothing but slime in place of her blood. She had, at least, retained the consdierable mammaries - all four of them, and four arms, though at least all of these limbs and endowments were her own.<br />
<br />
Her tail swished out to cover her indecency... and was followed by three more tails. She was half expecting to turn around as she stood up to find four legs, but at least her body hadn&#39;t gone <i>that far</i>. All four girls were dumbfounded to various degrees, and in this opening of awkward silence, Miss Wandler was all too eager to enter. &quot;As I said, messy - but I think you&#39;ve turned out rather splendidly!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You call this splendid?!&quot; Abigail screeched, squeaking as she turned towards the teacher. &quot;I&#39;m some kind of... car tire, in the shape of a dragon! You have to change us back!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can assure you, the rubber your body now consists of is far better than anything on a vehicle. And I can&#39;t change any of you back - these transformations are all affected by the curse, and are permanent for the semester.&quot; She smirked a little bit as she conjured up a set of new uniforms for the altered, butt-naked girls. &quot;I&#39;d suggest you learn to enjoy the noises.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a furious growl from Abigail as she grabbed her new clothes and stomped right out, likely intending to petition the principal for special permissions that she wasn&#39;t likely to be granted. The other three girls were quick to start getting dressed, all of them finding it awkward and difficult - Sofia and May because they didn&#39;t know how to put on a shirt with wings, and Rhonda because she now had four tails to contend with and the strange way in which fabric rubbed against her altered skin.<br />
<br />
No sooner had they gotten clad in their outfits than was Wandler ushering them out of the room, right past students now entering for the next class. No small number of looks, more than a few of them lustful, were thrown towards the trio of varied dragon-morphs, Rhonda most of all. If nothing else, she supposed that the rapid spiral of transformations was making her one of the school&#39;s most notable - and notably attactive - young women. It was a better result than most of her transformations.<br />
<br />
Sofia offered up a short goodbye before heading off to her next class, clearly being more concerned with just trying not to be late. May, however, spun to stand in front of Rhonda, wings pulled in tight as she put her arms behind her back and smiled up at the latina. &quot;Things are never boring around you, are they?&quot; she asked, eyes briefly flitting down to Rhonda&#39;s quad-chest before their draconic eyes met once again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m a magnet for excitement, at least.&quot; She let out a nervous little laugh. &quot;Sorry you&#39;ve ended up being changed so much. I... I didn&#39;t even know this could happen...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly?&quot; She reached a hand up and caressed one of her horns, the other trailing along some of her white scales. &quot;A doll-dragon-girl is a pretty cool thing to end up as.&quot; She smiled wider. &quot;Y&#39;know, I&#39;m free for lunch, if maybe you want to hang out... have a bit of dragon-morph quality time...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ohhhh, she was close to saying yes, so very close, but something occurred to her. &quot;I&#39;ve got to go meet somebody... don&#39;t know how long that&#39;ll take.&quot; To cut off any potential disappointment, one of her tails reached forward, trailing along the line of scales running down May&#39;s leg. &quot;But if we have time, after I&#39;m done... you bet we&#39;re gonna have some quality time.&quot;<br />
<br />
This seemed to satisfy the doll-girl, and she nodded. &quot;Gonna hold you to that.&quot; She quickly stood up on her toes, planting a hurried peck on Rhonda&#39;s cheek and leaving her to blush like crazy as she dashed off. She wanted nothing more than to be following right after May to somewhere nice and secluded... but she&#39;d made a promise to Margo to meet her today, and offer up her decision. A decision she was going to have to actually make shortly - in all the time spent dealing with slimegirls and merging, she hadn&#39;t really come to a final decision.<br />
<br />
It probably was worth joining this council. She already had a reputation around the school - plenty of other transformees probably looked upon her with envy, considering how much she&#39;d lucked out with her alterations. Not to mention she&#39;d be able to gain some influence, something that might come in handy if Abigail tried something. On the other hand... did she really need that kind of stress, and that much of a target on her back? She&#39;d come here to hang out with her best friend and maybe date a cute girl or too, and in a few days it seemed like she was rocketing up to become this inhuman sex symbol destined to be a central fixture of the school year.<br />
<br />
And the freakiest thing of all: she was really, really starting to <i>like</i> being transformed. That was surely a sign of insanity.</p>
