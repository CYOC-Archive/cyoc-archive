<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Who&#39;s my doggy?&quot; Kyle asked.Chad ran over to his master, and buried his snout in his master&#39;s crotch, as Kyle knelt and rubbed his new dog&#39;s fur.&quot;There&#39;s a good, boy. You know who your master is and you love me, don&#39;t you?&quot;&quot;Woof! Woof!&quot; he barked in assent. Chad wagged his tail. Kyle was his master. Kyle grinned and looked at the dog that stood before him he was always found of golden retrivers and he figured chad whould fit the bill and he defenlity did he scratched behind his ears and patted his head and pulled up a ball from behind him and lead chad to the yard where they tossed the ball around for a couple hours.&quot;Yes, sirree, Chad, you make one fine dog, but unfortunately, Chad, people will go looking for you. You&#39;ll only be able to me dog part time for now. After graduation, maybe it can be permanent?&quot; Kyle said with sigh.Kyle packed up Chad&#39;s discarded clothing, and snapped a collar and leash around Chad&#39;s neck. Then he took his new dog for a walk home. At his house, Kyle played with Chad in the backyard for a couple hours. Then he put dog food in Chad&#39;s new metal bowl, and filled a water bowl for him too. While Chad ate, Kyle ate too. Then the adjourned to the Television room, and watched the basketball game. Chad lay his head in kyle&#39;s lap. He was content.About 10 PM, Karl heard Chad&#39;s phone buzzing in his duffel bag. He pulled out the phone. He read a half dozen text messages from Chad&#39;s parents. Kyle sighed, and texted that Chad was spending the night at his friend&#39;s. That night, Kyle&#39;s dog slept by his feet at the foot of his bed.In the morning, Kyle took Chad on a walk, then he showered with his dog obediently waiting outside the shower watching him. He dressed, and checked Chad&#39;s phone. He saw Chad was expected for dinner at 5 PM. Kyle texted to ask if it would be okay of Chad brought his friend Karl to dinner. Then he waited while Chad paced around him. About 10 minutes passed, before he got his reply. Karl smiled. Chad and Karl had a wonderful day. About 4 PM, Karl called Chad over to him. Karl clicked on his iPad, and the dog&#39;s body began to shift. The naked blond quarterback was now on all fours wearing his dog collar with his tongue hanging out.&quot;Woof!&quot; said Chad. &quot;Haha, good boy, you&#39;ll always be mine, but I gotta make you pass for human again.&quot;Kyle grinned as he played with his naked jock dog boy Chad. He should have done this ages ago. He rolled around with his naked Chad. Finally, Kyle&#39;s watch buzzed. He stopped playing with Chad, and put him a headlock. He scratched Chad&#39;s head and behind his ear.&quot;Okay, Chad boy, that&#39;s enough dog time. You gotta spend the next couple hours walking on two legs.&quot; Chad looked confused as Kyle helped him up on his hind legs. Kyle hooked his finger under Chad&#39;s dog collar, and led him back into the house. Chad stumbled a bit, as he re-learned how to walk on two legs. Kyle struggled to get Chad&#39;s jeans buckled. He then tried to put Chad&#39;s tee shirt over his head while Chad chewed on his own sneaker. At last Kyle gave up, and grabbed his tablet. He made a few slight adjustments, Chad frowned at the sneaker in his mouth. He pulled the shoe out of his mouth, and pulled his t-shirt over his head. He looked at the shoe, and over at Master Kyle. Then Chad put the shoe on his barefoot. Chad sniffed. He still had the sense of smell of dog. He still had monochrome vision. He remembered enough humanity that he was able to dress himself. He knew how to speak, and walk, but he still belonged body and soul to his master. He loved his owner Kyle. He remembered enough that he knew he shouldn&#39;t, but as he sniffed the air, the fireworks of orangish pink told him he belonged to Kyle. He wanted to give himself totally to Kyle. Kyle grinned and dressed himself. &quot;Okay, Chaddy, ready to introduce me to your folks?&quot; &quot;Woo- uh- yes, mas-tuh,&quot; Chad answered. &quot;Bad dog, you can&#39;t call me master in front of your parents,&quot; Kyle ordered. &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Chad said apologetically. Kyle rolled his eyes, &quot;Oh, Chad? What am I going to do with?&quot; &quot;Fuck my ass really hard?&quot; Chad asked hopefully.<br />
Kyle laughed. &quot;Probably, but you cannot talk like that around your family,&quot; he sighed, and played with his tablet a bit more.<br />
Chad blinked, and frowned, &quot;Oh, alright, Kyle, I&#39;ll behave, but you have to promise to make me your doggy, as soon as we are alone.&quot;<br />
Kyle grinned, and tousled Chad&#39;s head. &quot;Good boy, you can count on it.&quot; Sitting in Kyle&#39;s convertible, Chad stood up to feel the air blowing against his face and chest. Kyle pulled down on the leash.&quot;Sit boy,&quot; Kyle ordered, as he pulled over, and buckled Chad in his seatbelt, &quot;Stay.&quot;<br />
Chad growled softly. Kyle grinned. When he pulled up in front of Chad&#39;s parents&#39; home. Chad squirmed around in his seat, but he had to stay. His master ordered him to stay. Kyle was halfway up the walk, when he realized Chad&#39;s problem. He snickered. He turned around, and trotted back to the car. He reached in the car, and unbuckled Chad&#39;s belt. His hand brushed Chad&#39;s tented crotch as he unbuckled the belt. He frowned, and took out his tablet again. He watched as Chad&#39;s boner shrank away. Oh, Chad was still hard, but at its current size, his dick would be more appropriate on an infant than on any man. Still he&#39;d be hard, even if only Kyle and Chad knew. Kyle was glad he wore a jockstrap. He was getting hard just thinking about Chad&#39;s baby cock - not that he&#39;d ever be using it again. Kyle chuckled, then he tugged on the leash, and told Chad to, &quot;Come, boy.&quot; Kyle led Chad up his own front steps, and looked at his puppy slave, and sighed. Chad&#39;s tongue was hanging out again. Kyle tucked the leash under Chad&#39;s shirt, and pulled the leash down below Chad&#39;s waist. He then took the bit of leash hanging down, and shoved it down the front of Chad&#39;s jeans, and twisted it around Chad&#39;s man-size nuts. Kyle giggled. He tapped his tablet a couple more times, and Chad blinked. His right hand formed a fist, but then he relaxed the fist. He sighed. Kyle rang the doorbell.<br />
A minute later, Chad&#39;s mother opened the door. &quot;Hey, Chad, and you must be Kyle. Come in, come in.&quot; She ushered them into the basement family room. Chad&#39;s father and older and younger brothers were watching ESPN. Introductions were made, and then Chad&#39;s mother said that dinner would be ready in 5 minutes and that everyone should wash up. Kyle let Chad&#39;s father and brothers go first. Then he and Chad stepped up to the sink. Chad closed the door, and immediately began licking both their hands. &#39;Wai-wai-what?&quot; Kyle asked. Then he realized he had typed that Chad would resume doggy mode when they were alone. &quot;Down boy, Chad.&quot; Kyle typed on the tablet, and Chad stopped licking and wiped his mouth with the back of his wrist. &quot;Thanks, Kyle.&quot; &quot;That doesn&#39;t sound too thankful, Chad?&quot; Kyle commented.<br />
&quot;Sorry, Kyle.&quot; This time Chad sounded penitent. Kyle smiled. &quot;That&#39;s better. Now wash up with soap and water, this time.&quot; He made sure that Chad would use silverware when they ate. Soon they were seated at the dining room table. Kyle had a good time chatting with Chad and his family like old friends. Soon they&#39;d be up in Chad&#39;s room, and Chad would be his doggy boy again. After dinner, Chad&#39;s father insisted that they adjourn to the family room. It wasn&#39;t too bad, fortunately the basketball game didn&#39;t run into overtime. Kyle spent the last 10 minutes of the game typing Chad&#39;s new programming. It would take effect 5 minutes after they were alone in Chad&#39;s room.<br />
&quot;Sure you don&#39;t want to stay for the after game show?&quot; younger brother Tad asked. &quot;Or maybe pump some iron?&quot; suggested Brad, the older brother, as he straddled a weight bench in a corner. &quot;We have to study,&quot; lied Kyle. &quot;You could stand a little more muscle,&quot; said Brad, &quot;Make Chad train you in exchange for your tutoring him.&quot; &quot;Chad, how do you feel?&quot; Kyle asked. &quot;About the same,&quot; Chad said uncertainly.<br />
&quot;Yeah, you still have a few minutes of humanity remaining. How about you show me around your room before you become my fuck toy again.&quot; Chad swallowed with a loud gulp. He proceeded to give a quick tour of his room starting with his trophies, photos, and &quot;captured&quot; wrestling singlets.</p>
