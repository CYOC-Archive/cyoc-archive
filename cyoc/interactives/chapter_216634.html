<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jules was practically drooling over the sexy redheaded woman that was bent over in front of him, her massive cleavage almost beckoning him to bury his face in it&#39;s soft embrace. And then she touched him, pressing his slack jaw closed with her fingers and her smooth flesh sent an electric shock through his body as both rows of teeth softly clicked against each other. And then she smiled again, her large lips splitting to reveal perfect teeth.<br />
<br />
Jules felt his member poking painfully against the restricting fabric of his boxers and jeans, and he swallowed with an audible gulp. He began to reach out towards her, to pull her in tight... But then the smile on her face vanished and she suddenly pulled away, clumsily stumbling over herself until she collided with the cheap sliding doors that hid Jules&#39;s closet from view. She looked at Jules as if seeing him for the first time, her sculpted brow furrowing in confusion before she looked down at herself, her tiny hands shooting up to cradle the massive breasts that now hung off her form. It didn&#39;t take more than a second for her face to turn from confusion to fear and rage as she screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT THE FUCK WHAT THE FUCK&quot; She screeched, her hands releasing her breasts and pulling at the skimpy clothes that barely covered her new form. She backed further into the closet door, pressing her full weight against it and the cheap plastic and metal snapped, causing her to let out another screech of fear as she tumbled backwards into the closet. A red-tipped hand grabbed the single rod that held up Jules&#39;s rather meager wardrobe, but instead of saving her it simply snapped from the wall and collapsed upon her, burying her in an assortment of t-shirts and jeans.<br />
<br />
There was a moment of silence as both Jules and the woman were too stunned to speak, but then the redhead was clawing her ways out of the pile of clothes, fighting against her own sensual bulk and the forest of hangers and fabric. Jules cautiously held out a hand and without hesitation the woman took it and pulled herself upwards with a feminine grunt and a surprisingly strong tug, pulling herself to her feet and Jules directly into her, his face finally colliding with her massive tits.<br />
<br />
There was another moment of silence as Jules&#39;s mind definitely came to the conclusion that this was the best feeling ever, and then the feeling was replaced with pain as the woman pushed him away and socked him straight in the gut with a tiny but furious fist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get the FUCK off me, J!&quot; She growled. It was clearly meant to be intimidating but her husky voice made it sound almost sexual, not that the dark haired boy cared too much, the punch to the stomach knocking the air out of his lungs and causing him to collapse backwards onto his bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why the FUCK am I a chick!? Why the FUCK am I in your house!? Where the hell are the other guys!? Are they chicks too!? WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED!?&quot; She barked as Jules gasped for air, writhing on the bedspread and curling his sheets into a ball, the forgotten Ahn&#39;Ger Stone finding itself becoming entombed in the cheap fabric.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guh!&quot; Was all Jules could manage, but that didn&#39;t satisfy the redhead as she grabbed him by the cuff of his shirt and hauled him upright as he wheezed, air re-entering his lungs.<br />
<br />
&quot;You better have a answer for me, shitnugget, or I&#39;ll kick your fucking ass like I should have done this morning!&quot; She hissed, spinning him around in the small space and glaring up at him with a pair of emerald green eyes as her gorgeous face, twisted in anger and rage though it may have been, filled Jules&#39;s vision.<br />
<br />
&quot;This morning? Wait, OH SHIT, ROB!?&quot; Jules swore as realization hit him like another fist to the gut. He tried to step backwards but there was simply no room, no way to escape from the angry beauty that was glaring at him in a VERY familiar way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who the hell else would it be, shithead?&quot; Rob said, palming Jules in the face and smushing his features, making his still semi-hard cock tingle at the touch of how good Rob&#39;s new skin felt. The changed bully himself scooted, as best that he could without bumping his enormous rack against the other teen, towards the bedroom door where there was a little more room. Finally free of the tight confines, Rob looked down at himself again, staring into the cleavage he now possessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit&quot; He whispered, pushing the long strands of silky red hair that fell in front of his vision and pooled on the soft tissue that stuck out from his body like a pair of mountains. He stared at how tiny his hand was, how slender his tattooed arms were, the lack of bulging muscle, the lack of scars or forests of hair. The red nail nails that tipped fingers that looked as skinny as toothpicks. Rob used those small hands to cup his breasts, feeling the heavy weight of their fatty mass lessen for a moment as they filled and spilled over hands that could once palm basketballs with little effort.<br />
<br />
There was a tingle in his new nipples that shot through his body and ended in the void between his legs, a sudden feeling of excitement, a brief feeling of warmth that exploded, and he let go of his new breasts immediately, watching as their personal physics jiggled with the return of gravity. This was real. This was actually happening. And the worst part was that despite the fact he was in a body that was the exact opposite of his own and should have felt completely alien...But it felt completely normal. Or rather, it didn&#39;t feel as different as it should have.<br />
<br />
&quot;I gotta see this&quot; He whispered, turning on a corked heel and rushing out the bedroom door at the door, pausing for just a moment to look at Jules over his shoulder and past the waterfall of red hair, his eyes widening as he quickly raced through the door and turned left, taking a handful of minced steps until he was in the trailer&#39;s single bathroom. He fumbled for the light-switch, banging his nails painfully against the wall and hard plastic before they found purchase on the switch, flipping it up and the tiny room, not much larger than Jules&#39;s own, was lit in a faded yellow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohmygod&quot; Rob gasped as he saw his reflection in the mirror. It was no wonder Jules had been looking at him like that when he&#39;d finally come too after...whatever had happened. He was in the body of a walking wet dream. His mane of hair was silky smooth, and a deep lush red, redder than his original hair had ever been, and it was EVERYWHERE. It hung down to his round, small shoulders and down his back, it was on his massive boobs. The former man had only ever had buzzcuts, and he routinely beat up what he saw as &#39;faggy little punks&#39; that wore their hair long, or in those fucking awful manbuns.<br />
<br />
And his boobs. They were even more enormous than they looked from his first person perspective, pressing against the white tank top he now wore as it the fabric was just painted on. His stomach was taught and toned, just the hint of muscle and a fucking naval piercing? He touched it gently and immediately recoiled at the foreign object that was attached to his new body. His arms were decked out in full sleeve tattoos, roses and thorns and bleeding hearts.<br />
<br />
&#39;At least it&#39;s nothing too girly&#39; He thought to himself, mourning the loss of his muscles. This new body wasn&#39;t completely just boobs and the new massive ass and hips that strained the tiny shorts he now wore, but it was little more than superficial. If it wasn&#39;t for how...punky, he looked, Rob could have easily mistaken his new body to belong to a cheerleader. He threw a look to Jules, who was now standing in the hallway staring at him, and not completely with concern.<br />
<br />
It sent a shiver through Rob&#39;s body and caused the various attractive fat to jiggle once more as he turned away, looking closer into the mirror at his new face. It lacked the scars, the stubble, his cheekbones were high, his nose looked smaller, and his wide eyes glittered green at he stared at himself. He reached up and felt his new face, running a ringer along the plump red lips that had replaced his near permanent snarled ones.<br />
<br />
&quot;You...you sorta look like that chick from the giant shark movie&quot; Jules said with some hesitation. Rob turned to look at his lackey again, confusion on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Asian chick? Think you need to have your eyes checked, fucko&quot; He snorted, though it came out as more of a huff as he turned back to his reflection, cautiously running his hands over his curves as he turned slowly in front of the tiny mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not her, the white chick that had the short hair! I think she plays Batwoman? Shit what was her name?&quot; Jules said, stumped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t she supposed to be a dyke?&quot; Fuck, that&#39;s the last fucking thing I need right now&quot; Rob groaned, and immediately regretted how sexy it sounded in his new voice. Fuck, why did everything he do turn out sexy!?<br />
<br />
Jules was about to respond when he heard the front door to the trailer slam.<br />
<br />
&quot;Im home. Picked up a shandwich&quot; A gruff, slurred voice called out. Jules&#39;s eyes went wide. &quot;Oh shit, dad&#39;s home! Uh, just, uh maybe hide or something?&quot; He hissed to Rob as he started down the hallway, not noticing Rob&#39;s new body suddenly go stiff and those angry green eyes cloud over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, dad!&quot; Jules called out to his dad, who was stumbling into the small kitchen area, setting a McFly&#39;s takeout bag on the counter as he pulled open the fridge door and pulled out a six pack of Brier&#39;s, the local cheap beer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Mr. Harper!&quot; Came a voice from behind him, and Jules turned to see Rob standing there, grinning like a moron with his new teeth, a tiny hand raised timidly behind Jules&#39;s shoulder. Wait, why did his eyes look so weird?<br />
<br />
&quot;Heeeey Bobbi! You should have told me sche was gonna be here, boy. Would have got her a burger too&quot; Frank Harper said as he looked towards his son and his girlfriend, feeling a pang of envy that somehow, his son had managed to hook up with one of the most attractive girls in town.<br />
<br />
Jules just blinked in confusion. Why was Rob acting like that? What was going on!?</p>
