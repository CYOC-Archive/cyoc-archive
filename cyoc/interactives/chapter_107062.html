<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Frances Twist was busy with the Stovall’s during their group therapy session. Despite that it started early morning; the session has dragged on to just after lunch. Julie’s letter to her parents, despite it being lost on her infected computer; was an eye opener at least with what Julie was able to recall.<br />
<br />
Months ago when Melissa accused Martin of looking at porn sites after reviewing their credit card statements; there was a heated row between the two. Despite vehemently denying the allegations, Melissa was certain that Martin was viewing porn. Julie admitting to using her father’s credit card to access the sites in question gave Melissa this sour look on her face. She knew she owed Martin an apology regarding the issue. Martin feeling some form of vindication was still not happy over the affair and wanted more information.<br />
<br />
“What else did you use my card for Julie,” Martin demanding.<br />
“Nothing else,” Julie lying; with the same porn sites she visited, she purchased her special toy that is currently being hidden under her bed. With the help of a former friend, she managed to get it delivered to her so that her parents wouldn’t know. The same toy she used last night to get off. The item in question is a large vibrating dildo, green in color. The head looking like that of horse’s cock as it flares during ejaculation, the shaft with soft rubbery bumps that stimulate a woman’s folds as they pull out and a bulge at the base to simulate being knotted by a werewolf. Julie did not want to give up her toy; especially since she is under house arrest and not likely to lure a guy to her home just for his cock in her.<br />
“Are you certain,” Martin pushing further.<br />
“Yes,” Julie sticking with here lie; “Besides, it’s not as if I did anything worse then you dad.”<br />
Martin just stares at Julie; he is about to say something when Frances chooses to interrupt.<br />
“Perhaps we should take a short break for lunch,” Frances speaks up; “give everyone to collect their thoughts and calm down before saying something rash.”<br />
<br />
Everyone except for Frances gets up; Frances grabs her phone and sends a text to Samantha; ‘Session is running longer than planned. We might have to postpone our visit to the animal shelter tomorrow.’ Frances hits send and then gets up to see Martin and Melissa eating a sandwich; Julie nowhere in sight until she comes out of the bathroom next to her father’s home office. Julie joins her parents but grabs a can of soda instead of a sandwich.<br />
“You’re not hungry Julie,” Melissa asks.<br />
“I’ll eat a little later,” Julie answers; “Can I head upstairs now?”<br />
“Why,” Melissa asks.<br />
“I’m not sure that I should hear what dad has to say to you, mom;” Julie answers.<br />
“Sensible,” Martin answers still upset over what Julie said earlier during her letter to them;” But perhaps you should wait outside in the backyard patio.”<br />
“But would the ankle monitor start beeping,” Julie looking concerned.<br />
“As long as you are within one hundred feet of the receiver on the kitchen counter you’ll be fine,” Martin answers.<br />
<br />
Julie not able to argue with what her dad said, gets up to head into the backyard for the first time in about a week. Heading outside she sees the fresh water pool surrounded by the high privacy fence for when she and or her family choose to take a dip in their were-mer forms. Julie curious as to how far she can go before the ankle monitor starts to beep starts walking towards the back fence.  Julie is able to head to the door to the cabana at the back before her bracelet starts beeping. With both of Julie’s parents rushing to the back door to see their daughter still in the back yard, Julie just comments; “At least we all now know how far I can go before all hell breaks loose.”<br />
<br />
Martin and Melissa head back to Frances as Julie heads back to the patio chairs. Sitting down Julie tries another experiment. Removing her clothes so she is naked; Julie walks towards the pool and enter into the water. This causes Julie to instantly shift into her stage one transformation; webbing along her toes and fingers. Walking until she is waist deep in the pool, Julie leans forward and starts to swim towards the deeper end. Diving down to the bottom of the pool, she shoots up and breaks the water’s surface with a joyous leap. Crashing back down into the water in her Stage two form; webbing between her fingers and golden orange fish scales running from her waist downward as her feet reformed into flippers. Sinking back down to the bottom of the pool Julie smiles; noticing that ankle bracelet is still attached and not beeping. She now knows that at least as long as she doesn’t go into her stage three form her ankle monitor will still be attached to her.<br />
<br />
With this latest bit of news, Julie takes one of her webbed hands and uses a finger to gently caress her folds. Running her finger around the outer lips of her sex; she brushes her clitoris in a circular motion. Being underwater and able to breathe with her gills, Julie moans in pleasure as she fiddles with herself. While underwater Julie is not concerned if she is noisy; no one can hear her unless they stick their head in. Julie using her other hand starts tugging and teasing her nipples from her pert breasts, as she starts to move on from her clitoris and plunges two fingers in her warm moist tunnel. With her furious thrusting into her own twat, Julie winces as she feels her vaginal muscles clamp down and her body shudders. Julie lets loose a loud and long sigh of pleasure as her orgasm hits her like a freight train.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Martin and Melissa are back in the living room talking to Frances Twist. After hearing the receiver of Julie’s ankle monitor beep; both parents rush to the door only to see Julie staring back at them from the cabana door at the very back end of the yard. With both Martin and Melissa relieved that Julie didn’t run off, they return to Frances and Martin begins reading his letter to Melissa.<br />
<br />
The letter in question details many of his acts of infidelity towards Melissa throughout the years. While Melissa was not thrilled at her husbands’ admissions; she was at least relieved that not a single woman he was with since they were married, were non-weres. The part where Melissa walked in on several acts that were about to happen but didn’t; Martin explains that the women in question were not happy to see another female arriving and thought he wanted a three way.<br />
<br />
“Is that supposed to be funny,” Melissa clearly not amused.<br />
“It was not my intention to make it funny,” Martin answering back; “This was the assignment the Frances asked me to do last Wednesday. I told you about it and you knew it wasn’t going to be pleasant.”<br />
“Is there more,” Melissa asks.<br />
“No that is pretty much it,” Martin answers.<br />
<br />
Melissa doesn’t say anything; while she knew Martin did have a wandering eye; for him to admit what he just said made her want to gouge his eyes out right then and there. But with Frances present she decided to resist the urge. Both she and Martin did want to repair their marriage for the sake of Julie and their soon to be son or daughter growing inside of Melissa. Melissa Stovall found out she was pregnant last Wednesday; while everyone in the room as well as Julie knew, Melissa still has yet to contact her mother to give her the news.<br />
<br />
“I know this is a tense situation,” Frances speaking up; “But Martin did make a huge step here. And in order to begin healing, one must be willing to address the wounds that have caused the pain to begin with.” Frances looking at Melissa; “Now I know martin has done wrong, but he does want to make amends; atone for his mistakes. He cannot do that, if you don’t give him the chance.”<br />
<br />
Melissa is silent for a moment; she gets up and looks at her husband Martin as he also stands. They both embrace each other in a hug, tears coming down from each other’s face. France’s nodding in approval.<br />
“I think now it is best that we have sessions in a more private setting. In my office,” Frances getting up, “In regards for Julie, while I’m sure she has more to reveal, I’m afraid that will have to wait. At least until after she sees the Judge to enter her plea.”<br />
<br />
Both Stovall’s look at Frances in confusion but she continues; “This is for her sake and any defense strategy her lawyer will wish to deploy. Anything she might say to me could be revealed by a court order while on the stand and that could also include these marriage counselling sessions.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
An hour later after Frances left, both Martin and Melissa are in the kitchen sipping tea in silence. With Julie’s admission to what Melissa though Martin was responsible for and Martin admitting to his various acts of cheating; the tension in the kitchen was as thick as pea soup fog. Martin was the first to break the silence.<br />
“Are we going to be okay?”<br />
“Not right away,” Melissa answers finishing her tea;” Frances was right though. In order for use to heal, we need to address the wounds that have divided us.”<br />
“Speaking of one wound,” Martin getting up to collect Julie in the back yard. Melissa gets up to stop him.<br />
“I’ll check on Julie,” Melissa stating; “You finish your tea.”<br />
<br />
Melissa heads out to the back yard. Not seeing Julie present but her clothes piled on one of the patio chairs; she heads to the pool to see her daughter in her stage two transformation floating aimlessly at the deep end of the pool. Deciding not to disturb her, Melissa heads back inside. She gets a towel from a linen closet and heads back outside and places it on a patio chair and heads back inside.<br />
<br />
Martin seeing what his wife done is merely silence by Melissa.<br />
“Let’s leave Julie be for the time being,” Melissa states.<br />
“But,” Martin manages to blurt before being cut off again.”<br />
“Our daughter is already under house arrest for what she did at school;” Melissa states; “Do you intend to chain her to her bed, just to punish her further after what she said today during our therapy session?”<br />
“She still needs to face the consequences of using my credit card,” Martin grumbles.<br />
“And how do you intend to do that Martin,” Melissa raising her voice; “Julie can’t be within in one hundred feet of this receiver you plugged in by the microwave. She can’t leave the house until she sees the judge this upcoming Wednesday.  She is suspended from school; you already took away her phone by destroying the sim card. She can’t watch television and shortly after getting her internet privileges back, her computer is hit with a worm. A worm I suspect came from someone here in Moon Lake; Someone who knows she is a were-mer. And let’s not forget she could be facing serious jail time if Jack Johnson manages to convince the judge that Julie should be tried as an adult.”<br />
<br />
“Fine,” Martin sighs; “I’ll let it go. Where is Julie by the way?”<br />
“Lounging naked in the pool,” Melissa pouring herself another cup to tea; “She is in her stage two form.”<br />
“That explains you placing a towel outside,” Martin answers; “Is this why you didn’t want me to go get her? You’re afraid I might do something I might regret?”<br />
“Partly,” Melissa sipping her second cup of tea; “But mostly I want you to calm down and look at things from a different perspective before talking to her.”<br />
“And what perspective might that be,” Martin asking.<br />
“That she is under enough stress from assaulting Eric and Frieda at school. We don’t need to add to it;” Melissa continues, “Instead we should support and comfort her. Not lash out and punish her for mistakes she made and or admitted to making in the past.”</p>
