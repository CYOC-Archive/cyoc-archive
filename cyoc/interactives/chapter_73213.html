<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The first thing that Tabitha wanted was to make a new batch of the pink stuff. Using the notes and Rick's supplies the snake and human had whipped up a new batch of the miraculous transformation chemical.<br />
<br />
&quot;There.&quot; Tabitha said as she sat down a large 4L jug. She saw the snake's excitement over the volume of fluid and smiled. &quot;It's not all for you, silly girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vipress drew her reptilian gaze from the jug to the woman and the corners of her mouth pulled into an amused grin. &quot;I can dream, can't I?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tabitha chuckled. &quot;You're plenty big already...&quot; She patted her crotch gently and grinned. &quot;Trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again Vipress blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Tabitha continued, grabbing the worn silver key form the drawer at the work station. &quot;So what we need is another of Rick's test subjects. We'll run a few experiments at first to see if it works the same for other animals, or, if you were just a lucky fluke.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you plan to ussssse?&quot; Vipress essed, curiously watching Tabitha from her vantage point on the work surface.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd like a mammal, if possible. Your reptilian physiology is a little less complex, you hold old genes inside of you, but by no means inferior.&quot; Tabitha started to walk towards the locked holding pen, passing Vipress and winking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... Tabitha?&quot; Vipress raised her powerful neck in alarm, watching her body in rapt attention.<br />
<br />
A click, the padlock opened. &quot;What's up, snakey?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I'm starting to shrink!&quot; Vipress blinked several times, watching herself reduce in scale at a rapid pace.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oop! Oop!&quot; Tabitha skidded quickly on one foot and raced to the aid of the fast dwindling snake. By the time she reached Vipress the reptile had already reduced to half her size and was considerably less muscled, her body having thinned dramatically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hurry, love! Hurry!&quot; Vipress groaned, the process of shrinking painful for her, her eyes closed and wincing. &quot;Too much farther and I'll...&quot; She paused, biting her own tongue. &quot;I'll... reverse all the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tabitha had already prepared a steel syringe in a flash and explained as she pressed the needle into one of Vipress's deflating coils. &quot;You need to think of yourself like an elastic band that's stretched out. The chemical keeps you stretched, and when it wears off your genes are trying to snap you back to your original self.&quot; She depressed the plunger and watched a healthy dose of the pink chemical flow into the snake's body.<br />
<br />
Vipress was already starting to devolve, crying out and writhing at two feet long as her mind began to slip. &quot;Tabitha! Not... w-working...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It will. Just hang on.&quot; The human picked up the shrinking snake and held her close, stroking her length and back. &quot;Just stay calm, Vipress. Keep your mind sharp, try not to focus on the pain. You'll start stretching back in a couple of seconds.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Losing... mind!&quot; Vipress cried, grunting, hissing, shrinking ever smaller. &quot;Me... calm. Me stay calm.&quot; Her yellow eyes opened in fear and stared at Tabitha pleading as her speech began to dissolve. The rest was hissing as Vipress stared up at the giant woman cradling her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just breathe.&quot; Tabitha consoled. &quot;Keep breathing. Keep looking at me.&quot; She noted the shrinking was beggining to slow down.<br />
<br />
Vipress felt it too and did as her creator instructed, taking in steady breaths and exhaling as she felt her mind pushed to the verge of a fog like state, halfway in and out of intelligence. She tried to say she was okay, but it only came out as a low hiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;There. I know. It's stopping.&quot; Tabitha reassured her gently. &quot;Time to get big again, don't worry. Big and smart.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vipress closed her eyes as she felt the pulsing. The wonderful pulsing. Almost instantly her mind rocketed back to her, the pain fading. Again, she smiled warmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;There... little snakey girl is okay.&quot; Tabitha watched in amazement, seeing the growth starting. The tiny Vipress began to re-enlarge in spurts. Every few seconds her flesh would pulse and swell, building up little by little. Soon enough Tabitha was able to hold the growing reptile in both hands, her body back to having heft and girth as she lengthened, strengthened, and grew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feelsssss great...&quot; Vipress whispered, feeling her heart beat speeding up, her arousal growing with the size of her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let me make it better.&quot; Tabitha whispered back, placing Vipress over her shoulder and rubbing the reptile's flesh with a soft feminine hand.<br />
<br />
As over sensitive as she was, the snake melted against the warm human and placed her muzzle on the woman's shoulder, letting her length go limp. Soon enough, the tip of her tail reached the floor as she became as thick as Tabitha's arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Theeeeereeee.&quot; Tabitha grinned. &quot;Just relax. Enjoy your growth, sweetie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yesssss....&quot; Vipress hissed gently. &quot;Thissss feelssss... different. Good.&quot; She relaxed more, feeling her body and tail pooling beneath her in slacked length as she reached her former impressive size. Being held by the soft human woman was wonderful and comforting. Quite unlike her stressful but no less exciting process before.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're getting horny again, aren't you?&quot; Tabitha asked gently. &quot;It feels so nice to get big and strong, doesn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vipress blushed again as she felt herself slowing. A little under what she had been during the exploits with Tabitha, she stopped entirely. &quot;Ahhh... yesssss. Big... sssstrong. Ssssooo very powerful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot; Tabitha hefted the snake's length around herself, wrapping Vipress and her willing coils around her torso. &quot;So. Let's go sit for a minute before we get back to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Assss you wissssh, dear.&quot; Vipress said submissively, lost in pleasure. Excitement. Warm feelings.<br />
<br />
Once they were seated again on the couch Tabitha looked into the snake's eyes and kissed her gently. The reptile returned the affection, surprised but eager, and soon the two creatures were locked in a simmering make-out session. Tabitha caressed the long and muscular snake woman, sure to massage and tickle her body, while Vipress rubbed her leathery flesh over the woman's breasts and groin in the most seductive way.<br />
<br />
Soon enough they had gone further, and they now laid together on the couch, still in a heated moment. Tabitha had ventured her hand lower on the snake's coils, finding the warmth of her slit as her son had earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you doing thisssss?&quot; Vipress asked gently in between kisses, half-panting, even as the human's hand covered her snakey groin.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is amazing.&quot; Tabitha whispered back gently. &quot;I did it, I've made an intelligent animal. You're a thing of beauty, with your natural instincts and the mind of an intelligent being.&quot; She gulped. &quot;And holding you in my own hands as you shrank and then watching you spring back to this size...&quot; Her fingers began to part the snake's lips, and Vipress shuddered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yesssss?&quot; The viper essed, shivering.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel like you're mine. Like a child. But... more. It's weird.&quot; The human's fingers plunged forth, touching the soft wet loins of the viper's sex.<br />
<br />
The snake melted, resting her long snout on Tabitha's cheek, her breathing heavy. The woman's touch was so delicate, so careful, quite unlike the clumsy roughness of her previous encounter. Tabitha's touch was smooth and caring, feminine, purposeful. In no time the woman had found the sweet spots, her thumb rubbing the grown snake's clit while her fingers slipped into a reptilian vagina. Vipress grew even wetter, feeling her orgasm starting to build... and Tabitha knew how to build it. Some fifteen maybe twenty minutes passed by as Tabitha dutifully pleasured her snake, slowly bringing the reptile to the point of climax before letting her edge down. Teasing her and building her up to greater and greater heights of arousal, until the viper was practically begging for release.<br />
<br />
At last, sure that the snake would receive the full effect, Tabitha sped up her fingering, stroking and playing with the reptile's most intimate parts in a way that only a woman would know how with such skill. Vipress felt it coming, tensed, and let out a cry of ecstasy, violently raising her head up on a graceful arcing neck and squeezing her woman tight as orgasm began to rush through her senses.<br />
<br />
Vipress came, flailing wildly and bucking against Tabitha's hand, the pleasure aching through her great leathery body like a blast of flame. She came for another ten minutes as Tabitha worked her into multiple orgasms, the woman's free hand finding her own pussy and masturbating as the snake writhed and hissed around her.<br />
<br />
The pleasure reached a staggering new height as Tabitha succeeded in giving the snake several rapid fire bursts, propelling the reptile into quick successions of orgasm, blasts of pleasure that was whiting out her senses. She could feel nothing else but orgasm. Nothing else, barely noticing as Tabitha cried out from her own orgasm.<br />
<br />
They held as tight as they could to each other, Tabitha's hand at last growing stiff and sore as it slowly extracted from the snake's loins... with one last good teasing of her clit on the way out. Both soaked in a combination of sexual fluids and the human's sweat, the strange couple of woman and snake relented, exhausted. Vipress loosened her coils and panted desperately, still just a little encouragement away from another round of multiple orgasm. So tender and overstimulated that Tabitha merely brushing her slit gave her another climax.<br />
<br />
&quot;G-Good.&quot; Tabitha panted, standing up and slowly removing the viper's weak coils. &quot;You're ready for your next dose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W...What?&quot; Vipress managed weakly, still panting, her body totally limp.<br />
<br />
When Tabitha returned with another syringe, this time filled all the way with the pink chemical, it became clear what she intended.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was just the warm up, Vipress.&quot; Tabitha said lustfully, plunging the needle into one of the shocked snake's belly plates. &quot;Now it's time to see how far we can take you.&quot; She depressed the needle - all of it - into the snake.<br />
<br />
In response, the Viper squirmed as her numbed body began to surge with new and intoxicating energy. &quot;Oh! Oh...!&quot; She managed, the first pulses of growth starting to kick in before Tabitha had barely removed the needle. &quot;OH!&quot; Vipress gasped, as the sound of a leathery body starting to grow and stretch made itself known.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot; Tabitha laughed. &quot;YES!&quot; She threw herself on the snake and wrapped her legs around the reptile, grabbing hold of the back of her head and shoving her warm mammalian tongue into the snake's maw. &quot;Get big for me.&quot; Tabitha breathed heavily.<br />
<br />
Already Vipress was more swollen and the mere feeling of growth began to push her orgasm out. She whimpered helplessly, a slave to her own body's pleasure, her master's new pet, and laid back to let it all happen, feeling bigger, stronger, and heavier by the second.</p>
