<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Greg took the rest of the school day time to think about how he should decide, in the end the 16-year-old decides to take his “Jeep” home and do the detailing the next day.<br />
<br />
After the last class, Greg hurries straight to the school&#39;s chop-shop to get his “car”, Greg takes out the keys, unlocks the car and gets inside. He backs out of the garage and drives onto the main road, he turns on the radio and asks, “hey Jeff. How are you feeling?”<br />
<br />
“Rough,” Jeff&#39;s voice is heard over the speakers, “I feel pretty exhausted, but I do like the new me.”<br />
<br />
Greg smiles, “I am glad you like the way you look so far,” he says.<br />
<br />
“What do you mean,” Jeff asks.<br />
<br />
“Um... well,” Greg starts, “I decided to add some lightning bolt design to your body.”<br />
<br />
“ARE YOU CRAZY,” Jeff asks, “who knows how I look already after the paint job! What if the blue paint has become my “new” skin? I would look weird enough: a blue-skinned human! If you don&#39;t watch out I&#39;ll end up in some kind of “Freak Show!”<br />
<br />
“Bro,” Greg says, “chill. No need to panic! If that should happen, we can always use the Chronivac to make your human body look normal again.”<br />
<br />
Jeff grumbles, then he sighs, “I guess,” he mumbles, “sorry, this is just to much! I still don&#39;t know why I am supposed to be your “car”. What have I done to deserve this punishment?”<br />
<br />
Greg stays silent at this, suddenly he hears a loud crash coming from a junction up ahead, “shit, that sounded bad,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Jeff replies, “I hope the people are okay.”<br />
<br />
“I guess we&#39;ll find out soon,” Greg says.<br />
<br />
When Greg arrives at the scene, his view is blocked by the cars in front of him, the traffic is moving slowly, no one seems to stop and check on the people involved in the accident, this causes Greg to shake his head, “some people,” he says.<br />
<br />
“What&#39;s up,” Jeff asks.<br />
<br />
“Oh, just these idiots who just continue driving instead of checking on the victims,” Greg replies.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Jeff says, “folks like that make me mad. How does the accident look? Is it bad?”<br />
<br />
“From what I can tell, it looks pretty bad,” Greg says, “some black BMW Limousine rear-ended a silver Skoda Superb Sportline. Both cars are totaled!”<br />
<br />
“THAT does sound bad,” Jeff says, “are you gonna check on the divers?”<br />
<br />
Greg nods, “someone has to,” he says, “I will also call the police and ambulance. I&#39;ll park close by and secure the area, I just hope the people are okay.”<br />
<br />
Greg carefully drives his “Jeep” closer to the accident, he stops his “car” in the middle of the junction, behind the black BMW and activates the “Jeep&#39;s” hazard lights. “I&#39;m going to turn off the radio,” he tells Jeff, who does not protest, Greg then exits the vehicle and walks over to both cars, already dialing 911.<br />
<br />
Greg first walks up to the black BMW, putting his phone to his ear, waiting for the dispatcher to take his call. The teen looks into the driver side window, he sees a elderly gentleman passed out on the driver&#39;s seat, his face bruised and bleeding from being hit by the airbag. Knowing he couldn&#39;t do anything at this point, Greg continues to walk to the silver Skoda Superb Sportline to check on that driver.<br />
<br />
Just as the teen approaches the window, the dispatcher answers his call, “911, what is your emergency?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, hello,” Greg says, “my name is Greg Davis. There has been a terrible accident at the junction “Seventh and Broadway”.”<br />
<br />
“”Okay,” the female dispatcher says, “please describe the scene, so that I know who to send.”<br />
<br />
“A black BMW Limousine has rare-ended a silver Skoda Superb Sportline,” Greg says, “it looks pretty bad.” As he is explaining the situation to the dispatcher, Greg peers into the window of the silver car, he lets out a gasp of shock.<br />
<br />
“What is it, young man,” the dispatcher asks.<br />
<br />
“Oh, sorry,” Greg says, “I gasped, because the driver of the silver car is one of my teachers.”<br />
<br />
“How are the occupants conditions,” the dispatcher asks.<br />
<br />
“The BMW driver is a elderly man, I guess between 60 and 70 years, he is unconscious,” Greg says, he taps a finger against the window of the silver Skoda.<br />
<br />
The teacher slowly turns his head, Greg realizes that the man seems to be dazed, he then sees his teacher&#39;s eyes widen in shock and surprise.<br />
<br />
Greg lets out a sigh of relief, “my teacher seems to be fine,” he says, “pretty beaten and shaken up, but fine.”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” the dispatcher says, “I&#39;ll send an ambulance over, especially for the elderly person. A patrol car is on it&#39;s way, please stay on scene and give a full detailed statement to an officer.”<br />
<br />
“Will do,” Greg says, “how long will it take? I&#39;d need to let my mom know.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;d assume around an hour,” the dispatcher says, “so please keep an eye on both victims, especially the on the elderly.”<br />
<br />
“Will do,” Greg says, he then ends the call and puts his phone in his pocket. Greg then carefully opens the door of his teacher&#39;s car, “sir, Mr. Huff,” he asks, “are you alright?”<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff, who is actually a really mean person, who bullies the students, especially Greg, on a regular basis, lets out a groan. “I&#39;m... fine... Twerp,” he says, sounding all but fine, his voice is quiet and sounds zoned out, despite the mean tone.<br />
<br />
“Sir,” Greg says, ignoring the “Twerp” comment, “you don&#39;t seem fine. Just tell me what is wrong and what happened.”<br />
<br />
“Mind... your own... effing... business,” Mr. Huff replies, “why... should you... care anyway?”<br />
<br />
“Because, I would hate if you were badly injured,” Greg says.<br />
<br />
“B-Bull shit,” Mr. Huff replies, “you... in my opinion... you enjoy seeing me... like this.”<br />
<br />
Greg lets out a sigh, “no, sir,” he says, “why should I?”<br />
<br />
“Because I am... an... asshole,” Mr. Huff says.<br />
<br />
“True,” Greg says, “BUT I don&#39;t care at this point! I only care about your well being, besides: you probably have your reasons why you are such an “asshole”.”<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff scowls at Greg, he then sighs, “I don&#39;t understand why you... still want to help such a person like me.”<br />
<br />
Greg smiles kindly, “because, to me, all life is precious.”<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff lets out a snort, “oh... fuck off,” he says, trying to sound pissed off, but Greg can tell Mr. Huff doesn&#39;t mean it.<br />
<br />
Greg shrugs, “sorry, you can thank my parents for raising me to be like this,” he says with a grin, “I&#39;ll be right back, I got to check on the other driver.”<br />
<br />
“Fine,” Mr. Huff says, “I hope that ass hat is in worse state than me.”<br />
<br />
Greg&#39;s smile fades, “actually, sir,” he says, “it is. He is passed out, and being an elderly, it might not be good.”<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff lets out a growl, “effing elderly! People like that should not be fucking driving.”<br />
<br />
“Please sir,” Greg says, “try and calm down.”<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff gives Greg an angry look, the boy then walks back to the black BMW, he sees that someone else is at the black car.<br />
<br />
When Greg approaches he coughs to make the other person aware of his presence, the man, who has his head in the black BMW, turns and looks at Greg. “Hello kid,” he says, “I am busy. Haven&#39;t you got somewhere else to be?”<br />
<br />
Greg rolls his eyes, “jesus, why is everyone in such a bad mood today,” he asks out loud, “well, no,” he then says, addressing the man, “I actually need to stay, because I called the ambulance and cops.”<br />
<br />
“What ever,” the man says, he then turns his attention back to the elderly gentleman.<br />
<br />
“How is he,” Greg asks.<br />
<br />
The man grumbles and mumbles something, which, to Greg, almost sounds like, “fucking kids”, or something similar, “what am I? A fucking nurse?! I have no clue!” The man, for some reason, all pissed off, slams the door of the BMW, “I&#39;m getting the fuck out of here,” he says, “I have better things to do.”<br />
<br />
Greg clenches his fists, stopping himself from saying something... stupid, and simply watches as the man storms off towards a RAM Pickup truck, he gets in and hits the gas. Greg has to jump out of the way to avoid being hit. “FUCKING TWAT,” the teen yells, picking himself up off the road, “what&#39;s wrong with people?”<br />
<br />
“GREG,” he then hears the weak voice of his teacher call.<br />
<br />
Greg walks up to the silver Skoda, “yes, sir,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff looks at the boy, “what was that about,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“Some ass hole, who, in my opinion, is worse than you,” Greg says, anger written all over his face.<br />
<br />
“Are you alright,” Mr. Huff asks.<br />
<br />
Greg sighs, “yeah, I am fine,” he says, “luckily I was able to jump out of the way in time.”<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff looks at Greg with a confused expression, his eyes then widen, “WHAT!?”<br />
<br />
Greg nods, “yeah,” he simply says, Mr. Huff is about to say something when they suddenly hear sirens coming closer, “finally,” Greg says, “took them long enough.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
After almost two hours of Greg explaining what had happened to the cops, he is told to leave. By that time, both cars had been written off as “totaled”, which does not sit right with Mr. Huff, who is at this moment sitting on the curb, just cursing to himself. The elderly gentleman has been flown to a nearby hospital, he had regained consciousness, but needed to spend a few days in the hospital.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff himself only has some whiplash other than that he is fine, the man looks up when he notices someone walking up to him, he lets out a groan when he sees Greg.<br />
<br />
“How are you feeling, sir,” the teen asks.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff rolls his eyes, “what do you think,” he barks at Greg.<br />
<br />
Greg lets out a sigh, “I know: dumb question,” he says, “look sir, at least you still are alive. It could have been much worse.”<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff looks at Greg, “pfff..., I wish I were dead. My life is fucked up as is, now my car... my BABY is gone,” tears form in the man&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
Greg sits down next to his teacher, “sir,” he says, “I don&#39;t want to say I understand what you are going through, because I don&#39;t. But I can tell that something made you who you are, something tells me you are not really such an ass, that it is just some sort of protection you put up around you, to keep people away.”<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff looks at Greg, “why do you have to be so effing smart,” he asks, “yes, being an “ass” towards people is to keep people away from me.”<br />
<br />
Greg nods, “I&#39;d ask how it came to be. What made you become this way, BUT that is none of my business,” the boy says. Mr. Huff stays silent, after a while Greg asks, “can I give you a ride home in my Jeep,” pointing towards his “car”.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff looks over at the blue Jeep, he thinks for a while, he then says with a sigh, “I have no one to call to pick me up and I really would not like to walk the last 20 miles.”<br />
<br />
Greg smiles, “then let&#39;s get you home,” he says.</p>
