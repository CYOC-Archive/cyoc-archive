<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the parking lot on the way to his car, Dave saw the company's top salesman Steve Jericho was yelling at the <br />
five young Mexican teenagers he had detailing his Ferrari. The dude was such a dog.  He was always going after  <br />
every skirt in the office including Jenny.  Dave thought for a moment about a dog chasing a cat, then he <br />
thought about all the women that Jericho had had, and wondered how he would feel if their roles were reversed. <br />
The pen seemed to call to him from his pocket.  The Mexican youths seemed intent on every word Steve Jericho <br />
uttered. They replied: &quot;Si, Senor Steve, like this?&quot; &quot;Yes, I polish harder.&quot;  &quot;This spot here? I got it, sir!&quot; <br />
&quot;Thank you for letting us detail your fine car, Mr. Steve.&quot;  Dave couldn't help but think they were like <br />
puppies.<br />
<br />
He smiled, as he loaded his trunk. Steve shouted at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Davey, aren't you going home a bit early?&quot; he snapped, as if he was Dave's boss and didn't work in <br />
another department.<br />
<br />
Dave pulled the pen and paper out of his pocket and started writing on the trunk of his car.  He looked over <br />
his shoulder, and said, &quot;Well, I don't exactly see you working either, Jericho.  Maybe instead of bitching <br />
about what others are or aren't doing, you should be a bitch. Then you'd find out what it's like to be hounded <br />
by guys they way you hound women everywhere.&quot; <br />
<br />
He emphasized the period, as Jericho let out a yelp.  He had written &quot;Steve Jericho is a dog named Jericho <br />
with a dog tag hanging from his collar that identifies me as his owner. I now live in Steve Jericho's mansion <br />
and his wife and kids are my servants, I also own all his assets including his cars with none of his <br />
liabilities. And Jericho is a female dog and those 5 Mexican guys are all horny Chihuahuas and Jericho is in <br />
heat. Oh, and Jericho is aware she used to be a rich human guy, but she's totally obedient and no matter how <br />
much she wants to bite me, she can't.&quot; He turned just as Jericho yelped.  His hand was resting on his old car, <br />
when he felt its body shifting shape under his hand.<br />
<br />
Steve Jericho was naked, and suddenly, Dave was wearing his $5000 Armani suit, except it had been retailored <br />
to fit Dave perfectly. The Mexicans stepped back in surprise as the expensive car they were polishing vanished <br />
and reappeared on the other side of the lot. They stared as Steve Jericho stood there naked for a moment. Then <br />
he dropped to all fours and let out a yelp as he morphed into a black and tan male boxer. Then as they watched <br />
his big cock and balls disappeared up inside him as he let out a yelp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ai!&quot; shouted one of the Mexicans as their clothing vanished too. They started to shrink.  They yapped as they <br />
shrank and morphed into male Chihuahuas.  The scent emanating from Jericho was driving them crazy.  They <br />
didn't seem to care or perhaps they weren't aware that they were trying to hump their former boss. <br />
<br />
Dave hadn't considered what sort of dog Steve would become, but he found the sight of the tiny Chihuahua <br />
knotted to the backside of the bitch boxer hysterical. He snapped a pick with his new iPhone.  He chuckled, <br />
another one of Jericho's assets. He climbed into the Ferrari and noticed that the car key on his key ring had <br />
changed. It fit perfectly, said to the navigator &quot;HOME&quot;.  And followed the directions to Jericho's former <br />
home.<br />
<br />
He pulled into the driveway, and wondered how Jericho's family would react to being his servants now.<br />
<br />
He was a bit surprised to discover Steve Jericho's eldest wearing a Speedo and flip flops.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Mr. Dave, sir, you ready for your swim, and massage?&quot; he asked as Dave got out of the car, and he <br />
handed Dave an ice cold mint Julep. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, uh?&quot; what was his name?  Steve junior?  <br />
<br />
&quot;Rick, sir, you must have had a long day at the office. Let me help you change,&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I guess,&quot; he was a bit distracted by the situation.  The young 20 something stud was fawning all over <br />
Dave like Dave was a hot young chick.   He guessed it was good to be rich.<br />
<br />
Dave found himself escorted to the pool house and being undressed by this young stud.  He wondered about the <br />
other servants.  Jillian Jericho might be 40 something, but she was still hot. He licked his lips, and didn't <br />
notice the bulge in Rick's Speedo.  Dave pulled his pen out of his coat hanging on the hanger in the changing <br />
room, and jotted down on a scrap of paper, &quot;When I look at someone I know their backstory of who they are now <br />
and who they were.&quot;<br />
<br />
He turned to look at Rick.</p>
