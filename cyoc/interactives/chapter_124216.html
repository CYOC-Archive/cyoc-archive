<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> Issac and Ilvir made their way out of the Basilisk&#39;s lair, abiet slowly, with Issac, despite his huge physical strength, found himself straining to move a couple inches at a time with his enormous weight. With the statues he had absorbed into himself and his recent assimilation of the Basilisk, his body probably weighted several tons.<br />
<br />
  Nevertheless with aid from Ilvir, the duo made steady progress, the constant dark thrumming of the corruption&#39;s source ever in their ears. It was so powerful and so... alurring but with their strong minds and Issac&#39;s artifact that protected their minds from the corruption&#39;s mental influence they had yet to fall to the corruption completely.<br />
<br />
        &quot;Master... I would hate to pry but... would you mind telling me about yourself?&quot; Ilvir asked with a slight hesitation.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Where&#39;s this come from all of the sudden Ilvir?&quot; Issac asked curiously, looking down at his spawn who while huge when compared to a human, was almost like a toddler to Issac.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Well I don&#39;t know myself, I suppose just curiosity, but also...&quot; Ilvir stopped, his grey granite skin somehow turning a darker shade as if blushing.<br />
<br />
  &quot;What it is?&quot; Issac asked with some concern although he had already figured out Ilvir&#39;s lusty motives by now.<br />
<br />
  &quot;I am no fool Master, I know that after you gave me this granite body after I lost my old one that I had become attuned to you in some way, I in body and mind am now a spawn of yours, for whatever purpose you see fit, I also know that my human self would be rebelling at every opportunity to get away from your grasp, but yet I also know that a part of me wanted this from the entire start... Master why do you think I willingly delved into this hellhole in the first place?&quot; Ilvir asked, dead serious.<br />
<br />
  &quot;I assume for glory and honor just like any other paladin?&quot; Issac asked unsure where this was going.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Well that was never my intention, when I first heard of the corruption and this.. place where it supposedly all began, I had thought anyone who would come here to try and purge it was an idiot, but then, when I was a young teen I had seen someone get Corrupted in front of my very eyes...&quot;<br />
<br />
  &quot;Really? What had happened?&quot; Issac asked curiosity in his voice as they continued walking deeper into the caves.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Well... I had had heard of corruption before when I was but a child, but I had never known it was so... pleasureable, I had thought the entire process simply involved getting bit or scratched and then you&#39;d slowly get corrupted soon afterwards. Then one night I was out hunting with my shortbow for small game outside of my village in the nearby forest, everything was normal at first, then I saw a beast, massive and hulking, I thought it was a bear at first but then I squinted and realized it so be a corrupted wolf, it stood on two legs and every fiber of it was pure bulging muscle... especially its cock...&quot; Ilvir said, stammering out the last part as a bit of saliva was drooling from the corners of his mouth. Issac hadnoticed that both of Ilvir&#39;s cocks were once again hardening as Ilvir was remembering what had happened to him on that day.<br />
<br />
  &quot;I saw it, it was fucking a woman, a human woman , driving its member in and out of that woman vigorously grunting as the woman tried to resist... but she couldnt manage and eventually she gave in and started thrusting back too, and I watched as she transformed into a wolf like being too as she screamed in new pleasure. I was still young then and that night when I saw them rutting like the beasts they were, it had awoken something primal in me as well, I had took of my trousers and masturbated at the sight of their act, imagining myself in both of their positions, as they seemed to fuck for hours on end, then all three of us had orgasmed, I wish I could say simultaneously but I admittedly orgasmed first.&quot; Ilvir said with a light chuckle.<br />
<br />
   &quot;What then? Didn&#39;t they notice you?&quot; Issac asked.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Oh they did, but the village clerics and priests had come, apparently feeling the presence of the werewolf nearby. The priests, a group of four or five had easily managed to overpower and kill the beasts, ensuring no trace of their corruption had remained, I had managed to sneak away back to my cottage without them noticing, but the picture of the two beasts mating as still in my mind. So after that I had learned of this place and devoted myself into becoming the best paladin I could be, not driven by honor, or justice, but driven by lust, and so I did. I became one of the greatest paladins in my former order and then set out here to find another werewolf, where I let myself get bit and Corrupted. Then later after who knows how many years of pure mindless pleasure, I met you...&quot; Ilvir explained.<br />
<br />
  &quot;I see...&quot; Issac said unsure of what to say or how to process what Ilvir had just told him.<br />
<br />
      &quot;That is what I want to know Master, why did you come here?&quot; Ilvir asked, almost pleadingly, as if he was ashamed of himself for telling what was likely to be his darkest secret.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Well Ilvir, when I came to this dungeon I...</p>
