<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After watching Kellie and the others leave, Circe and Lilith now rubbed their heads, still dazed from the the effects of the hourglass. As the two witches went to sit back on the throne they bumped into one another, the two adults were now too big to fit on the throne together.<br />
<br />
“Sorry,” Lilith said quietly as she slid over towards one of the arm rests. <br />
<br />
“No reason to apologize,” Circe said quickly, sitting down on the other arm rest. The two witches now paused, a long silence dragging on between the two of them. It was finally Lilith who spoke as she stared down at her colorful sneakers. “It amazes me that our clothing changed when the spell passed,” she said. “Still, I am not quite sure how I feel about neon pink sneakers.”<br />
<br />
Circe stifled a laugh as she gazed down at Lilith&#39;s sneakers. Thankfully for the two witches their clothing had grown with their bodies when they returned to adult hood. Unfortunately though this meant that the shoes the two witches had conjured had grown with them. Both Circe and Lilith now sported neon sneakers on their feet. Circe gazed down at her neon blue sneakers, smiling and shaking her head as she turned towards Lilith. “Be thankful they grew with us,” she smirked. “Otherwise the two of us would be standing nude and I know your not as comfortable with nudity as I am.”<br />
<br />
“Correct dear Circe,” Lilith nodded. Another silence now lingered between the two. The power of the hourglass had altered the witches more than either would have realized. While the two remembered their lives from before the hourglass was used, they also had new memories that filtered into their minds. These new memories the two shared showed that the two witches had grown up together. Their lives in these alternate memories showed that Lilith and Circe had been friends. They were close, sharing everything with one another and never argueing. This was in stark contrast to what had occurred prior to the use of the spell.<br />
<br />
“Circe,” Lilith started. “Are you having issues differentiating our original memories from the memories after the hourglass was used.”<br />
<br />
“Yes Lilith,” Circe said quietly. “It’s, so strange. I remember we cared little for one another but I also recall us growing up together. We’ve been friends since childhood, the best of friends.”<br />
<br />
“Yes Circe we are,” Lilith stated solemnly. Lilith now looked towards her friend, a warm smile etched on her face. “As odd as it is, we are friends now. Yes the memories may be false, however their is something about them that makes me happier than I’ve been in millennia. I do not wish to change that.”<br />
<br />
“So what happpens now,” Circe asked.<br />
<br />
Lilith sighed as she gazed out at the throne room the two had decorated only recently. “Unfortunately neither one of us are in any condition to challenge Merlin’s daughter,” she sighed. “I know you can sense it. The two of us view the girl differently now. She is an authority figure we do not wish to offend. While our mission remains unchanged, challenging Kellie would be far to difficult.”<br />
<br />
“But we still could if we choose,” Circe said, trying to sound bold. Lilith turned towards her friend raising an eyebrow. “Do you really think so,” she said flatly. Circe paused, lowering her head in defeat. “I doubt it,” she groaned. “But how then are we to balance light an dark? Sure we can strengthen Jack, but how do we counter Kellie?”<br />
<br />
“I am glad you asked,” Lilith smirked. Circe watched as Lilith now conjured two photos, handing them to Circe. “I am sure you recognize those two,” she said. <br />
<br />
Circe nodded as she gazed at the photos, slightly confused by what she saw. “Yes I recognize them,” she said. “But what does the other timeline have to do with anything?”<br />
<br />
“Because dear friend,” Lilith smiled. “It is not just one timeline, it is now two.”<br />
<br />
Circes eyes went wide as Lilith now explained. “It appears a third timeline has now emerged,” she said. “It appears Kellies sister was careless while making a wish. This has led to the woman becoming the child of Kellie and Jack. Her talents, while raw, are quite powerful.”<br />
<br />
“So we are to focus on this new timeline,” Circe asked.<br />
<br />
“The girl can be turned towards her darker impulses,” Lilith said. “There are others in that timeline as well that can be turned. Our actions in these other timelines can help to strengthen the darkness even if we can not make those changes in our own timeline.”<br />
<br />
“I think I understand,” Circe stated. “If we can not balance the scales in our timeline we can influence it in others. Ones where we do not have our issues dealing with the forces of light. But what of this other picture?”<br />
<br />
“Things have transpired in the other timeline that may eventually tip the scales towards darkness,” Lilith grinned maliciously. “It appears the Kitsune have finally made a move against Katie and her friends. These actions can have long reaching consequences. Katie and the others may be able to defeat Fukushu, but events are unfolding that may turn one of their allies against them.”<br />
<br />
“I see,” Circe smirked. “What better way to balance the scales than to move one of the pieces from the light to the darkness.” Lilith could only nod, if things played out as she hoped than they could still balance the scales as they focused on strengthening Jack.<br />
<br />
“So what shall we do now,” Circe asked. “If we are not to challenge Kellie directly than what are our plans?”<br />
<br />
“We continue to help Jack,” Lilith stated. “But that shall be another day. Remember Circe, we now both control your amusement park. Your followers and mine seem to be getting along rather well, why tinker with what works.”<br />
<br />
“So we entertain ourselves,” Circe grinned. “That could prove interesting.”<br />
<br />
“Yes it could,” Lilith said. “However we do have a choice, we can go as we are now or use the hourglass. Also their is Baba. She did use the hourglass on us, I do not know about you but I wouldn’t mind knocking her down a peg or two, if only for a little while.”<br />
<br />
Circe smiled as she gazed at the woman who was once her enemy and now her friend. As odd as things were the two were now a team. A team that may have a manufactured past but a team non the less. The only decision now was, what would they do with the rest of their day?</p>
