<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“It’s over, Tony!” Melody cried from across the street,<br />
“C’mon Mel, this is so stupid!” Tony shouted back,<br />
“No!” She screamed, almost waking the whole neighbourhood, “am I just not good enough for you!? Is that it!!”<br />
“Oh my god, Mel. This is ridiculous!” He shouted back, much quieter, “just come back inside, I can explain it to you. I’ve been wanting to talk about it for a while anyway,” he said calmer, stepping onto the sidewalk.<br />
“No!” She screamed again. She quickly stormed off as angrily and as fast as she could. Tony gave, knowing that she was going to return at some point. He walked back into his house and shut the door, not locking it on purpose.<br />
<br />
Melody looked back, seeing that Tony had gone back inside. She was completely pissed.<br />
Not thirty minutes ago had she just been casually browsing through her boyfriends search history and suddenly found a bunch of weird looking links. She clicked on one of them, and found herself looking at some bitch with tits as big as her head. Furious, Melody demanded that Tony told her what he was thinking! He explained to her that he was bored and she wasn’t even at his home when he watched it. She interrogated him further and he admitted that he watched porn when he wasn’t with her.<br />
Melody felt betrayed, putting it lightly. She had never in her life even considered watching porn. He was just looking at other women and jerking off to them!<br />
<br />
Melody was running over everything in her head, creating a cycle of anger and sadness as she stomped her way down the sidewalk. She found herself by a small park area. It had three benches with a sundial in the centre, there were bushes and trees scattered around the place, making for a cozy little park area.<br />
Melody angrily stomped onto the gravel and sat herself down on one of the benches. She threw her jacket onto the ground, leaving her alone with her thoughts. She curled herself into a ball, sitting her boots on the bench with her.<br />
<br />
Melody was wearing a blue and red jacket, a pair of denim jeans torn in various places, and big high heeled boots. She looked pretty heavy duty, as well as her makeup pushing her edgy style. Dark eyeshadow, thick eyeliner, all topped off with some pretty bright lips. She had piercings in her ears, her eyebrow, and even a hoop on her nose. With the jacket beside her, she was left in just a revealing red tank top.<br />
She was an attractive woman. Aged 19, she was slim, athletic, and had a pretty face. Not to mention she was somewhat curvy. Her breasts were modest, looked especially good when she wore the right bra, inspired the imagination. Her hips and thighs were perfect size. Not too big, not too small, but allowed for a cute butt. She was a perfect girlfriend in all aspects… except for her obsessive jealousy. <br />
When a girl even looked at her boyfriend, she would freak out. Not being afraid to stand her ground, she usually confronted the girl head-on. Once resulting with a chair being broken on a date. She never learnt her lesson, despite all of Tony’s explanations and reasonings. She just couldn’t accept that he wouldn’t fall for other girls, so she was very defensive.<br />
In reality, Melody loved Tony. She had since they started dating three years ago, in High-School. Melody had at one point been pretty popular, likely due to her looks and generally likeable personality (aside from when the jealousy kicks in). Tony was liked, but generally a loner with few friends. They had connected and begun dating soon after their friendship had begun. It was only in the recent year that Melody had started getting overly jealous.<br />
<br />
Melody wiped her tears. Thinking about all of this stuff, her history with Tony. She couldn’t just leave it. But what if he wanted to, and she just couldn’t see it? The waterworks started up again. That’s when she was interrupted,<br />
<br />
“What seems to be the problem, my dear?” A voice whispered into Melody’s ears. She quickly jumped up, looking behind her, expecting to see someone there... hoping it would be Tony,<br />
“W-who’s there?” She asked, shaking in part due to being scared,<br />
“I am, my dear. I am the Sundial,” the voice said to her. She could hear it much clearer now. The direction was everywhere, all at once. It was like the voice was in her head, yet it also felt like it was out loud. It was a strange sensation. She turned to face the Sundial, looking at it. She noticed in the darkness that it had a strange aura around it. Not only could she begin to see it, but she could feel it too. It felt like power, it felt like something that could solve her problems,<br />
“What... what’s going on!?” She demanded. She considered that this was a joke from Tony, but knew he wouldn’t do it during an argument, “what are you!?” She yelled,<br />
“I am the Sundial. I have sensed your distress and have appeared before you in order to help,”<br />
“Why?”<br />
“Because you were sad, my dear. I sensed you crying. I sensed the betrayal you had felt and knew that if I did not stop to help you, your life would be left in shambles. I am here for you,”<br />
“Y-you...” Melody stammered, trying to make sense of it, “what could you do to help me..?” She asked genuinely, hoping for some kind of way to keep her boyfriend completely loyal to her,<br />
“I can guarantee his eternal love, and do the same for you,”<br />
“That’s not possible,” Melody said, but still wanting to believe the Sundial, she encouraged it, “how could you even do that?”<br />
“My dear, I can only give you my word. But I will assure you, he will love you until the day that his soul turns to ash,”<br />
“Uhm...” Melody was a little worried after that last part. She had always assumed magic was real, considering the countless pieces of evidence that supported it, especially over the last 15 or so years, “what exactly would I have to do? Nothing comes for free...” she said. She almost felt the Sundial chuckle, but shook it off as nothing,<br />
“Yes of course. Nothing does come free. In order to be granted his eternal and undying love, you will be faced with change. You must endure what you fear most. You will become exactly what your boyfriend lusts for. What he desires. What he wishes you were… and you must face these changes,”<br />
“Why?” She asked, holding her ground, finding the whole ‘gimmick’ ridiculous, “what’s even the point!”<br />
“Well, my dear,” the Sundial said, condescendingly, “if you don’t, then you’ll have to face the reality that your Tony Gray will eventually lose interest in.”<br />
<br />
Melody was struck by that last part. It hit her hard enough that she almost started to cry. But she held it, keeping her confident and stern expression. And in this roller-coaster of emotion, she said,<br />
“Okay. I’ll do it,”<br />
“Excellent,” the Sundial said, the voice was louder this time, shaking her core, “you will be changed, for better or for worse. Tony Gray will be eternally loyal to you, and you alone. You must endure many changes, before eventually you earn his eternal love,”<br />
With that, the Sundial’s aura began to shine brighter. Melody couldn’t see the light hit any of the other objects in the park, it was like the glowing belonged to the Sundial exclusively,<br />
“Just one last question,” Melody said, see the aura begin to dim, “what exactly are his ‘changes’ that I have to endure?” She asked. The aura dimmed down into nothing. There no longer any light, and Melody couldn’t feel the power emanating from the Sundial, “hello?” She asked again. There was no response.<br />
<br />
Melody was once again, left alone. The area seemed to have darkened a little. She was still apprehensive about returning to Tony’s house after her anger filled explosion. She sat on the bench, contemplating her decision. A part of her wondering whether or not it even happened. Maybe it was all in her imagination. She stood up, standing over the sundial, she raised her arm to give it a light pound, but suddenly felt a few drops of rain. The rain was slow to start, but started pouring very quickly. She leant down and grabbed her jacket, putting it on quickly and making her final decision to go back to Tony’s house.<br />
<br />
As made her way quickly and the rain became more and more intense, she felt an odd warm breeze wash over her, that’s not normal...</p>
