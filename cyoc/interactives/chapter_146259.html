<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meeting Beatrice had gone fairly well, though Allura at times had some degree of nervousness with regard to issues with Beatrice&#39;s height. Allura didn&#39;t want to say anything offensive regarding Beatrice&#39;s shorter height or anything that would make it seem like Allura wasn&#39;t at least curious. Particularly as the meeting and the planned date was at least partially set up by Madam Matryoshka, partially as a &quot;get to know you&quot; sort of thing. It was designed to let the two get to know each other and learn a little more about each other. <br />
<br />
That way if Allura and Beatrice ultimately became bond-mates, it would be something that would last. So far, Animalia hadn&#39;t had the sort of issue where one side would lose interest or something like that. In this, there had been no noted cases of &quot;divorce&quot; among Animalians. But then at the same time it was noted that many of the couples that had formed romantic bonds had been together for years before their uplifting or conversion, depending on whether or not one was Human before interaction with the Animalia Virus. Other situations had often had couples in very much a &quot;friends with benefits&quot; sort of situation, in that there was no breeding and the relationship was entirely casual. If it doesn&#39;t progress beyond &quot;friends,&quot; there was no heavy investment going in. Things like Doctor Jones&#39; clinic, Homosexuals Anonymous, and Madame Matryoshka&#39;s work was simply the latest in which Animalia served to try and keep things peaceful and in a way friendly.<br />
<br />
Allura knew about this and accepted it as she waited for Beatrice in the lobby of the hotel that Beatrice had checked into. A few nervous thoughts went through her head, some of it related to what Madame Matryoshka had said to her before first meeting here and the curiosity that had risen after Beatrice had mentioned something that was still rather new to Allura. There was much about the surface world that was very new to Allura and much she eager to learn. Things like the sun were things she&#39;d never seen before her uplifting and others were things that were part of Human society that she hadn&#39;t seen much of. This only further made her nervous that she would say the wrong thing, which wasn&#39;t what she wanted to do.<br />
<br />
Eventually as Allura continued to walk back and forth, she could see Beatrice come out into the lobby area. The Human woman was dressed about the same as she was when she came off the plane, but then this first date wasn&#39;t that formal, and Beatrice&#39;s visit to Lyre/Animalia would be long enough to let them get to know each other fully. For these dates were supposed to lead into what could ultimately be for Animalians looking for bond-mates, which would ultimately be a lifetime arrangement, if things worked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you fine with your room?&quot; Allura asked to Beatrice as they came closer.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll do,&quot; Beatrice answered, &quot;the curtains could be a bit darker... but I suppose with Easter coming up, the color they have is understandable.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two began to slowly make their way out into the cool Lyre evening air. Things were warmer than they were the previous year, along with things beginning to get fairly green on the lawns around the hotel. Though the sun was still going down and reflected a dimming of world around them as night drew closer. Allura occasionally used her natural lure on nights when it was dark and shi had to go out, but for the moment that wasn&#39;t an issue.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do you have planned?&quot; Beatrice asked as they stepped out into the evening air and made their way onto one of Lyre&#39;s sidewalks.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were told you liked tea,&quot; Allura answered, &quot;Lyre has one old coffee shop that expanded after Animalia was born. They sell all sorts of drinks, coffee, tea, iced tea, ice water, along with various bits of food. It&#39;s not big, but we&#39;ve been told it&#39;s very good. We can talk more to get to know each other and you can tell us more about this black lighting…&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Black light paint?&quot; Beatrice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Allura nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can explain that as we go,&quot; Beatrice offered as they walked along, &quot;as I said earlier... it&#39;s a specialized paint. It wouldn&#39;t look like much under normal light... but under ultraviolet light, it will actually glow. Illuminating everything around it. My idea to paint you would show you in a terrific pose showing your strength... with a paint that would literally let you glow, showing your real strength in a way that traditional paints wouldn&#39;t succeed at.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting,&quot; Allura said slowly, &quot;so it glows?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Under the right light, yes,&quot; Beatrice nodded, &quot;it&#39;s not something that could glow on command the way you likely lured food before you were uplifted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would I have to pose?&quot; Allura wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the painting... well... yes... but there are ways that I save you the time for all that,&quot; Beatrice commented, &quot;Especially because all my paint is at home right now. I have my camera packed and I can get the photo that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allura nodded as they walked along. Some things were getting quieter as many places that were open for the day shifted only closed down for the night, and as some of those businesses closed, some of the decorations they had for Easter were hidden by the lights going out inside the building. But neither really payed attention to that. There was a bit of curiosity that was there that each other had, and some of the other things that went on around them fell into the background as they walked along. They eventually came up on a modest square shaped café. <br />
<br />
It broad board outer walls and rather large windows. Unlike some of the other businesses in the area, though, the café was still open and they made their way in. They were able to take their seats and were issued menus from an attentive waiter. Beatrice looked over the menu and noted that many of the menu items were fairly simple and generic menu. There were sandwiches and snacks, all things that Beatrice knew she could eat, but she didn&#39;t see too many things that were specialized to suit Animalian diets. There were some things that looked fine, but Beatrice wasn&#39;t quite sure.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure this place is okay?&quot; Beatrice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Allura nodded, &quot;the snacks they serve are fine. And we&#39;ve been told that the tea and coffee they serve have specially brewed and grown to suit Animalian tastes, so those that are carnivorous can have them without loss of health. And since we figured this was something you liked... It would make for a good impression. And where we could talk with some comfort.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Beatrice said slowly with a nod while looking over the menu, &quot;Well... that&#39;s good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We thought so,&quot; Allura nodded hir head.<br />
<br />
They paused in their discussion long enough to make their orders before turning onto the questions and curiosity that was there. After handing the menu to the waiter, Beatrice opened the discussion.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... I have to ask... do you... &quot; Beatrice began, but her voice fell off as she had trouble trying to find her words.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do we ever argue with ourselves? Do we control different parts of our body?&quot; Allura asked back, &quot;we&#39;ve heard all those sorts of questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Beatrice spoke, &quot;It&#39;s just that... well... Humans don&#39;t ever have anything like what Anglerfish have...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Technically before our uplifting, we really didn&#39;t have that either,&quot; Allura answered, &quot;the part of us that is male had essentially decomposed to a fleshy mass that the part of us that is female absorbed to use as a repository of sperm for our eggs. After our uplifting... we sort of became one in all things, mentally and physically. We understand each other perfectly. In that we are both two and one at the same time with no need to argue or have those differences of opinion. And every decision we make... we make simultaneously.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... it&#39;s not something where you always have someone to &quot;talk to&quot; as it were?&quot; Beatrice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are together... but yet alone at the same time,&quot; Allura said slowly. &quot;And at times that can be lonely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can feel the same way there...&quot; Beatrice said slowly, &quot;Not many people want to hang out with a goth... even one with a good nature, like me. But I&#39;ve managed and have kept a smile about me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;s good,&quot; Allura answered with a small smile at that, and was even more relieved when Beatrice didn&#39;t flinch at Allura&#39;s teeth, letting the two get into some small talk.</p>
