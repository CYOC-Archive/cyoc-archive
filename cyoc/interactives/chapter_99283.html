<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Beryl was actually headed out the door when she saw her - Jennifer, the girl who had cursed her brother. Beryl didn&#39;t like Jennifer.  She thought she was very mean.  Even though she was only a freshman, she acted like she owned the school.  And she had a weird obsession with her brother, Kyle.  He had rejected the advances of the strange girl, and now she was making him pay the price.  It made Beryl angry, and she wanted to make the girl suffer a little for her cruelty.  Suddenly, she got a very wicked idea.<br />
<br />
Beryl had come to school today for the cheerleader tryouts.  She knew she probably didn&#39;t have a chance.  She wasn&#39;t athletic, popular or good looking.   But it seemed like they always needed small girls - to throw into the air or sit at the top of a pyramid - so she thought she might give it a try.  She didn&#39;t really care about cheerleading, but she thought that being a cheerleader might make her more popular and socially accepted.<br />
<br />
She knew Jennifer was going to try out, too.  She had made a big deal about it, bragging about her dancing skills.  Beryl had planned on going home, and reaching her ideal height safely with Kyle&#39;s help, but now she saw an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone - she could grow taller and punish Jennifer at the same time.<br />
<br />
She followed Jennifer into the girls locker room, and started to get ready for the tryouts.  She saw with some amusement that her leotard now no longer fit.  She borrowed one from Sarah&#39;s locker.  It fit very loosely, but if all went according to plan, that wouldn&#39;t be a problem for much longer.  Just as she hoped, it didn&#39;t take long for Jennifer to come over and start harassing her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Beryl, where&#39;s your brother today? &quot; she said mockingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;He stayed home today.  I think he&#39;s sick or something, &quot; said Beryl, carefully avoiding her gaze as she finished putting on her clothes.  Jennifer was wearing a tight cheerleader uniform.  She hadn&#39;t made the team yet, but she had arrogantly assumed that she would, and had purchased a custom made uniform.   <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s sick.  I think he just stayed home because he&#39;s a freak.  A guy with a vagina - how gross! &quot; she said loudly.<br />
<br />
Beryl stood up, her new height making her almost as tall as Jennifer.  Jennifer was surprised.  She didn&#39;t remember Beryl being this tall.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, bitch.  I wouldn&#39;t talk about my brother like that if I were you.  Not unless I wanted to get my ass kicked, &quot; said Beryl, as she poked Jennifer sharply on the bare skin of her chest.  A large crowd now gathered, watching the exchange with interest.  The other girls smelled blood in the water, and knew a fight was soon to occur.<br />
<br />
Jennifer looked around, and saw that she now had an audience.  She didn&#39;t want to fight Beryl, but she had to do something.  Everyone was watching her.  Beryl saw her nervous eyes, frantically scanning the crowd, and prodded her more.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter, bitch?  Scared?  &quot; she said with a sneer.  &quot;Or maybe you&#39;re just embarrassed because my brother rejected you?  Yeah, my &#39;freaky&#39; brother would rather be alone than be stuck with a disgusting pig like you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Beryl&#39;s tirade was stopped by a hard slap from Jennifer.  Beryl smiled, as she felt herself grow and saw Jennifer shrink.  Her plan was working.  The custom made uniform now hung loosely on Jennifer&#39;s small frame, while her own borrowed clothes were now tighter.  She was eye level with Jennifer, but Jennifer was so enraged that she barely noticed.  Beryl laughed hard, trying to further provoke her.<br />
<br />
&quot;That the best you can do, pig? I barely felt that.  If you want to beat me, you&#39;re going to have to do better than that.  Here, I&#39;ll help you, little pig,&quot; said Beryl, dropping her hands to her sides.  &quot;Hit me as hard as you can, right on the face.  I promise, I won&#39;t defend myself.  I&#39;ll keep my hands right here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer needed little encouragement.  She quickly slapped her again, harder this time.  Beryl&#39;s uniform now felt a little snug, and she saw that the strap of Jennifer&#39;s top had fallen off of her shoulder, revealing part of her breast.  The other girls began to laugh.  Jennifer looked down, then quickly covered her breast with her arm.  She looked up at Beryl with malice, then her eyes went wide.  She realized she was looking up at Beryl, rather than down as she used to.  Her eyes narrowed, as she realized that Kyle must have used the curse on his sister to allow her to get taller.  And to humiliate her.  She resisted the urge to attack - it seemed like every contact with Beryl only made her steal more height.  Instead, she ran out of the locker room, vowing revenge.<br />
<br />
Beryl smiled.  This might just work out after all, she thought.  She looked at the tape measure attached beside the locker room mirror.  She was now 5&#39;9&quot; - she had gained about three inches in height from Jennifer.  <br />
<br />
This looks good, she thought.  I don&#39;t think I want to get any taller.  <br />
<br />
She was about to go home, when she heard Coach Miller calling the girls over to begin the tryouts.  <br />
<br />
Well, I&#39;m already here and dressed.  Might as well audition.  I mean, it&#39;s why I came to school today, anyway, she thought, as she headed out to join the rest of the girls.  I can just go home right after I finish.  Besides, what&#39;s the worst that could happen?</p>
