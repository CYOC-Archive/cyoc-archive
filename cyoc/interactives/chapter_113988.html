<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Daniel  was standing in his boxers trying to take a new photo for grindr profile. His laptop lay next to him, the trashy EDM song he was listening to finished and 10 seconds later the next suggested video began to play; “Goddamn faggots think they own the world now that the hippie liberal government is on their side. They’re nothing but a bunch of cocksucke-” Daniel closed the tab without even looking to see the fat man’s testicles, “Ugh why was that playing?”. After 20 minutes of attempting to choose his clothes for the night he settled on a very nice and form fitting long sleeved black shirt and some very skinny jeans which showed off his tight little ass, he tousled his blonde dye job and looked himself over smiling, he was sure to get some action tonight he giggled to himself.<br />
<br />
30 minutes later Daniel got out of a cab at the top of the city’s nightclub street, he felt the cool night air and then frowned, the cab had dropped him at the wrong end of the street, his friends would all be waiting for him down at the club, he began to hurry down the street whilst attempting to text his friends and then he collided with a brick wall “Shit, you ok?” Daniel, slightly dazed, gazed up and let out a gasp at the wall of a man he had collided with, he rushed to his feet and found himself face to chest with the colossus in front of him. “ohmygod I’m so sorry! I don’t normally text and walk, just I’m in a rush, so so so so sorry!” He’d blurted the apology out without even looking up, he raised his head to look up at the 6’5” behemoth and had to stop himself gasping again, the man had model-like good looks and for being so imposingly huge his emerald eyes showed genuine concern and his whole body language was just so welcoming, Daniel always had a thing for bigger guys, which at 5’3” is most men but still this man was just perfect, he felt a mild twitching in his jeans and then a major dizzy spell overcame him, he lost his footing and fell into the man who caught him with his thick arms. “Fuck… think you might have banged your head pretty bad, come sit down for a few minutes, make sure you’re all right” Daniel was too dizzy to even answer, he attempted to stand up properly and fell forward again. <br />
<br />
The man, clearly worried this kid might be properly concussed hoisted him over his shoulder and carried him around the back of the building they were next to, he hustled into a room that looked to be a cross between a locker room and dressing room and dropped him in a chair and then dropped to a knee “You with me buddy?” “uggghhhh… my, my head, its… its pounding” “Shit, just…. Just wait here, I’ve gotta go do my show, I’ll be back in 20, just relax alright?” Before Daniel could even answer some cheesy 80s song came on and the man rushed out the room, Daniel could hear a faint voice in the background “Ladies please welcome to the stage, TROOOOYYY” He heard a high pitched cheer and applause and he heard some voice deep in his head mutter “If they’re giving him those sort of cheers wait until they get a load of me” Daniel shook his head, damn he really must have concussed himself, hearing voices, an incredibly sexy voice he had to admit, deep, calm, laced with cockiness.<br />
<br />
Daniel shakily got to his feet, his whole centre of gravity felt off, he saw a full-length mirror in the corner next to a shower and stumbled over to it suddenly stopping the second he caught sight of himself. His peroxide blonde hair had streaks of brown running through it, Daniel had just gotten it done 2 days ago, down at his favourite salon, it was meant to last 2 months! Suddenly the cocky voice spoke again in his head “Only fags dye their hair and besides, why the fuck would I want to damage this luscious head?” Suddenly the brown spread outwards, consuming the lightness around it, his eyebrows growing darker, thicker and then suddenly an eruption, thick brown hair rolling out of his scalp and down to his bony shoulders, Daniel tugged on it, definitely real, he had to be passed out on the street or something, right? No way any of this was happening, I mean he must have just run into an actual wall? Everything from that hunky stripper to now was like some twisted dream “Hunky, hah! Stupid fairy has nothing on me, he just gives the girls a little show, I give them something they’re gonna remember!” The voice was getting louder, even more self-assured. Daniel tried to block it from his mind, what the hell was going on? <br />
<br />
His thoughts were interrupted by a sudden pain from his groin, his flat skinny jeans suddenly bubbled out as his 3” soft shaft tripled in size, his balls doubling along with it “I’m a shower not a grower but at this size who gives a fuck? One look at this beast and I could get any woman out there!” Daniel let out a guttural moan as he frantically unbuttoned the jeans, his Calvin Kleins showed signs of giving way under the enormity of his cock, he began to roll the jeans down his thighs, he only managed to get halfway before he couldn’t move them anymore, his stick thin legs were beginning to thicken, non-existent quads beginning to show, the tight denim stretched slightly but nowhere near enough to deal with the trunks of muscle that were rapidly emerging, his calves turning into cut diamonds, thighs pulsing, enlarging every second the muscle piling onto his short legs rapidly, how does someone even get legs like this? He heard the silky voice again “running 2 hours a day will do that, good way to pick up chicks too”. The jeans began to split down the side and Daniel gripped at them and tugged, not noticing his slim arms begin to bulge as he did so, with one last heave the jeans tore off and Daniel fell backwards, his formerly tight little ass surged out into a shelf of pure muscle, cushioning him slightly. <br />
<br />
When he landed the Calvins fell apart, exposing his flaccid 9”, “This… this isn’t real, this isn’t real, this isn’t real” Daniel panted, sweat pouring down his body, the alien cock in front of him twitched and began to harden looking down at the stunning legs and what was in between them only caused the pounding in his head to get worse, flashes of women nestled between these firm thighs, lowering their heads onto another head, Daniel looked up and caught himself smirking at this thought, he shivered, whatever was going on he needed to get out of this place and quickly, he got to his feet, finding he was walking more easily now and scoured the room for something, anything to cover himself “Cover yourself? Come on fag admit it, you love looking at this, fuck modesty, fuck fear, fuck worry, fuck it all” the words echoed in his head, his frantic movements slowed, his body loosened and like a spring held tightly down and then suddenly let go his 5’3” body shot upwards in an instant, his whole perception of the room shifting as he fell back into the chair he started in, his torso surging upwards, his legs bending further and further as they stretched, still maintaining the same level of pure muscle until he hit 6’6”, his shirt had ridden halfway up his stomach which was looking skeletal on this gigantic frame.<br />
<br />
“There we go, looking less like a little pussy now! Still a long way to go though” the voice said mockingly. Daniel knew this was all wrong, everything was but he just couldn’t get as panicked about it as he had been even 2 minutes before, he spotted his phone on the ground and reached for it, he could see his own arm lengthen, becoming someone else’s as he grasped and finally grabbed it, he switched the phone on and put his thumb on the sensor ‘fingerprint not recognised’, again ‘fingerprint not recognised’ he tried another 2 times before entering in the pin to access it, the first thing that came up was the group text he’d been having with his friends, as he began to type his fingers expanded, he managed to hastily write “In some stripper club at the top of the street, help!” and send it out to the group, seconds after hitting send he felt a numbness overcome his face, he quickly switched his phone’s selfie camera on and let out a sigh of relief, he still had his cherubic beauty, even if it was surrounded by a cascade of dark brown hair, “You think I wanna look like that? Shit you could be the biggest dude walking the earth and anyone could take one look at that face and know you’re a pansy, you’ve got to man the fuck up!” The voice was booming inside his head now, his own thoughts hard to come by, the numbness of his face intensified and he watched in horror as the small amount of baby fat was sucked away, his cheekbones pushing forwards and out as his rounded jaw became squarer, rougher, his thick lips thinned slightly as his button nose grew bigger, his brow pushed forward as brown consumed his baby blue eyes, he had gone from cute boyband member to seriously damn sexy and this is what finally broke Daniel down, the complete inability to recognise his former self at all allowed the voice, this… new him to assume control.<br />
<br />
Dan smirked into the camera and snapped a picture, sending it out on snapchat, the buttons on the tiny shirt all popped off at once as his slim shoulders surged outwards, traps rising, his arms had been slowly toning the whole time but he’d been too focused on other changes to notice, now they were seriously bulking up and for good reason too, Dan knew just how much women loved to fondle those big biceps of his, he tore the tiny short off himself as his flat chest curved outwards into hard and firm pecs. Dan got out of the chair and lay on the ground, as he began his nightly ritual of sit-ups his stomach gurgled and grew thicker, cobblestone abs pushing further and further out with each sit-up. He counted along, his lilty, airy voice growing deeper and smoother with each number until by 20 the voice that had been in Daniel’s head was now his own. As Daniel screamed in his mind he heard nothing back, this new him… this Dan’s ego was far too big to allow any other voice to be heard and no wonder, right? I mean Dan spent 15 years getting to this point, perfecting himself. With this though Dan began to age, the 19-year old’s body growing even thicker, another 8 years of careful shaping taking hold, every curve measured and perfect, every single muscle honed to perfection. Hair sprouted from his torso, a dusting covering everything, a tan seemed to spread out of each follicle until it consumed his formerly pasty body. Then the hair vanished, Dan hated having to shave himself but it was the manager’s policy that he had to begrudgingly accept, for how much he was getting paid that little bit of nuisance was worth it. <br />
<br />
He heard what he knew to be Troy’s last song finishing up and jumped to his feet, he looked at the chair he had been sitting in where a pile of clothes lay neatly, he pulled the string thong over his massive package then followed it up with a pair of tight boxers, Levi jeans, a white tank top, and flannel shirt. He walked over to the dressing room mirror and smirked again looking himself over, he grabbed his thick and luscious hair and tied it into a manbun, woman loved when he let that loose he chuckled to himself, he heard a knock on the door and the manager poked his head round, “Dan you’re up in 2 minutes, you’ve got a full bachelorette party sitting up front, they’ve asked that you give the bride to be a good time. Can’t miss her, looks just like young Salma Hayek. Do what you do best!” Dan smirked and grabbed his cock, he certainly would. He walked out as Troy walked past, Dan got on well with most of the other strippers but Troy? He couldn’t handle Troy, they’d been fine for 2 months then Dan found out he was a fag and that…. That was simply unacceptable, he wasn’t sharing a dressing room with one of THEM. “You best be gone when I’m done fag.” He sneered as he walked past Troy. “Ladies it’s time for your main event of the evening, give it up for Adonis!”</p>
