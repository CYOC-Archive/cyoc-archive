<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Bruno family<br />
<br />
Vinnie Bruno, 38 years old and father of four (swapped with Gino, took his son&#39;s name) <br />
Gino, 10 years old (swapped with Vinnie, took his father&#39;s name) <br />
Frankie Bruno, formerly 18 years old, now 7<br />
Sammy Bruno, formerly 6 years old, now 24<br />
Joey Bruno, formerly 12 years old, now 40<br />
<br />
The Upton family<br />
<br />
Ray Upton, age 33  (adopted father and distant cousin to Gus, swapped with Gus, took his son&#39;s name) <br />
Gus Delaney-Upton, age 8  (adopted son and distant cousin to Ray, swapped with Ray, took his father&#39;s name) <br />
<br />
&quot;We were about to get some breakfast. Why don&#39;t you fellas come along, huh?&quot; the New Vinnie led them to his &quot;boys&quot; who were now fully grown adults smoking cigarettes. He introduced them to Sammy, who was 6 years old until a few days ago but he was now 24 and looked very handsome and dapper. He stood taller than the rest of his family by a few inches at 6&#39;2&quot;. Vinnie, who was now the father of his family, stood at a solid 6&quot; feet tall. There was Joey, who used to be 12 and was now 40, He had more weathered looks and was handsomer in his mature looks than the rest of them, he would be a silver fox by the time he turned gray. Vinnie was overweight by about 20 pounds but his Italian swarthiness more than made up for it.  His former father, now Gino, was ten and was mainly going to spend his time today playing with his new &quot;brother&quot; Frankie. Formerly an 18 year old, Frankie wanted to escape the highly rigorous world of the military academy he was going to and wanted to regress the second he was given the option. <br />
<br />
The Brunos talked about their lives back in Jersey. Their family had their own business, a series of stores and mechanic shops. They were a successful and hardworking Italian family, though they had &quot;connections&quot; in the old country that knew about this place. Apparently organized criminals had been using it for hundreds of years to return to society a different age or in another body to escape detection of the law. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good news is none of us have to change our identities for good. We at least have a choice in the matter. I knew a don who swapped places with a friend of his grandson right before they locked him away. The kid didn&#39;t know what he was getting into, now he&#39;s doing time and he&#39;s only 14. But his father crossed the don so I guess that&#39;s the way it works for them, you know?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow. I&#39;m sure glad you don&#39;t have a rap sheet,&quot; New Ray joked, looking down at his &quot;son&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why would I? I&#39;m only 8 years old, DADDY,&quot; New Gus replied and the table laughed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, right. Of course,&quot; his new father humored him. &quot;So, have you decided if you&#39;re going to...stay this way?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably not. This vacation is just a vacation. A chance to see things from a different angle. Besides which, we have lives back home to go back to. I&#39;m not going to keep this body. I made that deal with junior here. Just for the next few weeks, I&#39;ll be the dad. Isn&#39;t that right...SON?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Sir! You&#39;re in charge until we go home, Sir.&quot; The ten year old Gino ate his pancakes happily. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and he can eat sugar and not get fat. Me? Now I can&#39;t eat anything without it going right here,&quot; he patted his now more ample gut. Vinnie was maybe 225 pounds at best but carried the fat well. He had beautiful eyes and a very masculine face, strong nose, a deep cleft in his new strong chin gave him a powerful look along with his now receding hairline, slicked back with hair gel. Even though Ray&#39;s sex drive hadn&#39;t kicked in yet, he found himself staring at the man and drooling a bit without realizing why. <br />
<br />
The new men were all having beer with their brunches. Ray helped himself to one as well. The kiddos had fruity drinks. <br />
<br />
&quot;I hear there are some playgrounds nearby. Why don&#39;t we bring the kids there?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Joey and I want to go check out a hiking trail,&quot; said Sammy. He looked like he might be fresh out of college, some bright eyed young man with staggering looks, like those of a magazine model. He had hauntingly beautiful eyes that Ray felt almost hypnotized by. Why am I staring so much at these guys? he wondered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and I don&#39;t exactly look like the playground type now, know what I mean?&quot; Joey said. He had been in junior high a few days ago and now he looked like he could be someone&#39;s principal. He looked like a no nonsense kind of adult, not some little kid people could just push around. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well, you guys are grown ups now. You can do as you like. Don&#39;t get into too much trouble,&quot; Vinnie smiled. He turned back to Ray and Gus. &quot;So when did you two uh...do your switcheroo?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Today,&quot; man and boy said at the same time. <br />
<br />
&quot;And uh...have you told him what happens to all the guys on this island that swap with each other?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, I thought Veronika would have told him.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;They usually send someone to your room after they turn your sex drive on. Takes a few days.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds funny,&quot; Ray said. &quot;Sex drive. Like I&#39;m in a car having sex or something.&quot; He laughed at his own joke. He was still maturing mentally. <br />
<br />
&quot;You wanna tell him, boy?&quot; Vinnie asked Gus. Gus looked slightly guilty. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Dad. The thing is...you know queers? Homosexuals?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Aunt Sylvia and Uncle Mortimer kind of hate them. The preacher says they&#39;re dirty, but I heard that the nice man at the drugstore down Walton Street was a homosexual and he&#39;s nice to everyone.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well...the thing is. I am one. And now you are, too. It&#39;s something that the island does. If you switch with a woman, you stay straight. If you switch with another guy, it turns you gay. There are very few single women on the island. They say they can turn you back when you go back to the mainland but the thing is...I found out I liked being with men better. It just suited me. All my life I was under pressure to find just the right girl. Instead,  I was able to get sex from men with no emotional baggage required. No ring, no proposal, no kids. Sex just became more fun for me. And a little bit more dangerous, which...I kind of liked.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So I&#39;m a homosexual now?&quot; Ray was slightly bewildered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about a thing. Just enjoy it. You can always go back to being straight when your time here is done,&quot; Vinnie explained. &quot;Or you can do like junior over here and keep bein&#39; a homo if that&#39;s your thing. Me? I&#39;m enjoying myself quite a lot so far. And I&#39;ve only been here for less than a week!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this is certainly an adventure,&quot; Ray said, attacking his bacon and sausage with gusto. <br />
<br />
The two new fathers led their new boys down a well marked path to an area filled with other children, playing on rope bridges, rope swings, merry-go-rounds, slides, jungle gyms, tree houses covered with netting and tire swings galore. The two men had fun exploring for a little while before leaving their kids to themselves. <br />
<br />
Gus was having a lot of fun with his new friend Gino. They ran and played so much that time just seemed to fly by. Soon enough, their fathers were calling to them that it was time to go. They smiled at each other. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is it weird that we can&#39;t decide when we can play?&quot; Gino asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Those are the rules! I LOVE being a kid again!&quot; Gus was excited in this new tiny body. He was now at eye level with his former crotch, he noticed, looking way up at Ray&#39;s beaming face. The two new men were becoming very chummy and seemed to ignore the kids as they were lost in their own conversation as they headed back to the hotel. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess so. I guess sometimes I miss my old body but this one doesn&#39;t have any fat at all. I&#39;m so thin now!&quot; Gino exclaimed. <br />
<br />
The two families ate dinner at separate restaurants but decided to meet up later. Vinnie kissed Ray on both cheeks, calling it an Italian tradition. He had to stand on his tiptoes to do so. Ray couldn&#39;t believe he was taller than MOST other men now! Being 6&#39;4&quot; was great fun! He blushed, remembering Vinnie&#39;s kiss on his stubble. He suddenly wanted more than just a kiss on the cheek. <br />
<br />
Ray decided to have his first martini. It was such an adult thing to drink, and he smiled as he drank it. His new boy was the one who couldn&#39;t drink alcohol now. The freedom of it made him giddy. <br />
<br />
He led his son down to the beach so they could have a father son walk and they watched the sun set. It was majestic and beautiful here in this colorful tropical paradise, orange and golden clouds everywhere. Before he knew what he was doing, New Ray was picking up his former father and carrying him around, swinging him around on the beach with his arms, until they were both dizzy and laughing. He could just pick up a child with his big body without any problem now! They lay down on the surf together and the waves barely touched the pair as they receded. Gus hugged his new daddy&#39;s bare chest, which had more than a little chest fur which he could now play with. He ran his hands through the pile of manly fur. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hard to believe I don&#39;t have any chest hair now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Now why would a little BOY have chest hair, hmm?&quot; Ray kissed his new son on the forehead. &quot;I wanna do something else. Come here. I&#39;m going to give you a piggy back ride on my shoulders!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Really!??&quot;<br />
<br />
Soon he was being hoisted up in the air and he was sitting on his new father&#39;s shoulders. Wow! The world looked different from up here. His father carried him back to the hotel. It was so exciting. His father was a strong giant! he thought. Ray was definitely having a lot of fun exploring his new height. He bent down again and the boy was suddenly on the ground looking way up at his old face. <br />
<br />
&quot;You really want to trade places for good, don&#39;t you?&quot; Ray asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think so. But it&#39;s up to you...Dad.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I do like you calling me Dad. Makes me feel real big and adult...ish.&quot; Ray smiled rather sheepishly and it made him even sexier, the new Gus thought. He&#39;s just so downright sexy. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m this attracted to my own body, he thought. Wait...I&#39;m only a boy now. Why am I feeling this way? Maybe it&#39;s just because I&#39;m excited and this is the first time I&#39;ve been a boy since I regressed last time I was here. <br />
<br />
&quot;I was here before, you know. They turned me into a little boy version of myself. They gave me the ability to retain my adult you know, thoughts and stuff.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Adult sensibilities?&quot; Ray added. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Those,&quot; Gus said, finding it more difficult to describe things the way he could as a grownup. &quot;I feel a lot different now. Definitely more like a kid and stuff.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;m beginning to feel much more adult. Maybe it was that martini,&quot; Ray thought out loud. Now where were all the hot guys supposed to be on this island? he thought suddenly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Upton? May I have a word with you?&quot; It was Stefano, the hotel employee that had attended to them in the magical hot spring. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...sure. You go on up back to our room, son. I&#39;ll meet you there,&quot; New Ray told New Gus. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; <br />
<br />
With Gus gone, Stefano turned back to Ray. &quot;Your sex drive will be operational within a few hours. I need to go over the effects of male puberty with you now. You have adult male equipment now. You see, your testicles store sperm...&quot; and suddenly as he was talking, Ray was filled with images of sex, including a comfortable approach to the subject. No worries or fears. He felt supremely confident in this body, though the more he thought about it, the more he wanted to pack on some muscle. He wanted to know what it was like to really be strong! <br />
<br />
Stefano explained it all and now Ray couldn&#39;t wait. He was so grownup now! He had a big dick and it was going to apparently feel really good if he touched it and it got hard. Sounds weird, he thought, on his way back up to their room. Why would it get hard and then feel good? But Stefano said it felt so good he would want to do it multiple times a day and told him it was natural to want to be with other men as he had orgasms. <br />
<br />
He had only been in his hotel suite for a few minutes when there was a knock at the door. It was Vinnie. <br />
<br />
&quot;I uh...thought you could use some company. I thought the kids could hang out by the pool and we could grab some drinks at the bar.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds great. Come on, son. Get dressed for the pool. Would you like to see Gino again?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! Gino is so cool!&quot; Gus yelled from his room. <br />
<br />
Soon enough, the pairs of new dads and sons were off to have a fun night at La Vida Variada...</p>
