<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The weekend following the football game began quietly for Molly and I. With no school on Saturday or Sunday, Molly didn't need to go in to teach. She could technically go in to set lesson plans for the coming weak, but that was something that Molly could also do at home. She largely took that route. And I was able to enjoy the weekend for the same reason. Since there was no school, the DARE officers weren't required to be on duty. <br />
<br />
Originally, Officer Barnes and I were only to take over the position temporarily. Work the DARE program for a few select days a week and patrol the rest of the days in the week. However, between the intensity of the School District Superintendent's race, the cost of Washerman's actions in the Columbia Falls area, and other budgetary concerns, the situation had changed. Officer Barnes and I would do the DARE work full time until Officer Howard could allocate the funds to hire a permanent DARE officer, or until the summer came again. This meant that the weekend gave Officer Barnes and I time off for the weekend.<br />
<br />
I spent the Saturday with Molly working with various things around our cabin. Mostly straightening things out, doing laundry, and routine cleaning. All rather routine and mundane things. And thanks to progress made over the summer, things like the laundry were easier to do. Our laundry room originally housed not only the washing machine and dryer, but also the deep freeze to store meat when the cabin was merely a hunting cabin that Michael York had rented out to hunters coming up for the fall hunting season from other areas. Of course, he did that because his daughter had moved to be with her husband and had no physical use for the cabin.<br />
<br />
As a result of all this, the laundry room had a strong mixed scent of bleach and blood in it as the room had been used to butcher kills made by the hunters and Molly's kills during her first hunting season. The floor was concrete in comparison to the wood or &quot;wood-like&quot; flooring in the rest of the cabin, which was probably a good thing. The blood from the slaughtered deer would probably permanently stain the wood. However, that situation had now changed.<br />
<br />
With our garage completed, Molly and I had moved our butchering operation into the garage. It was larger and thanks to the help from the people who built it for us was better suited tot he work of processing our kills. Now, with the hunting season over, Molly and I were using the garage as a garage. My Ford Ranger was now parked inside to make sure it wouldn't be damaged by a major blizzard. Our first winter in Columbia Falls had been fairly moderate. Total snow fall seemed about normal, according to what Officer Barnes had told me, but air temperatures were slightly warmer, and there was little wind or blizzards. This largely kept many of the main highways open. Normally, big blizzards rolled through the mountains and many roads were commonly snow covered completely, or so coated in ice that traveling on them was dangerous and the roads were closed. That also meant that the wiring and electrical systems in vehicles could face trouble during the winter if exposed for too long...<br />
<br />
Now, while Molly and I walked just about everywhere we went in town, we did have the occasion when one of us would need a ride. Either a big trip, such as our journey back to Peoria for Leon's wedding, or smaller trips to Kallispel. The trips to Kallispell were usually for the purposes of buying the various medicines Molly and I needed to take to repeal fleas, ticks, heart worms, and other parasites. So preserving my Ford Ranger as a transport vehicle, even if we'd need someone else to drive us, was a must. So... we did what anyone would do with their vehicle. We put it in the garage.<br />
<br />
And this left our laundry room as just that, a laundry room. Only now, there was a door that lead to a small passageway that led to the garage. There was some lingering scent of blood from past butchering... but that scent was now being replaced by the scent of bleach and other clothing detergents. With the additional space, Molly and I were also taking to storing other cleaning products in there since the laundry room had the space for them.<br />
<br />
And I was in there, working on cleaning my uniforms when Molly returned carrying a vacuum cleaner.<br />
<br />
&quot;There,&quot; Molly announced as she set the vacuum cleaner down, &quot;all or rugs are done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bandhavgarh Cabin mostly had wood floors, but there were a couple of places where we had set down small rugs in some rooms, and from time to time they did need some vacuuming.<br />
<br />
&quot;And my uniforms are going through the wash,&quot; I told her, &quot;and our hunting clothes are in the dryer. I suppose we're done for a little while.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That will obviously change when their cycles are done,&quot; Molly quipped as I approached her. She was referring to the laundry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; I nodded and gently rubbed one of her shoulders.<br />
<br />
While we waited, we moved to our living room and decided to watch a little TV while we waited. It was late afternoon and when we turned on the television, the channel we were on was running its half-hour national news program. The station was running reports on the Animatrix Serum and its distribution. Mostly as a &quot;human-interest&quot; story and showed how it was changing the world. They even showed a map with the total number of Animatrix orders listed by percentage. Some of that wasn't too surprising, what Molly and I found surprising however, was that the map was global. There were now Animal People in various corners of the Earth. In parts of Europe, Africa, the Caribbean, Central and South America, Asia, and Australia. The US had the greatest percentage with Canada and Mexico being close seconds though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you ever think the Animatrix Serum would go international?&quot; Molly wondered after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once it was legal to sell, it wasn't impossible,&quot; I shrugged, &quot;the discovery that the Serum was real and Changes' scheme was reported on the news and thus everyone learned about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you think they're doing?&quot; Molly wondered, &quot;are they having to deal with a European version of Beauregard?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think so,&quot; I commented. Everything I'd ever seen on Europe seemed to indicate a much less violent and combative culture from America, but that could simply be a traveler's picture of tourist spots. The news coverage of the Norwegian terrorist and his bomb and the fact that his ideology was based in various American Evangelicals that preached a Holy War to kill all Muslims was proof enough that Europe likely had the same problems America did. &quot;But you never know... the people there that don't like Animal People may simply go about it in a different way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly only sighed and leaned against me, &quot;I hope people treat them right...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; I answered.<br />
<br />
Molly and I were never big fans of selling the Animatrix Serum, but we weren't about to back punishing those who did decide to take the Serum. If those who took it didn't use the Serum to break the law, they were entitled to a good life and protection from anyone who would deny them their freedom.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Our Saturday had been quiet. Our Sunday was not as quiet. Not bad, but not as quiet as the day before. It began as much as it normally would. Molly and I got up and had breakfast. We were just finishing breakfast when our phone rang.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got it,&quot; I said to Molly, who was still eating, and got up.<br />
<br />
I moved up the stairs and calmly answered the phone. As I did so, I found it was Officer Howard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Officer Wayne?&quot; Officer Howard asked from his end of the phone line.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir,&quot; I responded... &quot;I am here, sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry to bother you on a day off for you, but some things have come up and will be needing you and Officer Barnes to come into the station for a few minutes,&quot; Officer Howard spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong, sir?&quot; I wondered, &quot;have we done something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; Officer Howard replied, &quot;I recently received some information that will likely have to force us to change some things... or at least prepare for them. I need you and Officer Barnes to come in so I can explain the situation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have to come in in person, sir?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Officer Howard replied, &quot;best to have a face to face conversation on this. Don't worry, you don't need to be in uniform, you will be paid for this meeting, and it shouldn't last too long... and as I said, I'm sorry to have to disturb you on a day you've been give off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, sir,&quot; I nodded, &quot;I'll be there as soon as I can.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, the line went dead, indicating that Officer Howard had hung up. I slowly hung up the phone and went downstairs. By this time, Molly had finished eating and was beginning to take our breakfast plates back into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who was on the phone, dear?&quot; Molly asked as she heard my footsteps approaching.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was Officer Howard,&quot; I told her, &quot;apparently something has come up and he needs Officer Barnes and I to come down to the station.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing wrong, I hope,&quot; Molly commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think so,&quot; I answered, &quot;and I don't think it'll be too long, and he isn't expecting us to come in uniform...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Molly nodded, &quot;so you're heading out now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Afraid I have to,&quot; I answered, &quot;I'll see you when I get back.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that I went out. The air temperature was cooling as we were rapidly approaching the middle/end of fall and the beginning of the mountain winter. Things weren't too bad, my fur did more then enough to keep me warm, but I guessed that it wouldn't be too long before we'd get our first snow of the fall/winter season. And in the back of my mind, that reminded me of the other major season coming up for Molly and I. Mating season and the ability for Molly and I to start a family. Of course we still had the election to get through, and since we were only in the late weeks of August to the early weeks of September, those things were still a fair way into the future.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
I arrived at the station to find things going through a fairly quietly. As I did so, I met Officer Barnes and a guest coming in as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know why we're being called in?&quot; I asked to him as we came closer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not any more then you likely do,&quot; Officer Barnes answered, &quot;Though, I'd say the timing isn't all that great. I was getting ready to take Megan, here to the park and play a little catch.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked down to see the cub playing with a Frisbee in her paws.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you're going to get a pony,&quot; Megan stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't have mounted officers,&quot; Officer Barnes answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And outside of food, a horse serves no practical purpose for me,&quot; I added, &quot;I'm too heavy to ride one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn't you want to eat one?&quot; Megan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; I shook my head, &quot;beef and venison are better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan seemed to accept that and followed us in. Some games continued as everyone once and a while, I'd feel the Frisbee bounce off of my tail. It seemed to confirm what Molly and I suspected would be the case when we would have cubs. Our tails would be their perfect playthings. As we entered, Officer Barnes took Megan to where Officer Jenkins was seated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Mommy!&quot; Megan announced herself and hopped/climbed into Officer Jenkins' lap and began to nuzzle her head into Officer Jenkins's chin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, hello,&quot; Officer Jenkins gave a slightly smiling response, &quot;and what brings you here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was gonna play catch with daddy, but he has to see the chief,&quot; Megan answered and continued to nuzzle her mother, &quot;so I have to wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Jenkins then lifted Megan up a bit, grunting a little as she did so to set Megan in her lap.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose you could sit with me until your father is through with the &quot;chief&quot;,&quot; Officer Jenkins told her. Megan nodded, while Officer Jenkins then turned to Officer Barnes and I, &quot;Go on in. Officer Howard should be expecting you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Barnes and I nodded and went toward Officer Howard's office. He was seated behind his desk and working on some paperwork as we came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're here, sir,&quot; Officer Barnes announced.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... good morning, Officer Barnes, Officer Wayne,&quot; Officer Howard nodded, &quot;Sorry to trouble you on a day you have off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright, sir,&quot; Officer Barnes answered, &quot;Is anything wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing is really wrong,&quot; Officer Howard sighed heavily, &quot;but some things are just going on. I got a call yesterday afternoon from Joseph Patten, one of the main school board members. Apparently our School District Superintendent's race is getting so heated that the local news companies in the state are taking interest in it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The election has been heated,&quot; I commented, &quot;even in Peoria, School Board and Superintendent races aren't all that big. All they do is post signs that say vote for... and then they list the candidate's name. Debates that are held are commonly only done once to state their policies and that is it... but because of the issues revolving around this particular race and the events of it, it's gone from what is normally a non-partisan, non-political into a partisan, political battle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Howard nodded to that.<br />
<br />
&quot;And because it's so heated, local/state news groups are interested in covering it,&quot; Officer Howard nodded.<br />
<br />
And that was likely. Channels like CNN, MSNBC, FOX News were all national level news channels that largely focused on national level issues. CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox and various local channels had one news program that covered national issues and one that was more local. These local news programs varied with the location. Some regional broadcasters didn't even come from Montana. I looked at a coverage brochure once on where they came from... and southeastern corner of Montana's local broadcaster for Fox, NBC, and ABC actually came from Rapid City, South Dakota, while their CBS came from Billings. Our area in Columbia Falls was largely broadcasted out of Missoula and Helena. And their reporters were now interested in our race.<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it they're wanting to come out here?&quot; Officer Barnes asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Officer Howard nodded, &quot;and it means the two of you will need to be tactful and careful with what you say. Because the race is largely revolving around whether or not Animal People have rights, they will undoubtedly come to you at some time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When are they supposed to arrive?&quot; I wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're probably arriving today,&quot; Officer Howard answered, &quot;they won't begin any sort of real covering until tomorrow. It'll be tough to cover things while we're inactive, but they'll want to have their operation set up before hand, and their operation will certainly be bigger then those National Geographic guys that filmed for Frontier Force.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All for thirty minutes of coverage,&quot; Officer Barnes commented.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The rest of the Sunday went fairly well, and just about everyone did know about the arrival of these reporters. Patten had apparently called the cabin while I was out and informed Molly about it. She seemed &quot;okay&quot; with it, but I did get the impression that it was a bit too much attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Things will hopefully quiet down after the election,&quot; I told her in a soft voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope so, George,&quot; Molly told me, &quot;I really hope so.&quot;<br />
<br />
And I did agree with her. We did want Animal People to be treated fairly and equally with humans. As those who had made the choice to become Animal-People needed to have their choices respected. Regardless of what it was. Some of those designs may not have been made with the smartest forethought or preparation, as Laura's friend who had become a Red Fox Vixen to make herself look better had realized when she pounced on and ate a mouse that had gotten into her house. Some had rushed things, like Marcella, but had done so for love. Some were honoring departed pets. Clemens had changed to gain first hand understanding on the instincts of the various species of pythons invading Florida's swamps and forests. And some seemed to just feel more connected with animals, and others had the idea that they'd save an endangered species by becoming that species. People shouldn't lose their rights for those decisions.<br />
<br />
And those that were the victims of Changes' scheme, or like myself had changed when they had sex with a girlfriend or boyfriend who was a victim of Changes' scheme had no real choice. &quot;We&quot; were victims of a lunatic using a scientific formula before it was ready to make a quick buck. Taking away the rights of Animal People that had been victimized by Changes was also wrong and highly racist. It was like punishing someone for being a victim.<br />
<br />
The media attention was probably a sign of the battle on that issue. Hireman desperately clinging on to Beauregard's racist ideology, and Tabby trying to stand up for what was right. It might mean that the chaos that Hireman had recently unleashed would get worse because more attention would be drawn to it, but it might also create some positive attention. Between the two, I hoped it was the later. And on the following Monday morning, Officer Barnes and I got a call that brought that situation to light.<br />
<br />
We had just entered our office when the phone rang. Officer Barnes was the one who answered it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Columbia Falls PD DARE office,&quot; Officer Barnes spoke, &quot;Officer Frederick Barnes speaking.&quot;<br />
<br />
I then faintly heard the response. It was Mrs. Fitzpatrick from the Elementary School.<br />
<br />
&quot;Officer Barnes,&quot; Mrs. Fitzpatrick spoke, &quot;I believe we have a slight mission for you and your partner. I've got a ton of reporters here that have showed up wanting to interview Mrs. Wayne and Mr. Patten as part of the election coverage. Now Patten has an aide, and I can take over Mrs. Wayne's class for the length of the interview, but if you and Officer Wayne could come to provide some basic security for this, that would be helpful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Security?&quot; Officer Barnes wondered, &quot;You think a bunch of reporters are going to attack?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; was Mrs. Fitzpatrick's response, &quot;but I'm sure they'll attract attention and when the kids go to recess or go to PE or go to the library... depending how long these guys will stay... they may figure the reporters are a good thing to investigate. Mostly you'll be a metaphorical wall to keep the kids from bothering the reporters and the reporters from disturbing our classrooms.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Officer Barnes nodded, &quot;we don't have any scheduled drug inspections today, so we'll be right down. Where do you want us go go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now I have them in the main entryway,&quot; Mrs. Fitzpatrick answered, &quot;They won't be going anywhere else until I'm certain there won't be any disturbances.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, we're on our way,&quot; Officer Barnes answered, and then hung up.<br />
<br />
&quot;The reporters have arrived,&quot; Officer Barnes then announced to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here we go...&quot; I sighed.</p>
