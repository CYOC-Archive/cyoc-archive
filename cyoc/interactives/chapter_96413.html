------------------------<br />
As you scream into the void, your mind shoots back to school. A pregnant white teacher stood in front of you, in a small dilapidated classroom with nothing but white children wearing tattered clothes. &quot;In 1619, Dutch slave traders arrived in Africa to find slaves for agriculture. However, upon seeing a tribe of Africans for the first time, the Dutch were instantly enamored with them. Their Negro bodies were simply stronger, faster, taller. It was apparent to all of them, physically, Negros were simply better than them. None of them would admit it, but they were even aroused by the mere sight of a Negro. The meeting of the slave traders and the Africans was fate. It would be centuries of course until we discovered that Negro DNA is a triple helix. Unlike our inferior Dual Helix DNA which is designed to submit and change for our surroundings, their DNA is designed to conquer. This same research was also what revealed the 48th chromosome all whites have, the sub-gene, which compels us on a genetic level to serve Negros.&quot; She looked down at her belly, holding it lovingly, then looked back up. &quot;The Africans civilization was still primitive, but purely because of a lack of natural resources. The Dutch told the Africans of a place with mountains of food, rivers crossing the entire continent, and unspoiled land. A place called America. They told the Africans they would have to go as their slaves though. The Africans agreed, and thus the Dutch were deceived. It&#39;s been scientifically proven, Negro men are three times smarter than whites, and Negro women are sometimes over eight times as smart. On the long voyage every one of the Dutch sailors was seduced, some by women, some by men. By the time the boat arrived in the New Orleans, the Dutch had willingly submitted to the Africans as their slaves, and most of the Africans now spoke fluent English, among several other languages. Many of the Africans kept their new slaves, but most sold them off and used the funds to start businesses. Their innate ingenuity and genetic attraction made Negro owned businesses thrive, and allowed them to spread their influence. Their sexual prowess also ensured that within 2 generations, Negros were the majority in a quarter of what would become the Amerika. Far too intelligent to delve into petty squabbles, no Negro was stupid enough to go into politics. They understood what was truly important. By 1784, the majority of all higher education was administrated and taught by Negros, and using their superior intelligence, they started what would become known as the American Renaissance. The Arts and Sciences flourished, culminating in 1810 when the greatest of Negro minds created the automobile, the airplane, the radio, antibiotics, electrical batteries, and automatic rifles, all within a year. It was this development that made the United States the worlds leading superpower nearly overnight and ensured our economic domination. However only a few decades later the great war broke out in europe. And with our allies being attacked by the new Persian empire, America sent aid to it&#39;s allies. With half of America wanting to join the war, and the other half wanting to simply mind our own buisness, the country became divided. With the threat of a civil war looming, one courageous, strong, intelligent, pure blooded Negro took the responsibility of control. Our first Shemale Negro President Sarah Walters.&quot; All the kids in the class room turned to look at a picture on the wall. A proud looking black woman wearing victorian era clothes, pants instead of a skirt, while holding a book in one hand and a rifle in the other. Just looking at her picture made your body tingle strangely. &quot;Sarah Walters gave her speech to the world, telling them all to return to their homes, from the first television broadcast ever made, ending the war instantly.&quot; Looking underneath Sarah&#39;s picture a stylized quote hung on a banner  &#39;The only Nigger you have to fear is the one you defy.&#39; Reading it always made you feel tingly. &quot;Sarah Walters served four terms before she retired and was succeeded by Emelia Johnson. And from the moment of her speech, our greatest, most pure Negros would be given the honorary title of Nigger. Proud Niggers like Hershel Mason, who created the first reel to reel computer in 1894, Shaina Peterson whose research in genetics allowed the every day gene therapy that has enriched all of our lives, and Johnathan Richey who mapped the Negro genome in 1943, and found the 48th chromosome.&quot; You could hear her voice waiver as she spoke of them, her breathing getting erratic, her hardened nipples tenting out her shirt. &quot;In the 1950s a sexual revolution took place, Johnathan Richey&#39;s research allowed Negros, and especially Niggers, to choose the gender and build of the fetus, creating almost an entire generation of physically perfect Negro shemales. From that point on, it was ludicrous to think that gender preference, class differences, or even age meant anything to whites anymore when it came to our duty to serve a race so superior to ourselves. in 1952, our last white congressman stepped down from his position after opposing the GeneTherapy integration act, and the mistake of a white holding office would never be repeated again. No one knows why he opposed it, being that the public desired it so much. From that day on specialized brands of food just for whites would be required in stores, foods laced with GT additives that would suppress aggressive tendencies, soften features, increase white female fertility, and reshape white male hips and shoulders into something more pleasing for Negros to be served by. By 1958, the United States had changed it&#39;s name to Amerika, whites were no longer allowed to hold administrative office of any kind, non-negros could not vote, and could only hold part time jobs unless serving a Negro. Amerika prospered, with whites being bred down to minority levels, and almost all decisions made by the people they should be. But all was not well, certain whites, mutations lacking the 48th chromosome began to emerge. They refused the GT foods and lobbied for minority rights. The Negros wished to take pity on them, but most of the whites were furious that some of their race would be so defiant, garnering the mutations the name Defiants.&quot; Several of the children spit on the floor the moment the word was uttered. &quot; This trend began to proliferate. Many of the newest white children would be born Defiants, and we true whites suffered such shame. We knew we had failed in our service, and could not allow some abnormalities in our genetic pool to taint us in the eyes of our Negro leaders. So in 1984, after the whites of every state had unanimously voted, all restrictions on slavery were lifted and the Negro Superiority Ordinance was signed into law. &quot; <br />
The teacher wrote the words on the board: Negro Superiority Ordinance<br />
&quot;Under the NSO, unowned whites have no rights, may not own property, may not marry other whites, breed with other whites, or travel without a Negro escort. Whites who are owned by a Negro have Slave rights, they may own property, marry and breed with who they choose, and travel without escort. Unowned whites are able to gain temporary slave rights by fulfilling quotas. Unowned white males may gain slave rights for 24 hours by absorbing enough Negro DNA, and unowned white females my gain slave rights by being impregnated by a Negro, gaining slave rights as long as she is pregnant. Any white males that have not absorbed Negro DNA for more than 24 hours are subject to arrest, as are unowned white females who have not given birth to a Negro baby for more than a year. Repeat offenders are subject to re-education, though offenders may elect to do on-site DNA infusions and impregnations from the arresting Negro officers.&quot;<br />
