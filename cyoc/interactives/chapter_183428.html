<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The end of the school year brought a great many changes, though the biggest of these related to events building around the Bowman farm, though there was good reason for that. With Nate now graduated from College, he&#39;d completed the education he needed to move out into the world, and there was only one place he wanted to be, with Shuixing on Heiya Island and he did his best to let her know of that he and his father were busy working on scheduling things on their end for the coming wedding. Though there were still some of the other pieces of friendly conversation that went along with various Skype/Zoom calls that the two had when they could.<br />
<br />
&quot;I say you did look good in the cap and gown,&quot; Shuixing gave a bit of a smile, &quot;and the people the pictures looked fairly friendly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of the others were friends I&#39;d made in college, and were all very happy to learn of our own happily ever after coming up,&quot; Nate gave with a beaming smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;And they had no problem with my being Chinese?&quot; Shuixing asked. Granted a lot of that sort of prejudice hadn&#39;t caused too much trouble in Lyre/Animalia, but Wisconsin was a different state and Shuixing had seen enough of the news reports to recognize the problems that came from blaming a country for the pandemic. Nate picked up on this, though.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure they don&#39;t,&quot; Nate answered, &quot;but even if they did... hopefully they&#39;d be smart enough not to mess a martial arts master like yourself. A few even asked for photos from the wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shuixing gave a small smile back, &quot;among others that have asked for pictures or to come along...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of those that want to come along are family friends,&quot; Nate answered, &quot;and family... though how well that will work for Olly to get Nelly to come may be up in the air.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shuixing nodded. Nate had told about this in that there might be some details on Meryl getting pregnant after her and Olly telling Reggie in Animalia that they weren&#39;t planning on starting their own family so that Blueberry and Ulysses could start theirs. Nate didn&#39;t know the full details on the interaction between his uncle and his sister, but that was also something that wasn&#39;t truly their business and not something that either Nate or Shuixing could work with. Nate watched as Shuixing nodded and then took a sip from a bottle of water.<br />
<br />
&quot;And how are Blueberry and Meryl doing?&quot; Shuixing asked, as this would relate to the biggest thing that was related to the scheduling for their wedding. There was the hope that with the pandemic starting to ease in some places that a more &quot;normal&quot; life would start to resume and that their wedding would be a sign of that as the IAC on Heiya Island got going, though Shuixing wasn&#39;t sure on what the honeymoon would be. There had been some thought on touring the colonies again and she could introduce Nate to some of the friends that she and the rest of the Five Elements had made on their first colony tour, but that had been before the pandemic and she wasn&#39;t sure on the safety of going to some of the areas where the pandemic was still rampant. But while Blueberry and Meryl were pregnant, those issues weren&#39;t a concern as they had reached the point where they couldn&#39;t fly until AFTER they&#39;d given birth.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re doing well,&quot; Nate answered, &quot;though, I think both are ready for giving birth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When are they due?&quot; Shuixing wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;According to dad, Blueberry should be due in the middle of June at the earliest,&quot; Nate replied, &quot;I&#39;d imagine that Aunt Meryl would be in similar condition. So until then... all we can do is wait. Our minister did accept the idea of doing two ceremonies and will come along. Though if there is any question on &quot;who goes first&quot; won&#39;t be settled until he can talk with who will conduct the ceremony that would be appropriate for Heiya Island, you, and your sisters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And everyone on our end accepts that,&quot; Shuixing nodded, &quot;though... I&#39;ve been getting requests and questions about how our wedding will tie in with the IAC.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me guess... your sisters carry you to the alter with Kung Fu moves?&quot; Nate teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s some of the jokes going out there on Twitter,&quot; Shuixing chuckled, &quot;I think they want us to have a role in the IAC on Heiya Island. Either as competitors or as judges.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate chuckled, &quot;Yeah... though a lot of that will have to wait until after Blueberry and Aunt Meryl give birth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shuixing nodded.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Downstairs and in the kitchen, Ulysses was working on dinner while Blueberry sat at one of the chairs nearby with some minor look of irritation at being asked to sit and relax.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could help, dear,&quot; Blueberry said calmly with one and rubbing her extended womb for the moment. She&#39;d enjoyed being pregnant and was happy to bring new life into the world with Ulysses, though now as her due date was getting closer, she also felt bloated and almost helpless. She wanted to be able to do more than just sit and eat.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know... but I don&#39;t want you hurt or taxed to the point where our calf is hurt,&quot; Ulysses answered while working on the salads that included slicing tomatoes, &quot;the doctors said they wanted you to be able to relax. I would want you to be healthy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You worry a bit too much,&quot; Blueberry answered, &quot;soon our calf will be born. You will become an uncle and Nate will marry Shuixing. It&#39;d be like the trifecta of happiness.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ulysses managed a small chuckle as she got up to her feet and straightened the robe she was wearing. The material was thin and soft, mostly to avoid overheating. Winter had long since passed and now early June temperatures in Wisconsin were rather warm. That was another one of the things that worried Ulysses a bit with regard to Blueberry, and even Meryl. Both were healthy and strong Animalian females, but he knew that heat could kill and he&#39;d heard stories of some ranchers that actually lost cattle to heat because they either didn&#39;t put out enough water or kept them in a barn that effectively held heat in it. The last thing he wanted was for Blueberry or Meryl to suffer from heatstroke.<br />
<br />
&quot;It also presents its worries,&quot; Ulysses managed as he felt Blueberry&#39;s hand touch his bicep, &quot;My oldest son off to start a new chapter in his life... a new branch of the Bowman farm in a new place, complete with martial arts lessons... I can&#39;t help but worry and be proud at the same time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You love him,&quot; Blueberry commented as Ulysses put the knife down. She soon pulled him into a hug and placed one of his hands on the upper swell of her womb, &quot;and that is a good thing for a good father. And I&#39;m sure that Nate knows and respects that as well. And he will love his younger sibling too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ulysses nodded with a small smile, &quot;I&#39;m sure, and I am looking forward to that... but that doesn&#39;t change all the things to worry about. The guest list and travel arrangements shouldn&#39;t be too bad. I&#39;m not sure on how long the IAC on Heiya Island will go... but they&#39;ll have to wait for after you and Meryl give birth.&quot; Blueberry nodded at that. &quot;But then there is some of the other things that need to be done. I&#39;ve gotten in contact with one neighbor who can&#39;t go to the wedding but will still be in the area, so he can check on the cows while we&#39;re gone, make sure they have food and water and aren&#39;t stuck in a place where they&#39;d cook in the heat. All that sort of thing. I&#39;ll owe him some photos and some other favor later, I&#39;m sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the minister?&quot; Blueberry asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He seemed fine with two ceremonies when Nate and I talked with him yesterday,&quot; Ulysses nuzzled his muzzle to Blueberry&#39;s, &quot;though he did want to go first, but we couldn&#39;t give any confirmation on that until after he could talk with the Buddhist equivalent of a &quot;minister...&quot; I really don&#39;t know the details. He accepted that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blueberry nodded and watched as Ulysses chuckled a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;And then he made the joke that if we&#39;d time it right, Nate and Shuixing would be married on our wedding anniversary,&quot; Ulysses commented. &quot;And while the timing of the wedding can&#39;t be perfect, it still got me thinking on how much things have changed over the course of a year. You&#39;ve made me happy in ways I never thought possible, we&#39;ll have a child of our own soon... and pretty much all of this has happened in the space of a year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A good adventure,&quot; Blueberry answered, &quot;and will get even better if you let me help get dinner ready. I&#39;m pregnant, not crippled.&quot;</p>
