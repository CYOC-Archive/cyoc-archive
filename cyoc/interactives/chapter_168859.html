<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Keith felt like he might as well be on cloud 9.<br />
<br />
This was going to be the first time he had ever engaged in sexual relations with a woman. Sure he had watched pornography before and knew to some degree what to expect, but seeing it through a screen and observing it with his own eyes right in front of him were two vastly different things. So it might have prepared him to at least a little degree for the lewd noises and the passion on display, but Keith leaned on Vinny&#39;s expertise with lovemaking and tried not to get too overexcited.<br />
<br />
Having this weird mental thing going on with Vinny had never felt better. Sure he had to deal with Vinny&#39;s more cold, darker impulses now and then, but Keith was reasonably sure that ultimately he was in control. It was kind of like playing a video game and being really immersed into the character of Vinny. Which was what brought him ultimately to where he was now. Making out with this woman in front of him. This blond bombshell who never would&#39;ve paid Keith even the slightest bit of mind when he was just his normal self. They were heading over to his car - supposedly she wanted to &quot;go for a ride&quot;.<br />
<br />
Heh, go for a ride. It was the most basic and obvious of innuendos, but it still made Keith&#39;s blood run hot and straight to his groin as the two of them moved.<br />
<br />
Keith didn&#39;t need to be a rocket scientist to read into this what she actually wanted. Her hands kept feeling his rock hard pectorals and strong abs as they walked and kissed. She was so into his body and Keith had never felt like someone was this interested in him ever before. Eventually he asked her, &quot;So...&quot; A kiss and her feeling his groin, &quot;Ooh...you have a name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Krista...what&#39;s yours, big guy?&quot; She asked in turn, and Keith actually had to contemplate that one for a moment. He couldn&#39;t well give his real name, so...<br />
<br />
&quot;Vincenzo, and may I say, bella, you&#39;re really getting my engine going.&quot; He could feel his cock erecting in his pants as the two of them fooled around a bit more on their way out toward the car. He couldn&#39;t wait to get into the backseat and have his first fuck with someone, with Krista. He knew Vinny was far from a virgin, but Keith was, and he desperately desired to make use of this experienced, well muscled body. Damn she could not get enough of him.<br />
<br />
He outright gasped when he felt her feel up his ass, and before long they were stumbling in toward Vinny&#39;s new car. The keys were not behaving tonight, so for at least a little bit the two of them started gyrating and pressing in against one another as they made out against the strong presence of the car. Keith&#39;s shirt came open and she started kissing his pecs next, eager to get in a feel of his masculine physique. Keith had never known anyone to be this into his body.<br />
<br />
And what a body it was. Keith actually had to keep himself from cumming straight away just at the sight of how his body looked during the course of this. Shirt open, pecs and abs on display, a woman feeling him up and making out with him. Oh! Oh she was going lower, at this rate she was going to go down on him. The excitement almost made Keith&#39;s hips pump once. He could feel his boxers were getting a little stickier from precum. For all that Vinny was more experienced, it was obvious that when he got into sex, he really got into it. Keith was just about to get that fucking door open...<br />
<br />
Keith heard a noise, something like someone else approaching. Vinny&#39;s instincts were shouting at him that this was either someone else in a rival mob or just some kind of attacker. The door was open, and Keith turned, looking around as his date got into the car. Confused and obviously expecting things to continue their more amorous track. Keith could hear it, someone walking around the corner. And a pipe being dragged along the floor.<br />
<br />
Keith instinctively grabbed something at his side, taking it for his gun. Vinny&#39;s gun. But when he saw that jock from the bar, Liam, emerge carrying the pipe, obviously enraged and apparently had a bit much to drink on his own time, Keith reacted as fast as he could. If he didn&#39;t respond quickly, who knows what else Liam might do in service to whatever delusion was harbored within his mind. He was not thinking clearly, and could not respect that Krista was not his girl. It was a neurotic possessiveness that would end with someone hurt today.<br />
<br />
Keith reached the &quot;gun&quot; and readied it, &quot;You...made a mistake doing this, man.&quot; Seeing Liam continuing on, driven by rage and drink, Keith answered the threat as he assumed he would need to. He didn&#39;t see Krista behind him, confused and scared by what she was seeing.<br />
<br />
What Keith drew was not the gun he thought he was drawing, but the keys. His mind clouded as it was registered the dangerous powers and capabilities of the keys in the same vein and fashion as the gun Vinny would normally keep at his side. It and &quot;gun&quot; had registered on the same plane. Keith didn&#39;t realize immediately what he was doing, but he pressed a button on the keys and there was a flash of light that illuminated every corner of the street.<br />
<br />
Liam gasped, feeling a distinct, strange sensation that seemed to boil the alcohol out of him in one instant. He stared at Keith for a moment and raised his free hand, watching his hand dissolving into pixels, &quot;What...what did you---? What did you DO to me?&quot; Liam started to dissolve outright into a cloud of pixels, the last words out of his mouth were, &quot;This feels...so fucking weird...&quot; Evidently it didn&#39;t even hurt, it just felt &quot;weird&quot;. Despite all the things Vinny was used to doing, even Keith with that kind of added mindset and immersion felt horrified as he watched Liam dissolve into a cloud of pixels hanging in the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;ve I done?&quot; Keith murmured, and then the pixels all moved at once.<br />
<br />
They swarmed Keith and swirled around him in a flurry, a furious haze of swimming light motes and flashing dots. The storm was silent but seemed to whip the dirt up around Keith&#39;s feet. And Keith could feel something happening. He had been utterly unprepared for what was to come. He had been used to simply being immersed in this fabricated personality and the way it worked with just that fabrication, but now? Now he was feeling something else.<br />
<br />
Liam&#39;s personality seemed to be merging into him even as his body and history did as well, meshing with Keith as he was now. Despite the implications it did not feel even remotely bad. In fact, as it happened, Keith felt distinctly good. His manhood quivered in delight and Keith wondered when it betrayed him by responding so favorably to such a circumstance...<br />
<br />
Keith&#39;s body changed even as his mind started to change as well - if Keith had been muscular before as just Vinny, adding the large and stocky, well muscled Liam to the mix amplified what was already there and made it even more noticeable. While he kept his tone and well proportioned form, Keith&#39;s body bulked up quite a bit, straining his abs a bit as they almost succumbed to the way Liam&#39;s body looked, but preserved the tone to a good degree. Keith moaned as he felt his shoulders bulge with muscle, even as he felt his quads and ass gain size and strength.<br />
<br />
Given Liam had been a fairly whitebread sort of guy, the effect his nationality had on Keith&#39;s body lightened the skin tone, made his hair just slightly lighter in coloration, and his body hair seemed to thin out a bit due to Liam not being quite as hairy. Keith gasped as he felt his face change - hair a bit longer due to Liam&#39;s somewhat longer cut, but still gelled up and styled back. His face a bit younger seeming. Liam had been 21, and being that Keith had been 25 now, the result was a compromise at 23 years old.<br />
<br />
A moan issued from the changed man, and he felt his pants get a bit wet as his boxers absorbed a load fired from a seriously strained manhood. He had no idea that doing something like that could feel so incredibly good...<br />
<br />
By the time it was over, the changed man stood there, unsure about his identity. Keith (?) still remembered the history he had with the mob per Vinny&#39;s story, but now he was apparently fused with Liam, he had also been involved with high school football back in the day. He felt distinctly more Americanized in a sort of way. He could also feel Liam&#39;s distinct mentality starting to mesh with his own. Liam was for whatever reason obsessive about sex and obtaining it. And that was now part of Keith... All of that brashness and instinctive masculine bravado even when he would put himself in danger.<br />
<br />
Fuuuck, Keith thought to himself, I gotta get laid tonight.<br />
<br />
&quot;What...what the hell happened to me?&quot; Keith murmured, his voice now distinctly less accented. He barely paid any attention when he heard Krista running away - apparently seeing the guy who&#39;d been pursuing her before and the guy she went with merge into one had been too much for her.<br />
<br />
Keith took a seat in his Ferrari and chuckled a bit, &quot;Huuh? Wonder what that nerd Alan&#39;s up to back in the room...maybe I should go check on him before trying my luck again.&quot; However Keith now distinctly felt like whatever had happened between him and Liam, it had felt...good. And with his changed mindset incorporating Liam&#39;s more hedonistic edges, he started to contemplate...<br />
<br />
Do I want, Keith thought to himself, grinning a bit, to do that again? What if I like, merge with a girl or something? Well, he figured, it was about time if he couldn&#39;t get laid to try all this kinda stuff out.<br />
<br />
----------------------<br />
<br />
You outright crumble into bed, thinking about how everything went down at the bar. You remember Keith and how easily he pushed off that other guy who would have previously pushed the two of you around. Keith had definitely improved in the course of the change, and you now felt a distinct sense of jealousy. Looking at the mirror in the room, you just see your usual self. Tall but too skinny. Blond but not stunning. Usual. Same. You feel resigned to this...<br />
<br />
But then you remember the keys.<br />
<br />
You remember how good Keith had it due to the keys, and the changes he had gone through. If you could just figure out then how to use the keys to direct your change rather than experience a random one, you could enjoy yourself as much as Keith did. You thought about possibly ending up some sort of muscular jock, or a high powered attorney, or someone in a famous sports team. Was it possible to use this to become like a celebrity or something?<br />
<br />
You found yourself drifting off as you thought about it. Keith had better come here soon. You were looking forward to getting your own change going. Just becoming a bit more stylish wasn&#39;t good enough. You needed a better body. &quot;Alan, the best has yet to come...&quot; You murmured as you drifted off...</p>
