<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Madame Illusia had the full attention of the four 10-year-old boys now. They all showed a very boyish mixture of excitement, embarrassment, and uncertainty. After all, they were naked on a stage in front of a crowd of men, women, boys, and girls of all ages and were, about to undergo another change.<br />
<br />
The Madame turned to the crowd and asked, &quot;Should we bestow our two newest performers with their next change?!&quot; The crowed howled with approval and applause. &quot;Wha...what are you gonna do to them,&quot; Eric asked stepping slightly forward trying to be brave and stand up for his friends. What didn’t help him was the fact that he averted his gaze and looked down at his feet while continuing to cup his little hands in front of his little boyhood making him look as scared and insecure as any 10 year old boy would be under the circumstances… he couldn&#39;t help but act his age after madame changed their minds to math their bodies. “Are they gonna become their inner animals like Riles and me did?” He said briefly forgetting his modesty and moving his hands behind his back and turning to look at his friends he stood in front of.  The crowd chuckled at how cute he was being. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you mean what am I going to do to all of you?&quot; she retorted, &quot;You all will undergo changes. You two,&quot; she then pointed to Riley and Eric, &quot;already know what you will become, but as for you two,&quot; She walked behind the boys now and started to make hand motions get to be surprised this time!&quot;<br />
<br />
 Riley and Eric were surprised when they were suddenly filled with the familiar tingling sensation running through them and they gasped and tensed up. The 10 year olds quickly sprouted the fur over their hairless bodies that they had been covered in only a few minutes before. It spread like wild fire covering them from head to toe in just moments. They were already starting to look like the little lion cubs they had become earlier as their juvenile manes grew on their heads and down their necks and backs forming a bit of a Mohawk on each boy/cub again. Their faces pushed out, eliciting a voice cracking groans that changed into a very lion-ish growls, into muzzles. Falling forward onto their changing arms/forelegs they both lowered their chests and heads to the ground pushed their changing butts as high into the air as they could as their long tasseled tails reasserted themselves. Once that was finished they looked exactly like any normal lion cubs but suddenly both boys turned cubs changed hips bucked forward and back a few times as they felt their boyhoods change species becoming their sheathed and barbed cub-hoods. The newly rechanged lion cubs looked at each other with their bright blue eyes and then over to their friends and the Madame with both worry and excitement for what was to become of their tow other best friends/brothers.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now for you two.” Madame pointed at Jack and Scotty.  She closer her eyes, inhaled, and then started a monologue:<br />
<br />
 “I see your inner totems now and I am impressed with how truly close all four of you boys are. You really are brothers in bond and it is inspiring to know their are young people out there like you gentlemen. And while I may have been a tad aggressive earlier with some of my other victims.... I mean performers. They deserved it. The fact that I have discovered that each one of you would do anything for one another and we’re brave and did not make excuses for your behavior in addition to the crazy fact that clearly ALL four of you, including you two (she pointed at Scotty and Jack) not only yearn to be young again together but also have expressed a desire to be know what it is to be an animal. To feel what it is like to have a tail, fur, and even a sheath.” She said as she pointed at Eric who had been caught giving his cubhood some attention.  This emitted a chuckle from Scotty and Jack and Riley went over and pushed his head and body weight into Eric knocking him onto his side and getting him to look up again.<br />
<br />
 “I am compelled in most situations to fulfill the foolhardy and arrogant desires of people who come up on my stage. It is so rare to have a group like you all. Any perceived cockiness from before I believe was misinterpreted for courage to stand up to someone to protect your friends,” Madame Illusia said while winking at Eric who was know sitting like a strong, regal, Simba out of the lion king movies. <br />
<br />
“So without further ado join your friends, because I know that you will enjoy the forms you are becoming. They are truly your inner animals.”<br />
<br />
She stepped behind Scotty and Jack and made some gentle hand motions, as it was their turn to tingle all over. Their little lithe muscles tensed and relaxed all over their bodies as fur first started to grow from behind where their hands had been blocking visual access of their groins. “Ohh common boys you know, this is still a performance… let us see.” Scotty and Jack looked at each other and both slowly moved their hands to their sides. <br />
<br />
The fur that was growing had grown up their small pulsing ab muscles. Jack’s was blond like the hair on Scotty’s head, while Scotty’s was a dark gold almost brown color that matched Jack’s hair on his head. Both boys suddenly lean forward feeling the urge to push their butts back. “Scot…Scotty it’s this is crazy man, we are changing!” Jack said giddily his young high-pitched voice helping to show his pure excitement. “I… “ Scotty groaned/moaned through the pleasurable, odd sensation he was feeling, “I wonder what we are becoming but I think we are about to sprout our taILs HMPH….” Scotty’s sentence ended with a voice crack that he reacted to with an out of character huff. Both boys looked over their narrow shoulders and down at their young lithe butts/low backs that were flexed harder than they have ever felt after they felt and heard a loud pop. The boys’ tail bones started to extend and cover in wirey fur. They groaned loudly in high pitched voices as their new silky tails grew longer and longer reaching their hairless ankles. <br />
<br />
Their new short silky fur had covered all of their torsos and had started to work its way down their legs and over their arms when they both let out loud involuntary moans that cracked and ended up sounding like a whinny of a young colt horse. <br />
<br />
“Holy **** look at their lil dicks! They are getting bigger. The other guys got smaller they gotta be turning into stallions!” A young woman said from the crowd.  Their boyhoods had stiffened and started growing and morphing. Their young faces reddened with a mix of pleasure and embrassment as their growing shafts inched longer and longer. Their small balls grew to match and were covered in fuzz that became fur. Their colthoods attached to their less furry tummies. The tips bobbing right below their sternums. “J… Jack I think we’re are becoming horSEEEEeeeeIIIIIS” Scotty said like a true 10 year old who’s voice ended started off like a boys impersonation of a horse and ended in a proper whinny of the animal he was becoming.<br />
<br />
The horse boys fell forward onto their hands that had balled up into fists as their hips rearranged themselves and their legs changed to fit a quardropedal stance. After landing in they watched their nails on their hands and feet turn black, fuse together, and grow up to form their new hooves. <br />
<br />
Their bodies started to lengthen and grow in size and they gained new muscles of the athletic colt stallions they were becoming. <br />
<br />
Eric and Riley were finally confident enough to approach their changing friends and started to sniff them. Especially their new… appendages… whiskers and curious wet noses eliciting a shudder from both boy/colts. <br />
<br />
The changes moved to the changing boys’ heads where their hair grew into youthful horse manes while ears started to grow into points and once finished became innervated with all kind of new movements they could perform. <br />
<br />
The only human part of their physical forms were their young faces which started to push out into equine muzzles. As their muzzles grew Jack moaned and said his last human words (for now) calling out to his changing friend,“ScottyYYYYYYYYYYEEEEIIIGH!” The now fully formed colts shook from mane to tail and transformations were complete.<br />
<br />
The group of animals looked together at the audience as they erupted into applause and realized that many them had their phones out and had clearly been capturing all of this. The Madame acknowledged this and said “For once I fully agree with my audience. Let’s get a picture of my first ever successful group of performers.” the Madame said looking to son who quickly  brought a large camera and took 3 or 4 pictures. He turned the camera  came the group changed young men so they could see what they each looked like as a group of animals. In the picture was Riley and Eric, two lion cubs and next to them sat out of breath sweating Scotty and Jack two beautiful strong horse colts. “Look how you all have reciprocal fur colors of each other. Just another example of how close you are to each other.” She pointed to each pair of animals and said, “ they are literally identical except for their yen and yang fur colors! How fascinating!!”<br />
<br />
“Now fellas I mentioned to you have the ability to regress yourselves to 10 years old or any age between your current and 10. You also have the ability to become your animal forms as cubs and colts like you are now and in adult form like you would be at your normal ages and beyond. You can control your animals sides and just grow a tail or mane or… alter your manhoods…” madame Illusia ended with a smirk.  <br />
<br />
Go ahead and try to change back to your human selves now, just imagine yourselves in your original forms.” The four young animals suddenly started to lose hair at an alarming rate and one at a time stood up as their changing musculature allowed them. Stephen managed to get one last picture of the four 19 year olds as they stood their on stage 2 with lion tails and lionhoods and two with horsehoods and long silky tails before they receded back into their now completely normal male bodies. The young men immediately looked at themselves and not caring about their nakedness or situation and full of happiness to be normal again, come together for a group hug. <br />
<br />
Stephen ran back stage and got the boys clothing and returned it to them and they got dressed. Madame Illusia stepped in front of them and said in a quiet voice but still loud enough for the audience to hear, “You are all free to go as you please, enjoy many adventures with this gift I have just given you. You four are a proud bunch.”<br />
<br />
Thank you Madam Illusia for our gifts Eric said as he looked back at his friends and then reached a hand out to shake the Madame’s. Each boy followed suit and thanked her and then started to move toward the side of the stage to leave. But they suddenly stopped when Riley whispered something and smiled at his brothers. The boys smiled and laughed and then looked like they closed their eyes to focus on something… <br />
<br />
The boys let out a chorus of groans mixed with moans as bulges formed in the back of their shorts and started to grow while the hair on their heads lengthened/changed texture. Within moments they each reached back and pulled their shorts and boxers down to reveal the top of their now mature muscular butts to reveal their tails had reasserted themselves once more and shook their heads complete with lovely mature lion/horse manes. <br />
<br />
The crowed erupted in applause one last time as the boys pointed to the crowd and waggled their tails one more and left the tent to go on their next adventure. <br />
<br />
| what’s next for the boys? |<br />
| what’s next for the madame and her audience? |<br />
<br />
YOU DECIDE :D</p>
