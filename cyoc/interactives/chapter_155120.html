<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan walked into the ‘Magic Store’ curiously as he looked at the strange product, then, one caught his eye, ‘Wishing Stone’ and for only fifty pence. Ryan grabbed it payed for it and left. Once Ryan had arrived home, he ran up to his room and locked the door, The stone came with some instructions, “Three wishes, cannot kill” Ryan shrugged, “For my first wish, I wish that all my clothes were all replaced with female ones and nobody found it strange that I wore them”. After Ryan had stopped talking, there was a bright flash of light in his room and when it faded, his clothes were different.<br />
<br />
He was wearing a sports bra and a jacket, along with a pair of yoga pants. Ryan grinned and was about to try on his other clothes when his mom called him down for dinner, when he arrived in the kitchen, no one asked any questions about what he was wearing, they didn’t even spare it a glance. They all just ate their food with a few conversations and Ryan went back up to his room, he locked the door once again and opened his wardrobe, he was amazed by all the clothes, The tuxedo he had worn to his aunts wedding had been replaced with a flower girls dress. His blue swimming  trunks he wore in Portugal was now a pink one piece bikini and his school uniform was now the female option, Ryan looked at himself in the mirror and made another wish, “I wish that my whole body was shaved, except for my head, also I can go to the bathroom wherever, whenever, I could go to the boys, the girls or even in my underwear and no one would find this strange, also if I did mess or wet myself it would not leak or give me a rash as nobody would be able to smell it” After this next wish was done he glanced at his clock 10:00 he had spend hours looking at clothing, Ryan took of his clothes and grabbed a pink nightie and fell asleep.<br />
<br />
Ryan was awoken the next morning by his mother, who was telling him to get ready for school. Ryan got up and grabbed a pie of white panties with pink hearts on them and a matching bra, then he grabbed his uniform, a white buttoned blouse, a black skirt and tights, a red tie and a black cardigan, He then grabbed some strapped shoes and continued to get ready. <br />
<br />
Once Ryan was at school he wandered about he still had one wish left. His thinking was cut short by the bell ringing, signifying the first class, every class was uneventful except for the last class, French, Ryan hated French and never really payed attention, “May I go to the bathroom, miss?” Ryan asked politely, the teacher waved her hand a continued with the lesson, Ryan walked towards the woman’s bathroom because he was allowed to.<br />
<br />
No one was in the bathroom luckily, Ryan entered one of the stalls and sat down on the toilet, he was about to pull down his tights but the decided against it. Ryan left the cubical, made sure no one was coming and squatted down in the middle of the room, Ryan scrunched up his face a released a stream of both pee and poop into his panties. Once Ryan was done, he stood up and walked back towards class, he arrived back to the class and sat down, causing the poop to squish against his butt. Then after what seemed like hours the class had ended and everyone left. <br />
<br />
Ryan entered his mom’s car and sat in the back, They didn’t talk all that much and after a few minutes they were home, Ryan had one more wish left, so he had to make it a good one. “I wish that I was also allowed to wear diapers as well as panties, also I wish that I didn’t have to do French and I went to the boardroom and played computer games, also my parents are the only ones that can change my diapers, but I can change that rule whenever I want” Once the wish was done the stone disappeared from Ryan’s hand, Ryan walked back into his room, took of the panties and threw them in the trash, he then wiped any excess of his butt with tissues and threw them into the trash as well, there was a gentle knock on the door, “Sweetie, do you need me to put a diaper on you?” “Yes” you sighed, your mom walked into your room and grabbed a diaper and taped it on you, she looked at it thoughtfully before putting a second diaper over it, “Why’d you put two on?” Ryan asked incredulously, “Don’t you remember, It’s aunt Fiona’s wedding today, we don’t want you leaking all over your dress”, He was about to point out that you couldn’t leak, but decided against it, “Now, put on your dress, we’re leaving in an hour.<br />
<br />
Ryan took off  all of his clothes, leaving him only wearing a diaper, he grabbed a white, sequinned bra and put it on, he then grabbed the dress and pulled it over his head, he fixed it around a bit before putting on the white heels. “Ryan, are you dressed?” His mom asked from downstairs, “Yeah” He answered back, “Come down here so I can do your makeup” Ryan walked down the stairs, whenever he wished for the female clothes, he must have just instantly learned how to walk in heels.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Once he had all his makeup on they got into the car and left for the wedding, the wedding was pretty boring except that Ryan did poop in his diaper a couple times without telling anyone.</p>
