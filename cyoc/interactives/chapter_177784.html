<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Here goes nothing...&quot; Terry said, quietly as he raised the camera and hoped for the best. <br />
<br />
[FLASH]<br />
<br />
Marco grunted, feeling a somewhat familiar feeling of vertigo, like he was just shaken out of a dream and now everything seemed too new. But he still felt a large weight holding his chest down, and rather thickened thighs that pressed together, as though nothing had changed. &quot;Fu-God, did it... Did it work?&quot; He groaned, before freezing up as he heard the deep smoothness his voice now belted out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-What happened to me?&quot; Marco huffed, realizing he was seemingly towering above the world than previously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy-&quot; Terry gaped, as Kelly raised her eyebrows in shock, a hand flying up to her cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, c&#39;mon, say something you guys.&quot; Marco floundered, throwing his meaty hands and patting his chest, groping the mounds in front of him. Kelly snapped out of her stupor and immediately pulled a compact from her bag. <br />
<br />
&quot;You might want to see for yourself, Marco.&quot; She noted, gulping audibly as Terry refused to take his eyes off from looking up to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I&#39;m some kind of white nerd I&#39;m gonna-&quot; Marco began, pulling the compact mirror to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit. I&#39;m OLD.&quot; He nearly shouted, realizing the change in front of him. <br />
<br />
Facing Marco was a handsome man in the compact mirror, chiseled chin and a well maintained beard with dark brunette hair that was cut into a slightly messy short cut, almost buzzed. He still retained his tanned skin, but this tan had perfectly captured the physique and aesthetic of his body. His eyes were slightly dark, but they held experience, and as he pouted, Marco noted how almost picturesque he looked.<br />
<br />
&quot;More like fuckin&#39; huge too, dude, you&#39;re absolutely JACKED.&quot; Terry spoke up, Marco tilted the mirror to his barrel chest and mused.<br />
<br />
His chest was massive, the crimson silk dress shirt was stretched to its limits as the bull neck threatened to tear the tie he had on. He was decently hair, and had no shirt underneath, but as he reviewed his new change, Marco could feel himself heat up as he took more time to admire himself in the tiny mirror. He could barely fit in the frame, fuck. Sure the previous change was rather hot, but this, man- He was absolutely yoked, he made a duck face and winked, unbuttoning the sleeves of his bulky arms and feeling raw strength in them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look at me, dudes, I&#39;m so-&quot; He closed the compact and put it in his pocket. He looked down to the fitted black slacks and expensive leather shoes and proceeded to pull up the sleeves. <br />
<br />
&quot;Cool...&quot; Terry stammered, as Marco proceeded to flex a double biceps pose, Marco chuckled, reveling in how tight the dress clothes were, how handsome he was, how Terry was drinking him in like a thirsty cheerleader... it was like the perfect jackpot hit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, I think I can get used to this...&quot; Marco growled, continuing to flex, before snarling and pounding a heavy fist onto pecs and roaring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sheesh, is it just me, or is the testosterone a little <I>thick</I> here?&quot; Kelly replied, making a mocking gesture or clearing the air. <br />
<br />
Marco licked his lips, feeling more drunk as he felt power coursing in his body. He could barely put his arms down without the width of his muscles forcing them apart, much less his legs being so bulky that he could feel just how tight his underwear was between his hairy thighs. And speaking of packages... He didn&#39;t need to imagine with how necessary it was to shift his balance so as to be more comfortable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bro, I wanna nut check you so bad.&quot; Terry guffawed, Marco flitted his eyes seductively as he was finding himself enwrapped in the strange feeling Terry was giving him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh... Yeah...&quot; He caught himself,<br />
&quot;Um, ahem, this uh... This isn&#39;t right. We gotta like, do <I>something</I>... Right?&quot; He continued. <br />
<br />
Absentmindedly, Marco reached into his dress shirt and scratched his hirsute muscles, restraining himself from groaning as he felt a sensitive nipple. He hissed, before pulling out and loosening the tie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Obviously, we can&#39;t let people see you like this, you look like a beefed up version of a teacher.&quot; Kelly sighed, petting her hair in trying to figure out a solution. Marco unbuttoned the top most button, took a deeper breath to unclog his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we can&#39;t just take another picture of you when we don&#39;t even know if it can turn you into... Well... Something else.&quot; Terry agreed. <br />
He was still marveling at Marco&#39;s new found brawn, and Marco could feel his cheeks heat up slightly at the new attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well uh, how about we-&quot; Marco said.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are!&quot; A voice rang out. The three snapped their heads to a familiar beautiful teacher strutting towards them, Terry immediately putting the camera behind his back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Kelly, Terry.&quot; Mrs. Hudson spoke, smiling earnestly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, hi... Mrs. Hudson,&quot; Terry sheepishly responded, twisting to hide the camera more effectively as Kelly came closer to him in an attempt to shield the item.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you two for so generously volunteering to help me find my gorgeous hubby, sometimes I swear you just disappear on me so I can exercise finding you, darling!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marco looked at her, confused and unaware, before Kelly piped up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh, <I>Mr. Hudson</I> is helping us with...&quot; She said.<br />
&quot;...Photography for the yearbook!&quot; Terry completed her sentence.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Hudson looked at the two, before smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;How wonderful...! I always knew you couldn&#39;t help but pitch in with these kids, Marcus. Just reminds me I&#39;m the luckiest woman in the world,&quot; She sighed, coming closer to Marco.<br />
He braced himself, breathing in and holding his breath as he tried to fake a smile. Luckily, even in his anxiety, Marco framed his smile perfectly, the pearly whites dazzling and twinkling as Mrs. Hudson proceeded to crease his shirt collar, before gently adjusting his tie.<br />
<br />
&quot;And really, dear, you ought to learn to button up. We can&#39;t have the history and gym teacher to be fired over indecency, right?&quot; She said, slyly winking at Marco as she proceeded to button up the uppermost button.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha... Not in front of the kids, &#39;Liv.&quot; Marco said, cooly, though internally he was screaming at this beautiful woman, who he did not really know beyond his teacher, casually flirting with him as her husband. <br />
And even more concerning, was his conflicting feelings, on one hand he can feel himself melt into her touch naturally, but he also can still feel his... &quot;weird&quot; feeling towards Terry building up yet again.<br />
<br />
&quot;My mistake,&quot; Mrs. Hudson nodded. &quot;I&#39;ll be waiting for you at home, handsome. Kids? Make sure he comes back in one piece, last time I had to tear him from the school weight room.&quot; She rolled her eyes, strutting down towards the parking lot.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know you love it!&quot; Marco felt himself say automatically, even though he was finding his mouth and hands clammy. Mrs. Hudson raised a hand, she knew, and now Terry and Kelly did too.<br />
<br />
As soon as she took a turn where they could not further see her, Marco immediately burst into anxiety.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, Terry, man you GOT to change me, I can&#39;t be married to Olivia!&quot; He caught himself once again.<br />
&quot;I mean, Mrs. Hudson!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Terry and Kelly sighed a breath of relief, before focusing on the towering man in front of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can say that again,&quot; Kelly replied.<br />
&quot;Terry, we can&#39;t leave him like this.&quot; She continued.<br />
<br />
Terry pulled out the camera and stared at it. Marco was Mr. Hudson in this version of reality, just before he was a bombshell of a teacher, now he was a veritable muscle man that he dreamed of on the movie screen. But just before all this Marco was... Marco, a guy he loved hanging with and... Well... <br />
<br />
Terry looked at Kelly, at Marco, and then back at the camera.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when...</p>
