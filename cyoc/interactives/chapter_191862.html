<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The room was slightly cold, but not uncomfortably so. Just enough to remind Tony every moment that he was stark naked. Zig-zagging to avoid the mess of toys across the floor, he made his way to the walk-in-closet and opened the doors. Inside hung at least a hundred different outfits. Some fit for a boy his age, but most were incredibly inappropriate. Costumes, revealing outfits, girl&#39;s clothes, and even ones that consisted of leathers and chains that he wouldn&#39;t even have called clothes. Why did he have all this? Had his parents bought them for him? No, surely not. Why would they get him a school girl outfit? They knew he was a boy. Then, had one of the servants arranged this? That didn&#39;t make sense either. Clearly there had been a mix-up. It was a mystery for another day. Right now he had to hurry and get dressed, or someone would come in and see him naked... Or would they?<br />
<br />
Tony hesitated. No one would be awake but him this early. Why was he so scared? It felt so good to be naked. It was naughty and so shameful and... fun. He glanced at his reflection in the full length mirror at the end of the closet to see his young body on full display. Dark, short hair on his head and none anywhere else. He blushed and looked away almost immediately. Just being seen by himself made his knees feel weak. Adrenalin rushed through his system as the possibilities and fantasies filled his mind.<br />
<br />
Biting his lip, Tony tip-toed over to his bedroom door, still nude. Not daring to even breath, he opened the door a crack and looked out. His bedroom was on the second floor and opened up onto an indoor balcony surrounding the large entrance hall. All was quiet out there. It was a little dark, but the defuse predawn light streaming in through the fog and the tall windows of the hall gave just enough light to see by, yet left the vast mansion feeling spooky and mysterious.<br />
<br />
Tony forced himself to take a breath, then, before he could chicken out, he quickly darted out onto the indoor balcony, closed the door behind him and counted to ten. One. Two... He lost his nerves before even reaching three, and darted back into his bedroom. He ran and flung himself into his bed, hugging one of the giant teddies and rolling around with his blushing face buried in its fur and letting out a muffled scream that was half panic, half exhilarated excitement. That had turned him on far more than he knew it could. Not that the innocent boy that Alex had turned him into even knew what turned on meant. He just knew he loved it, and it made his nether parts tingle in a very good way. He needed more. He was hooked.<br />
<br />
After calming down slightly, at least enough to get a grip of himself, he went to try again. This time, he had to make it all the way down the stairs before he could turn back. Even if someone came in and discovered him, he had to let his toes touch the first floor before he was allowed to return to his room and hide. At least that&#39;s what he told himself. God, his hands were trembling, and he hadn&#39;t even left his room again yet.<br />
<br />
His fingers grabbed the doorknob. On three. One. Two. Three... He still stood petrified holding the closed door. It was just like when he had tried to jump from the three meter high diving board and his legs refused to move. Only this was way more terrifying. Come on! He had to do this. No one would see him. One. Two. Three! He pulled open the door and staggered out. So far so good. Now he just had to make it past Alex&#39;s room to get to the stairs. His big brother&#39;s door loomed like some towering monster he had to somehow get past. Inside, his brother was fast asleep he knew. His strong and brave and wonderful big brother.<br />
<br />
Tony moved slowly, stepping every so lightly along the carpeted balcony. The floarboards creaked underneath him when he was right outside Alex&#39;s door, and Tony&#39;s heart nearly leapt out of his throat. What if his brother thought he was a burglar and came out to capture him, and couldn&#39;t see it was Tony because of the poor light, and tied him up and began to punish him, and... Tony&#39;s overactive imagination was running wild. He drew in short sharp breaths, feeling dizzy. What if Alex slept naked like he had? An insatiable urge gripped the young boy. He had to see. He peeked in through the key hole, but the angle was wrong. He could just spot the edge of his brother&#39;s bed. Could he see his brother? Just a tiny bit? Was that an arm or just a pillow? Damn, he needed to see. His hand reached for the doornob, then froze. What was he doing!? He couldn&#39;t sneak into his brother&#39;s room naked and spy on Alex. He&#39;d be caught and then Alex would punish him and... Tony&#39;s weak knees buckled for a second and he stumbled back and grabbed the railing behind him with a thump. Had that woken Alex!? He waited with bated breath. Nothing. He let out a sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
Forcing down that overwhelming desire for now, Tony continued his mission. Get down the stairs. Step by terrifying step, he descended. Every creak of wood, every wayward fantasy, every involuntary gasp filled his mind with paranoia and hesitation. It took him at least three minutes to make his way down the stairs. His bare feet rested on the stone flooring. He&#39;d done it. He could return to his room now. But... Did he want to end the game already? He&#39;d already gotten this far, and the worst part, sneaking past Alex&#39;s room was behind him. He didn&#39;t know if he&#39;d have the nerves to go through that again.<br />
<br />
Walking with stiff legs, like a robot, he got to the center of the grand entrance hall and could see further down the main hallway. So many rooms. Such a vast mansion. There was still so much to go to naked. If he got to the other side of the building, it would literally take him over a full minute running on his little legs to make it back to his room. That is, if he didn&#39;t get lost first. It was strange. Even though he knew he&#39;d grown up here, it all felt so new to him. As if this was the first time he&#39;d actually explored this huge places. He really did feel like he could get lost. Maybe that was just his mind playing tricks on him. He just wasn&#39;t used to seeing it without the lights on or the sun properly shining... or while not naked. Yeah, it was all in his head. But where to next?</p>
