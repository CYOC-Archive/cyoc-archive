<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">'When i wore it, i willed things to happen and they did…... Most of the time.  I could effect everything around me, but I could never will changes to myself. If I had been able to, i would have totally given myself a body like this.' She said.<br />
<br />
 'Do you have a mirror?' She asked<br />
<br />
'You mean you didn't look like that when you were young?' I asked her, skipping over her mirror question.<br />
<br />
She smiled. 'oh the'res one,' she said, as she walked over to the mirror in the corner of my office. <br />
That wasn't there before, i thought to myself.<br />
<br />
 'No, Not like this.' She said as She examined her butt in the mirror.<br />
She shot me a smile and said,  'lets just say...... i was a little heavier.' <br />
She turned around and ran her hands over her thin body and smooth thin thighs.<br />
<br />
At that moment her body began to fatten, her fingers sank slightly into her softening midsection.<br />
<br />
'No! no! no!' She said panicking. She pushed at her waist trying to stop the bulge forming.<br />
 <br />
She looked at me with daggers in her eyes. 'What did you do!?' she hissed.<br />
<br />
‘I, I, don’t know.’ I stuttered.  ‘I didn’t do anything.<br />
<br />
She looked at herself, if the mirror again. It was obvious this time that she didn't like what she saw.<br />
<br />
The damage wasn't too bad, She didn't gain too much weight. She Just wasn't what you would call thin.<br />
<br />
She looked like she was going to freak out on me. <br />
Then all of a sudden her expression changed, as if a light bulb had turned on over her head.<br />
<br />
I wasn’t sure what to say under the circumstances, so I apologized weakly.<br />
‘I’m so sorry I don’t know how I’m doing this…’ I started to say.<br />
<br />
<br />
'He really didn't know how he was doing this.' She thought to herself.<br />
Then it clicked.  <br />
He was doing it on a subconscious level.<br />
He didn't increase her weight on purpose.<br />
 She had done it. She had put the idea in his head.<br />
She would have to be very careful in choosing her words around him.<br />
<br />
Saying the wrong thing could be disastrous, she thought as she looked down at her less than desirable body.<br />
<br />
'Its OK' She lied to calm him. 'this morning i was an old lady. Now i'm young. thats good enough for me.'<br />
That seemed to ease his guilt a little. Now it was time to try something.<br />
<br />
'I mean can you believe, i was old enough to be your grandmother this morning?' she said with a smile<br />
SHOW TIME!<br />
'Look at me Now!  The ID in my wallet Says I'm 21.' She lied.  <br />
She waited a couple seconds and something started to happen and it did on Que.<br />
<br />
She could feel her skin tightening all over her body. Her hair grew longer till it reached her mid back, all of the remaining wrinkles she had disappeared, and her breasts and butt lifted slightly.  <br />
She lost a little weight but not as much as she had gained a minute ago.<br />
Memories of getting drunk to celebrate her 21st birthday filled her head.<br />
She quickly pulled out her wallet and confirmed what she already knew.  <br />
It showed a picture of a fresh faced 21 year old. <br />
'YES!!' She thought to herself, It worked.  Whens she had checked her id on the elevator it showed her age as 32.<br />
She gave a quick glance at her young but still fat body in the mirror.<br />
Time for PHASE 2. She thought to herself as She smiled evilly.<br />
 'My whole life has changed now.' <br />
'i used to be a chartered accountant, now i'm a yoga instructor and a part time model.' She told him.<br />
She smiled and bit her lip. She could feel her body shifting, this time more extreme than last time.<br />
Her bra began to fill up as her breasts increased in size slightly. <br />
They lifted higher on her chest. (As high as natural breasts of their size possibly could) <br />
Her body thinned as all of her gained weight and then some, melted off her body.<br />
 <br />
Her thin body had returned but with a many improvements. <br />
Her waist was even smaller and her butt was tighter rounder, her legs seemed longer too, and her curves were now much more defined.<br />
<br />
Her eyes rolled back in her head as memories of yoga techniques, diets, modeling poses, everything relating to those things to that began to fill her head. Even a few sexual positions that she had never ever thought about also inserted into her memory.<br />
<br />
It was intoxicating, She didn't want to stop! So she didn't.<br />
<br />
'No More old person rest home for me. I have a top floor apartment with no mortgage overlooking the park.' She continued.<br />
 A memory of her address and paying for it in cash inserted itself into her brain.<br />
<br />
She wanted to keep going, but she had to stop now or she wouldn't be able too.  <br />
'She could get more later.' She convinced herself.<br />
<br />
She had been so involved with herself she hadn't realized he had been watching every detail.<br />
He was staring at the cleavage of her enhanced chest, sticking out of her overly tight lulu lemon hoodie.<br />
She smiled as she spotted the drool on the side of his mouth.<br />
'Would you like a closer look?' She asked him.<br />
She pulled the zipper down till it fully opened, revealing a tiny fashionable but not very functional sports bra. <br />
<br />
Then She moved in close so that her chest was touching his and whispered 'My eyes are up here.'  <br />
<br />
He tilted his head up and She was almost surprised as he was that they were looking at each other eye to eye. <br />
He 'WAS' slightly taller than her, but now then were the same height. Her height had also been enhanced.<br />
<br />
'So how about that lunch?'  She asked him as she zipped back up.<br />
<br />
'umm uh,' he stuttered. 'where would you like to go?'</p>
