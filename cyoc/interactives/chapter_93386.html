<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam woke up feeling a some wetness around him. He reached his hand under his covers to discover that his goodnite was extremely wet and had even leaked. Sam got out of his wet bed and the goodnites immediately fell to the floor. He stepped out of them and walked over to the door. Before he could reach the door it opened and Hannah came in the room. She saw sam standing their in front of the soaked goodnite with no clothes on. She said &quot;Aw, look how cute you are, lets get you in a fresh pull up.&quot;<br />
 Hannah went over to the dresser and opened it pulling out a bag of pull up training pants saying &quot;You are about 4 now so I think it would be best if you wear one of these, I will give you a chance to prove that you can still make it to the potty.&quot;<br />
 She pulled out one of the pull ups from the package, it had cars from Disney on it, and held them out for sam to step into. He stood in the pull ups as she pulled them up to his waist saying that He didn&#39;t need any other clothes while home, because she wanted to be able to see if he had any accidents. before he knew what was happening Hannah picked sam up with her hand under his butt, and carried him out into the kitchen. Sam was taken over to a booster seat that was now at the table and placed in it. Hannah went and got him a bowl of cheerios with a big plastic spoon. She also got him a sippy cup full of orange juice and placed it next to the bowl of cereal. Before he could even pick up the spoon his vision was blocked out for a second while Sally put a bib over his head and around my neck. He sat their mortified by all that was happening to him. He took some cereal and tried to eat it but either the spoon was too big or his coordination was gone because cereal and milk kept ending up on the bib. He hated drinking from the sippy cup, but he was so thirsty so he did anyway. When he was done with everything he asked if he could be let out of the chair because he had to go to the bathroom. Hannah lifted him out of the chair and placed him feet flat on the tile floor of the kitchen. She told him to wait right there. She left the kitchen and came back with a plastic potty chair. While Hannah was gone Sam dribbled a little bit into the training pants. He felt some pee just kind of come out, it wasn&#39;t a lot though. Hannah pulled down his pull ups and sat him on the potty chair. Sam sat their for a little bit and without really feeling it he began to pee in the potty. When he stopped peeing Hannah told him what a good boy he was and pulled him off the potty and then pulled his pull ups up to his waist. She told him that he could go watch some TV in the living room while she cleaned out the potty chair. While he was sitting in a slightly damp pull up. he kept feeling himself dribble pee into the pull up, but their was nothing he could do to really stop it. After a while of watching cartoon the pull up felt pretty wet. He looked and could see that the car design on the front looked pretty faded, indicating that the pull up had been used. Hannah came in a little bit later with a fresh pull up and the plastic potty. She set the potty on the floor and said that its okay that he wet his pull up, little boys tend to dribble without knowing. She had him stand up and pulled off his damp pull up and told him to sit on the potty for a little bit. When he was finished Hannah put a fresh pair of pull ups on him and told him that he would be going to daycare today with Jane.<br />
<br />
Later they all got in the car and drove in silence to the daycare center. It was a small building. But looked big enough to take care of about twenty children.<br />
<br />
 Jane, Hannah and Sam got out of the car . Hannah took them by hand and led them up the walkway to the front door. Jane rang the doorbell and a few moments later the owner opened the door. She took Jane from Hannah and then Hannah proceeded to tell the owner (Sherry) that she wanted her to watch Sam for the day as well. Sherry herself was a very friendly looking lady. She looked to be around 30 and had the body of a burlesque dancer. She was extremely busty and curvaceous with long brown hair that fell to her lower back. Perhaps not the classic daycare owner but certainly passable.<br />
<br />
Hannah told her about how Sam wasn&#39;t potty trained and how he was still being breast fed. She then handed Sherry the diaper bag that she packed saying their were diapers in the bag for Sam. When Hannah left Sherry took Sam inside the house. Sam followed Sherry into her living room. Some kids ranging from 3-5 were sitting around the TV watching cartoons. The room had 2 long couches on either side, a recliner chair, a little kid play table, and some little plastic chairs around the table. Sam walked in the room and sat on the couch just thinking he could get away with watching TV and being left alone for the time that he was there.<br />
After a little while of watching TV a teenage girl came around checking all the kids that had diapers. She would feel the front of kids diapers and then peek in the back. While she was going around she came over to Sam and asked if he wore pull ups or a diaper. He responded kind of nervous &quot;no&quot;, but she didn&#39;t seem to believe him and put her hand on his bottom and squeezing saying it felt like he had one on. She undid the straps on his overalls and pulled them off leaving him in just a white T-shirt and a pull up. She felt the front of the diaper giving it a squeeze saying that it didn&#39;t feel too wet and then leaned in and looked down the back of it saying he didn&#39;t have any poopies. She asked him if he needed to go potty. He told her no even though he did have to pee a little bit, but didn&#39;t want to have to sit on a potty chair in front of everyone. She said okay and put his cargo overalls back on. His diaper was a little wet from the dribbling he kept doing in them, but was not soaked, only a little damp. The girl took the kids that needed a change or to go potty one at a time to either change them or sit them on the potty. After about 20 minutes he felt himself peeing in his diaper a lot without really trying. The diaper now felt very warm and heavy. He looked down at my crouch and could see that it looked puffy around his crouch under the overalls. He just sat there for awhile assuming the caretaker or the girl would not be around to check pull ups and diapers for awhile. Some of the kids who got bored of TV where playing on the rug with some toys that were there. He didn&#39;t want to get up because he knew that his diaper would sag too much and look obvious that he wet himself.<br />
<br />
 The kid that was sitting next to him on the couch left to play on the floor so he had room to lay sideways on the couch propping his head up with his hand watching the TV wishing he could go home. He kept feeling the front of the pull up with his hand while watching TV, it felt neat to have it squishing around. He wasn&#39;t too fond of the damp feeling the diaper had as the pee became cold and around his wee wee felt clammy. Sherry came around and asked who wanted some juice. He was so thirsty he asked for some.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Oh no, mister you don&#39;t get juice, you get mommy milk.&quot; Sherry said as she produced one of her k cup breasts. Sam&#39;s head was pushed into it. He didn&#39;t want to but naturally his mouth just latched on her large nipple as he started to drink. The taste was sweet, pleasant in fact and since he was a kid he decided he might as well enjoy the ride and thus drank hungrily. Sherry then put him down and left to give the other children their juice <br />
<br />
 After 30 minutes the milk had made its way through him and he felt himself peeing into the already full diaper. The diaper couldn&#39;t hold the pee and he felt pee trickling down his legs . He inspected the overalls and found that the pee showed all down his legs and wet spots could be seen easily on the edge of his crotch and bottom. When the teenage girl was coming around to collect all the cups and sippy cups from the kids she saw his current state. She took hin by the hand and led him into the kitchen where Sherry was making lunch for all the kids. Sherry told the girl to clean him up and put his overalls in the washer machine. He was taken over to another room by the girl. He asked the girl what her name was; trying to pay it off that he was actually some dumb toddler who didn&#39;t know any better. She told him her name was Sarah and asked me what mine was. He told her his name while she pulled him into a room with a changing table and a lot of changing supplies. The girl took off his overalls to reveal his saggy diaper which was barely still on his waist. She ripped the sides of the pull up to have it *plonk* to the floor. He stood there with his little boyhood exposed to Sarah. She didn&#39;t seem to mind the least bit. She placed her hands under his hairless armpits and lifted him up onto the changing table. She pushed his chest with one hand and forced him to lay on his back. She grabbed some baby wipes. She then grasped his ankles and pulled them up to his chest so she could wipe down his privates. He felt so vulnerable to have this girl wiping him down with a wet wipe. When she was done she took out a pull up from the bag hannah left Sherry. She threaded his feet into the leg whole of the diaper and pulled them up to his knees. She then took him by the armpits and stood him flat on the floor. She grasped the sides of the diaper and pulled them firmly up his waist. Sarah told him that he could go back and play. She said that when his pants were finished being washed he could wear them again, but for now what he had on would do.<br />
<br />
 He walked out into the living room not wanting to draw too much attention to the fact that he didn&#39;t have any pants on. Only one other kid had his diapers in plain site and he looked to be only 2. He went back to his spot on the couch to see that their was a wet spot where he had been sitting. He sat on the other side of the couch and tried to not draw attention to himself. Sarah came in with some cleaning supplies and cleaned up the wet spot on the couch. This drew the attention of all the kids in the room. Everyone was looking at Sarah cleaning the spot and clearly saw that Sam no longer had any pants on. One of the kids asked why she was cleaning the spot, Sarah plainly said that Sammie had a little accident and she was just cleaning it up. When she was done she walked out of the room to put the cleaning supplies back. She came back moments later and did another diaper check, she didn&#39;t bother even checking Sam&#39;s diaper. She just asked if he needed to go to the potty. He actually did have to go. He felt a cramp in my stomach that told me he needed to go number 2. She took me to the bathroom and placed a potty chair on the toilet, it made it so he could sit on the big person potty, and it had a splash protector. Sarah stripped off my pull ups and sat him on the training seat and put a stool under his feet. Sarah stood in the doorway and watched him. He still was not quite use to being naked in front of people, never mind going the bathroom in front of them. It took him a little bit, but he must have really had to go because he didn&#39;t really have to push it out, it just kinda came out. He peed a little too. When he was done Sarah asked me if he was all set. He told her he was, so she got some wet wipes and had him lean forward so she could clean his bum. It was a weird feeling to have someone else wipe his butt. He had his head pushed into her chest while she was leaned over my back pulling him forward so she could get to his bottom. When she was done wiping him she took him off the potty and pulled the diaper back up. He went back into the living room while Sarah got everyone else who needed to go to the bathroom handled.<br />
<br />
 Sherry called for all the kids to come into the kitchen for some lunch. Everyone got up and went to the kitchen. She let the big kids take their food to the living room while she got the younger ones (Sam) in booster seats and high chairs around the table. She made us mac and cheese with some hot dogs cut up in it. Sam had a bib tied around his neck and so did a lot of the younger kids. He was also given a sippy cup with apple juice in it. He drank and ate his meal. <br />
 When everyone was done she told us that it was nap time for the little kids. She made the big kids go outside and play while she set up mats in the living room. She told them that 2 people could have the couch while the other 4 could sleep on the mats. She told them that she would be right back with pillows and blankets, saying she had to first put the babies to sleep in the nursery. Sam picked the couch that he had been sitting on for most of the day. Sherry came back with some blankets and pillows handing them all a pillow and a light blanket. Before they could go to sleep her and Sarah went around and took off all of their clothes except diapers,pull ups, and undies. Sam only had to have his shirt removed. He laid down on the couch, The shades were shut and the lights were turned off. He closed his eyes and went to sleep.<br />
<br />
 Sam woke up to the sounds of kids playing outside. He looked around and noticed that everyone else was gone, probably outside now playing. Sherry came in about 5 minutes later and saw that he was awake. She put his T-Shirt on saying that he could play outside with the rest of the kids till his mom came to pick him up.He went outside and saw that some of the kids were playing tag while others were drawing with chalk on the driveway. He decided to just sit in the shade on the porch. He sat there for only about 30 minutes before hannah pulled up. Hannah came up to him asking what happened to his overalls. He told her that he had an accident, and she just smiled saying it&#39;s okay. Sherry gave Jane the overalls that were now clean as well as her diaper bag. <br />
<br />
They all drove home and went inside, Jane checked the time. 6 o&#39;clock, past Sam&#39;s bedtime. She picked him up and took him to his bedroom where she sat down on the rocking chair and for the second time that day Sam was breastfed. Sam had preferred, Sherry&#39;s milk as there was more of it but he was game for Hannah. She then put him down to bed in a fresh diaper and onesie.<br />
<br />
He was then put to bed and as Hannah walked out she said I wish...</p>
