<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(AN: This'll be the last mega post I do for this story and I hope that we can finish this in a <br />
few posts now before Christmas and failing that the new year. Please.) <br />
<br />
Humans who lines had ended centuries ago of course could also not become Leomans thus <br />
logically their ancestors couldn't either. This WOULD create the natural side effect of <br />
humans being a declining species in the history books as the Leoman cascade continued to <br />
spread.  But it also meant people like the witches who had no living heirs, could not hope <br />
to change.  <br />
<br />
'And it wouldn't do much good anyway,' Thought Marie-Eliza, 'The witches were insane... <br />
no genetic disposition would have changed the behavior of a set of lunatics.' <br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza sensed all uses of the game, and all that were linked to the game. All the <br />
power the witches had possessed were condensed into her. 'Or were they possessed by <br />
their power?' Marie-Eliza wondered. <br />
<br />
The little lupman witchling felt a doctor in a hospital use the game, phrasing it in such a <br />
way that he was able to receive the turn back. <br />
<br />
Years ago, the doctor, ignorant of the five person limit, attempted to use the PA system to <br />
Transform all into perfect health and to Dare them to live happy lives. The turn had been <br />
wasted and found someone with an intense grudge to nurse. The first time the game had <br />
been used on the doctor had been to stand aside for a procedure he had refused to do. <br />
The next time had been a near disaster with him openly seeking a turn, and like most <br />
nearly ended up someone's slave. A anarchist had tried to use the same trick the doctor <br />
had tried to use to make everyone in the hospital to never vote. By sheer random luck this <br />
waste turn then fell into the doctor's hands having been quite angry at the time at the <br />
middle-aged anarchist's attempt. Instead of using the turn for punishment he just scared <br />
the anarchists witless by some vague convoluted threats and the anarchist had fled the <br />
hospital. <br />
<br />
Now the doctor used the game one person at a time, those who could still speak of course <br />
or give an answer (making it useless for coma patients) and the doctor tried to keep his use <br />
of the game unknown knowing the stigma people towards some who used the game. The <br />
doctor sadly had no concern for those who they used the turn AFTER they left the hospital. <br />
While most DID see it as a near death experience, there were a few who had other thoughts <br />
on their minds after being discharged from the hospital: greed, revenge, and satisfying <br />
their perverted desires. <br />
<br />
Madam Serenity knew of him. Her sixth sense made it impossible for her not to know. But <br />
there was no crime in using the game on the book. And then after their first meeting the <br />
doctor who had a very close friend use a ToD on the doctor to make his use of turns on <br />
patients invisible to her (this thankfully did NOT apply to patients the application of the <br />
game). <br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza knew that the doctor did save lives, but he was also giving a loaded gun to <br />
every person he saved, and those lives were often traded back soon after by a person's <br />
abuse of power. Power corrupted. 'No more. This has to end.' <br />
<br />
And absolute power corrupted absolutely. And all the power Kurse had to warp the world <br />
was in Marie-Eliza's hands but without the insanity to limit it's use. But Marie-Eliza <br />
couldn't simply 'wish away' or 'give up' this power anymore than another person could will <br />
away their spinal column.  But at the same time she couldn't bring herself to commit <br />
murder to turn her audience into copies of herself to spread out and dilute the power.  'I <br />
guess I'm stuck to simply keep the monster chained inside me till the end of my days.'  <br />
<br />
Of course in the material world she was an immortal glass living statue. It was only in this <br />
world that lay within all mirrors that she was a metallic blond lupman pup with glass blue <br />
eyes in a black and red 'Alice' dress.  <br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza thought and simply accepted her fate. She would seek out no cheat, no cheap <br />
quick fast solution, no outside to come out of nowhere to fix her problems for free. She'd <br />
tried that with the victims of the game turned into love dolls and in return had result in the <br />
birth of many dolls and toys with emotions, souls and minds of their own. She'd never <br />

After the hunters' speech about drifting away from Joella's, Lark felt even more grimly <br />
determined to stay by Joella's side.  'It was the last thing aunties I mean the witches told me <br />
to do! 'Stay close to Joella and protect her Lark!' And that's what I'm gonna do! If Free can <br />
promise to always protect something then so can I!' <br />
<br />
Joella meanwhile after the hunters had separated and the preparations for the funeral for <br />
Grandpa Running-Bear had gotten under way, wondered how to help Mal'akh. <br />
<br />
None of her foster siblings had ever been really unhappy. They hadn't cried their eyes out... <br />
until today.  Joella felt hideously helpless. Seeing Mal'akh crying at seeing her sister still <br />
broken, and Joella hearing her foster siblings crying her eyes out at the death of her <br />
mothers was something Joella had never had to face before. <br />
<br />
It didn't matter if Mal'akh wasn't a sibling of hers or not, rejected Lark's offer to be <br />
considered family or not, Mal'akh was sad and hurt and that was all that mattered! <br />
<br />
With everyone waking up from their stupor and mostly everyone's age returning to normal, <br />
of course Aimileona's parents would want their child back. <br />
<br />
But one primal, nearly feral glare from Aimileona made the two large leomans shudder, <br />
turn around, and decide that Aimileona could stay where she was for the time being. <br />
<br />
And Linus of course saw this (he has seven sets of eyes after all), and realized how deathly <br />
important it was that he did indeed teach these children to control themselves, and that <br />
those that couldn't control themselves be put in a position and a situation for where they <br />
wouldn't be able to harm anymore. <br />
<br />
Mal'akh was actually emotionally distraught to actually notice. <br />
<br />
Joella was not sure how to deal with her own loss (and two or three hunters it seemed <br />
never growing tired of saying how awful her parents were every time the hunters opened <br />
their mouths).  Lark had even less a clue, her order to stay by and protect Joella giving her <br />
a thread of hope to cling to (and the hunters decree that she'd leave Joella eventually <br />
making her somehow even MORE determined not to). <br />
<br />
Joella however, her empathy overriding all, finally took Joella by one hand, and Aimileona <br />
in another and led them along inside the house. Lark followed three steps behind (and <br />
would bite and claw more viciously than the most feral lupman pup anyone who tried to <br />
move her much further away).<br />
<br />
Joella listened to her crying foster siblings. And shed more tears. She wished there were a <br />
hundred of her, so they each could help everyone. But there was only one of her, and she <br />
had to help everyone one person at a time. <br />
<br />
There was no rule of empathy for Joella, everyone was a person to her. <br />
<br />
Joella present cakes from the pantry, toys from the nursery, nothing worked. <br />
<br />
Lark seeing Joella's efforts going nowhere dared take off her dress (it itched anyway though <br />
she knew she'd be talked to later about it). And she then performed some minor feats of <br />
acrobatics before Mal'akh's eyes like a circus performer. She then tried to make some face <br />
at Mal'akh. Again, nothing worked. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I was horrendously depressed when my sister didn't break out of her madness when the <br />
wicked witches were gone, Joella, and by virtue of that Lark, tried everything... of course <br />
they hadn't really experienced loss until the wicked witches were dead, so they were <br />
playing by ear and they thought of this as just the kind of sadness one gets when one <br />
misses something or has loss something, they didn't know how to handle the loss of <br />
'someone.' &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds bad.&quot; Kevin said having trouble comprehending the loss the quadruplets were <br />
going through. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did they help you?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They did... but it took some time.... I never stopped visiting Aimileona, ever, and there <br />
were times Joella visited me with her. But ... it never occurred me, how natural it became <br />
just to have Joella with me like it was for Aimileona... it just sort of happened...&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Finally Lark and Joella chose to go on a hunt to try and cheer up Mal'akh... Of course <br />
Aimileona had to be watched constantly, and Lark and Joella had no clue what they were <br />
doing and Mal'akh ended up being the one to teach them what to do step by step... she was <br />
considered a lioness by leoman standards after all... she had made her first solo kill. That <br />
for leomans made her a woman. <br />
<br />
So she found herself teaching Joella, Lark how to hunt, and Aimileona had to be taught all <br />
over again. <br />
<br />
Mal'akh looked at them and a thought thundered through her mind. <br />
<br />
&quot;You... you lost a part of your family too...&quot; She had known that already of course! She had <br />
lost the witches, but Mal'Akh hadn't really felt sorry for that. Then there was Joseph <br />
Running-Bear... this, was another in a series of cruel blows.  <br />
<br />
But before, all Mal'akh saw was the wicked witches and all they had done to her dog and <br />
Aimileona... and for one civilized moment, Mal'akh wondered what face the witches had <br />
shown Joella. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aimileona's not lost... she's right here... and... she's just unwell... I'm sure we can help her <br />
... somehow.&quot; Joella said with a pathetically fake smile. The magic of her parents couldn't <br />
help Aimileona... Joella therefore wondered if anything could. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder if there are any books on how to help her.&quot; Mal'akh said, there seemed to be <br />
books on anything after all. <br />
<br />
&quot;Books?&quot; Lark blinked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know books right?&quot; Mal'akh asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, I'm not stupid,&quot; Lark responded, &quot;I've just never seen one.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mal'akh didn't believe this, &quot;You mean the witches never gave you any books EVER?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They never thought they were needed.&quot; Joella explained. <br />
<br />
Linus' role as an educator couldn't come soon enough. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on...&quot; Mal'akh said, &quot;I'll show you some of the books at my house.&quot;<br />
<br />

1689 August, A Few Days Later...  <br />
<br />
As Father Draco and  Linus quickly learned, their endless downplaying and negative words <br />
on the part of the witches were not tolerated by the former familiars, the witch pride, or <br />
Joella.   The fact they had brought it up ever other sentence did not help things in the least. <br />
<br />
Finally to keep the peace Joella had ORDERED Linus and Father Draco and Equality to NEVER <br />
bad mouth her mothers in her presence, or those of her foster siblings or the Witch Pride. <br />
And that settled that. If Linus sought to teach the former familiar, he could not use Joella's <br />
mothers as an object lesson. <br />
<br />
Running-Bear's Funeral wasn't the one one to be held. There was also the funeral for the <br />
two lionesses that Kathrine had gutted in self defense, not to mention the many other <br />
leomans who had been killed by the hunter's invasion. <br />
<br />
They were buried behind Running-Bear's grave. <br />
<br />
The fact that three of the hunters now bored the mark of servitude to Joella was the only <br />
reason that the Witch Pride and familiars accepted Father Draco and the others. <br />
<br />
Father Draco spoke, of Running-Bear's selflessness, his devotion to Christ, his loyalty to <br />
the Lord, his love to his family, he tireless task of trying to teach others right from wrong, <br />
and the legacy he left behind in the form of Joella. <br />
<br />
With the witches' power, they never had much need for money, and with their geass over <br />
all the town, nobody if ever charged them for anything. <br />
<br />
This wasn't the case anymore. And any power the child familiars could muster was not <br />
focused or directed yet. So they were left with only what was on the witches' estate in of <br />
itself. <br />
<br />
They still found several flowers from the witches' massively beautiful flower garden to lay <br />
the way for Running-Bear's funeral. And were able to find black cloth form their master's <br />
wardrobe even if there was nowhere near enough for everyone.<br />
<br />
Rosalie found 'Princess' and by Princess' own request kept her hidden and safe, in return <br />
Princess promising to impart all she had learned from her master to Rosalie, on the <br />
condition she kept her safe and not reveal her to the former hunters.  So at least some of <br />
her masters' knowledge wouldn't be gone forever.  Herodias, broken inside, entertained no <br />
thoughts for revenge... the world was still broken, and the bound the witches had shared <br />
to create their ultimate power to fix it was gone forever. All that remained now was for <br />
Herodias to pass on what knowledge she could. <br />
<br />
Linus, Father Draco, and Equality asked also at the funeral, since Running Bear had been <br />
their friend as well, and since it was the christian thing to do, which Running-Bear had <br />
been, to forgive Sister Maria and Sister Kathrine, for there had been already enough <br />
senseless loss of life. <br />
<br />
Their fellow servants and devoted to Joella accepted this a lot more readily then they would <br />
have from an outsider. The fact they had finally stopped staying how awful the witches <br />
were in EVERY CONVERSATION helped the hunters' plea considerably....<br />
<br />
Joseph Running-Bear's body had been laid in the ground and covered for the dirt to take <br />
back the empty shell when all the leomans smelled it. <br />
<br />
Hercules and the other males of course stepped foreword, it was tradition for the males to <br />
defend the territory after all. (This would actually create debate in war time weather it <br />
broke tradition for male or female leomans to take part in wars as to weather the war was <br />
defensive or aggressive...). <br />
<br />
Equality saw them. The wolf pack. Countless number of them. Ever wolf in Glendale that <br />
went on two legs was swarming around the witches hut.  A sea of black, silver and reddish <br />
brown with dots of bright felman likes colors converging on the house. It was like a land <br />
war in Asia. <br />
<br />
Francis and Julianna didn't know why, but they felt fear. They had never seen lupmans <br />
besides themselves this close up before... or smelled so many of them. <br />
<br />
The horde formed a circle of claws and fangs around the witches house. Many leomans <br />
prepared for the fight to the end from the revenge minded wolves.<br />
<br />
That was when the biggest, strongest, and toughest looking wolf there (a larger wolf with a <br />
limp hovering in his shadow) came a few steps foreword.<br />
<br />
Hercules spoke first, &quot;Strange how much bravery you have now to face people five to one <br />
when we're in the middle of grieving at the loss of several members of our family...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're not here for you, I am Alpha Ross. These are my Beta Wives Jadis. Morgonna. And <br />
Gilda. We are here for the two lupman pups you have unrightfully have.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU'RE NOTHING BUT BULLIES TAKING WHATEVER YOU WANT!&quot;  Twilight looked ready to <br />
tear the wolves limp from limp. <br />
<br />
&quot;THey're Lupmans! They belong with their own kind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;THEY'RE NOT PROPERTY!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
Alissa and Samantha actually moved closer to Francis and Julianna protectively. <br />
<br />
Morgonna spoke, &quot;What you say doesn't matter. You no longer have the POWER to back up <br />
your words! We do! It's those with POWER that decide what is right and what is wrong!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jadis spoke, &quot;Lupman belong with lupman, you wouldn't allow us to raise two leomans <br />
would you?&quot; <br />
<br />
Gilda spoke, &quot;You've already lost so many... would you really want to lose more over <br />
something you have no right to to begin with?&quot;<br />
<br />
Magdalena and Benjamin were scared for their daughters and their house mates. Benjamin <br />
wished he had his rifle with him. Or that all the cannons the witches had hadn't blown up. <br />
He suddenly didn't mind them again now that he needed them. <br />
<br />
Dawn spoke, &quot;They're OUR family... we've raised them... they're our pups as much as our <br />
cubs are... please don't do this to us...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;WE'RE THE WITCH PRIDE!&quot; Francis shouted holding his sister. <br />
<br />
&quot;WE'RE NOT ONE OF YOU!!!&quot; Julianna snarled looking ready to take on the entire pack <br />
themselves. <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Francis and Julianna saw themselves as part of the Witch Pride?&quot; Abbey exclaimed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Family isn't just about blood. It's about the heart too. The Big Bad Wolf Pack wouldn't see <br />
that.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Joella looked at the Lupman army. She looked at the injured and much smaller leoman <br />
pride, one naga, one gargoyle, and one dragon. The lupman didn't question, figuring they <br />
were all the witches spawn. <br />
<br />
She looked at the graves, and then at the Lupman. <br />
<br />
&quot;Will we be allowed to visit?&quot; Joella asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;And who are you? And why do you address the alpha?&quot; Morgonna asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;THIS IS JOELLA! Heir to the witches! Show her respect!&quot; Dawn shouted protectively. <br />
<br />
&quot;... I am sorry if I've spoken out of turn.&quot; Joella said again, &quot;But... if Francis and Julianna go <br />
with you.. will we allowed to visit?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ross thought of the losses the monsters could do to his pack before being able to claim <br />
the pups. 'Whatever damned influence they can try to infect the pups with... I'm sure Jadis <br />
can knock it out of them.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Granted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joella felt like she was swallowing poison. &quot;They're yours to take.&quot;<br />
<br />
EVERYONE GASPED.<br />
<br />
Ross gestured at an orange and white lupman, &quot;Miles, take them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yess Alpha.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miles came towards the two pups.<br />
<br />
The two pubs were taken from their foster siblings kicking, crying, and screaming. Howling <br />
that they'd rather be Leoman than Lupman if it mean being taken away from their family. <br />
Miles was quick to hand them off. This made the wolves with them simply strike them and <br />
order them to be quite. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're nothing but big bad wolves! I hope a woods man comes by and chops you open!&quot; <br />
Samantha shouted her lungs out at the beasts that could eat her alive if they wished. <br />
<br />
&quot;Francis. Julianna. I order you not to resist.&quot; Joella breathed out.<br />
<br />
Francis and Julianna looked at Joella like she had told them she didn't love them and <br />
wanted them to die.<br />
<br />
Lark, Jimmy, Rouge, Canary, OCeana, Becky, Violet, Irine, annd the rest of the former mob <br />
familiars looked at Joella in absolute horror.<br />
<br />
The two blond lupman pups went limp like rag dolls.<br />
<br />
&quot;No one is to stop them from taking the pups.&quot; Joella said looking green. <br />
<br />
All the witch clan shuddered.<br />
<br />
Twilight however, in that moment, showed free will and initiative.<br />
<br />
&quot;NOW HOLD ON!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Jadis asked cooly.<br />
<br />
&quot;.... take me with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What use would we have for an abomination?&quot; Morgonna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is not your concern anymore, just walk away.&quot; Gilda asked politely.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.... I... I ...&quot; Twilight felt like she was going mad, &quot;I don't care what my master says.... &quot; <br />
SHe felt so sick inside, &quot;Your two pups are cleanly going to be infected with many leoman <br />
ideas yes? They could act in ways you can't predict. And how better than a monster? Who <br />
they clearly would never trust the words of to help you keep them in line?.... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll be legally our slave. Below even the omegas.&quot; Ross said simply sure this would force <br />
away the abomination.<br />
<br />
&quot;I accept.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ross started, but bound by this word. &quot;Very well... come with us now, you take no personal <br />
effects, you are property, you own nothing, we own you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Twilight just nodded. <br />
<br />
Dawn at once hugged Twilight begging her not to go. She only wished she hadn't <br />
questioned Twilight's choice to become what she was, 'Maybe if if had chosen to be a <br />
monster too.. maybe I could go with her.' Dawn regretted at being separated from her best <br />
friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Twilight I order you not to do this!&quot; Joella shouted. <br />
<br />
Twilight shuddered, feeling like her brain was on fire, but managed to cough out, &quot;No my <br />
master... I am now.. honor bound.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are your masters now abomination.&quot; Jadis said, &quot;Never forget that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... master...&quot;<br />
<br />
When the horde had left with it's three prizes in tow, Joella ran to her room, locked it (one <br />
of the few rooms that could be locked), and didn't come out for two days... crying. That <br />
had been the last straw. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
The fact they had to go without their nun robes felt nothing sort of sacrilegious to Sister <br />
Marie Cruz, but she figured she was damned anyway. <br />
<br />
Kathrine was praying an extra rosary for this daily.<br />
<br />
However two women traveling alone DID get the two nuns stopped by the local authorities <br />
more than once and that caused delays. <br />
<br />
So Kathrine and Marie with a wagon full of artifacts and books made the ride back to <br />
Glendale without incident. Except when Kathrine's face had accidently gotten in a spider's <br />
nest... and Marie Cruz had to pick the spiders off Kathrine one by one herself because <br />
Kathrine couldn't perform the act of taking them off herself because it might injure them.<br />
<br />
It was a good thing that Kathrine lived in an area before the existence of bacteria was <br />
known or she might have been trapped before not breathing to prevent from inhaling <br />
them, or still breathing because that would be violence onto herself and go mad from the <br />
impossible order.<br />
<br />
It was already midnight when the two women finally made into Glendale. And both decided <br />
to simply rest for the night. Having just crossed into the town borders. <br />
<br />
 Marie Cruz kept watch as long as she could stay awake. But the trip and recent events had <br />
pushed her to her limits and she finally surrendered to sleep.<br />
<br />
And at roughly the same time, Kathrine felt the call of nature and left the wagon to pee. <br />
<br />
That was when they found her. A small handful of small and drunk soldiers. They were lost, <br />
their booze hadn't helped them find their way back to Frostvile. <br />
<br />
They saw the mutant stunted leoman woman, they saw she was vulnerable, they saw she <br />
was pretty, and she was one and they were not. <br />
<br />
If Kathrine could still defend herself... they'd have reconsidered their option and left after <br />
their third friend hit the ground. <br />
<br />
Now however, all Kathrine could do was try to scream, which they quickly stopped. She <br />
couldn't even bite on their hands to get their fingers away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think she's gonna make a nice fur coat while we're at at et.&quot; Said one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Naw, too much worry Benny for me.&quot; Said another. <br />
<br />
Kathrine was horrified, she was going to become unclean! And all because Marie Cruz <br />
saved her form having to kill her best friend.... <br />
<br />
SHe was going to be made unclean.<br />
<br />
The first of the men dropped his pants.<br />
<br />
SHe was going to be made unclean.<br />
<br />
Another pulled on her dress.<br />
<br />
She was going to be made unclean.<br />
<br />
Panic gripped her mind. <br />
<br />
She felt one moment of clarity, and ticked the man's fingers with her tongue. He let go for <br />
one moment. But instead of calling out for Marie... Kathrine reacted with thinking of how <br />
she couldn't defend herself and why and the words spilled out of her mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or Dare? Be a slave to one task. Or be made something you are not. One <br />
minute to decide or be struck by both.&quot;<br />
<br />
The five men stood stunned... confused... and wondered why they had stopped doing what <br />
they were doing. They should just proceed where they left off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is she crazy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She'll do just as well crazy or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah yeah whatever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we should just let her be? I hear there are witches about in these parts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's no thing as witches stupid!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You all get both. I dare you to never speak of this to anyone ever and to become perfect <br />
gentlemen who never touch a woman unless she asks it of you, listen to what women have <br />
to say, and to treat all women with respect and honor. You'll Transform into proper felmans <br />
who'll be perfectly friendly with others and each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
The soldiers shuddered. Their uniforms remained the same as their species changed. <br />
Kathrine had included no changes to reality and being a nun could barely comprehend <br />
anyone but the Lord could do that. <br />
<br />
They grew shorter unless they were pretty much the same height as Kathrine (unlike other <br />
species, Felman heights between genders were much the same). Bright pink, bright blue, <br />
bright red, bright yellow, and bright green fur appeared on their bodies as tails poked out <br />
of their too big uniforms, and their faces became feline and they loss weight and muscle <br />
mass, their head hair remained much as it was already. Their feet became paws and their <br />
hands into paws with thumbs. <br />
<br />
The five soldiers looked at each other, and immediately began to act the stereotype of their <br />
fur colors as was proper for the felmans to do. All thoughts or ideas of violating Kathrine <br />
was gone from their minds. The idea of harming her in revenge became empty, the idea of <br />
screaming 'witch' and telling someone also dissolved before it could even form. <br />
<br />
With only one viable option, the five new felmans fled... the booze gone from their system <br />
and would find their way back to Forstvile, though convincing anyone they were themselves <br />
would prove near impossible and would end up having to start their lives over... <br />
<br />
They would eventually try to use their turns women they had honestly charmed into <br />
become compatible (as was proper for Felmans to mate with other felmans) but upon <br />
finding it hadn't worked. The remainder and their comrades would move to Glendale, the <br />
silent voice of the game telling them where the turns would function. And THERE they'd <br />
change their partners into felmans... <br />
<br />
Kathrine knew none of this, she simply wandered back to the wagon, went back to sleep <br />
(having already emptied herself) and tried to convince herself it had all been just a bad <br />
dream. And never spoke a word of it to Marie, knowing Marie would just blame herself for <br />
the incident and that nothing could be realistically done about it. <br />
<br />

<br />
A trick Linus learned after receiving his books an artifacts was that he could use his extra <br />
six heads to read, listen, and SPEAK!  This added to his abilities as a teacher greatly he <br />
found, being able to deal with his 'students' one on one more easily and teach them various <br />
subjects, it was like the snakes in his arms had brains that were developing shadows of his <br />
own mind. <br />
<br />
The witches grandmother and Running-Bear had both known the fate the girls were <br />
destine for and had tried to prevent. And had failed.<br />
<br />
However these child familiars didn't have such power that they quickly over stepped their <br />
teacher. And Rosalie was the only one to have a familiar, one sullen, broken, and world <br />
weary.<br />
<br />
As for the child nudists... while Linus was able to get them to wear clothes in town... <br />
getting them to wear anything besides the occasional jewelry had proven to be a near war, <br />
and finally a treaty was struck where they'd be allowed to go around naked at home if they <br />
promised to behave and to listen to EVERYTHING Linus had to say, and also as long as their <br />
'grades' remained high.  This proved to be a powerful motivator. Also, Linus stressed <br />
CONTROL in his lessons rather than bringing out their power.  The witches weren't the first <br />
mages to abuse their power, and likely wouldn't be the last. So Linus had no problem <br />
displaying other object lessons.<br />
<br />
Also, the naga found he could keep his student's attention relatively easy with his stare, <br />
while not mind control, it made it impossible for anyone to break their attention away from <br />
him. So no lessons were forgotten, not if they want to still go around naked at the house. <br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;We are witch huntersss! We know thessse thingsss! Thessse people are NOT witchesss!&quot;  <br />
Linus declare from under his protective cloak. Sister Marie staying behind him to be on the <br />
safe side. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then how do you explain the dream evidence?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have thesse people sshown as gift of prophecy before? Or in anything esssle?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I fail to see how that has anything to do with anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie Cruz sighed.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for freeing us, but I don't think they'll ever stop looking for me.&quot; Said the man <br />
for his wife, two daughters and son who had fled with him.<br />
<br />
The jail break had to be discovered by now. <br />
<br />
&quot;There isss one way, but you'll have to give everything up except each other.&quot; Warned the <br />
disguised Naga Marie Cruz looking look out. <br />
<br />
&quot;As long as we have the lord and each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
'Transssform Or Dare?&quot;<br />

The family of five brightly colored felmans moved onto Glendale without trouble, <br />
remembering having come across the sea to start a better life and having no memory of <br />
ever having lived in Salam. <br />

Draco wanted his mission built. Joella commanded that his mission be built. And she had a <br />
full crew of expert carpenters at her command. Getting the materials took some doing, <br />
(the leomans having to get JOBS outside of working at the witches house).  This did provide <br />
a way for the two leoman prides to interact with each other however.<br />
<br />
Also, since the witches' minions had all been technically atheists (due to their attitude <br />
towards gods), and due to Running Bear's example, and not realizing the difference before <br />
Catholics and protestants... <br />
<br />
Father Draco, the former dragon, now a human with a death clock, found himself with a <br />
relatively impressive flock. One of the former mob members even began to show interest in <br />
becoming a priest. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I was a dragon... it must be so wonderful to fly.&quot; Said the dark green haired 'child' <br />
familiar (now a teenager) after service one day confessed to Father Draco. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is that really what you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me that answer again in a week if you really want it.&quot;<br />
<br />
.... A week later... <br />
<br />
&quot;I dare you to never use the game except to help or protect another. Transform into a <br />
dragon who will be beautiful and always able to fly. May no one question that you are a <br />
dragon and simply accept you are one....&quot; <br />

<br />
Lawrence observed, &quot;So THAT'S where the Fire family came from.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn't they eventually marry into a Felman line?&quot; Maddex's heads asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, might just be gossip.&quot; Betty thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;Continuing,&quot; Marie-Eliza said. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Just sign these papers miss and the estate is yours.&quot; Said the man an entranced look in <br />
his eyes thanks to Lark so he'd accepted processing paper work for a woman to be the <br />
owner of an estate. <br />
<br />
Joella signed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me miss, are you lupman?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I have to ask you to sign in your surname.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joella thought for a moment. She had never known the last names of her three mothers. <br />
She considered for a moment to take her grandfather's last name, but she wasn't sure if it <br />
really was a last name or not.  There was only one other person she could think of that <br />
could count as family somehow. <br />
<br />
Joella wrote down a surname.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Miss Cruz, the estate is now legally yours.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad look out!&quot; Shouted an adult dragon, as a flat, circular disc came flying at the old <br />
human (suffering from what would be called in later years premature aging).<br />
<br />
The old man (but not as old as he looked) turned, and tried to raise his wings, only to <br />
remember once again and for the last time that he no longer had them... and he <br />
experienced flying again... and then he spoke to Saint Peter on the amount of good and evil <br />
he had done in his life. <br />
<br />
Linus came at the man cowled in white with all seven of his heads, but it was like the killer <br />
had known Linus was there before Linus decided to strike!  A primitive flash grenade <br />
blasted into the naga's face. And having fourteen eyes with no eyelids suddenly seemed <br />
like no such a great advantage.<br />
<br />
The adult dragon came down fire blooming from his third lung but the killer's white cowl <br />
proved to be fire resistant! The killer leapt into the air and kicked the dragon's jaw shut, <br />
causing internal damage and slammed the dragon hard into the dragon stabbing the nerve <br />
points in the arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will not kill you wyrm. You are a infidel, and thus only deserve death if you won't will <br />
hear Allah's words. Or one who dares spread the words of one who raises a prophet to <br />
godhood. But you are needed for something.&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Prophet to godhood?&quot; Samantha asked totally confused. <br />
<br />
Marie-Cruz sighed (as she often did), &quot;The Islamic consider Jesus a prophet, while the <br />
Jewish people do not consider Jesus anything other than 'some man.' &quot; <br />
<br />

The elderly Marie Cruz found Draco's dead body... and his adopted son hanging upside <br />
down crucified. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sister Cruz!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;DRACO!!!&quot; Marie Cruz cried out in horror. &quot;Toby! What happened?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A man in a whitehood... killed... killed.. he killed father!&quot;<br />
<br />
'White hood?' Why did that sound familiar?<br />
<br />
&quot;He... he took... he took Linus and...&quot; Steam came from Toby's eyes, the closest thing <br />
dragons could ever to tears....<br />
<br />
++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Marie Cruz went to where the man in the white hood said to go. She found he had also <br />
taken a leoman hostage and had lopped Dawn's arm and foot off... Dawn said it had been <br />
like fighting a mirage. <br />
<br />
Marie Cruz found Linus... his arms cut off and his heads impaled to a wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;The creature of the heathen religion is dead witch.&quot; Said a voice echoing from everywhere <br />
inside the tower. <br />
<br />
Marie Cruz screamed cried cursed wailed and wept inside. Outside he kept a face like <br />
Equality. &quot;Before we kill each other... one question. Who did I kill?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHO HAVE YOU NOT KILLED WITCH-?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Granted. But WHO?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;MY BROTHERS! My gift from Allah showed me, you killed my middle brother when he <br />
sought to kill the head of your infidel web of lies. And then you killed my eldest when he <br />
sought to destroy the black heart of your hive of depravity!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Abraham...&quot; Marie Cruz whispered.<br />
<br />
He heard it. &quot;NEVER CALL HIM BY THAT NAME WITCH!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It took you this long to find one old woman? ... To kill one old woman? If you had sought <br />
out to kill me I wouldn't have resisted. I'd have let you... But you made the gross mistake of <br />
involving the precious few friends I had... I'll be gods left hand one last time...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you dare assume you are an instrument of Allah! My body is clean! My mind is clean! <br />
My heart is clean! My soul is clean! My spirit is clean!~ YOU are a dirty little creature!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;.... I wonder every day if there was a day to save some of the people I put out of their <br />
misery... from the sounds of it you don't have that same problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you're resolve to eliminate the inpure is not pure, then you are not clean!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your order doesn't know you're here do they?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I HAVE SEVERED ALL TIES WITH THOSE OLD MEN! They couldn't see the future! They <br />
couldn't see what needed to be done! They said killing you was meaningless! The avenging <br />
of my brothers is not meaningless!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So we're both excels from our brotherhood of killers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HOW DARE YOU COMPARE YOURSELF TO ME? You're nothing!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... I have friends. I have family. I've spent decades atoning for the acts I commit protecting <br />
innocent lives and the faith and civilization. ... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;THERE IS NO NEED TO ATONE FOR WHAT MUST BE DONE!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... there are things that are necessary, things that must be done, but that doesn't make <br />
them the RIGHT thing!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;This is why women are not meant to be warriors of Allah. They are weak. Enough talk. My <br />
brothers souls will finally rest in peace.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie Cruz of course felt the disc coming before he threw it, he saw the blade coming <br />
before she drew it. She saw bomb go off before it hit the floor. He saw her short sword <br />
thrust before she came at him. She saw the dagger before he pulled back his cloak to hide <br />
it. He saw the knife before she trusted it up to where he gullet would have been.<br />
<br />
Not for a moment did the assassin underestimate her due to her missing eye or old age or <br />
being for a faith that supposedly opposed his.<br />
<br />
They moved like shadows, afterimage after afterimage, seeing each other blows before they <br />
happened. They were at a complete stalemate. <br />
<br />
The assassin made only one mistake. He was focused completely on Maria Cruz. Nothing <br />
else there. Thus when Marie Cruz threw a dagger that was a complete miss, he failed to <br />
note what it struck... or what went off... until it consumed him... and the flames never <br />
ceased.<br />
<br />
Marie took time to say a prayer, and to take Linus' remains... and the old woman limped <br />
out of the burning tower. 'Did he intend to burn the bodies and leave no evidence?' Marie <br />
wondered, but realized it no longer mattered. She had lost two of her friends in the same... <br />
even if she didn't follow death... death would always follow her. <br />

At midnight there was a knock on the door. At midnight the elderly Kathrine opened it. She <br />
didn't know how much longer she'd last, Felman simply didn't live as long as humans. <br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me miss... I am vooking for a Sister Maria Cruz... I know you want to help me... I <br />
know you want to help me ----UGH!&quot; He was very confused when he gaze didn't turn the <br />
woman in a happy little puppet like it had hundreds of others. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're already dead... so it's not violence to 'kill' you...&quot; Kathrine said simply her spear <br />
rammed like a stake through the finely dressed man's long ago not beating heart... <br />
<br />

<br />
Lady Joella wasn't part of the underground railroad. That wouldn't exist for a hundred and <br />
fifty years.  But Free and her did manage to liberate several slaves via methods that <br />
Leoman considered 'uncivilized.' Via the help also of a pair of blond wolf pack members. <br />
And an innocent pair of looking old nuns. <br />
<br />
Sometimes men found which way the slaves had done... most left Glendale in a daze <br />
having a strong urge to rethink their lives. Others.... got a fresh start. <br />
<br />
++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Did Lady Joella ever find a way to cheat death?&quot; Samantha asked.<br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza shook her head, &quot;No... remember she wanted to be with her grandfather and <br />
mothers... she had no reason to try and avoid death's gasp. Also, while the majority of child <br />
familiars did leave to find their own lives.. Lark was differently, mostly to the witches last <br />
order.  She was the one who found Joella had died in her sleep nearly a hundred years <br />
later... she herself died the next year, seemingly holding on only long enough so the <br />
witch's estate could belong to the Glendale pride and the local church equally... Marie <br />
promised Joella when Mal'akh was turned into a statue that she'd be freed one day... and <br />
actually offered for Joella to be there for her when Mal'akh awakened... but Joella asked if <br />
Mal'akh would find happiness. Marie said she would, and Joella accepted she wouldn't <br />
abandon her friends in the present...&quot;<br />

<br />
Alice's unique phrasing of a Transform or Dare made the wolves immune to being restored <br />
to their human selves in the previous timeline and the immunity passed over to the new <br />
timeline. <br />
<br />
However, the Omegas with the exception of Martha had been Bart and Jenny's shadows in <br />
the previous reality when Alice had given the pack their immunity. <br />
<br />
 Mary had been changed by the power of an ordinary Transform or Dare which didn't <br />
include any impossibility to her 'changing back.' <br />
<br />
And the immunity had been on Elise and Fox, not their split up four way souls that had <br />
becomes their daughters in the new timeline. <br />
<br />
And the twins had been single people before Kurse's games, so they had not been given <br />
the 'Transform or Dare' that their 'parents' had. <br />
<br />
Thus none of them had the 'immunity to species' change the majority of the Big Bad Wolf <br />
Pack and the Leomans did.  However, that being said, the Omegas had no desire to <br />
abandon their pack, and the twins and cubs as it stood now had no desire to abandon their <br />
families. <br />
<br />
Gretchen stayed near Nane of course. And Giselle stayed near Gretchen. <br />
<br />
And Tano, Sita, and Saba stayed here Nane.<br />
<br />
And Toni and Paula stayed there Saba. <br />
<br />
And Mary of course stayed nere Mjoa, Mbili, Tatuli and Nneli. <br />
<br />
The rest of the twins stayed their parents/the omegas.<br />
<br />
It was Tano however, who had an affinity for dolls (a trait Sita shared as well) who asked <br />
first a set of surprisingly logical questions. <br />
<br />
&quot;So how long have you lived here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All my life.&quot; Destiny answered. <br />
<br />
&quot;How long has that been?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fifteen or twenty years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We stopped counting how many candles were on my birthday cake after I stopped <br />
growing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know why you stopped growing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so I could be like my sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whose that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Destiny pointed at an identical purple pony, &quot;That's my sister Fate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Twins?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not technically.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said your farm doesn't have TV, radio, new papers, money or books... have they ever?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then how do you know what those things are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Day and Night, those two over there,&quot; She gestured at a white and black pair of ponies <br />
with the sun and moon symbols. &quot;When I was asking people what they dream about when I <br />
had my first dream... I dreamed I was tap dancing with corp stalks as the moon gave me <br />
critical reviews while the farm house played checkers with the barn... Day and Night told <br />
me about money when explaining a bad dream they once had about bank robbers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the rest?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;My sister explained that outside Ponyland, Fate told me that My Little Ponies are only <br />
known about on 'cartoons' on 'TV' and as 'toys.' When I asked what a TV was, she told me <br />
to talk to Never-Star and Valentines, those are my parents by the way... They told me a <br />
news paper was what tells you how many people in far away places have died that day. <br />
Radio is for music and listening to angry men explain why they're angry. And books are <br />
supposedly magical things that can teach you things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not all books are magical, but they are important.&quot; Whitney says, &quot;Can you read?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That answers that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know how you can about?&quot; Tano asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My parents loved each other very much and--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NOT THAT!&quot; Whitney exclaimed, &quot;I meant how did you ponies come to be here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fate tells me that something bad happened, but she wished for her family and all us to <br />
live happily ever after as My Little Ponies... well everyone else. I was born here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tano asked taking note of all the cartoon doll horses looking female, &quot;And no boys?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are those?&quot;<br />
<br />
Whitney exclaimed, &quot;THEN HOW DID YOUR ... sorry, I don't mean to shout, how were you <br />
born?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said, my parents loved me very much and-&quot;<br />
<br />
Whitney sighed, &quot;Never mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what's reading?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's how you get the knowledge out of books.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there lots of stuff to know in books? Like what the rest of the world is like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... there is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I could read, and had books to read then.&quot; Destiny said simply.<br />
<br />
Destiny called out, &quot;EVERYONE! WE HAVE GUESTS! THEY SAY THEY HAVE IMPORTANT <br />
NEWS!&quot;<br />
<br />
The My Little Ponies dropped from their tasks and began to gather around the wolves. All <br />
smiling, all so friendly, yet didn't quite feel like an invasion of the happy-body-snatchers <br />
for some reason.  Then again, Leoman were infamous for being 'too' friend to some so only <br />
the lupmans noticed. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Daisy.&quot; &quot;I'm Lucky.&quot; &quot;We're Day and Night.&quot; &quot;I'm Fate, hey Destiny!&quot; &quot;I'm Ruby! Wanna <br />
play?&quot; &quot;I'm Valentines this is my best friend in the whole wide world Never-Star.&quot; &quot;Second <br />
star to the right, straight on till morning.&quot;  And a multitude of other smiling brightly <br />
colored doll like cartoon horses introduced themselves. <br />
<br />
The explorers got the idea that it was going to take time to explain things. But they felt like <br />
they had the time. <br />
<br />
Destiny heard something and wandered off, not feeling it right to leave guests. But feeling <br />
she had to the way her mother had felt the need to 'push' when she was born. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile a young man drove her book mobile, an impressive one too... but with the <br />
digital age, new media, video games, TV, movies, radio, and all the rest, READING to learn <br />
anything from an changeable source like books had became... quaint.  <br />
<br />
Her collage degree in history and geography .... and here she was driving a book mobile... <br />
on a funeral march. It was formally decided to turn the books, not having found buyers... <br />
were to be recycled. The young man felt disgusted.  She intentionally took the long way to <br />
the recycle center where she was ordered to drop off the books. And of course ended up <br />
getting lost.... maybe a little TOO lost... <br />
<br />
SHe must have gotten off the road at some point, or it was like the road was opening in <br />
front of her and closing like it had never been there behind her... But that was silly right?<br />
<br />
When she came upon a big pink and white farm with corps out of season.. she wondered if <br />
she had stumbled on a theme park. But the corps looked very much real and very much <br />
healthy. <br />
<br />
That was when the mobile broke down (she wasn't that surprised really). What surprised <br />
her and made her think someone had slipped mushroom into her lunch was a purple My <br />
Little Pony, the size of an actual pony, standing in real life in front of her. Maybe Kurse was <br />
back to try again?<br />
<br />
But this little horse looked a lot more reasonable than the things of nightmares and <br />
insanity Kurse had brought upon the world. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, my name is Destiny, I'm a My Little Pony, a real one... who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm nobody... just someone who has gone by before they were even born.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's silly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell that to my books.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have book?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Yes.... I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you read?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, books aren't much good if you can't read.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you teach me to read-?! Can I have your books?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I was just going to recycle them anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Recycle them into what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Toilet paper I imagine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Un, never mind, not something you need to know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, so can I have your books, and can you teach me how to read?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... people are kinda going to ask where these books went...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if they didn't have to be recycled? What if they could stay books?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I gotcha... and... I've kinda got plenty of spare time... with no home and no job...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You can work at our farm.. your job can be to teach me how to read!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And after that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I was told books need a librarian right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You kinda need a library for that... kid...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Foal actually.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Figures....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That big thing can be your library...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh I guess...So sure kid. Works for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Destiny's eye, the young woman's body turned pale green, her eyes emerald green, <br />
and her hair dark green. Her clothes vanished, but a big pair of black rimmed glasses <br />
appeared over her face. Then her body shifted, losing all openings, all fingers and toes, as <br />
a book symbol appeared on her rump. Then a curly green tail came out of her spinal <br />
column above where her rear used to be. Then her size changed until she was the same of <br />
a My Little Pony her face and neck stretching out. <br />
<br />
Behind her, her book mobile lost it's wheels, and grew, doubling then quadrupling inside... <br />
becoming white and pink of course and giving the false impression of somehow being <br />
plastic... then it complete shifted shape, until it resembled something vaguely resembling <br />
a traditional library.<br />
<br />
The new My Little Pony said, &quot;You asked what my name was... My name is Bookworm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why a worm?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cause I dig books.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! I get it!&quot; Destiny laughed. Bookworm simply smiled and said, &quot;Well, come on in...&quot;<br />
<br />
Bookworm was only mildly surprised when she found the inside was bigger than the <br />
outside, rivaling the library of congress almost. And she knew the placement of each and <br />
every one of the books inside she realized. <br />
<br />
&quot;INCREDIBLE!&quot; Destiny declared, &quot;So these are books!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... and I'm going to teach you how to read them...&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;So you never told your second daughter about the Transform or Dare?&quot; Whitney asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We felt no need to.&quot; Never-Star said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why are there no boy ponies here?&quot; Sita asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fate never saw any in the cartoon, or at least any episodes she saw... so I guess it was <br />
built from that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how did you have her if you're both girls?&quot; Sita asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we loved each other very much and--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough with the running gag.&quot; Whitney sighed.<br />
<br />
Lilly and Cassandra were playing tag with Fate and Ruby.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you're going to do away with the game?&quot; Never-Star asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it's proven too dangerous, it nearly ended the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It did feel like the farm was pressing back against something a white ago.&quot; Never-Star <br />
said. &quot;That would explain it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So they've found a cure and are going to destroy the game.&quot; Jay said. AFter all, the pack <br />
had used the cure as had the leoman police to fight Kurse's slaves. Which the twins had <br />
been among. <br />
<br />
Never-Star was going to ask if this was going to end everything the game had made, but <br />
she felt in her mind a blond colored pony with glass blue eyes tell her no it would not. She <br />
accepted this answer without question. <br />
<br />
&quot;And once the game is gone, it'll be gone for good? No one will be able to make people do <br />
horrible things anymore?&quot; Valentines asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Jay nodded proudly. <br />
<br />
Valentines looked at Never-Star, &quot;Dear, it seems we have to make a trip to town.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have two turns of the game ourselves... I wouldn't take back the life we had for the <br />
world, and I wouldn't give up this life for the world... but I'm not having anyone else have <br />
their lives ruined because that awful game!&quot;<br />
<br />
Never-Star nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;I hope we won't need money.&quot; Valentines said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Lucky called out, &quot;Who buried this treasure chest in the field-?!&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
No one questioned in Glendale why two brightly colored cartoon like horses were doing <br />
walking down Glendale's main street. Or why they were wearing traveling hats. <br />
<br />
Or when they dialed up information. Got a number. Got an answering machine.  And left a <br />
public phone booth somehow using it without fingers (and let alone how a public phone <br />
booth existed in the 21st century in the advent of cellphones!). <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think our farm needs a chapel or not?&quot; Valentines asks Never-Star.<br />
<br />
Never-Star admitted she hadn't thought about that one. Did 'Happily Ever After' NEED <br />
faith? Salvation? ... Maybe it did logically need God. But those were questions for another <br />
time. <br />
<br />
The two My Little Ponies saw a Christian Church, and wandered in, wondering how they'd <br />
find Madam Serenity in this whole mess. <br />
<br />
The Priest who greeted them looked to be half ape, and another orange ape man who went <br />
around naked with a cross around his neck. But being naked themselves, it wasn't really an <br />
issue.<br />
<br />
But what struck them odd, was that the priest seemed to take notice they were My Little <br />
Ponies. &quot;You are... cartoons?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not exactly... we heard Glendale was curing the game, we LIKE what we are, but we don't <br />
think the game should continue considering what our family had to go through to get <br />
where we are now.&quot; NEver-Star explained.<br />
<br />
That was when Madam Serenity came out... and there introductions all around, Madam <br />
Serenity also learned what happened to the family who was involved in that use of the <br />
Transform or Dare that was linked to a house fire (she was a detective after all, fortune <br />
teller and alchemist after that). <br />
<br />
It was a relief to at least have a close on that case. The two willing allowed their turns to be <br />
destroy with no fuss or muss. <br />
<br />
&quot;People like you living outside the water system make me worried.&quot; Madam Serenity said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry about it,&quot; Valentines smiled and nodded, &quot;Now that we know about it, it <br />
wouldn't be a 'happily ever after' for us if you failed...&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Judas looked at the odd creatures in the church hall. Apparently more of the game's <br />
creations. And the shame of his line for three hundred years! <br />
<br />
&quot;Judas... if you wish for a complete redemption of your line and herself... I can help you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Judas turned and nearly shrieked. The black cat was stunned at the sight. A transparent, <br />
living glass, lupman pup.... <br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Marie-Eliza... I am a witchling... I am looking for a familiar... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not interested.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's to help end the game's legacy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You will my conscience, my constraint, my voice of reason, the power I wield is <br />
frightening, and the only way for me to rid of it is to commit murder. So... will you be my <br />
voice of reason?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
She touched his head, &quot;I name you Jud&iacute;as. You and I are now bound by fate. I am your <br />
witch. You are my familiar.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two felt it... they felt each other... and Jud&iacute;as felt the beast she was riding on the back <br />
of... he shuddered... it felt like Kurse almost...<br />
<br />
And Jud&iacute;as felt his world explode around him, becoming aware of a thousand things he <br />
couldn't before... he also became of the ware of other timelines... of his time with Trevor <br />
the cat... that no longer happened in that way... of the other version of Queen's death... <br />
Jud&iacute;as  now knew it all, for his maste-... no... his only master was still God... he was <br />
Catholic Christian after all...  he may have been bound by the familiar code... but he had <br />
converted to his faith first.<br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza's avatar showed Jud&iacute;as her toy room, and explained how use and cheating of <br />
the game had resulted in the reason why reality insisted on the existence of a toy <br />
collection with souls born for the soul purpose of inhabiting these immobile objects, <br />
destiny to only observe and interact through those who interacted with them...<br />
<br />
She hugged him from behind, &quot;I won't ask you to leave your owners now... not when the <br />
game's destruction is needed and right at our door step... but once the game is gone.. you <br />
help me won't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Personally, Marie-Eliza considered it part of her price for trying to cheat reality to be the <br />
care taker of his massive collection whose price was attention. But if Jud&iacute;as could help her <br />
keep sane, to keep her from becoming Kurse the second... if she really was going to keep <br />
this power till she died of old age... she'd welcome his company. A girl needed a <br />
companion other than her mother after all... who was similarly cursed with eternal life and <br />
no companion to share it with... her husband was dead and would have to wait even longer <br />
on the other side to be reunited with her. <br />
<br />
++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Katy's mom was confused when a letter was hand delivered by a semi-transparent blond <br />
felman child with glass blue eyes. Was she going to go act in a weird play? With that black <br />
dress with the red apron and rune symbols all over it... <br />
<br />
She opened the letter, and her eyes widened in surprise as she read it. <br />
<br />
&quot;The game... the end of it?... At last?&quot; She remembered full well the near rape that had <br />
happened to her precious kitten because of that dreadful curse.<br />
<br />
&quot;KATHRINE DEAR! DRAKE-HONEY! DAIMEN! SETH! You two little half-dragons! We're going <br />
on a short trip back to Glendale soon!&quot;</p>
