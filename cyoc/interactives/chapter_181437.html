<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gabe and Terry: Day 5 of 7<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, Gabey, still thinking of sex after what happened last night? I guess you really have to find someone else more aggressive than me if you want to fully get rid of those thoughts.&quot; Terry said to his friend with a playful wink that hid a bit of deceit. He honestly didn&#39;t like deceiving his best friend like this, but this was for Gabe&#39;s own good. <br />
<br />
&quot;O-oh, okay. If you think that will help me turn back to normal...&quot; Even though Gabe was still clinging to the delusion that he was a straight man and just needing to get the gay thoughts out of his brain, he was still getting affected by the Chonovac and the sex. It seems like he was much more submissive than yesterday. <br />
<br />
Anyway, Terry needed to find that aggressive man to fully bring Gabe over to his side. The question is who? Well, there was Danny who had just walked past them. That guy didn&#39;t seem entirely straight, according to Terry&#39;s gaydar, as well as being hot and aggressive. Although, something inside of Terry was telling him that it was wrong to find Danny attractive. That he wasn&#39;t supposed to think this way at all. He didn&#39;t know why he had those thoughts, so he just shrugged it off but decided that Danny wasn&#39;t a good candidate. Now, who else was a hot, aggressive guy that wasn&#39;t entirely straight... wait! Terry suddenly got an idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I got it. Let&#39;s ask Tristan. After his car broke down last month, he really needs the money, and I just happen to have 100 dollars to spend on my friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tristan? Isn&#39;t he straight? Are you sure he&#39;ll do that for me, even for money? And are you sure you really want to pay that for me? And...&quot; But before Gabe could ask any more questions, Terry placed a finger on his friend&#39;s lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey now, no more questions, Gabey. Honestly, don&#39;t know if Tristan will agree, but if he doesn&#39;t, we&#39;ll just think of something else. And don&#39;t worry about it, just paying back a friend for last night.&quot; Though Terry was also hoping he could buy a favor from Tristan or his friend, too.<br />
<br />

Jackson was feeling a bit uncomfortable at school. Not only did he feel like he didn&#39;t really belong here for some reason, but he kept hearing people whispering behind his back. They were probably whispering because he completely shaved his head, right? Not many bald men around this school aside from the teachers and that one Black dude. The now older man was about to yell at them to stop, but it seems like someone beat him to the punch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Jackson just shaved his head! Nothing strange here, just shut up and get to class.&quot; Jackson&#39;s savior was none other than Sam, and he was looking strange.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, thanks for that, Sam... I guess? Uh, say, have you been dyeing your hair?&quot; Usually, Jackson would have told off Sam for defending him because he could defend himself just fine. However, with all the weirdness going on, he was just too weirded out to be petty. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh, no, I haven&#39;t. I guess all that time in the sun has been bleaching my hair.&quot; The look on Jackson&#39;s face made it clear that he didn&#39;t believe Sam&#39;s explanation, but he&#39;ll just roll with that explanation for now. Not that Sam was paying attention to that. He was too busy checking out Jackson&#39;s body while trying to be discrete about it and telling himself that he wasn&#39;t doing it in a gay way. Was Jackson even more muscular than yesterday night? He really wanted to take a closer look to make sure &quot;Uh, anyway, you know, I&#39;ve been slacking in the gym lately. So, why don&#39;t we hit the weight room during our free period during 2nd period?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, sure sounds good,&quot; Jackson replied. He did usually worked out in the weight room during his free period on Mondays anyway. With all the weirdness he&#39;s been feeling lately, doing something normal was just what he needed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice, I&#39;ll meet at 2nd period then.&quot;<br />
<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
Danny left Calculus class feeling oddly refreshed. Probably because everyone was slightly distracted by their changes. It was subtle, but Danny noticed things that included people getting distracted, touching their new muscles, or whispering about their changing bodies. He even managed to overhear some murmuring from Shen and Kevin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, have you been working out? Your arms look bigger...&quot; Kevin said to Shen.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no... are you? You&#39;re looking more... solid? Is that the right word for it?&quot;  Shen replied, and Kevin shook his head. &quot;I&#39;ve read puberty can last up until a person&#39;s early twenties. So, maybe we&#39;re just late bloomers?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... Maybe.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two nerds were progressing nicely. Danny couldn&#39;t wait until he wasn&#39;t the only Asian Adonis at the school. He also couldn&#39;t wait until Mr. Ito becomes an Asian Adonis as well. He decided that the teacher&#39;s transformation would last until Friday, so there would need to track him down on the weekend. Another Asian Adonis for the students to look up to.<br />
<br />
Anyway, now that it was about to be second period, Danny decided to find Jackson for observations. Before they fell out, they used to work out together in the weight rooms on Mondays, so he probably still be there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wonder how old Jackson will be today? Old enough to be confused for a teacher, perhaps? Hehe.&quot;</p>
