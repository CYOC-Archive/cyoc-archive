<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Why are you so silent, you are ok right?” looking towards her device to check his mental well being, then looking back after noticing nothing out the ordinary.<br />
 <br />
“I’m ok” a quiet voice came from the toilet.<br />
 <br />
“That’s not all I asked” repeating herself once more.<br />
 <br />
“I can’t make up my mind, honestly I’ve gotten used to the taste, the smell yet, at the back of my mind, I just can’t accept that I like this, who would like this” trying as good as he could at expressing his emotions.<br />
 <br />
“You do, there are people for every inanimate object you can imagine, they experience bliss from all types of forms, from the simple, toasters, ovens, microwave, to huge diggers, cruise ships hell even a space station. It is just apart of the structure of our brain, we never wired ourselves, don’t be ashamed”. as she expressed what others had enjoyed..<br />
 <br />
Without an answer Philip awaited more.<br />
 <br />
“Yes, but I will be honest, never have we had a Disabled toilet like yourself be the perfect job, we have employed quite a number of normal toilets but you are unique. Which is why I must ask I hope you continue with this position, we can make it worth your while. She said proudly.<br />
 <br />
“What do you mean” not knowing if he could be brought, yet influenced by the offer.<br />
 <br />
“Well to take this role permanently would require you to stay here 24 hours, 5 days a week we will offer a protection to your lifespan, you will not age at all during your employed hours, allowing you to live a complete full life outside of this bathroom, using our technology, we will ensure your life is extended for as long as you desire, free of illness for yourself and a significant other, along with a quarter of a million salary, with 36 days paid leave for holidays and personal days.” she said hoping to persuade him.<br />
 <br />
“That sounds very impressive, but I need some time to think it over” he asked.<br />
 <br />
“Well we could extend it overnight, once we begin the revert process its over as you verbally not wanting to continue will corrupt any future data we might collect, so I hate to say it but we can extend it but it will be then or never” she said with a serious look on her face.<br />
 <br />
“Lets extend it” he said softly<br />
 <br />
Entering information into her device once more, before looking at Philip with a smile, “I’ll see you in the morning it will be much earlier than usual at 6am before the sun comes up but no longer” with a hopeful smile she once again vanished from view.<br />
 <br />
“Why can’t I decided, why do I fight on so much, those offers she wanted to give me, possible immortality for me and a loved one plus quarter of a million!, shit… It sounds too good” he continued to muse to himself over the experiences of the week the good and bad weighting them together in his head, “No job is perfect, a job is meant to be hard work, yet I have gotten use to it, can I admit that, I’m just a toilet..? I’m not sure I can do that” Philip continued fighting himself as he drifted off to sleep.<br />
 <br />
Philip found himself near a busy road his body appeared translucent as he hovered nearby, cars were going around a large high speed roundabout, he watched as a car going too fast around the bend lost control slamming into a car that had already indicated to switch lanes, “She looks familiar but I can’t remember who..”, watching in horror as the cars collided the scene changed to a mother and daughter at an ambulance scene, the girl was young but incredibly injured compared to the mother. “What the hell do something!” Philip cried out.<br />
 <br />
“She’s dead, we can’t do anything for her, get the mother to the hospital she has a severe neck trauma” the paramedic said, Philip watched as the world around him faded white.<br />
 <br />
Appearing in the bathroom at Cloudfield Hospital, he floated to the stall where he had spent the last week. With his thoughts drifting back to the accident, “What happened there?” Philip wondered as he phased through his stall door, “Why is there an out of order sign and the pipe, its blocked off” he looked around reading more out of order signs.<br />
 <br />
Suddenly the door to the bathroom opened, come I want to apologise for the lack of facilities here but Cloudfield hospital is a charity, we rely on donations to function with a slight amount of state support from the local trusts.” Making his way over to the entrance Philip, knew this nurse it was the handler for the heaviest resident at the hospital<br />
 <br />
Looking in the obese lady&#39;s face, Philip realised, “Its her, she was in the accident!”. he realised.<br />
 <br />
“Yes but I need to feel normal, I don’t want a bed side toilet, using it in the ward makes me feel ashamed, its not my fault I was in that accident, I lost my daughter and damaged my pituitary gland, blowing me up to this” as her eyes watered as she struggled her way past him.<br />
 <br />
“You will have to use this middle one its normal size but try to be careful” the nurse said with the look of worry on her face.<br />
 <br />
Making her way inside Philip watched as her body pressed against all side of the stall moving the entire frame from side to side as she struggled onto the toilet. Raising her gown she lowered herself on to the toilet, unable to close the door due to her size as the nurse turned around.<br />
 <br />
Philip watched in pity, “This lady she has struggled for so long, to an accident…” he was overcome with shame with what he called her, he felt selfish for the first time from his transformations. “I would have got flushed eventually” sighing as he couldn’t look away.<br />
 <br />
With an audible groaning noise the toilet then suddenly expanded into a shattering noise as the porcelain exploded to pieces across the bathroom floor spilling water over the patient as she fell forward hitting her head as she went into a epileptic fit.<br />
 <br />
“Shit” the nurse said loudly as she darted to the alert button hitting it as a blue light flashed as Philip watched on in horror as the scene flashed white once more.<br />
 <br />
“Wake up, you in there?” a strange voice said,<br />
 <br />
“Huh”, Philip said grudgingly looking up to seeing Lohse,<br />
 <br />
“You was dreaming silly” looking down at her device when suddenly, she looked directly at him. “You somehow subconsciously tapped into the Chronivac’s temporal options, they were locked out, how did you overcome them, did you travel in time, the readings are all over the place are you ok?” with a worried tone to her voice.<br />
 <br />
“I’m ok, I saw the biggest resident here, she had an accident due to there being no toilet like me here, I saw her struggle, the pain, the loss she suffered, she will never be normal again will she? Philip said softly overcome with sorrow at what he just saw.<br />
 <br />
“You might be thinking why can’t we help her, I’m just employed by Transdem Labs, I don’t get to pick who gets the device, we can’t target others to cure disease, end poverty, end war or suffering. I’ve wished it was that simple” Lohse said in trying to make Philip feel better.<br />
 <br />
“The jobs we pick are determined by a machine, there are many empty jobs out there that wait years again before it is selected again, this hospital was without a Disability Toilet for 3 years due to them being a charity…..” Lohse said as she was interrupted.<br />
“Make it full time” Philip said quickly.<br />
 <br />
“What, are you sure?” Lohse said taken back.<br />
 <br />
“Make it full time, but I have one extra request, make a donation anonymously every year to this place, help them.<br />
 <br />
“I will make the request, hold on” Lohse said as she entered information into her device, suddenly it pinged “We have a yes, how does half a million sound?”<br />
 <br />
“More” Philip said bluntly.<br />
 <br />
“Ok, wow they really do want you, they will give 2.5 million to this hospital yearly if you accept now, they won’t go any higher. Lohse said looking bewildered at the current negotiations.<br />
 <br />
“Then lets do it, start me today I also want to be here when I’m needed even on weekends if they require me” he said confidently.<br />
 <br />
“Thank you, its means a lot to us and as you know everyone in this hospital I’m just glad you came around” she said with a smile.<br />
 <br />
“Its easy to think of the people around you as being beneath you, especially people at this hospital, I saw humanity and the lost, the suffering, I may enjoy myself here, but at least I have a purpose. Philip continued on with a speech about empathy to Lohse, who could only listen.<br />
 <br />
“Before I go, there are two questions I’d like to ask, Are you the toilet now?” she asked shyly.<br />
 <br />
“I guess so, you should hop aboard” he told her with a chuckle.<br />
 <br />
“That was the second question”, she said toying with her hair.<br />
 <br />
“Oh, you have to look the part to use me Missy” Philip said with glee<br />
 <br />
“Well I came prepared” Lohse said holding up the device in her hand as she entered details into it.<br />
 <br />
“Say when” with a final push of the button, Philip eyed Lohse as her body began to expand rapidly, her body stretched her cloths to the limits as she burst out of them, removing her shoes and cloths quickly as she tossed them aside standing nakedly before him,as she entered information into the device once more as they disintegrated into nothingness.<br />
 <br />
Philip could only stare she continued to expanded as she entered his stall, “Not enough yet?” she said approaching 250lbs. Philip had never saw anyone else transform before but seeing her body alter in such a way was a huge turn on.<br />
 <br />
“Oh look here you like me getting big, maybe that is part of the reason” she said curiously as her belly developed a hang slowly drooping past her vagina as her hips continued to expand as her butt ballooned behind her.<br />
 <br />
“Maybe, but keep going”, Philip felt as if he was drooling at the sight before him but he realised he was bubbling the water in his bowl.<br />
 <br />
Lohse continued to gain weight her breasts continued to expand along with the rest of her as she placed the device on the floor, “Wow I’ve never done anything like this before” she said as she jiggled her body as it began to ooze between her hands, grasping at her developing folds of fat. Pushing 400lb her hips began to go ahead of her body as her belly developed into an apron and her thighs becoming thick cellulite ridden tree trunks.<br />
 <br />
“You look pretty but your not ready for me yet” Philip knew what he found attractive was changing, “Was this what I was denying?” he thought to himself.<br />
 <br />
Both of them looked down at her feet as her calves began to flow over the sides of her feet, becoming truly fat as they oozed around them, looking upward her thighs had began to brush against the stall as she approached 800lbs, her butt had become a shelf as her breasts hung from her chest, her belly continued to approach her knees. “I never knew I was such a pear”, She said with humour, rubbing her hands over her hips, as she moaned to herself, “Mmmm, so soft” biting her lip.<br />
 <br />
“You do look sweet, don’t stop for me, take seat.” he said luring her inside.<br />
 <br />
With a smile, she entered brushing the walls as she turned to sit, lowering herself forward as she held onto the handles on either side. Her butt in full view as she twerked it as it continued to ballooned closer and closer to his tank, before pressing against it. “Your smothering me…ah..” Philip moaned out.<br />
 <br />
“I knew you’d like that, Is it big enough for you?” she said seductively.<br />
 <br />
“Yes, your teasing me… so badly..”, Philip was on the edge, he wanted to release, it was beyond foreplay.<br />
 <br />
“Such a big toilet you are” she said playfully.<br />
 <br />
“Yes, mamm” he replied.<br />
 <br />
“Maybe your too small for me huh?” Placing her arms to either side of her very large breasts lifting them towards him.<br />
 <br />
“No mamm, I can hold up to 2000lbs, plus I’m special”. he said with glee.<br />
 <br />
“Well then lets take a seat” Lohse said as she finally sat on him. Philip felt her full weight the sensations of her body covering his form excited him, she continued to expand as her butt began to flow over his seat on all sides, her belly continued to droop past her knees, spreading them apart as her belly fell as it smacked against the front of Philips bowl<br />
 <br />
“Ahhhhh” came from Philip “You must really have a fat fetish” she said giggling while rubbing her own form.<br />
 <br />
It was becoming difficult to see for Philip as her body continued to expand past the largest lady in the hospital. “Let me help you out, a gift” she said entering information once more his view suddenly shifting to the mirror allowing him to look directly from the it to his user. “Lohse your beautiful you can stop if you want” he said over come with lust.<br />
 <br />
“I’m not done yet” she coyed.<br />
 <br />
“Philip felt like he was aching to blow his load, his form continued to pulsate as her hips continued drooping down his sides. As her butt began to eat up the view from his tank. She was becoming beyond obese, a blob on him.<br />
 <br />
“We have touch down!” she praised, as her stomach oozed across the tile floor, “God I’m so fat, maybe I should stay in the hospital for awhile, for extra help..” she said as she moved her fingers seductively across his form.<br />
 <br />
As she continued to fill his stall, her body had began to distort the stall walls around her as she began to look less human. “I think that&#39;s enough” she said as the device stopped. “Want to know my weight big guy? She said once more seductively.<br />
 <br />
“What?” he said eager to know.<br />
 <br />
“2000lbs” she said with a sweet smile<br />
 <br />
“Lohse I want you so bad”, he felt that if she flushed him he wouldn’t stop.<br />
 <br />
“I need you sweety” she said placing her arms of her hips, adjusting her self ready as she jiggled all over. “Yes mamm”, he said knowing full well he was completely dominated.<br />
 <br />
“Just one question” as she placed the device on her vast stomach<br />
 <br />
“Yes Lohse?” he wondered.<br />
 <br />
“What are you?” she asked moving up and down rubbing against his tank..<br />
 <br />
“I’m a hum..” he tried saying<br />
 <br />
“No, say again” She said sounding annoyed.<br />
 <br />
“I’m the disability toilet at Cloudfield Hospital” he said sounding more confident.<br />
 <br />
“Say again, but a simpler description would do” she said as she taxed his sensations.<br />
 <br />
“I’m a toilet” he said softly<br />
 <br />
“Again and louder” as she started to grunt.<br />
 <br />
“I’M A TOILET!” he yelled, all resistance melting away as his patron slapped, rubbed and bounced all over his form, as he neared the edge.<br />
 <br />
“What should a toilet do?” she demanded.<br />
 <br />
“Accept waste!” Philip said eagerly with pure lust.<br />
 <br />
“Now open wide, I want you to feel your form, see your mouth wide open, accept it”<br />
 <br />
“I AM A….TOILET!” shouting once more, accepting the body map truly in his head, his mouth was agape he moved his sight to his bowl noticing he could see in the dark now even without light, the anus was above him, “Beautiful” knowing full well the gifts it would bring.<br />
 <br />
With one final grunt Lohse unleashed a torrent of waste that would be expected of someone at her size. It sprayed everywhere in his bowl, “This is…” overcome with bliss Philip knew this was it, “It was always going to happen, this was the job I was meant to do” telling himself.<br />
 <br />
Lohse continued to push more excrement and urine into his bowl unloading her vast stomach, as the waterline rose completely to the very brim, then suddenly stopping.<br />
 <br />
“Well love you really are a toilet” as she entered information into her device allowing her form to being to recede to normal.<br />
 <br />
“God your so beautiful, you should stick around, tell others to come use me” he said bubbling through the mountain of waste.<br />
 <br />
“Well aren&#39;t you eager all of a sudden with such a mouthful” she said as she slowly gained the strength to raise to her feet.<br />
 <br />
“Its ok cause I’m a..” Philip said suddenly cutting himself off.<br />
 <br />
What are you again? Lohse demanded once more.<br />
 <br />
“A Toilet” he said<br />
 <br />
“Will you keep in touch, this was quite special, maybe we could talk sometime”, trying his best to entice her interest.<br />
 <br />
“Well I know you can take my shit, I’m pretty dominant” she said with a smirk on her face.<br />
 <br />
“I’m a pretty submissive toilet” he said as they both laughed.<br />
 <br />
“Right you are, I’ll come and visit you here, I may even pretend to need help, a bit of role play can go a long way.” she said as she played with her own tummy.<br />
 <br />
Philip bubbled the waste in his bowl making Lohse giggle<br />
 <br />
“Well its getting a bit smelly in here and I’m almost back to normal.”, she said as she relaxed into her slender form once more.<br />
 <br />
“Flush me” Philip demanded.<br />
 <br />
“The big toilet wants to be flushed, aww…” she said playfully moving her hands across his seat and handle, fondling his form as she continued teased him.<br />
 <br />
“So toilet you ready for your first flush of your new life?” she said as she gripped his handle.<br />
 <br />
“Flush” he eagerly awaited.<br />
 <br />
With an audible sound overcoming the entire bathroom, Philip moans echoed through the bathroom as Lohse dance and bounced all over Philips seat.<br />
 <br />
“Well I best be off, since you delayed it for the night we have timed skipped the weekend so you will spend the next five days as a toilet”<br />
 <br />
“I’m eager” he said excitedly.<br />
 <br />
“You mean you’re a toilet” she said fondling his handle<br />
 <br />
“Awww, do it again” he said wanting to return to the bliss once more.<br />
 <br />
“I won’t waste water, this place is a charity remember?” she said, almost teasing him. “Now I want you to say one last thing for me, I am the toilet” she requested.<br />
 <br />
“I am the toilet” he said as his form shined across his surface with a clean, healthy, welcoming look.<br />
 <br />
“Perfect well I’m off see you soon” she said with a wink as she vanished from view.<br />
 <br />
“I guess I can’t help myself, I really am this toilet, now I have such a long life, it is worth? Yes just I hope Lohse comes to visit me often, or anyone hugely fat…, I’m ready fill me with your waste, cause I am the toilet” he said proudly one last time as his ability to speak aloud vanished.<br />
 <br />
Drifting off back to sleep, Philip dreamt of water, flushing and Lohse getting fatter beyond the stall, covering him completely. With a final flush he awoke once more.<br />
 <br />
The door to the bathroom unlocked as the sounds of many heavy people entered the bathroom, queueing up for the large toilet at the end. “I wonder how my home will be while I’m here” he thought as they continued to approach.</p>
