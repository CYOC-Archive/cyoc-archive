<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;We can swim very well... and our diapers are water proof!&quot; Barry The Dolphin said.<br />
<br />
Sammy innocently lend down and poked Barry&#39;s diaper, result in a giggle from the dolphin baby fur, which resulted in Sammy and Jessy giggling too.<br />
<br />
&quot;So can you talk to fishies, and whales and dolphins?&quot; Jessy repeated.<br />
<br />
Barry shrugged. &quot;I tried, a lot, we all tried. But none of them seem any smarter than before. Except the sharks don&#39;t even try to eat us when we get right close.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So none of the animals became sen-tea-ant, they just became nicer to us,&quot; Sammy said. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot; Barry nodded. &quot;But we&#39;ve been REALLY able to improve the show! Either you been to sea world before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope!&quot; Sammy and Jessy said and giggled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well! Now we can take part in the show, not just our pets! And like I said, we don&#39;t need to worry about them hurt anyone! And because we can take part, we get to have lots of fun swimming too! We&#39;ve been coming up with new acts for every friend! And because we&#39;re all wearing diapers, no one need to worry about a bathroom break!&quot; <br />
<br />
Sammy and Jessy nodded at this obvious improvement to the show. <br />
<br />
&quot;And stuff cleans up mostly after itself now, and the food and snacks never need stocking, and nobody ever gets sun burned! It&#39;s great! Oh I&#39;ve said this lots of times to new guests already! Come on you two! Let me show you around!&quot; Barry took Jessy and Sammy&#39;s paws as he led them through the gates where they got their paws stamped. Several other aquatic baby furs doing the same with other guests. <br />
<br />
Money from what Sammy was seeing, was becoming mostly a game to baby furs, promises were the real currency of the land. <br />
<br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
(Un)luckily for Amy The Armadillo, the only baby fur on the bus was the driver, and she didn&#39;t want to distract him. True, baby furs according to the revised laws of reality couldn&#39;t be hurt in such accidents, but she didn&#39;t want to inconvenience them by having to fix the bus (that might take, like, five or maybe even ten minutes if it was a really bad crash).<br />
<br />
She Amy found herself thinking. <br />
<br />
Perhaps it would be kinder if Sammy The Fox and Jessy The Raccoon never reached the first fur, Amy The Armadillo thought. Sammy was Amy&#39;s friend after all, she didn&#39;t want to see him hurt. Not hurt as in boo-boos. <br />
<br />
She admired Sammy for the whole &#39;wanting Not-Friends to consciously chose be friends&#39; thing. And the whole &#39;give baby furs a handle on their super powers&#39;. After all, she&#39;d wanted the exact same thing. She&#39;d gone to meet the first fur the exact same reason. Like others who&#39;d gone to visit her. <br />
<br />
Maybe baby furs like Amy and Sammy were another bug, then again, baby furs hadn&#39;t ever been meant to be robots, that all mindlessly thought the same thing anyway. <br />
<br />
But there had been a bug. The not-friends, nor the baby furs, were NEVER supposed to be aware of the changes that were happening. It was supposed to be painless and seamless and oblivious. <br />
<br />
That not-friends and babyfurs were both mostly aware of the changes (not-friends more than baby furs) greatly complicated matters. <br />
<br />
&#39;There are times and fates we can&#39;t defy Sammy, and if we try, it&#39;ll just cause misery for not us, but for everyone. Some things are bigger than our personal choices, some things are bigger than a country, or a planet, or a universe.&#39; Amy thought somewhat slightly-not-babyfur thoughts. Being exposed to the truth of why babyfurs existed, had that effect. Amy knew she was a weaker link the chain became of it. But knew Sammy would be MORE unhappy if he wasn&#39;t allowed to see the first fur, and he wouldn&#39;t be just a weaker link the chain, but a broken one if he wasn&#39;t allowed to follow his heart as a baby fur should. <br />
<br />
Maybe after Sammy had met with the first fur, he and Amy could hang out some more, since both would have learned THE truth then. Not the little details Amy was thinking of now. THE truth at least would likely fly over Jessy&#39;s head, not because she was now stupid, baby furs were as innocent as freshly fallen snow, but not dummies, but such things would be outside Jessy&#39;s context. <br />
<br />
The bus stopped, and on came a lion and lioness baby furs, followed by a donkey, mule, and elephant baby furs, all of them had on ties too big for them on and carried briefcases that were looked more like lunch boxes with the happy cartoon characters on them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, I&#39;m Amy The Armadillo.&quot; She greeted her friends she was meeting for the first time. Happy to see her fellow furs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi! I&#39;m Bucky The Lion!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m Loran The Lion!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m Jack The Elephant!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m Huey The Donkey!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m Lew The Mule.&quot; &quot;We&#39;re all Sen-actors!&quot; They echoed and burst out laughing, which made the driver and Amy burst out laughing too. <br />
<br />
On the way to the capital, they began passing through one military check point after another, all manned by baby furs in camo-colored diapers and armed with squirt guns. After all, they&#39;d been given orders to guard this spot, and they were gonna follow orders. That they&#39;d been not-friends when given those orders, and were supposed to guard them from baby furs, was slightly lost on them. As it was, check points had been set up one after another, only several yards from each other. And the baby fur soldiers of coursed radioed in their arrival. <br />
<br />
The last check point was still manned by Not-Friends, but with another one being set up ahead for when the inevitable happened. The human soldiers took one look at the bus... and the baby fur sen-actors waved. The soldiers didn&#39;t transform, but they did wave back. It was against the law to hold a congressman or senator for minor crimes, and there was obviously no crime in wearing a diaper or being little or having fur. So the guards politely let them through. A vast change from when there had been a single digit amount of baby furs in the world, and the police and soldiers had tried to shoot them.<br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
Sammy and Jessy sat in their seat, sitting next to a baby fur hound-dog with a bow tie on the front of his diaper, and baby girl fur shrew with a large bow on her diaper. Their names were Fred The Hound Dog and Steph The Shrew. <br />
<br />
They admitted they&#39;d actually been spies for another country before becoming Friends, and didn&#39;t really feel like spying anymore. <br />
<br />
Sammy and Jessy clasped paws as Barry did a summersault out of the water while riding Free Willy! It made Sammy think about Jessy&#39;s idea of the First Fur being able to &#39;upgrade&#39; certain baby furs. But whatever, Sammy was having fun right now! The entire audience laughed and clapped as a splash covered the entire plastic bleachers with a wave of water, soaking them. They didn&#39;t feel chills, and their diapers only stayed soggy for a short time before they cleaned themselves. Sammy felt truly happy.</p>
