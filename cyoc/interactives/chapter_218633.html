<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rachel held her breath as she turned and looked down the path they had just walked down from. Her new neon blue eyes widened as she saw someone who looked almost exactly like the typical devil she would see in media.<br />
<br />
He was a giant, had to be at least 9 or 10 feet tall, with curving goat horns going out of his long pitch-black hair which was pulled back into a short ponytail. That hair style was a little odd and made him look almost like a hipster one would see at a coffee shop. His face was harsh but there was some kindness in those features as well as a second set of horns smaller grew out cheek bones and arched upwards. His skin was bright red, and more spikes came out of the top of his shoulder blades. <br />
<br />
He was heavier than Rachel thought he would be, but he was heavy in the way that a NFL linemen was heavy, all of it appeared to be muscles. His arms were massive, and each hand had short but deadly looking claws and spikes on each of his knuckles. He wore a black robe with a pure white slash over all of it which was odd. A giant pair of bats like wings came out of his back and rested on his shoulders with small mini clawed hands at the tips. His legs were like Maisy, goat like with cloven feet but instead of a deer like tail, a thick tail which looked to be pure muscle as well moved back and forth as he moved through the garden. <br />
<br />
“Charon.” yelled Maisy in a happy voice as the devil looked at her and smiled, a warm smile.<br />
<br />
“My Bad.” said Astaroth with a shrug. “In my defense, Charon looks very much like my brother.”<br />
<br />
Rachel nodded in understand, some confused her brother with her father from time to time, they looked a lot alike.<br />
<br />
“Miasma, how is my favorite little sister.” laughed the demon as Rachel began to understand, this wasn’t lucifer it was one of Maisy’s Brother.<br />
<br />
“I am currently your only little sister.” laughed Maisy <br />
<br />
“Your parents did have a run of boys before you came along little Miasma.” Said a female voice as coming out from behind Charon. <br />
<br />
She was breathtakingly beautiful, her milk chocolate color skin looked perfect smooth and without a blemish. Her neck was long and elegant with perfect black curls falling around her eyes, which Rachel noticed was a pinkish lavender. Her body would have made a super model look like one of the ugliest people on the planet. She wasn’t as tall as Charon but she was taller then a normal human. Out of her back came a pair of angelic wings, they where the same color as her eyes, a beautiful pinkish lavender color. She gave off a warm glow which stood in stark contrast to everything around her, a faint lavender color halo hovered above her head. She wore a robe much like Charon, only hers was impossibly white with a single strand of black. <br />
<br />
“Charon, Remeila?” said Maisy “What are you two doing down here?”<br />
<br />
“Well, Mom invited us to join you and dad for dinner with Rachel.” explained Charon “Considering we are the only one beside you Rachel has meet.”<br />
<br />
“Wait…I know you?” inquired Rachel <br />
<br />
“I knew she wouldn’t recognize us in our true form.” said Remeila as her body began to shift and within a few moments a beautiful looking woman but a normal looking human women stood before everyone in a pair of jeans and a white T-shirt. Rachel’s eyes widened as she recognized the women.<br />
<br />
“Mariana?” said Rachel as her mouth fell open before she pointed at Charon. “Chris?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, that is the names we went by when we had dinner with you a couple of months ago.” Answered Remeila as she transformed back into her true form. “However I am really Remeila 12th daughter of God, lord of Heaven, creator of the Earth and….you get the idea, I am not going to list off all the titles my father has given himself it would take forever.”<br />
<br />
“Wait…you’re the daughter of God and your married to the son of the devil?” inquired Rachel as both Charon and Remeila nodded their heads. <br />
<br />
“It is because of them that Heaven and Hell are at peace, they had a sort of Romeo and Juliet thing back in 300 ac in Rome right?” inquired Prince Leviathan <br />
<br />
“Yes, but without both lovers dying in the end.” confirmed Charon <br />
<br />
“Charon here is the most radical demon in the underworld, he married an angle, gave up his land to rule to his younger brother and forever changed the relationship between Heaven, Hell and the mortal world.” Explained Princess Astaroth. “Now he and his wife, rule Purgatory together managing the cycle of making new souls for Earth and sending back souls board with Heaven back to be reborn on Earth.”<br />
<br />
“Hard to call me a radical, Aunt Astaroth when you’re the only one of the great lords and ladies to never marry or have any children.” countered Charon as Astaroth shrugged.<br />
<br />
“I had a human once; I fell in love with a long time ago but she was too afraid to admit her feels for another women yet alone a demon and ended up marrying some abusive religious prick.” Stated Astaroth <br />
<br />
“I didn’t know you went to Earth Aunt Astaroth?” inquired Maisy as the angelic demon looked up toward where the mortal plane would be. “When was this?”<br />
<br />
“A couple of years before you where born, went up there found love but…” started Astaroth before shaking her head. “Never mind, where is my brother.”<br />
<br />
“Right here.” Said a voice, a deep powerful voice as Rachel paused and looked back toward the walking path to see the Devil himself, Lucifer King of Hell standing there. <br />
 <br />
He and his son Charon did look a lot of a like, Lucifer however had to be at least half a foot taller, wasn&#39;t as built but as his son but clearly very strong. He lacked the second set of horns on the side of his face, but he gave off a much wise and serious look then his hipster looking son. His goat horns, however, was much longer with a burning crown of fire hovering above them. His chest was bare and looked like it was carved from pure marble. He lacked the extra spikes on his hands as his son but his claws were longer and seemed to be sharper. He wore a black metal breast plate with the pentagram symbol on it in red gold and his goat like legs where bare aside from a thick chainmail cloth over his privates. He had a long-forked tail which rested on the ground. <br />
<br />
Standing beside him, dressed in a lacy black corset with a thin skirt which looked almost like it came from ancient Greece or Rome was Lilith. She had done several golden rings and bracelets and looked elegant.<br />
<br />
There was a third figure, a much smaller female figure in a pink dress which ran up to Charon and Remelia on goat like feet while a pair of golden horns came out of her head before moving gently through her black curls. A pair of angle wings, one black one white came out of her back.<br />
<br />
“Mommy...Daddy, Grandma and Grandpa where showing me some of the new trees they got.” Said the little girl as Remelia smiled as she picked up the little girl. <br />
<br />
“That’s great sweety, are you ready to eat?” inquired Remelia as the girl nodded her head. <br />
<br />
“You remember Aunt Maisy and her girlfriend Rachel, we meet them a few months ago.” Said Charon as Rachel remembered that Chris and Mariana had a four-year-old daughter who had been a terror when they had gone out to eat to meet. <br />
<br />
“Yes, she was nice to me.” Said the girl “Gave me some of her chicken at dinner.”<br />
<br />
“Nice to meet you again, little one.” Said Rachel as she decided to focus on the little girl, not Lucifer who was coming ever closer to her. She could handle little girls. <br />
<br />
Then it hit her, this little girl was the granddaughter of both God and the Devil. <br />
<br />
“You must be Rachel.” Said Lucifer as he came to a stop a few feet away from Rachel.<br />
<br />
“Yes, dad this is Tenebra but she prefers to go by her human name of Rachel.” Said Maisy “Rachel, this is my father, Lucifer Morning Star, King of Hell, Lord of the Dark lands. The Fallen one, the bringer of pain and lord of all Damned souls for all time.”<br />
<br />
“Your majesty.” Said Rachel as she cutesy, no one had told her if that was the right thing to do or not but she wasn’t going to stare the devil in the eyes right away, that would have been rude and one cutesy before Kings and Queen&#39;s don&#39;t they or bowed at least. <br />
<br />
“Well, lets put all the formal name and titles to the side for the moment, you want to marry my daughter and while I do trust her judgment, I need to know you better before giving my blessing.” stated Lucifer<br />
<br />
“I understand, I am an unknown and no offense all I know about you is what the human world knows and that seams to be very little.” stated Rachel as she took a bold leap. “I wish to know more, maybe we can learn about each other together.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe we will.” Confirmed Lucifer with a slight smile. “Let’s do that while we eat shall we, they should have the table set up on the other side of the tree by now.”</p>
