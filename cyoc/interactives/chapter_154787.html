<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chester got Brittney into the living room with Ashley and so he was left just standing there and watching as the events played out - he had not even known when he had sex with her that this was going to happen, and considering all he had heard of pregnancy, it made him wish he&#39;d been more careful. &quot;Oh...oh fuck...!&quot; Indeed, as he said those exact words he watched as Ashley went into labor not long after, herself dealing with the effects of sex with Chester.<br />
<br />
They were just poised there on the floor in the middle of the living room, the screaming and the shouting and the noise horrifying Chester and confusing him. He had never seen anything like this, and it came off to him like a horror movie. He wanted to do---do something, anything, but he couldn&#39;t. Chester could only sit there and watch events play out.<br />
<br />
So, despite having the masterful and powerful physique of a young bodybuilder, Chester was left feeling distinctly powerless as he watched events unfold. He was going to be a father, despite barely even knowing what it was like to be a man. He only knew fucking, and sex, and the amazing feeling in his muscles. What could he even DO for a child!?<br />
<br />
And then Brittney&#39;s child was born - by no means a clean or easy birth right there on the bed right next to Ashley, who did not seem that far behind. The child wailed and cried as it pushed through her vagina itself, seeming possessed of some unnatural disposition of determination that drove it forward. Chester watched the placenta and umbilical cord still connected to the baby - and his unfamiliarity with it only heightened his horror.<br />
<br />
&quot;B-Brittney!?&quot; Chester saw that Brittney was barely conscious, and he desperately looked around. Tried to think - tried to find something he could do... and he stopped when he looked at Brittney&#39;s child. He saw the child wailing and then continuing to grow. Continuing to AGE. He realized what this meant. Maybe...maybe on some level the sex had written that odd ability of that stuff into the kids. Accelerated their development and---<br />
<br />
Chester pressed himself against the living room wall and choked down a scream of his own as he watched the baby&#39;s hair growing in as it quickly grew - and he started to realize the baby, still covered in blood, ooze and such, was a boy. It was growing bright blond hair stained by the red of blood, brown eyes, and a light countenance. The child seemed to tug at the umbilical cord still connected to it, and even as it aged further it seemed the soap had ingrained some accelerated mental development as well.<br />
<br />
Chester gasped as he saw the child reach age eight after spacing out for a bit, and heard the child speak, &quot;W-What&#39;s happenin&#39; to me!? I&#39;m...I&#39;m your son so...c-can you help me, dad?&quot; The child suddenly groaned and fell to the floor as it aged yet more, growing taller, thinner, becoming less baby and proceeding into the age of 11.<br />
<br />
Another aging pulse brought the child to 12, and he commented, &quot;...Dad...? My body feels funny...oh shit, my brother&#39;s being born!&quot; The child didn&#39;t even seem to know or care that it was still connected to its barely conscious mother by the cord, or that it was standing there in such a state.<br />
<br />
So Chester went and grabbed a towel from the bathroom - which he gave to his son, who seemed to be baffled by it. This confirmed that the child was developing fast, but he didn&#39;t have any conception of human norms or possibly ethics as well.<br />
<br />
Chester didn&#39;t know if the child needed chastisement for speaking such language, but honestly, he didn&#39;t care right now because fuck, this was happening again. Chester watched the other baby be born from a screaming and crying Ashley, and almost instinctively, the towel clad older son helped the younger be born.<br />
<br />
The young bodybuilder-dad felt a sense of wonder at how his son knew the other one was being born, maybe something else was going on too. Astonishing in how careful he was, the now 13 year old son helped his new younger brother be born into the world.<br />
<br />
The sense of reverie was halted by the 13 year old son commenting upon watching his younger brother advance in age and maturity similarly quickly to himself, &quot;Dad? I think...I think I need a name. And also, you need to cut my umbilical cord. W-Well past time for that.&quot; At least it seemed the 13 year old, who seemed tall, lean and strong for his age, was not malevolent - he seemed confused by this all too.<br />
<br />
Chester tapped his head as he went and got the scissors, &quot;Can I call you uh...Matthew?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Call me Matt, dad.&quot; Chester came back with the scissors in time to see Matt tending to his mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be okay mom, I&#39;m out...I&#39;m out...&quot; Chester wanted to feel relieved and glad his son was comforting his mother, but this was all so incredibly bizarre and offputting Chester could only awkwardly chuckle and look to the side.<br />
<br />
It took a few tries and Chester winced at Matt going &quot;Ow fucking ow!&quot;, but the boy&#39;s cord was cut, and Matt awkwardly settled back into his towel covering him up. It seemed the towel was increasingly ill-fitting for young Matt, who looked increasingly like a little league football player.<br />
<br />
13 year old Matt watched with uneasy eyes as his younger brother grew older and older, and stepped in eventually to cut the new brother free too. The child wailed at that and as the boy grew into a similar age to Matt, he calmed a bit and asked, &quot;W-Who are you people? Are you...&quot; He asked at Chester, &quot;...you my dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt replied in a cool tone, &quot;Yeah. Dunno how I know that, but I do. I&#39;m Matt. I was born just a minute before you. Making me the elder brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
The new kid was likewise given a towel to wear while Chester tried to find something else fitting for them, and the smaller, thinner child, who was more auburn haired, gazed at Chester with his light blue eyes, &quot;Dad? Could I ever be as big and buff as you? And uh, what&#39;s my name?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chester stepped into a more parental role and nodded quickly, &quot;You can be...Toby. How&#39;s that sound. And s-sure, I dunno why not, I mean---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t---speak too soon, lil bro...&quot; Matt seemed to be in a sudden state of displeasure, gripping his knees with both hands as he suddenly took a seat on one of the chairs, &quot;Cuz...I think---I think we&#39;re about to age some more...ooh fuck!&quot;</p>
