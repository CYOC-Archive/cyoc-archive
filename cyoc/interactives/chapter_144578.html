<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tobias swatted at a low branch that blocked his path and cursed. For the past couple hours he&#39;d wandered in search of the edge of the forest, signs of another human or anything that would help him get out of the woods. But the only thing he&#39;d managed to discover was the cabin. Now, having found himself once more looking at the same building and having turned away, his stomach growling in hunger, he stalked past the branch he&#39;s smacked. Grumbling about wandering in circles, certain it was Mathew&#39;s fault, he stopped and looked up.<br />
<br />
The sky a mix of dark purple and deep blue, he noted how twilit had been steadily creeping over the forest and he guessed he didn&#39;t have much longer before it was totally dark. Thinking maybe he could take shelter in the cabin, he huffed, &quot;No way,&quot; and pressed on.<br />
<br />
When night finally overtook him, Tobias sank gloomily down and gazed out at the forest. Listening to the sounds of things moving about, animals calling out, he breathed evenly. Thinking, &quot;At least it isn&#39;t raining,&quot; he then considered where the safest place to sleep would be and what he could do for dinner.<br />
<br />
Noises of an animal moving about close by, he froze. Peering into the inky blackness, wishing he had a flashlight, he wrinkled his nose at the smell of wet dog. Scared suddenly of being mauled by a wolf, he tried to force himself to calm down by reassuring himself that, if what he&#39;d gotten a whiff of was accurate, that it was more than likely someone&#39;s pet. Feeling comforted by such a notion, he considered that if it was someone&#39;s pooch, he then concluded that it would mean that the owner wasn&#39;t far behind.<br />
<br />
The animal drawing closer, Tobias slowly stood and waited. Wishing the moon was out, he nearly cried out when something soft brushed against his fingers and a cold, wet nose pushed in his arm an inch or so above his wrist. Hearing a whimper, Tobias breathed a sigh of relief and whispered, &quot;Good doggy,&quot; then, reaching out to pet the animal&#39;s head, he asked, &quot;Can you take me to your master?&quot;<br />
<br />
A whine and as he felt the dog sit, Tobias sighed. Slowly he dropped back down and leaned up against the tree. Reaching over, he started running a hand through the soft fur coat. Stating, &quot;I suppose you&#39;re just as lost as I am,&quot; he found himself slipping into a sense of serenity.<br />
<br />
The dog, in response, uttered a low noise and pressed itself closer. Tobias, breathing in the scent of the animal, no longer thinking it smelled like wet dog, breathed deeply the scent. Still making low noises that he couldn&#39;t explain what they were, Tobias shifted in place and gazed out into the forest, forgetting for the moment that he was lost and hungry. Pressing himself closer to the canine, he gradually turned his head and pressed his face into the fur coat.<br />
<br />
Content to stay like that, feeling relaxed by the smell of the animal, he continued petting the flank a bit longer before he slowly let his hand drop down and underneath the animal. A feeling of arousal coming over him, he brushed his hand against the dog&#39;s erect penis and suddenly realising what he was doing, Tobias sat up.<br />
<br />
Next to him, the pooch shifted and pressed itself closer. Tobias, upon feeling this, looked in the direction of the animal. Bothered by the fact that he had a raging hard-on and by what he&#39;d almost did, he silently swore that, if he didn&#39;t know any better, the critter wanted him to do what he&#39;d been about to do. A nervous, high-pitched laugh escaping him, he listened as the dog whined. The amorous feeling that was washing over him growing, Tobias attempted to stop himself, and instead found himself reaching down and undoing his pants.<br />
<br />
The thought, &quot;This is stupid,&quot; flashing through his mind, he again tried to make himself stop and, as the dog whined in expectancy, Tobias kicked off his shoes and pushed down on his pants and underwear.<br />
<br />
Naked from the waist down, he absently began running a hand through the fur coat. Petting the animal, his hand gradually going lower and lower, he took other hand, reached down and began to work at his erection. Turning so that he was facing the dog, he stopped running his hand through the animal&#39;s fur and instead hooked his arm over it. Drawing it closer, a tingling sensation in his tailbone almost making him stop, Tobias grunted as he pushed his face into the coat and breathed deeply the rich scent.<br />
<br />
A panting noise coming from the dog, Tobias continued working at himself. Silent whimpers of, &quot;Uh,&quot; and, &quot;Oh,&quot; escaping him, he soon found himself on his knees, one hand sticking working at his erection, his face buried deep in the fur of the dog&#39;s belly. Unsure when the dog had laid down on its side, he had a moment of awareness of what he was doing. But then he felt himself climax and stretching, he free hand digging into the forest floor, he pushed his butt out as high up as he could and moaned, &quot;Uh,&quot; as he blew his load. Feeling suddenly spent, he dropped to his side and lay panting heavily, staring into the darkness where he was sure the dog was.<br />
<br />
Unsure why he&#39;d felt so compelled to do what he&#39;d done, embarrassed, but happy there hadn&#39;t been anyone else around, he eventually groaned. Hearing the dog still panting, he fished around in the dark for a moment before finding his clothes. Standing, not even bothering to separate his underwear and pants, Tobias made sure they were facing the right way, then started to pull them on, but stopped the moment something pinched painfully up near his tailbone.<br />
<br />
Fear washing over him, terrified that some hideous leach-thing had somehow latched onto him, he reached back and around grasped at the thing that was keeping him from putting back on his clothes. Feeling not only his hand touching it, but also how it felt warm and flesh like, he whispered, &quot;What the fuck?!&quot;<br />
<br />
The terror he was feeling growing, he traced it from his tailbone down to the tip it ended in. Not liking what he was touching, wanting it gone, he grasped it and yanked as hard as he could. Pain shooting up through the appendage, into his body and spreading outward, Tobias screamed. Hearing the dog leap up and utter a series of noises that he thought sound closer to howls, Tobias began to whimper as he ran his hand over what he was quickly coming to terms with was a tail.<br />
<br />
A sudden urge to cry coming over him, Tobias wailed, &quot;What the fuck is happening,&quot; and cramming the appendage downward until it was tucked between his legs, he pulled up his pants and underwear then began pacing back and forth, trying to figure out how it was possible for him to have grown a tail.</p>
