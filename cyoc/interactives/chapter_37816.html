<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you wander around the store you notice that you're walking like a girl. You shrug and continue without bothering to try to stop walking like a girl. This was so odd being a girl but you're enjoying it. At least you won't be looking at guys wanting to have sex with them. Of course that doesn't mean that you won't be raped. But what are the chances of that happening? You started to wonder what would happen if you did try to leave without paying.<br />
<br />
The sales lady comes around a corner and shows you the costume that she thinks would be perfect for you. You look at it and notice that the whole costume was in a bag on the hanger. What you saw in it was a pearl necklace and what appeared to be a strapless bra with the cups looking like sea shells. &quot;What's this?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't it obvious?&quot; the sales lady asked in return. Before you could answer she said &quot;It's a mermaid costume.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I wanted a costume that would make me male&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you can't tell me that you're not enjoying being a girl&quot; the sales lady said. &quot;I'll make you a deal. If you buy the mermaid costume I'll take half off on the school girl outfit and through in the shoes for free. I'll also throw in a wig so your hair isn't such a boyish cut.&quot;<br />
<br />
You suddenly realize that the shoes would just about break you and you wouldn't be able to afford a second costume. You would still be able to afford a second costume with the deal the sales lady is offering you. It was just too good to pass up. &quot;Alright, I'll take the mermaid costume as well&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent!&quot; the sales lady said. &quot;Now, let's get your wig.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a question on that&quot; you said. &quot;Will it be like real hair?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course it will be&quot; the sales lady said. &quot;Don't worry about being able to take it off. Once you put it on it will switch with your natural hair. It then becomes your natural hair and your natural hair becomes the wig. When you want to switch your hair back just put the wig back on and it will switch back. Here's our wigs. Now let's find the perfect one for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sales lady had been walking while you talked and you followed her. You look at the wide array of wigs that they had. It seemed like they had every imaginable style and color for both male and female. Your eyes were immediately drawn to one that was red, long, and straight. It looked like it would come down to your waist. Noticing which wig you were looking at the sales lady said &quot;I think that one would be perfect for you. Do you want to try it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I do&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
The sales lady led you over to a mirror and put the wig on you. You feel a little tingle in your scalp. You watch in amazement as the wig shortened and changed to brown while your hair grew and changed to red. The tingling stopped and you take the wig off. &quot;Oh that looks good&quot; the sales lady said. &quot;It should really look good with the mermaid costume. Do you want to try that one on now or wait?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I've already committed to buying it so I think I will try it on&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you mind if I watch it?&quot; the sales lady asked. &quot;It's just that I enjoy watching people transform. That's one of the reasons why I took this job.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't it against store policy to do that?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all&quot; the sales lady said. &quot;We do have to ask permission to go into the changing room with a customer however.&quot;<br />
<br />
You think it over. You don't see anything wrong with her request. Then you think of something. &quot;What if another customer comes in?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I'll go take care of them&quot; the sales lady said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, you can watch me transform&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just made my day&quot; the sales lady said. &quot;You're the first customer that allowed me to watch them transform in the changing room.&quot;<br />
<br />
You head back to the changing rooms and intend to go into the one you were in before. However the sales lady directs you to a different one. You mention your clothes that are still in the other room and she goes to collect them and the hanger. When she comes back she says &quot;You'll want to take off your clothes before you take the mermaid costume off it's hanger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thinking that she knew what she was talking about you take off your clothes. When you were naked the sales lady puts everything back on the hanger, pinning the bag with the stockings, bra, and panties to the skirt like they were before. &quot;Ok you can take the mermaid costume off it's hanger now&quot; she said. &quot;You may want to sit down first though.&quot;<br />
<br />
You sat down on the little bench and took the costume off the hanger. You look down to see scales forming around your waist. The scales travel down to your hips and then to your crotch. As it does your legs start to fuse together where the scales are. The scales keep traveling down your legs fusing them together. When they reach your feet they automatically point out to the sides and thin. Your feet also lengthen and form fins the same color as the scales. You are amazed by this transformation. You now have a beautiful golden bronze mermaid tail. Then you see something, or rather don't see something. You don't see your pussy. You also wonder how your going to pee and shit. As if these thoughts summoned it you feel the need to use the restroom. &quot;Do you have a restroom here that I can use?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course but you should put the shells on first&quot; the sales lady said.<br />
<br />
You quickly open the bag containing the costume and put on the shells. To your surprise the sales lady had left while you were putting on the shells and returned with a wheel chair. You were a little confused by this at first then you realized that you couldn't walk with a mermaid tail. The sales lady helped you into the wheel chair and took you to the restroom. The restroom she took you to had a picture of a mermaid on the door. Inside there were no stalls. Instead there were tables with a hole that would be roughly where your crotch area would be if you laid down on them. &quot;This is the restroom?&quot; you asked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's the mermaids restroom&quot; the sales lady said. &quot;A mermaid doesn't go to a restroom like people do. Their waste comes out the front and they need to lay on their stomachs in order to use the restroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I get it now&quot; you say as the sales lady helps you onto one of the tables. After you relieve yourself you say &quot;I didn't see any opening down there though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's because your scales cover the openings&quot; the sales lady said. &quot;That includes your pussy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh&quot; you said as the sales lady helped you back into the wheel chair. She then took you back to the changing room.<br />
<br />
Once back in the changing room you take off the shells and take the school girl costume off the hanger. Your fins become your feet once again. The scales recede in the opposite direction from before. Within seconds your tail is once again your legs. The scales have faded from your body. You once again dress in the school girl outfit and follow the sales lady to pay for your purchases.<br />
<br />
When you had paid for everything you ask &quot;What would have happened if I had tried to leave without paying?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said before, we don't trap our customers in any form&quot; the sales lady said. &quot;That doesn't apply to thieves though. What form they get trapped in varies according to what they would least like to become.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glad I didn't try to walk out then&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So am I&quot; the sales lady said. &quot;You're too cute to be trapped in a form. By the way, my name is Jessica.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you Jessica&quot; you said. You thought that she was hitting on you so you said &quot;Maybe we could do something sometime.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like that&quot; Jessica said. &quot;Though I'm not into girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know that I'm not a girl&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now you are&quot; Jessica said. &quot;But I know what you mean&quot; she added seeing that you were about to say something. &quot;Here's my number. Call me.&quot;<br />
<br />
You look at the number she gave you and see an unfamiliar area code. You're about to ask where this is when she said &quot;I live in Sacramento, California.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was impossible. You lived on opposite coasts. &quot;How can you live in California?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's part of the magic of this mall&quot; Jessica said. &quot;You entered a park and then left again. The park is a gateway to this place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No wonder I didn't recognize anything&quot; you said. &quot;How do I get back home though?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's easy&quot; Jessica said. &quot;Just go back into the park and leave again. You'll be back in your city. The park will always be there for you when you want to come back. You can even bring your friends. Also there is a lake in the middle of the park that's just perfect for merpeople. There's even a mervillage at the bottom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know that?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I have to admit that I've bought a couple of costumes myself&quot; Jessica said. &quot;One is a school boy and the other is a merman. I have a little place in the mervillage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No wonder you were so eager for me to buy the mermaid costume&quot; you said. &quot;You want to share that with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You got it&quot; Jessica said. &quot;I'm off tomorrow if you want to see the mervillage with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
You don't have anything going on tomorrow so you say &quot;I'd love to see it with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great&quot; Jessica said. &quot;Then I'll see you tomorrow at the park lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See you tomorrow&quot; you said as you turn to leave.<br />
<br />
Before you took a step Jessica said &quot;I need to tell you to be careful when you're shopping here. Some of the other stores impart more than slight behavioral modifications. I've heard that there is one store here that traffics in sex slaves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's horrible&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it might get worse&quot; Jessica said. &quot;The sex slaves are of course transformed but they tend to be young girls. Some as young as seven. Some were guys before and some were girls before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's sick!&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Understand that it may not be true&quot; Jessica said. &quot;It's just what I've heard. I'm telling you this so you're careful here. I don't want you disappearing. This may sound silly but I took an instant liking to you when you came in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll be careful&quot; you promise. &quot;I like you too. I can hardly wait to see you as a merman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure that you'll like what you see&quot; Jessica said. &quot;By the way, when I'm male I go by James. What name do you want to be known by when you're female?&quot;<br />
<br />
You think it over. You have always liked the name Megan. &quot;Call me Megan when I'm female&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Megan&quot; Jessica said. &quot;I'll see you at the park tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How will I know that it's you?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll know&quot; Jessica said with a wink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, I'll see you tomorrow&quot; you said then left the store with your purchases.<br />
<br />
As you leave the mall you begin thinking about what happened. You're a little concerned about wanting to see Jessica as a merman or a man. You are curious but it seemed a little more than idle curiosity. You know that you're not gay but something seems a bit off. You start to wonder if Jessica was lying about you starting to like guys. You enter the park and wonder if you should head home or go to the lake before tomorrow.</p>
