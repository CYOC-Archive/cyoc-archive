<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Roger woke to find himself in a darkened room. It was disconcerting to find himself in Liz’s body still. He realised he must have dozed off. He opened the curtains. It was broad daylight outside. How long had he slept for? Where were Liz and Maureen? They were meant to come and change him once they were in the other room.<br />
<br />
The bedside clock said it was 2pm. That couldn’t be right. He opened Liz’s handbag and looked at her phone. It was flat. He couldn’t even remember which room the others were in. It was on the 2nd floor but he couldn’t remember the number. Damn he would need to ask reception. <br />
<br />
But first he needed to visit the toilet. He was bursting. He found the bathroom. It was a nice room, a queen bed and a large bathroom, bath and a separate shower. He glanced at the mirror. He was still Liz, in her body hugging green and blue dress. He had not even taken her pantyhose off. Not that he had ever seen Liz with such messy hair or with her make-up so smeared. <br />
<br />
He sat on the toilet. Had he gone last night? He couldn’t even remember. He had been literally exhausted. But why hadn’t Liz and Maureen woken him to change? That was what they arranged. Perhaps they had been knocking on the door to be let in and he had been too tired to wake?<br />
<br />
He peed and pooped. He was used to doing that in Liz’s body by now. Well peeing at least. This was only the second time he had needed to do number 2’s. While sitting there he peeled the pantyhose off. He had pulled them down to his knees anyhow. Now they came all the way off. He examined his hairless legs. He now had very pale skin. Liz had to protect herself from the sun. The legs felt so smooth. She must have them waxed. There were no bristles.<br />
<br />
He next examined his now bare feet. They were small. Liz usually had painted toenails but his were not. That made him look at his fingernails, they were also unpainted but long. The business done he wiped. First his bum then with a new piece of tissue his front, or should he call it Liz’s pussy. <br />
<br />
He took his first real look at the pussy now in his possession. It hadn’t been opportune to do that when it first formed and Liz was watching him. It didn’t seem appropriate either in the airport toilets or on the planes. He realised he had been too worried about hygiene. Now he gently prized open the flaps and looked inside. It was very bright pink. The fingernail was actually a bit sharp and he recoiled from his own touch thinking he might have cut himself. He hadn’t, so ever more carefully he explored further up and found Liz’s clitoris. It was just a little nub. It was sensitive but perhaps no more sensitive than the tip of his old penis.<br />
<br />
He felt a bit guilty. Sitting on the toilet was perhaps not the most hygienic place to do a self-examination. This body was dirty. He had been in possession of it for over a day, should he clean it before returning it to Liz? Yes, that seemed a good idea. He was already in the bathroom and the shower was right there.<br />
<br />
He stepped out of the panties and flicked them to where he had already tossed Liz’s pantyhose. That corner of the bathroom would be his makeshift clothes basket. He decided he would get all the clothes he had been wearing laundered. It seemed the right thing to do.<br />
Now to take off the dress. He knew there was a zip at the back. He could recall Liz zipping it up. It was a struggle but eventually he was able to pull the zip partway down. He stepped out of the dress and looked at his reflection in the mirror. Liz was looking back at him, clad in here underwear with a cheeky grin on her face. He blew Liz a kiss and she blew one back. Roger heard himself give off a feminine giggle.<br />
<br />
He then took off the slip and the bra and revelled in having a naked female body to play with.<br />
<br />
Then a panic hit him. Had he shut the door properly? He could remember tipping the bellboy. But couldn’t recall applying the chain to the lock. He couldn’t afford to have housecleaning enter the room while he was in the shower.<br />
<br />
Feeling daring he did a nudie run to the door. A nudie run in a female body, his breasts and bum bounced in unfamiliar ways. The door was physically shut but the chain had not been applied. He remedied that situation.<br />
<br />
Liz’s body actually felt quite good, sure it bounced all over the place and he had stomach cramps but he had none of the muscle aches he had come to associate with 50 plus life. He felt as if he was 30 years old again. Well 30 years old and in a female body.<br />
He returned to the bathroom found some of the hotel toiletries and turned on the shower.</p>
