<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He had no Idea how he ended up here.<br />
<br />
Jeremy was just taking a stroll through a park when everything became green and he found himself between giant blades of grass.<br />
<br />
He stumbled around, terrified for half a day till he came across a group of... anthropomorphic ants...<br />
<br />
Watching from behind a blade of grass he tried to make sense of them. They had four arms, reddish, chitinous skin and segmented body parts. Their eyes were a pure black. The were wearing short pants and blankets across their abdomens, which appeared to be made of silk. <br />
<br />
In their arms they were carrying giant aphids which Jerome guessed served as livestock.<br />
<br />
The one at the front wiggled nervously with an antenna and clicked with it&#39;s mandibles before holding up a hand. <br />
<br />
The group stopped and the leader turned around and looked at Jeremy with its bug-eyes. It looked...pleased and raised a hand to wave. <br />
<br />
As it started walking towards him though he panicked, running into the opposite direction before tripping over one of the giant pebbles. <br />
<br />
He hit his head on another stone and the last hing he saw was the concerned look of the Ant before passing out. <br />
<br />
_________________________________________<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh god, his head hurt so much. That dream was wild-oh...OH...OH, NO! <br />
<br />
Looking around he noticed he was in some kind of cave. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please be another dream.&quot;, he whispered in pain. <br />
<br />
&quot;It isn&#39;t&quot;, answered a smooth voice besides him. <br />
<br />
He wanted to scream as he turned around and saw one of the Ants, wearing a silk coat and nothing else. <br />
<br />
All that got out was a wimper. <br />
<br />
The Ant clicked with it&#39;s mandibles. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you still in serious pain? Surprising. I used a lot of healing magic on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Healing magic? What did he stumble into? <br />
<br />
&quot;Where.. am I?&quot;, he mumbled. <br />
<br />
The Ant&#39;s antennae wiggled enthusiastically. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to Firerock, colony and territory of her majesty, Warriorqueen Amira! I am Fallia, the healer.&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiled...somehow. Or at least Jeremy had a feeling she was. He looked around and saw a couple wounded Ants on beds made of leaves. He started to slightly calm down as Fallia continued talking. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, we haven&#39;t had one of you around here in a while and I had to get a very old book on how to treat your kind. Please tell me if you have any complications. Furthermore our majesty wants to see you concerning your... future.&quot; <br />
<br />
He just nodded. This was so strange but... interesting.<br />
<br />
Fallia cleaned him up a bit with her antennae before leading him through  caverns and tunnels. <br />
<br />
There were Ant-people all over, working, playing games and doing other activities. Most of them stared at him with surprised looks, which made Jeremy more nervous. A couple of...Moth-people were bartering with an Ant for some green liquid. <br />
<br />
Eventually, after walking through a corridor of guards which were at least two meters tall, they arrived in front of a gate which opened up to reveal the giant Warriorqueen Amira. She was around two and a half meters tall and wore a long, white, dress which hugged her curves and had holes for her giant wings and abdomen. She had long, black hair tied into a bun and deep black eyes which seemed to twinkle like stars. <br />
<br />
Fallia bowed and left as Amira stood up and strode towards him happily. <br />
<br />
For some reason he felt compelled to not scream and just watched. He wasn&#39;t even scared strangely. <br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings! It is lovely to have you in my halls. When I heard of your arrival I screamed in happiness. Looks like my line is not dying out! Fuck you, universe!&quot; <br />
<br />
Amira was jumping on her claws, causing the ground to shake and only stopped when she saw the bemused looks of her warrior and worker daughters. She took on a more regal stance as she folded her four arms. <br />
<br />
Jeremy was shyly raising his hand, waving. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh gosh, you are going to be a lovely daughter, I can already tell!&quot; <br />
<br />
What. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eh, miss... what do you mean?&quot; <br />
<br />
Amira gestured around wildly. <br />
<br />
&quot;You are going to become one of us, a princess in particular. You must be so happy! When I lost my fertility I thought my line would die out, but now you are here! Why do those transformation spells only work on Humans anyway?&quot; <br />
<br />
He blushed, &quot;What? No!? I don&#39;t want to be an Ant...or a lady. And especially not a Ant-lady! &quot; <br />
<br />
Exasperation became visible on her face as she rubbed her wings against each other. <br />
<br />
&quot;Realy?! But...but my grandmother told me that you Humans love being transformed! She was a Human, like you, before she became a Queen! I am so sorry!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You... dont have to. I mean nothing happened yet, right?&quot; <br />
<br />
... <br />
<br />
... <br />
<br />
... <br />
<br />
&quot;Right?&quot; <br />
<br />
The queen put a hand in front of her mouth, shocked. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am so, so sorry! I-I used...the spell on you while you slept! I wanted to surprise you with it!&quot; <br />
<br />
Fear penetrated into his mind and he felt butterflies in his stomach and he realized the implications. <br />
<br />
Jeremy started breathing erratically as his fingers became slender, red and segmented. <br />
<br />
He panicked, Amira panicked, all the present Ants panicked. <br />
<br />
He felt a tickling sensation as red chitin traveled up his arms to his shoulders which started to loose broadness. Soon his chest became overall rounded, creating what would look a little like breasts under his shirt, and lost his nipples. <br />
<br />
His voice became higher pitched and femenine as his Adam&#39;s apple receded under the unyielding march of chitin. <br />
<br />
His upper body reformed to become more femenine and curvy as his waist carved in and he slightly arched forward. His butt expanded, causing him to loose balance and fall on on it as he screamed. <br />
<br />
An abdomen grew out above his butt, pulsing and expanding with every breath as a second pair of arms ripped themselves out of his shirt. <br />
<br />
Soon Jeremy couldn&#39;t call himself male anymore as his member left a slit in it&#39;s wake. <br />
<br />
The red chitin continued traveling upwards as Jeremy&#39;s eyes became pitch-black and bug-like. Readjusting to so many small eyes caused a serious headache. <br />
<br />
Mandibles grew out from the side of his mouth and his hair lengthened. <br />
<br />
Amira was on her knees, begging for forgiveness as his head became overall rounded and two antennae grew on top of his head. His nose and ears disappeared as his new antennae took care of both these jobs. <br />
<br />
Further down his legs were becoming shapely and his hips widened and thighs thickened causing his pants to rip apart. He was growing, a lot and becoming more slender and stronger actually. <br />
<br />
Soon translucent wings grew out from his back, ruining what was left off his shirt. <br />
<br />
The last change would be to his feet as all that was left of his toes were two claws which ripped his boots.<br />
<br />
With that the transformation was over. <br />
<br />
Jeremy stood up, fully realizing that he was a Ant-girl now. Actually seeing his... now her new form... she was oddly calm now, after all the crying and screaming. <br />
<br />
Catharsis etched it&#39;s way into her brain as she realized that she was still herself in mind. <br />
<br />
Amira was crying into her hands, still begging Jeremy for her forgiveness. <br />
<br />
The guards were silent and the workers were behind the queen, patting her on the back. Most of them exchanged sorry looks with Jeremy and exclaimed silent apologies. <br />
<br />
Jeremy sighed. Hearing her own, femenine voice was strange but she didn&#39;t think much of it. <br />
<br />
Maybe this was not going to be that bad. She had wings, which has always been a dream of hers and four arms are cool. Her new antennae picked up so many interesting scents and she could smell emotions now, evidenced by the smell of sorrow in the room. <br />
<br />
Jeremy put a hand on Amira&#39;s shoulder causing her to look up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...forgive you...there is no point in holding a grudge here, at least to me. It was an accident. &quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Rea-ea..lly?&quot;,she stammered out. <br />
<br />
Jeremy nodded. <br />
<br />
Amira stood up, she was not that much taller than Jeremy now. She put her four hands around Jeremy, hugged her and said, &quot;I...will do anything to make you have the best life a daughter of mine could have. You are going to have the finest silk clothes to wear and the best nectar to eat. You will get anything you want. I swear this by our green mother. This is my apology to you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeremy hugged her back, &quot;I...accept your apology.&quot;<br />
<br />
_________________________________________<br />
<br />
<br />
Over the next three months Jeremy, who called herself Jermali now, geot absolutely pampered with fine dresses, lavish meals and 24 hour acces to all recreational facilities. <br />
<br />
She started becoming used to and even enjoyed acting more femenine and reached full acceptance of her new self rather quickly. She even started enjoying the shy looks the comparatively small males gave her when she walked by, shaking her hips. <br />
<br />
She learned about the Endless Garden she found herself in, it&#39;s mysteries, history and it&#39;s many inhabitants. She learned of prior Humans arriving, most becoming bug-people like herself. <br />
<br />
As a future Warriorqueen she got taught how to fight and became proficient with the blade.<br />
<br />
Flying became one of her favorite hobbies and Amari, her best friend. <br />
<br />
One day while laying on her bed, cuddling her pet-aphid, she contemplated her new life and realized... <br />
<br />
She was truly happy.</p>
