<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Max lay on his large white bed, his bare skin bathed in ghostly moonlight as he gazed at his freshly bandaged hand, Alice&#39;s gental touch had indeed worked wonders on his sliced up hand, he then proped himself up on his elbows to gaze around his room.<br />
<br />
His room was spacious, with the door to the hallway to his left, a bookshelf lining the same wall on its right, numerous novels and anatomy books on its shelves, and a painting of a mountainside to the doors left, Max&#39;s bed was on the wall on the left side of the room, the wall covered in layered slate, at the foot of his bed was a glass table with a round ocean blue rug underneath it, its center at the heart of the room, the opposite wall to the door was a large glass panel, with two black steel rods cutting the glass into three, with a view of the garden he and Lina had planted on the hospital roof, the wall opposite his bed had a one seater couch with an oak wood side table beside it, and a drawing desk to the side of the chair, up against the wall, with a lamp that Max had left on shining down at a stencil design he was working on, a potted cactus and a empty coffee mug put to the side on the desk, and to the left of it was the one wood sliding door to his walk in wardrobe, all I all he loved pretty comfortably.<br />
<br />
Then there was a knock at his door, Max chuckled to himself as he knew that it could only be for one thing at this hour, the question was, who would be the first to arrive, &quot;come in love&quot; called Max as quietly as he could, while still making his voice audible to whoever was stood outside his room, then the door handle turned and in walked Alice.<br />
<br />
She was the definition of pregnant beauty to Max in that moment, she wore no clothing or lingerie, her smooth ebony skin on full display as she waddled into the room, her belly was absolutely gorgeous, round, shiny and smooth, not a single imperfection, her milk filled breast resting heavily atop her pregnant belly, sloshing slightly from side to side as she waddled, her thick thighs practically rubbed together as she moved, with a faint shine of liquid running down her inner thighs as the moons glow revealed her pussy&#39;s nectar trickling down her legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;See something you like, my brave man?&quot; Slurred Alice as she stuck her hip out to the best of her ability, resting one hand on her jutted out hip, while the other cradled the underside of her quadruples filled womb &quot;oh your such a tease, you know that&quot; chuckled Max as he petted the space on the bed beside him, which Alice gladly accepted as now both her hands held the underside of her belly as she waddled over to the bed, her skin now glistening in the moonlight, groaning as she sat down on the edge of the bed, leaning back as she ran her hand over her enormous womb.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have I ever told you how incredibly sezy you are&quot; said Max behind her as he rested his chin on her sholder, one hand now wrapped as far as he could reach around her belly and the other resting atop her thigh, which had been forced apart by her belly, &quot;only twice, maby three times every day&quot; chimed Alice as she leaned her head back, groaning in plesure due to his masterful hands &quot;but that doesn&#39;t mean that I ever get tired of hearing it babe&quot; said Alice as she turned her head and pressed her lips into Max&#39;s, who gladly returned the gesture before Alice placed her hand over Max&#39;s bandaged one as it rose her bellys surface.<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s your hand?&quot; She asked as she lifted it up so she could take a look, hearing a small whimper from Max as she did so, before she quickly and gently kissed its bandaged surface &quot;I think il make it, however I have heard that having a strong beautiful pregnant girlfriend taking advantage of you is an excellent remedy for pain&quot; Whispered Max into Alice&#39;s ear, Alice gave a giggle as she reached behind herself and shoved him back so he was laying on his back and heaved herself up to turn and look at him, gazing hungrily at his erect member, Max made no effort to resist, he had learnt long ago that nothing stopped a horny pregnant woman, not even Lina and Linda were safe at times, because if Max wasn&#39;t available to ease her heat then she would turn to others to quench the fires in her loins.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok then big boy&quot; said Alice as she crawled onto the bed, her belly dragging along the quilt as she made her way towards the smiling Max &quot;hope you have no plans of sleeping tonight baby daddy, because your baby just got some siblings today and mama is horny as hell&quot; Slurred Alice as she straddled over the top of Max&#39;s member, rubbing both hands over her belly, Max smiled mischievously as he rested both hands on her hips, Alice immediately knowing what he was up to as her eyes whent wide &quot;whatever my love wants, my love GETS&quot; said Max as he brought Alice&#39;s hips down, his cock penetrating her slick pussy like a spear as he was buried to the hilt in her folds, Alice was left panic in pleasure from the sudden thrust into her hungry cunny as her walls clamped down on Max&#39;s member.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooohhhhh baby, you sure know how to satisfy a woman don&#39;t you&quot; Moaned Alice as she leaned down as far as her belly would alow &quot;well babe, we&#39;ve only just begun, but if this has already stuffed you..&quot; chuckled Max as he pushed his hips up, putting more pressure on Alice&#39;s depths, Alice gave a groan as both hands flew to her belly as she groaned in plesure &quot;Nnnnnghh....Soooooooo BIG&quot; Alice groaned as she lifted herself slightly from Max&#39;s Member, before slambing her hips back down, her ass slapping against his skin, sending it giggling which Max took full advantage of as he moved his hands from Alice&#39;s hips and grabbed at her round ass cheeks, giving them a squeeze which caused Alice to throw her head back, her tongue hung out as her oversensitive body was overcome with plesure, moaning loudly, not caring if anyone heard her lustfull moans, she wanted to let her wives know EXACTLY what they were missing out on.<br />
<br />
Just then the door began to creak open, and Alice not even thinking to look who it was put both hands either side of Max and lifted herself from his throbbing cock, and let out a waterfall of her necter, moaning loudly as she did so, letting her gravid belly rest on Max.<br />
<br />
&quot;And here we thought you were good at sharing love&quot; came a voice from the doorway, Max and Alice then slowly turned to look at...</p>
