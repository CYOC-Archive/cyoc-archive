<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Things were more serious than Gloria and the others believed. As Naomi and Diane were checking on Nat and Rei, they found themselves besieged by a Normal hit squad. Thankfully everyone was okay, Naomi able to chase them off and rescue the four teenage girls inside. Still, with the Normal making such bold moves, Wyatt began to put a plan in motion.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are we doing her brother,&quot; Duke asked, his voice thick with venom. &quot;Reaching out to a reliable contact,&quot; Wyatt replied. &quot;I&#39;ll not sit idly by as we plan our next action while my family suffers.&quot; Duke simply gave a stiff nod, understanding his brothers desire. Wyatt&#39;s wife and children were at risk. Despite how much he loathed him, he wouldn&#39;t subject him to the pain of losing his loved ones. Still, Duke wished to be cautious especially with Ann and Ken accompanying Wyatt. Turning to Caleb and Wyatt, he could see his friends anxiously watching the three vampires.<br />
<br />
Approaching the entrance to a dance club, Duke watched as Wyatt approached the doorman, whispering something into his ear. The large man nodded, opening the door for Wyatt while offering a small bow. &quot;Friend of yours, &quot; Caleb asked. &quot;You could say that Moreland,&quot; Wyatt smirked. &quot;My people may have departed but I still like to keep tabs on what&#39;s transpiring here.&quot; Both Duke and Caleb exchanged a glance, neither thrilled to be entering an establishment with ties to vampires.<br />
<br />
As the group made their way through the club,  Duke took a moment to take in his surroundings. The club was packed, people crowding the bar and dance floor as music blared throughout. Trailing behind Wyatt, the group ascendrd a staircase to an enclosed VIP booth, the room muffling the noise outside so they could think. Taking a seat in the booth, the group now slowly sat on several couches, awaiting Wyatts contact.  &quot;So who is this contact,&quot; Adam asked. &quot;A friend of the family,&quot; Wyatt replied. &quot;Someone who can get us back to my home.&quot; Before anyone could ask another question, they heard the door open. Standing before them, Duke could see an Asian woman wearing a seductive red dress, an unnerving smile plastered on her face. &quot;Lord Wyatt we&#39;ve been expecting you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb paused turning from this mysterious woman to Wyatt and the vampires. He expected Wyatt to great this woman, instead he saw a look of panic. Wyatts eyes were wide, his face sallow. A small growl now escaping Ann&#39;s lips as the child vampire stared daggers at the woman. Turning once more to woman, Caleb realized what was going on. This wasn&#39;t the contact, this was the Normal.<br />
<br />
Quickly drawing his pistol, Caleb began to fire surprised as nine fox tails now swooped from behind blocking his shots. As the tails parted, Caleb was confused as he beheld an anthro fox vixen, sporting an uneasy smile. &quot;Is that a kitsune?&quot; Wyatt shook his head. &quot;No worse! A kumiho!&quot; <br />
<br />
Caleb yelled ordering them to get Wyatt out before attacking the kumiho. As the pair fought, she smiled at the young hunter. &quot;Silat,&quot; she stated in awe. &quot;My goodness, you so rarely see that style of fighting outside of Thailand. And a master to boot!&quot; Caleb smirked, delivering a knee to the kumiho before pushing her back. &quot;I&#39;m just full of surprises.&quot; As he looked to deliver a kick, one of the kumihos tails wrapped around his leg before tossing him through the plate glass window. &quot;So am I kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell was that,&quot; Duke yelled as the raced down the staircase to the dance floor. &quot;Her name is Choon Hee,&quot; Wyatt replied. &quot;Shes a kumiho and one of the Normals best warriors.&quot; Duke nodded, pushing his way through the crowd. Panic had set in after Caleb had fired, patrons racing for the exit. Taking a glance around the club, Duke could see several men dressed in black slowly approaching. &quot;Crap,&quot; he muttered, turning to Adam as he shoved his brother away. &quot;Take Wyatt to the car! We&#39;ll join you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sound of glass smashing now drew everyone&#39;s attention. Duke watched as Caleb crashed to the floor, appearing dazed but still very much alive. Yelling to Adam, he turned to Ken and Ann, motioning them to follow. Racing to Calebs side, he could see. he was okay as the kumiho lept through the broken window. Choon Hee now seemed to float to the floor, her nine tails spreading outwards like furry shadows as they writhed like snakes. Softly landing, she grinned at Wyatts defenders. &quot;You know this will go alot easier if you just hand Wyatt over,&quot; she called. &quot;Make it easy on yourselves and his family.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann and Ken now struck, the blind swordsman and assassin lashing out at the one that threatened their master. Duke now helped Caleb to his feet, the pair noticing at least 12 men advancing towards them. &quot;I got those guys,&quot; he said to Duke, pointing at the approaching soldiers. &quot;Help them, they&#39;re going to need it.&quot; Duke nodded, watching Caleb fire his pistol before withdrawing a knife. <br />
<br />
Duke was stunned as he now watched Choon Hee fight both Ann and Ken. As formidable as the two vampires were, Choon Hee was creature unlike any he&#39;d seen. Despite some obvious wounds, the kumiho seemed to have gained the upper hand. One of her tails was now rapped around Ken&#39;s neck, repeatedly slamming the swordsman into the wall. As she was doing that she held Ann by her head, slamming the vampire into thw ground like a child would a toy. Duke shuddered as he gazed upon the vixens twisted face, it seemed as if she was enjoying herself. Realizing what was at stake, Duke closed his eyes, taking a breath before pulling out a vial of blood.<br />
<br />
He needed an advantage and as much as he detested it, he would need to fully embrace is vampiric abilities. Downing the vial in one gulp, Dukes eyes went wide, turning a solid magenta as he grit his teeth. The dhampir’s muscles swelled under his clothing as he let out an inhuman roar. Leaping at the kumiho at inhuman speeds, Duke now delivered a thunderous right cross knocking the kumiho into an adjacent wall.<br />
<br />
Choon Hee shook her head, clearing her mind as the dhamphir attacked. She had never fought a dhamphir before and she was thankful for that. Dukes speed and strength were impressive, if he was a skillful fighter he might destroy her. Luckily for the kumiho, Duke was a brawler, a street fighter whose skill paled to hers. Regaining her wits, she now blocked his attack, slamming him into wall as she began to attack. &quot;You must be the other brother,&quot; she snarled. The black sheep. The one daddy Miro didn&#39;t love. Too bad, if he actually took the time to train you, you.might stand a chance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Duke roared, lunging at the kumiho only to be slammed into the ground after a moment. &quot;Always wondered what a dhampir’s heart tastes like. Guess I&#39;m going to find out.&quot; Kumiho licked her lips, her eyes wide and maniacal as she raised her hand over her head. Duke could only snarl, awaiting the inevitable until fate intervened.<br />
<br />
An explosion now knocked Choon Hee off him. Two more now brought the booth they had been sitting in crashing down on the kumiho. Turning, Duke could see Caleb rushing to his side as he helped him up. &quot;Thats not going to hold her for long,&quot; he said, Duke realizing those explosions were courtesy of Caleb. Quickly the pair grabbed Ann and Ken before sprinting for Dukes car. Hopefully they could put enough distance between themselves and Choon Hee.</p>
