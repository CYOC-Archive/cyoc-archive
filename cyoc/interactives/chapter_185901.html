<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Darren made his way home with the tablet safely stored in his backpack.  He was completely lost in his thoughts as he stepped onto the bus.  His mind was filled with possibilities, each scenario becoming more and more perverted.  His dick was rock hard, straining against his boxers, and it was leaking profusely.  Darren was pressing his backpack into his groin in an attempt to hide his erection from the other passengers.<br />
<br />
He was so distracted by his thoughts, he missed his bus stop.  Cursing himself, he quickly pushed the button for the next stop.  He&#39;d have to walk for a while to get home now, which wasn&#39;t normally a problem, but he wasn&#39;t looking forward to the walk with a hard on and a growing wet spot on his crotch.<br />
<br />
Darren got off the bus, readjusted his boner so that it was pressing up against his stomach and being held there by the elastic band of his boxers,  and started walking home.  He found himself staring at the men in his neighborhood as he quickly brushed past them.  Of course, Darren had checked out all of the hot guys in his neighborhood before, but now that he had the power to turn each of them into gay sluts, he couldn&#39;t help but stare at every guy he passed.  He had some really strange looks from a few of the guys, one guy even called him a fag, which shocked Darren (mostly) back to reality.  He made sure to remember THAT guy for future reference.  Maybe he would have done fun with him later.<br />
<br />
After 20 long minutes of walking, Darren was  almost home.  He was looking forward to jerking off for a few hours, to clear his mind so that he could make some plans for the tablet, but as Darren approached his house he noticed someone sitting on his front step.  At this time of day, his parents were still at work and wouldn&#39;t be home for a few hours, so Darren knew whoever was on his porch wasn&#39;t either of his parents.<br />
<br />
Darren didn&#39;t recognize the man.  He was incredibly handsome and muscular.  He looked like a movie star, perfect hair and perfect features with bulging muscles and a very nice bulge between his legs.  He appeared to be in his late twenties or early thirties.  He seemed to be rather jittery, like he was nervous or anxious.<br />
<br />
Darren approached the man slowly.  As soon as the man realized Darren was heading towards the house, he jumped to his feet and rapidly walked towards Darren.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you Darren?&quot; the man asked frantically.<br />
<br />
Darren didn&#39;t feel threatened by the man, for some reason.  It was as if Darren could sense that the man wanted something from him and that the likelihood of him hurting Darren was low.<br />
<br />
Plus, the guy was fucking gorgeous and Darren was a total sucker for a hot guy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s me...&quot; Darren said awkwardly.  He was trying to sound cool, but ended up sounding like a dweeb.  The other guy didn&#39;t seem to care, though.  He just seemed relieved that Darren appeared to be someone he was looking for.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you happen to buy a tablet from a weird shop downtown?&quot; he asked with a glint of hope in his eyes.<br />
<br />
Darren took off his backpack, opened it up and pulled out the tablet he had bought from the shop.  &quot;You mean this one?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man&#39;s eyes grew wide at the sight of the tablet.  Without warning, he snatched it out of Darren&#39;s hand and immediately tried to unlock it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, that&#39;s mine!&quot; Darren cried out as he tried to grab the tablet back.  The man was too big to fight against, though.  He simply pressed a meaty hand against Darren&#39;s chest and pushed him to the ground.<br />
<br />
The man was very intent on activating the tablet in order to use it, but appeared to be growing more agitated by the second.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is wrong with this thing?  I can&#39;t unlock it!&quot; He said, sounding very frustrated.  He glared down at Darren.  &quot;You fucking loser, did you break it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren stood up and backed away from the stranger.  &quot;I didn&#39;t do anything, you creep.  I haven&#39;t even used the tablet yet, how could I have locked it?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man was visibly upset.  He shoved the tablet roughly into Darren&#39;s chest.  &quot;Open it!&quot; He demanded.<br />
<br />
Darren took the tablet in his hands and activated it.  Text appeared on the screen, same as it has in the store, showing the same stats the guy in the store had shown him.  In fact, it was currently showing the stats for the asshole in front of him.  His name was Jeremy Turner, 32 and he was listed as completely, 100% straight.  His libido was pretty high, 8 out of 10.  He was also listed, surprisingly, as a pickup artist.  Even without reading the stats, Darren could tell that Jeremy was the kind of guy that had zero respect for women.  He just fucked them and dumped them once he was done with them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Works fine for me, Jeremy&quot; Darren said sarcastically.<br />
<br />
Again, Jeremy snatched the tablet out of Darren&#39;s hands.  Darren saw that, as soon as Jeremy&#39;s hand touched the tablet, it instantly went blank.<br />
<br />
Jeremy tried again to unlock the tablet and, once he realized he couldn&#39;t, he violently threw it on the ground.  Darren gasped as the tablet hit the ground with enough force to shatter it, but was shocked when it landed softly, as if it landed on a pillow rather than hard concrete.<br />
<br />
Darren picked up the tablet and turned it on normally.  He looked up at Jeremy, who was visibly stunned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Darren said as he brushed some dirt off the screen, &quot;the guy at the store did mention it was indestructible.  Not surprising, considering it&#39;s a magical tablet that changes people&#39;s sexuality.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy grabbed Darren&#39;s collar and lifted him into the air with ease.  Darren felt a jolt of fear run though his body from the unexpected violence.  Darren had misjudged Jeremy, he clearly was very capable of hiring Darren.  Despite being faced with a that of real violence, Darren was incredibly turned on by the sight of Jeremy&#39;s muscles bulging as he held him in the air with little effort.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen here, you little faggot,&quot; Jeremy said through gritted teeth, &quot; You&#39;re going to use that tablet on me and make me…&quot; Jeremey&#39;s voice waivered as he looked visibly disgusted. He released his grip on Darren, took a step back and steeled himself.  He looked confident.  Resolved.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Gay,&quot; he said assertively.  &quot;I want you to make me gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren stared at Jeremy in disbelief.  This total fucking alpha male, this pussy smasher was honestly standing in front of him wishing to be gay.  It was the most surreal thing Darren had ever experienced, and this was happening on the same day that a weird store clerk given him a magic tablet that changes sexual orientations.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t understand,&quot; Darren said meekly.<br />
<br />
Jeremy rolled his eyes and huffed loudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sick to fucking death of dealing with bitches and cunts,&quot; he said with frustration.  &quot;And I&#39;m sick and tired of seeing you fags constantly fucking a different guy each night without even half the work it takes to get some real pussy   If this tablet can make it so that I can get in on that queer action, you&#39;re going to do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren surpressed the urge to laugh, knowing that Jeremy might take it the wrong way.  Darren knew that Jeremy was dangerous, so it was best not to piss him off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway,&quot; Jeremy said, &quot;I had been in that same store a few days ago and the clerk told me about the tablet.  I brushed him off at the time, but the more I thought about it the more appealing the idea of turning myself queer became.  By the time I made up my mind and went back to the store to take the tablet, it was too late.  You had already bought it.  But the clerk told me your name and address, so… here I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren could sense that Jeremy was being sincere, even if he was a total fucking jerk about it.<br />
<br />
Darren thought about the situation for a moment.  He looked at the tablet and selected the drop down next to Jeremy&#39;s orientation.  The default was &quot;straight&quot; with a sub menu selection of &quot;pick up artist&quot;.  He scrolled through the options for a moment and suddenly had a delightfully twisted idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,&quot; Darren said as he selected a few options, but hovered over the submit command, &quot;I&#39;ll help you out.&quot;<br />
<br />
A huge smile spread over Jeremy&#39;s face.  &quot;Sweet!&quot; He said excitedly.<br />
<br />
The smile vanished after a moment.  &quot;Just don&#39;t make me to faggy,&quot; Jeremy said with a menacing tone.  &quot;And I am 100% a top, got it?  No dude is sticking his pole up my ass.  If you do that, I&#39;ll kick the shit out of you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren smiled.  &quot;Got it,&quot; he said as he hit the &quot;submit&quot; button...</p>
