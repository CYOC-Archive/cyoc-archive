<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I woke up to the smell of something cooking.  It didn’t take me long to determine that I smelled bacon and <br />
eggs.  I slowly rose from the kitchen floor and immediately felt stiff.  I groaned as I tried to work out all <br />
the kinks.<br />
<br />
“You need to start stretching out more,” said Nicole.  <br />
<br />
“You mean you didn’t feel this bad when you woke up?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Not as bad as you seem to be,” she said.  “You’re not as limber as I am,” she said as she flashed a knowing <br />
smile.  She wore an apron but otherwise was still naked.  “This’ll be ready in a minute.”<br />
<br />
One passion that we both shared was cooking.  Nicole was far better than I was, but we worked together to <br />
improve our abilities.  It still didn’t change the fact that her eggs tasted better than mine.  <br />
<br />
I looked at the clock in the kitchen and saw that it was approaching 10:00.  “Oh, shit, I’m going to be late <br />
for work?” I lamented.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure you didn’t mess with your own mind?” Nicole asked.<br />
<br />
“Huh?” I said.<br />
<br />
“Or did you just forget that today is Saturday?” she answered.<br />
<br />
“Oh…yea, right,” I said.<br />
<br />
She divided the eggs and bacon between two plates.  She gave me a quick kiss on the lips as she handed one to <br />
me.  “Eat up,” she said as she sat down at the table.  “We’re buying a house today.”<br />
<br />
“‘Buying?’” I asked as I sat down opposite her.<br />
<br />
“In a manner of speaking,” she said with that devilish grin of hers.<br />
<br />
After we finished breakfast and cleaned the kitchen we took a shower.  Together.  Naturally this led to us <br />
having sex again.  We just couldn’t seem to keep our hands off each other.  After the shower we dressed and <br />
convened in the living room.  “Here goes nothing,” I said.  We held hands with our fingers interlocking.  “I <br />
wish that we were standing in front of the Kelly Mansion.”<br />
<br />
Faster than we could blink an eye we were whisked out of our apartment in stood in front of the huge mansion.  <br />
We looked it over and a few things were immediately noticeable.  The house had definitely seen some better <br />
days.  There were a lot of overgrown plants on the grounds.  The house itself appeared to be decaying in a few <br />
places.  There were some broken shutters and the windows were dirty.  It showed all the signs of being an <br />
extraordinary place, but it needed obvious work.  <br />
<br />
“Alright, we’re here,” I said.  “What’s the next step?” I asked Nicole.<br />
<br />
“Now we need to take legal possession,” she answered.  <br />
<br />
She explained to me what we needed so that I could not make a mistake with my wording.  I took a deep breath.  <br />
“I wish that Nicole and I were the legal owners of the mansion and all of the surrounding property as known.  <br />
I wish that no one would ever question how or why we became the owners.  I wish that we had enough money in <br />
the bank and in investments so that we would never have to work again.  I wish that no one would ever question <br />
how or why we have so much money.  And I wish that a representative from the bank who does not know Nicole was <br />
about to arrive to give us everything we need to take full legal possession of this mansion and its property.”<br />
<br />
“Good job, babe,” said Nicole.  <br />
<br />
“I just hope that covers everything we need right now,” I said.<br />
<br />
“It will,” she said.  She turned away from the house.  “See, right on schedule,” she said.  I turned to see <br />
that she was pointing at a car that was approaching the mansion on the long driveway leading up to the house.  <br />
<br />
I realized we’d forgotten a detail.  Without wasting time I said, “I wish that my car would appear parked in <br />
front of the house and that the person approaching us would not notice its sudden appearance.”<br />
<br />
My red 2004 Cavalier appeared in front of us.  “Good thinking,” said Nicole.  “No one would believe we walked <br />
here.”<br />
<br />
The other car parked behind mine.  A balding, bookish-looking man stepped out of it.  He carried a portfolio <br />
with him.  “Are you Joe and Nicole Davidson?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes, we are,” I replied.<br />
<br />
“Ah, good.  My name is George Walters, I’m from the bank,” he said.  Then he appeared confused.  “How did you <br />
get in?  The gate was locked.”  Whoops, I thought.  I made a quick silent wish that he would think the gate <br />
was unlocked already and that he did not unlock it himself.  “Wait, what am I saying?  It was unlocked.  Huh, <br />
I’ll have to report that.  Someone was negligent.”  He walked up the steps that led to the front door.  “I <br />
have here everything you need to sign.  I’m sure you’re familiar with it all by now.”  He took a few papers <br />
out of his portfolio and instructed us where to sign.<br />
<br />
When I completed my signatures I handed the papers to Nicole so she could sign.  “Tell me something, Mr. <br />
Walters,” I said.  “How do you feel about the house being sold to us?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I’m just a humble bank employee,” he answered.  “I’m not paid to have opinions about such things.”<br />
<br />
“Well about I wish you would tell me your honest feelings about us buying the house?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“If you want my honest opinion, I’m glad you’ve bought the house,” he said.  He reacted as if I had not said <br />
the words “I wish.”  “I heard rumors about what the bank was going to do with the land and I must say that I <br />
didn’t care for it.  I’d rather it stay the way it is now.”<br />
<br />
“I see,” I said.  I made another silent wish that he would forget mentioning this to us, just in case someone <br />
from the bank grilled him about us.  <br />
<br />
Nicole handed him the fully signed papers.  “Well, that’s everything that needs to be done on paper,” he said.  <br />
“Here are all the keys, for the house, the gate, everything else,” he said as he handed them to us.  <br />
“Congratulations to you both and, remember, we’re always at your disposal.”  He got back into his car and <br />
drove away.<br />
<br />
Once he was out of sight Nicole asked me, “Did you make a wish to alter his mind?”<br />
<br />
“I didn’t know there was a locked gate that he must have opened,” I said.  “So I just wished that he thought <br />
it was unlocked when he arrived.  And I wished for him to forget telling us his opinion.”<br />
<br />
“Why’d you even ask for it?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“Curiosity,” I said.  “It pretty much confirmed what you told me.  And I wished him to forget it so that he <br />
wouldn’t get into any trouble with the bank.”<br />
<br />
“So you didn’t believe me about the bank’s plans?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“Of course I believed you,” I said.  “I just wanted to know if anyone else knew.  I’m not so sure we should <br />
trust your bank.”<br />
<br />
Nicole scoffed.  “As if I’m going back there to work,” she said.<br />
<br />
“But our money might still be there,” I said.  “We’ll worry about that later.  Let’s see our new home.”  We <br />
walked up to the door, inserted the key, opened the door and entered the mansion.</p>
