<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I wrapped my arms around my sides and groaned. Everything just felt so wrong inside me. I burped loudly and gagged. I didn&#39;t know if she had done something to me or if I had ate something or I was going to have to go the hospital. My stomach was gurgling, my organs were slurping, and my back was cracking. I groaned louder.<br />
<br />
Then I tensed up, clutched myself tighter, and forced something out into into my pants with an involuntary strain. Push, push, push... whew! I relaxed and took deep breaths, feeling the seat of my pants having filled up behind me. I figured I&#39;d just shat myself in front of everybody. I wanted to say something to ease my embarrassment, but it was enough to just catch my breath. The powerful pressure quickly built up in my backside again, until I tensed up again forced even more until the pants were just so full and tight that they couldn&#39;t take it anymore and just totally ripped open.<br />
<br />
* RRRIIPP !! *<br />
<br />
The audience gasped. I rested my hands on my knees and tried to catch my breath again. I could hear them murmuring amongst themselves, but I was too weakened and dizzy to react. By the time I regained my strength and stood up again, I realized it couldn&#39;t have been diarrhea or normal sickness because I could still feel whatever it was hanging off of me, not out of my butt over it, and dangling down onto the floor. And somehow I could feel it all moving! I wiped the sweat off my brow, took one more deep breath, and looked back. When I did, I was shocked at just what it was that had destroyed my pants.<br />
<br />
It was long and puffy, basically a bushy mass of red fur peppered with black except for the brilliant white tip. And when I say long, I mean it was LONG. It was trailing on the stage behind me! I could make it lift up off the floor and back down again. I gasped and lifted it back up again so I could grab onto it. I pulled it around in front of me and stared, taking in the feel of the warm fluffy fur along with the confusing sense of my own hands touching myself so far beyond what used to be the end of my back.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you can see, ladies and gentleman,&quot; Madame Illusia spoke again, &quot;Jerry is discovering that letting out his inner animal can be backbreaking! But the rewards don&#39;t take long to arrive, do they?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rewards? I had an animal-like tail sticking out the end of my ass! I was still clutching the appendage with both hands when I turned and opened my mouth to insist that she undo whatever it was that she started. But before I could say anything, I felt an odd tingling in my fingers so I let go of my new tail to just look at those. Short black fur started to sprout out of the my fingers in a hurry as the joints popped and it looked like they were getting shorter. I felt my long tail swish behind me while I watched my fingernails darken and grow out and ... sharpen? Seriously? The woman was somehow giving me animal claws, right up here on a magical stage!<br />
<br />
I was taken off guard by stretching feet and growing claws ripping out of my shoes. I was finding it hard to keep my balance on my shifting feet because they were starting to feel just too different. It was like I couldn&#39;t stand flat on my two heels anymore! Shifting joints and tendons were urging me to stick my feet almost straight up toward the ceiling. Understandably, I toppled over onto my hands, but not quite how I expected: I landed basically right onto my changed and shortened fingers, noticing the rest of my hand had lengthened and thinned out. My upper arms were shortening too and pulling up closer to my body. I was standing on all fours in almost exactly the way a dog or a wolf would.<br />
<br />
I finally got myself together enough to actually speak to the Madame. &quot;You ... you ... you gave me ... PAWS, and ... and a TAIL, just like some kind of--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;--fox?&quot; she interrupted. &quot;Yes, Jerry, you wanted to let out your inner animal, and aren&#39;t you lucky to have such a pretty one.&quot; She turned back to the audience. &quot;What do you think of Jerry&#39;s new footwear, everybody?&quot; Some of them giggled while others laughed and applauded. Many of the skeptics scratched their heads and squinted and tried to figure out just how the trick was done.<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t want to let on that I was scared. I never knew volunteering for a magic show would be like this. Was this still all some kind of an illusion? I couldn&#39;t see how. Smoke and mirrors can&#39;t rearrange your bone structure or give you a whole new body part. This was something beyond logic, beyond reason.<br />
<br />
The fur growth changed to white when it reached my chest, complemented by a rich brownish red as it wrapped around my sides. The audience oohed in awe. It really must have been beautiful, but it itched like a nightmare. I sat down on my haunches, with my forepaws on my ground, and raised a back leg up to scratch at it. It was embarrassing but my arms just didn&#39;t move the right way to scratch myself anymore. When the fur had finally grown in I was relieved but still stunned and insanely nervous. I did manage (after several tries) to get out of what little was left of my shirt and pants. The audience seemed impressed by the sight of even more of my reddish-orange fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;From now on, as you can see, Jerry will grow his own coat every winter and will shed it each spring to make room for more appropriate summer covering. He&#39;ll never go out of style!&quot;<br />
<br />
Her commentary was really starting to get on my nerves. My tail twitched side to side.<br />
<br />
A prickly feeling took hold of my cheeks as long, firm hairs worked there way out of my cheeks and the sides of my nose. A pressure almost as intense as my tail growth took hold of my face as my whole facial bone structure sent a new extension out in front of me. My mouth got longer, and my tongue grew along with it, and before long I could lick my own nostrils at the end of my snout! Strong smells wafted in from all over the tent from the every direction. It was going to take me a while to get used to just how much I could smell now! But that process wouldn&#39;t even start before I felt the surging growth take hold of my ears. They grew out into tall fleshy triangles that I could aim around to sample the sounds of the spectators. My descent into colorblindness was the last step on my descent from humanity. My big ears flattened in shame as it sank in that I&#39;d given away my whole self to get some attention on the stage.<br />
<br />
The Madame gave a deep bow to the eager applause of her audience.</p>
