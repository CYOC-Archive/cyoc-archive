<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The singing afro skeleton Brook made them curious, so they waved good-bye to Mikku, thanked her for everything, and headed to the concert.<br />
<br />
There were tons of people there, but the Knables managed to see the stage. And there they saw him - Brook himself! Everyone around them <br />
cheered for Brook, and some even had some Brook-themed merchandise. &quot;A man who's dead, yet alive.&quot; Roy said &quot;Reminds me of Crowley - <br />
only with more hair and less of everything else!&quot;<br />
<br />
As the music started, so did the song:<br />
<br />
Brook: Come on, baby!<br />
<br />
People: Yeah!<br />
<br />
Brook: Because I'm a skeleton, it's ....<br />
<br />
People: Bone!<br />
<br />
Brook: ...Bone to be wild!<br />
<br />
People: ...Bone to be wild!<br />
<br />
Brook: ...Bone to be wild!<br />
<br />
People: ...Bone to be wild!<br />
<br />
Brook: Bone!<br />
<br />
People: Bone!<br />
<br />
Brook: Bone!<br />
<br />
People: Bone!<br />
<br />
Brook: Bone!<br />
<br />
People: Bone!<br />
<br />
Brook: Bone!<br />
<br />
People: Bone!<br />
<br />
Bone! Bone! Bone! Bone!<br />
<br />
(people cheer)<br />
<br />
Brook: It's nonsense to become macho just to attract women<br />
<br />
(pause)<br />
<br />
Brook: Soul King is mysterious<br />
          He's nothing but bones!<br />
<br />
Brook: Let's make today a great anniversary!<br />
<br />
<br />
Everyone was so excited. &quot;I'll bet this will be a great concert!&quot; Helen said, smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if he's just a skeleton,&quot; Diane said, smiling &quot;you have to admit he's a pretty good singer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I wonder how he sings without vocal chords.&quot; Darryl said, a little confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what?&quot; Helen said happily &quot;I'm actually enjoying myself. Who cares if we're talking mice? This is the most fun I've had the entire trip <br />
so far! What could possibly go wrong now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooh I really wish you hadn't said that.&quot; Roy said, rubbing his forehead with his right hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is that?&quot; Helen asked her husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because whenever someone asks that in a cartoon,&quot; Roy replied to his wife, twisting his tail a bit with his hands &quot;Something DOES go wrong!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Helen said, laughing a bit &quot;now you're just being silly! I mean, sure we're talking cartoon mice in the age of pirates listening to an afro <br />
skeleton rock out on stage with equipment that shouldn't have been invented yet, but do you really thing that just because I said that <br />
something bad's going to happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
And then right on cue, a marine stepped up. &quot;Pirate Brook!&quot; he said angrily &quot;Drop your instrument, and put both hands in the air!&quot;<br />
<br />
Unshaken, Brook said &quot;Supporting band. Chorus. Dancers. Please accompany me for one last song!&quot;<br />
<br />
With a strum of his guitar, he continued &quot;It'll be alright! My music has become more powerful!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You must be panicking.&quot; his manager said, pointing a gun at him &quot;This is the end for you, Brook!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Manager,&quot; Brook replied calmly &quot;thank you for taking care of me these past two years. And thank you for bringing me to this island. This is an <br />
island of regret for us, filled with memories of defeat. It is also the island for our renewed departure! I am the musician. Raising the crew's <br />
spirits during our adventure is my duty! Strawhat Luffy, dead? Nonsense! Tell this to the world, y'all! The Pirate Straw Hat Luffy ... is alive! He is <br />
the man who will become king of the seas someday! Let's send him off with a bit of noise, oh baby! Love 'im to the bone!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, everyone cheered, and Brook strummed his guitar &quot;I dedicate this song to my dear companions. Please listen to my final Soul! Yeah! <br />
Luffy-san, let's go to the New World!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You fool!&quot; the angry marine said &quot;The concert is over!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up, Navy!&quot; a fan said, as he covered the marine's mouth. &quot;Please let us hear one more song!&quot; a female begged the marine &quot;Let him sing!&quot; <br />
&quot;That's right!&quot; another guy fan said &quot;We don't care who the Soul King is!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See?&quot; Brook said &quot;Music is your ally.&quot;<br />
<br />
All the fans cheered, as Brook said &quot;New World.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the music started playing, Brook sang this song:<br />
<br />
Oh yeah!<br />
<br />
Kid!<br />
<br />
This is the story of a hero<br />
<br />
The story of a man who will become king<br />
<br />
In war there are no &quot;do-overs&quot;<br />
<br />
But he stands firm with sandals on his bare feet<br />
<br />
Oh yeah!<br />
<br />
Come on baby!<br />
<br />
Dreamers always struggle<br />
<br />
Because sometimes their dreams are out of reach<br />
<br />
In order to live through the days in which you have to battle your own demons<br />
<br />
It's a big dream that seems quite a handful<br />
<br />
But when he mentioned it, I could see it coming true<br />
<br />
Today is the day we got tired of waiting<br />
<br />
We don't need nights because we're short-temered<br />
<br />
Today is the day<br />
<br />
It's a great day<br />
<br />
Kick the clock that was stopped<br />
<br />
For the New World<br />
<br />
For the New World<br />
<br />
For the New World<br />
<br />
The world is gonna change<br />
<br />
(instrumental)<br />
<br />
One more time!<br />
<br />
The marines fired, and when the smoke cleared, Brook was gone, and there was a hole in the roof. All that could be herd was his laugh &quot;Yo-ho-<br />
ho-ho!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe that's our cue to go!&quot; Roy said as he left and his family followed him.<br />
<br />
Outside there was a ton of fighting everywhere.<br />
<br />
The Knables knew it wasn't safe here anymore - they had to get out of here, so they snuck onto a ship with a lion's head on it, thinking they'd <br />
be safe onboard since it looked friendly enough, but what they didn't know was that the ship was the Straw Hats' ship Thousand Sunny, and by <br />
the time they realized their mistake, they were already underwater, and sinking to the bottom of the ocean!<br />
<br />
From what the Knables could tell, the crew wasn't worried (at least, not most of them), and the water wasn't even coming in.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least they don't know we're here,&quot; Roy thought to himself &quot;or we'd be in even bigger trouble!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then Luffy looked around at everyone.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong, Luffy?&quot; Nami, the orange-haired woman asked.<br />
<br />
Luffy said nothing, but smiling he headed in the Knables' direction. &quot;It's okay.&quot; he said &quot;I won't hurt you. You can come out now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oy, who are you talking to, Luffy?&quot; Ussop, the long-nosed guy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The nice family of mice hiding behind this barrel.&quot; Luffy said smiling, and he picked it up, reveling them. Ussop and Chopper were shocked, <br />
Zoro and Sanji looked like they wanted to fight, while Nami, Robin, Franky, and Brook were curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you know we were here?!&quot; Darryl asked, scarred.<br />
<br />
&quot;AHHHHHH!!!!&quot; Ussop screamed &quot;Talking mice wearing clothes!!!&quot; Then he wore garlic around his neck, and held up a cross &quot;Please leave our <br />
ship, demon-possed rodents!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It that what you thought the first time you met ME?!&quot; Chopper yelled angrily at Ussop &quot;We've also seen a talking starfish, and a talking polar <br />
bear, so what difference does it make?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot; Ussop said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just who are you guys, anyway?&quot; Zoro asked, annoyed that mice had gotten onto the ship (even if they could talk).<br />
<br />
&quot;We're the Knables.&quot; Roy said &quot;I'm Roy, this is my wife Helen, my son Darryl, and my daughter Diane. We don't mean any harm. We just wanted <br />
to escape the fighting, so we got on your ship. We're sorry. We promise not to cause you any trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brook walked up to them, and looked down at Diane.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're a really great singer.&quot; Diane told him &quot;Even if you don't have any vocal-chords.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Diane-san.&quot; Brook replied &quot;And even if you're just a mouse-girl, you're the most beautiful one I've ever laid eyes upon,&quot; This made <br />
her blush &quot;but being a skeleton, I have no eyes. That being said, would you allow me to-&quot; but before Brook could finish asking, Nami zapped <br />
him with her Clima-tact, and he fell down on his face, still smoking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you do that?!&quot; Diane asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He was going to ask if he could see your panties!&quot; Nami answered, very annoyed &quot;He does that with EVERY beautiful girl he sees! I can't believe <br />
he still does that after two years!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a good thing you stopped him,&quot; Helen said &quot;or I would've hurt him!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo-ho-ho-ho!&quot; Brook said as he got up &quot;You know me too well, Nami-San! I guess I don't think about those things too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it's because you don't have a brain either!&quot; Diane said, annoyed at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right!&quot; Brook said happily &quot;I don't have a brain! Yo-ho-ho-ho!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So where exactly did you guys come from?&quot; Sanji asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Roy said, scratching the back of his head &quot;you wouldn't believe us if we told you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Try us!&quot; Zoro said, smiling &quot;Stranger things have happened before!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then.&quot; Roy said, and he told them his story.<br />
<br />
When it was over, Franky burst into tears, crying loudly. &quot;Even if you're just a mouse,&quot; the emotional cyborg said as tears ran down his eyes <br />
&quot;you're more of a man than I ever thought! Surviving Hell, escaping, and going back to save your beloved wife from being run over by a train - <br />
it's SUPER BEAUTIFUL!!!!&quot; and he covered his face with his right arm as he cried. &quot;I'M THE ONE WHO WENT TO HELL!!!&quot; Sanji screamed, <br />
remembering the island of transvestives he'd spent the last two years at &quot;Luffy got to spend two years on an island full of beatiful-&quot; and he <br />
forced himself to not have a nose-bleed as he thought about the Kuja pirates lead by Empress Boa Hancock. &quot;Don't even think about them!&quot; <br />
Chopped yelled at Sanji &quot;You've lost too much blood already!&quot; &quot;You guys sound like you had it pretty rough.&quot; Nami said &quot;I had to spend almost <br />
my whole childhood trying to pay back my own rotten deal that I made with a certain 'devil' I knew, so I completely understand how you feel.&quot; <br />
&quot;We all lost people we cared about in the past.&quot; Nico Robin said &quot;I lost my whole island, Brook lost his old crew, Franky lost his mentor, and so <br />
did Chopper, Sanji lost the people he sailed with as a boy, Ussop lost his mother, Nami lost her adoptive mother, Zoro lost his friend, and <br />
Luffy....&quot; at this, Luffy walked away into the cabin with a sad look on his face &quot;..... he lost his brother only two years ago. You all are very luck to <br />
still have eachother after all you've been through.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So where is this ship going?&quot; Roy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;To Fish-Man Island!&quot; Luffy said happily, as he burst back out of the cabin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that was fast!&quot; Remarked Diane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once we get there,&quot; Luffy said &quot;we'll all be that much closer to our dreams coming true.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll return to Laboon to play my crew's last recored song to him.&quot; Brook said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've built the ultimate dream-ship, and now I'll sail with it to it's final destination.&quot; Franky said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll find the Rio Poneglyph, and unlock the true history of the world.&quot; Robin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll become the best doctor in the world, and cure any sickness or disease!&quot; Chopper said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll find the legendary sea, All Blue.&quot; Sanji said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll become a great warrior of the sea!&quot; Ussop said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll make a map of the world&quot; Nami said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll become the world's best swordsman.&quot; Zoro said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm gonna find Gold Rodger's treasure One Piece,&quot; Luffy said smiling &quot;and ...... I'M GONNA BE KING OF THE PIRATES!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is gonna be one interesting trip.&quot; Roy thought to himself &quot;I just hope we can survive it.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that moment, .....</p>
