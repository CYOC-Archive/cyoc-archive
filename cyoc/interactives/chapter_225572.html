<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;This way to the dining room.&quot; Rick said, a slight Australian twang coloring the &#39;roos every word. &quot;Gett some grub in us and I&#39;m sure we can work this thing out&quot;  <br />
<br />
Trailing behind Both Williams and Thomas barely registered the roo mans&#39; words. Since they&#39;d began their short walk, both men had taken notice of the strange ....details in ricks costume. While Williams was a strict defender of his heterosexuality- as all good football coaches are - his eyes were drawn unbidden to the skin tight athletic shorts the roo wore, and more specifically the sheer attention to detail in the &quot;costumes&quot; musculature it appeared to reveal. As a coach, Williams had to be an expert in anatomy and the shorts seemed to show it all - the gluteus maximus, gluteus Medius, vastus lateralis - all the muscle groups he&#39;d had to memorize were well developed and aesthetically highlighted by the shorts. Thomas&#39; attention meanwhile was drawn to the more...inhuman elements. Emerging from a specially crafted hole in the roo mans shorts was a thick, muscular brown furred tail that rested with clear weight against the roo mans perfectly toned gluts. The mere existence of the tail wasn&#39;t what really captured Thomas&#39; attention, however, it was its <i> movements </i>. Every so often, the tail seemed to twitch, its movements scored in tandem with each step of the roo. <br />
<br />
&quot;One hell of a costume&quot; he thought as the trio entered the main dining room. Before the men laid a spacious room. well lit by sunlight which cascaded from  wall high windows that lined the far wall. In t he room&#39;s center, sat  dozens of well set tables. Williams was quick to note this was a space big enough to accommodate not only his boys,  but a large meet up of animal men as well. <br />
<br />
Turning slightly to the men, Rick grinned. &quot;Told you we could make it work! Space is big enough for the whole crew. Not only that, Trevor, the chef here, is absolutely excellent.  Hell - he&#39;s half the reason this place is a five star resort. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More importantly, everything is all you can eat&quot; Came another, deeper voice. Looking to its source, both men were stunned. Before them stood an impressive cow man. While Williams and Thomas were well acquainted with burly men, this guy was an exception.   His stature - a towering seven feet, and high frame, thickly muscled no doubt from hours in the gym. Both men&#39;s eyes traced his form in amazement. What really caught their attention, however, was what hung between his legs a thick. Framed by his snug shorts hung a rounded bulge similar to the other cow men they&#39;d seen in the lobby. On the surface of the pendulous sack, thick outlines of four apparent nipples strained against the fabric, clearly wanting to hang free. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eyes up her boys&quot; the bull man command. Both men started, realizing they&#39;d been staring just a <i> little </i> too long. A hot streak of red crossed both their cheeks. &quot;Heh- as I was saying. This food is endless which for our purposes, is exactly what we need. Nothing pairs well with a hard day of lifting than plate after plate of the finest food.&quot; <br />
<br />
Rick grinned &quot;Not sure Derrian here would be this huge without Chef Trevor&#39;s spread.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Derrian by the way&quot; He said, extending a thick hand &quot; if you had to give me a title I&#39;d say I&#39;m the er -vice president of this here group of ours&quot; As they shook, the pair of  coach&#39;s couldn&#39;t help but marvel at the strength of his grip...and the fact that he had only three hoof capped digits on each hand. <br />
<br />
&quot;I was just telling these here coaches we&#39;d be more than willing to reach some sort of accord for the week.&quot; Rick said to Derrian <br />
<br />
Derrian grinned slightly turning to the two men &quot;Rick and I are always happy to have guests. The more the merrier. In fact, more often than not we find our guests tend to become more permanent members of our little group once they get to know us.&quot; Derrian winked, his slight grin growing a bit wider.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, why don&#39;t we  have some grub and hash these things out.&quot; Rick said, as he took a seat at a nearby table. <br />
<br />
As the others joined, they were greeted by another imposing sight as a lion man dressed in a chefs outfit approached their table. While slightly less built than the bovine they&#39;d just met, Trevor clearly spent nearly as much time in the gym, with results to show. Adding to the powerful visage was a thick mane, a mix of deep black and lighter tawny, which brilliantly framed his muzzle. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;ll it be.&quot; came Trevor&#39;s deep, almost growling voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Two salads for our guests&quot; Rick replied without asking, turning to his guests he smiled  &quot;The salads here are to die for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m actually fine on the salad&quot; Thomas replied &quot;Actually ate a hearty salad my wife prepared on the way. That said, wouldn&#39;t mind some dessert to cancel out that rabbit food.&quot; Thomas grinned. While he dutifully ate the healthy salads whenever his wife prepared him one, the man hate greenery. <br />
<br />
&quot;No worries&quot; Rick said with a grin &quot;Trevor, why don&#39;t you give him one of those special house-made milk shakes.&quot;<br />
<br />
The lion man nodded, and promptly turned to prepare the food. <br />
<br />
&quot;Everything&#39;s made fresh and in house, even the milk&quot; Rick continued &quot;Guaranteed to be the best shake you&#39;ve ever had.&quot; <br />
<br />
Moments later, the lion man was back, a lush plate of greenery in one hand and a frosty shake in the other. <br />
<br />
&quot;That was fast!&quot; Williams stated in surprise<br />
<br />
&quot;Gotta have it all prepped ahead of time. With the volume these guys eat after their exercise, I keep food ready at all times.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything here is top of the line.&quot; Derrian added, before flexing his thick biceps &quot;Can&#39;t get guns like these if there ain&#39;t a spread fit for a cow&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas and Williams eyes widened slightly. Derrian was clearly strong, but seeing the flex of his biceps in action was another level. Clearly this man had to eat volumes to build such mass. <br />
<br />
&quot;So anyway, gentleman  how can we make things right for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well first&quot; Williams said, fork spearing a collection of greens &quot;Why don&#39;t you tell us what your deal is. Who are you guys and why...the animal costumes.&quot; Rick brought the greens to his mouth and began to chew. Beside him, came a loud slurp as Thomas sipped at his milk shake. <br />
<br />
&quot;Enjoying your shake&quot; Derrian said with a grin, eyeing the assistant coach<br />
<br />
&quot;mmmhmm&quot; Thomas replied. The shake was delicious. Just as they&#39;d said, it was the best he&#39;d ever had. The chocolate vanilla and cream blended to perfection, mixed with the perfect level of sweetness. Taking another sip, Thomas felt a strange sense of...relaxation hit him. As the cream danced on his Toung, his mind seemed to drift somewhat, the pleasurable favors pulling his attention. <br />
<br />
Williams meanwhile was feeling a similar set of emotions. While not usually a salad guy, there was no doubt this was expertly prepared. With each chew, he too felt a strange sense of calm wash over him. <br />
<br />
Rick smiled &quot;Well, we like to think of ourselves as something of a ...fitness group, enthusiasts devote to developing and studying the male form!&quot;<br />
<br />
Williams nodded, the bright flavors of the salad surprising much consideration of what that might entail. <br />
<br />
&quot;Every month we gather here, and take full advantage of everything this resort has to offer. First class gyms, yoga studios, fields for running and of course, a top of the line spa. Everything one needs for top fitness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Place is excellent&quot; Darrian agreed &quot;I&#39;d live here if I could.&quot;<br />
<br />
Williams blinked slightly, the mussiness in his thoughts only deepening. Next to him, Thomas was lost in an even deeper lull, mind content to focus on the wonderful flavors of his shake. <br />
<br />
&quot;And&quot; William blinked slightly, collecting his thoughts &quot; The animal thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick smiled, standing and making his way behind Williams. <br />
<br />
The coach felt two paws rest against his muscular shoulders. He blinked again, the gears of his mind failing to process as the paws slowly began to knead his tense muscles.<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem to be holding a lot of tension back here coach.&quot; Rick said, hands diligently pressing into the man&#39;s muscles.<br />
<br />
&quot;mmmmhmmm&quot; was all that Williams could muster. The gently kneading felt excellent, and between the taste of the greens and the pleasure of the massage, his muggy mind failed to protest the roo&#39;s advances or realize his question had gone unanswered. Williams did notice, however, that something seemed...off about Thomas. A s the man enjoyed the cream of his shake, his ears were oddly...longer and...whiter. <br />
<br />
Any comprehension of this sight,  however,  failed the coach. <br />
<br />
&quot;Must be stressful.&quot; came a calming voice. Williams felt the hot breath of the roo&#39;s muzzle on his ear. Ricks gently whispers continued &quot;Probably too hard to manage all those kids for a full week. But don&#39;t worry.&quot; <br />
<br />
Williams felt the roo&#39;s paws slowly start to massage his ears. Any protest the coach may have felt was long gone, all he felt was pleasure as the gently strokes seemed to almost <i>Strech </i> the skin of his ears. <br />
<br />
&quot;...we can take them off your hands. I grantee my boys know far more about how to develop a perfect male form&quot;<br />
<br />
Williams moaned slightly as the roo gently shaped the tops of his ears into points. <br />
<br />
&quot;More than happy to provide personal training, yoga, endurance coach and even spa treatments. My boys do it all. In fact, that&#39;s why this resort is so happy to have us so often.&quot;<br />
<br />
Williams felt a strange prickling on his ears as tan fur began to emerge. <br />
<br />
&quot;In fact&quot; ricks voice was almost hypnotic, the whisper calming and the feel of his breath close against ricks ear, relaxing &quot;Before we got here, they were also stressed. Poor Trevor didn&#39;t know how to run a kitchen. But thankfully...we were able to show him a few pointers, both in the kitchen and the gym. Now he&#39;s  a lion among chefs...and a valued member of our crew.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick felt his ears twitch as the words swam into his mind. <br />
<br />
&quot;So how&#39;s that sound coach? We take the boys for the weekend and teach &#39;em how to be just like us. In the meantime, we&#39;ll let you take a load off. Enjoy the spa. I guarantee you&#39;ll be practically a new animal, er I mean man, by the end of your stay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Williams lazily opened his eyes as the roo&#39;s words hung in the air. Glancing over to his partner, he saw a dull grin painted across Thomas&#39; face as the cow massaged his equally bovine ears. A grin crossed the coaches face. He felt amazing, and the roos words, were so enticing. <br />
<br />
&quot;New animal? Sounds perfect....&quot; <br />
Rick smiled, sharing a knowing look with his bovine companion.</p>
