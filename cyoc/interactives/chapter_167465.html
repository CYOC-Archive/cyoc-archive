<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now the other quarterback wasn&#39;t totally evil. He had planned on turning him back. The problem was he lost track of Chad for some time. He had given Chad to his fellow team mates for some entertainment. And they thoroughly enjoyed his holes.<br />
<br />
It was amazing. Each load that had been dumped him him and he was always ready for the next one. No wetness, no stickyness, nothing. Now even though he was rubber the holes did show some wear. But that was possibly due to the dudes with the humongous and girthy dicks fucking the shit out of him. Or perhaps it was when they double, triple or quadruple dicked his holes. But Chad was always ready.<br />
<br />
He had him periodically but there was no sign of him the next football season. The quarterback had intended to have Chad as the entertainment for every win his team had that year but Chad was gone.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t until he had graduated that he found Chad once again at a gay bathhouse. There was that lovely smirk he had seen from Chad so many years ago. But that smirk had somehow changed and as the night wore on and he had watched Chad being used in all manors of ways he finally found his opportunity and went in and decided he was going to change Chad back but he needed to nut one more time in him.<br />
<br />
Chad looked up and there was that guy that had changed him so long ago. He once more opened his mouth but found that his ass was being invaded first. It wasn&#39;t anywhere the same as the first time. Chad had grown use to being a cum dump. You might even say he craved it. The quarterback had been out of school for some time and had lost some of his build. You wouldn&#39;t say he was fat but he had some love handles on him and the washboard was no longer.<br />
<br />
As Chad enjoyed being used he began to feel himself change back into a human. When the quarterback emptied his balls deep inside Chad&#39;s ass the change had completed. There he was laying on the floor naked with cum finally dripping out of his ass.<br />
<br />
The man helped him up where there was no way Chad could clench his butt muscles to keep the cum inside of him. It ran down his legs like a spigot had been turned on. He was helped up by the quarterback.<br />
<br />
Sorry dude the quarterback said. I had intended to turn you back after the next football season but someone stole you and I don&#39;t know why I came in here but it was lucky I found you. <br />
<br />
Chad had a hard time taking. He hadn&#39;t done so in so long. But amazingly he was the same age as he was when he had been changed into the boymattress. But there was some changes in his body. His ass as was already apparent was as stretched out as could be. It would be easy to fist him without lube. His jaws seemed to have an extra flexibility that wasn&#39;t there previously. But there was one thing that really astonished the quarterback.<br />
<br />
Chad had a beer belly. No. No. No. Beer belly wasn&#39;t a good enough description of the belly Chad had on him. Just like his tormentor had grown out of the muscled stud he once was so too had Chad. But way past what the quarterback had grown. He had realized that all that cum had to go somewhere and here it was. Chad&#39;s legs were still very muscled but he had a belly that looked like he was nine months pregnant with quints.<br />
<br />
As Chad stood up he saw a guy walk by the door of the room he had spent so much time in. He raced out the door and dropped to his knees and began sucking on him. Over and over Chad found more and more guys. The quarterback went down to the leather shop at the front got a collar, chain and a lock and found Chad once again and collared him. As he led Chad out he felt a bit of responsibility to rehabilitate Chad. Well to some extent. And as they left Chad would run to the end of the chain over and over again trying for another load and the quarterback would pull on the chain and yell heel Chad and chad would come back.<br />
<br />
He hooked Chad up to the bed of his truck and drove home. In the light of his home he finally got a good look at Chad. Now this was not his intent but that belly poking out so far from him creating quite a fat pad devouring Chad&#39;s penis made it impossible for Chad to ever fuck anyone, man or woman ever again. But that was ok. Chad was so focused on either anal or oral sex he didn&#39;t even get hard again. Even with the largest of men to use him. Chad had been throughly converted to a cum loving cum dump fag there was no changing it no matter what the quarterback wanted and he would use Chad often but Chad needed more than what he could give him. And that belly could hold a lot of cum as they both found out.<br />
<br />
Chad was fitted with an inflatable dildo to keep him from dripping all over that place but it was easily removed when he was needed.</p>
