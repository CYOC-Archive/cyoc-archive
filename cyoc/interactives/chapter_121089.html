<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{{Okay, I&#39;m not a lawyer. Haven&#39;t even played one on TV, but trying my best here, and our episode title is also a classic song by the Bobby Fuller Four.—tmw.}}<br />
<br />
Although it was part of the Miranda Rights, the one thing Dieter Wilhelm had not been since being hauled away from the Moon Lake Baptist Church in handcuffs was silent.<br />
&quot;How dare you arrest me? Do you know who I am? I&#39;ll sue everybody till I own this entire hick town, then I&#39;ll level it to the ground just for spite!&quot; he swore at anyone he saw along the way.<br />
While most of the Moon Lake Police Department was comprised of weres, along with about a good 80% of the entire town, Police Chief O&#39;Hara had made advanced arrangements that only normal officers handled the suspects, just in case there was a fight.<br />
But other than being a belligerent loud mouth, Dieter Wilhelm and his accomplice hadn&#39;t put up much resistance.<br />
Yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re actually stupid enough to do this?&quot; Dieter asked in disbelief as he was being fingerprinted and booked.<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; was all the attending officer would say.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll have your badge for this,&quot; Dieter swore.<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t look good on you,&quot; replied another cop, much to the amusement of his fellow officers.<br />
<br />
How long he sat in that holding cell, Wilhelm couldn&#39;t swear to.<br />
What mattered most to him was the fact that by now, &quot;his Jenny&quot; probably married that bastard who had been muscling in on &quot;his girl&quot;.<br />
<i>Well, when I get out of here, Jenny will just have to wind up being a widow and I&#39;ll marry her on the rebound. The second marriage for her, and the first for me,</i> was the only comforting thought Dieter Wilhelm had on the subject.<br />
He was a good decade older than Jennifer Harper, but that didn&#39;t matter. <i>Just means I&#39;m more experienced, in and out of bed,</i> he bragged to himself.<br />
Wilhelm had tried contacting his personal attorney, but that man was back in Alabama, and the best Wilhelm wound up doing was leaving a message with his answering service.<br />
<i>The jerk&#39;s probably out fishing again or something. I&#39;ll have to fire him and get someone more competent once I&#39;m out of this mess,</i> he realized.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dieter Wilhelm?&quot; a guard asked, as he started to unlock the cell door.<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; the suspect asked in return.<br />
&quot;Judge wants to see you,&quot; was all the officer would say in return.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s about time,&quot; replied Wilhelm. &quot;I&#39;ve been sitting here for ages. If I&#39;ve lost my Jenny...&quot;<br />
&quot;She was never yours to begin with, you smug bastard,&quot; the guard said, as another officer joined him.<br />
These were the same two normal officers who took Wilhelm and his accomplice through processing earlier, before separating them. Yet there were plenty of were police nearby if needed.<br />
<br />
With his hands cuffed behind his back, Dieter Wilhelm was escorted on foot from the holding cell in the police station to the nearby courthouse.<br />
There, a judge sat on his bench.<br />
There was a man and a woman standing next to what he assumed was the prosecution&#39;s table. The defense table was empty. Except for the stenographer and a lot more police officers than he thought there should be present, there was no one else in the courtroom. Wilhelm contributed that to it now being past noon, local time, according to the wall clock he saw.<br />
As he was being led to the front of the courtroom, Wilhelm heard the doors that he came in open again. A brief glimpse over his shoulder revealed it was his henchman Doug Smith being led in the way he was, with his hands cuffed behind his back.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve presented us with some very serious charges Mister Wilhelm,&quot; began the judge, looking at him sternly.<br />
&quot;First off your honor, I&#39;m completely innocent and not guilty of any accusations against me or my friend,&quot; said Wilhelm, &quot;so I am expecting that all charges be dropped and a formal apology issued immediately. Secondly, I still haven&#39;t been able to get a hold of my personal attorney and—&quot;<br />
&quot;Save the bugle oil Mister Wilhelm,&quot; replied the judge. &quot;Your lawyer won&#39;t be needed right now. This appearance is just a formality on your part. We&#39;re here on other matters concerning you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; asked Wilhelm, wondering what was going on, when he heard the door again.<br />
This time, when Wilhelm turned to see who had come in, he saw a man in shorts and a t-shirt, carrying a brief case, but heading straight to Doug, who was being held off to the side away from him.<br />
The two men conferred privately for a bit, for even the officers accompanying Smith briefly stepped aside so they could talk.<br />
Then Smith stayed where he was with the police while the oddly dressed man with the briefcase approached the bench.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then Dieter Wilhelm, as I said moments ago, your presence here is just a formality. Douglas Smith, I have been told that you have retained local council and are prepared to enter a plea in regards to the charges leveled against you.&quot;<br />
&quot;That is correct your honor,&quot; said the man with the briefcase. &quot;Fredrick Watson, attorney at law. I apologize for my appearance, but was summoned here on short notice by my client.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll allow it at the moment, under the circumstances, but please adhere to official court attire in the future,&quot; advised the judge. &quot;Now then, in regards to the accusations of attempted murder, conspiracy to commit murder, attempted kidnapping, and the other charges pending against you, how do you plea?&quot;<br />
&quot;My client would like to advise the court that while he is guilty of anything pertaining to his activities this morning between picking up the accused Dieter Wilhelm at the Seattle airport and driving him here to and around Moon Lake, he had no physical participation in anything prior to today, but knows plenty about such accusations and is willing to turn state&#39;s evidence in exchange for mercy from the court for a reduced sentence of what he is guilty of,&quot; explained Watson.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; was all the judge would say, but Wilhelm had other opinions.<br />
<b>&quot;WHAT?</b> You two timing son-of-a-bitch! I&#39;ll kill you myself you damn traitor! How dare you—&quot;<br />
But any further protests were silenced as the attending police officers restrained the suspect.<br />
&quot;Thank you officers,&quot; said the judge, once order was restored. &quot;Now then sir,&quot; he added, looking sternly at Wilhelm again, &quot;with or without your lawyer present, your presence here at the moment is just a formality. I would like to introduce you to our special guest. Standing next to our District Attorney is Special Agent Brook Reeds* of the FBI. Considering you were in Alabama and Moon Lake is in Washington, your alleged actions crossed several state lines in the process of the attempted murder of one of our citizens, the conspiracy to commit murder of one of our citizens, and the attempted kidnapping of one of our citizens**, so she is <i>very</i> interested in talking to you.&quot;<br />
Dieter Wilhelm started feeling very sick to his stomach as Special Agent Reeds gave him a very predatory like smile.<br />
__________________________________________________________________<br />
*Yes, I am introducing the Earth 1 version of the Earth 2 character into this series. While Agent Reeds <i>is</i> a fellow were, whether or not she&#39;s a were<i>wolf</i> on this world or something else remains to be seen.<br />
**Attempted murder: Henry Jenkins Junior (who was shot under the mistaken belief he was his younger brother), Conspiracy to commit murder: Harold Jenkins, attempted kidnapping: Jennifer Harper-Jenkins, respectively.—tmw.</p>
