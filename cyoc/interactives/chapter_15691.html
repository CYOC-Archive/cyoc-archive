<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kent had a bit of a problem.  Unlike Coach Jason, who was mostly bitter about having his basketball dreams dashed, Kent had always been a dumb jerk and a bully.  And now being an obese waddling midget who made Danny DeVito look tall and svelt, he was at a loss what to do.<br />
<br />
Honest thank yous.  How was he going to get any of those?  He couldn't just hold a gun to someone's head.<br />
<br />
But he could abuse his powers as a coach.  Even as an obese waddling midget, he could give people referrals and detention, so students still had to do what he said.<br />
<br />
He waited on the practice field for the team to show up, noting one new figure in the line-up.  It was Ty.<br />
<br />
Ty winked at him, and Coach Kent was smart enough to know that he was supposed to keep quiet about whatever weird-assed magic the kid had used to turn him into this freak.  &quot;Here to join the team?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir,&quot; Ty said, winking again.  He looked, judging from the height of the other players if not his own, to be about 6'8&quot; and built like a tank, with an obscene bulge in his pants just about at Kent's eye level.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Kent said, &quot;to be completely fair to everyone here, you did miss tryouts at the beginning of the year, but you certainly are big enough.  I think we'll have to put it to a vote as a team.  Men, should we let Ty here try out?  Who's for him?&quot;<br />
<br />
The guys looked over at Ty, and the ones who weren't particularly jealous or egotistical--mostly the second stringers--raised their hands.  Kent saw Ty mumble something under his breath and noted how all the boys who'd voted for Ty slowly sprouted six inches taller with a matching increase in their crotches.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who's against?&quot; Kent asked and a half dozen other guys raised their hands, shrinking as they did by half a foot each with their bulges shriveling to the size of gradeschoolers.<br />
<br />
Kent was stupid, but not that stupid.  &quot;I myself vote for Ty.&quot;  Kent found himself sprouting six inches, but none of his fat went away.  It increased in size along with him, up to 3'5&quot;  But he felt his cock and balls grow massively, from the 4&quot; he'd had at his tiny height--proportionally not that bad--to 10&quot;, which at 3'5&quot; was enormous.<br />
<br />
He glanced at the boys.  &quot;I suggest you guys who haven't voted yet vote for Ty.  He may be a real asset to the team.&quot;<br />
<br />
The guys got wise, the remaining abstentions raising their hands and each sprouting 6&quot; of both height and cock except for Michael, who was one of the better strategists, who raised both his hands, jumping straight to 7' with a 20&quot; cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks guys, thanks coach,&quot; Ty said, and Kent sprouted another inch to 3'6&quot;, his pudge squeezing a little bit smaller, though he was still a blubbery midget.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, thanks,&quot; said Michael, looking at himself, then at Ty, then at Kent.  He didn't seem to notice Kent sprouting to 3'7&quot; but the rest of the guys were looking at each other, trying to figure out the weird height change, some of them overjoyed, some visibly upset.<br />
<br />
Bob, the running back, who'd been 6'6&quot; until a minute ago now stood 6' and was reaching his hands into his pants and touching himself in alternate shock and horror.<br />
<br />
Kent felt sorry for him, knowing exactly what sort of thing he was going through and having a bit more of an idea of the source.  &quot;Bob, why don't you and, uh, the other guys who voted against Ty go sit on the bench while the alternates take the field.&quot;  He glanced to Michael, the strategist, who was part of the regular team, but smart enough to know how to deal with something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, thanks coach,&quot; Bob said.  &quot;Thanks...&quot;  3'7'  3'8&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Kent said, waddling around.  &quot;Michael, why don't you organize teams?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, coach,&quot; Michael said.  3'9&quot;  &quot;Ty, you can be on mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kent watched as Michael sprouted another foot, both in height and in his crotch.  He was now 8' tall with a 32&quot; sausauge coiled up behind his athletic protector.<br />
<br />
Kent sincerely wished that Ty would get killed, and as he did, he found himself shrinking a whole foot while his crotch dwindled  to nothing.<br />
<br />
Kent looked down at himself in horror, then at Ty, the author of all this madness.  Letting out a cry of incoherent rage, Kent ran for Ty as fast as the legs of a tubby 2'7&quot; neutered midget could, watching Ty whisper something and feeling himself get shorter and shorter and fatter and fatter as his arms and legs dwindled away to nothing and he fell, tumbling end over end across the football field, bouncing until he came to rest at the feet of the giant Michael.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take that with you for luck,&quot; Ty said to Michael.  &quot;I bet you'll take it all the way to the Superbowl.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Superbowl?  Kent had always wanted to be in the Superbowl, and hadn't cared how many people he hurt or steroids he took to do it, and when that was no longer an option, had pushed for his students to go where he never could.<br />
<br />
With dull dying realization and horror, Kent felt the giant Michael's hands wrap around his leathery body and taught skin, and knew that his dreams of going to the Superbowl might not be dead yet.<br />
<br />
The only trouble was, he was now a football.</p>
