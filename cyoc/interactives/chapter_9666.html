<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Josh held on to the book and ran into his bedroom, locking the door behind him.<br />
<br />
Then he quietly sat down, determined to learn how the spells work. While everybody else was busy taking showers and getting dressed, he figured he would even try to memorize a few of the coolest spells. Then he could use them anytime, anywhere, and on anyone. Just the thought of having that kind of power fascinated him, and he grabbed his notebook and started studying the book.<br />
<br />
Josh has always been a good student in school, and he saw studying the Book of Transformations just like studying for any other test. Since he was still only 12 years old and just little over 5 feet tall, about 90 pounds, he wondered if there was a spell which would allow him to add some weight and muscle to his body.<br />
<br />
He found a chapter which illustrated the human body, with a graph of all the muscles as shown from the front, the back, and the side. Then he noticed what the spells were, listing the names of all the muscles. He then realized how it worked: He could say the magic words, then the growth in inches, then if it should shrink or grow. He thought it was very interesting! He could grow one muscle at a time or all of them at once!<br />
<br />
He grabbed his pen and his notebook, and he started to write down what the spells were for specific muscles, and how they should shrink, grow, or return to the original state. Josh then stood up and walked over to the mirror in the room. He took his t-shirt off, and was left only wearing his shorts.<br />
<br />
“Alright Josh, let’s see what happens!” the preteen boy said, as he smiled while looking at the scrawny kid in the mirror.<br />
<br />
Josh looked at his notes, and then he dropped the notebook on the carpet, in front of his feet. He uttered the magic words, carefully and clearly, pronouncing each word slowly. At first nothing happened. Then he noticed a strange feeling in his pectorals. His chest began to inflate, it became wider and bigger. His pectorals grew by 3 inches, giving him a very athletic look! He could have been a young bodybuilder or a gymnast!<br />
<br />
The boy then squatted down and looked for another verse. He spoke the words again, and then he slowly rose back up to his full height again. His pectorals began to shrink back to what they were just a few minutes earlier!<br />
<br />
“Wow! This is so easy!” Josh said to himself. Then he bent down and read another verse out loud. This one was supposed to cause his entire body to grow. As he stood up straight, he felt a jolt through his body. Before he knew it, he began to grow! Although he did not grow any taller, he did become more muscular! His legs, arms, shoulders, chest, torso… everywhere! He suddenly gained 30 pounds of solid muscle! And when he stood there, admiring the muscle boy in the mirror, he could not help but feel aroused by the surge in strength, weight, and muscle which has now come over his body. He felt like he was now the strongest guy in the house!<br />
<br />
His older brother Ric finally walked in the room and froze in shock when he saw his little brother standing in front of the mirror. Suddenly, Josh didn’t seem so little anymore!<br />
<br />
“Holy cow! Josh! What happened to you? You’re huge!” Ric said, as he quietly approached his little, muscular brother. Josh was about 125 pounds at least, still 5 foot tall, but he had muscles all over, which Ric could only begin to dream of! <br />
<br />
Before Ric could say another word, Josh turned around, grabbed Ric’s arm with his muscular arms and his powerful grip. Josh then forced Ric to fall down on the floor, falling on his back. Josh knelt down and rolled him over on his stomach! Then Josh lay on the floor, on his stomach, while facing Ric’s head. Josh extended his right arm and pushed Ric’s right hand in his own. <br />
<br />
“Let’s arm wrestle, hermanito!” Josh said, taunting Ric with his strength. Ric gave it all he got, clenching his fingers around Josh’s hand and gnashing his teeth together. Ric turned red of the intense muscular effort he was trying to put into forcing Josh’s arm down on the carpet. But Ric’s little brother just laughed, as he quietly countered all of Ric’s efforts and maintained his arm in the vertical position.<br />
<br />
“Now, I will show you my new strength! Mira esto!” Josh chuckled. With great ease and very little effort, Josh forced Ric’s arm back until Ric’s knuckles were pressed down on the carpet. For Josh, it was awesome. “I am now much stronger than you, little brother!”<br />
<br />
Then Josh got up and stood in front of the mirror, while Ric still lay on the floor. Ric could not understand how strong his little brother had become. But Josh wanted more muscle, more strength, and more power. He wanted to be the biggest and the strongest kid on the block. He picked up his notebook and looked up the next spell he wanted to use. Then he looked at himself with a wide grin on his face, while Ric could only stare in disbelief.</p>
