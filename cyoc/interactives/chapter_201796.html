<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The first impression Chad had about the objects were that they reminded him of blue boxing gloves. “She wants me naked beside this” he thought laughing. Asking himself what kink she had. He stored the box back into his locker, as he still had classes before this meeting with the “secret admirer”.<br />
Shortly after three pm, Chad last class had ended. Today was one of the rare days without any training planned, meaning he had time to get ready. As he neared his locker, there was suddenly a voice he couldn´t place, saying only one word loudly to him. “Invisible”<br />
Chad looked around, searching for the owner of the voice, but saw no one. With a shrug, thinking maybe he had imagined the voice, he moved to his locker. In a boost of confidence that no one would see him, Chad decided to fulfill the admirers wish early and quickly disrobed himself, getting naked and tossing all his clothes, as well as his bag, inside his locker. He pulled out the box, opened it, and grinned again at the gloves.<br />
“This will be interesting” Chad said before pulling the left one onto his hand. He noticed that it weren´t boxing gloves like he thought before. They were a light and a bit slippery cloth material and not leather like he had guessed. <br />
After getting the left one fixed onto his hand, including the strap locking it in place, Chad tried to grab his shoe, which had toppled out of his locker again. But he couldn´t hold it, it slipped out of his now clumsy hand, as he couldn´t get a good grip through the glove. With an annoyed huff, Chad grabbed and threw it in with his right hand. Then, with a few problems due his useless left hand, he put on the right glove. The strap was a nightmare to get fixed, but he was sure his admirer would want them closed. Chad had to use his teeth to finally close it.<br />
Grinning satisfied, Chad enclosed the key to the fieldhouse in his right gloved fist, lucky that it stayed in, and left the locker room. He himself now naked beside the gloves, at least he thought so. He encountered not a single person while he strolled through the halls, taking his time.<br />
Reaching the fieldhouse around three fifty, Chad tried to use the key to open the door, but while he had been able to carry the key in his fist, using it was out of question. He dropped the key trying, and was unable to lift it up from the dirty ground. With a frustrated sigh, Chad tried to open the door, and was lucky, because it was unlocked. So, he entered, leaving the key outside. Without much thinking, he headed into the first room to the left. Looking around, Chad found nothing of his secret admirer. There was nothing he could do but wait, so he laid down on the carpet in the center of the room, believing that would be where he would have fun soon.<br />
At four pm sharp, the door outside suddenly closed with a loud bang, and Chad heard the lock click, meaning whoever it was had taken the key he dropped. But as he looked up, there was no one there in the room with him. “Hello?” he asked confused, when there still was no one with him inside. Had his “admirer” simply locked him in? The door to his room had also closed shut, and he heard it click as well.<br />
That was when someone started giggling near his feet. Chad had no fear of ghosts, or something like that. He only got more confused as he asked loudly: “Who is there?” His only answer was even more giggling.<br />
Chad started searching for a hidden speaker near his feet. Maybe someone wanted to scare him that way? He had a few problems lifting the carpet with his gloves to look under it.<br />
A minute or two later, the giggling voice finally spoke up: “Sorry, little Chaddy, but seeing you like this is just hilarious. But let´s end your blindness now. “Visible”.”<br />
Just in a blink of his eyes, a girl suddenly stood before him, looking amused by him searching around their feet. Now Chad jumped back in surprise, only for his gloves to slip along the carpet, making him face plant on it. Shaking his head dazed, he asked: “How have you?”<br />
The girl, who had laughed at his face-planting, answered: “Oh, it´s quite simple. I triggered a command within you, in the locker room, making you blind for any human around you. You should have seen the faces of all the teens in the halls, as you walk around like that. You were also deaf to anyone but my voice, so you couldn´t hear their laughter. It was quite a sight.”<br />
Chad didn´t believe her, but got red in embarrassment all the same. He was confident about himself, but if she wasn´t lying, many had seen him naked like this. But he still didn´t recognize the girl. “What are you, some kind of witch? Or is there someone pranking me?”<br />
“How rude” the girl said, looking at him. “First off, I´m not a witch, but have learned to hypnotize people easily. And second, are you really that dumb to not recognize me, little Chaddy?”<br />
“Stop calling me that” Chad snapped at her. “I´m not a little kid. And no, should I know you?”<br />
“Oh, my little baby doesn´t like his name, does he? What a shame. I won´t stop calling you that, you asshole. I´m Jennifer, or Jenn for short, and you wanted me about three months ago, but dropped me the moment you had your fun with me. That´s why I want revenge, which I planned for two months now, slowly giving you hypnotic commands, which now will be activated and shown to you one after another, little Chaddy.” Jenn explained.<br />
Chad still didn´t remember her, as she was just one of many girls around. “I don´t believe in this hypnotic shit” he exclaimed angrily for her still calling him little.<br />
Now Jenn laughed. “Oh, you will soon see it yourself, little Chaddy. Let´s start with …”</p>
