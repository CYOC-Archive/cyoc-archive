<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a couple weeks of sexing Joanne and walking Dan, Sean started to <br />
get bored.  He had already tweaked his Chronivac profile so that he <br />
was such a stud, the girls were all after him, but because he lived <br />
with Joanne he wasn't getting the tail he should have. <br />
<br />
One day, Joanne (ne Jay) returned home with dinner to dutifully serve <br />
her master.  Jay was of course seething inside.  He hated Chinese <br />
food!  Sean knew it, and undoubtedly ordered it just to piss Jay off.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yum, Szechuwan nice and hot just the way I like it,&quot; said Sean as <br />
Joanne fed him chopstick full after chopstick full of food.<br />
<br />
He added, &quot;Pick out the black peppers!&quot; <br />
<br />
Joanne started to toss the black pepper away in the trash, but Master <br />
Sean ordered, &quot;Don't waste that food, Joanne.  Eat it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sadist! thought Jay as he swallowed six black peppers in a row. <br />
<br />
Sean's cell phone rang, &quot;Hey, babe,&quot; he answered, &quot;What's up?&quot; He had <br />
programmed a special ring tone for this girl he'd met at the coffee <br />
house. She was really hot. &quot;So you want to come over?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanne could only hear Sean's part of the conversation. They flirted <br />
for a bit, and he said, &quot;Oh, Jilly, I'm sorry to hear that. So you're <br />
allergic to dogs?&quot; He looked over at Dan sleeping in the dog bed in <br />
the corner, and shook his head. &quot;Yeah, no, no I don't have a dog. Used <br />
to - Stephy was right.  I used to have a dog.  Good ol' Dan, but had <br />
to put him down.&quot;<br />
<br />
At this Dan's ears perked up and he lifted his head. Sean glared at <br />
him and gave Dan the hand sign to stay and be quiet. Dan obeyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No, no, no. I don't live with any girl.  I'm sure your friend <br />
was mistaken -what?  No, no. Listen, Jilly, I can explain - I think.  <br />
My room mates are a couple of gay guys, Dan and Jay, and Jay sometimes <br />
dresses up in lady's clothing.&quot; He paused. &quot;Yeah, yeah, no, no I'm <br />
totally straight. One of the benefits of gay roomies, when they're not <br />
disgusting me, is that they keep the place clean and neat, and make <br />
delicious dinners.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, huh. What? Yeah, probably they do want to get into my pants, but <br />
they're not going to. Right, see you at 7PM then. Bye, Jilly.&quot;<br />
<br />
He hung up, and motioned for Jilly to resume feeding Sean his lunch.<br />
<br />
When he was done, Sean stretched.  He walked over to the Chronivac, <br />
and turning to his dog and sex slave and said, &quot;Well, guys, it's been <br />
fun, but I'm bored with this sitch. Jilly is super foxy, and she's <br />
allergic to dogs and other women, so you two get to be guys again. <br />
Except you're still not off the hook for being jerks.  So Dan is going <br />
to be Jay's Master or Dom, and Jay you're going to be Dan's bottom <br />
boy. You've already had a lot of practice being a bottom, so that <br />
shouldn't be a problem for you.&quot; Then he started typing at the <br />
Chronivac.<br />
<br />
Dan whimpered.  Joanne moaned. <br />
<br />
Joanne felt her ovaries grow to the size of golf balls and then to <br />
migrate down to her crotch.  Her boobs began to shrink.  She clenched <br />
her camel toe and felt it fusing and pushing out to reform Jay's <br />
penis.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm making a few physical changes, boys, as well as psychological to <br />
make you the ideal gay room mates for a straight hot dude like me,&quot; he <br />
chuckled.<br />
<br />
When he was through, Jay was wearing salaciously short shorts that <br />
hugged his buns and had a zipper in the back, and a black leather <br />
collar with a tag hanging from it.  The tag read PROPERTY OF DAN.  Dan <br />
was a now a muscular hunk who could pass for straight, and was Sean's <br />
workout partner for lifting weights.  He was almost as hot as Sean, <br />
and since he could no longer get hard for a woman, he was Sean's <br />
perfect wing man.  He also retained the fierce loyalty and admiration <br />
for Sean that he had while Sean's dog. He was an alpha male, except in <br />
regards to Sean. Oh, and Jay was his bitch.  Jay was still totally <br />
aware, though the Chronivac dictated his behavior now to be that of a <br />
gay sub masochistic bottom boy. Jay shivered.  He was naked except for <br />
the shorts.  He was lean, a bit muscular and a friggin' good foot <br />
shorter than Sean and Dan.<br />
<br />
Sean spun around in his chair and laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, boys, I've got a hot date at 7 pm, so you get this place <br />
cleaned up, and fix up a nice dinner for two before you go out for the <br />
evening,&quot; Sean said, &quot;Now, I'm going to take a nap, so be quiet while <br />
you work.&quot;<br />
<br />
He got up, strolled over to his bed, put on an eye mask, and went to <br />
sleep.<br />
<br />
Jay rolled his eyes, but his new programming took over, and he started <br />
cleaning up the Chinese takeout containers, and wiping the furniture.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Jay, you do the light stuff, I'll get the mop and bucket so you <br />
can mop the floors, and then I'll go get the groceries for tonight.  <br />
You can make a nice Chateaux Briand, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll try, master,&quot; Jay whispered thinly as he cringed expecting a <br />
fist to strike him at any moment.<br />
<br />
Instead, Dan patted him on the head and laughed, &quot;You better.  I'll <br />
pick up so oysters too.  We'll all be happier if super stud scores.&quot; <br />
He glanced at what Jay was doing and said, &quot;No, wipe in broader <br />
circular motion, and put your arms into it.  Damn, I wish you could <br />
read minds, then you'd know how to clean properly. That's better. I'll <br />
check on you when I get back from the grocery, and keep it down, hot <br />
stuff is trying to sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir, Master Dan, sir,&quot; Jay said as Dan exited.<br />
<br />
Sean started to snore.<br />
<br />
Jay glanced at the Chronivac, he couldn't reverse what Sean had done <br />
exactly, but he could fulfill his master's wish, and maybe if he could <br />
read minds he could figure out how to undo what Sean had done to them.<br />
<br />
He started typing on his profile.  He was now able to read minds by <br />
looking at the person and concentrating. He glanced over at sleeping <br />
Sean.  The vulgar sex dream of Sean as Conan the Barbarian taking <br />
Princess Jillian was enough to make Gay Jay sick to his stomach at the <br />
same time as giving him a boner.  He didn't like Sean that much, but <br />
he was totally in love with Dan now, and Dan was Conan Sean's muscled <br />
sidekick in the dream, and Jay was the cringing oriental servant in a <br />
way to short kimono and geisha make up. He hated Sean even more now.  <br />
What was it that Master Dan saw in that arrogant piece of-? Jay <br />
grinned.  He loved the way his master looked longingly at Sean when <br />
Sean wasn't looking, and he wanted Dan to look at him that way too.  <br />
Now he'd read Dan's mind when he looked at Sean and figure out what he <br />
has to do.</p>
