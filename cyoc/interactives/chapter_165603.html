<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your mind suddenly gets interrupted by a splitting headache and you double over in pain and screamed out, clenching your head. &quot;R-Raaaaaaaagh!!!!&quot; You roared out feeling the bones in your body crack and take new shapes as it feels like your mind is trying to split apart from you. You started hearing voices even, all yelling, screaming, roaring in pain with various reactions but all to the same splitting pain. Before you know it the feeling in your mind becomes physical as you suddenly feel your neck grow thicker before suddenly splitting apart at the base in six places that started pulling away at your body and growing apart from your central head. This sensation caused so much pain for you that you were almost about to pass out, before you felt like your brain literally pulled apart from you in six different directions all at once, and looking around you saw six different heads growing in alongside your own.<br />
<br />
Something about these heads seemed off though, they didn’t feel different from you, and as you stared at them as their eyes and mouths grew in, you felt like you were looking at yourself through the eyes of your attached head and your own, but while you still felt like yourself you felt your mind had been divided amongst all of the heads and given separate personalities. You could still move and control your body, and you felt like you had control over your heads, but they were so different from you that they weren’t you. You weren’t sure what was going on, were these heads you, or were they all separate from you? Did you have control or did they control you? Were you all or the heads, or were they now just you? Nonetheless you felt all of them felt what you did, and it felt like you were either all or the heads or none of them and unable to express yourself with certain heads but each head seemed to develop a mind of its own based off of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arrrrrrgh!!! S-Son of a....!!&quot; One of your heads snarled feeling a large reptilian tail painfully grow in right above your ass before that same head roared out,&quot;WHOEVER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS, I WILL PERSONALLY TEAR OUT YOUR ENTRAILS, DEVOUR THEM, AND BURY YOU IN THE SHIT THAT THEY WILL BECOME AND PISS ON YOUR GRAVES!!!! DO YOU HEAR ME?!?!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
You then felt a new slit open up between your legs and a different head moaned as that opened up and two mounds started swelling on your chest. &quot;Oooo~ So big.... so nice~ I don’t know about the rest of you but I’m feeling frisky~&quot; They seemed to have a feminine and sultry voice compared to the first one which was just masculine.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH WILL YOU SHUT UP!?!? WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE FUCKERS WHO DID THIS TO US!!!&quot; The first head roared then the second moaned and smiled,&quot;Mmmmm~ Fuckers~ Right.... speaking of fuck I think we might need some attention~ I’m feeling wet but not from our cock, and does anyone else recognize those mounds and the nice large breasts of a voluptuous busty female~? I think we may have a pussy too~&quot;<br />
<br />
A third head rolled its eyes and snarled,&quot;Tch! I’d rather be on two legs! With my kids! My damn wife, and human!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!!&quot; The first head growled,&quot;Wait...?! Are you saying we’re part woman?! WHAT?! OKAY WHO’S COCK AM I TEARING OFF FIRST?!?!?! WHO THE FUCK DID THIS TO ME?!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe you mean us, and our kids, correcting you from earlier, and if nobody is going to take charge here I guess I will. Nothing is good is going to come from bickering, let’s just wait and plan out an escape, or start before one of us resorts to brute force,&quot; A fourth head rolled its eyes<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yeah...&quot; A fifth head yawned,&quot;O-Or sleep, relax, do whatever, escape sounds like a lot of work... such a pain.....&quot;<br />
<br />
A sixth head chuckled,&quot;Well I say we take everything we see here as ours, take it all! Heheh, do you think we can persuade someone to get us something shiny?&quot;<br />
<br />
The seventh head just groaned and started licking the ground,&quot;Are they going to feed us? I’m really hungry.... like really REALLY hungry,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How in the FUCK can you think about food NOW?!&quot; The first head roared.<br />
<br />
&quot;I’m hungry too, but for something a bit different, if you know what I mean~&quot; The second head said and swooned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Urrrgh!! You two are insufferable!! We’re a giant fucking lizard!! Two genders!!! And can we even stand up on two legs anymore?!&quot; The third head snarled<br />
<br />
Meanwhile the fifth head had fallen asleep and was currently snoring loudly, and the sixth head paused,&quot;Well one of us is somehow finding peace in this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Peace?! How can there be peace when I can’t get anything to eat, uuuuuuugh!! I feel famished....&quot; The seventh head whimpered then the fourth head roared,&quot;OKAY EVERYONE SHUT UP!!! It’s time to figure this out before we all drive each other mad, please!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well there’s one option I can get around,&quot; The third head sighed and the sixth head nodded,&quot;I suppose it’s better than nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?! WHAT ABOUT PUNISHING THOSE RESPONSIBLE?!?!&quot; The first head roared then the fourth head snarled,&quot;LATER! For now we have to figure out what we are, cooperate with each other, and plan on what we should do next. Now I also don’t want anyone starting stupid fights like who the original head is, because while it is obviously me since I’m the biggest and most reasonable out of all of us, I feel like we all still make up the same person so we should all be considered equal...... debatably that is since I have to lead us all if we’re going to get ANYTHING done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you all split from ME! Smartass!!&quot; The first head snarled then the fourth growled,&quot;Later! Now let’s see if we can decipher who is who, what exactly we are, and finally how we can move our body. I just hope I don’t have to share a base body with a bunch of simpletons, not naming which ones I’m thinking of right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You better not mean me,&quot; The first head growled and the fourth rolled its eyes again,&quot;Just calm down, and let’s get to know each other okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Throughout the next thirty minutes you seemed to figure out what well you had become, and from what the looks of it was you had to be some kind of hydra. The one thing that seemed troubling was that your seven heads seemed to embody the seven deadly sins but with your personality: Your first head seemed almost always at least a little pissed off and embodied your wrath. Your second head was always horny and currently was always trying to masterbate by nuzzling your large breasts and licking your crotch and was highly charismatic, clearly Lust. Your third head seemed constantly jealous of something, obvious embodying envy, and currently was salty about having just turned into this thing. The fourth was embodying pride, and while it was reasonable and promoting order, it also had a large ego and considered itself superior in any way shape and form to the others, and it wanted to lead just because it wanted to and nothing else. The fifth was sloth, either dozing off, tired, or complaining about overexerting itself doing simple tasks. The sixth was greed, constantly stating it wanted to have everything and anything it could claim, wealth, love, women, friends, just anything and everything for its selfish desires. The final head was always hungry, always wanting food or something, it had to be Gluttony and it was just drooling like a slob over the thoughts of food.<br />
<br />
&quot;So we are all in agreement that we should address each other individually by our personalities instead of numbers, and that we are all Robert Pattinson?&quot; Pride asked <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Wrath said and everyone else nodded except for sloth, who Wrath snarled at,&quot;Hey!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-What?! Y-Yes!!&quot; Sloth suddenly shouted looking startled for a moment then gulped,&quot;W-What did I just agree to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To be addressed as sloth rather than head number five,&quot; Envy sighed then sloth paused and yawned,&quot;O-Oh... yeah... sure whatever...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems like some of us have female voices and male voices too~&quot; Lust added,&quot;Envy, myself, and sloth are all feminine and sloth looks so cute when she sleeps. Motion to vote for referring to us three as women~&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! I thought I was in charge of calling votes!&quot; Pride growled then sighed,&quot;Though.... I agree we should nonetheless Lust.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don’t care, so sure,&quot; Sloth yawned <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, but when are we gonna get food?&quot; Gluttony whimpered<br />
<br />
&quot;I refuse, we’re men! I don’t care what kind of body we have, these humans are all just food for us if they don’t give us a proper explanation!!&quot; Wrath snarled making Gluttony drool,&quot;Fooooood~&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well personally I think that having feminine parts of us would be beneficial, so I agree, plus I wouldn’t mind coming across a girl like lust who’s into something like me just so they can please us~&quot; Greed chuckled and Envy sighed,&quot;Yeah, sure, whatever, are you sure you’re Greed? That seems like something lust would say,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Greed can apply to more than just possessions my dear sister, it can apply to power, love, people, emotions, sex, anything! I want it all! I simply choose to let the rest of you revel in whatever I claim for myself because I have no choice!&quot; Greed replied with a large toothy grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Motion carried since it’s almost unanimous, minus Wrath, hmm.... now how do we move the body?&quot; Pride asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Do we really have to move? I’m tired, can’t we do this tomorrow?&quot; Sloth asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I’m not sure but maybe it’s like we all move in unison? Maybe part of us is still controlling our base? Let’s try standing up on all fours..... this is so embarrassing... what will our family think when they see us this way?&quot; Envy asked <br />
<br />
&quot;Right.... well let’s just stand then,&quot; Pride said and you suddenly found you slowly standing up on all fours, like you could control your body as easily as you could with one head. Well at least there were one part of you that still had control over yourself, the you that was independent and part of every one of your heads at least had control.<br />
<br />
&quot;We actually did that?&quot; Gluttony asked and Envy slowly nodded,&quot;I... I think so.... huh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems we can move far more easily than at least I thought, perfect!&quot; Pride shouted then six heads paused when they felt a tongue licking their scaly balls, their tongue, or more specifically Lust.<br />
<br />
&quot;L-Lust stop that at once! We have to think!!&quot; Pride snarled <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on, we have some downtime, and I want to see how large and girthy our dragon in all cooped up in his sheathe~ Perhaps it’s even a double dragon, and after that our pussy looks nice and juicy~&quot; Lust grinned and Pride stretched his neck down,&quot;Not now I said, now yo-!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lust then kissed Pride on the cheek and whispered,&quot;If you let me do this, I’ll sleep around your neck tonight, and let you have me all to yourself~ You are the strongest, most intelligent and attractive one of us all, aren’t you~?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Lust.... we’re attached by the neck, pl-plus that’s basically incest if y-you actually w-wanna...&quot; Pride began then Lust interrupted him,&quot;It’s not incest if it’s with yourself silly~ Besides, I’m exhausted, and if I don’t do this I think we’re all going to have wet dreams~&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I..... fine!! Okay, we can do that, just don’t let greed keep you all to himself if he starts putting the moves on you~&quot; Pride said and Lust purred,&quot;I won’t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We all fucking head you talking,&quot; Wrath sighed and Greed peered under and said,&quot;Aww, lusty you’re so spunky, ordering around Pride using that charm of yours~ You’ve got to teach me your ways so I can improve my golden tongue~&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn’t the expression silver tongue?&quot; Envy asked and greed grinned,&quot;I believe good fits a bit better, and I think Pride wouldn’t mind that either~&quot; Greed then yawned and sighed,&quot;I hate to be like sloth right now but I am tired, so I’m going to doze off, Gluttony is already about to pass out, and I think we all could sleep after what we just went through.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wrath paused then sighed,&quot;I.... agree.... as much as I don’t want to, you’re right about that, Goodnight I guess.... Lust, Pride, Greed....Envy.&quot; Wrath said as you laid down on your side and curled up and Lust giggled as Envy and Greed soon closed their eyes and fell asleep along with Wrath, Gluttony, and Sloth was already out cold. Finally Pride and Lust followed their lead after Lust wrapped her neck around Pride’s and kissed him before they passed out.<br />
<br />
When you and your heads finally woke up something off had happened and you didn’t like it. It seems like each head was bound inside of a small corridor where they could look left or right and see the others, but each room was soundproof. It was like each head was sticking inside of a small gloryhole that they couldn’t get out of at least for the time being. Just then in front of one of the heads a scientist entered the room, they were male and holding a clipboard and said,&quot;Hello there subject-206-01, I am here to interview you.&quot;</p>
