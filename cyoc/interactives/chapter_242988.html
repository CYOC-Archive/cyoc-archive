<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thankfully, the night passed by without any further bear attacks. Even with the centaurs giving me a spare backpack for a pillow, I didn’t have the best night’s sleep though, given that my dreams were reflective of the life-changing events that I had recently bore witness to. I had a nightmare of Imogen passing away from her overdose…<br />
<br />
I woke up, panting – to find that both Robyn and I were still human. Both of us still underneath the large centaur-sized blanket that we were sharing. Whilst Citrine and Jade (still a pony) all rested peacefully, with blankets covering them. Keeping watch at that point in the night, at the entrance to the post office, were Icaro and Imogen. Just out of my sight – close to the single torch still burning. As I recovered my breath, I heard them speaking. I kept myself still, not wanting to disturb them, as Imogen asked the Criollo centaur questions about her new race. In return, he wanted to know more about her and our group. She was telling him about our household. How our parents died – leaving us the house and the two Iberian breed horses. <br />
<br />
“You are Charlie’s…non-identical…twin sister?” he said in his gruff voice, evidently learning terminology that was new to him.<br />
<br />
“Yes. I’m the elder, by a few minutes.”<br />
<br />
 “Are he and your cousin pair-bonded?” <br />
<br />
“Oh no! All three of us are single, since Robyn’s marriage broke down and she moved to the UK to live with us and help us out,” Imogen clarified for him. “You’re… You’re finding out who’s available on the market, aren’t you?”<br />
<br />
“On the market…? We hold markets in Chiron’s Grove, now that we understand the currency used by our predecessors…”<br />
<br />
“I mean who is single! All five of us are. Jade and Citrine have never mated with stallions. We got them from an Animal Rescue Centre, when they were young.” Imogen fell silent briefly, then changed the subject. “All the centaurs in this group are single, aren’t they? So my intuition is telling me.”<br />
<br />
“Yes. Though Tim and Cindy intend to bond when they are both eighteen years of age.”<br />
<br />
“Eh? They look as though they’re nineteen or twenty now. Now that I’ve regained my memories of Cindy, I reckon she must be about twenty. According to Robyn, Cindy would’ve been on that last girl scout troop trip seven years ago – when she had just become a teenager.”<br />
<br />
Icaro gave a hearty laugh. “The human-born amongst us have explained to us horse-borns that the year is longer on this world. And the days are longer too. That explains the age discrepancy. The human-borns of our kind now mark their birthdays once every year on this world, not by the Earth year.”<br />
<br />
“Oh.” My sister paused, before speaking again in a gentle tone. “I’m sorry that you lost your mate. If you don’t mind me asking… What happened?”<br />
<br />
Icaro sighed. “Six months have passed – but it is still too painful for me to dwell upon it for too long. In brief, there was a bear attack near Hylonome’s Haven, where I and my horse-born mate – Inca – were living. All centaurs are on a rota to help gather food in some way. And Inca and I were hunting – with Jeremy and his then-intended, Maggie – assisting. Jeremy threw his spear at the wrong moment during the fight… The lance pierced my Inca instead of the bear, which I managed to then kill. I know it was an incident… And I am trying to forgive Jeremy by taking him on this scouting trip, to train him survival skills. But my heart is still healing.” <br />
<br />
“I understand… I had a boyfriend once. But he abandoned me when I ended up in a wheelchair. He couldn’t cope with the drastic change in my lifestyle. So my brother looked after me instead.” Imogen paused, before continuing. “Maggie is no longer an item with Jeremy, then?”<br />
<br />
“No. The incident… It caused Maggie to distance herself from him. But they remain…cordial.” Icaro changed the topic. “It seems that Fate was careful to select you all because of your shared circumstances. I take it Charlie had no girlfriend?”<br />
<br />
“No. Charlie… My brother has a…hidden disability. It makes it harder for him to form romantic relationships. Despite that he still wants to find the right lady for himself.” <br />
<br />
“A shame. But at least he hasn’t been separated from a loved one by being brought here. And in this world I am sure that an available centaur mare would take interest in him…”<br />
<br />
Imogen gave a sudden laugh. “From what you’ve told me already, your goddess will send us signs at some stage, to help us find the right partner to bond with, after our transformations. Right?”<br />
<br />
“That is true. She wants us all to have someone to love, and be loved by. No one needs to be lonely for too long, amongst our people.” <br />
Imogen snorted. “The bottom line being that we’re here to be breeding stock.”<br />
<br />
“Besides helping our race to grow, by all of your party joining our kind. Then gaining new skills to help each of us survive and thrive… Yes. There will be a time for you new arrivals to breed as centaurs with other centaurs. But Epona is a good goddess. She genuinely wants us to be happy as her children. And her residue magic from our transformations sustains us.” Icaro sighed. “Thank you for taking the time to talk to me, Imogen. Wake up Maggie for me, please. It is her turn to join me on watch.”<br />
<br />
The conversation over, I turned on my other side and tried to doze off again. My mind mulled over what I’d just heard, as I tried to adapt to our new reality and all that it entailed…<br />
<br />
***<br />
There were barely any rations left to feed us all at breakfast, that morning, when we were stirred into action not long after sunrise. But the experienced centaurs told my group that once we reached the nearest stream to the north of the town, they would fish for our breakfast. And raid an apple orchard on the edge of Pholus Prior on the way out.<br />
<br />
For their toiletry needs, Kimberley escorted Imogen and Citrine to the nearest communal toilets and showers, close by. They were dotted around the town. When I asked how come the hot water was still running, I was told by Tim that Epona’s magic – plus some plumbing skills from him and Jeremy – had helped to restore the showers from their decades of neglect, after the terrible plague had struck and wiped out the original centaur race.<br />
<br />
When Imogen and Citrine returned from the showers, I made a joke to Imogen that even in this world, the girls went to the toilets together. She rolled her eyes.<br />
<br />
“We centaur mares have to do so, Charlie. We use the brushes in the toilets to wipe each other down, after we’ve peed and pooped. I can’t exactly rub behind me with toilet paper, now!”<br />
<br />
I sobered up, realising I was destined to end up the same way as the horses we had owned, where it came to the picture she was painting. “Ah… Right. Sorry... Hold on…! You’ve not put your glasses on yet, sis.” I pointed out.<br />
<br />
She smiled, showing the slightly distorted front teeth that gave her a somewhat bucktooth appearance. “I don’t need them anyone, Charlie. I can see perfectly well without ’em now. Since I woke up. My hearing is sharper too. My sense of smell, too.”<br />
<br />
“Enhanced senses – similar to a horse’s…,” I mused.<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Imogen looked reflective for a moment, then turned to the other centaurs. “Guys? I have a request to make before we leave town.”<br />
<br />
***<br />
That request turned out to be revisiting the bungalow at the back of the shop where Imogen’s wheelchair had been left. Whilst the others stayed outside, I accompanied Imogen as she trotted in and placed her hand on the arm of the wheelchair. <br />
<br />
“Thank you. And goodbye,” she whispered to it. She closed her eyes for moment – then reopened them, and nodded. “Let’s go, Charlie. I’ve said goodbye to my old life. Now I don’t even need to be on horseback to be able to move. I have my own horsepower, and I have my satchel and our family photo with me…”<br />
<br />
“And I don’t need to look after you…” I muttered. “I’m also trying to get used to the fact that you tower above me now.”<br />
<br />
“Hey! You may not be my carer anymore, Charlie – but that means you can now have a life of your own again! And we can still look after each other – as both brother and sister, and as herd-siblings. Once you’ve grown a mane, tail and another two legs and the hooves to go with them, like I have - that is.” Imogen gave me a teasing smile as she squeezed my shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Yeah. I’m still apprehensive about that… Still, let’s get going, then. We still all need to have breakfast…”<br />
<br />
“…and I’ve now got two stomachs to fill,” Imogen pointed out. Her teasing grin lingered. “Do you want to ride on me? I still remember the days when we used to give each other piggy back rides, as kids.”<br />
<br />
“Uh… Okay…,” I managed to say.<br />
<br />
“Then, after you’ve transformed, we can go racing! Like we did as kids.” Imogen smirked. “Only this time not on horses – but with our own hooves!”<br />
<br />
I groaned. “Let’s…not go there, right now, sis…”<br />
<br />
***<br />
With Robyn riding Jade, and the established centaurs taking both point and rearguard around us new arrivals, we set off from the town that was Pholus Prior, as the sun rose higher in the morning sky. The gulls were screeching again, and as we climbed a hill whilst following the paved road north, we could smell the sea air, not far away to the east. Evidently, the town was built on an estuary.<br />
As planned, we raided an apple orchard. Then, as we reached the fields and woods on the edge of town, Darwin took Maggie and Jeremy with him – crossbows and bow and arrows at the ready - whilst the others stayed with my group. Soon, the hunting party returned with their kills of several pheasants and rabbits. Meanwhile, Cindy got Citrine and Imogen to escort her into the woods, where the former girl scout taught them which mushrooms and nuts were in season and safe to gather for eating later. <br />
<br />
Whilst the Chinese-ethnic centaur, Kimberley, watched over Jade, and Darwin acted as look out, Tim taught me and Robyn how to light a fire– and we all soon ate enough skinned and cooked meat to fill our stomachs. Before we moved on, Imogen and Citrine were instructed to gather water for us all using the metals flasks the centaurs carried. There was a large pool at a nearby shrine – and the bubbling spring water would be safe to drink, they were told. <br />
<br />
After a few minutes, when they didn’t reappear, my anxiety prompted me to search for them. I found the two new centauresses, with their filled flasks, gazing at themselves in the reflection of the pool, taking in their new forms in their entirety for the first time. Before I could call out to them, they started talking between themselves. <br />
<br />
“How are you adjusting to this, Citrine? Granted, I’ve more than doubled in size, and grown two extra legs and a tail – but you’ve grown two arms and gained human intelligence. It must be…profound for you,” Imogen murmured to her.<br />
<br />
“It is, my former mistress. The change did hurt – but not for long. Being trapped in that collapsed building was actually…a more terrifying ordeal,” Citrine answered. “I am getting used to using my…fingers and thumbs, to grasp and hold. I am listening to conversations, and seem to fully understand them. And after our breakfast, I feel…good. Strong. The air is clean in this world. Fresh. No…traffic. I like it. Being transformed from a horse into a centaur feels…liberating. I wish to learn from the experiences of the other horse-borns.” She paused. “And you, Imogen?”<br />
<br />
“Now that my two stomachs are filled, I feel strong too. I’ve got the knack of walking with four legs. I want to increase my pace when I can. I’m feeling the urge to run, to gallop. I’ve been liberated too, Citrine! I feel…free.”<br />
<br />
“That’s good to hear,” I declared, as I stepped forward, interrupting them. “The others are waiting for us.”<br />
<br />
Citrine nodded. “Then we should move. We need to keep close together. A phase is in my mind… ‘Safety in numbers’?<br />
<br />
“Yeah. That’s right. Well, as a centaur, you’re still a herd creature, Citrine. Only I’m feeling the instinct to stick close to my new kind, too,” Imogen sighed. “Let’s head back, guys.”<br />
<br />
But as Imogen trotted away, Citrine lingered by the pool. “I have not thanked you for rescuing me, Charlie. I am grateful.”<br />
<br />
I returned her smile. “Glad to get you out of there, Citrine. Of course, I didn’t realise it was you at the time… Er… What I mean is… Someone desperately needed help, and I was there to provide it. It didn’t matter who it was,” I stumbled with my answer, feeling out of my comfort zone with the bizarre circumstances. Our former horse was now talking as intelligently as though she had been born human. With just some fumbling over the occasional word.<br />
<br />
“You have a good heart, Charlie. You put yourself in potential danger by rushing to help me. And you are loyal to your remaining…family. I sense that when you are a centaur, you will be even more loyal to the rest of your new kind.” Citrine turned her freckled face and hazel eyes towards the pool once more, contemplating not just her reflection but also mine. At that moment, she was wearing one of the waist-long tunics as per the ones I’d seen in that centaur clothing shop. But she had the top buttons undone, and I glimpsed that Citrine was now wearing a bra underneath.<br />
<br />
She caught my stare and smiled. “You seem…distracted?” she put to me.<br />
<br />
“Hmm…? Oh! Sorry! You’ve got new clothes…”<br />
<br />
Citrine nodded. “Before we left that…town, Kimberley escorted me to one of the clothing shops, to find me a…bra…of the right size, as well as a tunic. It feels strange wearing false skins over a bare upper body – but they fit. And they are keeping me warm. Kimberley told me it would all feel perfectly normal before long – having the breasts of a human woman, and wearing…clothes…above my new waist.” She faced me and smirked.<br />
<br />
“W-what?” I stuttered.<br />
<br />
“You are…blushing, no? You look… What is the human word? Ah, you look…cute! I wonder what exactly you will look like when you become a centaur stallion…” And with a giggle, Citrine turned her equine trunk around and walked off, leaving me reeling at the realisation that our former horse had just…flirted…with me.<br />
<br />
***<br />
We made our way on northwards, making good progress along the wide, worn trail that was the shortest route to Hylonome’s Haven. At midday, we reached some hills and a flowing river that the centaurs wanted to cast their nets in, in order to catch some of the large fish that swam in it. Imogen offered to help Icaro and Kimberley with the nets, so she waded in. But after delivering one load of netted fish to Tim - for him and Cindy to cook, Imogen started to head back into the river – only for the soaked clay soil bank she was treading on to suddenly break up under her weight and give way. She screamed, fell into the stream, and started to be swept downriver.<br />
<br />
“Imogen!” both Robyn and I yelled out.<br />
<br />
The centaurs acted quickly. Icaro leapt into the deeper waters to swim after her. And whilst Robyn and I ran along the bankside and tossed a couple of large fallen tree branches into the stream for Imogen to cling onto, Jeremy quickly threw a rope over to Icaro, as the Criollo centaur managed to grab hold of the panicking Imogen. With Icaro having tied the rope around the waists of himself and my sister as she held onto him fiercely, the rest of us pulled together to get the two heavy centaurs out of the cold water. Managing to control my panic, I heard Jade haltingly instruct me to tie the end of the rope around her neck. And so, with the added pulling force from our Welsh pony, we finally managed to save Imogen and Icaro.<br />
<br />
The emergency over, I collapsed on the riverbank with Robyn hugging me, crying with relief. Imogen herself, I noticed, was still tied to Icaro, the pair of them slumped on the riverside pebbles as they recovered from their near brush with death.<br />
<br />
“Jeremy…,” Icaro managed to speak.<br />
<br />
“Y-yes, Icaro?” the youth squeaked.<br />
<br />
The Criollo gave him an approving nod. “You did well by throwing me that rope. Imogen and I owe all of you thanks – but I believe your quick thinking, Jeremy, was instrumental in saving us.”<br />
<br />
Jeremy seemed stunned at being praised by the mate of the centaur he had accidentally killed, months before. Then he beamed. “Glad you’re both safe,” he called back.<br />
<br />
Eventually, with a shaken Imogen wrapped in a large blanket, we were able to enjoy our lunch of freshly-cooked fish and mushrooms. A little later, as the party rested, I walked off a short distance, feeling the need to relieve myself in the nearby woods. I headed behind a now-collapsed old building where there were some thick bushes, and…<br />
<br />
Oh.<br />
<br />
The young centaur Tim was already there, with the same aim in mind. Doing a number one, as we call it, anyway. I was about to turn away – but I found myself frozen as I saw Tim’s equine phallus in action. Held in place by a furred sheath. It was just the same as with any stallion or colt, of course. Having seen Imogen’s abrupt transformation, and remembering that the centaurs had told me that the same fate would strike me, Robyn, and Jade... Well, I just froze at the sudden realisation of how I would get to pee in the future...<br />
Finishing his need, Tim sniffed the air, then turned round and saw me. He grinned. “Large penis envy, Charlie?” he teased me.<br />
<br />
“Um. No….” I cleared my throat, embarrassed.<br />
<br />
“I have to admit that when us boy scouts saw several of the adults and their horses being transformed into centaurs, I was keen to snatch glimpses of their privates. Don’t judge me too much – I was thirteen at the time. Then Epona blessed me and the other boy scouts, so that we all became colts. And the girl scouts became fillies. Anyway. Don’t worry, you’ll soon have your own huge set of male genitals! And you’ll be hung like a horse, of course – just like me and the other stallions and colts. You’ll be a fellow herd brother. A welcome addition to our growing family!” Tim’s expression turned serious as I remained still and silent. “You’re worried. I can smell your anxiety. You’re not looking forward to leaving the human race – and not knowing when it’ll happen.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I am,” I admitted.<br />
<br />
“Well, it seems that our goddess had a hard task in healing your sister, whilst transforming her – as well as changing Citrine. And it always happens at night. I don’t know why – but that’s when Epona’s magic is strongest, I guess. And it’s likely that Epona will change you, your pony, and Cindy’s mom all at the same time, once she is able to channel enough energy to do so. Therefore…”<br />
<br />
“…it won’t be tonight,” I concluded, sighing with relief. So I had some time.<br />
<br />
“Reckon so. Hope that helps ease your anxiety.” Tim paused. “Look, I get it. None of us came here of our own choice. And none of us were allowed to decide whether to become centaurs or not. But once you’ve changed, you’ll grow to love it. Honest! We are stronger, tougher, and more in tune with nature. And galloping for the sheer pleasure of it, especially when racing and playing sports with friends…”<br />
<br />
“…beats video games and action movies?” I managed to smile.<br />
<br />
“Sure does,” Tim laughed. “Not that we have any harnessed electricity on this world…” He trailed off and sniffed the air again. He gave a coy smile. “I’d better give you some space.” And with that, he turned and slinked off.<br />
<br />
Seconds later, I had pulled off my shoes, trousers, and underpants, in order to go both front and back way. I used some of the large fallen leaves as toilet paper. Then I squirted my hands from the hand gel tube that had been on my person when we’d been sent through the portal… <br />
<br />
There was a giggle from the undergrowth. Yelling, I spun round and tripped over my dropped trousers. Luckily not in the direction of the soiled leaves…<br />
<br />
“Citrine!” I gnashed my teeth. “It is not good form to spy upon someone taking a pee and a poo!”<br />
<br />
The strawberry-blonde, freckled centaur emerged from her hiding place amongst the trees and bushes, grinning. “You spied upon Tim,” she pointed out. So it was her who he had detected. And he left us two together…<br />
<br />
“That was an accident! You’re doing it deliberately, aren&#39;t you?” I quickly pulled up my underpants to make myself decent, before seeing to my trousers and shoes.<br />
<br />
“Yes. I wanted to see what your naked legs looked like. As well as your…human malehood.”<br />
<br />
“For heaven’s sake… Why!?”<br />
<br />
Citrine’s mischievous grin lingered. “So that when you become a centaur stallion I will be able to contrast a before-and-after image of you, in my mind.”<br />
<br />
I rubbed my forehead and sighed. “You’re…becoming drawn to me, aren’t you?”<br />
<br />
The expression of the new-born centauress turned earnest. “I…think that I am, Charlie. There was some magical connection when we first touched after my transformation. That contact with our hands that made me tingle…”<br />
<br />
“I…felt that as well,” I admitted. “Look… I’ll be honest, Citrine. I find you pretty. But you’re a centaur now – and I’m still human. And… Well, I’ve not had much experience in love. Never had a girlfriend. Lost my virginity to…a prostitute. I… Wh-why am I being so honest with you?”<br />
<br />
Citrine glanced at the ground, as she pawed at the ground with a fore hoof. “You, Imogen, and Robyn have been good to me and Jade, since you became our owners… The… What would you call it? An animal shelter… They were kind also. Whereas my first owner was cruel. I think he regarded his horses as…financial assets, not animals needing love. We went cold, wet, hungry… For a time, I was…diseased.”<br />
<br />
“I’d heard that from the rescue centre,” I sniffed, feeling the familiar sorrow return, upon hearing Citrine’s early life directly from her. “I’m so sorry…”<br />
<br />
Citrine smiled. “Do not be! You and your family made sure that Jade and I had a lovely new home, with plenty to eat and drink – and with space to roam. You all kept us healthy, warm, and safe! I enjoyed being a riding mount for all of you. In particular, I sensed the freedom and joy that Jade and I gave poor Imogen. And…you used to talk to me about your personal problems when you tended me as a horse. Such as the time just before we came here. You told me and Jade that we were about to have a man look at us. A potential buyer. Your family was running out of money to keep us.”<br />
 <br />
“Y-you understood that?”<br />
<br />
“At the time, I understood the tone of your words more that the words themselves. We took in your distress and feeling of hopelessness. You, Robyn, and Imogen. But now I recall the words in many past conversations as you three spoke to us during our grooming and riding. And I now know the meanings of those words said to us.” Citrine trotted forwards and laid a hand on my shoulder. “I am now beginning to understand your…autism. Your past communication difficulties with some people, your schooling, and your hurdles in forming meaningful romantic relationships. I am sorry for your pain, Charlie” she whispered gently. “Let me bring you some comfort. We can be…friends?”<br />
<br />
I found myself blinking aside sudden tears as I rested my hand on hers. “Thanks,” I managed to say, feeling the lump in my throat. “Yes. We can be friends.”<br />
<br />
“Why was I called…Citrine?”<br />
<br />
“That was Imogen’s idea. She’s into gemstones. Citrine and Jade are gemstones – and your fur colouring is close to Citrine,” I explained. “Don’t you like it?”<br />
<br />
“It was fine for me when I was a horse. But I am half-human now…” Citrine squeezed my hand. “I would like to have a human name, Charlie. Can you think of something suitable for you to call me?”<br />
<br />
So, she wanted me to feel comfortable with her – to the point of giving her a new name. That was major. So I gave it some serious thought. “It would be easier for me, Imogen, and Robyn, if I gave you a lady’s name that was similar to Citrine… Wait! How about Catherine?”<br />
<br />
“Kath-her-reen…” She played with the name on her tongue, and then gave me a winning smile and hugged me from her higher elevation. “I like it, Charlie! Thank you. Let us tell the others that I am now called Catherine...” <br />
<br />
She was interrupted by the sound of huffing. Animal scents hit our nostrils as the direction of the breeze suddenly changed. Slowly, we both turned round – to see a pair of black bears within a clearing of the woods, not far away. They were eyeing each other up, teeth bared. A territorial dispute, then.<br />
<br />
One of Catherine’s hands was still clutching mine. I felt her shiver. “Bears… I do not…like them,” she murmured.<br />
<br />
“They seem to be more aggressive on this world. We’d…better all get away here, whilst they’re busy with each other.” <br />
<br />
My centaur companion lowered herself to the ground, and nickered to me. “Climb on! We will get back to the rest of the group quicker that way.”<br />
<br />
I paused, but Catherine’s smile won me over. I climbed onto her, and tightly wrapped my hands around her tunic, just above her waist. Patting my hands with one of hers, she rose and set off into a quick trot.<br />
<br />
No doubt Imogen and Robyn would be giving me and our former horse strange looks at this new friendship... Oh well. Have love, will travel, I mused to myself…</p>
