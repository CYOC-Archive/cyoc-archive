<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;m a TOON! And not just any toon I&#39;m your imaginary friend, Littlequill!&quot; John said with an exited tone. &quot;I was planning to tell you everything when we got to our hotel room, but now&#39;s as good a time as any!&quot;<br />
&quot;B-but how can you be him when toons can&#39;t leave Toonworld?&quot; said a very confused Carrie.<br />
&quot;Do you want the long version or the short version of the story?&quot;Said John. &quot;The long version I guess, I think I need to hear this one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright! So this all started back when you were a little foal, I-I mean kid heh. You didn&#39;t have any human friends yet and this was a year before mankind discovered Toonworld so you used your imagination to make the first version of me. See, what many people don&#39;t know, is Imaginary friends are just another type of toon and only kids can see us, but since our worlds were still separated all we could do was talk to and see each other. <br />
<br />
But eventually your parents convinced you that I wasn&#39;t real and we stopped playing but I never forgot about you. I still held on to the hope that you would imagine me again some day, and you did, but this time you recreated me as your <br />
My Little Pony FiM OC And I got the name Littlequill. I even got my own cutie mark! Later on when you grew old enough to start dating, I was still in your mind but I started to want more. I was getting jealous of the people who wanted to date you and I wanted a chance to be more than just fictional to you, so I found out that Toons were starting to visit your world by making themselves human and I saw my chance to finally meet you after so long.<br />
<br />
That was  around the time that you were offering art commissions on that drawing website you go to and under the username Mr.Brony I asked you to draw a guy transforming into Littlequill and soon after, we started talking about other things. <br />
I eventually asked to meet you for a date in the city where you lived and you said yes, so I used the transformation picture that you made to make a human body for myself, with the help of the toons in the information center near the portal and I finally got to experience Earth for real for the first time in my fictional life! I&#39;m pretty sure you know everything that happened after that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow. That&#39;s quite the story.&quot; Said Carrie. &quot;I had no idea you were capable of keeping something this huge from me for so long. But now that you told me all that, you probably want to be your real self again huh?&quot; &quot;If you&#39;ll let me.&quot; said John.<br />
&quot;Of course I&#39;ll let you honey! You probably miss being able to use your special talent.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you so so much Carrie! It&#39;ll be so refreshing to see you with my own eyes again! Um, could you please step back a bit while I&#39;m changing? my real self is bigger than you might think.&quot;<br />
&quot;Alright then.&quot; Said John as he grabbed a coin from behind his back and tossed it into the well. &quot;I wish I was in my Toon body again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Immediately Johns body began glowing with a bright white light that was strong enough to hide all of his body. His bright white silhouette then stretched, shrank, and changed, until it looked like a slightly shorter outline of big mac. The light then faded to reveal John surrounded by shreds of fabric that used to be his clothes and underwear, looking completely like a white furred pony except for his hair and the lack of a horn and tail. This quickly changed as Johns black hair grew into a horses mane that looked like a large mullet while a single white unicorn horn grew out of his forehead and his eyes grew larger while their color became black with a dark blue outline. Then, while his mane had almost finished growing, A large black horse tail quickly grew out of his butt and finally his cutie mark appeared in the form of a black quill and a black curving line. After his transformation ended, he used his special talent to create a black bandana that he hung around his neck. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do you think?&quot; Said Littlequill.<br />
&quot;I think you looks absolutely adorable!! And you were right you &#39;re a lot bigger than I thought you&#39;d be. Why is that?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, back when you first made me you wanted a pony big enough to ride, so I just kept growing to match your size.&quot;<br />
&quot;And I know this might be a strange question, but how does your talent work again?&quot; I didn&#39;t get much of a chance to draw it while we were dating.&quot; Said Carrie curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh um sure.&quot;Said Littlequill. &quot;It kind of works like a green lantern ring, only, the things I make are solid black and they stick around until I get rid of them or they get wet. I think that&#39;s why you didn&#39;t give me the ability to swim. Also, because I&#39;m not an alicorn I get around the flight restriction by doing THIS!&quot; Just then Littlequill&#39;s horn began to glow with magic and a harness with solid black wings and a saddle appeared already strapped to his back. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wow.&quot;Said Carrie. &quot;That&#39;s really impressive in person. So, um I was thinking. You probably want to stay like this from now on right?&quot; &quot;Yeah, why?&quot; &quot;Well does this mean I have to go back to earth without you now?&quot; Carrie said with a hint of disappointment in her voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Actually,&quot; Said Littlequill,&quot;that brings up the other surprise I was going to tell you. Since I was watching over you for so long before we started dating, the house I live in here is an exact replica of the one that you had before you moved to that city        house except slightly changed to fit in with the houses you&#39;d find in Equestria. Absolutely everything you have in your home is here in Toonworld. So if you want to, you could become a toon and live with me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? You mean it? Of course I&#39;ll do it! How do I become a toon?&quot; Said a now exited Carrie. <br />
&quot;You do remember we&#39;re at a wishing well right dear? Toons don&#39;t need official IDs like humans do, All you need to do is transform and that&#39;s that! You&#39;re even one step closer to being a toon already!&quot;<br />
&quot;What makes you say that?&quot; Said Carrie.<br />
&quot;Well, you do have a fursona right?&quot; <br />
&quot;I can be her? Really? But isn&#39;t she a toon here?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, fursonas are a special case. They&#39;re really little more than placeholders since a fursona is just the essence of what you want yourself to be. They&#39;re pretty much just costumes. You&#39;re safe if you want to be her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well alright then, I&#39;ll do it.&quot;Said Carrie while nervously dropping a coin into the wishing well. &quot;I wish I was becoming my....&quot;</p>
