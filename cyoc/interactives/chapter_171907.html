<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vern and Al worked to get the kennels insulated and heated. Al grew younger, but at a much slower pace than Vern. The theory was Al&#39;s transformation was less than Vern&#39;s. This theory was backed up in other differences between Al and Vern, such as Vern&#39;s sensitive nipples and Al&#39;s mostly human sense of smell compared to Vern&#39;s very keen nose. Al made sure to update the photo on his driver&#39;s license every few months, as he looked about forty. Vern even worked up the nerve to suck Al&#39;s cock, even taking his knot orally. Al let Vern do what he was comfortable with, never pushing for more, grateful for the life he now enjoyed. Vern ignored the voice in the back of his head for a while, but it never went away, then one morning Vern stood in front of the bathroom sink, looking in the mirror at the dildo he held in his hand. Vern took apart the dildo to put in a battery when Al gently squeezed Vern&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you doing that for?&quot; asked Al.<br />
<br />
Vern slowly put the dildo back together, without the battery inside. Vern&#39;s eyes met Al&#39;s eyes staring into him through the mirror. Vern sighed and was breathing slowly, but deeply. Vern put the dildo down on the bathroom counter, then turned and hugged Al tightly. Vern was slightly shorter than Al, and leaned his head under Al&#39;s chin. Al wrapped his arms around Vern&#39;s shoulders.<br />
<br />
Al massaged Vern&#39;s shoulders as they hugged, &quot;We can fight the urge to use that thing again.&quot; Al knew something was triggering this, as he had lost count the number of times he found Vern about to use or having inserted the canine dildo into himself. Vern had puffier, darker nipples now, his face was much softer and feminine, and a slightly longer and flatter tongue from the brief times Vern had the dildo inside him before Al came along to bring Vern back to reality. Vern was always angry with himself when sanity and clarity restored itself, and he realized what he had done. Al had read the instructions with the dildo many times, but the end result of the changes was never mentioned.<br />
<br />
A very tearful Vern, still hugging Al tightly, asked weakly, &quot;I am ready to continue. Will you help me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Al was afraid to accept, as Vern was asking to continue down an unknown path to an unknown destination. &quot;If you are sure of this, I am here to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vern spent the rest of that day in the kennel, locked in the isolation cage with the dildo knotted inside him. Al kept a constant watch right outside the cage as Vern&#39;s changes accelerated. Al watched as Vern&#39;s breasts grew, along with his butt and thighs. Fur begain to grow, and his feet reshaped to a canine form. Vern&#39;s face grew a muzzle, and his hands grew pawpads and his fingernails became claws. Vern ate and drank everything Al slide into the cage. Al fell asleep as Vern looked like a grotesque dog woman, with a misshapen human head sporting a canine snout, and crooked, deformed teeth. Al woke up to Vern sliding an empty bowl on the floor. Vern could not speak, but he was hungry. Vern also passed the dildo to Al, and pointed at the dildo and made a twisting motion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Battery?&quot; asked Al.<br />
<br />
Vern shook his head yes, and then turned his focus to eating. Al returned as the bowel was empty, and offered the dildo with fresh battery to Vern through the bars, where it quickly was turned on and disappeared into Vern&#39;s very pungent pussy. Fur covered much of Vern&#39;s body, but Al could clearly see Vern&#39;s now huge breasts and now very canine ears on a head that was no longer human. Al left the kennel because of Vern&#39;s smell, and went back into the house to rub out his throbbing canine hard on. Al teared up when he walked back to the isolation cage and only saw a human size female Labrador retriever, curled up and twitching in orgasm from the dildo inside her. Al filled up the empty bowl, and left the kennel, the pit of regret swelling in his stomach. Al avoided the kennel until the next morning. Vern had been in the cage for three days.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vern?&quot; asked Al, looking at the naked human teenage female standing in the isolation cage.<br />
<br />
Vern smiled and with an upbeat tone said, &quot;Still here. The battery is dead though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Al went over and unlocked the cage for Vern. &quot;I should call you jailbait. Damn,&quot; Al said in awe.<br />
<br />
Vern held out his hand, and could cause his fingernails to darken and become claws, then shrink his fingers and hand into a paw, then back into a very female hand. &quot;I am still working on how to control it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Al kissed Vern deeply, and Vern returned the kiss. Afterward, Vern looked up (was Vern shorter, thought Al), and said, &quot;Ummmm....I..uh....need.....I need you....now. Hmmmmm.....now.&quot; Al lifted his hand to wave to the door of the kennel, and Vern briskly walked to the kitchen door, and into the bedroom, where he pulled out the shrunken dildo and put it on the nightstand before rolling onto his back as Al walks in, stripping what clothes he had on. &quot;Don&#39;t take too long Al,&quot; chided Vern.<br />
<br />
Al glared at Vern, then jumped onto the bed and grabbed one of his breasts with one hand, and used his other hand to help position himself into Vern&#39;s waiting canine pussy. Al went after Vern&#39;s nipple with strong suction and tongue action, using his hips to get into a steady rhythm of thrusting quick into Vern, then slowly pulling out, before hammering down again. Al&#39;s knot popped after a few thrusts, and it was just a few more thrusts that Vern went over the edge himself. Al fought with Vern to keep up his slow thrusting and switching to the neglected nipple. Soon, Vern relaxed and Al rested on top of Vern, giving his nipples a rest. Vern kept squeezing Al&#39;s knot to keep him nice and swollen for as long as he could. Vern felt he had more control and could squeeze tighter than before. Al pulled out when his knot finally shrunk down.<br />
<br />
Al rolled onto his side, admiring the chest profile of his fuck buddy. Al smiled and said, &quot;So...the honeymoon is over?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vern gives a low growl, his body covered in fur as his body transforms into an anthro labrador retriever. &quot;Wress, wriss reels wood,&quot; says a transforming Vern.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your scooby doo now?&quot; asks Al.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rye thung ith thoo nong thoo thalk creary.&quot; Vern slowly says, attempting to enunciate with the limitations of a canine tongue.<br />
<br />
Al reaches over and gives Vern&#39;s furry belly a good rub. Vern relaxes, but moves his hips and butt to let his tail grow out and down between his legs. Al reaches over Vern, bringing his arm under his breasts and closes his eyes for a brief sleep. Vern&#39;s own eyes close and soon both are asleep.</p>
