<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Deciding that you&#39;ve had enough fun at the mall you catch a bus back to campus. There&#39;s still three more days before classes start, but after last semester you&#39;ve learned your lesson. Moving in early is worth it for the amount of stress it saves, especially considering your roommate this year. Jack isn&#39;t a bad guy, honestly for a jock he&#39;s not bad at all. He&#39;s way more laid back than you ever expected a football player to be and he&#39;s always been willing to invite you to the parties that he goes to with the rest of the team. Despite the two of you having absolutely nothing in common you get along surprisingly well. It&#39;s just that as a member of the football team he arrives a month before the rest of the students and last semester he managed to make a mess of the dorm room in that month. After living with him for half a year you quickly learned that picking up after himself isn&#39;t one of his strong suits and this semester is going about the same as the last. So far you&#39;ve managed to get things mostly back in order, leaving you with little more than to get your textbooks and get ready for classes next week.<br />
<br />
Getting off the bus you walk across campus. Several of the guys on the football team shout &#39;hi&#39; to you and you wave back. Because Jack counts you as a friend they consider you a friend as well, which goes completely against what you expected football players to be like.<br />
<br />
As soon as you reach the door to your dorm room you realize that something&#39;s wrong and you know exactly what it is. The mess Jack makes when you&#39;re not around to clean up is nothing compared to the biggest problem with sharing a room with him, a problem that didn&#39;t exist until halfway through last semester: his girlfriend Lisa. You have no clue what a nice guy like Jack sees in a bitch like her, except that maybe she&#39;s not as terrible to him as she is to everyone else. During finals week last semester she actually moved in with the two of you, despite campus regulations. She arrived one night with all her stuff and dumped it on Jack&#39;s bed, telling some story about how her roommates both hated her and she couldn&#39;t take it anymore. Once she moved in she managed to spread her stuff everywhere, eat any food that wasn&#39;t hidden and borrow textbooks, laptops, clothing and anything else she wanted to without asking first. It got so bad that you took to studying in the library and Jack started spending an inordinate amount of time at the gym, where, according to the other guys on the team, he was hiding in the weight-room to study. Worse than being a distraction, Lisa was rude, ruse to you, rude to Jack&#39;s friends and on some level, rude to Jack.<br />
<br />
And she&#39;d already been in your dorm room.<br />
<br />
Opening the door you&#39;re greeted by a quite the sight. All of your clothing and a good amount of Jack&#39;s has been pulled out of the closet and has been scattered across the floor and Lisa&#39;s has been hung haphazardly in its place. She&#39;s gotten into Jack&#39;s stash of beer, the case he&#39;d been saving for tonight to share with his friends, leaving an empty can on top of your bookshelf. She didn&#39;t even bother to hide the case, which could get the three of you in a huge amount of trouble since the dorm is supposed to be a dry one.<br />
<br />
Even more frustrating, she&#39;s sprawled out on your bed, sound asleep. By the way she&#39;s dressed, or isn&#39;t dressed, it looks like she&#39;d been hoping for Jack to arrive and give him a nice &#39;fun&#39; surprise. You can&#39;t begrudge him that, she is attractive, if you&#39;re interested in leggy blonds with enormous breasts, which Jack is. Grumbling to yourself you get ready to yell at her to leave, only to remember the flashlight. You take it out of your pocket, and look back and forth between it and Lisa, asleep in her red lacy panties and bra.<br />
<br />
An idea comes to you and you skim the instructions that came with the light, looking to see what else you might be able to do with it. You&#39;d already seen that the longer you shine it on someone the stronger and faster the changes are based on the intensity of the light so you&#39;re not surprised to learn that making quick passes with the light can result in more superficial changes.<br />
<br />
For the first time you turn the light to its &#39;a&#39; setting, since you want Lisa to know what&#39;s happened. Then you put it to a blue setting just above medium and set it to &#39;or&#39;.<br />
<br />
Smiling to yourself you quickly pass it it over the sleeping Lisa.<br />
<br />
Nothing happens with the first pass, at least nothing you can see.<br />
<br />
A second pass and you start to see the first subtle changes, the fine hairs on her arms and legs darken.<br />
<br />
Once more and you can see them easily. They&#39;re still fine and sparse, but they&#39;re easily visible now, like she forgot to shave her legs for a few days. It&#39;s a good start and you happily keep going.<br />
<br />
Quickly you fall into a pattern of flicking the light on and off, watching as the changes continue.<br />
<br />
The first few hairs appear, creeping up from below the waistband of her panties. You watch as they increase in number, growing thicker as they creep their way up to her navel to give her a handsome treasure trail.<br />
<br />
Her legs are starting to get hairy as well, curls of pubic hair escaping from her skimpy panties to spread across the insides of her thighs. It&#39;s like watching time-lapse video of grass growing as it spreads down her legs.<br />
<br />
Shifting in her sleep she rubs at her chest, causing her bra to come unfastened. Her ample breasts to fall free. She&#39;s a c-cup, something that you only know because she&#39;s mentioned it to you several times. You look at her breasts, your smile growing wider. There are downy little hairs on her chest, and with the help of the light they grow darker and thicker. New hairs start sprouting, long, coarse strands begin to appear around her nipples and spread out from there, flowing across her chest. Her treasure trail has continued to grow, moving up and growing wider. Eventually it meets with her chest hair, giving her a truly impressive pelt, one that would look right at home on a man. You&#39;re not done yet though.<br />
<br />
For good measure you make a few passes with the light over her face, specifically her cheeks and chin. The first hints of stubble appear and sideburns grow in. You&#39;re tempted to stop there, but then you consider how rude she is and that it&#39;s just hair after all. Once she wakes up she can shave it off. With that in mind you keep going, watching as the stubble becomes a genuine five o&#39;clock shadow and from there an actual mustache and beard.<br />
<br />
When you&#39;re done she&#39;s as hairy as any man and, in your opinion, better looking for it. Putting the light away you quietly back out of the room and close the door behind you.<br />
<br />
Now you have a lot to consider. Do you go in and wake her up? Hang out and wait for Jack so you can see how he responds? Or do you want to go for a walk around campus and test the light some more?</p>
