<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So you got a week off?&quot; Marci asked to her husband, giddy at the prospect of their own happily ever after.<br />
<br />
&quot;Starting Saturday,&quot; Teddy said slowly, &quot;I&#39;ll still have paperwork and stuff to finish out for this week... but I don&#39;t think the Bureau will be assigning me any new cases until after I get back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marci smiled and went about closing the blinds to the windows in their apartment. After all, if she was to transform, she couldn&#39;t let any one see her and if she decided to simply be naked, she couldn&#39;t let anyone see her. And with Teddy saying that he would be getting time off was something that was very good news, especially after what they had learned about Moon Lake. She had loved Teddy with all her heart, ever since he saved her from an angry ex. He&#39;d been kind and strong, and despite being in a position where he could have put her in a world of legal hurt, he didn&#39;t and promised to love and protect her to the best of his ability. She couldn&#39;t remember how many tears of joy she&#39;d shed on their wedding day.<br />
<br />
But Marci at times also felt some sadness. She had barely aged, if at all, since they&#39;d met, but Teddy was in his forties now and did look older. It was at times like this that she wished she wasn&#39;t a werecat, as her moms had always warned her that the werecat strain of the werevirus would kill normal men. Marci had always asked why, but they never had a real answer to it, it was simply the way it was, and until Teddy became a were as well, they could never take their relationship to its fullest and Marci also knew that if that was impossible, the love of her life would grow old and die before her. There were times privately that she had broke down at that thought. But Moon Lake offered a chance to fix that. A town full of weres and weres of all kinds. Teddy would get his chance to be with her. She hoped he&#39;d be a tiger, a white tiger with ice blue eyes, white fur and brownish/black stripes. Above all, she hoped he&#39;d be happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that is good, after all the stuff you had to go through with regard to hunting that rat,&quot; Marci commented referring to Lionel Ulysses.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose,&quot; Teddy commented, &quot;it was frustrating... and the consequences of what happened later still have me a bit nervous, but with regard to national level news... the initial shock and surprise has pretty much gone away in suspicion of the tail being a fake and his killer a rival drug dealer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marci glanced back to him, &quot;Who do you think killed him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I really don&#39;t know,&quot; Teddy replied, &quot;crooks like that always have enemies. A rival gang could have killed him if he trespassed on their turf and acted now because he was wounded in the arrest and thus couldn&#39;t hide from them... Shoot... there is even the potential for another rogue were to have killed him thinking that killing Ulysses would help protect the secret of weres existence... but... the Seattle PD have taken over the case for the murder and the Seattle field office has accepted it... and since catching Ulysses was done... I can&#39;t involve myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Teddy then walked over and pulled Marci into a firm hug and then gave her a loving kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;And neither do I want to,&quot; Teddy spoke, &quot;with things quieting down... I think our main goal should be a nice vacation to blow off stress... let me become your tiger... and then make as much love to you as I can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... Teddy!&quot; Marci smiled and kissed him back.<br />
<br />
They kissed fairly passionately for a few moments, but when Teddy began to massage her breasts, Marci pulled back. The two chuckled and resumed a more rational stance as they headed for their bedroom and to prepare for bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... do you have any cases coming up?&quot; Teddy asked Marci as they entered their bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;The firm has some cases... but none that I&#39;ve been personally assigned to,&quot; Marci answered as she climbed onto the bed and closed the bedroom blinds, &quot;and given that both of us have tried to be pretty focused on our work, I&#39;m sure I can get a week off for some personal time.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then looked back to Teddy as she began to transform, revealing the cat inside her. She felt her body grow warm as white fur covered her body and grew out. Her fingernails sharpened and lengthened into cat claws while her ears became triangular and moved to the top of her head. She quietly disrobed as she transformed, feeling her breasts strain against her bra as she changed and she felt great relief when she got it off and felt her generous werecat bosom bounce free, and remained very firm as well, which was fairly typical for female weres. As Marci finished disrobing, she felt her spine lengthen into a long white furred tail which she happily raised and twitched behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;And then will come the day when the tiger I&#39;ve seen in you is real and can come out to play with me,&quot; Marci smiled as she tossed her clothes in a dirty clothes basket.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll still need to pack and find a spot in Moon Lake where we can stay,&quot; Teddy told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a hotel or something we can stay in,&quot; Marci commented, &quot;the big thing would be finding weretigress willing to transform you and maybe even open to letting me come along as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You...&quot; Teddy said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am bi, dear,&quot; Marci answered, &quot;and as a were... I&#39;ve had a real itch that won&#39;t get scratched until you are a were... and I want to be with you every step of the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Teddy commented, &quot;though we&#39;ll also need to arrange a flight to Seattle...&quot;<br />
<br />
Teddy calmly approached the bed in his sleepwear, and to Marci looking as handsome as he always did. Marci moved back and settled onto the bed. She softly patted Teddy&#39;s side of their shared bed with one paw to beacon him to the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can handle that... and we do have the money for a domestic flight,&quot; Marci assured him, &quot;Then come Saturday, we can have a much needed vacation... but for the moment, let us cuddle and dream of our own happy futures.&quot;<br />
<br />
Teddy did climb into bed and soon felt his wife&#39;s furry arms wrap around him. They might not be able to be together fully until after he became a were and part of him was fairly certain that the issue with Lionel Ulysses wouldn&#39;t fully end the risks relating to were secrecy and thus it might be time to come out, ready or not, but those concerns were all something that couldn&#39;t be fixed quickly. As Marci then draped her tail over his legs, he let himself drift off to sleep feeling her purr beside him.</p>
