<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vinnie said hello to his folks, and hightailed it to his bedroom where he locked the door. He pulled the <br />
curtains shut and stripped down to his jockstrap. He whispered, &quot;Hey, Ryan, how ya hanging?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tight was Ryan's reply, and he seemed to squeeze Vinnie's junk a bit tighter when he thought it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa! Easy boy, I can't wear you forever. I cannot figure out why this keeps happening to me,&quot; Vinnie said in <br />
an exasperated tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keeps happening to you?&quot; thought Ryan in a confused tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I kinda forget until it happens again,&quot; Vinnie said.  He walked over to his nightstand and opened the <br />
bottom drawer.  He pulled out a Speedo, a pair of board shorts, a pair of Superman briefs,a wrestling singlet, <br />
a stripper thong with a police badge on it, and snakeskin pattern boxers. &quot;Guys, meet Ryan.  Ryan meet the <br />
guys,&quot; he said gesturing first at the pouch girding his loins and then at the garments on his bed.<br />
<br />
He held up the Speedo first taut between his index fingers. Then he gave the fabric some slack, the wrinkles <br />
seemed to form a face on the pouch. It looked vaguely familiar to Ryan. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is Kris King, your former buddy, and Captain of the Water Polo team,&quot; Vin confessed, &quot;He said I was <br />
staring at him in the shower room at the Y last Summer, and I wore him in the pool a couple of times, and then <br />
put him in this drawer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How is that possible?&quot; Ryan asked, &quot;How could I forget Kris like this?  He was best friend, Horst and Carter <br />
were just hangers on, I remember now.  Why didn't I before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Same reason you probably don't remember Steve Fargis from the wrestling team,&quot; Vinnie said waving the singlet <br />
in front of his crotch.  For a moment Ryan could make out a face, but then it vanished as the singlet <br />
collapsed on the bed. Vinnie picked up the Stripper thong with the velcro sides and the police badge pinned to <br />
the pouch, &quot;Or Officer Mike McCaan,&quot; he dropped the thong picking up the board shorts, &quot;Or the surfer dude <br />
Kevin from shop class,&quot; a face appeared as it fell to the bed, and Vin picked up the Superman briefs, &quot;Or <br />
Timmy McGrew from second grade, I had an accident in the boys room, he was there, and I had dry underwear,&quot; he <br />
tossed those on the bed and reached for the snakeskin briefs, &quot;You remember &quot;Snake&quot; Jason Tyler?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait I saw &quot;Snake&quot; today at school,&quot; protested Ryan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah,&quot; laughed Vinnie as he threw himself on the bed.  As his body made contact with the other garments, Ryan <br />
could hear other voices. It was true, he thought.<br />
<br />
Vinnie continued, &quot;What you saw was a simulacrum.  Just like what I left in your bed.  It looks like the <br />
person, but it isn't real.  They can't maintain relationships and easily slip from memory.  That's how you <br />
managed to forget your best friend.  He still goes to our school, but he's practically invisible.  He's no <br />
longer captain of the Water Polo team, and barely plays.   I had planned to leave you on the one in your bed, <br />
but after seeing your pa, I suspect he'll beat that soulless simulacrum to death, if your simulacrum doesn't <br />
kill your pa.  You don't need to be there for that.  Anyway graduation will set all the simulacrums free.  <br />
They'll become nondescript background players in life: deliverymen, clerks, whatever.  Their families will <br />
lose touch and forget them, and maybe they'll just fade away from existence altogether? I don't know.&quot; <br />
<br />
He sighed and held up the amulet, &quot;And this thing, Grandmama said would suppress my power so I couldn't do <br />
this to you. Guess, saying it didn't work is an understatement.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan struggled with the knowledge Vinnie shared.  He saw it all now. He could hear their voices clearly, Timmy <br />
was probably the one crying.  Snake was shouting about what he'd do to Vinnie when he changed back.  Steve <br />
said sadly and apologetically, &quot;Sorry, Ry, he got ya too.&quot; Kevin was a bit more philosophical, &quot;Hey, man, it's <br />
easy. No hunger, no worries, just lie back until he wears you. Summer is just around the corner, I expect <br />
he'll wear me then. Maybe he'll wear you under me, Ryan?&quot; Officer McCaan was the small voice that kept <br />
repeating, &quot;This is all just a nightmare. It's just a dream. It can't be real.&quot;  Steve Fargis didn't say <br />
anything, but Ryan could sense his silent rage.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't get it. Why don't you just change us back? You obviously can control your powers, Vinnie. You made <br />
the simul-things didn't ya?&quot; Ryan posited. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but making a shadow being is just child's play compared to reversing a transformation like these. First <br />
off there's the problem of the conservation of mass. You probably weigh a couple ounces, if I change you back <br />
you'd still weigh a couple of ounces, so your height would be measured in inches instead of feet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait what about the mass I had before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Converted to magical energy and used to power the transformation, I'd need twice as much to reverse the <br />
spell, and that would require someone else be transformed to power it. A no win proposition I assure you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So why do I remember Snake, but didn't remember my best friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Time. I transformed Kris last August, and Snake got transformed yesterday.  He was making me pole dance for <br />
his amusement, when this police officer comes in.  McCaan is a real officer, but he's also Snake's cousin and <br />
buddy. Neither admits to being gay, but they wanted me to strip out at that Club on Hwy 14 for Gay Pride <br />
Weekend, and made me audition for them. So I auditioned, McCann as the breakaway thong, and Snake as the <br />
boxers I peeled off to reveal the thong underneath.  I danced the whole routine alone in front of a mirror.&quot;<br />
<br />
Snake shouted, &quot;You're both perverts!  Mike, you and Vinnie were both inside me. I-uh, I-uh...&quot; he mentally <br />
stammered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You liked it,&quot; Vinnie laughed, and instantly they all knew it was true.<br />
<br />
&quot;You made us so we like being worn by you,&quot; gasped Ryan in horror, but strangely happy about his fate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess.  I don't think it was intentional, but it does relief a lot of the guilt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's Timmy's story?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? I told you already.  I made a simulacrum of him too, and sent him home from school.  The teachers didn't <br />
notice, but well.  He ended up on a milk carton.  Don't know if the simulcrum just evaporated or if his <br />
parents didn't really believe it was him and did something to the simulacrum. Maybe exorcised him?&quot; Vinnie <br />
shrugged.<br />
<br />
Timmy stopped sobbing. His silence was eerie until it was replaced by wailing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goodnight, Superboy,&quot; Vinnie said tossing the Superman Briefs into the still open drawer.<br />
<br />
&quot;If only Horst and Carter hadn't seen,&quot; murmured Vinnie absently.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Horst and Carter?  They'll just forget about me like I forgot Kris?&quot; Ryan pleaded afraid that <br />
they'd end up as sweat socks.  <br />
<br />
Making note of Ryan's mental image, Vinnie said, &quot;Nice idea Carter and Horst would make nice socks. But first <br />
I may try to convince them they were hallucinating. Maybe think that they shared some bad weed, and...but that <br />
sock idea is really cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Puh-lease, Vinnie!&quot; Ryan begged. <br />
<br />
Vinnie reached into his top drawer and pulled out a joint and some Viagra. Ryan felt him swelling inside him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Ryan, how's it feel to go from top jock at school to a nerd's cum rag,&quot; laughed Vinnie as he started to <br />
massage his junk through Ryan's face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Vinnie,&quot; Ryan answered as he started to expand and contract his mesh body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, yeah,&quot; Vinnie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But please change Kris back,&quot; Ryan asked.  He began to tighten and relax rhythmically.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bet you can't do it!&quot; Ryan challenged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I can,&quot; Vinnie said puffing on the joint.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bet you can't!&quot; Ryan retorted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you're right I cannot because their simulacrums exist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait you said Timmy's simulacrum doesn't exist anymore.  So why don't you prove you've got the power. Change <br />
Timmy back!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Timmy?  I wonder if he would be a 19 year old stud or still a little 8 year old kid?&quot; coughed Vinnie.  <br />
<br />
Ryan saw the hazy image of Snake giving Vinnie the weed in exchange for his strip show. Vinnie and Mike's <br />
parents owned the Club which had been losing money of late.  So they decided to switch it from a dive bar to a <br />
gay bar. &quot;After all gays got money, they don't have to spend it on families or kids.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Ryan was pretty sure that was Snake's thought, not Mike who was still chanting &quot;There's no place like home, <br />
there's no place like home...&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah, he's definitely not gay thought Ryan mentally rolling his eyes, which apparently created a swirling <br />
sensation on Vinnie's balls as he moaned and relayed that info to Ryan.</p>
