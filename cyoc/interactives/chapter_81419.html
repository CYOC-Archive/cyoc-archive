<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Crystal blinked sure that she had just been someplace else but couldn't remember where that would be. 
Shaking her head she muttered, "You've been right here in your room after your shower. You weren't anyplace 
else." She sighed and looked at her naked body in the mirror. She was seventeen years old with long black 
hair, which was wrapped in a towel at the moment, and blue eyes. When she was dressed she looked like a 
typical girl but now there was no denying that she wasn't a typical girl. She did have female genitals but she 
also had a penis which you just didn't find on a girl. Her parents had told her that she had undergone a few 
tests when she was a baby and the results were that she was definitely a girl with all the parts, just that 
one extra. The doctors had recommended that she have surgery to remove it but her parents had refused to 
consider it believing that one shouldn't mutilate their body when it wasn't medically necessary. Though she 
wished that they didn't hold that belief since it would have saved her a lot of grief and embarrassment if she 
didn't have it. At that thought a memory from three years ago popped into her head.</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>She was in the school showers after physical education which was thankfully her last class of the day. She 
usually walked home to shower after but the water heater had broken this morning so there was no hot water 
right now and wouldn't be for a couple more hours until her parents got home. She hadn't wanted to use the 
school showers but she didn't want to go without one for two or more hours. She could barely tolerate the walk 
home on normal days. As she rinsed shampoo out of her hair there was a flash and a voice she recognized as 
Gloria's said, "I knew you weren't a girl Crystal and I finally have the proof."</p>
<p>Crystal stopped and opened her eyes to see the head cheerleader glaring at her. She was mortified that her 
secret had been discovered and that there was a picture to prove it. After another flash she amended it to 
there being two pictures now. She looked at the other girls with Gloria. There were five other girls and four 
of them were on the cheerleading team also. The fifth one, who had the camera, was on the school newspaper. 
"This will make a very interesting story," Nancy said as she turned around. "I can see the headline now. 'Boy 
Pretending to be a Girl Discovered in Showers'. It will be the talk of the school."</p>
<p>Crystal found her voice and said, "I am a girl," though she didn't think that would work. She had the 
unfortunate luck to be a girl born into a boy body and she hadn't started puberty yet so she wasn't on any 
hormone therapy.</p>
<p>"Girl's don't have flat chests and penises," Gloria said with a sneer. "Grab him." At these words the four 
remaining girls came into the shower and grabbed Crystal hauling her over to Gloria.</p>
<p>"Gloria I swear I'm a girl," Crystal said near tears.</p>
<p>"No more lies Chris," Gloria said with an angry look on her face. Then she smiled as she said, "Hold him 
down." The other girls did as she said.</p>
<p>Once Crystal was on the ground Gloria grabbed her penis and started to stroke it. "Please don't do this 
Gloria," Crystal pleaded tears streaming down her cheek.</p>
<p>"Oh I don't think so Chris," Gloria said with a smile. "You're already hard and I want to have sex. You 
just happen to be the lucky boy that will take my virginity." With that she slid off her panties and 
positioning herself over Crystal she began to slowly slide down her penis. After just a little bit she stopped 
and went up a little bit then came back down shuddering and groaning as she did. After a couple seconds she 
began to slid up and down not caring about Crystals pleas for her to stop or that she was crying. It lasted 
for several minutes until Gloria shuddered and let out a loud moan. After she had stopped she said, "That was 
good. I can't wait till a boy willingly has sex with me." With that she stood up, put her panties back on, and 
she and the other girls left.</p>
<p>Crystal laid there for a few minutes feeling dirty. She had been raped and she knew no one would believe 
her. She still had a boys body and everyone said a boy couldn't be raped. She wanted to get up and go back in 
the shower to try and feel clean again. However she knew that she wouldn't feel quite clean again so instead 
she hurriedly put on her clothes and ran home. Once there she went up to her room and began crying. Soon 
everyone at school will know that she had a boys body and they would treat her as such. Of course she also 
knew that there were those who would really treat her badly just because of what she knew to be the truth. 
Thinking about all the teasing and other stuff that was sure to come she came to the conclusion that she would 
be better off dead. So getting up she wrote a tear stained note explaining what had happened and then 
fashioned a noose from her bed sheets. She hung it from the ceiling fan in her room and made sure that it was 
nice and tight and could support her weight. When she was satisfied she made a loop on the other end where she 
would place her neck. Thinking a little bit she decided that she needed to have her hands tied before she 
kicked the chair out or else she may try to pull herself up. She knew her parents had a pair of handcuffs for 
some of their kinky sex so she borrowed them. Back in her room she stood on the chair and put her head through 
the noose she had made. She fastened the handcuffs to her right wrist then put both of her hands behind her 
back and taking a deep breath she fastened the handcuffs to her left wrist. Now she couldn't reach up and pull 
her head out by herself. If she backed out now she would have to stand on the chair and wait for someone to 
get home. She was scared now but she was still determined to end her life. Taking another deep breath to 
bolster herself she lifted up a leg and with the other one kicked the chair away. She was hoping that her 
death would be quick and painless but that wasn't the case. She hung there kicking as her airway was 
compressed cutting off her air supply. She had wanted to die but her body wanted to live and was trying to 
find a foothold somewhere it could relieve the pressure on her throat. She didn't know how long she hung there 
only that she was in pain from the bed sheet digging into her throat and her body's attempt to survive. Her 
kicking slowed down and eventually stopped as she began to lose consciousness thankful that she wasn't feeling 
the pain anymore.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Crystal shook her head and asked, "Where the hell did that come from?" She looked at her penis again and 
said, "I've had this all my life but I've also been a girl all my life with all the necessary plumbing. I get 
periods which wouldn't happen if I was born a boy. I was never a boy named Chris who beleived he was a girl 
and wanted to be one. Maybe I should see a psychic or something. Maybe they can help me understand where that 
came from. I don't have anything else planned for today so I might as well." With that thought in her mind she 
began to dress for the day.</p></p>
