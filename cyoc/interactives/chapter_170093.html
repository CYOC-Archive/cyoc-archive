<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the midst of her confused pacing, the phone in her hand dinged, the screen lighting up with a notification about another email from the same source as the last two. Her thumb flicked straight to tap on the notification and open the email app before she could even think about it, as if moving on reflex - by the time she actively realized what was happening, the email was being opened. She couldn&#39;t avert her eyes in time, the sudden shaprness of the buzzing sound causing her to focus intently on the video as it began to play.<br />
<br />
That same beautiful woman she&#39;d seen before was at the forefront, naturally. This time, rather than lingerie or a bikini, she was clad in a low-cut dress, an elegant black number that matched her made-up fair and hair. She was sitting at a table in some sort of fancy... resturant, maybe? It was hard to make out details outside her gorgeous face, or the amazing endowments and long, lithe legs shown off from this angle. She started out in the middle of sipping some drink, only to turn her attention straight into the camera... straight into Yui&#39;s gaze, it felt like.<br />
<br />
Her mouth moved as she set the drink down, the words still so difficult to make out. Something about joining, she thought she heard at one point... and at another, Yui could&#39;ve sworn the woman was mouthing her own name. That couldn&#39;t be possible, could it? This... this was just a spam video thing, they couldn&#39;t actually have had this woman saying her name when this was filmed. Right? No, no... well... but it seemed like she was....<br />
<br />
Yui let out a little gasp as the camera angle shifted, showing a view directly across the table from the woman. Even on the small phone screen, she could see so much passion, so much desire raging in this elegant lady&#39;s bright blue eyes. Slowly she began to crawl up the table, the view of her cleavage offered by this causing Yui to whimper for a moment. She had fallen back onto her bed by the time the woman had fully climbed up, kneeling before the camera, hands slowly working to pull down at her dress. She moved so agonizing slowly in removing the garment, but when she was done...<br />
<br />
Oh good heavens. A chill like she&#39;d never felt before shot up Yui&#39;s spine on seeing the full glory of this woman&#39;s bared chest. She had to grab part of her bedsheet and stuff it in her mouth to keep from biting her own tongue - it was maddening to see more and more of her goddess-like form exposed. Soon the dress was pulled down entirely, revealing a scintillating glimpse of what lay between the woman&#39;s thighs - and that was all Yui could take. Her eyes rolled back before shutting tight, a moan fleeing her mouth as she blacked out, lost in excitement like she&#39;d never once conceived of. Warmth flooded her body, rushing to every sensitive region - before her awareness faded, she felt like she was being filled up, her very body being swelled with something wonderful.<br />
<br />
When she eventually came to, the early morning sun was shining on her face, peeking in through the gaps in the window shades. The dazed young woman groaned as she rolled over, grasping at her phone to check the time and finding that the battery was dead - terrific. The video she had been watching before passing out wasn&#39;t immediately on her mind as she dragged herself to her feet, hand lazily reaching out to get some support from the shelf holding all her softball trophies. At least with that she could-<br />
<br />
Wait.<br />
<br />
She blinked rapidly. Softball? That... no, that wasn&#39;t right... she&#39;d played soccer in elementary and high school, not softball. Glancing over, she found that her first soccer ball, the one that she&#39;d kept for years as a memento, was replaced by a softball. The first one she&#39;d played with, in fact. No, wait, she hadn&#39;t... well... she could remember playing softball... she remembered some of the team photos, in fact. But... why was she so sure that another sport had been her thing? Why was she so certain that only her legs should have been as toned as they were from years of running - something about her leanly muscled arms, built to be powerful by her amatuer batting career, seemed so incredibly off.<br />
<br />
It was while looking at arms that she noticed it was hard, nay, impossible to see her toes. Not because of any fat on her stomach, but because of the large, bouncing orbs upon her chest. She gasped in shock - this definitely couldn&#39;t be right. In a flurry she ripped off her shirt to find two firm, almost gravity-defying globes, perfectly natural in shape and far larger than she remembered them being. Good lord, they had to have swelled to at least double-d&#39;s, maybe more, much larger than the C-cup she&#39;d always worn. In confusion she grabbed a bra and held it up to her chest... and it seemed to fit perfectly. How... what... how could that be possible?!<br />
<br />
Her hips swayed slightly as she rushed to put a shirt back on, heading out the door with her head held in her hand. It seemed like her head was heavier as she bumbled down the hallway, weighed down with the hair that came to her chest... hang on, no, she&#39;d always kept it short. Hadn&#39;t she? The pictures had showed her wearing it long... why did she remember it being cut down further? Panic was truly starting to set in now, and that much seemed to be evident on her face as she wandered into the living room and found Joey in front of the TV. As soon as the pink-haired woman had turned to look at her, she shut off the television, a worried look in her eyes. &quot;Yui? What&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
She swallowed audibly as she sat down next to her roommate. &quot;I... I don&#39;t... I don&#39;t know.&quot; She ran a hand back through her hair, looking up at the reflect in the TV&#39;s blank screen - it was difficult to pick out, but she could have sworn the very shape of her face had changed slightly. Eyes growing a bit larger, lips plumping a tiny bit, their natural shade becoming redder. &quot;I-I feel like.... I feel like I don&#39;t recognize myself anymore... and... and I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening...&quot;<br />
<br />
Instantly the other woman had an arm around her, patting her gently on the back in a show of support. &quot;Hey, hey, it&#39;s okay, I get it.&quot; She let out a long sigh. &quot;It&#39;s... it&#39;s my fault, for saying what I said yesterday. I&#39;m sorry. I-I shouldn&#39;t have said any of that crap.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-you didn&#39;t...&quot; She shook her head slightly. &quot;It&#39;s okay... you were just... just joking...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well they were shitty jokes. Making fun of somebody for being bisexual, that&#39;s.... that&#39;s just shitty. Just as bad as all the people who mocked me when I came out. God, I feel gross...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...w-what?&quot; Had she just... but Yui wasn&#39;t.... she tried to focus, and found herself remembering crushes. Feelings towards other girls. A scant few dates, kept secret from her parents. Admitting how she felt to Joey, and feeling so liberated by getting to be honest about herself. She... she liked girls? She could have sworn that she didn&#39;t feel that way before... but she remembered those feelings, the recollections now becoming clear as day. How could she be so confused about this?<br />
<br />
The video. It popped back into her mind - she hadn&#39;t felt so utterly baffled and lost before she&#39;d watched it. Or... had she? Did she actually feel confused since she&#39;d watched those videos? Part of her wondered if she&#39;d been truly confused before, when whe hadn&#39;t seen them, hadn&#39;t laid eyes on this gorgeous woman. She.... she had felt only nice things when watching them, after all. Staring into that beauty&#39;s eyes, she hadn&#39;t once been scared or disturbed. Just... comforted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I need to be alone...&quot; She muttered, quickly rising up and marching back off to her room. No, that was a lie. She didn&#39;t need to be alone. As soon as she&#39;d closed and locked the door to her bedroom, she was rushing to the laptop and checking her email. She didn&#39;t want to be alone at all - she wanted to watch that gorgeous woman again. Things seemed to feel right, things seemed to make sense, when she was watching these images play out... and right now, she desperately needed things to make sense.</p>
