<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Robert ‘Spud’ Spudowski was no more.  The werebear he’d become moments ago had completely replaced the man and all the werebear wanted was to mate.  Brutally he pushed his engorged cock into Adam’s tortured ass and, to Adam’s relief, there was lubrication at last.  What slicked the inside of Adam’s ass was blood from the rough fuck he himself had asked for and the werebear’s pre-come.  <br />
<br />
The werebear didn’t care, his seed would mix with Adam’s blood and his sperm would swim through Adam’s blood, burrowing into his cells and combining its DNA with Adam’s and replicating the new DNA in new cells.  The more sperm and the more times the mated pair fucked, the faster Adam would become like Spud.  But the werebear didn’t care about the biology; the werebear just wanted to mate.<br />
<br />
Had Spud been told to hold off, to not fuck Adam raw, he would have maintained some mental control, but Adam had wanted the Big Bad Bear and so Spud had opened the cage and removed the muzzle and mittens he kept on the beast within himself.<br />
<br />
Adam was screaming in pain, but the werebear didn’t heed the cries of his mate, in fact, the smell produced by fear and pain only made the werebear’s fuck more bestial.  Over and over the giant cock slammed into Adam.  Adam’s own cock pulsed out gobs of come as he achieved his first orgasm, the bear continued to pound Adam’s ass.  The bear’s claws dug into Adam’s back and again the screams of pain, muffled by the gag, inflamed the werebear’s passion.  The bear bent his head down and licked the blood and sweat from Adam’s wounds.  The bear’s nimble tongue licked in the holes the claws had made and as if by magic, the saliva healed the wounds as if the skin had never been broken; and still the bear fucked, grunting and growling with pure animalistic pleasure.  Inside, of Adam, the bear’s cock expanded even more, the bulge in the werebear’s cock grew and massaged Adam’s prostate gland.  Adam was now at the point where pain had transformed into pleasure.  All the pain in his body had overloaded the pain center in his brain and the activity spread to the neighboring pleasure center; but Adam didn’t care about the biology; Adam just wanted to mate.<br />
<br />
Adam was euphoric, a stream of pre-come flowed from his cock, into the condom and mixed with the sperm from his first orgasm.  Adam was about to experience another orgasm without even being touched.<br />
<br />
The savage werebear was getting close, his needs would be fulfilled.  He reached down again with is muzzle and bit into Adam’s shoulder.<br />
<br />
The searing pain was all Adam needed, he screamed himself hoarse and his balls and prostate pumped out so much come that the condom leaked up around the base of Adam’s cock.<br />
<br />
The bear, grunting, growling with a muzzle full of Adam’s shoulder drew near the edge of his orgasm.  He suddenly released his hold on Adam’s sholder and a roar that shook the room escaped from the huge furry barreled chest.<br />
<br />
The werebear went momentarily blind as a billion stars exploded before his eyes.  His cock pumped enormous gobs of thick, hot, creamy white werebear sperm into Adam.  Adam felt his bowels filled with the bear’s gift.  He moaned and went into orgasm a third time, the human sperm over filling the condom and it formed a puddle on the black leather that dripped down and fell to the black carpet.  For what seemed like hours, the bear spewed hot seed into the vessel that would become his mate, his cub, his lover… his equal; but the werebear didn’t think about that, he just released his sperm in wave after wave of orgasmic bliss.<br />
<br />
After three minutes, the bear’s cock stopped pulsing and Spud’s mind began to return to the great, half-form werebear.  Slowly, the human mind regained control of the werebear body.  Beneath him, a badly bruised, chubby, hairy-backed human whimpered in pain.  The werebear pulled his bloody cock out of his mate and when he did, a pinkish blood and semen mix oozed out of Adam’s ass.  The bear bent his head down, and began to eat out the tortured ass.  Adam passed out, the pleasure was just too intense after his ordeal.  The Bear’s tongue filled the hole and his copious saliva healed the tears in the walls of his lover’s intestine.  When he had cleaned out the hole, he licked up the mixture of bloody semen and human sperm that had pooled on the black leather.  The bear moved up Adam’s ass and licked his wounds and again, the wounds from the bite healed.  Spud removed the ball gag and tossed it into the sling.  He then unbuckled the restraints.  Adam was still out.  Spud flipped his new cub over on his back and began to lick his face.  He licked off the salty sweat and tears and probed his opened mouth.  Soon, Adam returned to consciousness.<br />
<br />
Spud removed the condom and sucked and licked Adam’s cock clean.  Adam just lay in his own sweat and moaned hoarsely.  Spud finished his ministrations and his hulking, furry body loomed over Adam.<br />
<br />
His paw offered Adam’s mouth the opening of the condom.<br />
<br />
“Eat the last of your human seed, tonight, a werebear has been conceived.  You will consume the last of that human’s sperm.  The human that helped create the bear you are becoming.”  Spud commanded.<br />
<br />
Adam opened his mouth and the bear began squeezing the sperm into his mouth like one of those icy pops that come in the plastic containers you squeeze from bottom to top to get all the juice out.<br />
<br />
Adam swallowed it all, consumed his last completely human sperm.<br />
<br />
Spud smiled a toothy smile and tossed the used condom in the trash receptacle by the toy shelf.  “Tonight, you are my cub.” Spud said and lifted the limp, tortured body of his lover from the horse.<br />
<br />
Adam didn’t even bother to wrap his arms around his furry papa.<br />
<br />
“You have pleased me this night beyond any pleasure, my cub, my love.”  The deep rumble of the bear’s voice soothed Adam.  <br />
<br />
“Please, Papa, have mercy on your bad cub…” Adam looked like he was going to say more and then he passed out again to the smiling muzzled face and loving eyes of his Papa.<br />
<br />
Adam was his now, completely his.  It would be painful to give him up, but eventually, Adam would grow and become his own bear.  He would become, over the years, not Spud’s property, but his equal and that was when he truly would be his mate.  A match for him in every way… but that was years from now.  Adam would be Spud’s to train, punish and care for, for now.  The thought of his awesome responsibility both frightened the big werebear and excited him into erection.  <br />
<br />
He would love to fuck Adam again tonight, but that would not help his fragile partner to heal.  No, for the rest of tonight he would simply run a hot shallow bath and bathe his love gently.  Massage his battered body and let the heat of the water soothe away pain.  He would put Adam in his huge soft bed and then he would change back into his human form after he had tucked Adam in.  He would shower and cuddle up to Adam and sleep contentedly; holding his cub close to his furry body.<br />
<br />
In the morning, Adam awoke, his face buried in the fur on Spud’s chest.  Adam hurt all over, but the bruises had amazingly faded.  He didn’t want to move, but he was so horny.  His cock was stiff, slick and nuzzled up to Spud’s cock, which was also stiff.  The thickly bearded face emitted grunts in his sleep.  The strong arms, wrapped around Adam, squeezed him to his furry body.  Adam let out a sharp yelp as pain burst from his back.  Spud woke immediately.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, my love,” he said and relaxed his grip on Adam, “I was dreamin’ that you had changed into a werebear and we were fuckin’.” Spud grinned.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Adam said, and it sounded like he had laryngitis, “I can tell.”<br />
<br />
Adam painfully wiggled his hips, smearing his cock in the pre-come he and Spud had leaked in their sleep.<br />
<br />
“Well, I don’t think I should fuck you, but I can suck you off.”  Spud said and immediately went to it.<br />
<br />
Adam was in so much pain, but he was so horny too.  He was equally torn between just going back to sleep to escape the pain and enjoying the intense pleasure Spud’s oral ministrations was giving him.  It didn’t take long for him to decide that he wanted to shoot his load into Spud’s bearded face more than he wanted to just pass out.<br />
<br />
Within minutes, Adam shot his load.  Spud got up, went to a comfortable chair in the bedroom and jacked off.  Adam was asleep again.<br />
<br />
Spud showered and after went downstairs to fix breakfast for the two of them.  Today, he was Adam’s butler, personal masseuse, maid, physical therapist, nurse, cook, sex toy and gentle Papa Teddy Bear.  Whatever Adam wanted today and for the next three days while his body recovered was what Adam got.  Adam would want his stern and sadistic Papa to return, but that would be in the playroom, after he healed.  <br />
<br />
Spud was more content than he had been sense he and Adam had gone their separate ways after high school.  Spud’s path after high school had lead him to Oregon, Washington and British Columbia.  He’d hired on at a timber company and in the beautiful wilds of British Columbia, he had met his own Papa and he had changed Spud into the mythically powerful beast that had taken Adam as his own Cub, last night.<br />
<br />
Spud rustled up some grub; good bear food like he and the truckers and bikers ordered in the roadside diners.  Sausages, eggs, bacon, pancakes, biscuits and gravy, hash browns and toast and jelly.  He added milk, juice and coffee to the tray.  Today, Adam would eat like a bear eats!  Today, Adam was his growin’ cub and needed to fuel the changes that were to come.<br />
<br />
He carried it all into the bedroom and woke Adam with a kiss.<br />
“It’s ten o’clock, son, time you woke up and ate something.  Ya can’t sleep all day, even if you were run over by a Mack truck and fucked senseless last night.” Spud said gruffly.<br />
<br />
Adam winced as he sat up in bed.  He was hungry… no, famished.<br />
<br />
He and Spud tore into the feast before them… today was the best day in Adam’s life, he thought.<br />
<br />
Outside of Spud’s house, across the street, a burly white bearded man sat in his dark green pickup.  He puffed on a cigar, read the newspaper and thought as he watched the house.<br />
<br />
He’d tracked Spud here and eventually, the big man would have to leave the house…</p>
