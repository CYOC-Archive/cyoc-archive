<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kellie and Katie picked up their tops and went into their changing rooms. Katie turned around to glanced at her new bikini, but more importantly, her current body. Heading to the mirror, she took a good look at herself. She could see the girl that was once seven and could tell that a lot has changed for her new ten year old body. She was long and gangly as her arms and legs were completely skinny and her face was matured quite a bit. Her hair was a little longer then before and it was down her lower neck. Katie was pleased that that she still have her childish looks with her growing body. But then, as she was thinking of Kellie being her sister, A sudden thought hit her Ever since she was young, she always wanted a twin sister. That way they can share each of their aspects and always stick together. But sadly it was just a little dream she had and knew it would never happen. But that she has the ring on her finger, and her mother looking younger, she has the opportunity in creating the twin she needed. But in order to become the twin sister, she must sacrifice her entire childhood to become a full-blown adult. So taking this risk, she closed her eyes and silently made her wish.<br />
<br />
As the warmth began in her body, Katie felt her swimsuit shifting and becoming smaller on a steadily growing body. Her arms and legs came first, growing out, long and gangly like the legs of a colt. Her fingers and toes became thinner, more distinct and dainty as the nails themselves became painted pink polish. She giggled and swung her legs and watched with fascination as her toes drifted further and further to the floor of the carpet, until the balls of her feet touched...then the flats, then the heels, She sighed in elation and realization that she was growing up, finally able to touch her feet to the floor of most places at last, though a part of her somehow wished she could swing her legs at times.<br />
<br />
The coltish appearance stopped there though as she experienced something strange. Her hips began to push out, just a little bit at a time, gaining a slight curve, at the same time her legs and arms gained a distinct tone to them as if she&#39;d spent every day running, playing and moving. Her stomach gurgled as it also flattened and toned nicely, and she could watch the change as it spread along her bare belly and along her belly button, leaving her abdomen neatly pretty like she&#39;d seen girls who entered surfing competitions.  <br />
<br />
By now her bathing bottom had stretched beyond its limit and she felt a new strange tingling beneath it, she felt a warmth as within her insides her body began to approach the age of adolescence. She could not see the changes, but she distinctly felt them, letting out a little gasp as new thoughts and understands began to grow in her young preteen mind. <br />
<br />
At the same time her flat tanktop would begin to swell with the growth of two small mounds beneath it, the same warmth below filling them as she began to develop...her eyes widening now as she understood what was happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Im....entering puberty...&quot; <br />
<br />
The thought excited and terrified her and the changes werent done. She could see her face in the rearview mirror as the cute, childlike features began to define. Her button nose was still that, but it was starting to even out. The freckles on her face were less prevalent and her teeth rearranged as some adult ones grew in. She gained a certain maturity, a certain beginning of beauty as her hair began to flow long to her back and around her newly pierced ears. A prick and pain and looking down she found herself in possession of a third new one in her belly button, as if it has always been there.<br />
<br />
She stepped out of the changing room to find Kellie stretching her arms and legs. A few minutes later a shadow covered her.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; Kellie thought. She opened her eyes to see her 14-year-old sister Katie standing over her in a new bikini.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think Kel?&quot; asked Katie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me get a better look,&quot; Kellie said standing up. &quot;Wow, You&#39;re really catching up, girl!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie was still her full-grown height of 5&#39;5&quot; ... Katie was now 5&#39;4&#39;&#39; as her body kept on toning. The small mounds on her chest started to grow as they look like pointy cones. Katie saw them sticking out and could feel her hormones ramping up as the nipples started to look erect. Her hips started to flare up a bit and were gaining a bit of curves around her waist.  Looking to her review mirror, she could see her face maturing as she was entering her teens. Her head was looking shaping from a round to oval, her nose grew bigger and thinner, the freckles continue to fade bit by bit, and her eyes were getting smaller and more mature. She flinged a few blonde strands back as her hair slowly grew down her neck. The thirteen-year-old was enjoying this as she was starting to grow out into her teen years.<br />
<br />
Turning to Kellie, Katie didn’t notice any change yet from her once mother, now sister. So far, she could tell that her face was a bit fresher and her skin looked a little tan. But other then that, no other changes present. The 24-year-old Kellie looked to her little sister for a bit and asked, “What are you starring at shrimp?” Katie turned back and said in a polite tone, “Nothing… I’m just happy that you can take me to the beach today.” Kellie nodded and gave a deep sigh. “Thanks sis, it’s the least I can do.&quot;</p>
