I had been looking for an opportunity to test the update. I was glad that the first one would be someone besides one of my children. The only question that I had was what to turn Dennis into. On thing was clear to me, he wouldn't be a boy much longer. Dennis had said that he wanted to be with Dianne and I started to wonder if the program could make him a part of her body. I decided against that as I thought that he could take her over at times.<br />
<br />
I was still trying to decide what to turn Dennis into as I booted up my laptop and put in my password. Once it was up and running I went into the living room where Dennis was arguing with his mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're being unfair!&quot; Dennis said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what's unfair about being punished for what you did!?!&quot; Denise asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad wouldn't punish me for it!&quot; Dennis said.<br />
<br />
&quot;He never punishes you for anything!&quot; Denise said. &quot;I'm sick of it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad had told you not to punish me!&quot; Dennis said. &quot;You never listen to him! That's why he left you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your father left because he didn't want to be a father!&quot; Denise said. &quot;I had to go to court to get him to take a DNA test to prove that he's your father! Even after that he resisted taking you when he was suppose to!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why can't you let me do what I want!?!&quot; Dennis asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I'm trying to teach you to be a good person!&quot; Denise said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that I was never born!&quot; Dennis said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I can grant your wish Dennis&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going to do Mommy?&quot; Dianne asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not quite sure yet&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Denise asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have this program that can alter reality&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's no way that reality can be altered&quot; Denise said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's twue&quot; Dianne said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead and tell them&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were older and boys before Mommy changed us&quot; Tiffany said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah right&quot; Dennis said. &quot;I'd like to see reality change.&quot;<br />
<br />
By this time the rest of my children had come into the living room. I should have known that they would come down eventually.<br />
<br />
&quot;We want to go swimming Mommy&quot; Maxine said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me finish up what I'm doing then we'll go to the beach&quot; I said. &quot;Why don't you go get ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Maxine said as she headed back up to her and Amy's room. Amy, Kathy, and Fred followed her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't have a swimsuit Mommy&quot; Dianne said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will in a moment&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
I had decided to turn Dennis into Dianne's new swimsuit. I made sure that both Denise and Dennis' aware was checked. I clicked on Dennis' sim and selected the inanimate option that came up. Next was the clothes option. When I clicked on that it asked me to select who the clothes would fit and it gave me a list. The list had everyone in the house plus one to enter a name. I clicked on Dianne's name and another list came up. I clicked on swimsuit and yet another list came up. I was starting to wonder how many lists I'd have to go<br />
through. The update definitely had more options than before. I clicked on racerback on this list and yet another one popped up. This one was brands and I just clicked one. Another list popped up when I did. This one had colors on it and I knew that Dianne liked pink so that was the color I picked. I was finally done with the lists and Dennis' transformation could begin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have fun with your new life Dennis&quot; I said with a grin on my face as Dennis started to transform.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Dennis:<br />
<br />
I was still mad at my mother. I didn't do anything wrong yet she acts like I did. What was so wrong about taking a swimsuit that belonged to the girl I want to be with? What's so wrong about jerking off while thinking about her? I couldn't see anything wrong with it. So why was my mother making such a big deal out of it?<br />
<br />
Mrs. Anderson had finished doing whatever she had been doing on her laptop. She looked at me and said with a grin &quot;Have fun with your new life Dennis.&quot;<br />
<br />
I didn't understand why she said that. She must be crazy. Suddenly I couldn't feel my cock anymore. My skin felt strange where my cock was but also my ass, stomach, chest, shoulders, and back felt strange. I was just beginning to wonder if I could excuse myself to check on my cock when my clothes disappeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;AHHHHH!&quot; I cried when my clothes disappeared. I moved my hands to cover my cock. When I did I felt a smooth fabric like a girls swimsuit. I looked down and saw that I was wearing a girls swimsuit.<br />
<br />
&quot;AHHHHH!&quot; I cried again as I tried to grab the shoulder straps and get the swimsuit off. No matter how hard I tried though the shoulder straps would not move. I was so freaked that I didn't notice that I wasn't feeling the fabric of the swimsuit against my skin. I didn't notice that I was feeling a slight breeze where the swimsuit was like the swimsuit was my skin. I didn't notice that I was shrinking. By the time that I did notice these things I was the same height as<br />
Dianne.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's happening to him!?!&quot; my mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's being twansformed&quot; Dianne said.<br />
<br />
I was thinking that my gender would be changed now that I was Dianne's size. I didn't want to be a girl. Something was wrong though. Instead of my gender changing I kept shrinking. I looked at my legs and arms and noticed that they were shrinking while the rest of my body stayed the same. It was soon after this that I noticed I could no longer move my head as my neck had also shrunk down to<br />
nothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did yo...&quot; I started to ask but I was unable to get the rest out as my jaw started to be absorbed into my body. It was then that my arms and legs weren't shrinking but were being absorbed into my body. My mouth was soon absorbed and I started to panic. My nose would be next then I wouldn't be able to breathe. Sure enough my nose was absorbed and I couldn't breathe. I had taken a deep breath before that happened. My head continued to be absorbed into my body. As my eyes were absorbed I lost my sight but just a moment later I was seeing again. Though I seemed to be seeing all around me from the area that the swimsuit covered. I was able to watch as my head, arms, and legs finished being absorbed. Of course I couldn't remain upright and I fell onto my back. I knew now that I was turning into the swimsuit and I knew that my body still needed to hollow out.<br />
As my body hallowed out I flattened out. Finally the change was complete in one minute and I was waiting for the moment when I would just blank out. That moment never came.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Anderson picked me up and handed me to Dianne asking &quot;Do you like it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you turn him back?&quot; Dianne asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe later&quot; Mrs. Anderson said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But he didn't ask for this&quot; Dianne said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well he did in a way&quot; Mrs. Anderson said. &quot;He had wished that he was never born and you needed a new swimsuit since he ruined your old one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How does changing him into a swimsuit grant his wish?&quot; my mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Reality has been altered&quot; Mrs. Anderson said. &quot;As far as everyone else is concerned you never had a child named Dennis. In fact if I'm right you won't have the stretch marks from being pregnant anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
My mother lifted up the dress she was wearing to check. &quot;My stretch marks are gone!&quot; she said in a surprised voice. &quot;How did that happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said, reality has been changed&quot; Mrs. Anderson said. &quot;The reality now is that you never had Dennis. The reason you remember Dennis now is that I have your aware on. I also have Dennis' aware on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So he knows who he is and what happened?&quot; my mother asked.<br />
<br />
'Well duh' I thought. 'That's what she said.'<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes he does&quot; Mrs. Anderson said. &quot;Now why don't you two girls go get ready for the beach.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mommy&quot; Dianne said. She ran upstairs with me in her hand.<br />
<br />
'Well this may not be too bad' I thought. 'I'll get to see Dianne naked and I'll actually be really close to her. In fact I'll be skin tight against her skin.'<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't believe that you're going to wear him&quot; Tiffany said once we were in their room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; Dianne asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's a boy!&quot; Tiffany said. &quot;I know what boys think about. I was one remember.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wemember&quot; Dianne said. &quot;Wemember that I was a boy once too before Mommy changed me.&quot;<br />
<br />
I would have been sick if I was still human. Dianne used to be a boy. Would she still have a dick?<br />
<br />
&quot;That's wight Dennis&quot; Dianne said. &quot;I was a boy before Mommy changed me. Now you hafta gwin and bear being my swimsuit. It may be for a short time or it may be longer. Mommy will decide. Now to put you on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dianne placed me were I could watch her undress. I didn't want to watch but I couldn't look away or not see. I had no choice but to watch Dianne undress. After she had taken off her panties she turned to face me. I could see that she didn't have a cock for which I was grateful. Maybe she had just said that she had been a boy before to freak me out. She walked toward me and picked me up. She slid me over her smooth legs and it felt like someone pulling on my skin. In<br />
fact that was basically what was happening. Once she had pulled me up I felt her pussy press into my crotch on the inside. Her ass was pressed into mine. Her chest pressed into my chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooooh, Dennis fits me weally well&quot; Dianne said. &quot;Better than my old swimsuit. Maybe Mommy will keep him like this for a long time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dianne had turned to a mirror and was turning around to look at herself in me. I had to admit that she looked really cute. This may not be a bad life if I get to be her swimsuit as she grows older.</p>
