<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>Ty decided he'd left it long enough; now was the time to check on June and Mark. As he climbed the stairs he heard not only the thumping from before, but also loud groans and animalistic grunting. Not being able to wait a minute longer, he ran to the door and burst through. Nothing could have prepared him for what he saw...</P>
<P>The walls separating their bedroom from the other upstairs rooms had collapsed, and there was dust everywhere. But even through the haze a mammoth, no gargantuan figure could be seen. Mark had grown so huge that he had burst through into the other rooms, his body now taking up most of the top floor. His muscles were now phenomenal, each one looking as though it had overflowed from his body, his skin barely able to contain them. His pecs were so huge that they practically touched the ceiling, with a four foot deep crevice between his pecs, and ridges so deep between his ten pack abs that a child could hide in them and never be found. His lats and bi's were so massive that his arms had to be stretched out as far from his sides as possible, without a single molecule of air between the giant's arm and back muscles. His legs were now bigger than any tree trunk and, like his arms, had to be spread apart as wide as possible to accommodate his majorly beefed-up thighs. But something else was also getting in the way of his legs.</P>
<P>Some men brag about having a dick "as thick as a baby's arm" but Mark's cock was now so huge that it was probably bigger than Michael, their neighbor. Even compared to Mark's grossly over-sized physique it was massive. June had probably tried riding it like a bucking bronco, but now it was too huge even for that. She had just resorted to lying in Mark's muscle cleavage, leaving him to satisfy himself by hand.</P>
<P>His balls had also grown considerably - Ty couldn't think of anything big enough to compare it to. And they had clearly been put to good use, with the walls and floor coated in thick cum, not to mention Mark and Judy also. A steady stream of man juice was already flowing out of his member's inflated cock head, but soon enough Mark resumed his grunting and load after load after load of jism fired out of his powerful cannon. It easily knocked through the remaining walls, and Ty also got a few loads shot his way. Finally sated, Mark's cock slowed it propulsion of cum, and softened slightly. However, Ty knew that it wouldn't be long before it started up again.</P>
<P>"Mark and June will no longer be horny," Ty wished to himself, "and Mark will stop growing" - he decided they could use a rest. And true to his words, the couple collapsed into a deep sleep, exhausted from the day's activities. </P>
<P>Ty looked around the room. "Looks like i'll need to do some remodeling!" he joked to himself. Ty realized that Mark couldn't even sit up, and if he'd gotten any bigger he would have broken through the outside walls. "I can deal with that when they wake up" he thought. He made his way to the bathroom (or at least where the sink was standing in the demolition site) to wipe the cum off him, now starting to dry hard. "What a waste", he thought. "All this good cum going down the drain". He began cleaning the crusty jism off his clothes and body.</P>
<P>But he was soon interrupted by screams from downstairs. He rushed down just in time to see Matt staring at Dustin, his mouth agape. Dustin was just standing in the kitchen, legs apart, hands on hips, with a cocky smirk on his face and flexing his boner so that it slapped against his rock hard abs. Ian stayed on the sofa, intently watching Dustin whilst sipping the remains of his drink.</P>
<P>"I guess you wanted these", Dustin said, passing the Handisnacks and KFC to Matt.</P>
<P>"I'd rather that prime piece of meat there", Matt exclaimed, enticed by the new stud and his member.</P>
<P>"That's the main course, you need to eat your appetizers first". Dustin took a chicken thigh and began feeding it to Matt. He had guessed what Ty had wished for, and so didn't want Matt to miss out on such a great gift. Matt greedily stuffed his face with the snacks, oblivious to the changes that his body was undergoing. His just wanted the next course - and desert.</P>
<P>Ian, however, was clearly getting turned on by his friend's changes. His bigger package had now snaked its way out of the waistband of his jeans and up his abs. With his increased height and musculature his t-shirt had been pulled up his torso, the bottom held firmly in place under the shelf of his beefier pecs. The sleeves had also contracted toward his shoulders, because of them being unable to contain his inflated biceps. His tee looked more like a seriously tight, cropped tank top, which left a perfect view of his meatier cock, now rock solid. "Don't s'pose I could have another coke, Ty?", Ian asked.</P>
<P>"Sure", replied Ty. He was more than happy to oblige, tossing him another can.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Dustin was still stuffing Matt with snacks. His jeans looked like the skin on a sausage, they were so crammed with muscle, and his arms had long ago torn free from his shirt sleeves. When his snacking was over, Matt's arms were the size of his waist, and his legs even bigger. His jeans lay in tatters around them, and his gargantuan thighs had pushed his boxers up between the crack in his rock hard butt so they looked more like a thong. The remains of his shirt hung off him like a waistcoat, his chest still relatively unchanged.</P>
<P>"Ready for the next course?", said a beaming Dustin.</P></p>
