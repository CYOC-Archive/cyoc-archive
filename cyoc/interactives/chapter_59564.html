<br />
I decided to take care of a few minor errands in town after lunch. I didn't know if Frank Rhoer would still feed Molly after the interview went so disastrously with Mr. Beauregard, so I drove down to a small sort of supermarket that I had seen while trying find the town's central office for its school district and then its police station. It wasn't as big as many of the stores I'd seen in other places, but then the demand here was usually lower. Though, in regards to meat, eggs, and diary products, that would likely jump with Molly and I prepared to move there.<br />
<br />
I took a cart and went to the back of the store where their meat section was. I then began &quot;stocking up&quot; on what foods Molly had told me she could tolerate. I picked up two packets of beef steaks that were two pounds each, two packets of pork chops that were 1.5 pound each, one packet of lamb that was one pound, two boxes of shrimp that appeared to be under one pound each. I then went to a different isle and picked up three cartons of eggs. I figured that would give Molly a variety to choose from, and I took that to the check-out isle.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're certainly looking for some cardiac problems,&quot; the check-out man quipped when he saw the large pile of meat that I had in my cart.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not all for me,&quot; I gave a nervous chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a barbecue then?&quot; he wondered, &quot;what are you celebrating?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's more of providing some daily ration,&quot; I said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;This will only last you a day?&quot; he gasped, &quot;what's your cholesterol count?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not just me,&quot; I sighed, &quot;My girlfriend as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn,&quot; he spoke, &quot;and how big is she?&quot;<br />
<br />
I got the feeling that this guy was getting the wrong impression from my answers. I sighed and decided to explain Molly's condition.<br />
<br />
&quot;She does weigh more then I do,&quot; I told him, &quot;but it's complicated. Did you ever see a news broadcast on the trial of a man running a freak show that turned a person into a tigress?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vaguely...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My girlfriend IS that tigress,&quot; I told him, &quot;she can't digest anything but meat and diary products. She's told me that anything else makes her sick.&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked at me blankly, &quot;You mean it was real? They turned people it animals?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; I said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;How cool is that?&quot; he wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not very when faces with the actual consequences of the transformation,&quot; I told him.<br />
<br />
He shrugged, &quot;I suppose... what's she like in bed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We haven't done anything beyond cuddling,&quot; I sighed, wondering why some people seemed to gravitate to that subject.<br />
<br />
Paying for the order went quietly and I then took it back to my truck and began to return to Molly's uncle's home.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it's about all a lot of people think about,&quot; Dave commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish people would think of something else,&quot; I sighed, &quot;Molly and my relationship has not been about sexual gratification.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave nodded, &quot;at least the cashier seemed supportive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but if Leona ever comes out here, I'd be nervous that he'd ask her to turn him INTO an animal,&quot; I sighed, &quot;which freaks me out.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
As I drove back to Frank Rhoer's home, my mind began to wander about the things that I would need to do. I had no formal resume, mostly as I'd devoted so much of my time to helping Molly. I knew how to write one, but, I'd been distracted from actually doing so. I could probably type them up anywhere, but my transcripts were a different issue. They had to be mailed, and the only address my college had was my parent's address. And since Molly and I didn't have our own place yet, there was no way we could have them forward it to us. I would need to go &quot;home&quot; to get what I needed for the application to the Columbia Falls Police Department.<br />
<br />
As I arrived back at the small home and began to carry in the groceries I had bought I began to think about another big problem Molly and I had to face. Where we would live. Yes we had found work, but Molly's wouldn't pay much, and mine would be slow to materialize. Frank Rhoer might let us stay for a little while, but he probably couldn't afford to feed Molly for long...<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, George,&quot; Dave interrupted, &quot;you know I helped you get the house you wanted with the twenty square miles... and for much cheaper then you thought.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that know,&quot; I told him, &quot;I didn't know that then.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
I put the food I had bought in the refrigerator and in a deep freezer that was in their garage. It should provide the Rhoers with enough meat to feed Molly for a little while. I then set about what would be my next task in doing what had to be done. I called my dad and preyed he was back from lunch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Captain Wayne, speaking,&quot; my father answered on his end of the line.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, it's me,&quot; I spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;George? It's good to hear from you, how are things with Molly?&quot; my dad asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty good, actually,&quot; I told him, &quot;the school is running a summer day-care program and they hired Molly on the spot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's great for her,&quot; my father replied, &quot;I trust we'll be seeing you again soon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For a little bit,&quot; I told him, &quot;I LOVE Molly, dad... I... I want to spend my life with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't propose, did you?&quot; my father asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven't worked up the courage for THAT yet,&quot; I told him, &quot;we will be moving in together for a little while.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, why are you coming back here?&quot; my father asked, which almost sounded agitated to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I've met with the local chief of police and I seemed to impress him with something,&quot; I told him, &quot;he's offered to help with an application to the police academy out here, if I can provide him with a current resume and my college transcripts, and since Molly and I are still visiting her uncle, I need to come &quot;home&quot; to pick up the transcripts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... I'll see if I can order them from the college,&quot; my father spoke, &quot;they should be here by the time you get here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, dad,&quot; I answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's no problem,&quot; my dad answered, &quot;just promise me one thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Take your time in making me a grandfather.&quot;<br />
<br />
I only sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; I gave a small laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll try to have your mother calmed down, and I'll give Mr. and Mrs. Rhoer a call,&quot; my father answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye, dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye, son, and congratulations,&quot; my father replied.<br />
<br />
After he hung up, I began working to get ready for my departure from Columbia Falls for a little while. My next test, would be explaining this to Molly.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Molly was the first to return at about four forty. She was smiling and looked very cheerful.<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it you had a good day?&quot; I asked as she came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it ended up being an introduction session for me, today,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;met the staff running the school Mrs. Fitzpatrick teaches at and the students they're looking after during the summer. I'm afraid I'm to be known as the &quot;tiger lady&quot; by all the kids.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds cute,&quot; I told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess,&quot; Molly gave a low sigh, &quot;but it beats the way most adults have treated me.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that IS good to hear,&quot; I smiled.<br />
<br />
Molly smiled, &quot;so, what have you been up to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After lunch, I bought some meat and eggs for you,&quot; I told her, &quot;so we're not imposing on your Uncle too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I've done some prep-work for my own application,&quot; I finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;With the police? What do you have to do?&quot; Molly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've got to go back home, Molly,&quot; I told her, &quot;our college won't send my transcripts to your Uncle, and find a place of our own will take time. I've got to go back and get it before coming back here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Molly gave a slow nod, &quot;you'll be safe right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I will,&quot; I replied as I hugged her. She hugged me back, trying to be as gentle as she could, though I could still easily tell how strong she was.<br />
<br />
It left a portion of my mind wondering if there was a way for me to become a better &quot;mate&quot; for her, so she wouldn't have to hold back. But that was a small and shallow part of mind. It was silenced when reminded that Molly and I truly loved one another, regardless of our forms.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The next morning came quickly. Frank Rhoer remained perfectly civil with Molly and I, and so did his daughters. He had even said that he tried to calm things down with Mr. Beauregard, but the man was firm about not apologizing. When the new day dawned, Molly and I were quick to get ready for what was coming. Molly for her second day of work, and me to get ready for a long drive that would begin to finish the application process with the Columbia Falls Police.</p>
