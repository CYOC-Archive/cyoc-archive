<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark thought about all the possibilities he had right now. He could do whatever he wanted with Aidan. And if he altered Aidan´s mind afterwards, he could make sure he would accept any changes. But a far bigger part of him saw himself as his friend, and even with all that control, he didn´t want to be too cruel. Maybe he could change Aidan some way that he would like, and get something out of it in the end.<br />
Aidan stood there; unsure what Mark would do to him. He seemed to be thinking what he could do, and Aidan wasn´t too happy about that. He was sure Mark was a good friend, but what if he thought otherwise? He would be helpless to any changes Mark made, after all.<br />
Finally, Mark decided on fulfilling a fantasy of his through Aidan, and hoped that Aidan would be okay with it. “Okay, Aidan. I have made a decision; which I hope you will be okay with. You will be able to speak again, as I want to know what you think about becoming some kind of dragon?” Mark explained carefully wording the sentence. It wouldn´t do changing Aidan through wrong wording, after all.<br />
Aidan looked at Mark in surprise. He had feared Mark would simply change him, but was asking him instead what he thought? Mark was still able to do so, even if Aidan spoke against it, but it gave him a bit of relieve. Thinking about it for a minute, he finally answered: “You know what, let´s try it. I think being a dragon could be cool. But maybe instead of making me a full dragon, what about just making me able to shape-shift into one? So, I can turn back if I want?”<br />
Mark smiled at that. “That would be interesting. I´m happy you like the idea. Any wish for what color you want to be?” Mark asked. To which Aidan replied he liked the color blue, more so the darker shades.<br />
“Okay, then let´s start your changes. I will first change you into a dragon at your current size, to not destroy the building around us, and then add the shape-shifting and the possibility of size-changing. Aidan, you will strip naked, and then you will become a human-sized, in royal- and sky-blue scales covered dragon and nobody will find it weird to see you afterwards. You will be able to move freely afterwards.” Mark than said, and with that, Aidan went into motion.<br />
Aidan got a bit red in embarrassment as he stripped of his jeans, socks and underwear, but he easily understood why he should strip first. Then, as soon as his underwear dropped on his other clothes, his body started to change.<br />
The first to happen was a simple wave that charged through Aidan, and with it, every hair he had on his body, including his head, dropped off of him. Then his toes started to merge together, as they were reduced from five to three on both feet. A similar thing happened to his fingers. But while his fingers shortened a bit, his toes gained a bit of length.<br />
While both Aidan himself and Mark watched, the skin on all remaining fingers and toes turned into royal blue scales, while the nails on the end of each of them grew bigger, soon covering each tip completely. Then the nails grew outwards, easily doubling the length of each digit, as they turned into large, sharp claws.<br />
The scales slowly crept from each digit, covering both of Aidan´s hands and feet, reforming them into four feet instead. This time the former hands had grown longer, while the feet stayed the same. The underside of his new feet was covered in sky-blue scales, which were a bit more sensitive than the others. The royal-blue scales grew further up his arms and legs, turning Aidan´s arms into fore-legs on the way. Each limb grew sturdier, more muscles formed underneath the scales. They were all similar in size by now.<br />
The scales crept further, covering his torso next from each side. With a small yelp of surprise Aidan felt something above his ass expand outwards, realizing that his new tail was growing in. Another yelp followed as his crotch was covered, his gear vanishing under sky-blue scales as a sheath formed around his cock, which in turn grew bigger inside of it.<br />
The scales on his chest, torso and the underside of his tail were all sky-blue. The tail stopped growing around two meters in length, with the tip shaped like a slightly bigger ball. His whole torso grew a bit in size when, like his legs, new muscles grew in. As they did so, Aidan yelled in surprise as he fell forward onto his new front-legs, and his back cracked once to keep him down afterwards. But it hadn´t been painful, only surprising for Aidan.<br />
Then, like his tail expanding out, from Aidan´s shoulder blades grew something similar to another set of arms. But it was very clear to see that it weren´t arms, but wings growing there, as membranes formed between the growing digits, also sky-blue. They stopped growing with about one and a half meters of width on each side, giving Aidan a wingspan of three meters in total. Folded back, their furthest point was half a meter behind his back-legs in the air.<br />
With his body finished changing, the scales crept up Aidan´s neck, making it longer on the way. It felt weird to Aidan when his head shot away from his body, but having half a meter of a neck wasn´t too bad. Then the scales covered his head. Before he knows it, a muzzle stretched out of his face, filled with sharper teeth and a long, split tongue. His ears were covered by scales, vanishing from sight, as only small holes were left behind. Instead, just above said holes grow a set of horns pointing backwards. The final change were his eyes, as they stretched wider, facing a bit more outside, giving him a nearly 200° field of view without turning his head. And he could still focus on what was right in front of him.<br />
In only two minutes Aidan had turned from a human being into a human-sized dragon, and right now was happy with that.</p>
