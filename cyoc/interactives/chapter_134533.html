<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Derrick glanced over as he found himself eyeing the huge Minotaurs that one of them he seen earlier was hauling an incredible number of suitcases and duffel bags for another family while another was carrying some boxes to a spa area. Muscles rippled under the thick coat of fur as the massive creature past with dinner-plate sized hooves that their unnaturally brown eyes were large and wide-set. they all looked like they were strong and built while thinking about what he remembered from Internet sites where some were used in ether fights, or labyrinth mazes that soon after is where Derrick found one to be amazingly good looking with its black fur hide, long horns, even down to his tail as he was even wearing a brownish lion cloth.<br />
<br />
All it took was his gaze to get his teenage hormones ranging as he started to pound erect that he averted when he realized the huge beast was looking straight back at him and grinned back at him with a wink. he Then flushed as Anyone else would have turned beet red and slunk off to try relieving the pressure themselves, but his eyes went wide as a strong odor came from behind when he felt a presence. Spinning around as he found himself staring at the Minotaur that had come to stand just a couple of feet away with curiosity while looking down at him when he soon wiggled a finger which only meant to say, &quot;follow me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Embarrassed at being caught, yet intrigued by him that Two things immediately became obvious to Derrick. First of all that impossible as it may seem, it wasn&#39;t a costume at all while He had assumed it was before and not really noticed as this monster from Greek mythology was real and alive. Second of all, he had a cut, scares, and scrapes while wearing a nose ring, but he did look to be about his age.<br />
<br />
Derrick walked over into step behind the Minotaur, shifting awkwardly a couple of times to get his erection out of a bind in his shorts. They left the main lobby and entered a much plainer, yet wider hallway that looked to be used mostly by staff. Most of the fauns, nymphs, centaurs even a few Minotaur were moving back and forth as some were carrying trays or boxes. many of the Minotaurs grinned at him as they passed that They all turned to watch when they approached as one winked and bellowed the one he was following something which made it laugh.<br />
<br />
They soon turned off and entered a beautiful forest glade with Trees and flowers surrounded a clear pond, though Derrick had trouble paying attention to these things as he was then lead to a cave. Derrick looked around as he was amazed by all of this that he continued to follow him to see more Minotaurs in huge stable where A few were occupied. The stalls were enormous as a few were fitted with shelves of books, basins, cabinets, and artwork when they soon noticed him and moved almost as one to surround him that Hands were suddenly all over his body and pressed against him, firm, warm bodies rubbing against his.<br />
<br />
Derrick was afraid they would take him right there At first, But was tugged and pushed gently as his shorts and shoes had been removed to free the almost painful erection. He stared back at the minotaurs as he then reached out to one of them and gently cupped the heavy testicles. the Minotaur bellowed out in pleasuring grunt that They were like warm oranges while feeling them pulse slightly in his palm.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Oh, wow.&quot; He tensed as one reached out with its three-fingered, hooflike hands and gripped his shirt that It to grunted when Derrick felt a warm breeze whip around him and then blow against his bare skin. now naked as the minotaur, He yelped when one of the them leaped up suddenly while His Minotaur entered one of the big stalls that Instincts took over as he was rolling and falling onto the soft hay, in wild abandon.<br />
<br />
He did not last long as A second leaped onto Derrick, jetting out with a cry. finally falling back in a confused daze after straining in final release that Derrick gasped as he shook his head. Was this agony or pleasure to them that it was too much for him to take as his back was arching and arms flailing while one of the two settled down on him and rode him like a bucking bronco, which Derrick cried out.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way! I&#39;m....&quot; he started to say, but Then his eyes widened as his still partially-erect cock and began to get harder than before. when he was fully aroused that If anything, the two seemed to be very horny as they began to masturbate him.<br />
<br />
Oddly enough, he lasted longer this time, and shuddered in powerful release as one of them continued to ride him until the Minotaur slid off of him that second had its turn of him. soon it sat on his crotch while grinning down at his sweat streaked face. He stared back up at the minotaur, open-mouthed as he was feeling more excited now than scared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... wow.&quot; Derrick wheezed out the words, too exhausted to even sit up. He hadn&#39;t dreamed of anything like this in his imagination, but then it stood up as a third settled in his place that Unlike the first two is where this one took his time with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! I can&#39;t. There&#39;s nothing left. What else can you do?&quot; he moaned weakly as he slid off that at first Derrick thought he had a reprieve, but then felt his tongue on the base of his shaft while caressing his testicles to pull oddly at loose skin.<br />
<br />
Still breathing hard, he slowly lifted his head enough to look down and see the sexual equipment getting attention from the last Minotaur wasn&#39;t what he&#39;d started with that Even if you discounted more than double the length and width, the heavy foreskin now covered what had been a circumcised penis. impossibly, the penis was coming erect again as Derrick felt pressure building in his testicles that had to be at least double on what he&#39;d had to start out with. it then grinned feraly at him as it soon crawled back up over his chest like a prowling cat that Derrick panted in fear of having a heart attack at 15, yet excitement with shock when it&#39;s tongue pressed into his mouth while giving him some lessons on a passionate kiss, tasting oddly of grass though when it later locked lips with him and slid back to engage his fully roused shaft. if this minotaur wasn&#39;t male that he would of liked it better, yet he was half afraid when he suddenly would have his oversized cock explode.<br />
<br />
Derrick couldn&#39;t breathe, couldn&#39;t speak, his head slammed back into the hay that the minotaur he came with soon snorted at the third minotaur he was with and dismounted him. Derrick shuddered and sweated as his mind overwhelmed by pleasure/pain that did not stop. When he was finally allowed release as it seemed like he had a firehose between his legs that He exploded, crying out in pleasure and screamed, but soon got up and automatically followed.<br />
<br />
once inside a stall with iron bar door, The minotaur snorted and lifted a gold ring hanging from a leather thong on the wall. There were symbols marked on it as It was huge, which seemed to match the ring that passed through the bovine&#39;s nose. The minotaur broke it free with a sudden jerk, after he turned to face him and reached out to stroke the side of his face with one large finger.<br />
<br />
he soon bellowed softly to Derrick as he took it while staring at the heavy item that he then looked back up at the one in the minotaur&#39;s snout. the sound oddly penetrating in his mind The second time when he made the noise again. Derrick blinked as he understood the minotaur&#39;s words that he was offering him a choice, a chance of a life time.</p>
