<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Their Mom arrived at the camp just in time, driving at a frantic pace.  The gates were just about to close when she ran forward with the forms in her hand.  After looking them over, the guard allowed her children to enter.  She gave them a quick kiss goodbye, and watched as the gates closed behind her children.  Although she was nervous, she was also excited to see the changes in her children when she returned in a few months.  She drove home with a mixture of feelings - relief, exhaustion, and excitement.<br />
<br />
Mandy and Cindy looked around at all the many kids in camp.  They made their way through the crowd to a tall thin woman reading off a list of names, directing them to different bunks.  Soon, just a small group of children were left.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I didn&#39;t call your name that means that you need to stop by the doctor&#39;s office with me before you go to your bunk,&quot; said the woman.<br />
<br />
Doctor?  Why the hell do we need to see a doctor? thought Mandy.  Did they need a physical or something before they could go get settled?  Mom had just taken them to the doctor - an experience she was not keen to repeat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maam,&quot; said Mandy, as she approached the woman. &quot;Are you sure we need to go?   I mean, I just saw the doctor a few weeks ago and I am perfectly healthy. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mandy, don&#39;t make trouble.  Let&#39;s just go, &quot; said Cindy.  She was still nervous about her little white lie about her age.  How much trouble would she get into if they found out?  Would they kick her out?  Would the other kids make fun of her?  She would be mortified.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up, Cindy,&quot; hissed Mandy.<br />
<br />
The tall woman looked over a list on her clipboard.  It wasn&#39;t really necessary.  The girls were both so small they definitely needed treatment.  But she had to make it look official for the child.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah hah.  Right here.  Cindy and Mandy.  Yes, I afraid you will have to see the doctor.  But don&#39;t worry.  We&#39;ll have you back playing with your friends in no time,&quot; said the tall woman as she ruffled Mandy&#39;s hair.<br />
<br />
Mandy scowled.  She hated when tall people did that.  Treat her like a little kid.  If only she could be tall and beautiful like the counselor.  As they walked with her to the doctor&#39;s office, Mandy admired and envied the counselor&#39;s long legs and tall body.<br />
<br />
If only, she thought sadly.<br />
<br />
Mandy and her sister waited with a small group of kids in a waiting room.  Mandy smiled when she noticed that most of the kids were small like her.  A few must have been younger, but at least she wouldn&#39;t be the only short one in camp. Of course, she would always be taller than Cindy. The kids sat quietly until their names were called.  Cindy went first.<br />
<br />
**********************************************************************************************************************<br />
<br />
Doctor Johnson sat at his desk reviewing the file as the next patient entered.  Most of the information was missing, but the important stats had been entered.<br />
<br />
Name: Cindy<br />
Age:     17<br />
Height: 5&#39;1&quot;<br />
<br />
And of course the signed parental consent.  Couldn&#39;t do anything without that.  He looked up from his glasses and saw the shy young girl sit on the examination table.  She looked scared to death.  And much smaller than he expected.  He looked over her stats again.  It wasn&#39;t uncommon for girls to lie about their height.  Especially the older girls, who wanted to be taller like their friends.  So the inaccurate height was not much of a surprise.<br />
<br />
He stood up and walked over to the examination table.  Cindy was almost shivering with fright.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Cindy.  My name is Dr. Johnson.   I am just going to do a little physical examination, then send you on your way.  Nothing to be scared of.  Just relax,&quot; said Dr. Johnson.<br />
<br />
After a thorough examination, he sat down beside Cindy.  The doctor was tall, about 6&#39;2&quot; and the chair was intentionally kept low so he was at eye level with his patients.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cindy, everything seems to be normal.  But I do have one question.... is everything on this form factual, to the best of your knowledge?&quot; asked Dr. Johnson.<br />
<br />
Cindy nodded slowly and with a look guilt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?  Is this the correct height?&quot; asked the doctor.<br />
<br />
Cindy nodded a little more confidently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t we check it?  Just to be sure, &quot; said the doctor.  He measured Cindy against  a tape measure along the edge of wall.  &quot;Hmm..... 4&#39;5&quot;.  Does that sound about right to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cindy nodded, and the doctor made a few notes.  The doctor sighed.  &quot;Cindy, I know this information is incorrect.  Why would you lie? &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just didn&#39;t want everyone to make fun of me, &quot; said Cindy, as she broke down and cried.  The doctor reached over and comforted her.  He had rarely seen such an emotional response, especially from someone so old.  He decided that she must really be hurting, and wanted to help her.  <br />
<br />
A 17 year old that is only 4&#39;5&quot; .... she must really be in pain, he thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cindy, don&#39;t worry.  No one will make fun of you here.  We&#39;ll make sure of that.  But you need to trust us and be honest. Nurse Harris and I are medical professionals.  Everything you say will be kept in the strictest confidence. So you can tell us anything.  And if you have any problems - any kind of problem - please just talk to a counselor and we will take care of it right away.  Now why don&#39;t you follow Miss Smith and she will get you cleaned up and send you to your new bunk.  This is going to be a great summer for you, I promise,&quot; said Dr. Johnson.<br />
<br />
He patted her on the back as Miss Smith led her away. When she was out of earshot, Dr. Johnson discussed her treatment with Nurse Harris.<br />
<br />
&quot;Poor kid, &quot; said Nurse Harris.  &quot;I really hope we can help her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can and we will, &quot; said Dr. Johnson confidently.  &quot;I want her on double dose of the growth hormone right away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Double?  Are you sure Doctor?&quot; asked Nurse Harris.<br />
<br />
The Doctor was cross.  &quot;We have to be aggressive here. The girl is seventeen years old and we don&#39;t have much time to work.  She is only 4&#39;5&quot; for God&#39;s sake.  We have a lot of ground to make up for in a very limited time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand, but double?  Is that safe?&quot; asked the nurse.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll make it safe.  We&#39;ll give her double the dose of estrogen supplements.  The excess estrogen will cause her growth plates to fuse before she gets too tall.  And it should help her fill out a little more, too,&quot; said the Doctor.<br />
<br />
The nurse nodded, taking notes.  &quot;Double the estrogen dosage, hmmm? She is going to become quite the fetching young lady.  She will be beating the boys away with a stick, &quot; said the nurse with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, &quot; said the Doctor. &quot;I don&#39;t think anyone will be teasing her after we have finished treating her.  Now send in the next patient.&quot;<br />
<br />
*************************************************************************************************************<br />
  <br />
Cindy was almost out the door when Nurse Harris ran up to her holding a large cold shake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, you need to drink this. Doctor&#39;s orders,&quot; said Nurse Harris.<br />
<br />
Cindy took the shake and looked at her with confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;The doctor thought you looked a little malnourished.  It&#39;s just a nutritional shake to make sure you get all the right vitamins and nutrients.  Drink up,&quot; said Nurse Harris.<br />
<br />
Cindy gulped it down. It was quite tasty, almost like a milk shake.  &quot;That was good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am glad you like it, &quot; said Nurse Harris.  &quot;You will have to drink one every day for the rest of camp.  Drink every drop, every day, and don&#39;t share it with anyone!  Understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Nurse Harris, &quot; said Cindy quietly, almost sadly.<br />
<br />
Nurse Harris smiled.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Cindy.  By the end of the summer, you will be a new woman.  Trust me.  Now go out there and have some fun.  You are only young once.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cindy smiled, and walked with Miss Smith to her new bunk.  She sighed when she saw that all of the girls were much taller than her.  So they had found out her lie, and weren&#39;t going to put her with the 9 year olds.  At least they were keeping it a secret and not kicking her out.  Most of the other girls looked much more mature than her, even older.  Was this some kind of punishment?  <br />
<br />
No, she thought.  The doctor and nurse were pretty nice.  They just want to help me.<br />
<br />
Cindy quietly found a bunk and got settled, trying to avoid getting noticed by the other girls.</p>
