<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andy was backstage, as giddy as a kid on Christmas. Meanwhile, the school&#39;s cheerleaders performed and opening dance routine. Andy did a last minute check on Jenny who sat on the chronivac. &quot;Everything ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All good to go boss.&quot; She said in her melodious voice. While Jenny loved being a girl, in part to the changes in reality Andy made, she had a tendency to dress a bit boyish with cargo pants and a loose T-shirt when she felt like she had no one to impress. Considering she was supposed to be back stage tonight, it was one of those times.<br />
<br />
Natalie prepared the first prop while wearing a very daring red leotard that gave a generous view of her cleavage and was a bit cheeky in the back. Her hair laid on her shoulders in red waves. &quot;I can&#39;t wait for that bitch Sandra to be changed. She always tells everyone I became an assistant because I couldn&#39;t make the team and I never tried out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, she will be the assistant tonight. Looks like they are a out ready. Shall we go?&quot;<br />
<br />
Natalie smiled. Several cheerleaders did the splits while Sandra jumped in the air to do hers, giving a good view of the spanks she wore under he incredibly short skirt.<br />
<br />
Once the number the music ended Natalie bent down and becan to push a platform onto the stage. Behind her while Jenny made a joke. &quot;Careful with that full moon while out there. I&#39;ll bet you will hear wolves whistle as the change from it.&quot; Natalie casually flipped her sister off as Andy passed her up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you very much ladies, now if you could help me with one more thing before leaving the stage.&quot; This wouldn&#39;t be a surprise to the squad. They new their part in the show, even if Andy had to make a mental change that they wouldn&#39;t question how the trick was done or what it was. All they knew is that they were supposed to help on stage, no questions asked. <br />
<br />
Behind him Natalie moved the panels off of the platform while Sandra responded. &quot;Of course,  just tell us what you need. I&#39;m happy to one of your lovely assistants.&quot; Natalie wanted her to say honored but Andy felt like that would be laying it on a little thick. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well this is a big trick, and it sill need all 12 of you.&quot; Natalie was attaching on of the panels at the base of the platform on the left side. She raised a platform to stand straight up. &quot;First I need one of you to help keep this up.&quot; Andy pointed out a short brunette. &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vicky.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Vicky, we are building a box in front of our audience here so they know there are no hidden tricks. I need to help keep the panels up, so would you mind going in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot; Vicky said loudly with a large smile. She marched towards the front of the stage with her pom-poms on her hips and faced the audience. She kicked straight up so her shin almost touched her forehead and clapped her pom-poms in front of her before bringing her foot down and turning to head to the platform. <br />
<br />
Vicky stepped up on the platform and faced the panel with white cloth and a silver border. The audience could see her side profile while Andy walked to the other side. &quot;There are holes for your hands right here.&quot; He showed Vicky where to put her hands. &quot;Please place the pom-poms here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vicky obeyed, her arms somewhat spread further than her shoulder width. One hand was above the other, each with a pom-pom. &quot;Now Vicky,&quot; Andy continued. &quot;I need to to do what cheerleaders do best and shake those pom-poms whenever I ask you to.&quot; Vicky shook the pom-poms while smiling at the audience. <br />
<br />
While Vicky was getting in place while Natalie attached a panel to the other side. She began to lift it as Andy picked another cheerleader. This one with hair dyed crimson. &quot;What is your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Natasha!&quot; She shouted with glee. <br />
<br />
&quot;Natasha, would you mind holding uo the next wall?&quot; <br />
<br />
In response she marched to the front of the stage. She then slid with one leg in front and one behind and did a perfect split. She quickly stood up and stepped on the platform. She quickly placed her hands through holes similar to Vicky.<br />
<br />
Natalie began to attach a much larger panel to the back while Andy approached the front of the stage to address the audience. &quot;Now, Vicky and Natasha are holding up the walls on the left and right. Ladies?&quot; He looked over his shoulders to see the two smiling cheerleaders shake their pom-poms in response. Looking back at the audience he continued. &quot;As many of you know, a box is a cube meaning it has six sides. Counting the platform, which is slightly elevated to show there is nothing beneath and we can&#39;t use a trap door, we have three sides. The lovely Natalie is attaching our fourth side. The length however will be a bit too difficult for one person to hold.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy looked at the 10 remaining cheerleaders and seemed to think for a moment. &quot;I think four would work. Who would like to volunteer? &quot;<br />
<br />
They appeared to discuss it for a moment before four stepped forward. One was of Asian decent while another was an African American. The last two were white, one with black hair and the other with the blonde hair and large breasts people think all cheerleaders have.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you very much. May I have your names?&quot;<br />
<br />
Without answering him the lined up at the front of the stage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sally!&quot; The black girl answered before jumping into a tight spinning flip. As her feet hit the ground, and echoed across the auditorium, the blonde jumped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beatrice!&quot; She did an identical flip. As she landed the Asian girl called her name out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yuki!&quot; She also flipped followed by girl with black hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Laura!&quot; Once her flip was over the four of them stepped onto the platform. The length of the platform accommodated the four of them and still left room for Vicky and Natasha. Natalie holding the platform on the other side helped them find the holes for their pom-poms.<br />
<br />
Andy quickly directed 4 of the remaining cheerleaders while Sandra and another black girl remained on the side. Two cheerleaders went to the each side and began to turn the platform.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now ladies, keep shaking the pom-poms.&quot; They all complied as they were taken out of view, hidden behind the white walls of the make shift box.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I need to attach the walls to help keep the box stable.&quot; Andy connected a clasps on the first edge. While the back of the box was visible Andy walked to the other end past the still shaking pom-poms, locking that corner as well. <br />
<br />
The box continued rotating with the help of the four remaining cheerleader as the rest of theor squad came back into view.<br />
<br />
Sasha and the other cheerleader to the side had grabbed another panel. &quot;Next, we need a rough. Sasha, would you and your co-captain be so kind?&quot;<br />
<br />
The two cheerleaders placed the panel on the top, and their teammates began to latch the roof down. They then marched to the front of the stage and did cartwheels in opposite directions. Both did a split with legs out to their sides. &quot;Sasha!&quot; The captain yelled before standing up and heading to the box. &quot;Laquisha!&quot; Her co-captain echoed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Both stood taller than the rest and put their hands through roof. To pair of pom-poms joined the rest of the squads.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now we have one wall left, and this one will need 4 people as well.&quot; Natalie attached the final panel as Andy looked at the final four cheerleaders. &quot;Ready to enter the box?&quot;<br />
<br />
A Hispanic girl went to the front of the stage. &quot;Crusmaria!&quot; She then entered the box.<br />
<br />
The next was a natural red head instead of the fake red if Natasha. &quot;Callie.&quot; A brunette was next. &quot;Lindsay! &quot; the final one announced herself. &quot;Lilly!&quot;<br />
<br />
With all four of them at the front, Natalie raised the wall so they could put their hands through the holes. Natalie stood on the right with Natasha while Andy went on the left with Vicky. &quot;Now, from this moment on all of you need to keep shaking those pom-poms till the end of the trick. Ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
In response they all shook their pom-poms. &quot;Okay ladies, we will see you in a minute.&quot; They raised the final wall, enclosing the cheer squad inside. Natalie and and Andy locked the last ones in place while the pom-poms continued to shake.<br />
<br />
Andy grabbed a cord on his side. It was set up with a domino effect. When he pulled it the curtains would all fall showing those inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, don&#39;t blink because something amazing will happen on the counter of three. Girls, keep shaking those pom-poms so we know you&#39;re in there!&quot;<br />
<br />
The cheerleaders all gave a quick cheer before Andy started counting.<br />
<br />
&quot;ONE! TWO!&quot; All the pom-poms dropped simultaneously on two, with the two above dropping to touch the rough. Andy pulled the cord as he shouted &quot;THREE&quot; the curtains fell, the walls all now empty frame.<br />
<br />
Inside there were no cheer squad but 12 border collies wearing dog versions if the cheer uniform.  &quot;What are school sports without cheerleaders, and what is a cheer squad without their mascots?&quot;</p>
<hr/><h3>
The crowd went wild. &quot;Now! Who is ready for the next trick?</h3>
