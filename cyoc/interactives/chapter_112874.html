<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Freddie Parker was many things; a thug, crook, half decent cook and a father. But the one thing he was not, was a fool. Freddie knew busting his son out of jail; even if it was a small town jail was a dumb ideal. That would bring the wrath of every single police detachment in the state of Washington down on him. So Freddie had to make is son bide his time while the lawyers did the best they could to find a way to get Daniel released; faint hope as it may be, Freddie knew his son was wanted and subject to a no bond hold for his bail jumping. Still he was a Parker and as such, entitled to have the best possible legal defense.<br />
<br />
Yet even Freddie knew the lawyers faced an uphill battle. Car Jacking, aggravated assault and attempted aggravated murder; Serious charges to beat even for the son of a mob boss. With the added wrinkle of the victim being the son of an important person in Moon Lake; Freddie wasted no time in calling all his contacts to find out everything he could about the Talbots.<br />
<br />
After taking the red eye to Seattle and enduring a grueling two hours car ride from the airport to Moon Lake; Freddie used the time to read up on what his people could dig up on the Talbots. What he had wasn’t much. A large family that ran a restoration company specializing in rare and antique automobiles. The family patriarch being Leon Talbot; married to Regina and a father of two children. The man also having a large family of brothers and sisters; each with their own children as well.<br />
“This really isn’t much to go on,” Freddie glaring at his assistant; “what about any side activities? My son said this person had powerful friends in town. I want this information!”<br />
“This is all we could get on short notice,” the assistant answering; “on top of that, there really isn’t much to go on. If this Leon Talbot is a man with connections, he hides it well.”<br />
“When is my son’s arraignment,” Freddie demanding.<br />
“In an hour,” the assistant answering; “the lawyers are already at the courthouse. And they weren’t exactly thrilled.”<br />
“Why is that,” Freddie asking; “I’m paying them to get my son out by whatever means. What could they be so upset over?”<br />
“For a small town,” the assistant sighing; “this place has a lot of security. State of the art,” the assistant adding; “possibly cutting edge and not exactly on the market.”<br />
“So we spring my son as he transported out of town then,” Freddie dismissing his assistants concerns; “everyone knows that the weakest link in any security system is in transport. Right now though,” Freddie nodding to the silent man cleaning a hand gun with a silencer and watching him leave the darkened limousine parked in an empty parking lot; “I want to see my son and get the lay of the land.”<br />
“Do you want to arrange a sit down with Leon Talbot as well,” the assistant asking.<br />
“Not just yet,” Freddie thinking; “for now let us bide our time. Let the lawyers do their work. We’ll approach Leon after the arraignment.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Samantha gasped as Frances brought her over the edge. Her body shuddering as she yowled in delight; the rough tongue from the were-cat pleasuring her sex. With her canal spilling its slick juices; Samantha was moaning and sighing as Frances lapped up the sweet honey. Both purring as they enjoyed the moment of mutual passion.<br />
“Oh god Frances,” Samantha gasping; “that was amazing.”<br />
“It looks like you needed some stress relief as well,” Frances finishing up lapping all the juices Samantha produced; “you gave me a lot to drink down this time.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Ben who despite in his human form and dressed; heard the entire event going on in his mothers’s room. Sitting in the living room and watching some t.v while he kills some time before leaving to deal with some forms needing filled at Grrrrrrr. Hearing his mother’s starting up again; Ben hears the doorbell ringing. This also causes Frances and Samantha to stop as he gets up to answer the door.<br />
<br />
“Sheriff Cooper,” Ben seeing the man at the door.<br />
“Ben right,” Sheriff looking at the teen before him; “is Samantha here I need to speak to her.”<br />
“Give her a moment,” Ben inviting the sheriff in; “mom was-“<br />
“You don’t need to tell the sheriff Ben,” Samantha heading down the stairs.<br />
<br />
Sheriff Cooper, who was a were grizzly; was no strange to seeing Samantha in her fursona from time to time. But getting the strong smell of arousal and recent sexual activity from her was something the sheriff was unaccustomed to.<br />
“I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t important,” The sheriff speaking; “but by now I’m certain you have heard about what happened last night.”<br />
“What happened last night Sheriff,” Samantha asking.<br />
“You don’t know,” the sheriff looking stunned; “you mean the council hasn’t got a hold of you?”<br />
“I had my phone off,” Samantha answering; “personal reasons.”<br />
“Well,” the sheriff responding; “Peter Talbot was shot last night.”<br />
“WHAT,” Samantha shouting; “Ben leave now!”<br />
“Mom-“ Ben speaking but being interrupted<br />
“NOW,” Samantha grabbing her phone and turning it on; “don’t argue with me Ben.”<br />
“Always when something exciting happens,” Ben grumbling as he heads outside.<br />
<br />
Samantha seeing the messages she didn’t receive starting to flood her phone after it booted up; the texts and voicemail confirming what the sheriff just said.<br />
“I take it,” Samantha getting a quick summary; “that Peter is alright?”<br />
“As alright one can be,” the sheriff answering; “after having a bullet shred your insides. He is in the hospital recovering,” Sheriff Cooper adding.<br />
“And the person who shot Leon’s son,” Samantha asking; “what became of the person?”<br />
“In jail,” the sheriff answering; “he is the son of a mob boss in California and has a lengthy record and a warrant for bail jumping.”<br />
“Mob boss,” Samantha looking at the sheriff?<br />
“Freddie the shark Parker,” Sheriff Cooper answering; “his son Daniel Parker shot Peter just to steal his 66 mustang.”<br />
Does this Parker person know of our secret,” Samantha looking concerned; “did Peter-“<br />
“No,” Sheriff Cooper answers; “Peter didn’t shift until after he flat lined on the way to the hospital from what I heard. Daniel Parker doesn’t know the town is populated with weres; yet he has suspected something wrong. Our hidden surveillance cameras have picked upon his mumbling. Pacing around in his cell after he woke up; Daniel said the place smelled like a zoo.”<br />
“How is Leon taking the situation,” Samantha asking.<br />
“I don’t know,” Sheriff asking; “after informing the were-lion king of his son being shot last night, I haven’t spoken to him since. There is one thing you should know,” the sheriff adding; “FBI agent Brooke Reed is back and she is now a werewolf.”<br />
“Brooke Reed,” Samantha looking confused; “should I know her?”<br />
“She assisted in escorting agent Walker back to Quantico after he went rogue and started harassing the Lawson’s and snooping around the town.”<br />
“Oh,” Samantha understanding; “that was shortly after the incident with the Bowers. Why is agent Reed here?”<br />
“To assist the U.S Marshalls in bring Daniel Parker back to San-Francisco,” Sheriff answering; “he was a warrants stemming from operating an illegal gambling operation.”<br />
“Okay,” Samantha sighing; “keep me posted.”<br />
<br />
Watching the Sheriff leave; Samantha looks up to see Frances poking her feline head from the top of the stairs.<br />
“Just what we need,” Samantha looking at her life partner; “mobsters running around in our town.”<br />
“They’ll be sorry if they try to do anything stupid,” Frances speaking; “you coming back upstairs?”<br />
“Yes,” Samantha answering; “but I need to get dressed and head over to the court house. I want to be there for this nob’s arraignment.”<br />
“I’ll join you,” Frances responding.</p>
