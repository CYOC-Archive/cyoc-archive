<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amy said &quot;I think that we should stick with our ages to start with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Rick said. &quot;Which one of us will go first?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll go first since I have the next two days off&quot; Amy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; Rick said. &quot;You should take off your clothes first as they may not fit once you change. Besides, I want to watch the changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good idea&quot; Amy said. She took off her clothes right there. After she was naked she held the crystal she had fished out of the pool and said &quot;30, male.&quot; The changes started immediately. She gained a few inches in height. Her long hair shortened and styled itself into a male style. Her d size breasts shrank to c, b, a, aa, and finally she was as flat chested as any male. Hair started to grow on her<br />
chest and face as her face became more masculine. Her shoulders broadened while her arms gained more muscle mass. Her fingernails shortened to a more masculine length while her hands became broader. Her feet also became broader while her legs gained more muscle mass. Hair even appeared on her legs which was odd since she had had electrolysis on her legs, arm pits, and crotch. Speaking of her crotch, hair grew there too while her hips narrowed and her waist<br />
widened. The last change that Rick was able to see was Amy's labia sagging down a bit and something poke out. Rick realized that that was now her dick. It moved forward a bit to the normal position.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, it worked&quot; Rick said. &quot;Are you completely male?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My balls just dropped into the sack&quot; Amy said in her new masculine voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you feel?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel great&quot; Amy said. &quot;This body is so much better than my female one. I think I'll stay male though I may change my age.&quot; Amy looked at the crystal she was holding and said &quot;Oh no. The crystal is black. I hope that it still works.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it does&quot; Rick said. &quot;I think that it's just recharging.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you're right&quot; Amy said. &quot;I don't want to be stuck at my current age. But right now it's your turn to change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just let me call the cafe to let them know I'm taking the rest of the day off&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright but don't take too long&quot; Amy said.<br />
<br />
Rick picked up the phone and dialed the cafe.<br />
<br />
&quot;R and A LAN and Internet Cafe&quot; a voice said when the phone at the cafe was picked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Mike&quot; Rick said. &quot;I'm calling to let you know that I'm taking the rest of the day off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; Mike said. &quot;Everything's good here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Rick said. &quot;Amy and I found a couple of strange crystals. They have the power to change your age and gender. Well at least your gender since Amy already used the one she found to change herself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's your guy's fondest wish&quot; Mike said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it is so don't be surprised if you call and you hear an unfamiliar voice&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, have fun&quot; Mike said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye Mike&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye&quot; Mike said and hung up.<br />
<br />
When Rick hung up Amy said &quot;Ok now strip. I want to watch you change.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Rick was undressing he said &quot;You know we should choose new names. I can't keep calling you Amy when you're male.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right&quot; Amy said. &quot;I've always liked the name Luke so I'll go by that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I've always liked the name Lisa&quot; Rick said. &quot;So that will be my name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Luke said. &quot;Now are you going to change or not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I'm going to change&quot; Rick said as he kicked off his underwear. He picked up the crystal he found and said &quot;34, female.&quot; As with Luke the changes started immediately. Rick felt himself shrink a few inches but it seemed like it was far away. He figured that the change could be painful and so it dulled it. He felt his face rearrange itself into a more feminine appearance and what stubble he had pull back in. His hair grew down to mid back while his shoulders<br />
became slender. His arms and legs lost some muscle mass as they slimmed down and became more feminine. The hair on his chest pulled back into his body while his hips widened and his waist slimmed. His hands and feet became daintier while his fingernails grew a bit. His balls pulled into his body while his dick shrank and finally pulled into his body. His ball sack also shrank but instead of pulling up into his body it formed labia. It moved back a bit to where it would<br />
be on a female. He could feel his internal organs shift and change to make room for his uterus that was currently forming. He felt his Adam's Apple shrink. The last change that took place was his chest started to grow out. His chest went from being flat to aa, a, b, and finally c.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well how was it Lisa?&quot; Luke asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why didn't you tell me that I would experience the change like I was on Novocaine?&quot; Lisa asked in her new female voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I wanted it to be a surprise&quot; Luke said. &quot;How do you feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel great&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I don't want to change back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I figured as much&quot; Luke said.<br />
<br />
&quot;My legs are still hairy&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you'll just have to shave them and your armpits&quot; Luke said. &quot;And maybe your crotch as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa looked down at Luke's dick and saw that it was erect. She felt her pussy get wet and her clit engorge slightly.<br />
<br />
Noticing where Lisa's attention was Luke said &quot;It looks like we might have a little problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we can take care of that&quot; Lisa said as she smiled and approached Luke.</p>
