<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jen was about to leave for school, she suddenly felt a sharp pain from somewhere new. Looking behind her, she saw a blur quickly move out of her sight. Curious as to what it was, she turned around again. There it was, a brown and gold blur. Jen was getting concerned. What on earth was it? She turned the other way. And saw it yet again, this time going the other way. <br />
<br />
Clearly something was either hiding from her, or stuck on her. Reaching behind, she tried feeling her back but found nothing but her hair, which was not what she was looking for. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh, what did she put on me this time?!&quot; Jen grumbled to herself. Kara was not unknown to leave various pranks on her back when she was a kid. And while she hadn&#39;t done it in months, Jen never forgot about them. <br />
<br />
Moving into her bathroom, Jen grabbed her hand mirror and turned her back to the large wall mirror, using the hand mirror to see behind her. When she saw it, she nearly dropped the mirror. Gently setting down the mirror, she cautiously reached behind and grabbed at her apparent tail. [When did Kara put this on me?] Jen wondered in her head. Well, at least I found it before school.<br />
<br />
Giving it a tug, she quickly dropped to her knees. Tears were forming in her eyes and she couldn&#39;t help but to stifle a cry of pain, not wanting anyone to see her. While rubbing her lower back where her tail connected to her body, Jen was busy still mentally comming to terms with what she just found out.<br />
<br />
She has a tail.<br />
<br />
But it isn&#39;t just any tail, it is clearly a german shepherd&#39;s tail. It both looked and felt so similar to her dog&#39;s. What could she do? She clearly couldn&#39;t be seen in public with a tail! Forget the news finding out, she could be forcably taken by medical professionals to some lab somewhere to be experimented on, all because she spontaneously grew a tail. She had to hide it. Skipping school for being &quot;sick&quot; would only bring her more troubles. <br />
<br />
Quickly thinking, she ran back to her room, tail wagging back and forth, and stripped off her cheerleading uniform. Grabbing one of her casual knee length dresses, she tried her best to conceal her tail by tucking it up against her waist. Luckily this dress had a 6&quot; band which she would tie around her waist into a large bow in the back. This helped hide the buldge her tail made. But nothing would hide her self conciousness of having the tail.<br />
<br />
Somehow Jen had made it to school without anyone realizing. She was just letting her guard down when someone whispered behind her &quot;nice tail Jen&quot;. She didn&#39;t recognize the voice, and when she turned around no one was standing there, meaning it was anyeone in the group of students which was flowing past her. Well, any male student that is. But who? Who knew already? And further more, how?<br />
<br />
That was when familiar 3 girls showed up next to her. Sara, Hailey, and Naomi. 3 of her best friends who she was having over tonight. Only Susan was absent since she had class on the other side of school. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you sexy bitch&quot; teased Hailey, &quot;you didn&#39;t have to dress up just for me. Of course I will go out with you, and I gotta admit that I am seriously loving the bow.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shut up you horny lesbian! Jen is so out of your league.&quot; Joked Sara. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t mind them, you look lovely&quot; said Naomi, who only added fuel to their flames by playfully kissing Jen on the cheek. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh please, I only would ever consider dating a girl who was bigger than me&quot; Jen retorted, cupping what little of Hailey&#39;s B cup boobs she could manage. <br />
<br />
&quot;So you would date me then right&quot; Naomi said, moving behind her and pulling Jen into her own F-cups. She was the only girl who&#39;s boobs were bigger than Jen&#39;s D-cups on the squad. Plus she was almost a foot taller than her too, towering over her at 6&#39;-5&quot;. <br />
<br />
Jen just took her usual place, her head sandwiched between Naomi&#39;s 2 soft boobs with Naomi using her shoulders to carry their weight as she held Jen against her body by draping her arms over her. The 2 of them had been extremely close friends, the longest out of all of them on the squad. And for a brief time had even &quot;secretly&quot; dated a years ago. Secretly being the misguiding word, since probably a good 80% of their class knew about it after only just 3 days into it. When the news that 2 of the hottest girls simultaneously came out as bisexuals AND that they were now dating eachother, the student&#39;s spoke about it, a lot.<br />
<br />
It was what actually had &quot;broken them up&quot; too. Too many jealous guys making it difficult for them. Though THAT was their real secret. They had never actually broken up. They just joked about it to the point no one really cared anymore, and kept their relationship strictly private. Ironically, Kara was the one who helped them out the most. For the only time in her life, Jen was thankful for her sister&#39;s ability and knowledge of how to manipulate people. <br />
<br />
Jen was caught up in the fun and had completely forgotten about her newest addition. &quot;Uh, Jen. You got a minute to talk, in private&quot; whispered Naomi into her ear. <br />
<br />
Jen nodded subtly as to not draw attention to their conversation. &quot;Anyways, I got to get to class. See you guys tonight!&quot; Said Hailey. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shit me too, I can&#39;t be late again&quot; Sara added. Taking off running after Hailey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s convenient&quot; said Naomi. <br />
<br />
&quot;So what&#39;s up?&quot; Jen, while tilting her head back asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bathroom&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, but we cannot fuck today, or for possibly a while I guess.&quot; Apologized Jen. Naomi smelled really good though, and she really wanted to have their usual &quot;secret morning sex on fridays&quot; like they always did, but not with her tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that, though we can address that later. Just come on.&quot; Naomi began pulling Jen into the nearby girls bathroom and into one of the larger handicap stalls. There school didn&#39;t have anyone in a wheelchair so they shouldn&#39;t be interrupted. No one else was in this bathroom since it was fairly out of the way to get to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, what do you want to talk about?&quot; Asked Jen. But Naomi didn&#39;t say a word, and just spun her around and lifted up her dress, exposing her tail. It also reminded Jen that she had forgotten to put her panties back on when she changed clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets start with this, shall we? Explain. Why exactly do you have a tail butt plug in your ass? And why are you going commando today?&quot; Naomi questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. Honestly it just appeared this morning. Also, it might be hard to believe, but it isn&#39;t a plug, it is a real tail.&quot; Jen admitted, feeling a mixture of anxiety, depression, humiliation, panic, and steadily increasing arousal, which would have already soaked through her panties if she had any on.</p>
