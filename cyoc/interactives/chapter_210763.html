<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">No, this wouldn&#39;t work. Heather could feel Mel&#39;s iron grip holding her tight. If she tried to jump she would surely fail and probably lose her chance at getting to the booklet. Even if she did manage to break free she was certain that Mel would quickly catch her again, the thick diaper would slow her down too much. Resigning herself to her fate she allowed Mel to carry her past her bedroom and into the bathroom.<br />
<br />
The change had struck here as well. Before there was a standard size tub with a shower enclosure built into it. Now the bathroom seemed to have stolen some space from her parent&#39;s closet so it could fit a separate shower stall and expand the tub. Heather gazed into the shower, knowing she would not be using it today. She could see bottles of her sister&#39;s preferred brands of hair and skin products lining the shelf inside, but none of her own. She looked at the tub next, it seemed divided. On one side were all the toys and soap that her mother used for Derek&#39;s baths. The other side had many of the same products, only pinker.<br />
<br />
Mel set her down on the floor and busied herself with preparing the bath. Heather just sat there, legs spread in front of her, and watched. Mel ran the water, testing it carefully with her elbow, and poured a measure of bubble bath in. With the tub well on its way to being full she turned her attention to her charge. Heather decided that cooperation was needed now. the sooner she got this over with the sooner she could get to the pamphlet. Grudgingly, she raised her arms so that Mel could begin stripping her.<br />
<br />
Mel took the invitation. She unsnapped the shortalls and pulled them up and over Heather&#39;s head followed almost immediately by the onesie. Then she pulled the socks off of Heather&#39;s feet before pushing her back and untaping the diaper. Heather lifted her head so she could look down at the padding as it was pulled away. It was heavy and wet with a slight yellow tinge. She shuddered. Before all of this she would have noticed immediately if she had peed herself even a fraction that badly. Mel grabbed a wipe and Heather braced herself for a repeat of what had happened at the park, but Mel just cleaned her normally. Heather hoped that kind of treatment would continue.<br />
<br />
Now stripped and cleaned, Mel lifted Heather off the floor and lowered her into the bath. It was almost full now and Heather sank into the warm water gratefully, letting the bubbles hide her naked body from sight. She sat and watched Mel open a cupboard and pull out a water-proof plastic smock which she pulled on over her dress. Heather guessed it was in case the &#39;baby&#39; splashed. Mel returned to the now full tub and shut the water off. Looking down at the very vulnerable-feeling Heather she grinned another of her wicked grins.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is baby ready to be cleaned?&quot; She asked in a sing-song voice.<br />
<br />
Heather shook her head hesitantly. Her friend&#39;s manic-looking grin was beginning to unnerve her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Mel replied, tilting her head to the side. &quot;But since when does the baby get to decide?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel knelt next to the tub and grabbed a pink sponge. She reached out with her free hand and pulled Heather around so her back was up against the side of the tub in front of her. Heather tried to steel herself against the oncoming attack, but her body had already betrayed her. As the sponge came around to scrub her chest it found her nipples standing hard. Heather whimpered and tried to stifle a moan as the soft but still rather rough material of the sponge was dragged from nub to nub.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like some~one is enjoying her bath.&quot; Mel sang playfully. &quot;Don&#39;t worry baby, Nanny Mel will make sure this is the be~st bath you have ever had.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather was worried, but the feeling the sponge were giving her washed those worries out of her head. Mel brought her free hand around to tweak one of Heather&#39;s nipples while letting the sponge wander south. Heather tried desperately to keep her moaning quiet but as the sponge reached her throbbing clit they burst out in a gasp and echoed around the bathroom. She lost herself entirely as the sponge was dragged down, then back up her slit and began circling her clit. Mel laughed quietly in her ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh dear,&quot; she sang, &quot;this just will not do. A sponge is supposed to make you clean but from the sound of it you just seem to be getting dirtier. Perhaps we should play with your toys and try the sponge again after you&#39;ve calmed down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather saw the sponge bob to the surface as Mel released it. She watched helplessly as her friend reached for the toys on the side of the tub. Her eyes nearly leaped from her head at the sight of them. At first glance they seemed just like the ones on the other side of the tub that Derek used, just pink. But up close Heather could see that their shapes were a lot more phallic than any baby&#39;s bath toy had a right to be. Mel selected what looked to be a rubber octopus, but between its tentacles was suction cup-like cavity that didn&#39;t look like it was meant to stick to the side of a tub. Her fears were confirmed when Mel gave it a squeeze an placed it firmly over one of Heather&#39;s nipples before releasing it. Heather squirmed as the rubber cephalopod caught her nipple and held it firmly, sucking it into its depths. She nearly screamed when Mel maneuvered the next toy into view. A submarine, but one with bumps and nodules that you would never find on a child&#39;s toy.<br />
<br />
&quot;DIVE! DIVE! DIVE!&quot; Mel called out playfully as she plunged the toy into the water. &quot;Helmsman, set a course for that cave!&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather tried to push herself away as Mel&#39;s arm moved towards her crotch again but her friend held her tight and there was no where to go. She tried to close her legs but just like in the park they didn&#39;t seem to want to obey her. She sat helplessly as she felt the blunt nose of the &#39;sub&#39; bump up against the entrance to her defenseless pussy before slipping in. In the real world Heather had a dildo. It wasn&#39;t that big, more of a novelty than anything else, but she did use it on occasion. The sub wasn&#39;t much bigger, but the textured surface was a far cry from the smooth plastic she was used to. She squealed loudly as it sank inch-by-inch into her depths.<br />
<br />
&quot;She cannae take anymore Cap&#39;ain!&quot; Mel cried out in a fake Scottish accent as she began pistoning the toy in and out of her friend.<br />
<br />
Heather couldn&#39;t. She came. Hard. The next 20 minutes were an orgasmic blur as her friend made her cum repeatedly. At one point the octopus was tugged off of her nipple with a pop and applied to the other one. Heather barely noticed as Mel was simultaneously fucking her with the long neck of a rubber plesiosaur, its bulbous head dragging itself along her passage with every thrust. Finally, when Heather felt like she would pass out entirely if she had to endure another drawn-out orgasm, the sponge suddenly returned. It was a welcome break from the plastic and rubber that had been assaulting her. Mel had to hold her limp body up so her head wouldn&#39;t sink below the surface while she carefully cleaned every inch of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;There we go little one.&quot; Mel soothed. &quot;Now you&#39;ll be all nice and clean for bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
She lifted the now compliant girl from the water and laid her onto a towel. She carefully dried her charge, rubbing her limp limbs with the softest towel Heather had ever felt. Once dried Mel wrapped her up in a massive blanket-sized towel and carried her to her room. Heather was too exhausted to resist while Mel lay her on the changing table and wrapped her up in a fresh diaper, just as thick as the others. She let her friend dress her in a thick footed sleeper and carry her to the crib. She accepted the pacifier without complaint when Mel presented it to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright sweetie,&quot; she whispered, &quot;Today was fun, but now we both need some sleep. I&#39;m going to go home now, but I&#39;ll be back tomorrow. If you still want to pretend when I get here then we can pick up where we left off. Though as much fun as that would be I am hoping that you&#39;ll want to be a teen tomorrow so we can go to the mall. There&#39;s this new shop I want to check out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel leaned down and kissed Heather on the forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good night. Sweet dreams. I&#39;ll be back in the morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel slipped from the room as Heather&#39;s worn out brain finally lost its grip and succumbed to sleep.</p>
