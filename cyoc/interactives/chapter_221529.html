<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Derrick communicated with his friends, letting them know what he was going to do, he ingested the formula that would cause his DNA to be exchanged with his brother Jack, Derrick hoped that with this his brother would feel what it was like to be despised by his family and by others. society, while he received what he felt should have been his from the beginning.<br />
After these events, 4 more days passed, and Derrick noticed that his brother Jack looked more like him every day, it was not that he looked alike, but that the exchange of lives and bodies between the two brothers was taking place, the same day that Derrick had ingested the DNA exchanger formula, his parents had decided to take a trip to celebrate their marriage anniversary and they left the two brothers alone, because they considered that they were old enough to take care of themselves.<br />
In those 4 days, Jack locked himself in his room because he didn&#39;t want people to see what was happening to him, his golden blonde hair was gone, his lean and muscular frame that made many guys envy was gone, even his biceps and triceps had disappeared, his muscular legs had lost their muscle, even his movie star face, these changes were happening to him, his hair was still blond but now it was much duller, acne began to appear on his face, he even felt that his Intellectual performance was going up and I didn&#39;t understand why. For Jack, the change was happening in relation to his sexual hormones, he had lost his sexual libido because he no longer masturbated frequently, even the change was happening with his own cock, it was getting smaller, and his balls were following suit.<br />
The opposite was happening with Derrick, with each passing day he became more and more like Jack, his skinny, thin and graceless physique was disappearing, until after dawn on the fifth day after having ingested the formula, Derrick woke up and looked at himself. in the mirror he almost screamed to heaven, because he wasn&#39;t looking at his body but his brother&#39;s body, his face that had previously had acme was now clean and handsome, his dull and graceless blonde hair had been replaced by a bright blonde hair, athletic and lively and his face looked like a movie star, his pale and weak torso, had disappeared and was replaced by a muscular torso full of pecs and abs, his arms that were thin before were now strong and muscular Full of biceps and triceps, his pale and skinny legs had disappeared and been replaced by longer, muscular and athletic legs, even his previously weak and soft voice was changed to a more manly and athletic tone.<br />
But the most notable change were his balls that were small before and were now as big as footballs and his penis that used to feel embarrassed by its size that used to measure 4 cm in a flaccid state now it measured 9 cm, not only that, Derrick al seeing himself totally like his brother, he felt a burst of hormones, imagining for the first time the big breasts of the most popular girl in school who sometimes came to his house to visit his brother, imagining the girl, he felt that his penis it hardened and stretched, when measuring it he discovered that his penis in an erect state measured 19 cm, he was going to continue examining himself when he heard the scream that came from his brother&#39;s room.<br />
Derrick stopped and dressed in his clothes, which placed on his brother&#39;s more developed and muscular body made him wear rags that were about to break.</p>
