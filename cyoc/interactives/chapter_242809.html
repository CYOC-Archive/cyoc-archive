<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After you&#39;ve spent ten more minutes under the watchful gaze of the two carnies without collapsing again, they visibly relax, and Roy lets out a big sigh. &quot;While I&#39;d still like you to remain seated for a bit longer, I think we can safely say that you&#39;re not in danger of losing consciousness any more - did you feel any different in the last few minutes?&quot;<br />
<br />
You state that you&#39;ve felt perfectly normal ever since you sat up, and you&#39;d be down for trying a few more things - as long as they don&#39;t involve making you directly transform someone else again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, good,&quot; Roy starts to turn away and sounds a bit distracted, &quot;If you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;ll continue inspecting myself after you changed me - Dave, would you please keep looking after her, especially if she tries to stand up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing, Doc.&quot; Dave chuckles to himself. &quot;Good thing it ended well, but holy shit, for being as smart as you are, that was some dumb shit you pulled there. So, do you feel like standing up yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod, and Dave holds out his arm for you to lean on, just in case. You stand up, but all you feel is a bit of nervousness - it seems like getting blasted with that high-energy ray gun really fixed your problems - in fact, you even feel a bit better than before you arrived!<br />
Still, you don&#39;t want to jump to conclusions, so you don&#39;t do much more than just taking a few slow steps for now.<br />
<br />
A few minutes pass, and Roy is done inspecting himself, and now asks you to describe your experience in detail - you tell him about the heavy wave of fatigue that overcame you, how your vision started to go black before you sat down, and how the ray gun&#39;s effect just felt great on your fur, as well as how it seemed to restore your energy even beyond where you were at before the incident.<br />
<br />
The researcher adopts a thinking pose. &quot;Interesting - I&#39;d like to do further tests to see further effects of morphogenic rays on you - it&#39;s obvious that you still need to eat, otherwise you wouldn&#39;t have done so yesterday - but it&#39;d be interesting to know whether it&#39;d be possible to substitute sleep, or at least coffee, that way. Definitely not doing any of that today - in fact, just in case the energy turns out to be stimulants instead of genuinely restoring your energy, please try to slowly put some strain on your body and tell us how you feel - if you&#39;re able to keep this up for an extended amount of time, this should be evidence of it actually restoring your energy reserves. We&#39;ll stay nearby to monitor your vitals, and catch you in case you collapse again.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod, and while Dave looks a bit cross, he only tells you to take things easy, and then you&#39;re off, power-walking along the room&#39;s walls.<br />
After completing a few laps, you start walking faster every so often, until you&#39;re jogging, and later on even running the same laps.<br />
Dave tried to keep up with you, but somewhere between your tenth jogging lap and the first few ones where you&#39;re properly running, he taps out and you&#39;re left to your own devices, so you run a few more laps and finish with a sprint along the long side of the room before you return to the two guys.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fantastic! Your vitals show no indication of this being anything but a regular workout, so it&#39;s likely you&#39;ve had your energy restored. For now, please sit down again and take another ten-minute break, just in case, but if you still feel fine afterward, I&#39;d like to continue with some of the tests I had planned today - mostly centered around your interaction with various transformative effects.&quot;<br />
<br />
You sit down. &quot;Sure, I still feel fine, so let&#39;s continue then!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ten more minutes pass, and your pulse returns back to normal, but you feel unchanged otherwise, so you go straight back to testing - first on the list, checking if your unique transformation effects interfere with the ray guns - predictably, this isn&#39;t the case, otherwise pretty much everyone you zapped after your first match would&#39;ve run into some kind of issue turning back, but Roy was the only one that got zapped without a gun being involved, so he wanted to double-check his assumptions.<br />
<br />
Next, you&#39;re told to hold a weird, foreign-looking amulet, and read off a strange chant from a slip of paper. The amulet glows and starts to feel warm in your hands, but aside from that, nothing happens.<br />
You&#39;re exposed to a few more items of similarly dubious nature, from an stage magician&#39;s hat and wand to a greenish liquid in a flask labeled &quot;Magick Potion&quot;, but the effects are always the same - you feel slightly warm wherever the items touch you, and maybe react to their physical properties, like the potion tasting like swamp water, but otherwise there&#39;s no effect.<br />
<br />
Roy sums up what you all think: &quot;I believe we can conclude that your absorption works regardless of the employed transformation vector - we&#39;ll need to return these items to their owners by tomorrow, but this has been a big help. However, all these have in common that their morphogenic attributes have been determined to be of a similar intensity to that of our regular ray guns, so next, I&#39;d like to test whether a change in energy density would produce different results - first off, low energy settings.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roy goes over to the oversized gun on the trolley and starts fiddling with it until its cooling fans quiet down significantly. You almost miss it, but shortly afterwards, a weak light appears from its muzzle, which quickly gets focused to a point, and aimed at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-hey, that tickles - stop it!&quot;<br />
It is a strange feeling - you can still feel where the rays hit you, but instead of the warm, tingling feeling you usually get, it&#39;s more like something barely brushed over your fur - maybe a feather, or a blade of grass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Apologies, this setting practically requires prolonged exposure to produce any visible effects, but feel free to move around so the beam hits you in a more comfortable spot.&quot;<br />
<br />
You try a few options, and come to the conclusion that your joints probably are the best option, so you ask Roy to aim down at your knees, which he does.<br />
However, besides the ticklish feeling slowly turning into an itch, nothing else happens, and you gladly scratch your knee after the beam is turned off again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, so for the next test, I&#39;d like to use focused high-energy beams - you&#39;ve experienced higher energy levels back when you got hit with the diffuse setting on the floor, but now I&#39;d like to increase the intensity even more by bundling them all in one spot. However, since you&#39;ve consistently described the beams as &#39;warm&#39;, I&#39;ll start at the level of our regular ray guns, and slowly increase the energy output so you&#39;ll have plenty of time to speak up if it becomes uncomfortably hot.<br />
<br />
&quot;You might want to monitor her vitals again too!&quot;, Dave shouts from behind you. Apparently he has commandeered the chair you left when the tests started, and is now lazing around in it.<br />
From the way he looks right now, it wouldn&#39;t surprise you if he was munching on a bucket of popcorn the next time you checked on him, but he genuinely didn&#39;t have anything to do since the tests started again, so it&#39;s somewhat understandable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great point, Dave!&quot;, Roy answers, then looks back at you. &quot;Alright, are you ready to start the high-energy testing run?&quot;<br />
<br />
You give him a thumbs up, and he quickly starts fiddling with the gun again while announcing various parameters - not that they meant anything to you - and starts hitting you with a constant beam, pausing to look at your readouts, and then increasing the output while keeping the beam pointed straight at your belly.<br />
This time, it&#39;s much easier to see the beam, and you also feel the familiar warm, tingling sensation you&#39;ve come to associate with the various ray guns, but even after the beam gets bright enough that looking directly at it strains your eyes, it still feels pleasant to you - no longer like a warm, tingling feeling, and more like a nice, hot whirlpool, but definitely not uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Proceeding to maximum output.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roy changes the settings one last time, turning up the beam to the point it actually hurts to look at, and the feelings still increase in intensity, but aside from being borderline uncomfortable, you don&#39;t have any complaints - in fact, after a few seconds, the feeling starts to spread across your whole body instead, diminishing in intensity as it spreads out.<br />
You tell Roy as much, and he decides to keep the gun pointed at you for a bit longer to see if anything changes, but you don&#39;t notice anything else happening, and eventually he turns the machine off again.<br />
<br />
Roy starts scribbling away in his notebook again while muttering about how the entire test produced no visible changes, when you hear Dave snicker behind you. You turn around to face him, and he actually managed to find some kind of dry, crunchy snack to chew on, but the spots the bright light left in your eyes make him somewhat hard to see - his head is somewhat low, maybe he decided to sit on the floor instead?<br />
You blink a few times to clear your vision, but he remains where he is, weirdly close to the floor, and still seated in his chair, almost if-<br />
<br />
Your look of realization must&#39;ve been obvious, because Dave grins up at you and interrupts your thoughts: &quot;Well, don&#39;t keep me in suspense - how&#39;s the air up there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Roy must&#39;ve looked up at his words, because you hear a surprised gasp from behind you, followed by some more excited exclamations, but you&#39;re currently busy comparing your new size with other things in the room. From your very unscientific guesses, you&#39;ve grown to about a height of seven feet, but interestingly enough, your breasts and rear stayed the same size - still oversized in comparison to what you&#39;d expect to see on a normal woman of your size, but not significantly so.<br />
Additionally, your muscles seem to be more pronounced than before - that is to say, you can actually make some of them out now, which definitely wasn&#39;t the case before.<br />
<br />
Roy still is shouting excitedly, and it seems he wants to get your attention, and at the same time, Dave also has come closer again - maybe you should finish self-inspecting and find out what they want?</p>
