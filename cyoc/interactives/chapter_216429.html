<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Axel’s dick was still hard, bobbing big and free in the air in front of him when he got to gym class.<br />
<br />
He got some looks, but the wolf only had eyes for TJ. The nerd was licking his pits and it made Axel’s cock twitch. Axel desperately wanted to nuzzle him, but Austin and Jeremy wouldn’t approve.<br />
<br />
“Nice cock, Axel!” A kid from his class said. “Wish I could suck it!”<br />
<br />
“Back off human,” Jeremy growled, “Alpha cock is for pack members only!”<br />
<br />
“Love that dick, big boy!” A group of cheerleaders called as they passed by.<br />
<br />
Axel blushed, his hard cock leaking, but he was feeling much less subconscious about it and completely forgot he was naked by the time they reached the gymnasium.<br />
<br />
Coach Silver was at his desk in his office when the three wolves walked in. Assistant Coach Higgins was under the desk, the little fox bobbing on the older coyote’s fat shaft. Axel couldn’t help but be a little jealous at how lovingly the fox suckled on the old coyote’s cock.<br />
<br />
For some reason, Axel thought they should be humans, but that was silly, they’d always been this way!<br />
<br />
”Coach Higgins has great head game,” Jeremy commented, eyeing the the canines with more than a little jealousy in his voice.<br />
<br />
“That’s why we need a beta,” Axel said in a sing-song voice, tapping TJ on the head.<br />
<br />
“Oh, but can’t we find a cuter one?” Austin whined.<br />
<br />
“We don’t know how he’s going to turn out,” Axel said.<br />
<br />
He wasn’t sure how he knew that, but he did. Some people turned into wolves, some into lesser canines after The Bite. The odds of TJ being a subby wolf and not just a fox or a coyote or a dog was low. They were all considered part of The Pack, but it was a very hierarchical culture.<br />
<br />
Personally, Axel wasn’t down with discrimination, but it was literally ingrained behaviour, he couldn’t avoid it.<br />
<br />
He let TJ go get dressed while the three wolves went out into the gym proper and waited with the human students for the teacher to get finished up.<br />
<br />
“Hey boys!” Coach Silver trotted out, Higgins scampering behind him to keep up.<br />
<br />
“Hello Coach Silver!” Axel smiled.<br />
<br />
Coach Silver stood in front of the class.<br />
<br />
“Alright kids, today we’re playing dodgeball today!”<br />
<br />
The class cheered.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Remember the five D&#39;s of dodgeball: dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge!&quot; Coach Silver bellowed.<br />
<br />
“Okay guys, let’s have…Jerry,” Mr. Higgins pointed to a tall, athletic kid with dark hair, “And, hmmm…Adam!” He pointed at a short, muscular kid. “You two are the Team Captains. Go ahead and choose who you want on your team.”<br />
<br />
They started choosing teams.<br />
<br />
Austin and Jeremy were immediately chosen by Jerry. <br />
<br />
“We let you choose us.” Jeremy said. “But now you have to take Axel and TJ.”<br />
<br />
“Ugh, do we HAVE to have Axel and TJ on our team?” Jerry whined.<br />
<br />
“Our Alpha is on our team.” Jeremy said in a tone that brooked no arguments.<br />
<br />
“And the fat kid is on trial. He comes with us.” Austin said.<br />
<br />
Axel’s face reddened as he heard Jerry complain about him. <br />
<br />
He wasn’t useless! But it was rather telling that neither Adam nor Jerry had chosen himself or TJ. Instead, they ended up picking all the girls first. He tried to reason the decision out. Maybe…he knew that TJ and Axel were auto-adds so he was choosing other people first?<br />
<br />
But if that were true, why hadn’t either of them fought over TJ and Axel?<br />
<br />
Honestly, if it were Axel, and he were the team captain of the opponent’s team and he heard that, he’d instantly pick TJ and Axel, just to force Austin and Jeremy to bail out. It was the smart play. But…he had a feeling with the way the kids were acting that it wasn’t about making a msart play.<br />
<br />
“Oh look, the losers are last,” Adam sneered, “You can take the scraps, Jerry.”<br />
<br />
Some of the class tittered. TJ was red as a tomato and Axel could feel his own cheeks burning. He was an Alpha, right? Who the fuck were they to mock him?<br />
<br />
Jeremy looked thunderous, but said nothing as TJ and Axel trotted over to Jerry’s team.<br />
<br />
“You two better not be dead weight.” Jerry admonished them as they got in line. “I only picked you because Jeremy and Austin are good.”<br />
<br />
“Sorry Alpha, but I can’t hurt him in public,” Jeremy grumbled.<br />
<br />
“It’s fine,” Axel growled.<br />
<br />
They took their places along the backs of the gymnasium, both teams facing eachother. Higgins and Silver tossed balls in the middle of the arena. <br />
<br />
“Stay back and try catching balls if you can’t run fast enough to scoop them up and throw,” Axel advised TJ.<br />
<br />
“Got it,” TJ smiled, then whispered, “How did you know?”<br />
<br />
“About…?” Axel’s eyes went wide, “Oh! I, uh, walked in on you when your browser was open.”<br />
<br />
“Oh,” TJ blushed.<br />
<br />
Coach Silver raised the whistle to his lips.<br />
<br />
Axel looked across the gym at his opponents. They were all primed and ready to sprint for the balls. Next to Axel, Jeremy and Austin were in sprinting position. He took a breath.<br />
<br />
Coach Silver blew his whistle.<br />
<br />
It was louder and sharper to his ears than Axel had anticipated, and startled him into a sprint. Wait, he wasn’t supposed to get into that chaotic fray! But it was too late, he was lagging behind Austin and Jeremy, but he might make it to the balls before Adam did.<br />
<br />
It was a close thing.<br />
<br />
Jeremy and Austin were fast and had two balls each, but they were forced to throw them fast, hitting a few of the faster guys on Adam’s team. Unfortunately, they missed one-Adam himself. He dove for a ball and tossed it at Austin’s paw.<br />
<br />
With a yelp, the wolf was out.<br />
<br />
Axel reached his ball and quickly threw it at Adam.<br />
<br />
Adam dodged, then tossed a ball at Axel.<br />
<br />
Axel tried to catch it but it hit his paw and flew up over his shoulder.<br />
<br />
He sighed, ready to be called out-<br />
<br />
“Safe!” Silver called, pointing behind Axel.<br />
<br />
Axel glanced behind him and saw TJ holding the ball.<br />
<br />
“Adam is out.” SIlver said.<br />
<br />
“Do we get someone back?” Jeremy asked.<br />
<br />
“No. Axel just doesn&#39;t get out.” Silver replied.<br />
<br />
Balls flew back and forth as the first of the games continued. <br />
<br />
Axel found he was actually getting good at throwing the balls. It wasn’t just the speed of his throws, but the accuracy. There was a trick to it, too. Throw too hard or at the wrong angle, and the ball ricocheted. If he threw the ball too slow, and the person might catch it.<br />
<br />
Behind him, TJ was getting really good at catching stray balls.<br />
<br />
TJ was far back enough that people weren’t targeting him but not so far that he could catching bounces or bad throws. He was using his soft body as a cushion to soften the impacts. Axel was kinda impressed, thanks to TJ, they were still in the game. <br />
<br />
The enemy team, of course, was targeting down Jeremy and Austin as soon as they were brought back. It was getting to be an uphill battle. Axel hadn’t thought a team with three wolves on it could possibly lose-he’d seen how fast Austin and Jeremy were. And yet, their team was dwindling.<br />
<br />
Eventually, someone hit TJ on the side of his leg while he was catching another ball.<br />
<br />
It was down to Axel and Adam.<br />
<br />
They threw, balls collided, they ran for more balls, tossing them at each other. Axel was dodging as best he could, but his reflexes weren’t quite up to snuff. Eventually, Adam scored a hit and the game was over.<br />
<br />
“Adam’s team wins!” Coach Silver whistled. “Alright boys and girls, get back in there. We have time for another round.”<br />
<br />
“Hey, Alpha, guess your pack sucks!” Adam sneered. “That’s what you get for looking down on us humans.”<br />
<br />
“Fuck you Adam!” Jeremy growled.<br />
<br />
“Aw, what are you gonna do about it, puppy? You strut around the school like your shit don’t stink, cocks out like utter degenerates. Led around by a weakling.” Adam spat. <br />
<br />
Adam’s teammates tittered behind him.<br />
<br />
Axel felt rage boil in his chest.<br />
<br />
There was movement by the doors and he glanced away, noticing his father slipping back into the lockerroom with Coach Higgins. When he looked back, Austin and Jeremy were at the line, growling and snarling at the human, who was just smirking. <br />
<br />
“Boys!” Coach Silver warned, “Back down!”<br />
<br />
Austin and Jeremy’s ruffs  were up but they obeyed, turning and stomping over to Axel. Adam watched them go with a gleam of triumph in his eyes.<br />
<br />
“We need to get you into the weight room, Alpha.” Jeremy snarled quietly.<br />
<br />
“Yes, he’s an ass but he has a point.” Austin agreed. <br />
<br />
Axel clenched his paws. “I’ll show them this round!”<br />
<br />
Everyone took their places.<br />
<br />
As soon as the whistle blew, Axel sprinted for the balls.<br />
<br />
He grabbed two and retreated from the line.<br />
<br />
“Where ya going?” Adam jeered. “Running awa-”<br />
<br />
Axel’s throw caught him straight in the mouth, knocking him on his ass.<br />
<br />
“Ah! You motherfucker!” Adam screamed, clutching his face. <br />
<br />
When Adam hurried over to Coach Silver and lifted his hand away from his face, Axel could see a tooth stick through his lip. He felt sick but also, strangely, excited and powerful.<br />
<br />
“Dude!” TJ said. “How’d you throw it that hard?”<br />
<br />
Axel shrugged, “I got angry.”<br />
<br />
He started firing the balls at the other team, sending more of his bullies to the out position and possibly to the nurse’s office. <br />
<br />
Each time someone yelped in pain as the ball struck them got Axel hotter and harder, his cock bobbing in the cool gym air, precum slicking the floor. Behind him, TJ was catching stray balls, bringing Jeremy and Austin back in. They were becoming a more cohesive team, the two wolves in front acting as a threat and a distraction, occasionally pegging a few people out, but basically letting themselves be used as meat shields.<br />
<br />
The feeling of being in a real, functioning pack was exhilarating to Axel.<br />
<br />
When he pegged Adam hard in the balls the next time he joined the game, Axel caught Coach Silver eyeing him with a look of approval. Coach…approved of him? It made blood rush to his cock, his penis straining in the air. Axel threw a fast curve into another of his former bully’s crotches and found himself laughing.</p>
