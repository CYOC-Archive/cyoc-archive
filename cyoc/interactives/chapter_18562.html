<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty looked around the living room and saw the deck of playing cards June used to play solitaire.  &quot;I think we're going to make this a game, Dustin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A game?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Ty said.  &quot;See that deck of cards?  I'll let you pick a few of them to get your development back, but puberty can be kind of random.  So for every diamond you draw, you'll grow as many inches taller as the card's value for blackjack.  For every spade, your dick will grow the same number of inches.&quot;  Ty mused.  &quot;Oh, and clubs will make you that many times hairier and hearts will make you ten pounds more muscular.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And aces are one or ten, my choice?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; said Ty.<br />
<br />
&quot;How many cards do I get?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As many as you want.  But once you turn them over, that's what happens to you, and whatever you get, that's what you're stuck with.  And you won't complain, because you'll think that's the way you always were, and so will everyone but me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if I draw a joker?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty thought.  &quot;A joker?  You get to change one thing about yourself not covered by the regular cards: your hair color, eye color, whatever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin looked at himself, calculating.  &quot;I might not draw any of some if I take too few.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; said Ty.<br />
<br />
&quot;But if I take too many, I might get too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty grinned.  &quot;Welcome to puberty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin sighed.  &quot;Give me seven cards.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty nodded, shuffling the deck, then dealt seven to Dustin, who turned over the first one.  It was the five of diamonds.  At once, Dustin started to sprout up, rapidly filling out his clothes until he was almost back to his old height, sprouting from 5'3&quot; to 5'8&quot; but still as muscularly and sexually underdeveloped as he was at thirteen.<br />
<br />
Ty grinned up at him.  &quot;Still a couple inches shy, but you still have more cards.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin nodded, turning over the next, the nine of diamonds.  He sprouted taller and taller, rapidly overtaking his old height and surpassing it, finally stopping at 6'5&quot;, but still as underdeveloped as a thirteen year old.  A really big thirteen year old, with his arms and legs sticking out several inches from his too-tight clothes.<br />
<br />
Dustin looked nervously at the cards.  &quot;Height's okay now.  Hope I get a dick...&quot;  He turned over the next card, the four of diamonds, and immediately sprouted up to 6'9&quot;  Dustin stared at himself.  &quot;Were these things shuffled.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; said Ty.  &quot;Welcome to puberty.  Never know what you get.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin sighed, leaning down even further from his huge height and turned over his fourth card, the eight of spades.  With a jolt, his former three-inch dick grew rapidly down the leg of his too-tight pants until it reached eleven inches.  Dustin reached inside of his pants, feeling with an expression of both joy and wonderment.  &quot;Oh thank god,&quot; he breathed.  &quot;I'm hung again.  My dick actually matches my height.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty grinned.  &quot;You still have three cards left.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin nodded.  &quot;Yeah.  Here's hoping for muscles now...&quot;  He flipped over the next card, revealing the ten of hearts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lucky,&quot; Ty remarked as a hundred pounds of muscle began to inflate Dustin's lanky frame, tearing him clothing as he expanded.<br />
<br />
Dustin gasped and looked at himself, running his fingers along his chest and biceps.  &quot;Can I stop here?  There isn't any hair, but that's okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty shook his head.  &quot;Nope.  Puberty is puberty.  Have to take the last two cards you were dealt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hesitantly, Dustin flipped over the next card, revealing the ace of spades.<br />
<br />
Ty looked at him and grinned.  &quot;What's it going to be?  One more inch of cock, or ten more inches?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin felt in his pants.  &quot;A foot long, or twenty-one inches?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin bit his lip.  &quot;I'd make a fortune as a porn star.  Make it ten.&quot;<br />
<br />
At once, his cock started snaking down, reaching past his knee inside his jeans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Last card,&quot; Ty said.<br />
<br />
Dustin nodded, leaning down and flipping over the ten of spades.  &quot;Oh fuck,&quot; he said as his cock continued to grow down his leg, finally reaching thirty-one inches.  It would have drug the ground if he weren't already 6'9&quot;  He looked at Ty.  &quot;Can I make that ace back into a one instead?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't in blackjack,&quot; Ty said, &quot;but sure.  So long as you draw one more card.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin nodded readily as his dick withdrew to a still amazing twenty-two inches.  Ty dealt him one more card and said, &quot;When you flip that over, you get what you get, and you forget all about me changing you and the game we've just played.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Dustin said, reaching for the card and flipping over the seven of clubs.  At once, his body hair began to multiply, growing thicker and thicker as his beard came in and then some.<br />
<br />
Dustin paused, rubbing his hairy jaw, then scratching his hairy chest, then looking down at Ty.  &quot;Okay, so what's the magic card trick?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; said Ty, looking up at his huge and hairy step brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's the magic trick?  I haven't seen anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty grinned.  &quot;Just draw one more card.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin shrugged, reaching for the deck and turning over the king of diamonds.  At once he sprouted up, his clothes shredding as he hit his head on the ceiling fan.  &quot;Ow,&quot; said the now 7'7&quot; Dustin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Want another card?&quot; Ty asked gleefully.<br />
<br />
Dustin rolled his eyes.  &quot;This is really lame.  I don't see any magic trick.&quot;  He reached down with his huge hairy hand and flipped over one more card, the queen of diamonds.  He hit his head on the ceiling, then the 8'5&quot; giant said, &quot;I don't think you shuffled this deck very well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe not,&quot; Ty said.  &quot;Draw one more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin did, the jack of hearts.  A hundred pounds of muscles soaked in and inflated his gigantic frame.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, they look shuffled,&quot; Ty said.  &quot;Sometimes odd things do happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin shook his head.  &quot;What would be odd is you getting even a tenth of the puberty I got.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty grinned.  &quot;And it's probably not over.  This is,&quot; he said, &quot;um, fortunetelling.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Ty.  &quot;Draw a few more cards and I'll tell you how much you've still got to grow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; said Dustin.  &quot;That would be a trick.  Not even the doctors have been able to figure my growth spurt out.&quot;  He looked at the deck.  &quot;How many cards do I draw?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How many years do you want to look at?  Each card will tell me what will happen to you the next year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Dustin said, &quot;what's going to happen to me from now until I'm twenty?  Is this freaky-ass growth spurt going to slow down?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty waved to the deck.  &quot;Draw a card to see what happens to you next year, when you turn seventeen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin reached out and turned over the seven of spades.<br />
<br />
Ty grinned.  &quot;Next year you're not going to get any taller, but your dick's going to grow seven inches.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin looked at the cards, then said, &quot;If my dick wasn't almost two feet long already, I'd say you were completely whacked, but I'd hardly be surprised at this point.  And when I'm eighteen?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty waved to the deck and Dustin turned over the jack of diamonds.  &quot;You'll grow another ten inches taller,&quot; Ty said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; said Dustin.  &quot;I'll finally beat Robert Wadlow to be the world's tallest man.  What about when I'm nineteen?&quot;  He flipped over the next card, revealing the six of spades.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your dick will grow another six inches.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; Dustin said.  &quot;And when I'm twenty?&quot;  He flipped over one more card, the nine of spades.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your dick grows another nine inches,&quot; Ty said.  He peeked at the next card.  The ace of hearts.  &quot;But on the plus side, when you're twenty-one, you'll have a good chance to build up some muscle, if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin sighed.  &quot;Well, it makes as much sense as anything...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty said, &quot;Yeah, but it will be okay, 'cause you'll be a famous basketball star.&quot;</p>
