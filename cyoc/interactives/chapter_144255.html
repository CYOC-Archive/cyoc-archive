<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Max woke up in a bed. He instantly shot up straight. He looked around him, he was in a wooden room with two other beds next to him. He saw a man with a dark red coat walk out, the man was about as tall as Max’s hip. He also had a giant bushy beard. His hair was covered by a metal helmet. This was odd. He looked at the bed next to him, it was empty. Perhaps that where the man, or dwarf slept. Next to that was the second bed. In it was a milk white man with red markings over his face. He couldn’t see his eyes but noticed that he had four arms. Max jumped out of bed and nearly fell over as the floor was much further away than it previously was. He looked at his arms. His muscles had grown exponentially. His hair was no longer in his eyes and was cut shorter. His hair was also now pitch black. He walked (stumbled) over to a mirror and looked at himself.<br />
<br />
Max was a true hunk of a man. His muscles were bigger than his neck. He was incredibly masculine with his features. He didn’t focus on it until the last moment but his package was also increased by a lot. Before he could have a real in-depth look at himself. Something touched him on the shoulder. He turned around to see a woman with red skin. Her teeth were pointed and her hair was as black as Max’s. Her attire was a ragged green suit. It looked to have been worn for many days straight. She had three breasts. It looked quite awkward as he stared at them confused.<br />
“I’m going to take that and leave it,” she said with a hissing voice, “you told me last night that you can’t remember anything, we already went over it,” <br />
“I’m sorry,” Max said in a deep, manly voice, “I’m confused, I was just at a table looking at a box—”<br />
“Okay, great, so please leave as I’ve let you stay here for free and you’re looking at my breasts,”<br />
“Thank you, I think”<br />
“That’s right,” she said clapping sarcastically,<br />
<br />
Max seemed to have pissed her off, he tried not to think of her three breasts. He instead thought about his friends and how to find them.<br />
<br />
He walked into and around many stores, until he came across a pub. He walked inside and saw many creatures. A goblin, a halfling, an elf.. ‘hold on,’ Max thought, ‘The halfling and the elf seemed oddly familiar in a strange way,’<br />
<br />
He approached them, they looked at him in the same way that he looked at them. Then it clicked.<br />
<br />
“Jenna?? Greg??”<br />
“Max??” Said the Elf,<br />
“Wait is it you,” Said the Halfling,<br />
<br />
Max pieced this together, Greg was a halfling, Jenna was an elf.<br />
<br />
—:— A  FEW  HOURS  EARLIER —:—<br />
<br />
Springing out of bed, Greg and Jenna awoke to the sound of rattling. They looked down and noticed that they weren’t in bed, they were in the woods. Jenna got up, Greg fell back asleep, “Typical,” Said Jenna to herself. She noticed a change in her voice. She looked down and saw a silk top. Her face felt longer, she touched her ears, they were pointed upwards. She was an elf. She was older as well. Her breasts were the same size, maybe a tad bigger. Her height was increased to 6 foot 5. She looked to see if her brother had changed. Indeed he had. He was so much shorter than her that he’d have to look up to her. His body wasn’t stumpy, but it was small. The only big thing on him was his feet. They barely stuck out the blanket. He had a little fuzz on his chin. He was an adult as well. They were both thin. But seeming that they were completely different races, she guessed that they were no longer biologically related.<br />
She kicked Greg’s foot with her how slim legs. He woke up again. He looked at himself in horror. They needed a mirror to get a real view of themselves. So they headed to the nearest place. A pub.</p>
