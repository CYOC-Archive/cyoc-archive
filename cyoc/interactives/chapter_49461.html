<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the heavy pounding of Mark’s feet faded away as he went downstairs, Amy reached her hands around her ass – her hips seemed wider – and felt her ass. She was startled to find that her butt cheeks were coated in a thick, coarse fur.<br />
<br />
“God, I’m growing fur!” she said to herself.<br />
<br />
Then an annoyance of something between her butt cheeks caused something, also hairy, to brush against her hands that grasped her cheeks. Almost too afraid to look, she finally swung her head around to look at her ass. Sub-consciously her tail rose up in the air to present itself to her as she saw it for the first time.<br />
<br />
“Shit! Not a tail! No no no!”<br />
<br />
Amy grabbed onto it, a part of her hoping it wasn’t real, but as she stroked its length down to the hairy tufted tip of dark brown hair that matched her own hair on her head, she knew that wasn’t the case. She let go of it as her eyes glanced at her ass. The same coarse white fur of a cow covered her ass and had spread up to the middle of her back. Wrapping around one of her butt cheeks was a patch of black fur that signified her becoming a true dairy cow.<br />
<br />
Her curiosity got the better of her as she began to explore herself further, a sickening feeling building in her stomach. She turned towards the full length mirror in the corner of the room and started to walk over to it, however she quickly found that walking had become much more difficult. As she took a step she heard a popping sound and felt it in her hips. They were beginning to widen with each gentle step she took towards the other side of the room. With each pop of her hips, her udder began to settle down in between her legs more, making it even more difficult to walk. Her walk was becoming more like a waddle with the heavy sack that nestled itself warmly between her legs. Amy's thighs were also becoming thicker with muscle to accommodate the weight of her udder. She finally stopped trying to move and wrapped her left arm around her udder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh!&quot; she quietly exclaimed to herself with some disgust as she lifted up the udder so she could close her legs a little. She didn't want Mark to hear her because she knew if he did, he'd be back up here in no time and she just couldn't bear the tempting smells he was putting out right now. They had to stay focused.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't believe this is happening,&quot; she said as she more easily made it over to the mirror. &quot;What the hell did that thing do to me? What are we gonna do? I cannot stay like this!&quot;<br />
<br />
A million questions circled around in her mind as to what was going to happen to them. Was there a way to reverse the effects? Were they going to be stuck as partial cows the rest of their lives? Or worse, were they going to further turn into cows? Amy looked the front of herself over in the mirror, touching herself occasionally, reminding her this was indeed really happening. Touching herself began to feel good though. The warmth of her udder between her legs felt...cozy. Not to mention the sensation of when she ever so slightly rubbed it. <br />
<br />
She turned so she could see her profile in the mirror. She looked normal from her waist up, but below that was gut wrenching. Her now nicely proportioned udder of a mid-sized dairy cow bulged out from its nesting place between her legs, the teats standing out at attention from Amy's touching and the cool air conditioning circulating the room. Her thighs were thick and muscular and the white and black spotted fur had engulfed her thighs and ass, tapering off around her knees, although she could see hints of white growing out of the backs of her calves. Her mind began to wonder again...<br />
<br />
&quot;Calves,&quot; she thought to herself in a slight daze. &quot;We've always wanted a calf... No! A baby! I've always wanted a sweet, smooth, little baby.&quot; But she began to taper off again.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I need Mark. I need his big, throbbing, hairy dick to fill me up. I'll get big for months and my udder will fill up, but it'll be okay. It'll be worth it when I push a beautiful, hairy little calf out of my ass...My ass!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;God! What is wrong with me! Ugh! Disgusting!&quot;<br />
<br />
She snapped back out of her animalistic trance, her hands on her hairy ass. It had grown in size, more closely resembling a true cow's ass. She ran her hands around each cheek and began to spread them open, feeling how much thicker they had gotten. As Amy spread her butt cheeks open she instinctively began to lean her torso forward to push her ass out as if she were presenting it to someone. Her tail reflexively raised up in the air to grant passage to her damp, furry crevice. She began to feel the cool air conditioning on her exposed anus and turned it more toward the mirror. Amy swung her head so her smooth, dark brown hair came to rest on her back as she peered over her shoulder to look in the mirror.<br />
<br />
What she saw made her gasp in disgust. Her asshole was no longer buried between her ass cheeks, but rather protruded prominently out from her ass, just below her tail. Her skin down there had turned black and her once hidden asshole was now a swollen, donut-like, protrusion that puckered out toward the mirror. And it was much larger than before. Amy gently ran one of her fingers across it and then poked at it. The skin was tougher, more leathery in nature. At first she was hesitant, but some sort of sick, stimulating curiosity overcame her and she pushed her finger experimentally into her new asshole. Her finger quickly sank into the black depth, a warmth spreading into her hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugggggghhh,&quot; she moaned. She jammed a couple more fingers in, realizing they would go in with ease. She suddenly stopped though when she was tempted to shove her whole hand into her rear end and yanked her fingers out of herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a cow's asshole. Ugh, it's... big.&quot; She thought for a moment. &quot;Oh God! It's for pushing out cow patties. No! There's no way I'll ever shit that much out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy was getting a tad too warm and began feeling a wetness around her ass. She glanced down and saw that underneath her swollen asshole, was a gaping mass of vertical, black folds that had a shine, no a wetness to them. As she was bent over, with her ass presented to the mirror, the thick, meaty folds of dark skin were perfectly exposed below her equally exposed asshole. Amy realized in this position it was meant for quick, easy access...from behind. A shot of denial rushed over her and she quickly thrust one of her arms back around to the front to find her vagina. She accidentally slapped her udder in a frenzy, forgetting it sagged so low against her legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it!&quot; she grunted in aggravation. &quot;It's got to be down there. That can't be it back there!&quot;<br />
<br />
She reached further and slid her hand down underneath her udder and found the area between her legs. Finding the spot, she felt around, but there was no sign of where her vagina should have been. It was just a smooth abyss of skin where her udder sagged from her stomach and crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; she whimpered. &quot;Please no...&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy withdrew her hand and reached back around to her ass and looked back in the mirror. She looked at the dark, wet folds of her new vagina. She had never seen what a cow's vagina looked like before, but she knew she now had one. Amy fingered the thick folds. They were wet with a slightly sticky yet slick fluid. Her hand seemed small compared to the long opening that appeared to be made for accepting much larger objects to be inserted into it...into her. As her fingers drifted across the slick vaginal folds, she felt a dribble of fluid begin to seep out of her vagina as a warmth spread throughout her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooohhh, I'm getting horny,&quot; she moaned. <br />
<br />
Without giving it a second thought, just as she had experimented with her asshole, she slid her fingers into her vagina. However, she felt no tightness as she did with her asshole and all of her fingers slid in with ease. Amy's beautiful hazel eyes grew wider as her thighs tensed up and she instinctively began to pucker her vagina. The folds closed in around her hand and began drawing it into to her ass. Amy's hand completely slid into her vagina and it didn't stop there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uggghhh! It's...so...big!&quot; She was now wrist deep into herself, but she began to try and draw her hand back out. &quot;Why...is...it...so...huge?!&quot; she exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Mark can mount me and ram his big bull penis in me!&quot; her mind told her. &quot;There's plenty of room for him in me now!&quot;<br />
<br />
As her wetness grew, she could hear a slimy sucking noise every time she tried to pull her hand out of herself. All of a sudden she stopped trying to pull her hand out as a warmth unlike her horniness overcame her. It was a tickling that seeped into her vagina. She felt a rush of hotness engulf her hand that was lodged up her ass as she realized she had played with herself a little too much.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit!&quot; she realized what she was about to do. &quot;No! Not now! Shit!&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy straightened back up as best as she could and turned toward the bathroom on the other side of the room. She ran to the door as fast as she could with her hand still wrapped around her furry ass up into her vagina. Her udder sloshed against her hairy legs as she bolted for the bathroom. She got to the toilet, swung her ass around toward the  porcelain bowl and hurriedly yanked her slimy hand out of her vagina. She didn't even have time to sit down as piss sprayed out of her large vagina into the toilet, although instinctively, her tail lifted itself out of the way at attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmmm!&quot; she moaned in relief as she aimed best as she could.<br />
 <br />
Amy's piss splashed into the toilet as she relieved herself, spraying out of her rear end not unlike how a cow would piss in a pasture. Though her aim was decent considering her new cow genitalia and its awkward new position, she still made a mess on the floor. As her stream tapered off as she finished, the last dribbles adding to the yellow puddle on the floor, Amy's tail spasmed a bit and finally relaxed, hanging down between her butt cheeks again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh thank God,&quot; she said with relief. She turned around to look at the mess she had made. She felt like she was going to cry. &quot;What's happening to me? I'm...I'm losing control. Why am I starting to act like a cow?&quot; But Amy gained her composure and wiped a tear away from her eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have GOT to fix this!&quot;</p>
