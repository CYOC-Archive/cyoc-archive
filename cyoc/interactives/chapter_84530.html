<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jon and Alexis go through the curtain and find themselves in a sterile looking room looking like a salon. There are comfortable chairs with tubs at the feet to one side and tanning beds off to the other. A group of auguste clowns are sitting around as two whitefaces approach the couple.<br />
&quot;Looks like two new recruits, ha ha. Are you two interested in some new noses and a body makeover?&quot; asks one of the whitefaces<br />
&quot;Yes, please&quot; replies Jon with excitement<br />
&quot;Ok, strip down and put on a robe&quot; She directs them to a collection of colorful robes hanging on the wall. <br />
Both comply and they gather up the clothes &quot;We will send these on to your hotel&quot;<br />
&quot;Why&quot; asks Alexis<br />
&quot;You want a new outfit to go with you faces, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes makes sense&quot; agrees Jon. Alexis felt a little nervous about losing their clothes but agreed.<br />
&quot;Ok, let’s get started&quot; the whiteface motions to the group of auguste who lead both of them over to the chairs and sit them down and make them comfortable.<br />
&quot;Nosegrapher&quot; one auguste asks and is handed an odd device with a tube attached<br />
&quot;This will measure your noses and give you an appropriate new one&quot; she explains as they place the devices over Jon&#39;s and Alexis&#39;s noses.<br />
Jon wondered why they needed a device to measure their noses, but he guessed the maybe they were using a 3d printer or something.<br />
A slight humming noise is emitted when the device is turned on and Jon and Alexis start to giggle as they feel their noses tickling. Meanwhile two clowns take off their shoes and socks and put them in the tub and poor in some pink goo and start to massage their feet. Both of them start to feel relaxed and sleepy and nod off for a little while under the ministrations of the auguste clowns.<br />
A ding wakes the two up. &quot;All done&quot; states an auguste clown. They remove the devices from their noses and Alexis sees a smudge of glittering pink on the bottom of her vision and feels a spark of excitement zip through her. She looks over at Jon and sees he now has a round red nose about the size of a golf ball. One of the clowns had them each a mirror and she sees that she now has a nose the size of a ping pong ball and it is pink and glittering. Both of them start to laugh in delight at them. Jon reaches up and rubs his nose and finds that it feels real and pleasure rolls through him like when Alexis rubs the head of his dick. <br />
&#39;Why does it feel like my real nose?&#39; Jon thinks to himself through the haze of pleasure from him rubbing the nose. He looks over at Alexis and finds a blissful look on her face as she rubs her new nose.<br />
&quot;Yes they can be a little sensitive, but most people find that a bonus. The augustes drain the tubs at their feet and with a shock they find their feet have grown. Both of their feet now are an average size 15. <br />
&quot;What the fuck happened to my feet? What is going on?&quot; Jon reaches up and tries to take off his new nose and finds that he can&#39;t, it hurts just like trying to take off his real nose. He looks over to Alexis and finds her looking at shock at her feet.<br />
&quot;Relax, all clowns have big feet, it makes you look funny. Ha, ha, ha&quot; The clowns around the couple laugh<br />
&quot;Now you just need to get into the tanning beds and you can get a nice tan to go with your faces&quot; One of the whitefaces directs the to the beds <br />
Jon and Alexis have had enough; Jon jumps up and grabs Alexis to get out of there but then falls flat on his face, not yet use to his new feet.<br />
&quot;Here lets us help you&quot; as two of the auguste bend down to help Jon up. Alexis whimpers in fear now trying to pull off her pink nose.<br />
Jon shakes the two clowns off &quot;Get the fuck away from me&quot; and then punches one of the clowns in the stomach. The punch causes a wave through the clown&#39;s stomach as it then bounces back, like hitting rubber. The stomach bulges with the force hitting Jon back and knocking him down. Dazed from the blow, the group of clowns help him up into tanning booth and shut the lid and turn it on. Jon starts to pound on the inside to get out.<br />
Alexis can&#39;t explain why her nose feels so good or why it hurts to try and remove it. She sees Jon get knocked down and put in the machine, fear rushes through her knowing that they would try for her next. She has to get out of here and get help; she waddles over to the curtain to get out and pulls it aside to find a brick wall.<br />
&quot;What the hell&quot; She follows the wall around and finds no end to it, she was trapped. She hears Jon’s pounding slowing down replaced by his moans of pleasure.<br />
Jon sees the lid close but is too late to stop it. He begins to pound on the lid as the lights come on blinding him. Tingles start to run through his skin sending jolts of bliss to his brain. He begins to blindly pound on the lid but the feeling becomes too much as he starts to moan, lost in a haze of ecstasy. He feels his nipples harden, looking down he sees them grow darker and larger eventually becoming red balls the size of gum drops. He reaches over and squeezes one and feels a shock of pleasure from it, both of his hands find his nipples and start to play with them. The tingles increase over his body and focus down around his cock, he feels himself becoming more aroused despite the circumstance. His dick fills to its full hard length, the head turning red and round. One of his hands reluctantly lets go of his nipple and slides down to his dick, running his fingers along its length and rubbing the head. He squeezes the head of his dick and finds the pleasure ten times what he normally feels and lets out a loud moan.<br />
&#39;This feels so good; I never want it to stop. I want to be a clown forever&#39; the thought runs across Jon&#39;s mind hitting the part that is rebelling against this. The part of his mind that is rebelling is getting smaller and weaker. The tingles peak as the timer dings and the lights go out. &quot;No&quot; yells Jon in protest but the clowns open the lid. Jon swings his legs over and sits up and finds his body is now the same lite pink as his face.<br />
&#39;This is crazy, I have to stop this&#39; whispers the corner of his mind<br />
&quot;This is great, I look so silly now&quot; Jon says looking over his body and feet. He stands up and hears Alexis yell his name and run into his arms.<br />
&quot;What did they do to you? What are they doing to us? I can&#39;t get out of here.&quot; cries Alexis<br />
Jon hugs Alexis feeling the tingles running through him and the silliness. &quot;Shh, it is ok Dotsy. Everything is going to be ok&quot; Jon whispers to Alexis as she hugs him tighter &quot;It feels so good and silly&quot; Alexis cries into his arms &quot;We&#39;ll love being clowns&quot; Jon tells Alexis who suddenly stops crying realizing what he is saying. She tries to jump backward but finds him holding her to tight. &quot;No, Jon listen, this isn&#39;t you&quot; He picks her up and puts in the bed &quot;You&#39;ll love this&quot; and smiles at her as a small tear runs out of his eye down his bright smiling face. The corner of his mind is screaming &#39;Don&#39;t do it&#39;, &#39;What are you doing to her&#39;, &#39;You can&#39;t do this&#39; but it is now just a whisper in the wind of his mind. Jon closes the top and the clown turns it on.<br />
<br />
Alexis starts to cry but no tears as she finds herself so happy. &#39;How could he do this&#39;, &#39;What are they doing to us&#39; the nights in the club see like a dream, the lights, music, fun, the feeling of freedom, being silly they were just having fun. Who knew that it would lead to this? They should have listened to the rumors about the island.  <br />
Her thoughts are interrupted by the tingling in her skin start to increase; she lets out an involuntary moan. The feeling runs up her breasts sending a shiver down her spine. The tingles focus on her nipples, she looks down at her peaks and sees her nipples lighted and become erect. Her nipples not only become erect but as she watches them grow hard they inflate like tiny balloons to pink balls the size of gumballs. <br />
She runs her hands over her breasts squeezing them and her nipples &quot;Oh, this does feel good.&quot; she moans<br />
She feels herself getting wetter as the tingles run over her body. The tingles flow downward focusing on her crotch she feels her pussy starting to drip. Pressure builds in her clit before releasing; she feels her clit pushing on her hood before it expands outward becoming a tiny pink ball. Running her hand through her bush she slowly spreads her lips before easily finding her target. A finger slowly rubs over it and a feeling of ecstasy runs up her spine as she arches her back and lets out a tiny squeak. Two fingers on either side begin to play with it as she feels the tingles across her body peak. &#39;This isn&#39;t so bad. Jimbo and her will have fun clowning around&#39; she can&#39;t remember anything left behind that would compete with this. Fantasies of Her and Jimbo pulling pranks and gags, doing magic shows the sound of laughter echoing through her, better than any sex before and nights of epic clown sex, his big clown cock going in and out of her pussy or mouth. A ding sounds, interrupting her, Jon opens the top and she jumps put and hugs him feeling his hard clown cock against her, his red round head rubbing her bush.<br />
&quot;Thank you, you were right. This feels so good.&quot; They both start to giggle. She stands on her toes, if she can just get her body over it, she could get it inside her.<br />
&quot;I look wonderfully silly&quot; she says with a laugh that is echoed from Jon<br />
&quot;You look beautiful&quot; Jon says as he embraces Alexis in a kiss<br />
The clowns break the two up with a feeling of disappointment from the two.<br />
&quot;Ok, now we can do your hair and give you some touch ups.&quot; she motions the two over to so chair with sinks. They laid their heads back and began to wash their hair. the water begins to wash away their old lives and memories. Jimbo feels them go and gives a cry of protest and tries to get up but is pushed back down under the water. The auguste clowns began to apply a sweet smelling liquid to their heads and then applying it to their public hair. Jimbo and Dotsy smiled and moan as the clowns worked the liquid in around their genitals. The new color filling their minds to with colorful memories of being clowns and clown skills like pie throwing and unicycle riding. They then placed dryers over the heads and set another timer. Jimbo and Dotsy close their eyes and enjoyed the tingling sensations that were coming from the top of their heads and between their legs. The timer eventually interrupted their enjoyment as the clowns turned off the dryers and helped them up. Jimbo and Dotsy stared into the full length mirrors, Jimbo had collar length blue hair parted on the side, Dotsy had purple hair done up in a bouffant style. They both looked down and found that the drapes matched the curtains.<br />
&quot;We look great, thank you&quot; exclaimed Dotsy<br />
&quot;You can go next door and pick out a new outfit&quot; one of the whitefaces offers<br />
&quot;Yes, thank you&quot; Jimbo responds<br />
All three of them move next door to a very large closet with all types of clothes, shoes and hats.<br />
&quot;I think these would be a good start&quot; She hands Jimbo and Dotsy some colorful underwear that they put on. Followed by some green pants and a yellow t-shirt for Jimbo and a purple and blue stripped dress for Dotsy. She then hands Jimbo a blue vest and a loud orange and purple polka dotted tie. Dotsy gets a pair of orange and purple polka dotted tights.<br />
&quot;I think it would look cute for you two to match&quot; <br />
Finally she had both of them a new pair of shoes, black and white checkered for Jimbo and a pair of red mary jane&#39;s for Alexis. The two looked and themselves in the mirrors, they were a bit shocked to see themselves but they looked like this their entire lives, right? Jimbo and Dotsy looked at each other suddenly unsure of themselves. A clown walked into the dressing roomed dressed like a angel.<br />
&quot;You two look great&quot; the clown said in greeting &quot;I needed some new clowns for my crew. So many clients want to be &#39;entertained&#39; by skilled clowns now days&quot;<br />
Jimbo and Dotsy stood there unsure what to say or do. &quot;It&#39;s ok I&#39;m postive you&#39;ll love it&quot; She drew a fistful of gold powder from her robe and blew it into their faces. Dotsy&#39;s and Jimbo&#39;s eyes go cross for a second as their IQs are lowered considerably, their faces took on a blissfully ignorant look. They lowered their eyes and assume a more submissive posture, the clown walked up and fitted both of them with collars and leashed before leading out into their new lives.</p>
