<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle entered the storeroom, looking around for whatever &quot;costume&quot; the clerk was talking about.  This back area was even worse than the front.  Packages were piled along the walls, with no semblance of order in how they were placed.  There were articles of clothing hanging from pallets of...horse feed?  How did this store even function?<br />
<br />
Upon closer inspection, Kyle noticed the leg of something near the back.  The rest was covered by a sheet, creating a misshapen lump that was barely recognizable as much of anything, though it was much larger than he&#39;d expected.  He yanked the dusty sheet from it to get a better look, but the cloud it kicked up caused a coughing fit.<br />
<br />
He looked down at the &quot;costume.&quot;  This was a mascot costume for some sort of cow-themed team, and it looked completely ridiculous.  It was a splotchy black-and-white body, made of some sort of felt meant to pass for fur at a distance.  The head was somewhat small for a mascot, but its mouth was wide open, clearly intended to allow its wearer to see through it.  It had a comically small shirt on, a green jersey that simply said &quot;go cows!&quot; on the back.  Of course, it had to be small in order to make room for its most notable aspect: the udder.<br />
<br />
This thing&#39;s udder was the largest part of the uniform, and why you&#39;d assumed this was a costume fit for a mascot.  It had to be large to be recognizable from a football field away, but did it have to be half the costume by itself?  It looked like it could easily hold a yoga ball, and Kyle couldn&#39;t imagine how a mascot would walk with that wireframe udder blocking both legs, much less avoid walking into any benches or seated players.<br />
<br />
The head was separate from the rest of the costume, and there was a large hole in the back that he could use to slip inside.  It was an unnaturally tall costume, but on closer inspection, Kyle realized it was using stilts to create digitigrade legs, almost like massive high heels with a wooden heel to lift the wearer further off the ground.<br />
<br />
He pondered the state of his curse.  Jennifer had specifically said &quot;clothes,&quot; and this thing wasn&#39;t clothes.  Heck, it was even wearing a shirt of its own.  And even if it did, this was designed for a human of some height, probably a male.  He&#39;d just be a regular guy afterward, and then he could put on those pants while going commando.  Maybe he could re-wear this, too.  He&#39;d have to pick something a bit more tasteful later, but this could make for a good stop-gap, or test.<br />
<br />
Of course, if it does have an effect on him, Kyle had no desire to become some hermaphrodite.  He took off the clothes that had made him Cindy, all the way down to his underwear.  After a few moments, Kyle reconsidered full-on nudity, but his hand began to burn when he tried to put them back on.  He silently cursed himself for forgetting the other half of his curse, and Jennifer for putting it on him, then started the process of getting into this silly cow costume.<br />
<br />
He slipped in one foot at a time, finding the udder gave him plenty of space to fiddle with the foot straps to anchor his feet into place.  Of course, it was designed to be used with shoes, but Cindy&#39;s shoes were already off.  The moderately thick ropes bit into his skin, but once he was done, he pulled himself out of the udder&#39;s open pocket.<br />
<br />
Kyle slipped an arm into each of the mascot&#39;s arms, finding Velcro loops meant to help his arms stay in place.  His hands were incapable of moving the costume&#39;s digits, but that wasn&#39;t necessary at the moment.  As he peeked out of the head-hole, Kyle spotted the mascot&#39;s head on the floor.  He briefly considered leaving it there, but it&#39;d be weird to take everything but the head and he wanted to see Beryl&#39;s reaction.  What&#39;s more, he really didn&#39;t want people to see his face while he was in this ridiculous outfit, regardless of who they saw him as.<br />
<br />
Using his arms as best he could, he fumbles the cow&#39;s head over his own, until he felt a click as the mask connected to the body.  He felt like a complete idiot in this costume, but it hadn&#39;t changed him at all.  It was even large enough to prevent Cindy&#39;s breasts from being squeezed, though that didn&#39;t exactly help out with their bounciness.  Maybe he could find some gauze or tape to wrap his breasts into place.<br />
<br />
Kyle looked around the messy storeroom for anything that could work, then took an experimental step.  As he did, a strange pain shot through his foot.  Had he not bound his foot correctly?  It didn&#39;t feel like that, and Kyle&#39;s dread increased when the pain started moving up his leg.  <br />
<br />
In an instant, Kyle&#39;s body ignited in agony as every muscle strained and flexed beyond any limit that should have been.  He heard audible cracking as his arms, legs, and neck felt like they were being pulled from his torso, and his torso felt like someone had put a fire hose down his throat.  He toppled to the ground as his skin boiled, strangely cold compared to the hotness to the rest of his miserable form.  He grew disoriented as his world turned sideways and a blackness began to consume his vision.  He tried to scream, call for help, moan, anything, but his jaw was clenched and the most he could do was grind his teeth to relieve some of the pressure building within his skull.  Kyle slipped into unconsciousness as the pain continued to mount.<br />
<br />
*   *   *<br />
<br />
Kyle awoke, disoriented.  Everything felt wrong, and heavy.  He could barely recognize anything of what he was feeling, and he merely laid on the floor trying to perceive correctly.<br />
<br />
He swung an arm to the floor and heaved himself into a sitting position, trying to understand what day it was, where he was, and what he was doing.  He&#39;d...Jennifer had cursed him, he pretended to be his sister, then she made him become a...blonde girl?  It was all like a weird dream.<br />
<br />
This was a storage room, which he&#39;d gone into to pick up a cow costume.  He got into it, and then-!<br />
<br />
Kyle shot up, or tried to.  His body was way heavier than he expected, especially in the front.  He then realized something truly horrifying:  he wasn&#39;t looking through the mascot&#39;s mouth.<br />
<br />
He craned his neck downward, and was met with the view of a small muzzle and a sea of pink.  The He was looking through the mascot&#39;s actual eyes, but it no longer looked nearly as fake.  The felt-fur was looking more like real fur, and when he swung his arm into view, he saw flexing muscles beneath.  The curse had turned him into some sort of cow-creature!<br />
<br />
Kyle dropped his arm in disbelief, then felt another shock of pain when it squished into his gargantuan udder.  For being so over-sized, it was disturbingly sensitive, and more distressing was the sloshing fluid he felt within.  How much could this thing hold?<br />
<br />
He rolled his body over the massive udder, then used all four limbs to heave himself into a standing position.  While it looked awkward to move around before, adding half a ton of weight to the equation definitely made things so much worse.  He took a few shaky steps forward, only now realizing his legs ended in literal hooves, and were bent backwards like the mascot&#39;s legs had been.  Even with the additional height, the lower teats brushed the floor between each step.<br />
<br />
What&#39;s worse, his mind was being assaulted by foreign thoughts.  The smell of oats was making him hungry.  He felt a growing pressure from his udder. When he tried to focus on finding something to fix his problem, he would repeatedly begin thinking of sexual encounters.  While he was sure the mascot didn&#39;t have a vagina, this form most certainly did.<br />
<br />
How was he going to fix this?  Between his thick legs and massive udder, there was no way he&#39;d manage to put on pants.  His head would make shirts pretty much impossible.  Heck, would any clothes ever remove an udder?  Kyle considered what he should do next.</p>
