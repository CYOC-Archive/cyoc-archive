<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Turnabout is fair play.&quot; Eva grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Youth magic is normally difficult, but one, you have talent...and victims of youth magic <br />
have an affinity for similar spells.  So here's what you do...&quot;<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
The next day, a pretty young schoolgirl arrived at the coffeeshop.  No sign of Scylla or <br />
Alecto, but to her surprise, Tabitha was there.<br />
<br />
Tabitha had been the first member of the Coven to warm up to Eva.  She was about <br />
average height, with mousy brown hair she wore in a simple ponytail.  She would be <br />
average looking, but behind her glasses shone a pair of brilliant emerald eyes.  She was a <br />
kind-hearted girl, and Eva liked her.<br />
<br />
But today, Tabitha looked a bit down.  What's more, she wasn't wearing the gothic-style <br />
outfits the rest of the Coven favored, just a shapeless grey sweater and blue jeans.  She'd <br />
removed most of her piercings, save for a pair of simple studs in her earlobes.  She was <br />
reading a book, and there was no sign of her other jewelry.<br />
<br />
Eva desperately wanted to know what had happened, but there wasn't anything she could <br />
do.  She walked past Tabitha, heading inside to get a coffee.<br />
<br />
She'd gotten a strange look when she'd ordered the espresso, but she didn't pay it any <br />
mind.  Not like it was going to stunt her growth, after all.<br />
<br />
Heading back outside, she noticed Tabitha was staring at her in awe.<br />
<br />
She walked up to Tabitha.  &quot;Can I help you, Miss?&quot;<br />
<br />
The older girl blinked.  &quot;Ah...I'm so sorry it's just...you reminded me of someone, and your <br />
aura...&quot;  She coughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;My..aura?&quot; I decided to play dumb.  I didn't want to embarass Tabitha, but what could I <br />
do?  A ten-year-old girl shouldn't really know this stuff, right?<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...nevermind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, please, it sounds interesting.  Can I sit with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tabitha looked at me oddly again, then nodded.  &quot;Yes, of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Michelle.&quot;  Since Merlin insisted on calling me Michelle, I figured I might as well go <br />
back to using my middle name.  And to be honest, I felt more like a Michelle anymore.  <br />
Plus, it was a name I'd never used around the Coven.  Scylla knew it, of course, but I wasn't <br />
worried about that.<br />
<br />
She smiled at me.  Probably thinking 'cute kid' or something like that.  &quot;I'm Tabitha.  <br />
Tabitha Rose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a pretty name.&quot;  I beamed at her.  I've practiced smiling in the mirror, this one <br />
could melt a glacier.<br />
<br />
It had the desired effect.  &quot;Oh well, it's actually short for Rosenthal.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;I'd shorten it too.  By the way, I hope you don't mind me saying so, but you have beautiful <br />
eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
She actually blushed.  Apparently I wasn't wrong...my little bod has a lot of sex appeal!  <br />
None of the Coven members were straight, I knew for a fact Tabby was bi.  Not that I was <br />
bothered by that, obviously.  And to be honest, I'm convinced I'm actually sexier (despite <br />
having no breasts to speak of) now than I ever was as an adult.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Th..thank you.  Um, your eyes are pretty too.  They remind me of my friend, Eva.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, what's she like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, actually, you look a lot like her.  Um...could I braid your hair?&quot;<br />
<br />
It was a forward thing to say, but to be honest, I missed my French braid.  Tabby has a <br />
secret fetish...she loves to play with girl's hair.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Could you?  That would be wonderful!&quot;<br />
<br />
I sat patiently in my chair, with her seated behind me, for quite awhile, as she did my hair <br />
in the elegant braid.  Tabby's fingers were very nimble; I'd long thought she should do this <br />
for a living.  As I sat there, she explained auras to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yours is highly charged, I couldn't help but notice.  I was actually going to ask if you'd <br />
been enchanted or transformed, somehow.&quot;<br />
<br />
If only she knew!  I didn't reply, because, to be honest, having her play with my hair was <br />
quite pleasant.  I'd always thought so before, but right, now, I felt like a cat being stroked <br />
just the right way.  It was all I could do not to purr!<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I know, it's all very silly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would you say that?  You believe in magic, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...yes...well...&quot;  she sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well....I used to have some friends who I hung out with.  We were all interested in this <br />
stuff, magic, spells, you know...but...oh I don't know why I'm telling you this...but there <br />
was a big fight and I left.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry.  It's just you sounded so sad.&quot;<br />
<br />
She hugged me impulsively, and kissed my hair.  I leaned into her touch, it felt good to be <br />
held.  &quot;Thank you so much.  You're a wonderful person.&quot;<br />
<br />
I couldn't help but blush.  &quot;Thank you.  I'm sorry about your friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don't know if they're friends anymore.&quot;  And she told me the story I already knew, <br />
about myself, Scylla, and Alecto....with some editing.  And added a chapter that made my <br />
blood boil.<br />
<br />
Alecto had basically taken over the Coven, with Scylla's help.  Tabitha had been totally <br />
against it, but when she was outvoted, she left.  I was amazed that the others had put up <br />
no resistance...but I'm guessing they'd all had some feelings for Alecto in the past.<br />
<br />
The spell she'd used on Scylla would subvert their thoughts; they wouldn't love her, but <br />
they would obey.  The bitch was so going to pay.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow.  They sound like they were drugged.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it was weird.  Like a spell, but not the good kind.&quot;  She sighed and my heart went <br />
out to her.  She'd been hurt too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like someone needs to punish that Alecto girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I wish I could...but really, I'm more worried about Eva.  She was a good friend, and I <br />
know she must be hurting bad.  I called her, and tried going to her apartment, but nobody <br />
has seen her.  I hope she's ok...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't think she'd hurt herself?&quot;<br />
<br />
She stroked my hair, the braid finished at last.  &quot;Ah, you're still young yet, Michelle.  You'll <br />
understand when you're older.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...ok.  I don't get it, you just said they were good friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
I could feel the warmth of Tabby's blush behind me.  &quot;Well...um...&quot;<br />
<br />
I turned in my chair to face her.  And just looked at her for a long moment.<br />
<br />
The clues were right in front of her.  Tabby was pretty smart, and had a strong sense of <br />
empathy.<br />
<br />
Those pretty emerald eyes got big and wide, which actually had the effect of making her <br />
look very cute.  I resolved then and there to try and provoke that look of total surprise out <br />
of her more often.<br />
<br />
&quot;....Eva?&quot;<br />
<br />
I grinned.  &quot;I'm sorry for deceiving you, Tabby.  But I'm sure you can understand how I <br />
couldn't come out and tell you the truth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...but...it's impossible...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but you know it's me.&quot;<br />
<br />
She just nodded in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry about the Coven, Tabby, I know how much it meant to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Somehow she pulled me right out of my chair and into her lap so fast my head spun.  She <br />
hugged me very tightly, and started to cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dummy!  That's nothing..compared to...oh Eva, I'm so sorry...so sorry...&quot;<br />
<br />
It was awhile before she could talk in a normal tone again.  I have to admit, red eyes and a <br />
runny nose don't do Tabby any justice, but I wouldn't trade her kind heart for a dozen <br />
runway models.  Her heart is bigger than she is, and that makes her beautiful.<br />
<br />
I only wished I'd appreciated that more.<br />
<br />
I told her the whole story.  She had no choice but to believe it, and there were more tears, <br />
from both of us, before it was finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, honey...but if it's any consolation, you're so cute I want to take you home with <br />
me.&quot;<br />
<br />
I smiled up at her.  &quot;Thank you, Tabby.  It's good to know I have someone else I can trust.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded.  &quot;I'll never hurt you, I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, Tabby.  But now I have to get some payback...will you help me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you going to hurt Scylla?&quot;<br />
<br />
I shook my head.  &quot;No...there's no way I could do that.  I do think she needs to be <br />
punished, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm...you're probably right there.  Spell or no, she should have realized you were so much <br />
more than Alecto ever could be.  And still are.&quot;<br />
<br />
I blushed.  &quot;I doubt that, I mean, c'mon, I'm a kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm...you think so?&quot;  Tabby just smiled.<br />
<br />
Since Alecto and Scylla weren't here yet, we'd have to go someplace else to look for them.  <br />
Luckily, Tabby has a car, so I won't have to walk.<br />
<br />
