<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Suddenly Jackson&#39;s phone ringed out. &quot;Uh? It&#39;s Dom. What&#39;s up man?... What? Really? But don&#39;t they... fuck! Fine I&#39;ll tell him.&quot; Jackson look clearly distressed but wouldn&#39;t say why.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something happened?&quot; I ventured to ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Natural Council has summoned a meeting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The what now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The &#39;nudists&#39;.&quot; said Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up. But mostly yeah. Shit. I hopped it wouldn&#39;t come to this. They are gathering in the lake. Come on. We&#39;ll have to see for the cure later.&quot; said Jackson. &quot;We&#39;ll meet the others there.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then makes me run out of Andrew&#39;s house all the way to the forest trail, we follow the path until we arrive at a small rundown shed. &quot;I thought you said we were going to the lake?&quot; I said as he was taking off his shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are but...&quot; he seemed to hesitate for a moment before adding. &quot;we use this shed to store our clothes when we go there, remember we are shamans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are and I&#39;m not entirely convinced.&quot; nevertheless I didn&#39;t object to his obvious demands for me to join him in nudeness, he had demonstrated he could force me out off my pants I would rather avoid the experience  altogether. Someone knocked at the door. There most be Harry and the others, said  Jackson, and went to open it. To my surprise however it wasn&#39;t them but to other boys, a bit taller than us and better built. One was a muscular jock with a black haired buzzcut and looking like he was just coming out of the gym and a tan, and the other was a buff irish with green eyes and short hair. I immediately covered my just exposed groin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Saru.&quot; said Jackson.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jay... still mad. And I who came to specifically to get you two.&quot; said the tanned boy. &quot;Yeshh... I guess the rumors were true. The Great Exhibitionist being shy... is something I hadn&#39;t expected to see.&quot; said as he too was peeling off his skin tight jeans and shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;The great what?&quot; I stammered confused as the two teens denuded themselves. If they came from the gym it really showed as they both had well defined pecs and abs, and a healthy bush around their cocks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then hop on!&quot; said the other boy, I was about to ask, but then I saw them sprouting hair and claws, and their bodies deform until they both turned into large wolves, one black and the other... the other was actually a giant fox.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait you mean you want to ride them outside... while naked?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Believe me,you don&#39;t want to ride them, without eating this.&quot; he hand me a nut. &quot;Considering bareback safety.&quot; <br />
<br />
As soon as we were outside on the wolves they started to run, my balls hitting their backs, but oddly it didn&#39;t hurt, it must have been that nut I ate, either way they were going fast, I pulled from their pelt to try not to fall down, until they came to an abrupt stop. &quot;Ouch... dude, don&#39;t pull on the hair.&quot; said Saru returning to human form. But we weren&#39;t the first to arrive.<br />
<br />
On a short account of the people there. There appeared to be a bunch of kids about 1&#39;2&#39;&#39; foot tall just fluttering about, whether girls or boys I couldn&#39;t tell, for their crotches were bare and their voices high pitched, all flying through some kinda of insect  wings. As I rightfully guessed, they were the Fairies. Apparently the younger kids would go to a tree and eat the fruit which turned them into that.<br />
<br />
Perched on a tree were a group of about five naked boys with wings, who later I was informed were named Jennifer, Lucas, Trevor, Mario and Holly. Those sounds like girls name is because they were, and they were actually our age. These were the Amours, or commonly known as the Cupids, all taking the shape of a boy version of their usual self. Holly, the leader a dirty blonde boy, was also apparently my girlfriend at some point.<br />
<br />
On the rock by the water a trio of slim dudes, with glistening skin and again no stitch of clothing sat by the rock. They were the Nix, and apparently there were also girls there but they haven&#39;t arrived. Their gimmick is as so long as they are in tune with the water, apparently meaning naked, they can travel between any body of water and don&#39;t have the need to breath air either. Jackson commented they often visited Nude beaches overseas, just for fun.<br />
<br />
The wiccans were the next to arrive on a pair of wolves of their own. And as promised this girls were as naked as anyone else there. Their small tits and long hair for the two Wiccans, and shorter hair and a more define muscular structure for their wolf-girls. And I must admit, I was filling kind of shy...<br />
<br />
&quot;So are we all here?&quot; spoke Jackson.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of us. But we can start don&#39;t you think.&quot; said Holly. &quot;Beside the one we wanted to talk to is here.&quot; said pointing at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me? But why me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your spell is fading. We have been found out... naked,  it doesn&#39;t matter when they don&#39;t care but now...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember, the spell we told you made for us. Well you kinda did it for everyone here. And without you to keep it going. It has started to fall apart.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So yesterday?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There was a good chance my mom would have given us an earful.Also you also charged them for the service, so... Anyway, like I said the fairies to tell all, it isn&#39;t Will&#39;s fault. The Wiccan&#39;s cursed him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was Samantha, and she didn&#39;t spoke from the coven. Although the coven recognize, she had a point being mad at Will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the heck did I do to that girl?&quot;</p>
