<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Deion / Alec started to get on his computer again, this time to find some information legitimately rather than just to go and try to find some porn. He remembered what in all likelihood started him down this path, and the exact point where he&#39;d started changing. He&#39;d been assaulted by those gang assholes on the street, admittedly...probably for being a racist douchebag. But if they had some way of changing people like that, then he would need to find out what it was they were up to, and where they were. If to 1) prevent them from changing any more people like he&#39;d been changed and 2) to...settle what was going on with him.<br />
<br />
He started looking through recent police documentation, trying to find some hint of information about them. It did look like there was more recent gang activity, but it was definitely not what Spencer and his gang likely assumed was going on. Jimmy Blanche had driven out a drug running gang from the neighborhood that had been dealing apparently to the more affluent teenagers by and large. Deion / Alec was admittedly not surprised. For all that Spencer and his goons talked shit about black people, they sure enjoyed getting their nose candy from black people.<br />
<br />
Well, at any rate, the new gang, calling themselves the Black Street Runners, were from Chicago apparently, and they&#39;d left the city after getting involved in a fire at a Chicago laboratory. Jimmy Blanche&#39;s pic also matched the guy from Deion&#39;s memories who had knocked him out. Seemed Jimmy was not...quite as bad as the gang that had been here before. By far less drugs, more involving himself in just gambling and properties. That didn&#39;t mean Deion approved of him, but he was comparatively less awful than Leshawn Marcus, the head of the drug runners, who&#39;d recently been arrested for murder and extortion.<br />
<br />
If Deion was right about this, then most likely whatever happened at that Chicago laboratory had some kind of connection to whatever it was that changed him from white to black. However when Deion went to try and find something out about the lab in question it seemed the information about that was mostly limited to what the lab was, where it was, but not what it was studying or what came out of there. So if he had to guess, he was gonna need to try and get in contact with the gang in question to find out what was going on here. And...if he wanted to return to being Deion Dalton, or if he was just gonna stay as Alec with the understanding he had now.<br />
<br />
With that, Deion got up and started getting dressed. Throwing on a blue tank top from King&#39;s Apparel, tight boxer shorts, a pair of jeans and his sneaker shoes. Time to head out and see what he could find.<br />
<br />
The first thing Deion / Alec noted as he headed out was the different way people approached him. Those same girls who had commented on how &quot;Deion&quot; had been quite articulate despite stereotypes now seemed relieved to see him and one of them said, &quot;Ohh you&#39;re back in town, Alec? Kayla should be happy about that! She&#39;s been so distressed about your disappearance...&quot;<br />
<br />
Oof. Yeah, that was another thing he&#39;d forgotten to think about in depth. The Kayla situation. Deion going and Alec returning would mean his girlfriend would feel a lot less anxiety and yet she would also have to deal with him again. And considering how their relationship had been... maybe it would&#39;ve been better for her ultimately to find a different guy. But probably not through Alec fucking disappearing on her and likely giving her an anxious fit trying to get into contact with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah, I&#39;m...I&#39;m back. Back in town. Thanks.&quot; Deion / Alec said with a smile, and then looked around. At least today it looked like he was not gonna have to deal with Spencer&#39;s shit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you been working out?&quot; The local girl commented, and felt up his shoulder, &quot;You&#39;re a lot broader than you usually are. Have you been working out lately?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh, yeah, yeah I totally have been.&quot; Deion / Alec responded, and then sardonically thought to himself, no, actually, I got turned into a black guy for a while and for some reason it also included me putting on like a lot of muscle. Curious he got to keep the musculature, but he guessed he didn&#39;t mind too much. Especially considering it was getting him noticed. &quot;See you &#39;round. I&#39;ll be heading back to class this Monday.&quot; That gave him some time to get things straightened out.<br />
<br />
He had to find that gang today, discover what was going on, and then resolve things with Kayla and...Dave. Dave would prove to be a hell of a headache he just knew it. That weird closet case was out there stirring up all kinds of trouble, and apparently he&#39;d be trying to spread whatever it was that had happened to Deion to other people now too. And probably siccing them in his direction. So that was something else to need to deal with.<br />
<br />
Deion didn&#39;t want anyone else getting possibly changed beyond repair by Dave. This immature revenge scheme was gonna need to stop. Which meant in addition to locating the gang, he was gonna need to find Dave. But where in the world would he be able to find Dave at this hour?<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Touch me a-a-all night long<br />
Hold me, baby, drive me crazy<br />
Touch me all night long<br />
Make me love you, kiss and hug you<br />
Touch me all night long&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake wondered why he had been invited to one of the parties thrown by the popular crowd. He was definitely not one of the more popular kids there. Tall, but lanky and having sandy brown hair, Jake wore glasses over his light blue eyes. He couldn&#39;t very well get involved in fitness due to a physical deformity - his chest was afflicted with Pectus excavatum aka a concave chest or funnel chest. It left him not exactly suited for physical labor or working out. And his family couldn&#39;t be bothered to get him any surgery.<br />
<br />
The appearance of his chest also made him a target for bullying.<br />
<br />
He was repeatedly picked on by Spencer and his goons, a fact that put the lie to any of Spencer&#39;s claims his Neo-Nazi goons were for &quot;white solidarity&quot;. Sure they were. Until they found a white guy who didn&#39;t fit their definition of fitness. Then they picked on him like anyone else. But Jake sighed, he didn&#39;t come here to ruminate on the past. Even though he could see his old bullies were here and strangely leaving him alone. He mingled as best he could in his button up shirt and dress pants, but he still felt out of place.<br />
<br />
This was a place for the in crowd, not...the Jake crowd.<br />
<br />
Making things worse was the fact that Jake liked men as well as liking women. He was bisexual, a fact he shared with nobody outside of the men and women of PornHub. How Jake wished he could&#39;ve been as attractive as the adult actors on there. But no, he was stuck as he was it seemed----<br />
<br />
Then Jake registered something. Someone brushed up against him, and spoke to him from behind. &quot;Cmon upstairs. Let&#39;s chat, bro.&quot; Jake shivered, the voice was smooth but subtly aggressive. There was no arguing with it without fisticuffs breaking out. He felt his manhood stirring. He didn&#39;t really like it in himself, but damn he was attracted to these aggressive, pushy jockbro types. Mostly because he jerked himself off every night imagining himself as one of them.<br />
<br />
He followed upstairs, the crowd in the party making it less obvious who was calling him upstairs, but going by the vocal tone it sounded like one of the black football players. Jake admitted he found those guys particularly attractive, though none of them would ever reciprocate that he knew of. As Jake went upstairs, he found himself called out to again from the party house&#39;s upstairs room, currently unoccupied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cmon in, bro. I invited you for a reason. You know why.&quot; Jake saw an astonishing physical specimen resting on the bed, which turned his light stirring into a full on erection. The man was either black or mixed race, with captivating eyes, caramel colored skin, and a massively muscled countenance. Everything Jake had ever hoped he could be. His hair was curly, but evidently this dude had tried to make it straightened.<br />
<br />
Jake found himself walking step by step into the room, closing it behind him, almost hypnotized.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know you want this.&quot; The guy said as he got up and took off his own button up shirt one button at a time. The muscles were beyond what Jake had even guessed at, and to Jake&#39;s shame he could tell his manhood was emitting precum. The front of his pants were stained and a light drip drop broke through occasionally.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I do...fuck me, I do.&quot; Jake did not even know when it turned into a steamy make out scene straight out of one of his pornos. Jake was kissing and feeling every luscious inch of this hunk, comparing him to the guys he&#39;d liked on the hub. Jake could get so many girls if he had a body like this. He could be desired by women and men alike if his body matched this guy&#39;s... the kissing got more intense, and Jake was left barely aware as he felt his pants get pulled down and their dicks started rubbing against one another.<br />
<br />
Jake could feel something odd and tingly going on. A tightness in his chest. He assumed it was just his body reacting, but the tingling feeling got hotter and tighter, and Jake almost felt like screaming in pleasure or pain, possibly both. He couldn&#39;t help it, though, but melt into the occasion with his new paramour. This would be the first time he&#39;d done anything like this. He had been a virgin before. Why was this guy doing this for him? To him? Would he want to uhh, to top? Bottom? Whatever? Maybe this was just gonna be a frot affair.<br />
<br />
Jake heard something pop and crack, but he barely cared as he kept going---<br />
<br />
And then his studly lover got up suddenly and started getting dressed again. Jake could barely stand up from where he&#39;d been kissing and making out with this guy. As he fixed himself up, Jake was only aware of his own burning arousal and the need emanating from his swollen manhood. He&#39;d never felt so needy or desperately, aggressively aroused. As he watched this guy start to head to the door, Jake shouted, &quot;W-Wait! I need....I&#39;m not...I still gotta cum!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Take care of it yourself, bro.&quot; Dave murmured as he pulled on a hooded jacket and gloves, and then slammed the door behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I gotta cum!!&quot; Jake whined to himself, and then started to notice something was off. Something was unusual. As he looked himself over, he saw that the symbol of his loneliness, the concave chest that eliminated his ability to be fit... it was gone. His chest looked like any other guy&#39;s chest. His left hand felt his newly normal chest, even as the right hand pumped his cock.<br />
<br />
Jake became aware even then that there was something else. His muscles... his arms and shoulders looked ever so slightly more muscular and veiny. His chest actually looked a little bit impressive, pushing out a bit. &quot;Ahh...I&#39;m...I&#39;m not so thin any more. What happened to me...? Ohh! OHH!!!&quot; Suddenly Jake felt his immodest organ grow half an inch longer, and that was all he could take.<br />
<br />
He painted the floor white with his cum, and he laid there for a moment after having rolled off the bed and pumped his hips. Jake grinned despite himself, and chuckled.</p>
