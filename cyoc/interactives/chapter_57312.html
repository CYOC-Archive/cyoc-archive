<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bridget watched as Brian lay on the couch with his butt high in the air.  She once again <br />
thanked god she brought that gas mask over yesterday as a joke.  It sure came in handy, <br />
because Brian had not stopped farting for over an hour.  The whole time he complained <br />
how his butt felt like it was on fire.<br />
<br />
Bridget thought back to earlier in the day before all this started.  Brian felt different when <br />
he woke up, and quickly invited her over.  When she arrived she noticed that he had a <br />
giant flower in his right lapel.  Through experimentation they soon discovered that close <br />
proximity to the flower caused it to spray water in her face.  Brian apparently had no <br />
trigger mechanism for it himself, and was just as amazed that it would spray.  He handed <br />
her the handkerchief from his left breast pocket to dry off.  She pulled and pulled and <br />
ended up with twenty handkerchiefs and a pair of boxers all tied together.  Again Brian had <br />
no idea how that happened, but was able to easily put them back into his pocket like he <br />
had done it for his whole life.  Bridget quietly and discreetly pulled out her list and <br />
checked it.  She realized that these traits were not on it.  “The ointment strikes again,” she <br />
thought.<br />
<br />
The other thing Bridget quickly noticed was Brian’s mannerisms.  He tended to cartwheel <br />
and tumble around the room when he moved.  It first came to her attention when Brian <br />
asked her if she wanted something to drink and she said yes.  He then cart wheeled into <br />
the kitchen, and did forward rolls back with her drink.  Amazingly he did not spill a drop.  <br />
“Thanks,” she said while looking at him strangely.<br />
<br />
“What, Hyuck?” Brian asked her.<br />
<br />
“You just did a bunch of gymnastics to get me my drink!”<br />
<br />
“”Oh my, Hyuck, God!”  Brian shouted as he realized she was right. “I did, didn’t I?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah you did.”<br />
<br />
Brian farted and brought out his unicycle.  He quickly pedaled around the room in circles, <br />
scuffing the hard wood floors. “What am I going to do?  This gets, duh, worse all the <br />
time!”  Brian yelled at her as he started to panic.  He then almost absentmindedly picked <br />
up some household objects and started juggling them.  <br />
<br />
“Weird,” Bridget thought.  She then pulled out her list again, making sure Brian didn’t see <br />
her.  She realized everything had come true on her list but the fireworks coming out of his <br />
butt.  She had made herself laugh with that one, and didn’t really expect it to happen, but <br />
everything else had.  Hell if he can produce a unicycle out of his butt, why not fireworks?  <br />
“Wonder when they’ll start?” She thought to herself, <br />
“Hopefully after dark!  They’ll be so pretty!”<br />
<br />
Throughout the day Brian would talk and behave more like himself when they were <br />
relaxing and watching TV, but as soon as they talked about what was happening or <br />
anything serious Brian’s speech impediment would start and he would soon begin to fall <br />
down clumsily.  None of this escaped Bridget’s notice.<br />
<br />
It was a little after dusk that Brian began to fart more steadily.  He had of course farted <br />
through out the day because of his chronic flatulence, but now it was happening a lot <br />
more frequently.  <br />
<br />
“Wha..What’s going on, Hee Hee?’ Brian looked at Bridget with panic on his face.<br />
<br />
Bridget grabbed Brian by his stomach and tried to reassure him.  “You’re going to be all <br />
right.”<br />
<br />
“All right?  Duh, I’ve turned into a clown Bridget!  And now I can’t stop farting!”  He then <br />
turned away from her, but as she was still holding his stomach all that happened was Brian <br />
succeeded in shaking his own stomach causing the calliope music to play.  “Der, Great!  <br />
Now at least we’ll be entertained as we watch me fart myself to death!”<br />
<br />
Brian began to fart even more violently than yesterday, but it felt like the farts were getting <br />
hotter and hotter.  That’s when Brian laid down on the couch and began to moan in pain.  <br />
Bridget noticed that the smell was worse than normal, and it was plenty bad normally.  It <br />
was almost like it had a sulpher smell mixed in.  After about ten minutes of the nasty farts <br />
Bridget put on the gas mask.  Brian probably didn’t even notice, as he filled the house with <br />
toxic fumes.  Bridget could do nothing but watch.<br />
<br />
After about fifteen more minutes Bridget thought she saw little sparks around Brian’s butt.  <br />
“The fireworks…” she whispered to herself.  “Brian get outside now!”<br />
<br />
“What?  Why?” he looked at her with little understanding on his face.<br />
<br />
“Just do it!  And pull your pants down when you get out there!”  She grabbed his arm and <br />
pulled him up.<br />
<br />
Brian grabbed his butt and ran outside squeaking and farting.  When he ran outside he <br />
pulled his pants down like Bridget instructed him to do so, and was amazed.  <br />
<br />
Both watched in shock and awe as the most amazing fireworks display they had ever seen <br />
launched out of Brian’s butt.  It lasted for what seemed like forever and ended with a <br />
grand finale that lit up the whole sky.  Brian who had been bending over with his butt in <br />
the air, and looking over his shoulder at the fire works display finally slumped down to the <br />
ground exhausted.<br />
<br />
“What next?”  Brian asked as he rolled over onto his back.<br />
<br />
Bridget saw Brian’s heels glow quickly signaling his transformation was over.  She then <br />
stepped onto Brian’s stomach and he noticeably winced as a fart escaped his butt.  Bridget <br />
smiled because she knew it wasn’t her weight, but the fart that bothered him.  <br />
<br />
“I repeat,” Brian yelled at nobody, “What next?”<br />
<br />
“How about a new name,” Bridget asked as she began to bounce on Brian’s trampoline <br />
stomach, him releasing a small fart with each bounce.<br />
<br />
“What?  Why?”<br />
<br />
“Because you’re the world’s greatest clown now, and Brian isn’t the best clown name.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not a clown,” Brian said bitterly.<br />
<br />
“Yes you are,” she smiled at him maliciously.  “I know.  For now on your Funzo T. Clown!”<br />
<br />
“Brian looked at her and realized she was right, he was a clown now.  And would probably <br />
always be one.  Brian leaned his head back slowly resigning himself to his fate.<br />
<br />
Bridget was laughing her butt off as she bounced higher and higher.  “Yep.  You’re Funzo <br />
T. Clown for now on.  What a great night.”<br />
<br />
Funzo picked up his head and looked at her disbelieving.  “How is this a great night?”<br />
<br />
Bridget just looked up into the night sky as she bounced.  “It just is Funzo.  It just is.”</p>
