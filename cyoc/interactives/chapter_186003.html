<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite everything, the thought of turning into a Donkey still aroused Jeff.<br />
And he had now additionally become curious about his new twin&#39;s previous life.<br />
&quot;You know, i&#39;d actually like to try that again.&quot; Jeff&#39;s twin looked shocked, causing him to hastily explain himself.<br />
&quot;We&#39;re basically the closest people to each other now, right? But you remember an entire lifetime as a donkey,<br />
so i thought we&#39;d be able to understand each other better if i knew about a bit of what it&#39;s like.<br />
I definitely wouldn&#39;t suggest this if i didn&#39;t have you now to keep me safe.&quot; Geoff seemed to understand Jeff and nodded after a while.<br />
&quot;Alright, that seems like a good idea. But don&#39;t complain afterwards if you don&#39;t like it.&quot; He sat down ad immediately got to work.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll give you a body similar to my old one, just a bit healthier.&quot; He paused for a moment.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll make some adjustments to the body, location and so on too, to make it easier to get the whole experience.&quot;<br />
Geoff was quick and it took him only a few minutes to get ready. &quot;So Jeff, anything you wanna do before you leave?&quot;<br />
Jeff thought for a moment. &quot;Actually, i think i&#39;d like to eat somet-&quot; &quot;Too late.&quot; Geoff hit enter as Jeff was mid-sentence,<br />
startling him, before he suddenly disappeared. Geoff did it because he knew, that being a bit forceful just made it hotter for Jeff.<br />
He knew, because it was the same for him.<br />
<br />
Jeff appeared on a beautiful meadow, completely different from the place he ended up the first time.<br />
He also immediately realized that his vision was almost as good as usual, when he spotted a few horses a small distance away.<br />
His thoughts were interrupted, when something slapped against his belly, prompting him to look down.<br />
Jeff realized that his body was healtier, younger and cleaner this time.<br />
But the giant rubbery penis, currently pressed against his belly due to arousal, seemed to be even bigger than before.<br />
&quot;You seem pretty happy about your situation so far.&quot; Jeff recognized the voice as Geoff.<br />
His cheeks would have burned with humiliation right now, if they hadn&#39;t been covered with fur.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be here for a while to help you get used to things, but after that i&#39;ll only be dropping in every once in a while.&quot;<br />
Jeff felt a bit nervous after those words. How long did Geoff think Jeff needed to get the full experience?<br />
He noticed one of the horses come closer as he was pondering over that question.<br />
&quot;Ah, here he comes!&quot; Geoff seemed excited. Jeff wondered what he was talking about. Did Geoff know about this horse?<br />
He took a closer look at the horse that was now only a few metres away.<br />
The first thing he noticed was that it was particularly large and muscular, it&#39;s fur a beautiful glossy black.<br />
Jeff thought that it might be some breed of draft horse, though he&#39;d never seen one so beautiful before.<br />
He had also noticed that it was a stallion, judging from the large penis that had slipped out of his sheath.<br />
Jeff was surprised when the large stallion suddenly started to intimately nuzzle his face after arriving in front of him.<br />
&quot;Say hello to your new boyfriend!&quot; Geoff&#39;s words shocked him so much that he moved a few steps back and let out a loud &#39;Haaaw!&#39;.<br />
The stallion was startled and looked at Jeff, scared that he might have hurt him somehow.<br />
He stood still for a moment, before thinking of something and circling around Jeff, who seemed to be listening to something.<br />
The stallion, who Jeff had been told was called &#39;Donner&#39;, wich he&#39;d found out was german for &#39;thunder&#39;,<br />
startled Jeff into braying again when he suddenly moved to stand over Jeff from behind,<br />
who was only confused for the few moments it took for Donner to find the hole and thrust his huge member inside.<br />
Jeff brayed much louder this time, shocked by the sudden burning pain running through him,<br />
though not as much as by the pleasure he slowly started to feel as the stallion thrust into him.<br />
The pleasure grew with each thrust, until it exceeded the pain, slowly pushing it away,<br />
to the point that Jeff backed up into Donner, so that more of the stallions dick could penetrate Jeff&#39;s thick, black pucker, wich,<br />
unbeknownst to him, had been replaced with the one Geoff&#39;s old body used to have.<br />
The donkey used to be surrounded by horses much larger than him, that had used him on a daily basis,<br />
until he&#39;d become accustomed to it and started to derive pleasure from being used by the stallions.<br />
Geoff had made the entire body significantly younger than his had been,<br />
but he had made sure that his rear remembered the feeling of being fucked by a stallion, even if Jeff didn&#39;t.<br />
Of course Jeff didn&#39;t know any of this, he just knew that he was instinctively slamming his ass back against the stallion like a complete slut.<br />
Donner noticed that the Jeff had started to enjoy it and, happy that his mate seemed to no longer act so strangely standoffish,<br />
thrust into Jeff with renewed effort, intending to fuck Jeff into exhaustion.<br />
He wanted to make sure that his mate would immediately recognize him the next time, so that no one could take Jeff from him.<br />
<br />
Geoff watched Jeff for a while longer, who for his part seemed to enjoy the situation immensly,<br />
judging from the semi-constant spurts of cum shooting out of his massive donkey dick, before turning off the live feed.<br />
&quot;He seems to really like Donner. Maybe i should use to Chronivac so Jeff can keep him once he turns back?<br />
Or i could just turn him human too. So many good options... but they&#39;ll all have to wait until Jeff turns back.&quot;<br />
Geoff leaned back in the chair, a wide grin plastered on his face. &quot;And i have a feeling it&#39;ll be a while until that happens.&quot;<br />
His grin faded when he heard a light grumbling. &quot;Jeff had they right idea when he mentioned eating something earlier.&quot;<br />
He stood up and started walking towards the door. &quot;Man, human food is gonna be a blast. Something else i&#39;ll be teasing Jeff about.&quot;<br />
Geoff chuckled as he walked out of the room, closing the door behind him.</p>
