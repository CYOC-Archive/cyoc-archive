<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lynn continued to work for several months and showed the office a better way of doing things. Every Tuesday a call from her Aunt Francis came in and Lynn talked at length about her enjoyed work and new friends.<br />
<br />
The days and weeks went so smoothly that Lusious would call Lynn to barn Lab 7 for first viewing of changed subjects as they would put their new drives and bodies to the prepared use.<br />
<br />
Lynn was almost lost the continued scene of transforming people and wild lusting sexual acts of the subjects. It was one morning when Sarah came into the office early and announced the morning arrival of the best looking Belgian draft horse she'd ever seen. Lynn, Sarah, and Lusious went over to Stud Barn One to see the newest stud for the draft horse breeding program.<br />
<br />
&quot;WOW,&quot; the three said together at the sight of the handsome stallion.<br />
The stud's groom held the reins as the three walked a circle about the massive beast. As they stopped in front of the animal Lynn was centered to his nose and gave in a soft stroke and pat. The stallion took a sniff of her friendly scent and offered a loud whinnie of affection. <br />
<br />
As Lynn drew her hand back quickly the stallion took a half step forward and lowering his head pressed his face against Lynn's breast's.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's rather taken to you, don't you think Lynn.&quot; asked Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes he is very taken with you, I'm sure he will be most happy whenever you come around.&quot; said Lusious.<br />
<br />
As then Lusious took the reins and asked the groom to take a coffee break as the three managers wanted to talk in private about their new animal.<br />
<br />
Lynn stroked the big horses fuzzy smooth face as the beast seemed to almost purr as a kitten. <br />
<br />
&quot;I expect he is going to be very willing to become our prime stud. He meets a pretty woman and quickly makes a friend.&quot; said Lusious. &quot;Oh Lynn I wish you to be introduced correctly to our new asset. Lynn Adams I present to you our new prime stallion Bob Adams, you exhusband!&quot; said Lusious.<br />
<br />
Sarah and Lynn both whirled around to see that evil grin and Lynn turning to look at the Belgian remembered the conversation about his possible coming to show the farm new techinques. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bob, is it really you, are you this Belgian Stud?&quot;asked Lynn softly. She knew of the blandishments going on with the other subjects or victims of Lusious reformation process. It was more than possible as she remembered the reason for their breakup. How angry she had become when Bob took that medicine and grew the size of his penis past where she could accept it inside her body. <br />
<br />
Lusious gave a short laugh as he pointed to the usual way a stallion shows's his passion, a massive Belgian black horse cock now swung erect and half masterbating beneath the beast.<br />
<br />
Lynn cupped her hands under Bob's chin and tried to look him in those deep large brown eyes. &quot;Dear is this now the real you? Have you accepted what your are?&quot; asked Lynn.<br />
<br />
The stallion gave a soft snort and pressed his face against her breasts. A good slap on his broad strong neck as she pushed him away. &quot;Fine Bob it looks as if your true desire for having a big cock has now been realised! Lusious have him in the breeding program whenever you feel he's ready.&quot; said Lynn in a now tough uncarring manor.<br />
<br />
Lynn stood back as the Belgian whinnied loud and long as he felt her love again break away. <br />
<br />
&quot;He still wants you as his mate!&quot; said Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;That wasn't possible before and now he is nowhere near able to push that tree trunk up into my body! Well he wanted what was promised in the adds, a big dick! Now Bob you got one! The SunRise Farms will be most greatful if you keep the thing erect and thrusting away. I now for one have work awaiting to get done. I suggest the groom find some work for a stallion who must begin to earn his keep!&quot; at that Lynn stopped talking and turned to walk to the main house and office.<br />
<br />
Sarah went to get the groomsman while Lusious beconed Lynn to wait for him to come too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please Lynn I was very foolish in showing him to you that way. I was informed by Frank Marquette that he used both the serum on Bob, but also used one of his methods. I don't like it but he used Gamma rays passed thru old dying horse bodies to impress a equine pattern into each living ceel during the transformation process.  The process is increased I'm told so that the subject's bone and muscle structure is five time mor dense than a born animal. Since he normally sells his animals for continued use pulling heavy loads, he finds the owners are much happier when his horses never break legs or become quickly tired. Not withstanding he knows that the serum allows the subject to continue to live the normal number of years for an exceptionally healthy human.&quot; said Luious explaining his thoughts and actions.<br />
<br />
Lynn said nothing as she was drained of feelings. Although she rather expected today would come, she had hope that Bob's employment might have been a true job and not what really came about.<br />
<br />
The day's work made her sad and she skipped diner with the others and went directly to bed. Lusious explanation of Bob's change made her realize that Bob was now and always to be a Belgian stallion. No possible use of the serum could ever change him back to the man he once was. Lynn now felt really alone!</p>
