<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">About a half-hour after you’d dozed off you woke up with a jerk immediately groaning as you felt a host of sore muscles in your back and sides stretch and complain, grimacing you made to rub the back of your neck but couldn’t seem to lift your arm.<br />
<br />
Confused, you wondered if you’d gone to sleep on it, and tried to sit up, almost immediately the world tilted sideways and you struggled not to go with it as your head swam sickeningly. What was…? But an instant later you knew what the problem was; you were terribly, agonisingly thirsty! You’d never been so thirsty in all your life! You were so thirsty you wondered how you’d not noticed it upon first waking up!<br />
<br />
Furnace-hot heat pressed starkly outward against the surface of your skin; your heart was beating so hard in your chest it physically hurt. Your tongue felt thick and dry in your mouth, you swallowed, and your throat felt as dry as sand paper. God! You were so dehydrated! Did you get heatstroke? Going to sleep on a warm sunny day had definitely been a really bad idea!<br />
<br />
But none of that mattered now as your parched throat and body cried out for water, looking around yourself for relief your vision wildly blurred, before clearing to show the cool, crystal clear waters of the lake just feet away you!<br />
<br />
Salvation! You immediately tried to get up, but your body didn’t seem to be working properly, you couldn’t seem to get your feet under you. Cursing your weakness, you ended up half stumbling, half dragging yourself to the water’s edge and as soon as you got there you didn’t stop to think before plunging your head down into the water’s cool embrace.<br />
<br />
As soon as your lips met the pure H2O you began to drink, your throat bobbing like mad as you took down several huge gulps before pacing yourself and taking a breath between every three swallows.<br />
<br />
Finally your racing heart found its more natural rhythm as you quenched your thirst and pulled your head back out of the lake panting. Closing your eyes you savoured the sensation of having fulfilled such a basic need, feeling the horrible heat, and dizzy sensations from before slowly fading away.<br />
<br />
You came back to yourself several seconds later to the feeling of absent drops of water falling off your skin back into the lake, opening your eyes to watch you saw the splashes and ripples the droplets created, the shimmers on the surface of the water bending and distorting your reflection for a moment before smoothing out to reveal a horse’s muzzle staring back at you.<br />
<br />
Wait, what?<br />
<br />
You blinked, confused, looking down at the horse’s reflection in the water, it had the classic long equine face, flicking ears, big brown eyes; its pale sandy coloured coat, darker around its damp, dripping muzzle.<br />
<br />
Shaking your head a little, you screwed up your eyes at the reflection, reaching up to rub at your face with your hand, it again strangely refused to move when you willed it to. Perplexed, a lazy tilt of your head towards the offending limb showed that you no longer had a hand, or an arm for that matter, instead attached to your body was a very horse-like foreleg and hoof!<br />
<br />
Blinking stupidly at it for a moment, it took your mind another couple of seconds to cotton-on to what you were really seeing. A horse’s foreleg was joined to your body; covered in a beige coat of fur, the leg was capped with a black-nailed crescent-shaped hoof.<br />
<br />
Confusion. Fear. Horror.<br />
<br />
Competing emotions exploded in your mind one after another like bombs, each sending off shockwaves that tore your sanity apart, each emotion feeding on the one before it, each fighting for dominance as you frantically began struggling against the equine forelimb, pushing it against the ground as if you could remove it, and change it back to its former self if only you moved fast enough!<br />
<br />
Weakly the equine leg flopped about, your struggles only exhausting you and bringing to your awareness that your other arm had been similarly transformed into a horse’s forehoof!<br />
<br />
Staring at the legs that had replaced your arms, you saw that they were both frightfully real!<br />
<br />
Your head then jerked back down to take in your reflection once more, and once more a horse’s muzzle stared unapologetically back at you.<br />
<br />
That was your reflection! You were a horse!<br />
<br />
Suddenly desperate to see the truth of what you were, you turned your big head around, your longer, much more graceful neck allowing you to look back over your new body, taking in the full horror of what you had become.<br />
<br />
Looking down the length of your back you saw a beige-fur coated horse’s body!<br />
<br />
It… you were stretched out, lying on your side, your hindlegs capped with hooves were neatly folded, hocks and fetlocks curling inwards towards your belly, at your rear you saw your equine tail flicking merrily behind you, atop your head you could feel your dagger-shaped ears twitching and swivelling in alarm. And there stretching in front of your face as plain as day was a horse’s muzzle capped with a snout!<br />
<br />
Nooooooooo! Even as your mind exploded into chaos, you heard yourself let loose the natural equine shriek of a horse in distress!<br />
<br />
That can&#39;t be you! It just can&#39;t be! You’re completely changed. You’re completely a horse… an animal. There&#39;s nothing left of you. B-But this can’t be possible! You must be dreaming or something! No one just falls asleep one minute a human, and wakes up the next minute a horse! Things like this don&#39;t just happen! It’s… IMPOSSIBLE!<br />
<br />
Wake up! You told yourself. WAKE UP!<br />
<br />
Instinctively heaving yourself up, you got onto all fours for the first time and shuddered at how right it immediately felt; the feeling of the ground beneath your fee… hooves, the immense size and weight of your new body, the running and jumping power in your powerful equine leg muscles as they worked as one; all of this should have been alien to you, but instead it felt so natural, so right, like you’d been born and lived your entire life this way.<br />
<br />
Looking over at the lake again, seeing now the full reflection of your equine body, your four tall legs, the thick and powerful horse’s frame, your long neck, oblong head, ears, mane, tail and all. You saw there was nothing left of your humanity! Nothing at all! You were all horse! You were a horse!<br />
<br />
Feeling fear and panic overwhelm reason you reared up and screamed, but it just came out as another shrill whinny! No! No! You can&#39;t be a horse. You just can&#39;t be. You’re a human-being, not a horse! You don’t want to be a horse! You’re human! You’re a human-being!<br />
<br />
As your thoughts barrelled out of control, your vision began to narrow and darken, you became aware that your heart was pounding like crazy, your head was thudding like a war drum, you shivered and shook, your breath closed up in your throat, you couldn&#39;t get enough air, chills and hot flushes ran through your body. Something was building inside of you, something terrible, something that was filling you up with a debilitating, immobilizing intensity!<br />
<br />
Just as your madness was truly taking wing, Harry reappeared at the trot from around a bend in the forest and came to a stop a few feet away from you.<br />
<br />
By the time you spotted the stallion your eyes were so wide with terror and panic the whites were showing; you were in the grip of powerful equine instincts that were clawing up from your subconscious, instincts that told you that you needed to run, to escape from whatever had spooked you. Your mighty heart thundered, new fore and hind limbs trembling as adrenaline fuelled fear filled them.<br />
<br />
But before you could turn and flee you heard the distinctive sound of Harry snorting authoritatively behind you. Desperate for help from any quarter you turned to face the big stallion, feeling his eyes lock commandingly onto yours, something ‘other’ took hold of your senses and began exerting a calming influence over you, dampening down your fear and shock, moving those turbulent emotions to the back of your mind, slowly allowing newly emergent instincts and feelings to come into the fore.<br />
<br />
Not understanding what was happening to you, you just went along with what felt right, as your nostrils naturally flared, allowing you to take in the stallion’s scent; he had a rich salty musk, reminiscent of sweaty leather, baled hay and freshly cut grass. It clung to every inch of his big powerful body, it was such a strong scent and so obviously masculine that you felt your skin go hot and cold, before it began crawling with anticipation.<br />
<br />
Something in you was excited by it!<br />
<br />
Shaking your head at the strange feeling you couldn’t seem to help yourself as you let out a series of quiet huffs. Your sensitive nostrils flaring open to let in as much of that wonderful musk as you could, your nasal receptors eagerly investigating every acrid, salty nuance of Harry&#39;s scent, each inhalation sending sharp twinges into your brain. Soon the stallion’s heavy pheromones were oversaturating your olfactory senses, leaving you with a tingling sensation growing deep in your belly, and an inexplicable wetness in-between your hindlegs as an unknown need began to grow inside you, a need that began pushing your mind into new and mysterious directions, that caused you to begin fantasising about horse’s mounting, mating and breeding each other.<br />
<br />
Alarmed at your reaction to the stallion’s scent as much as the direction in which your mind was being taken, you struggled not to lose yourself to those imaginings. Where had these thoughts and feelings come from? Why weren’t you more worried about them? What had happened to your previous terror and confusion?<br />
<br />
You didn’t have the time to think of any answers to these questions as you noticed Harry slowly walking up to you. His ears were pricked forward with interest as he nickered before reaching outward to gently touch his nose to yours.<br />
<br />
Muzzle to muzzle, you didn’t even think to pull away as you unknowingly reciprocated his affections, breathing in his air even as he breathed in yours. His breath smelled of the grass he’d just been eating, but there was more to it than that, you could sense a deeper emotive connection in the scent of his body and breath that transcended language and connected to parts of your mind as yet nascent and newformed.<br />
<br />
There was a great deal of information here, you knew your new body was trying to tell you something, something no male could ever truly comprehend, a burning, aching longing for something you would never be able to accept.<br />
<br />
It was such a powerfully overwhelming sensory experience that you subliminally became unmoored from yourself, and put into a sort of dream-like state as your saw Harry’s gaze shifting, saw it become more predatory, more… wanting! His look sent a shiver of trepidation up your spine as he began walking past you, the stallion taking the opportunity to rub his body up against yours! Taunting you with his heat, teasing you with his scent, he rubbed himself along your side. Taking the opportunity to nibble at your flank possessively as he went, he circled around you to your rear until suddenly you felt his hot breath tickle over your wide open rump!<br />
<br />
Flicking your tail nervously, you wondered what he was doing, and more to the point what were you doing as petrified, you stood there stock-still, your hooves seemingly frozen to the ground as the stallion inspected you.<br />
<br />
God, you felt so vulnerable in this position you wanted to scream, to fight, to do anything that might break the drugged cocoon that was helplessly imprisoning you in place! Instead you stood there, your muscles beginning to tremble with the building tension, your nerves tightening up into such a knot you all but leapt up into the air as finally you felt the stallion’s broad muzzle suddenly push up under your tail and something wet and firm lap against your rear!<br />
<br />
O-oh god, what was he dooOOOH!<br />
<br />
You felt it again!<br />
<br />
Harry was licking your ass with his tongue! The wet, slimy touch inexplicably sending a wave of warmth and pleasure throughout your entire body!<br />
<br />
Whinnying at the sensation, you tensed up again as you felt the horse place another laving lick upon your behind, your whole body trembling at the erotically pleasurable feeling, you felt even wetter between your hindlegs and soon began craving something long and hard to fill the empty aching space inside you!<br />
<br />
At that obscene thought your eyes widened with a sudden shocked realization, as finally your mind put all the pieces together… glancing back under your own body you immediately saw to your dismay that there was not anything remotely masculine between your hindlegs! No stallion’s sheath, no balls, only a set of nipples, nipples designed to suckle foals! That could only mean…<br />
<br />
Oh nonono... oh God no!<br />
<br />
You hadn’t thought to look, of course you hadn’t! But this… now it was a certainty. You were no longer a he! You were a she! You were not just a horse; you were a mare!</p>
