<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This chapter will be done in first person</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I went home afterward. My ass is sore and dripping wet with cum. My groin is red and throbbing. This pain is intensified now that I’m a child. I returned home waddling with a loose grip over my things. Luckily, my new parents haven’t seen me enter the house with one arm gripping my stomach from the pain. I spent most of the day cleaning this new body and getting myself acquainted. I slept heavily that night. I didn’t wake until the afternoon of the next day.<br />
<br />
After that day, Dan stopped talking to me. Our parents noticed the distance brewing between us but dismissed it as something inevitable. We&#39;re growing older, they said. Our interests would soon diverge. It happened to my new father and his siblings. It’d happen to us as well. Although, there were times when the situation demanded that we talk with each other. It pains Dan to see and hear his little brother knowing that I am not his actual brother. <br />
<br />
Then there were nights when he would barge into my room, fully drunk from the booze he had with his friends. He’d climb on top of me and pull my pajamas open. He’d fuck me bloody on those nights. We may have done this several times already but my asshole is still not as large as his throbbing member. He’d cum inside me and leave me like a ragdoll once he’s finished.<br />
<br />
I know he&#39;s angry for taking over the life of his younger brother. This is his way of hurting me, I suppose. This is his retribution.<br />
<br />
I don&#39;t complain though. He’s my only source of sexual pleasure in this young body, aside from masturbating with my 4-inch dick. This body still isn’t used to the pain of being sodomized by his 8-inch dick. My tight little asshole isn’t helping either. Although, this body is beginning to find the actual joys behind the pain. And despite using me as his cum bucket, he would sometimes do the bare minimum of leaving me satisfied. He’d use one of his large hands to fondle my nipples and the other to rub against my groin. I’d cum between his fingers and he’d curse me for it. But I knew deep down, he liked it whenever I did that. I’d follow him afterward and see him lick my cum on his fingers. <br />
<br />
Besides that, I could still call myself lucky for he hasn’t seen the golden zipper yet. Maybe he saw it and didn’t think much of it.<br />
<br />
Speaking of the zipper. During my third month in this stolen life, the zipper fell off my back. With focus, I could reattach and remove it at will. I don’t remember this from the artifact’s rules. Maybe my eyes missed it or it’s one of those hidden features.<br />
<br />
I kept the zipper beside me at all times. I bring it to school, to the pool, everywhere. And so far, it is my best-kept secret. Even though I’m not planning on using the zipper in the immediate future, I still don’t want to lose it. <br />
<br />
As for the following years, it’s been a breeze. With my prior knowledge and wisdom, the elementary curricula are as easy as pie. My grades skyrocketed within a small window of time. Several of my teachers thought it unnatural and suspected me of cheating. They’d try to find the way I cheat but they’d always be disappointed when they could not. How could they? There is no cheating involved. The teachers would try to find retribution by always calling me during recitations. They thought they’d get me there, but they were left surprised when I gave them answers a typical Grade 7 student wouldn’t know. They left me alone after that. A few even invited me to join their academic clubs. Of course, I accepted. Much to the happiness of my parents. <br />
<br />
When I graduated with a high grade that year, I could see that Dan wasn’t too fond of it. I’m improving his brother’s life and he sees this as a lie. I’m leading the life of his brother away from what he’d do. It was also during that year when he left a few states away and never returned. During the spring breaks, he’d come home but never talk to me. He’d still do his late-night visits though. Always drunk and always cursing me for stealing his brother’s life.<br />
<br />
Having an easier time with my academics meant that I have plenty of free time to improve my current body. At the age of 14, I started lifting weights and improving my diet. It’s a lot easier when you get the momentum started at a young age. My dad is pretty supportive so he modified the deck in our backyard as a mini gym. Jon already had a bit of musculature when I stole his body. Months of regular training improved that by a lot. While I’m not overly big, it’s evident that I have a lean muscular definition even though I’m not flexing my muscles.<br />
<br />
I quit skateboarding altogether. That’s what Jon would do. And it reminds me of Dan. Instead, I found my calling in the junior baseball league. I bumped with my PE teacher in the gym once. I don’t have my shirt on so he saw the muscles hiding under my clothes. I saw his eyes widen and stare at my chest for about a minute before he broke the silence with a laugh. Since I’m the school&#39;s top student, he expected me to be a lanky guy. It’s a stereotype but he’s been working in this school for years and that has always been the case. Seeing how lean I am, he had me referred to a colleague of his, a baseball coach for a junior’s league. <br />
<br />
It was a rough start. Unlike my academics, I have no prior knowledge of baseball. I don’t even know how it’s played. All I know is someone throws the ball and somebody would try to catch it. As months passed and through the careful teaching of my coach, I learned how to play the game. My team isn’t the best but we’re hanging in there. Despite not winning any trophies, the people in the university have come to know my name in fame. Even my parents who thought that they could never be more proud of my achievements were surprised and amazed further.<br />
<br />
I&#39;m happy that I can experience these joys that were robbed from my previous life.<br />
<br />
I was an orphan you see. My mother, fair and kind, married the wrong man. One wrong argument with the man she thought would love her, and to the grave, she goes. CPS placed me into the system. For years, I bounced a couple of homes. I never knew any parents, only people who would take advantage of the benefits that come with me. <br />
<br />
That old life is gone. There are times that I would forget what my real name is. It’s been so long since somebody called by that name. Now, there&#39;s only Jon Coriolis. Me.<br />
<br />
A few more years would pass and I’ve grown into the fine man I always dreamed to be. All my needs were met and I grew to the extent of my potential. I remained at the top of the class and remained that way even though I grew past the help of my previous life. Years would pass until I become a college student, but even now, some universities have already reached out about their scholarship programs. <br />
<br />
Not only that, my baseball career proved fruitful. I admit. I’m not the best but some people would say that I’m up there - for this state, at least. If becoming the smartest guy in the school wasn’t enough, becoming a baseball player many of the students know amped my social credit. Famous and cool students became close contacts. Son of local politicians, daughters of businessmen, future doctors, and lawyers due to nepotism, you name it. They kept me close and treated me as an equal even though I’m not as rich nor powerful as they are.<br />
<br />
But some get a little jealous of the achievements I’ve accrued all these years. They are jealous because I’m stealing the fame and opportunity away from them. When people such as these appear, they meet the Zipper.<br />
<br />
Before I talk about the zipper, one must know that despite the fame and becoming one of the cool kids, I still have a circle of friends one could define as nerds or geeks. Mostly co-members from the math or literary club. One of them is Kyle Mitchell. While I’m always the first place, he’s always the second. He never gets envious of it, though. It’s a friendly rivalry that goes between us.<br />
<br />
Now back to the Zipper. I mentioned the people who are jealous of my achievements. About half of them would step over the line and make attempts to steal the spotlight away from me. The latest one is Antonio Vici. He’s a transfer student from Europe and boasted that he came from a royal line or something. He said it at a party after our latest baseball tournament win, and I was too hammered to remember a word-per-word of what he said. He was flustered when nobody was amazed by his story. All eyes were on me after I carried that last game. In retaliation, he attempted to embarrass me by tripping me in the hallway the next morning. Luckily, Kyle was there and caught me before I planted my face on the floor. <br />
<br />
That afternoon after school, Antonio came to me behind the school with tied hands and a gagged mouth. Kyle, who abandoned his old unstructured life and whom I placed in a footballer’s body, stood over Antonio and kept him from escaping. I had Antonio stripped and laid on his stomach in a stolen gurney we stole from the school clinic. Antonio tried to trash his limbs. He’s strong and somewhat lean given his swimmer’s build. It’s a compliment that I’ll spare to him. But he is powerless against my and Kyle’s combined strength. <br />
<br />
Once secure, I called the person in the shadows. Ian Lee, a pale-skinned transferee who didn’t quite fit in with the crowd. I’ve come to know his name through the grapevine. A new student who’s a loner. Despite being in this city for a year already, he never had any friends. There’s no reason to avoid him but people do because that’s what previous people had done. He’s the perfect candidate for my growing list of ‘associates’.<br />
<br />
Ian Lee came out of the shadows. Despite the orangeness of the setting sun, his pale skin remained in bright contrast. His limbs are noodles and pasty. His face is a pollock painting of acne scars. I had him remove the towel wrapped around his waist which revealed his sorry state of dick.<br />
<br />
No matter. That would change after this. <br />
<br />
I set up a camera and took a video of the following events. It’s a precaution if one of my associates dare try to speak of the Zipper.<br />
<br />
Antonio ceased his feeble attempts at escaping when I laid the golden zipper on his back. The paralytic effect of the zipper is instantaneous but being careful doesn’t hurt. I slipped a finger in his asshole and squeezed his balls. No response. He’s still warm and his heart is beating, but there’s nothing conscious in those wide-open eyes. <br />
<br />
I pulled the tab, and let the warm moist air simmer out. Once done, I picked Ian up and helped him wear the suit. I helped him fit the feet, arms, torso, and head. I closed the seams and pulled the zipper away. It takes a few seconds before the new mind melds into the body. When Ian- err… Antonio said the security word I gave Ian, I removed his bindings and gave him his clothes.<br />
<br />
The jerk Antonio is gone, replaced by a person who is eternally indebted to me. The new Antonio touched his new body and laughed in joy when he realized how hard his muscles are. He was even happier when he saw the 7-inch flaccid dick hanging between his legs. I even offered to test his package out on my asshole. He’s happy to oblige of course even though he’s straight. Flipping to a different gender is easier when the real Antonio is gay from the start. <br />
<br />
Antonio fucked me behind the school ground like numerous others. Kyle is not keen to be left out of the fun. He pulled out his even longer dick and I sucked it every last drop of cum.<br />
<br />
After that test drive, we cleaned ourselves in the gym showers. We even helped each other scrub the spots we can’t quite reach. As the night nears, I reminded Antonio to keep in touch and forget his old life. <br />
<br />
Transactions like this are a two-way street. I don&#39;t demand money. The occasional monetary gifts are welcome though. What I want is their loyalty and the connection they’ll provide in the present and the future. In case I somehow got arrested, Oliver, whom I put in Lyle Donovich’s body, would help me out since his new father is a lawyer. When I want a front seat in the local cinema, Richter would prepare me one since I placed him in Jeremy Crabbe’s body, a soccer player who currently works as a cinema usher. I gave them a new life. I made them handsome. I made them strong. I made them rich and powerful. People who felt like they were born in the wrong gender, I used my power to place them in the right one. Sharing the benefits that would come with their new life is the least they could do.<br />
<br />
Although, this did not come without repercussions. The city caught wind of the rise of missing students from this school. Many investigators were called but they could not find any traces. The students were suddenly gone and never to return, leaving no final message nor clues that would point to their whereabouts. Which is good. No clues mean they have no avenues of tracing it back to me. <br />
<br />
I’m also quite blessed because none of my ‘associates’ have blurted about the zipper. I guess the blackmail videos I take while they are stealing the lives of another is the reason why they haven’t blabbered out. Maybe it’s also their thanks for giving them a new chance at a better life. Or maybe it’s fear knowing that I could easily take what I easily gave to them. They are afraid to return to their old miserable lives.</p>
