<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Schoolgirl with a crush was a pretty apt description of Heather Tillstrom. She was 19 years old and struggling to afford her college tuition, which was why she&#39;d taken - and kept, despite her monstrous boss - this job at Belville Cosmetics. Heather was organised and thorough, but had little experience in, well, anything really. Sometimes she thought the only reason she got the job was because no one else could put up with Mrs Belville&#39;s moods. Truth be told, there was one more reason why Heather stayed on besides the money, she did have just a teensy crush on her boss. With her flame red locks and statuesque body, there was just something... wild, about Donna Belville. And that was before this morning. Heather had no idea what had happened to Mrs Belville overnight, but as she stormed through the corridors towards her this morning she saw a lot of differences. The muscles in her toned arms stood out more than usual and her hair was all over the place, more like an unruly mane than the neatly styled hair of the head of a cosmetics firm. And was she... taller? No, that wasn&#39;t possible. But Heather also thought she could see fangs as Mrs Belville growled at her on her way past, demanding coffee.<br />
<br />
As she did every morning Heather took her boss&#39;s bag through into her office and switched on the coffee machine. Mrs Belville&#39;s office was huge, lavishly appointed with thick exotic rugs and ornate mirrors. That woman must enjoy her own reflection. Heather smiled weakly, she&#39;d enjoy her reflection too if she had a body like Mrs Belville&#39;s. She pushed a few limp strands of blonde hair out of her her eyes and examined her own reflection. Heather was short, slim and pale, limp blonde hair hugging her head and hanging down to her shoulders. She was pretty in a girl next door kinda way, but was never going to set hearts racing. As she waited for the water to heat up, Heather noticed a flask of coffee sticking out of Donna&#39;s bag. There was only enough in the machine for a single cup, and Heather was thirsty. Shrugging her shoulders she opened the flask and took a swig.<br />
<br />
Donna had only been in the mornings first meeting twenty minutes and already she was bored, struggling to listen to petty people talk about boring things. Instead her mind kept drifting back to the dreams she&#39;d had the night before. Dreams of being taken savagely, and taking others in turn. Dreams filled with tongues, and cocks and pussies. Men and women coated with hair and sporting claws and fangs, horns and wings and hooves. People stuck halfway between man and beast making her cum over and over. And then later, after she&#39;d woken and forced herself on her sexy young maid, her own body had changed to be like those in her dream. She knew the whole thing should have been terrifying, but instead it felt natural, exciting even. She longed to experience the sex and transformation again. Instead she was stuck in a meeting, struggling not to scratch at her itchy pits and crotch. Sometime later her PA came in to give her a fresh cup of coffee. Sipping the scalding hot liquid brought her back to her senses and she started paying more attention to those around her, including Aisha. Donna had never really noticed Aisha before, not how she was noticing her now anyway. She enjoyed the womans thick black brows and the downy hairs that covered the space in front of her ear from her hair down to her jaw. Dropping her eyes to where Aisha&#39;s exposed forearms lay on the table Donna couldn&#39;t help but notice the rather thick dusting of black hairs that sprouted there too, marching up until they disappeared into her sleeve. Donna had never appreciated body hair on women before - just ask Sierra! - but now she found it intoxicating. Aisha&#39;s sexy black body hair reminded her of her own wild side, and she spent the remainder of the meeting imaging just how sexy Aisha would be fully beasted out like she had been that morning. A tiny bit of drool escaped from the corner of her mouth.<br />
<br />
Aisha was trying to concentrate on the meeting, but instead kept focussing on Mrs Belville. Why was she staring at her? Her boss&#39;s eyes kept looking at her hands on the desk, was she looking at her hairy arms? Aisha has always been a little self concious of them, and she knew Mrs Belville didn&#39;t approve of body hair on anyone, especially women. Self concsiously she tried to pull her sleeves down further.<br />
<br />
Heather sat at her desk, bored. She&#39;d already checked and cleared her boss&#39;s email and sorted her calendar, there really wasn&#39;t much else to do. Her eyes drifted over to the clock - it was late afternoon already, but she couldn&#39;t leave before Mrs Belville. Instead she idly clicked through website after website. Heather had started to feel warm at lunch time, making her sweat slightly, but it had past quickly. As she sat there now, the warmth came back, along with another sensation - arousal. Under her shirt her nipples crunched to attention, and a pleasant gentle tingling sensation emanated from her crotch. Heather briefly considered using her work computer to look up porn, but swiftly deicded against it. She&#39;d take care of herself once she finally got home, or maybe she could find somewhere here?<br />
<br />
Donna leant against the door of the womens bathroom. She&#39;d been in there twently minutes already, and she strongly suspected that whatever had happened to her that morning was going to happen again. She&#39;d been scratching at herself all day and noticed the red hairs on her arms had started to grow back, and based on the sensations she was getting the same thing was happening under clothes too. A look in her hand mirror had shown that her eyebrows had grown wild and bushy and were again meeting in the middle, she was worried  what her staff would think. Also, the mild horniness she&#39;d been feeling all day was growing too. Her cunning plan had been to lock herself in the bathroom and wait for everyone else to leave. As she leant against the door she brought up one of her hands to knead at a breast. The nipple instantly became erect, tenting the front of her blouse. Quickly losing control, her other hand plunged into her wet and aching pussy and started rubbing vigorously. She barely noticed that a thick red bush of hair had sprouted, from her belly button right on down to practically her knees. Donna was panting and growling like an animal, and it took only a few minutes of stimulation to bring herself to climax. The orgasm took some time to subside and when it finally did Donna fell forwards, catching herself on the sink. She heard her nails clink loudly against the porcelain. Donna looked up at her reflection, already knowing what she would see, and excited by it. Her body hair had returned in all it&#39;s glory. Thick red hair, almost fur covered her lower legs. Wiry pubic hairs sprouted from midway up her thighs, obscuring her pussy completely before forming an upwards arrow on her muscular lower belly. Hair similar to that on her lower legs covered Donna&#39;s forearms and the backs of her hands, and her pits exploded with curly red hairs. Along with the fangs and claws, and her muscular body, Donna looked as though she was frozen on the cusp of turning into a werewolf. Donna snarled as she left the bathroom, and headed for her office.</p>
