<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He hadn&#39;t known Ashley for even a DAY and already they were kissing and hugging, he wondered if chemistry like that actually existed, or whether it was again something the ring itself had done. <br />
<br />
Since she was just living air and rubber, Casper wondered how Ashley digested anything she ate or drank into her own body. One of the many mysteries Casper hadn&#39;t thought about when ordering the ring. <br />
<br />
What was also interesting now that he thought about was that Ashley had accepted what he said without any trouble, instead of thinking he was just crazy. Maybe an effect of the ring itself?<br />
<br />
He had rather calmly accepted Lana and Tommy&#39;s own story about &#39;Larry&#39; and &#39;Tabitha&#39;s&#39; now that he thought about that too. They had even told him that before they had both failed to make the cut, and had bought the trinkets from the wizard, but had accidentally used each other&#39;s, but both were now perfectly happy with their new lots in life and didn&#39;t WANT to be changed back they told him. He wasn&#39;t sure why they told him, maybe they just wanted to share, or those who went to the wizard&#39;s store felt compelled to advertise via word of mouth. <br />
<br />
Casper admitted it was a bit annoying that he couldn&#39;t see as much of the changes due to the uniforms, but admitted it might make less sense without them. <br />
<br />
Ashley gave him a slight nudge with her elbow. &quot;You know. It&#39;s kinda unfair that Tommy&#39;s the only Synthetic on the team and Lana the only Synthetic on the cheer squad, kinda an unfair advantage isn&#39;t it?&quot; She said slyly. <br />
<br />
&quot;And wouldn&#39;t it then be unfair to any team or squad they played again?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll have to fix that then won&#39;t we?&quot; She grinned. <br />
<br />
&quot;By we, meaning me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess I&#39;ll be attending a lot of football games.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you mean WE will be attending a lot of football games?&quot;<br />
<br />
Casper smiled. &quot;Heh, I guess you&#39;re right.&quot; Truth be told, Casper couldn&#39;t have cared less about football and the like, but this could make the games a bit more interesting for him. He wondered about some uniforms, and wondered if they&#39;d become less as naked rubber anthro norms began to out-weight human ones, naked bull men playing football was an entertaining image (it&#39;s not like Tommy NEEDED a cup now, Casper seriously doubted he was wearing one), but that was for later, this was now. <br />
<br />
First he decided to experiment a bit on the couch. He tried to change him into a rubber anthro beetle, crab, lobster, wasp, spider, earth worm, slug, but none of them worked. It seemed boneless animals and invertebrate  in general seemed out outside the ring&#39;s abilities (ironic sine the rubber anthros themselves didn&#39;t have any bones). <br />
<br />
There were ten girls on the cheer squad practicing not counting Lana, and ten more football players besides Tommy. <br />
<br />
Well, it seemed the rubber anthros were about to push past being less than fifty of them. He&#39;d change the couch after he&#39;d was done with the team and squad. <br />
<br />
He started with the football team. Since Tommy was bonze color. It was best perhaps to continue with that theme. <br />
<br />
Like when he had changed the swim team, Casper felt the ring glow warm on his hand. The football players who were now dwarfed by Tommy, grew bigger and bigger, their uniforms growing to match. Cleats and socks vanished, unlike Tommy they were all monocolor with their hooves and horns matching the rest of them as they came in, making Tommy still stand out from the rest. <br />
<br />
Their tails came out of the holes in their pants, however, they began to wrap their tails around their waists, Casper guessed that was practical in a full contact game like tackle football. <br />
<br />
In a way, Casper realized he was doing them a favor, none of them would be suffering brain damage in their later years from years of tackle football. <br />
<br />
The other players in their uniforms grew until they were the same size as Tommy (some a bit bigger, some a bit smaller, they weren&#39;t clones). Their faces and helmets changed and the nearly dozen rubber minotaurs all bellowed and rammed into each other like a small two way stampede. Casper admitted they seemed rather sturdy for being made of rubber and air, as they didn&#39;t go flying through the air, then again, tire of monster trucks were made of rubber too.  With Tommy being colored bronze, the other minotaurs were: Silver. Gold. Copper. Electrum. Platinum. Brass.  Iron. <br />
Mercury. Steel. And Chrome. They were all clearly still made out of latext, but their colors shinned off their exposed horns and tails as they played. <br />
<br />
He actually saw one accidentally hit a head butt right between the legs . . . didn&#39;t even flinch, shrugged, helped his team mate off the ground, and continued practicing. Guess that confirmed there was no longer anything sensitive in that area. Their rubber horns hadn&#39;t popped each other either. Casper wondered if the rubber anthros themselves had innate magical traits beyond the obvious. <br />
<br />
Next he turned his attention to Lana and her friends. <br />
<br />
Right now the eleven girls were doing high kicks. Perfect. Casper felt the ring get warm on his finger again, and the cheer leaders changed. <br />
<br />
Lana was already the bright red vixen. The other girls became other bright colors. Their shoes and socks vanished along with anything else that wasn&#39;t part of their uniforms. <br />
<br />
Their skins turned bright colors, losing all body hair, Casper also noted that any piercings or tattoos any of the girls had (few as they were) also vanished into thin air, having never been. <br />
<br />
About half of them had white &#39;socks&#39; and &#39;gloves&#39; opposed to black like Lana, and a couple others had darker or lighter tones of the rest of their bodies for their markings instead. <br />
<br />
Their tails emerged from their skirts that now had a hole to accommodate them and a simple buckle to keep the hole in place so the vixens didn&#39;t need to push their tails all the way through. <br />
<br />
With the high kicks, Casper saw the barcodes on each of their behinds, along with the smooth latex between their legs in place anything resembling womanhood. Technically as genderless as dolls. <br />
<br />
Their faces transformed, becoming similar, but not identical to Lana. <br />
<br />
They didn&#39;t so much as ONCE break their routine, but they did turn and spin their rubbery fox tails a few times. <br />
<br />
With Lana being red, the others were: Blue. Purple. Green. Orange (she was one with white &#39;gloves&#39; and had blue eyes). Sunny yellow. Pink (of course). Teal. Violet. White. And black (for the record, she started out as a Caucasian). <br />
<br />
Casper noted the green fox girl kept her pony tail, the same color as the rest of her &#39;skin&#39;, and the purple one kept her pig-tails, that seemed to be a PART of them rather than simple dead hair. <br />
<br />
The way they squeaked as they performed their routines, and actually threw some tricks that took advantage of the simple fact that they lacked a skeleton, was music to Casper&#39;s ears. <br />
<br />
He causally noted that some of them seemed to have been impressively upgraded in the chest department even thought he had not been consciously thinking about that, then again, he hadn&#39;t been consciously thinking of all rubber anthros being fairly decent people and that too seemed to happen. Maybe it was something the girls themselves had wanted. <br />
<br />
The ones whose chests had, heh, ballooned just continued their routines. Their beasts of air and rubber bouncing up and down and the vixens themselves showing no back trouble or strain, then again, their bodies were air and latex, it wasn&#39;t like they&#39;d weight that much. <br />
<br />
&quot;You won&#39;t make the cheer squads and players of the other teams all foxes and bulls will you?&quot; Ashley asked. Casper remembered how she had dislike the idea of there being &#39;too many&#39; otter TFs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Naw. Just thought if they were going to have uniforms, maybe being a bit uniform was a little fitting. Besides, it&#39;ll get interesting once the ones who go off to play or cheer professionally change teams or get traded. Maybe I&#39;ll make all of the next team rhinos, and their cheer leaders, cat girls, gotta admit would be a sight to see.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes . . . heh, it would. Whao, memory shift coming in. Twenty more of us. Our little community is getting bigger. We no longer hold our new years party in a single hotel room each year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Feel lonely being the only lizard rubber anthro around?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Naw. We&#39;re all Synthetics, what difference does it make? I just like diversity as long as we have the power to do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Casper admitted he liked it when Ashley said &#39;we&#39; about this.  <br />
<br />
&quot;So what are ya gonna fix up the couch into?&quot; Ashley asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm. Not sure. Let&#39;s just see what comes to mind.&quot; Making him a bull or a fox didn&#39;t seem right after doing so the cheers leaders and football players. Then he decided.<br />
<br />
Like the orca for the youth swim team, the only thing the couch kept on his body was his whistle, still holding his clip board. <br />
<br />
His body turned a brownish gold as all hair vanished, his manehood good, with molding lines that around around his body like an outline. His belly button replaced with a nozzle. He got bigger. A bar code appearing where it belonged. His feet became huge paws, and his hands became rubber paws with thumbs with rubber claws. Above his sealed up rear was a nice round ball of latex that was his tail. He growled a bit indifferently looking at his clipboard. His nipples were no more, and had never been as his ears became round and moved to the top of his bald head, his face pushing out into a bear muzzle. He looked like he could easily take on any of the bulls in arm wrestling. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it boys! Keep it up!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s big,&quot; Ashley admitted as she felt her memories change to match. <br />
<br />
&quot;You show&#39;em pop!&quot; <br />
<br />
Casper and Ashley both turned their heads. They had been so focused on the couch they hadn&#39;t noticed the boy sitting in the stands changing too, changing shape much like the couch, except he was cobalt blue, and was wearing a cap with the team&#39;s logo on it. His bare-naked blue barcoded butt sitting in the stands a while down and to the side of the pair, a stack of comics and a game boy next to him. The couch waved at the little rubber inflated bear cub. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot; Casper gasped out confused.<br />
<br />
Ashley searched her memories. &quot;Oh right, that&#39;s the couch&#39;s son.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;His son? But-but how?&quot; <br />
<br />
The first time ever, the ring it could be said SPOKE to Casper, not in words, but in ideas. Not in an language that could be misinterpreted, but with concepts. The wizard said this would eventually happened too, as the ring learned from Casper.<br />
<br />
Casper said, &quot;It&#39;s, it&#39;s because since his father is a rubber anthro, his son logically had to be one too, since regardless of how Synthetics are born or created, it would be logically for his child to be human when he himself clearly isn&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that makes things interesting.&quot; Ashley admitted, &quot;I guess if we ever go have some fun at an old folks home, we&#39;ll get a lot of bonus Synthetics out of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True that,&quot; Casper said. Wondering what other powers the ring held. a</p>
