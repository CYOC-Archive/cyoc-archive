<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vic thought the first night sharing his bed with Trey would be awkward. In fact he almost insisted the two of them sleep separately, but Trey had climbed into the bed before Vic even had a chance to broach the subject. He knew this wasn&#39;t actually the first time he shared the bed with him, but it was the first where he was aware of it. But once he was settled in, Trey wrapped and arm around him pulling him close, his furry chest and stomach pressed up against Vic&#39;s back. It was the most comfortable he had ever been in that bed. The second night it was much easier to crawl into those strong arms. The days had been mostly filled with eating and some light play between them. Not full on sex, but making out and hand jobs were always on offer from Trey. Any questions were rebuffed with a comment of, &quot;No rush, we have plenty of time, you need to relax.&quot; So Vic stopped asking. Though he found out they shared a love of cooking shows and movies with car chases, which was how they burned away a few more hours.<br />
<br />
Vic was also rebuffed at any question of going out. Trey said he&#39;d handle it, and often had to go out to restock the groceries that Vic was plowing through with aplomb. Strangely, beyond that first ten pounds he hadn&#39;t felt like he put on much weight. Not until third morning, where he was standing on the scale, staring down at a higher number than he had ever seen in his life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Another fifteen pounds?!&quot; Vic griped, stepping off the scale. He placed his hands on his stomach and gave it a little jiggle. It didn&#39;t seem bigger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, you&#39;ve been eating everything in sight.&quot; Trey was watching Vic from the bed, obviously enjoying the show of the smaller man puttering around in the bathroom. Yesterday afternoon Trey had taken to walking around naked, his thick cock on display. Vic had decided to join him and had stripped off his clothes as well, they were uncomfortable anyway. A touch too tight. &quot;It&#39;s doing wonders for your butt.&quot; He said teasingly, making Vic reach behind him and grab a handful of butt cheek, it did seem more.. round. And firm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn&#39;t I be exercising?&quot; Vic asked as he ran his hands over his body, trying to figure out where those pounds were. His arms felt thicker, and when he flexed them, he could actually notice his bicep popping out slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to one of the benefits of being us. Minimal effort to be sexy as hell.&quot; Trey quipped, lifting one arm to flex it, the muscles bulging.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I&#39;m just going to keep putting on weight?&quot; Vic sighed as he turned to look at himself in the mirror. He hadn&#39;t shaved in the last few days being off work, and it wasn&#39;t just a little stubble on his face, it was almost a short beard.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the next month, yeah.&quot; Vic said, going back to playing on his phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t people going to notice?&quot; Vic grabbed his shaving cream, spraying some in his hand and lathering up his face. He had called out the last few days from work, but he didn&#39;t want to burn all his sick leave, and he thought he was feeling good enough to at least log in today. He thanked whatever power that was looking out for him he worked from home.<br />
<br />
Trey sighed and rested the phone on  his chest, looking at Vic. &quot;Of course they will, people aren&#39;t idiots. That&#39;s why most of us uproot ourselves and go somewhere else to set our lives back up, somewhere no one knows us. Cut off our old ties..&quot; He sighed as Vic looked his way, shock causing the younger man to go wide eyed. &quot;I was trying to spare you that part a few more days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not going to..&quot; Vic started but Trey held up a hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can talk about it later. And I wouldn&#39;t bother with that.&quot; He said, motioning to the lather on Vic&#39;s face. &quot;We&#39;re hairy bastards, most of you may still be smooth as a baby, but don&#39;t expect that to last. And the beards are the worst. Stop shaving and get used to trimming, trust me. Besides, it looks good on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vic let himself be distracted from the moving argument, instead grabbing a towel and wiping off the lather. Actually looking at himself in the mirror he had to agree. His beard was less splotchy and had filled in over the last few days, and now it actually looked decent, and helped lessen his baby face. He actually looked his age for once. &quot;How much am I going to change?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trey didn&#39;t answer, instead he held up a finger and flipped through his phone, then held it out. Vic walked from the bathroom to take it. The picture was of a handsome young man, fit, but very lean. Medium height if Vic guessed right. A shock of blond hair on his head. Shirtless at the beach he could see a thin line of hair up the middle of the young man&#39;s abdominals with a smooth chest. Vic looked up at Trey, who nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Took that on my thirtieth birthday, ten days before my first moon.&quot; Trey grinned, patting his stomach. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t believe it, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were cute.&quot; Vic said, and realized he meant it. Maybe his tastes were changing along with his body. Before he&#39;d look at this guy and know he&#39;s good looking but have no interest in him. Now he found appeal in looking at him, then he looked up to Trey and felt that attraction even more strongly as he looked at him. &quot;Now you&#39;re a sexy beast.&quot; He added, making Trey smile.<br />
<br />
Vic started going through his dresser, pulling on some underwear and an undershirt, both of which were a bit on the tight side as he pulled them on, the shirt even rode up a couple inches exposing some of his stomach. HE just grumbled and pulled out a button up shirt which didn&#39;t fit much better.<br />
<br />
&quot;As much as I enjoy watching you, what are you doing?&quot; Trey asked, looking up from his phone again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have work.&quot; Vic said simply, having to tug the shirt to get the buttons done.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should probably quit. Better to do it now.&quot; Trey held up a placating hand as Vic turned on him with a flash of anger.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like my job. And it&#39;s remote, most of my coworkers have never seen me below the shoulders. I can pass off a new beard.&quot; Vic muttered as he turned away, still struggling with the buttons.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d be surprised what people notice, even just over a webcam. We need to keep some things a secret, like I said, it&#39;s best if you..&quot; Trey cut off as Vic slammed his hand on the top of the dresser. He rounded on Trey, about to shout, when one of the buttons on his shirt popped off and went pinging across the room. The ridiculousness of it defused most of the anger, though Trey motioned. &quot;And when your clothes no longer fit? I&#39;m not buying you in between clothes you&#39;ll just outgrow in a few days, we need you to finish bulking up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stubbornly, Vic pulled a tie out of his drawer, quickly knotting it and using it to cover the missing buttons, and the others which were obviously straining. &quot;Problem solved.&quot; He said, spreading his arms wide. But when Vic met Trey&#39;s eyes, serious and worried, he let out a long sigh and dropped his arms. &quot;I&#39;ll find an excuse to put in for leave for the rest of the month. That&#39;s as much as I&#39;ll do for now. But I need to at least make an appearance today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trey slid over to the side of the bed and reached out for Vic&#39;s hand, pulling him in closer. Putting a hand on Vic&#39;s shoulder, Trey pulled him down for a kiss. It wasn&#39;t forceful, or eager, or a bid for sex. It was simple and easy, a pure display of affection and Vic felt himself melting a little inside, knowing Trey was just looking out for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll talk to Lou, and spend the rest of the day handing off my projects. Can you keep yourself entertained?&quot; Vic said after the kiss.<br />
<br />
Trey just laughed. &quot;I&#39;ll be fine, let me know if you want me to make you something to eat.&quot; Vic grinned and turned to head to the office. &quot;You&#39;re not wearing pants, hun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vic looked down, then over at Trey. &quot;I&#39;ll be in a chair. Besides, I&#39;m not sure they&#39;ll fit.&quot; Then winked and headed out.<br />
<br />
Inside his office, he closed the door behind him and leaned back against it. He looked at the computer warily before sitting himself down and pinging Lou for a meeting.<br />
<br />
A few hours later Vic his send on another email, handing off the reins on another one of his projects, this time to Dave. A freshly made plate of steak and eggs sat waiting for him courtesy Trey. Everything the man made tasted fantastic, he wondered if he had been a chef in his previous life. The thought made him realize he knew very little about Trey personally other than he had a brother, and Trey didn&#39;t ask a whole lot about his personal life in return. He had to wonder if that was part of this whole starting over thing, making a clean cut.<br />
<br />
He marked himself on break and started to dig into his meal, only for his phone to ring. He answered it, setting it to speaker so he could shovel food in his mouth, not paying attention to who was even calling.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Vic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Victor you sack of shit.&quot; Came Trish&#39;s voice over the phone, he knew she was joking, probably. &quot;You take someone home from the bar, give me a few vague texts about having them around for the weekend, and nothing since then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I was sick the last few days, and now I&#39;m having to deal with some stuff at work, and..&quot; Vic was going to go on, but Trish cut him off.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I found out from Becca that you left the bar with, and I quote, &#39;The biggest muscle bear she&#39;s ever seen&#39;?&quot; Trish was working herself up into one of her fits. &quot;Vic! I told you the day I realized I was into women, you were the first I told, and you&#39;ve been in the closet this whole time without telling me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vic gulped down a bit of steak and stared at the phone. &quot;Vic, you there?&quot;<br />
<br />
He sighed and set down  his fork. &quot;Okay, that&#39;s true, but hear me out. I didn&#39;t plan it, it just kind of happened, he came up to me and..&quot;<br />
<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
Vic stood at the table, shifting his beer about on the table top as Trish went off to the bathroom. Knowing her she&#39;d be gone for a good fifteen minutes. Without his wingman, he knew he&#39;d be useless trying to pick someone up, so he dug his phone out of his pocket to at least amuse himself until she got back. That was until a deep gruff voice reached his ears. &quot;Excuse me.&quot;<br />
<br />
That couldn&#39;t have been meant for him, but he looked up into a beaming and blond bearded face, icy blue eyes looking right at him. &quot;I noticed you were alone and thought you could use some company.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vic had been in situations like this before. Trish called it his big twink energy. Even in bars that weren&#39;t specifically gay bars he had a knack for attracting men, but this was one of the burliest and biggest that had ever approached him. He got ready to give his usual speech of being flattered but not interested. Instead he opened his mouth and said, &quot;Yeah, I could, I&#39;m Vic.&quot; He said, holding out his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trey.&quot; The man replied, taking Vic&#39;s hand in a vice like grip, firm enough to show strength, but easy, and lingering perhaps a few seconds too long.<br />
<br />
Vic found himself pulled to the man, and for the first time in his life he noticed just how appealing those strong masculine features were, a musky, woodsy scent of some sort that tickled his brain, and a longing to feel those arms around him. Vic could barely believe his own ears as he spoke up. &quot;You know, it&#39;s my birthday and I&#39;m looking for someone to celebrate with. My apartment is only a few blocks away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Happy birthday.&quot; Trey said, leaning in towards Vic to speak to him more easily. &quot;I&#39;d be honored to help you celebrate.&quot; That kind, friendly smile turning a bit, eager and Vic would almost say hungry, but it only made Vic more enticed.<br />
<br />
Vic slipped his hand once more into Trey&#39;s, leading him out of the bar and into the warm summer night, the full moon just starting to peek over the horizon.<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Vic? Vic!? VICTOR!?&quot; Trish&#39;s voice finally snapped him out of his reverie. It was the first complete memory of the missing weekend that came back to him, and he was still processing the fact he was the one to proposition Trey, he thought it would have been the other way around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, yeah, I&#39;m here.&quot; Vic said lamely.<br />
<br />
&quot;I asked you if you think you&#39;re going to see him again.&quot; Trish asked, he voice going from angry to coy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, um, he&#39;s spent every night since here, so.. yes?&quot; Vic winced at the squeal that came across the line at that information.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god! We have to do drinks! Maybe we can meet up at the bar again on Friday, I&#39;d love to meet your new boyfriend.&quot; Trish was practically giddy, but Vic was blanching at the thought of being around his oldest friend. She&#39;d definitely notice the changes in him, and probably from a mile off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y.. yeah, I&#39;ll see what I can arrange. I need to get back to work. Love ya&#39;, Trish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You, too, Vic.&quot; Vic hung up the call and leaned back in his chair, staring at the wall behind his computer monitor. He already knew Trey would probably not agree, but he knew if he put of Trish she was likely to just show up at his door unannounced. He knew he couldn&#39;t keep this from Trey either, and hoped his..<br />
<br />
Boyfriend? Trish had called him his boyfriend. Was that even what they were? He sighed and slumped in his chair. This was going to be more difficult than he thought.</p>
