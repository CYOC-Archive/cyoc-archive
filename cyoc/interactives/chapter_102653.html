<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Um...er...um...&quot; was all about Claire could say her face flushed red.  Seeing Ryan as a werewolf made her a bit...hot to say the least.  Claire started to walk slowly towards Ryan when his cell phone went off.  Both of them jumped a bit at the ring tone, and then Ryan went to answer the phone.  &quot;Ryan Connor,&quot; he said into the phone.  After listening for a moment, he said, &quot;Just a moment,&quot; and then handed the phone to Claire.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; Claire asked as she took the phone up to her ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, Claire, glad I caught you,&quot; Samantha could be heard over the phone.  &quot;Am I interrupting anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh, nothing really.  We&#39;re just getting to know each other.&quot;  Claire looked up at wolf Ryan and bit her lip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure you are.&quot; Samantha responded.  &quot;Anyway, I have some news for you.  We&#39;ve arranged an apartment in the same building as Ryan.  The city will pay for it for the next two weeks and it&#39;ll be fully furnished.  I even left some literature for you to read while you&#39;re there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; Claire said as a smile spread on her lips, &quot;Thank you so much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, no problem.  Also, understand that we&#39;re watching you.  I just wanted you to know that if you do...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I know,&quot; Claire said as she interrupted Samantha.  She turned away from Ryan as she continued her conversation.   &quot;I won&#39;t do anything to reveal your secret.&quot;  While Claire&#39;s back was turned, Ryan turned back to his human form and started to get dressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, as long as you understand, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll have any problems.  Also, one more thing you should know.  No were can change you against your will.  This is another law that we have, and perhaps a bigger law than the one keeping our secret.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; Claire said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great.  I might be by later tonight to see how you&#39;re doing and if you have any questions.  You have a good evening, and remember, the best way to control wolves is with spritz of water.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire giggled a little and said, &quot;Okay, you have a good evening.  Bye.&quot;  Claire hung up the phone , and then turned back to Ryan.  She noticed that Ryan was still getting dressed, and he could see his chest once again.  She cleared his throat, and handed Ryan his phone back.  &quot;That was Samantha,&quot; she said.  &quot;She said that she had an apartment near here that I could stay at while I&#39;m here.  It&#39;s not far from here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan smiled, although there was a little bit of disappointment apparent on his face.  &quot;That&#39;s great,&quot; he said, &quot;Do you have any plans for tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not much.  Samantha&#39;s going to be coming by later tonight, so I think I&#39;m going to spend the rest of the day relaxing and cleaning myself up a bit.  I haven&#39;t had a shower in forever, and it&#39;d be nice to get into some clean clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right,&quot; Ryan said.  He opened the door for Claire to leave, &quot;I&#39;ll show you to the building manager, and we&#39;ll help you get set up.&quot;<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
After seeing the building manager and getting her apartment key, Ryan and Claire moved what stuff she had into the furnished apartment.  &quot;Hey,&quot; Claire said as she set up the last of her stuff, &quot;Thank you.  Thank you for taking care of me.  Thank you for standing up for me.  Thank you for...for...&quot;  Tears started to well up in her eyes.<br />
<br />
Ryan smiled at Claire and said, &quot;Hey, it&#39;s the least I could do for you.  I&#39;m just glad I could help.&quot;  Claire walked up to Ryan and wrapped her arms and buried her head in his chest.  Ryan simply smiled and wrapped his arms around her, allowing her to cry into him a bit.  She looked up at him, her eyes were a bit red.  Ryan, with a comforting smile on his face, simply said, &quot;It&#39;ll be ok.  Why don&#39;t you get cleaned up, relax a bit, and I&#39;ll be back later tonight with some dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire nodded her head and said, &quot;Ok.&quot;  She let go of Ryan, and Ryan let go of her.  As he walked out of the room, she closed the door after him and smiled contently as she sat down on the floor against the door.  He was really nice, she thought to herself.  She looked around the room that she was in.  While it wasn&#39;t the Hilton, it did have the basics, such as a table, a bunch of chairs, and a soft.  She looked in the bedroom and noted a dresser and a twin-sized bed with linen on it.  Finally, she went to the bathroom and saw a sink, toilet, and most importantly, a shower.  Something she hasn&#39;t seen in days now.  She started to take off her clothes as she relished the idea of cleaning the dirt and grime off of her.  After getting the towel from her backpack, she made her way to the bathroom, stripping off her clothes as she went.  Before going into the shower, she took a look at herself in the bathroom mirror.  She saw a girl that was relatively flat chested, and as thin as a rail.  If it weren&#39;t for the full bush of pubic hair, she&#39;d think that she was a girl that hasn&#39;t hit puberty yet.  What Ryan saw in her was a mystery, especially compared to the other women she saw in town.<br />
<br />
She stepped into the shower and turned on the cold water.  It felt good to her, especially after seeing Ryan.  It allowed her to cool down, so to speak, and give her time to think.  If Samantha hadn&#39;t called when she did, what would have happened?  Would she be a werewolf by now?  Is this what she wanted?  Growing up in Alaska, she didn&#39;t have much experience with boys, not counting her brothers.  She couldn&#39;t remember when she was so attracted to a guy before, and she wondered if it was because he was a werewolf, and had some animal attraction.  And did she really want to be a werewolf, or any were for that matter?  Would it be enough to be an ally?  She had dreams of being an adventurer and seeing the world.  Would becoming a were put a halt to those dreams?  There was so much to learn, and so little time to figure things out.<br />
