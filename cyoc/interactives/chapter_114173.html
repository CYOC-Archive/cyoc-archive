<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Derrick followed the trail towards the fauns, he heard both laughter and bleating.  He had intended to sneak up on the grove, but the trail suddenly dropped down and he found himself sliding into the open before he could stop.  The small pasture was thick with lush green grass, and surrounded by thick forest on all sides.  At first glance, the fauns looked like dirty, disheveled boys ranging from maybe nine or ten up to Derrick&#39;s age, as well as a bunch of goats.   The fauns were all naked except for occasional pendants, bracelets, or rings that glinted in the sunlight, with the characteristic goat hindquarters and horns. They all grinned at him, and some came over to investigate.  <br />
<br />
The closest looked to be about 14, lean and muscular like all the rest, with curly black hair and bright green eyes that were flecked with gold.  He had a kind of hopping gait, his goat legs forcing more of a strut than a walk.  The first words he spoke were unfamiliar, possibly Greek.  Then he cocked his head and asked &quot;English?  American?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;American!&quot;  Derrick felt a mixture of relief at their being able to understand him, and embarrassment to be the focus of attention.  It was obvious that at least some of the fauns were or had been engaged in sexual activities with other fauns or goats, and even though he knew this was normal behavior it was still pretty strange to see a goat mounting what looked to be a 12 year-old.   &quot;Um, I was out exploring.  Sorry.  I didn&#39;t mean to trespass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You just wanted to spy on us, then?&quot;  A red-haired faun who appeared to be no more than ten grinned at him.  Despite his youthful appearance, he was sexually endowed with a disproportionally large goat&#39;s cock and balls.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Umm, not exactly spying.  I, uh, didn&#39;t want to bother you.&quot;  Derrick flushed as more fauns came over, so that he was surrounded by naked males.  They had a randy, musky odor that was getting pretty powerful with so many there, but he liked it.   <br />
<br />
&quot;SPY!&quot;  Another faun, this one dark skinned with straight black hair, shouted gleefully and Derrick was suddenly attacked by the whole group!  He was knocked down into the thick grass, and felt hands pulling at his clothing, his arms, his hair.  His alarm faded as he realized they were not actually hurting him.  Instead, when the fauns finally released him, Derrick was stark naked.  Several of the fauns were still close enough to be touching him, and when he sat up one of them started rubbing his back.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You are not a spy now.&quot;  The older faun grinned.  &quot;Now you are a guest!  Stay and join us!  Any of us will be happy to be your brother.  Even the goats, if you want to have four legs instead of two.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Four legs?&quot;  Derrick frowned, then grinned in amazement.  &quot;Wait!  You mean I can become a goat?  Or a faun?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course!&quot;  The faun rubbing his back peered around his side - it was the redhead.  &quot;You can be anything you want here.  I&#39;d love to have a brother.  You could even be my twin!&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick looked around and realized that several of the fauns looked like twins, or at least brothers.  It was hard to tell with the animals, but even a few of them looked to have identical markings.  &quot;You know I&#39;m only here for a vacation, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure!&quot;  The older boy plopped next to him and draped an arm around his shoulder.  His breath smelled of grass and onions.  &quot;You can stay with us for your vacation, or forever.  Pick any of us, or any of the goats, as a partner, and you can be totally different - how great a vacation is that?  Or we can just change enough to make you into a faun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick wondered if he should go back and let his family know what was going on first, but then remembered he was naked.  Besides, he was really excited about the prospect of being changed here. A bit too excited, in fact, a problem that was taken care of by a blonde-haired faun about his age who lay down to take the human&#39;s comparatively small but erect cock in his mouth.  Derrick gasped as he was sucked off, also aware of many hands and bodies rubbing against him.  <br />
<br />
He came pretty quickly, and the blonde satyr looked up with a grin.  &quot;That is fast even for a human!&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick flushed when the fauns all laughed, but it did not seem mean.  He felt like a five year-old surrounded by porn stars.  &quot;What do I do?&quot;<br />
<br />
The older faun shrugged.  &quot;Depends on what you want.  Pick any of us if you want to be a brother or a twin.  The longer you stay with him, the more you will become like him.  Same for goats.  If you just want to be a faun, we&#39;ll all work on you.  Once you change you&#39;ll stay one of us until you decide to leave the resort.  And the more you change, the more fun you&#39;ll have!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about my family?  Won&#39;t they get worried?&quot;  Derrick shivered slightly at the many hands caressing his body, aroused and excited.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope!&quot;  The redhead stood up behind him and started rubbing his impressive crotch against the back of Derrick&#39;s head.  &quot;If you become a faun version of yourself, they&#39;ll accept it as normal.  And if you join us, they won&#39;t even think about you until you are ready to leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was all Derrick could do to keep from grabbing the boy behind him and pulling him around to where he could get that swelling goat cock in his mouth.  He was hot and horny, and even though he had never done anything with a male before, he wanted one of them, any of them, more than he had ever wanted anything before.  Maybe it was their scent, or it could even be some part of the magic here.<br />
<br />
Derrick looked around at the fauns, then actually did pull the redhead around into his lap and hugged him against his chest.  &quot;This is all crazy.  But I know what I want to do.&quot;</p>
