<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Why, oh why didn&#39;t they set up a place for us to stay,&quot; whined Sara as she trudged along down the street with her friends.<br />
&quot;From what I heard, our coming here was decided almost at the last minute,&quot; answered Jack.<br />
After arriving at the capital, the students and staff had dispersed to find accommodations, food, or entertainment. The actual tournament was to begin 2 days from now and registration wouldn&#39;t open till tonight at 8. Lelu was leading them down the streets to their destination. <br />
Lelu had talked up this hotel they were heading to, saying she wanted to treat her friends to a comfortable place to stay.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve also got some friends I want you to meet,&quot; she said over her shoulder. &quot;Although I doubt they&#39;ll recognize me.&quot; She grinned and flexed her arm, the bicep bulging.<br />
&quot;How would they know to meet us here,&quot; asked Beverly tilting her head.<br />
&quot;Before we left the BTC I asked Gratz to help me open a communication window to my friends asking them to meet us here.&quot;<br />
As they rounded the next corner, they saw a large 9 story building. The yellow painted sides and white trimmed windows shone in the daylight brightly.  It stretched in either direction and no one knew how far back it extended. The area in front was full of mingling people.<br />
&quot;Well, here it is. The Sleeping Drake Inn.&quot;<br />
&quot;That stopped being an inn 7 floors ago. It looked like a mansion,&quot; said Sara as she stared open mouthed at the place.<br />
&quot;Lelu took Jack by the hand and practically drug him along behind them. The others hurried to catch up to the energetic amazon. <br />
They pushed past the front doors and gazed at the foyer, a large chandelier hung high above their heads 3 floors up. 2 floors could be seen above them with railings lining the edges. People could be seen wandering around the balconies above them, chatting happily. <br />
Before they could take in anymore scenery they heard a voice call out, &quot;Lelu!&quot;<br />
Turning they saw 2 older humans walking towards them dressed in rather expensive looking clothing. <br />
Lelu rushed off and picked up both in a hug laughing excitedly. &quot;Hi mom, dad. It&#39;s been a while.&quot; She put the 2 down gently when she realized she was holding them too tightly, &quot;oops sorry.&quot;<br />
&quot;Aye, a year feels like forever when I don&#39;t see my little girl. Though not so little anymore I guess,&quot; the man chuckled after he caught his breath.<br />
&quot;We were so worried about you when we got your letter from that camp in the north. It must have been horrible,&quot; said the mother. &quot;But you look great and those bracers look amazing, I love the etching in them.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thank you, the maker is really talented,&quot; Jack felt his chest swelled with pride at the praise, &quot;and it really wasn&#39;t that bad. It was difficult at first, but once you&#39;ve gotten used to the routine, its pretty simple.&quot;<br />
&quot;I still don&#39;t understand why you didn&#39;t stay with the Mage&#39;s school,&quot; said the father as he stroked his moustache.<br />
&quot;Because I got my ass kicked at last year&#39;s tournament and needed to find something else besides magic to rely on.&quot;<br />
&quot;Young lady, language,&quot; said the mother frowning.<br />
Jack&#39;s face furrowed. &quot;What happened last year?&quot;<br />
&quot;My opponent had some kind of ability that nullified my magic, and proceeded to walk all over me.&quot;<br />
&quot;Quite so. It was fucking brutal to watch,&quot; said the father as his face fell.<br />
&quot;Harold we are in public watch your mouth too,&quot; said the woman as she smacked her husband lightly on the back.<br />
&quot;Oh please Lucille, our daughter is back ease off a little.&quot;<br />
&quot;We have an image to uphold-&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh come on. What image? Being uptight?&quot; He began to grin mischievously as he wrapped one arm around Lucille&#39;s waist and bring her closer. &quot;And as I recall, we you were pretty foul mouthed in our youth. What was it you screamed after we killed that blue dragon? &#39;Suck my cu-&#39;.&quot; Lucille covered up Harold&#39;s mouth before he could finish, her face cherry red from embarrassment.<br />
&quot;That was before we had nobility staying at our establishment.&quot; While her facial expression was embarrassment mixed with annoyance, her eyes had an amused and playful look to them. Smiling she turned to the group. &quot;We used to be dragon slayers back in our youth, but we&#39;ve since settled down.&quot; Vect suddenly began to feel nervous. He wasn&#39;t sure why, but upon hearing that Lelu&#39;s parents used to kill dragon&#39;s made him skittish. His thoughts drifted to the dragon heart stored safely in his pack. &quot;So let&#39;s show you your rooms.&quot; <br />
&quot;Shouldn&#39;t we check in with whoever is in charge,&quot; asked Sara nervously. <br />
Perplexed, Lucille tilted her head, &quot;but you already have. We own the place. Didn&#39;t Lelu tell you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oops. Guess I forgot to tell you that.&quot;<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll start with your friend Beverly. Follow me.&quot; She led them to the left side of the hotel ground floor where the halls opened up wider and taller than most places. &quot;We cater to a large amount of species and tried to make rooms that were most comfortable to certain ones like this area is meant for various Taur-types such as you Ms. Bolton.&quot; She opened a wide doorway leading into a vacant room. Inside was spacious, easily wide enough for Beverly to maneuver in, especially the shower and magical cleaning tools. The bed was low to the ground and wide enough for Beverly to lay entirely on the mattress. <br />
&quot;Thank you so much. How much is this?&quot;<br />
&quot;For my daughter&#39;s friends, nothing, just remember us when you tell others where you&#39;re staying at.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll meet you guys in the tavern at 6 tonight,&quot; Beverly said as she stepped inside.<br />
&quot;Now for your suite.&quot;<br />
<br />
The 7th floor was closer to most other hotels, just more opulent in places.<br />
&quot;Your friend would have difficulty in this area. I&#39;m sorry I had to split you up.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure she&#39;s happy getting a full shower right now,&quot; said Vect dismissively.<br />
&quot;Well here we are.&quot; Lucille opened the door and they entered into a large sized den. 2 doors on either side led into bedrooms with large sized beds. The back wall had one door for the singular bathroom for bathing exclusively. A small swimming pool sized tub occupied most of the room. Additional restrooms were located between the bedrooms via a connecting hall for them to relieve themselves.<br />
&quot;I hope you enjoy your stay here. Oh and Lelu, your friends said they&#39;ll be here around 5:30 in the tavern. Take care.&quot; Lucille closed the door and left them to sort out rooms.<br />
&quot;Lelu and I shall take the left rooms, you take the righ,&quot; said Sara.<br />
&quot;Why are we staying in separate rooms,&quot; asked Jack as he glanced at Lelu quickly.<br />
&quot;Because I have a chance to get a room to myself for once and I&#39;m not gonna pass that up.&quot;<br />
&quot;Nothing&#39;s stopping you from walking over later,&quot; added Lelu suggestively.<br />
They each left to unpack in their respective rooms. <br />
&quot;Why did I decide to cut off Vect? I might be feeling more pent up than him right now,&quot; Sara said to herself as she laid her clothing in the dresser drawers. A few weeks without having sex with Vect had left her beginning to feel drained, empty. &quot;Is this what it&#39;s like to be a succubus? Constantly needing to fuck to feel complete?&quot; She could feel herself getting annoyed. There were some benefits she admitted, flight being the most exciting part. Her tail had come in handy plenty of times, she gave it a little swing. &quot;I could do with out this at times,&quot; she frowned as she touched her bulge in her pants. It did feel good to cum from it, but it still felt so alien to her and she knew Vect had mixed feelings about it. &quot;I wish I could make it disappear when I want it to.&quot; Just as she said that Sara felt a tugging at her crotch. &quot;What now?&quot; She pulled down her pants and saw the bulge in her underwear deflate slowly. &quot;Wait what?&quot; She was getting excited as the cock and balls bulge she had had for years was gone. Her underwear still pushed out slightly from her large puffy mound and lips. &quot;Its gone,  but how.&quot; She rubbed her hairless crotch. &quot;Is it going to come back,&quot; she wondered. As if to answer her, a pushing sensation began in her crotch, pushing her hand away as her cock and balls reemerged from inside her. &quot;Can I make them disappear again at will?&quot; At the thought the tugging began and it disappeared once again. Sara was grinning excitedly. She got an idea and stuck her head out of her bedroom door. &quot;Hey Vect could you come here? I need you help reaching something.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok one moment,&quot; Vect replied as he placed the wrapped dragon heart inside a drawer with his clothing and the lamp that merchant had given to him and his gear he had brought along. He walked across the den to Sara&#39;s door and knocked. &quot;Come in.&quot;<br />
Vect entered the room to see Sara standing in the middle of the room, wings wrapped around her body like a cloak covering her torso and down to just above the knees. Vect raised an eyebrow and slowly closed the door behind him. &quot;So you said you needed help with something.&quot; He felt his member stirring below. <br />
&quot;Well,&quot; she slid one leg sideways outward from her folded wings giving Vect a clear view of her bare leg, &quot;I do need help, but I&#39;ve got a surprise for you.&quot;<br />
Sara slowly opened her wings and presented her naked body to her lover.<br />
Vect looked down in surprise to see the absence of Sara&#39;s member. &quot;Its gone?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not entirely,&quot; Sara said and let it reemerge. &quot;I can choose when I have it. I just found out.&quot;<br />
Vect looked her up and down, his member tenting his hakama. Then he frowned, &quot;is this a test or an actual invitation?&quot;<br />
Sara looked down sadly. &quot;I&#39;m not gonna lie to you, ever since the last night we spent together, I&#39;ve felt empty and slightly weaker. And I can only imagine how you&#39;ve felt. I&#39;m sorry.&quot;<br />
These past weeks Vect had felt very pent up. Getting him self off helped slightly, but he felt like he needed someone else to get a full relief. &quot;So it&#39;s an invitation?&quot;<br />
Sara rolled her eyes, &quot;get over here and fuck me you big dummy.&quot;<br />
<br />
The group met in the hotel&#39;s tavern on the bottom floor. A little after 5:45 a familiar voice called out. &quot;Hey Jack&quot; <br />
The group looked up from the large table they had taken to meet Lelu&#39;s friends. To their surprise, they saw a tall, antlered version of Mai running towards them. Trailing behind the human sized Fairy was a male naga, tattooed male half-elf, female minotaur, and a female cat folk.</p>
