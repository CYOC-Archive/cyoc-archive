<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Entering the palace, Yuriko could see that the kitsune were obviously taking no chances in regards to security. Kitsune soldiers lined the entrance ways, while watchtowers were now being built over looking the city. <br />
<br />
Despite these security improvements, Yuriko still could see the beauty of the kitsune palace. The courtyard still held the cherry blossom trees she was so accustomed too, paintings of kitsune history lined the walls, and artifacts dotted the interior. For Yuriko it often felt as if she was traveling through a living museum.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome everyone,&quot; Shizen smiled. Yuriko shook herself from her daydreaming, finding the celestial red nine tail along with her two cyber kitsune bodyguards. &quot;I&#39;ve been expecting you,&quot; she said. &quot;Allow me to introduce to you Arthur and Atlas.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two cyber kitsune now bowed respectfully. Yuriko studied the two carefully, noting they appeared to be four tailed kitsune. From there though the similarities ended. Numerous cybernetic implants were fused to the kitsune. Cybernetic tails, ocular implants, metallic breast plates, even robotic limbs adorned the them. Yuriko recognized the handiwork. It was obviously Darren that had created them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes your student gave us quite a gift,&quot; Shizen stated. &quot;These three have been most useful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll tell Darren that when I return I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be pleased,&quot; Yuriko smiled. Shizen now approached the elderly wizard, a warm smile in her face. &quot;Yuriko would it be alright if I talk with the parents, in private?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriko nodded, understanding there was private matters Shizen needed to talk about. She may have been a true ally of the kitsune but she wasn&#39;t one herself. &quot;I&#39;ll go see what Kari and Kiko are up too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shizen nodded, beckoning the kits parents forward as they now journeyed through the palace. &quot;Where is Rexie,&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She followed Sachiko and Raiden to the garden,&quot; Akira stated. Shizen chuckled, a small smile spreading across her vulpine face. &quot;Guardian cherub. Despite her mischievous nature I&#39;ve always known she had a good heart.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah Rexie is one of a kind,&quot; Ayami stated. The angel now cleared her throat as she studied the divine kitsune. Shizen was dressed in a stunning white kimono with light purple highlights. The material seeming to shimmer as it caught the sun. Ayami had always been slightly intimidated by the kitsune, her gentle nature concealing the power she had.&quot;You wished to talk with us Shizen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You need not be worried Ayami,&quot; Shizen said softly. &quot;I hold no malice towards any of you. You have done well in raising Sachiko. The kit is quite precious with a truely joyful personality.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Lady Shizen,&quot; Akira said softly, bowing his head. Shizen smiled, patting the six tailed kitsune on the shoulder. &quot;You are welcome Akira. I should honestly thank you. You have spent the last century protecting others. Putting their needs ahead of your own.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akira and Ayami blushed, thanking Shizen as she now turned to Fukushu and Abolith. Fukushu shifted slightly, raising an eyebrow as he studied his mother. &quot;I suppose you disagree with how I have raised my son.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The past is the past Jiro,&quot; she said, noting the sour look cross Aboliths face. &quot;You have raised Raiden into a thoughtful and caring boy. Protected him, cared for him. I know better than to argue with either one of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what is it you wish to talk about Shizen,&quot; Abolith asked. Shizen now stopped, turning so she that all four of them were in front of her. &quot;I will be telling the kits of their divine nature,&quot; she said. &quot;Explain what they are, their destiny. What I ask is that when they learn of this truth you help keep them balanced, humble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Humble,&quot; Fukushu asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Being told you are a god that will one day lead an entire people can go to one&#39;s head,&quot; Shizen grinned. &quot;Especially when they are told so young. Believe me I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We will do our best Lady Shizen,&quot; Akira said. &quot;I know you will Akira,&quot; she replied. Shizen now looked to her eldest, the orange nine tail giving his mother a slight nod in response. &quot;I will make sure Raiden grows to be a kind and just ruler.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shizen smiled, patting her sons shoulder as the sounds of laughter now echoed through the halls. Turning, the group now saw Sachiko, Raiden, and Rexie sprinting in their direction. &quot;Dad,&quot; Raiden exclaimed. &quot;This place is awesome!!! Did you know they have a coy pond? A huge one with like 100 fish in it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it you two had fun,&quot; Shizen asked. The kits nodded, both talking at once as they explained all the wonderful sights they had seen as well as the fun they had with Raidens cousins.<br />
<br />
&quot;The kids had fun but I&#39;m exhausted,&quot; Rexie wheezed. &quot;Do you have any idea how hard it is keeping up with two hyperactive kits?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably doesn&#39;t help that your getting a bit chunky Rexie,&quot; Ayami teased. &quot;Probably have to tell Yuriko to put you on a diet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you don&#39;t mind I&#39;d like to show Sachiko and Raiden something,&quot; Shizen stated. &quot;Wait in the parlor I will join you shortly.&quot; With that Shizen now took the kits hands, guiding them towards their destination as they continued to talk excitedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you want to show us Lady Shizen,&quot; Sachiko asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it something even cooler than s coy pond grandma,&quot; Raiden added excitedly. Shizen laughed softly. &quot;Much, much cooler. Let me show you.&quot; Sbizen now unlocked a door, pushing it open to reveal a small room adorned with portraits, scrolls, and statues. Raiden and Sachiko bounding inside, the two kits at first confused. &quot;Is this a museum grandma,&quot; Raiden asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;You could say that,&quot; Shizen smiled. Raiden and Sachiko now curiously studied the numerous paintings, pausing as they reached a pair of portraits. One showed a golden one tailed kit, adorned in a regal hikama and child sized golden armor. The other showed a red one tailed, the kit dressed in a beautiful kimono. The girl sporting a shy smile as she gazed out from her portrait. Raiden and Sachiko were both surprised as they slowly recognized who the paintings were.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandma,&quot; Raiden whispered. &quot;Is that you and grandpa?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it is,&quot; Shizen laughed, her memories reflecting on the time she had posed for this painting. &quot;This portrait was painted the day I met your grandfather. We were both around your age when that happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You look really pretty Lady Shizen,&quot; Sachiko replied. &quot;But Lord Tatsu seems really grumpy. Was he in a bad mood?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shizen laughed harder, even as a boy she remembered Tatsu always being so serious. &quot;Tatsu was always so serious about everything, even as a boy. Honestly I didn&#39;t like him that much at first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really,&quot; Raiden gasped. &quot;So what happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I got to know him better,&quot; Shizen stated. &quot;Your grandfather and your father are very similar Raiden. They are always too serious and have hot tempers. However, if you scratch the surface, see them in private. You understand that they deeply care for the ones they love.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That kinda sounds like dad but I wouldn&#39;t say that to him,&quot; Raiden whispered. &quot;He might get mad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your grandfather didn&#39;t like me pointing that out either,&quot; Shizen smirked. Taking a deep breath Shizen now smiled down on the two kits. &quot;Do you know why these paintings were made?&quot; Both kits shook their heads no, assuming that the two nine tails simply had their portraits taken because they were the leaders of the kitsune.<br />
<br />
&quot;The paintings were done because Tatsu and I were special,&quot; Shizen stated. &quot;Our people believe that a celestial kitsune will come to lead them. It was discovered when we were young that we were divine in nature, we were the legend made flesh and blood.&quot;<br />
<br />
The kits now gasped, they didn&#39;t understood kitsune legends but they were able to comprehend their meaning. &quot;So you and grandpa are Gods,&quot; Raiden stated in awe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Sachiko exclaimed. &quot;So does that mean Raidens dad is a God too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn&#39;t quite work that way,&quot; Shizen said. &quot;A celestial kitsune comes around once perhaps twice in a billion years. Only they are divine in nature, their offspring though are simply normal kitsune. Think of it like your friend the Catalyst.&quot;<br />
<br />
The kits nodded, understanding Shizens comparison. &quot;This is really cool Lady Shizen,&quot; Sachiko stated. &quot;Thank you for showing us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your very welcome child,&quot; Shizen said. &quot;But the reason I am showing you this room is because your portraits will be added here as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sachiko and Raiden paused, casting the divine nine tails a confused look. Shizen now bent down, placing her hands upon their shoulders as she gazed into their eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two are the newest celestial kitsune,&quot; she said. &quot;Someday, when you grow up you will shape the destiny of the kitsune.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re gods,&quot; Sachiko whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know,&quot; Raiden asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can feel it,&quot; Shizen stated. &quot;And so can you. Look within yourself children. Tell me? Can you sense something, a feeling, a power.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know maybe,&quot; Sachiko shrugged. Raiden remained quiet as he tried to search himself. It was odd looking into himself, he didn&#39;t feel special. Maybe this was how Darren felt. &quot;Grandma what if I don&#39;t want to be a god?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said the same thing when I was your age,&quot; Shizen said softly. &quot;And that&#39;s how I know you will be a great celestial kitsune.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So whats going to happen to us Lady Shizen,&quot; Sachiko asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing changes,&quot; she said. &quot;You will still live with your parents, you will still have all your friends. I will be visiting you often though. Giving you magic lessons.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your going to teach us magic,&quot; Raiden exclaimed to which Shizen nodded. &quot;Of course,&quot; she said. &quot;And I do hope you come and visit often. The kitsune know about you two. They all love you. You my dear kits bring great joy to our people.&quot;</p>
