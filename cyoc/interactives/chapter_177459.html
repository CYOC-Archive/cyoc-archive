<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dylan hopped off the school bus, turning to wave at one of his friends who was hanging out the window. &quot;Later, Mike!&quot; The bus pulled off and Dylan started the trek up his driveway, but not before grabbing the mail from the mailbox. Dylan was pretty average for a fourteen year old, he had taken up hockey this year, so he had started to put on some muscle from the workouts, but he was still pretty much on the scrawny side. His brown hair was a floppy mess that was just getting long enough to get in his eyes, which meant his mother would insist on a haircut soon. And right now he had no plans but to enjoy himself for the weekend, it was Friday, and for the first time in his life his parents had decided they could leave him home alone while they went on a weekend trip to the lake house.<br />
<br />
As he walked he casually flipped through the, though he never expected to see anything for himself. However one interesting little box caught his eye that was addressed to his father. &quot;Transversion Incorporated DILF pills, free sample.&quot; He read aloud as he looked at the box. &quot;Huh.. wonder what these are.&quot; He stepped inside the house and tossed the mail down on the table just inside the door, except for the box. Dropping his back pack and shedding his shoes in the hallway he continued into the house. The box was sealed, but with a little effort he got the plastic adhesive disc up without tearing it incase he wanted to close it up again. Inside was a folded up instruction pamphlet and a blister pack of six pills.<br />
<br />
As he read the paper, Dylan&#39;s eyes shot up. Pills that would make him older for just a day? Plans started flooding through his head. Home alone for the weekend and the sudden ability to be an adult. He could really have some fun. Go to the store and buy some beer, maybe even go to a bar! Teens usually aren&#39;t very good at reading warning labels, though.<br />
<br />
He ran into the kitchen and poured himself a glass of water, popping one of the pills out of the packaging. &quot;Well, here goes nothing.&quot; He popped the pill in his mouth and washed it down with the water.<br />
<br />
And then he waited.<br />
<br />
And waited.<br />
<br />
Impatience got the better of him. &quot;Uhg.. I knew that wouldn&#39;t work. Probably just some stupid bone..&quot; Dylan cut off as he felt exactly that swelling up his in pants. &quot;Yeah, stupid boner pill.&quot; Then his stomach started to rumble. He clutched at it. He felt like he needed to belch, instead his chest suddenly barreled outwards, and he shot up in height, his stomach becoming exposed between the bottom of his t-shirt and the waist of his pants, which also now showed a few inches of leg sticking out the cuff.<br />
<br />
He needed to get a better view of this. And now. He bolted from the kitchen, having to adjust the way he moved to account for a new center of gravity. His shirt was getting uncomfortably tight across the chest, and it felt like he had a blood pressure cuff on each arm. As he reached for the stairway railing he saw his upper arm had bulked with muscle, the cuff of his shirt now straining to stay together in the slightly more narrow part between his upper arm muscles and his shoulder. His hand looked huge on the railing, a fine brown hairs were growing in around his wrist and up his forearm.<br />
<br />
He started bounding up the stairs, managing to take two at a time. He almost slipped as one sock suddenly snapped off his foot, the other sock just tore, his toes sticking freely out the front. He stumbled into his parents&#39; room where there was a full length mirror and gaped at himself in shock.<br />
<br />
He definitely looked older. Not a DILF, but he was probably eighteen or so. Fuzz had grown in on his face, mostly on his chin and upper lip, his jaw having squared out a bit, his brows and nose a bit heavier. With a ping, the button flew off his pants and struck the mirror, luckily bouncing off without breaking it, the sound of a zipper popping apart quickly following.<br />
<br />
His pants were getting far too tight on his growing legs. There was about five inches of exposed leg beneath the tight cuff, hairy leg. Leading to large feet with a bit of brown hair a top them as well. He tried shoving his pants down, but they were just too tight one his thighs, the definition of which he could even see through the stretched blue denim. Finally the seams started to pop and with a bit of muscling courtesy his newly enlarged biceps and triceps, the was able to tear the seams enough to get the pants off. The straining of his arms caused his shirt sleeves to rip next, exposing his arms right up to his densely hairy pits<br />
<br />
Brown hair had grown all the way up his legs and was dusted over even his thighs. His white briefs were strained to the limit, the elastic barely holding and showing off a heavy brown bush peeking out the top. The pouch was stretched out around his cock, which must have been twice the size it used to be. Curly brown hair was growing in over his exposed stomach, but he could barely worry about that as the collar of his shirt was becoming to tight around his swelling neck.<br />
<br />
He lifted his now completely bearded chin, gripping the collar of his shirt with both hands and tore. The shirt ripped right down the middle, exposing a pair of meaty pecs covered in a light dusting of brown hair that was growing thicker by the second. He pulled the last remnants of his shirt off his arms, barely able to keep up with the changes.<br />
<br />
No longer able to contain it, Dylan&#39;s growing cock popped out the top of his undies, pushing them down a bit as it came free. Only this year had Dylan been able to compare sizes in the locker room, and he knew this was something big. He stared down at his new shaft, thick and heavy with the purplish tip just starting to push out past his foreskin. Though that was soon peeling back from the plump head as he felt blood rushing to it. He quickly wiggled out of the last piece of clothing he had on, kicking the now terminally stretched out undies off to the side. He let out a sigh of relief as his egg sized balls were finally allowed to swing free.<br />
<br />
He continued to put on muscle, though it seemed to be slowing now. Instead the light dusting of hair on his meaty chest was filling in thicker, and his stomach lost the definition it had moments earlier. His gut pushed out a little, giving him a small but noticeable belly. He didn&#39;t look fat, just.. bulkier, and somehow made his chest stick out even more.<br />
<br />
He looked his reflection in the face and was surprised how much he looked like his father. He was still younger looking than his father was, but no kid. A little bit of gray even speckled his brown hair and beard. He guessed himself to be somewhere just around 40. He was a whole hell of a lot burlier than his father was, too. &quot;Holy fuck.&quot; He voice was a deep growl of a baritone that made him laugh just to hear that tone again.<br />
<br />
He sat back on his parents bed and wrapped a hand around his thick cock, unable to even get his fingers to meet around it. He could have added a second hand to the stroking he started, but instead his other hand seemed to instinctively seek out one of his plump nipples sticking out of his thick chest hair. He tweaked and twisted his nipple as he pumped his fist on his fully grown cock. Somehow, this felt better than any of the jacking sessions he had had before. Slick pre slid down his shaft, coating his palms as he continued to work on his cock, the foreskin sliding back and forth over the head. He though of finding a nice warm hole to shove his fat cock in, warm and slick and begging him for more.<br />
<br />
With a grunt, Dylan shot his first adult load, one thick glob of cum after another that put his jerk-off session this morning to complete shame. After his cock stopped twitching, he lifted his cum soaked hand to his mouth, tasting his own seed with a smile. Salty, musky, and just a little bit sweet. Maybe he could find someone to have a taste tonight.</p>
