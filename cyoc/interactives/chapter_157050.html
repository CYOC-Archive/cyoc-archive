<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Hmm, hmm. I think this story sounds nice.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tommy Reyes, or more commonly called Tom, staring at the plain, silver ring displayed on the shelf of this shop. It was empty of all ornate designs other than the indecipherable carvings inside the ring. <br />
<br />
Picking up the ring from its soft red cotton showcase, Tom inspected the ring thoroughly. Something made him curious about this shop, whether it was its antique design or the fact that the sign said &quot;Shop of Magical Artifacts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course, the sign revealed the obscured text to Tom, but everyone else only saw Antique Artifacts instead. <br />
<br />
Tom took out his phone, snapping a picture of the unknown words carved into the ring&#39;s band. Storing away his phone, he then slid the ring onto his ring finger. <br />
<br />
It snugly fit like a glove, comfortably. He inspected the ring, reflecting the warm golden light of the store. It looks nice, but Tom knew he didn&#39;t need a ring. Though it was very pretty.<br />
<br />
He moved to pull the ring off his fingers when the bell atop the door was broken off its hinges when the door was opened too roughly, the bell flying and loudly clattering on the wooden floor of the shop. Tom quickly hid when the supposed customer loudly shouted at the top of his lungs.<br />
<br />
&quot;PUT THE MONEY IN THE BAG!&quot; <br />
<br />
Tom quickly hid behind a wooden pillar surrounded by baskets of toy staves, glancing at the counter as the robber with a black mask aimed a handgun towards the storekeeper. A bag was thrown over the counter, ready to be filled with money.<br />
<br />
Tom began to assess the man, the stocky and muscular body of the man was obvious. The deep, growling voice of the robber sent chills up his spine in fear, the response of prey hidden from the sight of a predator. <br />
<br />
His heart was beating fast, his eyes were whitening in panic. Pulses of his blood beat loudly in his ears as the man jerked the gun towards the old shopkeeper&#39;s face even when the frail arms grabbed handfuls of cash and shoved them into the bag.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHERE&#39;S MORE MONEY?!&quot; The big man demanded, slamming his fists on the countertop. &quot;This <i>IS</i> an antique shop and I know these things sell for a lot!&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man didn&#39;t flinch, calmly staring death in the eyes. &quot;Sorry sir, but sales had been at an all-time low lately, I&#39;m sorry we have no more money.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bullshit!&quot; The man aimed the gun upwards and pulled the trigger, the gunshot rattling the glass of the shop and punching a hole straight through the ceiling. &quot;I know you have pieces of jewelry sold here, load them up!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At once sir.&quot; The old man seemed to smirk. The robber looked to the back of the shop, noticing the shine of silver and gold. The rings and necklaces.<br />
<br />
With a threatening tone, daring the old man to attempt something. &quot;I&#39;m taking those rings too.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tom paled.<br />
<br />
He had to move.<br />
<br />
Quick!<br />
<br />
The robber&#39;s footsteps rapidly approached where he was, thank god for the short, lanky 18-year-old body of his making it sneakier and easier to hide.<br />
<br />
Tom waited for the perfect moment to move, his heart beating faster than ever. Sweat dripped from his face, but he knew he had to move. He took a step forward, glancing at the reflective surfaces of the items to see the man approaching. <br />
<br />
Tom waited until the man was on the other side of his pillar before he took another step. He crossed over the items around the pillar, silently stepping over the baskets. <br />
<br />
But, in his fear, his hands numbed and it touched a loose staff. Tom only had a moment of shock when the staff slid off the pillar, crashing straight into the metal of the racks behind him. <br />
<br />
Tom was struck with a flight or fight response when the robber saw him in an instant. <br />
<br />
He chose flight.<br />
<br />
Quickly, Tom started to sprint. <br />
<br />
&quot;HEY!&quot; <br />
<br />
Maybe he was too slow, maybe the guy was a jock because it didn&#39;t feel like a second when his throat was constricted with a chokehold, the gun straight at his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where you going, nerd?&quot; The chokehold was oppressive, the big body of the guy preventing him from looking upwards. His arms froze in fear when the barrel of the gun was straight towards his brains.<br />
<br />
Frozen in fear, his breath was cut off. His adrenaline-filled body demanded oxygen and Tom <i>couldn&#39;t breathe</i>.<br />
<br />
Tom grabbed the big arm on his throat in a desperate attempt to plead mercy. <br />
<br />
The pressure disappeared so suddenly that Tom collapsed onto the wooden floor. His body suddenly surged with heat, burning.<br />
<br />
Tom looked to where the robber was supposed to be, only to see nothing there. The gun had disappeared as well. No trace at all.<br />
<br />
Still, within his flight response, Tom didn&#39;t think and ran straight out of the shop, panic driving his body forward. The shopkeeper&#39;s attempt to call to him back was unheard as Tom kept running from the brush with death.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!&quot; <br />
<br />
Tom kept running and running further away from the shop towards his house, his haven. His mom and dad should be at work, but at least it&#39;d be safe.<br />
<br />
Tom didn&#39;t notice as his body heated considerably, his speed increasing as each step he took began to pound onto the tarmac. But he didn&#39;t notice.<br />
<br />
Not even when his height increased, or a missing silver ring.<br />
<br />
Tom reached his home faster than he thought he could get, his heart pounding heavily and his body sore and numb from the heat and overexertion. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom?! Dad?!&quot; Tom desperately shouted for them. There was no response. They were still at work. <br />
<br />
He needed comfort. He needed his room. Running up the stairs, Tom&#39;s ears were deafened by his stronger beating heart, the pounding on the stairs by his increasingly heavier body went unnoticed,<br />
<br />
He entered his room, locked the doors, ran straight towards his bed and jumped under the sheets. <br />
<br />
Not bothering to change from the sweaty clothes covering his warm body, shuddering in fear.<br />
<br />
Tom couldn&#39;t stand the heat as his brain overheated. Like a bubble, his consciousness popped. Under the sheets, his body began to rapidly grow, and his shirt begins to stain with another color. Black fabric emerged on his face, stitching something.<br />
<br />
The body shuddered as a pulse racked it, legs sliding closer towards the foot of the bed. Muscles pulsed as it thickened, shoulders broadened and pecs popped into place.<br />
<br />
His slim abdomen widened, the muscles and fat shifting around as abs began to float above the sea of lean fat. Slowly, Tom&#39;s body bulked with both height and muscles. His biceps pulsed, muscles growing over muscles. Tom was silent through all of these changes, unconscious to even the recesses of his mind.<br />
<br />
As his body thickened, the cock of the now bulky young adult sprung inside the jeans. It snaked as the jeans were too thick to penetrate. The soft underwear stretched as it pulsed bigger, longer, and hefty. The balls pulsed once, and another as it ballooned with both size and semen. <br />
<br />
Soon, the heat began to subside as pleasure wracked the unconscious body. Waves of hair, from the pubic, armpit and even the crown flowed with new follicles. The heat began to migrate towards the crotch, pulsating as the body began to writhe. <br />
<br />
When all of the heat had collected, he growled a deep, predatorial growl as his thick jock cock pulsed, the last batches of the two individuals splurted out and splattering the insides of the jeans. He groaned, jerking his crotch with each spurt. Soon, only the merged semen of the two men spurted out, completing its dominance in replacement.<br />
<br />
The body relaxed, deep exhausted breaths escaping his throat from the afterglow. <br />
<br />
Akin the semen of the two people had been ejaculated out, the mind of both Tom and the robber, Marcus, had been merged down to their best and worst.<br />
<br />
But as the eyes of the man opened, as the grin of a dumb jock and the guffaw escaped his mouth moaning accidentally. <br />
<br />
&quot;F-Fuck... What happened?&quot; <br />
<br />
Tom was in control of the merge, but with the loss of the ring, whose personality dominated the merge?</p>
