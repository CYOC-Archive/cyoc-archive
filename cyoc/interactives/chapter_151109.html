<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He lay on the cold, stone floor of the cave and listened without really hearing, trying to keep his mind as blank as much as possible, and remain as still as he could. Rolling over onto his side, feeling his arms brush against his teats, Tobias groaned and shifted back the way he had been lying. Uncomfortable, his tail pinched, he thought, &quot;It&#39;s better this way.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he reasoned this, he considered how it made it easier not only to keep his sexual urges at bay by focusing on and doing something else, such as laying in an uncomfortable position, but kept the dog part of himself from getting to much control. Sighing, he found himself disturbed by the notion that he was losing himself, that his mind was going canine, something he had noticed shortly after he and the male wolf had fucked. Huffing in agitation, finding it impossible to keep his mind a blank, he thought about how it was getting more and more difficult to remember stuff he learned, to recall familiar faces, to untimely realise that the curse that was changing his body was also affecting his mind in more ways then he had noticed.<br />
<br />
Sure, he understood that his sleep patterns had changed to him being more active at night and at twilight, whilst he found it easier and easier to hunt and kill his prey. But, as he had come to understand, slowly at first after his last encounter with the male wolf, then more and more over the last several days, it was more than that. His higher learning was gone, and he could barely remember anything he learned at high school. When he had tried to recall how to spell words, do arithmetic, reason out complex thoughts, it had, for the most part, been a haze that had left him frustrated and confused, with him only able to do simple math problems to a point and spell out three and four letter words, with anything longer causing him difficulties. Huffing, &quot;I&#39;m a stupid head,&quot; missing how it made him sound like the way he&#39;d talked when he had been younger than ten, Tobias found himself wanting to scream out in frustration, to howl out his worry and anger.<br />
<br />
Instead, he stretched and let loose with a wide yawn that showed off his sharp canine teeth. Staring up at the cave ceiling, which he could almost reach up and touch, he breathed deeply through his nose and smelling the air outside the cave, his mind telling him it was just past dusk, he sighed and figured it wouldn&#39;t do him any good laying here any longer. Wiggling about, trying his best not have his teats touch the cold floor, not wanting to be reminded that he now had them, he exited the cave and stretched, enjoying the subtle twilit air as it brushed against his naked flesh. Looking about for the either of the wolves, hoping the female hadn&#39;t come back, as he hadn&#39;t seen her since he had had his encounter with the male, he lopped over to a tree, placed his malformed paw-like-hands against the rough bark, lifted a leg and peed.<br />
<br />
Afterward, he turned away and sniffed the air. Hungry, he started to stalk through the woods, knowing that he could find his way easily back to the cave that he had been sleeping in for the last two days. Finding signs of the passage of animal that his olfactory senses assured him was a female rabbit, he had a twinge of doubt that he was hunting something that had at one time had been human as he began following it. Unaware to the way the curse truly transformed his victims, Tobias soon felt the dog trying to take over and trying to fight against it, he lost the battle of wills when he found that allowing it some control made it simple to trail after the animal.<br />
<br />
Displeased with this, he was certain that the more he let this happen, the more he lost of himself. A quick glance down at his naked body, noting his semi-erect penis, the paws that should have been feet, his hands that didn&#39;t look like hands but something closer to paws, and feeling his tail twitching, he swivelled his ears slightly when he detected a noise. Silently stalking toward it, he paused and scanned the surrounding woods. Everything having gone silent, he followed his canine instincts and lowered himself closer to the ground. Placing his malformed hands in front of him, which gave him an appearance of nearly being on all fours with his backside raised slightly, he scanned the trees, sniffing ever so often. Smelling the prey he had been hunting, plus a number of other things, he started to take a step forward when he it came to him that there was something that was sending him warnings of danger.<br />
<br />
Suddenly wary of everything, Tobias looked in different directions and searched for anything amiss. Seeing nothing, but still feeling like there was something wrong, he hesitantly took a step forward and nearly bolted when a loud scream rent the air. Uttering a noise that sounded like a dog&#39;s yip, Tobias tried to locate source of the horrible noise when something abruptly landed on his back.<br />
<br />
Terrified, sure he was being attacked and that if he didn&#39;t either find a way to defend himself or get away he would surely be killed, the young man tried to wiggle away and froze when he felt something poking into his backside. Sniffing the air, smelling something he couldn&#39;t fully describe, except that it reeked of both male and female scents, he was alarmed when he felt a warm flush wash over him as he quickly understood what it was poking into him. Fangs gently nipping at his neck, not enough to break the skin but enough to send a message of what the thing atop of him wanted, Tobias wanted scream. Trying to get away, he was horrified when his canine mind fought him on such an action and he found himself instead trying to position himself better for what he knew was to come.<br />
<br />
A quick glance back in an attempt to see what it was that was trying to have its way with him and Tobias uttered a dog-like yelp when he heard a low growl and saw a pair of powerful looking tawny paws on his shoulders. Thinking, &quot;Shit. It&#39;s a damn cougar,&quot; he had a brief moment of hysterical hilarity when he considered that he&#39;d always wanted to score with a cougar, and then he whimpered, &quot;But not like this,&quot; as he felt to large cat making thrusting motions as it tried to insert its penis into Tobias&#39; vagina.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t do this,&quot; he suddenly belted out and then added, &quot;I&#39;m a dude and I like,&quot; but whatever else he was going to say was lost when the cat finally found the hole it was questing for.<br />
<br />
The warmth of arousal growing, Tobias yipped in first agitation, then slight discomfort, then enjoyment as he felt the cougar begin to fuck him. His basic instincts betraying him as the both canine part of him and the curse took over, Tobias found himself sinking into a bliss of sexual need and enjoyment. Trying to fight it, he was only dimly away of how his face began to push outward as his female genitals grew moist and slick. Scared by what he knew would happen if he let it continue, he tried to struggle, but found that not only was the cat displeased with this, but also doing so only presented himself for better penetration. Whimpering, his lower jaw extending as his nose turned black, wet and merged with his upper lip, Tobias felt his tongue, now more a dog&#39;s tongue, loll out. Panting. losing himself more and more, he whimpered, &quot;No. Please stop,&quot; to no avail until his own words were lost in yips and barks of excitement.<br />
<br />
Low growls and a noise he couldn&#39;t explain mixed with his own sounds of pleasure as he was aware of what would happen the moment they both climaxed. Not wanting to be stuck with the muzzle of a dog, Tobias tried to once more pull away. The large cat, annoyed by this, nipped a little harder at Tobias&#39; neck and flexed its claws. Taking a hint, wanting to cry, Tobias found he was not only powerless to do anything, but that he was actually enjoying what was happening. And as he felt the cougar shudder and blow its load, he whimpered in both terror and relief as he felt himself climax shortly afterward.<br />
<br />
The instant the tawny cat felt this, it lost interest and started to pull out. A whimper of pain from escaped Tobias and scooting as far away from the cougar as he could get, Tobias glared at it balefully for a moment, seeing as he did that, somehow, the cat was both male and female. Wondering if it were possible that the animal had at one time been human, Tobias crossed his eyes and looked down at the dog snout that dominated his face. Despising it, he looked back at the cougar, who was lazily cleaning itself, and, at first, hating it, he mellowed as he thought that, maybe the cat was like him, only further along. Opening his mouth, Tobias tried to ask it, &quot;Are you like me, cursed?&quot; but was devastated when he only heard the normal sounds of a dog barking.<br />
<br />
Reeling from this, he howled in alarm and tried to utter, &quot;No, no, no, no, no,&quot; but was dismayed to only hear a series of barks escaping him. Wanting to cry, to scream, to attack the tawny, she-male cat for not only how it had caused him to develop a dog muzzle but had cost him the ability of human speech, Tobias instead leapt up and ran. Certain that at any moment that large cat would be after him, but not really caring, he tore through the forest, blindly running in no set direction, his mind finally a blank.</p>
