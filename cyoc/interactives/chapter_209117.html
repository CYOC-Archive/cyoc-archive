<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff waved up to Finn as he jogged onto the field. Finn was so distracted by his phone; he didn&#39;t even see Jeff. &#39;Guess he&#39;s taking the game seriously...&#39; he thought to himself. His eyes glanced around the field as to notice if anything was any different but so far he didn&#39;t notice anything. Jeff clenched his teeth as he tried to desperately notice anything at all.<br />
<br />
A bit of frustration ran through him as he knew for a fact that he&#39;d lost the previous game. Even if he knew that Bryce was now a cock hound that didn&#39;t mean that he could see the guy as anything but. The number of times that golden retriever had begged to suck his cock was more than he could remember. It&#39;d almost become a bit of a burden in the locker room as he would go around staring. His tail would start off slowly, but especially for Jeff, it would almost become a fan and slam against the metal lockers when he saw him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm...&quot; Jeff grumbled as he went through the stretches on the field.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s got you so bothered?&quot; Adrian asked.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt himself stiffen up at the question. &quot;Nothing,&quot; he lied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t sound like nothing,&quot; Adrian pressured. &quot;You&#39;re growling...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot; Jeff cursed under his breath. He knew that was one of the worst things he could do. The other guys were okay with him being part tiger, but that didn&#39;t stop them from being at least a bit hesitant around him. Him being significantly larger and stronger than even the strongest among them, along with sharp claws and teeth drew at least a little bit of fear. Even if it&#39;d only been a day since he changed, he&#39;d already learned to not show that wild side off too much. &quot;Sorry...&quot; he added. &quot;It&#39;s just Finn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Finn?&quot; Adrian asked. &quot;That the little fox guy you&#39;re carrying around today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. We&#39;re playing a bit of a game right now. If I win, he has to come out and we start dating,&quot; Jeff explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Adrian leaned in as Coach Kodiak had them running around the track as a warmup. &quot;He&#39;s in the closet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Technically...&quot; Jeff said. He wasn&#39;t about to admit that that technicality was his fault. If he had any interest in the Chronivac any more he&#39;d probably end up changing that. <br />
<br />
The answer drew a laugh out of Adrian. &quot;Alright,&quot; he said. &quot;What&#39;s the game?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm?&quot; Jeff looked over at the other football player with a bit of suspicion. He didn&#39;t know why someone like Adrian would want to help him. Not that the human was a bad guy. If anything, he was probably one of the closest guys Jeff could get along with. Maybe it was just because he was the closest in size as well. The linebacker was the only one who came close to his line of sight at 6&#39;6&quot; and his beefy muscular build could at least act like a warmup when they were lifting weights.<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Hmmm&#39;? What do you mean &#39;Hmmm&#39;?&quot; Adrian shot back at him. &quot;This is the first guy you&#39;re actually showing a bit of interest in and all you can do is go &#39;Hmmm?&#39; Come on man. Don&#39;t be stupid.&quot; He added a friendly punch to the arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right...&quot; Jeff laughed. &quot;I guess that makes sense.&quot; He still wasn&#39;t used to this tiger form yet. But with a body like this, it made sense that he&#39;d be a bit of a player.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what&#39;s the game?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot;<br />
<br />
Adrian let out another sigh. &quot;Bro. You can&#39;t already be this distracted by a bit of ass. C&#39;mon man. If this affects the game Kodiak&#39;s going to have yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right. Sorry,&quot; Jeff laughed a bit as he tried to think. &quot;It&#39;s a spot the difference. If there&#39;s anything different today, then just say something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adrian let out a shiver. &quot;You mean other than us just practicing in our jocks today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s that different?&quot; Jeff asked. &quot;We do it all the time for team building. Even Kodiak and Caldwell are in their underwear.&quot; Looking around, everyone on the team was in nothing but their jocks. He knew most of the football players didn&#39;t really like showing off their bodies, but Coach had always said that there shouldn&#39;t be any secrets between teammates, and everything should be exposed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So? Maybe it&#39;s just cause you&#39;ve got all that fur, but it&#39;s fucking cold for the rest of us,&quot; Adrian complained. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve got plenty of fur,&quot; Jeff smiled as he ran his hand through the hair coating Adrian&#39;s burly chest and belly. For a human he had a decent amount that covered his large body. &quot;Get any more of it and people might mistake you for an anthro bear.&quot; Adrian let out a growl as Jeff&#39;s hand pat his belly fat. &quot;See? Already almost there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can&#39;t all be built like you,&quot; Adrian groaned as they finished their run. He was panting a bit, leaning over and showing off his meaty ass. Jeff felt himself pause and stare. His eyes wouldn&#39;t leave the other man&#39;s body and kept thinking about how much he wanted to pounce. The claws lining his fingers flexed out as his tail swished back and forth methodically as blood rushed into his dick. A low rumble of a growl rolled out of his throat as he watched the other man bend over, exposing his hole.<br />
<br />
&quot;ALRIGHT BOYS!&quot; Kodiak shouted. The deep boom of his voice instantly caught everyone&#39;s attention and they rounded up in a semicircle around the coach. &quot;We&#39;re going to be doing some drills today. Pick a partner and line up on the field.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adrian headed over to Jeff. &quot;You alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah,&quot; Jeff said. &quot;Let&#39;s get out there.&quot; The worry about his hard cock in his small jock completely disappeared. With how large he was, it was near impossible to properly hide and with them wearing nearly nothing, it would be more awkward if he did. Like Kodiak said, it was teambuilding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright boys!&quot; Kodiak shouted again when all the college athletes lined up. &quot;Stand across from your partner and we&#39;re going to be practicing tackles today. I want to see proper form, and no one had better get hurt today. UNDERSTOOD?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir!&quot; the team chanted back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good! Now get started!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff dropped down to the ground and faced Adrian. Feeling his claws tear through the dirt was always such a satisfying feeling. He looked up with a smile. &quot;Ready?&quot; Adrian nodded. The two rushed at each other, pushing all their weight against the other. Of course, Adrian couldn&#39;t do much against the much larger tiger but that didn&#39;t stop him from trying. He made sure to put all his strength into it, but eventually found himself on the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good!&quot; Kodiak shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry bout that,&quot; Jeff smiled as he put out his paw for Adrian to grab. He lifted the other man up with ease.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine,&quot; Adrian looked off into the distance. &quot;Not like anyone else could do any better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;AGAIN!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two dropped to the ground, facing off again. The whistle blew and the two men charged. Their large bodies slammed against each other. Jeff could feel his powerful muscles working as they pushed against Adrian. His heart raced as he maintained his strength. Not too much to completely overpower the human but not enough so he wouldn&#39;t lose. However, a surprise came when he felt one of Adrian&#39;s hand run down his side. Followed by his face nuzzling against the nape of his neck. The surprise shook Jeff to his core. He added too much force and Adrian fell down onto his back. Without a thought Jeff found himself on top of the other man.<br />
<br />
Seconds felt like minutes as he stared down at Adrian. The large, by human standards, man was stunned. He starred upward at Jeff&#39;s tiger maw as his hands were held against the ground above his head. He had the most dumbfounded look on his face as he waited. The whistle blew again. &quot;Shit. Sorry man,&quot; Jeff said as he got off of Adrian.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright,&quot; Adrian&#39;s smile looked somewhat familiar. Jeff couldn&#39;t quite place it, but he knew he&#39;d seen it recently. &quot;I got distracted.&quot; But that&#39;s when he leaned in, whispering. &quot;I didn&#39;t realize you were soft...&quot; His hand brushed against the tiger&#39;s cock, sending a wave of blood into it. It instantly went from its semihard state to a full-on throb. The jock couldn&#39;t quite contain its size and it ended up becoming free, bouncing right next to the small piece of fabric.<br />
<br />
&quot;AGAIN!&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Fuck...&#39; Jeff felt his primal urges taking over as he stood across from the linebacker. But feeling those large meaty hands gently caress his side was something else. Thoughts were gone. When he heard the whistle blow, Jeff threw his whole weight into the tackle and knocked the other man down onto the ground. It only took a second for Adrian to be pinned under his weight. But that&#39;s only where it began.<br />
<br />
Jeff instantly took advantage of his top position and leaned down in for a kiss. Adrian happily accepted as their tongues danced around in each other&#39;s mouths. Even though Adrian had never done something like this, he acted like a pro. Instantly following every one of Jeff&#39;s leads and allowing the tiger to rub his dick up and down his belly. Pre dripped onto his hairy stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck...&quot; Adrian let out the deepest, sexiest moan as his body bucked. Everyone on the team knew to be careful with Jeff&#39;s pre as even just a drop could turn you into a horny bottom for the rest of the day. Or until he fucked you. Either way, that man would be on cloud nine as his mind couldn&#39;t think of anything other than the muscular tiger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry bro,&quot; Jeff apologized as he flipped the large man over. Adrian wasn&#39;t complaining as he placed his ass high up into the air. His face laid flat against the grass as a bit of drool rolled out of his mouth. He couldn&#39;t help it as pleasure rocketed through him and his cock as those large hands ran up and down his body. Then positioned his asshole in the right position. A bit more pre dripped onto his hole, causing another deep moan out of the football player.<br />
<br />
Jeff slid his cock in. &quot;Fuuuuuuckkkkkkk....&quot; the two moaned in unison. Another benefit to his pre was being able to open any hole. With a cock as large as his it was an absolute necessity as fitting a wine bottle inside another man wasn&#39;t very easy. Jeff felt a consistent perfect grip around his cock as it slid deeper inside, while Adrian felt a pleasant feeling as the cock filled him up.<br />
<br />
Adrian&#39;s hands clawed at the dirt as he fought off his orgasm. The feeling was sublime sending him to the moon and back. Each thrust inside him felt like another shot of escstacy being blown into him. But still he felt that edge. The edge of not wanting to complete. He held onto that feeling as long as he could. Until finally, he was able to release as Jeff finished inside him. The cum blasted over and over inside him, filling him up.<br />
<br />
It took a moment before Jeff was properly able to remove his cock. The anus closed back up as though nothing had happened. Adrian&#39;s body fell limp as a wave of euphoria overtook him. The dull sense of pleasure ran through his body making every one of his muscles feel limp. &quot;Sorry bro...&quot; Jeff apologized again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing to apologize for,&quot; Adrian said. His big body leaned against the tiger&#39;s body, as he gently stroked the black and white fur along Jeff&#39;s chest. &quot;Nothing at all...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff waved towards Kodiak and Caldwell. They knew something like this would happen and continued with the drills. Jeff carried Adrian over to the locker room, wondering if Finn had made any changes yet.</p>
