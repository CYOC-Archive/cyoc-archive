<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Yayyy!!!” Skylar said with absolute happiness in her voice, finally someone was willing to be fat, which meant that the ground rules were still being followed, and she got what she wanted,<br />
“You’re sure about this?” You ask Tonya, just to be sure,<br />
“Absolutely,” Tonya replied, “I think it’s like… a learning thing. Skylar’s right, I’m never gonna have thus opportunity again, why don’t I just take it,”<br />
“Honestly, that’s the best answer you can give,” you reply, “Skylar, onto you,” you finish, stepping back to Skylar to make her wish.<br />
<br />
“You have no idea how happy I am to be doing this!” Skylar said with glee, “alright… calm down,” she said to herself, making Tonya gradually more and more nervous with what Skylar was going to end up doing, “I wish that Tonya gains enough weight that her belly breaks her jeans,”<br />
“What!?” Tonya said aloud, super confused by Skylar’s wording,<br />
“Hey! I’m still figuring out how the whole ‘pounds’ thing works. Plus, this’ll get exactly what we want,” she said with a smirk,<br />
<br />
“It’s just a strange way of— oh!” Tonya says, interrupted as she places her hand on her belly, “I feel something starting…” she states, looking down at herself.<br />
You can see her belly beginning to rise, pushing against her jeans already. Unlike a lot of what you’ve seen, Tonya’s entire body doesn’t seem to gain that much weight, it’s linked to specific areas. To start, her thighs start growing much quicker than the rest of her. Before too long, her belly was getting to a pretty stretched point, pushing the fabric of her very loose top, which is already being extended by her increased breasts. In fact, her breasts also seem to be growing a little too. Her calves gain, as well as her arms too. Her thighs seem to be growing the fastest, as with her hips seem to be getting a little thicker. Love handles had definitely formed as some of her belly had spilled over her jeans and under her top. You looked at her face, it was also getting a little chubbier. Lucky for her, it was in a pretty cute way. Her double chin seemed less doubled, more like a bubble of fat, the same went for her cheeks as they got a little puffier too. Her whole face looked rounder, yet softer.<br />
“This is so strange!” She said, grabbing at her little belly, “I feel… pretty big right now…” she stated, looking a little nervous as she continued to grow.<br />
Then, just like magic, her jeans button popped! It didn’t fly off, but simply broke and fell to the ground. She placed her hand on her entire belly, feeling it,<br />
“Mmm…” she said, closing her eyes, rubbing her belly, “this feels…”<br />
“Great?” Skylar said, knowing how Tonya felt,<br />
“It’s weird to say out loud,” Tonya replied, jokingly, “but it feels so wonderful!”<br />
<br />
“I’m glad you like it!!” Skylar said cheerfully,<br />
“I do! I actually do,” Tonya said, she looked into the reflection of a poster on the wall,<br />
“Oh, I wish that was a mirror,” Skylar said. Tonya watched as the poster quickly shifted to become much more reflective,<br />
“Wow,” Tonya said, at both the mirror changing thing, but also at herself, “I never would’ve thought… I kinda like it,” she said. She looked to Skylar, then to you briefly, then back to Skylar,<br />
“Keep going! I wanna hear why!!” Skylar says, very intrigued,<br />
<br />
“Well…” Tonya started, “I worked so hard to get a body that looked ‘good’, but I could never get rid of some parts of me. My thighs were always too plump, my belly was just never the flat I wanted. And my boobs didn’t help at all… I guess that’s why I accentuate them all the time. It just distracts people from the rest of my body,”<br />
“Not anymore!!” Skylar says, “now you’ve got it all. Nothing can distract anyone from what you look like now, and that’s the best thing!!”<br />
“Yeah, I guess so!” Tonya said, looking more and more excited as she admired herself,<br />
“And so that you don’t forget it, I wish that your clothes are fixed and all form fitting… as long as it makes it you look good!”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Tonya’s broken jeans repair themselves, fitting snugly around her plump thighs and calves, fitting underneath her belly instead of right in the middle of it. Her top, though not broken, fits snugly over her very large breasts, and forms perfectly over her belly. Her belly is now definitely visible, but even you can admit it looks pretty sexy.<br />
<br />
“Wow.” Tonya says, looking at herself in the mirror, “I mean this is all for my boyfriend…” she starts, hesitating, “but honestly. I kinda love it!!” She says with pride.<br />
<br />
Skylar and Tonya admire her body, Skylar wishing for little things to make sure Tonya not only looks good, but feels good as well. After a good 5 minutes, Tonya reveals herself.<br />
As a typical guy, you aren’t able to spot anything too different about her, but you could definitely notice the much greater and more pronounced cleavage through her top,<br />
“How does she look!” Skylar says, encouraging you to participate,<br />
<br />
“I think she looks great,” you say, “the extra weight definitely suits her, I think it makes her whole figure stand out more,” you say with confidence,<br />
“Look at you,” Tonya says, making her way over to you, “a man who actually notices stuff like that,”<br />
“Hah…” she say awkwardly, “I guess I do have to thank Skylar for that,” you say, she smirks in a cute way to you,<br />
<br />
“Well then,” Tonya says, looking over herself once more, “I seem to have a boyfriend waiting for a lot more woman than he bargained for at home,” she says. This makes you and Skylar snicker, “but hey, if you two see me again, say hi. I actually really like you two!” She says as she starts on her way to the exit,<br />
“We totally will!” Skylar says back,<br />
“Yeah, absolutely,” you say happily.<br />
<br />
“Isn’t it SO much nicer talking to women like they’re on your level,” Skylar says in a somewhat condescending way,<br />
“What’s that supposed to mean?” You ask, thinking this was some kind of attack towards you,<br />
“Well… I guess I used to treat women like they were lesser than me—”<br />
“You used to treat everyone like they were lesser than you,” you interrupt Skylar, correcting her,<br />
“Yeah yeah,” she says in a playful tone, “but it was always the hot ones I was nice to… I guess that’s why I became friends with Bella and Cara, they’re just…”<br />
“Sexy?” You asked, she looks at you, “that’s what everyone else said! Not me…” you say, not remembering if you’re actually telling the truth or not,<br />
“You said you thought I was hot though,” Skylar asked,<br />
“Never out loud,” you reply, “you have to remember that you were a serious bitch to me and my friends,”<br />
“Y-yeah… I know,” Skylar said, “I regret it, honestly,” She states. You knew she was telling the truth,<br />
“So you were only friends with Bella because you thought she was hot?” You asked,<br />
“N-no… I became friends with her because of that, but when I realised she just as much of a bitch than I am—”<br />
“Were,” you corrected her again. She smiled,<br />
“I guess I just saw her as another version of me,” she said, “and trust me, I love me. But not someone who acted like me…” she said,<br />
<br />
“I don’t know why I used to act how I did,” Skylar said,<br />
“I’m sure there are more reasons than I can list right now, but most of them I think you do know,” you said to her, looking her in the eyes,<br />
“Yeah,” she says, staring back, “sometimes I wish I was—” she stops herself, covering her mouth suddenly, almost making an accidental wish,<br />
“Holy shit, that was a close one,” you said. You looked at her, she still hand her hand over her mouth, “oh right,” you started, “you already started the wish. You gotta finish it,” you said.<br />
<br />
She stands there, hand over mouth, clearly thinking over what she wanted to proceed the wish with. The rules of the ring were if you started a wish, you’d committed to it. Until the wish is complete, she had to stay silent otherwise she could cause a disaster… this may have happened once or twice already.<br />
<br />
You looked at Skylar she seemed like she was ready to speak… but something seemed wrong.</p>
