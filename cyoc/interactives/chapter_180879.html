<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa did not know what was going on now - how she had ended up a he, why she was feeling such a strong intuition to seek out Kendall for some answers about what happened...and why this body felt so...intense. It was like she had an uncanny strength she had never known before, even though she was not even one of the bigger guys at the school now body wise. Lisa found herself stopping by the door on her way out, dressed in a tank top and long shorts, and examining herself in the mirror. She ran a hand through her hair, felt her strong chin and jaw, and even found herself flexing an arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no...male me is hot.&quot; She murmured, almost able to imagine enticing this red headed studmuffin into a quick encounter in one of the closets or something. At least it could be said she didn&#39;t end up a less than gifted example of masculinity. Such that while whatever was going on happened, she wouldn&#39;t be regarded as ugly at least. &quot;I mean, seriously, check this boy band looking fucker out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh baby baby baby why don&#39;t you stay tonight~&quot; She flourished a hand in front of her face, chuckling under her breath. Coping as it were with the highly unusual, unreal seeming events by comedy and a degree of fooling around. &quot;No...no. I need to head out and get some answers. Kendall&#39;s smart...he should know what&#39;s going on. What made me turn into this M-Synch looking boytoy.&quot; She opened the door and walked out, noting as she did that her new form altered how her typical stride went.<br />
<br />
Her more feminine presentation seemed to naturally give way to leading with her chest, arms tensed at her side.<br />
<br />
Being a boy felt so bizarrely different. There was a whole way of walking she found herself naturally settling into. And as she walked, she checked windows just to make sure she wasn&#39;t undergoing any other changes. Phew, it looked like as much as things changed already at least they weren&#39;t changing any more.<br />
<br />
She figured she needed to act natural, and hopefully nobody would piece together that the new rather effeminate looking guy in town and Lisa were one and the same. They did look rather unfortunately similar. Hopefully someone&#39;d more assume they were relatives rather than the same person. She didn&#39;t need anyone realizing she&#39;d become a guy.<br />
<br />
Though as Lisa walked down the street, she saw some of the party crowd heading out from nearby apartments. Lisa gulped - knowing full well that Bridgette Miller and her crew were not exactly people you wanted to mix with. Stories went around campus about Bridgette and her crew of seniors and recent graduates engaging in rowdy and unruly house parties, inviting over guys and getting them drunk enough to agree to dance on tables and such, taking photos all the while.<br />
<br />
Not exactly the crowd Lisa and Allison had ever willingly socialized with. Bridgette herself was from a wealthy family, and often got away with her raucous and unruly behavior all owing to a single call from her dad to whoever caused her trouble. She was a thin, generously endowed woman with long blond hair, light green eyes, and pale skin. She wore a red jacket over a blouse and a short skirt. Rumor had it that Bridgette had a picture gallery set up of the naked bodies of the men she slept with - further evidence of her unusual mentality. She was 19 years old and still a senior, having flunked one year purely because she partied a little too hardy.<br />
<br />
And it looked like tonight Bridgette was drunk as fuck.<br />
<br />
One of her friends was helping her avoid having any accidents, and eventually Bridgette found herself looking at Lisa. She could almost feel the stare from Bridgette on her back, leading Lisa to shiver and freeze up. She bit her lip as she heard Bridgette shout, &quot;Oh! And who&#39;s this hottie just swaggering down the street? I don&#39;t recall seeing you around, hot stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I&#39;m just...new around here is all.&quot; Lisa stammered out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh really,&quot; Bridgette answered, ambling over to Lisa and running her hand through Lisa&#39;s hair, &quot;Pretty nice hair, pretty boy. What&#39;s your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pressed for a name, Lisa gulped. She couldn&#39;t get out of this very easily. Bridgette tended not to take rejection very well. Ugly rumors typically circulated around guys who didn&#39;t humor her. And of course it was never her fault. She just had incorrigible friends! &quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m Lewis! Lewis Stafford.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Liiiike Lisa Stafford...&quot; Bridgette slurred, and then chuckled, &quot;Are you a relative?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, no, no, just same last name is all.&quot; Lisa responded, hoping she bought it. She didn&#39;t really expect the likes of Bridgette, especially in this frame of mind, to put together such an outlandish series of events.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Lewis...&quot; Bridgette reached around and Lisa gasped as she felt Bridgette slap her right on the ass. She would&#39;ve thought that&#39;d be less likely now she was a boy, but it seemed that was a common erogenous zone between sexes. &quot;Would you like a little...hic, hook up? I mean, I need a cute boy right now, and you&#39;re...really fucking cute...&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa realized she was pretty much cornered - Bridgette&#39;s friends were nothing if not enablers of her worst habits, and even though she knew she shouldn&#39;t be this excited, she felt her new manhood stirring. Growing erect. Fuck, was this how boys felt when girls came on to them? It was like a surging, insistent rod in her pants! Lisa tried to urge it to go down, but nothing she did seemed to work. And Bridgette noticed what was going on not much later.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you&#39;re...you&#39;re pretty hung for a pretty boy.&quot; Bridgette murmured in Lisa&#39;s ear, and she shivered as she felt Bridgette lightly chew on her ear. &quot;Back into the apartment, let&#39;s go.&quot; Lisa found herself numbly following Bridgette back into the party apartment, wincing at the smell of alcohol and other drugs on the air. Fuck, what did these people use? This place smelled horrible!<br />
<br />
As the door slammed shut, Lisa almost leaped upward in shock. She turned from regarding the apartment to seeing Bridgette removing her clothes. The party girl chuckled, &quot;Come oooon~ I&#39;m getting n-naked here, how about I get to see your muscled little body? Flex for me! C&#39;mon! C&#39;moooon!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa bit her lip, and said, &quot;B-But I&#39;m not even that buff!&quot; Her hard on was insistent though, she could hardly resist the opportunity. Maybe...maybe this once, before she tried to get her situation evaluated and dealt with. She felt Bridgette move over and expertly start removing Lisa&#39;s tank top.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Lewis! I just like how men&#39;s bodies look. Show me...please! I don&#39;t say please often.&quot; There was a tinge of a threat in that last part of the sentence. And Lisa was not keen on discovering what might happen if she pushed it here. This despoiled apartment complex barely managed at all... she breathed, and finished taking off her tank top, underwear, and shorts, standing there naked in front of Bridgette.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I&#39;m naked, you got me...how do you like these muscles?&quot; Lisa started flexing, admitting to herself in the process she found the strength and vitality she discovered in her male form rather...intoxicating. She swore her biceps looked very slightly bigger than they did earlier. Her chest looked nice, and her abs were pretty good, though more thin boy abs than trained gym guy abs. She twisted and turned, accentuating every muscle group she could for her audience...<br />
<br />
And then she gulped as Bridgette moved in and put her mouth on Lisa&#39;s manhood. Lisa found herself twitching, her arms almost falling to her sides mid-flex. &quot;Oh...ohh what are you doing to me? Didn&#39;t youuuu just just want me to fl-flex...? Ohh fuck this feels too good...&quot; Lisa couldn&#39;t help herself. This felt amazing. She almost felt tempted to stay longer than needed. To try and put this erect, strong part of herself into Bridgette and watch the smug rich girl thrash around as she thrust her cock into her.<br />
<br />
Was this how a man felt as sex was engaged? So eager to push in, thrust, fuck, and cum? &quot;Oohhhh...babe, you are too good at this.&quot; Lisa didn&#39;t know where half of this endurance came from, because Bridgette was giving her the blowjob to end all blowjobs. Being a young man was so weird, but fuck did it feel so good.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
&quot;So...I still don&#39;t get it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex and Chad sat at Chad&#39;s desk as the two of them got ready for the day&#39;s workout and afterwards, their torrid affair. Both anticipated it, but it seemed by far Alex felt the anticipation the most intensely. His manhood was still half hard even during their talk about their sexualities - just being this near someone who he knew bode to give him pleasure was...thrilling. Alex had never had sex in years, and the prospect of it occurring more was enticing as hell, and difficult to extricate himself from. He felt distinctly too worked up. He didn&#39;t want to workout with a boner in his shorts after all.<br />
<br />
Alex currently wore a sleeveless shirt that was once a short sleeve shirt - restyled into a cut off shirt with the help of a pair of scissors - and a pair of gray shorts. Chad was of course wearing his far too tight gym apparel, which was as usual meant to advertise his roided up body. Amazing what human effort plus chemical enhancement could achieve. Seeing Chad on a stage with his body like this would be akin to staring up at the bronzed form of a greek demigod.<br />
<br />
Chad explained, &quot;I mean, you grew up in the sixties or something, so I guess it&#39;s not something you&#39;re familiar with. No, Alex, you&#39;re not gay. And neither am I.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Alright, whatever you say, man.&quot; Alex nodded, figuring this was for the best.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, with that kind of talk out of the way, how about you and I get our workout on?&quot; Chad asked, beaming and eager to get things moving. Alex checked, seeing that he was still pretty excited, and Chad looked down for a moment at Alex&#39;s groin. The younger man grinned, &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re excited to get your workout on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad eagerly led the way to their workout for the day, starting with some shoulder press. Alex didn&#39;t really have much shoulder press experience, but Chad started him off with some comparatively lighter weight at 95 lbs - 25 lbs on each side of the bar - in order to make sure he was up to speed. Alex found himself doing it pretty easily, bringing the bar down to his shoulders and then back up, grunting as he felt the weight move. Fuck, he thought his shoulders might be not exactly in the best condition but...<br />
<br />
...he could really lift this!<br />
<br />
&quot;Very nice,&quot; Chad complimented, and then added another ten lbs on each side of the bar.<br />
<br />
When Chad clapped his shoulder, Alex lazily grinned and imagined things proceeding forward. How amazing would it be to have Darlene sucking him off, and Chad and he making out while Chad fucked her in the pussy? That&#39;d be pretty nice...ohh fuck. Gotta get that libido under control. Chad noted and said, &quot;Now let&#39;s keep our fun times for AFTER the workout, eh Alex?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...yeah you&#39;re right.&quot; Alex started his next set on shoulder press, grunting as he felt the weight move. More difficult this time, but nowhere near enough to stop him. He got to ten reps as usual, and let out a shout of exultation as he dropped the weight on the rack. He watched his strong, powerful shoulders moving with his breath - realizing he had a lot better strength than he had even two decades ago. Could he ever reach a level of strength like Chad&#39;s...?<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, last set. 135.&quot; Alex bit his lip lightly and then went ahead and started powering through reps.<br />
<br />
It was the hardest one so far, and keeping the weight in a straight line up and down was surprisingly difficult. He could feel his shoulders straining with the strongest weight yet, but keeping up admirably well. His face streaking with sweat as he passed the halfway point. Alex grunted one final time as he felt his shoulders getting nice and tight at the last rep - fuck but he loved this. He was going to have to workout every day from here on.<br />
<br />
He thought back to the offer Mason made earlier. There was no way he could decline now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay we&#39;re hitting supersets next of lateral raises and front raises, really drill those shoulders.&quot; Chad stated, leading the way over to the free weights. Alex rolled his shoulders. Usually he&#39;d be exhausted, but today? He was more than feeling okay with this.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
After school, Allison didn&#39;t see Kendall around, which was odd seeing as he usually met up with her around the outside of the school. Maybe he headed home today to do some research on the wishing machine or something. Well, she hadn&#39;t told him yet, and she meant to. She texted Kendall on his cellphone, &#39;Hey. It&#39;s Allison. Wanted to talk to you about the changes you&#39;re going through.&#39; She didn&#39;t see much of a message back from him yet, so she just assumed he was driving or otherwise occupied / busy.<br />
<br />
She was rather surprised when she saw who did show up to talk to her. Dylan Spence, dressed in a now poorly fitting jacket over his t-shirt and shorts, at first seeming to slowly walk out, but then he moved faster when he saw her standing by out there. Beaming as he was before. At least it seemed for now Dylan might be done changing. He was as she remembered him from class - taller, more stocky than fat now, and honestly, surprisingly handsome. Even his glasses gave him a certain air of professionalism.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heeey! Allison! I just...uh, I wanted to...&quot; He realized how odd this would look and blushed briefly as he approached her, &quot;You uh, you complimented me. Quite a lot. And I wanted to say...thank you. I mean, whatever&#39;s happening to me, it&#39;s obviously treating me really nicely. And I didn&#39;t know if anyone else noticed...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; Allison stated, &quot;You noticed too? That this wasn&#39;t...you know, normal? That you weren&#39;t always like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah!&quot; Dylan nodded, smiling, &quot;It&#39;s pretty awesome so far, but you can&#39;t not notice when you get up and you&#39;re like 6 inches taller and built like this.&quot; Dylan seemed so earnestly enthusiastic, but also so much in the know. &quot;And I noticed a lot of other people really seemed different too. And nobody even seemed to notice. It&#39;s so weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison considered letting him in on the secret that this was the work of some kind of wishing machine. Knowing full well it sounded outlandish, crazy even, and knowing that she couldn&#39;t really expect to change things with more wishing. Not without potentially throwing the town entirely out of wack. &quot;Would you like to talk with me some more about this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dylan beamed, and seemed to outright pinch himself - being asked to spend more time with a pretty girl like Allison was a dream come true for someone so used to going invisible like Dylan. Even if the circumstances behind the ask were kind of odd. It made Dylan think about things he&#39;d only ever dreamed about. Male desires he never considered able to be shared considering most girls didn&#39;t really want much to do with him. &quot;M-Me? You want to spend more time talking to me about something? Yes! Yes yes yes!! Okay yes!&quot;<br />
<br />
Wow, that was...something. She guessed poor Dylan didn&#39;t really get out much - and changing this much so far made him feel more confident. To a degree. He obviously still remembered how things were for better or worse. He sure didn&#39;t have a good time of it. &quot;Alright, let&#39;s head out to my car and discuss then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison didn&#39;t know where Kendall was, so she didn&#39;t think she could talk with him about this. But she figured that as long as things with Dylan stayed strictly based on talking about their experiences with this, they could have some time together. It wasn&#39;t like Dylan would sweep her off her feet or anything...right?</p>
