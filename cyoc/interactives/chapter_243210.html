<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meanwhile, at that exact moment, Susan was still fighting trying to figure what, if anything, was wrong.<br />
<br />
It all felt so right. Her cock was hard after seeing her wife’s fat ass. She had the most successful business in town. She was the alpha gynomorph, she had the largest cock in town, she was on top! But… why did their town only have women, whether they had dicks or pussies?<br />
<br />
Susan needed to clear her head, and masturbating always did that. She blinked and a luxurious shower room appeared in her executive suite - she needed it, she remembered, because of all the hot, sweaty sex she had. An even further luxury was the fact that there were two control panels - one outside and one inside. She turned the shower on her perfect temperature.<br />
<br />
She took off her jeans and her blouse, along with her heels, setting them aside for later. Getting in her hot shower, she looked at the mirrored walls. Her eyes darted down to her cock. Why did she have a cock, again?<br />
<br />
Her head felt a bit fuzzy once again. That’s right, the citizens in this area had a genetic abnormality. And gynomorph suddenly sounded wrong. She was a dickgirl. <br />
<br />
If someone was born a dickgirl, their children would always be dickgirls or female and they’d only be attracted to women or dickgirls. Both the women and dickgirls had much higher libidos than an average human, but were far less fertile. They always acted feminine and their cocks were almost always small.<br />
<br />
It was the subject of many studies, but the community had become shut off from the rest of the world - until Susan’s mother had created a thriving business catering to their needs. Susan had expanded on it with the Internet, and now with buncorp, dickgirls and the slutty women of town would be popular all over!<br />
<br />
Susan started jerking off her cock in the hot steam, enjoying seeing both her naked body and her beloved hairy cock.<br />
<br />
However, Susan’s head felt fuzzy once again. She’d been the prized dickgirl. She was unnaturally fertile, able to impregnate any one of the women in the town - however, her mother agreed to let Susan have a normal life, and part of that was going to college. College - where she’d met Thea. That’s right, she was almost disowned by the town. She’d had a child with an outsider and had even ruined many of Glendale’s women’s chances to get pregnant after Thea had convinced her to get a vasectomy. “And that still wasn’t good enough for her!” Susan shouted, her soundproofed walls ensuring only she’d hear it.<br />
<br />
Susan, now angrily jerking off, began to change once again. Her footlong cock began to grow to an astounding 16 inches, her balls growing even more to match the monster.<br />
<br />
Susan’s natural breasts had grown to an absolutely astounding O cup, tear drop shaped, but not saggy. Her hips widened further, her waist thinning even more as abs formed on her stomach.<br />
<br />
Susan, overall, became far more fit, her arms, stomach, and legs becoming extremely toned, but not freakishly so. Her ass expanded next, big and firm and proportionate to her huge tits. <br />
<br />
Susan’s face started to morph again, becoming younger looking. New memories filled her head of many of her clients thinking she was in her late 20s and being shocked when they found out she was 43, even when she wasn’t wearing any makeup. In fact, her new memories told her that when she was out with Jennifer, many confused them for sisters. Her lips expanded, but not like her employees with their collagen-filled DSLs. Her sexy face still had a hint of classiness and professionalism, contrasting with her exaggerated sex doll body and monster cock and balls.<br />
<br />
Susan’s hair changed next, the faded brown becoming a vibrant chestnut color with blonde highlights. Her former bob grew down her back as it thickened up. Again contrasting with her perverted body, she now remembered keeping it in a bun. She vividly remembered removing a hair tie when she’d gotten into the shower.<br />
<br />
Finally, as Susan’s balls tensed, the last of her new memories began to flood in. After Thea had broken her heart, she had to win the town’s trust back. Her mother hadn’t been in the best of health, and she passed before Susan could fix her own image. She’d taken over the town’s most beloved company as a failure and a humiliation.<br />
<br />
However, Susan wasn’t a quitter. She was the alpha. She was the WINNER. As her load shot out, she remembered just how she’d done it. Sending money to the right places. Making a vaccine that prevented any known STD and distributing it for free to the town - even if that meant eating into Sultry Smith’s condom sales. She even improved the town’s unsavory reputation by releasing the patent to the world for free. Glendale was still closed off, but it was no longer disrespected.<br />
<br />
She further reintegrated to her community by fucking as many of the town’s women and dickgirls as she could. Despite being infertile from her operation, the next largest cock in town was 8 inches, and her monster of a cock was an appealing alternative.<br />
<br />
She also developed a fertility drug for dickgirls. This one cost money, but it was included in Sultry Smith’s employee plan. That and the “enhancement” program she’d come up with ensured that she had a satisfied employee base and many families had at least one member working for Susan, enabling most of the town to get free cosmetic surgery and allowing many more women in town to get pregnant - if they wanted to.<br />
<br />
However, another important part of rehabilitating her image was marrying her trophy wife. As soon as Jennifer had come to town, many of the women treated her as an outsider. Assuring that she’d be raised correctly and fulfilling that promise by marrying Felicia, much of the town had long forgotten that their beloved Susan Smith had been an outcast.<br />
<br />
Susan finally jizzed all over her mirrored shower walls. Looking at herself in the mirror, she was completely ignorant of her changes.<br />
<br />
“God, this cock is fantastic. I’ll never get tired of you.” She said, her beloved rod already set to go again. “But I’ve got work to do, sweetie. We’ll go again later.”<br />
<br />
Drying off, Susan put her hair back in a bun and grabbed the clothes she’d tossed on the floor. Gone were her semi-business casual jeans and blouse. She pulled on a fresh thong and the shorts she now remembered wearing - black stretchy yoga shorts with “Sultry Smith’s” printed on her ass. She put on her custom fit push up bra to show off her beautiful tits and pulled on what had replaced her blouse. Her top was now a tube top that read “Sultry Smith’s Loves Big Tits!” stretched across her ample bosom. Again, Susan saw nothing wrong with this.<br />
<br />
Her heels were now black leather boots with an even taller heel. She pulled on some fishnet stockings which had replaced her pantyhose and slipped into the boots. <br />
<br />
She looked in another mirror. Tying her hair up once again, she readied herself for the rest of her workday.</p>
