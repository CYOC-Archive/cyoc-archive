<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The haze of lust had Nikka firmly in its grasp. Not noticing the damp feeling on her ass Nikka continued working her vag until she came. From the sound of it Emily also had reached her climax a loud wet pop over the phone betrayed that Emily had managed to please herself with much more then only a few fingers and Nikka quested it was egg shaped. It was then that Nikka noticed the literal mess she was in. The musk had mostly left the room through the window by this point.<br />
<br />
“Yuk, look Emily we need to do some research and come up with a plan if we are to get to Max and the others and I need to change some clothes. Can you come to my parents place so i can see if they are ok? I’ll send you the address”<br />
<br />
Emily also seemed to have regained her senses was quick to answer. <br />
<br />
“Yea ok I think a change of scenery will do me some good, I’ll try to make it over as fast as I can”<br />
<br />
“That is settled then I will see you there then we can make further plans and be careful not be caught”<br />
<br />
When Nikka got up and was a little disgusted with the state of her pants, she went to look if David had cleaned himself enough so she could inform him of her plans<br />
<br />
The bathroom emitted a sound of splashing water which stopped halfway on Nikka’s way to the bathroom door.<br />
<br />
“Hey are you about done there I need to talk to you about something”<br />
<br />
 “Yea almost I only need to dry myself thought a cold shower would do me good”<br />
<br />
Nikka heard some heavy clumsy clanks from hooves stepping on bathroom tiles when the door flew open. Nikka could not help herself but inspect David as he stood there in the door opening. Blushing slightly Nikka quickly regained herself.<br />
<br />
“I was just called from the vet where my boyfriend Max works”<br />
<br />
 “It looks like we are not the only ones with a unusual day today, It seems the entire town is dealing with this bizarre change. They are taking the infected away to somewhere”<br />
<br />
Nikka explained her conversation with Emily in some more detail and what they had planned but left the more erotic and Emily’s chicken attributes out of the story. No need to tell David just yet.<br />
<br />
David agreed with the plan to go Nikka’s parents their place but insisted on finding clean clothes first. David went to his closet and Nikka went down to get a new pair of pants.<br />
<br />
After going through several attempts to put on some pants David became quite frustrated.<br />
<br />
“Dam none of these things fit me anymore, can this day become any worse”<br />
<br />
Then David saw something he had forgotten ages ago, his kilt from his trip to Europe.<br />
<br />
“Well something is better than nothing”<br />
<br />
After putting on his kilt which barely covered his low hanging equine balls and a plain white shirt that used to be way too big for him David went slowly but steadily towards the elevator his hooves making clanking noises the entire way there.<br />
<br />
Nikka hurried toward her clothing cabinet and threw her old pair of pants into the corner of the room, This was the second pair of pants she worked through today. <br />
<br />
“Crap I forgot it was laundry day, i don’t have any pants left. Well it seems like I have no other option”<br />
<br />
Nikka grabbed her blue pyjama made of stretch cloth not noticing that her behind had swelled slightly larger. Her ass hugging the material of the pants. After that Nikka also went to the entrance of the building. The elevator was in use so Nikka went with the stairs.<br />
<br />
“I’ve never been lazy enough to do a little leg work why start now”<br />
<br />
When Nikka reached the button of the stairs the elevator doors opened revealing David who was holding the railing in order to stay upright still not being used to his new posture.<br />
<br />
“Well at least I’m not the only one wearing something out of the ordinary” Nikka said winking towards the kilt around David.<br />
<br />
“Yea, nothing else really fitted so i really did not have a choice”<br />
<br />
“Come lets go to my car, I really don’t want to wait here much longer”<br />
<br />
Nikka turned and walking toward the exit. David saw Nikka’s behind sway a little as she walked and got a distracted his penis started to swell in his kilt and started making a tent. David was so distracted that he tripped over his own hooves sending his face forward on the ground ending his lust prematurely. Nikka had left the building when he got back to his senses and David ‘quickly’ walked towards Nikka’s car in order to catch up to her.<br />
<br />
As Nikka unlocked her car he waited impatiently for David her thoughts going to unwanted places. Nikka continued daydreaming about how Max pleasured Emily before rubbing her vag slightly against the car. Nikka was pulled out of her daydream by the sound of hooves clanking on the asphalt.<br />
<br />
“What took you so long?”<br />
<br />
“Sorry I’m not used to my new legs”<br />
<br />
“Ah yea right well sit down”<br />
<br />
Mary and David opened the car doors and sat down. Nikka thought something was a little off about her point of view because her butt elevated her more than usual but could not really tell why. David had more trouble fitting inside the car which was not made for his bulk nor his equine legs. He barely cramped himself in head touching the roof and hooves scratching the plastic.<br />
<br />
As Nikka started the car she looked in the mirror did her ears look a bit more pointy then usual?  Nah that was just the fear talking she reassured herself and started driving.</p>
