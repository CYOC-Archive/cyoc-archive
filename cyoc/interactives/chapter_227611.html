<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;And now, it&#39;s time for a message from our sponsors,&quot; said a voice from above, and the program took a commercial break. Alice shot up, puppet cum still dripping from her shocked face.<br />
&quot;Oh my god,&quot; she said, and frantically wiped the cum from her body - or tried to. Despite being made entirely of felt, Sleazle&#39;s cum was somehow as slimy and sticky as the real thing. &quot;Am I dreaming? Is this a nightmare?&quot; she mumbled in a daze. To her disgust, the sex scene earlier had left Alice more than a little aroused, and she tried to fight off the warm feeling in her just-fucked loins.<br />
<br />
Then, Alice realized that she was free of the program&#39;s control. It must be the commercial break! She only had about 30 seconds to figure out a way to break free from this perverted TV show and get back to the real world. Alice spun around, seeing only the standard &quot;grassy hills&quot; set, before looking down at herself and seeing her normal, everyday tank top and jeans - along with the magic remote in her pocket!<br />
<br />
But before she could grab the remote and escape, Poggle bobbed up to Alice and grabbed her hand. &quot;Great news, Alice! The audience loves you so much that we&#39;re bringing you on as an official cast member!&quot; Alice tried to wriggle loose from the fuzzy green puppet, but its webbed hands held her with an unbreakable grip. &quot;Get off me!&quot; she shouted, but Poggle just kept staring with his vacant hinge-mouthed grin. &quot;We&#39;re so glad to have you sign on as a permanent member of the Ogle family,&quot; said Poggle, &quot;but for the sake of maintaining a consistent aesthetic, we&#39;re going to have to make a few changes!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about? Let go of me!&quot; Alice yelled, not really paying attention to Poggle&#39;s words. She had to get that remote immediately! But it was too late. The Ogles was back on the air.<br />
&quot;And now,&quot; declared the narrator, &quot;back to our regularly scheduled programming.&quot;<br />
Alice felt herself jolt out of position. All of a sudden, she was out of the camera frame and off to the side of the set. The transition left Alice jarred, enough to distract her from grabbing the remote.<br />
<br />
All of the Ogles were standing in a semicircle with a spotlight shining on Poggle front and center. &quot;Tonight, we have a special episode. I&#39;d like to introduce the newest member of the Ogle family,&quot; he announced. &quot;Everybody, give a warm welcome to the wonderful Jiggle!&quot;<br />
Clapping and cheering erupted from an invisible studio audience as Alice subconsciously stepped onto the set before she even realized what she was doing. But as she entered the frame, something bizarre happened.<br />
<br />
Alice&#39;s skin prickled strangely. To her horror, light purple fuzz sprouted from her skin, almost like one of the Ogles themselves. And as her hands entered the view of the camera, they were suddenly reshaped into the blobby, four-fingered hands of an Ogle. Her hair seamlessly transformed into a blonde wig made of synthetic fabric - just as shiny and maybe even more glamorous than before. To top it all off, her face instantly contorted into the simplified features of an Ogle: lavender felt skin, big cartoony eyes, a flappy puppet mouth, and the Ogles&#39; signature bulbous nose - hers was orange.<br />
Alice stepped onto the set with a gleaming grin on her goofy puppet face, but inside, she was overwhelmed with horror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, Jiggle! You sure have a beautiful body!&quot; one of the Ogles said, and Alice couldn&#39;t stop herself from saying &quot;Thank you, Foogle! I&#39;d be happy to introduce myself and my beautiful body in a song! Wouldn&#39;t that be nice?&quot;<br />
This can&#39;t be happening, Alice thought. I&#39;m a fucking Ogle! I need to get out of here!<br />
<br />
She brought her hand down to her pocket, expecting a lump where the remote was supposed to be, but felt nothing.<br />
Shocked, Alice looked down to see if it had fallen out, but somehow it was even worse: her clothing had turned to felt, and the remote with it. The pocket of her jeans was now simply a printed-on blue line, and the remote was nothing more than a gray square, completely flush with the rest of the felt.<br />
<br />
Alice frantically rubbed her hands all over the assimilated jeans, trying desperately to look for a seam, a zipper, something, anything. But the jeans weren&#39;t even jeans anymore. Her clothes were completely incorporated into her puppet body now. Her &quot;tank top&quot; was just a big patch of white felt on her torso, and her &quot;jeans&quot; had become nothing more than a pattern of blue on her legs. Even stranger, they were now part of her skin, and she felt her hands running over them as clearly as if she was touching her own face. Not that it was &quot;her&quot; face anymore.<br />
<br />
Alice felt a deep pit in her stomach as she stared at the colored felt on her thigh that was once the magic remote. Did she even have a stomach any more?<br />
<br />
Scene switch. Alice was jerked out of her despair by the croon of a song belting from her gaping puppet mouth.<br />
&quot;My name is Jiggle Giggles, and I&#39;m a jiggly lass! I&#39;d love for you to wiggle, and jiggle my jiggly mass!&quot;<br />
She bobbed up and down, punctuating each line with a bounce of her springy purple boobs. They were even bigger than when she was a human, and they bounced freely without any real clothing to contain them.<br />
<br />
&quot;As clearly you can see, I&#39;ve got a curvy body! I love all things shiny, and bright and gold and gaudy!&quot;<br />
Alice felt an inexplicable sensation, and she looked down to see that her entire body had been swapped out! <br />
Apparently her puppet body was modular enough that her torso and her lower body could be switched for different &quot;costumes&quot;. This time, her body had been switched for one &quot;wearing&quot; a gold dress and a fancy necklace, though both were still simply parts of her felt body painted different colors.<br />
<br />
Then, she was brought to the beach setting from earlier, now equipped with sunglasses and a skimpy bikini, and lying on the sand beneath an umbrella.<br />
&quot;I love to hit the beach and love to get a tan! But you know what my real love is? I love to love a MAN!&quot;<br />
And a very big, very masculine blue Ogle strutted into frame, with rippling muscles and rigid features. It was Papa Ogle himself. He didn&#39;t look much like he did on the normal kids&#39; show, especially considering the massive bulge down the front of his Speedo.<br />
<br />
Against her will, Alice sprung up and kneeled in front of the hulking Papa. She literally couldn&#39;t look away as she brought her face right up to his barely-restrained bulge and rubbed her cheek on it, her face locked in a vacant smile.<br />
&quot;Oh Daddy, won&#39;t you listen? You touch me everywhere! Your Jiggle needs a fiddle! Please take me, I don&#39;t care! Your strength, your musk, your stature! Your COCK, your COCK, please share!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jiggle pounced on Papa Ogle and pushed him on his back, and suddenly the scene changed once more, this time to a romantic bedroom scene. The two were lying on a large bed with scattered felt rose petals and a felt candle on a nearby felt nightstand.<br />
Alice felt another inexplicable sensation... of loss? Yes, she knew that it was the feeling of something being taken from her. She looked down at her body, which had been replaced with one &quot;dressed&quot; in skimpy lingerie. Then she puckered her lips. Wait, lips?<br />
Her head had been replaced with a different, more advanced head with better facial puppetry features, such as movable lips and more realistic eyes. This particular face also boasted bright red lipstick, thick eyelashes, and dark eyeshadow. This was, for lack of a better description, the face of a slut.<br />
Alice&#39;s head had been replaced. Her body had been replaced as well. She had been turned into a puppet, yes. But was she even the same puppet? Alice&#39;s mind was swimming in existential despair. This was a nightmare. Please wake up. Please wake u-<br />
<br />
Her lips met the strained fabric of Papa Ogle&#39;s bulge, and she dragged her face slowly up and down the throbbing shaft. With a cartoonish pop, the big blue cock bounced out of the exhausted Speedo and landed with a SLAP onto the slut-puppet&#39;s face. Jiggle&#39;s mouth dropped open in awe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy daddy, make me beg! Daddy daddy, make me CHOKE! I&#39;m a worthless fuck-puppet! Use me always &#39;til I&#39;m BROKE!&quot;<br />
She jumped onto Papa Ogle&#39;s humongous shaft and felt her own fabric stretching as her body struggled to accommodate its sheer girth. Fireworks were going off in Alice&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot; Papa Ogle growled.<br />
She bounced once. Fabric fibers struggled and popped under the stress. With glee, she blurted out &quot;Jiggle Giggles!&quot; Something broke in her head, and she felt it.<br />
<br />
Papa Ogle breathed heavily, clearly enjoying himself. &quot;Say that again?&quot; he said.<br />
&quot;Ji-&quot; she started. But- NO. This has gone far enough. She needs to end this NOW. Before it&#39;s too late. Desperately, she struggled to scrape together the willpower to defy the show. My name is- my name is...<br />
&quot;J- J-Ji...&quot;<br />
What was her name? What was her name?!<br />
Papa Ogle noticed the hesitation. He reached out and grabbed his felt fuckmeat&#39;s synthetic blonde hair. &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot; He thrusted. She bounced.<br />
&quot;J-J-Jiggle G-Giggles!&quot; she shouted. Louder this time. Something was lost. Her purple breasts bounced with her, sending lightning down her spine.<br />
<br />
Keep it together... She couldn&#39;t withstand it. She had to escape... She had to-<br />
<br />
&quot;One more time. What is your name?&quot;<br />
&quot;JIGGLE GIGGLESSSSSSS!!!&quot;<br />
Jiggle Giggles felt an unbelievable rush of pure, unimaginable pleasure as Papa&#39;s gooey seed rushed into her, bloating her like a balloon.</p>
