<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Well, Jackson was also here. Somewhat to Danny&#39;s surprise given how little contact the two had had recently. It seemed he was wearing a swimming cap today for whatever reason - if Danny had to guess, probably due to his hairline seeming different given the other issues going on. Looking at him, it seemed Jackson had recently shaved up his body - accentuating larger and stronger musculature than usual, but with a few slight patches of body hair remaining. Was he starting to realize what was going---<br />
<br />
Jackson stopped by a window and pumped his biceps, grinning for the reflection.<br />
<br />
There was the Jackson that Danny knew and remembered - and loathed, for being the first person he saw in regards to his girlfriend’s infidelity. And it was thus him that was going to get an outstanding transformation.<br />
<br />
Jackson might be seeing it as a blessing now, with just the muscles coming in by and large, but Danny could tell the less than positive effects would be showing soon. Just the swimming cap told him as much.<br />
<br />
Big muscular Jackson...how long was he gonna be interested in coupling with Sasha anyway?<br />
<br />
It seemed Terry and Gabe were progressing already, but by the looks of things, Jackson’s sexuality hadn’t really started changing...yet.<br />
<br />
Maybe it required a bit of calculation.<br />
<br />
After all, keeping the other two in mind...<br />
<br />
Nope, it seemed he was still satisfied with his body and looks. Just probably rationalizing what was happening recently. Probably still conscious about his hair though. Danny wondered how Terry and Gabe might react to this. So he decided to see if they&#39;d give a rather telling reaction. Just a matter of guiding Jackson over to the two of them. Which was a simple matter enough. Danny started to approach Jackson, waving, &quot;Looking good today, Jackson. Have you been working out more?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh yeah, yeah man, lot&#39;s more.&quot; It seemed to Danny that Jackson may well be on his way to noticing. Well, not much he could do about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Saw there were some hot babes over there, man.&quot; Danny led with that and hoped it would still be enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Well, let&#39;s see em! I came to get my body mired and find some hot hook ups. At least Sasha&#39;s here too.&quot; Danny just smiled as Jackson said that, and then led the way on over to the end of the pool where he knew he was going to find Terry and Gabe. The two of them and Jackson. It was gonna be a hell of a reaction that he was gonna enjoy watching. For whatever reason these transformations just thrilled him on a level he didn&#39;t really get.<br />
<br />
Danny adjusted his shorts to make sure nobody could see he was already nursing a half hard erection. Jackson strode along with his chest puffed out and a grin on his face. But were those some slight smile lines showing on the edges of his cocky grin?<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
“Hey Gabe…” Terry murmured as he stirred from his space sunning his hide. He barely even noticed the new slight ethnic changes to the way he and Gabe were looking these days. The slight difference in the look of their eyes, and the innate tan starting to show in their skin. Not to mention the other changes.<br />
<br />
“Yeah Terry?” Gabe was a bit shyer, but when Terry was around he usually managed to achieve a similar level of self assured outlook. At least, until there was any strain. Then Gabe tried to withdraw and keep to himself. For whatever reason these days, he was just not feeling as combative as he usually was!<br />
<br />
He just couldn’t place why that might be the case.<br />
<br />
“Jackson’s looking pretty good these days.” Terry said, not even realizing he had almost drooled when looking at the more muscular, tight and buff jock. Something seemed different about him these days too.<br />
<br />
More mature, more assertive in a different way than adolescent jock pushiness.<br />
<br />
“What?” Gabe said with a grin, “You like him, Terry? You wanna kiss him?”<br />
<br />
“What, me? No way!” Terry looked away for a moment, and then suppressed a blush, “I’m uh, straight as can be, my man. Straight as can be. Just uh, saying, as a guy I can really uh, recognize that Jackson looks really good.”<br />
<br />
He realized Gabe was staring at Jackson’s tightly muscled legs and derriere, but didn’t say anything - because when he looked himself, he found himself staring too. Maybe if he didn’t say anything, neither would comment on the other’s activities. Especially their recent, more queer dalliances. Gabe gasped, “D-Dare you to talk to him. We’re all like, bros here, right?”<br />
<br />
Not even realizing how this all sounded, Terry nodded, “Why do you want me to go talk to him? You feeling like you wanna talk to him about something? Eh? Eh?” Terry nudged Gabe, who looked away, blushing openly.<br />
<br />
“My guy, we have gotta do something…” Terry put his arms back behind his neck, “We’re acting like lovestruck girls! It’s just Jackson! We know him from the team. C’mon Gabe.” Terry pulled at Gabe’s arm - even reduced as they were, Terry was still slightly larger in build than the slender neatly toned Gabe.<br />
<br />
“A-Alright…” Gabe said and looked away, feeling bizarrely eager to do this. He had never felt this way about talking to a guy before. Let alone Jackson, “You lead for me, dude.”<br />
<br />
“W-Why me? You lead the way!” Terry looked back at Gabe.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Gabe...Terry…? Is that you guys?”<br />
<br />
Oh.<br />
<br />
Oh. Jackson was talking to them now, and Danny was standing right next to him. Terry only realized then how big Danny was, and how much of a true statement the whole Asian Adonis thing was. Now, Terry still thought of himself as a fully straight guy even though his actions spoke louder, but he could hardly help himself but squeak in response.<br />
<br />
“Are you guys okay?” Jackson asked, by now really noticing these two seemed off. Different, vastly different from usual.<br />
<br />
“Yeah we’re...we’re good. Just more toned than usual.” Terry flexed an arm and reflexively clenched his glutes, “We’re toning up. Don’t worry bro,” he said with a grin, “We’ll bulk back up.” Said the man who would not put on a pound of muscle unless he ate like a monster.<br />
<br />
“Sure, guys...woah, you two do look different. But I think it might be a good kinda different.” Jackson said, probably meaning it in a complimentary way.<br />
<br />
Though both Gabe and Terry took it more as flirtation, and the two looked at each other. Not knowing what to do going forward. Terry was no gay guy, he told himself, but he was feeling things toward Jackson he never felt toward any guy before ever. Maybe…<br />
<br />
Maybe, Terry told himself, he needed to just get it out of his system. Maybe these weird, gay thoughts worked like---like having a certain chemical need. He didn&#39;t know if that was how anything worked, but maybe just assuaging these needs would mean they&#39;d go away. And then he could go back to being charming Terry. Toned, tight bodied Terry and have lots of women want to fuck him today.<br />
<br />
And if that meant fucking one guy to get himself to that point...<br />
<br />
Maybe that’d work.</p>
