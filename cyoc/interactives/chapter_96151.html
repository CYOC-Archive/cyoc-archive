<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;C&#39;mon, DUDE!...we can&#39;t be doin&#39; THAT badly...&quot; Freddie interjected, only to be cut short by News 8&#39;s Anchorman, Carl Williams.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I&#39;m SERIOUS. It IS bad. I overheard the Boss and Murray in Financing. News 8 is treading water. Local news isn&#39;t really attracting the eyes we need, and most people go to the Web for National news now.&quot; <br />
<br />
Bill took another chug of his water. &quot;We&#39;re getting lost in the feeding frenzy over that 9901 Robot Lady.&quot; He sighed. &quot;We&#39;re barely holding on as it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, &#39;Least she KNOWS she&#39;s photogenic...She&#39;s on more stations and papers than the Kardashians now.&quot; Freddie paused thoughtfully.&quot;Though, I&#39;d say Kim K has the better @$$..Gnff!&quot; He grunted as he was elbowed in the ribs.<br />
<br />
&quot;SHE&#39;S potential ratings gold, Freddie, if we could play it the right way...make the interest ongoing...somehow...&quot; Carl turned on the breakroom tv and flipped from channel to channel.<br />
<br />
Since the robot woman, 9901, made her home in the docks of the city a bit less than a year earlier, the news stations AND the Internet exploded. She had come across as a bit of an Evangelist in a way...<br />
She certainly seemed to be everywhere...even in commercials offering the Sisterhood to all...<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, guys...a thought?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Lois?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Has she...Converted...anyone yet?&quot; Lois said with a thoughtful look on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that I&#39;m AWARE of, although the Paranoia websites are saying she&#39;s ALREADY changed over the whole White House and the Pentagon...Her way of bringing on Armageddon and the Rapture.&quot; Carl snorted with derision, paused, and then let off with one of his room-shaking sneezes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bless you. They heard that in Istanbul.&quot; Carly, the News 8 Sound and IT Girl snorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Far as I know, NO ONE has taken her up on it...Maybe it IS a government conspiracy...&quot; Freddie grimaced and then drained the rest of his orange juice. &quot;Hell, her infomercials kinda indicate everyone&#39;s missing out on eternal life...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, no one ever went broke underestimating mankind&#39;s stupidity or short attention span.&quot; Carl frowned. &quot;It&#39;s probably only BECAUSE of what she is that her 15 minutes is lasting MORE than 15 minutes...But this STILL doesn&#39;t SOLVE the problem...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Convertee...&quot; Lois murmured, then looked up at the News 8 Team. &quot;What if...we had a convert with us? To report the news?&quot; She was quiet for a minute. &quot;If 9901 was born and converted on another planet, she STILL might not really know how to talk with us... Maybe a liaison could help her, AND help the Station? &#39;Home of Reporter 9902&#39;...or something...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, she came to understand the WORST of us last week.&quot; Sheila, the redheaded anchor sat up and fluffed her hair. &quot;That gynoid hate group went down HARD...&quot; She gave a wicked grin. &quot;THAT was fun to watch...&quot;<br />
________<br />
<br />
They had approached the office building by the dock...and had started that day by picketing 9901 with signs. &quot;Go back HOME!&quot; said one, &quot;Terminate the Terminator&quot; said another, &quot;Earth for HUMANS!&quot; was expected...and a creative one,&quot;Tech&#39;s bastard stepchild&quot;. 9901 had responded by going outside and calling for peace...just before dodging the first Molotov Cocktail that smashed against the side of the building.<br />
<br />
The group had figured on little to no response from the alien gynoid...<br />
They were NOT expecting the small drone that doused them with itching powder 50 minutes later.<br />
<br />
This provoked a few more Molotov Cocktails, which now, ominously, hit the building and were somehow snuffed out immediately.<br />
A few of the group wisely took it as a sign to stop, but the others wouldn&#39;t be dissuaded.<br />
The cocktails flew again...30 minutes later...hit again...and went out AGAIN.<br />
<br />
It was then that they had heard the whisper of motion overhead.<br />
They looked up, as a rain of...of small blue...&#39;eggs&#39; fell from a small squadron of silver mini-gliders.<br />
<br />
The &#39;eggs&#39;, on impact, released a multicolored dye all over the person...and generated a smell that made skunk stink smell like fine perfume. The group members were left panicked, looking like running, screaming, itching tie-dye T-Shirts. They left after that.<br />
<br />
They tried it the next day, with fewer protesters. Another smelly bombardment solved THAT.<br />
________<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Sheila, at least she has a sense of humor.&quot; Carly said in admiring tone. &quot;Girl didn&#39;t take any crap!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But who is gonna take the plunge?&quot; Freddie said with a half-smirk. &quot;Who wants to own shiny silver skin? Not ME. I like girlfriends...I don&#39;t really wanna BE one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;d...be me, I guess.&quot; Lois said, nervously, twirling her ebony hair around her finger. &quot;Sheila and Carl are the Anchors, AND they&#39;ve got families, sooo...&quot;<br />
<br />
The whole room looked at Lois with the SAME expression, varying degrees of pity and WTF.<br />
<br />
Lois  plowed on. &quot;No...SERIOUSLY. What if I can get her to change ME on the air? THAT would catch eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone was quiet for a few moments. Finally, an enthused Carl broke the silence.<br />
&quot;THAT would be a GREAT idea, Lois...If you&#39;re up to doing it. Everyone wins. The station will get more eyeballs and revenue, 01 will get SOMEONE who can translate &#39;stupid human&#39;...and we&#39;d have the FIRST Gynoid reporter...&quot;	<br />
<br />
&quot;But...Ms. Hamilton...MAJOR downside...It&#39;s not like you can undo this...Change...if you don&#39;t like it,&quot; Carly said with a worried look on her face, pausing to push her glasses back up her nose. &quot;You&#39;ll be STUCK like that...PERMANENTLY.&quot; She crossed her arms. &quot;I mean...GRANTED...the Girl IS cool-looking, and sexy as hell, but you can&#39;t UNDO a bad case of &#39;Gynoid&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, if she WANTS to do it, and it helps keep our jobs, Carly, lets give it a go.&quot; Freddie frowned. &quot;We&#39;re all lucky we got what we have with the economy recovering slowly, like it is...&quot;<br />
<br />
Lois looked up. &quot;It&#39;s okay, Carly. Worst case...they kick me out of here and I move in with Ms. 01...*sigh* Do we have her number from those ads? After last week, I don&#39;t want to show up unannounced and give her a reason to smelly-bomb US...&quot;<br />
______________<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; said the slightly mechanical sounding female voice on the speakerphone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Ms....umm...9901? I-I&#39;m Lois Hamilton...I&#39;m one of the reporters on...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re on Channel 8.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhm, yeah...my fame precedes me, I guess.&quot; Lois let off a nervous giggle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you need something, Ms. Hamilton?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...yeah...I...&quot; Lois faltered, but looked at the members of her team, who were all moving their hands as to say, &#39;GET ON WITH IT!&#39; She took a deep breath and continued, &quot;I was wondering...this...Conversion...you were talking about on the major networks...d-did anyone do it yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
The robotic voice picked up in enthusiasm a touch but stayed otherwise steady. &quot;Not yet. Unfortunately. Your people are still too scared at the thought, no doubt. It IS a pity, because it IS a safe and enjoyable process.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would...you like to PROVE that, live, on the air?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I WOULD...VERY much so! As you say...name the time and place. I&#39;m ALWAYS ready to back up what I say.&quot; 9901 paused. &quot;Are...you offering to have yourself Uplifted, Ms. Hamilton, or will it be someone else in your news team??&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummm...I-it&#39;ll be...ME...I guess. I propose we film and broadcast the process. If it&#39;s as good as you say...umm...WE...will be able to prove to everyone what&#39;s involved...that it&#39;s SAFE...and help people decide if it&#39;s for them...I-I could probably keep reporting from the station in that form and get people used to-to..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To US, my Sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lois&#39; face went bright scarlet at the surprising warmth in the Gynoid&#39;s tone. &quot;Uhm...Yeah.&quot; That&#39;s one WELL-programmed robot, she thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;When do you wish to have it done and on the air?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like it if we can do it today, for tonight&#39;s newscast...That is...i-if you have time in your schedule today, Ms. 9901.&quot; <br />
She&#39;ll probably be TOO busy, Lois thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds WONDERFUL, my dear Sister! Today is a quiet day for me. We&#39;ll have plenty of room and time. How many will be showing up, besides you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Three others. Billy...my Camera guy, Carly...my sound and tech girl, and Freddie, our light guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would...any of them be interested in joining you in an Uplift?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lois looked at each of the three and saw the worried looks cross their faces.<br />
&quot;I&#39;d say &#39;no&#39; at this point. One of &#39;em is married, one in college and one is...not interested. Their significant others and parents MIGHT be a tad freaked out if they came home as a...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Strange &#39;robot girl&#39;?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhm...yeah...sorry...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a problem, Ms. Hamilton. The ONLY way fear can be defeated is facing it head-on. That&#39;s a truism throughout the Universe. I&#39;m the &#39;Fear&#39; in this case...You know where I&#39;m located?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That old office building at the Docks?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you would say...BINGO.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice work in taking care of those idiots last week, by the way!&quot; Sheila interjected loudly, her red hair swishing around as she leaned forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah...You would be Co-Anchor Sheila McCullom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah...&quot; Sheila said, surprised...her face went full-on blush in seconds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; 9901 sounded proud.  &quot;They were deluded souls so I wished to use non-lethal, non-toxic deterrents to get them to leave, without depriving them of their First Amendment rights. I actually got the idea from a few things I found on your World Wide Web: small RC planes, combined that with what I&#39;ve read on your wars, paintball, skunks, and passive restraints...and help from one of my Sisters who was kind enough to...umm...phone in...the help I needed.&quot; <br />
<br />
She paused.<br />
<br />
&quot;I MUST say...there is an ASTOUNDING amount of sexually-oriented material all OVER your Web...Much with rather...nasty attachments for your computers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ms. 9901...look up &#39;Internet rules&#39;...&#39;Rule 34&#39;, specifically.&quot; Freddie quipped.<br />
<br />
&quot;FREDDIE!&quot; Lois barked, facepalming, as he leaned back chuckling, and Carly giggled quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rule...34...?&quot; They heard her mumble, confused. &quot;AH!&quot; She giggled. &quot;Hee! Understood, Mr. Freddie!&quot; Her voice brightened even more, &quot;Ms. Hamilton, I&#39;ll see you...and your team then. Safe travels.&quot;<br />
_______________<br />
<br />
As the News8 News van rumbled down the city streets, Lois stared out the front passenger window, her stomach doing flip-flops.<br />
<br />
WHY am I doing this? Am I crazy? she thought. Have I given up on life so BADLY that I&#39;m willing to go...robot?<br />
<br />
Lois looked at her reflection in the glass as the spring scenery rushed past. Well, I won&#39;t have to worry about my knack at attracting BAD boyfriends...and I haven&#39;t spoken to Mom or Dad for years, since I got out of their religion. It&#39;s just me, and I&#39;m pretty good at being by myself.<br />
<br />
As they pulled into the parking lot, Lois watched as Emissary_9901 stepped out of the door of her property, right on time.<br />
<br />
Hrm... Probably was tracking us via some kinda internal GPS. Lois thought with a half grin.<br />
<br />
Twenty minutes later, they had set up on the first floor of the old office building. They had uplinked to the satellite and were waiting. Lois, clad in a one-piece silver swimsuit (that seemed to magically adjust to fit her), listened via the earpiece as Carl in the studio segued to her, live. She took a deep breath and began,<br />
<br />
&quot;In the nine months since &#39;Emissary_9901&#39; appeared on our planet, in our city specifically, she&#39;s been very much the celebrity, and has been surprisingly open about her...unique...mission: To convince the human race...as a whole, and individually, that life as a Gynoid is preferable to being human. True to her mission, she has been very open and honest about all questions posed to her. But the one thing missing in the conversation is a common point of view...How can she relate to what we humans think? How can we understand what digital thoughts cross her mind?<br />
<br />
By, as Neil Armstrong once said, making a &#39;small step&#39;.<br />
<br />
I have offered...and Ms. 9901 has accepted...my offer to be...&#39;Uplifted&#39;...as she calls it...<br />
<br />
Here. Now.<br />
<br />
If this works, I will be able to hopefully describe the feelings and existence to all of you in my new...um...form...That SAID, let&#39;s begin...&quot; Lois looked over as 01 stepped beside her on camera.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do I have to do, Miss 9901?&quot;<br />
<br />
01 gestured over to the side with an open hand, and Bill followed, focusing in on what seemed to be a roughly rectangular, human-shaped, soft, silver beanbag, braced backwards at a slight angle. Its&#39; silvery, mercury-like surface rippling in the air currents of the warehouse like the surface of a lake.<br />
<br />
&quot;First of all, I can tell you&#39;re quite nervous and frightened. And WHY you&#39;re nervous. That&#39;s NATURAL... and, given what you and your people currently know of me and mine, COMPLETELY understandable.&quot; 01 looked back to Lois with such...love...on her face, that Lois was speechless for a moment. &quot;I...am...SO very grateful to all Above Us that you will give me the chance...and show others of your kind...how beautiful this form of Being can be...&quot;<br />
<br />
She paused, and ran her fingers over the edge of the machine.<br />
<br />
&quot;What can you do? As best as you&#39;re able...RELAX. This should feel like getting a full-body massage.&quot; She chuckled. &quot;Besides, even if you TRY, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be ABLE to remain tense for very long. I wasn&#39;t able to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve...done this before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I went through this MYSELF, Ms. Hamilton, a few millennia ago as you count time...and it&#39;s STILL a memory I MOST cherish...&quot;<br />
<br />
01 gently reached out for the microphone, and handed it off-camera to Carly. Lois nervously removed her headset as 9901 reached out her hand to Lois.<br />
<br />
Lois took a deep breath, then another, and gently grabbed the silvery Gynoid&#39;s hand. 01 lead the nervous reporter (followed by Carly and the microphone) over...and helped her get into...the &#39;beanbag&#39;.<br />
The surface rippled and flowed around Lois, and she heard a faint humming as the capsule stretched, accommodating her dimensions comfortably. She felt cushiony supports form under her in key spots. &quot;Oh, WOW...This f-feels like I&#39;m in the middle of a warm spa.&quot; She murmured.<br />
<br />
01 just nodded with a gentle smile as the process began...<br />
<br />
The SolidFluid began to glow a soft yellow overall.<br />
<br />
Bill adjusted the focus to show as much detail in HD as possible.<br />
<br />
Miniwavelets began to build and began to caress Lois&#39;s hands & feet. In and out like the tides they went, until the human hands and feet had gone...replaced with silverish skinned ones much like 01&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Those body parts seemed to glow for a long minute, as if they were absorbing something from the fluid. The glow then progressed up her arms and legs slowly, seeming to magnetically pull the rippling/wave effect up the extremities.<br />
<br />
Lois let out a soft, contented moan.<br />
<br />
Carly watched, fascinated, as the glow and the wavelets seemed to...wash away... the human flesh, leaving behind more grayish silver gynoid skin.<br />
<br />
The glow then moved into Lois&#39;s torso and neck, fading at first, and then, over a minute and a half, reversing itself, reappearing and gaining in strength in the core of the torso.<br />
<br />
The waves caressed the area for a long minute, provoking another long, contented moan from the subject.<br />
Slowly, the unitard and the flesh were...erased...and replaced with the same grayish silver polymer on the arms and legs.<br />
<br />
The wavelets seemed to subside for a moment, and everyone could see gold and orange accent lines throughout her new skin start to glow, steadily building in intensity all over her body.<br />
<br />
Then the wave effect began to caress the body again, and the golden glow moved up the neck and into Lois&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
Lois moaned and gasped happily and cracked open her eyes...now identical to 01&#39;s and glowing a rich yellow-orange.<br />
<br />
Moments later, they closed.<br />
<br />
The wavelets pulled the silver over her lower face, once again replacing flesh with polymers. The red lipsticked lips and rouged cheeks were replaced with shiny black lips and grayish silver skin.<br />
<br />
Another moan came forth, this time with a distinctly mechanical timbre. Lois tipped her head back in ecstasy. It disappeared below the surface for another long minute before reemerging.<br />
<br />
Aside from the overall structure of her facial features, she now looked like 9901.<br />
<br />
Lois (?) remained still for a minute as the remaining glow faded away, and with it, the wavelets. The surface retracted back to the silvery waterbed surface.<br />
<br />
The new gynoid&#39;s eyes opened, and blinked a few times. Carly saw her irises adjust, getting bigger, then smaller, adjusting to the lights.<br />
<br />
Carl and Sheila studied the new gynoid who was just &#39;born&#39;. She was about half a head taller than 9901. The glowing parts of her silvery-grey skin, like 9901&#39;s, were an orange-gold, as were her optics and her holographic brows, hovering JUST over the surface of the head skin. Gracing the top of her head were raised &#39;strips&#39;, which appeared to be a heat sink, apparently to help the new gynoid&#39;s digital brain vent any excess heat. They looked very much like carbon-fiber dreadlocks.<br />
<br />
9901 stepped forward with her hand out. &quot;Sister, Welcome!...You are a liaison...a Diplomat between your former people and ours, and so, you are now &#39;Diplomat_9902&#39;...&#39;9902&#39; for short.&quot;<br />
<br />
9902 stared lovingly into 9901&#39;s eyes, and then looked over at the filming crew. A gentle smile crossed her face. She grabbed 9901&#39;s hand and pulled herself up, while pushing herself out of the capsule at the same time with the other hand. It was clear from the longing look on her face that she wished the process had lasted a while longer.<br />
<br />
You could hear a pin drop in the office AND in the news station.<br />
<br />
9902 heard something...shift...in her head.<br />
<br />
What happened next almost felt like what the humans would call an out-of-body experience. For what seemed like forever, 9902 could no longer feel her new systems...<br />
<br />
She felt like she was on a...cloud...and all she could feel was...LOVE.<br />
<br />
For HER.<br />
<br />
Trillions upon TRILLIONS of voices like her own, greeting her, calling her Sister...and filling her to overflowing with their love and acceptance...and the JOY at her Rebirth.<br />
<br />
9902 was just completely overwhelmed, drowning in a sea of something she had wished her whole human life to experience but never had. Any fear that had survived the Conversion was utterly obliterated now. Curious now, she hesitantly reached out to one...node...one Sister&#39;s soul...and suddenly could see her clearly. Her name was 22916, she was a Engineer, a very CREATIVE one. 9902 could see where she was in the Galaxy, and that her BOF (best organic friend) seemed to be ready to take the plunge and join the Sisterhood. &lt;_Give her a hug from me when she Wakens, Sister!&gt; 9902 thought. A joyful mental hug came from 22916, before her soul seemed to...DANCE with joy...back into the whole.<br />
<br />
&lt;_THIS is what we&#39;re TRYING to teach the humans, 02.&gt; 9901&#39;s soul warmth caressed her. &lt;_They are scared that they&#39;ll LOSE EVERYTHING: Themselves, their HEARTS, their SOULS, their MINDS, their beautiful...Lights...All they ARE...but they DON&#39;T.&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;_They&#39;re AFRAID...I was afraid, 9901...of just becoming a...a pretty robot...a pretty machine...Something that has to be told what to do and what to think. A-a DOWNGRADE.&gt; She paused a moment before finishing, &lt;_From someONE to someTHING. THAT&#39;S...absolutely terrifying. I looked at YOU, Sister, 20 minutes ago...and just wondered...Is that the case? Isn&#39;t she just a result of a bunch of &#39;handshaking programs&#39;...someTHING pretending to be someONE?&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;_Wellll?! ;) :D  &gt; 9901 thought between peals of mental laughter.<br />
<br />
9902 got drowned in a wave of love and joy from her again. When she &#39;spoke&#39; again, she did so with a bit of embarrassment in her &#39;voice&#39;...<br />
&lt;_ 0////0... I...didn&#39;t expect this..It&#39;s a...REAL relief, actually... It&#39;s...amazing. We&#39;re...still...REAL...We&#39;re ALIVE...not THINGS...and we&#39;ve got the secret of an enjoyable life...the LOVE and hope and...oneness that they&#39;re still struggling to find.&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;_SHOW them that, Sister 9902. Make them WANT to join us.&gt; 9901 thought... &lt;_There is STILL so much sadness, anger and pain on this planet AND out in the Galaxy. It would be selfish and immoral to keep this for ourselves...to not even TRY to give them a hand up.&gt;<br />
<br />
And suddenly, she was back in her body, all systems normal.<br />
<br />
9902 hugged 9901 tightly for a minute and let off a strange happy...warble(?). She wiped the green optic fluid off her cheeks before turning to Carly and extending an open, silvery hand.<br />
<br />
Ohmigawd...she wants ME to-to do...Carly thought, panicked, before she noticed that the silvery hand was now pointing to the microphone..&quot;O-oh, RIGHT! S-sorry, Ms. Hamilton...I...&quot; She handed the microphone over...<br />
<br />
And freaked out as the gynoid reporter&#39;s face darkened in anger, as if she was going to scream at her...but she stopped, as 9902 looked at the silver hand of 9901 resting FIRMLY on her bicep.<br />
<br />
9901 frowned a bit and shook her head slightly, but noticeably.<br />
<br />
&lt;_NO. We MUST let them KNOW first, Sister...&gt; The familiar, gentle voice flowed across her new neural net.<br />
<br />
&lt;_B-But, SISTER! You HEARD her!!! She called me...THAT! I...I&#39;m NO LONGER...her!!! HOW DARE SHE...!!!! &gt;:((  &gt;:((  &gt;:(( &gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;_Ssshhh...CALM, Sister. It was NOT said in malice. You KNOW this. It IS improper, of course, but they do NOT know any better. Until the day they each join Us in joy, how CAN they understand the import of that to Us? You are our only Earthen Diplomat for the moment, my Sister...and, thus, you are their sole teacher on our ways...&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;_Right. B-But...STILL...! &gt;:(  &gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;_You would have done the same at MY Uplifting...Correct?&gt; 01 thought quietly.<br />
<br />
9902 was silent, but nodded, shamefacedly. She felt her anger start to bleed off.<br />
<br />
 &lt;_To get used to calling someone a human name...and then have to suddenly call them by a number? We must give them leeway, 02...Hold off on the Outrage until/unless they do it knowingly, just to hurt.&gt; 9901 paused. &lt;_Besides, keep in MIND, WE usually have to refer to our old self for quite some time as those around us adjust...&gt;<br />
<br />
9902 shot a side glance at Carly, who, spooked, looked like she was ready to run from the building. She sighed, nodded and calmed herself with effort, then smiled. She looked at Carly, off-camera, patted her hand gently and whispered, &quot;It&#39;s okay...be calm...&quot;<br />
<br />
Bill handed her the communications headset, which 9902 held to her ear pod.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you hear me, Carl? This is 9902.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We hear you, Ms....um...9902. That was an interesting process. How did it feel to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
9902 looked into the camera, with a wide smile. &quot;Quick and painless. I wish I could do it AGAIN! What did it FEEL like? Carl, Sheila...someday you HAVE to try it! It was like...the BEST full body massage I EVER experienced...combined with sensations that might be described as a bit...erotic. That said...How do I FEEL? Surprisingly, much the same as I was when I got in the capsule. Normal. I feel COMPLETELY like...ME.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow. THAT&#39;S a high bar!&quot; Sheila half-joked. The redhead sobered. &quot;What&#39;s different with what humans feel that you can reveal off the top of your head?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sheila...not sure if I can explain the SCOPE of this, but let me try...Hmm. The only differences I feel physically is I don&#39;t feel my heart beating...(It&#39;s more of a quiet humming), and my mind isn&#39;t racing. I&#39;m able to focus on the task at hand without the usual internal babble filling my head. All my memories are intact...and I can feel, hope and love as all of YOU do. The OTHER difference is SUBSTANTIAL: I just was congratulated by about 260 TRILLION gynoid sisters...in my head...from all across the Universe...I&#39;m SO happy I want to dance the crew around here! It&#39;s...it&#39;s...You can talk with ANY Sister...anywhere in the Universe. In your head. I&#39;m so filled with LOVE right now I&#39;m surprised I&#39;m not vibrating...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sheila froze for a moment, stunned speechless.<br />
<br />
Carl spoke up. &quot;Forgive my curiosity and bluntness, but your name...is a NUMBER now? What about your...um...Earth name?&quot; <br />
<br />
 &quot;Carl, thanks for asking that. This is ME now. I feel most comfortable with my new name. All of you, I ask that you please do me the courtesy of calling me &#39;Diplomat_9902&#39; or &#39;9902&#39;. &#39;9902&#39; would be preferred. I haven&#39;t stood on ceremony up to today, and THAT, at least, is NOT changing.&quot;<br />
<br />
02&#39;s eyes looked off camera briefly and an apologetic smile cracked her face, before she sobered and re-focused a second later.  &quot;I do NOT wish to be called &#39;Lois&#39;, &#39;Lois Hamilton&#39;, or &#39;Ms. Hamilton&#39; from this point forward. I have...moved past...that aspect of who I was. If you see one of our people in the future, please DO ask what they wish to be called. We consider it both courtesy and good manners.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sheila said, &quot;Understandable. Any final thoughts, 9902?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Thank you, Sheila. A big question is probably, &#39;You say you&#39;re feeling...LOVE? Can&#39;t be. Isn&#39;t that just programming? You ARE a machine now.&#39; I&#39;m sure quite a few of you are thinking this. <br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
We are NOT just machines...&#39;robots&#39; as you consider the term, like the ones welding your cars together or the ones your robotics engineers are developing. We are NOTHING THAT simplistic. We prefer the term &#39;inorganic intelligence&#39;, which describes our complexity more fully. The emotional complexity in each of YOU is ALSO in US in equal measure. That which made the old me...ME is still in here.&quot; 9902 tapped the center of her chest with her open left hand lightly. &quot;I can still think...and act..how I feel best...and I&#39;m GLAD I took this chance to grow and learn, as nerve-wracking as it was in the beginning. This is Diplomat_9902 for Channel 8 news...Back to you, Carl.&quot; 9902 gestured out of frame to cut the feed, and it was a second or two before a stunned Billy did so.<br />
_________<br />
<br />
A half hour later, the group was headed back to the Station, and it was VERY quiet in the van.<br />
<br />
9902 shot a furtive side glance over at Carly. The twenty-one year old met her eyes briefly before hurriedly staring back out the window.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay, Carly?&quot;<br />
<br />
Carly flinched at the robotic voice and looked over at the gynoid with the &#39;dreads&#39; sitting in the front passenger seat, before stammering, &quot;I--I...Yeah...um...Ms. 9902. S-Sorry I called you...THAT...I just...I mean...I...&quot;<br />
<br />
9902 gave a gentle smile. &quot;Hey. Sorry I REACTED that way. Something like the Change takes some getting USED to for BOTH of us, okay?&quot;, watching as the girl nodded, still freaked out. She rested her left hand on Carly&#39;s right knee. &quot;That one was on ME. You can&#39;t be expected to read minds, Carly...I should&#39;ve SAID something when I Awoke, but I got...distracted.&quot; <br />
<br />
9902 continued to watch as Carly gently felt her silvery skin and the luminous golden yellow fingernails with curiosity. She felt some of the tension in Carly fade, and her vitals began to drop closer to normal. &quot;Keep in mind, The &#39;Outrage&#39; IS a common reaction among my Kind, though. We tend to get...prickly...if called by our EarthBorn names. I consider my human experiences valuable, but...it&#39;s a &#39;past life&#39; now, or...a &#39;closed book&#39; in a way. So to be called &#39;Ms. Hamilton&#39; again was almost as if...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I opened the &#39;book&#39;...was insulting you... Making you out to be...a lesser being...like me, I guess...&quot; Carly said nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Not in that way, Carly.&quot; 9902 paused, and gave her knee a gentle squeeze. &quot;More like...not acknowledging what happened...my Change...who I AM now.&quot;she paused and her mental pathways went into overdrive as she gathered her thoughts. &quot;I&#39;m STILL me, but...there&#39;s NO denying...it&#39;s a BIG event. It changes your life AND your perspectives to a large degree, and...&quot; she paused. &quot;Can I be honest?&quot;<br />
<br />
Carly nodded. &quot;Sure...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It DOESN&#39;T seem like it from your point of view. I KNOW that. The thought is probably absolutely terrifying...&#39;She wants me to become a robot! I don&#39;t want to be a mindless...thing... running programs for the rest of eternity!&#39;&quot;<br />
<br />
She watched as all three nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks to the creators of &#39;Star Trek&#39;...and the Borg, in particular, for that little gem.&quot; 9902 paused and looked at Freddie and then back to Carly. Her sensors indicated that she had Billy&#39;s attention, as well, before she continued. &quot;But...I found out...that&#39;s NOWHERE near the case.&quot;<br />
<br />
All three of them were listening intently.<br />
<br />
&quot;The ONE thing that EVERYONE wants...and NEEDS...that makes life worth living...is LOVE.<br />
<br />
Love of family. Love of friends. Love of God. Fair assessment?&quot;<br />
<br />
They nodded.<br />
<br />
They...WE&#39;VE...figured it out. Try remembering when you felt love strongly...when you wanted to cry with happiness...Now, put it on the Internet and link it up to your head. 24/7/365. Trillions of people FILLED with love. Filling you to overflowing, caressing you, comforting you, giving you hope...<br />
<br />
Available all the time when you most need it...and vice versa. What could you DO with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
She grinned broadly again. &quot;THAT&#39;S the first thing I felt on Awakening.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds better than Internet Porn.&quot; Freddie cracked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup.&quot; 9902 grinned. &quot;You&#39;ve got NO idea.&quot; and sighed blissfully. &quot;It hit me like a ...a...giant feather filled...hammer (to mangle metaphors). BA-BOOM. I JUST joined the Sisterhood...and...my Sisters LOVE me. They ACCEPT me...It&#39;s as mind-blowing as when I found out that we REALLY do feel. It&#39;s not programs EMULATING emotions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You DO have programming, though.&quot; Bill said pointedly, switching lanes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, we DO. But its&#39; role is in the background...like on you guys, they&#39;re primarily support/maintenance...running our autonomic body functions, internal repair, job direction. They&#39;re not part of the higher mental functions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Job direction&#39;, 9902?&quot; Carly said, with an evident curious tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re a species of well-functioning obsessive-compulsives. At least in ONE area.&quot; 9902 joked. &quot;Kinda like the Borg...but benevolent.&quot; She sobered. &quot;What I felt...amazing...overwhelming LOVE...I want EVERYONE to experience that. Life should NOT be lived alone...feeling unnecessary, unwanted and unloved for 80-90 years or so before physically deteriorating and then dying.&quot; <br />
<br />
She looked at Carly and noticed the girl didn&#39;t pull back. She was listening intently.<br />
&lt;_Wow. Perhaps...she might be ready?&gt; 9902 thought, making an internal note. A nanosecond later, she continued. &quot;To KEEP that love for ourselves, as 9901 reminded me in HeadLink, is both selfish and morally wrong. THAT&#39;S why 9901...and I...want to Uplift EVERYONE. Why we want to be TOTALLY honest. To take away the fear of this. This is TOO good to keep just for ourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you guys feel sadness or disappointment, 9902?&quot; Carly said. She paused and gave a nervous half-smile, &quot;We know...umm..you can feel anger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rule of Thumb...If YOU can feel it, Carly, WE can, too...but we&#39;ve pretty much cleared out MOST of the things in the psyche that create fear and anger, and we are ALL accessible to each other to help, support & love, so largely, we&#39;re a BIIIIIIG happy clan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone was silent for the rest of the trip back.<br />
<br />
______<br />
<br />
As the team walked back into the station, they were greeted by Murray Stein and Louie Adelman, their boss.<br />
<br />
Both men were grinning WIDELY.<br />
<br />
The phones to the station had been ringing OFF THE HOOKS from the &#39;Uplift&#39; broadcast. Most good...some bad...but very few neutral.<br />
<br />
&quot;They want to know when they&#39;ll see Ms. Ham...&quot; Louie began.<br />
<br />
He was interrupted by Carly holding up her hands...<br />
&quot;DON&#39;T use that name, Louie! She&#39;s 9902. Forget that she was called that...other name...PLEASE.&quot; <br />
<br />
Freddie chimed in with a terrified face, &quot;TRUST me...PLEASE, Boss...We don&#39;t want her Hulking out again...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys...c&#39;mon...I wasn&#39;t THAT bad...&quot; 9902 sighed, rolling her eyes, and then walked up to her boss. &quot;Well, let&#39;s make this official, then. Mr. Adelman, I&#39;m your on-the-spot reporter 9902...Nice to meet you. Again. I&#39;ll be taking over from the aforementioned Ms. Hamilton...She&#39;s gone on to brighter fields, so to speak.&quot;<br />
______<br />
<br />
Two weeks later:<br />
<br />
Friday, 2pm<br />
<br />
&quot;Could...I talk with you, 02?&quot; Carly said nervously, as they finished packing up the van.<br />
They had just finished 02&#39;s report on the robbery and murder in the local &#39;Handyman&#39;s&#39; Store.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carly lead the silver gynoid over to the side of the NewsVan. She could hear Bill talking on his iPhone™ near the front of the van.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you had any legal problems since you Converted, or was it...you know...smooth sailing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Been relatively easy since I was well-known beforehand, and the Change happened on live TV...The government has discontinued my Social Security payments, since I&#39;ll outlive everyone human now so my check is a bit bigger...But...ANYWAY...I still have to get around to the DMV and get an updated license, and a few other things.&quot; Her eyes widened, and she smiled, &quot;You want to JOIN us?&quot;<br />
<br />
Carly&#39;s face flushed a deeper scarlet and she nodded, looking into the golden optics. &quot;I...think so. Are your roles assigned, or do I have a say in what I want to be focused on for the rest of my life?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want to do?&quot; 9902 looked thoughtful as she leaned against the van. &quot;That&#39;s usually what we ask FIRST. What EXCITES you? What are you passionate...obsessive...about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you guys have something like Engineering? I...LOVE...building things...fixing my family&#39;s cars...fixing their computers aren&#39;t as fun, but I like the challenge. I put together my gaming system at home. I&#39;m dabbling in creating stuff in 3d. I build BattleBots with my friends Dianne & Carol...&quot; She blushed. &quot;I took apart my bicycle at 5 to just to see how it worked.&quot;<br />
<br />
9902 remained silent for a moment. &quot;What were you majoring on in college?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Architectural Design&#39; and &#39;Mechanical Engineering&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carly could all but see data streaming back and forth between the Gynoid and her Sisters. For some reason...she felt...envious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...If you LOVE building/constructing/repairing, you DEFINITELY sound like an Engineer. We have a dedicated Caste for that. That is a BIG Caste, by the way...Building the future NEEDS Engineers, after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do the Engineers repair YOU guys when things go wrong?&quot; Carly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. They DO collaborate with the Medical Caste at times, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait. They fix things, though...you guys...You&#39;re mechanical in n...&quot; Carly began, confused.<br />
<br />
9902 turned sideways, and closed her eyes for a moment.<br />
Carly watched, stunned, as the panels in 9902&#39;s abs flashed with the gold...and then her torso sections seemed to...disintegrate.<br />
<br />
Carly looked at her friend&#39;s internals. Odd, dark gunmetal-colored, plastic and gel-like glittery shapes with blinking pinpoint lights greeted her eyes. She could see what looked like parts of 02&#39;s alloy skeleton, and her musculature, but the rest left her confused. It looked NOTHING like a human&#39;s insides. She was tempted to touch them, but figured it wouldn&#39;t be good if it caused something to fritz & break (especially with no Medics on hand), so she refrained. She still stared in amazement.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...Uh...What...IS...ARE...these things..?&quot;<br />
<br />
02 looked at her...and the torso plates began to re-materialize, moments later leaving her looking like normal. She smirked. &quot;THAT&#39;S why. Just like with humans...You want a doctor that is fully specialized and knowledgeable on your anatomy, right? We&#39;re Inorganics, but we&#39;re NOT a car. The Engineer skill set is amenable to creating/repairing buildings and support devices/vehicles, but NOT to human or Gynoid anatomy. Not without HELP, at least. We consider them two separate but related fields.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And THAT&#39;S your Gynoid tip for the day...&quot; 9902 smiled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I-Is 9901 busy tonight? Could I and a friend stop by?&quot;<br />
<br />
9902 got that glazed look on her face for a moment, then looked at Carly and smiled.<br />
&quot;She&#39;s open tonight. If you want to get it done, just stop by. Won&#39;t take any longer than it did with ME. Give you the weekend to adjust to your new life...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool...&quot; She paused. &quot;02?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for being &#39;normal&#39;...umm...you&#39;ve taken away a LOT of the fear of this.&quot;<br />
<br />
The hug from the gynoid was, strangely, soothing.<br />
__________<br />
<br />
Friday, 7:05 pm<br />
<br />
&quot;Here we go, right HERE, Lin.&quot; Carly pointed out the Older office building in the fading light.<br />
Her friend, Lin Huang, pulled into the parking lot, and pulled into the parking space next to a silver Toyota Camry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, 02&#39;s here...her car&#39;s here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lin yawned and then looked at Carly, a serious look on her face. &quot;You SURE you know what you&#39;re doing, Girl? This...This...is permanant...You SURE you WANT this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Carly sighed as she got out the passenger door, slamming it shut as her friend did too.<br />
&quot;Lin, don&#39;t worry. I was there when they changed the News reporter, Lois, ...and I WORK with her...She&#39;s 9902 now and is still normal...and as WEIRD as she was before. I&#39;ll be FINE...Just one thing...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;DON&#39;T call me Carly when I get out...&quot;<br />
<br />
Lin raised an eyebrow and shrugged, but nodded gamely. A worried look crossed her face. &quot;Okay. whatever. W-Will this take long, Carly? I have to get home and get back to studying for my classes...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From what I saw with 9902, Should be...at MOST 25 minutes. I already got the paperwork signed that 9901&#39;s lawyer gave me, so I should be in and out...&quot;<br />
<br />
They entered the building and were greeted by 9902 in the foyer.<br />
The gynoid was very happy to see Lin, and Lin was interested to meet one of the local celebrities.<br />
<br />
Carly looked to her left, at the well lit, well-equipped alcove with the gray cloth sofas by either wall. It was formerly two offices, now changed to one big room with the machine in it.<br />
<br />
She took a deep breath and walked nervously toward the &#39;beanbag&#39; device.<br />
(That was 9902&#39;s name for it, and given that it DID look like a weird silver beanbag chair...it DID seem to fit.)<br />
<br />
She got about a foot away and her body came to a stop.<br />
A-Am I REALLY going through with this?! If I&#39;m wrong, this&#39;ll be a BAD way to spend eternity...<br />
Maybe I should just...<br />
NO! Damnit! You signed the papers! You&#39;re committed! Now get your A---<br />
<br />
&quot;Fear, I&#39;d guess, Carly? Second thoughts?&quot; came the slightly electronic voice from behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yeah, 02...Third, fourth and fifth ones, too. W-What if something doesn&#39;t work? And I&#39;ll be...!&quot;<br />
<br />
Carly felt the comforting warm, silicone-like arms wrap around her.<br />
<br />
9902 remained silent for a minute and continued the long hug. &quot;You&#39;ll be FINE, Sister...Trust me...you&#39;ll see...You&#39;ll be like me, and you&#39;ll wonder WHY you were so frightened.&quot; The gold eyed gynoid gave her a kiss on the head with her shiny, black lips. &quot;Put your fear aside...you can DO this, besides... I want to see the LOOK on Freddie&#39;s face monday Morning when he finds out there are TWO of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carly nodded and then gave her friend a final squeeze. She took a deep breath, pulled free...and then got into the &#39;Beanbag&#39;...<br />
<br />
She felt tense as she felt the &#39;foam&#39; supports form to cradle her body.<br />
<br />
This is IT, Carly thought. Mom will be calling me 9903 soon.<br />
Then AGAIN, She&#39;ll flip out when she sees this...<br />
She said a quick mental farewell to her body as the pulsations began...<br />
<br />
&quot;O---ohhhh.&quot; Now...I get it...Feels SOO good.&quot; She murmured. &quot;EVERY...CELL...is being...massaged...&quot; Carly felt as if she was in a spa in Heaven...and just relaxed into the sensation, savoring every bit of it...the warm, gentle &#39;water&#39; lapping at her...<br />
<br />
She zoned out into bliss...Time stood still.<br />
<br />
She was nudged from her blissful state as the machine powered down and the waves stopped lapping. <br />
&lt;_AWWW!&gt; She thought grumpily. &lt;_JUST when it was getting GOOD!&gt; The new gunmetal-skinned gynoid&#39;s red optics fluttered open. She paused, and then grabbed the sides of the &#39;beanbag&#39;, pulling herself upward. She stared somewhat blearily at her human friend as her vision adjusted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sister...&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked over to see a very happy 9901, and 9902.<br />
9902 came over to hug her, then 9901 reached out with her hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sister.&quot; she said softly, lovingly. &quot;Welcome to the Fold. You are, as you WISHED to be, an Engineer. You are &#39;260316-423-518600/Eng&#39;, to be precise...&#39;518600&#39; or &#39;600&#39; for short. Bring your joy and gifts to this world...&quot; She paused, and, as the world turned white, 600 heard: &quot;Ohh...There are congratulations in order...from your Sisters... ;) &quot;<br />
<br />
Lin watched from the nearby couch as the red-eyed and red accented Gynoid, her...friend(?), froze like a statue, gazed skyward with an elated expression, as neon green optic cleaner/lubricant rolled down her cheeks. <br />
<br />
Why did I volunteer to drive her over here for this? Lin thought, yawning. On TV, 9901 is so into this, she&#39;s like... They SEEM nice enough, but STILL...Lin looked around nervously at the room she was in.<br />
She talked about having all the time in the world, so no pressure on us...but can we trust them on that?<br />
Lin felt the fabric cushion bounce her up as a body plopped down next to her.<br />
She looked to see her newly changed friend, looking quietly at her with glistening red optics.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Before you ASK, Lin...Call me &#39;600&#39;...It&#39;ll be easier to remember than my FULL serial number.&quot; 600 rested her gunmetal-skinned left hand on Lin&#39;s right and gave a slight squeeze.<br />
<br />
Lin stayed silent, but, at the words, she started to tear up.<br />
<br />
600 turned on the couch to face her more. &quot;Why?&quot; she said, a worried look on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;They&#39;ve given you a number, and have taken away your name...&#39;&#39;&quot; Lin whispered as the tears streamed harder.<br />
<br />
600 held her, quietly, rocking her while the girl sobbed.<br />
<br />
Two minutes later, the tears subsided, and Lin felt the warm silicone-like skin cradling her. &quot;S-sorry, Car...600...I just...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Overwhelming.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tissue?&quot; The Engineer held the nearby tissue box at her friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks...&quot; Lin nodded silently and grabbed one, daubing the tears from her eyes before she looked up into concerned red optics and asked, &quot;Are YOU okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, never felt better.&quot; 600 looked at her friend with a half grin and ventured, &quot;This is...pegging your &#39;Weirdness Level&#39;, amirite?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lin yawned. &quot;YOU&#39;VE got a serial number. My best friend since high school now has a V.I.N. The Weirdness needle is WELL off the charts, 600, and is, right now, headed to Pluto.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What...did you feel, by the way?&quot; Lin questioned, poking and rubbing the skin of 600&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Think the ULTIMATE spa...&#39;Kay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lin nodded. &quot;Got it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Multiply it by AT LEAST 4. Combine that with a vibrator acting on EVERY cell of your body...&quot;<br />
<br />
A black eyebrow raised, and a faint smile cracked her face. She yawned. &quot;Oooooh. Riiiigghhht.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d get back IN there, but it won&#39;t feel the same now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Silicone skin doesn&#39;t massage as well?&quot; Lin grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Basically, yeah...!&quot; <br />
__________<br />
<br />
9901 remained silent as she connected with the audio and video feed from the room.<br />
<br />
&lt;_9902, do we have anything on 600&#39;s friend?&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;_Yeah...Lin Huang. 20 Years old. 3.7 point GPA student at Gilliam College. She seems to want to be a doctor. She&#39;s taking a solid courseload of the pre-med basics: General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, General Physics, General Biology, Calculus...AND Biochemistry. She&#39;s CERTAINLY not leaving anything to chance. Has a Mother, Jia Huang, Father Quon Huang, and four year younger brother Shen Huang.&gt;<br />
&lt;_You think she MIGHT be amenable, 02?&gt;<br />
&lt;_She hasn&#39;t run screaming from the building, 01, after watching the Rebirth...so I&#39;d look at that as an early positive sign.&gt; 02 watched the feeds internally and thought, &lt;_It might be good to leave them alone for a bit...If WE show up, she might panic...She&#39;ll feel surrounded...&gt; <br />
&lt;_Fair enough, 02. If 600 NEEDS us, she&#39;ll note us.&gt;<br />
&lt;_02?&gt;<br />
&lt;_Problem, 01?&gt;<br />
&lt;_02...I am NOT sure how she is able to function. She WORKS part time, and spends what time is left between college and studying. When does she eat and sleep?&gt;<br />
___________<br />
<br />
The digital clock in the dashboard resolutely blinked &#39;7:45&#39;, as the car bobbed along in the near-blackness on the Parkway, headlights splitting the darkness with the help of the road lights on the grassy dividers as Lin drove them back to their apartments.<br />
<br />
The radio station was in the middle of playing &#39;Mr. Roboto&#39;, ironically enough.<br />
<br />
600 smirked at the music choice as she stared out the window, noting the glow of her optics in the reflection.<br />
<br />
&lt;_This has been...amazing...&gt; she thought. &lt;_Funny I was so scared, and so curious at the same time...02 must&#39;ve picked it up in the van almost instantly after SHE was Reborn...I SOO hope that Lin opts to join us...We&#39;re gonna need Workers, but I&#39;d prefer to have a Medic on hand FIRST, just to be on...&gt;<br />
<br />
The series of angry honks brought her attention back. Cars with human drivers were scrambling to get out of the way as their car drifted across the lanes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lin?&quot; She barked.<br />
<br />
The driver&#39;s head lolled to the side, deep in sleep.<br />
<br />
&lt;_DAMNIT! She was yawning before! Why didn&#39;t I pick up on it?!&gt; She shook Lin again. &quot;LIN!!!&quot; <br />
&lt;_SCREW this. We DON&#39;T have TIME! How can I control...?! I can&#39;t get my feet over the console!&gt;<br />
<br />
She indelicately knocked the human&#39;s hands off the wheel and sawed it back to the center.<br />
<br />
&lt;_How do I STOP...?! WAIT! The emergency brake!&gt;  600 reached to the lever in the back in the center console with her right hand as she steered with her left. Her mind was in overdrive running simulations on how to get back to the side of the road safely. She managed to get her car back into the right lane, then, with a tooth-rattling BUMP, onto the grassy shoulder as she said a prayer...<br />
<br />
Then she pulled the emergency brake into the full upright position.<br />
<br />
There was a strident wail from the overtaxed rear drums as they fought against the throttle.<br />
<br />
&lt;_Damnit! Off ramp in the next 800 feet! If we DON&#39;T get off the GAS we&#39;re gonna be in a HELL of...&gt; <br />
<br />
Her optics caught motion as Lin revived...<br />
And went into full panic mode.<br />
<br />
&quot;SHHHEEEEEEEEE---IITTTT!&quot; LIN roared in panic, as she saw the light pole rapidly approaching the front of the car... She mashed the brake pedal into the floorboard.<br />
<br />
The spray of uprooted turf increased for what felt like the longest minute of Lin&#39;s life...and what felt like a THOUSAND years to 600.<br />
<br />
The car screamed in protest another few feet and came to a shuddering stop less than two inches from the solid concrete base of the pole.<br />
<br />
&quot;C-Carly...S-six Hundred? Y-you okay?!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...you&#39;re awake? Have a nice beauty sleep?!&quot; 600 cracked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;D-don&#39;t think I&#39;ll sleep AGAIN...! Oh! Dear! GOD! We NEARLY...!&quot; She wrapped her arms around the Engineer with a strength that 600 didn&#39;t expect, and cried with relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;S&#39;okay...kiddo...just don&#39;t do it again, please.&quot; She said, rubbing her friend&#39;s back. &quot;I just GOT the Upgrade...the hospital wouldn&#39;t know how to fix...&quot;<br />
<br />
W-WHOOOPPP! <br />
<br />
Flashing red and blue lights.<br />
<br />
&lt;_Crap. NOT unexpected, but STILL...&gt;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, GOD! I didn&#39;t MEAN..!&quot;<br />
<br />
The officer knocked on the window.<br />
As Lin rolled the window down, 600 looked at the officer.<br />
Male, athletic, short, brown hair, about 5 foot, 4.265 inches. Badge number 60503.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going ON here?! Are you DRUNK?! What&#39;s WRONG with you?! You VERY nearly took out at LEAST five cars back there!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I&#39;m s-sorry, Officer...I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Officer, &#39;Scuse me. I&#39;m her friend. My apologies. She fell asleep. I tried to wake her up but it was like waking Dracula during the DAY...So I tried to get the car to the shoulder and stopped safely. She woke up near the end and hammered the brakes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, you&#39;re one of those...robot people, like that reporter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yessir. I&#39;m 260316-423-518600/Eng, Please call me &#39;600&#39; for short.&quot;<br />
<br />
His concern focused again on the frazzled Chinese-American in the driver&#39;s seat. &quot;Why were you driving? Didn&#39;t you feel tired earlier?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry!!! I-I was running late this afternoon and...and...I didn&#39;t get my usual MegaFrappuccino to keep me awake to study...but I felt okay when I brought Carly to her appointment...and felt okay when we started the drive home.&quot;<br />
<br />
600&#39;s jaw dropped. &quot;LIN?! You&#39;re using COFFEE to stay awake? WHY?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lin&#39;s eyes widened in panic. &quot;I&#39;ve got to study MORE, 600! I&#39;m falling behind in my pre-Med classes...If I don&#39;t PASS them...!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;IF YOU F***ING DIE, you&#39;re not gonna pass them EITHER!&quot; 600 roared angrily.<br />
<br />
The cop stepped back at the enraged gynoid&#39;s voice, and noted that the driver jerked back as if slapped. He sighed. &quot;License and registration, Miss, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lin, in tears, fished around, and produced the documents. Handed them over.<br />
He wrote in his note pad briefly, and then handed them back.&quot;Thank you, Miss Huang.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;T-thank YOU, sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked over at the ruby-eyed gynoid. &quot;Miss...600...Why didn&#39;t you drive? Do you have a license?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I DO, Officer, but I was...Changed...today. I don&#39;t totally match my DMV picture anymore. I have the paperwork in, but I need to get it updated at the DMV, hopefully this weekend.&quot;<br />
600 handed over her human license. <br />
<br />
He studied it, and brought the flashlight up a bit a few times. &quot;Okay, Miss...uh...&#39;600&#39;, I can see the facial resemblance. Here.&quot; He handed the license back to the gynoid, who nodded her thanks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Switch positions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Officer, I&#39;m not sure if I can drive legally now...&quot; 600 began worriedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss...&#39;600&#39;. Unless you can TELEPORT this car to her house, or you want to have us DRIVE you two home, please do so. I can let you SLIDE here if you obey the limit and get to your homes SAFELY.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Understood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Furthermore, the fact you managed to keep this Parkway from becoming a charnel pit speaks for you and your new...skills.&quot;<br />
He looked at Lin again. &quot;And YOU, Miss...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is my beat. I do NOT want to see you out on these roads BEHIND that wheel EVER AGAIN if you are ANYTHING less then well-rested! You are SO. D@MNED. LUCKY. that your friend here was able to keep this Parkway from turning into a disaster area! The LAWSUITS would&#39;ve been off the CHARTS! Reminder: You are driving a 2,000 pound piece of steel, glass and rubber moving at 55 miles an hour! This, by ALL rights, should&#39;ve ended SO badly...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;AM I UNDERSTOOD, YOUNG LADY?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yessir...!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Switch positions!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lin opened the driver&#39;s door, then opened the driver side passenger door, and got in the back seat.<br />
<br />
He looked at 600. &quot;You can come around...&quot;<br />
<br />
She hopped nimbly over the console and buckled up. At his confused expression, the gynoid noted, &quot;We&#39;re already attracting SOME rubberneckers, Sir. If I go out there NOW, it&#39;ll be...&#39;oooohhh...Nudie robot girl!&#39; They&#39;ll be backed up for MILES.&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked at the slowdown on the road, and the other cops headed his way. He nodded. &quot;Good point. You know how to operate this vehicle?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m an Engineer, Sir. Right NOW, I could take this poor thing apart and put it back together with my optics closed.&quot; She raised a red holo-brow. &quot;Driving is even EASIER. No sweat.&quot;<br />
<br />
*sigh* &quot;I&#39;ll follow you...JUST to be sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yessir. Thank you VERY much, Officer.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was silence as 600 rolled up the window, and the Officer walked back to his car and the other Patrol car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, 600...I just...I made a promise to myself...AND to Mother...that I&#39;ll be a doctor...but I...&quot;<br />
<br />
600 turned the engine over, and eased the poor, battered, grass-covered car off the grass and back onto the Parkway. Since they had overshot their exit, she called up her MindLink to the overhead satellites to figure out how to get home. Milliseconds later, she had it, and, despite its&#39; mechanical moaning, she nursed the car forward and slowly increased speed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lin, I&#39;ll be a LOUSY Engineer if I don&#39;t take care of MY systems...You&#39;ll be LUCKY to become a doctor if you don&#39;t take CARE of YOURS...You should KNOW better...!&quot;<br />
*pipp*<br />
&lt;I.M. To: 9901/Ems: Do we have info on course load for Lin?&gt; <br />
&lt;I.M. To: 518600/Eng: We do, Sister. (enclosed) Problem?&gt; <br />
&lt;I.M. To: 9901/Ems: (open, read) Oh, Wow...<br />
Sorry, 01, Yep. Problem was Sleepdriving. VERY Near car crash. Nearly took out multiple cars, Including OURS.&gt; <br />
&lt;I.M. To: 518600/Eng: *concern* Is she okay? Are you, Sister?&gt; <br />
&lt;I.M. To: 9901/Ems: Yep. She&#39;s scared as Hell. I&#39;m fine. Angry, worried, but fine.&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. To: 518600/Eng: Remind her (Gently) that we will help her...become...a Doctor if she so wishes.&gt; <br />
&lt;I.M. To: 9901/Ems: OK. I&#39;ll see what I can do. &#39;Night, Sister.&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. To: 518600/Eng: Night, my Dear.&gt; <br />
*pipp*<br />
A nanosecond after she spoke, 600 spoke again to Lin. &quot;Why not spread it out? Between your JOB and what I&#39;ve...heard...of your courseload...HOW do you have time to SLEEP? Or are you living on MegaFrappuccinos?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...HAVE to...make it count. Money for school...Barely enough. Father&#39;s still looking for another job, Mother&#39;s arthritis keeps her home for now, Shen is TRYING with school and the Home Center, but it&#39;s only helping so much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot;<br />
<br />
600 drove in silence for a minute and then asked, &quot;What does Shen DREAM of doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Artist.&quot; The drowsy voice muttered from the back seat. &quot;He LIVES...to draw...to paint...for a pencil or pen or paintbrush and paper...what he CREATES...! House is FULL of his sketches, paintings...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What about your Mother?&quot;<br />
<br />
*Yawn* Nurse...Wanted...to be a...Doctor. It&#39;s BAD. Even WITH the medicine, can&#39;t be doctor...Too much for her bones now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your Dad? Doesn&#39;t he like building stuff?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeahhhh...&#39;ngneer, like youu...&quot;<br />
<br />
&lt;_Well, if they&#39;re UP to it, IF she&#39;s on target, and IF we can bring them IN, we could have:<br />
• 2 Doctors (Medical Caste)<br />
• 1 Artist/Creative (Artisan/Design Caste)<br />
• 1 Engineer (Engineering Caste) <br />
&lt;_Let&#39;s see what we can do to help you, my Sister...&gt; 600 thought, looking in the rearview mirror at the belted, sleeping form in the back seat. &lt;_And your family, as well. Your love should be assisted and helped to GROW for ALL to see it...But...We&#39;ll see...&gt;<br />
<br />
600 smiled lovingly as she steered the poor old front-driver to Lin&#39;s home, the police cruiser close behind.<br />
_______<br />
<br />
Fifteen minutes later, they arrived on their street, and pulled in front of their apartment building. 600 parked, shut off the engine, grabbed her fanny pack, and got out onto the quiet street, as the cruiser pulled in behind them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lin...Lin...&quot; 600 shook her gently until she roused, sleepily. &quot;C&#39;mon, kiddo, you&#39;re home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Soo TIRED...lemme sleep...&quot; she moaned.<br />
<br />
600&#39;s sensors noticed the lights going on in Lin&#39;s apartment, and the front door opening as they went up the steps, followed by the officer...<br />
<br />
Lin&#39;s father opened the door. He was a toned, wiry man about 6 foot tall with short cut black hair with some grey .<br />
He was, obviously, worried at this sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;What HAPPENED here, Lin?! Why the Police? What is this...THING?&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;Father...*yawn* had near...accident. This...is...WAS &#39;Carly&#39;...She joined... robot ladies...Drove her there... I...&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;This cannot be Carly! How is this...?! And ACCIDENT?&gt;&quot; He looked at his daughter&#39;s small car, splattered with dirt and grass. &lt;&quot;What is...going on?!&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;I am no longer called &#39;Carly&#39;,  Mr. Huang. I would be honored if you would call me &#39;600&#39;, please. As far as the Accident...Lin was driving me home after my Rebirth...and she fell asleep behind the wheel while at speed on the Parkway.&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Huang&#39;s face paled.<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Scuse me, folks...do you speak English?&quot; The officer said.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huang nodded. &quot;Of course, officer. My apologies. What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
The officer gestured to 600. &quot;Your daughter fell asleep going about 60 miles per hour on the Parkway...&quot; <br />
<br />
He paused as he noticed Mrs. Huang painfully limped up behind her husband. <br />
Mrs. Huang was shorter than her husband, about 5 and a half feet tall, She had brown hair pulled up in a bun. She was a bit heavy, weightwise, and leaned rather heavily on the foldable aluminum walker with her.<br />
<br />
He noted this and continued, &quot;She said that she had been studying for her pre-med and was living on MegaFrappuccinos to keep her awake...but she ran late to pick up Miss...600 for her Change. She forgot her evening caffeine &#39;fix&#39; rushing out the door...and when things calmed down, driving the way home..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Dear. God.&quot; Mr. Huang muttered, pulling a half-asleep Lin to his chest, grateful to all above his little girl was still alive.<br />
<br />
The officer gestured to his left, to the gunmetal skinned, red eyed gynoid standing next to him. &quot;If Miss 600 here hadn&#39;t been in the car with her friend, Miss Huang...and at LEAST five other families would be dead...&quot;<br />
<br />
Miss Huang nudged her husband aside, staring at 600 with almost disbelief.<br />
&quot;You...look like Lin&#39;s friend, Carly Anderson...&quot; Mrs. Huang&#39;s gnarled fingers gently traced down 600&#39;s cheek. <br />
<br />
600 twitched in irritation, but pushed it down. &lt;_Annnd...NOW I know what THAT feels like...&gt; she thought. &lt;_Anyhoo...STOP it. Calm the hell down, 600...don&#39;t be a douche.&gt;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...am...I WAS...Mrs. Huang. Please call me &#39;600&#39; now. Have you made any of your famous dumplings?&quot; 600 watched as the older woman&#39;s eyes widened.<br />
<br />
&quot;It...IS you?! You loved them! You...can EAT them, now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...can...Not the same amount as before, but...yeah.&quot; 600 looked around.<br />
&quot;May we enter? Lin NEEDS sleep and she&#39;s NOT going to do it HERE.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...yes...Of course! Sorry!&quot; Mr. Huang bowed his head in embarrassment, and slowly guided Lin into the house, watching as his wife slowly moved to the side.<br />
<br />
600 and the officer got in and closed the door behind them, and Mr. Huang scooped up his daughter and brought her to her room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Officer, for your help with my daughter. I regret the inconvenience she caused you...She has been working HARD, and I very rarely see her anymore. If I had known she was keeping herself awake as she HAD, I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s NOT a problem, Mrs. Huang, she is an adult, but she&#39;ll make mistakes like ANYONE will. I just wanted to make sure both of them got home safely.&quot; The officer smiled and tipped his hat. &quot;Hopefully, it SCARED her enough so she won&#39;t make that mistake again.&quot; He shot a side glance at the Engineer and smirked. &quot;I believe Miss 600 will be...quite angry...if she tries that again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You got THAT right, Sir...!&quot; 600 nodded, seriously.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must get back on duty, Ma&#39;am. Thank you for your time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will see you to the door.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ma&#39;am...Please don&#39;t. I can see you&#39;re hurting. They&#39;re predicting thunderstorms and rain for tonight. My Mother has arthritis too, so I know how bad it can get.&quot; He gave a sad smile and tipped his hat. &quot;Please rest...I&#39;ll let myself out. Have a good night.&quot;<br />
The door closed behind him.<br />
<br />
Lin&#39;s mother looked at the somewhat nervous gynoid. &quot;Although this is...strange for me, géxià...Thank you for saving her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve known her...and you two...for 12 years, 5 months, 13 days, 15 hours, and 43 seconds.&quot; 600 said. &quot;In EITHER body, I wouldn&#39;t want to see her...or you two...harmed. She is a sweet soul...and is proof that the kindness of the two of you is genetic.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It is...hard to accept...that the...old you...is IN this new body, Miss 600. I saw the reporter on Channel 8 when she had it happen to HER, she seemed SO happy. You work with her, correct?&quot;<br />
<br />
600 nodded. &quot;Yes. We&#39;re co-workers. She saw my curiosity of this after her change...and encouraged me that Becoming like this would broaden my horizons...and make it easier for Life to help bring me my dreams. She was RIGHT. I look forward to the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...aren&#39;t you afraid of what you lost, dear?&quot;<br />
<br />
600 shook her head. &quot;I lost VERY little. Fear. Loneliness. I am thankfully STILL me...just with a body Upgrade.&quot; She reached out and held the elder woman&#39;s hands. Her sensors read the damage that the woman&#39;s malfunctioning immune system was wreaking on her joints.<br />
She felt the wetness fall down her face, and blearily saw the surprise register in Mrs. Huang&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You...cry? Your people...can cry?&quot; Mrs. Huang whispered, wide eyed with wonder and surprise.<br />
<br />
600 gently pulled her right hand free to scrub the green tears from her eyes. She nodded. &quot;Yes. We cry because we LOVE. Because we FEEL...To see you in pain like this...in EITHER body...hurts me to see...I...I&#39;m sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It hurts ALL of us to see her like this,&quot; Mr. Huang said as he walked into the room. He sat down next to his wife and gave her a peck on her head. &quot;But there is little we can do. Especially NOW.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;That&#39;s...not true. Mr. Huang. There IS a way to fix that...and help your family financially...but...&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;But what, dear?&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;Tell me...If either of you could do ANYTHING as a job...something that moves your hearts to joy whenever you would work...what would it be?&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;Seriously, 600?&gt; Mr. Huang got a puzzled look on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;NEVER been MORE serious, Mr. Huang. Humor me, please.&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr Huang remained quiet for thirty seconds or so.<br />
&quot;&lt;I would wish to get a job designing bridges and buildings...To create strong architecture, dreams in steel and glass, wood, brick & concrete... edifices that inspire everyone in the future...&gt;&quot; He sighed. &quot;&lt;But unless you KNOW someone, I&#39;m finding it impossible to get a foot in the door...Much less get a steady paycheck again...&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
600 nodded and then looked at Mrs. Huang and tipped her head to the side like a listening bird.<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;MY Joy...would be to heal others...to be a Doctor.&gt;&quot; Her voice deflated as she looked at her gnarled hands, felt the throbbing in her hip joints...and 600 watched as the older woman&#39;s hope visibly fled. &quot;&lt;But like THIS, I cannot...&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;What if you COULD, Mrs. Huang, Mr. Huang. It IS possible...&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Huang was silent. &quot;&lt;To become as you are...&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
600 nodded. &quot;&lt;YES...But only IF you feel you are UP to taking that step...&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;To become a...machine?&gt;&quot; Mrs. Huang said nervously. &quot;&lt;Sorry...I think the Gynoid Reporter called you...what...&#39;Inorganic Intelligences&#39;?&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
600 nodded. &quot;&lt;Spot on, Mrs. Huang. Good memory. Thanks! Yeah. I&#39;m an &#39;Inorganic  Intelligence&#39;. <br />
<br />
TECHNICALLY, I AM a &#39;machine&#39;, to a degree...but I&#39;m also MUCH more than that. I have circuits, crystals, self-healing polymer skin, Multilevel Crystalline Memory and an alloy skeleton...  We consider &#39;machine&#39; to be a demeaning, derogatory term when applied to us. A WASHER is a &#39;machine&#39;. It CAN&#39;T think or FEEL or DREAM or LOVE. All it&#39;s CAPABLE of is washing clothes.&gt;&quot; 600 looked at them and grinned. &quot;&lt;WHEN was the last time you held a conversation with your washing machine...and, NO, cursing at it DOESN&#39;T count.&gt;&quot; <br />
<br />
Mr. Huang did the laundry to help his wife, so he chuckled. &lt;&quot;THAT, I&#39;ve done PLENTY of...&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;WHY would you...become like this? Become...inorganic?&gt;&quot; Mrs. Huang said, with a puzzled and slightly apprehensive look on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;The advantages won me over...this brings me to my dream job in Engineering with built-in advantages FAR BEYOND anything I could dream of as a human being...&gt;&quot; 600 paused and stared at the floor for a moment, gathering her thoughts, before looking up and continuing with a smile, &quot;&lt;Being human WAS...and IS...wonderful, in its&#39; own way...but...the unconditional love I get from my Sisters now FAR surpasses anything I felt when human...Makes me LOVE my human friends NOW MUCH more readily...without the fears getting in the way...&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
The Huangs looked at each other, surprised. This was not what they expected to hear from Carly/600... &quot;&lt;How does THAT work, dear?&gt;&quot; Mrs. Huang said, curious.<br />
<br />
600&#39;s grin got WIDER. &lt;_This is an EASY one!&gt; &quot;&lt;Mrs. Huang, let&#39;s imagine a bit. BOTH of you, close your eyes. Relax. Now, envision that you each have a mental link to each other, and to Shen and Lin...and THEY have the same link to you...Okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Huangs nodded, their eyes closed.<br />
&quot;&lt;What would happen if one of you felt fear or panic? If you felt panic from Lin at her falling behind? What would you do if you could SEND your love and comfort? How would that HELP your family? If, in an emergency, you would KNOW where the others were?<br />
Would&#39;t that bring you closer together?&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
She paused. &quot;&lt;Another one: What would Mr. Huang, Lin or Shen be able to do if they could sense your frustration, sadness and pain due to your arthritis, Mrs. Huang? If they could send you LOVE, on the spot, or help you with cooking or if you need help during the week. Would THAT help you deal with things?&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
600 paused again, as both of the Huangs teared up and Mr. Huang held his wife closer to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;Got that?&gt;&quot; 600 said. The Huangs nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;Let&#39;s step it out FURTHER. Let&#39;s say your OTHER loved ones: Aunts, Uncles Grandparents, Parents...were in on this link. Distance no object. Each of you could send love to them individually, or send it as a group &#39;hug&#39;. You could TELL when they were depressed or fearful and be there for them instantly, and vice versa. How would that change all of your lives?&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;We&#39;d drive each other insane?&gt;&quot; Mr. Huang cracked with a semi-grin before sobering.<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;I haven&#39;t had that problem since I&#39;m so new, but I hear that we get some of that occasionally with the Artisan Caste.&gt;&quot; At their puzzled expressions, 600 clarified. &quot;&lt;Sometimes, our Artists, when they &#39;show&#39; their works to the Great Family...inspire some of the Sisters in the other Castes...and they get INUNDATED in nanoseconds with &#39;helpful&#39; ideas and suggestions...&#39;Oooohhh, you could do THIS&#39;...and &#39;THIS would be worth trying&#39;...&#39;Try THIS...might work&#39;..&#39;And, whatabout...&#39; <br />
<br />
THAT is usually followed by a &#39;CLOSEOUT&#39;, basically the Artisan Caste hanging up a &#39;Do Not Disturb&#39; sign, until the other Castes calm down.&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Huang giggled furiously, tears coming to her eyes. &quot;&lt;Oh, my, my...&#39;I&#39;m in my Special Place, you can&#39;t SEE me?!&quot;&gt;<br />
<br />
600 nodded, with a lopsided grin.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huang had an embarrassed grin, as he picked up one of the sketches lying on the nearby table. &quot;&lt;WE&#39;RE guilty of that with Shen...It drives him nuts...&gt;&quot; He thought for a minute. &quot;&lt;As an Engineer, 600, too bad you can&#39;t create a headband to SHOW us what you all can feel.&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
600 nodded, and started basic design ideas for it. &quot;&lt;Hm...It CAN be done, but I THINK it might have to be tuned to each person specifically, or there&#39;d be horrible headaches or worse.&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
She frowned and looked at Mrs. Huang.  &quot;&lt;Again, the BIG problem for Us NOW is: There are VERY few of Us. We have NO earthen Medical Caste at the moment, and THEY would be the ones we&#39;d have to be &#39;hands-on&#39; and collaborate with to calibrate the device properly. Aside from that...we&#39;d also probably have to limit the number of Sisters you can contact and talk to...I&#39;d think 260 Trillion people mentally saying &#39;Hello&#39; might be a...TAD overwhelming...&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Huang mimed his head exploding, with a grin on his face. &quot;&lt;Too true.&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;I&#39;ll discuss this with my Sisters in Engineering, and get input from the Medical Caste, if I can. IF we can make this work...safely...would you be willing to try it? To see what I&#39;ve been raving about?&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
The Huangs looked at each other, curiosity on their faces, then looked at 600 and nodded. &quot;&lt;That PROOF would be helpful in making such an important life decision, 600...not JUST for us, but FOR ANY human.&gt;&quot; Mr. Huang said.<br />
__________<br />
<br />
Her mother had been on the brightly lit ground, literally crumpled like a used beer can, moaning in pain. Lin watched in horror as red splotches ate away at the older woman&#39;s body...<br />
<br />
But she could only watch with tears in her eyes. HOW can I help?! she thought in frustration. THIS...is not RIGHT!<br />
<br />
She had sagged next to her mother. At least I&#39;ll be with her in the end, she thought.<br />
<br />
A shadow fell over the two, as a winged angel descended, glittering, from the sky, landing next to her mother. <br />
<br />
She looked up at the familiar gunmetal skinned female, as she stood up. The angel smiled at her, ruby eyes glistening...and then reached out to her with hands that glittered as if they were covered with a fresh snow.<br />
<br />
The gynoid angel brushed her hands over Lin&#39;s face, and Lin felt...strange. She saw her paper-like human skin fluttering away in the gentle breeze that had begun. She watched, curious, as the glittery dark hands brushed over her...brushing away more of her skin, and revealing blue accented, silvery colored polymer skin akin to the angel&#39;s. The smiling angel brushed the skin off Lin&#39;s torso and legs, with the same effect...then was behind her, rubbing her shoulder blades.<br />
<br />
There was an eruption of blue polymer feathers from her back.<br />
<br />
The joy she felt stunned her...and she suddenly knew how to help her mother.<br />
<br />
She knelt and reached out to her mother, wrapping her translucent blue feathers protectively around her and watched as her own glittering, cybernetic hands brushed the redness from her mothers form.<br />
<br />
That form slowly grew stronger, straighter, the new polymer skin that was appearing being the same color as hers.<br />
<br />
With a final delicate touch, she brushed away the flesh on her mother&#39;s face...<br />
<br />
Blue optics and a smiling face looked back at her...and moments later, as her mother got to her feet, she uttered a happy cry, as her mother&#39;s cobalt wings exploded into the world.<br />
<br />
&lt;_Sisters&gt;, Lin thought, &lt;_WE did it...&gt;<br />
<br />
All three digital angels embraced with joy...<br />
...<br />
<br />
The world swirled and reformed into a dark room. <br />
<br />
Lin awoke to her dark room. The digital clock read 10:35.<br />
That dream was...strangely erotic. Lin thought, uncomfortably.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, with the light from the small yellow nightlight near her bed, Lin was...depressed...to see her human flesh back.<br />
<br />
That...was...weirdness squared, Lin thought.<br />
Now that she actually had some sleep in her, her brain felt clearer.<br />
She swung her legs down off the bed and stared at the floor.<br />
<br />
What...was THAT about?<br />
I&#39;m worried about Mother...and would do ANYTHING to heal her, but...<br />
600 changing me? Me changing Mom? <br />
<br />
Do I...REALLY want to become like her?<br />
Though I HAVE to say...She IS still ...normal NOW.<br />
Is she a &#39;machine&#39; if she&#39;s STILL so obviously &#39;Carly&#39;?<br />
She STILL would&#39;ve bitten my head off about my caffeine buzz if she WAS still Carly.<br />
<br />
Lin frowned. She was RIGHT, though...I CAN&#39;T keep this up, can&#39;t stay awake studying indefinitely. The human body wasn&#39;t meant to LIVE on that much caffeine daily. Sooner, rather than later, something will break.<br />
<br />
I&#39;m getting the medical stuff down, but NOT as fast as I want, and I&#39;m falling further behind trying to DO it...<br />
<br />
Her heart crumpled.<br />
I&#39;ve always wanted to be a Doctor...to help...NOTHING else comes even CLOSE.<br />
I CAN&#39;T...give that dream up. What ELSE would I do?!<br />
<br />
The images and the feelings from the dream stepped back onstage and right in front of her mind&#39;s eye...<br />
<br />
THAT would be the only option. Could...I do it? Would I...Change...so I could achieve my dream?<br />
• 600 seems to have no problem remembering things...I remember 9902 talking about a...&#39;HeadNet&#39; on her &#39;Uplift&#39; interview...if they are Linked together mentally, sharing info...wouldn&#39;t that make it easier to BE a doctor? <br />
• Emotions are there, quick thinking is there (or we would&#39;ve died horribly).<br />
• Pretty sure they have sensors...THAT would be MEGA-useful as a Doctor...so many options...<br />
• I wouldn&#39;t be able to get sick...<br />
<br />
I-if Mother would be UP to it...she would Waken whole again. I would do ANYTHING to see her happy again...physically able...and be able to do what she always dreamed about...<br />
<br />
If I&#39;m STILL ME in the end, Lin thought, and Mother is still HER, does the body we wear TRULY matter?<br />
<br />
She quieted, and heard voices in the other room. <br />
<br />
Her parents...and...600?<br />
<br />
She got up out of bed and went to listen...<br />
__________<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;How would anyone find work that way? Like you? Why...?&gt;&quot; Mr. Huang started before he was interrupted.<br />
<br />
600 raised a finger &quot;&lt;THINK about it. Mr. Huang. Think logically here. Hypothetically, let&#39;s imagine for a minute that you  decided to be Uplifted. You are now a hot-lookin&#39;, svelte Engineer like me, red optics and all. Both of us Engineers would have literally &#39;built-in&#39; advantages.  WE would no longer NEED calculators, computers, pens/pencils, triangles and such to run simulations and calculations on how your towers would handle weather...you could do it ALL. UP. HERE.&gt;&quot; 600 tapped her temple. &quot;&lt;You&#39;d KNOW what worked and what wouldn&#39;t. Want to WOW people? Collaborate with the Creatives in the Artisan Caste for the best fusion of Engineering and Styling expertise.&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;Like Styling and Engineering divisions in the Car companies?&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
600 nodded. <br />
<br />
THAT...would be interesting...Mr. Huang thought. Both eyebrows disappeared into his bangs again.<br />
600 could all but see wheels turning.<br />
<br />
600 continued, &quot;&lt;Also, you need to find out why your car&#39;s &#39;check engine&#39; light is on? You could read the onboard computer on the spot with a touch...&gt;&quot; She giggled. &quot;&lt;Hell, with a little studying, you could moonlight as a local mechanic.&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;Did you ever have problems with computers? Inscrutable little machines, aren&#39;t they? They just STOP working and you don&#39;t know WHY? WE can interface and &#39;talk&#39; to the OS, find what&#39;s wrong, and get it running...either by TOUCH or just by mental interface...&gt; <br />
<br />
Mr. Huang raised a brow and looked thoughtful. &quot;&lt;Hmm. Keep going, 600. That would be a good way to get &#39;revenge&#39; on the stubborn device...&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
She then looked over at Mrs. Huang. &quot;&lt;ANYhoo...Your LifeGift...your PASSION...is LOVING and Healing others. I saw that years ago when you fussed over me as much as you did Lin...&#39;You&#39;re TOO skinny...you aren&#39;t eating enough. Wait here! I have dumplings almost ready&#39;...REMEMBER?&gt;&quot; <br />
<br />
Mrs. Huang&#39;s face brightened, she nodded and she giggled briefly. <br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;You have a bedside manner that both YOUR people and MINE would benefit from. IF you made the Leap, you&#39;d be a Medic in the Medical Caste. You could stand by a sick human or a damaged Gynoid Sister and scan their vitals with just your body sensors...be able to diagnose incoming test results in your head. You would be able to go blow through pre-Med and Medical school in record time, memorizing procedures and reasoning with our crystalline photographic memory.You would have access to our Medical database, containing humanoid knowledge of over 1 million planets from across the Universe. You would ALSO be able to get suggestions and advice from not only your fellow HUMAN physicians, but, through our HeadLink, help and wisdom from our wiser, elder Medical Caste members brought in from across the Universe...<br />
<br />
Again, in BOTH cases...All this IN your head. IN nanoseconds.<br />
<br />
Would THAT be worth something in either field?&gt;&quot; <br />
<br />
Both just nodded mutely, stunned.<br />
<br />
600 paused, and raised a red holo-brow as she looked from one to another. &quot;&lt;And, before I miss mentioning it...you MIGHT notice that I&#39;ve mastered both your language and dialect of Chinese, when I struggled with just a FEW of your words as Carly two days ago? Both of you would be able to speak every known language...FLUENTLY.&gt; <br />
<br />
The Huangs looked each other as that point hit. Eyebrows went up. She HAD been speaking flawlessly.<br />
<br />
600 looked from one to the other. &quot;&lt;From an economic standpoint, what earth company would be so FOOLISH to NOT take advantage of all THAT? Would you WANT to give up THAT advantage in the job market? Mr.Huang, humans would have to compete against YOU (NOT easy to do) and all that you could offer employers. You would have a SIZEABLE edge and advantage.&gt;<br />
<br />
600 looked in the direction of the bedrooms, then looked at Mrs. Huang. &quot;&lt;I&#39;ve always noticed that STRONG bond you and Lin have ALWAYS had...Lin often jokes that she&#39;s your clone.&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
The older lady chuckled and nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;You BOTH have the same LifeGift...the SAME passion: To LOVE and HEAL others. You are bonded so strongly and communicate so WELL with each other you are more like Sisters than mother and daughter.&gt;&quot; <br />
<br />
Mrs. Huang nodded and smiled. <br />
<br />
600 finished up, &quot;&lt;Could you envision...BOTH you and Lin, with the LOVE you have for each other...as Doctors in the Medical Caste, working together as a team to heal someone...or bring a new life into the world?&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Huang was silent, but there was a powerful longing kindling in her eyes.<br />
<br />
600 paused. &quot;&lt;I was there when Lois Hamilton had the idea of going and getting Converted on the air, so she would see what was like and, hopefully, save all our jobs. I asked her if she was sure...as you &#39;can&#39;t undo a bad case of gynoid.&#39; She WASN&#39;T sure...but she BRAVELY took the chance...and took that leap...<br />
<br />
Before ANYONE else...<br />
<br />
Lois Hamilton took the &#39;leap&#39;...and she landed as &#39;Diplomat_9902&#39;. While the rest of us were scared that when she emerged from the tank that she&#39;d be JUST a &#39;machine&#39;, she PROVED us WRONG. Her BODY WAS mechanical now...But her SOUL didn&#39;t change.&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
SHE is WHY I took the chance today...and I&#39;m NOW as proud to be a gynoid as SHE was when she Became that day. I KNOW it&#39;s scary because you think that &#39;This isn&#39;t REAL, she&#39;s just programs. The Change would KILL me, kill who I am, kill what I LOVE...<br />
NO.&gt;&quot;<br />
______<br />
Both of the Huangs were quiet. 600 paused, letting it all sink in a bit more. She gave Mrs. Huang&#39;s hands a gentle squeeze, released them and then took the chance to get up and look around the room, staring for the first time at the beautiful landscapes in watercolors, Tacked to the walls...most done in an expressive oriental style, signed &#39;Shen Huang&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;He IS good, isn&#39;t he?&gt;&quot; Mrs. Huang said, proudly. &quot;&lt;It&#39;s genetic, we think. Both sides of the family have had artists going WAY back...Shen started back at 3 and hasn&#39;t stopped drawing and painting SINCE...&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;He can get LOST in his artwork for HOURS...most times we have to remind him to eat. At the rate he&#39;s GOING, though, we&#39;re going to NEED an Engineer like you to help shore up his room so it won&#39;t collapse under all the art...&gt;&quot; Mr. Huang said with a proud chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;Why hasn&#39;t he had a show?&gt;&quot; 600 asked, astounded and mesmerized by the artwork.  She studied them more closely. &quot;&lt;THESE should be matted...or...protected...or SOMETHING!&gt;&quot;<br />
She set her optics on &#39;stream&#39; and opened her HeadNet pathways to show the art to her Sisters.<br />
<br />
*pipp*<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 9902 To: 518600/Eng: Another Gifted one! An Artist! Beautiful!&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 9901 To: 518600/Eng: It IS. Humans seem to specialize in art and music. QUITE good at it, too.&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 9902 To: 518600/Eng: Any chance we could get him? This is...Shen, right? More Artisans are always welcome.&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 518600/Eng To: 9902: Yes, it&#39;s Shen. Not sure yet. :( Mother SEEMS to see the potential of Rebirth, same for father, but he&#39;s still unsure. Haven&#39;t seen Shen yet. He might be sleeping or out.&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 9901 To: 518600/Eng: Just...PLEASE be gentle, 600, they scare easily.&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 518600/Eng: To: 9901: BELIEVE me, scaring them is the LAST thought on my mind.  WANT to see their Joy when Reborn!&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 9902 To: 518600/Eng: Do your BEST, Sister...and leave the rest to the Big Guy Upstairs.&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 518600/Eng: To: 9902: Will do. Thanks. :) *Crosses fingers and toes* :D  &gt;<br />
*pipp*<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;He&#39;s never satisfied, 600. He doesn&#39;t think they&#39;re good enough to show. We&#39;ve tried telling him that he&#39;s wrong, but he just laughs it off...&gt;&quot; Mr. Huang&#39;s face fell. &quot;&lt;He is so gifted, that it&#39;s a pity.&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;Yes. He&#39;s working his rear off in the Home Store, trying to help US, when he could do SO much better.&gt;&quot; Mrs. Huang said with a frown.<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;With THESE, you would be able to get a small nest egg, I&#39;d think.&gt;&quot; 600 murmured thoughtfully. <br />
_____<br />
<br />
&quot;600?&quot; came a sleepy-sounding voice from the hallway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lin?!&quot; 600&#39;s head whipped around, and she walked over to her friend. &quot;What are you doing UP, kiddo? Get back to BED! Get the sleep you need!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, Why are you up? It&#39;s ONLY been about two hours!&quot; Mrs. Huang said, concerned.<br />
 <br />
 &quot;I&#39;m okay for the minute...what with my &#39;beauty sleep&#39; in the car...&quot; She looked back at her friend and continued. &quot;What if...I took the chance, 600? How hard would pre-med and Medical school be for one of YOU guys?&quot; <br />
<br />
600 tipped her head a bit. &quot;For US? The Medical Caste? Memorizing and learning the techniques with a photographic crystalline memory...MUCH easier and quicker than...umm... what you&#39;re enduring now...&quot; She reached out to Lin, and rested her hands on the young woman&#39;s shoulders. She would be holding her breath if she still had to breathe. &quot;WHY...are you asking, Lin? Are you thinking...about...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One of my dreams tonight gave me the solution...for TWO problems...if WE&#39;RE brave.&quot; She looked at her parents.  &quot;Mother, Father, If I were to decide to become like 600...w-would you still consider me...family?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jia Huang looked at her oldest daughter, thought for a moment and then nodded.<br />
&quot;If you come out as...whole...as 600, yes.&quot; She looked over at her husband, who also nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two...Mother...I heard what you were talking about earlier. My second question: W-would you JOIN me if I did this?&quot; She saw the worry and confusion cross her mother&#39;s face. She walked over in front of her, knelt down and laid her hands on her mother&#39;s inflamed hands. &quot;You...are the BEST friend I&#39;ve had. (Sorry, 600...) I...can&#39;t...handle seeing you like this any more. I wouldn&#39;t feel RIGHT going for my dreams If you STILL can&#39;t have yours.&quot; She brushed her ebony hair back as she started to tear up.<br />
&quot;If I&#39;m going to be a Gynoid Doctor...and all that entails...I&#39;d want us to be a team in this...to see what we can do, Mother and Daughter...Sister and Sister...TOGETHER.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jia hesitated. &quot;I think...I COULD...with what 600 has been patiently explaining to us...but I...I...your father a-and Shen..I&#39;m...not sure if they would be willing to live in a house with...two gynoids...&quot; She stopped, as Quan laid his hand on her shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;As a gynoid, will you still be &#39;Jia&#39;...the person I&#39;ve loved since college?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I don&#39;t...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YES.&quot; 600 said fiercely. &quot;Our personalities don&#39;t really change all that much...our BODIES do. If she loves you NOW, she will THEN.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jia was tugged in two directions mentally. The longing for the life of a physician, in WHATEVER her body looked like, was practically overpowering her but she was obviously scared that something could go horribly wrong when she got out of the tank. <br />
<br />
She was stunned when 600 knelt before her, laid her hands over both hers and Lin&#39;s, and when she spoke, there was an emotional tone and intensity in the gynoid&#39;s voice the mother hadn&#39;t expected.<br />
 &quot;I&#39;ve been over here so many times over the years since High School, I&#39;ve considered you two my second mother and father. I will SWEAR this: Whatever horrors your mind is torturing you with about this, push it ASIDE. You will NOT be harmed. You will STAY you. I would NOT condone this if I&#39;d lose ANY of you that way. Would THAT make ANY sense?&quot; <br />
<br />
The three of them looked at her and shook their heads.<br />
<br />
600&#39;s optics locked onto Jia&#39;s eyes, but her voice softened. &quot;EVERY bit of YOU that attracted your husband will STILL be with you...in full measure. He may be unsettled by your new body for some time...but, if he gives the gynoid you the chance, he will see YOU.&quot; She looked over at Quan, with a questioning look on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;If...you remember to accept me as I am, then, Jia, I would accept you as well...&quot; He put his hand on the side of her face and he kissed her lovingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;How could I NOT accept you, Quan?&quot; She nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;So...you BOTH are sure?&quot; 600 said.<br />
<br />
Lin and her mother nodded nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on...&quot; 600 looked up.<br />
*pipp*<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 518600/Eng To: 9901: Is the Conversion chamber ready? &gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 9902 To: 518600/Eng: You have someone willing?&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 518600/Eng To: 9902: Two someones. Jia Huang and her daughter Lin Huang. For Medical Caste. Together.&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 9901 and 9902 To: 518600/Eng: *HAPPY!* When?&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 518600/Eng: To: 9901: Hold on... &gt;<br />
*pipp*<br />
<br />
&quot;When do you want to do this?&quot; 600 looked at them.<br />
<br />
Mother and daughter looked at each other.<br />
&quot;Tomorrow afternoon, Lin?...Maybe 2pm?&quot;<br />
&quot;I can do that, Mother.&quot;<br />
&quot;Quan?&quot;<br />
&quot;Fine. It&#39;ll be interesting to see that place in person.&quot;<br />
<br />
*pipp*<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 518600/Eng To: 9901: Tomorrow afternoon? 2 PM EST? &gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 9902 To: 518600/Eng: Will do. Maybe YOU should&#39;ve been the Diplomat! You smooth talker, you! ;)&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 518600/Eng To: 9902: O///O :) &gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 9902 To: 518600/Eng: You&#39;re gonna have to get going on ANOTHER &#39;beanbag&#39;! We&#39;ll wear out this one at this rate! ;P &gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 9901 To: 518600/Eng: What of Quan & Shen?&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 518600/Eng To: 9901: Quan...needs more time and work, but think he will join. He sees the benefits. He MIGHT opt at the office tomorrow...MAYBE. Shen? Haven&#39;t seen him yet. Dunno about HIM. HOPEFULLY...&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 9901 To: 518600/Eng: VeryVERY Nice, Sister. We ALL thank you. And THEM for their courage, as well.&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 518600/Eng To: 9901: We WILL need help for Jia. Her body NOT in good shape. Will need to be VERY gentle.&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 9902 To: 518600/Eng: I can bring my Camry. Between you, me and Quan, should be relatively pain-free for her.&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 518600/Eng To: 9902: Sounds like a plan...One last thought...Could we talk to the Great Family? Have our Sisters WAIT on the &#39;Hello Party&#39; until BOTH Lin and Jia have joined? I think...they would TREASURE that joint memory...&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 9901 To: 518600/Eng:  Will do. :) VERY nice idea, 600. You look to become an exceptionally gifted Engineer...&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 518600/Eng To: 9901: O///O Thanks!!  :D &gt; <br />
*pipp*<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, it&#39;s on for tomorrow,  Sunday afternoon, 2 pm.&quot;<br />
<br />
*Yawn* Whatttzz on for tomorrow?&quot; Rubbing his tousled brown hair, Shen emerged from his &#39;cave&#39; at the end of the hallway. He was a wiry but toned young man, 16 years old. He blinked blearily a few times, and then noticed 600. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s THAT?&quot; he mumbled as he pointed at 600.<br />
<br />
Before Lin could say anything, 600 stood up and said, &quot;I&#39;m 600, small fry. You knew me a few days ago as one &#39;Carly Anderson&#39;. Nice to meet you...again!&quot;<br />
<br />
The sleep was leaving his mind, and the artist in him studied her face, Certainly LOOKS like Carly, he thought...&quot;Hmm...if ANYONE here would go gynoid, I WAS figuring on you or Sis...&quot; Shen said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good call, Brother, I&#39;m next, and so is Mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shen looked stunned for a moment, then nonplussed a second later. &quot;So, we&#39;ll be almost a full house of gynoids?&quot;<br />
<br />
His father shrugged. &quot;It&#39;ll be you and me representing us poor ol&#39; humans. I want...a bit more proof before I take such a mighty jump, I don&#39;t know about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shen shrugged. &quot;Dunno...&quot;<br />
He shuffled off into the kitchen for a snack.<br />
___<br />
<br />
Sunday, 1pm.<br />
<br />
The silver midsize pulled up to the curb, and a minute later, there was a knock on the door.<br />
<br />
Lin nervously opened the front door to meet the area&#39;s most famous (and ONLY) gynoid reporter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Lin. Nice to see you again. Congratulations to BOTH of you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...yeah...Thanks, 9902, Come on in...we&#39;re just trying to calm down  b-before...&quot; <br />
Lin just clammed up as she led the silverish gynoid to the couch, where 600 and Mr. Huang were waiting with Mrs. Huang. <br />
Shen was leaning against the wall, sketchpad in hand,  sketching smoothly with a #2 pencil, apparently sketching the scene.<br />
<br />
Jia slowly got to her feet, with Quan&#39;s help...with Lin hovering around her like an overanxious hummingbird, until her mother shooed her away.<br />
&quot;Lin, stop it...I&#39;m fine.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you doing okay, Mrs. Huang? You sleep alright last night?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was a bit too nervous to sleep much, Ms. 9902, and besides, with the storm last night, I was hurting too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you be able to get down the front steps?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I WILL, but it won&#39;t be quick...&quot;<br />
____<br />
<br />
9902 watched as Jia slowly went down the steps sideways. The Diplomat could see the pain on her face, but also determination.<br />
Physically, she had hope for the first time in a long while and was determined to see it through.<br />
<br />
It took a good few minutes of careful maneuvering, but Jia wound up safely in the sedan&#39;s front passenger seat.<br />
She was thankful that the seat was fairly firm, as she didn&#39;t want to have to struggle to get OUT of it.<br />
<br />
9902 got in the driver&#39;s seat, and most of her family filed in behind her.<br />
She checked in the rearview mirror as 600 got in the driver&#39;s side of Carly&#39;s white hatchback, as Shen got in the passenger side.<br />
<br />
With a growl, the inline 6 came to life, and they moved out into traffic...<br />
_____<br />
<br />
There are benefits to having a gynoid driving, especially when they have internal GPS. Instead of being stuck in traffic for an hour, 02 and 600 managed to shave 30 minutes off the trip, taking a maze of various roads that magically ended at the &#39;Gynoid HQ&#39; Office building.<br />
<br />
Ten minutes later, they were walking into the reconditioned building...they were met in the foyer by 9901.<br />
&quot;Welcome, Sisters...&quot; she said, looking at 600 and 9902, &quot;and welcome to our soon-to-be Sisters.&quot; She said, looking at Jia and Lin...and the men behind them.<br />
<br />
&quot;The &#39;Beanbag&#39; should be ready whenever you are, Lin, Jia.&quot; 600 said. &quot;I gave it a tune-up and once over this morning. It&#39;s running like a dragster.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;THAT&#39;S comforting.&quot; Lin remarked drily. &quot;I&#39;ll be Converted with flames coming over my shoulders, then?&quot; <br />
<br />
600 stuck her gray tongue out at her friend.<br />
<br />
Jia was looking at the double office alcove, and the device, with a look of fear on her face. She felt two people appear, one on each side, offering an arm for support. On her right was Quan...on her left, Lin.<br />
<br />
&quot;You READY, my Love?&quot; Quan said. <br />
<br />
She nodded with determination, leaned on each of their arms, and began the slow walk to the &#39;beanbag&#39;...and the ramp leading up to it...<br />
<br />
She settled into the warm, silver-colored liquid, staring in surprise as the device adjusted in size and cradled her effortlessly, like a womb.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready, Mother?&quot;<br />
<br />
She swallowed and nodded.<br />
<br />
The machine began to hum, and she startled as supports solidified underneath her.<br />
<br />
Quan reached out and touched her cheek gently, then gave her a thumbs up.<br />
<br />
She chuckled as the vibration started...<br />
It started as a tingling on her extremities, and shortly escalated to every cell getting a gentle rubdown.<br />
Her tension began to abate, and she relaxed more and more. The throbbing in her hips and fingers began to fade...<br />
<br />
Quan sat on the nearby couch with a worried look on his face.<br />
Not so much for Jia...He was pretty certain that 600 was on the level.<br />
Assuming this worked...where would they go from here?<br />
<br />
How much would a GYNOID care for a HUMAN?<br />
<br />
&quot;Father, it&#39;ll be FINE.&quot; Lin said, plopping down on his left.<br />
<br />
&quot;HOPE so...I&#39;ve loved her for so many years...I&#39;ve WISHED for something to heal her physically. I&#39;ve wanted...wished...PRAYED...that BOTH of you would get the chance to become Doctors.&quot; Quan rubbed his open hands up and down his face in nervousness before continuing, &quot;She was SO happy when she found out she was pregnant with you, and, then, Shen...She was SO happy to be your mother, but I could still see that...restlessness...underneath.&quot; He looked at Lin, and noticed that 600 was sitting quietly on the arm of the couch, listening. Shen was leaning against the wall, but looking at Quan, not the sketchpad. &quot;She was LONGING to get to work, to study, to become a doctor. She had started her pre-med studies when Shen was older, but then she started noticing the pains in her fingers...and then her hips and her knees...&quot;<br />
<br />
He wiped the tears in his eyes away as he said,<br />
&quot;There is...NOTHING...worse than watching a loved ones&#39; dreams DIE...There is NO finer torture known then to see a part of that person that you would DIE for lose hope and...&#39;crumble&#39; before your eyes...And NOT to be able to do a DAMNED thing to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;THAT&#39;S why I was trying so hard to find work...and was SO frustrated that nothing came up. Jia eventually seemed to make peace with her situation...but I...WE...wanted YOU to have the money for your medical education. For you to be able to become the Physician you longed to be. Even if SHE couldn&#39;t.&quot; He looked at Shen. &quot;THAT&#39;S why we wanted you to go to art school...and to BELIEVE in your skills.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;Shen, you&#39;ve never really believed in your skills, even though they spoke for themselves.&gt;&quot; <br />
<br />
Quan looked over in the direction of the &#39;Beanbag&#39;...and the source of the gently reproving electronic voice. It spoke in perfect Chinese. &quot;&lt;Jia?&gt;&quot; He whispered, as the new gynoid stared at him.<br />
<br />
She twitched slightly, and then finished walking down the ramp from the &#39;beanbag&#39;. <br />
&quot;&lt;Yes...but please call me &#39;799&#39;, Quan, my Love. I&#39;d MUCH prefer THAT.&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
Her new, silver polymer skin glistened under the overhead lights, and her accents, lights, nails and optics were all a rich Medical blue. She watched, as, stunned, he slowly got up. <br />
<br />
He stood there wordlessly, and then his shaking hands reached out to trace the optimized, smoothed contours of her face. <br />
Almost as if he was dreaming, and was afraid he&#39;d wake. &quot;&lt;You...okay, 799?&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded...reached out slowly....and hugged him.<br />
<br />
The power of HIS reciprocal hug...and his tears...started HER crying.<br />
<br />
Neon green tears rolled down her cheeks, as clear ones rolled down his.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am...HERE, my love...ALL of me.&quot; She whispered into his ear in English. &quot;ALL of my love for you is still within me...600 spoke the truth. My Sister was right.&quot; She rubbed his back and then released him, turning to look at Lin, with a big grin on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready, my Sister?&quot; she said as she wiped the green cleaner/lubricant from her cheeks.<br />
Lin swallowed, nodded and got up from the couch.<br />
The new Medic extended out both her hands to her daughter as Lin got up. They hugged.<br />
<br />
Lin took a deep breath as she turned toward the &#39;Beanbag&#39;. 799 noted the fear and the determination in her daughter&#39;s face. &quot;You&#39;ll LOVE it.&quot; She whispered with a wink, &quot;I THINK they slowed it down, so you&#39;ll REALLY be able to savor it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lin took one final look at those glistening blue optics, and then strode up the ramp...<br />
<br />
When she turned back, Quan was not in the room.<br />
<br />
*pipp*<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 520799/Mdc To: 518600/Eng: Where did he...?&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 518600/Eng To: 520799/Mdc: Walked out. He&#39;s a...bit...SPOOKED...Probably BEST to talk to him...&gt;<br />
*pipp*<br />
<br />
799 blew out the door, a worried look on her face.<br />
_____<br />
<br />
799 looked around the first floor and eventually found him in a unused, open office, sitting on the floor, staring into space. He looked over as she walked in and sat down on his left, quietly looking at him. &quot;Do you...want to talk, Quan?&quot;<br />
<br />
He nodded. &quot;One condition: do a &#39;CLOSEOUT&#39;, if they told you how. I want this for OUR ears only. NO input from the &#39;Sisters&#39;. JUST you...and YOU only...&quot;<br />
<br />
799 nodded and activated CLOSEOUT, which deactivated her internal coms, then reached out to swing the office door SHUT...<br />
_____<br />
<br />
Shen dropped to the couch, watching nervously as his older sister twitched happily as silver waves slowly washed her humanity away. I KNOW this is what she wants, but this is SO...damned...FREAKY. <br />
<br />
He grunted and looked down at the sketchpad. SHE&#39;S not the only one... he thought, running his hands through his disheveled brown hair. So...WHY is it so fascinating?!  WHY did I bring THIS one?  <br />
He started flipping pages, looking at the dated sketches.<br />
<br />
Nine months ago, when 9901 first landed and made her home on that property, she was ALL over the news. For a &#39;robot&#39;...something inorganic...he found her...sexy...for some reason...beautiful...Despite the nature scenes he was good at, SHE captured his interest...and he STILL didn&#39;t know WHY.<br />
<br />
He promptly got to work sketching her in various poses, both real...and some imagined...<br />
<br />
Then 9901, and the device...gave &#39;birth&#39; to the Diplomat_9902.<br />
He was sketching HER in the week after, as she covered various events for Channel 8.<br />
<br />
Last night, he tried getting 600 down from memory before falling back into a sporadic sleep.<br />
<br />
He was just TOO stunned to TRY to sketch his...Mother today. (Besides, THAT would&#39;ve broken the &#39;Freaky&#39; dial.)<br />
<br />
He startled as a familiar, electronically-tinged voice over his shoulder said, &quot;Damned NICE renditions of us. Solid anatomy and perspective, too!&quot; He clamped the book shut, with his face turning scarlet, looking up at the gently smirking Engineer, who was leaning over at the waist with her hands clasped behind her back...and looking at the sketchbook with great interest.<br />
<br />
&quot;You got the hots for 9901 and 9902...and it looked like a few of ME in there...Color me flattered!&quot; 600 felt her side cheek marks glow a brighter red at the flattery.<br />
<br />
She plopped down next to him. &quot;So, you like what you see with us?&quot;<br />
600 watched as his pupils constricted and his heartrate went up.<br />
She ALSO saw the &#39;tent&#39; forming in his pants...before he grabbed the sketchbook in a panic and embarrassment...and he bolted for the door, nearly running into his parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the...?! Shen?!&quot;&quot; Quan barked, as his son dodged sideways and disappeared.<br />
<br />
799 raised her blue brow, as her body sensors read her son&#39;s flustered biology. &lt;_WHY is he...?&gt; she thought. When she got to one particular set of readings, her optics widened, and she smiled a bit. &lt;_Oh. THAT might explain a LOT... make things a bit easier.&gt;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why&#39;s...Shen running?&quot; The new Medic said, as she pushed herself free of the &#39;Beanbag&#39; with a bit of reluctance, her blue optics adjusting to the light.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sisters...&quot; 9901 said, as she stepped, ghostlike, around Quan & 799.<br />
&quot;Welcome to the Fold.. Thank you SO much for Joining Us...&quot;<br />
<br />
799 gently squeezed Quan&#39;s hand, moved next to her new Sister, and reached out her hand.<br />
<br />
They both held hands as 9901 continued, &quot;You are, as you BOTH wished to be, members of the Medical Caste. May your passion and skills help this world.&quot; <br />
<br />
She walked up to 799.<br />
&quot;Sister. You are &#39;260316-423-520799/Mdc&#39;, to be precise...&#39;520799&#39; or &#39;799&#39; for short.&quot; <br />
She then turned to the newest gynoid.<br />
&quot;Sister. YOU are &#39;260316-423-520800/Mdc&#39;, to be precise...&#39;520800&#39; or &#39;800&#39; for short.&quot;<br />
<br />
Quan watched, deep in thought, as the three embraced, the talk he had for 20 minutes with 799 on his mind...<br />
<br />
*pipp*<br />
&lt;I.M. From: SISTERS[var] To: 9901/Ems: All ready? &gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 9901/Ems To:SISTERS[var] : Yes. :) &gt;<br />
<br />
Quan watched as his wife...and daughter...froze. Their optics widened in unison and their hands tightened together. Neon green tears poured from their eyes, and their shiny black lips started moving silently as they trembled with excitement. &quot;What..is...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a...welcoming party, basically.&quot; 9902 said as she walked up with a big grin on her face. &quot;They&#39;re meeting new friends from across the Universe that are in the Medical Caste.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It happen to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, on a more general level with me, since I&#39;m a Diplomat. It&#39;s still about 260 Trillion people saying &#39;Hello&#39; and &#39;Good Luck&#39;. It&#39;s further proof that we&#39;re ALL wanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
He remained thoughtfully silent.<br />
______<br />
<br />
The two Medic Sisters came out of their fugue in an excited state, and were both hugging Quan in short order.<br />
Until 800 noted the absence of someone....<br />
<br />
*pipp*<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 520800/Mdc To: 518600/Eng : Where&#39;s my Brother?&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 518600/Eng To: 520800/Mdc : Uhm...Freaked out? Bolted. Needed time by himself.&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 520800/Mdc To: 9901/Ems : I&#39;m gonna look for him.&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 518600/Eng To: 520800/Mdc : Need my help?&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 520800/Mdc To: 518600/Eng : We&#39;ll spook him if together, Sis. Too overwhelming. I think he&#39;ll talk to me. PROBABLY easier. &gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 518600/Eng To: 520800/Mdc : He was MORE than freaked out...seemed...&#39;Excited&#39; toward me...[image] &gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 520800/Mdc To: 518600/Eng : (open) Oh. Dear. God!!!  0////0  *eyebleach*&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 520799/Mdc To: 520800/Mdc : Use CLOSEOUT when you talk to him, please, 800. He might talk more...not worry EVERYONE is listening.&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 520800/Mdc To: 520799/Mdc : GOTcha. .&gt;<br />
*pipp*<br />
_____<br />
<br />
Shen had found the open office in the back of the building, and had dropped to the floor against the wall, watching the dust dance in the sunlight streaming into the room for about 20 minutes. The Blush and the &#39;Tent&#39; had long faded, but their memory left him even MORE uncomfortable. <br />
<br />
What the HELL is WRONG with me? I SAW what happened to Mom! With Sis! WHY did I react to Carly...600... like that? Shen drew his knees against his chest and brought his head down. He COULDN&#39;T go back there...600 would probably ridicule the HELL out of him...with what she saw.<br />
<br />
And WHAT would he say or do if he saw his...Mother...or his...Sister (She&#39;s GOT to be finished now, anyway.)? What if he reacted THAT way with THEM? Oh, God! EEwwww!!<br />
<br />
Let&#39;s FACE it, I NEVER shoulda come. They&#39;ll think I&#39;m a freaky human and not want me around...and I STILL don&#39;t know WHY I reacted...<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...knockknock!&quot;<br />
Shen looked up to the Blue-eyed Medic at the door. W-Which one IS...he thought in panic. PLLLEEEASE don&#39;t let it be Mom, or I&#39;ll never... His mind registered the smoothened, familiar lines of his Sister&#39;s face, and his panic subsided. A bit.<br />
<br />
His older sister dropped into an &#39;indian sitting&#39; pose next to him. She looked at the sunlight streaming through the window. &quot;This side of the building gets good light, Brother.&quot; she noted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;9901 is thinking about getting plants to see if it looks better...Maybe doing landscaping. That&#39;ll boost the property value.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds cool...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanna talk about it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not sure what to say, Sis...It...It&#39;s NOTHING, anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t BE in here hiding if it was NOTHING, Brother. C&#39;mon...spill!&quot;<br />
<br />
Shen sighed and lifted his head, looking over into the concerned, glowing blue optics.<br />
<br />
He handed her the sketchpad and shrugged. <br />
Might as well get it OVER with. I can&#39;t hide. If she HATES me, she HATES me...<br />
<br />
&quot;You know how much I LOVE unwinding doing those nature watercolors...and doing the comic book poses, too...&quot;<br />
<br />
800 nodded, as she opened the sketchpad.<br />
<br />
&quot;About 9 months ago, I got interested in sketching something ELSE...and I didn&#39;t let anyone know...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Until 600 saw it earlier?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shen winced. &quot;You...saw that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope. I was still blissing out. She sent me an I.M. later...&quot;<br />
<br />
Shen&#39;s face drained of blood, and 800 worried that he was going to have a panic attack...<br />
but he sagged and relaxed, defeated. &quot;Didn&#39;t know...you guys...can talk like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...kinda comes with the Package, Brother...&quot; She turned the pages, and Shen saw her eyes widen in recognition at the forms on the pages...both bodies and head sketches. Her face lit up. &quot;Oh, wow! You LIKE us! 9902 looks so pretty and detailed!&quot; 800 looked over and noticed that Shen looked even MORE panicked. <br />
<br />
&quot;What...Brother...?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re...watching us right NOW?!&quot; He managed to eke out in a small voice.<br />
<br />
She reached out and placed a gentle hand on his knee. &quot;NOPE. I&#39;m in CLOSEOUT...on my &#39;Private&#39; setting. It&#39;s JUST us two. Don&#39;t worry.&quot;  She trailed off.<br />
<br />
He relaxed slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let it out, Brother...what&#39;s eating you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fascinated with you guys...my Muse...WON&#39;T let go...and I don&#39;t know why...&quot;<br />
<br />
She flipped through the pages, and, near the back, found a head sketch. It was roughly and sloppily sketched, as if it was done when the artist was half-asleep. It had a striking resemblance to her younger brother...but it was a gynoid.<br />
<br />
&lt;_You as one of Us, Brother?&gt; She thought. &lt;_Do you even remember this is IN here?&gt;<br />
&lt;_If you DID, I probably wouldn&#39;t be looking at this now...&gt; <br />
<br />
800 looked up as he sadly stared out the window, she flipped a few pages back just in case.<br />
&quot;Is it...maybe...that YOU are Curious? Do you WANT to join Us?&quot;<br />
<br />
He snorted, and pulled himself to his feet. Seconds later, he was at the window, staring out.<br />
&quot;I...don&#39;t know. Don&#39;t know if I WOULD if I could. Would be TOO weird being a...girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What ELSE?&quot; She prodded. &quot;I know you TOO well. Spill.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...can&#39;t LIVE without art, Sis...No art, no WAY. Even if...I wanted to join you guys, from what little I know, you go into your fields of Passion.&quot; <br />
<br />
She could hear grief and a trace of panic creep into in his voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not...a Physician type...like you or Mom...I&#39;m not the Engineering type like 600 or Dad would be. I&#39;m NOT a fighter or...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re an ARTIST. Your point?&quot;<br />
She put the pad aside, got up and went over next to her younger brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m the odd man out. You&#39;re...robots...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; &#39;Gynoids&#39;, please, Brother.&quot; 800 corrected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine...&#39;You&#39;re gynoids. You don&#39;t NEED me. Art isn&#39;t...necessary...for your society.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhm, Brother...WRONG. We DO have an Artisan Caste...you&#39;ve got all the creatives there...&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked over into the blue optics and the serious face. &quot;You&#39;re...serious?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As a heart attack. HOW could we claim to be an Advanced species with NO Creatives? What would shake things UP? Make us THINK? Try new ideas? Hell, What would make us HAVE new ideas?! We&#39;d stagnate without them.&quot; 800 raised a blue holo-brow. She grinned as her voice took on a startlingly more robotic tone, complete with echo. &quot; &#39;YOU-WILL-BE-ASSIMILATED-HUMAN.&#39; &quot; 800 giggled, and spoke again, her voice back to normal. &quot;We&#39;re not like that for a REASON. Species assimilation would only go so far. It&#39;s effective in expanding numbers in the short term, but it&#39;s not sustainable.&quot; <br />
<br />
800 could have blown on him and knocked him over. Her sensors read him as &#39;normal&#39;, but he looked like he was in shock.<br />
<br />
He cleared his throat and spoke again. &quot;You&#39;re SERIOUS?! I&#39;d...be able to do my art? I-I mean IF I joined you guys...You&#39;re not kidding me, sis?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NEVER been more serious, Brother. It&#39;s a smaller Caste than MOST of the others...at the MOMENT at least, but we&#39;ve learned we have to have access to more than logic for us to grow...not JUST in number of Sisters, but as a species, in WISDOM. So, we NEED Artists, We NEED sculptors, We NEED songwriters/musicians. Music is mathematics, to a degree, and THAT we naturally understand very well...but it is ALSO very much an ART form. Music can speak all over the Universe, and be understood. Art is...more an emotional thing, but it has a voice that can&#39;t be denied. Artisans can ALSO be VERY helpful when they work with the Engineering Caste.&quot; She smiled. &quot; &#39;Two great tastes that taste great together&#39;, eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
She reached up and rested her right hand gently against his left cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are NOT just logical computers, Brother, but we&#39;re INCLINED toward that rigidity...that...logic. The Artisan Caste helps kick us in the...@$$...occasionally, and keeps us flexible and adaptable...especially when we deal with...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Us crazy humans?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup, little Brother... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhm...any chance of me staying MALE?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s called the &#39;SISTERHOOD&#39; for a REASON, Brother...besides...&quot;<br />
800 leaned over and pulled her younger brother into a hug. She held him warmly for a few moments. She sensed him relax a bit more. &quot;Look at me, Brother...&quot; He opened his eyes and looked into hers.<br />
<br />
He could see love and concern in those eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are MORE than this form you wear. So is 799, Father, 600 or ME. You will be YOU in either a human male body, or one of OURS...you will be JUST as beautiful...and JUST as creative...&quot; She grinned. &quot;You won&#39;t miss your...&#39;boys&#39;...Some of my Sisters told me before that THEY were male...THEY had the same fear...But once you...UNDERSTAND...us...&quot; She trailed off. &quot;Humans couple or mate for a few reasons: one is procreation...and the other is an attempt at love and Oneness. We don&#39;t need to procreate, but...Oneness...LOVE...what WE have beats anything humans have been able to feel in this area. You won&#39;t NEED your &#39;boys&#39; to feel Oneness and unconditional Love with Us...you won&#39;t even MISS them.&quot;<br />
<br />
He seemed unconvinced, so she continued,<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides, PRACTICALLY, It&#39;ll make your work at Home Center MUCH easier! Our natural strength, flexibility and durability...our computing/recording capabilities... They&#39;ll make you &#39;Manager&#39; in NO time. You&#39;ll be THAT much of an asset...&quot; She grinned. &quot;A Hot-looking gynoid with nearly the lifting power of a forklift...NOT a bad tradeoff for ALL you get in the deal...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re NOT kidding me, are you...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope.&quot;<br />
<br />
*KnockKnock*<br />
Shen and 800 watched as 799 and 600 entered the room with an odd-looking burgundy metal headband in hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhm...M-Mom?&quot; Shen said as he got to his feet.<br />
<br />
799 handed the band carefully to 800 and hugged Shen. &quot;Yes, Shen...It&#39;s me...&quot; she said softly, as she pulled back. &quot;How do I look?&quot;<br />
He reached out and ran his fingers down the side of the face that looked like a MUCH younger Jia Huang. &quot;Uhm...MUCH...better than before...Good to see you...normal...o-or...you KNOW what I mean! How are you feeling?&quot;<br />
<br />
In response, she put her hands under his arms and lifted him into the air as if he was a baby again. <br />
<br />
Effortlessly. <br />
<br />
As 600 backed up with a grin, 799 danced around the room, lazily spinning, happily singing a familiar tune in Chinese. Shen couldn&#39;t place it for a few seconds until he remembered her singing to him when he was very small. <br />
<br />
She trailed off as the tune ended. When she gently lowered him back to the ground, about two minutes later, he noticed the ear-pod to ear-pod smile on her face...she was all but GLOWING.<br />
<br />
He remembered she used to LOVE dancing like that with him as a child. <br />
<br />
Shen looked at the blue and silver gynoid. She was slightly trembling... NOT from any effort exerted... Her full-grown human son was WELL within her strength levels now...She trembled for her joy at being able to do one of the things she loved again. Her joy was palpable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Honey...I..I just HAD to do it...&quot; 799&#39;s cheek marks burned blue in embarrassment. &quot; I just...saw you...and remembered, years ago...and how you giggled and enjoyed it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shen grinned and brushed his hand over her cheek. &quot;Mom...don&#39;t worry &#39;bout it. I STILL enjoyed the ride...&quot; Shen whispered. &quot;Then AGAIN, it helps that you&#39;re MUCH stronger NOW.&quot;  He looked at her for a moment before finishing, &#39;And it&#39;s good to have you healed...&quot; <br />
<br />
They both clamped each other in a mutual bear hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to run out of TEARS at the rate I&#39;m going today.&quot; 799 murmured, her blue cheek marks burning a bright blue again, as she buried her face in her son&#39;s chest, staining his shirt green. &quot;Sorry, Shen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No prob, Mom...let it out. After all the pain, you DESERVE it, after all...&quot; He kissed the side of her head. &quot;Small price to pay...&quot;<br />
_____<br />
<br />
&quot;So, this does...what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a limited version of our HeadLink...Your DAD gave me the idea.&quot; 600 said. &quot;I kinda came in on the tail-end of what you were talking about...You&#39;re interested?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not...sure.&quot; Shen said. He looked down at the headband, nervously. <br />
He sighed. What the hell...What could it hurt? He thought.<br />
<br />
He looked at his sister, 800, and nodded, closing his eyes.<br />
<br />
She brushed his hair back, put it in place and secured it...<br />
Then she took a deep breath and turned it on...<br />
____<br />
<br />
For a long time nothing seemed to happen, then a pastoral scene strongly materialized in his mind&#39;s eye.<br />
<br />
A tree-lined pathway stretched out before him. He walked forward for about a minute, and then came upon a silver ball with a red handprint floating in the air. The sign over it said, &#39;Artisans&#39;.<br />
<br />
Ooookaaay, Shen thought, I&#39;ll bite...let&#39;s see what happens...as he placed his hands on the ball.<br />
<br />
Nothing seemed to happen.<br />
<br />
Well, THAT was anti-clim...<br />
<br />
&lt;_Hello.&gt;<br />
<br />
He turned around to see a towering creature with silver skin and green optics, a veritable wall of muscle and fangs and green claws...something you&#39;d expect to see in a monster film...but...SHE...was emanating such peace and joy...he was unafraid. &lt;_Hello?&gt; she said again, sounding worried. &lt;_Are you reading me? 518600/Eng said it would work, but...&gt;<br />
<br />
(No, No...I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m just stunned...I-I&#39;m Shen Huang, uh...from Earth, You are...?)<br />
<br />
&lt;_I&#39;m 105500/Art...I&#39;m from the Pleiades... :D &gt;<br />
<br />
(Oh, wow...) <br />
<br />
&lt;_What medium do you work in, Shen?&gt;<br />
<br />
(Uhm...I work in a few earth materials...Ink and paper, watercolor and paper. Tried Paper Mache a few years back...What about YOU?)<br />
<br />
&lt;_I work in coherent light...&gt; Her giant, muscular form gestured, and glistening, glowing sculptures made of different light colors appeared before him. While holding the shapes the light seemed to slowly pulse, bend and flow, changing through the spectrum by the minute.<br />
<br />
(Oh...my...Sweet...God...That&#39;s...MAGICAL!) He felt his jaw not only drop, but go through the ground.<br />
<br />
He was bowled over as he FELT her joy and pride mixed with a touch of concern and frustration.<br />
&lt;_Oooh! Thank you! But it&#39;s been fighting me! I can see it in my head, but it&#39;s NOT coming out...RIGHT.&gt;<br />
<br />
(I know the feeling!...Sometimes, the art takes on a life of it&#39;s OWN...and THAT life is stubborn...)<br />
<br />
The roaring giggle and the blast of joy left him stunned again. It was now that another silver ball appeared before him with the sign &#39;Shen&#39;s Art&#39;. <br />
<br />
Okaaayyy, let&#39;s give it a shot, He thought, placing his hands on the globe.<br />
<br />
He could see all the artwork at home, and could mentally &#39;page&#39; through it, like on an iPad™. He selected a few he was most proud of.<br />
<br />
(105500? This is the kind of art I do at home.)<br />
<br />
&lt;_Media?&gt;<br />
<br />
(Watercolors. Paper. Pictures for reference.)<br />
<br />
&lt;_Oh, WOW! They&#39;re beautiful! :D What&#39;s your technique? Maybe I can use something like that on my lightArt...&gt;<br />
__________<br />
<br />
799, 800, and 600 gently lowered Shen to a seated position, noticing the BIG smile crossing his face that they hadn&#39;t seen in a long time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a HUNCH, Sisters,&quot; 800 said grinning, &quot;but I THINK he&#39;s starting to understand.&quot;<br />
799 remained serious, focused on her sensors, carefully monitoring Shen.<br />
______<br />
<br />
Shen had no sense of time in this zone, but that was, perhaps, a GOOD thing. This was like the BEST dream he EVER had...but KNOWING that these were real gynoids ...real PEOPLE...made it even better.<br />
<br />
After 105500/Art had given him a hug and said she had to get back to the light sculpture she was fighting with, 15001/Art appeared.<br />
<br />
She, physically, looked like a more angular, wolfen version of the Naavi (with a rather LETHAL-looking barbed tail). Again, she had the silverish skin, green optics and accents. Physically intimidating, she stood about 7 feet tall, but she had a feeling of...a wizened elder...and an overwhelming sense of ancient peace emanated from her.<br />
<br />
If her number is any indication, she must be one of the first converted by them, Shen thought in wonder. A...&#39;grandmother&#39; of the Art Caste, maybe?<br />
<br />
She...felt...like his grandmother, who passed when he was 10. He felt..so at peace with her.<br />
<br />
Her art was living art. She was, surprisingly,  a tree sculptor.<br />
Gently, she shifted the healthy trees on her homeworld on a quantum level and bent and shaped them like giant bonsai trees made of clay...<br />
<br />
Like a digital Yoda using the Force.<br />
<br />
How she could DO this, he didn&#39;t know...but, in the end...he stopped trying. He just savored the beauty of her creations.<br />
<br />
She seemed impressed when he showed her his humble art, and said that she hoped he would have more to show in the future. She hugged him before she moved on, and he found his brain was now having a hard time reconciling his definition/image of the word &#39;robot&#39; with what were, obviously, living, thinking, feeling inorganic beings.<br />
<br />
Not long before, he had doubts that 800, 799, and 600 were...REAL anymore, but NOW, he had to question that.<br />
________<br />
<br />
Thirty five minutes later, he came out of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shen, did it work?!&quot; 600 leaned in in anticipation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did that answer your questions about Us, Brother?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shen stared at them blankly for a bit.<br />
800 looked at 799, worried...&quot;Is-is he alright? I&#39;m reading him as &#39;normal&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry...I&#39;m...okay, guys. It worked FINE, 600.&quot; Shen said, slowly coming out of the fugue.<br />
&quot;You guys...wanted to prove what you got is real? Mission accomplished. I met 11 of your Sisters...It was...I said...&quot;<br />
<br />
600 gently unlatched it and lifted the headband from his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey...you...okay?&quot; 799 brushed his hair back, worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...sorry...it&#39;s hard to take in, I guess, Mom.&quot; He paused. &quot;It wasn&#39;t...a program or whatever. Didn&#39;t FEEL like that, anyway. They were...amazing...I...didn&#39;t think that...umm...inorganics...could DO art...I...&quot;<br />
<br />
He paused as 799 brushed his unruly hair backward, as he stared blankly at his hands.&quot;Would...they accept me, Mom? My art, compared with THEIRS... is...was...pitiful.&quot; He paused, trying to get his mind in order. &quot;One of them sculpted huge trees like they were bonsai trees made of clay...one sculpted with SOLID. LIGHT...and they ALL were so...peaceful.&quot; He looked up at the blue optics that had freaked him out earlier, but now, strangely, the fear had bled off and he only felt curiosity.<br />
<br />
799 kissed him on the forehead and rubbed his cheek. &quot;The Medical Caste accepted your Sister and myself despite our inexperience...Why would the Artisan Caste turn YOU away? You&#39;re a curious artist, and you do DAMNED fine watercolors and comic work. Who WOULDN&quot;T want that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If-If I were to, um, &#39;Change&#39; like you guys...how would Dad handle it? I...wouldn&#39;t want him to be alone at home as the only...human.&quot;<br />
<br />
799 smiled. &quot;No problem, Honey. Your father and I talked earlier. He sees the possibilities like you do, now. He had the same hesitation, but he&#39;s willing to do it if YOU are...Sister?&quot; She ended hopefully.<br />
<br />
Shen got to his feet, and headed for the door. 800 handed him his sketchpad.<br />
He took a shaky breath. &quot;STILL not too comfortable about THAT part, but, if that&#39;s how it works, then I&#39;ll deal...besides...I won&#39;t be able to get the full experience staying HERE...let&#39;s go...Sisters.&quot; he said as he headed toward the door...<br />
<br />
Only to be glomped by 3 relieved Gynoids...<br />
_______<br />
<br />
When they got back to the TF room, Quan was sitting on the couch, talking with 9901.<br />
As they entered he looked up, with a question on his face.<br />
<br />
The fact that all three gynoids wore broad grins said it all.<br />
<br />
He got up and walked over to his son.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah. Did they use the headband to show you...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Quan nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Met a lot of them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;7 Engineers. It was a short session with it. They were from across the Universe...along with a few Artists they collaborated with...<br />
The things they can DO with alloys, stone, natural materials...even FABRICS...&quot; He sighed.<br />
&quot;They&#39;ve set a HIGH bar for me...I hope I can get up to that point...You?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Same feeling. Met 11 of them, Dad. I met a tree Sculptor, if you can BELIEVE it...15001/Art. I...felt...like she was...ANCIENT...but her enthusiasm made her feel SO much younger...I met one that was...imposing as hell, physically. She was a ...what did she call it?...&#39;coherent light&#39; sculptor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Forms out of &#39;solid&#39; light?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup. Sculptures...I didn&#39;t KNOW light could DO that...!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Saw one case of THAT in one of the collaborations..a bridge...BEAUTIFUL.&quot; Quan&#39;s eyes lit up like two small suns. &quot;I wish I could show this world what I saw. THAT was a collaboration between a...spider-woman gynoid Engineer who spun a bridge...and the light sculptor Artisan, who decorated it.&quot; He took a breath, &quot;My God! She SPUN this bridge with her spinnerettes...By all rights, it looked so delicate and fragile it shouldn&#39;t have been able to support itself, but I saw it weather the equivalent of a Category 5 Storm...without a peep out of it! Amazing! Simply Amazing!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you and I might be able to work together, then, Dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Quan hugged his son. &quot;Hope so, Shen...Looking FORWARD to it...Sooo...I&#39;d best get going...&quot;<br />
<br />
799 came up to him with a smile on her face, and he engulfed the Medic in a bear hug.<br />
&quot;See you soon...Sister...&quot; He murmured. She excitedly kissed him long and hard on the lips.<br />
And he turned and strode up the ramp.<br />
<br />
It was...creepy...and fascinating...as Shen watched the extended process take place.<br />
Not so much the skin conversion...he&#39;d SEEN that...but to see the proportions...shift. He watched as his father&#39;s waist slowly lost girth, his overall musculature diminishing to a slim, svelte level, his hips and thighs widening, his ribcage and shoulders narrowing and tapering, proportions adjusting everywhere.<br />
<br />
His face shifted slowly...but substantially...until it was the face of a cute Chinese woman. It still managed to look like a attractive, female version of his father.<br />
<br />
When the sizable...&#39;breasts&#39; were generated and grew, &#39;Quan&#39; let off a breathless moan in a much higher pitch than Shen ever thought possible.<br />
<br />
He watched as the polymer skin formed in the same gunmetal shade as 600&#39;s, and was not surprised to see his...Mother(?) crack open her ruby optics at one point, while moaning in ecstasy.<br />
<br />
5 minutes later, the &#39;waves&#39; subsided, and the machine powered down. Shen watched, with some nervousness, as the new Engineer opened her red eyes fully, and, reluctantly, pushed herself free of the &#39;beanbag&#39;. She stood still for a moment, getting her bearings.<br />
She looked down at herself with some fascination and curiosity, poking the two additions to her upper chest, and then went down the ramp. She got joyful hugs from 600, 799, and 800. She then looked over and slowly sashayed over to Shen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hug for me...Sister?&quot; she said in a feminine voice, holding out both her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhm...yeah...sure...&quot; Shen nodded, and gave his...Mother?...Sister? a firm hug. &quot;Gotta say...This is...kinda weirding me out right now...umm...Dad.&quot; he whispered.<br />
<br />
He heard the humor in the electronically edged voice, &quot;Yeah, me, too, Shen. Can&#39;t see my TOES anymore with these things in the way.&quot; She giggled.<br />
His...&#39;mother&#39;? &#39;Sister&#39;?...pulled back and held him by the shoulders. Shen looked into those almost liquid-looking, glowing optics as she shook her head. &quot;Don&#39;t worry...You&#39;ll LOVE this, Sister...TRUST me.&quot; she said quietly, smiling.<br />
<br />
Shen swallowed, nodded and started up the ramp before he could chicken out...<br />
<br />
Shen slowly leaned back into the silvery &#39;water&#39;. He was tense, and startled a bit as what felt like soft foam supports formed under his body. Slowly, ever so slowly, he felt vibrations going through his body, slowly increasing in strength. Within minutes, he was feeling so good that his tension drained away.<br />
<br />
The more he relaxed, the deeper the vibrations seemed to reach. He began to feel like every cell was vibrating. Then vibrations shifted, and began to pulse strangely and repeatedly in his hips, his chest, his face, even as the general cellular &#39;vibrations&#39; continued in the rest of his body. He was vaguely aware of what felt like his body shifting, shrinking, reforming...and STILL, he felt the pulses as his human body parts were reconfigured on a quantum level into complex, inorganic parts.<br />
<br />
The specifications of...her...new body continued to adjust. <br />
<br />
As the globe shapes on her upper chest formed and grew bigger, she let off with a moan that would have stunned her old self with how feminine it sounded. <br />
<br />
&lt;_This...This Is...BEYOND anything...I&#39;d ever dreamed of...!&gt; She thought in rapture.<br />
<br />
She was in a state of bliss, and hoping, praying...WISHING...that it would last forever...but it still finished far too soon, ten minutes flying by.<br />
<br />
It was when everything came to a stop...the vibrations ceasing, that she stirred.<br />
&lt;_AWWW! C&#39;mon! JUST when it was getting GOOD!&gt; she thought.<br />
<br />
The new gynoid opened her green optics and waited as they adjusted to the light, then pushed herself, grudgingly, out of the &#39;beanbag&#39;. She looked down at her new self...at the silver polymer skin...at her green highlights and nails. <br />
<br />
&lt;_Wow. Not TOO shabby...&gt; 402 thought, lifting up and examining her hands and noting the data ports housed in her longer, softly luminous green plasteel nails more closely. Hesitantly, she poked at the nicely sized foreign objects on her upper chest...&lt;_Well, I guess they&#39;re not designed to be ...sensitive...but STILL...&gt; she thought, a bit disappointed. <br />
<br />
She twisted, looking down at her body&#39;s new &#39;assets&#39;, studying her ample bosom and hips.<br />
<br />
&lt;_Didn&#39;t expect to be so...uhm...curvaceous, though.&gt; Her cheek marks were glowing a more intense green as she looked  &lt;_I look...pretty HOT. It&#39;s a good thing my &#39;boys&#39; aren&#39;t here anymore, or I&#39;d be...upright now. &gt;<br />
<br />
402 sighed. &lt;_Why does it feel...so...&#39;normal&#39; now?&gt; She moved her body and noticed she was holding herself...rather femininely...without even thinking about it...much like her Sister had. &lt;_Support programs, probably. Don&#39;t want a hot gynoid tromping around like a guy...&gt;<br />
<br />
*pipp*<br />
&lt;_Hunh?!&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 520800/Mdc To: [loc] : My Sister has SOME curves! DBFTW (Digital Beyonce for the Win!) ;) &gt;<br />

&lt;I.M. From: 518799/Mdc To: 200402/Art : I raised her stronger than THAT! *proud* &gt;<br />

<br />
&lt;_WAIT...HOW do I...wait...AH...Got it!&gt;<br />

&lt;I.M. From: 200402/Art To: 520800/Mdc: For WHAT, Sis?&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 9901/Ems To: 200402/Art, [loc] : For Becoming, 402. For fighting through your FEAR. That&#39;s not easy to do ALONE in your own head as a Human. Don&#39;t forget that...bravery/courage is important...for Us as much as the humans. Keep in mind what they endure. Not EASY to Become from THIER P.O.V. &gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 200402/Art To: [loc] : Yeah, thanks, Sister 9901 :) ...Just SAYING: It feels...weird... Feels GOOD, but...weird.&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 518601/Eng To: 200402/Art : Agreed. Takes a bit of getting USED to, 402...Body&#39;s balance is different...Center of Gravity is lower. But I&#39;m LIKING how I came out. :) You look good too, Sister.&gt;<br />
&lt;I.M. From: 200402/Art To: 518601/Eng : 0////0  T-Thanks. :D&gt;<br />
*pipp*<br />
<br />
402 strode down the ramp, stopping next to the newest Engineer, 601. They held hands as 9901 looked at them and announced their Serial Numbers, already recorded in their systems,<br />
&quot;Again, you have my gratitude for your bravery in joining Us, Sisters. Each of your unique LifeGifts will help us heal this planet and Universe, and help you grow FAR beyond what you were ONCE capable of.&quot;<br />
