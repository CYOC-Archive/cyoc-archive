<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">  Ryan got in the shower and tried to remember what he did last night, the harder he concentrated the more his head hurt. He remembered going up into the loft and drinking, but it was all black after that, and his head was killing him. Ryan let the last remaining bit of warm water wash over him before it went cold. He got out and headed back to the house to get dressed for breakfast. He found his muddy shoes on the porch just outside the door, he must have worn them last night. It hadn&#39;t rained in a while. Where was there mud? Where had he gone? During breakfast Aaron and Mike did most of the talking, they kept their parents attention away from Ryan, who was clearly struggling. They&#39;d never covered for him like this before, it was nice. The triplets, as they now were, finished up, grabbed their stuff for school and went out to the truck.  All three boys jumped in the truck bed. Ryan was a bit befuddled, normally Aaron drove, &quot;who&#39;s driving?&quot; Ryan asked confused. Aaron and Mike chuckled, &quot;Yeah right, I&#39;ll get the keys from mom&quot; Mike laughed. <br />
&quot;When you turned gay did you also get to turn 16?&quot; Aaron teased. Ryan tried to keep his face steady. What had he done? Their mother had gotten in the truck and started to pull out of the driveway. They were heading to the high school, and based on the last conversation, they were less than 16. He couldn&#39;t just ask, ohh hey guys when is our birthday again? They&#39;d think he&#39;d lost it. If he left the twins birth date and month the same and just matched his to theirs and then lowered all of their ages, they&#39;d be 15 now. His head hurt again the more he tried to figure it out, he assumed that if they were 14 they&#39;d be going to the middle school and left it at that. Today was going to be rough. <br />
  <br />
  They got to school, Ryan followed his brothers to their lockers. Mike looked at him amused, he walked Ryan two lockers down and opened it for him. &quot;Just, uhh, stay near me today, and we&#39;ll getcha through this,&quot; Mike offered with a smile. &quot;Yeah, whats my combo again?&quot; Ryan asked weakly, &quot;I may have over done it a little last night&quot; he said with a weak laugh. Mike gave him a concerned look before scribbling down a series of numbers. Aaron was talking Peter down the hall, they were standing close, Ryan saw them shake hands and Aaron came bouncing back. &quot;Hey, that senior Peter sells his old Oxy and I got you one&quot; Aaron slid him what looked like a horse pill and a bottle of water, &quot;he said to take ha..&quot; Ryan was so excited about the prospect of relief he&#39;d already thrown the pill in his mouth and taken a big swig of water to get it down. &quot;half&quot; Aaron finished, &quot;well it looks like you&#39;re going to have a fun day, come on goon lets get you through today. <br />
<br />
  Ryan followed his brothers from class to class for the first few hours of the day.  The oxy had kicked in about 15 minutes after he took it and he felt like he was floating. He could no longer feel his headache, though the events of the night where not becoming much clearer. He had begun to notice the changes around him almost immediately though. More than a few of the girls and teachers that Ryan had fantasized about in the past suddenly were chestier and/or thinner. The sophomore history teacher had jumped from a B cup to double D&#39;s. Aj and Charlie walked right past him, which he thought was weird, before realizing they probably didn&#39;t even know him.  They had all become friends in school because they were all in the same class, now that Ryan was younger that had never happened. Ryan had never liked time travel episodes of any show, there were always too many unresolved issues or inexplicable loopholes, and now he was living one. He did see Aj look back and check Mike out. God oxy was fun, Ryan thought, with a big dumb smile on his face. The triplets headed to math class.<br />
<br />
  The freshman math teacher, Ms. Blair, was only a few years out of college and looked liked she could have been a model.Tall, blonde and thin normally Ryan could see that he had done some work on her. Her already ample breast were even bigger, her shirt strained to keep them contained. Where her eyes that shade of purple or had was that Ryan too? Ryan&#39;s eyes were locked on her chest, he didn&#39;t hear a word she had said all class, he sat quietly fantasizing about what they looked like exposed. He hadn&#39;t even realized the hour was almost over, she was handing back a quiz that apparently they&#39;d taken recently. Ryan watched her walk down the aisle, her boobs gently rocking as she turned left and then right to give each student back their quiz. Ryan didn&#39;t even look at his at first, he was so close he could have leaned forward and put his face into her cleavage as she set his paper down. &quot;Very disappointing&quot; she said sternly, this snapped Ryan back, he looked down and and saw a big D- on his paper. He looked left and Mike&#39;s, he&#39;d gotten a F. Written across the top was, &#39;see me over lunch for extra credit&#39;. The bell rang and Ms. Blair left the class, while the students packed up to head to lunch. Ryan walked out examining his work on the quiz. He couldn&#39;t be sure, but the work all looked right. He didn&#39;t pay much attention to where his brothers were leading him. &quot;Guys I think Ms. Blair screwed up, this is all right&quot; he was dazed. His brothers laughed, &quot;More extra credit for us,&quot; Aaron snickered, &quot;Mike are you going to be cool with this?&quot; Mike nodded his head.  Ryan was really stupefied now, and why were they on the 4th floor near that bathroom no one uses. The boys walked in to an undressing Ms. Blair, &quot;We have 30 minutes&quot; she stated matter of factly and Mike and Aaron started stripping down. <br />
<br />
  Ryan stood there stupefied, for a minute before an already naked Mike, reached over and unbuttoned Ryan&#39;s pants. Ryan snapped to as Aaron was pulling his shirt up and over his head, lifting Ryan&#39;s arms to get them out of the sleeves. As his head emerged, he saw Ms. Blair laying on a the tile floor, naked watching them. &quot;Let me do his pants&quot; she moaned, crawling over. The pulled his pants and underwear down in one swift pull. Ryan&#39;s cock was at full mast. &quot;I never get tired of seeing it,&quot; Ms. Blair cooed, &quot;now put it inside me.&quot; She got on her hands and knees and pulled Aaron&#39;s cock into her mouth, Mike nudged Ryan towards here, pointing at her exposed pussy. Ryan shuffled up and and started working his huge meat into her tight hole. She moaned, softly at first but louder as they kept going. Ryan pumping from behind and Aaron fucking her face from the front. Ms. Blair stopped them and flipped over. She grabbed Ryan&#39;s ass, and told him to get back in her. He slid in and kept going. Aaron and Mike were on each side of her, she was watching them jack off. Aaron shot first all over her chest with Mike close behind. The pill was numbing Ryan&#39;s sensitivity and giving him extra endurance. Ms. Blair looked at Mike and moaned out a &quot;pop his cork.&quot; Mike reached his finger down into the small puddle of fluid Ms. Blairs repeated orgasms were creating flowing from her cunt. Mike slid behind Ryan and slowly and gently slid his wet finger into his brother. It wasn&#39;t right but it felt so good, Mike worked the finger in and out until Ryan blew his load. Rope after rope of hot cum filled the tiny hole leaving quite a bit flowing out. Ms. Blair stood up and cleaned up, Ryan didn&#39;t know what to make of what had just happened. Mike pulled out of him. Ms. Blair was already dressed, she turned back to them as she got to the door, &quot;good news, you boys got an A.&quot; Aaron and Mike beamed at each other, Ryan was a weird mix of emotions.</p>
