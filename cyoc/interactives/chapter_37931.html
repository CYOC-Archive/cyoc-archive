<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Back outside, things had really changed quite a bit.  More and more boys were starting to change dramatically.  Pointed ears and hair was only the beginning for many.  Others had started growing short tails, some had thickening in their lips and widened nostrils, and others had harden thick toes that clacked on the cobblestone street.  The laughs and cheers were become more strained and speech was starting to slur.<br />
<br />
Jake and Dean walked out back into the lights of the boardwalk and took a breath of the fresh air.  Dean shuffled awkwardly as he walked, the bump on his rear starting to ache.  Jake’s steps were odd as well, as he was having trouble planting his heel to the ground.  “How abwout swome more bb bbbeeeers,” Dean struggled, his lips now dark brown along with his nose.  “Yeah, I guess I could use another,” Jake smiles.  They walk down the boardwalk looking for a cart and spot one, of course surrounded by boys.<br />
<br />
They managed to push through and grab a couple of glasses and get them filled, but they don’t last too long, as they drink them down in a massive chug.  Jake starts to wobble and almost falls over.  “Whoa, I think I need to sit down for a minute,” he says.  Jake and Dean walk over to a bench and Jake barely makes it as he falls into it.  “Aw you okway,” Dean stammers.  “Yeah, I think so, but my feet are killing me,” Jake groans.  He lifts one of his feet up and rubs it.  His foot is much longer now, with dark brown hair all over.  His toes are now one solid thick mass, which he massages.  Dean plops down next to him, but a loud RIP comes from his pants.  Dean looks back and sees the seat of his pants had split, exposing his boxers.  Jake just laughs as Dean stands again to inspect it, “stwupid pwants.  Awww don’t need’m,” Dean mumbles as he loosens his belt and lets them fall.  Dangling from the bottom of his boxers was a long brown tail, with a few dark hairs at the end.<br />
<br />
“Aw you fweeling bbbbeeeeter yet?” Dean grumbles.  Jake nods and plants his, now very much hooves, to the ground, “bwhere dwou you wanna gwo next?” Jake blurts.  Dean points over to a small building shaped like a giant 8-Ball.  The two of them walk over and go inside.<br />
<br />
The inside was pretty much what they expected, a room filled with pool tables.  What they didn’t expect was that there were several donkeys wandering about the room with the boys, and a few tables and chairs were totally trashed.  Then an angry donkey came charging toward them and they both jumped out of the way as it brayed and ran out of the hall.<br />
<br />
“Bwhat was thwat abwout,” Jake groaned, standing up.  “Swaam donkeeeeeys muswa gowt woose,” Dean struggled, his nostrils now joined with his lips forming a slight muzzle.  They both looked around and saw several boys playing games, but with much difficulty.  Some of them could barely stand up right, their bodies covered in hair.  One boy struggled to hold the pool cue, his fingers all curled up and fusing together.  “Jwack pwot,” Dean points across the room, to an open bar filled with beer taps.  They both run over and fill a glass and sip it and then top it off again.<br />
<br />
Then a loud set of brays came from nearby.  They looked over as a boy’s hands formed into hooves and his clothes started to rip off.  He was leaning on the pool table, with his new hooves pawing at the felt.  The newly formed donkey brayed a few times and then dropped to the ground and seem to look around, lost.  The other boy at the table just sighed, “Aw need anotwer pwayer.”  Dean jumped at the opportunity, “Aw pwaw hee,” he half brayed walking to the table.<br />
<br />
Dean took a couple shots, but the game didn’t last long.  The other boy started to stammer his speech more and more until it was his turn.  “Fwar in thwe cwaaaner paawwwkee haw hee haw,” he brayed dropping his stick.  “Waait, whaaaw hawwppenning twooo meeee HAW HEE HAW,” the boy pawed at his face with his new hooves and then fell onto all fours.  He brayed wildly kicking off his clothes as they ripped and kicked all around the room.<br />
<br />
Dean looked over at Jake for a moment as they took assessment of themselves.  Dean’s ears were fully grown and his face was nearly that of a donkey.  His boxers were straining as his hind quarters swelled up more and his feet and hands and formed into hooves.  Jake’s lips and nostrils and grown together and a tail slid out from his shorts.  “Dwean, swomething’s wong,” Jake cried, but Dean just let out a massive bray.<br />
<br />
Dean fell to the ground and was a total donkey.  He just brayed looking around the room with a sad look.  Jake was in a panic.  “Thwis cwan’t beeee hawww,” he brayed and touched his face.  “Nooaawww,” he cried feeling his changing features and then looked at his hands.  They were turning darker by the second and then curled up into a fist.  “Heelp, haaaallpp meeeee HAW HEE HAW,” Jake cried as his face stretched out and he fell of the bar stool he was on.  He writhed on the floor for a moment as his hand formed into hooves and his shorts and shirt ripped apart.  He brayed madly calling for help, but soon his cries for help, were cries of panic and fear.  He got up and kicked all around him, afraid something was behind him.  He charged out of the Pool Hall and into the crowds of donkeys that were now braying all over the island.</p>
