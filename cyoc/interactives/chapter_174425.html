<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris had gone back to taking shots after his puzzling talk with Tanya. His sister was going loopy but if that got him a date with Nancy he would put up with it. Nancy was the star player in Tanya&#39;s basketball team despite being a year younger than the other girls. At 15 she was still older than Chris and and a year his senior at school. Despite his attraction to the tall girl he had not dared ask her out.<br />
<br />
Chris admired the way she played as well as the way she looked. He guessed Nancy&#39;s 6 ft height might intimidate other boys but to Chris her height was something really attractive. Still not 15 Chris was 6 ft 3 and still growing. They were both centres. Basketball was Chris&#39;s life and thanks to a growth spurt over the last year he was making a name for himself. <br />
<br />
Tanya came back out and told Chris &#39;Nancy has agreed to go out with you. She&#39;s going to come around after dinner. I&#39;ll leave it up to you to sort out the details for your date. Oh and here is $100. You can&#39;t accuse me of not fulfilling my part of the bargain&#39;<br />
<br />
Chris was surprised that Nancy was so eager to hand him some cash but he readily took it from her outstretched hand before she changed her mind.<br />
<br />
Tanya couldn&#39;t help but notice Chris&#39;s embarrassment that he had developed an erection when she had said Nancy had agreed to the date. Chris was so naive. He could have asked any of Tanya&#39;s friends out and they all would have accepted. She half knew that the reason she was &quot;In&quot; with the sporty group was on account of her brother. It was widely acknowledged amongst the girls at school that Chris was an A grade hunk.<br />
<br />
Chris put his basketball down and went inside to stash away the cash. He also wanted to have a shower. If Nancy was coming over he did not want to be sweaty.<br />
<br />
Nancy turned up just after dinner. She was wearing a dark blue dress that showed off her long legs. She was excited by the idea of a date with Chris. She had also showered and spent time fixing her hair. Her mother had looked on with amusement. She knew her daughter had a crush on the the Morrison boy and had guessed extra attention to her looks had something to do with that rather than the need to see Tanya and discuss basketball tactics. Her parting words to Nancy had been &#39;Make sure you are back home by 10.30&#39;<br />
<br />
Tanya had intercepted Nancy at the door and after saying hello to Tanya&#39;s parents the two of them had gone to Tanya&#39;s bedroom. If Tanya&#39;s parents thought it strange that Nancy was dressed up they didn&#39;t say anything. Nancy was a frequent visitor to the Morrison household.<br />
<br />
Once Nancy was ensconsed in her room Tanya went and fetched Chris from his room. He had been waiting impatiently ever since dinner. He joined the girls but became tongue tied when he saw Nancy&#39;s attire. She was gorgeous and he loved how her long brown hair had a wave in it. Usually Nancy tied her hair in a ponytail but tonight it was loose.<br />
<br />
Seeing Chris was at a loss for words Tanya took the initiative. &#39;I&#39;ll leave you two together for 5 minutes. Work out the when&#39;s and where&#39;s of your date. When I return we can get on with the demonstration&#39;<br />
<br />
Neither of the others paid attention to Tanya&#39;s parting words. They only had eyes for each other. Seeing that Chris wasn&#39;t going to say anything Nancy said &#39;I&#39;d really like to see the new Wonder woman movie&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;d like to take you to see it&#39; uttered Chris.<br />
<br />
&#39;It&#39;s a date then. But it will have to be tomorrow night. I&#39;m expected at my grandmothers birthday on Saturday. Would that suit you&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes. Of course..... Would you like to have dinner first?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;d love to. How about I meet you at the clock tower at 6 tomorrow night?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes. I&#39;ll be there&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;So it&#39;s a date?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes it&#39;s a date&#39; Chis sighed with relief.<br />
<br />
Nancy had a big grin on her face &#39;How about we seal the date with a kiss&#39; with that she moved towards the embarrassed boy, stood on her tippy toes and kissed Chris on the mouth. Nancy had never kissed a boy taller than herself before. She pressed her bosum against Chris&#39;s broad chest. That got the response she was looking for. Chris&#39;s arms enveloped her and he began to kiss her back.<br />
<br />
Tanya choose that moment to return to her room. &#39;I see you two seem to be in agreement. The date is fixed I gather?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes&#39; said Nancy. The embarrassed Chris just nodded.<br />
<br />
&#39;Great. So Chis I did my side of the bargain. Do you agree to do yours?&#39;<br />
<br />
Again Chris just nodded.<br />
<br />
&#39;Fantastic! Okay Nancy I promised you a demonstration. Are you ready?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;For what?&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;To see how I am going to have Chris join our basketball team&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;I really don&#39;t see how that&#39;s possible. Not too many girls are as tall as Chris&#39; said Nancy<br />
<br />
&#39;But it is with this&#39; said Tanya holding up a necklace. &#39;It&#39;s magical. With this I can change Chris into anyone I want&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Nonsense Tanya. Your delusional&#39; replied Nancy now protective of her &quot;Boyfriend&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Remember Mary Rodgers. The girl who used to be as tall as you in 7th grade?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes. She moved to Canada didn&#39;t she?&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;Well we met her last Christmas when we were on vacation and she has grown up. Somehow I ended up with one of her bra&#39;s in my luggage. I can use it to change Chris into Mary&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;But Mary is nowhere near my height&#39; said Chris. He remembered the girl . She was tall but shorter than Nancy, probably even shorter than Tanya who was 5&#39;9.<br />
<br />
&#39;The people in town don&#39;t know that. I intend to use the medallion twice. Once to change Chris into Mary, then a second time to make &quot;Mary&quot; taller. Mary will then join our basketball team for the rest of the season. No backing out now Chris. Remember you promised that you would help us out if I set you up a date with Nancy. I&#39;ve done my part of the bargain. Now it&#39;s your turn&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Hold on!&#39; said Nancy. &#39;Suppose what your saying is actually true. Where would &quot;Mary&quot; live and what would happen to Chris&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Chris would just have to become Mary on the days we had a game. The rest of the time he could be himself  and you two could continue dating. We could say Mary was staying with an aunt for the summer&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I can&#39;t imagine this could actually work&#39; said Nancy &#39;But if I can still have Chris as a boyfriend why not?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well just take the medallion Chris. Then touch it to that bra on top of my dressing table&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m not sure...&#39; said a worried sounding Chris<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh don&#39;t be a coward. I&#39;ve set you up on your date. Once we establish &quot;Mary&#39;s&quot; identity you can be yourself again until our game&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;When is your game anyway?&#39;   <br />
<br />
&#39;Every Sunday but we just have two more games before finals. You would need to play both to qualify for the finals&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;How do you know that this actually works?&#39; said a sceptical sounding Chris<br />
<br />
&#39;I looked it up on the internet&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Have you actually tried it?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Not yet. I only bought it this morning&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;So you think this will work because of something you read on the internet?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;You took my money. If you don&#39;t do this for me I want my money back&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;If I indulge you and touch this bra. Do you promise I can keep the money?&#39; Chris was now convinced Tanya had been conned.<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes, you test out the medallion and you can keep the money&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Okay. You&#39;re the witness Nancy. This is the easiest money I every made&#39;<br />
<br />
With that Chris picked up the medallion that Tanya had placed on her bed.</p>
