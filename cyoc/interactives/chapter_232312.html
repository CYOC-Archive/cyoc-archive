<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">... An age swap of the entire family. And the recipients of that magic would be 8 year old Mitch, the 35 year old Eric, and 38 year old Adrian. They were asleep when the magic hit, so needless to say, they would be in for quite the surprise when they woke up.<br />
<br />
Mitch was dressed on the warm spring night in his Spider-man pajama top and shorts, while Eric was dressed in a t-shirt and boxers and Adrian in a wife beater and boxers.<br />
<br />
Their transformations began all at once and started at the bottom. Mitch&#39;s toes and feet slowly began to swell and grow larger from the dainty kid size 5 shoe to a monster sized adult 15&quot; shoe that would be hard to find in most shoe retail stores. Once having reached their proper size, small light brown hairs began to grow from the top of his toes, eventually leaving the sight of Mitch to anyone who would have witnessed him at this point in the transformation resembling something akin to what Tolkien had described of a hobbit.<br />
<br />
Eric and Adrian&#39;s feet lost what little hair was on their toes as that sunk back into their skin before their feet began to shrink smaller and smaller still until both had landed somewhere around the kid size 3 to kid size 4 shoe range--which looked ridiculous matched with their otherwise adult bodies--as though they had bound their feet since childhood, keeping them unnaturally small and dainty.<br />
<br />
Mitch&#39;s legs then began to grow and stretch to match and gain the ability to move the massive boats that were his feet. Slowly his feet grew further and further away from his still prepubescent body as his legs stretched longer and longer until they looked somewhat proportionate with his feet. And it was only then that his gangly stretched out legs and butt began to swell with muscle and girth, causing his Spiderman pajama shorts to be pushed up and be stretched until they looked more like tight short-shorts than pajama shorts. His calves grew strong and toned, his thighs  followed suit, with hair growing first from the ankle, all the way up the legs. Leaving a child atop clearly adult legs and feet.<br />
<br />
Eric and Adrian meanwhile began to lose their hair as it slowly sank back into their skin and the muscles of their legs shrank, leaving their legs thin and scarecrow like before they two began to collapse in on themselves like and accordian coming back together after having been stretched as far as they could possibly could. Soon, small, thin and smooth little boys&#39; legs sticking out from their now voluminous boxers had replaced their former adult ones to match their tiny feet. Soon the adult upper bodies contrasted with their childish lower bodies.<br />
<br />
Mitch&#39;s torso was next to change as it too began to grow and stretch, causing his Spiderman t-shirt to stretch until it began to tear and ripped right open as with each breath Mitch took muscle began to fill out his stretched out torso. Pecks and abs filling in and then covered with a slight layer of fat to give Mitch an older huskier appearance of a thirty-something man having let himself go though only slightly into a dad-bod. Chest hair grew and erupted, covering his pecs and following straight down his slightly chubby abdomen to his navel.<br />
<br />
Eric and Adrian&#39;s chest hairs which they kept well groomed began to shrink into their skin until their torsos were completely smooth, at which point the thin man and smaller body-builder began losing muscle mass like crazy until they were left with skinny teenage looking torsos that began to shrink and be engulfed in the old t-shirt and wife beater they each wore. Soon their bodies mostly looked like that of young boys, with oddly adult arms and heads attached.<br />
<br />
Mitch&#39;s arms and neck now slowly began to grow and swell, soon joining his legs with the amount of muscle they showcased, and then covered with a light brown fringe of hair up and down his arms. His hands likewise grew from the small and slender things he&#39;d always known to larger bulkier, and clearly stronger hands that looked rough, clumsy, and worn. Mitch&#39;s groans began to grow deeper as his voice dropped from a boy soprano to that of a rumbling bass as his Adam&#39;s apple grew out. Soon a boy&#39;s head was the only thing attached to what clearly looked to be a man&#39;s body, and soon that head started to grow and change shape--the jaw becoming sharper and more angular, only to be covered with a well groomed faded full beard--the fade connecting with the faded sides of his hair which then likewise grew into a longer bit of dirty blond hair atop the fade on each side. The last part of Mitch to grow was his crotch, which had remained that of a child until this moment. His tiny prick standing to attention, stretching his pajama shorts to bursting as his balls dropped and acquired their own hair as his pubic bush grew and his penis swelled. In the end a 6&#39;5&quot; tall 36 year old dirty blond haired man now slept where the young eight year old Mitch had a few moments earlier.<br />
<br />
Eric and Adrian&#39;s finalization of their transformation as they lost muscle mass and hair on their arms and hands shrank to small boyish hands barely larger than crayon grippers. Their necks collapsed in on themselves as their Adam&#39;s apples shrank and their voices cracked and re-entered boy alto and then boy soprano ranges. Their heads shrank, their haircuts becoming shaggy messy boy cuts that barely looked like they&#39;d seen a barber recently, while their faces rounded, and five o&#39;clock shadows faded and were replaced with peach-soft skin. And then finally their adult sized penises shrank as their balls shriveled and pulled back up into the sockets that they live in all prepubescent boys. Soon two innocent looking seven year old boys, one raven haired and the other red-headed with freckles on his face had replaced Eric and Adrian Pendergast.<br />
<br />
It was only then that the magic began to reshape the world around all three. The room that Mitch was in grew into a master bedroom, with the tiny twin he&#39;d been sleeping on growing out into a full sized King. Toys, and other childish accoutrements disappeared only to be replaced with a rather adult looking nightstand with a lamp, a wardrobe, dresser, closet, and a door connecting to the master bedroom bathroom all appearing as the room settled into being the largest bedroom. Finally, Mitch&#39;s torn Spiderman pajamas grew and reshaped themselves into an old band t-shirt and boxer shorts.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Eric and Adrian&#39;s bedroom shrank to something more befitting a second bedroom. The King sized bed they had been sleeping on separated into two twins, one of which&#39;s legs grew tall as the other twin shuffled underneath it&#39;s matching pair, transforming into bunk beds. This left more room in the smaller bedroom for two dressers, a large closet, and two toy chests to appear, as well as posters of Pokemon, Minecraft, and other child-friendly video games to appear on the wall, which now acquired a sky motif painted on it. Their oversized sleepwear shrank until they transformed into smaller Iron Man (Adrian) and Batman (Eric) pajamas. Their bed spreads likewise shifted to more juvenile bed sheets with prints from the movie Luca adorning both boys&#39; beds.<br />
<br />
Mitch woke up with a start, feeling immediately that something was off. He didn&#39;t recognize his bedroom at first but the more he blinked and rubbed his temple the more his brain kicked in to reassure him that yes, this was his room in the house that he was paying a mortgage on. Mitch got up and padded his way into the bathroom, having to piss. He took a look at himself in the full length mirror found there--at first surprised by the visiage of a tall hairy looking dad of a man standing before him, until once again his brain reassured him that this is just what he&#39;d grown into--and the dreams of being an eight year old boy he&#39;d been having were just that--dreams.<br />
<br />
Worried about Eric and Adrian, Mitch left his bathroom and the master bedroom and walked down the hall to check on his da--boys. He slowly and quietly opened the door and looked in to see his twin sons fast asleep, Adrian snoring slightly. For some reason he had expected to find... but that had been part of his dream as well--to imagine Eric and Adrian older and acting as fathers to him--it was ridiculous. Mitch closed the door and laughed to himself as he reflected on how good he had it with his boys. There was just one thing missing--something which niggled at the back of his mind as he returned to the master bedroom--where was their mother?</p>
