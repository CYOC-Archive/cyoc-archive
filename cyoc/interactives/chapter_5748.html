<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Joe, you know my friend Melanie, right?&quot; Amanda asked.<br />
<br />
I knew Melanie.  She was Amanda's best friend.  I had gotten along with her pretty well ever since Amanda and I started going out.  But I always got the sense she was upset to see Amanda spend time with me.  I felt she resented me somewhat.  I also felt that she resented males in general.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, hon,&quot; I replied.<br />
<br />
She smiled in approval of the pet name I used.  &quot;Well, I would really like her to remove the stick from her ass.  But it seems that she never will.  So I want you to do it for her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, sure,&quot; I said.  &quot;But how do you want me to do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We've obviously had a good time here.  Why don't we share it with her?  Is that cool with you two?&quot; she asked Katie and Cara.<br />
<br />
Katie said, &quot;What does this friend of yours look like, just out of curiosity?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda described Melanie.  She was short, only about 5'1&quot;.  She had perpetually curly, short, blonde hair.  Her breasts were small, about A cups if that.  She didn't seem to make an effort to improve her looks. She also wore glasses that seemed to make her shy.  Amanda guessed that she didn't like boys because she had no self-confidence.<br />
<br />
As Amanda concluded her description, Katie said, &quot;Why doesn't Joe give her confidence then?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda said, &quot;That's exactly what I want him to do.&quot;  She looked back up at me with doe eyes and said, &quot;Will you please help her?&quot;<br />
<br />
I stood up, lifting her with me.  Then I picked her up in the marriage carrying position, took her over to my sister's bed, sat back down, looked at her and said, &quot;How can I say no?&quot;  Cara and Katie joined us on the bed as Amanda sat on my lap, her arms holding me by the neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that Melanie would walk up to our front door, thinking that she is meeting us here for homework,&quot; I said.  Just then the doorbell rang.  I shouted down, &quot;Come on in,&quot; and we heard the door open and close.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are you guys?&quot; Melanie's tiny voice struggled to amplify.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Just come upstairs,&quot; I shouted back down.<br />
<br />
We heard Melanie climb the stairs and approach the room.  I quickly wished that she would not run away when she saw us.  Her glasses peered around the corner and she saw the four of us sitting there naked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the heck?&quot; she said.  &quot;What the--I mean--&quot; she was too shocked to speak correctly.<br />
<br />
Amanda took over.  &quot;Mel, don't be scared.  Joe, his sister, Katie, her friend, Cara, and myself have been having a wonderful afternoon full of sex.  And now you're going to join us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melanie shook her head in disbelief at what she heard and said, &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jim?&quot; Amanda gave me a look that told me to use the ring's power.<br />
<br />
I smiled at my ravishing girlfriend and said, &quot;Melanie, I wish you were naked.&quot;  She looked at me as if I was crazy until she noticed that she felt colder than she had a second ago.  She looked down to see that my wish had come true.  Melanie frantically tried to cover herself up as best she could.  She really looked as if she wanted to scream or cry or run away, but probably all three.  Thanks to my wish she couldn't though.<br />
<br />
Amanda attempted to reassure her startled friend.  &quot;Mel, relax.  We don't have a problem with being naked.  We're not going to laugh at you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't care!&quot; Melanie finally managed a scream.  &quot;Put my clothes back on!&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda looked back at me and said, &quot;Joe, please do something about this.&quot;<br />
<br />
I sighed and wished, &quot;Melanie I wish you would stop trying to cover yourself up and just relax.&quot;  Melanie's hands dropped to her sides, displaying her naked frame for the rest of us.  She had a very petite frame and really looked as if she could use some nutrition.  She still didn't have a pleased look on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, I'm calm now,&quot; she said.  Then she pleaded, &quot;Please just put my clothes back on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mel, we want to help you.  I know that you've missed spending time with me since I started seeing Joe.  I don't like seeing you upset, so I want to help you become more outgoing,&quot; Amanda reasoned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like myself just fine, thank you,&quot; Melanie snapped.  &quot;And I don't resent Joe; I get along with him just fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda was starting to lose patience.  &quot;Mel, I know you get along with him, but I also know you'd be better off if you could just loosen up and learn to enjoy life.  You should have a boyfriend, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melanie shot Amanda an angry look.  &quot;We've gone over this,&quot; she said.  &quot;I told you that I don't stand any chance of ever getting a boyfriend in this town.  They're all pigheaded and disgusting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then an idea sprang into Amanda's mind.  She leaned up to me and whispered something in my ear.  I smiled as I heard the plan she had in mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Melanie demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, fine, Mel.  You're right as usual,&quot; Amanda answered.  &quot;We'll give you your clothes back.&quot;  With that I made a silent wish and Melanie's clothes reappeared on her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we just study like we planned now?&quot; she asked.  &quot;After you've put some clothes back on,&quot; she added.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, actually, we can’t,&quot; Amanda said.  &quot;We gave your clothes back, but never said that was the end of it.”<br />
<br />
Another look of fear developed on Melanie’s trembling face.  “What do you mean?” she asked nervously.  <br />
<br />
“Do it, Joe,” Amanda commanded.<br />
<br />
“I wish Melanie’s breasts would grow as big as Amanda’s,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Oh, ha ha, very fun—“ Melanie was cut off as she felt an enormous pressure build up in her chest.  We all looked down to see that her mammaries were definitely increasing in size.  Melanie desperately tugged at her shirt, trying to alleviate the pressure.  It was no use though.  Her breasts would continue to swell until they matched my girlfriend’s impressive size.<br />
<br />
The sound of ripping fabric filled the air.  Melanie continued to clutch at her just, moaning in a combination of pain and delight as her chest swelled.  Suddenly a button literally flew off her shirt.  Her breasts were becoming too big to be contained by Melanie’s petite clothing.  I could see her nipples clearly erect through her cotton shirt.  Obviously her bra had already been torn to pieces.  A couple of other buttons flew off, bouncing of the room’s walls.  Her breasts forced her way through the opening.  They were still growing with no signs of slowing down.<br />
<br />
Melanie had to brace herself against the wall as the pressure and weight created by her bulging breasts became too much for her.  Her shirt still clung to her body, but if flapped in the air around her enormous globes.  At last the growing stopped and Melanie had an impressive set of tits to match Amanda’s.<br />
<br />
She took a moment to recover herself.  Finally looking down at them, she screamed in horror.  “What the hell have you done to me?” she wailed.  “How am I supposed to look normal like this?”<br />
<br />
“I believe Joe has that answer for you, Mel,” Amanda reasoned.<br />
<br />
I did.  “I wish that Melanie would grow to 5’10” in height.”<br />
<br />
The changes started immediately.  Her legs grew so fast that we could clearly see her pant legs riding up her shins.  The shirt that still clung to her shoulders lasted no more as her shoulders expanded to rip through the sleeves.  It fluttered to the ground.  Melanie’s hips and ass also seemed to grow out to match her expanding height.  Rips appeared in both areas on her khaki pants.  Soon they expanded out so much that they completely tore through the material.  Coupled with the expansion of her legs, her pants ripped in every place they could, leaving nothing more than a few tattered rags upon her body.  Her cotton panties also ripped to pieces under the strain of her changing body.  The only clothing left on her was the few pieces of her pants that remained.<br />
<br />
I silently wished that Melanie’s hair would become a flowing mane of curls, rather than the clumsy mess it was now.  I also wished that she wouldn’t need glasses, so that everyone could see her beautiful emerald eyes.  As soon as I made that wish she took off her glasses and tossed them to the floor.<br />
<br />
Melanie recovered herself, still overwhelmed by the change, to look at herself in Katie’s full-length mirror.  She was amazed at the sight she saw.  “Holy shit!” she exclaimed.  “I’m beautiful.  I’m gorgeous.  I-I-“ she tailed off and turned to look at us.  “How did you do this?”<br />
<br />
Amanda told her about the ring.  She concluded by saying, “Mel, I was sincere when I said I wanted to change you for the good.  I know that you would never talk to boys because you were afraid of rejection.  Well look at yourself now!  Guys will be drooling over you.”<br />
<br />
But Melanie was not totally satisfied.  “Yea, but the guys of this town are still such moronic wastes of matter.  I’m never going to find one I could but up with, let alone anything else.”<br />
<br />
Amanda scoffed, giggled a little and reminded her, “Mel, Joe has this ring.  We can fix that.  In fact, we already thought of the perfect someone for you.”<br />
<br />
Katie interrupted, “Well you guys have your fun.  Cara and I do have to go out.”  They stood up from the bed and Cara redressed herself.  Katie grabbed her pants and gathered up her shoes.  As she walked out, she said, “Joe, I think it would be best not to tell Mom about this.”<br />
<br />
“Well, duh,” I remarked.<br />
<br />
“Smart ass,” she mumbled, walking out of sight.<br />
<br />
We heard the front door open and close.  I could only hope that my sister put her shirt back on before she left.<br />
<br />
Amanda and I returned our attention to Melanie.  “Who do you have in mind?” she asked.</p>
