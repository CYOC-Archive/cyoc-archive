<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Things were quieter in Glendale's police station then Alice had thought. She had thought that they were always busy solving big and complicated crimes, but from what she heard through the mirrors most everything seemed rather small in scale, and from what she could see most of the people were working on some sort of paperwork.<br />
<br />
&quot;Best to start with the Chief of Police, as he likely knows the most,&quot; Alice thought and carefully looked out through the mirrors to make sure her coast was clear.<br />
<br />
For the moment the hallway was clear and she wasn't that far from the chief's office. After a few moments she saw a man come out of the chief's office and then announce something to the officers present.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to check the impound, see if Daryl came back for his motorcycle,&quot; Gill spoke, &quot;Hopefully he has and he's seen Frank.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Alice heard a few faint motions of acknowledgment, she wondered, &quot;mother rides a motorcycle?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice then watched as Gill left, and left his door open. She checked to see if she was clear, and when she was sure she was, she dove out of the mirror, landed as silently as glass could and moved into the office. Alice found it small and almost cramped. She partially wondered if Jensen's instructions to not disturb anything really mattered, as the place looked like a royal mess to the glass wolf. Sighing, Alice carefully approached the desk, noting the reflective surface on the computer, and that it was in no danger of loosing that reflectiveness for a good while.<br />
<br />
She carefully looked over the desk for anything that might be of help, but was extremely careful not to move anything. As she came closer, however, she saw a small post-it note sitting on top of a small stack of papers. The note read &quot;To Do: Find Frank and Daryl&quot;. Underneath it was a rather official looking sheet of paper that read: &quot;Case Number 876778943, Type: Missing Persons, Frank Butler and Daryl Lazarus, Status: Open*&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder what the asterisk means,&quot; Alice wondered as she looked at the paper, she carefully lifted it up to see another asterisk at the bottom followed by &quot;see file 87678943&quot;, &quot;ah, it is instructions. I must go to the file room next&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that Alice dove into the reflective light of Gill's computer screen. A moment later an almost depressed looking Gill returned to his office.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;How's it going?&quot; Marcy asked as she and Jenny came in with Mr. P following, &quot;Is Alice back yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She only just left,&quot; Bart answered from the spot where he was sitting, watching Jensen and Darla pace while Fran stood by trying to comfort her twin.<br />
<br />
&quot;She'll be alright, father,&quot; Jenny spoke up, &quot;we did make her indestructible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn't mean they can't tie her up,&quot; Jensen told his eldest daughter, &quot;and the mission is very important. It will give us the information we need to complete the Pack... through the game, anyway. Replacing Alice would be difficult if they capture her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You should have sent me to guard her,&quot; Mr. P spoke up, feeling his protective instincts rush to the fore.<br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt the police would mistake you for a loose drug dog,&quot; Jensen told his great-grandfather, &quot;but she will be safe. Even if someone sees her, they're not likely to look here first, and escape is only a mirror away for her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How long should this mission take?&quot; Mr. P questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Long enough for Alice to figure out what the police are doing in regards to my and Darla's disappearance,&quot; Fran answered the large quadrupedal wolf, &quot;as since Alpha Female did not make it so that others would forget our existence, it would be best to know where they are in this before bringing Julie and our daughters into the pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. P's tail wagged at the prospect of their being more pups to play with and protect, even as Marcy and Jenny climbed up onto his back.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Alice found the file room to be even smaller then the office she had just left. It wasn't much larger then a closet and was packed full of filing cabinets. She wondered why there was a mirror in the small space, but decided not to dwell on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;A royal mess,&quot; Alice commented, &quot;Most improper.&quot;<br />
<br />
She quickly found that the files were arranged by their case numbers and quickly began looking at the cards on the drawers to the filing cabinets until she came to one marked &quot;80000000 to 90000000&quot;. She then opened that draw and began flipping through the files inside it till she came to the &quot;missing persons&quot; file for her mother and aunt.<br />
<br />
The first page was an official missing persons report with a basic description of the people missing and when they were reported missing. The remaining pages were written reports about what the police had uncovered so far. Glancing through it quickly, Alice noted that the police had made little if any progress in getting any lead to where &quot;Frank and Daryl&quot; were. Apparently people had seen their police car, but missed seeing Frank and Daryl become Fran and Darla. Alice did her best to make sure she could memorize everything from the files that would be required, so that she could make her report.<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Here you are!&quot; Jasmine said in an excited voice as she found Sarah watching television with Ulysses, the movie &quot;Rudy&quot; was on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here we are,&quot; Sarah answered, &quot;Enjoying a moment or two of peace and quiet. What's all the excitement about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You haven't seen them yet?&quot; Jasmine asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seen who?&quot; Sarah questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Roger and Lawrence, of course,&quot; Jasmine informed the lavender she-wolf, &quot;Margot used her turn on them... very dreamy...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah-ha,&quot; Sarah answered, &quot;Have fun then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What, you're not going to come look?&quot; Jasmine asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is more to life then sex, and the sooner some of our pack members realize this, the quieter things will be,&quot; Sarah answered, &quot;the whole &quot;fight&quot; going on between Nicole and Zack is over it and I bet that it will make things worse rather then better the longer it goes on.&quot;<br />
<br />
At this Ulysses looked up noticing the conversation. The topic made him nervous, as he still felt out of place in that regard because of his age. It made him wish that at least Bart and Jenny would be friends with him, but he had never found the right way to approach them.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you'll have to admit it'll take some wind out of Zack's sails, right?&quot; Jasmine asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It might,&quot; Sarah commented, &quot;then again it might not... and if it doesn't, I do not want to be there when it goes down. Now, unless you have something serious, Ulysses and I were watching a movie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rudy!&quot; Jasmine gasped, temporarily forgetting about the two newly beefed up males, &quot;They have it on?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Scoot over,&quot; Jasmine urged, &quot;I'll join you. I loved this movie when I was a guy... though things have obviously changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah only shook her head. Ulysses only hoped that Jasmine would change her topic of conversation.<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, everyone, I have returned,&quot; Alice announced as she stepped out of the mirror, to be greeted by Jensen standing over her.<br />
<br />
Despite her indestructible glass body, Alice backed away slightly from the male wolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you find out?&quot; Jensen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Alice began, &quot;Mother and Auntie are officially listed as missing, but it doesn't seem like they have much in the way of clues.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is the case still open?&quot; Darla asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Mother,&quot; Alice answered, and noticed that Fran immediately looked depressed, &quot;but from what I gathered, it appears that it is only open because they can not yet &quot;presume&quot; that you have been murdered. But they have no leads as to where you are, and thus aren't being super active.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How long will it take them to close the case?&quot; Kaylee asked from her &quot;chair&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;That depends on what they do,&quot; Darla answered, &quot;If we are declared &quot;dead&quot; it will change from &quot;missing persons&quot; to a &quot;homicide&quot; case... and if that is the case it will likely stay open for awhile. However, if it remains a missing persons case, it could close in a week or two for lack of evidence.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fran whimpered.<br />
<br />
&quot;But they aren't looking,&quot; Jensen spoke as he listened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Alice nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we can still move to bring Fran's family in,&quot; Jensen spoke, &quot;so long as things are done carefully.&quot;</p>
