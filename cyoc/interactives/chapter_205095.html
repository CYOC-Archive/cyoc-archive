<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>finale to Eric&#39;s redemption and Jared&#39;s arc, with some karmic consequences ;) if y&#39;all have missed Ethan&#39;s POV, dw, I&#39;ll be giving him some attention next. Gonna be dramatic though!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Later on Wednesday, Eric was relaxing at home. After getting back, he said hello to Ethan and spent the rest of his time before dinner finishing some homework, and then watching TV for a bit. Eventually, as the afternoon was turning to evening, his thoughts turned once more to the day&#39;s events.<br />
<br />
Successfully bringing Jared down a peg and extracting a promise of good behaviour had been very satisfying. Almost as satisfying as the horrified expression on his face when that smug butthead pulled out his speedo to see how reduced the contents were. Though Greg could be goofy and annoying at times -- and Eric definitely understood why Ethan wasn&#39;t more than frenemies with him -- the presence of the older boy had helped it all go off without a hitch. Not to mention, the banter seemed to have cut actual holes in Jared&#39;s ego and gotten under his skin for real. Having an accomplice made it more fun for Eric.<br />
<br />
The lesson had been learned. <br />
<br />
His vow was fulfilled.<br />
<br />
Eric looked thoughtfully across to his dresser, where the ring was safely stashed inside.<br />
<br />
It had been a week and a half since the dog park incident and his last time with the larger shared cock, but it felt like an eternity with all the stuff that had happened. His anticipation had been steadily building ever since he had identified Brandon and reclaimed his lost property. Eric was SO ready to accept it, to be walking around home once again with that amazing jiggly mass filling his boxers.<br />
<br />
Maybe it was time?<br />
<br />
Right then, Eric&#39;s cell rang.<br />
<br />
It was Brandon.<br />
<br />
Surprised, he answered it, and on the other end, the boy was distraught.<br />
<br />
In tears and very upset, the younger Montgomery&#39;s voice was shaking as he told Eric what had happened. <br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
Jared had come home earlier in a strange mood, seeming particularly curt and dismissive. Although Brandon did his best to stay out of the way, he had a feeling something bad was about to happen. He didn&#39;t know why, but there was this sense of foreboding, like a storm in the air. Nothing was unusual about Jared&#39;s attitude being intolerably sour though, so Brandon tried not to let it bother him. About an hour later, his mom instructed him to take out the garbage. Being the obedient son that he was, he didn&#39;t argue and lugged the bin to the collection point by their front gate.<br />
<br />
Then on the way back in ... his brother was there, blocking the entrance.<br />
<br />
He did NOT look amused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you think you were being clever?&quot; Jared said, his voice a monotone. He was standing there all casual, but his eyes were the giveaway -- super cold and emotionless. &quot;That I wouldn&#39;t learn you were involved?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Involved? W-what are you talking about?&quot; Brandon responded, his anxiety going through the roof at what this might be about, his confusion very real.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t pretend. I know you helped him.&quot; The glare was like ice. &quot;What did I say would happen if you tried to screw with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;J-Jared, I didn&#39;t-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut it.&quot; The older brother snapped back, and then lifted something he had been holding by his side, to show it to Brandon. &quot;Remember this?&quot;<br />
<br />
It was a baseball glove.<br />
<br />
A very special baseball glove that Brandon used to play catch with his grandpa. His mom was never an active nor attentive parent, and always put Jared first, while his dad was just kinda absent and buried in work all the time. But his dad&#39;s dad? Grandpa had always been willing to spend time with him, and taught him to be kind and respectful of others. Brandon really missed him, and the glove was the only momento he got to keep after the old man had passed away. It had been missing for a few weeks though, and Brandon thought he had just misplaced it somewhere in his room.<br />
<br />
Clearly not.<br />
<br />
&quot;I- ... I thought I lost it-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you whined about it to Mom,&quot; Jared had interrupted again, shrugging, and it was then that Brandon noticed something else. The glove was dripping wet, like it had been dropped in water.<br />
<br />
Though, the way it was glistening, it couldn&#39;t be water.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just hanging onto it,&quot; he continued, &quot;in case you needed a reminder not to cross me. Like, right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared lifted his other hand, revealing a cigarette lighter. He flicked it once, and with a bored indifference brought the open flame up to the glove. With a soft woomph, it caught fire, the material immediately beginning to flame and char.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nooo! Jared! Stop!&quot; Brandon whimpered, and he stumbled forward, trying to grab it, but his brother simply took his shirt front and held him in place, blocking any attempt to touch. &quot;Please! Please stop it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You see that? Take a good look at it.&quot; He brought the burning glove in close, right in front of Brandon&#39;s face, as tears began to fill the younger brother&#39;s eyes. &quot;That&#39;s what happens when you don&#39;t listen -- and you know what else? You&#39;re gonna stop talking to that Eric kid. He can&#39;t help you. He&#39;s a shrimp, like you. He&#39;s all talk, and he doesn&#39;t have big enough balls to follow through on his promises.&quot; Jared began to walk back down to the gate, dragging Brandon with him, the boy&#39;s face now streaked with wetness. He popped the bin lid and held the disintegrating mitt up for one final inspection before tossing it into the garbage. &quot;So next time you think about running your mouth, remember this, or,&quot; his voice dropped, suddenly low and full of peril, &quot;it&#39;ll be something worse.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Jared closed the bin, let go of his brother, and walked off back towards the front door.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;He ... did all that? Said that to you?&quot; Eric couldn&#39;t believe what he was hearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah.&quot; Brandon was sniffling, and speaking softly into the phone. &quot;I know he told me not to talk to you, but ... you&#39;re the only friend I have who cares. I&#39;m out in the yard right now, where nobody else can hear me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric frowned, feeling awful that their lesson to Jared had rebounded right back onto Brandon instead. It wasn&#39;t regret, but an empathic sadness about what Brandon was going through. He knew feelings like that, and there was also a return of the anger at this arrogant bully not learning his lesson.<br />
<br />
It was more than that though; it was the fact that Jared hadn&#39;t taken him seriously.<br />
<br />
&quot;He thinks I&#39;ll just let this go? That I&#39;m bluffing? No.&quot; Eric thought to himself. &quot;I&#39;m going to keep my word. My balls are bigger than just about anyone&#39;s, but his? He&#39;s gonna see how small they are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Brandon, I&#39;m really sorry.&quot; Eric apologised out loud. &quot;The reason your brother got so angry, well, it WAS because of me. I, um, used my magic to teach him a lesson, but I guess it backfired. I never thought he&#39;d take it out on you like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; Brandon&#39;s voice was barely above a whisper, his tears having slowed to almost nothing, but he sounded resigned. &quot;You weren&#39;t to know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s not right what he&#39;s doing, and it needs to stop. I want to make it better for you, and,&quot; the younger Morales grinned to himself, a really dark thought entering his head, &quot;I think I know what I&#39;m going to do, but I want to get your permission. You trust me, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; He sniffed, clearing his throat, but his answer was immediate and without pause. &quot;I trust you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If there was a way to make your brother stop bothering you for good, would you take it? And by that I don&#39;t mean anything that will hurt him.&quot; Eric quickly added the last bit; he knew that even if Brandon hated his brother, he wasn&#39;t the sort to wish him real harm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, yeah.&quot; Brandon only had to think for a moment before agreeing. &quot;So long as you aren&#39;t gonna put him in hospital or anything really bad, of course I&#39;d want him to leave me alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing like that.&quot; He smiled, the idea coming together in his head. &quot;You know I can, uh, transform people?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s kinda complicated, but I can do stuff just like what happened to you at the cinema. That was too much though, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Brandon agreed. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t want my thing to stay like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric bit his lip in amusement, hardly about to mention that particular cock wasn&#39;t available even for a loan anyhow.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about earlier this afternoon, when you grew bigger for a few minutes? What was that like?&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a silence, while Brandon considered his answer, weighing the merits of temporarily possessing his older brother&#39;s cock, though he was hardly aware of whose it was and what was happening with Jared in the meanwhile.<br />
<br />
The description of Eric&#39;s &#39;magic&#39; was deliberately left vague, and Brandon&#39;s gullible nature meant he didn&#39;t ask any critical questions that could make the concept come apart. The younger Morales knew this, and used it to channel the responses towards the conclusion he wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was ... nice.&quot; Brandon admitted. &quot;I liked it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I learned a thing or two from my brother about this,&quot; Eric told him, ready to share some of the wisdom he&#39;d gained through swapping with Ethan and how people had responded to it. &quot;Lots of people will judge you on your size. It shouldn&#39;t matter, but it really does! It doesn&#39;t have to be REALLY huge, but ... if you had one like what you experienced today, you&#39;d be ahead of every boy in your year! I guess you won&#39;t know anything about sex stuff since you&#39;re younger than me ... but in a grade or two, you&#39;ll think having a bigger penis is really fun. The guys will respect you more, and girls will be interested in you if they find out. They&#39;ll want to see it, and you&#39;ll want to let them. It might grow even more once you get into puberty, and you&#39;ll probably want that too, once you know how cool it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;R-really?&quot; Brandon breathed into the phone, as if he were hearing some kind of divine secret about the universe for the first time. &quot;Is all of this true?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is.&quot; He affirmed. Each and every word was true, and while Eric thought it was silly that people were so shallow -- he loved Ethan just as much with a tiny cock -- he had a good understanding that the perceptions of most weren&#39;t so forgiving. The majority seemed to take &#39;bigger is better&#39; as the gospel, without any other consideration. &quot;So I want to give you that -- for real! -- but there&#39;s a catch. At the same time ... your brother ... well, he&#39;s going to be smaller too, and he won&#39;t be happy about it, but that won&#39;t matter. I&#39;m going to make sure of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Smaller? Are you s-sure he&#39;ll back off?&quot; There was a tremble in his voice. &quot;I don&#39;t want to know what he&#39;ll do if he comes after me again. I don&#39;t think I can take it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise you, he won&#39;t do ANYTHING to you. I&#39;d pinky swear if I was there in person.&quot; Eric was as insistent and assertive as he could make his voice. &quot;I&#39;ll take care of him.&quot; He changed his tone again, sounding as official as possible. &quot;All you need to think about is this question: do you, Brandon Montgomery, want a larger penis?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah,&quot; Brandon murmured, an undercurrent of excitement and the first hints of actual confidence beginning to creep into his voice, &quot;I think that ... I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
She was scrolling through her newsfeed when a video call request came through, taking her a little by surprise. Seeing Ethan&#39;s name was even something of a shock, as he wasn&#39;t very active on the platform at all, so naturally she answered it.<br />
<br />
Only, it wasn&#39;t Ethan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oops!&quot; He said. &quot;I hit video instead of voice, I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m just borrowing his phone while he&#39;s studying.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; Haylee told him, and she got a good look at what could only be the younger brother. She&#39;d seen him just once before and not up close, but like this, the resemblance was strong, as was the quality of their Latino genes. &quot;Oh my! You&#39;re quite the cutie, huh? You must be Eric. You really do take after Ethan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, thanks.&quot; Eric blushed, not used to such a blatant compliment, and especially not from a girl Haylee&#39;s age. She was attractive, and mature, and his eleven-year old brain generated a quick burst of happiness at the positive female attention. &quot;I hope I end up like him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He is a catch.&quot; She agreed. &quot;What you did for him and Brandon Montgomery today was a really good deed, too. Greg sent me the details of how it went down, and I&#39;m happy I could participate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s a problem though.&quot; He frowned. &quot;Jared ignored what we told him once he got home.&quot;<br />
<br />
From there, Eric went on to give her a brief rundown of what Brandon had endured.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?!&quot; She hissed a pissed-off reply when he finished telling her. &quot;Did that piece of shit really treat his own brother like THAT? Especially after you told him not to literally three hours ago!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Eric nodded grimly, &quot;and he thinks I won&#39;t have the balls to do anything about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric, fuck whatever he thinks. Let me help you, and we&#39;ll teach him a lesson he&#39;ll never forget.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s why I came to you. Greg was useful, but, um, you&#39;re better at this. Plus, Jared likes you, right? Ethan shares just about everything with me, and he&#39;s told me about stuff you guys did before.&quot; He paused a second. &quot;Uh, sorry if that sounds gross or it&#39;s too private or anything like that, but what I&#39;m saying is ... you know how to deal with guys and sex stuff. I don&#39;t mean that in a bad way. You&#39;re smart, and you&#39;re pretty, and I bet you can totally make this really difficult for Jared.&quot;<br />
<br />
Haylee&#39;s mouth dropped open in surprise, and she began to giggle. Why was an eleven-year old more unintentionally flirtatious and awkwardly charming than so many boys her age? &quot;There&#39;s more to you than I thought! You really ARE Ethan&#39;s brother, aren&#39;t you?&quot; At that, Eric flushed red again, and she went on. &quot;You&#39;ve probably learned too much about my love life from him, but turnabout is fair play -- so, just between us, since I know for a fact you&#39;ve got some experience with it -- is being hung like a horse as much fun as it seems?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Eric&#39;s reply came out in a mumble, and he went even redder than before, averting his eyes bashfully and trying to keep the silly smile off his face. Despite the fact that his self-confidence had skyrocketed in recent days, it seemed Haylee could read him like a book, and knew just what to say. Combined with the fact she was aware of the swapping and that she wasn&#39;t treating him as if he were a child or a freak, and Eric felt like he was developing an instant puppy-dog crush. &quot;It IS awesome.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be embarrassed, I bet for sure it really is that good! I&#39;d be happy if I got to put that thing to work too.&quot; She winked and then her smile broadened. &quot;Honestly, you are SO adorable! I just know you&#39;re gonna be a ladykiller when you&#39;re older. Or a boykiller, maybe, if you&#39;re anything like Ethan.&quot; Haylee sighed wistfully. &quot;Enough about that though. What did you have in mind for round two?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, I was thinking he needs to be swapped for longer this time, and in some way that&#39;s really memorable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#39;re talking about just a couple of months, it won&#39;t be enough.&quot; Haylee shook her head. &quot;You can&#39;t cure that level of rotten. You need to make sure his punishment sticks, or he&#39;ll never learn a damn thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I understand that now. I&#39;m thinking it has to be less ... temporary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, cutie-pie, you have a dark side for a sixth grader. I like you.&quot; Her eyes glinted, and she bit her lip provocatively. &quot;Are you suggesting what I think you are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am,&quot; He smiled an impish smile, pleased by her praise and the casual introduction of a nickname, &quot;and I have some ideas how you can make it happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
It was Friday evening, and Jared Montgomery was on his way to a date.<br />
<br />
Well, he thought, as he arrived at her house, it wasn&#39;t going to be a date, but more likely a hookup. Of course, he was hoping she would reach out, but he wasn&#39;t expecting it so soon. He had a text message arrive on Thursday morning from a new number, and with it the question if he was free on Friday evening.<br />
<br />
It so happened that he was, but even otherwise, Jared would have made himself available.<br />
<br />
He was NOT letting this chance go.<br />
<br />
Haylee&#39;s family was comfortably upper middle class, with a big double-storied house. She greeted him at the door, and he followed her inside. She was barefoot, in a fluffy white bathrobe, and she gave him a once over as they walked through the hall to the stairwell, before turning to go upstairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re looking sharp.&quot; Her ass swayed gently as she ascended in front of him, and it was difficult not to stare. &quot;Trying to impress?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh, this?&quot; He knew he cleaned up nicely -- button-up shirt, dress jeans, carefully spiked hair, and his favourite bodyspray -- but it was a relief to hear her say so. He didn&#39;t want her having any second thoughts. &quot;It&#39;s nothing. Just me being me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Feel free to be yourself all you like.&quot; She took his hand  at the top of the stairs and led him through into her room. &quot;It&#39;s just us here, nobody else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are your parents?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Out.&quot; She waved her hand dismissively. &quot;They&#39;re social butterflies on the weekend, and my brother is a frat-boy drunkard. I could be finding some way to get underage-blasted too, but I don&#39;t care about that shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her room was medium sized but tidy, with a dresser, wardrobe, desk and laptop, and a window overlooking the yard. A modest four-poster bed took up the centre of the wall opposite the window. She plopped down onto it, and shot him a look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are we talking about my family though? I hope you know the reason I invited you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I, uh, thought you-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sex. Obviously.&quot; She grabbed his hand again, interrupting, and pulled him so he stumbled forward and onto the bed too. &quot;It&#39;s not like we&#39;re dating, though if you&#39;re good enough?&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, she pushed him down onto his back, then sat back up on her knees. Carefully, she pullled the bathrobe open then off her shoulders, shimmying out of it.<br />
<br />
Jared&#39;s eyes nearly bugged out of his head.<br />
<br />
She was wearing skimpy red lingerie and nothing else; a lace bra and panties that left very little to the imagination. Athletic and fit, Haylee also had proportions that were the icing on the cake, with her rear and breasts on the larger side of average. In her current posture, she seemed to tower over him like some kind of seductive goddess, all glowing skin and smooth curves, and while he stared slackjawed, she tilted her head and raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you going to gawk, or are you going to lose your clothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t need to ask twice. In moments, he was stripping off the outer layers until he was in nothing but his boxers. While he was doing that, she retrieved a couple of things from her dresser, and then was back on the bed next to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;No more clothes. See?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy. You can follow instructions.&quot; Haylee smirked, then held up what was in her hand. It was a pair of black silk handties and a blindfold. &quot;Up for some fun? I&#39;ll make it ... a unique experience for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
His hesitation was only momentary, before he was nodding, his look nervously breathless.<br />
<br />
Wherever this was heading, it was going to be amazing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great.&quot; She climbed over him, pulling his arms up so she could bind them to the bed rail. He could feel the softness of the material touching his chest and shoulder as she leaned close, and the silky smoothness of her breasts and thighs brushing him while she secured his wrists was so tantalising. He was swelling with arousal when she sat back, his cock anticipating the most exciting time ever, and he had never wanted anything so much as for her to remove her top. He wanted desperately to lick and suck her perfect tits, to bury his face in them, but she was already pulling the strip of fabric over his eyes and fastening it behind his head. Then she was whispering in his ear, and the low sensual sound of her voice sent erotic shivers right down his spine. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, boytoy, I&#39;ll let you play with them all you want. Right after we get your big guy as big as he can go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her lips touched his, a brief soft kiss that made him stiffen faster. &quot;Perhaps I should give him a kiss too? What do you say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah.&quot; He croaked. &quot;You should do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
She was moving off him again, her fingers sliding over his chest, down his stomach, and she pulled the waistband, his boxers travelling down his legs as they were removed. His excitement was extreme, his heart beating rapidly, and finally he felt it -- the wet warmth of her mouth as it descended down his cock.<br />
<br />
Oh, fuck yes!<br />
<br />
It felt incredible, slippery and soft and slick, and he exhaled in pure pleasure. It had to be his personal record, his dick longer and thicker and harder than it had ever been before. He was getting the BEST head from a hot bitch, and soon he would be making her squeal while he banged her. Oh yeah, she&#39;d be begging for it after this taste, he thought -- he bit his lip, a grunt escaping him at the rising-falling heat, the continued suction -- begging for the D, ready to blow him whenever he wanted, ready to fuck whenever he pleased.<br />
<br />
He was so caught up in what was about to happen that he barely noticed, through the stimulation and horny feelings, a slight tingle in his fully engorged crotch.<br />
<br />
But, he did notice something else.<br />
<br />
Her lips and her tongue began to feel unusually full and plump, almost like they were ... getting larger? No, that wasn&#39;t quite true, because she was actually moving less, but still covering all of him more easily at the same time. It had to be more like ... he was smaller? But that couldn&#39;t be accurate, could it? There wasn&#39;t any time to think about why either, because then, despite everything that was going on, his erection began to wilt.<br />
<br />
What ... was going on?!<br />
<br />
&quot;Take off the blindfold!&quot; He tried to repress the rising sense of confusion and panic. &quot;Please!&quot;<br />
<br />
She complied without question, and with a quick tug, it came away and he could see again.<br />
<br />
The sight before him was horrifying.<br />
<br />
Haylee, her hands gripping his thighs, gazing down at his freshly hairless groin, where there lay a tiny thin penis and a pair of tight juvenile balls.<br />
<br />
No ... this- ... it couldn&#39;t be happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, your little guy is just cold. He needs some encouragement to warm up.&quot; She leaned down and took him right back into her mouth. Jared felt, with complete dismay, every last bit of her lips engulfing him, and with agonising clarity understood the limits of his new size down to the last millimetre. He HAD to stop this, but simultaneously, he HAD to regain his erection, to salvage his masculine ego -- that if he could only do that he would shatter this weird cursed moment in time, and somehow restore everything to normal. He was still so turned on that he couldn&#39;t stand it, and he wanted nothing more than to cum, just as his teenage libido desired ... but ... he was soft.<br />
<br />
Soft, small, and unable to perform.<br />
<br />
And ... Haylee just kept going.<br />
<br />
It felt REALLY good, but also completely horrendous.<br />
<br />
He whimpered and moaned, in a mix of embarrassment and enjoyment, while he watched this sexy girl suck his limp little-boy cock, doing her best to coax even the slightest reaction out of him.<br />
<br />
He wanted this to stop, but ... he also didn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
She pulled off for a second, with a puzzled look, her face still very close to his crotch, the warmth of her breath on his sensitive shrunken crotch somehow both the best and worst thing ever. &quot;It&#39;s not working. I want to see him all grown up.&quot; She glanced up and they locked gazes for a moment, her bedroom eyes taunting him, and her tongue flicked out across his balls. Jared moaned involuntarily, wanting her to lick them properly, suck them until they ballooned in her mouth to the size they were MEANT to be, whilst also wanting her to just ... stop. &quot;But, I guess he&#39;s going to stay a little boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
She sat up properly, and he tried to protest, his voice coming out hoarse and in stop-start mumbles.<br />
<br />
&quot;I- ... I, um- ... it&#39;s not normally like this. Something&#39;s wrong. I&#39;m bigger, I-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; She interrupted him firmly, giving a sweet smile, waving the protestations away. &quot;You&#39;re cute just the way you are.&quot; The word &#39;cute&#39; came out in the distinctly nauseating tone people used when talking about children or pets, and not the sexy type of cute. She ran a finger along his hopelessly flaccid cock, tickling it, and he found himself releasing yet another involuntary moan, unable to help the sound. &quot;Though, I do need a big boy to play with, a hard boy, and ... well ... you aren&#39;t either of those things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I am!&quot; He said. &quot;This isn&#39;t really-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not.&quot; She told him. &quot;You&#39;re little, you&#39;re soft, and I think that suits you. In fact, I think you&#39;re gonna stay this way ... for good.&quot;<br />
<br />
For good?<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when it dawned on him.<br />
<br />
This wasn&#39;t a threat of a day or two, or weeks, or even a month.<br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t getting out of this.<br />
<br />
Reaching to her side, Haylee picked up her phone, and after a couple of finger taps, pointed it at him.<br />
<br />
With the video recording, she made to scan his naked body from head to feet, including his face frozen into a mask of humiliated dread -- but most of all, his crotch.<br />
<br />
His tiny, immature, floppy, little cock and balls, on shameful display, in high-definition.<br />
<br />
With another button press, she was finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a souvenir to remember our encounter.&quot; She flashed another sweet smile, and Jared began to understand, through the fog of his nightmare, that she was a part of the punishment too, and that none of this was coincidence. Then the smile vanished, and the act dropped entirely. &quot;See, Ethan&#39;s really forgiving, and even Greg gave you a second chance, but me? Eric came to me for results, and I won&#39;t disappoint. The very second you so much as breathe the wrong way towards your little brother -- or anybody else I give a fuck about -- then I&#39;ll drop this shit all over social media faster than you can blink. So, if you wanna try me ... then fucking try me.&quot;<br />
<br />
He was pale, and he couldn&#39;t think of anything to say in reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t think so. Let&#39;s keep this our little secret.&quot; She emphasised the word &#39;little&#39;, and then was coolly pulling the handties from the rail, allowing his arms free. So shocked that he could hardly react at all, she was tossing him his pants and shirt. &quot;Better cover up if you want to keep it that way. You know where the exit is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pulling on his clothes as fast as he could, ready to escape from this hell, he was barely dressed and already slinking his way out of her room, as white as a ghost.<br />
<br />
She winked as he went by, a terrifyingly alluring succubus in red lingerie, and grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;See you in school, Casanova.&quot;</p>
