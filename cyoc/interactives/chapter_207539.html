<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I kept my distance from the guards as they carried the boy straight to the metal building. I stayed out of sight, although I doubt they were really looking out for me. The boy’s cock had grown larger than I had ever seen one. It was the kind of size you’d only heard of as a low-level employee at GTT. It was big enough to tickle the boy’s chin until-<br />
<br />
“Oh God, it’s happening again! FUCK!”<br />
<br />
Even from a distance I could see his member grow, sliding further up his body and spilling further out his shirt. It loomed over his head, with pre-cum dripping down onto his face. It was thicker than his waist, and his balls were fighting to break free from his dungarees. <br />
<br />
The men carrying him almost tripped when it grew, the new weight toppling them slightly to one side. Despite all of that they were running faster than me. Jimbo’s eyes were fixed on the building. He looked determined, or rather that determination was shrouding something else.<br />
<br />
To be honest, he looked scared.<br />
<br />
They reached the edge of the woods of which the building dwelled in, taking a trodden path further in. I followed quietly, using the tree-trunks as cover. Through the leaves and limp branches I gazed in awe at the building, which stood proud above all.<br />
<br />
It was just as unnerving up close as it was from afar. Some part of me was saying to turn and run, join Dallan over the wall and onward to freedom. But I needed to know if this was the answer to all of it. I had to know!<br />
<br />
The men and the boy came to a clearing just before the doors to the building. Hiding behind an overturned root I could see it in its complete form. It looked like a cathedral, but metallic and rusty. The giant window of white-stained glass was much more breathtaking than before. I could easily make out the pattern.<br />
<br />
A figure, or rather a man stood proudly in the centre. Around him were three different shapes depicting a smaller man, a bunch of flowers, and what looked like some sort of gemstone. They seemed to converge around the figure as if they were adding to…no, building him. The style of the pattern looked almost identical to that of the painting I saw in the dining room. <br />
<br />
That was when I realised the glass itself wasn’t white. It was clear, but had fogged up from the inside. It looked like a sauna in there!<br />
<br />
Jimbo dropped the boy in the middle of the clearing and ran up to the door, pounding it as hard as he could. The doors themselves were huge, and didn’t budge an inch. The thud of his closed fist on metal recreated throughout the forest. The man holding the boy’s legs also dropped them, but couldn’t look away from the giant cock before him. I learned later the man’s name was Manny. Jimbo was better at hiding his fear.<br />
<br />
“What do we do?!” Manny yelled.<br />
<br />
“Just keep an eye on him,” Jimbo called back, “we need to get him with the others before he starts Emanating.”<br />
<br />
‘Emanating? Sounds ominous,’ I thought.<br />
<br />
As Jimbo pounded on the door again the boy cried out. Not in pain or pleasure, but rather desperation. He held out his hand to Manny, who looked back with great uncertainty.<br />
<br />
“Please, get me out of this. It’s…too tight,” the boy pleaded, out of breath.<br />
<br />
He placed a hand on one of his balls as if soothing them under the tightness of the fabric. Manny looked back to Jimbo.<br />
<br />
“What do I do?” he called out.<br />
<br />
Just as he did the doors creaked open, and a warm yellow glow flowed from the opening. The ground by the doors was shrouded in a layer of steam, as a figure emerged. I had to relocate myself, weaving through the trees, to get a good look of who was standing by the door. A very young man, aged around 22 or 23, clad in a white lab coat, black trousers, and a gas mask. He was holding something behind his back. The gas mask was a thick sheet of clear glass, and his face was on full display. He was beautiful, with not one imperfection anywhere I could see. The steam inside had moistened his jet black hair. Jimbo stood taller than him. The pair started talking. Their voices were too quiet for me to make out, but as I tried to sneak closer my attention turned to the boy who was moaning aloud again.<br />
<br />
“It’s…not…stopping! Getting…so…BIG!!”<br />
<br />
And once again his cock ballooned. It was bigger than the rest of his body almost twice over! The tip reached way beyond his head and was so thick he couldn’t reach all the way around the shaft if he tried. He hugged it, lost in a sea of pleasures. But he suddenly started tugging at his dungarees, yelping in pain.<br />
<br />
“Too tight! PLEASE!”<br />
<br />
Manny glanced quickly between the boy and Jimbo, before grunting and reaching for the boy’s dungarees. He grabbed the straps and tore the entire outfit in half. His feat of strength was quite the spectacle, and I was surprised how his own tight uniform was still in-tact despite his bulging arms flexing monstrously. As the fabric split, the boy’s huge balls practically leaped out. Manny had to take a step back as to avoid being hit by them. I couldn’t help but gasp aloud. They were bigger than the boy! His genitalia was now most of him!<br />
<br />
As Manny made light work of the boy’s shirt, the boy writhed about in relief, unable to stand up properly due to the tremendous weight of his cock on top of him. His completely naked body was getting soaked in the endless stream of his seed.<br />
<br />
“Thank you! Thankyouthankyouthankyou!” he cried out enthusiastically. <br />
<br />
I eventually got within earshot of Jimbo and the man in the labcoat. The man glanced at the boy and sighed.<br />
<br />
“Well we can’t turn back time, what’s done is done. All we can do now is get him in and hooked up. Here.”<br />
<br />
From behind his back he revealed a second gas mask and a dart gun. He handed the mask to Jimbo.<br />
<br />
“What about Manny?”<br />
“What about him?” the man replied, slotting a dart with crimson red feathers into the barrel, “someone needs to take the fall for this fuck-up or it’s our heads.”<br />
<br />
Jimbo didn’t say anything, only watched. They both did. Waiting. Manny saw them staring and began to walk over to them, until he felt the boy grab his hand.<br />
<br />
“No, please stay…” the boy sounded tired, almost exhausted from the relentless torrents of pleasure spiralling in his mind.<br />
<br />
“No. Let go,” Manny said sternly.<br />
<br />
“But I need you! I…oh I feel…ooooh…different…”<br />
<br />
The boy started to shiver, moaning as if someone was scratching an itch that had pestered him for years. Then, as if his body heat had risen drastically, steam began emanating from him. The steam was thick, but moved fast. Manny went to break free from the boy’s grasp but it was too late. He took in a deep huff of steam, and in a flash he stood there motionless for a few seconds, as if he was daydreaming. I watched with a close eye as his bulge began to come alive.<br />
<br />
“Wow…that smells…good,” he mumbled.<br />
<br />
His member hardened within just a few seconds. He snapped back into reality and sent his hands zooming towards his cock, reaching into his trousers and unfastening them open, letting them fall to his ankles. It was as big as Jimbo’s. With no hesitation, he clasped his hands around his manhood and started jerking off, panting heavily like his life depended on it. His and the boy’s moans swirled into a cacophony of pleasure, filling the forest and my ears. I wanted to join them. So badly. Remember the mission.<br />
<br />
The man reached into his labcoat and tilted his head towards a walkie-talkie. <br />
<br />
“Transporters, here. Now.”<br />
<br />
I could faintly hear approaching footsteps, akin to an army charging in unison, getting louder and louder. From the building, dashing past the pair by the doors were about 5 men covered from head-to-toe in white hazmat suits reminiscent of cheesy 60s sci-fi movies. They were about a foot taller than Jimbo, and way more jacked. Their bulges bounced, as did their pecs, in those skintight outfits. The man called after them as they ran towards Manny and the boy.<br />
<br />
“Get the boy in asap, before he gets too big to fit through the goddamn door!”<br />
<br />
The men pushed Manny aside, and he fell to the ground. He didn’t seem to notice, or care, as he curled his body on the floor, still pumping his cock mercilessly. I was so horny I had to get a better look, leaning forward on a branch to watch Manny too lost in his pleasures to see the men collectively lift the boy and his overgrown genitalia. The boy rather enjoyed being surrounded by such huge men, as he reached for the wall of ripped torsos and abs before him. They all ran with the boy back to the building. Jimbo and the man watched on as they entered, and the last of the boy’s moans could be heard before he was completely out of sight. <br />
<br />
I never learnt his name.<br />
<br />
Manny was the only thing left in the clearing. He laid on his back and thrusted his hips and cock into his hands. A spurt of cum launched upwards and splashed his chest, staining his uniform. Jimbo and the man in the lab coat approached him, watching almost pitifully at the display.<br />
<br />
“You’ll be alright,” the man said to Jimbo, “it was either you or him. Well, that’s for the Master to decide anyway.”<br />
<br />
He aimed the dart gun at Manny and fired, sending the dart into the man’s neck. After a few moments, Manny dozed off, his rock-hard member still throbbing. The man sighed, loading another dart into the barrel.<br />
<br />
“We’re gonna run out of Guards at this rate. We’re already stretched thin as it is, what with the Miner’s revolt and all that—“<br />
<br />
SNAP!<br />
<br />
The branch I was leaning on snapped off, hitting the ground with a loud thud. I bent down to try and catch it, but the sound made me freeze in fear. I was out in the open. I looked back up to see both Jimbo and the man had disappeared. My heart beat quickly and my breathing stopped. I turned to run in the opposite direction but—<br />
<br />
“There you are, Peeping Tom.”<br />
<br />
They were standing right behind me. I gulped as the man pointed the dart gun at me and fired. I felt a sting in my shoulder, as my body felt limp and my eyes felt heavy. The last I remember was falling into Jimbo’s arms, being lifted off the ground, and thinking, <br />
<br />
‘I’m fucked.’</p>
