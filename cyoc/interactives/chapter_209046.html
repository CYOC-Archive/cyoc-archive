<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark did his best to catch his breath. Here he was, hiding in the back of his frat house&#39;s pantry, stroking a massive goat cock. This whole situation seemed impossible...! Yet all signs pointed to the fact that somehow, he had actually become the mythical creature he was dressed up as. And to top it all off, just the mere sight of him seemed to drive his house mates go absolutely wild with lust.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baah, so... what am I going to do about you?&quot; He muttered under his breath. His excitement didn&#39;t seem to be going down any time soon, not that he was exactly helping in that matter. Maybe he could just rub one out real quick before escaping... The thought felt a little foreign in his head, but he had to admit the idea made his tail wag. Mark licked his lips, continuing to try and coax the full length of his manhood out of his sheath. &quot;Jeez, you&#39;ve gotta be at least ten inches long...&quot; He muttered, trying to support all the weight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;d say a foot easily.&quot; Mark&#39;s eyes shot up. Peter was standing by the door, a conspiratorial grin on his face. &quot;Shhh...!&quot; The cosplay cowboy quickly closed the door behind him, &quot;No one else knows I&#39;m here...! They&#39;re all out looking for you outside.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Baah...! Pan&#39;s grace Peter, don&#39;t sneak up on people like that!&quot; Mark did his best to keep his voice down, but it was difficult when he kept letting bleats slip out. &quot;Look, I can explain, I-&quot; Mark looked down at his bobbing cock self-consciously.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to!&quot; Peter grinned, stepping forward, &quot;A hot guy like you, of course you&#39;d want to slip out for some fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What!? No! I-&quot; Mark tilted his head, &quot;Peter, are you feeling alright?&quot; He laughed nervously, &quot;I snuck out because uh, I think there&#39;s something&#39;s wrong with my satyr costume?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that what you are?&quot; The pledge stood eagerly in front of Mark, &quot;Do you mind if I lend you a hand?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark nodded, watching Peter get down onto his knees, &quot;Uh, sure? There should be a seam around my waist or something, but I can&#39;t find any- Baah!&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter grinned, sliding both of his hands around Mark&#39;s enormous cock. His fingers expertly teased the throbbing shaft.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh! You... Mhmm, you want to help me there?&quot; Mark gulped, &quot;Are you sure that&#39;s a good idea I-&quot; He stifled a moan, &quot;Oh baaaaah... Yeah Pete, knock yourself out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter started to move his hands up and down, &quot;Mhmm, you like that?&quot; The pledge continued to have that goofy, lust-filled look on his face. &quot;You&#39;ve got such a nice cock Mark.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark rocked his hips a bit against Peter&#39;s hand, &quot;Baah! I- Are you serious?&quot; He shifted his stance on the floor, trying to brace himself. All it mostly did was cause his hooves to clatter a bit more. &quot;Come on man, try and think straight for a moment... Are you even gay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter laughed, &quot;Of course I&#39;m serious! You look incredible!&quot; He leaned forward, using his tongue to trace the tip of Mark&#39;s cock. &quot;Even if you&#39;re head&#39;s kinda weird and flat.&quot; He grinned, watching Mark squirm underneath his grasp. That last stunt trigger a string of excitable bleats that just seemed to get Peter more eager. Peter watched enraptured as a trickle of pre start to dribble down his companion&#39;s shaft more consistently now. He leaned forward to lap some up, &quot;Girl&#39;s are great and all, but I&#39;d never seen a satyr before! I&#39;m seriously jealous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Baah!&quot; Mark let out another lusty bleat. They were so going to get caught. &quot;Woah, easy...!&quot; He felt his hips rock reflexively against his friend&#39;s increasingly frequent licks. &quot;Jealous of my cock or my costume?&quot; Mark laughed softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mhmm, looks like I got the waterworks going.&quot; The human grinned, sliding his hands over Mark&#39;s shaft a bit more vigorously, getting everything nice and glistening. &quot;Both? I wouldn&#39;t mind having one of these.&quot; He looked up, giving Mark an incredulous look, &quot;You seriously expect me to believe this is a costume satyr-boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark felt his legs buckle. He just had to explain to his friend what was going on. There was this costume shop and-<br />
<br />
&quot;Baah, Pete...&quot; Was all he managed to get out. Mark put his hands on the human&#39;s shoulders, feeling his pleasure starting to build.<br />
<br />
&quot;Less talking more sucking, got it.&quot; Peter grinned. He lowered himself down a bit further down, trying to slide his tongue along the entire length of Mark&#39;s glistening shaft. He was a bit closer to the satyr now though, so the brim of his cowboy hat bumped up against Mark&#39;s arms, and bounced off harmlessly onto the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mhmm, sorry, let me-&quot; Mark tried to reach down, but Peter&#39;s hat was far out of reach. Even if it wasn&#39;t, something had caught Mark&#39;s attention in the mean time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave it.&quot; Peter grinned, &quot;One less thing to get in the way.&quot; Framing the lusty human&#39;s head were two pointed ears, and a pair of short white horns.<br />
<br />
&quot;I uh...&quot; Mark stared openly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine! My costume sucks anyways!&quot; Peter said, forgetting to keep his voice down. &quot;I just threw together some random junk. These &#39;chaps&#39; are just my khakis.&quot; He grumbled, looking down at his pants. &quot;Is it just me or is it kind of stuffy in here?&quot; He started to loosen his belt while still trying to give Mark the appropriate amount of attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh...! Easy there!&quot; Mark clopped loudly, stepping forward as Peter yanked on his cock. &quot;Pete, your uh-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; The pledge kicked off his shoes and socks before forcefully tugging down his pants and boxers. &quot;Naked?&quot; His own cock sprang to life, bobbing in the open air, &quot;So are you Mr. Satyr!&quot; Peter&#39;s manhood was hard as a rock, despite the lack of attention that had been given to it thus far.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I uh...&quot; Mark stammered, watching Peter crawl on the floor. He grabbed onto his shirt, tugging it up over his head with the zealousness of a nude beach regular.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, what&#39;s the matter?&quot; He tossed his clothes aside, scurrying back up to Mark. &quot;I&#39;m just making myself comfortable.&quot; He licked his lips, reaching for Mark&#39;s manhood again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Peter, you&#39;ve got horns...!&quot; Mark finally managed to bleat it out, reaching up to tug on the young man&#39;s new headgear.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what?&quot; Peter blinked, looking up. He brushed Mark&#39;s hands aside, &quot;I&#39;m just horny and- Woah!&quot; His eyes went wide as he felt his horns, &quot;You weren&#39;t kidding...!&quot; He stared up at the satyr, &quot;Did... did you do this...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark gulped, &quot;I don&#39;t know...! I&#39;ve only been a satyr for-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because this is awesome!&quot; Peter scooted forward, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me you could share this with me...!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark immediately felt Peter&#39;s hands back on him. &quot;I didn&#39;t know I could- Baah! Woah, take it easy!&quot; He let out another soft moan as the hu- well, the mostly-human slid his tongue over his manhood again. &quot;Maybe we should stop and think about- Baah!&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter chose that moment to slide his lips fully over the top of Mark&#39;s cock. He sucked passionately, lapping up as much pre as he could. Now that he was looking for it, Mark could see it have an obvious and immediate effect.<br />
<br />
Peter&#39;s hair started to shift into the same scruffy fur that Mark had become intimately familiar with. It began to grow out everywhere on Peter&#39;s body, but most prominently on his legs.<br />
<br />
It was fun getting to watch this process in real time. Mark just put on a costume, but Peter got to enjoy the full experience of becoming a satyr. Mark felt himself staring at Peter&#39;s crotch as the fur started to thicken, forming another sheath. His companion&#39;s cock slid out of it, beginning to darken and lengthen as it became something other than human.<br />
<br />
Peter must have sensed the change. He started to stroke himself off with one hand while still pleasuring Mark. &quot;Mhmm, thank you...!&quot; He mumbled in between sucks of the satyr&#39;s shaft.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baah, you&#39;re welcome Peter. Enjoy it.&quot; Mark found himself bleating. For the first time that evening, he realized how much he was enjoying the situation. It wasn&#39;t just the physical fondling. His friend&#39;s naked figure was turning him on something fierce, and to see him join his ranks was ecstatic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mhmm, I just hope you like hooves.&quot; He grinned, slipping his fingers around one of Peter&#39;s ears. Mark could already feel fur starting to grow out on it.<br />
<br />
Peter&#39;s eyes went wide, but Mark could see a tail curl up excitedly behind him. Also, the sucking didn&#39;t stop.<br />
<br />
Mark felt his body reaching his physical limit. He was awash in pleasure, but at the same time, he felt a different emotion creep in from the back of his mind. He was feeling proud of himself. He&#39;d done good work here with Peter. Soon, Pan would have another satyr eager to spread lust and excess throughout the world.<br />
<br />
Mark felt his legs buckle underneath him. He was so close...! He firmly grabbed onto Peter&#39;s horns, holding the pledge&#39;s head in place as his cock finally climaxed. His manhood twitched and throbbed, showering his fellow satyr in the face with a massive load of cum. Mark felt his voice bellow, and soon Peter was joining in with his own lust-filled bleat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baah... That was... amazing.&quot; Mark panted. &quot;You doin&#39; alright down there?&quot; He held his arm out to help his friend up.<br />
<br />
Peter nodded, &quot;Baah? I think so?&quot; He looked down at himself for a moment before taking Mark&#39;s hand. &quot;This- This is incredible. Seriously, thank you so much!&quot; His ears shot up eagerly. He didn&#39;t seem to mind the fact that there was still cum dripping down his face.<br />
<br />
Peter clopped in place experimentally. He wobbled a bit on his new hooves, but managed to straighten himself out almost immediately. His body seemed to come with all the instincts he needed to put it to good use. &quot;Baah, we&#39;re going to get into so much fun tonight.&quot; He licked his lips, &quot;Come on, I bet we can still sign up for the &#39;costume&#39; contest.&quot; He laughed.<br />
<br />
Mark wagged at the idea of showing himself off to the rest of the frat house, but then his train of thought finally caught up with him. Baah, this was... this was all supposed be a costume. He wasn&#39;t actually some horny beast.<br />
<br />
Right?<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha, why don&#39;t you clean up first?&quot; Mark bent down, offering up Peter&#39;s shirt as a makeshift towel. &quot;Let the lust wear off a bit?&quot; He was honestly hoping his head would clear up a little bit too.<br />
<br />
Peter tilted his head, &quot;Don&#39;t I get a turn?&quot; He teased his sheath a bit, but begrudgingly started to wipe off his face. &quot;I feel fine Mark! Do you?&quot; He wagged, cocking his head at the door, &quot;Come on, let&#39;s go party!&quot;<br />
<br />
The offer was tempting. Mark knew he should be getting back to the costume shop to sort out whatever was going on, but at the same time, it had been fun to let himself get swept up in his satyric instincts for a bit. He could always work things out in the morning, right?</p>
