<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Even without windows, Jenny could tell when the sun began to rise over Moon Lake. Her body immediately began returning to human form and the high levels of lust that had driven her through the night finally subsided. And while she had greatly enjoyed the night with Harry and a strange way loved the bond she felt to him. She wasn&#39;t quite sure how used she really was to being a werefox, but she did love the bond to Harry and how complete it made her feel. The two of them showered, which became a bout of the two of them enjoying each other&#39;s company even more. Once they were dry, both of them began to get dressed again.<br />
<br />
Jenny almost immediately found her reasons for being concerned with being a werefox. Her panties were several sizes too small based on her new butt and hips. She managed to get them up, but they felt tight on her and her butt looked like it was eating the material on the back of her underwear. She&#39;d definitely need to get new underwear, and the jeans that Harry had packed for her didn&#39;t fit much better. That was essentially curse of going from being near stick figured to the voluptuous vixen she now quite literally was. Her jeans had been made to fit someone with far narrower hips and a slightly wider waist. It only made her feel a little bit more uncomfortable, and continued to make the fact that her panties were effectively giving her a wedgie just to fit around her new form. Her shirt didn&#39;t fit too bad, as it wasn&#39;t a tight tee-shirt, but her new breasts changed greatly how the shirt sat on her body. When she was human, the bottom of her shirt would cover the top part of her jeans and one wouldn&#39;t even see the button for her jeans through the material of her shirt. Now, though, her bosom had pushed the shirt outward and the end of the shirt hovered just above the top of her jeans. Jenny was privately sure that Harry had probably been in a rush and picked out what was easy to get to, but was thankful he didn&#39;t pick up anything that was supposed to fit tightly on her before. It also made her wonder how Yvette had even moved in her clothing the previous day, if Yvette was built the way Jenny, herself, was now built.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for a wonderful night, Harry,&quot; Jenny said with a smile to him as he got dressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Harry said somewhat sheepishly, &quot;I&#39;m sorry if I didn&#39;t get anything that&#39;s going to fit you better...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny shrugged and tried to readjust her clothing to get it to fit better, but it didn&#39;t do all that much for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;No you did your best,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;and you actually got clothing that fit the old me a bit more loosely than some of my other clothes...  so this just might be the best my old wardrobe will fit the new me.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then smiled to him, &quot;Which means I&#39;ll get to model a whole new wardrobe for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I look forward to it,&quot; Harry answered and moved to open the door and found that the door&#39;s lock had disengaged.<br />
<br />
To the great surprise of both of them, Akane Tachibana with her grandsons standing guard over her was waiting just outside the door. She looked greatly relieved from how she looked the day before while Yvette was on the loose, and in a way, Jenny thought the Skulk&#39;s leader looked very much like a grandmotherly type figure at present. Harry, having grown up in Moon Lake, bowed immediately to her. Jenny followed Harry&#39;s example shortly after.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, young ones,&quot; Akane said politely, &quot;I trust your night went well? Or as well as it could be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Harry answered, &quot;A new bonded pair looking to join the Skulk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You will be staying in Moon Lake?&quot; Akane asked to Jenny.<br />
<br />
Jenny took Harry&#39;s arm and rested her head on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s my mate&#39;s home,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;and since we will be getting married on Halloween, it will be my home too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane gave a warm and welcoming smile, &quot;Then you have my welcome to the Skulk. Do you presently live on the College or do you have other housing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I live on campus,&quot; Jenny answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I still live at home,&quot; Harry answered, &quot;but my family and I have been looking at a possible apartment to live in when I graduate college... we could move up those plans and move in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane then nodded, &quot;We will wait on assigning your specific den until you&#39;re settled in. And hopefully, you will feel at home with us Jenny Harper.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope so too...&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;but if you&#39;re all like my husband to be... I don&#39;t think there will be a problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We will certainly try to be,&quot; Akane nodded politely to Jenny and her fiance, Harry Jenkins, &quot;in the meantime... it would be my honor to treat you both to breakfast before we will have to attend to other business...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Completing my transformation?&quot; Jenny said nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;As well as whether or not you will be needed for the rogue&#39;s hearing,&quot; Akane nodded, &quot;and I&#39;m afraid we do not have much in the way of time. So we&#39;d best be on our way. Did you drive here, Mr. Jenkins?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot; Harry said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know the Lunar Diner?&quot; Akane asked.<br />
<br />
Harry nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will meet you there,&quot; Akane answered, &quot;and breakfast will be on me... and Ms. Harper, I have been informed that the city has already paid for your medical bills concerning the rogues attack. You will not need to meet with anyone else for your discharging.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The diner proved to be a small and quaint one on the west side of the town&#39;s main street. Jenny thought it might have open surprisingly early but couldn&#39;t really complain as Akane and her grandsons were there to greet her and Harry as they arrived. And they went in and ordered a very hearty breakfast and Akane went over the Skulk&#39;s rules to both of them while they waited. On some level it made sense, as if they wanted to keep themselves secret, transforming in public during the day would be a problem. People would see them, though at the same time, Jenny found herself wondering how Moon Lake truly interacted with the Normals who came to go to college or happened to live in neighboring towns. Did they try to keep weres together in the dorms, or were they entirely for those who had come from outside Moon Lake. She wondered if her roommate was a were or not.<br />
<br />
&quot;The only thing that now will remain will be completing your transformation and putting the rogue&#39;s actions behind you,&quot; Akane then spoke as she looked to Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;She has her trial today?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She has her initial hearing today,&quot; Akane answered, &quot;and you are likely required to be there as a victim in case the prosecution wishes to use you or her first victim as part of any opening statement. Not to mention that by being there, we may be able to get things in order for your transformation to be completed. If the Mayor is not there, Mrs. Twist will be there in her capacity as Town Chancellor. You may be able to get things in order so that your transformation may be completed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry detected some tone of worry in Akane&#39;s voice, which gave him the impression that the Skulk leader still putting on something of a brave face over something. He didn&#39;t like that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there something wrong?&quot; Harry asked, as he set his fork down and gripped Jenny&#39;s free hand and held it as if his love could somehow protect her.<br />
<br />
&quot;We cannot know for sure,&quot; Akane said weakly, &quot;Mostly due to how long Jenny has gone from when she began to transform and when her transformation can be completed... we normally try to make sure that a transformation is completed as quickly as possible. The longer it takes... the greater risk there could be for there to be possible mental troubles that your mate may face...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I could go nuts?&quot; Jenny gasped nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is possible,&quot; Akane said, &quot;the problem is that we really don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve been told that her first victim did well after his transformation was completed, and I would tend to agree from what I saw when I met with him... but his transformation was completed by the time that I met him. And his transformation was completed faster than yours, Ms. Harper... so the point at which those problems could start to happen could be yet to arrive or you could have passed it... we don&#39;t know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny gave a whimper and clutched at Harry.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s why when normals join were society we prefer that it be through a formal ceremony or through wen the normal and were are romantically involved with each other,&quot; Akane continued, &quot;it allows us to make sure that a transformation is completed quickly to avoid those potential consequences that can be serious... The greatest problem on our end is that we don&#39;t know where that point at where those consequences begin and how large the proverbial window is... doing so... wouldn&#39;t be... appropriate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is why the rogue&#39;s actions are considered rogue,&quot; one of Akane&#39;s grandsons spoke, &quot;and the Skulk is deeply sorry that the rogue involved you in her shame.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would there be any way to cure the damage?&quot; Harry asked, clutching Jenny to him and feeling Jenny whimper into his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;If the transformation can be completed?&quot; Akane answered, &quot;Thankfully, yes, though it would require therapy to help the new were overcome the strains of being incomplete for so long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll do whatever I can for Jenny,&quot; Harry spoke firmly, &quot;I love her... I... I love her more than life itself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And your love might very well help,&quot; Akane offered, knowing that it wasn&#39;t much, but it was the best the elderly Skulk leader could offer.</p>
