<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On the early hours of the afternoon Jennifer met another person. It was Jennifer&#39;s landlord who was asking for the hefty sum of two thousand dollars. Jennifer at first had no idea where she had hidden her money as she only had the five hundred dollars at hand. She tried to rely on her memory and with a lucky guess. Jennifer found the rest of the money stored inside a wallet that was stored inside a coffee pot with a tight lid. The landlord didn&#39;t seem to care or ask how Jennifer was getting all that money or why she was living all by herself this young. The landlord left the messy house without leaving a comment or not even thanking Jennifer for the money. It was as if this was business as usual for them.<br />
<br />
Jennifer didn&#39;t know how to feel about her situation but one thing was certain. There was no mother or grandmother coming to save her. She was all by herself living in the dirty trailer home. The day was boring and uneventful as Jennifer&#39;s mind was occupied with two thoughts. Would she be willing to do the same what her mother did for money and how much money she needed for better clothes and cleaning products. Jennifer had went through her wardrobe and it was filled with unwashed and moth-eaten clothes. The only pair of clean clothes she had on was the tank top she always had on her.<br />
<br />
As it started to become more dark. Jennifer received a message to her phone which asked if she was willing to provide her services for seven hundred. Jennifer swallowed a lump of spit down her throat and agreed without thinking too much about it. She needed that money and if there were people willing to pay she was ready to do almost anything at this point.<br />
<br />
Ten minutes later a guy in his mid twenties came knocking on Jennifer&#39;s door and Jennifer greeted the man while her heart thumped loudly. Jennifer wasn&#39;t mentally to just jump in her mother&#39;s shoes even if it meant to get more money. The man didn&#39;t seem to care either for Jennifer&#39;s youthful appearance and was eager to kiss her. Jennifer gave out a professional speech that the man could kiss her but he had to follow her instructions as it was her show.<br />
<br />
The man seemed to agree and both of them walked to the master bedroom. Jennifer had a plan but she wasn&#39;t sure if the man was going to take the bait.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. Here&#39;s what we are going to do. Do you have a girlfriend?&quot; Jennifer asked as the man took of his clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I&#39;m a virgin.&quot; The man replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even better. Let&#39;s play pretend that I am your clueless girlfriend and I only use my hand to pleasure you. Is that okay with you?&quot; Jennifer asked and tried to act confident.<br />
<br />
The man nodded his head and let Jennifer to guide through her idea. Jennifer asked for the man&#39;s name and name gave her a name Mike. Jennifer could tell straight away that it wasn&#39;t his real name but a fake name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mike. I don&#39;t think we should do this.&quot; Jennifer started her sentence as begun to act like an actor for the man. &quot;My mom says that dating older guys like you is wrong and that I might grow up as a slut if we continue this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer. I know that you want to do this so what&#39;s wrong?&quot; The man played along.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m starting to think that you invited me to this motel not to watch movie but you had something else in your mind.&quot; Jennifer continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what would that be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that you are grooming me and this is wrong. You are twice as old as I am. We should stop this before something drastic happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you implying that you don&#39;t love me anymore?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. That&#39;s not it. I love you but I don&#39;t want my mother to find out and get you in trouble. Before we depart I want you to remember that you can contact me anytime. Promise me that you text me and give you something special.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer was too in the character and slowly approached at the man&#39;s penis. She begun to rub it with her hand and fondle the man&#39;s balls with the other. Jennifer tried not to think about what she was doing as this was the only way for her to earn money. She had to do this or she would wake up homeless the next day. The mixture of panic and excitement trigger something inside Jennifer as she was starting to enjoy the constant alert state she was in.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Mike that I can only do this to you. I hope you understand.&quot; Jennifer said to the man.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay Jennifer. Do what you have to do.&quot; The man groaned.<br />
<br />
Jennifer kept pleasuring the man&#39;s junk as it firmly got more bigger. She had dreamed about this moment and now that she was doing it herself. Jennifer finally understood why her mother had so much sex all time. Jennifer was getting way too deep into her character that she was playing that she almost forgot her own worries. She was Jennifer a 18-year-old high school student playing pretend with the man in front of her. Jennifer was starting to justify her own actions by telling herself that what difference it made if she was mentally an adult but physically just a bit smaller. Jennifer wasn&#39;t harming anyone and the man seemed to play nice. What was the harm here. Jennifer was getting mesmerized by the cock and then did the unthinkable. She pushed her head on the man&#39;s penis which made him to unload his balls inside Jennifer&#39;s mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;JENNIFER!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer heard a familiar yell behind her. It was her mother with a baseball bat. The man backed up and covered himself under the blanket. Jennifer in other hand could only stare at her fuming mother who lifted Jennifer by her hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who the fuck are you and what are you doing to me daughter!?&quot; Sylvia yelled as she tapped the bat&#39;s end to the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom!?&quot; Jennifer was grabbed by her hair and thrown o the living room with force.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer stand back! He might have a knife on him.&quot; Sylvia shouted. &quot;Hey! You in the bed! Don&#39;t touch anything! Leave your wallet and other valuables here and I let you go. Don&#39;t you dare to make any stupid moves or I will use this bat to crack your skull like a piñata.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man left the house in a hurry and left his big brown wallet behind him. After some time passed Sylvia looked at Jennifer and the anger turned into a relieved smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank god Jennifer you are okay.&quot; Sylvia lifted her daughter off from the floor and gave her a warm hug. &quot;Did he force you to do it? Are you hurt? Is everything okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer asked from her mother what was going on and why didn&#39;t she answer to her phone. Sylvia replied that she was visiting their grandma and asked from Jennifer if she already forgot that she was going to spend the whole weekend at her place. The reason why she couldn&#39;t answer the phone was simple. Sylvia must have dropped it to the floor accidentally when she left in a hurry. When Jennifer showed the phone she found on the floor to her mother. Sylvia hugged Jennifer even harder and thanked her daughter for finding it. Jennifer had understood her situation wrong and came up with wrong conclusions. Jennifer had no words to explain what type of emotion she was feeling inside her. What was Jennifer next day going to look like tomorrow?</p>
