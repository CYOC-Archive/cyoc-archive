<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>As you walk into the creepy old house, she is ahead of you, but turning back to face you. You see that she has a well polished, silver tray with a white doily and a stack of cookies. The old woman smiled at you, showing her decaying teeth, and you see that a bunch were missing. You cringe inwardly at the ghastly sight of the old woman, trying to remain polite.</br>
<br>You smile back warmly, grab a cookie without saying a word and look it over. You examine the cookie, ensuring that there wasn't something placed inside. The old woman gestures for you to eat up, but you still hesitate.</br>
<br>"Is there something wrong dearie?"</br>
<br>You stutter a bit, slightly nervous. "No... no ma'am. Th... there is nothing wrong."</br>
<br>"I know you think I did something to the cookies." She smiles, this time her lips remained sealed. "Here, I will eat one to show you that they are normal. Besides, I didn't know I was going to have a visitor today, so there was no way that I could have planned ahead or snuck something in upon your arrival. I don't have any family, I have been alone my whole life... well except for my German Shepard Butch."</br>
<br>She grabs a cookie, biting down on a portion, ingesting it slowly as you stand there with the cookie in your hand. When she finished, she made the gesture again, this time you shrug your shoulders. You think to yourself <i>Well what could it hurt? I mean she is right, there was no way there could be anything wrong with the cookie since they were already made and you just got there</i>. Placing the cookie to your mouth, you bite down, taking a chunk in your mouth. The flavor was awesome, nothing like you had ever tasted before. You munch down the rest of the cookie quickly, then grab another, devouring that one even faster. You look at the old lady and smile, while she smiles back.</br>
<br>"Thank you, those were delicious cookies. I have never tasted a cookie like that before and I have been to some really good bakeries. Would you mind if I asked you what kind they are?"</br>
<br>"Not at all deary, they are wolf cookies..."</br>
<br>"Wolf cookies...? That is definitely a strange name. Did you come up with that?"</br>
<br>"Oh no, I found this recipe when I first moved into this house some many years ago. Goodness me, it has been quite a long time. Anyway, it was in a cookbook that was left behind by the last owners. I never could get ahold of them to return it. Then, while looking through the recipes, I came across that one. Even though the name is odd, the ingredients made it sound pretty good, so I gathered them and baked the cookies for the first time, a couple days after I moved in and unpacked my things."</br>
<br>"Hmmm... that sounds pretty interesting. Well... I guess I should get started helping you out."</br>
<br>While they chatted, they had moved into the living room and sat while finishing their conversation. She took a pen to a pad of paper, making a list of things she needed done, but could not do it herself at her age. Knowing that you would be able to go home when you finished, you worked the list speedily. Finishing the list, you call out for the old woman, looking all over the house for her. Thinking that it was odd she was no where to be found, you sit in the living room and rest. All that work made you a bit tired. While you stretched and yawned, you notice another piece of paper with your name on it. Thinking it was another list of things that needed to be done. Opening the paper, you see that it was a note, which read:</br>
<br><i>Dear Helpful Young Man,</i></br>
<br></br>
<br><i>I wanted to thank you for all your help today! I do apologize though as I do not have a way to pay you with any money. It is my guess that you are old enough to live on your own, being in college and all. So, as payment for your help, I am leaving you my house. On the table in front of where you found this note, you will find the deed. Now, I must tell you something about my house I didn't mention earlier. You see the house is filled with magic. It can make your simplest to your wildest desires come true. I know this might be hard for you to fathom at the moment, but in time, you will find the house to be quite enjoyable. Honestly, I have traveled the world without ever leaving this building. Again, whatever you want the house will comply. I also left the rest of the cookies in the kitchen for you. Thank you again for being so kind to an old and ghastly woman as I am. Yours Truly...</i></br>
<br>What you read in the note was remarkable, but you don't really buy into owning that house now. Looking around, you find an envelope with a piece of paper folded perfectly in three parts. Even though it looked old, the paper was still crisp and in almost perfect condition. Opening that piece of paper, you see that she wasn't kidding. On the bottom portion, she signed the form giving the ownership over to the bearer of the document. Shocked, you run to the kitchen and grab another one of those delicious cookies.</br>
<br>Munching a few more down, you wonder if <b>ANYTHING</b> was possible in the house. Taking time to think it over, you decide that you want to do something simple. Suddenly, as the picture formed in your mind, the house disappeared becoming a large forest, at night with a star filled sky, accompanied by a full moon. You realize, just as you pictured it, you were standing in the middle of a large circular clearing with the forest surrounding you. Being awe struck, you remained silent, just looking around. Suddenly, something felt strange about the moon. It felt as if there was power flowing from it and over you. Thinking this was all nonsense, you envision the house how you wanted it when you returned. As that image was completely formed in your mind, the area around you shimmered and brought you back. Shocked once more, the house looked just as you wanted it. Everything was newer, definitely more elegant than any place you ever lived in. The rooms were all exactly the way you wanted them to be.</br>
<br>Thinking back to the moon you saw moments ago, you decide to check out the basement as it was the darkest place in the house. Once downstairs, you pictured just the moon in your mind, being the only light in the windowless room. Like earlier, the area around you shimmered and there was a full moon floating right below the ceiling. Again, you feel the energy coming from it, wondering how an illusion could make you feel that way. Just looking at it, you feel more power flow over and into you. You stare at the moon, curious about what you were feeling, not even noticing...</br></p>
