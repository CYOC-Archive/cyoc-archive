<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite their collective weddings being a big part of the Animalian Christmas Event, the three newly-wedded couples were spending a good amount of time in the privacy of their own homes, namely to consummate their new marriages with vigor. Though it wasn&#39;t just about mating. They were also strengthening the bonds between them.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Brittany yowled wildly as Tom repeatedly slammed into her. She hadn&#39;t expected Tom to be so vigorous as a mate. Not to mention the various interesting positions they had been using. One of the wedding gifts was a translated copy of the Kama Sutra and Tom had been eager to try out several of the routines the ancient text recommended. Currently, Brittany had her legs up, almost reaching her head, while Tom was thrusting into her.<br />
<br />
Finally, with a yowl of his own, Tom emptied his load into her. The two cheetahs panted loudly before Brittany said, &quot;Tom...enough...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought cheetahs were supposed to have a lot of stamina,&quot; teased Tom, though he also sounded pretty tired himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;We reserve that stamina for one big burst of speed,&quot; panted Brittany, &quot;We can&#39;t keep top speed for too long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s fine...&quot; said Tom, pulling out of his new wife and laying beside her. While the pair of them were both double-dosed, they weren&#39;t as bulky as other Animalians. Cheetahs, being built for speed, had a more streamlined, lithe build than the bulkier big cats like lions or tigers. That didn&#39;t mean that Tom and Brittany didn&#39;t have attractively-built bodies, just not as over-endowed as others.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tom, why have you been wanting to do all this...yoga stuff?&quot; asked Brittany, &quot;You&#39;re starting to make me sore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom sighed and said, &quot;I just wanted to enjoy my flexibility again after all that time...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All that time with your ALS?&quot; asked Brittany, &quot;What is that anyways? I never really heard much about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It stands for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,&quot; said Tom, &quot;It&#39;s a really dreadful disease. Your muscles slowly weaken before you lose your use of them. Eventually, you become paralyzed, even your diaphragm. Most people only live about 2 years after the symptoms start showing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brittany shuddered. Cheetahs were built for speed, constantly in motion. The idea of being trapped in a body that was slowly losing its ability to move was nightmarish to her. &quot;Thank God that treatment worked,&quot; she said. She wasn&#39;t absolutely certain if this &#39;God&#39; was involved at all, but from what she heard the humans say, this was an appropriate use of that term.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn&#39;t sure if it would work,&quot; admitted Tom.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Brittany.<br />
<br />
&quot;The really terrifying thing about ALS is that no one knows what the cause is. They don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s really genetic or not. I hoped altering my DNA would have worked, but there was always that chance it&#39;d carry over anyways,&quot; said Tom. He knew of the risk well ahead of time. The scientists at Project Phoenix were well aware that the Animalia virus wouldn&#39;t help. Tom had been the first ALS victim seeking treatment so no one was sure the healing power of the virus would work. Now that its success was proven, it would doubtlessly draw hundreds of people seeking to cure their ALS.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s never gonna happen,&quot; said Brittany, &quot;You&#39;re my mate now and you&#39;ll be with me many long years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I couldn&#39;t ask for more,&quot; said Tom before softly kissing her.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Clara&#39;s heat cycle was in full effect. She wasn&#39;t planning to stop mating with Richard until she was pregnant. Though that didn&#39;t mean she was always rutting 24/7. After all, all that effort burned up a lot of energy and Clara needed to make sure that her mate had enough fuel in him.<br />
<br />
Richard was dozing on their shared bed when he heard footsteps approaching. His heightened hearing was still something he was getting used to. He opened his eyes to see Clara saunter in with a tray piled with bacon, sausages, fried eggs, and a few slices of toast. The delicious aroma was very enticing to Richard, almost as much as his new wife. But that wasn&#39;t the only thing to catch his interest. Right now, the only think his wife was wearing was a frilly white apron that did little to cover her sizeable breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Plenty of protein for a young strong puma,&quot; she purred, putting the tray next to Richard.<br />
<br />
Richard raised an eyebrow and asked, &quot;Do you treat all your mates like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;None of them got uplifted,&quot; said Clara with a shrug.<br />
<br />
&quot;None of them? How many did you have?&quot; asked Richard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite a few. Pumas aren&#39;t monogamous, at least wild ones aren&#39;t,&quot; said Clara, &quot;Once the male has planted his seed, he leaves the female to do the raising all on her own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you can count on me not to do that,&quot; said Richard, &quot;I&#39;m still wondering about the apron. It doesn&#39;t seem like something the Mayor of Animalia would do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clara gave a weary sigh and said, &quot;You have no idea how much of a burden that job is. I mean, I do love Animalia and I am trying to do what&#39;s best for everyone. And even though I&#39;m the best qualified to lead, it&#39;s still so stressful. Having to arrange all of these events, showing the humans we mean well, all this worry about what the new government might do with us... I just...need something to let the stress out. Something where I don&#39;t have to be the respected leader of Animalia in my own home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heavy is the head that wears the crown,&quot; quoted Richard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t that the truth?&quot; said Clara, &quot;So eat up and let&#39;s get back to work. I want to have kits in my womb before the year ends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fortunately for you, I can multitask,&quot; said Richard, getting out of bed. He grabbed a handful of bacon and put it in his mouth before pushing Clara against the bed, forcing to lean over it. As he suspected, Clara was wearing nothing beneath the apron so from the back, her bare ass was visible for all to see. He grasped her hips with his hands while he guided his dick into her pussy. Clara moaned which was muffled when Richard put a sausage in her mouth. &quot;You&#39;re gonna need protean too,&quot; he said as he started their familiar rhythm. If Clara wanted cubs so badly, he was more than happy to oblige her.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Martha posed in front of the full-length mirror, clothed in nothing but her fur. It was still hard to believe that sexy vixen looking back at her was herself. Before, she tried to avoid her reflection as much as possible, not wanting to look at the round doughy woman she was. Posing like that before would have only made her look pitiable. But as she flexed, she knew she was a turn-on for any hot-blooded man. Her trim waist was thinner than she could have imagined and her hips were just the right width. Her ass, which had been large enough to take up two seats, was still round, but it was a compact sort of plushness, the sexy kind of bubble butt. Her breasts hadn&#39;t changed a lot in size as quite a lot of fat tissue was stored there. As a human, her breasts had been flabby, unimpressive, barely anything more than another roll of fat. But as a vixen, they were firm and bouncy.<br />
<br />
Martha&#39;s ear twitched as she heard the sound of her husband approaching. She turned to see Robbie, currently wearing a dressing gown. &quot;Are you planning on becoming a model?&quot; he teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;I actually wouldn&#39;t mind that,&quot; said Martha, &quot;I mean, before, no one would have wanted to look at me. But now I could be on a magazine cover.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you want, I&#39;ll support you,&quot; said Robbie.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did I do to deserve a nice young man like you?&quot; asked Martha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your charming personality,&quot; said Robbie, &quot;I&#39;m just glad you were willing to give me a chance with your conversion. I doubt you would have found me attractive before I was uplifted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you were a handsome fox,&quot; said Martha, swishing her tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were probably have been more likely to call me &#39;cute&#39; than handsome,&quot; said Robbie, &quot;I was only a kit before Clara led me to the river.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what?&quot; asked Martha, &quot;How old are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, by fox standards, I was pretty young,&quot; said Robbie, &quot;I was just a kid when I got my first dose but then Clara gave me my second dose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So...does this mean I&#39;ve been robbing the cradle?&quot; asked Martha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; said Robbie, &quot;As far as the government is concerned, I&#39;m a legal adult. I passed my GED exam pretty easily. I hope you don&#39;t mind, but mates do need to be honest with each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The double-dosing means we&#39;re the same age now, right?&quot; asked Martha.<br />
<br />
&quot;More or less,&quot; said Robbie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if you can love me even as a behemoth, I think I can love you for being younger than you look,&quot; said Martha.<br />
<br />
&quot;How does it feel to lose all that weight at once?&quot; asked Robbie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty weird,&quot; said Martha, &quot;Have you ever seen &#39;The Nutty Professor&#39; with Eddie Murphy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven&#39;t seen a lot of movies,&quot; admitted Robbie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll have to show you that at some point,&quot; said Martha before looking at the mirror again, &quot;I lost 300 pounds in 30 seconds. Thank you, Megashake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You weren&#39;t really over 300 pounds, were you?&quot; asked Robbie.<br />
<br />
Martha turned and flicked Robbie on the nose. &quot;Never ask a woman about her weight, even if she is your wife,&quot; she scolded him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet I can pick you up now,&quot; said Robbie, letting his dressing gown drop, showing his own buff, naked body, his foxhood standing at attention.<br />
<br />
Martha&#39;s ears perked up at that. &quot;What are you proposing exactly?&quot; she purred.<br />
<br />
&quot;This,&quot; said Robbie before picking her up. Even though she was considerably lighter now than as a human, she still had an amazonian figure that made her heavier than the average woman. But Robbie had his own impressive set of muscles so it was easy for him to carry him over to the nearest wall and press her against it. Her feet were still off the ground as he cupped her ass and lined up his cock with her pussy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You make me feel light as a feather,&quot; said Martha happily.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll make you feel like you&#39;re walking on air,&quot; said Robbie before pushing inside her. Martha crooned as he went to work. She had never made love before she met Robbie, no man would have touched her with a 10-foot pole. But Robbie was more than ready to embrace even back then. She&#39;ll never forget his empathy and she was going to be the best wife he could ever ask for.</p>
