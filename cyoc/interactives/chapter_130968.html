<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They both looked nice....sleeping next to each other. Jackson was still tied to the pillar on the ground and Emily was newly tied to the other pillar standing up. They both looked at the monster in horror.<br />
<br />
&quot;What h-has happened to you Mary&quot; Jackson says with horror. Em whimpers in fear as well. Mary feels disappointed &quot;What will happen to everyone...evolution...I have been given a job to choose 7 random individuals to take part in amazing tests. I have chosen you Emily to join me in the new hierarchy.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about...Just let me and my Jackson go&quot; Em stutters. &quot;You still don&#39;t understand Em. This is for our friendship and your friendship with Jackson&quot;. <br />
<br />
Em looks at Jackson &quot;Can I at least tell him the truth...&quot; she says softly. Mary blinks wildy and thinks... &quot;Of course you can but you only have the night&quot;. Em looks at Jackson in fear...&quot;Don&#39;t worry Em&quot; Jackson says in a kind voice. &quot;Your going to be alright&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;I k-know...but there&#39;s something...I need to t-tell you, Jack&quot; she mutters. Jackson looks at her with a fixed intent to listen to her final words as a normal person. &quot;I...take so long at the Coffee stand...because...because&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary listens intently too &quot;I&#39;m afraid...Everyone is always so kind to me...Saying I live a wonderful life with a loving family and loving f-fri-&quot; She stops the last one which angers Mary a little bit. &quot;But when they talk about you Jackson. They say your weak and unloving to girls...I disagree. Your the kindest sweetest person I&#39;ve ever met...and I&#39;m glad I have you. But this peer pressure is drawing my love away from you and filling it with fear...I&#39;m sorry Jackson but I&#39;m not strong enough for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I d-don&#39;t want you to b-be strong for me...I just want your love...and if the others don&#39;t want to see it, we block them out...all of them&quot;.<br />
<br />
Mary had enough of these romantics. She looked at Emily and said &quot;It&#39;s time now...&quot; Mary holds the syringe full of green liquid. Emily screams in fear asking Jackson for help. Jackson struggles and can&#39;t save her from her fate.<br />
<br />
Emily also struggles but it&#39;s no use. Mary plunges the syringe into her bare skin. And watches in glee for the transformation. Emily stops, she doesn&#39;t feel anything like Mary did at first &quot;Oh god&quot;...she holds her neck. She cries in pain as her veins and arteries reach the surface of her skin. Her heart and breath rate probably rapidly increasing.<br />
<br />
Jackson cries out to Mary to stop...but there was no stopping this. &quot;You will resist it at first. but then you&#39;ll accept it...and then want more&quot;. Emily screams &quot;No!&quot;. As her muscle mass also increases just like Mary. Mary starts to think she&#39;ll be just like her but then after her muscle mass had increased she groaned in pain and reached for her hole. She groaned again &quot;No-- I won-&#39;t&quot;. She growled angrily. And lifted her neck back like Mary did. She growled now in a deep voice. And started to moan in pleasure.<br />
<br />
But this time, something else happened. Instead of going white and pale and increasing in muscle mass even more she started to go green. And dark green that is. Her skin seemed to bulge out, thickening in size and hardening like a cacoon. She was growing scales. Her hands were outstretched and Mary could see why, her nails were sharpening. <br />
<br />
Suddenly the Lizard ripping at the net covering her. She was able to get partly free of it. And at this point Mary questioned what would happen to her mind. She lent against the floor and pushed her butt up. Something slimy grew out the top and get expanding. It was a tail. She lied the other way and pulsed on the floor in pleasure. She put her hands against her head. As her head shrinked and gained scales too.<br />
<br />
She stopped transforming and lay there on the floor. Mary guessed it had stopped and she was mostly right. However then the Lizard jumped into the air and snarled at Jackson. It had predator yellow eyes which glowed in the night. <br />
<br />
&quot;Em...it&#39;s me Jackson&quot;. Mary realised what was wrong and cried out no, But she was too late. Em ran towards the place were Jackson was struggling and grabbed her boyfriend. &quot;Em no!!!&quot;. She ripped him to the ground and then slashed into his chest. Blood spurted out of it and Jackson cried in pain &quot;No Em...pls I....I&quot;. She ripped into his face, and it&#39;s pieces scattered across the ground in a bloody smear. <br />
<br />
There stood a cowering monster and a mutilated corpse with blood leaking out of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Em...can you hear me&quot;. Emily looked at Mary she looked at her narrowly and saw herself...&quot;Mary...what have you done to me&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;Em...I had to...I....I&quot; Mary realised what she was wrong, all of this just because she wanted more. She had to stop. &quot;Em...I&#39;m sorry this feeling took hold of me&quot;.<br />
<br />
Emily looks at Mary angrily &quot;You have to change me back...now!&quot;. Emily jumped up. &quot;I d-don&#39;t know how to&quot; Mary said softly. Emily scowled &quot;There must be something&quot; she cried softly looking down at the corpse which was once Jackson. &quot;I&#39;m sorry about Jackson Em&quot; Mary said calmly. &quot;Well you should because it&#39;s your fault...it&#39;s all your fault-&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily was cut of by a clean voice, which came from the same man who drugged Mary. &quot;Well Well Well, it&#39;s not entirely Mary&#39;s fault&quot;. Mary looked stunned, Emily angrily ran towards the suited man. Mary stopped her &quot;No...he&#39;s the only one who can help you&quot;...&quot;You are exactly right Mary...I am&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Emily stopped &quot;What do you and her want&quot;. &quot;Oh sweet Emily, I just want to see the 8 vials tested...&quot;. Emily retorted &quot;And to ruin their lifes&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s just a side effect...you see Mary and you still need to test 6 more vials&quot;. &quot;And why would we do that&quot; Emily said angrily. &quot;Because if you don&#39;t you&#39;ll never be normal again&quot; He chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine...But how did Mary transform back can I have one of those devices&quot;. Emily begs. The man smiled and brought out a PDW out of his pocket. Emily snatched it and lifted it around her arm she pressed it and felt herself turn back to normal. &quot;Okay Incognito...what do we do now&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;The next vile the Aqua Light one has to be tested in water...So maybe get a fisherman friend&quot; He chuckled. &quot;This isn&#39;t funny&quot; Mary said which surprised the man. &quot;You were willing to comply before Mary...what changed&quot;. Mary looked angrily at him &quot;You changed me...whatever lust I had before caused this all to happen&quot;. The man looked at her closely &quot;Yes that was a side effect but your normal now and can work a bit more effectively without killing anyone else&quot; he says looking at the corpse. <br />
<br />
Mary and Emily look after him as he leaves the room. &quot;Hope I see the same tomorrow...you have 6 days&quot; He slams the door shut. And with the only thing in the air being silence. Mary and Emily look at each other and the mess they have created.</p>
