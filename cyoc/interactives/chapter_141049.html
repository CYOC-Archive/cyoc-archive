<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I think my brother will be expecting me, I mean us,” Tommy said, removing his hand from between Theo’s legs. “I just need to get you that shirt.”<br />
“Supposed we went a little later,” Theo said. “The party will go on for hours, right?” <br />
They stood less than six inches from each other as they spoke. <br />
“Yea, man, but we did all of this work to get you looking hot. You definitely want to show it off.”<br />
“You think I look hot, Tommy?” Tommy nodded. The bulge in Theo’s pants could not get any bigger.  <br />
Theo leaned in and gave him a peck on the lips. He thought it would be up to Tommy to make the moves, but Theo seemed to be the one with all of the confidence now. He had to do something soon or he might lose his chance. He repositioned himself in front of Tommy, his hands still resting on Tommy’s ass. Slowly, he moved one of his hands around Tommy and slid it between them. His fingers searched for what he knew Tommy had hidden beneath his jeans. Theo stared into Tommy’s face as his fingers traced the bulge below his pants. <br />
“I think maybe, just maybe, we can be a little late to the party,” Theo said, squeezing Tommy’s cock through his pants as he slid his hand down over him. “Don’t you, bro?” Theo felt in grow longer under his touch. <br />
“It’s the first time I was invited. I’m not sure my brother will invite me again if I don’t go,” Tommy whispered. <br />
Theo’s hands were on Tommy’s Louis Vuitton belt buckle, slowly opening it as he looked into Tommy’s eyes. <br />
“Just a little late?” Tommy gulped, and Theo slid the leather out from the belt buckle and quickly opened Tommy’s top button. <br />
The sound of the zipper bled into the room as Theo slid it down. His heart beat flooded his ears as he reached into Tommy’s pants. As Theo’s fingers circled Tommy’s cock head, he looked into Tommy’s eyes. Theo smiled as his nipples hardened feeling the sudden pain from the new piercing. Tommy smiled back as he felt Theo’s other hand push the side of his pants over his hips. Theo switched hands, moving Tommy’s cock to the other as his free hand worked the other side of Tommy’s pants down. He slid both hands into Tommy’s underwear, one wrapping around the hard shaft of Tommy’s cock, the other sliding down between his legs, cupping his balls. <br />
“It’s a long party, Tommy,” Theo said. “I promise you we can go in a little while. First, I want you to fuck my mouth, okay?”<br />
Tommy’s face wrinkled a little, almost frozen as he looked back at Theo. How he had underestimated the boy’s confidence. As Theo slid down in front of him, Tommy’s hands moved to his shoulders, gently massaging Theo as he knelt before him. As he felt his cock slide into Theo’s mouth, his mind shifted from his brother’s frat party completely. His shaft slid deep inside the warm mouth below him as Theo tugged on his balls. <br />
Tommy’s cock was bigger than any other dick that Theo had handled, not that he had handled many. It was thick and long. He slid his lips over the head and then he swallowed him deep inside. His tongue licked Tommy’s shaft as he fed it in and out of his mouth slowly, working more of him into his mouth each time. He felt Tommy’s hands move from his shoulders to the back of his head, his fingers gently rubbing his scalp raw from his new haircut. Theo pulled Tommy’s cock out and looked up at him as he ran his tongue along his shaft, from base to tip, and then swallowed him up again as he closed his eyes. Tommy began to slowly thrust into his mouth. Theo did his best to take all of him inside, but he was just too large. He gagged at times, spitting him out, licking his shaft once more, before Tommy pressed himself inside of him again. Theo was rock-hard, pressing against the inside of his own pants as he released Tommy’s cock with his hand and let Tommy pull his head on and off of him. <br />
His free hands worked his own pants down, pushing them down to his knees as he knelt in front of Tommy while Tommy fucked his face. Theo’s hand wrapped around his cock, jerking it slowly as he stretched it out in front of him. Fuck, that felt good. Tommy pushed deep into his mouth, holding his mouth on him before he slid out. He could hear Tommy moaning and could smell him as Theo pulled on his own tool. <br />
They stayed like this for another couple of minutes, Tommy changing his pace, pressing hard into Theo’s mouth, sometimes holding himself there before sliding all of the way out and letting Theo catch his breath as a wad of saliva dripped over his chin. At one point, Theo felt Tommy’s hand under his chin as he lifted it so that Theo would look up at him. Then he pressed himself deep into his mouth once more. As he pulled out, he lifted Theo by his shoulders up in front of him and then covered Theo’s mouth with his pressing his tongue deep inside his mouth, tasting his own cock on Theo’s tongue as they swirled in the sea of saliva. Theo felt his cock rub against Tommy’s wet cock and he pulled himself close, thrusting into the heat between Tommy’s legs. <br />
Heaven was the only way that Theo could describe what he was feeling. He pressed off his sneakers as he worked to push his pants off the rest of the way. Tommy did the same as they continued swirl their tongues together. When their kiss broke, Tommy pushed Theo away – just enough so he could see his full face. They continued to grind against one another, their cocks rubbing and stabbing. <br />
“Your mouth is incredible,” Tommy said. “Your tongue…”<br />
Theo grabbed Tommy’s hand, pulling him over to the bed. Tommy followed willingly. They both stripped off their shirts, naked now as they crawled up onto the bed. Tommy fell on top of Theo and Theo pulled him into his arms, feeling the pain of the nipple piercing as their chests crushed together. Their hands moved over each other, pushing, caressing, fondling. Theo felt Tommy’s tongue on his neck, sliding down slowly, and then he felt Tommy grab his dick, pulling the skin up over its head, squeezing him as he jerked him. Theo arched his back into Tommy’s mouth, sliding down over his chest, onto the pierced nipple.<br />
“Fuck!” Theo cried out as Tommy’s tongue banged as the stainless hook that hung from Theo’s nipple. He licked the tip of his nipple, the pain and pleasure blending together for Theo. <br />
Tommy’s hands slid down between Theo’s legs, pulling on his sack, sliding underneath, between his cock and ass, his fingers probing. Theo stopped moving, quieting himself, waiting for Tommy’s fingers to reach his hole. When they did, Tommy circled his hole with his fingers and then brought them back up to grab Theo’s cock. Theo’s whole body shook with excitement. <br />
Tommy picked his head up off of Theo’s chest, looking up at him, smiling. Theo smiled back as Tommy slid off of him. Theo looked over at him as Tommy stood next to the bed. Was this it? Where was he going. Theo started to sit up and reached his hand out to Tommy. <br />
“I’ll be right there,” Tommy said, reaching into the table next to the bed. He pulled out a bottle and moved back onto the bed. <br />
Theo watched as Tommy squirted some of the gel from the bottle onto his hands. Kneeling beside Theo, Tommy slid his greased-up hand between Theo’s legs, his fingers sliding over his cock and then down to his balls. Theo stared back at Tommy as Tommy slid his hand down further and slowly pressed his fingers into Theo’s ass. He grunted as two fingers pressed up inside of him, still holding Tommy’s eyes with his own. Tommy pulled them out and Theo slowly thrusted against them as Tommy slid them in deeper. <br />
Theo spread his legs, his hips lifting up to meet the fingers that probed him. His hands were at his sides doing nothing. He wanted to reach for Tommy’s cock, and he tried without much luck as he lay on his back as Tommy fucked him with his fingers. Tommy looked down at him smiling, watching his new friend as he pleasured him. He slid his thumb up through Theo’s ball sack each time his fingers pressed deep inside his ass. He liked watching him squirm under his touch. Tommy slid his mouth down and sucked Theo’s cock into his mouth as he increased the speed of his fingers in his ass. <br />
Theo was breathing hard, trying to control himself. He didn’t want to blow in Tommy’s mouth – well, he did, but he didn’t think that was the best thing to do at this time. The fingers in his ass kept pumping him and he was sure if he didn’t do something, he would definitely shoot his load into the warm mouth that sucked on him. He watched Tommy’s head bob up and down, his mind racing as he trust up and against the fingers. He was gasping for air and moaning loudly when Tommy slid his mouth off of him and looked up at him, his chin wet with his own saliva. <br />
Slowly, Theo felt the fingers slide out of his ass. He stopped thrusting as he stared up at Tommy, watching his switch his position on the bed and crawl in between Tommy’s legs, still kneeling. He bent forward, pulling a pillow down from the top of the bed. He started to slide it up under Theo and Theo lifted his butt off the bed to help him. Tommy moved in closer. <br />
Tommy pushed against the bottom of Theo’s thighs raising his legs up. He giggled, and Theo looked back at him, thinking it was a strange time to laugh. <br />
 “The tattoo guy does amazing work,” he said, staring down at Theo’s ass. <br />
“What?” Theo managed, not believing what they were talking about. <br />
“You have a giant tribal tattoo, covering all of your ass” Tommy said “My Choice, now you’re my little Jock Boy. It’s also a special tribal tattoo designed to make your ass bigger”. Theo started to lift himself and Tommy pushed him back down. “Don’t worry, it’s beautiful,” he said. As he said this Theo felt a heat in his ass as it began to swell into a perfect muscle bubble butt ready for Tommy to Fuck. <br />
“Wait,” Theo said, but he felt the head of Tommy’s cock press against his, now giant, ass. <br />
He closed his eyes, calming himself from the news of the tattoo as he waited for him to slide it inside. Whatever gel he had used certainly was working. He heard himself let out a loud grunt as Tommy pressed himself deeper inside, Tommy’s hands sliding under Theo’s ass. Theo cried out as the cock left him only to be pressed deeper inside once more. As Tommy spread him wide, Theo felt his ass parting for him, relaxing himself to allow him to slide in deeper. Theo planted his feet and thrust back against Tommy, slowly at first, feeling his entire cock fill him up. <br />
Tommy used his hands on Theo’s ass to slide him back and forth on his cock, each time driving himself in deeper until he was completely inside of him. Once there, he slid Theo slowly on and off of his stiff pole, stretching and spreading his ass as he looked down at his friend on the bed, his body thrusting back against him.<br />
“There you go, Theo,” he said. “I’m all in.” <br />
He reached awkwardly with one of his hands for Theo’s cock, tugging on it as he fucked him. Both men were grunting and moaning. Below him, Theo arched his back as he thrust into Tommy. He was ready to explode; he needed to ever since he was in Tommy’s mouth. He didn’t care anymore where his load landed. The cock sliding in and out of him was too much for him to take. His moans were getting louder and coming faster now as Tommy changed his pace. Theo knew that Tommy would be ready soon also. <br />
“God!” Tommy screamed out as he slid Theo on and off of him faster. He was ready to blow at any minute, feeling Theo’s ass stretch the skin of his cock as he slid in and out. “I’m… fuck!” Tommy yelled, as he started to cum. <br />
His hand no longer tugging on Theo’s cock. He felt his own cum fill Theo’s ass, surrounding his cock, melting him inside of Theo. He increased his pace even more, driving hard and fast into Theo’s ass, hearing him cry out below him. He couldn’t stop fucking him, his tight hole tugging on his soft skin. His hot ass consuming him. Tommy looked down at Theo, seeing his face twisted, the ring hanging from his nipple. Tommy’s mind becoming clearer as his orgasm started to fade. He was driving hard into Theo and he started to slow down, seeing the body below him come into focus. He stopped his thrusting, feeling Theo still thrust against him and slowly slid his cock out from inside of him. <br />
Theo’s eyes opened, no longer in the throes of passion and he looked up at Tommy. He could feel his load leaking from his ass, tickling him as it dripped down below him onto the bed. Theo had stopped thrusting. He smiled up at Tommy, happy that he had given him the pleasure that he needed. They were both breathing very hard as they stared at each other. <br />
“Ready for that party now?” Theo said, between breathes. He smiled, and Tommy smiled back.<br />
Tommy nodded and then his hand reached for hard cock that stood up between Theo’s legs. “I think we have a little more time, don’t you?”</p>
