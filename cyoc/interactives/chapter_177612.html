<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a short ride into town to the bar; Mason and Bobby spent it jamming to an oldies station. Mason still loved the music of the 70’s and 80’s, but his son Ian had never liked his ‘classical music selections’. He was surprised as Bobby thumped the side of the truck with his big hand and sang along with Duane Allman like a dedicated fan. <br />
<br />
“Such a loss, man. This guy was great.” He said, shaking his big bushy head. <br />
<br />
They pulled up to the bar and stepped out of the car. The town was fairly small; only a handful of bars were close by, and this one was by far the town favorite. Bobby sauntered through the door, stretching out a big arm to keep it open as his father followed in behind him. Mason took his usual seat in the middle of the bar, Bobby hefting himself up onto the chair beside him, as Pat the bartender sidled up to them.<br />
<br />
“What’s going on, boys?” he asked, a white-toothed smile parting his neatly trimmed beard. “Mason, my man. What can get for you all?”<br />
<br />
“Guinness, please.” Requested mason.<br />
<br />
“Your IPA on tap, brother.” Said Bobby. Pat returned shortly, setting down their drinks and typing the order into the kiosk.<br />
<br />
“Haven’t seen you in here before,” Pat said jovially to Bobby. “You a friend of Mason’s?” he asked. Mason did some very quick thinking and was about to respond when Bobby beat him to it.<br />
<br />
“I’m a custom carpenter,” he explained in a rumble. “One of Mason’s client’s is redoing their kitchen.”<br />
<br />
“Big bucks, nice to hear.” Pat commented.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, you know those Slate Cove millionaires.” Mason laughed. “Gotta blow money on something, I guess.” Pat laughed and stalked off to take some orders from another table. <br />
<br />
“A custom carpenter?” Mason asked, shaking his head at Bobby.<br />
<br />
“What, man?” He shrugged. “Look at this body; I’ve been doing work like that all my life. Plus, I actually do have carpentry knowledge in here,” he said, tapping his grey forehead.<br />
<br />
“And the lyrics of Duane Allman, apparently.” Mason took a deep draught from his glass.<br />
<br />
“That pill is something else. Shit, man! He didn’t even card me!” bobby whispered, chuckling.<br />
<br />
“I told you; No reason to card men who look like us.” Mason said, and they clinked their classes together and drank.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Bobby smirked down at himself. “I could get used to this.” His hand drifted down to feel his bulging crotch. “I’m bigger than Ian’s boyfriend now,” he snickered.<br />
<br />
“Wait, your what?” Mason put his glass down at looked at Bobby in shock.<br />
<br />
Bobby turned to him and saw the look on Mason’s face and sputtered as he took a sip of his beer. “Shit, man, he hasn’t…or I haven’t told you yet.” He put his own beer down and turned his impressive weight towards his father. “Sorry, Dad. I wanted to tell you when I met someone. Its been a whirlwind of a first year.” He admitted, taking up his beer again.<br />
<br />
“How long have you known?” asked Mason, still looking into Ian’s green eyes peaking out from Bobby’s broad, matured face.<br />
<br />
“A few years, I guess. You go off to college, and, you know, you have all that freedom…”<br />
<br />
“I get it, I went to college too.” Mason turned his seat back and took a deep drink, finishing it and calling over Pat for another. <br />
<br />
“He really wanted to tell you, he just wasn’t sure how you’d react.” Bobby said, speaking for Ian. <br />
<br />
Mason was starting to feel weird; not about his son coming out gay, but about the fact that Bobby was talking to him about it like a buddy and not the son in question. He also felt a little guilty that his son would worry about how Mason would take it.<br />
<br />
“He’s my son,” Mason said, settling into the dynamic. “I just want him to find love and be happy. And I want him to tell me things that are important and not beat around the bush.” He leveled a serious gaze on Ian’s green eyes; the big man looked down with a sheepish grin at his hairy arms. <br />
<br />
“Thanks, Dad.” He said.<br />
<br />
“I love you,” Mason said.<br />
<br />
“Awe, man. Don’t be gay!” they laughed and toasted each other again before downing their beers and ordering another round. <br />
<br />
They had a few more beers and ordered some delicious, greasy bar food. Bobby and Mason talked about sports, relationships, life. Bobby told Mason about his boyfriend from college, who seemed nice, and Mason confessed it had been a while since he’d gotten any action.<br />
<br />
“What? A good-looking man like you? What about all those rich housewives left alone in those McMansions all day?” Bobby grinned, wagging his eyebrows. <br />
<br />
Mason groaned. “Oh god, those trophy wives are repressed.” He shook his head. “They’re crazy. Last week one of them tried to convince me the government shouldn’t be able to force children to wear seatbelts.”<br />
<br />
“Wow, that is some Hannity-strength crazy,” Bobby agreed. “But still, you gotta get out there, man.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, yeah.”<br />
<br />
They finished their burgers and their beers, and soon they were getting both feeling ready to take this party back home. Bobby leaned back in his seat, resting his hands on his expansive belly and wondering why he was feeling so tired when it was still fairly early. Mason dug into his back pocket and extracted some cash for the bill.<br />
<br />
“Too bad that pill couldn’t give you a job,” he joked, stepping out of the chair.<br />
<br />
“At this age, its too bad it didn’t come with a 401k.. I’d be loaded.” Bobby replied. <br />
<br />
They drove back in silence, Mason ruminating about Bobby’s revelation about his son. Mason wasn’t surprised; he’d figured so for a long time. After all, the boy had never brought home a girl to his recollection. He was always proud of his son, and meant it when he said all he wanted was Ian’s happiness. It kept him thinking about his own life, however. Mason’s wife, Ian’s mother, had left them when Ian was only a few years old. As a single father, he’d worked a lot and devoted the remaining hours to his son; he’d never had much time for dates. Sure he’d get laid here and there, but after his first year alone without his son, Mason had started to feel the pang of loneliness again. Lately, though, he hadn’t had much of any eye for women. He’d caught himself looking at men a few times, but he’d always written it off as envy or something. Now, with Ian coming out to him, he started to think about these and other experiences in a new light. <br />
<br />
They pulled up in front of the house and stumbled through the door, Bobby dropping himself heavily upon the couch with a sigh and a loud belch.<br />
<br />
“Heh-heh, sorry, Mason.” He laughed, rubbing his belly and closing his eyes. “Think I might take a catnap, just for a minute…” he muttered, his head nodding. Mason laughed as Bobby quickly nodded off, his big head falling back on against the couch. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, we older guys do love our catnaps,” he said aloud. He looked around the kitchen, his eyes finding the little pill bottle and the empty water glass. Still a little drunk, Mason grabbed the pill bottle and read the instructions again, arching a brow. He wanted to try it as well, but he wasn’t sure what it would do to him. Would it make him older, or just hairier or more masculine looking? The label didn’t mention any disastrous or life-threatening consequences, and they wouldn’t send something dangerous out as a free sample in the mail, would they?<br />
<br />
Mason filled the glass with water and extracted one of the large, white DILF pills. He popped it in his mouth and chased it down with some water, coughing when the pill stuck in his throat for a moment. Why does the pill have to be so big? he thought to himself, as his skins began to feel hot.<br />
<br />
Mason groaned as a series of cramps and tremors went through his body. He put down his glass just as one of the tremors brought him down to his knees, gasping as his stomach heaved and his bones started to ache. His skin itched and he watched in shock as the hair on his arms began to lighten in color, becoming less coarse. He felt the same itching on his chest and his back, his legs, his face. Feeling his cheeks Mason gasped when he felt that his cheeks were smooth. The feeling began to intensify in his head and crotch before suddenly evaporating as quickly as it came. Mason stayed there on his hands and knees, catching his breath before trying to stand up. He swayed a little and grabbed the countertop for support, looking down with wide eyes at his slender, un-calloused fingers. <br />
<br />
He quickly and quietly made his way to his bedroom so he could check his full-length mirror, his stomach sinking as he noticed that he was shorter, and that his pants were falling down from his waist. Mason entered his bedroom and stepped before the mirror to examine his new self. He was still a man, but he was younger! The laugh lines and crow’s feet of his face were gone, along with his beard and mustache. His face was as frustratingly smooth as he remembered it being when he was a boy. Mason pulled off his shirt and examined his flat, lithely muscled chest and his wiry arms. He realized that this wasn’t the body of his youth, but rather, just a youthful body. He supposed that, like Ian, the pill had temporarily transformed himself into someone else. He felt strangely proud of his smooth, athletic body and his unblemished tan skin. He felt his cock stiffen in his pants let his baggy jeans and underwear fall to the ground to examine himself more thoroughly. Mason gaped at the sight of his new cock; his beloved eight-inch schlong had reduced to five inches, resting over a pair of balls that looked proportionally larger than his cock. His legs were lithely muscled and lightly hairy, like the rest of him. Taking in the whole look, Mason found himself liking his new body. He turned and looked at his full, round ass, giggling at the demure look he presented.<br />
<br />
“Damn, that’s a nice ass.” A deep voice purred from the doorway, and Mason turned in shock to see Bobby leaning against the doorframe, his arms folded and a appraising look on his face. <br />
<br />
“Shit Bo…Ian! What are you doing!” Mason shouted, grabbing his clothes to cover himself. <br />
<br />
“I woke up and saw the open pill container on the counter, and I wanted to make sure you didn’t get turned into some ninety-year-old man.” His eyes roved Mason’s body from head to foot. “I don’t think either one of us expected this.”<br />
<br />
Mason wanted to shout at him to get out, but his new body was having strange reactions to the sight of Bobby’s bulky, manly frame. Seeing his chest hair made him want to nuzzle and rub his face against the man and feel his rough hair on his smooth skin. The front of Bobby’s pants were straining, and Mason wanted to open them up and find out what lurked inside. His fatherly concerns were becoming overwhelmed by another personality, with all their own likes and wants and dirty needs. <br />
<br />
“It’s kicking in isn’t it? The other man inside of you?” Bobby asked. He unfolded his arms and started to swagger over to the smaller man. <br />
<br />
“Wh…what do you mean?” he stammered, as Bobby’s big hands started to unbutton his shirt. <br />
<br />
“The pill unleashes the ‘MAN’ inside of you. It didn’t say anything about that man being the same one as the man you were.” He explained, opening his shirt and exposing his broad, hairy belly to the smaller man.<br />
<br />
“You’re right,” he confessed. “I don’t feel the same; he’s still there but…” he trailed off as Bobby unbuckled his belt and tossed it to the side.<br />
<br />
“So, what’s your name, boy?” Bobby growled, putting his big hands around the smaller man’s hips.<br />
<br />
“Jake,” he said, sighing as the big man’s hands moved around to knead his firm ass. <br />
<br />
“Nice to meet you, Jake,” he said. “You can call me, ‘Daddy’.” He lightly pushed Jake to the bed with his bulky frame. He shrugged out of his shirt and fell on top of him, his big hairy belly pressing jake against the bed. Jake sighed as he felt the weight of a man on top of him for the first time; he was warm, furry, heavy. He felt small and protected as Bobby loomed over him, a toothy smile parting his greying beard. Bobby leaned down to kiss him, his cock throbbing in the prison of his jeans at how smooth Jake’s hairless lips were. His big hands ran along the young man’s smooth body making Jake moan against him. Jake likewise ran his fingers through the hair on Bobby’s back, feeling the muscles flex and harden underneath them. With a grunt, Bobby rolled them over and Jake was laying across his expansive torse, his hands clutching Bobby’s face he passionately made out with him. Bobby squeezed and kneaded Jakes ass, letting a few fingers drift closer to stroke his sensitive opening. <br />
<br />
Jake gasped, the feeling make him feel hot and raunchy and giving him ideas. He started kissing his way down Bobby’s chest, taking a minute to lick and tease at Bobby’s big pink nipples and make the man groan and growl in pleasure. Jake made his way to Bobby’s strained jeans, undoing the button to give him relief. Bobby hooked his thumbs in the waist and pushed them down along with his boxers. Jake moaned when he felt Bobby reach below to heft his big cock and rub it against Jake’s asshole, teasing him by gently inserting the tip. Bobby distracted Jake with his mouth and the head of his cock while another hand blindly felt around his bedside table before be found the little bottle of lube that Mason kept around for himself. He tweaked Jake’s nipple while he applied the lube to his cock, grinning inwardly at how big and hard it felt, even in his own big hands. He lubed up Jake’s cock for good measure and then flipped them back over, laughing when Jake squealed in shock. He spread Jake’s legs around his knees and held his cock against Jake’s hole, inviting him to take a look.<br />
<br />
Jake raised his head and stared down at the throbbing, nine-inch cock that Bobby was tempting him with, the low-hanging balls swaying with his motion. Jake had never seen a man as beautiful and masculine as Bobby in his life, and he wanted with all his being for the man to dutifully fuck him nice and good. <br />
<br />
“Do you want this cock, baby?” he purred, pressing the head into him.<br />
<br />
“You know I do,” Jake replied, arching his back slightly and pressing himself against it. “Daddy,” he added. <br />
<br />
Bobby just grinned and put a hand on Jake’s shoulder, pressing himself against the younger man. Jake yelped when he felt Bobby’s big cock finally push him apart and enter, looking down in disbelief as Bobby smoothly inserted his cock up to the hilt. Jake leaned back and let his breath out in shallow bursts as he took in the sensation of the big cock deep within him. He knew that as Mason, he’d never had anything other than a doctors fingers up his ass; but Jake’s body seemed to be built for taking cock. Bobby began to rapidly thrust himself into him, his big balls slapping against Jake’s ass as he pounded the boy into submission. Jake lifted himself up to meet Bobby’s thrusts, wincing in pleasure as his cock seemed to reach deeper and deeper inside of him. He wrapped his legs around Bobby’s strong back and began to jerk himself to the sight of this powerful man, laying waste to his ass. Jake loved getting fucked by older men; they really loved what they were doing. And bobby loved the sight of this pretty young man moaning and writhing around his fat cock. He took a strong grip of Jake’s legs and began to thrust himself harder and harder as Jake jerked himself faster until together, they came. Jake could feel Bobby’s big cuck pumping his load into him as he spilled his own load all over his chest. Bobby collapsed on top of him, his balls throbbing and his cock softening within the smaller man. He pulled him close and they kissed deeply and cuddled for a moment, Jake enjoying the feeling of Bobby’s cock softening inside him while he was held against protectively against the man’s big, strong chest.<br />
<br />
“We should probably shower,” Bobby whispered against his ear.<br />
<br />
“And change the sheets,” Jake replied.<br />
<br />
Bobby turned Jake’s head around to kiss him before pulling himself out with a yelp from the smaller man. He leaned back and watched as Jake got out of bed and stretched, displaying his full and slightly red ass. Jake padded into the shower and started the shower, with Bobby soon coming in to join him. They lathered each other up without speaking, kissing and caressing each other occasionally. As they rinsed, Jake surprised him by slinking to his knees and taking Bobby’s big cock into his mouth, and Bobby leaned against the shower stall and enjoyed the loving attention for a few minutes before once again his big balls tensed and he shot another heavy load down the young man’s throat. They dried off and went to bed, Jake falling asleep in Bobby’s arms, and memories of the white pill forgotten.</p>
