<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“… rottweiler bitch!”<br />
<br />
The combination of the woman’s cruel words and the potent transformation serum made Dr Jenkins’ stomach turn. He gripped himself in pain as he was grabbed by the two men that had brought him in. They unceremoniously threw him inside an isolated wire cage so that the change could progress unhindered.<br />
<br />
This procedure did the trick as the first few alterations took shape. Many of these changes were initially hidden by the doctor’s clothes, such as the first patches of his growing coat that appeared on his chest. His lab coat was also tented slightly as a tail started to protrude behind him. <br />
<br />
However, not all of the changes were so easily hidden. The doctor’s ears had become larger and floppier as they drooped down towards the floor. As well as this the man’s hands had shifted dramatically. His fingernails were replaced with claws, while fleshy pads developed from the palms of his changing hands. Soon the doctor had a pair of paws sticking through the sleeves of his shirt.<br />
<br />
Understandably all of these developments horrified the captive doctor. “Don’t…nnnnngh… don’t do this” he pleaded desperately. “I’ve served the Zoo loyally, I swear!”<br />
<br />
“And you will continue to do so,” Mrs Adams said with a slight chuckle, “albeit in a slightly different way!”<br />
<br />
The doctor despaired as the Kennel’s boss seemed to show no remorse in what she was doing to him. “You – nnngh – you bitch!”<br />
<br />
“Oh poor choice of words my dear,” Mrs Adams replied with a smile, “I think it’s about time that you accepted your new lot in life. And first that means that you have to stop hiding under all of those pesky clothes. After all, animals like you have no sense of shame, always putting themselves on display for the whole world to see. Now, let’s get a good look at you!”<br />
<br />
“You… aaaargh… you can’t… arf… can’t ARF ARF ARF!” The doctor’s words merged into angered barks as his voice finally abandoned him.<br />
<br />
Mrs Adams smiled as Dr Jenkins continued to whine as he writhed around in discomfort. She knelt down to start removing the doctor’s lab uniform. Thankfully the doctor had shrunken somewhat, meaning that the clothes were easy to remove. <br />
<br />
First she lifted the doctor’s coat to reveal the black furry tail that was tenting it. She smiled as the new appendage wagged involuntarily after being freed. Next she unbuttoned the doctor’s shirt before pulling everything off his top half. She was staggered by how fast the process had advanced. Already a warm coat of black and brown hairs had covered the man’s chest and back, while his former arms were now complete canine forelegs.<br />
<br />
With the front progressing nicely, Mrs Adams turned her attention to Jenkins’ bottom half. After a bit of coaxing she was able to remove the man’s shoes, socks, trousers and underwear. As with the front half, black hairs adorned the man’s back, while a lighter brown colour made up the hairs on his underside. His legs had undergone a similar change to his arms, while his tail was now fully grown.<br />
<br />
However, there were a few key changes that were only just starting to happen. Mrs Adams rolled the struggling doctor onto his back so that she had a clear view of the action. She smiled as three more pairs of nipples spread down Jenkins’ torso. The feeling made the doctor wince, even amidst the pain of his other changes. He understood basic canine biology enough to know what was coming next.<br />
<br />
However, the doctor’s realization did nothing to reverse the process. As anticipated a tingling feeling struck his cock and balls as they started to move closer to his tail. Mrs Adams lifted one of the doctor’s legs out of the way so that she could get a closer look. She smiled as the man’s scrotum unformed as the skin merged to form a distinctive mound between his legs. A slit then opened on this mound before his testicles were dragged inside. They were followed by the doctor’s penis which ended up as a canine clitoris. The walls of this new opening then built with muscle, leaving the doctor with a distinctive canine vagina.<br />
<br />
“Brilliant!” Mrs Adams announced, “I guess that means we should call you ‘Jen’ from now on!”<br />
<br />
Dr Jenkins felt sick to the core. He could feel the wet slit where his cock and balls ought to be. He now wished that his mind could let go. But sadly his survival instinct forced him to hang on to his senses, meaning that he felt the changes as they concluded.<br />
<br />
Jenkins was too worn out and distraught from his ordeal to really protest as the changes found his head. He shut his eyes in tired acceptance as a canine muzzle pushed out. His teeth and tongue changed inside his mouth, while his nose grew dark and wet. The doctor shuddered as the last few patches of his coat grew in to round of the process.<br />
<br />
Now he, or rather ‘she,’ was complete. She was now a rottweiler bitch!<br />
<br />
“Excellent; exactly as specified.” Mrs Adams was clearly impressed by the serum’s potency. “I must say that your transformation formula is incredible, as I’m sure you can now attest!” Jenkins, or rather ‘Jen,’ whined pitifully in response, she didn’t want to spend the rest of her days as a mangy dog, and definitely not a female one!<br />
<br />
“Awww don’t worry girl” the woman said mockingly, “I know exactly how to cheer you up!”<br />
<br />
The former doctor was still too overwhelmed to really take any notice of the woman’s taunts. She also lacked the strength to protest as a collar and lead were secured around her neck.<br />
<br />
“Right then dearie, follow me.” Jen shakily followed on her four new legs as her new master led her along. Mrs Adams smiled, knowing exactly what to do with the Kennel’s new bitch…</p>
