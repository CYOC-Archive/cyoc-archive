<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andy finished up the paperwork for the androgynous package and walked into the office he was directed towards. He hadn&#39;t read through the fine print all that well, but six months should be easy to get through if something went wrong.<br />
<br />
As he stepped into the office he had a quick look around. It didn&#39;t look much different from a physician&#39;s examination room: a bed lined with a disposable paper covering, sterilization equipment, a hazardous waste bin for used sharps, but it also had a full height mirror, and even some anatomical diagrams of people in all sorts of sexual and gender configurations.<br />
<br />
As the doctor stepped in, well maybe a doctor, whoever it is that seems to be administering the alteration, they advised that Andy stripped, and he was offered a paper gown to change into for the procedure. The doctor then left Andy to change, he stripped completely naked, leaving his clothes in a pile on a chair before gowning up and sitting on the paper lined examination bed. It felt awkward sitting there, ass on the cold paper, but that&#39;s just how this kind of stuff is, hopefully the process itself won&#39;t take that long.<br />
<br />
The doctor soon came back in with a syringe and a copy of Andy&#39;s paperwork, looking to him and starting off with, &quot;Well I can&#39;t say you&#39;re the first to come in today looking for this specific procedure, seems to be getting more and more popular every month. I get the appeal.&quot; As Andy idly looks over the doctor as they speak, he gets the feeling they might have gone through something similar, the doctor is quite androgynous, unable to put what they&#39;re currently presenting as, and their voice doesn&#39;t seem to give off any hint.<br />
<br />
Without much further chatting the doctor then prepares the needle, &quot;Now, after the injection we&#39;ll want to monitor you for a couple of hours, but don&#39;t worry, there&#39;s a sedative in the injection, you&#39;ll wake up ready to leave in your new body.&quot; Well that was reassuring, at least he didn&#39;t have to wait around bored. The doctor then cleaned up the injection site on Andy&#39;s arm, the cold sting of alcohol the preceded the actual injection, then in a quick motion the doctor injected Andy with the serum, the cold fluid filling his bloodstream and leaving him with a tingly sensation that only seemed to emanate from the injection site continually, spreading across his body until every last inch of his form started to tingle, almost going numb as it got harder to stay awake.<br />
<br />
The doctor told Andy something before exiting the room, but it was too hard for him to hear it as the sedative took hold, he slumped over into a laying position on the bed as he slipped into his induced slumber. His dreams were oddly erotic, filled with pleasured he had both experienced and ones he could only imagine. He couldn&#39;t make out any specific partner, but in one instant he&#39;d be topping some figure, sometimes feminine, sometimes masculine, and in another instant he&#39;d be bottoming for similar assortments of bodies. Though the experiences were not what he would expect. New sensations filled his mind as he dreamt of being taken vaginally, being filled and bred in a way he&#39;d never imagined before.<br />
<br />
Eventually Andy started to stir awake, the tingling sensation still present, but not as numbing as when first injected. As he opened his eyes the first thing he noticed was the tenting erection in his gown. Well, he still had a penis, that was a little unexpected... He wouldn&#39;t have thought androgyny to be so... similar. As he started to rouse further from his slumber he started to notice his body features were certainly less masculine than before, his muscles were all but gone, as was any arm or body hair, save for his armpits and his crotch. And his chest was slightly plump, probably wouldn&#39;t even call them A cup, but they were certainly closer to breasts than the pecs he came in with.<br />
<br />
As he went to sit up and swing his legs off the bed he felt a new sensation on his taint, a tingling behind his balls as he became immediately aware of the most substantial changes to his form. Reaching under his gown and behind his sack he felt the morning-aroused lips of his new pussy. &quot;So this is what they meant by best of both...&quot; he muttered to himself, gasping a little and covering his mouth as he noticed the change in voice. It still sounded like Andy just... girlier? No, just less manly. He could probably get away with sounding like either now, but that is what he signed up for. He then got back to the task at hand and started to explore his new sex a little with his fingers, noticing the moist contour of his labia and his little clitoris snugged up right under his scrotum. And almost as if on queue, the doctor opens the door and Andy quickly pulls his hand out from under his gown, blushing red from his still tenting erection as the doctor immediately reassures, &quot;Sexual arousal is a completely natural part of the procedure, your body is producing more hormones than you&#39;re used to, it might take some time to adjust, but I do ask you to wait until you&#39;ve vacated the facility before pleasuring yourself, we do need to keep these rooms sterile.&quot;<br />
<br />
That didn&#39;t help things, and Andy was still blushing as the doctor walked over to one of the anatomical diagrams, walking past the mirror, his eyes following until he finally noticed his own reflection in the mirror. He walked up to it and almost gasped. Gone was the chiseled features of his handsome face, his cheekbones and chin now much less pronounced, and he could barely tell if he even had an Adam&#39;s apple anymore. It also didn&#39;t look like he had ever shaved before, nor would he ever need to, his face almost preadolescent, at least from the perspective of masculinity. <br />
<br />
Attention drawn back to the doctor, they started pointing out one of the diagrams, &quot;Now that you are a full functioning androgynous hermaphrodite you should probably know a bit more about your anatomy...&quot; They proceeded to explain to Andy some of the quirks of his new reproductive equipment, as well as the quirks of having both sets of fully functional sexes, how that affected his hormones, and how that would change his menstruation cycle from someone who only had female reproductive parts. Andy nodded along, only understanding parts of what he was being told, but felt like he got the gist of it. The medical jargon and discussion actually helped get his arousal down, his post-anesthetic wood finally softening as the doctor let him know he could change back into his clothes and be dismissed from the clinic.<br />
<br />
As the doctor left to let him change and leave, he stripped out of his gown and went back to the mirror again. Looking over his nude androgynous form in full force. He almost looked too girly to be a guy, and to manly to be a girl. This was exactly what he was looking for. And now with both sexes between his legs he felt he could get anyone he wanted. Before the arousing sensation returned, he slipped back into his clothing. His new vagina didn&#39;t like his underwear all that well, he&#39;d probably have to find and alternative style now that better suited his new anatomy.<br />
<br />
As he checked out of the clinic and headed home, a million thoughts were running through his head. Should he still go by Andy? Should he still go by he? What would be more appropriate now? Technically he was now literally non-binary, or maybe dual sex? So many questions, but the real one that needed to be answered right here and now, what was he going to do?</p>
