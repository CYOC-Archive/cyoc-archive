<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris drove to work trying not to freak out that he was now gay. When he arrived he went through the locker room as always...Except now all of his male coworkers’ average bodies looked completely different under the light of his new sexuality. The locker room was always a sausage fest, because no women in the town but now it was like being in some naked men paradise. He was surprised at some of the men he was attracted to. He’d always thought of gay men as male barbies who only date perfectly athletic men. Now he realized that even slightly athletic men were quite attractive.<br />
<br />
Chris was trying not to get caught stealing glances at the men who were changing. They were going off with their usual homophobic/homoerotic conversations and he was joining in, trying to remain seeming straight. For the first time, Chris could see what kind of a danger he and his fellow officers posed for minorities. He no longer wanted to be a cop, and was ashamed that he hadn’t noticed this as a cishet man. But as he had already shown up for today, he may as well start training the new guy and give his notice after the shift. He still had to be able to get a job after this, after all.<br />
<br />
“Just be sure to give that new little faggot a good hazing!” Said one officer to Chris when the topic of his training the new guy came up, “Let him know that this department owns him body and mind. Hell, grab him by the ol’ balls and chain,” said the guy, gesturing by grabbing his own genitals and shaking them at Chris. Chris had to leave the room before his oncoming boner struck. He assured all the guys that he would give this guy a proper hazing.<br />
<br />
When Chris met the new officer, ‘little faggot’ didn’t at all describe the man before him. Clarence was huge. He was a 22 year-old farm boy who stood 6’5” with heaping pounds of muscle. His head was shaved and he had facial stubble. His eyebrows were thick and brown. <br />
<br />
Clarence’s other defining characteristic was that he was dumber that a pound of pebbles, which Chris found out quickly through interacting with him. Chris would’ve been surprised that Clarence even passed the course to be a cop, but he knew firsthand that often those results were forged. <br />
<br />
Chris told him that they needed to practice some mock pull-overs and they headed out to a non busy highway.<br />
<br />
“Okay Clarence, I’m gonna ask you to step out of our squad car as if you’re a drunk driver,” said Chris, “Sir, I’m gonna need you to step out of your vehicle.”<br />
<br />
Clarence played along as Chris gave him a sobriety test. Even though Clarence obviously passed the sobriety test, Chris said that they should go over what would happen if they fail.<br />
<br />
“Put your hands on your head,” said Chris.<br />
<br />
“Now we want to search their body for contraband,” said Chris.<br />
<br />
“And although we want to pat down their back pockets, we never want to grab their ass like this,” said Chris, squeezing Clarence’s farm boy ass to his heart’s content.<br />
<br />
“No matter how big, or round, or tempting it is, you never wanna jiggle their buns like this,” said Chris with his fingers pulling up and bouncing the large booty.<br />
<br />
“What you can do, and what is an acceptable way to check in the front is to use your face through the fabric. See, your face has a lot of nerves and is very good at feeling out differences. Much better than hands,” said Chris, before rubbing his face all into Clarence’s crotch. He could feel his penis and balls even through the fabric of Clarence’s pants and underwear. His hand once again groped the man’s ass while his face was buried in his crotch.<br />
<br />
“Um wow, I didn’t know that Chris,” said Clarence. He was so dumb that he believed Chris. Plus it did feel good to have the older man’s face poking around where is was. Clarence couldn’t help but get hard, even though he had no preference for men. Chris only seemed to push his face harder against the penis.<br />
<br />
“Okay, now do my sobriety test,” said Chris. <br />
<br />
Clarence complied and Chris purposely failed the sobriety test, despite of course being sober.<br />
<br />
“Now check me for contraband, and show me the ‘do’s and ‘don’t’s,” said Chris.<br />
<br />
“We never wanna grab somebody’s ass like this,” said Clarence, grabbing Chris’ ass for a brief second. It felt amazing for Chris but it was over all too soon.<br />
<br />
“That’s it? That wasn’t enough to cause a sexual harassment case. Do it again for longer, like I did to you. That’ll give you a better idea of what’ll get you in trouble,” said Chris, wanting to be fondled more.<br />
<br />
Clarence obliged and really squeezed Chris’ ass and spent time jiggling it. It gave Chris a funny feeling in his prostate and he realized that he actually wanted to be fucked by a man. It was still hard getting used to being gay but his urges were taking over.<br />
<br />
Finally Clarence checked the front of Chris’ pants for contraband, with his face. As he was checking, Chris was rubbing his shaved head, pulling it closer to his hard on. He rubbed up so much on the beefy young man’s head that he ended up cumming in his pants. Some came through the fabric and onto Clarence’s face.<br />
<br />
“Sorry about that. That does happen when you search people sometimes,” said Chris with an awkward laugh.</p>
