<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>Jon stared at what Alexis was holding: a pair of panties and a bra with elegant swirling needlework and a fair amount of frilly trim.
<P>"Anything but those, Alex, please," Jon whimpered.
<P>"You'll look great in them! They'll help you embrace your femininity." Alex led her protesting boy/girlfriend to the nearby changing rooms.
<P>The stall was huge by department store standards. There was plenty of room for Jon and Alexis to move around without hitting the walls or each other. One wall was covered in a floor-to-ceiling mirror. Jon was confronted by a full look at her new girlish self for the first time. It made her more frightened than she had already been.
<P>"Okay, ready?" Alexis asked. "Off with it. All of it."
<P>"This is humiliating!" Jon squeaked.
<P>"Yes, it is. Off." Alexis' eyes burned with aggravation. Had Jon's expectations come to pass, their roles would be reversed. Jon knew Alexis was going to love this every bit as much as he would have loved to see her transform into something sexy, silly, or degrading.
<P>Jon slowly, very slowly, removed her polo shirt. She felt the cool air on her soft breasts. The sight of the two mounds attached to her chest was both a horror and a marvel. She gingerly reached a hand up to her left breast and cupped it, feeling its weight and the warmth of her hand upon it.
<P>Next, she kicked off her shoes, not needing to untie them. She pulled down her pants with just as much ease. Her briefs fell off with them, and as she stepped out of them, her socks slipped away.
<P>Jon stared at her naked body, conflicting emotions swirling through her mind. She felt exposed, embarrassed, and wrong. She was afraid of her own body, and the new sensations it was giving her. But at the same time, she was somehow excited to have become a girl. A small part of her was keenly interested to see what experiences she was about to have. What made the ordeal easier was the knowledge that her situation would be quickly and easily reversed.
<P>Alexis, too, found herself drinking up the luscious details of Jon's new form. She hadn't realized how beautiful Jon had become. With her male clothes cast off, Jon's every inch of being exuded a distinct and alluring feminine aura. Her skin was smooth as silk, curved in just the right ways as if molded by careful, loving hands. There wasn't a single imperfection. Her body was completely hairless. Her feet were dainty and her hands delicate. Her face was cute and round, with pink cheeks, a button nose, and lips the color of ripe peaches. Her shiny blue eyes were adorned with luscious black eyelashes and topped with thin eyebrows. Her hair was a cherry brown. It glinted serenely in the light of the dressing room, and fell to her perfectly round ass like a waterfall. Long, slightly curvy bangs lovingly framed her face. Alexis had never been physically attracted to a woman in her life, and yet, the maiden before her eyes beckoned to her. She called for Alexis' tender touch and sweet embrace.
<P>Alexis bit her lip. She tried to believe it was the knowledge that her boyfriend's mind, heart and soul were intact inside that gorgeous vessel that caused her to feel such a profound attraction. She tore her eyes away from Jon's supple skin and her gaze rested on the bra and panties in her hand.
<P>"Okay...okay, enough gawking," she said, trying to make it sound like she was giving the order to Jon and not herself. "Here, I'll help you into these."
<P>Touching Jon's body was even more titillating than looking at it. She was so warm, so soft. The bra hugged her round breasts gently. The straps glided over her small shoulders like swirly icing trim on a cake. She could hear Jon's heavy breaths as she fixed the clasp, wondering if they were breaths of discomfort or something more...sensual.
<P>"Need help with these?" she asked Jon, holding up the pink panties.
<P>"No...no, I've got them," Jon said quietly.
<P>Jon took the underwear from Alexis and slowly slid it up her smooth legs. The bra felt tight but not restrictive. It felt good to have something supporting her breasts, keeping them in check. It was a strangely secure feeling.
<P>The panties slid against her crotch. It felt not unlike her man's underwear, except this time there wasn't any extra fleshy organs confined inside.
<P>She looked at herself in the mirror. Jon hated to admit it, but Alexis was right...these DID look good on her. If she had seen this body on the street, she'd have taken a good, long look at it.
<P>"What do you think, Jon?" Alexis asked.
<P>"I'd...rather not say," Jon said sheepishly.
<P>Alexis giggled. "Starting to come around to this whole thing? Why am I not surprised. Seriously, honey, you look astonishingly beautiful." Alexis couldn't help but give Jon a peck on the cheek. She was surprised Jon didn't recoil.
<P>"That name of yours is starting to seem less...appropriate," Alexis thought out loud. "We should probably call you something else while you're looking like this."
<P>"Jon sounds just fine," Jon insisted. "I've got to keep what little of my identity I have left."
<P>"Jen? Joan? Too simple," Alexis said teasingly. "Jasmine? Christine?" Jon looked at her with angry blue eyes.
<P>After a few more seconds' thought, Alexis cooed another name. "Angela. You're my darling angelic Angela."
<P>Jon pouted. "I'm nobody's 'darling' anything. And I sure as hell am not 'Angela.'"
<P>"Oh, you're so cute when you curse," Alexis smiled. She hugged her new girlfriend tightly.
<P>Jon grimaced, and not only at the strange sensation of Alexis' breasts smooshing up against her own. Angela was such a girly name. Yet...she kind of liked it. For one thing, it would help her feel more comfortable being in this body if she thought of herself as a different person. She kept seeing herself from the perspective of Jon, the man. If she just went along with the flow, it would probably make her experience as a woman less like torture and more like...fun.
<P>"Okay," Jon said, sighing under the tight grip of Alexis' arms, allowing herself to temporarily let go of the one thing that defined who she--HE--really was. "I'm Angela."
<P>"It's nice to know you, Angela," Alexis whispered back.</p>
