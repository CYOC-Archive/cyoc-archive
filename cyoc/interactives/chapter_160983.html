<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Routines changed and routines stayed the same in the Cabin. Once the happy couple stirred from their sleep later that morning they had a talk about Jess’ latest development. They both had to face the fact that needing to milk her would likely be a daily occurence; and taking a risk like that daily wasn’t in either of their best interest, not when they had just found those journals a few weeks back. While there was still some glimmer of hope to be found in those tomes, they had to be on their best behaviour. Jess had been slaving away for weeks at this point, she’d read them both cover to cover god knows how many times, employing some basic code breaker skills as she looked for common patterns all while trying to make a rudimentary alphabet. In the end they both agreed that an hour alone in the morning would be sufficient time for her to get started and clean up. Their new plan went into action effectively immediately.<br />
<br />
Henry and Jess sat opposite one another at the kitchen table, Jess’ stomach rumbled as she dragged her plate across the table, bringing it closer to her. Henry had to watch in amazement as his daughter eyed up the feast she’d layed out for herself. Half a dozen carrots piled up like a pyramid, cobs of corn, steaming and sweet, and an assortment of appes, pears and bananas; she’d even grabbed some hay from the barn. The hungry youth didn’t wait for Henry to start as she dug in, taking an apple from the pile and ravenously sinking her teeth in. Henry looked down at his own meager offerings, a bowl of muesli with some fruit smattered around it. He nervously poured milk over his breakfast, forcing his mind to filter out the events of yesterday before finally starting to eat. Henry finished well before Jess, standing up and disposing of his plate before deciding to start his morning routine early. “Jess baby, I’m going out. I’ll give you some time.” He said with a  smile, getting a distorted reply in response “Mhff Ofkay!” She mumbled back through stuffed cheeks.<br />
<br />
Henry walked out towards the Cabin’s exterior, his chest puffed out and his hands in his tracksuit pants’ pockets. The sun was just peaking over the trees on the horizon and for all intents and purposes today looked to be a good day. He inhaled, taking a deep breath of the nature around him, his nostrils immediately getting hit with the smell of fresh grass, still coated with a light morning dew. He paced around, letting his breakfast settle in when his own stomach began to rumble. He looked down at his stomach with an arched brow. “Come on, I ate enough didn’t I?” He mumbled, not wanting to go back inside and risk disturbing Jess. He paced around further, trying to stifle his growing appetite when he was hit again by the fresh smelling grass; his stomach rumbled once more. He stopped dead in his tracks. “Nooo…” He mumbled, realising what it was that was setting his stomach off. He stared down at the fresh grass, thinking of Jess who was readily eating Hay. “She seemed to like it so much, maybe this would be the same?” He thought, finding himself already getting down on his hands and knees, his new cock resting obviously against his tracksuit pants, gravity no longer forcing it down. “This might… Make her feel a little less weird…” He tried his best to rationalise the situation, that his face was inching closer to the ground, his mouth opening wide as he felt the cool grass brush past his lips. He bit down, ripping the grass from its roots as he sucked and chewed. The flavour was unlike anything he’d had before; smooth and damp, so refreshing! He wasn’t expecting to love it as much as he did, immediately dropping down for another bite. Suddenly the activity wasn’t so alien, it grew on him, the instinct spreading quickly as he slowly grazed. What felt like a few minutes stretched on to an hour until he felt the heat of the sun pushing down on him. Henry stood up, looking towards the sky in confusion. “But.. It was just behind the trees a moment ago…” He stammered, realising their glade was completely lit, the sun having marched further up in the sky. He brushed the dirt from his face, then from the knees of his pants before walking back to the house, peeking in the window to see an empty plate of fruit scraps and the door to their barn slightly ajar. “God… she’s finished already?! How long was I…?”<br />

Routines Changed and routines stayed the same in the cabin. Satisfied that the house was silent Joan roused from her Bed, beginning her nightly trip out to the forest perimeter. She’d grown to like her evening escapes, the thrill of sneaking out was something that she didn’t get to experience growing up; and this was well and truly making up for that. With the latest spat of warm evenings, Joan was pushing herself further than she had before, opting to leave her clothes behind, after all, they just served to get in her way. With a full bladder she disembarked, making her way to the far side of the glade, bladder pulsing and tail swaying in the warm evening breeze. She fell onto all fours not long before reaching the forest’s edge. It made her feel warm inside, trancing around on all fours; and this was her only time to do it without drawing ire from the others. They should be glad she’s doing this away from them. <br />
<br />
Joan waded into the forest, feeling the damp soil beneath her hands, feeling her hooves sink into some loose leaves. She let out a sigh of relief and finally relaxed herself. With no clothes she didn&#39;t worry about splashback, not that it bothered her much to begin with. Her cock spurred to life, pissing out a stream of pungent urine in front of her, while her pussy sprayed behind her. She felt the liquid splash against her hooves, coating her thighs, even her hands felt a little damp. But it made her feel good - so natural. She only wished the others saw things her way - Maybe Jennifer would one day, if things went according to plan. Finally Joans stream petered out, small dribbles were all that was left as she pivoted her hips, shaking her flaccid cock from anything that remained. Then she felt something touch her. <br />
<br />
Something hard pushed up against her rear. Her ears twitched like crazy, not knowing how something could have slipped her by so easily. She felt breath on her ass, warm blasts from someone&#39;s nose. &quot;Mhmm Jennifer honey is that you?&quot; Joan mumbled, the thrill of getting caught like this making her heart race. The thrill of having herself so bare, in the woods no less. &quot;Mhmm you scared me baby, you should have called. If you wanted to meet me in the woods you just had to ask…&quot; She cooed, before spinning around to see just who was behind her.</p>
