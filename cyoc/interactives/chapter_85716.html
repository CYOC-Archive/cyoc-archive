<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Closing his eyes Andrew muttered &quot;I wish to meet the girl of my dreams.&quot; <br />
<br />
He waited a few moments, then looked around the small empty room and let out his breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus, how stupid can I be, thinking this old thing could grant wishes.&quot; He glanced down at the card in his hand which now read &#39;Wish Granted.&#39;  Andrew nearly dropped it as he spun to look at the Magician game, then looked back to the card.  He turned it over to make sure it wasn&#39;t just double-sided, then walked to the doorway so he could look at it in better light.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!  Everything alright in there?&quot; a woman asked.  She had long brown hair and was wearing an &#39;All Your Base Arcade&#39; polo and a concerned look.  Andrew swallowed, his heart pounding, but while she looked good for a woman in her fifties, Andrew doubted she was the girl of his dreams.<br />
<br />
&quot;I ah, won a &#39;wish&#39; from the Magician game?&quot;  Andrew said hesitantly, feeling himself begin to blush.<br />
<br />
&quot;No kidding!  I tried that a couple times when Melody brought it in last week but couldn&#39;t get the hang of it.  Hold on will ya?&quot;  She touched a bluetooth headset and turned away to speak into it.<br />
<br />
Andrew squinted at the card, trying to see if it was printed with some sort of disappearing ink, but the letters appeared waxy and slightly embossed.  He wondered if maybe he&#39;d imagined it said something else because he&#39;d expected it to?  but that didn&#39;t make sense either.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Melody&#39;s on her way, I know she&#39;ll want to look at that card.  Here&#39;s a ticket for a free soda, might not be what you were hoping for, but it&#39;s better than nothing.&quot; the woman handed him a coupon and walked away to check on other customers.<br />
<br />
Andrew glanced at the card again and stepped back into the room.  He hadn&#39;t specified any timeframe, just that he&#39;d meet the girl of his dreams.  Part of him wanted to have another go at the game so he could win another wish, and maybe word this one better, but he already felt foolish enough believing the first one might come true.  He heard the pounding of running footsteps approaching.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohmygodisthatit?&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew was startled by the sudden voice, but moreso by the feeling of someone pressing herself against his back as she reached around him for the card he was holding. Aside from the light contralto voice and feminine arm he could see, Andrew had no doubts the person behind him was female thanks to the large pair of breasts rubbing against his shoulder blades.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um--&quot; Andrew froze, unsure what to do.  The girl grabbed his hand and hauled it up to where she could read it over his shoulder.  She was several inches taller than Andrew.  He tried to pull his hand away, but she was clearly stronger than he was and wasn&#39;t even straining to hold his hand still.  Andrew noted in passing that her short nails were unpainted and had motor grease under them.  He tried to step away and she caught him around the waist with her other arm and held him in place as she turned the card (and his hand) over to view the back. Andrew squirmed a bit at the pain from his wrist, then froze again realizing he was basically just grinding himself against her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Justletmecatchmybreath.&quot; <br />
<br />
Andrew felt the mystery woman, Melody?, lay her head on his shoulder as she leaned her weight against him and breathed raggedly against his neck.  The sensation of her breasts pressing rhythmically against him and her arm around him only added to the intimacy of the moment, and Andrew was dismayed to find himself becoming aroused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I ran from the loading bay, I--&quot;  She broke off as her arm around his waist slipped down to brush against Andrew&#39;s swelling erection.  She gripped his shaft through his pants and gave it a couple squeezes as if to verify it was what she thought it was.  &quot;I guess I don&#39;t need to apologize too much after all!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could you let me go, please?&quot; Andrew asked, then stepped away rubbing his wrist. <br />
<br />
When he turned to look at Melody his jaw literally dropped open.  She was clearly related to the woman he&#39;d seen earlier, had generous hips to balance her magnificent bust, long blond hair, high cheekbones, and wide lips.  She was flushed from running and was wiping off a sheen of sweat with a dirty rag she stuck into her back pocket.  She winked at him, then stuck out her tongue.<br />
<br />
Andrew blinked then closed his mouth.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I shouldn&#39;t have stared, it&#39;s just, I mean--&quot; He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. &quot;I&#39;m not used to beautiful women wrapping themselves around me and grabbing my junk.&quot;  He glanced ruefully at his crotch and noted a very clear handprint etched in motor oil on the front of his jeans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? Then what /did/ you wish for?&quot; Melody asked.  &quot;I couldn&#39;t get the box with the cards open when I cleaned out the game, so I&#39;ve been waiting for someone to win one.  Kinda anti-climatic if the manufacturer just assumed you&#39;d say your wish before playing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They didn&#39;t, I mean, look, don&#39;t think I&#39;m crazy okay?&quot; He glared at her, waiting until she responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooookay, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re crazy.&quot;  She said, leaning against an old claw machine. &quot;But I reserve the right to change my mind depending on what you&#39;re about to tell me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I, fine, whatever.  When I got the card, it said &#39;You Have Been Granted One Wish&#39; so I made a wish, and the next time I looked it said &#39;Wish Granted&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that does sound a bit crazy.&quot;  She took a step forward then stopped as Andrew reflexively backed up.  &quot;Look, I&#39;m sorry for getting in your personal space and grabbing your pecker--nice package by the way!--but I spent hours trying to win that stupid game and finally gave up, so when Mom said some cute boy had won a wish I kinda lost it.  Oh, uh, thanks for calling me beautiful?  Most guys aren&#39;t into women who are taller and stronger than they are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, thanks too?&quot;  Andrew glanced at the card again, but nothing had changed.  He rubbed at a couple oily fingerprints where Melody had grabbed his wrist.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how&#39;d you do it?  I tried timing the cams running its mouth, rigging it so the mouth couldn&#39;t close, even feeding a stream of quarters in so maybe one would slip through.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; I just shoved in a quarter and it went right in.&quot; Andrew shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Melody fished some change out of her pocket and offered it to him.  &quot;Lets see how lucky you can get!&quot;</p>
