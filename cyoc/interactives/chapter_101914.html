<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Perhaps you have,&quot; was Frances&#39; only real reply.<br />
<br />
There was a fair bit to Yvette&#39;s answers that weren&#39;t believable on many levels, particularly with regard to how Jennifer Harper was somehow responsible for Yvette&#39;s change in sexuality. That sort of thing was present among werecats, but not werefoxes, so while there were some werefoxes that were gay or bisexual, though not many, the fox strain of the were-virus didn&#39;t affect the sexuality of the normal changed. And even if it did, there were issues that Frances knew were there. When Yvette completed Jenny&#39;s transformation, both of them were already werefoxes and Yvette had been born a were. If anything it should have been Jenny that would be reporting changes in her sexuality, but Jenny wasn&#39;t. In fact, Jenny and Harry&#39;s bond seemed to be growing stronger since Jenny&#39;s transformation was completed. That was something that really couldn&#39;t be explained by the answers Yvette gave to Frances&#39; questions.<br />
<br />
However, at the same time, there was something in the way Yvette answered the questions that told Frances that while Yvette might not be factually correct, she was at least honest. That raised further questions on Frances&#39; part, but she honestly doubted that she&#39;d get any real answer from Yvette. It sounded as though she had grown up being told that the Earth was cubed and that the sky was green and never got any information that contradicted it and was now being asked on what the color of the sky was and what shape the Earth was. The answers given didn&#39;t make sense, but the conviction and honesty sounded right to Frances, and on some level that made Frances wonder on what to do with regard to the exact diagnosis. However, she did feel that regardless of what Yvette Smith&#39;s punishment for her misdeeds would be, she did deserve some closure with regard to her family.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... is that all?&quot; Yvette asked to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be about all that we can work with for my suggestion to the DA and the court,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;which has gone quicker than I had expected.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what do you think?&quot; Yvette wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way... I&#39;m not sure if there is an actual problem that requires some form of medication or continued therapy,&quot; Frances said slowly, &quot;but based on what you&#39;ve told me... I think I can understand WHY you made the decisions you did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry for what I did...&quot; Yvette spoke.<br />
<br />
Frances nodded, &quot;Though in the meantime... as I said earlier, there are some things that you deserve closure on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot; Yvette wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;With family issues,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;and tomorrow... before I make my final recognition, we&#39;ll get you cleaned up and dressed and set a meeting that will hopefully give you some closure with regard to some of the things in your life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yvette only blinked and then nodded as Frances collected her things and made her way out of the room. As she made her way out of the room she gave some instructions that Yvette be clean and ready for transport to meet with Bart Smith and the revelation that her uncle was also her biological father. She wasn&#39;t fully sure on how well that would go, but Frances felt that Yvette did deserve to know WHO her father was, and questioned why Bart never did more to try and explain things to Yvette. Things in the Smith family might not have been great, but there was a lot more that Bart could have done. She privately thought that Margaret Smith could have and probably should have done better by her daughter with regard honesty, but with Margaret Smith being deceased, Frances knew she wouldn&#39;t get that conversation.<br />
<br />
As she made her way out of the hospital, she carefully picked her cellphone out of her purse and dialed her wife&#39;s number. She heard Samantha&#39;s voice answer a few moments later.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up, honey?&quot; Samantha asked through the phone as she answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing much,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;Just got through enough wit Yvette Smith to begin putting together a report on her mental state.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds fast... didn&#39;t you have one more day scheduled?&quot; Samantha wondered, &quot;At least I think you told me that you had another day scheduled.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; Frances answered with a nod, &quot;but I managed to get through the things that were scheduled for today and tomorrow... today. There are some things that I&#39;d like to handle with regard to tomorrow, but that&#39;s more for Yvette&#39;s own future benefit and more a consequence of the case, not necessary to it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This thing with her uncle/father... her fancle?&quot; Samantha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cute,&quot; Frances replied, &quot;but yes... her... fancle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, dare I ask what you&#39;ve determined?&quot; Samantha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think there was anything necessarily wrong with her mind in the sense of there being anything clinical,&quot; Frances said carefully, &quot;but she&#39;s had a very difficult life that didn&#39;t really give her the sort of guidance needed to be on the right path. Thus, when she made poor decisions... she had nothing to help her turn it around. By the time she realized she needed to get out... most of those who knew her had formed a pretty negative opinion of her and that limited the sort of help she could get from them...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which made her target William Anderson in the first place as he was an adult male who didn&#39;t know of her reputation,&quot; Samantha said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And considering how... strained his marriage was when the Andersons first moved here, she figured that William would actually jump at the chance to be with someone who wasn&#39;t arguing with him on things,&quot; Frances nodded, &quot;as by this time, she was trying to find someone to be with on a more permanent basis... but without support or interest... she grew desperate. That desperation is what made her not only pick William Anderson but likely why she obsessed over him. She was desperate for real love and couldn&#39;t take &quot;no&quot; as it would only be another &quot;defeat&quot; that would leave her alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances heard her wife sigh through the phone before continuing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything on why she&#39;s claiming to be a lesbian?&quot; Samantha asked curiously, &quot;anything that relates to the case?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing that really relates to the case itself or proves anything,&quot; Frances gave a sigh of her own, &quot;and none that makes even logical sense, considering everything we know about were-biology... but at the same time she is honest in her answers. She isn&#39;t lying or trying to deceive anyone in that regard. Questioning her more isn&#39;t going to change anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wonderful,&quot; Samantha commented, &quot;more questions than answers and no one can answer them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though... on the plus side, she does seem genuinely apologetic for her mistakes and wanting to turn her life around,&quot; Frances commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that will make things better for her...&quot; Samantha commented, &quot;though...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That could be up to a hundred years from now, given her clawing William Anderson and Jennifer Smith,&quot; Frances commented, &quot;hopefully, she can keep things together when that happens.&quot;</p>
