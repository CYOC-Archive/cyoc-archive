<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For a moment Oscar just stood there stunned, not sure what he would do. His now mermaid girlfriend had told him to meet her on the other side of this small island for what he was sure was sex. If the mermaid Temela was to be believed Lindsay was now a type of merperson called a siren which craved sex more than a normal merperson. <br />
<br />
In the end he had two choices, he either stood Lindsay up and still transformed into merperson or he went over to his girlfriend had sex and likely become whatever he was going to become faster. In the end he turned and headed away from the group and walked up over the small sand dune which ran down the center of the island. The dune was only five or six feet high and went right back down toward sea. <br />
What he saw laying on her side with one hand holding up her head, waiting for him was the transformed Lindsay. She had always been beautiful to him, but now she took his breath away, her frame stayed about the same but her small breasts which even she complained about in private to him were now much larger and perky. Her eyes seamed to glow with love and lust as he came closer toward her, her long and beautiful red and bronze tail stood out as she lied just beyond the surf line. That should have creeped him out, but it now turned him on, was it another sign of the change. <br />
<br />
He lied down beside her, he had always had a good foot on her but now thanks to the tail she was longer even if from the hips up she remained the same height. He mimics her position with one hand holding up his head as if they were lying in bed together instead of on the beach.<br />
<br />
“I know you think I have become a sex crave manic….” Said Lindsay her voice even sounding like it belonged in the bedroom “And you are right I really want to jump you then and there, but that isn’t something I would want to do in public and it isn’t something you would want. If you don’t want to do this I will under…”<br />
<br />
She never got to say another word as he leaned forward and kissed her new fuller mermaid lips. It was as if a bolt of lightning went off in both their minds but most of all Lindsay’s. As a serine she felt the burning need for him much more accurately then before. She pulled him off the sand and on top of her, with her new strength that was easy enough for her to do. She pulled him into a deep kiss while he placed both his hands gently on either side of her new longer neck, gently caressing it. <br />
<br />
Both of them closed their eyes and began to moan, all the while Oscar’s change began to pick up. Maybe it was speeding up because of the sex or maybe it was because he had been splashed as well by the ocean water when Mike went for his first swim. <br />
<br />
Both of Lindsay’s hands moved down and all but ripped her boyfriend’s swim trunks off him, freeing his manhood which was standing at attention and looked harder than any time Lindsay had ever seen it. While Oscar didn’t have the largest dick she had ever seen, if she was telling the truth he was slightly on the small side, but she always loved how it felt in her hand and she really loved playing with his balls. <br />
She smiled a playful smile, as they parted for a moment and then with strength which she wouldn’t have as a human, she pushed Oscar who was lying on top of her up and above her head. Oscar almost face planted into the sand, but it brought Lindsay face to face with his dick. She licked the tip which trembled as Oscar let out a moan before she took him into her mouth.<br />
<br />
Oral was something Lindsay did very rarely, she preferred doing a hand job while kissing him and she only did oral on special events like his birthday, anniversary and so on. <br />
<br />
“Lindsay…oh…my…God.” moaned Oscar as his girlfriend gave him oral.<br />
<br />
Lost in the pleasure he failed to notice his body begin to change at a rapid pace, his dark brown hair began to shift becoming a bright Kelly-green/lime color as his eyes changed color as well turning an impossible bright green as well. His olive skin, a clear sign of his Mediterranean/Turkish heritage became smooth and clean of every flaw. His face become more masculine even as the short beard he was trying and failing to grow fell out, becoming smooth faced again. <br />
<br />
His chest while never fat he could have lost five pounds or so, he never had a six pack or the like but during sex Lindsay could always feel the muscles under the skin. Those muscles came out as he became much more muscular, it wasn’t the equal of Mike when he transformed but he was quickly becoming the equal of a Hollywood actor in looks. <br />
<br />
Lindsay kept giving him oral, his manhood growing in her mouth as it transformed as his new tail began to form. She gave his balls one last play before they went inside his new single limb, which caused some sadness because she loved playing with them however his dick had grown and was getting to the point it was hard for her to keep it in her mouth. She pulled out giving it a slight kiss on the tip before rolling over so that Oscar was on the ground. This was the first time she got to see how her boyfriend had transformed from the waste up and she loved it. <br />
<br />
With his transformation as far along as it was, he was now stronger than her and while from the knee down he still had his legs and so far no scales had come in his tail was coming along nicely. <br />
<br />
Using her own strength and flexibility she positioned herself so that her womenhood was hovering just above his dick. <br />
<br />
Both let out load moans as she slid down on top of him, letting his massive new dick inside her. It was so tight but felt so good. She began to go up and down on top of him, using her tail like she would her legs, it was harder than it would have been with legs, but she imagined in the water it would be better and she could do things they couldn’t on land. <br />
<br />
Oscar was holding onto her hips for a moment moaning her name, then suddenly his hands where on her back as he bent up and began kissing her chest and playing with her beasts. It felt so good, she failed to notice that Oscar’s tail fully formed, and it looked to be the classic tail, however it still lacked scales. Once it formed the multiple small fins, she had all moved slightly to latch onto Oscar’s tail as best as it could.<br />
<br />
Then coming out of his hips two more limbs began to form, two dolphin line flippers, much larger then anything Lindsay had formed and they latched onto her as well pulling her closer to him. <br />
<br />
“OSCAR!!!” screamed Lindsay as she neared her climax<br />
<br />
“LINDSAY!!!” screamed Oscar as he finally felt his climax come.<br />
<br />
Both happened nearly as one, his hot seed shot into her while she let out a stratified moan. All the while the skin on his tail didn’t grow scales but instead the skin from the waste down shifted color. Taking on a pattern which reminded both of them of a killer whale tail, only instead of black and white it was a deep Kelly green and a white/cream color. <br />
<br />
None of that mattered as Lindsay fell down onto her boyfriend’s new chest, breathing heavily as they both came down from that high.<br />
<br />
“That was amazing.” Said Oscar in a breathless tone.<br />
<br />
“Yes…” confirmed Lindsay as a wave crashed over them, they had moved close enough to the water but neither cared. </p>
