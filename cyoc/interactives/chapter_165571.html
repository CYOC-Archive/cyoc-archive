<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She realized she wanted someone kind, someone good, so she looked to those semi-males who had refused to take a female against her will.  Those who did not fight or who were undecided were not bothered by the tendrils, but those who tried to put a stop to things were restrained.  As she approached the group of semi-males, wearing nothing but her ill-fitting male shirt, she felt every eye turn to her, most of them roaming up and down her curvaceous figure.  She looked into every one of their eyes, seeking a person worthy to own her.  At last she stopped at one dog-boy, neither the biggest nor seemingly the bravest as tears streamed down from his eyes from where he sat on the ground, after all he&#39;d have those things once he took them from her.  So what was important was that he looked the kindest. His eyes had a light and warmth to them that was clear even through his tears. She knelt before him, and to test him she unbuttoned her shirt and removed it.  She pressed her breasts forward, but said nothing.  His eyes widened at the sight, but he only looked for a moment before returning his gaze to yours.  &quot;Do you...still have your will?&quot;  He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We saw you.  Why did you do this to yourself?  They weren&#39;t forcing you.&quot;<br />
<br />
She blushed a bit.  &quot;Well, I could say that it was because they&#39;d have done me if I didn&#39;t do myself so there really wasn&#39;t a choice after all, but, the truth is I&#39;m just a slut.  I always was.&quot;<br />
<br />
His face reddened  &quot;What do you want with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you too take me, of course.  Become my man, my master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you seen the other girls who were taken?&quot; he said in shock.  &quot;They&#39;re slaves!  You can&#39;t possibly want-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I do.&quot;  she said as she began to crawl towards him seductively, waving her ass that she was so proud of back and forth.  &quot;I want to be your slave, your own personal fucktoy, your little slut who satisfies your every desire.  I need it.  Won&#39;t you give me what I need?&quot;  Her hand sneaked towards his crotch and he made no move to stop her as she grasped it and began to massage it through his clothing.  &quot;This is what I need.  No girly fingers, no magical dildo, just real, hard, manly cock.  It&#39;s the only thing that can satisfy me, and I&#39;ll have it even if I have to give up my freedom.  Call me Sophia.&quot;<br />
<br />
His breathing was growing heavy now, and she could feel his bulge growing.<br />
<br />
&quot;This...this isn&#39;t right.&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmmm it feels right to me,&quot; she purred as she lifted his skirt, &quot;Maybe you&#39;d feel better if you took off those tight panties.  They aren&#39;t meant for someone with a cock.  The poor thing must feel so cramped!&quot;<br />
<br />
It might have something to do with magic, but one way or another his lust for the sex goddess was growing too strong to resist much, but he tried to offer something of a fight.  &quot;But I&#39;m a girl!&quot;  he cried as his panties were pulled down and his erection sprung free.<br />
<br />
&quot;A girl?&quot;  she asked.  &quot;Girls don&#39;t get erections when other girls come on to them.  I recognize you now.  Brenda Hill?  I seriously doubt you were a lesbian.  No, this lust I see now is the lust of a boy, Brandon.   And why not be a boy?  Isn&#39;t it amazing, having a cock? Having this special thing that grows bigger and harder like that?  Doesn&#39;t it feel good?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yes...&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me make it feel better.&quot; she said, and she lowered her head to meet his cute little member.  Her heart beat in her chest at the thought of what she was going to do.  Sucking her first cock was yet another way to reaffirm her womanhood.  She was lusting, but suddenly she felt a little shy, and she knew she was probably blushing, but as she took the musty scent of his penis into her nostrils she knew she wanted it, and she experimentally extended her tongue to lick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god...&quot; he groaned, and the sound of his lust turned her on all the more, this power she had over him in her very submission, was a rush.  She kept licking, savoring the taste, savoring her position of service beneath him, and savoring the lust she knew that was triggering.  She gave his tip a tender kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;How does it make you feel?&quot;  She asked.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I feel...powerful!  It&#39;s hard to think straight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What does it make you want to do?&quot; She asked as she looked into his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;It makes me want to...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck me, right?&quot;  Her tone was innocent and casual, but the words she spoke were anything but.  &quot;It makes you want to violate all of my holes and leave them dripping with your seed, right?  Makes you want to use me as your cocksleave, make me your bitch?  Pound me until I scream your name and belong to you completely?&quot;<br />
<br />
He blushed fiercely, but he nodded. In response she sat back and spread her legs to reveal her dripping new sex. She looked at him expectantly.  &quot;I&#39;m waiting.&quot;</p>
