<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Anna flicked her tail at Randy as she turned away from the barn. Food could certainly wait, she needed the heat in her loins to be sated by a stud. She gave him a slight whinny as she exposed her winking slit at him. &quot;Come on, let&#39;s go this way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, I thought we were going to get something to eat,&quot; Randy said, a bit surprised at Anna&#39;s forwardness. &quot;This looks more like we&#39;re going to the stables...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, we are,&quot; Anna said as she nuzzled him gently, her pheromones were now driving him wild as his large shaft had reached its full length. It was such a shame that he was only a guest, a stud like this would keep the mares of the resort very happy. But now he was all her&#39;s, and she was going to enjoy her first mating. &quot;I was thinking I could give you a special private lesson.&quot;<br />
<br />
It took Randy a moment to realize what she meant. &quot;Are you sure you want this? I mean, what if you... you know... I won&#39;t be here to help since I&#39;m leaving in a few days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re still thinking like a human, Randy,&quot; Anna nickered as she turned and kept walking towards her stall. &quot;We mares need a stud sure, but we&#39;re well taken care of here. The resort and the herd will take care of me and the foal. Though I&#39;d be lying if I said I didn&#39;t want you to stay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if I wanted to stay?&quot; Randy asked. &quot;If we were...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunately it doesn&#39;t quite work like that,&quot; Anna sighed. This was something that always seemed hard to explain to guests. &quot;Yes, couples when they conceive a child they will have the chance to stay until they&#39;re born. But when the mother was born here like I was, then... well...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I see,&quot; Randy said as they stopped in front of the section of the Stables that was given to the worker animals. Anna smiled as she pushed the door open and led Randy inside. It was a cozy but fairly spacious stall with pictures of other horses and a few humans along the walls. &quot;This is, nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Anna said as she turned her back to him once more and raised her tail to reveal her winking slit to Randy. &quot;Come on you stud. Stick that big cock in me. Just let your body do what comes naturally.&quot;<br />
<br />
Randy looked at her for a moment. He could smell her heat and could feel his loins stir. He had fantasized about this ever since he had met the mare. When he was human he had never thought about mating with a horse, but ever since this had started it was the only thing he could think of.<br />
<br />
Anna let out a whinny as she felt his weight fall onto her back. He tried to thrust into her, but because he wasn&#39;t used to his horse body he missed his mark. He let out an annoyed snort but Anna adjusted herself so the rookie stud would be able to thrust into her. He tried again and she let out a whinny of pleasure as she felt the flared tip of his shaft penetrate her.<br />
<br />
Randy was new to sex in either form, but he listened to what Anna had told him. He gave in to the animal side of his new body as he began to thrust in and out of her. It felt so good, so natural as he thrust in and out of his mare. It felt so good to give in to his animal side and he threw his head back and neighed as his large balls bobbed back and forth. What he would give to be able to live like this forever.<br />
<br />
Anna had never experienced anything like this before. She felt jolts of electricity running up and down her spine as she felt his thrusts pick up speed. She whinnied as he hilted her, completely consumed by the pleasure of being mounted and bred. Her instincts were going wild as the stallion&#39;s balls slapped against her. They were no longer a guide and her charge, they were now a breeding pair of horses, and it felt so natural.<br />
<br />
Randy let out a loud neigh as he slammed into her one last time and his shaft throbbed with pleasure before shooting out white strands of semen into her womb. He let out a surprised whinny when he felt her vaginal muscles clamp down on him and draw out as much of his cum as she could.<br />
<br />
The two horses just stood there for a long moment before Randy dismounted from Anna and nuzzled her gently. &quot;That was... that was something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, agreed,&quot; Anna said as she flicked her tail a bit, feeling the combined juices leak out of her a bit as she nuzzled against Randy. It was a shame he wouldn&#39;t get to stay, but that was how things worked out. &quot;You were wonderful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Randy said. The two just stayed that for the longest time, lost in thoughts and in the memory of what they had done together.</p>
