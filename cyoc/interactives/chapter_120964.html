<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake sauntered into school confidently. Despite the sniffling in his nose, he was feeling pretty good about today. Football conditioning was tonight which meant he could start working out more. With the seniors graduating soon, their presence had been steadily dwindling as the end of the school year got closer. That meant juniors like Jake could start taking control of the locker room and the weight room. In the back of his mind, Jake also found it a plus that, as one of the strongest juniors on the team, he could tone down some of the hostilities towards the &quot;others&quot; in the school. Nobody knew that Jake&#39;s uncle was a fag, a word that Jake&#39;s uncle proudly uses to describe himself. If the word was used as an insult, even Jake was slightly bothered by it. He regretted what happened to that puny freshman he and the seniors picked on just for making eye contact with one of the seniors.<br />
<br />
Jake shook the thoughts from his head and smiled as he passed the senior lockers, where most of the senior football players were chatting with their cheerleader girlfriends. One girl, Jen, kept her eyes locked on Jake as he walked by. He slowed down a bit and gave the beautiful girl a wink. And then, from out of nowhere, Jake sneezed. Thankfully, he managed to aim at the ground and not in Jen&#39;s face. He looked back up at her. She was laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really know how to charm a girl, Smith,&quot; she said. Jake chuckled and continued walking towards the locker room. He did not notice Jen turn to her locker and look at herself appreciatively in the mirror. He smiled at Dustin, a fellow junior on the team, who just said goodbye to his girlfriend, Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;So is that the new flirting move?&quot; Dustin, a fellow junior asked Jake. &quot;A wink and a sneeze is the way to a girl&#39;s heart?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t knock it until you try it,&quot; Jake said, elbowing Dustin. They walked into the locker room and began dropping their workout clothes into their respective lockers. A few of the seniors entered the locker room as they did so. Jake sniffed several times while Dustin and Jake were silent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah there, Sniffles, you coming down with a cold?&quot; Dustin asked. He sat down on the bench to take off his snow boots.<br />
<br />
&quot;Must be,&quot; Jake said. &quot;Could explain why I sneezed.&quot; He took off his shirt. Dustin gave him a look. &quot;Hey, the upstairs classrooms are always a sauna when the heat is on in this place!&quot; Jake glanced down at his shirtless torso. His heart rate jumped a little. He never really appreciated his body enough. He glanced in a mirror and felt a thrill go down in his spine. Man, he was hot! Jake rubbed his six-pack. It felt amazing on his fingers. His hand moved up to his pecs. He cupped a feel. Nice, firm, and toned. He looked up at his face. He watched as his own reflection bit its lips. It was such a shame that they were his own lips. What he would do to be able to kiss those lips himself. He felt his cock start to throb in response, and his eyes drifted downward. In the reflection, the bulge looked tantalizingly good. &quot;I bet my O-face is hot,&quot; he thought to himself. His left hand began to drift towards his crotch while his right hand massaged his pecs.<br />
<br />
&quot;EARTH TO JAKE SMITH!&quot; Dustin shouted, snapping Jake out of it. He realized that he must have looked odd just standing there groping his own sexy body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Jake said. He lowered his voice to a whisper, &quot;Guess I got a bit worked up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A bit worked up?!&quot; Dustin asked, almost laughing. &quot;Dude, if I hadn&#39;t said anything, you would have jacked off to your own reflection!&quot; He glanced at the mirror, too. &quot;Not that I blame you. Your body is damn sexy. But it&#39;s nothing compared to this embodiment of sexual attraction.&quot; Dustin groped his crotch. &quot;This body of mine is hot. Way hotter than yours, which is saying something.&quot; Jake couldn&#39;t understand Dustin. How could Dustin&#39;s body be sexier than his own? Sure, Dustin had the height and width, but Jake was ripped, shredded even. Jake and Dustin were both now boning up to their own bodies. Jake glanced over at Grant and Austin, two senior linebackers. They had shucked off their clothes and were massaging their own bodies in appreciation too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems like everyone in here likes what God has given them,&quot; Jake whispered to Dustin. Dustin couldn&#39;t peel his eyes off of himself from the mirror and only grunted in response, his hand openly massaging his dick. Then, from out of nowhere, Jake sneezed again, managing to turn away from Dustin. He looked back himself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
Shock and horror spread through him like a wildfire, and his dick went limp almost instantly. Kyle Perkins cursed him! And he cursed him with a cold! And not just any cold! A cold that caused changes in people with sneezing. But what were the changes? So far, he had only sneezed twice. Once in the hallway, and now in here.<br />
<br />
He stared at himself in the mirror, taking a hand off of his chest. He had been massaging it. He had thought that his body was hot. So hot that he wanted to jack off to it. He had even wanted to kiss his own lips. He glanced back at Austin and Grant. They were now eyeing each other&#39;s bodies with need and desire. It was a look that they had previously held for their own bodies.<br />
<br />
&quot;So the cold makes guys gay?&quot; Jake thought to himself. But that didn&#39;t quite make sense. Gay people typically don&#39;t want to make out with their own bodies. Plus, while he found himself appreciative of Grant and Austin&#39;s bodies, he didn&#39;t have the burning desire for his own body merely a minute ago. Where had it gone? He looked at Dustin.<br />
<br />
Dustin had been staring at him through the mirror. He slowly turned to face Jake. Jake felt the familiar thrill again, and his cock began to harden.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dustin is so sexy,&quot; Jake thought, unconsciously licking his lips. His heart began to pound in his chest. The look of desire on Dustin&#39;s face seemed to intensify. Without another thought, the two of them closed the distance between their lips. They both moaned into each other&#39;s mouths. Jake grabbed Dustin&#39;s waist and pulled him closer so he could run his hands over Dustin&#39;s broad back. Dustin&#39;s hands meanwhile began massaging Jake&#39;s butt, cupping and kneading the muscular twin globes with his thick hands.<br />
<br />
Then,</p>
