Meanwhile… <br />
<br />
“This is so fracking frustrating!” Nate groaned. He threw himself back against the couch, and buried his face into a pillow. Alex and Ben laughed at Nate’s frustration, as math came naturally to them. Eric merely pointed out where his brother’s mistakes where. Cassie thanked her lucky stars her boyfriend knew what he was doing, because she could barely handle Pre-Algebra. She was dreading having to tackle Algebra 2. <br />
<br />
The five werewolves had formed a study group, not intentionally but as it turned out everyone needed help with certain bits of homework. They’d decided to work at the Anderson’s house, since it was empty at the moment, and the closest house to school.<br />
<br />
Things were going well for the teenagers. Alex, Cassie and Eric were all whizzes at science, while Nate and Ben each had a leg up in English and history respectively. And they all stunk at language. So between them, they figured they could at least scrap a C+ in most of their classes. As it was, Nate was barely passing his science and math classes. <br />
<br />
“Latin isn’t so bad once you get the hang grammar.” Ben remarked, mulling over his Latin homework. <br />
<br />
“I don’t know why you bother with Latin. You’re not going to be a doctor or anything, what’s the point?” Nate asked. <br />
<br />
“It’s more challenging than Spanish.” <br />
<br />
“You’re a bigger nerd than Eric.” <br />
<br />
Eric let that comment go over his head. He got up and asked if anyone else wanted a drink. Cassie followed him into the kitchen. The two shared a private moment, passionately kissing each other. Eric let one hand slide down to open the refrigerator door, while the other was busy pulling Cassie’s body closer to his own. <br />
<br />
“Down boy. You’ve got company over.” Cassie reminded him. Eric’s erection was pressed against her stomach, but somehow the two managed to keep from ripping their clothing off. <br />
<br />
“Right. So how was your day?” Eric asked in an attempt to change the subject. And maybe redirect some of his attention away from the alluring scent in the air. <br />
<br />
“Other than the incessant questions, great.” Cassie said. <br />
<br />
“People were bugging you too huh? Maybe I shouldn’t have said anything.” Eric didn’t think about how his “speech” during lunch would effect the others. Nate had already told Eric how after his stunt, Nate was being badgered by lots of girls. Of course Nate was probably exaggerating. <br />
<br />
“No, it’s not your fault. Rumors were bound to spread regardless of you standing up for yourself. Besides, it was mostly just girls asks me if you’re a sweet and sensitive as they think you are.”<br />
<br />
“Huh, a bunch of girls was asking Nate that same question. Only I think they were more interested in if HE was as sweet and sensitive as me.” Eric chuckled. <br />
<br />
“Well, I can’t speak for Nate, but you are perfect for me.” The kiss Cassie gave Eric soon turned into something more intimate. Eric’s hand went under Cassie’s shirt to cup her breasts. He continued to press his body against hers, his boyhood feeling very constricted in his jeans. <br />
<br />
Finally, Cassie stopped kissing Eric, and took a step back. Eric gave her a sort of “puppy dog” look. <br />
<br />
“That would have been more effective if you actually had the right face to go with the look. Don’t worry, we can play later.” Cassie smiled, and kissed Eric’s cheek. She returned to the living room, teasingly shaking her bottom as if she were in her lupine form and had a tail to lure Eric by. Boy was Eric was glad there was a cold soda in his hand. Because he was in serious need to cooling off. <br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
An hour or so later… <br />
<br />
Ben Twist left the Anderson’s house when things started to get fairly heated inside the living room. They’d all finished their homework, which left their minds focused on the stirrings in their pants. Alex and Nate ducked out of the house first, using the excuse that Alex’s parents had invited Nate over to dinner and they wanted to start walking over. <br />
<br />
And not wanting to be a third wheel, Ben left Eric and Cassie gazing into each other’s eyes with such intensity Ben wondered if they could see through each other. He felt a little left out, with no one to “play” with, until he remembered the note Sasha gave him via Megan. <br />
<br />
Ben’s hand went to his pocket, where the piece of paper was still kept. She had said she’d be free around seven, so Ben would have to wait a while. And Mrs. O’Sullivan was at work. What was a horny werewolf to do but take matters into his own hands? <br />
<br />
“Everyone has someone to spend their nights with. Maybe I should start seriously looking for a mate.” Ben sighed. He wandered the streets, the mid-afternoon sun beating down on his back. Ben eventually found himself walking past the elementary school playground. There he saw someone chasing a little golden haired girl around the swings. <br />
<br />
“Sasha?” Ben saw her come out from under a bush, and grab the little girl. As Sasha swung the giggling child around, she caught sight of Ben and stopped moving. Ben walked up to the two, wondering why Sasha was playing with some kid. <br />
<br />
“Ben, hi! What are you doing here?” she asked, setting the girl back down on the ground. <br />
<br />
“Just out for a walk. What about you? Who’s your friend?” Ben knelt down to look at the golden haired child. She couldn’t have been more than five or six. <br />
<br />
“This is Lauren. I babysit her on weekdays. Her parents work odd hours, and they need someone to watch her for two or three hours a day while no one is home.” Sasha explained. <br />
<br />
“You’re big!” Lauren laughed at Ben. He smiled, and took a quick sniff, confirming his suspicions that the child was normal. <br />
<br />
“That’s just what happens when you eat lots of vegetables.” Ben joked. <br />
<br />
“Are you Sasha’s boyfriend?” <br />
<br />
“No, just friends.” Sasha corrected Lauren rather quickly. Ben glanced up with an  eyebrow raised. Sasha didn’t meet his gaze, but Ben would have sworn she was blushing a little.</p>
