<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I didn&#39;t read the rest of the branch leading up to this so no idea if there are other rules or if I got some details wrong.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking between large puddle of cum on the ground outside, Cody’s fat floppy dick and the balloon, Jim had a wicked thought.<br />
<br />
“Sure, just as promised I’ll make your penis smaller again.” He inflated the balloon and whispered so Cody could barely make it out. “Control Cody’s <i>flaccid</i> penis size”<br />
<br />
Jim let out all the air so that the giant soft hog shrank down to a modest 3 incher resting comically on top of a pair of gigantic sagging testicles.<br />
<br />
“Finally,” Cody gasped between breaths “now can I try the balloon and fix my balls?”<br />
<br />
“I’ll let you control the balloon in a bit. But you look exhausted,” Jim gave the release command and guided Cody over to a chair. “I don’t think you have enough breath to inflate it, just lie down and rest a bit first.”<br />
<br />
Cody was too tired to argue and what Jim had said made sense. He laid down on Jim’ bed, and even though he just planned to rest his eyes for a bit, the exhaustion came over him again and he quickly passed out. While Cody was unconcious Jim grabbed a few belts and cables from his closet and secured Cody’s arms and legs to the bedposts so he couldn’t move.<br />
<br />
“Control Cody’s semen production rate” Jim whispered and blew into the balloon a few times. Cody’s spent balls slowly shifted as they began to fill up again. “Release”<br />
<br />
He emptied all the air out again, then carefully stretched the opening of the balloon over Cody’s soft 3 inch penis and pulled a blanket over the top so Cody wouldn’t see it. Now came the tricky bit.<br />
<br />
“Cody wake up!” Jim gave Cody a few shakes and Cody groaned slowly opening his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Oh sorry I must’ve dozed off. Can I have the balloon now?”<br />
<br />
“Sure thing Cody, I’ll let you control the balloon” Jim said barely able to contain his excitement “But I’ve got a new idea. You should make the balloon control your level of arousal.”<br />
<br />
“Huh? Why?” Cody was still groggy and hadn’t even noticed he was tied up.<br />
<br />
“Why what?” Jim asked, feigning a look of confusion.<br />
<br />
“Why do you want it to ‘Control my level of arousal’?”<br />
<br />
After Cody inadvertently spoke the command words, Jim shoved a pair of old underwear into his mouth and wrapped duct tape over his lips and around the back of his head a few times to secure it. Jim then pulled the blanket off. The sudden flurry of action fully awakened Cody as he tried to get up but found his limbs restrained.<br />
<br />
“MFF UNNIN NNN?” (What’s going on?) he tried to ask through the gag.<br />
<br />
But Jim ignored him, now all he needed to do was give Cody’s dick a little start. He rubbed the tip of the flaccid dick and watched it slowly grow half an inch.<br />
<br />
And that was all it needed.<br />
<br />
As Cody’s penis grew to four inches, the balloon stretched and Cody became more aroused, which caused his penis to grow to five inches, which caused the balloon to stretch, which caused Cody to become more aroused, which caused his penis to grow to six inches, which caused the balloon to stretch, which caused Cody to become more aroused, which caused his penis to grow to seven inches, which caused the balloon to stretch…<br />
<br />
That was when Cody realized what had happened. <br />
<br />
“NNNNN RNFFF RNFFF” (Nooo! Release! Release!) He tried to deactivate the balloon but it was no use. Every second his cock continued to expand and every time it did he became more aroused. At a foot long Cody could feel his cock throbbing with excitement, begging to experience another blissful ejaculation.<br />
<br />
“Fuck this is amazing” Jim was standing nearby completely engrossed by the self sustaining erection, “I bet no one in the world has ever been as horny as you are right now, imagine what it will feel like when you’re fully erect”<br />
<br />
Of course Cody didn’t have to imagine, he watched in horror as his monstrous cock continued to grow, straining against the flimsy rubber that was still somehow holding together. It didn’t take long before it reached it’s full two and a half foot size and was once again solid as a pipe. It stuck straight up in the air, proud and throbbing with an urgent need to ejaculate.<br />
<br />
Cody whimpered with temporary relief. Though he was still unbelievably horny, at least his cock had reached it’s maximum size. If he hadn’t already spent his entire load earlier Cody was sure he could ejaculate with no extra physical contact. Of course unbeknownst to him, his balls were building up pressure as they produced an ever growing reservoir of cum.<br />
<br />
“Now for part two!” Jim watched with anticipation “Any moment now, you’re going to experience the best orgasm of your life!”<br />
<br />
Cody’s eyes went wide, as he tried to beg Jim not to wank him off again. But after half a minute he realized that would not be necessary as he felt something climbing up the base of his cock. The very familiar sensation of a penis edging towards orgasm. His eyes went wide and he tried to hold back as best he could, screaming and begging through the bundle of cotton in his mouth to be let go.<br />
<br />
Despite his best efforts a large squick of precum oozed from the tip of Cody&#39;s gigantic cock. And that was all it took to start the process again. As the precum filled the tip of the balloon he became more aroused, causing him to leak more precum, causing the balloon to grow, causing him to be more aroused, and so on and so forth until... <br />
<br />
“HHHMMMMFFFFFFFGHGHGGH”<br />
<br />
He ejaculated. A powerful shot of thick white semen filled the tip of the balloon quickly expanding it and by association his arousal. Unlike any other orgasm he had experienced, his ejaculations grew stronger with each emission, filling in the balloon and inflating it further. After a dozen or so powerful loads he was no longer releasing semen in volleys but instead a steady stream as though he was pissing out cum.<br />
<br />
Cody bucked and screamed, trying to find an escape from his never ending consonantly growing unbearable stimulation. With each movement the jizz balloon wobbled back and forth but continued to cling tightly around his cock.<br />
<br />
Jim watched in manic glee as the balloon continued to swell with the white liquid, pouring from Cody’s enormous thirty inch erection like a faucet. Soon his penis was entirely enveloped in cum but the balloon continued to inflate. And with the newfound semen production speed of Cody’s balls the balloon eventually swelled to the size of a beach-ball. And still there was no end in sight for Cody’s insufferably pleasurable torture.</p>
