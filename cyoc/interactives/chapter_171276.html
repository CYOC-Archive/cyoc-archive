<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I was inspired to write a long chapter today. Enjoy! :) PS: Thanks everyone for adding to various branches of this story -  I&#39;ll have a crack at adding to some of your chapters soon!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tash and I continued to search the cabinets for anything else useful. I opened an adjacent cabinet and my heartbeat quickened at what I saw.<br />
<br />
Staring right back at me were three orange potions labelled “male genital growth”.<br />
<br />
“Found some!” I called excitedly over to Tash. However, she was now engrossed in some bookshelves on the other side of the room. What could possibly so interesting about some old worn out books? I wondered.<br />
<br />
“Ben, I found something too! There’s a book here called ’Voodoo Magic: A comprehensive guide’!” She flicked through the pages, revealing all kinds of drawings, including a section on voodoo-linking food to body parts.<br />
<br />
“That’s awesome! Hang on one sec…” I quickly sculled a male genital growth potion and smiled as my underwear filled up with a more substantial package.<br />
<br />
I felt the gentle cradling of my cotton underwear on my balls as they expanded outwards, returning to a small bouncy ball size. At the same time, my penis began to fill out the front of my y-fronts as it too returned to the former 5.5 inch-sized pride and joy of an average 18 year old.<br />
<br />
My restored pecker was a bit big for my 7-year-old-sized body, but whatever - I was happy to have it back. No doubt the voodoo wiener and nut sack in my bag had also returned to their former state.<br />
<br />
“Yo, are you done ogling your own junk over there? Come look at this!” Tash prodded impatiently.<br />
<br />
“Yep, let’s check this out.” I quickly stashed the other two male genital growth potions in my bag, just in case I ever wanted to enlarge my genitals further.<br />
<br />
As I walked over to the bookshelf where Tash was standing, I enjoyed the feeling of my restored, larger balls rubbing my thighs again. Of course, in all my excitement about my manhood I failed to notice something small and pudgy bouncing on my chest…<br />
<br />
Tash, noticing my awkward swaggering gait, silently rolled her eyes and handed me the book.<br />
<br />
“Here, read this. This is really useful info!”<br />
<br />
<br />
—<br />
IMPORTANT NOTES ON VOODOO-LINKED FOOD:<br />
<br />
1. Changes to voodoo-linked food will cause like changes to body parts, and vice versa. For example, adding or subtracting from certain food items, such as a sack of nuts, will likewise add or subtract from the size of a linked body part. However, the flexibility of such depends on the food or body part in question.<br />
<br />
2. Voodoo-linked food is magically protected from decay, rot, or any other form of natural expiration.<br />
<br />
3. If another type of magic is used to alter the body, such as a potion, voodoo-linked body parts may require additional magic to effectively alter.<br />
—<br />
<br />
<br />
My eyes widened. “Wow, okay that’s all good to know! But how do we get rid of the voodoo?”<br />
<br />
Tash looked sideways. “Well, that’s the thing… look at the end of the chapter.”<br />
<br />
Flipping to the end of the chapter, I saw several pages had been ripped out. On the last non-ripped page of the chapter, there was a title and two sentences at the bottom of the page about “UNLINKING VOODOO FOODS”.<br />
<br />
<br />
--<br />
UNLINKING VOODOO FOODS<br />
<br />
In order to unlink voodoo foods from body parts, important care is required in order to avoid permanent damage. First, one must take a…<br />
—<br />
<br />
<br />
That was all we had.<br />
<br />
I furrowed my brow. “Damnit! Where the heck are the rest of the pages?” Looking around the cabin, there must have been hundreds of pages lying around. We didn’t have time to search them all, and there was no way of knowing if they were even there.<br />
<br />
“Goddamit we were so close! What are we gonna do?” I balled my childlike fists in frustration.<br />
<br />
“Hmm, I have an idea. Maybe if we can find out where the book is from, we could get a new copy that has the missing pages?” Tash mused thoughtfully as she took the book out of my hands and flicked to the title page. Sure enough, there was a faint red stamp at the bottom of the page. It read: “Witch’s Wares 12 Grower’s Crescent”. <br />
<br />
“Look Ben! There’s an address - Grower’s Crescent! I think that’s on the other side of town! Witch’s Wares must be a shop or bookstore or something - I think we’re in luck! Maybe we could visit there tomorrow!”<br />
<br />
I turned to Tash, spirits lifted a little. “That’s great! We both still look like little kids though… how are we gonna get there?”<br />
<br />
“Well, we still haven’t finished searching the potions… maybe there’s some age progression potions here somewhere…” Tash tiptoed back to the potion cabinets and continued reading the tiny labels. I joined her.<br />
<br />
Ten or so minutes later, Tash found a green flask in the very back of a cabinet labelled “true age restoration”.<br />
<br />
“Yes, got one!” She quickly opened it and began to drink it.<br />
<br />
“Hang on, shouldn’t we share it just in case!?” I made a move to stop her, but it was too late.<br />
<br />
Tash grinned as she began to grow, returning to her familiar, 18-year-old self. Looking down at her body, she noted her boobs were also normal, matching the rest of her body.<br />
<br />
However, her pussy was still 10 years old.<br />
<br />
“Ugh! My pussy didn’t change… I guess because of that section of the book that says voodoo-linked parts need extra magic? Maybe I need another restoration potion?”<br />
<br />
I glared at her. Meanwhile, I was still stuck as a 7-year-old half her age. “Ahem, I will be taking the next restoration potion! Especially considering you just drank that whole thing without asking me…”<br />
<br />
Tash, seemingly apologetic, helped me search.<br />
<br />
We checked and double checked. About 20 minutes later, just as we were about to give up hope, Tash found one more “true age restoration” potion lying on its side underneath a cabinet. Unfortunately the glass was cracked and most of it had spilled. There was maybe a quarter of the green liquid left.<br />
<br />
“Damn… I guess this will have to do.” I picked it up from the floor and gulped it down. I began to feel a tingling, stretching feeling all over my body. Looking down, the ground was ever so slowly getting farther away… and then it stopped.<br />
<br />
I now appeared to be about 12 years old.<br />
<br />
“Well hey, this is better than being a really little kid, I guess?” Tash offered, still feeling guilty that she had taken the entire first potion for herself.<br />
<br />
I looked down at my body. I was now a 12 year old with an 18 year old’s dick and balls. Not a bad deal, but it could be better.<br />
<br />
I crossed my arms. “Welp, I guess that’s as good as it’s going to get tonight...”<br />
<br />
Tash looked at me reassuringly. “Hey, maybe we’ll have some luck at the Witch’s Wares shop tomorrow. Maybe we&#39;ll be able to restore your age, and I could get my pussy back to normal. Who knows what kind of magic there might be there?”<br />
<br />
“Heh, if you wanted normal 18 year old genitals you could always take one of my spare male genital growth potions” I suggested jokingly, holding up one of the orange potions in my collection.<br />
<br />
Tash giggled and rolled her eyes at the goofy thought of having a penis and balls. “No thanks, I’ll pass!”<br />
<br />
Having had enough adventure for tonight, we picked up our bags and decided to head home. As we stumbled through the dark woods, I swore I felt a slight jiggling on my chest every so often. It was probably just my imagination, but I figured I should check it out when I get home.<br />
<br />
I waved goodbye to Tash as we came to her house. As I paused for a second to watch her walk up her front steps, my joking offer of one of the male genital potions to Tash got me thinking...<br />
<br />
My pesky sister has given me nothing but trouble and teasing for the last few days… especially about my penis size. I wonder how she&#39;d react to a small cock of her own? But no, I shouldn’t do it, surely… should I?<br />
<br />
Arriving at my house, I silently opened the front door, hoping no one would hear or see me as a 12 year old. As I passed by the kitchen, my mischievous side got to me. I opened the fridge, pulled out Sarah’s favorite mango juice, and added one of the orange-colored male genital growth potions. In one swift motion, I quietly closed the fridge and tiptoed up the dark stairs to my room with a big smirk on my face as I imagined Sarah&#39;s reaction after she drank her juice tomorrow.<br />
<br />
As it was long past midnight, I was eager to get in bed quickly. I stashed my bag with the voodoo foods under my bed for safe keeping.<br />
<br />
I then quickly slipped out of clothes and took a peek at my nude form in front of the mirror out of curiosity.<br />
<br />
I gasped. Not only did I have a 12-year-old boy&#39;s body with a 5.5 inch penis… I also had… small, clearly feminine breasts!?</p>
