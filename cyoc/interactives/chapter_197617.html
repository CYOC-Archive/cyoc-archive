<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt watched as the cute girl kissed Max and then turned and walked down the hall. He ignored her and headed for Max and Neil’s suite, getting there just before the door closed. He stuck his foot in to keep it from closing, then quietly pushed it open, cautiously looking around before heading inside. <br />
<br />
The common area of the suite was empty. He could hear the sound of a shower from the bathroom—likely where Max was cleaning up. And there was stirring inside Neil’s room. He knew he had only moments. <br />
<br />
But why was he even here, he wondered. His newfound obsession with Neil Booth was causing all sorts of trouble: watching the bodybuilder work out at the gym, having erotic dreams about him, and now sneaking into his dorm suite to spy on him. The dreams in particular were a problem: every time he closed his eyes he was sucking on Neil’s big cock while Sandra humiliated him. He woke up sticky every time. Matt knew that he should leave and never look back. He was a proper jock, after all! And this was Neil Booth of all people… although he didn’t really understand his own reticence; why shouldn’t he be attracted to such a perfect specimen of manhood? As Matt heard the shower turn off in the bathroom, he realized that he wasn’t ready to leave—not yet. Instead, he hid, frantically looking for a spot that was out of view. He found one behind an out-of-the-way bookcase. It was a good place to hide; it allowed him to peek around the corner, so long as he was careful. <br />
<br />
Matt watched as Max emerged from the bathroom, still somewhat damp, wearing only his underpants. Matt tried not to pay too much attention as Max began to mix up a large protein shake. Matt stayed quiet, hiding in that little spot, watching the stocky young man add multiple ingredients to the blender. Max was hunky, certainly, but he wasn’t Neil. He wasn’t the object of Matt’s growing obsession. <br />
<br />
Hearing Neil’s door open, Matt shrank back even more, hiding more completely. He held as still as he could, his stomach doing flips as the object of his desire walked out, wearing tight black shorts that hid little and a bright red stringer top that somehow hid even less! Matt could feel a shiver of arousal run through him. His heart beat so fast he was certain the sound of it would give him away! <br />
<br />
Matt watched from hiding as Neil talked to his roommate. They were both so big and strong, he thought, but clearly Neil was the superior of the two! He shivered with jealousy as Neil gave Max’ powerful ass a sexy smack. If he were the one in Max’ place, he would certainly have done more than stammer and sport wood! <br />
<br />
Matt listened and watched as the two young musclemen bantered back and forth while enjoying their protein-rich breakfasts. Mainly he watched; seeing Neil at ease, doing something as ordinary as having a protein shake for breakfast only stoked the fire of Matt’s growing obsession. The bodybuilder’s muscles were on full display in his minimal clothing and even at rest or when performing mundane tasks, they were magnificent. Matt couldn’t hear everything they were saying, nor did he try particularly hard, given the feast his eyes were enjoying. From what he could gather, they seemed to be discussing a lot of uninteresting stuff about the gym and “people changing,” whatever that meant. But he didn’t need to pay much attention to their words—the sexual tension that was building between Neil and Max was palpable; it drove Matt nuts! How would he ever secure Neil for himself if Max was in the way? <br />
<br />
Matt felt relief as Max mumbled something about needing to get dressed and hurried off, leaving Neil alone. Matt watched admiringly as the bulging bodybuilder headed for the bathroom after finishing the last dregs of his protein shake. Neil didn’t bother closing the door as he went through his post-breakfast routine, brushing and flossing, then rinsing his mouth out with mouthwash.<br />
<br />
Matt quietly slipped out from behind his hiding spot. He should leave. This obsession with Neil Booth was strange, wrong even. Yet he didn’t really understand why he had that nagging feeling, since the man was a grade-A stud and clearly worthy of adoration and desire! But on some level, he felt he should leave and never come back. But if he did that, Max would get Neil! Instead of fleeing, he stealthily headed for Neil’s room, heart thudding in his chest, walking softly and letting himself in, then quietly closing the door behind himself. Inside, it was heaven! The trophies on the shelf, the tubs of protein powder, even the faint scent of muscle jock all made him feel fuzzy inside. He was inside the personal domain of the man he’s become utterly besotted with! He grinned as he noticed the full-length mirror. He paused and primped, making sure that his hair was fluffed just so, adjusting his stylish athleisure clothing to look just right. Then, a giddy grin on his face, he lay back on Neil’s bed and waited for his prince to arrive. <br />
<br />
Neil finished his oral hygiene routine and headed back to his room. The fact that the door was closed registered only faintly and as a minor curiosity; he was sure he’d left it open, but perhaps there was a breeze. He opened the door and strode inside. It took a moment for him to realize that his bed was occupied—by Matthew Brooks, no less! “Hey big guy,” Matt said flirtatiously, lying back, totally at ease, idly adjusting his shirt in a way that pulled it back to show off his tight, flat stomach, which was adorned with aesthetically pleasing abs. <br />
<br />
“Matt,” Neil growled, his voice level but with an edge to it, “What the hell are you doing in my room? And on my bed?” He crossed his big arms over his powerful chest. <br />
<br />
Neil’s pose made Matt swoon. The way those big arms made Neil’s pecs collide with one another, the way the pose put Neil’s forearms on display… The bulge in the crotch of Matt’s gym shorts twitched visibly. One of Neil’s eyebrows cocked up; he noticed. “I just, you know, figured I’d come over and hang out, you know?” Matt said, trying to sound smooth and calm despite the butterflies in his stomach. Neil’s eyebrows furrowed, annoyance building within him, beginning to turn to anger. <br />
<br />
Matt’s eyes widened, the cool cat act dropping in an instant. He sat up, then got up off the bed and rushed over to Neil, who took a small step back. “I’m sorry,” Matt babbled, “I’ve been thinking of you all the time! Ever since… ever since that night! The night with Sandra! But it’s you that I’m thinking about now, not her! Fuck, Neil, you’re driving me crazy!” <br />
<br />
Neil looked down at Matt. He felt a small degree of surprise at that, previously he’d been the shorter of the two. He had to admit to himself that he enjoyed that, probably more than he should. Matt had been an incredible pain in the ass: a vain, egotistical bully. There was something so very gratifying about being bigger and stronger than him. But it was so much better than that! Not only had Matt become smaller and weaker, compared both to his old self and to the new and improved Neil, he seemed to be hitting on Neil too! As Matt babbled on about his attraction, Neil couldn’t help but grin. The urge to reject Matt, preferably in as cruel a way as possible, bubbled up to the surface.  It was a dark, petty idea, and deliciously so. <br />
<br />
As Neil prepared to deliver a verbal coup de grâce that would utterly destroy Matthew Brooks, something stayed his tongue. Matt had always been a cocky thing, putting on his alpha-bro routine for his friends and foes. But the Matt that stared up at Neil was different. The overbearing bravado had fallen away, leaving Matt open and vulnerable. Certainly, that gave Neil a breach in the smaller man’s defenses; he could hurt Matt terribly, if he chose. But this new and, in Neil’s view, greatly improved Matt wasn’t the person he remembered from a week or so earlier—not anymore. And Neil had to admit, this Matt was mighty cute. <br />
<br />
Neil thought back to his idea about experimenting with further changes. He was certain he was beginning to understand at least one aspect of what was happening: the subtle subconscious desires that were affecting the changes that happened to everyone. It was the only explanation for the variety of transformations. But could it be consciously guided? He had to get to the bottom of things. And here was Matt, practically begging to help Neil to do just that! <br />
<br />
“Get on your knees,” Neil growled. Matt dropped down at once. Neil slowly pulled his red stringer tank up and off while Matt gazed up worshipfully. So much had been on display already, but it showed off his abs even more. The black shorts came next and as Neil stepped out of them, his big dick began to swell. <br />
<br />
“You’ve been thinking about this dick?” Neil purred, gripping his big, half-hard shaft and swinging it back and forth enticingly. Matt could only nod in agreement. “Is that the only part of me you’ve been thinking of?” Neil added, slowly running his thumb up and down his shaft. His big pecs bounced, almost as if to mock Matt. <br />
<br />
The smaller man shook his head. “No, I’ve been thinking of every inch of you. Not just the inches of your cock; I also wonder how big your arms are, how big your chest is, what the number would be if I was gonna wrap a tape measure around one of your huge thighs…” <br />
<br />
“Then stand up. And if you really want to experience me… do it. Up close. Hands on.” Neil’s eyes flashed. He put his fists on his hips and spread his lats wide, his pecs and abs tensing as he stared down at Matt, challenging him to follow through. <br />
<br />
It was all too much to resist. Matt stood and leaned in, running his hands over Neil’s chest, roaming to explore the dramatically flared lats. Matt gave in to his desire, embracing the big bodybuilder, pulling him in for a deep, eager kiss that surprised Neil. His hands began to roam Neil’s powerful shoulders and arms, feeling the dense, powerful muscle. Matt broke the kiss and nuzzled against Neil’s thick neck and traps, kissing and licking them, before moving down to the larger man’s powerful chest. “Fuck you’re hot…” Matt breathed, his hands moving in to caress and massage Neil’s pecs as his lips and tongue explored the bodybuilder’s abs. Further and further down Matt went, kissing and licking the cobblestoned muscles of Neil’s stomach until the tip of the bodybuilder’s manhood brushed against Matt’s chin. <br />
<br />
Neil let out a loud groan as he felt Matt’s lips touch the tip of his cock. He breathed heavily, looking down at Matt as the smaller man gave his dick several slow, sensual kisses. Then Matt looked up at him, opened wide, and dove down onto Neil’s throbbing erection. <br />
<br />
Matt only managed to get six of Neil’s ten inches inside before he choked and had to pull back, but that was enough to wring a low groan of pleasure from Neil. The larger man remembered he had to focus on the test at hand: trying to guide the change. So he focused as hard as he could on becoming a hulking Korean bodybuilder. His mind drifted to one in particular: a man with a truly massive physique, most notably possessing a pair of positively enormous pecs. Neil held that image in his mind as his goal. Then he let himself enjoy Matt’s efforts, reaching down to stroke his smaller man’s head, his fingers running through Matt’s soft, perfectly coiffed hair. <br />
<br />
It was not Matt’s first time, but he was dealing with a larger, girthier version of Neil. After some initial awkwardness he managed to get the right amount of suction and movement figured out. It was as if the knowledge about how to properly suck a cock was blossoming in his mind. He ran his hands up and down Neil’s powerful thighs, then played with the big bodybuilder’s oversized balls, teasing them as he sucked. His gag reflex lessened and he swallowed more and more of the big bodybuilder’s hard shaft. The gasps and grunts from above let Matt know that he was on the right track. He felt the rod in his mouth begin to tense up and he instinctively knew that Neil was close. Matt clamped down firmly, inviting Neil to the back of his throat as he took every last one of those ten inches, his throat bulging as he reached around to grip Neil’s tense glutes for support. <br />
<br />
When the explosion came Matt held on tight, greedily swallowing the prodigious load of cum that Neil shot down his throat. He swallowed as much as he could, gulping down each volley as it came. When he’d teased out the last few drops, he sat back on his heels and looked up at Neil with a grin. “Better than the last time,” he remarked, before standing up. He sounded profoundly satisfied. <br />
<br />
Neil grinned back, his big pecs rising and falling as he took deep breaths, recovering from what had started out as an almost lackluster blowjob, then became an amazing one. He blinked as he looked at Matt. The football player looked just a bit different: still very fit but a bit leaner, a bit more built for speed rather than sheer power. And Matt’s ass had benefitted from some more noticeable improvements, becoming a pair of rounded mounds that his stylish gym shorts clung to enticingly; Neil thought Matt looked exquisitely fuckable.  <br />
<br />
Matt’s grin widened. “Fuck I can never get over how good you look, big guy! Like you’ve been spending half your gym sessions on the bench press!” He reached out and gave one of Neil’s big pecs an admiring squeeze. In Matt’s mind, Neil’s pecs had always been his best muscle group. Neil laughed and flexed his powerful chest, let Matt grope it for a bit, then playfully shoved him away, sending him stumbling backward and landing on the bed where he’d been earlier. <br />
<br />
Neil excitedly stepped back and looked in his reflection in the full-length mirror. He was bigger than before, his muscles larger and more impressive, especially his pecs. He bounced them a few times, grinning at his reflection. He went from pose to pose, somehow knowing from his new memories exactly how to show off his muscles for a crowd. On the bed, Matt let out a low whistle of appreciation, but Neil ignored it. Frankly, he was a bit disappointed. While his physique had changed most noticeably, and while his features were slightly different, he did not look particularly Korean. His hair was a bit darker and a bit straighter, and his skin seemed clearer. But otherwise, his features were the same. <br />
<br />
He was bigger, but he didn&#39;t look particularly Korean. Had the experiment failed? Was that particular change too much for whatever force was responsible? He tried to search his memories, but came up blank. He was certain he&#39;d failed when he had an idea. Neil grabbed his phone and searched for the family tree that a genealogy-obsessed aunt had created. A surprise waited there: his grandmother on his mother’s side was unmistakably Asian-looking. That triggered a breakthrough in his mind. He looked back at his memories of her and realized there were now two versions of his grandmother: there was the woman with Scandinavian roots who made fantastic pancakes and there was the Korean immigrant woman who seemed to serve everything with kimchi. More new &quot;memories&quot; flooded in, including childhood memories of his own mother. In his new memories, she was visibly half-Asian and her meals had been a mix of Korean and western cuisines. There was more: some rudimentary lessons in the Korean language as a child, “because it will make grandma so happy.” His entire family history had been dramatically altered! <br />
<br />
That gave Neil pause. On the one hand, he relished the cultural broadening he’s just experienced through his altered past. On the other hand, was it truly proper for him to be changing members of his own family that way? To be changing grandma? Was it ethical? It was one thing when he was the one being changed, but what about when the changes happened to others? <br />
<br />
“What are you looking up?” Matt asked from the bed. Neil had nearly forgotten that the man was even there. <br />
<br />
“Nothing much,” Neil replied noncommittally, not prepared to let Matt in on the existential questions he was pondering. Of course, Matt was one of the ones that seemed oblivious to the changes, so he wouldn’t understand it anyway, Neil reasoned. He’d need to talk it over with Max. Maybe on that hike later. But he also needed to meet up with Brock for that workout. And of course, he still had to figure out just what he was going to do with Matt.</p>
