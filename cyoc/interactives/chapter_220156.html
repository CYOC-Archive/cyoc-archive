<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Barry turned around at the sound of some gunshots.<br />
<br />
The head of a young and bearded Black man looked greatly out of place on the body of a busty White teen girl in skimpy clothing.  Knees bent inward and stumbling in heels, and with a half-unlocked pair of handcuffs on his left wrist, the man femininity grunted as he holding a pistol with both hands, shot at 3 masked and apparently untransformed men, two armed with bats and the other with a Shovel.  They took cover behind some cars.<br />
<br />
The man looked woozy and apparently drunk - he couldn&#39;t line up his shots right, and when he stopped to reload, the man with the Shovel jumped out and charged him.  The girl-bodied man went wide-eyed as was about to be hit before the assailant was tackled by a handsome-bodied police officer that was clearly African American - with the two heads of teenage girls, one White and the other Asian, with a whole lot of smeared makeup on where a male head should be.<br />
<br />
Barry swore that the most probable chain of events was that a black police officer was bringing in two drunk teenage girls when the &quot;red flash&quot; (Fusion Wave) hit and he had the unfortunate luck of swapping heads with one of them while both of their heads had ended up on his body. <br />
<br />
They screamed &quot;Thake thatf, mhotherfhuckeer!&quot; drunkenly in a masculine voice as they whipped out their equipped police officer&#39;s Baton and landed about half the hits they attempted on the attacker before they were hit in the back by one of the other attackers with a bat.  The same happened with the girl-bodied man, who groaned in a sultry voice.<br />
<br />
The attackers retrieved the officer&#39;s gun and magazines and the girls&#39; police body&#39;s taser, baton, and badge, before retrieving the officer&#39;s wallet and grabbing just about everything.<br />
<br />
Barry stood out of sight and hoped that the men wouldn&#39;t kill the three.  There wasn&#39;t much he could do.<br />
<br />
The men were discussing where the nearest ATM station was and how to get rid of the &quot;freaks&quot; before they paused upon hearing a feminine shriek.<br />
<br />
The unmistakable body of an Asian female, dressed in skimpy clothing, was tied up and being carried by a fourth, very large man on his shoulder.  In one hand, he carried a fireaxe, and in the other, wrapped around her, he was holding her skirt and panties.  Her naked buttockw were bare for all to see, and from her crotch emanated a loud voice of dissent. <br />
A pair of angry eyes and eyebrows were located above the girl&#39;s vagina, which was somehow speaking (yelling). Barry spied a  verically-situated human tongue flicking in and out of the snatch.<br />
<br />
Through all the grunts and pauses the girl had to make due to the pleasure from speaking from such ab orifice, the girl still managed to angrily curse out and demand her and her fellow captives&#39; release.<br />
<br />
Her demands were responded to with a very hard slap on her buttocks and, after she was put down, a fingering of her vagina to keep her quiet until she orgasmed.  Though not passed out, she groaned and moaned, powerless to do anything.  With closer inspection Barry noticed that hee body&#39;s hands and feet had switched places, and that, atop the body&#39;s headless neck, sat a pair of lips the girl used to breathe.  By the looks of it, the body of the Asian girl had grown its own conscience once its head had left it.<br />
<br />
The man with the Shovel took the gun and stated that they should put the freaks &quot;out of their misery&quot; before he was shot in the arm from an unknown direction.  The police officer, with his new feminine hands, quickly snatched the gun, and struggling to his feet, he yelled in a serious but ridiculously feminine voice:<br />
&quot;Nobody move!  Put down your weapons!<br />
<br />
After clarifying that the two girls were okay to move but not the attackers, they untied the Asian girl&#39;s body and helped her to her feet.<br />
<br />
From down the street came a clopping - a female bull-centaur with a rifle trained on the attackers arrived - she was wearing torn overalls (the bottom was shredded) and a leather jacket, along with a cowboy hat on her head that didn&#39;t quite fit thanks to the long black cow ears she had instead of human ones - the only non-human features in her upper body. <br />
<br />
She huffed - her large, four-breastfed chest heaving along with the powerful one of the bull she was attached to.<br />
With a slightly lighter shade of brown fur than her Latina skin, the powerful and muscular (and a bit smelly) frame of the bull glistened with sweat as it&#39;s tail swished angrily with every angrier hoof clop.<br />
<br />
A musky smell emanated from the huge, 4 foot-long and plenty girthy bull penis that the woman had equipped.  It slapped on her bull-body&#39;s chest as she took very clearly pissed-off steps, causing her to momentarily pause before taking more purposeful strides.<br />
 <br />
Rifle still trained on the assailants, the woman asked if everyone was all right before questioning the motives of the attackers.<br />
<br />
When they replied &quot;because the world&#39;s gone to shit thanks to you fucking freaks!&quot;, the bull-taur woman and the officer sighed and told the attackers to walk down the street for 400 steps with their hands behind their backs before they could go free - any less or any suspicious moments and they would shoot - not that they wanted too - law and order may be absent, but it gave no right to be inhumane.<br />
<br />
While the mutants were including their instructions, Barry gasped as he saw one of the men reach for a shiny object on the side of their boots.  A hidden gun.<br />
The fireaxe guy saw what was going on and prepared to reach for his weapon.<br />
<br />
Barry was about to yell out a warning when the body of the Asian girl, having noticed the suspicious movement, swung her body over to the bull-tsur woman, and grabbing her penis with her feet-hands and hand-feet, gave it a few hard pumps and aimed it fully in the direction of the attackers - who had paused and grimaced at the strange sight.<br />
<br />
The centaur woman gasped.before she moaned , her rear bull legs buckling and wobbling as her punishment sent wave after wave of seven flying with great force at the men.<br />
<br />
Despite having a pair of humongous testicles (each was the size of a basketball), the bull-taur woman&#39;s orgasm lasted just around 25 aeconds.  <br />
<br />
When it was over, she was huffing, sighing, and gasping in ecstasy, and the attackers, drenched in cum, had run far off, slipping and tripping over each other, leaving everything.<br />
<br />
Barry and the mutant group looked on in amazement.</p>
