<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had taken Alan Parker, now accepting her new role as Allison Parker,  nearly an hour to find where her friend Logan had been hiding. When the gender wave had hit, Logan, who was the captain of the basketball team and an undisputed Don Juan ladies man, had run off in a panic, leaving all his clothes in his unlocked locker. Allison had reluctantly gotten changed after drying off, still very disturbed at what had happened obviously, but was of a caliber of mind who could just accept the changes for what they were and that she could do nothing about it. Ignoring her teammates who were now all shamelessly flirting with one another and on their way to a full blown lesbian orgy, Allison took Logan&#39;s clothes with her on the manhunt.<br />
<br />
The high school had closed early due to the gender wave, as students and faculty were still coming to terms with their new bodies and relationships, former homophobic students now having to seriously reconsider whether it was more important to have a girlfriend or to remain &quot;no homo&quot;. Allison was one of the few students left in the building. She eventually found Logan sitting outside under the bleachers, totally naked and in a daze, staring out into space in an almost zombified way. She had obviously been crying. <br />
<br />
&quot;Logan?&quot; asked Allison, to which Logan jumped. <br />
<br />
&quot;W-who are you?&quot; asked the scared jock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alan, man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Logan stared at the blonde barbie with the bangs wearing Alan&#39;s basketball jersey, somehow re-tailored to fit this girls curves that just wouldn&#39;t quit. Not that Logan was flat chested herself anymore...<br />
<br />
Allison shook her head. &quot;It&#39;s unbelievable how hot you are now&quot;, she said, unconsciously putting her hands on her hips in a girly pose. &quot;I mean, we&#39;re all hot now, even the geeks turned into really cute girl next store types, but you take the cake.&quot;<br />
<br />
Logan, who before had been tall, dark, and handsome, was now a very curvy and pale redheaded girl. She was so pale that freckles were dotted all along her body, but in an adorable and not obtrusive way. She had an hourglass figure to die for, and was, while not skinny, blessed with a figure that none of the real girls at school, the ones who had been born female, could possibly match. In short, Logan was going to break a lot of hearts. Allison wondered to herself if her male mind was still present and she was attracted to this girl because of that, or that she had turned into a lesbian. <br />
<br />
Logan had wanted to tell this chick, whoever she was really, to fuck off, but somehow, intuitively, she knew that this girl he would normally would lust furiously over, was his best friend since first grade. <br />
<br />
&quot;You think that&#39;s a compliment?!&quot; Logan shrieked. &quot;I don&#39;t WANT to be a girl! Whatever fucking happened, I can&#39;t live this way! I can&#39;t be a girl! I can&#39;t...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have much of a choice for now, do you?&quot; asked Alan, bending over and crawling underneath the bleachers. <br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;d you even get in here without anyone noticing?&quot; she asked to the still naked Logan.<br />
<br />
&quot;I ran. I can outrun The Flash when I&#39;m in the mood. Everyone else was too busy feeling themselves up to notice me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison nodded. &quot;Well, I got your clothes here. Unfortunately, whatever changed us into girls seems to have changed these too.&quot; <br />
<br />
Allison pulled out of Logan&#39;s knapsack a white top which had used to be Logan&#39;s white t-shirt.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have a bra in there? I don&#39;t want to walk around with these bouncing around&quot; said Logan, cupping her new hooters.<br />
<br />
Allison looked inside, feeling for one, and pulled one out. &quot;Here ya go. It&#39;s blue, even.&quot;<br />
<br />
Logan, who had been an expert at removing girl&#39;s bras *wink wink*, had no problem applying the bra on his new softer body. Immediately after putting it on, the strain on his back went away.<br />
<br />
&quot;34D. Pretty impressive if you ask me&quot; joked Allison.<br />
<br />
Logan rolled her eyes at her thoroughly feminized friend and put on the white top. It was a lacy long-sleeved affair with a low cut, designed to show off as much cleavage as possible.<br />
<br />
Next, Allison pulled out Logan&#39;s new jeans, which hadn&#39;t changed much at all, just re-cut to compensate for Logan&#39;s new wider hips and ass. She then pulled out Logan&#39;s sneakers, which were now a women&#39;s size six, but otherwise hadn&#39;t become more girly in any meaningful way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks&quot; said Logan. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, there&#39;s one more thing&quot; said Allison, pulling out one more thing from the knapsack. &quot;It&#39;s your school I.D. Says your new name is Lila. Lila Hanley.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. No...no...no&quot; said Logan, emphatically shaking her head. &quot;I&#39;m not changing my name no matter what some damn I.D says. I&#39;m not giving up my identity completely.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison gasped as the name on the I.D morphed back to the name Logan right in front of her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;O...K then&quot; said Allison, wondering if it was too late for her to revert back to being named Alan. She&#39;d check later on. &quot;I guess Logan can be a girl&#39;s name too.&quot;<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, halfway across the world, a group of friends in Saudi Arabia were riding the desert sand dunes in their Jeep, having a blast, laughing, thinking life is but a dream when the gender wave hit...<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, Millie, look at this!&quot; yelled Jose.<br />
<br />
Jose had pointed at the TV, the news showing Pope Francis, now a twenty-two year old young woman who was now also a buxom bombshell of a latina like Jose, patiently comforting hoards of devout women, both born and changed.</p>
