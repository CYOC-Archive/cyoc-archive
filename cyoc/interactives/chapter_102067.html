<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben Twist looked more closely at Kenya Adaeze. She saw the sparkle in her boyfriend&#39;s eyes and a smile cross his face as he moved closer to her.<br />
&quot;I have absolutely no idea what I ever did, but I sincerely hope I&#39;m always worthy of you,&quot; Ben said tenderly, before kissing her.<br />
Kenya wrapped her arms around him, sincerely enjoying the moment. When they finished, Ben looked at her and said, &quot;Let&#39;s go talk to that career counselor and see if they have any ideas.&quot;<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
&quot;...and so, as you can see, William Shakespeare was not only a product and influence upon his time, but in some ways, he was also ahead of his time as well. Beginning Monday, we&#39;ll start discussing how his words and works have continued to influence the world even today. Until then, have a nice weekend, and class dismissed,&quot; said Professor William Anderson, as his students started filing out of his 9:30 class.<br />
It was now 10:25 that Friday morning. His youngest son Eric was experiencing his first transformation into a were-merman after declaring and consummating his love for Julie Stovall*. Meanwhile, William&#39;s older son Nate had sat in the back of the room with his boyfriend Alex Ramsey.<br />
While Alex was pouring over brochures from the college, William noticed his son was paying close attention to what his father was doing and saying, as if trying to come to some decision.<br />
After the last student left, William walked back to where the boys were sitting and said, &quot;You guys didn&#39;t have to stay, but I thank you for being quiet and respectful of the students while you were here. Hope you didn&#39;t find the lesson too boring or over your heads. Now then, my next class isn&#39;t until 11. What can I do for you Nate, besides revealing that you can take Alex to the Skulk ceremony tonight as long as you both dress nice and are respectful of the proceedings?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, dad, Alex and I came here for the Open House the college is having since the high school is closed today, and we both talked to a career counselor named Mrs. Johnson. While Alex&#39;s discussion is best had with his parents, I&#39;d like to talk to you a bit about what she said to me.&quot;<br />
William was very happy to hear that, proud that Nate was taking a more invested interest in his future than his boyhood dream of one day being the mascot for the Minnesota Timber Wolves or how the relationship between he and Alex would develop.<br />
Nate&#39;s father sat down in a chair near his son as Nate relayed what the counselor said and suggested.<br />
<br />
When Nate was finished, William said, &quot;Teaching while hoping to find success as a writer. I can see how your lifelong love of werewolves would play into the latter, even before we moved to Moon Lake, although you&#39;d have to be careful not to give away any of the town&#39;s or your fellow were&#39;s secrets if you ever wrote something based specifically on your own life.&quot;<br />
&quot;I realize that,&quot; agreed Nate. &quot;But what do you think of her suggestions?&quot;<br />
&quot;My main goals for both you and Eric has always been your happiness, and that you two are more successful in your lives than however your mother&#39;s and mine turn out.&quot;<br />
&quot;My folks say the same thing to me. I think it&#39;s in the Parenting 101 handbook,&quot; commented Alex, having put his brochures aside to listen to his boyfriend and father (or maybe someday future father-in-law) talk.<br />
&quot;When you two get to be parents, you&#39;ll feel the same way about your children,&quot; William told his son&#39;s beau.<br />
&quot;Well, whatever direction my future takes after high school, it&#39;s a big step,&quot; Nate pointed out. &quot;Writing may have crossed my mind at some point, but teaching?&quot;<br />
&quot;It is a noble profession, and I won&#39;t deny I&#39;d be honored if you followed in my footsteps or paw prints,&quot; was his father&#39;s only comments about the the teaching profession. &quot;But if it helps, as long as I&#39;m an active employee here, you and Eric will always have somewhat of an educational discount towards attending Moon Lake College,&quot; which would help with the financial burden and hopefully keep his sons from being burdened down with student loans and debt.<br />
&quot;I get decent grades, and I had planned on continuing my education beyond high school but until now, I hadn&#39;t really given much thought with what I&#39;d do with the rest of my life,&quot; admitted Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe that&#39;s your problem son. DON&#39;T look at it as what you want to do with the <i>rest</i> of your life. Look at it as a chance to figure out what you want to do <i><b>with</b></i> your life,&quot; advised his father.<br />
&quot;Hmmm...&quot; said Nate. &quot;I see your point. Thanks dad.&quot;<br />
&quot;Any time, and I&#39;d be more than happy to go over all that stuff with you whenever you&#39;d like,&quot; added William, looking at the pile of brochures in front of his son, &quot;although the rest of today and tonight&#39;s kind of booked already,&quot; he said, while taking a quick glance at his wristwatch. &quot;My next class is in about ten minutes and I have to get ready. Is there anything else you guys need to talk about right now?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; began Alex, wondering how to phrase the question, &quot;am I wrong, or is there times Eric&#39;s eyes have been blue instead of brown?&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve noticed it too, huh?&quot; said William, while standing up.<br />
&quot;Yeah. Is he okay?&quot; asked Nate, as the boys started following Professor Anderson out of the classroom.<br />
<br />
While looking at both of them, William put a hand on his son&#39;s shoulder and said, &quot;Your brother is on the verge of needing to make a major decision in his life. Whatever happens, we will be loving and supportive of him, right?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, dad,&quot; agreed Nate, as Alex simply nodded his head affirmatively.<br />
&quot;Okay then. The ceremony&#39;s at 7:30. Be back at our house ready to go by 6:30, and I&#39;ll treat everyone to dinner afterwards,&quot; promised William. &quot;Now if you gentlemen will excuse me?&quot; he added, before going into the men&#39;s room across the hall.<br />
With his father&#39;s classroom on the second floor, it wasn&#39;t until Nate and Alex were back downstairs until Nate stopped in mid-step and said, &quot;Oh my!&quot;<br />
&quot;What? Are you okay stud?&quot; asked Alex, moving closer to his boyfriend.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Eric! He and Julie... Don&#39;t you see? My brother&#39;s gonna become a were-merman!&quot;<br />
