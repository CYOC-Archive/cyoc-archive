<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Archie was sitting in his lawn chair with his homemade margarita beside him daydreaming about being an animal again. He thought about what it might be like to be a bird flying through the air and eating berries or a hare listening to the world the big giant ears. He felt as though he almost knew what it was like, from those dreams of his, but they felt so distant now as his thoughts trailed off into a daze. He just sat their in the evening sun, mind cleared, relishing the feeling of the warm glow shining down over him from above. <br />
<br />
Immediately, he felt his gaze seem to be fixed to the pond in his garden.<br />
<br />
Then, he remembered.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve tried being a bird, and a hare, both land and air,&quot; he mused, &quot;but could I try a fish, who only lives in water?&quot;<br />
<br />
he got up, walked to the pond, and took off his shoes and socks. He say by the edge of the pond, and stated longingly into the calm cool water.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, his feet became webbed!<br />
<br />
He stared with a mixture of fascination and disbelief as his feet began to change before his eyes. They lengthened, and webbing grew between his toes. It was soft, cold, and gelatinous. He also watched in surprise as his toenails popped off his toes, and vanished into the pond where they fell. As the webbing grew, the skin there began to change colour, fading to a pale aqua, as shimmering slimy scales began to grow over his changing feet.<br />
<br />
Archie was shocked, but amazed. &quot;I must be the very first man in the world to have webbed feet!&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Attention quickly shifted to his hands, the fingers beginning to develop the same translucent, gelatinous webbing between them. And, like his toenails, his fingernails popped off his fingers and thumbs, and and vanished into the pond where they fell. The skin turned a similar shade of pale bluegreen, as scales grew there too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now my hands are webbed!&quot; Archie exclaimed.<br />
<br />
he couldn&#39;t believe his eyes as he held his bizarrely itching arms in front of his face; as long thin rigid spines erupted from in between his digits, and rippled down the sides of his arms too. Webbing clung to them as fins were formed, and the scales continued to cover his skin, slowly coating it with a slimy film.<br />
<br />
Archie wasted no time in taking off his clothes, stripping down till he was naked as the day he was born. His penis slumped right into his body.<br />
<br />
suddenly he felt a searingly sharp pain in his back. Fighting to look at the changes taking place there, he suddenly keeled over.<br />
<br />
He immediately felt sharp spines breaking free from his skin, almost ripping through it. Archie groaned and grunted as it happened, the transformation wasn&#39;t painless. Fighting back the sting of tears in his eyes, he looked back, and immediately saw webbing beginning to grow between said spines on his back, creating an enormous dorsal fin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit.&quot; Archie said to himself. &quot;It&#39;s really happening. I&#39;m actually turning into a fish.&quot;<br />
<br />
And as the webbed dorsal ridge continued to burst forth from his spine, he felt his balance beginning to shift. His arms and legs continued to change into fins, and all too soon, he found it impossible to remain standing upright. He edged forward as scales spread over his torso, preparing for a difficult landing on the grass.<br />
<br />
he immediately discovered that he could no longer turn his head around, but he knew one thing was for sure and absolute positive - his piscine changes were drawing to a close.<br />
<br />
His huge flippery feet began to fuse, starting at the heel and working their way outwards as his legs became unable to separate. His legs became a single connected mass, and the shimmering scales rippled down it&#39;s length, cementing their fate. The flippers finished their transition into a flattened tailfin, taking with them his last chance of being able to stand up again.<br />
<br />
Archie felt his arms shrinking into his torso, which by now was changing into a more fish-like shape, leaving the fins on his body.<br />
<br />
Archie saw his human face emerging on the body, and he saw his hair falling out, and his ears changed into gills.<br />
<br />
Gasping, he felt the painful sting of air drying them out. He was soon distracted by this as his vision began to warp and alter, and his mind was plunged into a state of cold, yet placid numbness.<br />
<br />
Instinctively, he wriggled and slid into the now inviting and awaiting water; his transformation completed.</p>
