<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer was still in shock at her family&#39;s huge wealth increase. She walked into her new attached bathroom - all marble of course, and filled to the brim with Magia Rojo products. Besides that, there were the softest, silkiest towels she&#39;d ever touched - she felt like she could use them as thick pillowcases.<br />
<br />
&quot;Intelligence, huh?&quot; She thought to herself, carefully thinking about Jennifer&#39;s words. She was curious how the mental changes were going to effect her, besides the obvious: she was now able to text at an impressive rate and she was much better on her phone as opposed to a laptop when it came to the internet. She was also a bit worried that it made her a little slower, because it seemed a bit harder to think about anything but sex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I suppose you&#39;re not going to change me back.&quot; Rachel said. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Miss Clark, I am not authorized to do that.&quot; Jennifer replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I appreciate what you&#39;ve done so far, Jennifer. Any chance you could make things a bit... easier for me, if you know what I mean?&quot; Rachel asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Miss Clark, I think I know exactly what you&#39;re talking about. Let me edit your file a bit and we&#39;ll see if that&#39;s a bit better. I&#39;ll speed up the process and allow the changes to fully take place, the lingerie takes a bit more time than our other beauty products. Your mother seems to have received the full treatment, so I&#39;ll add that to your file.&quot; Jennifer replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! That&#39;s not what I...&quot; Rachel started before watching her body change again. <br />
<br />
Her breasts grew even bigger, at least another two cup sizes.<br />
<br />
Down lower, her hips expanded, widening to the point that they were even wider than her shoulders. Her rear expanded, too, giving her a pert and firm bubble butt. Her clothes changed again to fit her changing body.<br />
<br />
Despite all these changes, the biggest feeling was in her loins. Her vagina felt like it was on fire! Sexy images of both men and women flashed through her brain as she tried to focus. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait... please... Jennifer... I...&quot; Rachel continually tried to start talking, but her other hand had traveled to her loins. She bit her lip as she finally reached them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Clark? Rachel? Are you okay?&quot; Jennifer asked.<br />
<br />
Jennifer dropped her phone - now a diamond studded, pink iPhone - before tapping the speaker icon. She couldn&#39;t hold the phone anymore; she was too horny... and the facial moisturizer that she&#39;d thrown before was attracting her more by the second. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um... ohhhhh... no, I&#39;m not! Your stupid *mmph* change has made me so horny I can&#39;t *ungh* think! And it changed my body more!&quot; Rachel said. She was rubbing her wet vagina through the pink workout shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Miss Clark, I apologize. I must have clicked the wrong program. In the meantime, please don&#39;t use anymore Magia Rojo products for the time being. They may cause unintended side effects. Please wait, it should only be a few minutes.&quot; Jennifer said.<br />
<br />
&quot;*Ungh* S-s-sure Jennifer... Please... hurry...&quot; Rachel said, as Jennifer&#39;s audio cut to some elevator music. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please hold. The representative will return shortly.&quot; was played out in a robotic voice every minute or so.<br />
<br />
However, to Rachel, the minutes felt like hours. No matter how much she touched herself, she couldn&#39;t orgasm.<br />
<br />
Another problem was just how transfixed was on the moisturizer. It was the only thing that got her mind off the ridiculous libido increase. It felt like an oasis of rational thought in a desert filled with smut.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t a Magia Roja product... right? So she could use it without consequence. That made things easier to Rachel.<br />
<br />
Rachel squirted some on her hands without reading the label.<br />
<br />
Unbeknownst to her, when Jennifer had adjusted her file, every female beauty product in the Clark household had changed to a Magia Rojo product. <br />
<br />
Even worse, Jennifer had accidentally activated an experimental employee training program. Although none of the employees at Magia Rojo had been changed, the company was considering serious expansion, so they&#39;d been developing this program to make sure they never ran short of employees and that they&#39;d easily be able to change whole neighborhoods at once.<br />
<br />
Rachel didn&#39;t know all of this, of course, as she rubbed the cooling cream across her face. An amazing feeling spread throughout her. <br />
<br />
The libido raise had subsided... no, it was still there, but it felt normal, like it had always been a part of her.<br />
<br />
 She could finally think! And think she did.<br />
<br />
New thoughts filled her head while the &#39;on hold&#39; music continued. <br />
<br />
&quot;This body really is beautiful.&quot; &quot;I&#39;m so grateful for these changes.&quot; &quot;I can have sex with any man or woman I want now!&quot; &quot;This is wonderful, I have to give everyone I know Magia Rojo products!&quot; &quot;There is no such thing as a slut - people are meant to be horny all the time&quot; &quot;You should be horny all the time and base all of your decisions off of your libido.&quot; &quot;All women are naturally bisexual, it just has to be unlocked - and it can be, with Magia Rojo products!&quot; <br />
<br />
The thoughts raced through her head, rewiring her brain, changing her mood from horny and scared to horny and proud.<br />
<br />
She looked in the mirror. How could she have been such a fool? Magia Rojo was the most perfect beauty care company ever founded!<br />
<br />
Happiness filled her, as did an urge to spread this happiness the only way she knew how: by giving this gift to her friends, her neighbors, anyone willing to listen!<br />
<br />
Her thoughts were finally interrupted by the robotic voice playing a different message.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your representative is now active.&quot; The voice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Clark? Are you okay? I can&#39;t find the change I&#39;ve made, it seems to have disappeared. Are you back to your original beautified state?&quot; Jennifer asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Jennifer, I&#39;m better than alright! I&#39;ve accepted myself and your wonderful products, and I&#39;m ready to spread Magia Rojo products around the world!&quot; Rachel beamed back.<br />
<br />
Jennifer paused. Something was off. The annoyed tone that Rachel had been using with her disappeared and had been replaced by a confident, happy tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are? You weren&#39;t very enthusiastic before. Are you sure you&#39;re alright, Rachel?&quot; Jennifer said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, Jennifer! Send me as many boxes of this beautiful product as you can!&quot; Rachel replied. </p>
