<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Russell woke to his alarm the next morning, and immediately hit snooze. When the alarm rant again, he hit snooze a second time. On the third ring, Russell woke fully with a start. He noticed his hands were down his pants, cupping his balls. Was he playing with himself in his sleep?<br />
<br />
Russell got out of bed and began to get ready to school. He was still in disbelief that he had snoozed. Twice! He never, ever, hits the snooze button. On top of this, when be woke up, he was fondling himself!<br />
<br />
After his shower, Russell got dressed and headed downstairs. His father was already waiting for him with a big,greasy breakfast. It looked big enough for 3 people. Also on the table were 2 more white pills from the night before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, what are all these pills for?&quot;, Russell asked. &quot;Never you mind. Eat them, and all your food, too&quot;. Russell took the pills and started eating his breakfast. He normally didn&#39;t eat so much but he didn&#39;t want to anger his dad. His dad handed him two more pills. &quot;Take these at lunch&quot;, he grunted. Russell took them and stuck them in his pocket. He grabbed his backpack and went to school, feeling very bloated and full.<br />
<br />
Russell arrived at school, ready for his first class, Calculus. When the class started, however, he found it a bit more difficult than usual. He was having a hard time following the teacher. He raised his hand to ask a question. &quot;How did you get the answer to number 5?&quot;, he said, with his already high voice breaking loudly halfway through. He blushed red and cleared his throat. He asked the question again, but this time he could swear his voice was a bit deeper. Strange.<br />
<br />
During lunch time, Russell swallowed both of the pills. He got his lunch and sat down to study for his chemistry test one more time. However, he was finding the usually interesting material dry and difficult. He quickly got bored and closed the book. He was glancing around the lunch room trying to spot any of the guys he had a crush on. Russell was in fact, gay. He spied some of the football players and felt a tingle in his groin. He also saw Claire, one of the hotter cheerleaders. &quot;Damn, she is so hot&quot;, he said, feeling a pulse on his briefs, which felt a bit tight and constricting, or at least more so than this morning. &quot;Did i just say a girl is hot?&quot;, he asked himself? He shook his head, shaking off the strange thought. He quickly turned his attention to his chemistry book, All the while absentmindedly scratching his tight crotch and his legs.<br />
<br />
Russell arrived home in a sour mood. The chemistry test was a disaster. He thought he had studied really hard, but it turned out he didn&#39;t know much on the test at all. He would be lucky to even pass, let alone the 100 he was shooting for. Not only that, for some reason, Russell started sweating, probably from the anxiety, and had two big sweat patches under his arm. It was so embarassing!<br />
<br />
Russell set his book down and scratched his groin. Uggh. It had felt itchy and constricted all day! He pulled of his sweaty shirt and took off his pants. In just his briefs, It looked like his previously tiny bulge was a little bit bigger. As he pulled down his briefs, he gasped. He had the very light beginnings of pubic hair above his cock. And he had a few wisps on his balls. And it was probably his imagination, But his cock looked a bit bigger. &quot;I&#39;m getting pubes?!&quot; he exclaimed. He just shrugged it off as normal puberty. He got in the shower, scrubbed off, and got ready to so his homework.<br />
<br />
At dinner time, his dad gave him 4 pills. Russell took them without question, again. As he took them, his dad spoke up. &quot;Son, your going to be taking 4 of these 3 times a day now. On top of that, I don&#39;t want you to call me dad anymore. Address me coach, and only coach. Okay?&quot;. Russell was confused, but he did as he was told. Making waves in this household was nothing but trouble. &quot;Yes, coach&quot;, as be gulped down the pills.</p>
