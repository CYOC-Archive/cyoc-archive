<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Tyra! This was supposed to be an APOLOGY to Sophie and Roland for what happened last year!&quot; Heather huffed in the kitchen of the home that she and Jeremy presently shared with her grandmother Tyra Wrex and her bond mate, Rex Ramos, &quot;It&#39;s not to be some kind of... sex party!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It won&#39;t be!&quot; Tyra answered looking down to the apron she had on over the swimsuit she was wearing, but not much else, &quot;and besides... the two of them became Animalians themselves. It&#39;s likely that the two of them will take that plunge themselves. And given how much the two of them cuddled on their internet videos over the summer it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if they already have.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather didn&#39;t argue that point, as she thought she&#39;d caught a faint scent of sex on Sophie and Roland outside of WSA and figured that something like that happened. In a way, Heather was actually happy about that. It was something that gave an indication that her actions a year prior hadn&#39;t done lasting damage that hurt their relationship. They still had their love and they were together. That was good news for them, though there was still the issue of the fact that their parents were still human, and while Heather thought she&#39;d noticed some awe on the part of Sophie and Roland&#39;s parents the previous Thanksgiving, she figured that was more at the fact that Andrew was so impressively built. That sort of thing was fairly common, as far as Heather had noticed in her time through her punishments, rehabilitation, and probation, and now as an acclimated member of Animalia&#39;s society, and happily married, but that didn&#39;t necessarily mean that Sophie and Roland&#39;s parents wanted to convert.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not the point,&quot; Heather argued after a moment, &quot;their PARENTS are supposed to be coming too! I don&#39;t think there&#39;s going to be any interest in sex talk!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it won&#39;t be,&quot; Tyra answered, &quot;I have it ALL planned. The guests will arrive, we&#39;ll all eat... and we have food for everyone... and then we&#39;ll all enjoy a nice soak in Animalia&#39;s hot tub. Everyone will be comfortable and everyone will be able share experiences and get along. It will be fun for all, and no sex. Promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather&#39;s eyes narrowed as she watched Tyra raise her hand up and showing Heather the palm of her hand. The two of them had gotten along fairly well, and for the most part, Tyra had managed to &quot;tone it down&quot; with regard to her own enjoyment at being young again. But between Tyra inviting a couple of recent Dinotopians, Nellie and Lizzie, along with the other Project Newrad members, Compy and Arcelia, being invited by Horizon, it seemed like what was supposed to be a quiet apology dinner was becoming FAR larger than what Heather had planned for.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
It eventually turned out that there were no other commitments at either the Albers or Luwrie families and they made their calls and soon made their way to the Green/Wilcox home in Animalia. For Sophie it was a bit of a packed ride with JC and Pauline also in the backseat with her, but they managed. In fact for the most part, the ride had been comfortable, even with all of them together and having to arrange their wings in a way that they wouldn&#39;t be sitting on them. In some ways, Sophie&#39;s parents were happy to have JC and Pauline along. There were some times when they felt uneasy when JC referred to Sophie as &quot;mother,&quot; but he was getting better at that.<br />
<br />
As they arrived though, they rapidly found that they weren&#39;t the only ones invited to dinner, which they thought was supposed to be something small and polite, as a sort of apology for what had happened last year. Sophie&#39;s parents, having heard more on Heather&#39;s reform from Sophie were rather fine with the arrangement and were perhaps even comfortable with it after the previous Thanksgiving, though they soon saw that Roland&#39;s parents were a bit more hesitant. The followed their son out of their car, noticed some of the other guests coming up the street and looked a bit nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Roland said this was to be a bit of an apology for what happened last year,&quot; Mrs. Luwrie said to Mrs. Albers as she noticed the group coming.<br />
<br />
One was a male Compsognathus Dinotopian who had a coating of brown feathers along with the comb and wattle of a male chicken, not to mention the spurs. The second was a female Dinotopian with a similar size and build to the first, but lacked some of the distinctive chicken-like features, and like JC and Pauline had noticeable wings on her back. Her coloration was also more like a Magpie&#39;s rather than what and been depicted with regard to what Archaeopteryx looked like.<br />
<br />
&quot;The female is Arcelia,&quot; JC commented to them, &quot;She helped Pauline and I get used to flying again after we were uplifted. She&#39;s an Archaeopteryx Animalian. The male is a Compsognathus, his name is Compy, I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the other two?&quot; Mr. Luwrie <br />
<br />
The other two were both female. One was shorter, closer to Mrs. Albers in height, but with a noted green sail on her back with an orange edge, and while there was some thought that she might be another Spinosaurus Dinotopian, her head and height went against that. The other female was much taller, with a rather long neck, though not as long as Andrew and Jen&#39;s or as long as Nessa&#39;s. At first both the Albers and Luwrie&#39;s parents thought this was another Sauropod Dinotopian, but then they noticed that her hands and feet were webbed and that she had very sharp looking teeth. That was something that no one at Horizon had been able to pinpoint yet, as with many of the herbivorous Dinotopians that had converted often kept much of their human teeth, or at least have the change in their teeth be so little that they could function as before, yet with Carnivorous Dinotopians, their teeth changed completely. Sophie and Roland both had many sharp conical teeth in their beaks. In this the taller Dinotopian had to be a carnivorous one.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think the shorter one is the woman Sophie and I met in Florida,&quot; Roland commented, &quot;Her full name is Elizabeth... She became a Dimetrodon Dinotopian.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which actually isn&#39;t a dinosaur,&quot; Sophie added, &quot;Dimetrodon is actually more closely related to mammals than dinosaurs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the other one?&quot; Mrs. Albers wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Nellie,&quot; came Nellie&#39;s voice as the two groups met on the sidewalk, &quot;I&#39;m a friend of a friend of Tyra&#39;s and was asked to come here to help with some things when I got the invitation. Ye did meet Nessa, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;ve seen her about town... at least prior to opening Dinotopia Aquatica on Skull Island,&quot; Mr. Albers said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;m a similar marine reptile, but not the exact same species... a Crypto... it&#39;s a long name that starts with C,&quot; Nellie answered, &quot;but ye have no need to worry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What brings you all here?&quot; JC asked to Arcelia as there were a series of handshakes at the greeting.<br />
<br />
&quot;There were a few people at Horizon that apparently heard on this gathering and decided it&#39;d be a great idea for everyone from Project Newrad and other new members that Tyra Wrex will be helping to meet and get to know each other,&quot; Arcelia answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not a problem, is it?&quot; Compy wondered, noticing the odd looks that Sophie and Roland gave to each other and then to their parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably not a problem,&quot; Sophie commented, noticing that both her father and Roland&#39;s father momentarily had their eyes on Nellie&#39;s chest for a moment, similar to how their mothers had been impressed with Andrew the previous Thanksgiving, and getting the realization that whatever plans that Heather might have had for an apology to her parents for her behavior last year were probably lost in having so many other guests join the &quot;party.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The dinner itself wasn&#39;t bad. There was a large collection of steaks with some beef, pork, and lamb, along with fish, and it all worked out very well for all involved, and for Compy, Arcelia, JC, and Pauline it was another opportunity to try something they might not ordinarily have eaten before, as Compsognathus, Archaeopteryx, and Microraptor were all carnivorous while their pre-uplifted forms generally didn&#39;t. There was a bit of embarrassment on Heather&#39;s part at the fact that her grandmother only wore a bikini through dinner, and embarrassment that didn&#39;t get any easier.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is not what I had planned,&quot; Heather gave a sigh as she looked down and then to Jeremy and then to Sophie and Roland, looking for some support to try and get Tyra to put more on, &quot;I&#39;d hoped it to be something quiet and to offer an official apology for... what I did last year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were angry and trying to help your grandmother at the time,&quot; Sophie spoke up, &quot;the way you went about it may not have been the best... but from what you&#39;ve told me it wasn&#39;t as though you were just doing it for your own wealth...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw something like that on the news,&quot; Lizzie commented, &quot;didn&#39;t they find though that you were too influenced by animal instinct to truly think straight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly because the bones I used to create my present form...&quot; Heather nodded, &quot;as a Syntixisaurus Rex came from multiple dinosaurs, mostly Theropods and resulted that when I converted... with my conscious mind angry at having been caught in a scheme that I&#39;d intended to use to help my grandmother... I was in no way ready to face the multitude of predatory instincts that came with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But ye&#39;ve clearly reformed,&quot; Nellie commented, &quot;So there&#39;s no problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather felt Jeremy squeeze her free hand, showing some sign of support. She smiled at that and then nodded to the Cryptoclidus Dinotopian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I did reform, but that doesn&#39;t mean that those that I hurt will forget or necessarily forgive,&quot; Heather spoke and then turned to the Albers and Luwrie parents, &quot;and why I&#39;d made the invitation... to say that I&#39;m sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you are forgiven,&quot; Mrs. Luwrie spoke, softly at first as she was a bit hesitant with regard to saying that to the woman who had mauled her son, but in a way, Heather did seem honest in her apology. In addition with the greater presence of all the other Dinotopians that had appeared after that incident there was less about them that seemed monstrous. In a way, they become more and more like the other Animalians, who the Luwrie family had long welcomed and supported. <br />
<br />
There was also the passing glances made to Rex and Jeremy. While they weren&#39;t anywhere near as big as Andrew, they were still impressively built, particularly when compared to many of the other male Animalians. Given the close courtship that her son had with Sophie, there were some times when she had been able to talk with Mrs. Albers from time to time. Some of those discussions did include some fanciful daydreams on &quot;what if&quot; their husbands could be as big or as well endowed, particularly both Mrs. Luwrie and Mrs. Albers were still young enough that sex with their significant other could still be a possibility, even if Sophie and Roland seemed to get grossed out by the idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;See, everything is working fine,&quot; Tyra said with a smile, &quot;and for some added relaxation and socialization... I&#39;d figured a nice trip down to the cave spa would be good for everyone... Stay warm, with winter coming, and get all those kinks out and we can just talk about our day and enjoy each other&#39;s company.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... we didn&#39;t bring swimsuits,&quot; Mr. Albers commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s also a school night,&quot; Mr. Luwrie added nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;We won&#39;t be there long,&quot; Tyra&#39;s smile remained undiminished, &quot;and who said anything about needing a swimsuit?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nude...&quot; Mrs. Albers paled in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can be comfortable,&quot; Rex offered softly, getting the sense that the Albers and Luwries being a bit nervous over some things. As the Cavern Spa, like the showers at WSA or the Claw Coliseum was unisex in that all sides could see each other and there would be some measure of discomfort with many people. Particularly if they got the idea that the Spa would be an opportunity to have sex. It was something that was there, and Tyra very much enjoyed her youth and her curves that there were times where she came off as being rather forward to some people, even though Tyra didn&#39;t have Regressive Hypersexuality. In this, he would step in to try and alleviate those worries, &quot;while everyone can see everyone... the hot spring is divided with one pool for males and the other for females. The two pools are close enough that mated couples can hold hands and talk while enjoying the water... but with the divide, they cannot get into anything truly inappropriate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot; Mr. Luwrie began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some humans have taken to visiting the spa from time to time,&quot; Rex added, &quot;and you have no need to worry. No cameras are allowed past the entry point... And as I said... it is a place where you can relax. Dinosaurs may be warm blooded, but it is comfortable, and no one will judge you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I suppose that couldn&#39;t hurt,&quot; Mrs. Albers said slowly.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The visit for Mr. Albers and Mr. Luwrie might have become more than they&#39;d originally expected, but to their own great surprise it wasn&#39;t exactly a bad one. Though the trip the Cavern Spa had it&#39;s own embarrassment in reaction the spa&#39;s naked female guests. It wasn&#39;t as though they hadn&#39;t seen naked women before, but it had never really been outside of the bedroom and since their respective marriages, only with their wives. The spa was very different, and having to give explicit permission for Sophie and Roland to enter was another thing that was odd and off. <br />
<br />
Ultimately seeing his only daughter in that state didn&#39;t necessarily make things any better for Mr. Albers. Sophie came out with her mother while closely following Jeremy and Heather toward the giant geothermal hot tub that the spa had been built around. He could see that even at her present age, Sophie was already bigger than her mother in nearly every dimension. The height difference was mostly due to the crest on Sophie&#39;s head, but at the same time, her bust and his were larger than her mothers, and to Mr. Albers, the picture of her as a three year old shaking a stuffed parrot at Christmas seemed to stick in the back of his head.<br />
<br />
But, he had to admit that the water was warm and felt remarkably comfortable, and despite a few catcalls from Nellie and Lizzie, possibly just in jest, at Rex and Jeremy and even at Compy and JC there hadn&#39;t been anything too &quot;obscene&quot; as it were. And after everyone got into the water, it did feel remarkably relaxing, as Mr. Albers and Mr. Luwrie sat on the men&#39;s side of the divide with Jeremy, Rex, and Roland with Heather, Tyra, Sophie, and Mrs. Albers and Mrs. Luwrie on the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... the water is comfortable,&quot; Mr. Luwrie said weakly for a moment, &quot;though... is the...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, normally the sort of call calls that were given are not a part of what goes on here,&quot; Rex answered, &quot;Animalians may be more open about sex and so on... but the actual act would still be rather private.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Their edicts, remember, dad,&quot; Sophie commented from across the divide, &quot;there might be some places that are set aside for that sort of thing... Lover&#39;s Woods would be one of them... but they&#39;re still set up to be private.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just so long as you and her don&#39;t end up there before you&#39;re eighteen we&#39;ll have no problems,&quot; Mr. Albers said to Roland.<br />
<br />
Roland wanted to gulp, but said nothing, as that would risk revealing that he and Sophie had already gone all the way, as it were.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;d think that Nellie and Lizzie were just playing as it were,&quot; Tyra commented, &quot;no harm no foul.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But why such a... forward tease?&quot; Mrs. Luwrie asked, somewhat nervously. It was true that she and Mrs. Albers were young enough to consider sex with their respective husbands, and when they had private times when they could be sure that they wouldn&#39;t be interrupted it did still happen from time to time. She also couldn&#39;t deny the occasional fantasy, but that didn&#39;t mean that sort of thing was something that was entirely wanted to be &quot;public.&quot; &quot;I mean... I know some of that sort of stuff does happen... but it&#39;s usually with the types that see someone who they find physically attractive and have no desire to go beyond that point.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But in some ways... ALL of us are like that,&quot; Tyra commented, &quot;we all tend to go for who looks the best first, or who we feel looks the best. To some degree that&#39;s present in everyone and there isn&#39;t anything necessarily wrong in being attracted to someone. There are times when I look back on my own life and wonder how I could have confined myself to certain roles in life and try to hide some things because it would be &quot;sinful&quot; or &quot;improper&quot; or whatever. There&#39;s a lot of fun that can go with that sort of thing...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tyra...&quot; Heather groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, we all have fantasies and desires,&quot; Tyra answered, &quot;trying to repress what is perfectly natural as something wrong is in and of itself wrong. And before you get into any sort of tiff... remember that I can hear you and Jeremy relieving your desires just as well as you can hear me with Rex.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Albers watched as Heather and Jeremy both looked down with the scales under their eyes darkening a bit, guessing that they were blushing. Though, she had to admit that Tyra did have a point. There was some element of &quot;nature&quot; that seemed to apply to many of the things that Animalia did and that they didn&#39;t decide to place moral codes on what was &quot;natural.&quot; And while she had no plans on becoming a nudist or anything like that, there was the sense that Animalia&#39;s deference to nature actually worked quite well and meant that there was no judging of others on those sorts of things. And in that, Mrs. Albers felt fairly comfortable with things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually... Ms. Wrex... I agree,&quot; Mrs. Albers commented, &quot;there are some things where recognizing things as natural... such as desires... isn&#39;t a bad thing. There might be a comfort level thing that are different, but in many ways you are right. Everyone desires something... or someone.&quot;<br />
<br />
That actually let some tension out of the air and Mrs. Albers smiled to her husband as she also felt Sophie pat her back with one hand. In that, while Heather&#39;s planned apology dinner might not have gone the way Heather had planned, Mrs. Albers found it to be a successful one.</p>
