<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Arriving at school, everything was unfamiliar but completely familiar at the same time. He had never actually been in this town before, which seemed to be a quaint college town in the PNW, nor even to the school. But his memories of his new life didn&#39;t fail him. He walked into the school backpack slung over his shoulder and duffel at his side, a few calls and waves from students he seemed to be friendly with, his mind putting names to faces with ease. Pete, Jen, Lewis, Simon.. He knew them, what classes he had with them, he knew most of the students. Seemingly Shane was on good terms with most of them. For once in his life he was in the popular crowd. He stopped by his locker to drop some things off and headed to his first class of the day.<br />
<br />
It was all remarkably.. similar at this point. Going to school, having classes. Sure, these classes were different from his old schedule, and two years ahead of where he was, but he found he knew this stuff. Chris had been honors, but Shane needed to keep his grades up for athletics so he had more standard classes where he could maintain his grade more easily. Except English, apparently he was willing to do honors there, then he remembered he wanted to major in Journalism in college. Honors English was needed to prove to the schools he was good enough. First period was science and as with most first period classes it went by in a daze. If his memories were right second period would be worse. A text on his phone from one of his teammates had him looking at the screen, which caused him to remember Chronivac has installed on his phone. By itself, which was a little creepy, but it was there. And suddenly he had just the way to spice up second period a little.<br />
<br />
20th Century US History was his second class of the day, with Mr Sanchez. Mr Sanchez was not one of the more popular teachers in the school. No one hated him, he was an easy grader and let most of his students get away with almost anything. But no one actually liked him, and the reason was clear when Shane stepped into the classroom and took his seat in the back behind Pete, a teammate and friend from wrestling. &quot;Gor, my man.&quot; Was the only greeting he got, like usual, Pete was on his phone. Most of the students in the class had their phones out and probably would the entire class. Mr Sanchez usually didn&#39;t care unless you were being disruptive. Up at the front of the class was the teacher himself, an overweight man in his sixties, his hair gone grey except where tobacco smoke stained his beard yellow. Actually, overweight didn&#39;t really describe it, he was obese. His chalkboard like always was unmarked. He didn&#39;t use it because he didn&#39;t like getting out of his chair. He&#39;d probably lecture from the book in his monotone like he always did. In short, he looked like a man that had given up and was just going with it until he retired or died. In fact, Shane felt kind of bad for him.<br />
<br />
Hidden behind his friend, Shane pulled out his phone and launched the Chronivac, which looked a lot like the program on his computer, just simplified for mobile. He had an hour and a half in this class, and he was going to use it on Mr Sanchez. The number of names on the list was dizzying. It looked like it could reach the whole school, but luckily he could sort the list and he found the name he was looking for: Eric Sanchez.<br />
<br />
Name: Eric Sanchez<br />
Age: 67<br />
Gender: Male<br />

<br />
He didn&#39;t need to know his teacher&#39;s cock size.. but the Chronivac seemed to think it one of the important data points. Shane assumed because people probably altered it more often. He hadn&#39;t really dug into the program back home, having just poked the randomize button and gotten lucky, but here he had an idea in mind so he spent some time fiddling with the program. He found more stats he could alter in a series of drop downs, either under some of the stats he already saw, like build going into more detail about muscle distribution, or under new ones he could pull up and add to the list, which he found hairiness. He set that option as a favorite, he had a feeling he&#39;d be using it a lot, it even offered a detailed breakdown by location. First, he made sure his changes would affect the world, and no one but himself would notice, then he set to work. After about twenty minutes, he had his selection made. Mr Sanchez was droning on about Regan. He gave it one last look over, before pressing the button to begin.<br />
<br />
Name: Enrique Sanchez<br />

<br />
One click, and the change was set. Shane just leaned back and waited for the magic to happen. In fact, he was the only one in the class watching the teacher. Almost immediately he was adjusting the way he was perched in the chair. Usually slumped over his desk, his wide ass taking up most of the seat, he started to sit up straighter. It was like watching one of those commercials for magic fat burning pills. It was just pulling back into him. He wasn&#39;t deflating, and his skin remained taught, but  the whole shape of his body was changing. That wasn&#39;t the only obvious change either. His face was smoothing out and his hair was obviously darker, the gray filling in with black as if he was graying in reverse, first to salt and pepper, then to just at his temples and some in his beard. At this point, he did something Shane had never seen Mr Sanchez do in class. He stood up. Picking up his book, he continued to lecture as he moved around to the front of his desk and leaned back against it.<br />
<br />
As soon as he stood up, Shane was worried Mr Sanchez&#39;s baggy pants would fall right off. They didn&#39;t. His clothes were baggy, but they seemed to be altering as well at a slight delay. The shirt the now slightly pudgy Mr Sanchez wore would even have fit him minutes ago, but was obviously a bit too big for him. Now, he looked like a slightly overweight man in his forties. Once fit, but maybe having let himself go around the middle. Shane would have liked a better look at what was going on under those clothes, maybe there was an option somewhere he could get rid of them for the change and to come back after. Hopefully with no one noticing they were missing. That was a problem for later.<br />
<br />
As Mr Sanchez continued to age backwards, his pasty skin started to sport some color, first sinking into a healthy tan, then darkening to a pale brown. With his hair now back to being jet black, he no longer looked like an old white dude, his features subtly altering. Puffy cheeks and saggy jowls were gone, and his wrinkles had completely vanished except for a few fine lines at the corners of his eyes. Actually, he was apparently not all that bad looking under all that fat. His simple, unremarkable haircut altering into a stylish, slicked back undercut, his beard going from scruffy and unkempt to thick, glossy and well trimmed. The hair on his forearms to was dark and a bit more pronounced.<br />
<br />
Shane was almost surprised to see Mr Sanchez shirt laying flat against his torso. The gut had completely vanished, he was lean. Completely unremarkable body wise. It wasn&#39;t helped by clothes that were still just a bit too big, but they didn&#39;t seem to be shrinking anymore. As Mr Sanchez moved from the desk, picked up a marker, and began writing on the whiteboard - something else Shane couldn&#39;t remember him every doing - Shane saw why those clothes were still too big. With the fat gone, Mr Sanchez was filling out again, but this time with muscle. It was an interesting show from behind, watching as those shoulders quickly began filling the top of the shirt which was now a stylish, blue button up. Shane actually had to reach down and adjust himself as Mr Sanchez&#39;s arms began filling out the sleeve, to the point were the fabric was taught against his triceps, and the way his ass now filled out the seat of his black chinos, down to muscular thighs, lending their shape to the fabric, the full muscular legs of a soccer player, used to running and kicking. Shane was know wishing those pants had fallen down, just so he could get a look at that full, bubbly ass.<br />
<br />
Mr Shanchez lecture hadn&#39;t broken once during the transformation. But his voice had gone from a bland monotone, to a sonorous baritone rumble. And looking around, he noticed most of the eyes were now, for once, on the teacher. Especially most of the female students. Mr Sanchez had gone from disgusting to the faculty hottie in about twenty minutes. The changes weren&#39;t done yet, but the class was more active. Questions were being asked and answered, discussion happened, and Mr Sanchez was smiling. He definitely didn&#39;t seem like he had given up anymore. The changes had slowed but they were still going on. From the front, Shane could trace the lines on Mr Sanchez&#39;s pectorals through the fabric of his shirt, and as his chest continued to fill out a few of the upper buttons came undone on their own, spreading to reveal a pelt of dark, trimmed hair dipping between his muscular pectorals. Even the bulge in the front of his pants was hard to miss. Shane had decided to give him a little gift there.<br />
<br />
Even Shane found it hard to take his eyes off of his teacher, a charismatic personality coming to the fore, no doubt part of altering the world to fit the changes. He was a man in the prime of his life, now, and he acted like it. Then just like that, the bell rang, and students began packing up to file out the door. Just as he was about to get up he heard Mr Sanchez speak up, &quot;Shane, a moment.&quot; <br />
<br />
The rest of the students gone he stepped over to Mr Sanchez&#39;s desk. The man even seemed to smell good. Definitely compared to his old reek of stale ashtray. Now he smelt woody and musky, and this close he could see the line of every muscle through the thin, silky material of his shirt. He wanted to bury his face in that exposed chest hair and drink in that aroma. &quot;Are you alright? You seem distracted today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shane blinked a few times, coming out of his day dream. &quot;No, yeah, I mean. It&#39;s Friday, been a long week of practice and studying for finals.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr Sanchez nodded as if that were acceptable. &quot;I know it&#39;s almost the end of the year, but don&#39;t let that senioritis set it. We wouldn&#39;t want our star wrestler doing any thing to risk that college scholarship. Remember, if anything is bothering you my door is always open, no matter what.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;As if I can tell you I want to plow your ass,&#39; Shane thought to himself but settled for a, &quot;Sure thing, Mr Sanchez,&quot; and headed for the door.</p>
