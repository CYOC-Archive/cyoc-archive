<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bobby noticed his parents in the park with his younger sister. Bobby&#39;s mother Annabelle was encouraging his 9-year-old sister Amber to do more active sports outside. Amber had told Bobby how despite being a girl she loved to play sports. Bobby thought that his sister was not that good with any of them but found it fun that he always had someone to throw ball with.<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s it going little sport?&quot; Bobby&#39;s father Mark greeted him as Mark was reading news from the smartphone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I bought this ring from the magic shop over there. The owner said that... uhm...&quot; Bobby answered and pointed his finger towards the street where the said store had just vanished. &quot;Nevermind. The owner said that it&#39;s a magic ring!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark just laughed and gave a pat on Bobby&#39;s head as they joined together to have some family activity together.<br />
<br />
As the sun was setting in the horizon Mark drove his whole family back at home. Bobby was still thinking about putting the ring in to his finger but didn&#39;t find a good target to test it&#39;s powers.<br />
<br />
As the night begun to come and both Bobby and his sister Amber were put to sleep. Bobby whispered to her sister and asked what she wanted to be older.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; Amber said under the sheets.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like to see?&quot; Bobby asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;See what?&quot; Amber asked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;See what kind of person you&#39;re going to be once your older.&quot; Bobby giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are we going to do that?&quot; Amber nervously asked. &quot;Magic?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well duh. I got this magic ring and with it I could make you older in an instant.&quot; Bobby chuckled.<br />
<br />
In the same moment Bobby put the ring in to her pointer finger and thought about her sister being as old as his mother.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Bobby felt how Amber begun to make noise in her bed and he saw how his sister rose up from the bed and looked like as if she was growing longer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amber, what&#39;s... going on there?&quot; Bobby asked.<br />
<br />
Amber didn&#39;t say anything but run towards Bobby. In the small bed light Amber looked older and as they both looked at each other Amber finally said with trembled voice: &quot;Is this what growing up is?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amber had to take off her shirt, panties and pants as she had grown too big and asked if she could hop inside Bobby&#39;s bed.<br />
<br />
She gave a big hug to her brother as she was now as old as Bobby by now. The growth was quick and as was looking year older than Bobby. The hugging got tighter as Amber&#39;s chest begun to grow with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m getting hairy.&quot; Amber said to Bobby as she felt every corner of her body getting new hair were there weren&#39;t none.<br />
<br />
Bobby looked in horror as the ring truly was turning Amber older and witness how her naked sister was now approaching her early twenties.<br />
<br />
She sounded more adult than than a kid and Bobby begun to feel weird as she was getting bigger and almost overwhelmed her in his own bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bobby. You look so baby compared to me.&quot; Amber said as she kept getting older.<br />
<br />
Bobby wasn&#39;t sure what he was looking at as Amber was now closer to her mid twenties and looked like one of mother&#39;s friends instead of chubby cheeked sister she was used to. The adult Amber talked like an adult and as the bed begun to make a creaking noise. Amber hopped out of the bed while Bobby in pyjamas followed her.<br />
<br />
In the floor Bobby was able to see her looking more and more like their mother but much skinnier. In the dark she could only see her sisters silhouette and as she stood up she was twice as taller than what Amber used to be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I adult now?&quot; Amber asked as she spun herself in the middle of the room.<br />
<br />
She was now in her early thirties and still getting older. Her breasts begun to drop down and she looked like Bobby&#39;s and Amber&#39;s aunt. Bobby wasn&#39;t sure what to think about this and asked her grown up sister how did she feel.<br />
<br />
Her voice had gotten much deeper and Bobby found it funny how she sounded just like their mother but spoke more like his sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel fine. I just don&#39;t like this hair that&#39;s all over my body.&quot; Amber expressed herself. &quot;Everything is small and even my shirt looks like what my doll would wear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amber was excited over her new changes and couldn&#39;t contain her happiness. This over joyed displayed alerted their parents and Bobby could hear footsteps approaching the door.<br />
<br />
As it flung open and Annabelle saw naked adult Amber. She let out a scream which scared both Bobby and Amber. Bobby tried to intervine and say that the girl was Amber but Annabelle was already shouting to Mark for help.<br />
<br />
Bobby had to do something but what...</p>
