<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake walked down the street as fast as he could, but just before he reached the corner, he heard someone <br />
yelling behind him. He turned around and saw a man equally as rotund as himself. It was his neighbour, Graham. <br />
Shoot, he must of saw him leave the house! &quot;Excuse me sir! Sorry to bother you, but why were you leaving my <br />
neighbour's house? And without a shirt? I don't believe I've ever seen you around here before&quot;. <br />
<br />
Jake told the man the same story he told Matt earlier, with a few differences given his new age. &quot;Sorry, this <br />
is my nephew's house. He's gone away for the weekend with his wife and asked if I could check up on his son <br />
while they were away. I stayed the night and ended up getting my dinner over my clothes, which then shrunk in <br />
the wash. I thought I saw a shop around the corner that I could get a new outfit from, given how my nephew's <br />
clothes are a tad small&quot;. <br />
<br />
Graham nodded his head and then said &quot;There's only a clock shop around there. I could lend you some of my <br />
clothing if you want. You look like you're around my size&quot;. <br />
<br />
Jake considered the man's offer. he really did need new clothes, and it was colder outside than he expected. <br />
But Matt was still in the house with the clock. He couldn't be out too long, but it should only take 5 minutes <br />
at the most. &quot;That would really help me, thanks!&quot;. He followed Graham back to his house.<br />
<br />
Matt was watching the TV, hoping Jake would get back home soon. He was getting impatient. A look at the clock <br />
showed it had only been around 5 minutes. He was now 20 years old, a fine beard grew on his face, but his body <br />
hadn't changed much in size. Matt couldn't remember how old he was before he turned on the clock, but he kept <br />
repeating his friend's age, 45, in his head so he'd know when to turn the clock off. It was effective for the <br />
time being, but it was going slow. He had changed the flow of time to about a year every 3 minutes earlier. <br />
Maybe he should speed it up. It's not like his friend was going to be that long at the shop. He adjusted the <br />
clock again, now at its extreme of 1 year every minute again, and got back to watching TV.<br />
<br />
Graham had gone upstairs to get some clothes while Jake sat in his living room. He'd never been in the man's <br />
house. He'd barely even spoken to the man before now. His parents didn't like him, but he didn't know why. It <br />
was clean, much cleaner than his own house, and littered with various fragile figurines. He was afraid of <br />
touching anything, expecting them to shatter on impact. Graham came down with a plain shirt and a pair of <br />
pants and watched as Jake took off his pants, before averting his eyes once he realised the man wasn't wearing <br />
underwear. The clothes fit Jake perfectly and he thanked his host before leaving. But Graham stopped him. <br />
&quot;While you're here, wouldn't you like a drink or something to eat? I don't get many visitors, but I should <br />
have something about&quot;. <br />
<br />
Jake's stomach growled. He realised he hadn't eaten anything since this whole fiasco begun and his larger <br />
belly was calling out for food. He did tell Matt he was going to be out a while. A few more minutes couldn't <br />
hurt. &quot;I guess I could stay for a bit, but I do have to get back to Ma-, uhm, Jake soon. I told him I'd only <br />
be out for a few minutes.&quot;.<br />
<br />
Matt felt like he needed to stretch while the commercials were on, he muscles aching slightly. He stood up to <br />
stretch, then walked over to the mirror to examine his body. His beard had grown to a similar length as Jake's <br />
with strands of grey hair breaking through on his chin. His body was starting to soften, his abs disappearing <br />
behind a layer of fat. Hair thickly covered his chest and stomach, giving him a bearish look. More hair had <br />
spread to his upper arms, giving them a patchy coating. He still looked like the 30 year old man he was back <br />
when Jake had left, but he knew that was wrong. His memory kept on changing, but the clock couldn't take away <br />
what he knew about it. He sat back on the sofa as his show came back on, still repeating 45 to himself, but he <br />
was starting to forget why it was an important number. It had something to do with Jake, but he couldn't <br />
remember what.<br />
<br />
Graham had made some coffee and laid out a few cakes on a plate for them both. Graham told him a little about <br />
his life, how he works for the nearby film studios, how he was planning a holiday to San Francisco, how he <br />
rarely spoke to the family next door but how he knew he should probably question the strange topless man <br />
leaving the house. Jake enjoyed the chat with the man, wondering why his parents never invited him round more. <br />
Then Graham asked him about his life. He didn't know what to say, he couldn't tell him about the clock, but he <br />
wasn't a very good liar. He was surprised he'd fooled anyone so far. He told the man what he remembered of his <br />
grandfather's life, who he realised, with a drop in his stomach, was only 5 years older than he was now. <br />
Graham listened to every word, thoroughly interested in his fake life. The talk was distracting Jake from his <br />
original intentions.<br />
<br />
Matt's show had finished and he considered whether to make something to eat. He picked up the clock and took <br />
it into the kitchen with him and found a large bag of doughnuts, which he scoffed down in no time flat, crumbs <br />
littering his beard. He rubbed his expanding belly with satisfaction, the hair covering it was starting to <br />
turn grey. But that's what happens when you reach 40, as did the sudden weight gain and his quickly thinning <br />
hair. Looking at his face in a nearby mirror, he thought that he could've looked worse for his age. He still <br />
had some hair on his head unlike Jake, but it'll probably be gone by the time he was 50. At the moment, his <br />
hairline was several inches higher and made an M-like shape with the middle at the tip of his forehead, a bald <br />
spot expanding at the back. He wiped the crumbs out of his beard, which was now more grey than brown. Lines <br />
were radiating from the corners of his eyes and mouth, giving his face a rugged demeanour. He thought about <br />
turning the clock off now, but the number 45 kept coming to his head. Was he trying to reach that age? He <br />
couldn't remember any more. He left the clock alone and went to explore the fridge for more food.<br />
<br />
Jake and Graham were heavily invested in a conversation about a British sci-fi series when Jake happened to <br />
notice the time on the clock behind Graham's head and realised he'd been there for over 20 minutes now. He <br />
didn't want to end his conversation with Graham, but he also had to make sure Matt didn't end up senile. &quot;Oh <br />
geez, I'm really sorry but I have to get back to Jake to make sure he's OK. He might be worried since I said <br />
I'd only be gone a few minutes&quot;. <br />
<br />
Graham sighed and said &quot;OK, but you're welcome to come by whenever you can. Where did you say you lived <br />
again?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, I'm on the other side of town. Takes about 30 minutes to get here, but yeah, I'll try and come by the <br />
next time I'm in town&quot;. <br />
<br />
Graham smiled and bid his new friend goodbye. Jake thought he was a nice man. If he could fix things, he could <br />
occasionally use his clock to make himself older and continue their new friendship. But for now, he had to <br />
find out if there was a way to reverse it in the first place. He reached the gate outside his house. He should <br />
really check on Matt to make sure he hadn't gotten too old, given how long he was distracted. But his friend <br />
was adjusting the clock when he left the room last. He be in his twenties for all he knew. He could still have <br />
time to get to the clock shop and find a solution before getting back. What to do...</p>
