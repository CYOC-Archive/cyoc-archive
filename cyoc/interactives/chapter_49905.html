<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;It was Isabelle, Hope, Grace, and Zylphia?&quot; Jensen asked as Jenny finished her report.<br />
<br />
Martha was the one who had answered the phone during their phone call and retrieved Jenny, as she was the only one at the estate named Jennifer, now. Jenny was now finishing her report to Jensen and Kaylee, who were overseeing the work the she-wolves were doing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, father,&quot; Jenny nodded, &quot;friends of yours, I believe?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hangers on really,&quot; Jensen dismissed it, &quot;but yes, they were friends of mine when I was Jennifer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're much better now,&quot; Kaylee told him, running one paw down his back.<br />
<br />
Jensen smiled, somehow feeling Kaylee's devotion to him radiate of the she-wolf. Jenny watched this with the same sort of disgust that any kid would have at seeing his/her parents be romantic with each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mushy stuff,&quot; Jenny groaned.<br />
<br />
Jensen then turned his full attention to the black furred pup.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are they coming?&quot; Jensen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I invited them to a sleepover as you instructed,&quot; Jenny answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good,&quot; Jensen answered, &quot;You can go back outside.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny then scampered off while Jensen turned back to Kaylee.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;A favor, to ask of me, Auntie?&quot; Alice asked politely as she looked up into Fran's blue eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this about Julie, sister?&quot; Darla asked, sounding curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;A little,&quot; Fran answered, &quot;You see, like you Darla and I were once male humans...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you're better now,&quot; Alice interrupted.<br />
<br />
Fran nodded, &quot;Yes, we ALL are... but I have a family that misses me very much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Julie...?&quot; Alice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My wife,&quot; Fran answered, &quot;mother to two beautiful daughters that I sired before I became what I am now. Because of the transform and dare that Darla and I were put under, I said some things that likely broke Julie's heart... and... and I feel guilty for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could bring them here!&quot; Alice volunteered, &quot;Little glass wolves!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; Fran and Darla spoke in unison in a very firm tone before Fran resumed speaking on her own.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I still love Julie, almost as much as I love the Master,&quot; Fran spoke, &quot;I want her and my daughters to join us when it's safe to bring them in, but not as glass wolves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I have used my turn, and we passed the full moon two nights ago,&quot; Alice pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I still have mine,&quot; Fran spoke, &quot;the turn isn't the problem... it's trying to get Julie to understand that everything is fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want me to go to your old house?&quot; Alice asked.<br />
<br />
Fran nodded, &quot;Tell my girls that their &quot;daddy&quot; is safe and sound and looks forward to seeing them soon, and tell Julie that I love her very much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then return here,&quot; Darla added to Fran's request, feeling strong protective instincts toward the glass wolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, Mother, Auntie,&quot; Alice answered as she stood up and began to head back toward the mirror, &quot;I shall do your favor.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you wish to handle you're friend's transformation, Master?&quot; Kaylee asked as they looked in a room where Roger and Ulysses were placing items to be sold in neat organized piles that would allow the wolves, or the shadows to easily box them for mailing after they had been sold.<br />
<br />
&quot;It will go much like the way the staff's transformations went,&quot; Jensen answered, &quot;We'll have them draw straws, whoever gets the shortest becomes another token male... although we might have to make him masculine enough to counter Nick. You and the twins are the only ones that hold any &quot;rank&quot;. The rest are all to be subordinate, and Nick's nomination for a position unnerves me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're ALL loyal to you, Master,&quot; Kaylee reminded her mate.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Jensen smiled, &quot;but if you fight among each other over who is more loyal or who serves the best, or whether or not we have a &quot;chain of command&quot; would destroy the pack... and since the other males are either too young like Ulysses or rather scrawny like the other two, we'll need another male that can keep Nick in check. He won't push for a &quot;command structure&quot; when there is a male present that could match him, besides myself, that is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fran might wish her &quot;wife&quot; to take that role,&quot; Kaylee commented, remembering the argument from lunch, &quot;although she might still prefer to keep her as a she-wolf. I didn't want to pry into her former marital affairs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen nodded, remembering the lunchtime argument, &quot;we'll deal with that when Fran's wife joins us. In the short term, we have much more to prepare for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Caroline's been doing a good job as a fore-wolf,&quot; Kaylee spoke, &quot;They'll all be tired, but I think they will get the job done before we go to bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen nodded, but the renovations weren't what he was referring to.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was referring to the friends of mine that would become she-wolves,&quot; Jensen spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither of us hold our turns anymore,&quot; Kaylee spoke, &quot;You control the game, but that is through our loyalty to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen smiled again, &quot;I'm talking about planning the perfect form they will take.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Kaylee answered, trying to hide her desire to keep Jensen all to herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that is where you will come in,&quot; Jensen continued, &quot;because your present frame and build makes you the perfect mate... your breasts are large, your hips are wide, but not so much that you lose athleticism...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're modeling them after me?&quot; Kaylee asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Physically, yes,&quot; Jensen answered, &quot;as since I will now be their primary &quot;love interest&quot; they will need someone to take the role I held when I was &quot;Jennifer&quot;, and that will be you, Alpha Female.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee found herself blushing at that.<br />
<br />
&quot;What colors shall we make them?&quot; Kaylee asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking a more natural color tone for them,&quot; Jensen answered, &quot;these bright anime colors are interesting, but my former friends aren't into them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee then thought for a moment, and began to comment, &quot;what about a charcoal black for Zylphia, a milk chocolate shade of brown for Hope, a dark chocolate color for Isabelle, and mixture of white, gray, black, and brown for Grace... or some variation. Their coloring of their fur will be to suit your needs, Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen nodded, &quot;those seem fine. And now to set the trap for them... we'll need a she-wolf who has a turn...&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
Meanwhile on the second floor, Nick and Nicole finally finished opening up what would become the den area for all of the new wolves. There was sheet rock laying all over, and there were some pipes and wires to be rearranged before more work could be done, but the hard part of opening up the room was done.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do we do next?&quot; Nick asked, &quot;do we move this stuff out to be burned or thrown away or...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Terri and Sandi will remove the debris,&quot; Nicole answered, &quot;and June and Megan will be along to rework the wires and pipes. We're to figure out how we will sleep and wait for the debris to be cleared up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still say we should all sleep together,&quot; Nick spoke as he began to nibble at Nicole's neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; Nicole gave a slight moan, loving the attention, even if it wasn't the master, &quot;but what about Ulysses? He's only a boy... older then the pups, but still too young to be taking a mate or pleasing us... and the others will not want him there while we have sex with you, Roger, or Lawrence. Which is why I wondered about having a den for the males and a den for us... to let in the Master and Alpha female and whomever else we allow to enter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick continued to nibble and had actually progressed to licking the gray she-wolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is serious, Nick,&quot; Nicole said firmly, &quot;please focus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Focus, right,&quot; Nick snapped back into reality.</p>
