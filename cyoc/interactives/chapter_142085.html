<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You searched almost everything in the room with the bear and you both find no signs of any humans. The bear seemed frustrated at this, and he punched a hole in the wall out of rage. Feeling that the last thing you needed was a group member alerting any other threats to your position, as well as possibly become a threat himself, you place your hand on his shoulder and he looked back at you.<br />
<br />
You try to convey that there was nothing to be stressed out about, but the bear disagreed and growled at you. You then paused and rubbed the bear&#39;s stomach and kissed his cheek and he blushed a bit and groaned as his cock started poking out of his sheath.<br />
<br />
You then convey to him the connection you have to him in your form, and how in your eyes he seemed dreamier than the cat, or even the alpha for that matter. The bear looked back at you in disbelief, and he squinted at you and unsheathed his burly cock wanting you to prove it.<br />
<br />
Upon seeing this gesture you unsheathed your own cocks and placed your hands on the bear&#39;s hips before kneeling down and sticking your face Between his asscheeks.<br />
<br />
The bear let out a low growl as you did this and he clenched his thighs and locked your muzzle in place, planted up against his gaping asshole. However you enjoyed the feeling and you had just enough room to open your snout and take a long lick out of him causing the bear to moan loudly and loosen his grip on you. You continued eagerly, tasting the ass and the rubbery surface to your heart&#39;s content, making the bear eternally pleased while the next victim changed inside of his gut. <br />
<br />
You then grabbed the bear’s legs, and catching him off-guard you pulled him to the ground and he slammed down in his stomach with a loud SMACK!! This had to have hurt a lot, like a belly flop but on a solid floor, but the pleasure was just too much on the bear’s mind right now as you proceeded to take his thighs into your hands and separate his cheeks to get a better taste of his asshole.<br />
<br />
The cheeks slowly but surely parted ways and you saw the large puckering hole for yourself, so you put yourself to the biggest test of your life and as you took your next large lick, you dug you tongue into the bear’s asshole in attempt to eat it out.<br />
<br />
The bear seemed incredibly satisfied by this as he let out moans upon moans of pleasure until he let out a booming roar, and out of nowhere a puddle of brown latex splattered all around him. You then pulled away from the bear’s ass, your teeth, and tongue stained with brown latex as you did so and the bear stood up and towered over your, grinning.<br />
<br />
He seemed to want more out of you, so you submitted to him and turned your rear to him and you got on hands and knees, exposing your ass with the rising of your tail and looking back at him, drooling over what you just did in a mixture of green and brown latex.<br />
<br />
The bear then separated your cheeks out wide causing you to cry out and hiss in both pleasure and pain, right before he thrusted his large brown cock into your rear. Your twin cocks were already fully erect and you felt the bear smack your ass as hard as he could and you screamed out in pain as he did, but it turned you on as well.<br />
<br />
The bear then thrusted into you, and then he smacked you twice, then one more thrust and three smacks. You felt his throbbing cock leak with precum as you orgasmed the first time with your tight ass getting tortured this much, but the cycle was only beginning.<br />
<br />
With every thrust the bear slapped you one additional time than the last to mark how many times he’s thrusted into you. You counted as well and you made it to thrust number 19, right before the bear climaxed and you did too, after five orgasms.<br />
<br />
As the protector your role is to prevent harm at all costs, even if you have to take it yourself. That being said, the bear knew this and seemed to think that you had the superior endurance when it came to being his bitch. You felt honored by the compliment as the bear demonstrated his strength by picking you up and allowing you to sit on his lap, up against his stomach as he sat against the wall.<br />
<br />
Your cocks were fully erect and came up to your chest in length, and as the bear saw this comparison between your dicks and his own, he growled at you and smacked your ass as hard as he possibly could and you cried out in pain. You just grinned at him as raw as your ass was now, and you curled your tail around his large body and rubbed his larger ballsac, and wider shaft to remind him of it and he sighed then hugged you against him, and your bodies squeaked loudly as the two of you gave each other a long, tongue filled kiss of passion.<br />
<br />
The bear believed you now beyond anything, and you never wanted him to pull out now as his seed sat freshly inside your sore asshole. It was then that something happened to take you away from him and back into reality, and it was...</p>
