<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Van gave himself one last look over in the mirror. He had to admit, as much as he hated to, that the changes made to him were more appealing. He filled out his jeans nicely and the pale blue silk button-up he chose rested nicely over his chest, even if the fabric brushing over his nipples made his cock jump. Maybe he could cover those with something like runners did? Then again, if this went the way it should he didn&#39;t want o have to explain why he had on band-aid pasties. He had reactivated his account shortly after his last ex dumped him, and really he just wanted the hook up with no strings. Luckily, Angela the one who contacted him seemed to want the same.<br />
<br />
He snapped his hand down, realizing he had be rubbing his nipple through the fabric of his shirt. &quot;Fuck that fairy.&quot; He muttered. Part of him wanted to end it now, but there was a point of pride. He wanted to outlast the fucker. A ring from the front door of the building broke him out of his thoughts and he pressed to buzz the person in without even checking who it was. A knock came on his door a few minutes later and he opened it wide to see Angela. She looked even better than in her pic, she was wearing a skimpy dress, exposing much of her rounded breasts and the fabric clung over her trim waist and round hips. Long auburn hair flowed down her back almost to her waist.<br />
<br />
She grinned at him. &quot;Ooo.. you should take a new profile pic, it does not do you justice.&quot; Her voice was a silky purr. For a moment Van had a sneaking suspicion this hook up was too good to be true, but shook off the thought and went along with it.  He just grinned and ushered her inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Drink?&quot; He asked, closing the door behind her as she set her purse down on his coffee table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, you have whiskey?&quot; She asked as she slinked back over to him.<br />
<br />
He blinked a few times at the request and nodded. He puled out a pair of glasses and his whiskey bottle, pouring them each a few fingers. Which she knocked back quickly and motioned for more. Van obliged. That off feeling crept up on him again. She was like a woman some horny smut writer would invent. A straight man&#39;s wet dream.<br />
<br />
She only took one sip of her refilled drink and Van was only able to get a few sips of his own before she was on top of him, unbuttoning his shirt. Opening the front wide, her hands ran over his chest and shoulders. &quot;Listen, I don&#39;t want the song and dance. Where&#39;s the bedroom?&quot;<br />
<br />
Van gulped down the rest of his drink and took her by the hand, guiding her towards hi bedroom. She twisted her arms behind her and unzipped her dress, shimmying out of it as Van slipped out of his shirt. He gulped slightly as he stepped up and pushed him back onto the bed. She laid down next to him, her lips exploring his chest, pulling a sharp gasp from him as she brushed over his magically over-tuned nipples.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooo.. like that, do you?&quot; She giggled, teasing them a little more. Van could feel his cock chubbing up in his pants, making a quite obvious tent in the denim. Angela looked down at the large bulge and back up to him. &quot;Big boy, huh?&quot; She undid his fly and slipped her hand down the front of his pants, her eyes going even wider. &quot;Very big.&quot; Slipping out of his pants she bit her lip. &quot;I&#39;m not sure I can handle you..&quot;<br />
<br />
Van frowned, but she put a finger to his lips. &quot;But, tell me. Do you like to experiment?&quot; Her finger rand down the middle of his chest and stomach, around his cock and he felt it push against his hole. He was about to speak up to stop her and it slipped inside him and he let out a little gasp. Did Abaltis do something there too? It felt so good he found himself pushing against her hand.<br />
<br />
She grinned and slid off the bed. &quot;One second.&quot; She left the bedroom and Van collapsed back on his bed.<br />
<br />
Just his luck, he had a porn star&#39;s rod and the first woman he tried to hook up with couldn&#39;t even handle it. He lifted his head as he heard he step back in, and he winced when he saw her. Angela had put on a strap on slightly bigger than his old tool. &quot;You can&#39;t be serious, you want to peg me?&quot; He said sharply.<br />
<br />
Instead of looking hurt, she just grinned. &quot;You liked the finger, just try it. And maybe I&#39;ll see if I can take any of your tool in my ass.&quot; She lifted a bottle in her hand, wiggling the lube at him.<br />
<br />
Van gulped. At this point he just needed to get off. Torn between ending it now and letting her have her way, his horniness won out and he nodded. He stared at the ceiling as he heard her spreading lube over the strap on, then let out another soft gasp as e felt more lube being spread on his hole, her fingers slipping inside him as she spread it about. &quot;Oh fuuuck.&quot; He said as he felt her slowly pushing the toy inside of him, his cock twitching eagerly at the stimulation. It felt.. good. Too good. There was a little pain as he stretched around the toy, but sent a shiver through him. A small whimper escaped him as he bucked his hips.<br />
<br />
&quot;See, I knew you&#39;d like it.&quot; Van pulled his knees up, wanting more and ashamed he wanted more, tears forming in the corner of his eyes even as he begged her to thrust harder. Angela obliged, her hands on his hips as she pegged him with the dildo, slipping in and out easily. His cock drooled on his chest, thick and musky. He grabbed his tool in his hands and began to stroke in time with her thrusts. Once more, it wasn&#39;t long before he was cumming, splattering his own torso in rope after gooey rope of his own seed.<br />
<br />
Angela slowed her thrusts, then pulled out as se heard him moaning and gasping with each twitch of his cock. He bounced a little on the mattress as she landed on the bed next to him. &quot;Ooo.. quite a mess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah..&quot; Van said, short of breath. &quot;I can go get clean..&quot; He stopped making his offer as she began to clean him up with her tongue, giving him one of the more erotic baths he had ever had, Angela eagerly lapping up his messy orgasm as he laid back and enjoyed the attentions. He started to doze off under the attentions, and the last thin he could remember before sleep took him was her pulling his head onto her pillowy chest, stroking her hand through his hair.<br />
<br />
After what felt like the best sleep he had in months, Van woke to an arm around him, he head resting on something firm and warm.. and.. fuzzy? He opened his eyes looked up, expecting to see Angela and instead was looking up at a grinning Abaltis, his head on the fairy&#39;s chest, one muscular arm wrapped around him. &quot;Wakey wakey.&quot;<br />
<br />
Van quickly scrambled out of bed, grabbing his shoe and brandishing it like a weapon at the nude fairy laying on his bed. &quot;The fuck?! Where&#39;s Angela?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right here.&quot; Came Angela&#39;s soft purr, right out of Abaltis&#39; mouth. He laughed, which came out in his own deep rough voice. &quot;I wanted to give you a little taste of what being my pet is like. Sure, you didn&#39;t get to take my real cock, but you definitely enjoyed the tongue bath.&quot; Abaltis lifted the dildo he had used to fuck Van last night and wiggled it in the air. &quot;You can keep this, to practice with. Loosen you up a bit more for when I really fuck you.&quot; He hefted his cock in his other hand, giving it a stroke while leering at Van.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking asshole.&quot; Van muttered as he rubbed his cheek with his shoulder, throwing the shoe aside.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the plan.&quot; Abaltis said with a laugh, dropping the dildo on the bed and scooching backwards to sit up and look at Van, scratching his hairy pecs as he considered the human. &quot;While I&#39;m here I might as well collect today&#39;s payment.&quot; Van&#39;s eyes shot over to his alarm clock. Eight in the morning. He let out a soft curse. &quot;So much to pick from, so many ideas, but I have time. Oh, I know. You seemed to enjoy having something soft to lay your head on, I think I&#39;d like to try that.&quot; Abaltis snapped his fingers, then got off the bed. &quot;I&#39;ll be back later pet. Enjoy the change.&quot; And with a wink, he vanished.<br />
<br />
Van collapsed on the edge of the bed. Had he seriously been fucked by that fairy in disguise last night? No wonder it seemed to good to be true. He scratched at his chest, idly attending a small itch as he thought things through. Maybe he should just back out, but he felt that stubbornness rising again. No, he was going to prove to that ass of a fairy he could do this. He grumbled and scratched at his chest some more, a feeling like ants crawling over it, then stopped as he felt stubble.<br />
<br />
One thing Van had always been grateful for was he was never a very hairy guy. Sure, he could barely grow a beard, but it also meant he only needed to trim a little. But looking down, he noticed a patch of brown stubble in the middle of his chest, and it was spreading. His itching turned to full on scratching as if trying to tear the hair from his skin, but it was no use. The stubble spread out from the center, fanning across his small pecs, a strip spreading down the middle of his stomach to meet with his thickening pubes. The stubble grew longer, curling. Itching under his arms made him lift one to check, seeing the bit of a bush he had in his pits growing thicker as well. He cussed and hopped off the bed. This he could so something about.<br />
<br />
Marching into his bedroom, he pulled out his clippers, then methodically began to drag them through the new coating of hair on his chest and stomach. It took him a while but ten minutes later the sink was full of trimmings and his torso was almost as smooth as it had been when he woke up. It&#39;d be a bit of work but at least Abaltis wouldn&#39;t have his way on this one. He shut off the clippers and set them down. Almost immediately, the itching started again and in moments he was covered in stubble again, that grew back out to a fuzzy covering in less than a minute.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tsk tsk.&quot; Came a voice in his head. &quot;You know, when you shave, it only grows in thicker.&quot;<br />
<br />
Van&#39;s eye went wide as he looked down. Instead of his chest getting furrier though, his arms and legs were sprouting a bit more hair, making it look less unbalanced, even up his thighs. He scratched at his face as the itching spread up to his jaw, staring in the mirror as in mere moments his sideburns thickened, a mustache and chin beard growing in, then it thickening and meeting on his cheeks and along his jaw. The bears he had wanted to grow as a teen suddenly appearing in mere moments. Even his brows looked thicker.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can trim, but no shaving.&quot; The voice said in his head. &quot;I like my pets to have fur for me to stroke.&quot; <br />
<br />
Van punched the wall, then shook out his now aching hand. Well, at least he had that beard he always wanted. He&#39;d try seeing how far he could trim down later. With a sigh he decided to go back to bed, maybe he could wake up and this would just be a dream.</p>
