<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Teddy Green woke up and stretched. For a moment he thought he was back at home cuddled with his wife. He could feel her soft and warm fur rubbing against him, about the same as he always did. It was a pleasant sensation that Teddy had always loved. For a moment he felt it a shame that he never had the chance to do anything more than touch Marci&#39;s fur. As he reached out to softly caress Marci&#39;s shoulders he soon found that things were different. He could see that his fingers were larger and tipped with retractable claws and covered in white fur. White fur... just like Marci&#39;s. Teddy checked and found that fur covered the rest of him with black stripes as well, and that ultimately made him smile.<br />
<br />
That reminded him on what had happened. He and Marci got a week vacation and came to Moon Lake, a secret were sanctuary. There, they met with Samantha and Frances Twist who gave Teddy the use of their home for his induction into were society, which was provided by a weretigress named Lila Carpenter. From there, Teddy became a weretiger and was able to be with the wife that he loved. It made him happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;We did it,&quot; Teddy whispered to her and brought his muzzle to nuzzle the back of his wife&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
Marci stirred and rolled over to look back to him. Her green feline eyes met his ice blue ones, befitting the coloration of werecats and white weretigers. Both were feline, but their were differences. Marci&#39;s ears were triangular and pointed while Teddy&#39;s were rounded. Marci&#39;s pupils in her fursona were a pair of vertical slits that were the typical &quot;cat eyes.&quot; Teddy had round pupils that were typical of the big cats. However, despite their physical differences, the love between them was obvious and strong and as their eyes met, they both knew it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Marci smiled and nuzzled her own muzzle up to Teddy&#39;s, &quot;We did. After all these years... we&#39;re finally together in EVERY way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Teddy smiled and nodded, &quot;Yes... though, I suppose we&#39;d best get changed and dressed. We don&#39;t want to impose on the Twists.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in the Decker home, Tad came downstairs for breakfast with his mind pondering some things from the night before. While Jay and Leon&#39;s first transformation had gone well and the two young werewolves did enjoy jogging through the woods with him and Amy, Tad privately wondered what brought Jay and Leon&#39;s came so early. He&#39;d initially thought that Jay and Leon wouldn&#39;t transform until Saturday, but instead had transformed on Thursday. He came into the kitchen to find his mom setting the coffee maker. He could even hear it gurgling as it started to make coffee.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning,&quot; Tad said to his mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning,&quot; Jen gave a nod as she looked up, &quot;Sleep well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Tad answered and sat down at the breakfast table. It was and gave him the opportunity to look out a back window to his backyard and the forest beyond, and Tad soon found himself looking out as if starring into nothing. It was something that Jen did catch onto.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; Jen asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; Tad admitted, &quot;Just... well... just thinking about what happened with Jay and Leon...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d thought that their transformation went well, all things considered,&quot; Jen commented, &quot;at least that is what you and Amy said last night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The transformation went well... but it still came earlier than expected,&quot; Tad answered, &quot;granted they transformed a year early from what would be normal for a were... but from all the signs seen... they transformed earlier than expected.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah...&quot; Jen said slowly, &quot;well... I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s something of an inexact science. The expectations are not exact and can be hard to pinpoint. You know that...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad slowly nodded, and Jen came up to him and patted his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;And in the end, by giving them the help needed to get through their first transformation... you did well,&quot; Jen told her son, &quot;Your father would be proud of you... Now, you&#39;d best get your breakfast and get ready for school.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Transforming back to his human form wasn&#39;t too hard and was soon followed by putting the clothing that had been purposely built to fit his new size as a were as compared to when he was human. As he and Marci made their way out of the guest room that the Twists had given them for the night, they noted that their bags remained in the living room and were placed neatly by a wall. They also found both Frances and Samantha Twist preparing breakfast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning you two, sleep well?&quot; Frances asked to them as they made their way into the Twist&#39;s kitchen/dinning area.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite well,&quot; Marci gave a smile, &quot;My husband and I are now truly together and that gave me some very pleasant dreams.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what do you two have planned?&quot; Samantha wondered while Frances offered both Teddy and Marci mugs of coffee.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... we have a weak off before we need to return home,&quot; Teddy commented, &quot;I think that after breakfast, we&#39;ll take our things to the motel so that we aren&#39;t burdening you any more than we already have. From there, I&#39;d think we&#39;d take to simply enjoying touring the town. Marci says her parents grew up here... and it might be a good place to retire to once remaining in DC would be too risky regarding how weres age.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you&#39;re not on any set schedule?&quot; Samantha asked, her voice a bit nervous and almost hesitant.<br />
<br />
Teddy caught on and raised an eyebrow to the town&#39;s Town Chancellor.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve had a pair of troubles that we MAY have trouble with,&quot; Samantha said slowly, &quot;one you don&#39;t know of and one that might be of more interest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Teddy looked to her with some concern. It raised some concern and even curiosity.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what is it?&quot; Teddy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A pair of threats that we may need your help with,&quot; Samantha spoke, &quot;If you&#39;re willing... and IF the situation develops that needs it.&quot; Teddy watched as she sighed before she continued. &quot;Both are also cases in which the FBI could take command of if need be. We&#39;d prefer it remain a local matter... but both could have the potential to need greater strength and greater understanding of Federal procedures than Moon Lake can handle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m more than willing to help with what I can,&quot; Teddy answered, &quot;though, if whatever this is is something that the FBI needs... I&#39;m afraid that I probably shouldn&#39;t be the one you make official contact with. For one, I&#39;m on vacation. I can help and &quot;call it in&quot; if I stumble onto it, but it really wouldn&#39;t do well for me to &quot;go to work&quot; on whatever issue. And even if I wasn&#39;t on vacation... unless some other killer from the Washington DC, Maryland, and northern Virginia area has come here to hide... I wouldn&#39;t be the one to call. It could work out, but you&#39;d probably only open yourself up for a lot of additional headaches in doing so. If you feel that you need the FBI&#39;s help officially, you&#39;d need to consult the Seattle Field Office for your concerns. It&#39;d make any cooperation between Moon Lake and the FBI easier.&quot;<br />
<br />
Teddy watched as Samantha gave a heavy sigh and looked down. That was clearly not the answer she wanted to hear.<br />
<br />
&quot;However, on an unofficial and private matter... I&#39;d be more than willing to help where I can,&quot; Teddy offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;That would help,&quot; Samantha said slowly, &quot;If that&#39;s the best you can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Teddy nodded, &quot;and what are these threats that you may need help with?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One is a man by the name of Dieter Wilhelm... though we&#39;re fairly certain we can handle him on our own,&quot; Samantha spoke, &quot;any help there would be a plus... and may work a &quot;chance occurrence&quot; than anything else... The other, however, WOULD be something more serious. And that would be a man named Dymixious Drake... a were-komodo-dragon and something of a vigilante.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vigilante?&quot; Teddy asked and glanced to Marci for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dymixious is the man who killed Lionel Ulysses and from what we&#39;ve been told has a fairly violent temperament,&quot; Samantha explained, &quot;and if it weren&#39;t for the threat of a major fight... we&#39;d arrest and turn him over the Seattle PD or the Seattle Field Office for the FBI on those charges. But we have events coming up that we really can&#39;t have a major fight going on at the moment. Not while there is the potential for were secrecy being exposed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Teddy gave a nervous sigh, &quot;I&#39;m afraid if you&#39;re certain he killed Ulysses, that would be something you really can&#39;t come to me directly as that wasn&#39;t my case. I can give you tips on how to improve take downs and monitoring tactics... but involving myself in an active investigation to which I wasn&#39;t assigned. If something comes up and he fights, I can help... but I can&#39;t build any case for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our hope is that Dymixious lays low until more of the heat dies down and that he may be convinced to turn himself in or would be at least aware that he could expose weres by fighting should law enforcement from outside Moon like find him,&quot; Samantha said slowly, &quot;but at present... we are spread thin and could well need the muscle if Dymixious either causes trouble or your field office finds him here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Teddy sighed heavily and then spoke, &quot;If it comes to that... I&#39;ll do what I can to help...&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
From there, Teddy and Marci did ultimately handle their mission for procuring their motel room and then began to tour the small town. Both marveled at how some of the older buildings looked so well maintained and how the town seemed to combine with nature. Its layout  resembling a wagon wheel did that. The marveled at all that until they bumped into Jen Decker, though that wasn&#39;t without its own pleasantries. Jen gave them her address written on a piece of paper and the time they would be expected for dinner and then continued on her way to run her errands while Teddy and Marci continued to tour the town.</p>
