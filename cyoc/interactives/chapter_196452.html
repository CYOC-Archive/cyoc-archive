<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As soon as he confirmed the changes, Jeff immediately felt something come over him. A weird energy began flowing through his body as it began to undergo a drastic change.<br />
<br />
It started with his hands and feet and worked inwards. And everywhere the energy passed through, became very feminine. From becomming smaller, to his skin smoothing out and softening up. Inch by inch Jeff slowly was becoming a woman. He was being made female thanks to the gender shuffle.<br />
<br />
Jeff just watched as he lost height, weight, and bodymass. He slimmed down, yet his legs seem to have lengthened. His hips and ass certainly were not smaller. But his waist was significantly thinner. The last stages of his change happened in his head and chest. So now with a decently huge boobs, a new pussy between her legs, and hair down to just above her ass, Jeff was unmistakably a woman now.<br />
<br />
She first flexed a little, taking note of how many more odd angles she could bend her body without straining herself. The natural flexibility of female Jeff was pretty impressive, or at least she felt it was. Being about 40 pounds lighter was really interesting too. Though her loss of over 7 inches in height would be surely missed. At least a tall pair of heels could compensate the difference. <br />
<br />
Jeff looked around the room and headed into her bedroom. What once was a normal bedroom had now been colored various shades of purple. Her drawers of clothes had been replaced by a full sized walk-in closet that had somehow been attached to her room. A new desk with mirrors and lights, and several bottles of stuff now sat against one of her walls too. From the look of it, it was for doing her makeup. And as if the few scattered bras were not obvious enough, a different smell now permeated through the room. Yep, this was definitely a girl&#39;s bedroom for sure. <br />
<br />
She walked over and picked up one of her discarded bras and looked at the tag. The big letters FF was all she needed to look for to get her answer. She didn&#39;t feel all that fat though, and a look in the mirror confirmed that she wasn&#39;t that big either. Actually, she had a rather slender figure. &quot;Ha, I guess all that excess body weight I had went straight to my tits.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff lifted up her shirt in front of her new full sized mirror and grinned at her toned abs. Everything felt amazing on her. A knock then came from her door. Pulling her shirt down, Jeff walked over and opened it to find an unknown boy standing there. &quot;Uhh, what do you need?&quot; Was all she could think to say to the kid. <br />
<br />
The young boy answered her question by walking passed her and sitting down on her bed. &quot;Mom said she will be home soon and asked if you still needed anything for tomorrow.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff now understood. This boy must be her former little sister. &quot;Um, I don&#39;t think I need anything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad also said that she&#39;s just worried since its gonna to be your first time attending as a display piece.&quot; Said her 11 year old brother as he slid off her bed and walked out of her room. <br />
<br />
Jeff shut her door behind him and went back to checking herself out in the mirror. Thinking about it, she realizes that she doesn&#39;t even know her brother&#39;s name. Actually, does she even know her own name? Jeff wasn&#39;t too sure anymore and began searching her room for something to identify herself with. A purse hanging from her makeup desk&#39;s chair contained her answer. According to the driver&#39;s license inside which had her picture on it, her name is now Beverly. <br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t actually mind it being her new name. It was a name she liked. Beverly looked in her phone for some of her friends, but only about half of them were able to be recognized now. Most of her friends were still boys, strangely enough. She wondered for a moment if perhaps a few of them were more than just friends at some point or another. Some of their faces were pretty good looking. And actually, one of them made her feel kind of warm inside too. But she didn&#39;t recognize him. However, she did recognize their text conversations.<br />
<br />
He use to be a she, and she had been a friend of Jeff&#39;s for a long time. Nothing romantically speaking ever came between them, as they just didn&#39;t see each other like that. But now things were seemingly different. While the subject of their text messages were identical to how they were before, the tone of the entire log was far more flirty. Especially from her side, as she found that she often would use pet names when referring to him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are we dating?&quot; Muttered Beverly as she read deeper into their logs. It definitely read like they were. So she checked her images and A LOT of them featured them both. Often times they were holding hands, or hugging. And then they were kissing. That pretty much confirmed it. They were a thing.<br />
<br />
Beverly then thought about her festival and how it basically let&#39;s any man fuck her if he adheres to her few requirements. She realized a flaw in her logic and quickly went to the chronivac and amended her settings. She made it so that durring the festival, becomming pregnant was simply impossible. And in addition to that. It was seen as a good thing if you were fucked a lot, or were able to fuck many of the women participating. And partners took great pride in the fact that so many people either fucked their lover or fucked so many other women. This was a special occasion, so it wasn&#39;t considered to be cheating or adultery. If anything, it was a more like a friendly competition. Where the man who screwed the most women (including repeats), and the woman who collected the largest volume of cum would be the winners.<br />
<br />
With that all settled, she pushed the changes through and closed the Chronivac down for now. She had to prepare herself for her own display afterall.</p>
