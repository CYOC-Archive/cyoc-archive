<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The girls decided to take up the offer and boinged after Riley and her husband. Along the way, Leonard was quite intrigued by the way Samantha was riding on Chiffon, as well as some the various unique oddities that all 4 girls seemed to exhibit. &quot;I admit Samantha, you are the first person I have ever heard of losing their feet for more phallic ends. And the same for Chiffon here. I wonder if there is some kind of marsupial development in play here. A bouncerbutt with a pouch. It is almost kangaroo like, am I right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess I can see the similarities&quot; admitted Samantha. She hadn&#39;t expected to meet an actual specialist on bouncerbutts today, but given how some of their uses of the curse had made their forms taken as being normal by the rest of humanity, getting a specialist&#39;s perspective on them was kind of interesting. Every one of his hypotheses were of course wrong, as Samantha knew the exact reason behind each and every one of their unique traits was simply their own perversions. But it was still fun to listen to.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, I may be overstepping my bounds here, and I would only be doing this for research purposes. But I would love to get a closer look at Chiffon&#39;s pouch sometime. I understand given what it doubles as, if you don&#39;t want me to as well, and I will fully respect that decision if that is the case.&quot; Asked Leonard. Riley gave her but a slightly awkward shake which nearly knocked Leonard off of her after her said that, as she had been listening the entire time. She knew he was a bouncerbutt fanatic, and tolerated his rather direct curiosity most of the time, but occasionally he would become too enthusiastic about certain topics and she would need to &quot;remind&quot; him that he still has a wife who can fully hear everything he is saying. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t mind&quot; answered Chiffon fairly quickly. Samantha didn&#39;t mind as well, but only if it was for a research purpose. She was curious about how the curse rewrites their reality. Maybe Chiffon really was now the first of a new subspecies of Bouncerbutts that inherited the marsupial traits for a pouch. <br />
<br />
&quot;You too as well Rachel. Your extensive mutations are vastly greater than anything I have ever seen before. Growing an entire third breast, and then all that with your arms as well. I would love to examine some cell samples if I could trouble you for a biopsy.&quot; Excitedly requested Leonard, at which point Riley stopped on a dime and bent her upper part down to almost flat on the ground, launching Leonard several feet infront of her. She then hopped and landed on top of him, pinning his lower torso and legs underneath her bountiful booty as she stared down at him in a pretty annoyed scowl. &quot;Shut. The hell. Up! You are to zip it until we get home. And you will be walking next to me for the rest of the way.&quot; Riley instructed in what could only be described as the harshest way a bouncerbutt could possibly manage to sound. It sounded more like a mocking or joking tone than a serious one, but that was if you went by normal human standards. To bouncerbutts, this was the epitome of seriously being pissed the hell off. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whaaa! Wait a minute! Honey I&#39;ll stop! I&#39;ll stop! I&#39;m sorry, I just got a bit too excited.&quot; Panicked Leonard as he began to lose feeling in his toes. &quot;I won&#39;t ask for a sample from them again. And.. and I will buy you an Ice cream as an apology.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Deal!&quot; Cheerfully exclaimed Riley with a huge smile on her face. She then did something none of the four girls expected. She shimmied backwards off of Leonard without hopping, then pulled his entire body with just a single arm back up onto her bouncy booty with the same overly happy expression that is commonly found on little kids. It was like the tone and seriousness she just had vanished completely. Only Jen and Leonard knew why though. Riley was weak to ice cream. It was her absolute favorite food. She would easily forgive just about any minor annoyance as long as she got an ice cream out of it. She was just like a child in this one area. And turning into a bouncerbutt had only enhanced that personality trait. This was why Leonard only ever offered his wife ice cream whenever either it was a special occasion or an apology. Otherwise she would only want to consume ice cream for every meal. As for her rapid mood shifts, they had her checked by a psychiatrist and they found that she is perfectly healthy and mentally stable. She apparently just really loves ice cream that much.<br />
<br />
After stopping to get the ice cream, and a few more minutes of bouncing along the sidewalk, they finally reached a massive gated community. It looked massive, but really it was just a lot more spacious so as to give the proper amount of space for bouncerbutts to feel comfortable in. All of the homes were either wider and just a single story tall, or multiple stories, with each floor being one single appartment unit. The apartments were significantly cheaper than the houses though, as there was a near constant banging sound from every other tenant bouncing around all day. It didn&#39;t bother other bouncerbutts in the slightest, but many riders would not be able to stay there after a while. This is why the apartments were primarily meant for riderless bouncerbutts, and the homes were meant for those who have already found their life long rider. <br />
<br />
After being let inside through the security checkpoint, Riley and Leonard quickly lead the rest to their home which was closer to the center of the gated community in one of the more expensive newer homes. And by pure coincidence, their home was just a few houses down from the very doublewide house that Samantha was looking into buying for herself, Chiffon, Jen, and Rachel to live in. It was the perks of being the daughter of a family who were absolutely loaded with cash. <br />
<br />
Samantha was always the &quot;rich girl&quot; in their friend group, but not the kind that are a total bitch to anyone who can&#39;t match their spending money. Ok, maybe she could be like that every now an again, but usually she behaved like any other &quot;normal&quot; high school girl. Enough at least to be on good terms with her former squad mates on the cheerleading team, that she now also could no longer be part of with her cock feet. But she didn&#39;t even care about that point anymore. She had an all powerful curse at her and the rest of her and Rachel&#39;s small, overlapping harem of girl&#39;s disposal. Who could have known that their squad had 4, equally perverted lesbians who all were into each other secretly? And now that the cat was out of the bag, a d the four of them were going to be living together, spending the extra money for a doublewide home and not 2 seperate houses was an easy decision to make. <br />
<br />
What made this entire community unique was that there were no sidewalks to be seen. The road was the sidewalk since not a single bouncerbutt would be able to drive a car anyways. Because of this, none of the houses had a garage either. Riley stopped in front of a very nice looking house and turned to face the group. &quot;Well girls, this is our home. Want to see inside?&quot;</p>
