<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sunlight streamed through the window, enveloping Jeff&#39;s unconscious form in a warm glow. He was still sat at his desk, his head in his arms after having passed out as the changes finished. Without raising his head, he slowly opened one eye and looked around. The Chronivac was still open on his computer screen, with a message stating the changes had finished. He opened his other eye and directed his gaze around his room. Nothing seemed different. He basked in the warmth of the sun&#39;s rays for a few minutes, trying to see if he felt any different. After a few minutes of everything seeming normal, he heaved a sigh and sat up to look down at his body.<br />
<br />
Raising his head, Jeff noticed something was off. He had been laying his head in his arms, his eyes buried in his keyboard. So how was he seeing anything? With a start, Jeff felt his eyes snap open and realized his vision was suddenly much sharper, as if the entire world was upgrade from 1080p HD to Ultra 4K HD in an instant. Jeff sprang to his feet and ran to his mirror, realizing as he did so that his field of vision had greatly expanded and he was seeing more of his room than he should have been able to.<br />
<br />
Jeff gasped when he saw his reflection. For all intents and purposes, he looked the same as he had before using the Chronivac, albeit with some minor improvements. His muscles looked much more defined, his slight gut replaced with a six-pack and the baby fat around his jaw seeming to have melted away. What really caught his attention, however, were the two eyestalks sticking out of his forehead. He had his regular eyes in their usual space, but growing above them, maybe half an inch above his eyebrows, were two fleshy stalks that ended in round balls of flesh that held his eyes. All four of his eyes were currently staring in the same direction, the stalks pushing out slightly before bending up and out, similar to the &quot;ƒ&quot; symbol used in music.<br />
<br />
Tentatively poking at his eyestalks, Jeff was found they felt surprisingly strong, like a finger, though they were much more maneuverable. He gingerly brought a finger up to his new eyes, marveling at how clear it still looked as his other three eyes instinctively shifted his vision to focus on the finger. Jeff cupped one of his new eyes with his hand and giggled at the new sensation. He moved the hand to gently grip the tip of his eyestalk and was amazed at how his vision seemed to almost return to normal with the fourth eye blocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, I can get used to this,&quot; Jeff breathed as he took his hand away and looked at his new eyestalks. He wondered how much control he actually had over them. He experimented with moving his eyes around, just to see his surroundings more, and realized as the field of vision from his eyestalks moved away from the field of vision from his regular eyes, the world seemed to downgrade again, back to 1080p, though he now had a panoramic view of his room.<br />
<br />
It was disorienting, at first, shifting his perspectives so drastically and processing the new visual inputs, but it became easier the less he thought about it. Jeff realized this must have been part of the awareness options he&#39;d selected. Since he was aware of the changes he&#39;d made to the world, his mind wasn&#39;t used to everything, but the Chronivac had altered the history of the planet, so though everything was new for him, his body had always been this way and was used to it, even if his mind wasn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, too complicated, best not to think too hard about it,&quot; Jeff said to himself. He continued to experiment with his eyestalks for a few minutes before it became mundane. Disappointment started to creep in as he realized that he had wanted something... more. He wasn&#39;t sure what he&#39;d wanted to happen to him, but a pair of eyestalks was not it. Or not all of it. It was wonderful, freaky, and a bit arousing at how foreign it was to him, but it wasn&#39;t enough.<br />
<br />
Jeff sighed and threw himself onto his bed, looking up at his ceiling while his eyestalks looked to either side of his bed. He sat up immediately when he realized the photo of his family on his bedside table had changed. Jeff looked pretty much the same, except with his new eyestalks in the photo, but the rest of his family looked far more interesting. His mother and sister were gone, replaced with two handsome men that looked similar to the women he remembered. He was reminded of those gender-swapping filters on social media sites. While he could recognize his mother and sister, they definitely weren&#39;t how he remembered them. His father and brother were still recognizable as themselves, though they also seemed to have more tone and muscle definition. What really caught Jeff&#39;s attention though were the changes that the rest of his family had undergone. While Jeff was nearly the same as he had been before using the Chronivac, his family&#39;s changes were far more appealing to him.<br />
<br />
All four of Jeff&#39;s eyes lit up as he beheld his new family, his mind immediately going to the ability he&#39;d given himself to physically dominate and enthrall anyone within 5000 miles. A wicked grin spread across his face as he beheld the photo, trying to decide who he wanted to try first. With the changes his family had undergone, he knew he&#39;d be in for some fun swapping minds with them. The only question was what he wanted to experience more, and how he&#39;d do it. Beholding his augmented family, Jeff&#39;s eyes fell on...</p>
