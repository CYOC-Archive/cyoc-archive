<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Are you alright Dave?&quot; Chris asked him in a soft soprano, her voice oozing sex.<br />
<br />
Just as he was the perfect definition of manhood, Chris had been replaced with a feminine version of himself that fit all the criteria for all for Dave&#39;s wet dream, but he couldn&#39;t help but feel the tent pitched in his pants was caused by seeing the big man go from older, more thin, to bulky and fit, to dainty and supple. Dave&#39;s dick twitched as he mentally saw Chris&#39; feminine form bulk up to his previously larger, enhanced form, before switching back towards his currently... *ahem* sumptuous appearance, both looks having a far more generous bust size then he had believed possible.<br />
<br />
Chris expectantly looked down at Dave, draping his, now her, body over the desk before sitting down on a chair she pulled closer.<br />
<br />
Dave felt his heart pulse as he awkwardly swallowed, fingers clutching the pen with all his might as he fought himself on what was going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-Hold that t-thought, Mis... I mean, Chris...&quot; He groaned, chuckling to ease the desperation in his voice as he stretched to write on the legal pad aside from him. Chris was none the wiser and nonchalantly smiled, watching her favorite employee work.<br />
<br />
Fumbling his hands, Dave watched Chris&#39; careful gaze before darting his eyes towards the written dress code and hastily scratching the surface with his pen. Like a scientist that had begun their hypothesis, he could feel the lust in wanting to see what results could come from altering with this magical tool... If he could still hardly believe the luck he was having.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-So, uh, Chris, you work-work out,&quot; He paused, swallowing.<br />
&quot;...A lot?&quot; He finished.<br />
<br />
Chris smiled, breathing in. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well of course,&quot; She had just gotten in, before her body jolted in front of Dave. <br />
<br />
Dave&#39;s eyes nearly bugged out of his head as the woman had surged up, her breasts bouncing sensually upwards, before they quickly receded and flattened. The mass distributed into her height as she continued to rise, before her chest burgeoned forwards, creating a deep ridge between them which at one point was just a hair away from drooping into her navel. <br />
<br />
&quot;I do <I><b>a lot of lifts</I></b>.&quot; Chris remarked, voice becoming husky as her neck thickened to contain the swelling of his newly reverted Adam&#39;s apple. <br />
<br />
Her body inflated, musculature expanding as her biceps swelled, she flexed, what was once thinner arms had gracefully developed into marbled baseballs... Before they became larger, almost melon sized. The silken fabric had tightened, before it tore from the mass and size that were becoming reality once again, the shirt readjusting and tattering into thin air as the material became shinier. Chris lost her sleeves as she flexed out of them, oblivious to the changes happening to her as sinew engulfed her forearms as they bulged, matching the larger biceps that Dave found himself eyeing lustfully. Not to be forgotten, the shapely shoulders rippled, before thickening before his eyes, mass adding to each of the three muscles as deltoids broadened into boulders. <br />
<br />
&quot;30 reps... Each set...&quot; She mumbled, voice an octave even deeper than previously as she continued to rise in height to a familiar 6 feet...<br />
<br />
Then even higher as she towered over Dave as before, smiling rather demure despite the overt transformation taking place. Her breasts had decreased, bouncing as they shaped into mountainous slabs, before they too stuck out in a different way, shelving her now defining abdominals. Chris breathed, just as her six pack had readjusted into competition shape, the muscles cobblestone and etching into her core as the serratus appearing. <br />
<br />
The fabric of the silken shirt dulled in color, becoming a shiny silver that complemented the light, shrinking further as her lats flared. Chris unconsciously flexed her lats, as they widened and took most of the room, tearing through what could have been the remainder of her dress shirt. Taking it in stride, the fabric evaporated into air as they contracted against her thickening body, before taking the form of a simple silver tie tied around her neck... As Dave drank in all of Chris&#39; physique.<br />
<br />
As her obliques had cultivated, Chris couldn&#39;t help but continue to smirk down at Dave,<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what you see, Dave?&quot; She laughed, before her soft chin rippled and was quickly changed, tugging downward and becoming lantern shape. <br />
<br />
Her petite and cute pout had diminished lightly as her puffy lips became tamer, aligning with the chiseled chin that upheld her masculinizing face. Chris&#39;s mascara and makeup evaporated, the long red locks tapering off and receding into her skull as the color was replaced by blonde strands. Her eyebrows regained their thicker shape as her skin roughened against years of training, and her cheeks lost their supple fat while the excess mass flowed down into her traps.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is all natural,&quot; She said, quickly putting her arms into a double biceps as Dave saw her hair being brushed by an invisible hand, the sides of her head shaving down. The top was kept slightly short, and small amounts of hair sprouted on her chin alongside her new sideburns before a neat chin strap beard settled in. Yet as Dave looked down and saw himself gasping at the miniskirt that was straining to hold now much bulkier thighs, he gulped.<br />
<br />
What was a silken thong had lost its frills as well, but the smooth mass that kept its shape had begun to bulge, the feminine slit that had made Chris herself was reverting to a more appreciated tool, reinforcing his masculinity as the tool grew before Dave&#39;s very eyes. Dave felt his tented erection strain against his underwear as Chris continued to pose in front of him, the crotch inflating as his balls had settled into the thong&#39;s containment, before it too had swelled to sizable proportions.<br />
<br />
Chris noticed Dave&#39;s labored breathing, and simply dug into the fading miniskirt and tugged at the thong&#39;s straps before the skirt disappeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like that? Give it a feel, Dave.&quot; He said, as the black thong struggled to contain his treasure as Dave could not help but fumble his hand out to grasp the meaty member. <br />
<br />
Dave gulped as he palmed Chris&#39; cock, sleeved only by a thin layer of fabric as he saw the stockings shrink into her... His, shoes that had easily ripped by the size of his feet enlarging. The stockings had faded, though the puddle of fabric which had reached his legs had split into two, one morphed thicker, black, and buckled into a well worn sock garters and the other had simply found itself renewed as a pair of black socks.<br />
<br />
His ruined black high heels flattened, covering all of his feet as they renewed themselves into pure Italian leather, the sheer shine of the craftsmanship had almost led Dave to believe all of the man was covered in light, just as Dave&#39;s pale skin tone had tanned.<br />
<br />
Chris chuckled, before making a side chest pose, the brownish tan spreading quickly over his body as the office light reflected off his sweaty body.<br />
<br />
&quot;I expect nothing but the best from my workers,&quot; Chris touted, winking. &quot;And I am no exception, but the <I>example</I> I set for them. You understand this, don&#39;t you? As a Mr. Olympia winner 4 times in a row, it&#39;s my <I><b>job</I></b> to be the pinnacle of health and fitness.&quot; <br />
<br />
As Dave felt compelled to nod, Chris&#39;s physique continued to thicken as he grew larger than his previous form was, it was almost insane. He had just meant to scratch off the word to revert the female form into the male form, but...<br />
<br />
Chris relaxed before shifting focus on his leg and wiggled his thighs as the sinew developed and rippled alongside Chris&#39; motions. Quadriceps became tree trunks as Chris&#39; calves bulked up to maintain and uphold his larger body, before turning in a smooth transition to show off his backside.<br />
<br />
Dave could feel his heart race just as Chris pulled his arms in, before throwing up his arms in the air and flaring his lats once more, his glutes in front of his employee before it too had shifted from large and fat... To a much more thicker and rounder shape. <br />
<br />
&quot;Y-You, uh,&quot; Dave attempted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; Chris asked, back still turned as Dave&#39;s cock was as hard as diamonds the more he posed. A circular pin with a number attached was now found clipped onto Chris&#39; thong, the number 1. It was almost painfully funny, as Dave clutched his desk for dear life.<br />
<br />
&quot;You take, dress code, very seriously, don&#39;t you, Mr...&quot; Dave continued.<br />
<br />
Chris swung around quickly, a folder of files were in his hands before he placed them on the desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chris, Dave, call me Chris.&quot; He said, seriously, as the papers were put into view: The Biggalow account.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve seen the way you worked, and I&#39;m impressed. However, the Biggalow account will need some looking at,&quot; Chris said, completely oblivious to his new outfit and his appearance. To Dave, he was practically a male pornstar or a professional bodybuilder in some commercial, yet he was as handsome as Adonis.<br />
<br />
&quot;The gym,&quot; Chris continued, Dave&#39;s lust dropped like his heart as he realized those two words that left his new boss&#39; mouth. The Biggalow account was meant for a real estate job that had sought some accountants and other staff to figure their expenses and other issues the office was meant to handle. There was no gym to speak of unless...<br />
<br />
&quot;Is in partnership with us after our last successful project with them. However, I think we can go <I>bigger</I>, Dave. <I><B>Stronger.</I></b>.&quot; He leaned over, coming face to face with Dave, his grin cocky and wolfish. If he hadn&#39;t known any better, and it was arguable he did not, Dave could almost feel Chris drinking <I>him</I> in as well.<br />
<br />
Chris immediately took the legal pad aside from Dave&#39;s trembling hands and began writing with a pen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Dave, I like you, but I believe some changes will be necessary,&quot; Chris began, easily writing word after word with a speed Dave had never seen before. Chris was a veritable beast, he had become young, then muscular, then female, to inherently Dave&#39;s wet dream in the span of only some minutes... Was Dave even straight? He thought he was, after all, Janet&#39;s new and improved look had gotten him hot and bothered, but Chris now... All of this was just from one little pen, who could have thought, one teeny tiny, almost normal looking pen that-<br />
<br />
Wait, where <I>was</I> his pen?<br />
<br />
Dave looked down as he realized the pen was no longer in his hands after he had lovingly adored his boss&#39; body, it was now in the hands of the bigger man himself, who was presently creating new rules for the workplace to enjoy.<br />
<br />
&quot;The first thing I&#39;d like to implement is...&quot;</p>
<hr/><h3>
What happens now that Chris is holding the magic pen?</h3>
