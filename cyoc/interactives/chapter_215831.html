<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking around the bathroom, Jen felt that it was just about complete. All that was left unmodified was the sink area. &quot;I guess the apple shouldn&#39;t fall far from the tree, right?&quot; Decided Jen. And she knew a perfect way for how Brenda will replace the sink.<br />
<br />
After waiting for night when Brenda would be asleep, Jen wheeled herself out of her closet and went right to work. After turning Brenda into a collection of body parts, she moved them all into the bathroom. <br />
<br />
Her Father was asleep, but surprisingly, Susan was awake and oddly still whispered a greeting to her mom, as she still found her to be a human, despite her being just a pile of detached body parts. Jen just ignored the talking toilet and continued making her preparations by ripping the entire sink bowl off the wall and cabinet. She then shoved it into Brenda&#39;s pussy which was still connected to her now limbless torso. <br />
<br />
Jen lifted the upside-down torso and slid it over the drain pipe, sliding it into the neck hole until it connected back up to the sink, with the faucets now poking up and out from Brenda&#39;s asshole. Jen removed Brenda&#39;s urethra from her pussy bowl and stuck it over the faucet&#39;s opening too. <br />
<br />
Jen pulled Brenda&#39;s tits off and then closed the cabinet doors after that. Jen picked up Brenda&#39;s head and put it onto the second row corner shelf beside the mirror, so that she would be at around human head height. <br />
<br />
Jen picked out her eyes and pushed them over 2 small light bulbs, before screwing them back into their sockets. Jen then pulled the power cord out from the small lamp with a built in radio on the third row shelf and hooked it up to Brenda&#39;s neck beneath her head, then fed it down through the hole in the shelf in order to plug it in to the outlet. <br />
<br />
Jen removed the speaker and shoved it into the very back of Brenda&#39;s mouth. She took the antena and pushed it into the back of Brenda&#39;s head, and replaced Brenda&#39;s earrings with the radio&#39;s two scroll wheels so that the radio station could still be changed and tuned using her right earring wheel, and the volume could be adjusted with her left. Jen finished the head off by pulling off Brenda&#39;s nose and putting the power button in its place, before reattaching her nose overtop of it. Now simply by poking Brenda&#39;s nose, she would turn on and off.<br />
<br />
Looking at the remaining parts, 2 legs and 2 arms, plus the hands and feet attached to them, and a pair of rather large breasts, Jen thought of an idea. It was easy to turn Brenda&#39;s legs into a folded towel holding shelf as just by smooshing the feet down with her wheels, Jen was able to create a flat enough surface. Then after shoving the thighs into the wall, the towel shelf was complete. <br />
<br />
For the arms, Jen remembered how Brenda was once a beautician, and felt it would be great if those talents didn&#39;t go to waste. So Jen attached the arms to the back splash of the countertop and hoped that just by imagining what their use would be, that they would turn out like such. And she was right. The two arms now rested motionless on the counter behind the faucet, patiently awaiting for a chance to apply their user&#39;s make-up, and help them with other tasks that fell within their reach. <br />
<br />
And last but not least, Jen grabbed the soap dispenser and pushed Brenda&#39;s left tit which she then attached to the back splash,  between the arms. She did the same thing with the other breast, only using toothpaste instead of soap this time. <br />
<br />
Jen tested her handywork by poking Brenda&#39;s nose twice so that she turned on the lamp, but not the radio. Brenda&#39;s eyelids rolled back and 2 bright sources of light filled the room, with the brightest spot being whatever Brenda was currently looking at. She looked down at Jen and then over at Susan. &quot;Good evening you two. Doing some moonlight cleaning Jen? I really hope the new maid arrives tomorrow so that you can take a break from doing all the house cleaning&quot; spoke Brenda in a somewhat mechanical version of her voice, as she was using her internal speaker to do so. Brenda also dimmed her light intensity, as her brightest setting wasn&#39;t needed at the moment.<br />
<br />
She then turned her attention towards her toilet daughter and with one of her hands, flushed Susan. Susan moaned loudly as she both emptied and refilled her bowl with fresh cum. &quot;There you go sweetie. Now your all freshened up. Can&#39;t have you drying out or start to smell on us, right?&quot; <br />
<br />
Susan stopped moaning once her orgasmic flushing cycle was completed, and thanked her Mom for doing it. &quot;I was beginning to dry out actually. Someone had shut the door earlier, so Mistress wasn&#39;t able to have her evening drink today. I feel kinda sorry for the bitch. But hopefully the new maid comming in the morning will take proper care of her, and us too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. But hey, I&#39;m not complaining if she does pee on the floor. It just means that I get to suck it all up inside of me&quot; added on Jen with a happy tone to her voice as she recalled in her head the last time she was able to suck up those delightful fluids.<br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt I will ever be able to fully understand how the two of you enjoy having human waste inside of you so much. It just doesn&#39;t sound pleasant at all to me. I can sorta understand pee, kind of, but not the other stuff&quot; spoke Brenda, looking directly over at her blushing daughter whose scat fettish was by no means a secret.<br />
<br />
Even Jen was just a little grossed out by the thought of having it inside of her, but she found spraying it with her hose to be really enjoyable. And while it was a gross thing for her, it was gross, but in a perverted guilty pleasure kind of way. She wouldn&#39;t ask for it, or even hope for it to happen to her, but when on the rare occasion it did, she couldn&#39;t deny that she found it both super erotic and rather stimulating for some reason. <br />
<br />
Moving away from that topic, Brenda asked Jen to hand her a new bottle of hand soap and a fresh tube of toothpaste, as she was feeling rather empty with both of them. Jen did as requested and watched Brenda unscrew her own nipples. She then poured in the new supply into their respective tit, before closing them back up again. Then as if to test her work, Brenda grabbed her soap boob and milked herself with one hand until a small bit of soap squirted out from her nipple and into her free hand. <br />
<br />
She began to moan as she contracted the muscles inside her torso in order to let water come up and out through her faucet. Jen watched in amazement as Brenda washed her hands inside of her own pussy, essentially pissing on her own hands in the process. But at least it was just normal water that came out. Jen did also notice how the bowl was filling up faster than it should be, and realized that like her daughter, Brenda also secretes her cum directly from the sides of her bowl. <br />
<br />
It was was only when water began overflowing and spilling onto the floor of the bathroom did Brenda remember to actually open up her drain to empty out her pussy full of watered down cum and soap. Jen on the other hand, was delighted by the accident and began cleaning it up right away. <br />
<br />
Only Susan was feeling left out of the fun, as the shower was somehow still fast asleep. So she tried flushing herself, to no avail, as her arms were not long enough to reach up that high, as all of their work happened below Susan&#39;s face. But Brenda noticed Susan&#39;s wanting look and flushed her, sending the toilet into another fit of moaning and cuming. <br />
<br />
Jen said goodnight and wheeled herself back to her closet. She did make sure that Brenda could actually turn her head on and off all on her own before she left though. Tomorrow would bring a new maid to the house, and Jen couldn&#39;t wait to find out who they were.</p>
