<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">What the hell, thought Les. I&#39;m only going to get one shot at this, might as well go all the way. She clicked on the Mythological option, ignoring the large red warning that flashed before her, and began to scroll through the choices. She had something in mind, and she was searching for it eagerly. The largest, most powerful creature ever imagined. It had unyielding strength wrapped in a tight lean body. She looked everywhere, but couldn&#39;t find an option for it - dragon.  She was about to give up, when she saw an option that seemed similar- Hydra.  <br />
<br />
She wasn&#39;t exactly sure what a Hydra was, but she vaguely remembered that it was big, scaly, and very strong, just like dragon.  She knew there was some difference, but she couldn&#39;t quite recall what it was.<br />
<br />
Maybe it&#39;s just the name the Greeks or Romans used for dragon, she thought.  It seems close enough for my needs.<br />
<br />
She clicked on the choice, and was immediately assaulted by another large warning. The computer screen flashed red, but she quickly clicked out of the warning and continued to examine her options, not bothering to read its message. She was now given a list of settings, already set to the default options.<br />
<br />
 Subject: Jeff<br />
 Feature: Body (Human) --&gt; Body (Hydra)<br />
 Gender: Male<br />
 Dimensions: <br />
 Length: Error! Cannot compute (see Error Code 4206 in Manual for help)<br />
 Weight: Error! Cannot compute (see Error Code 4206 in Manual for help)<br />
 Body fat: Error! Cannot compute (see Error Code 4206 in Manual for help)<br />
 Morphing duration: 1 hour<br />
 Pleasurable: N<br />
 Alter Reality: N<br />
 Aware: Y<br />
<br />
<br />
 Leslie frowned. This was going to be a lot more complicated than she had hoped. She thought that she would just have to click a few buttons, and be done with it. Apparently, it was going to require some work. <br />
<br />
 First of all, she saw that the subject was wrong. She wanted to change herself, not Jeff. She clicked on his name, and was surprised to see a full 3D model of his nude body, slowly turning on the screen. She chuckled a little at the size of his penis. <br />
<br />
 I think you might have gone a little too far, she thought with a smile. She briefly toyed with the idea of messing with Jeff, making his penis disappear entirely, or even turning him into a girl. But she knew her time was short, and that she still had a lot of work to do.<br />
<br />
 She saw a small icon in the lower left corner labeled &quot;Scan new subject?&quot; She clicked the link, and after a brief pause, Jeff&#39;s image was now replaced with her own nude anthro-horse body. Her name now replaced Jeff&#39;s over the picture. <br />
<br />
 Now that&#39;s more like it, she thought with a smile, examining the picture closely. Damn, I do look good. But I think I can be better. I wonder how it knows my name?<br />
<br />
 She looked at the next option. She considered leaving the male option selected. It might be fun to be the dominant gender for a change. But she absolutely loved the female form, and she wanted to be able to enjoy it. What better way than to remain one yourself. So, she switched the option to female.<br />
<br />
 The errors were confusing. She tried clicking on them, but nothing happened. She looked around for some kind of manual, but she couldn&#39;t see one anywhere near the computer. She decided to skip it for now, and work on the next option.<br />
<br />
 She tried to alter the morph duration to less than 1 hour. She was eager to enjoy her new body, and didn&#39;t want to wait that long. But although she could increase the time, she could not decrease it to less than 1 hour. She guessed that was the minimum time the device needed to complete her complex transformation.<br />
<br />
 The pleasurable option was a difficult choice. She was intrigued by the though of being aroused like Cindy was during her transformation. But when she tried to change it, the computer flashed yet another warning, indicating that a one-hour long orgasm may cause some long term mental damage. She decided that the program was probably right. She didn&#39;t like the idea of being lost in an orgasm for 1 hour, helpless and in a daze. She left that as it was and continued on.<br />
<br />
 Suddenly, she heard a door open downstairs, followed by some excited shouting. She looked at the clock, and realized she had been working much longer than she thought. She was having so much fun, she had lost track of time.<br />
<br />
 Damn it! Jeff and Liz must be through with work, she thought. And they probably noticed that I destroyed their door. I don&#39;t have much more time. <br />
<br />
 As if in response to her thoughts, she heard heavy hooves thundering on the stairway, coming quickly up the stairs. Without a second thought, she selected the start button, hoping that the program would begin despite the errors. Another red warning flashed. She tried to click past it, but it remained, demanding a percentage be input before it could proceed.<br />
<br />
 Percentage? Percentage of what? she thought. She had clicked through the warning so quickly, she hadn&#39;t bothered to read what it was talking about. The only percentage she could think of was muscle. Is that what it wanted? To know how lean she wanted to be? What percentage of her body would be muscle?<br />
<br />
 She quickly typed a number and hit enter, just as the door opened and Elizabeth stomped angrily into the room. Leslie didn&#39;t know it, but the percentage actually referred to how far her transformation would go - what percentage of her body would be like a Hydra. That was the reason for the errors. The program could not calculate any measurements until she had specified how far she was willing to go. But now that all the input had been entered, the program whirred to life, starting to complete the request it was given.</p>
