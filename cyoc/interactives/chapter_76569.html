<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex was awoken in the dead of night by his phone ringing loudly on his bedside table. He grunted and lifted <br />
his head slowly off the pillow, barely able to open his eyes. His big hand scrabbled around for his phone, and <br />
finally closed around it. He answered it, and mumbled a &quot;Hello?&quot;<br />
<br />
There were a few seconds of light breathing on the other end, and a sniff too, before the caller asked &quot;Alex?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes....who's this?&quot;<br />
<br />
More sniffs, and a shaky voice replied, &quot;It's Lana. I'm sorry, I didn't know who else to call...fuck, this is <br />
messed up...look, I know we haven't spoken in a few months, but could we meet? Could you come over?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex was a little apprehensive. Lana had been his fuck-buddy back when he's been straight after all. On <br />
balance, it didn't sound like she was wanting a hook-up (he thought with relief) so he replied, &quot;Sure Lana, <br />
when do you want to meet up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel awful for saying this, but could you come over now? I'm sorry but I really need some help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure Lana, I'll be right over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just one thing - promise me you won't be surprised? I can't really say any more now, but please just promise <br />
me that you won't be upset when you see me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only if you promise the same thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a pause, before Lana replied, &quot;OK then...so you'll come over now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm on my way.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that Alex put the phone down, threw on some jeans and a tight vest over his big thick torso and showing <br />
off his big arms, before grabbing his keys and walking out the door to drive to Lana's. What could she be so <br />
worried about?<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, he was outside Lana's building and called her to say he'd arrived. She buzzed him in, and <br />
he walked slowly up to her door before knocking quietly. And slowly the door opened.<br />
<br />
Standing there was someone who looked quite a lot like Lana - same kind of face, same long, red hair. But she <br />
looked a bit bigger than normal, like she'd been hitting the gym pretty hard and...Alex squinted in the low <br />
light...and said, &quot;Fuck Lana, is that stubble?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Her eyes welled up, and she sobbed out, &quot;I don't know what the fuck is happening to me. Ever since we fucked <br />
before, I've been changing. I tried to ignore it but it's become too obvious now. So yeah, I've got fucking <br />
stubble, my tits are fucking disappearing, even my fucking vag has turned into a dick!&quot;<br />
<br />
She dropped her pants at this, and low and behold there was a dick between her legs. Not huge, granted, but <br />
definitely there, with its own small balls. She was right about the tits as well, they were pretty much gone <br />
now. There were still two small bumps, but Alex guessed they'd be changed into pecs before long. She hitched <br />
her pants back up slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway,&quot; Lana said, wiping the tears from her eyes, &quot;What the fuck's happened to you?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex explained it all, about David's changes, then his, how he'd fucked Lana and she'd been his last straight <br />
fuck, and how he'd become completely gay, and a bit of a bear. It had taken about 30 minutes to go through <br />
everything, and when he'd done, Lana was completely glazed over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lana....say something, anything. Please.&quot;<br />
<br />
After a pause, Lana said, &quot;Well, the timing was so suspicious I could tell anyway that you'd done this to me. <br />
Somehow. I'm just so confused...I'm pretty much a man now, and I'm just so confused about the whole shitty <br />
mess...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you'll need a new name for starters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True...any bright ideas?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How about Lee? Or Lance? Or Leo?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I quite like Lance. I'll have a lance between my legs anyway right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to see you've still got your sense of humor. So yeah that's settled then, but remember you're going to <br />
change more anyway. If you're feeling energetic and you wanna hit the gym, me and my boys go pretty much every <br />
day so call and we can show you our place. But I think, once the testosterone really kicks in, you're going to <br />
be one hot muscle stud Lance,&quot; Alex smiled at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...fuck, Alex could you get me some water please? I feel so hot...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Alex went for a glass for her, and when he came back he saw she was breathing really heavily, sweating <br />
profusely.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck is going on?&quot; Lance said through heavy breaths.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brace yourself, but this is going to be one big change you get. Don't fight it, just go with it, and let's <br />
see what happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
Almost as soon as Alex finished talking, he noticed that Lance's skin was paler. Then, with one deep breath <br />
and a grunt, Lance's whole body bulged outwards as maybe 30lbs of solid muscle packed onto his tight frame. <br />
The stubble grew out to become a short but full ginger beard, and Alex noticed with great interest the small <br />
bulge in Lance's pants growing and growing.<br />
<br />
As soon as it had started it was over, and all Lance could say was, &quot;Fuck.&quot; As soon as he'd said it he <br />
clutched at his throat, &quot;Fuck my voice is really deep now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex smiled, &quot;No point in pretending you're a girl any more Lance - you're one of the boys now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance walked over to the mirror and flexed a bit, showing off his new ripped muscles. He grinned and said, <br />
&quot;Awww fuck yeah!&quot;<br />
<br />
His dick also got hard and he said, &quot;I'd always wondered what a hard-on felt like...&quot; His hands slowly moved <br />
down and started stroking it, but Alex came over, pulled Lance's pants down, and kneeled in front of him. Fuck <br />
his dick must have been an impressive nine inches now. Alex slowly started kissing the big dick in front of <br />
his face, slowly taking more and more of it into his mouth, wrapping his tongue around it and cupping the <br />
man's surprisingly-large balls.<br />
<br />
Within minutes of this, Alex had brought Lance to the edge of climax, and the New Man unleashed hot white <br />
spunk deep into Alex's mouth, which he drank down greedily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alex...that was the best thing I've ever felt. Thank you,&quot; Lance said as he looked into his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well big man, I wouldn't have thought your changes are over yet. Any more problems, give me a call. But from <br />
now, you're a man. Embrace it, and you'll do fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex left Lance marvelling over his bigger muscles and his ripped abs, he even caught Lance taking a few <br />
pictures before he left. 'I wonder what he'll do with them...'he thought.</p>
