<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jack and Teddy were the last ones to enter the class room, which made it easier for them to pick out a seat near the back away from everyone else. They dropped their bag, pulled out their books, and sat down. Jack&#39;s half of their body was leaning back in the seat with his leg stretched out, but Teddy was trying to sit up with his foot under their chair. It was really uncomfortable for both of them, and they tried to force the other one to move, hoping they weren&#39;t drawing attention. Finally Teddy gave in, and sat back with Jack.<br />
<br />
Mr. Jones, the math teacher, walked in and clapped his hands together, &quot;Good news everyone! I have a surprise test for you all today!&quot; The whole class groaned, except for Teddy, who smiled, and cheered to himself.<br />
<br />
JAck however was close enough to hear, and looked at him, &quot;I forgot how much of you like this stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe if you studied a little more, you&#39;d like it to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like you? Spending and hour a night?&quot; JAck rolled his eyes and put his arm across their chest. Jack suddenly turned to Teddy with a smile. &quot;Wait, this means I can just copy you.&quot;  Teddy looked back, unamused at the idea.<br />
<br />
Mr. Jones was handing out the test as he walked up and down the rows. &quot;Remember, no speaking, cell phones, ipods, or anything like that.&quot; He sat down at his desk, and looked over to where Jack and Teddy were sitting. His eyes seemed to narrow in on Jack, &quot;And no cheating.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Everyone was now writing the test, except for Jack. When he glanced at Teddy, he could see that Teddy was already on the second page. When Teddy noticed Jack looking, he pulled his test father to the side. Jack grumbled and whispered to Teddy, &quot;How am I suppose to do this? I&#39;m right handed for fuck sake!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just use your left hand.&quot; Teddy hissed without looking over. He felt Jack shove him, but let it slide. Jack looked down at his test and was starting to get mad. He didn&#39;t study like Teddy, but that didn&#39;t mean he didn&#39;t know the answers, and without a hand to write with, he didn&#39;t see the difference. Jack finally gave in and took one of the other pencils, and did his best to write. He had gotten through the first page, and started the second when his pencil broke. He gave Teddy another nudge. Teddy turned and whispered, &quot;What?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack held up the pencil, making Teddy sigh. Teddy reached into their bag and pulled out a sharpener, and put it on the desk before going back to writing. Jack sat for a moment. He looked at the sharpener, then to Teddy ,then back down again. He gave Teddy another shove as he tried to sharpen his pencil with one hand. Teddy mumbled something to himself with an angry tone. He had no choice but to help Jack. &quot;Yeah... this sucks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys!&quot; Mr. Jones was looking at them, &quot;No talking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just trying to sharpen a pencil here Mr. Jones.&quot; Jack talked back, and Teddy gave him a shove for it. They each went back to their tests. Jack looked at his scribbled numbers, then over at Teddy&#39;s, who was pretty much already done. He was staring at back and forth between the tests, and feeling like he should just give up. That&#39;s when his glanced up and was Mr.Jones standing a foot away. Jack sighed and rolled his eyes. Mr.Jones took Jack&#39;s test away, and told them to wait outside after Teddy had finished.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once Teddy had finished, they got up and handed it in, then walked out into the hall. Jack took over, and leaned against some lockers, letting themselves slide to the floor. &quot;This isn&#39;t fair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You got caught cheating...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn&#39;t cheating!&quot; Jack threw his arm in the air. He found that tears were building up in his eyes, &quot;I was just really frustrated with how far ahead you were, and how shitty it seemed I was doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s ok Jack.&quot; Teddy put his right arm around them to try and comfort his friend, &quot;I know you know how to do that stuff. And you&#39;re right, it&#39;s not fair. You get screwed over, just because you&#39;re on the left side?&quot; Teddy did his best to hug Jack, &quot;It&#39;s stupid anyways. In this world, we&#39;re stuck together forever. As long as one of us understands, isn&#39;t that good enough?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Jones had come out in time to here that last sentence, &quot;I can see why you think that way. But you guys have always wanted to be treated as two different people. So... that&#39;s how I&#39;ve been treating you. I wouldn&#39;t let any other two students cheat so...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn&#39;t cheating!&quot; Jack repeated, and went a little red faced.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok. I believe you, just calm down.&quot; Mr.Jones crouched down on one knee. &quot;I can tell by looking at your paper that somethings... off. I&#39;ve never seen you write like that before.&quot; He looked from one boy to the other, &quot;Is everything ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya, we&#39;re ok.&quot; They said together. Jack kept his head down, but Teddy raised his, &quot;You&#39;re not gonna tell our parents are you?&quot; Mr.Jones thought for a moment then shook his head. &quot;Cool, thanks.&quot; Teddy and Jack lifted themselves off the floor, and dusted themselves off.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll let it go.&quot; Mr.Jones smiled, &quot;But I expect better next time ok?&quot; Jack and Teddy both nodded just as the bell rang. They went back into the class and gathered up their things before heading off for their break between classes.</p>
