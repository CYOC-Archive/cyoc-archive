<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not all of the members of the BAE sorority was enjoying the ongoing party. Chief of among them was the lesbian goth Lizbeth, whose conservative mother had insisted she join the sorority as a condition for paying her tuition. Eager to get out of the stifling environs of her home, and into the more accepting world of college, she&#39;d accepted and now regretted it every day.<br />
<br />
Here she was surrounded by all sorts of hot girls, and not one of them was into her. Not that she&#39;d ever admit being attracted to them publicly, being proud of her jet black hair and pale skin. Her black dresses and heavy combat boots, with matching dark makeup completed this vision of gothic aloofness. She held herself apart of the babes of BAE.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d tried to mingle earlier in the party, but that ended once the &quot;dude bros&quot; from &#924;&#913;&#925; arrived. Lizbeth had tried to blend in with the walls, not interested in hearing any of their lame frat boy pick-up lines. However, as she&#39;d been cutting across the back, she found herself splashed by one of them falling into the pool. Now drenched, she&#39;d turned towards a pair of them who were laughing at the guy who they&#39;d obviously pushed into.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goddamnit! My clothes are ruined.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her finger pointed right at the one in the red polo shirt with the greek letters of the &#924;&#913;&#925; fraterity on it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Like whoa, chill out, babe. Just slip out of those wet clothes..&quot;<br />
<br />
Mick smiled, wondering what she looked like under all that dark clothes. She wasn&#39;t unattractive and he really wasn&#39;t that picky.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, just get undressed!&quot;<br />
<br />
The comments got a high five for the talking frat boy from his fellows. The cocky bastard even smiled at her, and that only made it worse when she saw some of her sorority sisters also laughing at her discomfort.<br />
<br />
&quot;You fucker!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I was just offerin&#39; some advice. No need to dyke out on me, babe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lizbeth paused, seething but somehow not able to form a coherent response to the insult. Instead, she just stomped off towards the sorority house, the laughter of the frat bro ringing in her ears and unaware that the curse had just attached itself to her.<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
Clomping upstairs and into her bedroom, Lizbeth was furious. She&#39;d never been so embarrassed, and what was worse, she was pretty certain the other girls would suspect her secret now, and that meant her mother might find out too. Her mood further tanked, which meant she needed a release, and now<br />
<br />
After she&#39;d peeled off the top layer of her clothes, the goth lesbian had reached over and pulled something out of her desk, her favorite dildo. There was a brief shudder of excitement at the thought of what she was going to do with it, and that sealed her fate.  <br />
<br />
It started with her feet, as her heavy boots lightened in color and material, the black giving way to red. Her pale ankles were exposed as the fishnets she&#39;d been wearing faded away just as the stylish sneakers finsished forming on her smaller feet. She kicked them off, oblivious to the change.<br />
<br />
Proceeding up her pale legs, there was a flush of tan skin that washed up from her toes, now painted in red. Along with this came a lengthening of bones and toning of muscles, leaving her with an athlete&#39;s legs. Of course, there was also a change to the black skirt she&#39;d been wearing, as it tore and reformed into two tubes that were tight against her swelling thighs. Back pockets pressed themselves outwards, just ahead of Lizbeth&#39;s flat ass surging outwards into a vision of rounded beauty, changing her panties into an as yet unseen red bikini bottom. <br />
<br />
As a thin brown leather belt winded its way around her waist, there was a contraction, which tightened her stomach and emphasized her wider hips. Likewise, the wave of tanning flowed up from her legs, reaching her belly button which gained a piercing. The sudden pain from this caught Lizbeth&#39;s attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot;<br />
<br />
She exclaimed, but a memory of getting that done popped into her mind, calming her. And it was hardly alone. Other memories followed, of time spent at the gym and the tanning salon. Of shopping for cute clothing and spending time with her sorority sisters. But the intrustion of her still lingering physical attraction to them was met with a flash of repulsion. She didn&#39;t like them like that...<br />
<br />
As the fading goth girl struggled with her new memories, the changes proceed up to her torso. For a moment, her black clothing exploded away, revealing the lacy bra she&#39;d been wearing underneath. It twisted itself into a red bikini top whose its cups were large enough to accommodate the sudden swell of her bust line into the c-range. Her breasts also gained the sun-kissed perfection that had sliding upwards, and it soon moved down her arms. Muscle toned up and various bits of gothic accessories were swept away in the tanned wake. Her nails grew longer, gaining polish that matched her toes. <br />
<br />
Inside her head, Lizbeth was struggling now, trying to hold to some remmant of her old self. But the woman she was becoming wouldn&#39;t have any of it, and obliterated the traces of lesbianism with a flood of positive emotions. The shadow that always seemed to cloud her mind was brushed away by the bright light of heterosexuality. But the still forming sorority babe did cling onto one of her former self&#39;s memories, that of the frat boys down by the pool.<br />
<br />
As if in response to the final mental changes locking into place, Lizbeth&#39;s long black lock retracted swiftly, until they settled into a semi-bob cut. The darkness was fading into something much more blonder. Meanwhile, the skin of her face tanned, even as her cheeks shifted higher and her lips plumped up with red lipstick. There was a final shake of her head, as the goth Lizbeth gave way the perky soroity sister Lisa!<br />
<br />
With a giggle, she grabbed a pink towel that appeared on her bed, which set off a chain reaction for the rest of the room. Dark gave way to light, as posters of hot guys popped into existance and her various cheerleading thophies pushed away the gloomy books on the shelves. By the time, Lisa had gotten to the door, the room was changed completely into a sea of pinks and reds. <br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
Heading back downstairs, Lisa quickly mingled with the party, and made her way over to the pool. Kicking off her shorts, and tossing aside her towel, she dove into the pool. As the blonde cheerleader came up for air, she caught the eye of Mick, who was gobbedsmacked by the latest &#914;&#913;&#917; babe...</p>
