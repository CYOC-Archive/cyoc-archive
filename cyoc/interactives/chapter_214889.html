<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While the maids were shipping out the less desired parts of her collection, Selicia stood in her consultation room looking at the décor she kept within. Most of the items in this room her handpicked by her to distract, unsettle, and/or influence the current clients. Many were her first acquirements since her return but, some of them had lost their luster. Not quite enough to warrant ridding herself of them but, a change of scenery was most definitely in order… So she’d started taking down a number of the smaller items strewn about placing them on the table in the center for relocation. <br />
<br />
A glint from between the couch cushions had caught her eye as she sat the final item down on the table. It was possibly something left from a previous client like a phone, coin, or some sort of jewelry. So she made her way over to retrieve the item in question. A grimace soon crossed her face as the item came to light and she was reminded of the encounter. The small coin purse with the appearance of a tightly clamped vagina rested in her hand. She’d nearly forgotten about that pig woman with equal manners making demands of her… <br />
<br />
The door to the room opened revealing that small maid girl, she’d still neglected to get the name of… She peered cautiously at Selicia seeming to have caught the look of annoyance on her face and shrinking back from it. With a curl of Selicia’s finger, the small girl approached remaining wary of her even as she dropped the look from her face. Selicia tossed the coin purse to the maid and asked a simple question; “Your name, what is it?”<br />
<br />
There was an almost inaudible squeak of surprise as the maid shrunk into herself defensively. “So… Sofia… Mistress…” She seemed to brace for some sort of action from Selicia even as she spoke.<br />
<br />
“Where were you that evening? During the event with my uninvited guests?” Selicia hardened her gaze of the maid feeling that it would get a straight answer out of her.<br />
<br />
“I… I…” There was a long pause as she shriveled and fought within herself to bring out an answer. “I was in your bathroom delivering fresh towels… When I heard the noise… I… I… hid in the closet there…” She wouldn’t even meet Selicia’s gaze now, muttering under her breath nervously. “Y… You’re going to punish me now… Aren’t you…?”<br />
<br />
Selicia laughed and shook her head; it was possibly the safest and worst place to have been at the time. She couldn’t fault the girl for hiding at the commotion however and she wasn’t forbidden from the room as it was. Seeing the maid brace herself again, Selicia merely gave her further instruction before bidding her to leave. “As for that purse… Give it to Lisa or Min, have them place it in a bin as a gift for the first person to buy something.” Watching the girl bow out of the room and leave, Selicia thought about what to add to the décor. With a snap of her finger, she left for her bedroom to gather just what came to mind.<br />
<br />
Within a few minutes she’d come back with that special box from her room’s own collection. Opening the box, she slowly removed each of the five toys from within with a grin. Mentally each one threatened, protested, or pleaded with her except for one lost in its pleasure ridden mind. Not wanting to potentially damage her trophies while they were on display for her, she conjured rods of light that were cool to the touch. Each ending in a nearly transparent stand for “practical” purposes. One by one, the trophies were slid down a rod and each of them responded to their intrusion wonderfully. <br />
<br />
Each had a faint glow to them and were placed on either end table of the couches in the room. The Sapphire toy was placed on the center of the mantle directly behind Selicia’s chair. Before she’d gotten the chance to really enjoy her new décor, her attention was brought to the door where Sofia peered through again. There had been a visitor at the front gate, a new client had asked for a walk-in appointment. It had been a while since she’d performed her little show and it seemed the time to begin again was upon her.<br />
<br />
“Bring them in~” <br />
<br />
The young woman Sofia brought in to the room could’ve been her sister from the way they carried themselves so similarly. Selicia bade the young woman to have a seat and before she could ask what the visit was for, she was alerted to an intrusion at the storefront. A swift apology saw Selicia leave the room and enter to the storefront in a blink to deal with the unexcepted guest. In the room by herself the young woman looked about the room until her eyes lay upon the ruby red lamp sitting to her right. <br />
<br />
She didn’t want to pick it up for fear of breaking it but, she did lean over to look closer at the details. Her face turned almost as red as the lamp seeing the intricately detailed torso of a beautiful but, confused woman. The light glistened through the woman’s body highlighting its large breasts, nipples, face, ass, and of course the large pussy engulfing the light at the base. Reaching a hand to the lamp, she thought she’d feel cold glass but, instead ran her fingers over supple rubber. Feeling the face shift and the nipples flick against her finger tip, she ran her hand down to the base of the lamp. It was as she felt the nub of the stiff clit and the gentle folds of the lips that she realized the woman had returned. Bolting upright, she sheepish smiled at the woman’s knowing smirk.<br />
<br />
Selicia came back into the room as the young woman gently caressed the ruby colored onahole become lamp next to her. Hearing the lamentations of the woman trapped within made it all the sweeter to her. The young woman in question, now that she could get a good look at her, was very much plain in comparison. She wasn’t quite with out curves but, was very slender in shape. It wasn’t long after the trophies were placed that they’d already performed admirably as Selicia allowed the inspection to take place. However, once the young woman had reached the base of the trophy, her green eyes caught Selicia and she turned around as if she’d prepared for a scolding.<br />
<br />
Setting the inspection aside, Selicia walked over to her chair and settled in. “So, what has brought you to my services, Dear?” She laced her fingers on her lap waiting for the young woman’s response. From where she sat the scent of vanilla already pervaded the air from the trophy behind her. Taking a deep breath of the scent, Selicia smiled ‘gently’ toward the client trying to let her speak on her own.<br />
<br />
“Well… You see… I’m here because…” She was obviously still embarrassed after being caught in the act it seemed. Selicia silently budged her confidence forward with a wisp of magic. “I’m not very confident!” The young woman blurted out before covering her mouth in surprise. “Sorry… Sorry… Its true though, I’ve got no confidence in anything… Life, work, school, myself, or well… Myself…” She gestured to her thin frame as she subconsciously eyes the lamp next to her. <br />
<br />
“Ah… So, you want to be more ‘confident’ in yourself then… That should be quite the easy fix my dear. Why… I think I know just the way to help resolve this issue~ Let me help with-” A second intrusion was brought to her mind as she spoke. With a sigh, Selicia stood and made for the door again. “I’ll be right back, something requires my attention for a moment.” Seeing the young woman nod, she left for the storefront once more.<br />
<br />
Alone in the room again, the young woman found herself eyeing that ruby lamp again. Not wanting to be caught playing with it again, she averted her eyes to the other side of the couch where she saw the clear lamp resting. Scooching over to that side to be away from the first lamp, she looked over the other. The details of this lamp seemed to glow brighter than the previous become the brightest points on it. This one was similar but, the woman seemed excited even with her modest proportions. As she looked this one over, she caught the smell of vanilla wafting in the air. Taking a deep breath she felt the scent invade her deeply causing her to shiver.<br />
<br />
Her legs instinctively closed the gap between them as she squirmed slightly. Funny and sad was the fact that vanilla all of smells was her ‘trigger’… Plain girl, plain scent… A cruel joke played on her by the world, she figured. Already she could feel the excitement riding though her. Certainly, between her legs as her pussy became damp in their cotton confines. She reached out and gently caressed this lamp as she had the other but, stroked the base a few times. “You’re just like me, aren’t you? Just plain and simple as they come but… Look at you, so happy despite all that…” She subconsciously stroked the lamp’s base in place of herself as her breath became husky. Shaking her head and practically throwing herself from the lamp, she collided with something on the couch. Turning her head, she sobered quickly from her trance-like state seeing that she’d crashed into the lady of the house.<br />
“Oh god! I’m so so sorry! I… Uh… I got lost in thought! And I… Didn-” She was hushed by a finger to her lips that seemed to bring her a calming feeling. As she relaxed, the lady of the house, just smiled and nodded. “S-Sorry…” Once more she apologized and received no anger or disappointment.<br />
<br />
“Just tell me all about your issue, will you?” Selicia said as the magic of the touch placated the young woman leaving her calm and pliable. As the girl began to lay everything out for her, Selicia rubbed the young woman’s shoulder gently. It wasn’t just the girl’s attitude that had become pliant, the shoulder slowly separated from the young woman’s body. Holding her arm in her hands, Selicia saw that it was paid no mind as the young woman vented her problems. So she began molding and rolling the arm in her hands until all that remained was a flesh toned ball that she split in half.<br />
<br />
With a single breath the client’s clothing was swept away into thin air leaving her completely exposed to Selicia. She continued to confide in Selicia the entire time that the halves of the ball were pressed against her bare chest. A little kneading and shaping afterward and she’d gone from dainty A cups to sizable F cups with just one arm. As a test, Selicia gave one of the new nipples a twist and was pleased to hear the client gasp but, continue her venting. Selicia stood up and came around behind her and the couch as she eased the other arm off like the first. Coming back around, she looked at the now top-heavy young woman.<br />
<br />
“Do be a dear and lay down, will you? It’ll help you relax; I assure you.” Watching the girl move to lay down, Selicia gestured for her to lay on her stomach seeing how she was going to lay on her back. The client didn’t even question the suggestion leaving her exposed ass toward Selicia. Once again, she rolled the arm into a ball and applied the halves to the modest ass before her. This time however something about her was being quite honest as the flesh was molded into shape. Her sex was moistening the longer she was laying down.<br />
<br />
“Dear, might I ask you what excites you so much about being here?” Selicia applied the question carefully as she worked the first leg loose.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I <i>really</i> love the smell of vanilla… I don’t know why though… I know, it’s funny isn’t it…” The young girl continued to degrade herself for this weakness of hers. As she spoke, Selicia worked the much larger ball into the clients back and along her sides to balance her frame against her newest assets. All the while, her fluids seeped out and onto the cushion below her. They’d have to be cleaned in short order after today’s visit was over… With that, the other leg was off and Selicia was left wondering what to do with it.<br />
<br />
The young woman nonchalantly tried to roll over but, failed at first without the limbs to do it. So, she squirmed her limbless body a bit at a time until she faced Selicia laying face up on the couch. Her eyes fell on her leg calmly and then she inspected her body after. A moment of contemplation fell on her face before she asked a single question. “Hey… Why am I naked?” She shuddered as she caught another breath of vanilla, her pussy’s flow becoming heavier. “You know… No one’s ever seen me naked before… Except my family and all… I don’t know but, is it weird that I kinda like it?” Biting her lip, she arched her back slightly as the shiver caused a small spurt of fluids. “Oh… S-Sorry…” She sheepishly yet, hornily giggled toward Selicia.<br />
<br />
With a small sigh, Selicia considered possibilities of what to do with this last piece… It came to her in second as she snapped, freezing the young woman in place, expression and all. Slowly Selicia worked the leg into a flat base wider than the frozen client with the foot being shaped into a stiff rod at the center. She carried the base out into the main foyer and set aside a bust previously placed in the center between the stairs. The base in place, she went back for the main portion of the piece, that being the client herself. As she carried the client out to the base, the body in her arms lightened as the material changed from flesh to supported silicone.<br />
<br />
She eased the moist vaginal opening down onto the rod and stepped back. The client was nothing more than a lifelike statue of her now curvaceous form. Her face frozen biting her lip as her eyes gazed enticingly toward any observers around her. Of course, she was just as pliable as the ‘lamps’ she’d favored in the room before should anyone decide to check. The final touch came in the form of a pair of lit vanilla incense sticks to either side of her body. It was a small gesture to be favorable of her first official client since shutting down for a time. The former client didn’t seem to mind at all as the vanilla and stares around her kept her quite excited~</p>
