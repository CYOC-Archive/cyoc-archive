<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Oh, someone&#39;s dresser is inexplicably in a sex shop because of confused location? Clearly that means there was a vast reality-warping war and evolving robots have sex with them! ...My justifications are generally absurd, but roll with them as you like.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jake came, he noticed the watch had a countdown timer from the 24 hours before with an &#39;EDITOR COOLDOWN&#39; notice below it. So, maybe he&#39;d be able to fix this tomorrow.<br />
<br />
The sex shop staffer browsed over (a handsome young man in a suit with a pink tie), knocking on the changing room door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you okay in there?&quot; he asked. &quot;That device is pretty young, it hasn&#39;t fleshed out all its upgrades yet and takes a pretty long time to cool down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh,&quot; Jake answered confusedly, glancing at the changing room drawer, &quot;what does a wristwatch being young mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;These sorts of things grow new abilities and update themselves over time.&quot; the staffer said. &quot;That&#39;s why their powers are so inconsistent and stuff. Adaptive, like people&#39;s sexual tastes. I can wake up the reality fixer and detach &#39;em if you&#39;re having problems. Don&#39;t bother covering up, I think that one&#39;s cock-centered and I&#39;ll wanna see if they understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, but I&#39;m indecent.&quot; Jake warned, unlocking the stall door.<br />
<br />
The staffer came in, closed the door behind them, and knelt to examine Jake&#39;s cock and wrist with more clinical definition than anything. Noting the sudden presence of the dresser with a mix of tighty-whities and briefs, the staffer sighed a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, poor thing is having trouble figuring out what goes where, and establishing a genderfluid identity to boot. I can nudge along her training a bit. Hey, Jake guy, you want me to fix this and take it back?<br />
<br />
Glancing at the watchlike device on his wrist, he contemplated...<br />
<br />
&quot;I can just fix it when this device cools down, right?&quot; Jake asked. &quot;So I&#39;ll just ratchet my rod up afterward and uh, no problems. I&#39;ll keep...her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sure.&quot; the staffer confirmed. &quot;But the dresser shouldn&#39;t be here. I can, uh, interface with her and get that back to what-n-where it should be. I&#39;ll do touch contact, she&#39;s used to that. Might shift to a boy soon, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do what you gotta, I guess?&quot; Jake said.<br />
<br />
The staffer nodded and gently gripped the wristwatch. Strange symbols and what looked like holographic program representations flowed between the staffer&#39;s hand and the computer, apparently something about progressions. The watch screen seemed to pull out of the watch, expanding into a cell phone tentatively, then inexplicably shifting back, testing out a new physical mechanism.<br />
<br />
An indeterminate amount of time passed, Jake with his pants down and the staffer kneeling boredly in front of his cocklet like it was a particularly puzzling message board.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, uh, gotta go pee.&quot; Jake said nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck it, I feel up to watersports.&quot; the staffer said unexpectedly. &quot;Just go in my mouth. I&#39;m a device like her, I&#39;ll reprocess it into something. My name&#39;s Chodd, by the way. No, it&#39;s Welsh, not &#39;fuck&#39;. Though I&#39;d do that too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sticking out his tongue, he gently lifted up Jake&#39;s cock and Jake just didn&#39;t have it in him to resist Chodd&#39;s bizarre forwardness. He released the pressure in his bladder, meriting a messy spray in the staffer&#39;s mouth that was swallowed repeatedly without incident, like misuse of a bizarre water fountain. Chodd drank it all, putting forward surprising emotional neutrality.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it is a <i>sex</i> shop.&quot; Chodd commented, licking his lips and emitting an oddly minty breath pulse. &quot;You, uh, want a happy ending with that urinal use?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake stared blankly, prompting Chodd to clarify &quot;Uh, while I&#39;m down here, you want a blowjob for that cocklet? Shouldn&#39;t take too much effort with your current release settings, and it&#39;ll help your complementary watch understand your pleasure senses better. I&#39;ll show her how to do a sexual stamina refresh option to boot since you came recently and are still facing refractory period. We&#39;ll even go a few times to make your maintenance wait less boring.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake blinked repeatedly and nodded. Chodd went back down, licking Jake&#39;s suddenly very hard cock. Jake rose to orgasm almost immediately, prompting Chodd to suck up the load. And yet, despite this absurd premature ejaculation, he was still raring to go, gently stroking Chodd&#39;s head as he kept coming every few motions, Chodd gripping his wrist the whole time. Shortly, Chodd pulled off, satisfied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y&#39;know, most small-cocked guys enjoy bottoming. Would you like to try some oral stimulation followed by anal? I&#39;ll provide a condom for you to control the mess, and I&#39;ll edit my seminal fluid parameters to disperse stainlessly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake, blissed out and yet really horny, moaned &quot;Dooooo iiiiit&quot;, to which Chodd stood up (still gripping the watch, as always) and let his pants spring open as if unbuttoned by an unseen servant. Apparently going commando or something, an 8-inch erect cock flopped out above testicles the size of golf balls. A condom appeared on Jake&#39;s own erection, to which Jake came immediately and yet again had his refractory period skipped. Jake began sucking amateurishly, to which Chodd rolled his eyes and said &quot;Avoid using your teeth, roll your lips a bit, be gentle.&quot; in a mildly condescending definitely patronizing tone. &quot;Good boy. You&#39;re kind of fun, I&#39;ll add my contact info to your device and phone so you and me can hook up whenever after work. This is still tech support by the way, your device is really sorry about the furniture misplacement. Less so about the genitals, but that&#39;s because you didn&#39;t tell me to fix &#39;em so she will help you once cooled down.&quot;<br />
<br />
A much more standard human sexual endurance later, Chodd pumped a load into Jake&#39;s mouth (prompting Jake to swallow anyway) and gently pulled off. &quot;Now,&quot; he said. &quot;While we&#39;re explaining to her how to properly scope outfits and describe underwear types, we might as well teach your anal cavity something. Watch this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Inexplicably, Jake suddenly found himself hefted up back against the wall, legs on Chodd&#39;s shoulders, pants hanging off to one side, and a lubricated cock probing his butthole as some fingers from Chodd&#39;s free hand played about. Jake came, then came again, creating a slightly silly cum bubble in his condom that made it look like his dick wasn&#39;t pathetic. Chodd finally stretched Jake open, and eased his cock in to let Jake take it in gently. He slowly built up a rhythm of pumping in and out, Jake pushed over the line of orgasm more times in a few minutes than most women did in an orgy.<br />
<br />
With a &#39;pop&#39; and the subtle shifting of reality, Jake&#39;s dresser returned to his house instead of a random sex shop reality-alterer ranch changing room, and Chodd absolutely creampied Jake&#39;s ass. Jake just kept orgasming for a while, clenching down on the thick rod of the salesman, before finally easing out and finishing with a rather silly bubble around his cock. Chodd finally let go of the watch, fingersnapped for effect, and pulled the cum-balloon off without spilling any or leaving residue.<br />
<br />
&quot;As stated, that creampie will clean itself up without staining anything, so feel free to just pull up your pants and try not to worry.&quot; Chodd confirmed in a much more businesslike tone, pulling his junk back into his own pants and straightening his tie before flashing a ridiculously pretty smile as if he hadn&#39;t just been fucking in a changing room.<br />
<br />
Jake stared in something resembling shock, before heeding advice and pulling up his pants, mini-schlong satisfied and not too oversensitive. &quot;I&#39;ll, uh...text you and see how this goes, I guess?&quot; Jake said, confirming that Chodd&#39;s information was indeed somehow on his phone. &quot;And tomorrow we&#39;ll see about resizing my wiener, sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chodd winked, to which Jake sheepishly smiled back. Jake left and did some necessary checkout for his First Item Free deal, buying a few legitimately ordinary condoms, some lube, a vibrator, and a guide collection on raising a reality-warping sex toy (&quot;From Cock Shop To God Mod: Your Chronovacuoleoid And You(r Sub-World)&quot; by TransDem Labs) on his way out.<br />
<br />
Jake headed home without incident (albeit getting used to the marked difference in package) and passed a few hours with mindless videogames, dinner, research, sleep, and some plans for tomorrow (mostly looking up the advantages of different cock sizes). His new wristwatch buddy (yet to be named, but definitely genderfluid) watched along and chatted, occasionally displaying emote faces of interest, stating short bursts of text and/or audio about how it was learning and growing, and sometimes even making snarky jokes about control options it was developing. Most notably, a &#39;Wow, I was really threatening back there. Sorry about that, I really hope I can make it up to you once I&#39;ve cooled down.&#39; apology over that misphrased &#39;SERVICE ENDED&#39; thing that turned out to just be an action confirmation, and other possible genital configurations being discussed. Chodd texted back about how work was today and all that.<br />
<br />
Society having advanced past the need for human workers beyond personal fulfillment thanks to the advent of blatantly reality warping technology in the wake of the unreality war (albeit much of it questionably controlled or in the hands of crazy people), most sapients received government stipends for what legacy of shopping they still wanted. As society refined its bubble-worlding and definition-shenanigans, and obtained more through a mix of personal credit, shady corporate-government authority contracts tended to leave the world in a haze of &#39;oh, sure, transform it, someone connected to a corp and immune to awareness denial will fix it later if you leave it unattended or broken long enough&#39;. This left Jake with a lot of free time...</p>
