<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>When I woke up again I noticed that I felt odd. Getting up I go over to the mirror and find that I've shifted into a Sleestak from the 
movie <I>Land of the Lost</I>. I was dreaming that I was in the movie and I was spying on the Sleestak. I didn't have full control of my 
ability and if I have a pretty vivid dream I shift into what I am in the dream. I smiled revealing the two rows of teeth in my mouth. 
Shifting now meant that I had gotten over being sick since we couldn't shift while sick. The body needed the energy and resources to 
fight off whatever was making us sick.</p>
<p>"A Sleestak Ariel?" Mommy asked making me jump. I hadn't notices her coming in.</p>
<p>"I had been dreaming," I said with a shrug.</p>
<p>"Well you make a cute Sleestak," Mommy said making me blush a little bit. "I think you should shift back though and take a shower. 
Me and your sisters were going to go to the bazaar and now you can go to if you want."</p>
<p>"I want to go Mommy," I said as I started concentrating on my original form. A deep warmth spread throughout my body as the shift 
started. Two off the claws on each of my hands broke in two lengthwise and became eight fingers while the remaining two claws 
became thumbs. The claws on my feet followed the same change as the claws on my hands. The scales all over my body became 
smooth and returned to my light skin tone. My face squished in forming a human face while the horn melted into the top of my head. My 
ears popped out of the sides of my head as my red hair grew from my scalp until it was waist length. My eyes shrank from the big black 
eyes of a Sleestak down to human eyes and the black continued to shrink down to my pupils revealing my green eyes. I was once 
again myself and I went to take a shower.</p>
<p>I was ready to go in an hour having spent a long time in the shower making sure I was clean and looking at my budding breasts. I 
still had that dream stuck in my head and considered growing my breasts as large as in my dream but decided against it. I felt good 
about my body and didn't want to change it other than shifting to animals and other things just for fun. Now I was wearing a Circo® 
Green Short-Sleeve Butterfly Dress, a Xhilaration® Teal Stars Crop Bra underneath, and a pair of white Xhilaration® Gertha Chop-Out 
Ballet Flats and we were in the car heading to the bazaar. Mommy was looking a bit nervous as we did and I thought that she was 
thinking about what had happened to Janet and her family. In fact before we left she told us to be prepared to shift to mist and to do so 
if a black van headed right for us. I guess she thought the accident wasn't an accident.</p>
<p>When we arrived Mommy said, "Ok make sure you have your phones turned on and to be aware of what's going on around you. 
Ariel, I want you to stick with Amber and I don't want any arguments. I'm not comfortable with you being on your own right now."</p>
<p>"So you trusted Steve and Mike to be able to watch me?" I asked. I loved my older brothers but the acted like they were five most 
of the time. I lost count of the times Mommy had told them off for doing something stupid when they shifted that could have gotten them 
killed. "Where are they anyway?"</p>
<p>"They may be immature but they do love you and would give their lives to protect you," Mommy said with a smile. "When they heard 
that you were coming with us they went to a friend's house. I just hope they don't get in trouble again."</p>
<p>Me and Amber wove our way through the crowds at the bazaar. I was glad that Amber was with me since she would be going to 
college in the fall. Whenever I thought about that I got a little sad and would hang around her almost being clingy. She didn't mind it 
though understanding that I was going to miss her. She told me that she would miss me too and we should spend as much time 
together as possible before she left. "Let go," a voice said breaking into my thoughts.</p>
<p>I looked over toward the voice as a girl said, "Shawna, don't be this way. Let's go find aunt Brenda." She took Shawna's hand and 
started walking off stopping every now and then evidently looking for someone. We were going the same way and were close enough to 
hear the girl mutter stuff like, "Mother told us to stay together," and "Don't know why you and your sister had to go running off like 
that."</p>
<p>After a couple times of them stopping Shawna asked, "Why did you call me Shawna? My name is Sean."</p>
<p>The girl looked at Shawna seeming to be distracted and said, "I call you Shawna because that is your name, and I do not care what 
mom and aunt Brenda say about you going through a tom-boy phase."</p>
<p>I raised my eyebrows at this since Shawna seemed to be too young for a tomboy phase. I would guess that she was seven years 
old and the girl pulling her along was nine though I would think she was older than that by the way she acted. Maybe she was a shifter 
too and she liked being nine. That had to be it. I would find out later after I had figured out a way to ask her without scaring her.</p>
<p>My eyes fell upon an old oil lamp on a table for one of the vendors and I stopped letting Shawna and the girl draw away. It looked 
like Aladdin's lamp and for a moment I had the fantasy of rubbing it and a genie coming out. If there was a genie in there then my first 
wish would be for Janet and her family to be alive. My second wish would be for Erika and Ann to come back unharmed. My third wish 
would be for us to have control over our bladders but still retain the ability to shift like we always had. But what were the chances of 
genies being real anyway? Still I wanted it so I dragged Amber over and asked the man, "How much for this oil lamp?"</p>
<p>The man looked at me and said, "This isn't an oil lamp. It's a genie's lamp. Not the one that Aladdin had but one just as rare. This 
lamp is the lamp of Beldazarr, The Djinn of Mind and Body. It's worth millions but I'll sell it to you for twenty bucks."</p>
<p>I smiled and handed the man twenty bucks and received the lamp in return. I didn't believe that he would sell something worth 
millions for only twenty bucks but his sales pitch was neat and I had already decided to buy it. I placed it in my bag and I started 
peeing. Sighing I said, "I need to go to the restroom Amber."</p>
<p>"So do I," she said taking my hand.</p>
<p>As we made our way to the restroom I thought again of what I would wish for if genies were real.</p></p>
