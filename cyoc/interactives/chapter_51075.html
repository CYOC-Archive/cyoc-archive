<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While much of the pack was beginning to prepare for dinner, Julie fulfilled her assigned role. To be the Pack's doctor. Pearl wasn't in that serious a shape. The bleeding had stopped and it appeared that she would be fine. The scratches weren't that deep.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've done fairly well teaching Alpha Female first aide,&quot; Julie said to her sister as Fran and Darla stood behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, sister,&quot; Darla answered.<br />
<br />
Julie then turned to several boxes of assorted bandages as June would need them. The bite wound wasn't life threatening and would likely heal quickly, but it was deep enough that if left alone it could get infected. Again Kaylee had done decent preparation work, now all was needed for the final touches.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would advise that you not mate while the bandage is on,&quot; Julie spoke to the silver/gray she wolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not mate?&quot; June asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Such activity might dislodge the bandage, and could risk infection,&quot; Julie told the she-wolf she was treating, &quot;or put strain on the muscles around it and open the wound again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; June admitted.<br />
<br />
Julie then turned to Zack who was seated beside June, still with a bag of ice on one knee. She knelled down and moved the ice bag to a place on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're sure nothing is broken?&quot; Julie inquired, as she began carefully feeling along where the tendons and ligaments to that knee were, looking for anything out of place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing feels broken,&quot; Zack answered, &quot;and I wouldn't be overly concerned with the whole mating issue. Even I'm a little nervous about the snatch and grab mission first thing tomorrow morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe Alice could help you get there,&quot; Fran mused aloud, &quot;if you run into something you can't beat, she can bring the group back to the manor and gather the rest of the Pack if need be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie shuddered a little. She didn't want to kill Serenity and didn't like the fact that it was one of the options Jensen was prepared to use, but he was the Master, and she was a threat to the Pack. They would have to do something about her.<br />
<br />
&quot;And it would give us the element of surprise,&quot; Darla nodded, &quot;but what about Alice, sisters? Suppose they grab her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She can stay within the mirrors,&quot; Fran put a paw on Darla's shoulders, &quot;if they run into something tough, Nicole, our &quot;ninja&quot; will lead the males out and Alice will return unharmed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope so, sister,&quot; Darla said weakly.<br />
<br />
Julie had to be careful as since her sisters were nervous, she was nervous. And she felt a large lump in her throat when she felt Darla nervously think of Alice's glass form smashed by something. The fact that Alice and her half sisters were indestructible was currently lost on the triplets for the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your knee should be fine for tomorrow,&quot; Julie eventually said after regaining her composure, &quot;though I'd still keep it iced tonight just to be safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, Beta Julie,&quot; Zack nodded.<br />
<br />
Julie and her sisters then departed to wash some of the oil smell off of them from taking apart the car. They hoped to be done before dinner.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Amy and Zelipe meanwhile were walking beside Mr. P as the massive black and gold wolf offered to show them to the room that had been set aside for the pack's pups. They found it to be a large room with one bed and a vanity mirror, but what attracted Amy and Zelipe's attention was what was in and outside the mirror.<br />
<br />
Inside the mirror was a blond seven and a half year old wolf girl trying on what liked like various outfits from around the world. Outside the mirror, two five year old glass statues were applauding the wolf girl in the mirror. Standing in the background was a she wolf with practically two of everything and six red eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;These are new pups?&quot; Martha asked Mr. P, drawing the glass wolves' attention the new arrivals.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Mr. P nodded, &quot;the children of Zack and June and Pearl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So pretty,&quot; Chester barked and licked Amy's paw.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Amy,&quot; Amy bowed to Martha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi ya,&quot; Zelipe repeated Bart's lesson. <br />
<br />
&quot;HI!&quot; came the chorus from the three glass pups as Alice leaped out of the mirror, returning to her glass form.<br />
<br />
The glass wolves then turned and quickly hugged the to newest pups of the pack, with none of the jealousy that Jenny seemed to have.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Alice, and these are my sisters, Abbey and Samantha,&quot; Alice introduced herself with a curtsy.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is a pleasure to meet you, Alice, Abbey, and Samantha-chan,&quot; Amy spoke politely.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're made of glass!&quot; Zelipe gasped, tapping Samantha's right shoulder with a finger.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we're very cute,&quot; Abbey giggled, &quot;Mom and Aunties all agree.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom and Aunties?&quot; Zelipe asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Darla is my mother,&quot; said Alice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Julie is my mother,&quot; said Abbey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fran is my mother,&quot; said Samantha, &quot;and the dog with you is our pet, Chester.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is an honor to meet you,&quot; Amy bowed again, &quot;and Chester-san is very friendly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She is very pretty,&quot; Chester repeated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes we heard you, Chester,&quot; Alice told the small dog, &quot;She is very pretty.&quot;<br />
<br />
They heard a soft &quot;ahem&quot; in the background which made Alice, Abbey, and Samantha turn to Martha who remained unmoved.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, and this is our nanny,&quot; Alice said to the two newest pups, &quot;Miss Martha. She looks after us when our respective parents are busy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Zelipe and Amy felt a great deal of security being in Martha's presence. Almost as much as when they were with their parents, but slightly more when they were with the Alpha Female alone, but then Kaylee and Jensen weren't their parents and their pack role wasn't to raise the pups.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi ya,&quot; Zelipe said to Martha as he approached the four armed wolf with some shyness.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope meet up with your expectations of a good pup, Martha-San,&quot; Amy bowed again.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is Miss Martha,&quot; Martha corrected, not knowing much about Japanese.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is what I said, Martha-san,&quot; Amy said again, &quot;I apologize if the way I word things does not match the way you expect.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha slowly nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Alice, doesn't she look like one of the wolves sewn on your kimono?&quot; Samantha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kimono?&quot; Amy turned.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have explored our world, the mirorverse,&quot; Alice explain, &quot;and played a fabulous game of dress up. It took us all over the world. We went to New York, to Tokyo, to Beijing, to Moscow, to Rome, to Paris, and London. And we gathered the reflections of outfits that suited our fancy. Miss Martha will alter them so we can wear them comfortably in the mirrorverse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you got a kimono in Tokyo?&quot; Amy asked, curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Alice smiled, &quot;with artwork of wolves in each of the seasons, and now that Samantha mentions it, you do resemble one of the pictures in a way. Very pretty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Alice-chan,&quot; Amy bowed to the eldest glass wolf.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;This is where we sleep?&quot; Coral asked as she looked at all the pushed together beds.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the female's den,&quot; Cobalt explained, &quot;this is where we sleep, and have joinings with the pack's males in a romantic nature. The male's den is on the other wing of the manor, and we have a co-ed den for both genders. The Master, Alpha Female, and Betas have their own room between ours and the male's den.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will we all fit on this bed?&quot; Lazuli asked, &quot;beds...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll all cuddle!&quot; Amethyst smiled happily and pulled Emerald and Garnet into a hug.<br />
<br />
Garnet silently muttered something to herself as her head was again pushed into Amethyst's extremely large bosom. Emerald only sighed.<br />
<br />
Cobalt led the gem colored she wolves into the female den, as Coral and Tourmaline were pulled into the greetings of another pink female, with an orange and white and a magenta female slightly behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; Maxine introduced herself, &quot;I'm Maxine, these are my best friends, Millie and Robyn. I must say that's nice to have more pink Pack mates. So many of us seem to be rather green.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or some shade of green,&quot; Millie added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coral.&quot; &quot;Tourmaline,&quot; the two gem colored wolves introduced themselves, &quot;and it is nice to see there is someone else who looks good in pink.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we're all going to get along fine,&quot; Maxine smiled.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, in the males den, Opal and Jasper were looking around the room. Unlike the female's den, the beds were not pushed together, and it appeared that they didn't have enough beds for each of them to have one to themselves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't you short a couple of beds?&quot; Opal asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably not,&quot; Nick smiled, &quot;Things get rather... &quot;happy&quot; here at night. Other then the night when we renovated the manor, I don't think there's been a night when we've all been here. After my first night with Nicole and some of the other females, they moved me to a different corner of the female's den.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My first time was in the co-ed den,&quot; Lawrence nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I ended up on the floor of a room where Millie, Robyn, Maxine, and I had been playing some hands of poker,&quot; Roger nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Poke her?&quot; Nick joked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's probably what the game turned into,&quot; Roger nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of the females play poker?&quot; Jasper asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of the females were male at one point,&quot; Lawrence spoke, &quot;so, it's logical that some things they liked as males transfered over to the when they were female. I think Jasmine still loves the movie &quot;Rudy&quot;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I join in the next time you play?&quot; Jasper asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Roger nodded, &quot;always good to make new friends. And while it's unlikely that we can use the game anymore to &quot;beef you up&quot; so to speak, to make you more desirable to the females, I'm sure we can give some tips on how to please those that are already part of the pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And maybe you let us have a go with Amethyst,&quot; Lawrence smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must warn you, she might have a go with anyone,&quot; Opal warned, &quot;with her bubbly personality, appearances may not mean all that much. You'd simply be there.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Who was that dear?&quot; Felicity asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was Serenity,&quot; Brian answered, &quot;she's talked with the Chief of Police. As she warned, he won't be getting involved, but she did say that there are about ten to twelve officers that are willing to help. We can expect them tomorrow evening.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tomorrow evening?&quot; Felicity asked, &quot;Why not tomorrow morning when Serenity comes here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They apparently have to come incognito and thus have to finish their shifts,&quot; Brian explained, &quot;it'll give us time to figure all of this out as to who will be the Pride Males and who will be the lionesses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd want you to be one of the males,&quot; Felicity told her husband, &quot;then you, I, and Mary will all be a real family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Brian spoke, &quot;but not every officer will want that. And with ten to twelve, fourteen when you add us, the Pride would only need three males at most.&quot; His voice then became nervous, &quot;I could very well end up your sister rather then your husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will always love you and Mary will always love you,&quot; Felicity told her husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Brian answered, &quot;maybe if I end up female... we can word something that insures that we swing the other way... so we'll still be together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't joke like that,&quot; Felicity said firmly, &quot;You will be male and I will play with your mane.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two then hugged.</p>
