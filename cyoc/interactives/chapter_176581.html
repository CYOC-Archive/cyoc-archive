<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;It would be irresponsible not to at least check out what else we could do here,&quot; you tell her.  &quot;I mean there are already so many possibilities.&quot;<br />
<br />
You click on Options and a full menu comes up. <br />
Body shape<br />
Body type<br />
Gender<br />
Sex<br />
Height<br />
Weight<br />
Face<br />
Hair<br />
<br />
There are so many options that you&#39;re just overwhelmed. &quot;I&#39;ll get us another glass.   I think that we are going to be her a while.&quot; Wendy trots of to the kitchen for refills.   You&#39;re excited enough that you have to get started. <br />
<br />
You click body type. The nude 3D color image of you continues to turn slowly while drop downs appear.  Currently it&#39;s set to Fit and Toned.  You click the option and select Athletic - Gymnastics.  The image becomes shorter and most of the curves disappear.  The breasts are much smaller at a large A cup size.  The arms and legs are slightly longer and the torso seems to be shorter.  As the image rotates you see that the butt has drawn in significantly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,  all of the most fun parts are tiny,&quot; Wendy remarks as soon as she returns and sees what you&#39;ve done.  &quot;I mean the flexibility would be great and having Jacob destroy that tight little pussy would be great.&quot;<br />
<br />
You look over and see her smiling as she hands you your wine glass. &quot;I&#39;m just looking.&quot; You tell her. <br />
<br />
You change it again to Voluptuous.  All of the curves are back and then some.   The breasts are in the J range,  the butt and hips are massive, there is no toning,  but the figure is back to around 5&#39;3&quot; vs the 4&#39; of the gymnastics. The drop down again and you skip over several including muscular,  body builder,  dainty,  skinny,  and football player. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;m happy with my body type,&quot; you say as you click on reset and see yourself back on the screen.  You go back to the menu and select Breasts. <br />
<br />
The image zooms to your double d&#39;s.  You select size and click on II. A warning pop-up says that current configuration will lead to back pains.  You click ok and the model updates with beach ball sizes bazingas. The arreolas are dish plate sized and the nipples look like a first. <br />
<br />
An eek sound comes out of Wendy. &quot;You&#39;d never find cloths to fit and I couldn&#39;t even get one of those massive nipples into my mouth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah,  that wasn&#39;t going to work.   You go back to DD and exit.  Wendy really did give you a great body.   What could you possibly change?  Scrolling through the menu you see cosmetics and click on it.   The shade of lipstick and nails is displayed.   &quot;Love those and I&#39;m not changing them.&quot; You do see the special note at the bottom.  Permanent. You click it and school through the options and select default. <br />
<br />
After that it shows Option 2. Clicking on it you see that you can select &quot;Last change to makeup permanent until removed or reapplied with new kit. Default selected within kit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you teach me how to do my makeup?&quot; You ask Wendy a little unsure. <br />
<br />
&quot;I would actually love to do that with you.  And if you don&#39;t like it,  you come back to this which is amazing on you.&quot;  She leans in and kisses you again. <br />
<br />
You select hair next.   Your hair color is going to stay.  You love and would never change the dark red curls. You look and pubic hair is an drop down.  Right now it&#39;s set to none. You click it and the model shows your bare pussy. You click bush and the pussy is covered with thick red tangles.  You click strip and you have a fine landing strip leading down. You decide to stay with bare. <br />
<br />
Also under hair you click body hair.  A statement says body hair covers everything except head hair and pubic hair.  You select none. You&#39;ve grown very used to your general hairless silky smooth body. <br />
<br />
Back out at the main you select Vagina.  It zooms back in on it.   Your current selection is medium clitorious, short hood,  small labia major,  small labia minor,  small vaginal opening. <br />
<br />
&quot;Change labia major to medium and you&#39;ll have a nice little camel toe,&quot; Wendy instructs. &quot;And a larger opening will make taking bigger dicks easier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jacob worked just fine once we got going.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh, that&#39;s cute.   You honestly think Jacob is going to be the biggest cock that I give you?&quot;  The look on her face is simply devious. Again,  your not shocked or anything really other than aroused. <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess we&#39;ll have to do it the old fashioned way and work up to the bigger then.&quot;  You click on vaginal depth. It&#39;s set to 6 inches.   You click 8 and move back out to the main menu. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why is there gender and sex?&quot; you ask and click on sex.   It shows your preferences. Currently selected is female - slightly bicurious. Wendy looks at you knowingly. An uhhmmhum sound from her before you hush her.  You look at the options and most are what you&#39;d expect, Gay, Bi, strictly straight,  gay curious,  poly,  ect.  Then you start to find other stuff.   Beastiality, necrophealia, ect.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Not into all of that,&quot; you say leaving it as you found it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not into that unless it&#39;s selected,&quot; Wendy points out. You give her the narrowed challenging eyes and move on.  You select submissiveness. It shows slightly submissive. You check the options and there is everything from completely dominant to totally submissive.  <br />
<br />
&quot;We should leave it at slightly sub since you are more than slightly dom in your normal form,&quot; Wendy interjects. &quot;Or even more submissive,  but I kind of like your outlook now.  You&#39;re willing to try what I want,  but also put up just a bit of fight.   I like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
You can&#39;t argue.   You like Wendy making the calls,  but you don&#39;t want to be quite eating out of a dog dish. <br />
<br />
That&#39;s when you find Sexual Abilities. You can&#39;t click that one fast enough. Already selected are No gag reflex,  milking orgasms,  non-fertile, non-milk producing,  and heightened orgasms. Wendy takes the mouse and selects milk producing and smiles richly at you. &quot;I need more calcium.&quot;<br />
<br />
You select heightened orgasms and realize that it goes up and down on a sliding scale. You are at 70%.  90% and higher are in red and 10% and lower are also in red.   You slide it up to 85%.<br />
<br />
You also look through other options,  but aside from some confusing ones there aren&#39;t really any the appeal to you. <br />
<br />
Menstrual Cycle is the next you click on.   You turn it off without a thought.  You love the way your body feels,  the amazing new sex it provides,  and can&#39;t wait to go into public,  but some things you&#39;re not up for. <br />
<br />
You click submit and apply charges.  You feel the heart in your pussy immediately as a camel toe develops and your pussy canal deepens. The shifting alone brings on a small orgasm that you try to breathe through a your panties moisten with your sudden flood of cum. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,  I think I&#39;m gonna love that 85% change in you honey.&quot; Wendy says as she leans in to hold you. <br />
<br />
The 3 section of the contract is now filled out with all of the recent updates. <br />
<br />
Section 4 says pretty much what Wendy has told you from her conversation with Jack and Jen.   Basically,  unless someone has been to Pleasure Island or states that they have an interest that could be provided by the island then you can never speak of the island, what it did for you or your spouse,  or what it is capable of doing. It also says that you can never conspire against the island or assist any person that would wish harm to the island. <br />
<br />
Then there is the list for Amendment A The Spouse&#39;s.  The only thing that it says is &quot;Currently unavailable due to stipulation 1B. Items will be made available as items are revealed to the contracted member.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wendy reads this portion over your shoulder and smiles.  &quot;Well,  I guess that&#39;s my queue. If better get started.&quot;  She told to the other system and begins typing. <br />
<br />
&quot;What all options are available?&quot; you ask. <br />
<br />
&quot;It actually looks like all of the ones that we just went through. I can change anything that you were just able to set. Oh,  the power.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Just remember,  I&#39;ll be able to repay that favor for you the next time we come. And if it&#39;s too bad,  then I might be tempted to raise the stakes.&quot; Is the only threat that you can think to give her. <br />
<br />
Her constant clicking and typing goes on and on.   &quot;What are you doing? Are you done yet? Please don&#39;t make me a furry.  Am I going to die?&quot; All questions and statements that you keep putting out there.   And then you can tell she&#39;s frustrated with you. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know what?&quot; She looks back at the monitor,  a couple of clicks and she looks back at you.   &quot;Apply.&quot;  As she says it she clicks the mouse.   Suddenly your feeling really bad for harassing her.  You feel terrible that you&#39;ve unconvinced her. <br />
<br />
She stands and says &quot;Come.&quot; You practically fall over yourself trying to follow her to the bedroom.   &quot;Do you want to make me happy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More than anything.&quot; A small alarm bell goes off somewhere deep down but your need to make her happy is to strong. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lie down on the bed.   In the middle.   Face up.&quot;  Your already there repositioning as she specifies each order.  She did around in the doing bag and finds what she&#39;s after. &quot;Eyes closed.&quot; Nothing but darkness.  You feel her tie of your hands and feet to the corners of the bed. &quot;You can own your eyes now.&quot;  She puts a gag ball in your mouth. Then slides a vibrator into your thong. <br />
<br />
Amazing bliss ensues. &quot;I want you to not cum until I tell you to.&quot;  You have to stop the release that&#39;s already built up. Oh God this feels so good.  Your pussy is throbbing and your doing just what master wants by not cumming until she demands it.</p>
