<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Willow meant well at least, but unfortunately she had 0 clue how to get you off with her mouth. She just couldn&#39;t do the right stuff when it mattered. You didn&#39;t blame her though, as this likely is the first time she has ever had the chance to try. And making a succubus cum is by no means an easy task. You stopped her futile licking after a few minutes so that you both would not miss your exam. <br />
<br />
Leaving the car in the parking lot, you both just fly over to school. Turns out using your wings to fly is really easy, as apparently you now weighed less than 10 pounds somehow. Willow was even lighter than you were, nearly weightless even. But neither of you could have expected what is about to happen the moment you see the school. <br />
<br />
And that is absolutely everyone, from the teachers to the students, are perfectly normal. It is literally just the two of you that have changed, unless the rest are just really good at hiding it. But even you doubted that the moment you began receiving extremely odd looks. You way more than Willow too. Like a magnet, the moment you come into their view, everyone&#39;s in sight has their gazes seemingly literally pulled right to you. &#39;I know I have become extremely hot, but even this is a bit too much focus.&#39; You think to yourself while you frantically attempt to fix your hair and make sure your clothes are on just right. It is unfortunate that you have to go barefoot, but you doubt that there is a shoe that could fit your physical requirements in the entire school at the moment.<br />
<br />
As you thought, it is really, really uncomfortable being here, looking like this. Thankfully no one has yet realized who you were quite yet besides Willow. Speaking of which, that bitch seems to have used you as a distraction and flew off to somewhere the moment you entered the school. You will have to remember that later. Maybe charming her was no longer such a bad idea...<br />
<br />
Unfortunately this is only the beginning as the moment you land you are given some space thanks to your wings making a pretty wide clearing. But of course this is only for a brief moment because who else but the biggest asshole in your grade approaches you instantly. He even makes sure to get in real close to you too. Somehow you instinctivly know this guy is a super quick shot and will cum almost instantly if he is given even the slightest inkling of pleasure. You almost feel a bit bad for him. He is going to be almost too easy to handle. The moment he is right up in your face you lean in and whisper into his ear while you use your index finger to simply swipe slowly upwards on his pants where his cock is. &quot;If you can last longer than 20 seconds, then I will... Oops, well, it seems like its not happening. See ya.&quot; And easily walk past him. The guy is just standing there, frozen stiff from the shock of what just happened to him.<br />
<br />
The next person to stop you was actually more than expected. You were immediately called into the school office by the Vice Principal. And you obediently follow, hoping to get this all over with before your exam starts. When you enter the office, you notice the familiar pink hair and wings of the person already in one of the chairs and smack her lightly on the head. &quot;That&#39;s for ditching me, asshole.&quot; Willow rubs the back of her head with a sad look on her face. But she doesn&#39;t say anything as she knew that she deserved it. She had in fact ditched you intentionally after using you as a distraction. But was caught by the VP all the same.<br />
<br />
The VP takes a seat at his desk and clears his throat before picking up a piece of paper which he begins reading from. &quot;Ok lets see, one pink haired girl who comes off as being a bit childish and speaks in a notable dialect&quot; he looks up at Willow. &quot;What? Is there like, something wrong with my hair? Gewn, did you like, do something to me?&quot; She says. &quot;Shut it!&quot; Says the VP sternly, then he continues &quot;Check. And one light blue haired girl with abnormally large... ahem, right. Check.&quot; He didn&#39;t even look at you, but you already knew why. &quot;Alright, I assume you both are Willow and Gwen, or formally  William and Greg respectively?&quot; You both nod at his question. You were shocked as to how smoothly this was actually going, but made damn sure you never looked directly into his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;When I recieved 2 phone calls this morning, I admit that I did have my doubts, but clearly there is something going on here that is well beyond my knowledge. Therefore I am waving both of your exams at this moment and will work to set a date for you to reschedule. However, given what seems like your more, recent additions, I am handing you over to the nurse for a quick checkup. So if you both could follow me please.&quot; <br />
<br />
You both are escorted out of the office and through the staff only hallway connecting most of the faculty rooms together into the nurses room. &quot;Here they are Ms. Cree, Willow and Gwendolyn. Although now with a bit more alterations as well.&quot; Announces the VP before leaving the room. Ms. Cree was the school nurse, who also was one of the youngest staff members at only 25 years old. Apparently she was a bit off according to one of your friends though. After a few seconds a woman walks into view.</p>
