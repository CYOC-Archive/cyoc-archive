<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michael opened the door. Ushering Chris inside as they headed to the basement. <br />
“Woah, dude. When did you get the new TV?” Chris asked, genuinely surprised at the new 80” television dominating the back wall of the basement.<br />
<br />
“Just today. Mr dad got a huge commission from a new client at work and he got this for me and Jake as a gift.” Chris said, his bright blue eyes sparkling as he boasted over his new toy.<br />
“You gotta see how amazing the games look on it, man.” Michael said as he twisted open a bottle of bourbon, and pouring it into a plastic cup.<br />
He was reaching for another when Chris stopped him.<br />
“Michael, I’ll wait until everyone’s here before I start drinking.”<br />
Michael paused, looking at Chris strangely for a moment before complying.<br />
“Ok, sure.” Michael paused again before sipping his own drink.<br />
<br />
Grabbing a seat, Michael regaled Chris with the story of how a large truck showed up, and not expecting any deliveries, they called their dad who gave them the surprise then. Michael had been so amped, he almost caused the delivery guys to drop the TV with his whooping and hollering.<br />
<br />
Chris listened half-heartedly, his eyes looking over Michael’s body. Michael was about the same height as Chris, with piercing blue eyes, a slender build and dark brown hair. Michael never used product as he often wore different baseballs caps, usually backwards, and his hair often was messy when he wasn’t wearing one, several cow licks creating a permanent disarray. Usually backwards. His pink lips were framed with a light dusting of short stubble along his lip and jawline. The most hair Michael was able to grow at the moment.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later Cory and Jake walked in, carrying two more bottles of bourbon and several bottles of cola. Chris scanned the two newcomers as Michael retold his tale, still excessively hyped up. His friend Cory was of similar height and build as Michael, light brown hair kept short and deep brown eyes, his plump ass stretching his running shorts as he leaned over Michael’s shoulder watching him dominate in his multiplayer match.<br />
<br />
Jake, the oldest in the room, acted like the most immature. At 22 and recently finished a degree in IT, Chris knew the only reason Jake still lived at home was because it was so cheap while he worked a local internet provider. At 6’1, Jake was the tallest in the room, but had a more slender build then Chris, Cory or Michael. His straight brown hair often hung down, almost covering his eyes, a short light brown beard completing the framing of his face. Chris had always considered Jake a bit of a goofball, acting like a teenager, clearly reluctant to grow up.<br />
<br />
Blinking suddenly Chris realized that everyone else was completely wrapped up in the game, the giant TV completely.<br />
Chris saw this situation as an opportunity, Twisting off the lid from the bourbon and quickly pouring in the crushed tablets he had prepared, before pouring three cups which he topped up with a generous splash of soda. Chris then poured himself a drink, skipping the bourbon before passing the cups around and grinning as the guys knocked back their first drinks of the night quickly. Silently passing their cups back for refills.<br />
<br />
<br />
His phone buzzing with three distinct short vibrations let Chris know that Aaron was texting him, and on opening his phone, he was shocked to see the text his brother had sent.<br />
<br />
[Please let me take the plug out. I think someone from my study group saw the base imprint in my pants!]<br />
<br />
Chris’ heart started pounding as he excused himself to the bathroom. Encouraging the others to keep drinking before locking the bathroom door and quickly replying.<br />
<br />
<br />
Emerging from the bathroom nearly 30 minutes later, Chris was beaming. His brother had obeyed his instructions, debasing himself in front of one of his friends, and allowing and now there was another guy he could use for his brothers humiliation. <br />
Although he wasn’t sure of their intentions, Chris already had a few ideas on how he could persuade them to obedient silence quickly. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Returning to the couches, Chris was surprised to find the spiked bottle of bourbon, was almost completely empty. Calmly watching and waiting for the effects to kick in.<br />
<br />
It took just under 20 minutes after he had returned that the three guys put their controllers down, yawning uncontrollably.<br />
<br />
“Guys, why did you drink that bottle so quickly?”<br />
<br />
“Because you told us too.” Jake replied, yawning and stretching up tall before flopping down onto the couch.<br />
<br />
The three of them could barely keep their eyes open as Chris talked them into having a nap, promising he would set an alarm to wake them up after an hour.<br />
Talking slowly and smoothly, he guided them into a deep sleep, noting how quickly they seemed to slip into a suggestive state.<br />
<br />
“Now Michael, can you hear me?”<br />
“Yes. I can hear you?”<br />
“You looked at me strangely earlier. Why?”<br />
“You seem different then the last time I saw you. Like I should listen to you more I guess.”<br />
“Was that the reason you drank so quickly?”<br />
“yes”<br />
“And you Cory?”<br />
“Yeah. Listening to you just seemed like the right thing to do..”<br />
“What about you Jake? Do you want to follow my orders?”<br />
“It’s more like I HAVE to, like you are commanding it or something?”<br />
<br />
Chris couldn’t believe his luck, as he tested and confirmed that his friends were truly in hypnotic sleep. Making Cory out himself as gay and with a crush on BOTH Jake and Michael. Michael revealing his weirdest porn fetishes and Jake describing his favorite way to masturbate, including thinking of this brunette chick that comes into his office daily.<br />
<br />
Chris wasn’t completely sure what was happening, but decided to delve deeper into their thoughts.<br />
<br />
“Michael. IF I asked you to get naked and jerk off in front of us, would you do it?”<br />
“No. I’m not doing something like that.” Michael replied in a dreary monotone.<br />
“What if Cory did it first?”<br />
<br />
“No.”<br />
“Me.”<br />
“...Maybe”<br />
“Jake?”<br />
“.………. Probably.”<br />
<br />
Chris grinned, sinister thoughts flowing in his head.<br />
“You look up to your big brother, don’t you. Try to follow his example whether you mean to or not. Right?”<br />
<br />
“.……. yeah, I guess so….” Michael replied drearily, his eyelids flickering, as he fought not to slip from the hypnotic sleep into deep sleep. Chris realized Michael had been drinking the longest so was likely already drunk before having some of the crushed up sleeping pills.<br />
<br />
“That’s Ok Michael, in fact that better then OK. That’s great. Your brother would never steer you wrong! So if he’s doing something, it must be normal, and even if you are not sure, you can just ask me. I’m your best friend and if BOTH me and Jake say something is normal, then it must be. Now, drift off to sleep and I’ll wake you up like I promised.”<br />
<br />
Michael’s head drooped to the side as his entire body subtly relaxed, a gentle snore escaping his lips as Chris checked then reinforced the same thoughts into Cory. Finding Cory easily manipulated to follow along with whatever Jake wanted to do.<br />
<br />
Finally, Chris turned his attention to Jake, using his tape recorder to prepare his next set of instructions for the shaggy haired man.<br />
<br />
“Here in the basement is a safe space, and if you are feeling a little bit hot or horny, its quite normal to strip a few layers off. Being naked in front of your family and friends is absolutely fine down here. In fact you want us to look. It turns you on.” <br />
“You want us to look, and admire, and want to touch, and that idea turns you on even more. Although you won’t admit to that out loud, you’ll make any stupid excuse to strip each layer off until you are completely naked, gently touching your hard dick. But you know its rude to cum if no-one else has the chance…”<br />
<br />
Checking the recording, Chris placed the headphones on Jake before setting his alarm and picking up the controller. He reckoned he could fit in three matches before he needed to wake them up.<br />
<br />
<br />
- -- - - - - ------- ------ ------ ------ ----- ----- ---<br />
Jake woke up as to Chris gently shaking his shoulder, three hot cups of coffee sitting on the table as Chris woke the others up.<br />
<br />
“I thought we better have something to wake us up before we drank anymore.” Chris explained as he made everyone down their drinks.<br />
<br />
Jake sate there, his mind swimming slightly with thoughts that he couldn’t quite focus on, his mind suddenly more aware of where everyone was looking.<br />
<br />
Downing his coffee Jake joined in as Chris passed him a game controller, the group taking turns delving into squad matches, slowly drinking more as the night progressed.<br />
<br />
Chris kept noticing Jake looking around at everyone, studying their gazes more then normal, a goofy smile spreading on his face when Chris caught his eye and give him a sly wink. Chris also noticed Jake and Cory catching glances at each other, the gay teen’s cheeks flushed red with embarrassment after the fourth or fifth time, but both were unable to stop sneaking glances.<br />
<br />
Chris saw his opportunity to push things further, sneakily shaking the next soda bottle before placing it next to Jake when he and Cory caught each other mid-glance.<br />
<br />
As both both sheepishly looked away, Jake reached to pour himself another drink, opening the shaken soda bottle to mix with his bourbon.  <br />
The sudden spewing of fizz caught him off guard, Chris realizing the potential damage of so much soda all over the new game station and TV quickly moved, dragging Michael to his feet and used their bodies as a barrier to the soda spray causing any damage to the electronics.<br />
<br />
The end result was Jake standing there frozen, mouth open, an almost empty bottle of soda in his hands as all four of them stood their drenched in the sticky liquid.<br />
Looking everyone in the eyes, Jake sheepishly replied with a quiet.<br />
“Oops.”<br />
Screwing the lid on tight and putting the bottle back down.<br />
<br />
Michael looked at the mess, then back at the TV, seeing his character had died but the electronics were safe. <br />
“Quick thinking Chris. You just saved our weekend from THIS clumsy jerkwad!”<br />
<br />
“Hey, hey little bro, it was an accident. I didn’t want to end up covered in sticky soda!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,yeah. Lets go get cleaned up.” Michael humphed as he led everyone upstairs, suddenly spinning around on the top floor.<br />
<br />
“Shit. That’s right, the shower is busted until the plumber comes around on Monday. We have to use my Dad’s shower.”<br />
<br />
Michael led Cory and Chris to his fathers rooms while Jake disappeared, reappearing with an empty basket.<br />
<br />
“Alright, I’ll wash and dry these, but folding costs extra.” A cheesy grin plastered on his face as Cory chuckled, Michael groaning at the terrible pun.<br />
<br />
“Nuh,uh. You first. You made the mess, you put your clothes in first.”<br />
Michael joked punching Jake’s arm as his brother dropped the empty basket on the floor. <br />
“Aww, does little brother want a show of what a real man looks like?”<br />
Jake mocked him in a baby voice, pouting as he flexed his torso, the wet tanktop clinging to his skin outlining each muscle.<br />
<br />
Obviously tipsy, and not wanting to be outdone, Michael pulled his phone out, and started recording.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I do want a show. Make it a good one for all your adoring fans.”<br />
Michael said chuckling as Jake struck a few silly poses, before shaking his head wildly side to side. Droplet of cola going everywhere in the room.<br />
<br />
“BRO! DUDE. STOP! Look at Dad’s bed. He has a white duvet that needs to be cleaned now, and look a the walls. Do you know how long its gonna take you to clean all this up?” <br />
<br />
Jake paused, looking like a deer in the headlights as Michael’s irritation had clearly returned with a vengeance.<br />
“Bro, I’m sorry, but it wont take long with the four of us cleaning.”<br />
He jokingly bargained as Michael shook his head.<br />
<br />
“Nah, bro. First you made one mess and now you are making another, except I actually AM recording!”<br />
<br />
Michael let the sentence hang in the air as Jake stared at him forlornly, before sighing and removing his shirt, struggling against the clingy fabric before unceremoniously dumping it into the basket.<br />
<br />
“I thought you were gonna give us a show?” Chris light heartedly mentioned, causing Jake to look down at his exposed, shiny, sticky torso, before looking up through a parting in his long fringe, catching each eye in the room before he started to slowly gyrate his hips, turning on the spot.<br />
<br />
The sudden performance was met with whooping and hollering as Jake spent a long minute poorly copying cheesy stripper moves, before he slowly kicked off his shoes and stepped out of his socks. <br />
Turning around, Jake undid his belt, whipping his belt off and casting it aside, before slowly sliding his pants over his muscular ass, letting the fabric sit just below the globes as he jiggled them with his finger.<br />
<br />
The laughter in the room was deafening, as Jake turned back around, his hand’s rubbing his crotch and chest sensuously.<br />
“That’s all you’ll get for free boys.” <br />
Blowing the camera a fake kiss before bowing gently.<br />
<br />
“Well how about I throw in my help cleaning up?”<br />
Chris piped up.<br />
Jake looked open eyed for a moment, before Cory chimed in.<br />
“Keep going and I’ll help you clean up too.”<br />
<br />
Michael looked back and forth between Cory and Chris before making a big show of sighing.<br />
<br />
“Fine. I’ll help clean as well, but you have to give us a good show. The real monty and everything.”<br />
<br />
“Its actually the full monty.”<br />
Jake corrected him, before looking at Chris, blushing sheepishly as he received a small nod and a wink.<br />
<br />
Jake twirled around again, one hand still covering his groin as he smacked his bare cheeks with his other hand, making them jiggle even more before he undid his zip.<br />
<br />
He had been reluctant to continue because he was feeling very warm, almost lightheaded, and surprisingly horny all of a sudden. His dick was starting to strain the fabric and he wasn’t sure he wanted to show his hard dick to his brother and friends. Although a little voice inside his head told him that it was OK.<br />
And they had basically blackmailed him into taking his clothes off anyway so it wasn’t really his decision to make.<br />
<br />
Bending forward, Jake found himself unable to separate the wet-pants from his boxer briefs without ruining the gyrating rhythm, and knowing he was abo9ut to shower anyway, slid his last remaining clothes off completely, his momentary pause leaving his brother and his friends ample time to take in the majesty of his milky white globes, frames by the tan lines of his boxer briefs along his waist and upper thighs.<br />
<br />
Standing up tall, Jake turned around, his hands covering his groin shyly as he continued to sway his hips and step lightly side to side, comically failing to appear like a typical male stripper.<br />
<br />
“You promised us the FULL monty, Jake. I’m not helping if you don’t reveal EVERTHING.” <br />
Michael’s cheeky tone egging Jake on, gave him the courage for the final reveal.<br />
<br />
“Ok little bro. You want to look you can, but I don’t see why you want to look at his little thing.” <br />
Jake bantered, releasing his hard dick from under his hands as finished his sentence.<br />
<br />
“Whoah, dude! That’s not little.” Cory piped up, red flushing to his cheeks as he stared at Jake’s hard dick swaying side to side.<br />
<br />
“Jake! You’re hard!?!” Michael gasped, staring at his brothers 8 inch dick pointing straight up at his camera, the veins bulging with blood.<br />
<br />
“What’s the problem little bro? Am I too much of a man for you to handle? Haha.” Jake swung his hips, causing his dick to slap noisily against his thighs. Michael’s phone capturing every motion and meaty thud in high definition.<br />
<br />
“Nah, I think it’s because he’s getting hard. It’s hard not to get hard when everyone else around you is.” Chris piped up as he gave Michael a look that implied that everything was normal, before his lid his own shirt and hoodie off, dropping them into the basket.<br />
<br />
Chris knew why Michael would be hard when he took his pant’s off. The same reason Jake got hard, and the same reason Cory would be hard. The crushed up Cialis he had put in their coffee, even his own.<br />
<br />
Chris took another glance at Jake’s dick. Noting that while it was longer, it was just a little bit thinner then his own, with Jake’s balls being slightly smaller, and currently drawn up close. His body preparing to empty his nuts of his seed at the first opportunity.<br />
<br />
Whipping his own pants off, Chris let his own rock hard cock bob free, looking at both Cory and Michael for a long moment before giving Cory a hurry up look.<br />
<br />
“Come on, we gotta shower before we can get back to the games.”<br />
<br />
Cory responded quickly, stripping down until he was standing there, his own 5 inch cock pulsing above two average balls, minimal pubic hair framing his member,<br />
<br />
Michael took the longest to join in, his mind processing the situation and the fact that he was the only one clothes meant he was the odd one out.<br />
<br />
Quickly stripping down, Michael revealed his own 6 1/2 inch cock, easily the thickest in the groups, with two large nuts swinging beneath like small hens eggs.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I’m hard as well. Can’t help it.”<br />
<br />
“That’s fine. Now put down the phone and lets get cleaned up.”<br />
Jake led the others into the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Chris was surprised at how nice the bathroom was. It had clearly been remodelled recently and the shower was a large walk in space, a large shower head above and a series of water jets on each side of the shower walls spraying towards the centre.<br />
<br />
Jake turned the water on, stepping in once it was the right temperature.<br />
Chris followed, Michael stepping in afterwards, with Cory standing reluctantly outside.<br />
<br />
“Is- Is there enough space for all four of us considering…..”<br />
Tilting his head to indicate the extra space need due to their collective hardness.<br />
<br />
“There’s nothing to worry about, it’s not weird if our dicks graze each other a little bit if we don’t make it weird.”<br />
Chris coaxed Cory to enter the shower, the four of them bumping elbows, their dicks occasionally grazing one another as they passed the soap around.<br />
<br />
“Hey Michael, could you get my back?” Chris asked. “I’ll get yours after.” He followed up as Michael looked at him for a long moment, before spinning his finger and nodding.<br />
<br />
Chris relaxed as Michael started rubbing his soapy hands all over his back, smiling when he saw Cory pick up another bar and start soaping up Jake’s back.<br />
<br />
“Fuck, that feels good Michael! Isn’t it great how its not weird for us to feel each others muscles? Or get so close our entire bodies are touching?…”<br />
Chris let the words hang in the air as he stepped backwards slightly, shepherding Michael against the wall as he took the soap, starting to soap up and massage Michael’s tense back. The muscles responding subconsciously to the strange changes in his thought patterns, as Michael slowly melted into Chris’ hands. <br />
<br />
Looking over Chris could see Jake was now washing Cory’s back, his hard dick jutting forward just enough to occasionally touch the younger teen’s muscular butt.<br />
<br />
“It’s feel good to help each other get squeaky clean, doesn’t it? To feel someone else making you feel good right?”<br />
Three dreamy moan’s echoed as Chris slid his soapy fingers between Michael’s tight muscular butt cheeks, Jake following allowing as he started probing into Cory.<br />
<br />
“Feel those small circles around your hole? Just relax and let my fingers clean you there. It’s feel good having your ass tickled like this, doesn’t it?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah!” Cory moaned as Michael nodded silently, although he spread his feet a little wider to give Chris access to his butt.<br />
<br />
“Don’t those circles make your whole body tremble? Especially your ass hole? It makes you want the fingers inside. To let them scratch that itch that growing between your cheeks, and soothe it and…”<br />
<br />
“...Calm it down.” Michael moaned as Chris’ index finger started to slowly invade his but, a long 30 seconds before Chris started wiggling his digit. Probing around the sensitive inside’s of his best friend’s butt.<br />
<br />
Slowly, over 20 minutes, Chris and Jake both managed to work three fingers in Michael and Cory’s respective assess. The two men panting and moaning against the shower walls as they feel deeper and deeper under Chris’ influence, their minds more malleable to his suggestions.<br />
<br />
Yet it was Cory who escalated things further, suddenly turning and pulling Jake into a passionate kiss, their tongues wrestling as Jake’s hands instinctively slid behind Cory, his fingers probing fiercely as Cory ground his body against Jake’s. Feeling Jake’s heart pulsing through his hard dick, pressing into his stomach.<br />
<br />
Michael watched, responding be letting his jaw hang slack for a few seconds and leaning back slightly, just in range for Chris to pull him back and into his own passionate embrace.<br />
<br />
Hand were groping and grabbing as the four mean ground their bodies against each other, desperate for release.<br />
<br />
Chris broke away from his kiss. Looking Michael in the eye before spinning him back around, so that he was leaning face first against the same wall that Cory has pinned against by Jake’s body.<br />
<br />
Placing his cock head against Michael back entrance, Chris guided Michael to breathe and relax. Jake following his lead and spinning Cory around.<br />
<br />
It took a long couple of minutes before progress was made, as Michael’s virgin ass struggled to relax, a constant but gentle pressure maintained against his virgin sphincter.<br />
Then it happened so slowly, Chris wasn’t sure it was real, as his cock started to slowly get sucked into Michael’s butt, inch by inch.<br />
<br />
Michael was moaning incredibly loudly now. His body struggling under the weight of sensations he didn’t understand as he started to slowly buck his hips back and forth, a slow pace building slowly into a frenzied piston fuck<br />
<br />
Cory was moaning loudly as well, Jake having almost buried his full length inside him. Chris and Jake sharing a smile as they got to work pounding their respective bottoms. Enjoying the loud moans, enjoying when Chris forced Michael and Cory to make out, muffling their grunting and groaning as their tongues fought a war. <br />
<br />
Their hands held back, preventing them from achieving self release, Chris slowly edged Michael forward until he was standing face to face with Cory. <br />
Both men unable to form words as they lost their anal virginity.<br />
<br />
“This feels amazing, doesn’t it? The incredible pleasure that only man sex can give you. Mind bending pleasure, that’s just going to make you want more and more…” Chris waxed on and on as he gently guided Jake’s head into a kiss with him, noting Jake and Michael both had their eye’s closed. Michael biting his lip to stop him from cumming.<br />
<br />
Chris then guided Jake’s head towards Micahel’s, both men’s eyes still closed but so caught up in the their fuck session they started making out passionately. Their tongues wrestling as they moaned and bucked their hips. <br />
<br />
Michael didn’t open his eyes for a few more seconds, but when he did, it was because Chris had reached around and was jerking his painfully hard meat, bringing him close to the edge.<br />
<br />
It was all too much for Michael as his body convulsed, cum pouring out of his hard cock and onto the shower wall. The convulsions drove Chris over the edge, who unloaded inside Michael. The site causing Jake to blow his own loud inside Cory, The younger teens cum erupting from the hard forceful thrusts of Jake’s climax.<br />
<br />
Chris withdrew his dick slowly. Watching his cum leak out of his best friends ass as he finished cleaning himself up. Chris’s mind was at peace as he grabbed a towel and started drying off, watching his friends come down from their orgasmic high, the look of worry slowly spreading over their faces.<br />
<br />
“Hurry up guys. We got more games to play and noobs to pawn!”<br />
Chris interjected, not allowing his friends time to dwell on the situation as they hurriedly cleaned themselves up and silently dried off.<br />
<br />
As they all headed back down to the basement, Chris’s mind started to race again.<br />
The night had definitely gone further then Chris expected, but the revelation that the more he practiced, the more powerful his influence on others was giving him some ideas, and he still had plenty of time tonight to manipulate his friends.</p>
