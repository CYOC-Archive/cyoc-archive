<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That night, Sean found it difficult to sleep. He was so excited by the fact that his fantasies were becoming a reality.His height had jumped to 5'4, while Jay 5'8 and Dean 5'10 were slowly making their decent down to the smaller world.<br />
<br />
The next morning, Sean awoke to a loud noise. Both boys were never very quiet when moving around. He only got up in time to see them leaving though the door. They had some camping equipment and back packs on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are you guys going?&quot; he asked, still rubbing his eyes in an attempt to see better. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's the weekend shrimp!&quot; replied Jay. &quot;You didn't think we were planning on spending that time with you now. We'll see you tomorrow afternoon.&quot;<br />
<br />
As they left the room, Sean was delighted. He knew the difference between him and the boys would be more dramatic in two more days. He was already growing impatient waiting for the twenty-four hour cycle to recommence. It had been about four o'clock when the first of the changes occurred. <br />
<br />
Sean went shopping thought the day in an attempt to get his mind off what had been happening to him. But as he tried on new clothes, it reminded him on the next changes to occur. He decided to buy his first size Large shirt. Although it was still incredibly big on him, he knew it wouldn't be in a few days.<br />
<br />
Finally it was 3:55pm and Sean was sitting at his study desk watching each minute pass by. It seemed the longer he sat there, the slower time moved. <br />
<br />
3:59, &quot;Almost there,&quot; he stood up so that he was positioned in front of the mirror. He put on the clothes that he had been wearing the day before, so that he could feel the changes again. 4:00 and nothing yet, although he knew it was fast approaching. 4:01. Still nothing. He had his first doubts. Maybe it wont happen when suddenly he felt it. Again it was that stretching sensation all over his body as he begun to shoot up-wards. He clothing, already tight before the transformation became very uncomfortable. Every slope in his body was evident. He could see his growing definition through his t-shirt. As the growth process came to a halt again, he begun to admire his body. He couldn't believe how big he felt. Although he was still only 5'6, 4 inches in two days to anyone would make a notable difference. <br />
<br />
He had some difficulty removing his shirt today. When it eventually came off, what he saw in front of him was a complete surprise. His chest was now visible. His six pack was starting to show through his skin. Suddenly a wicked smile came across his face as he remembered what exactly was happening to the boys out camping.<br />
*********************************************************************<br />
Jay was collecting the firewood when he felt the strange feeling again. It only lasted a few seconds, but after-wards he felt a little weak. It was strange though, as he had the same feeling the day before. He quickly got his bearings back when he realised that his load of firewood in his arms was a little too heavy and he put a bit back down before making his way back to the campsite. As he was walking back, he noticed that his shoes seemed a little loose. He had worn his nike cross-trainers for suck a long time his imprint was left in the shoes and somehow, they just didn't seem to fit right. <br />
<br />
As he dropped the pile of wood down, he walked over to Dan to tell him what had happened,<br />
&quot;Dam, man. I had this strange feeling just now. I felt all dizzy and stuff. That's the second time in two days man. I think i'll have to see the doctor when i get back.&quot; <br />
&quot;Are you serious. I've had the same feeling too. It must be those protein shakes we've been taking.&quot; <br />
Without even giving it another thought, they continued with their outback adventures.<br />
<br />
<br />
*********************************************************************<br />
The next morning couldn't have come any sooner. He had a renewed vigor and a spring in his step that day. He didn't feel insignificant and unimportant. And he couldn't wait for his next change that afternoon. On his desk, he turned on the Chrioniac again to monitor the progress so far. His new stats were 5'6, while Jay was 5'7 and Sean 5'9. He knew that after todays change, they would be seeing Sean in a new light (and a new height).<br />
<br />
Again, Sean found it difficult to keep himself occupied that day. As the minutes rolled past, he could stop thinking of what was soon to happen and the looks on the boys faces when the see him. <br />
<br />
4:02 finally came and the change was in progress. He had put on the same clothes he'd been wearing the last two days. He wanted to see them stretch as far as they could possibly go. His clothes became tighter and tighter. The shirt was looking ridiculously small on him now. The size Small now was exposing his belly button and his chest was becoming far too wide for it to leave much room. He felt huge. He felt like a real man. His legs was much wider and his underwear were now impossibly small. Once the change was complete he looked at the changes in the mirror. He was pleased with himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;the only thing missing,&quot; he said to himself &quot;are my shoes.&quot; Sean was not much of a shoe man, but today was an exception. He found his old size 7 sneakers that use to fit him nicely. Now, they were way too small. He tried a pair of Jay's size 10's and they fir perfectly. While he was there, he took a pair of his shorts and put on one of his t-shirts too. <br />
<br />
He sat on the couch and waited watching tv. He couldn't wait for tonight.</p>
