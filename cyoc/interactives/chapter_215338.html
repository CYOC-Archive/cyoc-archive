<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Caleb waddled into the room and froze.<br />
<br />
In the center of the room was the man with the well-groomed beard from earlier. He was big, burly, with a gut that stretched his shirt taught, though his muscles were a close second in size. The man was incredibly handsome, his eyes a piercing steel gray. In his mouth was a half-smoked Cuban cigar, the smoke sickly sweet and filling the room.<br />
<br />
Steve was on his knees in front of the biker, face slack, bobbing on the man’s big, veiny cock. At least, Caleb thought it was Steve. Earlier tonight, Steve’s body had been twinklike and boyish, but now his body was thick with muscle and fat. That foam belly was touching the tile floor, wobbling realistically. Steve’s skin was hairy, darkly tanned, and covered in tats Caleb could barely make out. His beard was much fuller than the stringy fake one he’d been wearing earlier.<br />
<br />
The man glanced over at the door and pulled his cock out of Steve’s mouth.<br />
<br />
“Hey there Caleb,” The man smirked, moving his cock around as Steve desperately attempted to suck it again, smearing precum all over his weather-beaten face. “I found your friend Steve.”<br />
<br />
“W-what’s going on?” Caleb asked in a much deeper voice than he remembered having, his Southern accent growing more pronounced, “Steve?”<br />
<br />
“Steve’s preoccupied right now,” The man finally let Steve swallow his fat veiny shaft and the tubby bear started bobbing again. He gave Caleb a devilish grin, “But you can eat out my hole if you want.”<br />
<br />
The man’s steel eyes glittered and Caleb found himself stumbling forward, his big belly wobbling as he went. His grin widened as Caleb waddled towards him, and he let his pants drop, exposing his big, hairy ass. Caleb sank to his knees behind the burly bear, staring at his wide, furry butt.<br />
<br />
“There we go, piggy,” The man puffed some smoke into Caleb’s face, making him cough, and bent over, “Just relax and clean my ass with that tongue of yours.”<br />
<br />
Caleb moaned as more of that sweet smoke filled his lungs. His hands-which were much puffier than he recalled-reached up and spread those cheeks wide, revealing a sweaty pucker. Deep, masculine musk wafted from the man’s hole, the odor deep and pungent. His mouth watered. It was the asshole of a real man.<br />
<br />
He leaned forward and licked the big man’s moist ring. The muscles twitched under his tongue, the flavor reminding him of organ meat. Caleb found that it wasn’t bad - tasty, actually, and licked deeper, the ring flexing under his tender ministrations. He began rimming the bear properly, slicking the hair around the man’s hole with saliva.<br />
<br />
“Good piggy,” The man moaned, placing a hand on top of Caleb’s bald head, firmly pressing his face deeper.<br />
<br />
Caleb’s cock was rock hard as he at the man out. He kissed the pucker with his rubbery lips, jowls wobbling. That quivering hole was his whole world, and he loved it. The savory taste and masculine scent was everything. Above him, the man moaned again as he dove back into his asshole with gusto. His hand rubbed Caleb’s bald head, scritching him behind the ears.<br />
<br />
That was wrong, though. He couldn’t feel his hair under the bald cap. Actually, it was strange that he could even feel the hand so intensely, almost like it was his real skin. But… was it really so bad? Brent had said he looked good bald. There wasn’t anything wrong with it.<br />
<br />
“That’s right, there’s nothing wrong with it,” The man said as though he could read Caleb’s mind, “You’re a very hot piggy. Be proud.”<br />
<br />
Caleb moaned, tongue probing deeper past the rim of the man’s asshole. The man continued to rub his bare scalp, and he actually felt pride blossom in his sizeable bosom. Caleb felt hot lust seize him and lost himself in eating out the biker’s ass. His tongue lapped deeper and he twirled it skillfully, swallowing the earthy juices. <br />
<br />
On the other side of the burly biker, Steve was moaning and groaning happily. Caleb spared him a glanced between breaths of air. Steve was completely blissed-out, savoring that big cock, slurping down the precum as it belched forth with every lick. His eyes were half-lidded as he bobbed.<br />
<br />
Caleb let go of the biker’s cheeks, enjoying the feeling of the fat flesh on his beard. The man’s guiding hand pressed his face deep. Caleb&#39;s hands fell on his fat nipples and he began tweaking them while he sucked and licked the sweaty hole. Each tweak sent jolts of pleasure straight to his cock, precum dribbling from it down his fat thighs. <br />
<br />
It took a few moments for the realization that he shouldn’t be able to feel the costume’s nipples at all, nor the precum drooling down his thigh. A feeling of dread trickled into his much larger stomach as he rubbed his massive body and found that he could feel it all. His sagging man tits, hefty gut and even the wobble of his doublechin – everywhere his hands went, sensation followed. <br />
<br />
He paused, trying to pull his head away before the man’s hand shoved him back into his musky hole.<br />
<br />
“It’s too late for that, Caleb,” The man grunted and moaned, grinding his ass into Caleb’s face. “Just relax, I’m close. You two have been really good piggies. Let me give you your reward.”<br />
<br />
Caleb struggled, but the man’s hand was firm, rubbing circles on the top of his bald dome. It was hypnotic and relaxing and soon he was sucking and licking the man’s sweaty hole again. The man grunted, his asshole spasming around Caleb’s tongue.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, his face was free. Before Caleb could get a chance to enjoy the cool air on his sweaty face, the biker had turned around, his fat cock spurting a big wad of cum right into Caleb’s mouth. He tasted it as another spurt spattered across his face. Salty and tinged with sweetness. He swallowed eagerly, leaning forward and wrapping his lips around that fat, juicy cock.<br />
<br />
He desperately suckled another spurt from that beautiful cock, feeling the thick vein throb in his mouth. <br />
<br />
“Good piggy. Enjoy your reward,” The man smiled, his fingers massaging Caleb’s bare scalp.<br />
<br />
Caleb moaned happily, sucking down another juicy load of cum. Soon, the flow of delicious cum stopped. He went to pull off the cock, but the man’s hand gripped him firmly in place. A flow of hot, slightly acrid fluid began streaming into his mouth.<br />
<br />
He sputtered, piss splattering on his face.<br />
<br />
“Drink it all, piggy,” The man insisted, trying to force his cock back in Caleb’s mouth.<br />
<br />
Caleb lurched away, using the wall as support to heave himself up off knees that popped and ached. And it wasn’t just his knees – he felt the slight ache of a lifetime of use in every one of his joints.  But the wear and tear on his body didn’t stop him from trying to evade the man’s urine and soon he found himself in front of the sink and stopped, staring at himself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
He was staring at a complete stranger.<br />
<br />
His reflection showed a hugely obese man, at least four hundred pounds, maybe more. Fat was packed onto his body. He had massive tits that stretched his shirt tight across the chest, his nipples hard and lewdly tenting the gray fabric. His chin was like a ring around a neck he couldn’t even see, sagging down over the collar of his shirt. Reddish-brown tufts of hair sprouted from his chest and covered his arms, their length matched only by his massive beard that descended down over a huge gut that jutted forward in a wobbly sphere. <br />
<br />
Caleb’s bald head was sun burnt, as were his cheeks and the tip of his nose. All his exposed skin was burnt a bit, now that he had a proper look. He ran a hand over his head, confirming there was no hair under the bald cap. Frantically, he tried tugging the hood off, but there were no seams. His green eyes searched, but no matter how hard he looked, he couldn’t find anything even resembling the seam that had been there earlier in the night..<br />
<br />
He paused, staring at his face. <br />
<br />
There were deep lines in his forehead, and laugh lines could be seen in what little skin wasn’t covered by his thick, reddish brown beard. Like Dustin, crow’s feet crinkled his eyes, heavy bags underneath them. He looked old – just like everyone else in this misbegotten bar.. <br />
<br />
This was wrong-all wrong! <br />
<br />
He tried to back up, only to find his wide rear bump into the man behind him.<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong, piggy?” The man asked, grinning widely, his steel-gray eyes flashing. His hands roamed over Caleb’s fat body, tweaking his nipples, sending jolts of pure pleasure straight to his twitching cock. “Want me to make it all better?”<br />
<br />
Caleb moaned, letting himself be held by the man as he dipped a hand beneath his shirt and rubbed his furry gut. <br />
<br />
“You’re so fucking hot, piggy,” The man growled, nuzzling Caleb’s neck. Caleb moaned and lay his head on the man’s, staring into those glittery gray eyes, “Look at yourself. Such a big bear.”<br />
<br />
The man started lifting Caleb’s shirt, revealing more and more of Caleb’s massive paunch. Caleb wanted to stop him, but the scene in the mirror of the hot bear being fondled by the other hot biker was too much. His nipples were completely hard as the man gently tweaked them. The man’s other hand roamed the bear’s body, fondling his fat rolls. <br />
<br />
Slowly, it dawned on Caleb that HE was the hot bear in the mirror being groped by the hot biker. His cock twitched and drooled. The man’s eyes glittered again and he smiled, his hand reaching underneath Caleb’s enormous belly, caressing his nubby cock. Caleb humped his hand, desperate to cum.<br />
<br />
“There you go big guy. Such a hot piggy, aren’t you?” The man grinned, flicking the tip of Caleb’s little dick.<br />
<br />
“Ah! Ah’m so…ngh!” Caleb moaned, his accent thick, “So fucking hot, sir.”<br />
<br />
“Good piggy. Hot piggy,” The man’s eyes glittered. Caleb’s balls ached as the man’s hand fondled them, churning and swelling bigger than goose eggs. Precum drooled in a steady stream over the man’s rough hand as he massaged them. Caleb grunted, his body fur growing even thicker. <br />
<br />
“Thirsty piggy.”<br />
<br />
Caleb swallowed, mouth suddenly dry. He was thirsty for something. For moment, his mind thought of beer, but a glitter from the man’s eyes and the amber liquid shifted to something a bit saltier. Caleb’s mouth watered and he licked his lips. Yeah, the man’s piss was pretty quenching. He was so thirsty-<br />
<br />
“No!” Caleb wrenched his eyes away from the man’s and shoved him away.<br />
<br />
He stumbled towards the door to the bathroom, desperate to escape, but his momentum carried him too far. Caleb slammed into the far wall, knocking an old, framed photo askew. He stared at it, eyes taking a moment to make sense of it. <br />
<br />
It was a group photo, a bunch of guys standing proudly next to their souped-up bikes. The man was there, standing front and center, silver eyes glaring intimidatingly at the camera. Behind him were a bunch of guys that Caleb recognized from out in the bar. And then there was Brent, standing near the end of the line.<br />
<br />
He didn’t have time to count, but there were way more bikers than the 24 he’d been told there was. <br />
<br />
Looking past Brent, Caleb’s eyes fell on the hugely fat, bearded man next to him and his heart nearly stopped. It was him, grinning happily with Brent’s arm over his shoulder. Steve stood right next to him, leaning into his fat body, and Caleb’s arm was wrapped around him. His eyes fell to the inscription at the bottom of the photo:<br />
<br />
‘Heaven’s Devils 1978’.<br />
<br />
Below that was a list of names, and the first was: Tucker McCabe. It took a few more seconds, but he found his name and everyone else at the party listed there. His stomach filled with dread. <br />
<br />
A laugh boomed from behind him.<br />
<br />
“Uh-oh. Looks like piggy found the final clue,” Tucker chuckled. “You know, before I blew my brains out,I told them coppers that my bar and boys would be here forever. They really shoulda took me more seriously” <br />
<br />
Caleb turned, staring at the burly biker in horror and pointed at his name. “W-whats’ tha’ mean?”<br />
<br />
“It means welcome to the Heckfire Club, piggy.” Tucker’s devilish grin stretched his face unnaturally, revealing far too many teeth. “Better enjoy it, because when you’re in, you’re in forever.”<br />
<br />
“Fuck that!” Caleb rushed forward, trying to pull Steve away, “Come on Steve! We need to get the fuck outta here.”<br />
<br />
Steve just stared at him, eyes still unfocused.<br />
<br />
“Zonked.” Tucker explained. “Honestly, you’ve fought back harder than most. But I got forever to turn ya.” He leaned forward, “It means I win. Eventually.”<br />
<br />
“I-I don’t wanna be some fat fuckin’ biker pig!” Caleb yelled.<br />
<br />
“Doesn’t matter what you want little piggy. And newbies gotta pay their dues.”<br />
<br />
Caleb’s breath came fast and hard. He ran from the room, stumbling out into the main bar.<br />
<br />
The men were having an orgy, cocks deep in each other’s asses. Dustin was leaning over the bar while a guy railed his ass. His massive gut jiggled, beer bottles toppling, spilling their half-full contents on the bar. Caleb’s cock twitched as he watched the fat bartender get plowed, but he mustered on, making a waddling bee-line to the backdoor and freedom.<br />
<br />
Placing a chubby hand on the doorhandle, Caleb tugged with every last ounce of force that his obese body could muster. <br />
<br />
It was locked.</p>
