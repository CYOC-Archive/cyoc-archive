<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Max bent down, picking up one of the larger rocks, and striding down the hillside as the dust began to clear. Quite the shame he'd have to end <br />
things so soon with this one. He seemed to have spirit, and that always made it more fun. Sadly, he'd just have to finish him off...<br />
<br />
Just then, he noticed the unmistakable sound of a helicopter taking off. No time even to make sure then. Thinking quickly, he hurled his rock in <br />
the direction of Zack's head and immediately turned to race down the hill towards where he planned to climb the wall. Having a helicopter in <br />
the mix most definitely was not something he had planned for, but it had all worked out. He had definitely hurt a satisfying crunch when his <br />
rock connected, but there hadn't been a scream. With luck, he'd scored his kill after all, but at the very least, he'd crushed his windpipe. Either <br />
way, it would leave him unable to explain the situation, and the wonderful thing about helicopters was the way they scattered the wind <br />
outward. Between that and a few more surprises he'd prepared along this route, he was confident he had plenty of time.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Chad and the others watched in silence as the shouting huskey suddenly tore off, frozen almost, like a deer in headlights. Did she seriously <br />
think her brothers were a bunch of rapists? Bitch. Still, she didn't need the whole Order standing around laughing at her, especially with what <br />
she had to talk over with Vinny. When they planned this whole thing, he'd said he was going to rig it all so the two of them would end up <br />
together at the top. Not something she was going to scream about in front of the rest, but what the hell had gone wrong there? It almost <br />
seemed like Vinny'd double crossed her... but she'd gone up against two of the wimpiest scrub pledges out there. Still needed to smack that <br />
grin off his face about it. Anyway, he'd won his first fights, so hopefully he'd come out on top and fix this whole mess.<br />
<br />
While the other does milled about, Chad grabbed a stick to sketch out a bracket in the dirt. She wanted to be sure those punks who'd somehow <br />
cheated and taken her out were in for the same. It was 32 slots between the Stags, the stragglers, and a the park bucks they'd brought in, give <br />
or take. She doodled some branches, counted out 5 rounds. Then she remembered it was double elimination. Friggin' Vinny, making things too <br />
complicated. She sketched a bit more, making sure she had it straight. So today, they'd mostly finished two rounds. She'd lost, which was crap, <br />
Vinny won, that damn punk Shaun won. Round 2, Vinny'd won again, so... he was save from the doe thing then. Shaun'd gone down like the <br />
bitch he was, so that's still how he might turn out. And of course Chad was totally robbed because whatever the hell kind of defective antlers <br />
she'd been stuck with.<br />
<br />
She looked down at her sketch. Kinda looked like antlers really. Who had the biggest now anyway? Vinny had a pretty damn nice set of course. <br />
Probably the most points anyway. But then Mitch had some nice ones too, with that one point that kinda curved off at an angle... she'd have to <br />
have another look around tomorrow. Anyway, so there were two bitch matches for round 2 that got put off after she'd blacked out... then round <br />
three had another set where that was on the line for anyone who lost. After 5 rounds, there'd only be one person who was undefeated. She was <br />
pretty sure he whoever that was would end up leading the Order but there was some stupid garbage with wild card slots and maybe having a <br />
rematch where the best of the losers fought the winner twice if he won once. Man, screw all this, she thought. Next year we're just doing one <br />
elimination. Too freaking complicated.<br />
<br />
With that, she put down the stick she'd absently used to doodle faces in her brackets and headed to that &quot;TG rock&quot; the husky had pointed out <br />
for the night. She didn't trust them with how they kept trying to ruin everyone's fun, and she sure as hell didn't want to deal with any park deer. <br />
Tomorrow she'd come back and get a good seat to watch the fights. Once Vinny was off resting to the side between fights, she'd go down there <br />
and ask what the hell went wrong here. Just go whisper in his ear or something. Get a better look at those antlers.<br />
<br />

<br />
Meanwhile, at the gate, Agent Sherman was losing her patience, asking an increasingly rattled receptionist what the holdup was.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry ma'am, but regulations are strict about not letting anyone in untransformed. I'm sure someone will make an exception here, but you <br />
see the only way in is through the transformation chamber, and it makes an automatic scan for foreign objects before the locks cycle. I don't <br />
really understand how it works myself, but there was that one movie...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then override the scan. If we aren't being transformed, it doesn't matter what we take in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, but I don't really have a way to do that from here. Let me see if I can get in touch with our programmer. Just, hang on a moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we could always just comply,&quot; Johnson said with a grin. &quot;Stalk this guy down as a big ol' pair of tigers or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Agent Sherman glared back with a look that clearly showed she was in no mood to deal with any jokes today.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Susan struggled to pull herself up through the gap, fighting through agonizing pain and feeling like her grip might slip at any minute. <br />
Eventually she pulled herself halfway up, but her ruined leg was stuck. At least the worst part was over. She was halfway there. She just needed <br />
some rest. A little nap here and she'd crawl to freedom. As her adrenaline faded, she passed out, leaning halfway out of the treacherous gap in <br />
the floor.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; said the Minotaur, when he called his guests down to the sitting room, large glass of cognac in hand. &quot;Just what was so important you felt <br />
the need to rush over and explain it in person?&quot;</p>
