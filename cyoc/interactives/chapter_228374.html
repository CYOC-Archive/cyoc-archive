<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Man, Dad&#39;s friends sure are loud, Jeff thought. They had been friends since high school, and it seemed like they were as rowdy as they were back then. Heh, then again, it must have been nice to have lifelong friends that you could still hang around like that must have been nice. There was Andrew, who was always looking for a fun time. Then there was James, who thought himself something of a ladies&#39; man even though his track record wasn&#39;t that good, according to Jeff&#39;s father. Finally, there was Andrew, who was the more serious type but was able to cut loose when he was with his friends. Jeff hoped to have friends like that when he&#39;s as old as his Dad, especially after what happened with Mom... Hmmm, let&#39;s not think about depressing things.<br />
<br />
Phew, it was getting hot today, huh? Maybe it was time for a shower. Jeff went to the bathroom, not realizing what was happening in his room. He proceeded to take off all his clothes and turned on the cold water, but despite how cold the water was, Jeff still felt hot. What was happening to him; this wasn&#39;t normal! It was then when Jeff looked down, and to his relief and annoyance, he found that he was hard. Damn, these hormones. As much as Jeff didn&#39;t want to do this while his Dad&#39;s friends were around, he needed to take care of this. The temperature of the water went from cold to hot as Jeff leaned against the shower wall and began stroking himself. Fuck, for some reason, this felt better than normal. Guess he was just backed up, Jeff thought as he pinched a nipple and moaned.<br />
<br />
Little did Jeff know he was included in his father&#39;s changes. Slowly, he was aging, but Jeff was too engrossed in pleasure to notice his muscles slowly strengthening or his body slowly getting taller inch by inch. It wasn&#39;t until Jeff noticed that something was strange about his dick; it seemed bigger? And his hand; it seemed a bit more rough? Slowly, he opened his eyes to find that he was more defined than before. Whoa! Jeff always wanted to get buffer, but how...<br />
<br />
Before Jeff could think about this more, the growth that had just occurred suddenly sped up. Jeff&#39;s muscles were contracting and relaxing, with his muscles becoming a bit bigger after every cycle. With the growth came arousal as Jeff became rock-hard with all this happening. He couldn&#39;t think straight anymore, and he roughly grabbed his cock and began stroking it with renewed vigor. God, he never felt this horny before! While he could notice small things, like how his arm was rubbing against some abs he never had before or his back spreading wider across the shower wall, for the most part, all of his attention was on his dick as Jeff was desperate for release. It wasn&#39;t long before he crossed the threshold, and with a triumphant moan, Jeff was having the most powerful orgasm of his life.<br />
<br />
The man slid down the wall and was left a panting mess on the shower floor. It took him a while before he came down from the orgasmic high. What the hell just happened. Jeff got up and wiped the steam from the mirror to find an unfamiliar man staring back at him. Wait! That man was him, wasn&#39;t he? Somehow, he had gone from a weedy teen to a hulking adult. How did this happen? Wait, could it be that strange computer he got from the mail?<br />
<br />
Jeff quickly dried off, wrapped a towel around his waist, and headed to his room. He wasn&#39;t sure what he was expecting when he got to his room, but he wasn&#39;t expecting five young men wearing nothing but shorts flexing in his room. The hell? Wait a minute, these men looked familiar. Were these his Dad and his friends? One of the men noticed Jeff in the doorway and approached him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff? Is that you?&quot; This man, this was his father, wasn&#39;t it? &quot;Looks like it affected you too. Oh, I guess I should explain, huh? Me and guys passed by your room when we noticed the machine scan us. We couldn&#39;t help but investigate and use your little machine. Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to snoop through your stuff, but I guess curiosity got the best of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff stared blankly at his Dad. So these changes were all his fault. He wasn&#39;t mad at his father, but he was annoyed that he did this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s fine. Just, please, don&#39;t do this again without my permission.&quot; Mike let out a sigh of relief. You know now that they were facing each other, they didn&#39;t look like father and son anymore, huh? They looked more like brothers. Before they could dwell on this thought more though, Andrew decided to cut into the conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, let&#39;s all go to the gym. I want to test out these new muscles out.&quot; The postman proceeded to playfully flex his powerful biceps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; Anthony responded, &quot;But we&#39;re probably going to need more clothes than old shorts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll use the Chronivac to make us some new clothes,&quot; Jeff said. However, while he was typing in the specs, he wondered if he should make some other changes while he was here...</p>
