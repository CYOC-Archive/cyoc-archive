<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Anna waited for her ideal boyfriend to come, she heard the doorbell ring. &quot;Coming!&quot; she shouted as she ran downstairs. She opened the door and initially thought no one was there. &quot;Um... Excuse me, Miss!&quot; Anna looked down and saw why. A kid in a nice looking dress shirt and jeans was at her door. &quot;Well, aren&#39;t you a little cutie. What&#39;s your name?&quot; &quot;It&#39;s Nicky, Miss and I&#39;m selling cookies for a fundrainer!&quot; the boy with black messy hair and green eyes exclaimed. &quot;Well, isn&#39;t that cool!&quot; Anna said as she looked behind him. &quot;But where are your parents, sweetie. &quot;Heh,heh. Oh Mommy said I could go all by myself as long as I stay on this block! Cuz Im&#39;ma big boy now!&quot; &quot;Well now. I guess I can&#39;t let this bravery go to waste. I&#39;ll take some cookies.&quot; &quot;You will?! Oh thank you so mu-&quot;<br />
<br />
But before Nicky could finish his sentence, he let out a small moan as he clutched his stomach. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Anna asked, clearly concerned. &quot;I... I don&#39;t know... My tummy feels all funny... Ohhh...&quot; &quot;Oh, um... Do you think you can you walk back home to your mom?&quot; &quot;I... I don&#39;t know... Uhhhh...&quot; Not knowing what to do, Anna simply looked at the young child. And that was when she noticed something strange. The looser fabric on Nicky&#39;s clothes were starting to fill out all over his body. And she was sure, he was up to her knees just a few moments ago, but now he was up to her stomach. &quot;Ohh... My body feels all tingly now... &quot; Nicky exclaimed with a voice that sounded slight lower pitched than before. If Anna didn&#39;t know any better, it looked like Nicky was... &quot;Oh my god!&quot; Anna exclaimed. &quot;Miss?&quot; &quot;Um... Oh god! C-Come inside with me, honey.&quot; &quot;But my mom said I shouldn&#39;t go into stranger&#39;s houses...&quot; &quot;Please, just come with me!&quot; Anna said as she dragged Nick inside the house. If her thinking was right, the boy right next to her wouldn&#39;t be a stranger much longer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Miss! I really shouldn&#39;t...&quot; But before Nicky could say anymore, he heard several ripping sounds. Both he and Anna looked down, as Nicky&#39;s clothes started to tear. &quot;My clothes!&#39; Nicky shouted out as the tears continued to increase and get bigger. He could feel his toes smush against to the top of his sneakers as they started to rip too. Soon enough his toes shot out from the top. Nicky wiggled his toes as they looked much bigger then he remembered. &quot;What&#39;s happening to me?!&quot; Nicky shouted. &quot;Um... Come with me!&quot; was all Anna could say as she dragged Nicky again. As she brought him upstairs, his shirt and pants tore apart completely, leaving the remnants of them hanging off his much bigger body. &quot;Miss! What&#39;s going on?! I&#39;m scared!&quot; Nicky shouted as he teared up. His shoes were broken apart and his socks followed soon after. He could now feel his bare feet touch the carpet with every step. <br />
<br />
Anna eventually got him upstairs and into her room. Letting go, both her and Nicky looked at the latter&#39;s body. He looked like a ten year old now. His clothes were now gone, leaving to frightened child in nothing, but his underwear. Underwear that was straining from his massive growth spurt, a bulge becoming much bigger in its confines. &quot;Holy crud! What&#39;s happening to me?! &quot;Why am I growing?!&quot; &quot;Um, you see...&quot; Anna started, not sure how to explain. &quot;Well, I got this machine that can changed bodies and its changing yours. You&#39;re gonna be a sixteen year old soon.&quot; &quot;What?! No, change me back!&quot; Nicky shouted as he heard a loud snap. He saw Anna cover her eyes as he felt cool air around his groin. He looked down and saw his wiener flopping out in the open, one that looked much bigger. &quot;Ahhhhhh! My pee-pee! What&#39;s happening to it?!&quot; Nicky yelled as he felt his balls drop. He fell to the floor on his knees as he covered up his growing package. &quot;It seems like you&#39;re about to hit puberty kid!&quot; Anna said as he moved several of her fingers away from her eye. &quot;Pu-Betty?! What&#39;s that... Hnngg!&quot; <br />
<br />
As Nicky hit age 12, he could feel an intense amount of something come from his growing penis. &quot;Agh! My wiener! It burns!&quot; Nicky pressed onto his groin, trying to stop the pain. He felt his penis continue to grow in his hands. The once soft organ was getting harder by the minute and pushing his hands back. &quot;Ahh! What is...  my pee-pee... doing?!&quot; As bushel of hair was growing on his testicles as his penis shot up ramrod straight and getting thicker by the second. &quot;Wow!&quot; Anna exclaimed as she watched a once 5 year old kid starting to become a man; her man in mere seconds. &quot;Gah! My wiener! Guh!&quot; Nicky felt something threaten to come up from his erect dick. He desperately tried to fight it, but his growing up brain was winning. Despite not even knowing what an erection was mere moments ago, the boy grabbed onto his monster cock and started pumping. &quot;Ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah!&quot; &quot;Oh wow!&quot; Anna exclaimed again, watching the now teenager masturbate for the first time. &quot;Ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah! Miss! Ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah! Anna! I&#39;m gonna... Guh! Gaaaaahhhhhh!&quot; Nicky yelled out in a much deeper voice as he ejaculated onto the floor. &quot;Ahhh.... ahhh... Hahhhhh...&quot; Nicky let out a sigh as he soon stopped cumming.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guh!&quot; Nicky then spasmed again as he continued to grow. His body hair was coming in and his muscles were now forming, becoming the muscular man Anna wanted. His black, shaggy hair turned into a short crew cut blond, his green eyes hued blue and the boyishness of his five year old face remained albeit fit for the sixteen year old he was becoming. &quot;Anna! Hnngh! Babe!&quot; Anna listened as the effects of Nicky becoming her ideal boyfriend took hold of his formally five year old brain. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to her, he rest of her ideal traits were forming in his mind. Gone was the five year old boy who was out fundraising who loved his mommy. Now was the sixteen year old jock, a kind and caring young man with an amazing body and a confidence fit for the body he had. All knowledge of football, baseball and wresting came to him. The influx of information hurt his brain, making for a mild case of dysphoria because his mind had been that of a five year old moments prior. But soon, it became nothing more than a passing memory as his mind was now full of sixteen year old thoughts. <br />
<br />
His dick got erect again and Nicky pumped it furiously. &quot;Ah,ah,ah,ah! Oh yeah! Fuck me!&quot; Nicky shouted out revealing to Anna that his mind was definitively not that of a five year old child anymore. A few more seconds passed and Nicky ejaculated once more. He panted as his dick calmed down and got soft again. &quot;Fuck... me...&quot; Nicky said as he passed out onto the floor. &quot;Well then...&quot; Anna said to herself as she walked towards her new boyfriend, making sure not to step on his cum. &quot;Not what I was expecting to happen, but you take what you get, huh?&quot; With some difficulty, Anna dragged Sixteen Year Old Nicky Simmons onto her bed. &quot;Hopefully, his mommy doesn&#39;t still think her kid is five years old.&quot;</p>
