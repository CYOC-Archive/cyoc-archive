<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brendon and Rex undertook the most dangerous part of the mission: they had to get back into the human world, avoid detection, and make it to Brendon’s girlfriend.<br />
<br />
( I’m scared. ) Brendon momentarily lost his focus as they neared a street light and the paving leading up to concrete sidewalk.<br />
<br />
(( Rex am scared too. Not want to get Brendon or Rex hurt. Rex not know what this is Brendon is looking at. ))<br />
<br />
Brendon recalled that Rex had only just started to form in the park and only began to grow into his own person in the field. He had only recently come back into the world after millions of years and knew nothing of human beings or cities. They took a deep breath together. Rex tried to focus. Brendon tried to focus. They were deathly afraid and vulnerable together for the first time.<br />
<br />
Brendon had them glance to the left and he saw tall bushes and pine trees they could hide in. ( Rex, can we go into the trees and just calm down? I want to try something with you. )<br />
<br />
(( Yes, friend Brendon. I obey. ))<br />
<br />
The deinonychus found a pleasing bush to hide in and they nosed their way in, pulling in their tail and curling up under the soft leaves.<br />
<br />
(( What we try? )) Rex asked, genuinely curious.<br />
<br />
( Back there... we... joined. We were one. Did you feel it? )<br />
<br />
(( Rex was in Brendon’s brain. )) The dinosaur recalled. He indicated he understood.<br />
<br />
( Let’s do that again. I want to try sharing my memories with yours. Everything I know. Everything I’ve ever learnt. I want to give it to you. All of it. )<br />
<br />
(( Okay. )) Brendon heard the nervousness in Rex’s  thought voice. (( Rex will try learn from Brendon. Rex will join together with Brendon. We... what happen to us? ))<br />
<br />
( Only one way to find out. Let’s relax and rest. )<br />
<br />
(( Okay. )) Rex said excitedly.<br />
<br />
They deinonychus closed his eyes. Their eyes. They joined together in a deep trance, completely disabling the body in the process as their minds melded into one being. The raptor only breathed slowly and rhythmically, passed out and lost in a deep restful sleep.<br />
<br />
Somewhere, inside their own shared brain, Rex and Brendon found themselves standing face to face several feet apart in a misty void. Blackness. Nothing. Just the two of them.<br />
<br />
“W-Where are... we?” The dinosaur asked, startled as he clearly spoke the words with his own voice from his own mouth. He looked down in shock and gasped at the sight of his handsome saurian body restored to him. “Wait, I me again! Rex is whole! And Rex speak human now?”<br />
<br />
“I... I think this is... this is our imagination. Or our subconscious.” Brendon looked over himself and blushed as he realized he was completely nude before his dinosaur friend. They stared at each other and stepped forward gently, eyes never breaking. “This isn’t... real. But it feels real.”<br />
<br />
As they drew within inches of each other the two smiled warmly and embraced warmly. Rex wrapped his arms over the human’s shoulders and gripped tightly, nuzzling his naked chest. Brendon smiled at the scaly snout rustling his wisps of teenage chest hair. They broke away and stared at each other lovingly.<br />
<br />
“Hi, buddy!” Brendon grinned. “It’s good to see you!”<br />
<br />
“Yes!” Rex nodded, smiling widely through his toothy jaws. “Rex like this, even if not real.”<br />
<br />
“All right.” Brendon took the raptor’s hands in his and gently they kneeled down together until both were lying in the void.<br />
<br />
“Rex is ready,” the dinosaur whispered softly through his gruff voice.<br />
<br />
“Close your eyes,” Brendon instructed gently. “Let’s try merging together. I want us to join as one and share all that we know with each other.”<br />
<br />
“Yes...” The raptor nodded, falling into a meditative state at the simple commands. “Rex will teach you and you Brendon will teach Rex.”<br />
<br />
They both began to dissolve until there was nothing left but the void. All consciousness ceased. All thought vanished. The two minds merged into one while outside their body peacefully slept.<br />
<br />
It felt like hours and even days passed for the two, but it was mere minutes. The dinosaur watched Brendon’s complete memories like a movie, taking it all in and examining every detail while Brendon in turn was treated to the same experience from Rex. The human grew increasingly excited, and even a little horny, as he felt Rex begin to grow in intelligence. It was an incredible experience actually feeling his new friend becoming smarter and smarter as he absorbed human knowledge. He felt Rex refine, become sophisticated, his mind and his capacity expanding by huge leaps in seconds. In turn, Rex was giving him all of the knowledge he had on his own, teaching Brendon everything about his world, his life, the dinosaurs, the ancient past.<br />
<br />
He met Rex’s mother and father, his two sisters, and shared in every day life with them. He ran through fields, he played in trees, he chased his siblings, he ran with his pack. He experienced the cold brutality of the prehistoric world and felt the crushing loss of the poor raptor’s final days. All the while, their body slept on, totally secluded and safe from the world as the human and the dinosaur grew and changed with each other’s memories and total knowledge swelling within them. They even exchanged their sexuality, Brendon learning what turned Rex on and being treated to glorious visions and sensations of rough primal dinosaur sex, and shockingly some wild male on male love making, while Rex learnt of human sensuality and the tender exploration of young teenaged bodies. By the time it was all over, the two had given each other absolutely everything, yet they were still two separate halves of a whole, each with their own dreams, thoughts, and desires.<br />
<br />
Until they found themselves back in the void together. Their eyes shot open. They stared at each other in slack jawed awe, having experienced the most magical and indescribable things together.<br />
<br />
“Brendon...” The raptor whispered, blinking, his voice softer, wiser, smarter. “It worked. I’ve changed so much. I’ve reached your level of intelligence. I-I’m more human now.”<br />
<br />
The palpable delight on the dinosaur’s face was a moment that Brendon would remember forever, even if they were only inside their own mind when it happened.<br />
<br />
“Just think,” the human smiled back, blushing. “I’m the only human to have actually experienced the prehistoric world. It was... so... so amazing. But scary.”<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Rex blinked, considering the observation as he stood up and examined himself. “Yes, that seems a proper analysis, doesn’t it? Oh, but Brendon, I wouldn’t give up a single memory!”<br />
<br />
“I know...” the human smiled, closing his eyes in awe for a moment, relishing the alien world he now knew.<br />
<br />
“Your adoptive father, this Rick...” Rex reached forward, touching Brendon’s hand and squeezing it under his claws. “He mistreated you tremendously, didn’t he?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah.” Brendon sighed, startled as he felt a hot blush overtake his face as the dinosaur’s smooth scales touched his skin. “He treated me like shit.”<br />
<br />
“Hmmm.” The deinonychus nodded solemnly. “Yet his scientific acumen is such that he can resurrect an entire being from mere fossil. That he can change his step son into a new form. I fear we need him yet, Brendon. As much as I would like to, we cannot survive in the human world as a dinosaurian forever. Especially without the ability to speak. We will be treated as a beast, or at best, an oddity.”<br />
<br />
“But if he turns me back, you’ll die.” Brendon gulped. “I promised you.”<br />
<br />
“Perhaps if he can create us, and his strange machine is capable of reviving me, it may also split us apart into two bodies. I believe it is worth exploration, at least.”<br />
<br />
“Sure, buddy. Sure.” Brendon thought about this and nodded gently. “You might be right, but I’ve got no way of knowing.”<br />
<br />
“So, for the moment, our best course of action is to continue on. We should resume our quest together and find shelter with your wonderful girlfriend. I am looking forward to meeting her.”<br />
<br />
Brendon smirked playfully. “Oh, I’m sure you are, you horny reptile. I’ve seen how much you love fucking.”<br />
<br />
This made the deinonychus smile broadly and he looked away in embarrassment. “It’s not my fault that my urges are so strong. I am, after all, something of an animal, am I not?”<br />
<br />
“I’m sure she’ll like our big dino dicks.” Brendon laughed. “I know I do.”<br />
<br />
“Quite.” Rex snickered. “Now then, shall we wake ourselves up?”<br />
<br />
“Absolutely. It’s nice to know we can meet each other like this.” Brendon looked around into the void and sighed. “This feels right, doesn’t it? Both of us separate like this?”<br />
<br />
“Don’t despair.” Rex reassured his human. “I’m happy to share our body and our mind with you.”<br />
<br />
“All right.” Brendon nodded. “Then I guess it’s time to get going.”<br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
The deinonychus opened his eyes and glanced around without moving a muscle. He was still well concealed under the bush. It was impossible to tell what time it was, but they must have been out for quite some time after all. The night had grown even darker and rough storm clouds had begun to churn overhead.<br />
<br />
(( It is going to rain any moment. I can sense the air changing. )) Rex observed. (( We might wish to wait until it starts for cover. ))<br />
<br />
( That seems like a good idea, Rexy. ) Brendon sniffed with their nostrils and observed a distinct ozone smell that would have been impossible to detect as a human.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, not more than ten minutes passed before they were struck through the bush with the first droplets of rain. They rose, shook themselves off, and stretched their legs as it began to pour. The rain storm was indeed the perfect cover for the dinosaur, his insulated feathers keeping their warm reptilian skin mostly dry and human visibility greatly reduced in the dark. Not so for the deinonychus.<br />
<br />
Rex and Brendon’s cooperation had changed drastically after their joining. No longer distinctly separate in their movements and controls, the two were uncannily precise in their movements. They stayed low as they reached the sidewalk and snapped into a nearby front yard. There, they crouched in a flower bed as Brendon tried to recognize where they were. He saw a street sign down the road and felt a rush of delight. They were nearly there!<br />
<br />
( Buddy, we’re just a couple streets over from her house! We’re just about there. )<br />
<br />
(( Splendid! )) Rex said excitedly. (( Might I suggest we take the back alley to maintain our stealth? ))<br />
<br />
( Good idea, Rexy! )<br />
<br />
They bolted across the street in a blur and sped across several front yards to the end of the street. They followed another wooden fence down and turned into the back alley, which was entirely dark and without lighting. Once there, they slowly stalked along the back of the houses, passing by oblivious human beings asleep in their beds as it began to flash lightning in the distance. The crack of thunder began to boom in the night sky. Rex was absolutely enthused, his primal instinct and memories recalling hunting trips in ancient storms.<br />
<br />
As they reached the other end of the alley they found themselves once again nearing sidewalk and rows of houses. They were one street over from their target now. Again, they bolted forward, using yard objects and decorations as cover, ever scanning their thermally charged vision and looking for blooms of human figures. Nothing. They had lucked out. It was completely safe.<br />
<br />
As they crossed the final back alley and emerged onto the street once more, they paused.<br />
<br />
(( We have company. )) Rex said sharply, alert.<br />
<br />
Brendon saw it too, the outline of a man taking a late night smoke on his porch, watching the storm. Two houses away, Brendon’s heart jumped as he saw his girlfriend’s house, the inviting green building and the perfectly manicured lawn calling to him.<br />
<br />
(( Easy. )) Rex cautioned him. (( Now is not the time to expose ourselves, Brendon. We’re almost there, we must be cautious only a little longer. ))<br />
<br />
( Sorry, Rex. Got distracted. ) Brendon replied sheepishly.<br />
<br />
(( Quite all right. Would you like me to take over for a while? ))<br />
<br />
( Go ahead. I don’t want to fuck this up. )<br />
<br />
The dinosaur blinked in the rain as Brendon shrank to a small presence in their mind and Rex took complete control of their form. The dinosaur in charge of the dinosaur’s body was immediately noticeable. His movements became more elegant, more precise, the clumsy footfalls were gone.<br />
<br />
Rex carefully snuck forward at a near crawl, tail low, neck down, as the man on the porch burned down his cigarette. He kept his eyes moving, his body tight. He didn’t even make a sound as he passed by the wooden boards on the porch and passed by an open stairwell without so much as a peep.<br />
<br />
( So glad I let you do this. ) Brendon commented, watching their tense situation from a distance.<br />
<br />
(( As am I, my young friend. )) Rex smiled, clearing the porch and passing by the human above without detection.<br />
<br />
From there, Rex simply kept going. He easily passed the other yard and curled around the wall of the neighbouring house. They waited, watching.<br />
<br />
(( What do we do now, Brendon? ))<br />
<br />
( Can’t just knock on the door, can we? ) The human sighed. ( Let’s find a place to sleep. We can take it up in the morning. )<br />
<br />
(( Perfect. So we shall. )) Rex agreed.<br />
<br />
The dinosaur stayed low as he unlatched the gate to the back yard and carefully and quietly closed it behind him. Brendon felt an erotic thrill as Rex realized he was now intelligent enough to manipulate doors and open things and even in the rain he felt their members swell slightly.<br />
<br />
( Down boy. ) Brendon mocked.<br />
<br />
(( You know, I think we deserve a nice sticky reward for our most excellent partnership, don’t you? ))<br />
<br />
( Sounds fun! ) Brendon agreed, taking back a little control as he lead Rex under the wooden boat turned upside down in the yard. They were starting to get hard with excitement as they successfully snuggled in under the boat and hid themselves in the stormy night.<br />
<br />
Brendon glanced down and saw their members swelling hard.<br />
<br />
( I still can’t believe how huge we are. We’re soooo big. ) Brendon laughed. ( Is that... normal? )<br />
<br />
(( Our body is still young, my friend. We’re not fully mature. Adult size will grant us longer and fuller sex organs. And those will continue to grow through our life as we do. Imagine a dinosaur without stress, without disease, fed, happy, and healthy. All those factors affect our growth and development. I suspect that as we age we will grow much larger than humans believe us capable. ))<br />
<br />
( I can’t wait to get bigger with you. ) Brendon admitted, their erections pumped to full size as the two minds grew more and more aroused.<br />
<br />
(( Being such a big virile dinosaur excites you, does it? )) Rex said playfully, helping Brendon remember their joined memories. The dinosaur played back images of himself rutting with a female, the feeling of her tight dinosaurian vaginal passage. Their grunts and roars as they both came. The hot sweltering forest around them accentuating the feeling as they finished their act and pulled away.<br />
<br />
Odd. Brendon and Rex noticed something... different. A strange instability in their body that had just opened up.<br />
<br />
( Er... Rex... ) Brendon had them look down to find that they were filling more space under the boat. ( Are you seeing this??! )</p>
