<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Work was eventful. Only for me that is. I used the ring to compleat almost every mundane task that I was alone for. I still muttered wishes so I had to make sure I had noise cove or was out of earshot wen I did so.<br />
<br />
I&#39;d briefly experimented with thought wishing, that is silently thinking about the wish in my head. But I decided against it, my thoughts could easily run wild and without anything to brace myself with, such as havering to speak who knows what truble could unfold. For now I would say my wishs, and made a wish that that would be the only way until I wished otherwise.<br />
<br />
While at work I also wished our car was done at the shop, makeing it avalable for my wife to pick up. A quick text told me that it worked as my wife had gotten home with the car about an hour after I&#39;d made the wish.<br />
<br />
With work done I came home and went about the usual routine with my wife. Dinner, house work, relaxing and cuddling on the couch, and finally the part i was most excited for, bed.<br />
<br />
In typical fashion my wife turned in first and I stayed up a bit longer. Again I listened for the sound of her sleeping and then went to the bedroom.<br />
<br />
I watched her sleeping, remembering the curves I&#39;d given her the night before. They were still there of course, I hadn&#39;t wished them away. I spent a fair amount of time thinking of what I wanted to do before I decided I wanted to expand (pun intended) on the wish from last night.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish Sarah would gain 100 pounds.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she lay on her side, the sheets draped over her body, I watched as she swelled in size. Like a balloon her stomach and breasts bubbled out before her. Her exposed arm on the sheets became flabby and soft. Her cheeks rounded out and neck widened slightly, not quite to double chin status yet, but enough to wrinkle if she looked down. In truth alot of the weight had ended up in her rear and thighs. They looked almost a whole inch thicker now, and her bottom was just on the fringe of becoming a shelf.<br />
<br />
For all the thinness Sarah had maintained the 100 pounds suited her nicely, still overweight by medical standards but pleasantly plump was the term that came to mind. <br />
<br />
I wasn&#39;t fully aware of what came over me next. Maybe just my curiosity as to the possibilities. Later I&#39;d realize I had some underlining fetishes I&#39;d never really explored, but at the time it was just some impulse that I ended up following.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish Sarah gained 200 pounds.&quot; I whispered softly<br />
<br />
At that her whole body began to balloon outwards. Her stomach spilled outwards along with her breasts. Her arms became riddled with stretch marks and rolls formed at her joints. Sausage like fingers overtook her hands. The hand atop the sheets gripped the fabric and with a wrenching creek of the bed she rolled onto her back, pealing the sheets off her growing body. <br />
<br />
Her breathing had picked up, I noticed it becoming more throaty and harsh as her neck swelled to connect her neck shoulders and head. Her who face rounded out now, compleate with double, then tripple chins. <br />
<br />
Her body now exposed to view showed her thighs becoming larger then whole thanksgiving turkeys littered with cellulite and causing her gym shorts to ride up into her crotch. As they did soft *twangs* of snapping fabric rang out. Her thigh gap quickly sealing up as the mass caused her inner legs to collide down to the knee, now encased in a spongy loose roll of fat.<br />
<br />
Her stomach stretched and spilled out under her tank top as the shoulder straps struggled to contain her breasts. Those of which had swelled larger then DD. sleeping bra-less as was her fashion caused her growing ariolas to expose themselves from the corners of her arm holes and cleavage. Amazingly the cotton fabric held out, over burdened though it may be.<br />
<br />
Sarah now took up more then half out queen sized bed, arms outstretched over her head. One leg bent under the other. Her breathing sounded labored but steady and a faint shimmer of sweat began to form on her head and damp spots around the thinly stretched straps of her tanktop.<br />
<br />
Then I started to panic when she made groaning sounds, ones I knew as her being roused from sleep for some reason or another.<br />
<br />
Now I don&#39;t know why I did what I did next, I think it was 50% dumbfounded&#39;ness and 50% the rush of being caugh. But I took the few moments I had before she fully stirred awake to lightly step to my side of the bed and crawl in, rather then just undo the wish.<br />
<br />
As I did Sarah truly began to shift her over 400 pounds of soft jiggly body. The bed groaned in relief as heavy huffs of air came from my newly morbidly obese wife. She somehow shifted onto her fat scrunched up feet and hoisted her wobbling butt off the bed. With slow, stumbling steps she pounded one foot in front of the other reaching the door and gasping for air. I watched as oddly she shimmied sideways a bit, her fat curtain of a gut and sagging ass-shelf wedging and slipping through the door, and out of sight. A few slow footfalls later I heard water running from the bathroom, followed by a  gulp and refreshing sigh of approval.<br />
<br />
Then like the stomping of the T-Rex in Jurassic Park Sarah lumbered back through the door, seemingly unaware of her extra 300 pounds after weakening up to get a glass of water. She leaned onto the bed, which screamed in protest to the returning weight.<br />
<br />
As she lay back down on her side, this time facing me, she reached one huge flabby arm over me and resting it in my chest. The weight of what felt like 25 pounds settled softly across me as Sarah cuddled me as she sometimes would at night. The action felt wrong as as she did it as though still in her 140 pound body but I dare not move from this spot, else I might cause my wife to notice her change.<br />
<br />
I layed under her arm then, her huge squishy breast and belly draped half way over my body and ham sized arm fully across my chest. Her heavy breathing blew and sucked across my face and already I could feel dampness seeping thought her overtaxed clothes as her weight made her sweat simply from her overly insulated body heat.<br />
<br />
It was an experience, to say the least. But as a kind of self punishment for the &#39;tampering&#39; of my wife I resined myself to sleeping like this for the night. I&#39;d made my bed and had to sleep in it after all. I was glad I at least had the foresight to make a quick wish before awkwardly drifting to sleep.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish Sarah would return to her original weight 10 min before she wakes up again.&quot; I mumbled before I finally closed my eyes.<br />
<br />
The next morning I woke up to the sound of Sarah milling about the room. I was groggy as always but I did notice right away that Sarah was standing up picking something out of the closet to were. She still had on her tank top that now  looked more like a ratty sundress. Stretched out and hanging off her shoulders just enough to cover her breast line. It had a ring of dampness around its underarms and back. Infact the whole bed felt slightly damp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning hun.&quot; She greeted me when she saw me sit up in bed staring at her. &quot;I think I wore one of your shirts to bed last night. Hope you don&#39;t mind. It was quite comfy. Though I think our heater kicked on last night, you really sweated up the bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was just awake enough to understand her explanation of events to her wake in just now. <br />
<br />
Again, I&#39;m not sure what prompted me to do what I did next. (the whole getting caught thing comes to mind)<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you sleep alright last night hun?&quot; I asked, feeling like I was walking on a razors edge.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I did have this weird dream that I was this giant...&quot; She scrunched her face cutely as she thought about what to say. &quot;I can&#39;t remember? I was big and heavy but that&#39;s all I can remember, maybe some monster or something? I don&#39;t know. Why do you ask?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were tossing around a bit last night, mumbling in your sleep is all.&quot; I quickly replied. &quot;Just wanted to make sure your alright.&quot;<br />
<br />
I got up and walked to give her a kiss on the cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I feel great actually! Like a huge weights been lifted off of me. Though I don&#39;t remember being stressed out over anything?&quot;</p>
