<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I hope this is the right way to add a note *fingers crossed* First, I&#39;d like to thank everyone who has enjoyed my writing so far; this is my first time sharing so it&#39;s quite flattering. Second, you might have noticed a few familiar names from Strange Disparity&#39;s branch, I started writing this because I was heavily inspired by their branches and also I guess the latest Spider-Man movie had a stronger impact on me than I initially thought lol. Hmm E&E meeting different versions of themselves from different branches? Now that&#39;s an idea. Third, please feel free to add your own branch if inspiration strikes, after all that&#39;s the fun of cyoc =) Thank you again, I really hope I&#39;m doing this right.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“How long am I supposed to do this?” asked Greg as he stirred a beaker filled with a gray solution.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think it’s supposed to be that color” said Ethan “I’m putting more in” He turned the Bunsen burner off and placed the beaker on a mat before slowly adding more black powder.<br />
<br />
“No one else is doing that” Greg protested.<br />
<br />
“No one else’s look like ours” Ethan notices Greg looking around the Chem. lab eyeing the black liquid in beakers surrounding them, he fidgets and Ethan chuckles “It’s fine, see?” He lifts up the now black solution and places it above the burner “It’s not going to explode or anything, copper oxide is basic in nature. Oh and to answer your previous question, not long, just make sure it doesn’t boil”.<br />
<br />
“Good Morales” The chemistry teacher Mrs. Abuzalgo praised, then clapped her hands together and turned to face Greg “Now Cubitt, give me an example of a different base that can be used to neutralize sulfuric acid”.<br />
<br />
Greg stood with his mouth agape for while looking to his friend, who in turn was mouthing an answer that the boy just couldn’t read.<br />
<br />
“Sodium hydroxide…In equal parts should work” Ethan interjected; Mrs. Abulzago crossed her arms and shook her head.<br />
<br />
“You’re correct, but I didn’t ask you” She gave the boys a disapproving look before motioning her chin to the beaker “I think that’s about done”.<br />
<br />
Ethan turned the burner off again and moved the beaker to the mat, shifting the equipment for filtering substances forward. Greg rubs the back of his neck, his cheeks ever so slightly turning red.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Abuzalgo let out a tiny smirk before walking away and addressing the class “Don’t forget to jolt down the word equations, state symbols and the symbol equations”.<br />
<br />
“You had to be smart too? Some guys have all the luck…” Greg crinkled his nose.<br />
<br />
“What are you talking about?” asked Ethan as he folded the filter paper to size.<br />
<br />
“Oh come on dude, you’ve been getting taller these past few months and you come back from winter break with a full-on lumberjack beard? You’re a swimmer for crying out loud, you have no business having that thing… It’s making… The girls go wild”.<br />
<br />
“Ha… Mrs. Abuzalgo she’s tough isn’t she?” Ethan said, trying to change the subject.<br />
<br />
It worked and Greg started “Yeah, bet Coach has his hands full with that one…” He whistled quietly picking up a notebook and writing down the equations “Good thing she’s pretty”.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Abuzalgo is married to the Coach of the swim team. She’s a 40 year old petite woman who stood about 5’2 tall. She had light freckles that spread all across her pale skin. Laughter lines highlighted an occasional sly grin and her crow’s feet did the same for her stunning sea-green eyes, they were like arrows pointing to a gaze that never failed to intimidate; despite being small, those eyes gave her a dominating presence. Her dirty blonde hair was always kept in a French braid, the tail of it often brought to the front resting atop a generously sized bust.<br />
<br />
“Triple D’s” Greg grinned, squeezing the air in front of his chest.<br />
<br />
“So that’s your type?” Ethan mused.<br />
<br />
Greg stopped his hand motions “N… No… but I ain’t blind”<br />
<br />
“Really...?” Ethan noted his friend blushing, was he getting flustered? Ethan wanted to tease him a bit “I never asked, but what is your type?”<br />
<br />
Greg hesitated, sucking in some air before playfully punching his friend on the arm. This was a mistake, Ethan reflexively moved his arm away knocking over one of the other beakers on the table and he tried to grab it but splashed the contents onto his lab coat instead.<br />
<br />
“What happened?!” The teacher called out when she heard the beaker shattering on the ground.<br />
<br />
The acid started to eat away at Ethan’s coat and Mrs. Abuzalgo promptly went over to grab Ethan’s arm and lead him to the safety shower around the corner of the lab. Ethan pulled the lever and cold water immediately hosed him down.<br />
<br />
“I told them we needed better protective gear, Morales take off your clothes” She ordered.<br />
<br />
“H… Here?” Ethan stuttered, partially from the cold.<br />
<br />
“Yes, right here, right now” Mrs. Abuzalgo was looking up at Ethan with those stern eyes and he felt his hands moving against his will, slowly taking the lab coat off.<br />
<br />
“Woo-hoo free show!” exclaimed one female student followed by laughter from the rest of the class.<br />
<br />
“Settle down” The teacher demanded “Stay under the water for 15 minutes, I’ll take you to the nurse’s office after class. She proceeded to clear up the mess, interrogate Greg and continued on with the lesson.<br />
<br />
Ethan had turned so he was facing away from his peers and looking at the pipes. His heart was racing, why wasn’t there any curtains or something? He took off a pair of gloves and then his shirt and swore he could hear giggling from the girls. He kicked off his shoes that now had holes in them from the droplets of sulfuric acid; luckily his socks were fine so he deduced that his feet were too. The quivering teenager could feel a thousand eyes burning into his back when he dropped his pants and he stood there, practically naked and he was supposed to stay put for 15 minutes? That’s when Ethan became strongly aware of his puny little erection squishing against the fake penis he had made out of some old pillowcase and stuffing.<br />
<br />
Was it noticeable? No, no one would be able to see it with him facing this way but he was there, in class only wearing a pair of goggles and his underwear, full hard-on surrounded by classmates oblivious only to his change in size down under. This sounded like a bad dream or maybe a wet dream? He couldn’t tell. Ethan rubbed his face trying to get a clear head. He knew he wasn’t done yet and the thought scared and excited him at the same time.<br />
<br />
What would happen if he just bared it all? Ethan’s imagination kicked in and he began to fantasize a scene where some cheeky prankster grabbed the little bit of fabric and yanked it from him. He’d turn around startled, helplessly holding onto the garment as the seams tear away. The teacher is yelling over a thundering crowd. His briefs come undone in torn pieces; the fake penis he had sewn on flies in the air and lands into a beaker of sulfuric acid that was placed in the center of the room- that darn acid. The whole class watches the thing dissolve and slowly turns their heads in unison towards Ethan’s bare pathetic hard baby cock. The guys are guffawing, the girls are shrieking, even Mrs. Abuzalgo can’t keep it in. They all point and stare and they’re taking pictures, most definitely uploading them online, and all Ethan is doing, all he can do, is stand there shooting ropes after ropes of cum.<br />
<br />
Ethan gulped, that won’t happen right? He pinched the rim of his underwear… This is it.<br />
<br />
“No Morales, you don’t have to take off your underwear” Mrs. Abuzalgo’s voice came from across the room.<br />
<br />
“Aww… party pooper!” Another one of the girls cooed. The roar of laughter was much stronger now, albeit not as loud as it had been in his fantasy earlier.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Abuzalgo placed her hands to the sides of her hips “Stop, let’s keep the focus on class” She points an index finger to the windows “Transfer the copper sulfate into an evaporating basin and leave it by the window, don’t forget to label them and once you’re done with that you’re free to go”. She was letting the students out early, no doubt so Ethan could be left alone faster, no one complained as they did what they were told.<br />
<br />
As soon as all the other students left, the teacher collected all of the equipment, put them back on the shelves and excess product in its respective containers. She cleaned the used beakers and flasks all while Ethan shivered under the continuous flow of cold water.<br />
<br />
“That should be long enough, push it back up” Mrs. Abuzalgo instructed, Ethan pushed the lever up, stopping the stream. He took the goggles off and hugged his own body trying to keep warm. She passed him a different lab coat and told him to collect his things before making the trip to the nurse’s office.<br />
<br />
The hallways were full of students rushing to their next class. Most of them could not ignore the sight of a soaking wet man walking around in just a lab coat. There were a lot of giggles and picture taking, which Mrs. Abuzalgo immediately reprimanded but who’s to say if she managed to get all of them? Ethan couldn’t help but feel the heat rising in his cheeks; his extra growth spurt didn’t help. With his unshaven face and being so tall now, the coat was shorter on him and he figured he probably looked like some adult creep.<br />
<br />
“Miss Zhang!” Mrs. Abuzalgo called out to a student collecting her things from a locker. The girl turned her head to look at who had said her name; she tucked jet black hair behind her ears and approached the teacher with a warm smile.<br />
<br />
Soon as Ethan realized who it was, he kept his eyes locked onto the ground. Haylee Zhang was Greg’s ex-girlfriend. They had broken up around the end of last year, seemingly out of the blue; Greg didn’t really want to talk about what happened so Ethan never pried. Ethan and Haylee weren’t too close to begin with and as soon as the break-up finalized, she practically disappeared from the friend group. Ethan was always civil around her, but he often had this weird feeling that she resented him for some odd reason, especially towards the end of her and Greg’s relationship. Even with the sweetest smile on her face, Ethan could feel daggers every time her eyes glanced his way.<br />
<br />
“You’re in my next class correct?” Mrs. Abuzalgo asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes, I am” replied Haylee, quickly looking Ethan up and down.<br />
<br />
“Well, as you can see, I’m escorting Morales to the nurse’s office, it might take a while so I’d like you to be in charge of the class, simply make sure everyone behaves until I’m there. Understood?”<br />
<br />
“Yes Ma’am” Haylee nods her head before moving on and for a split second Ethan could see her smile falter to that of an annoyed frown. He is very much aware that he had been feeling paranoid a lot recently and not everything was about him but when it comes to Haylee, everything felt personal.<br />
<br />
Finally they reached their destination; Mrs. Abuzalgo went in first and explained to Nurse Freeman what had happened. The nurse took a moment after seeing Ethan, if Mrs. Abuzalgo hadn’t said anything she would have thought the boy was a member of faculty. She told him to sit down on the examination bench.<br />
<br />
Nurse Freeman was about the same age as Mrs. Abuzalgo, but one wouldn’t be able to tell as she had a very youthful dark complexion. She stood at 5’8 tall and liked to keep her curly hair really short and her jewelry really long. Her earrings were either dangling or resting on her shoulders and the charms on her bracelet would even get caught on things occasionally.<br />
<br />
“I keep telling them Ireti, we needed better gear, now look what happened” Mrs. Abuzalgo said exasperated hands up in the air.<br />
<br />
“Now, now, Julianne you know how it is, this school prioritizes athletics” Nurse Freeman said matter-of-factly.<br />
<br />
“He’s on the swim team” Mrs. Abuzalgo coughed.<br />
<br />
“Sorry” Said Nurse Freeman as she swiveled her office chair over to Ethan “Please remove your coat, let’s see if you got hurt anywhere” she added, putting on a pair of medical gloves.<br />
<br />
“T… Take it off?” Ethan asked, eyes shifting between the two ladies. Not long ago he was half naked in a room full of people, but he had been facing away from them. This time however, he was in a small room with two women, a very intimate setting. Ethan hesitated.<br />
<br />
Nurse Freeman raised both her eyebrows “I’ve seen it all kid, nothing surprises me”.<br />
<br />
The teenager took a deep breath and unbuttoned the coat, setting it aside next to him. It was so cold; Ethan could only imagine there would be a black hole where his pecker should be at this point.<br />
<br />
The nurse scanned Ethan’s body “You’re lucky, seems you only have a few first degree burns” she moved to her desk to get a few things “Clean the burned areas gently with mild soap and water and avoid popping any blisters that may develop… are you feeling any pain?”<br />
<br />
“No… not really” Ethan said quietly, observing his skin where there were rather small patches of reddish-brown here and there, mostly on his shin. He’ll have to punish Greg for this, tease him relentlessly and never let it down, the thought suddenly made Ethan feel all warm inside and he couldn’t help but smile to himself.<br />
<br />
Nurse Freeman came back with a tub and cotton swab “I’m just going to apply some petroleum jelly on the affected areas, help with the healing a bit, it should go away within 3 days but if it doesn’t, come back and see me or any other medical professional”. A bit of the sulfuric acid must have gotten onto the right side of Ethan’s briefs because the fabric appeared to have been eaten away, hanging on by a few delicate threads.<br />
<br />
“I’m just going to lift this up slightly to get to the skin underneath” The nurse said, lifting a part of his underwear to pat some cold petroleum jelly onto a superficial burn. Unfortunately one of her charms got caught on the fragile material; she pulled her hand away along with it and before Ethan could react…<br />
<br />
His briefs snapped.</p>
