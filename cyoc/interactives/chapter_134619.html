<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You start planning out what you’re gonna do. Since you are in your father’s body you have a more mature mind. You start to make a plan. You think of acting like him and switching his shoes into yours you quickly get a pair of expensive loafers that your mom made you wear for a wedding. It was a few sizes up when you were yourself. You also remember that your dad’s birthday is coming up. You quickly grab the loafers and remove some cotton you put in while you were yourself you compare it to your dad’s loafers they are perfect you put them back in the box and write a not.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dear Dad,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It’s gonna be your birthday in a few days! I wanted to be earlier than mom and Tim so I got you these loafers! Hope you like them!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Will<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Will put the note in the box and put the box on the couch. ...30 Minutes Later...<br />
Will hears in your dad’s voice “I’m Home!!” Hequickly hides in your room peeking out the door. He enters the house and sees the box. He opens it finds the note and reads it. He exclaims “Thanks Will!” He gets the magic socks Will leave at the couch besides the loafers. He says “This look so expensive even these socks they’re perfect! He puts on the shoes. Happy he accidentally trips and he spots Will. He screams “WHO ARE YOU!!!! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MY SON??!”<br />
Will quickly goes down and explain to his dad wih only 1 shoe. He is confused but then he understand after a moment of hard thinking. Then he requests Will to let him be him and wants Will to be him forever. Will is in shock. He says no and put on the magical socks and your loafers pulling them of your dad. You finish putting them on, they wont turn him back, he tries his other family members’ shoes they work when going back to other bodies. He cant revert back. As Will mentally cries. He tells his father that he can be hi, forever and that he can be him forever. He exclaims “Really!” with an excited face. Will gives him the loafers and magic socks after reverting back to his body. He puts them on and in a short moment he starts turning into Will. He excitedly says “Thanks son! This is the best birthday present ever.” His transformation is complete you startwearing each others clothes. They start acting like eachother to practice being eachother near the people they know. Will drink his dad’s beer and watch football on tv shirtless stroking his new chest hair. Will’s dad starts reading books and checking out clothes online. His dad goes to the living room he says “I think I’m gonna like being you I’m starting to like the things you like” Will says to his dad “No problem dad” While getting bored watching Football he shouts “YEAHH!!!” While jumping up as his dad’s favorite team gets a point. Will feels wierd. His dad goes down he starts finding all the things he liked interesting. They ignore it for awhile then Will uncontiously get another beer and drink it, then he shouts “Come On!!!” at the Tv as his Dad’s favorite team is starting to lose. He calls his Dad unconciously calling him Will “WIILLLL!!!” Will’s dad says “What Dad!?” The two are shocked. Shocked his Dad goes down running screaming “WHATS HAPPENING!??!” and shouts when he goes down “You better explain yourSELF DAD!!” They are getting more shocked. Both of the, get a headache without thinking Will grab’s a beer and his dad grabs a magazine about videogames. Will cant move neither can his dad and his other hand grabs the remote and puts it back on football. They start having simoultaneaous headaches you and your dad get eachothers personalities and they go to their old rooms. Will looks at a picture of his family and feels atracted to his Mom. Will and his Dad go to each other in the living room with their bodies respective personalities. Will talks to his dad like a middle aged man as his dad is 40 they keep getting shocked. Will starts watching football like his dad did with a beer shirtless and strocking his chest hair. While Will’s Dad is on the couch texting Will’s best friends they are confused yet entertained in eachothers interests both of them go next to eachother only 2ft apart in the couch as they both starting holding their heads. Their eyes are swirly as if they were in a hypnotic state. They both get flashes of memories belonging to the respective bodies and forget their real memories as Will and his Dad are fully converting Will and his dad stand up and start moving around as if they are dizzy holding their heads with both hands. As they finnaly convert Will now with all his Dad’s memories and his dad’s personality, body, and his dad’s likes dislikes and interests without the momory from a few hours ago and from his old body goes to the kitchen gets a beer and goes to continue watching the FootBall. While Will’s Dad in Will’s Body has the same thing happened says to Will in his Dad’s body “Dad lets play football!” As Will didnt like football before maybe he is making Will’s dad follow his Dad’s footsteps.<br />
(I will now refer to Will in his Dad’s body as Will’s Dad and Wills Dad in Wills body as Will)<br />
Will’s Dad says yes and they play football. As rhey finish Will’s Dad brings a cooler and says to Will “Come on son, have a drink so you can be like your great father.” As Will with a bit of Will’s Dad’s personality and interests staying and growing like his Dad’s. Will dad a few days later starts following in his dad’s footsteps he is becoming a bit more muscular and fatty and watches foot ball like his dad.</p>
