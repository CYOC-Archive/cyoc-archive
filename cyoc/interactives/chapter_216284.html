<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Maybe just a little more...&quot; The temptation was too big. Though, he for now only decided to increase the size of the udder, not the dicks. <br />
Thus he carefully sat down again in front of his pc, needing to spread his legs a little to even sit properly with the mass hanging from his groin. And as he pulled up the Chronivac, he soon did increase the size if the udder on his model. He didn&#39;t know how much bigger at first. It already was pretty big... Thus he at first only added a little more weight and size to it. It looked a little bigger on the model now, sure... But just a little more wouldn&#39;t hurt. As such, he did add half of its original size more to it then. Now it was definitely going to be larger and manageable at that. But it should still look round and full as well. Thus he did ensure that it was going to be filled to the brim as well - leading to it looking a little more veiny than before as well. <br />
And then he pressed &#39;Accept Changes&#39; as he immediately began to stroke and touch his udder then. Sean could feel it grow bigger and fuller, it causing him to have to spread his legs even further as it gained a lot more size to it. Even the pleasure it brought felt as though it had increased. <br />
But the fuller it got, the more he felt as if he was going to be driven mad if he didn&#39;t cum. Yet the only way to do so was by milking himself, which only turned him on even more. Taking hold of two of his members again, he immediately began to jerk off with all his might, the growing udder continuing to add more lust to him alongside the need to just milk himself and basically cum that way.<br />
When the udder stopped growing, it was now definitely looking even more obscenely huge on him, but it would still be manageable despite the sheer mass of it. Yet Sean didn&#39;t care about that. He only cared about milking himself as much as he could until he arched his back and let out a loud moan once he finally felt relief. He&#39;s never felt like this before.. At this rate, he didn&#39;t need this to be an experiment anymore. He was fully willing to stay like this. It felt far too good to just go back to normal again.<br />
Though, when he finally calmed down, he sat up and carefully tried to send, nearly falling back to his knees due to weight of the udder alongside the instant pleasure it brought him to feel it get slightly pressed against by his thighs. To think he&#39;d feel this turned on by his own dick... That&#39;s what the udder technically was now after all. <br />
However, he needed something to wear now. And thus he did move to his closet to find at least the baggiest pair of pants he had - one he used to at times go jogging with in the past. It was easy to pull them up but it was far more complicated to even stuff anything in them from the udder. He could only fit the dick-teats and barely even half of it in the pants and the redt he could only barely pull up to even cover his butt. Thus the only solution was for him to grab the longest and loosest shirt he had to put on next to cover the remaining part of his udder, him tsking a sharp breath every time he moved. Fuck, just the fabric pressing against him so tightly like that sent shivers down his spine. It felt way too good. If it kept up like this, all four of his dicks would stand erect again.... <br />
But he had to go about his day as normally as possible right now. His roommates would be back soon after all. And thus he did move to get his room cleaned up first and put his other clothes in the laundry. But during this he could tell that even walking was something he had to get used to again, it was as if he had to walk with his legs further spread apart to make it more comfortable. And yet it just excited him all the more.<br />
Thus as he finally was done, he decided to just go and sit down in the living room while he had grabbed his pc. Who said he couldn&#39;t try to make more chabges while he was chilling there? Especially since he wanted to test - after seeing Jay and Dan&#39;s reactions to his new &#39;package&#39; - whether they would also act that it&#39;s normal if he changed anything about himself right in front of them. <br />
And when he heard the sound of keys outside, Sean couldn&#39;t help but smirk. They were finally back and he could test just how the program made them &#39;not notice&#39; his changes.</p>
