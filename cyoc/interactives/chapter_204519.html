<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mitch had basically forgotten about the magical wishing amulet still in his pocket. Well, he didn&#39;t really forget about it but in that moment he wasn&#39;t really thinking about it. As the beautiful Karissa fell asleep on his lap, he was just caressing her soft shoulder length dark hair and he was getting a bit sleepy himself. His mind began to wander back to that gay guy Nathan and what happened with him. Sure, the guy was a bit unhinged for wanting to basically destroy his relationship with Karissa and steal Mitch for himself. He didn&#39;t care Mitch was a straight man and in a relationship with a beautiful young woman, Karissa, but can you really blame him for trying to get what he wanted? Did he really deserve his fate of Mitch turning him into a donkey? An animal that cannot even speak! <br />
<br />
Why did Mitch even do such a harsh thing to him? For Karissa, for his relationship with her? Mitch thought about what Karissa meant to him, was she really all that great, really? She&#39;s a decent enough person, sure, but she has her flaws, she even cheated to Mitch once and he still didn&#39;t really forgives her for that. Nathan seemed like a really loyal guy in the short time spent with him, it seemed he really, really liked Mitch and he had a more interesting personality too... Karissa is just so...basic. A basic albeit good looking, straight white girl. Nathan on the other hand was a flamboyant, vibrant, mixed race (black mostly) gay guy. Even if Mitch sees himself as a straight guy, he wanted to be fair. Nathan was a more exciting person that Karissa and he kind of wished, on a whim while looking at his sleeping girlfriend, that Nathan was here with him instead of her... to see him again and talk to him, apologize for what he did to him. <br />
<br />
The magical amulet reacted to this honest desire and glowed faintly in his pocket. In that moment Karissa moaned softly in her sleep as she began morphing right under Mitch&#39;s eyes. Her straight long hair curled up tightly and shortened quickly into a short masculine crop, turning fully black. Her shoulders widen as she grows taller and bulkier very fast, her white skin darkening to a brown in the process. Karissa&#39;s muscles expanded and toned up into an athletic and fully masculine physique, erasing all traces of the woman she was a few seconds ago. With her breasts converting into hard pecs and her chest barreling out, as well as the overall increase in body size, her tight short dress began straining and ripping at the seams. She groans again in a deepening voice and Mitch observes the shape of a manly bulge beginning to form under the thin satin dress right at her crotch. Mitch wasn&#39;t dumb, he figured it out by now that the amulet was changing Karissa into a man, into Nathan specifically, so of course he didn&#39;t act shocked when he saw the inappropriate bulge forming. A lady shouldn&#39;t have a bulge under her dress, blah blah. No, Mitch didn&#39;t think that. He thought &quot;Well yeah if Karissa is gonna become a man she SHOULD grow a cock and testicles, duh!&quot; So he watches in calm fascination as the cock snakes out into a long hard shape and tents the short dress at first, then fully raising it up and bunching it against Karissa&#39;s hard muscular stomach. This reveals the new male anatomy in it&#39;s full glory, since Karissa&#39;s thin black panties overstretched could do nothing to contain either the big hairy balls nor the impressive black dick she just grew. Mitch smiled in impressed approval at Karissa&#39;s proud, veiny erection and patted her on the shoulder, careful not to wake her up. &quot;Congrats on your first erection Karissa, heh heh&quot; Karissa lets out another pained grunt as her facial structure cracks and snaps, skin darkening while the entire face rearranges into a perfect copy of Nathan&#39;s. <br />
Finally, the amulet&#39;s magic morphs Karissa&#39;s ruined red dress and pumps into an outfit Nathan would wear. Checkered slacks, cuffs rolled up the ankles, loafers, a tidy white dress shirt and a paisley bowtie. <br />
<br />
The transformation was complete. Mitch didn&#39;t do this intentionally but the reality is that it happened. Karissa now looks exactly like Nathan and is still sleeping in Mitch&#39;s lap, her new stylish slacks still tented by her new black cock... What will Mitch do when she wakes up? Is she still even Karissa? Does she just look like Nathan or did she become Nathan fully? And if she did and this is just Nathan now, what happened to Karissa? That would mean Mitch basically killed her... Mitch shakes his head at this dark thought. <br />
<br />
He thinks about just using the amulet again to willingly wish her back to normal, that would be the right thing to do, right? Sure... but as he looks into Karissa&#39;s serene, sleeping face he hesitates. Sure, she is still unaware she&#39;s been changed into a man but she just looks so peaceful and blissful in her sleep! Well, yeah the face he&#39;s looking at is technically Nathan&#39;s, not Karissa&#39;s, but the thought of this handsome young man sleeping in his arms actually being his beautiful girlfriend had some appeal to Mitch. He was curious to how she&#39;d react to being a guy when she wakes up, and being a different race too, hell being someone else entirely! It would be fascinating to see how it plays out, he can&#39;t just turn her back to normal just like that! <br />
<br />
Mitch smiles a bit perversely and tousles Karissa&#39;s new short curly buzzcut slowly. He knew she loved it when he played with her hair and apparently this hasn&#39;t changed. Karissa&#39;s new face smiles and she lets out a slow, satisfied and relaxed moan. The voice of course was deep and manly but she didn&#39;t seem to realize in her slumber. If she realized, she certainly didn&#39;t mind. Mitch caresses her cheek softly eliciting more deep moans and giggles. She then reaches a hand up to her neck, finding the tight bowtie and collar. She pulled at it lazily trying to loosen the unfamiliar tightness. Mitch realized as Karissa squirmed that the tight bowtie and shirt collar wasn&#39;t ideal for sleeping in, so even if it looked very nice and handsome, he carefully undoes the knot and opens up the collar, letting the tie hang around Karissa&#39;s neck. <br />
She sighed in relief and instinctively went straight for her crotch and instead of flinching she just starts massaging her erection, smiling happily. Mitch thought that clearly this was just sexual instinct, she doesn&#39;t consciously know she became a man yet, but in her sleep that didn&#39;t really matter, her body just did what came natural. She looked super happy indeed, but how will she feel when she wakes up?</p>
