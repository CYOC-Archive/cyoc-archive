<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stepping out of the car, Karii ran as fast as she could in 4&quot; heels. When she got the text from her sister earlier that day, she was busy at work, but managed to convince her manager to let her leave early due to a &quot;family emergency&quot;. Karii worked part time for her college&#39;s art hall as a &quot;living midel&quot;. Basically she would present student&#39;s clothing designs, model for students to sketch her, pose for images, etc. Today&#39;s job happened to require her to help display a scene depicting a rich women at the beach for the first time&quot;, or something. She didn&#39;t really care about the details, she just new that she had to wear a bikini and heels for her part. It was going well, until she got the text. <br />
<br />
For starters, Jen never texts her in the morning, especially on a school day. She knows she works in her mornings, and both agreed that unless it is really bad, please dont bother her with texts as it disrupts her job if she has to answer it. So with that alone, karii knew she had to leave work. She never even read the text until she got into her car. Not that what was there was any different that what she expected. Just a single ine of text.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need you both over at the house asap!!&quot; <br />
<br />
Seems like another person was involved, and most likely it was Susan. Karii met Susan a few times, and easily could tell she had a thing for her sister. Jen however never seemed to pick up on it too well though. Karii even had helped her once by having a few beers &quot;go missing&quot; at her last birthday, so Susan could possibly go further with Jen. She already knew Susan was an experienced drinker since her family always let her have beer while she was home. And she knew she wouldn&#39;t hurt Jen or take it too far. But nothing became of it, so she had not heard about her for a while. <br />
<br />
Entering the house, she dopped her bags and quickly ran to Jen&#39;s room. No one else was home since both their parents worked fairly early in the morning, and their maid was gone for the day, having taken the day off. When she got to her sister&#39;s door, she could hear some kind of noise from within. Knocking, she called out to Jen &quot;hey, I&#39;m here, mind if I come in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can, but please don&#39;t freak out&quot; she heard her sister reply.<br />
<br />
Openimg the door, she found her sister curled up on her side, on the floor. Well, at least something that looked similar to Jen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is that you Jen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; said Jen while silently crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to you?&quot; Asked Karii still taking in her sisters new appearance. Her once cute sister, now had a full udder, huge boobs, cow ears, and a tail. Honestly, all of it only made her cuter in her opinion. She quickly started to become a bit jealous of her. It had been one of her dreams to become a cowgirl. She even has been secretly crafting a special cowgirl suit for herself at college with the help of some of the art students, which she promised to model for them when it was finished. But Jen had actually managed to become the real deal.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was cursed, and now I look like this.&quot; Jen said while still crying. <br />
<br />
Moving over to her, Karii sat down besides her sister and began stroking her ears, trying to calm her down. They were really soft, and she felt like she could rub them all day. They were definitely real cow ears. They even twitched and everything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mooooooo&quot; <br />
<br />
Startled, Karii released the ear and pulled back her hand. &quot;D-did you just moo?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I couldn&#39;t help it. You were rubbing my ears and, well, it felt really good, so, it just slipped out.&quot; Jen said, no longer sobbing, but now very embarrised. &quot;Hey, don&#39;t laugh at me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unable to keep her composure, Karii started to laugh at her sister&#39;s embarrassment, all while apologizing. &quot;Sorry, sorry, it was just too cute and it caught me off guard.&quot;<br />
<br />
However, what she was thinking was: &quot;She&#39;s just too cute when she gets embarrassed. And her moo was adorable. I want to stroke her ears more. How does her milk taste? Does she now eat grass? Is her tail also soft? I want to touch it. No, she already is feeling bad, so I can&#39;t just enjoy myself. Ahhh, why is she the lucky one who gets to be a cowgirl?&quot; As a wave of conflicting emotions and interests ran through her. But first things first, she had to help her sister calm down, and make sure she is ok.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you hurt anywhere? Or is anything pressing, that needs to be addressed immediatly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing immediately, and I am not in any pain at all. Its just, I don&#39;t want to be a cowgirl like you do. At least not one permanently.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Care to explain the full curse to me? I can get the gist of it from how you look, but is there anything else?&quot; Asked a now concerned Karii, hoping to better hide her apparently obvious jealousy for her sisters situation.<br />
<br />
After hearing the full details, Karii was surprised. Jen really got an odd curse. Having to rely on her best friend for the rest of her life to do a lot of things which normally she could have easily done herself will take a lot of getting use to. And the fact that she won&#39;t be able to use the curse for herself also sucks. However, the fact that after a week everyone but her, Susan and this Kyle kid will think everything is more or less normal, and even she herself will come to love her new body, to the point it sexually excites her, was not as bad sounding. The shitting uncontrollably part would take a lot of getting use to for her. It clearly would take a toll on her pride. <br />
<br />
The worst part was, she could not use the curse herself to fix this. And after a week, she would never want to. Even Susan could not help her in this reguard since she will be immediatly cursed to become her caretaker. <br />
<br />
While pondering this, Karii&#39;s hand had somehow made its way to Jen&#39;s tail, and was now softly stroking it. Jen was going to say something, but it honestly felt too amazing, especially the base where it connected to her lower back, that she just decided to let it happen. It helped calm her down also. But she was starting to get the urge to moo again. <br />
<br />
Mentally tired, Jen moved herself over so that she was laying down with her head resting on her sister&#39;s thighs. Her one ear sinking in between them. Thankful for her sister&#39;s obsession with wearing mini skirts because it allowed for their cool and smooth texture to be exposed and felt by her ear. Even when her sister started to rub her exposed ear, Jen didn&#39;t move. She was now too comfortable to move.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mooooooo&quot; moaned Jen quietly, trying hard not to ruin the moment. <br />
<br />
However, it was too late. She could hear her sister snickering, trying desperatly to surpress her laughter. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mooooooo&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Mooooooo&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mooooooo&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen figured she best just not worry about the mood anymore. Her sister was sure to break any second, and besides, mooing felt good.</p>
