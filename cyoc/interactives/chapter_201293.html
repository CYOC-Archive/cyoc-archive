<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric and Nate both soon return home after their parents picked them up part of the way back. Their parents were unusually quiet as they drove back. Both Eric and Nate knew they were in trouble, Nate most of all. He was the one to get the Lunar Ecstasy. <br />
<br />
As they pulled into their garage and the garage door closed. Derek places the car in park and turns it off. Both parents then turn around and looked at their children. <br />
<br />
“First. We are happy that the two of you are safe.” Maggie begins. <br />
<br />
“But that doesn’t excuse the two of you from what happen.” Derek continues. “Nate. How could you? You know that the drug is illegal. And you brought it into the house to use it. On top of that, your brother was exposed and changed as well. Into a… a… I don’t know what to call it. An animal? An Werebeast.” <br />
<br />
“Sorry.” Nate replies. <br />
<br />
Maggie points her finger at Nate. “Now is not the time for sorry. You are in massive trouble. Damn, what would you two be doing now if the police would have found you and shot at you. Or some random person seeing you running across their yard and pulled a gun. You two could have been killed. I know the news said that the stuff can make you horny, but you had enough sense to strip. We would have rather you stayed home and jacked off.” <br />
<br />
Their mom was pissed, but her last statement came across to the boys as being funning and they both started to snicker. This only made their mom more pissed. <br />
<br />
“Honey, dear.” Derek says to his wife. “Maybe giving the boys permission to play with themselves is not the best way to show our disappointment.” <br />
<br />
Maggie backed off some as Derek took over. “But your mother is right. You two could have died out there… or worse. Did you two have any sex last night?” <br />
<br />
Both brothers looked at each other before attempting to say no, but their mother beat them to it. “Oh damn. Lets hope there wont be little wolves and tigers in six months that we have to worry about.” <br />
<br />
“You two are grounded for the foreseeable future. Other then at school, you will me with one of us until we can trust the two of you. Nate, you will also lose your driving privileges, minus just what you need to get your license. That means no staying over at friends and no hanging out.” <br />
<br />
“Don’t be too hard on Eric, it was my Lunar that made him change.” Nate tries to plead with his parents for his younger brother. <br />
<br />
“No. We are being easy on you because you quickly realize how all of this affected your bother this morning. Even then, your brother ran away just as you did. You can blame the transformation all you want, but that doesn’t change the fact that is was still your individual actions.” Maggie tells them. <br />
<br />
Both boys just nodded before being let inside the house. Eric quickly went upstairs to shower as Nate and Derek followed. Maggie started making some food downstairs as the Derek had another talk with the boys. <br />
<br />
“I know you said it was worth it when we asked this morning, but would you answer the same way now?” Derek asks Nate. “Was taking the drug worth it. Having sex with some stranger? Having your fourteen-year-old brother have sex with some stranger?” <br />
<br />
Eric starts washing off as Nate answered. “Yes and no. I didn’t mean for Nate to be involved, but I did know who I was with. And it was amazing at the time. I felt like… I… I could be me.” <br />
<br />
“Do we know who this person is?” Derek asked. “Did they get you the Lunar Ecstasy?” <br />
<br />
“It was Casey, and no, he didn’t get it for me, and he didn’t take it.” Nate replied. <br />
<br />
Eric stops scrubbing for a moment and popped his head out of the shower. “Dude!! You’re gay?” <br />
<br />
“I guess.” Nate answered. “I don’t know. It just felt so right. I felt in control too.” Nate looked down at his father’s feet waiting for a response. No one in their family came out as gay before. <br />
<br />
“I guess we need to have a talk with Casey the next time we have a chance. Does his parents know?” Derek replies with compassion. <br />
“No. I mean, I don’t think so. We always talked about girls. This just kind of happened. He was willing, and so was I.” Nate says. <br />
<br />
“Okay, then we will cross that bridge when we get to it. For now, we will plan on talking to him and seeing if the two of you are willing to see where this new relationship will take you.” Derek says. <br />
<br />
“So, you are fine with me being gay.” Nate asks. <br />
<br />
“You being gay, Yes. You are my son, and I will always support you. How you came about finding out you are gay, no.” Derek says. “Now for you.” There was and audible squeak from Eric as he hides back in the shower. “Who did you have sex with?” <br />
<br />
“A hot Lioness?” Eric mutters under the water. <br />
<br />
“And does this Lioness have a name?” Derek asks. <br />
<br />
“Hot Lioness Girl?” Eric replies. <br />
<br />
“Well crap.” Derek replies. “From you, I am surprised. You have always been the quiet one. Now you are having sex with random people. Finish your shower and eat your breakfast when your mom brings it to you. The rest of the day, you will be under our watchful eyes.” <br />
After that, the day went on slowly. Nate and Eric took care of some homework at the kitchen table as their parents took turns watching them. After that, they spent the rest of the afternoon in the living room as playing games as their parents watched on. As it got close to dinner and the sun went down, Maggie went to the kitchen to work on dinner as Derek watch the boys. As the boys finished with their current game, both boys then felt a heat come over them.  <br />
<br />
“Dad. Is it hot in here to you?” Nate asks. <br />
<br />
“No, you know your mom likes it cold. Reminds her of home in Alaska.” Derek replies. <br />
<br />
“I’m a little hot too.” Eric replies as he starts wiping his forehead. <br />
<br />
Then both boys let out a low moan as they reached for the groins. Derek looks on as he sees both his boys’ pants start to tent up as their penis harden into boners.<br />
<br />
“So tight.” Nate says as he unzips his pants to let out his penis. Eric follows suit, unzipping and letting his penis out in the air. <br />
<br />
The cool air of the house did nothing for the raging hard-ons the boys had. Derek calls for Maggie as both boys start moaning harder. As Maggie walks in wondering what was happening, both boys start moaning louder. <br />
<br />
“What’s happening? We watched them all day.” Maggie says. <br />
<br />
“Maybe an after effect of the drug.” Derek replied. <br />
<br />
Just then, both boys grabbed at their penis as if to hold them back. Nate’s starts stretching upwards, turning red and growing both a knot and a sheath. His ball also starts inflating in his pants, becoming visible outlines in his pants. <br />
<br />
Eric’s penis starts thickening as it starched outwards. Small barbs start popping out as it took a more pinkish tent. His balls also start straining his pants as the inflate to a new size.<br />
<br />
“Boys, up to your rooms quick. And don’t leave the house.” Derek commands. <br />
<br />
All the brothers could do is nod in agreement and start to stand up. As they stood, their clothes started to become tighter on their growing bodies. Both Nate and Eric start striping as they ran to the stairs and up to their rooms. As they took off their clothes, Nate started growing in his brown wolf fur as Eric started growing both black and orange tiger fur. Kicking off their shoes, their parents could see their feet stretch and grow. Toes grew claws as their feet grew pads. <br />
<br />
As they worked their way up the stairs, their fingernails turned to claws and hands to paws, making scratch marks into the wall. As their pants dropped to the stairs, Derek and Maggie saw their sons’ balls outline the bottom of their underwear as nubs start protruding from the top their butts. They also saw all the pre-cum starting to leak from the two boys ever growing manhoods, dripping on the floor.<br />
<br />
As they reached the top of the stairs and into their doorframes, both boys grabbed tightly to the frame as the last of the changes took over. Their faces pushed forward as their ears grew out and to the top of their heads. Their bodies hit one more growth spirt, ripping to shreds their last bits of clothes. Both of them then hit their climax, cumming all over the floor in their doorway. Wave after wave splattered as the brother’s surprised parents watched on from behind. Nate howled as Eric roared until finally both boys, now larger then their parents, fell to a knee in their doorway.</p>
