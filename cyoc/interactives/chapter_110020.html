<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">*I&#39;m not back back, just had some free time to write a chapter - bj88<br />
<br />
A brief knock and the smell of a male panther at the door told the Andersons and company that Lance Knight was there to pick Frieda. William went to answer the door, and was surprised to see a female at Lance&#39;s side. A weretiger based on her scent. The two were clearly a couple, they smelled just as much of sex as everyone else in the house (with the exception of Nate). <br />
<br />
&quot;Morning Mr. Anderson.&quot; Lance said. He was wearing a modest suit, modest compared to his brother&#39;s wardrobe that is. To the Andersons, it was still pretty high end. A $350 suit from EXPRESS was a bit out of William&#39;s price range on a teacher&#39;s salary. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, and there&#39;s no need for the Mr. Anderson. Just call me William. May I ask who your female companion is?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Lila Carpenter, I&#39;m work for the Council. I&#39;ll be at the hearing.&quot; Lila said, offering her hand to the werefox, which William accepted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Pleasure to meet you. I suppose I should get....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Uncle Lance!&quot; Frieda appeared behind William, emerging from the kitchen, with her boyfriend and girlfriend close behind. They all took notice of the attractive female weretiger standing beside Lance. Frieda immediately recognized this as her future aunt. <br />
<br />
“Hi, you must be Lila. It’s nice to finally meet you.” Frieda said, beaming at the weretiger. Frieda had to admit, Lila was pretty hot. If she wasn’t already bonded to Spencer and Eric, she might have expressed interest in Lila. But those days of being single were over, and Frieda was more than happy with her feline and hybrid lovers. <br />
<br />
“You as well. Unfortunate circumstances, but a pleasure nonetheless.” Lila said. <br />
<br />
“Are mother and father meeting us there?” Frieda asked, noting her parents absence. <br />
<br />
“Yes. Your father apparently needed the morning to get ready.” Lance said with a slight eye roll. Benton was so metrosexual, even if he didn’t realize it. <br />
<br />
“Anyway, did you have a good night Frieda?” Lance had a feeling he already knew the answer, based on the sly smirks the teenagers were sharing with each other. <br />
<br />
&quot;I imagine it was as enjoyable as your night was.&quot; Frieda replied. Spencer muttered something to Eric that made him smirk even wider. William didn&#39;t hear a word, but based on Eric&#39;s reaction (and the slight tent in his pants) he&#39;d say it was more dirty talk. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I think it&#39;s time to get moving people. Before we get distracted.&quot; William looks knowingly at his son. Eric blushes and goes to get his things for the day. Lance and Lila walk Frieda to the car, while the Andersons prepare to follow them. Nate and Spencer of course are off to school, and say their goodbyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give that skank hell for me.&quot; Spencer says, kissing both Eric&#39;s and Frieda&#39;s cheeks before she followed Nate. <br />
<br />
“You know we will.” Frieda said <br />
<br />
She and Nate walk to the latter&#39;s car. Eric waves from the doorway, wishing Spencer could be there for some added moral support. He would have liked to have the other half of their yin/yang with him. This was Julie they were talking about, Eric wasn&#39;t sure what to expect. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry Eric, nothing&#39;s going to happen. Julie may be stupid, but hopefully she has enough sense not to attack us in front of half a dozen adult weres. Besides, merfolk are useless on land. What is she going to do to you, fish-slap you?&quot; Frieda said, sensing Eric&#39;s uneasiness. She squeezes his hand before climbing into the backseat of her uncle&#39;s car. <br />
<br />
“Are you ready to go Eric?” Martha comes up to her youngest son and puts a supportive hand on his shoulder. <br />
<br />
“Yes.” Eric sighed. <br />
<br />
“And hopefully this will be the end of my troubles with Julie.” he thought as he walked to the car, his parents on either side of him. <br />
<br />
--------------------------------<br />
<br />
Meanwhile…<br />
<br />
Julie’s foul mood only got that much worse when she and her parents got into the car. Every time Martin or Melissa would glance back at their daughter, she would glare at them. They couldn’t understand why she was behaving like this. They were only trying to help her, and Julie was just making things more difficult. Everything she’d done thus far, from openly threatening Eric, to her shenanigans on the internet, and her unpleasant, to say the least, attitude toward every authority figure who came in contact with her. <br />
<br />
“I hope to god our next child doesn’t turn out like Julie.” Melissa thought, touching her belly instinctively. Martin would be turning over a new leaf, that would undoubtedly help. Melissa still worried that whatever genes Julie had that were making her act so crazy would be inherited by her yet-to-be-identified sibling. <br />
<br />
Martin had similar worries. While driving his family to the Elder Council, Martin wondered if his “bad” genes would be passed on to his offspring. He’d wasted so much time cheating on his wife, the woman he’d gladly take a bullet for. Why he mistreated Melissa so, for so long, Martin really couldn’t say anymore. At the time his excuses made sense. Now he couldn’t be more ashamed of himself. <br />
<br />
“If I have a boy I’ll do everything in my power to teach to treat women right. Or men, there’s always the possibility of that. Would be a first for the family, but it can always happen,” Martin thought. Mer were typically straight, sometimes bisexual, but rarely gay. <br />
<br />
Then there was Julie, who seemed to get angrier and more frustrated with every passing second. She tried not to think about her recent nightmares, but they kept resurfacing in her mind. Not for one second did she believe that her future would consist of pimps, prostitution and failed relationships. She was Julie-fucking-Stovall. She could have her choice of partners. She could seduce anyone, even Eric Anderson. Who would have been hers if he hadn’t seen her with Brian. And then, Julie would have been able to turn him if Frieda hadn’t gotten in the way. <br />
<br />
“I know exactly what I’m going to do. I’m not leaving Moon Lake until I make them pay for fucking my life up. Then it’s a straight shot down the coast to Mexico. They’ll never find me, not even my stupid parents. They don’t care about me, they don’t care about anything. Mom’s such a tight-ass, and Dad’s a hypocrite. I’m sick of them telling me how to live my life.” Julie thought. <br />
<br />
And as the Stovalls pulled into the parking lot, they realized they were in for a very awkward encounter. Getting out of their own cars were Frieda and Eric, accompanied by their family.</p>
