<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Earlier that day... <br />
<br />
Michael was trying to fix his car. Everything that needed to be fixed was minor but it was all he could do. his job as a mechanical engineer was out due to the virus. with no other excuses, he was forced to fix his white car. he&#39;d been putting off fixing it as he had other things to do at the time.  <br />
<br />
now every little thing bugged him. so he decided to fix the problems. a lot of the problems were caused by burnt-out spark plugs. he was currently trying to fix the radio when it began spitting out a song at a loud volume. he tried to focus on fixing it but the song was the one he and Ashley danced to on their 3rd date.  <br />
<br />
the song began bringing more and more memories of love. each one getting more arousing. his pants were soon tented by his cock. his balls were also filling up the space between his legs. In his lust-filled mind, Michael dropped his tools and went for his jeans.  <br />
<br />
he pulled the zipper down so fast it broke. this causes his now 9-inch cock to pop out still in his black boxers. he didn&#39;t care as he began jacking off. his dad&#39;s body quickly changed into a lean muscular body. while his changes were over (at least the first part) Micheal didn&#39;t want it to end.  <br />
<br />
it had felt so amazing. looking at his still hard cock he ginned. &quot;doubt I&#39;d hold out for a vaccine. who knows I could get an awesome monster outfit from it&quot; he chuckled as he gripped his cock as it swelled to a foot long. his balls grew to match.  <br />
<br />
at first, Mike didn&#39;t feel any different, good but not different. however, he soon felt a numbness in his feet. looking down he saw his feet had been absorbed by the floor of his car. suddenly he felt every inch of his car. touching any part inside felt like he was touching himself.  <br />
<br />
the trunk of his... no of Mike began to shift and change. he could hear a mechanical noise as he suddenly felt his feet. he couldn&#39;t see them but he felt three toes wiggle. the bottoms had black rubber padding like his tires. speaking of his entire back began to reshape into plates of white metal and grey wires.   <br />
<br />
As this happened his legs sunk into his seat. he soon found his pelvis sink into his seat as the car&#39;s position shifted his knees which soon became shock absorbers and wires. covering it was what was now his kneecap. he soon found himself in an awkward position as his penis was absorbed. the car&#39;s back wheels became his hip joint and the axle his pelvis.  <br />
<br />
his exhaust pipe melted and reformed on his crotch. below his balls now became his &#39;gas&#39; tank and speedometer. a display grew on both of them. the white metal now protected them. his former exhaust pipe grew into a 3-foot dick.  <br />
<br />
it had white metal on top and smooth black rubber on the bottom. a metal ring grew right beneath the tip. said tip was now an odd mix of metal and rubber. he soon found the main body of his car shrinking and confirming as metal rearranged. a sudden sense of panic caused him to try to get out.   <br />
<br />
he realized too late that this couldn&#39;t be avoided. he let out a moan of pain as his hood hit the door to the garage. his torso was now just his pecs. his undercarriage is now protected by black metal abs. his organ&#39;s purpose and the car&#39;s functions merge into each other.  <br />
<br />
in one fell swoop his pecs were absorbed. quickly the engine went to the center of his chest. its pistons now work like a heartbeat allowing Michael to live. an oblong pentagon-shaped hole showed his new heart. a grill covering and protecting it.  <br />
<br />
once his shoulders were absorbed his tires shifted to become them. he wasn&#39;t quite sure what his new arms came from but they seemed to look like his legs but for arms of course. once his hands were absorbed he quickly grabbed his cock as he wanted to see properly again. being just a head in your own body was too weird. the gas meter rose as did the speed.  <br />
<br />
his fingers had black rubber-covered joints for knuckles allowing such a feat. soon he cumed black goo onto the garage. he raised his new head and once again hit it. this time on a now splintered support beam. he suddenly wanted to check himself out.  <br />
<br />
a huge screen covered his vision. it showed him his new car robot body. his side mirrors had become his ears. the speakers of the car were in his neck allowing him to speak. speaking of his neck kind of looked thick and dinosaur-like.  <br />
<br />
probably to help hold his head. his face was now the car front. he blinked his head light eyes and the HUD screen disappeared. he looked around the now smaller garage with his light blue eyes. &#39;I must have gotten my car&#39;s size.&#39; the 13-foot robot said.  <br />
<br />
suddenly he heard the side door handle jiggle. sadly it seemed his black cum acted like an adhesive. the door refused to even budge for whoever was trying to open it. looking back at the garage door Mike realized just how dented it was. &quot;no point in fixing it if I can&#39;t even get out.&quot; he said while still crouched.  <br />
<br />
he decided to throw his shoulder into it. it took a few times but eventually, the metal door broke and he was freed. in front of him were two identical men wearing his clothing. speaking of Mike casually opened his side and yanked his old clothing and tools out of him. guessing who these were he said &quot;Hey kids looks like your old man got his dream car&quot; If he still had a mouth he would have smiled.  <br />
<br />
suddenly they were aware of a noise coming from the garage&#39;s side door. if these were formerly Zoe and Molly then Ashley must be... Before he could continue his thoughts a long light brown tail appeared. it looked reptilian. suddenly they all heard a roar as what was Ashley rose from behind the garage. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
in front of the mall, a group of 12 men and women were dressed in hazmat suits. one of them stepped in front and addressed the team. &quot;okay everyone our goal is acquiring a sample from the meteorite. it is located in the flooded sub-basement. we will separate into teams of 6. Walter and I will be leading the teams.&quot; they then separated into their groups. <br />
<br />
&quot;I will enter through the main entrance while Walter will enter through the garage. we have no clue what has happened inside so be careful,&quot; Officer Smith said as the group split off. looking at the mall&#39;s sign he saw it was already being changed. the clear water became the same sickly green color as the water inside. the beautiful flowers soon became thorny brambles with unidentifiable bulb heads.  <br />
<br />
a sudden snap from one of them made a woman on his team jump back. they passed the destroyed half-circle blacktop and mushrooms. Judging by those plants near the sign the flora and fauna weren&#39;t just for decoration. back at the sign letters broke off. glowing moss covered one of the words. Passion Square mall was now pass*on ______ *all.</p>
