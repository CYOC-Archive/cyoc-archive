<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was around seven o'clock when Jake started to wake up.  The sun was shinning in through the gaps in his curtains, but it was enough to light up the room.  Reluctantly, Jake opened one eye to see the time, and promptly shut it.  Even after his nap with Drake, and going to bed on time, he was still tired from hanging out with Drake all day.  He knew his alarm would be going off in another twenty minutes, so he rolled over to turn it off.  Or, he would have, if he could've moved his whole body.  It felt like his entire left side was numb.  When he looked over to see what the problem was, he saw Kyle's face right next to his head.  Suddenly warm air on his ear made sense.<br />
<br />
Jake wasn't sure why Kyle was back in his room, and not stuck with Kyle.  He was really hoping they didn't get mad and have a fight.  Jake pushed that thought out of his mind, just as he was trying to push kyle off of him.  Jake kept scooting to the right, but Kyle just kept being pulled with him.  &quot;Kyle?&quot; Jake whispered softly, &quot;Kyle, are you awake?&quot;  With no response, Jake gently nudged him with his hand. &quot;Hey, Kyle! wake up!&quot;  It must have worked, because Kyle grunted and rolled over.  Jake panicked and yelped as he was pulled up and over Kyle, landing face first on the very edge of his pillow.<br />
<br />
It was then that Jake realized why Kyle was laying so close.  He looked over and saw Kyle with one eye open, staring back, &quot;Hey Jake.&quot;  Kyle mumbled into the pillow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Kyle.&quot;  Jake did his best to lift his half up, but it was hard for him, with the extra weight of Kyle, and only half the strength.  He could tell Kyle didn't want to get up, so Jake just rolled them to their side.  Which was a bit awkward with the way they were joined.  Jake couldn't help looking under his blanket, and wasn't sure what to make of what he saw.  His Pajama shirt was covering Kyle, but it was stretched, making the captain awesome design look funny.  He still had the bottoms on, at least, on his half.  Kyle's lower half still had boxers, but now they matched the pattern on Jake's leg.  Jake could feel himself coming more awake, and playfully pulled away from Kyle, &quot;So, why are we like this again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle knew he wasn't getting back to sleep so he flopped them onto their back.  &quot;Kevin had a swim meet, and I said I'd rather stay here stuck with you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I didn't say that out loud.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was too early for you wasn't it?&quot; Jake reasoned it out, but he still made it sound like his feelings were hurt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya. But that doesn't mean what I just said isn't true.&quot; Kyle smiled and nudged Jake, trying to cheer him up.  Jake had to fight back a smile, and keep the sad look on his face.  It was making Kyle feel bad, so he tried something else.  &quot;Come on, let's see a smile.&quot;  Kyle reached over with his hand and tickled Jake lightly.  He squirmed, but Jake was adamant about not smiling.  This time, Kyle tickled him a bit harder, and it made Jake squeal, but not smile.  Kyle was determined, and gave it everything he got.  Jake could hardly control himself.  He had a loose grip on the edge of his bed and was desperately trying to pull away, but he wasn't strong enough to move the combined body on his own.  Kyle could feel the excitement building in Jake and cackled as evilly as he could, &quot;It doesn't matter how are you try!  You can't get away!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake couldn't hold it any longer, and he burst out laughing.  He had given up trying to get away, and now he and Kyle were wriggling under the blanket so much, they almost fell out of bed.  &quot;Hahaha, Ok, ok, Kyle, stop... Kyle! Ok! Stop!&quot;  They took a moment to catch their breathe.  Suddenly Jake's alarm went off, startling both of them.  With Kyle's help shuffling over, Jake reached as far as he could and turned it off.  He tried to sit up, and needed Kyle's help with that too.<br />
<br />
The blanket they has slept under all night slid off them and bunched up in their lap, giving Kyle his first look at themselves.  He looked down at the pajama shirt that was stretched tightly across his side of their chest.  He tossed the blanket off as they moved to the edge of the bed so they could stand.  Kyle smirked, and told Jake about how he had captain awesome underwear once.  Jake giggled, and slipped his arm out of his shirt, then up and over his head.  Kyle very carefully did the same, trying his best not to rip it.  But once it was off, and they got a good look at it, they could see it was way too stretched out.  &quot;Look like I owe you a new one.  I'll try and...&quot; Kyle stopped short.<br />
<br />
He couldn't help looking down at themselves.  He thought it was weird seeing himself and Kevin together, but it was nothing compared to Jake.  Kyle could see why Jake needed his help to move about.  Unlike Kevin with his swimmer body, Jake didn't have much muscle.  Kyle couldn't help but stare at the area where his abs were on one half of their belly button, and Jake's lean tummy was on the other.  Jake's mouth hung open as he followed Kyle's gazed.  Without thinking about it, he slowly ran his hand over his flat stomach, then across the bumps on Kyle's.  It was Kyle's turn to squirm now, and due to their uneven height, it almost made them fall.  Jake snapped his hand back, and looked away, &quot;Sorry!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle couldn't help laughing, &quot;It's ok.&quot;  They stood in awkward silence for a moment before Jake grabbed his bottoms at was about to take them off. Kyle grabbed at them too, but pulled up instead of down, &quot;Umm, let's just wait for Josh to get here.&quot;  Jake gave a simple 'Ok' and shrugged.  Kyle let out an inward sigh of relief.  If he didn't feel comfortable having a shower with Kevin, then there was no way he was about to get naked with Jake.<br />
<br />
They sat back back down on the bed.  Jake placed his hand on their weirdly merged stomach again, and poked at Kyle.  He gave Kyle and evil grin and tried to tickle him, getting revenge form earlier.  Jake start to laugh with Kyle, as he started getting excited again &quot;So, what should we do till then?!&quot;</p>
