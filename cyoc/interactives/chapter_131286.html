<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie looks through her options of who to pick to become Aunt Lisa’s husband.  As she was looking, they were all caught off guard by a voice of a woman not far.<br />
<br />
“Hey there, Lisa!”<br />
<br />
The sound of that voice made Kellie cringed from it.  Katie turned to her friend cringing and looked back to see who it is.  Turned out, it was one of Lisa’s friends a long time, Allison, and it looks like she was carrying her baby son in her arms.  She’s 33 years of age and was in good shape, complete with CC cup breasts, a curvy figure, toned arms and legs, and a pretty face.  But she was much different then Lisa as while Lisa has a modeling career, Allison is more of a rock star.  She was wearing a tight corset complete with breastplate to show case her assets, a leather like skirt so short that is would nearly expose her black gothic thong, biker like gloves on her hands, fishnet stockings down her legs, and a pair of five inch combat boots.  Multiple tattoos covered both of her arms and one of a skull and crossbones on her chest above her breasts.  She has a piercing on her naval and a couple of more dotted her nose, lips, and tongue.  And her ebony hair was shot short and styled with a buzz cut to the side of her head and a bang draped down the other side and it was dyed red on the bang.<br />
<br />
Both Lisa and Allison grew up together back when they were young, but they went to two different paths.  While Lisa went on with her career as a fashion model, Allison wanted to be a singer.  She does sing well and has started with her career, but went with the wrong kinds of people and took part in metal music, where most of the songs involve her screaming.  There were times that she had many after parties, one of which would involve her having her baby boy, Christopher, or Chris for short.<br />
<br />
Lisa looked to Allison and was amazed that she was there.  “Allison…” she said, “So surprised that you came.”<br />
<br />
Allison smirked and responded by saying, “Sorry if I’m interrupting, Lisa.  I thought I stopped by, say hi, and asked for a favor.”<br />
<br />
She soon looked to both Katie and Kellie and smiled and waved at them.  “Hey there Katie.  Kellie.”<br />
<br />
Kellie glared at her before turning back with disdain in her face.  “Hello, Allison…” she said with a sour sound of her voice.  Katie looked to him and understood why he’s behaving like that.  Long before she discovered, Kellie, who was once her mother and lawyer, had a serious disdain with Allison and her career in a rock star.  That her music was ear soars and despised her for it.  Even if Lisa, who was once Kellie’s sister, was okay with her friend’s career, she still hate it with all her being.  Now that Kellie’s a lesbian friend of Katie, she still hates her till this day.<br />
<br />
When all of this was happening, Lisa decided to ask about the last part.  “Exactly what favor you want me to do?” she asked her.<br />
<br />
Allison turned to her and said, “I’m glad you asked.  See, I’m supposed to do a concert with my girls at the bar in the pier.  It’s supposed to be a big deal.  But unfortunately, my babysitter called in sick and now I don’t have anyone to take care of my baby son.  I don’t want to leave him in the bar, as all those lights and sounds are going to make him cry.”<br />
<br />
Kellie heard her and was still annoyed by her presence.  “Well, at least you are still a mother, even if you are a dead end rock star.” she said <br />
<br />
Allison her hears and chuckled, as if it was a joke.  “Oh Kellie…” she retorted, “You are such a joker.  Anyways, with my babysitter under the weather, I need to look for a replacement at the last minute.  So, I was wondering…”<br />
<br />
That’s when Aunt Lisa knew what she was going to say and responded with, “You need me to take care of Carlos for you.”<br />
<br />
Allison heard her and smiled brightly.  “That’s it.” she continued, “I assume that you are having a bit of a break, so I thought it would be best if I leave my son in your care until I get back.  Unless you are already busy with your modeling career.”<br />
<br />
Lisa heard her and gave it some thought.  Normally, she was going to be beach with her niece and her friend along with Kellie’s family.  But this is a slight hiccup from all the work they were planning together.  Still, it just would’ve been too long as she decided to look after Carlos.<br />
<br />
“Sure thing, Allison.” Lisa said to her, “I’ll look after your kid.”<br />
<br />
Allison smiled and was pleased with the news.  “Perfect!” she said with excitement, “I’ll leave him in your hands.  Here’s his baby bag filled with fresh diapers, baby formula, toys, and a blanket incase he gets cold.  I’ll be back in an hour or so, just as long as my fans doesn’t think of an encore.”<br />
<br />
She soon placed the baby in Lisa’s hands and the bag of baby things next to her.  She soon decided to say her goodbyes, only temporarily, “I’ll see you soon, Lisa.”  She soon looked to Katie and Kellie and waved to them as well.  “You too Katie.  Kellie.”<br />
<br />
She soon hurried back up the pier to get ready with her performance.  By the time she left, Lisa was holding Carlos in her hands and smiles at him.  “Looks like mommy left you with me for a while, sweetie.” She said to him in a cooey voice.  “You’re mom is quite a busy woman, performing with her friends and all.  If only she can unwind just a little more when she’s younger, then maybe she would spend more time wit you.  Now what do you wish to do?”<br />
<br />
By the time she asked, she got a whiff of something completely smelly and the baby giggled happily.  Smelling the stench, she soon realized what she needed to do.  “Eww…  Looks like the start of the day begins with you changing diapers.” Lisa said as she looked to Katie to tell her where she was planning to go, “Katie!  I need to get to the rest room to change Carlos’s diapers.  Be a good girl and stay where you are until I get back.”<br />
<br />
Katie looked to her aunt and nodded in agreement.  “Sure thing mom!”<br />
<br />
Katie soon stood up and picked up the baby bad to carry it on her shoulder while holding Carlos in her arms.  By the time she left, Kellie turned her head away and muttered under her breath, “I can’t believe her…”<br />
<br />
Katie heard her and looked to her friend, thinking that she’s referring to her own aunt.  “Aunt Lisa isn’t that bad…  I know I’m sixteen and she still treats me like a kid.  But she does care for my well being and always keeps me on watch.”<br />
<br />
Kellie heard her and turned back at protest.  “That’s not what I meant!” she spat to her friend, “I’m talking about Allison!  I can’t believe she showed up at the beach of all places, wearing something as gaudy as that!  That makes my blood boil.”<br />
<br />
Katie heard her and was a little confused about that.  “What are you talking about, Kel?  Allison isn’t that bad.  She’s an old friend of my Aunt and she’s kind to me.”<br />
<br />
“But she’s just nothing but a rebel!  A rocker who doesn’t give two shits about society.  She simply dumped her son in your Aunt’s lap, putting her rock star ego over motherhood.  If I was a mother, I would’ve looks after my child, no matter what I do.”<br />
<br />
Katie heard her and she was half right about it.  When Kellie was once Katie’s mother, she always looks after her, no matter what.  Juggling both a lawyer and mother was difficult for her, but she balanced it out and made things easy for her.  Looking back to her mother getting to the restroom on the pier, she sighed and knew she had a point.<br />
<br />
“You’re right…” she said in defeat, “Allison does concern about her popularity then her child.  She never really had the time to look after him and just dump him with a baby sister while she works.  At least Aunt Lisa’s cares for him like her own child and treats him as well as her.”<br />
<br />
By the time she said it, an idea popped in her head and she smiled from ear to ear.  Looking back to Kellie, she told her of a plan.  “I got it!” she exclaimed, “Since Aunt Lisa’s with Carlos, why don’t I make Carlos her husband.”<br />
<br />
Kellie heard that and was starting to get intrigued by this idea.  “Hmm…  You know, that seems like the perfect idea.  If Carlos becomes the husband of your aunt, then Allison won’t have a son to abandon and Lisa would be happy.  Oh, hell yeah…  That bitch will get what she deserves.  Make that wish.”<br />
<br />
Katie nodded and said, “Sure thing, but I need to add a few extra things with this wish.”<br />
<br />
Kellie heard it and waved it off like nothing.  “Fine…  Just make it quick.  I just want to have a little fun on this beach.”<br />
<br />
Katie smiled to her friend and looked to the ring of her finger, whispering a wish to it.<br />
<br />
“I wish that Allison’s cousin, Carlos, slowly ages to become Aunt Lisa’s husband.  How it works is that when each second passes, he will grow physically and mentally one day older until he is the same age as my aunt.  As he ages, anything he will do will affect his growth and make is his occupation as an adult.  Reality will change when he ages as he will always be Lisa’s husband in the end.”<br />
<br />
By the time the wish was finished, the ring started to glow as it made her wish.  When it stopped growing, Kellie looked at it and wondered if it was granted.<br />
<br />
“Did it work?” she asked her friend.<br />
<br />
Katie looked to her and shrugged her shoulders.  “Don’t know…” she said, “But we shall wait and see.  Now C’mon, let’s head to the beach.  I need a serious dive before my aunt gets back.  Last one in the beach gets to pay for a smoothie!”<br />
<br />
She soon gets up and dashed past Kellie, making a B line to the shore.  Kellie saw this and was caught off guard by it.<br />
<br />
“Hey!” she yelled to her.  “No fair!  I wasn’t ready!”<br />
<br />
She soon got off the beach and raced after her friend, trying to get to the beach first before her friend does.  As they were heading down the shore, the magic of the ring started to take affect and the slow progression of Carlos has started.</p>
