<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hearing your parents fucking in the same room as you was bad enough, all that slapping grunting, Jess mused; but what made this so much worse was the smell. The place stank of goat. It was all Jess could do not to cough and give away her hiding place.<br />
<br />
Why hadn&#39;t she locked the door? She groaned inwardly. Perfect opportunity ruined by sloppy execution.<br />
<br />
Jess heard her dad grunting and moaning loudly, it could only mean one thing...<br />
<br />
There was a loud exhalation, then some shuffling. She heard some slapping of flesh and then a feminine grunt. Her mother, &quot;Look Honey, twice the fun now!&quot;.<br />
<br />
What is all God&#39;s name did that mean?<br />
<br />
There was some more shuffling, which must have been one of them standing up. There was a clop-clop of hooves on the floor, her mother. Maybe she was leaving. <br />
<br />
*Clack*. That didn&#39;t sound like a hoof. That was the bolt of a door. Jess shook her head. She forgot, but her Mum obviously didn&#39;t. A few heartbeats and steps later there was another *Clack*.<br />
<br />
&quot;If Jess is upstairs, and James is in our room, then I guess we&#39;d better stay the night here.&quot; Her mum confirmed, she was locked in. <br />
<br />
Fuck. <br />
<br />
She hung her head. This was bad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Might as well settle in. I think there was a blanket behind that couch.&quot; She heard her say. Panic rose. Jess looked down, there indeed lay a blanket on the floor in-front of her. She tensed. Ready to bolt when she heard the call of her Dad.<br />
<br />
&quot;No Love! Don&#39;t...&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Fool&#39; She thought. &#39;Stop talking!&#39; <br />
<br />
&quot;M-make yourself comfortable and I&#39;ll get us settled in.&quot; Jess&#39;s adrenaline flooded her veins. Nothing bad there she was sure. He had to stop talking!<br />
<br />
There was a pause. Then a giggle. Her mother spoke. &quot;Oooo. It&#39;s good to hear you talking again Honey. The silence was killing me. I miss our long chats.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Jesus Mum&#39; Jess thought, &#39;You&#39;re killing us! Don&#39;t let Dad talk! He&#39;ll fuck up eventually if you do&#39;<br />
<br />
Luckily Henry didn&#39;t answer, Joan spoke next &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll pull the pillows and the rug, you get the blanket.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a flurry of movement, and slow footsteps to her couch.<br />
<br />
A shadow covered her as her father came into view around the back of the sofa. He looked down in terror, she up in embarrassment. Still naked from the waist down, she sat on her ass, pale legs in front of her, knees-up. She saw Henry&#39;s eyes flick, just for a moment, to where her shins blocked the view of her goods. She cracked the gap between her legs the tiniest bit. But by the time she had, her dad had already returned to looking her in the eyes. <br />
<br />
Quietly he knelt down, hand picking up the blanket beside her. She lifted one foot, to let him pick it up, also exposing herself. He looked pained. He opened his mouth as if to say something, to which Jess furrowed her brows in her angriest look, and made the &#39;Zip-It&#39; symbol.<br />
<br />
He clearly got the message to stop talking and simply rose, holding the folded fleece blanket in his hand.<br />
<br />
Jess breathed a sigh of relief. Safe for now.<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
Henry came back from around the couch to find that Joan had long since set up the pillows and rug on the floor. She now stood, buck naked in front of him grinning. Her cock, sated dangled over her plump balls and was framed by her two new C-Cup crotch tits. Much like her normal tits, they had a little sag to them, but certainly not what her years would have expected. He motioned up and down at her naked form with his hands and a quizzical look.<br />
<br />
&quot;If there&#39;s no-one around and the doors are locked, why not stay naked?&quot; She exclaimed, holding her arms wide with a smile, four tits jiggling. Henry noted that she had cleaned her cum from her stomach. He wondered what she had used. He smiled at her, she did look happy for the first time this trip. Despite all this madness there was a part of him glad to see her happy. Even if most of him screamed how fucked up all of this was.<br />
<br />
With a flourish he swung the blanket over the rug on the floor, making the makeshift bed. Joan watched him with a smile. Once done he turned to see her right in front of him. The smell of goat returned, strong, though not overwhelming.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know.&quot; She began, &quot;I really am happy you&#39;re okay with this! I was soooo worried you&#39;d freak out over what happened to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
He shook his head vehemently, despite it all, now that he was thinking more clearly and his lust was down, he didn&#39;t want to hurt his wife. He loved her dearly.<br />
<br />
Her smile widened showing white teeth as she placed both arms up over his shoulders and... something was on her lip. Something opaque. Something gooey looking. She breathed out.<br />
<br />
It reeked of cum, kind of goaty, but mostly like cum. Joan had eaten her own cum. What was happening to her?<br />
<br />
Oh God.<br />
<br />
Before he could think further she leaned in, kissing him on the lips. He felt the slimy substance transfer. He cringed inwardly, and stiffened, but Joan&#39;s hand was now at the back of his head, pulling him in, tongue flicking, seeking entrance. He tasted salty goo. After a pause he gave it and their tongues danced. The taste quickly disappeared and he was able to lean into it more, the goaty musk now the only distraction.<br />
<br />
Joan&#39;s hands roamed, up his back, over his ass. She pulled herself in tight. She felt so soft, except. <br />
<br />
Except for something hard poking his leg. After a long time they parted, he watched as a string of spit stretched and snapped between their mouths. He looked down to see her pudgy cock, poking out from between her two crotch-tits, foreskin rolled fully back, bulbous head and single eye staring at him.<br />
<br />
Joan stepped back slightly, grabbing it with one hand and gently rubbing it. She winked, and laughed. &quot;God those things are insatiable. I know what you guys must go through now.&quot;. Henry gave a hearty chuckle, which died as he watched Joan speed up her fondling a bit, second hand coming in to join the first by tugging and tweaking her nipples.<br />
<br />
How horny was she? She seemed insatiable! Was this more of the curse. <br />
<br />
Her expression was changing as well. From jovial to sultry. She bit her lip. &quot;Hey, I know this is mad but, how about...&quot;<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t get any further before Henry began wildly waving his arms and shaking his head. He then began motioning all over his body. There was a moment, where she continued, then her expression changed again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right. Of course, I forgot about the changes.&quot; She said, though Henry was fairly unconvinced she had forgotten anything. She looked disappointed if anything. She stood for a few moments, cock still hard, regarding him. She looked like she wanted to say something. Henry raised his eyebrows<br />
<br />
&quot;I just..&quot; She began. Then stopped, looking down and shaking her head. She looked distraught now so Henry reached out placing a hand on her shoulder. She looked up, there was a war inside her. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just. This trip. I...&quot; Her stomach was in her throat, and Henry could see her quivering lip. &#39;What?&#39; He mouthed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been...&quot; she trailed off into a mumble. Henry&#39;s grip tightened and she looked back up at him, his eyes dead set, insistent.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been enjoying it. Having fun. I just thought you&#39;d like to join me.&quot; She finally admitted, her hand finding his and leading it down to her rock hard cock.</p>
