<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave finished up his work day without experimenting any more with the pen.  He was excited for the evening to come and his date with Janet.  After work he headed home, showered, and got ready for the date.  He dressed in some nice slacks and a button-up shirt.  He wanted to look nice without being too formal.<br />
<br />
At 7 he arrived at Janet&#39;s house.  Her house was very large, as one might expect.  Her giant truck sat in her big driveway in front of her enormous garage door.  Pretty much everything about the house was about twice the size as a normal house.<br />
<br />
He walked up to the huge, 14 foot high door, and noticed that unlike everything else, there was a normal size doorbell at normal height.  This made sense; any visitors Janet would expect would be normal, not giants.  Dave pushed the doorbell and heard a chime ring inside.  He waited a few minutes, then he heard the clack of high heels approach, and the door opened.<br />
<br />
Janet was quite a sight.  Her over 10 foot body was clad in a black minidress that was anything but mini.  It hugged her body, revealing enormous cleavage and falling only to her upper thighs.  Her giant, yet perfectly shapely butt was framed beautifully by the dress.  She also wore 10 inch stilettos (which were really just enormous 5 inch heels), making her imposing height that much taller.  Dave also couldn&#39;t help but notice that at her size combined with the heels, his own height put his face right about at her crotch level.  And if he ducked only a little, he would be able to see right up the dress.  Fortunately, Janet possessed a lady&#39;s grace and kept her legs together as she stood and walked.  The sight of the beautiful giantess made Dave begin to get hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dave!&quot; she said in her high soprano voice, &quot;You sure look handsome!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you are the most beautiful woman I&#39;ve ever laid eyes on!&quot; Dave returned.<br />
<br />
Janet beamed at the compliment, then said &quot;Dave, would you come wait inside for a moment?  I have to get a few things...&quot;<br />
<br />
She led Dave through her foyer into a nearby sitting room.  The room had an enormous couch and recliner, but also had a normal sized couch and seats for guests.  At her gesture, he sat on the couch.  &quot;I&#39;ll be right back,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
A few moments later, Janet returned, holding a giant-sized clutch, as well as a little package, wrapped in pink wrapping paper with a white bow.  She handed the package to Dave.  &quot;This is for you, Dave!&quot; she said happily.<br />
<br />
Dave stammered &quot;Oh... You shouldn&#39;t have... I didn&#39;t expect anything like... and we haven&#39;t gone out yet... Oh, but, thank you so much; you&#39;re so kind...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, silly!  It&#39;s nothing!  Just open it!&quot; Janet responded to his awkwardness.<br />
<br />
Dave complied and gingerly opened the present.  Inside he discovered a black lacy panty and bra set--not giant sized, just normal sized.  He looked up at Janet quizzically.<br />
<br />
She explained &quot;As you may know, I make my own clothing.  You mentioned earlier that you had always wanted to dress in women&#39;s clothes, but didn&#39;t have any of your own.  I didn&#39;t have much time between work and now, but I made this panty and bra set for you.  I hope you like them!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave could hardly speak.  Finally he mustered &quot;Thank you so much...!  They&#39;re beautiful; I love them!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so glad!&quot; said Janet, relieved.  &quot;The bra is padded, since your chest is flat.  It should make your chest appear to be about a B-cup,&quot; she further explained.  After a moment&#39;s pause from both of them, Janet pointed towards a door on the side of the room.  &quot;That&#39;s the guest bathroom.  You could go change into them, is you would like...&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave nodded unsuredly, and slowly stood up and headed toward the indicated door, carrying the bra and panties.  He was stricken by Janet&#39;s kindness.  He had a crush on her before, but this made him really feel love for her.  He hoped he could return her kindness.<br />
<br />
He reached the guest bathroom door.  Though it was just as large as the others, its doorknob was positioned slightly lower than the other doors, for easier reaching.  With a bit of effort, he turned the knob and entered the room, closing the door behind him and flicking a light switch which was at the same height as the doorknob.  The bathroom was very spacious.  It had a normal sized toilet, sink, and shower, but they were separated by a great amount of floor area.<br />
<br />
Dave removed his shoes and outer clothing, and then removed his underwear.  He took the black lacy panties and stepped into them.  His dick was rock hard as he slid the panties up his legs and tight against his crotch.  Despite the discomfort of wearing underwear that was shaped for a woman, and certainly not for him, he felt ...right....  He loved the feeling of the panties.  He then, with some difficulty, clasped the bra around him, positioning the padded cups over his chest.  <br />
<br />
With a heavy, satisfied sigh, he looked himself over for a moment, then put on his outer clothing and shoes again.  At this point he looked like a man with B-bup breasts pushing against his button-up shirt, but he felt like a million dollars.  It made him wish he&#39;d tried this a long time ago.  He&#39;d never had the courage, but Janet not only gave him that courage, she gave him the underwear as well!  He walked back out to the sitting room.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... how are they!&quot;  Janet inquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;Janet... I&#39;ve never felt better!&quot; Dave admitted truthfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wonderful!&quot; said Janet with a giant smile.  &quot;And your little B-cup breasts under that shirt are really cute!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave blushed.  They walked out to Janet&#39;s truck.  As Janet locked the door behind her Dave marveled at how good it felt to walk while wearing the panties.  Janet helped Dave up into the truck, which had what amounted to an enormous carseat installed into the passenger side.  A carseat that made it possible for normal sized folk to ride with Janet.  She buckled him in, climbed into her side, and drove them to the restaurant.<br />
<br />
The restaurant, it turned out, was called &quot;The Castle Cafe&quot;.  It was obvious why Janet had chosen this place.  It was themed after a castle, and was quite large.  Janet helped Dave out of the truck, and they walked toward the entrance holding hands.  Dave&#39;s hand was completely enclosed by Janet&#39;s and held at head height, but Dave enjoyed it.  At the entrance Dave opened the Door for Janet, who had to stoop to enter.<br />
<br />
Inside, Janet&#39;s head brushed the ceiling, and she had to take special care to duck or walk around the lights, but the large and spacious establishment was just big enough for her to get around in.  Their hostess apparently knew Janet, and led them to a handicap table, that had booth seating on one side, and 2 loose chairs on the other.  The hostess removed the chairs, and Janet kneeled at the table.  Dave sat on the booth side and had a fantastic view of Janet&#39;s giant, shapely legs as she kneeled, but she remained ever the lady, and kept her legs closed.<br />
<br />
The hostess left menus.  As Dave perused it he thought Janet looked a little bit funny holding what looked like a tiny menu up to her face.  She set it down shortly, having quickly decided what she wanted.  Dave took a little longer, then set his menu down too.  They were chatting about idle things.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like this place because they treat me like a giantess and just a person at the same time,&quot; Janet was explaining.  &quot;You can see how they handled seating.  And my food and drinks will be sized for me.  They keep giant decorational dishes and utensils that they get out and clean just for me.  I always tip them well for their kind service.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does it cost more?&quot; Dave asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes, usually twice as much as normal,&quot; Janet replied.  &quot;But I&#39;m fortunate to have a great job, and I&#39;m paid well enough to afford it.&quot;  She winked at Dave.<br />
<br />
The waiter came and took their food and drink orders.  A glass of water that was more the size of a pitcher, and an extra large glass of wine arrived at the table soon after, as well as Dave&#39;s drinks.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Dave?&quot; Janet asked.  &quot;While we wait, why don&#39;t you use that magic pen of yours to change some things around here?  It would pass the time and make it interesting...&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave was shocked for a moment, but then remembered he had let Janet know about the pen back at work.  Fearful of what she might know, Dave asked &quot;How much do you know about the pen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dave, I&#39;m not stupid,&quot; Janet replied.  &quot;I&#39;m the only giant I&#39;ve ever heard of, and you have a magic pen.  I can put two and two together.  I know I have memories of always being this way, but I know it was your pen that did it.  I also know that my house is not normal, nor is my office-space, nor is my pay grade.&quot;<br />
<br />
She continued, &quot;What I know is that even though you made me a giant, you also made life good for me.  I am very happy with who I am, and you gave me that happiness.  That&#39;s why I think it&#39;s silly that you think me making you panties was such a big deal.  You&#39;ve already done so much for me, after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... when you put it that way...&quot; Dave stuttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a nice guy,&quot; Janet stated.  &quot;I trust that you won&#39;t misuse the power of your magic pen.  You haven&#39;t so far.  You&#39;ve just made things more... interesting.  And there&#39;s nothing wrong with that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Janet... thank you!&quot; Dave said wholeheartedly.  &quot;So what should I change?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I like the castle theme of this place,&quot; said Janet, &quot;but I&#39;ve always wished it was a bit more specific....  I know!  You could make it a princess castle!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... okay that sounds fun!&quot; said Dave.  He took his pen from his ear and pulled a napkin over to him.<br />
<br />
He wrote on the napkin.  &quot;This castle restaurant now has a princess theme and is decorated accordingly.  The uniform for all waiters and waitresses is a beautiful pink princess gown with pink 3 inch high heels, white stockings, and white gown gloves.  The hosts and hostesses have a similar uniform in purple.  The bus boys and girls and maintenance crew all have milk made uniforms with blue dresses, white aprons, white stockings, and mary-jane shoes.  The kitchen staff wear green tutus and green stockings with yellow 5 inch heels and yellow fairy wings on their backs.&quot;<br />
<br />
He continued writing, &quot;Managerial staff in each department wear similar outfits with more colors or embroidery to designate their positions.  All staff are required to wear female bras and panties matching their outfits, and are required to style their hair in a feminine fashion and wear make-up befitting their outfit and their own facial features.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave and Janet looked around in awe as all of the staff&#39;s clothing changed to match Dave&#39;s description.  Their waiter approached to fill their water glasses, dressed in the pink princess dress as Dave had described, with pink 3 inch heels, white stockings, and white gloves.  His blonde hair was now shoulder-length and fell in feminine waves, held away from his face by a pink head band.  He wore pink lipstick, light blue eye shadow, eyeliner, mascara, and just a hint of blush.  Though it was plain he was a man, he actually looked quite pretty.<br />
<br />
Over at the podium near the door, the hostess was dressed in a similar purple dress.  She was already a woman so the change was less drastic, but hair and make-up were a bit more fanciful than they were before.  Over at another table, Dave saw a bus boy dressed in a simple blue dress and white maid&#39;s apron clearing the dishes.  He saw at the pickup counter for the food a rather large man who was obviously a cook.  He looked somewhat ridiculous dressed in his tight tutu and green tights, with fairy wings and tall high heels.<br />
<br />
Dave felt himself getting hard at the sight inside his lovely panties.  Janet exclaimed &quot;Oh, Dave!  You really didn&#39;t hold back!&quot;  And I can see you really have a thing for cross-dressing!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave blushed &quot;...yeah...&quot; he said softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;Don&#39;t be shy,&quot; said Janet.  &quot;I think it&#39;s great.  I&#39;ll probably come here more often.  They all look so good in their outfits!&quot;<br />
<br />
After a little more discussion, the waiter arrived with their food.  He had to be helped by another princess-dressed waiter for Janet&#39;s food.  She received a large plate with a whole roast chicken, a pile of potatoes, and a whole garden&#39;s worth of salad.  Dave received the fish and chips he ordered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like this place because their food is simple, but it&#39;s really tasty!&quot; said Janet.  Dave agreed as he ate his fish and chips.  After they finished, Janet said &quot;Do you want to get dessert, Dave?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, why not?&quot; said Dave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ve got an idea...&quot; mused Janet.  &quot;If you&#39;re open to a bit of eroticism with that pen...&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave felt his hard member strain against his panties again.  &quot;I&#39;m open to anything you&#39;d like...&quot; said Dave, interested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you use your pen to make it so we can dine on a person, instead of a dessert...&quot; she suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, you mean eat them?!&quot; Dave said, alarmed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no!  Nothing like that!&quot; said Janet.  &quot;I just mean... eat their pussy, suck on their cock, or their breasts, or their ass....  Something sexy like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I see!&quot; said Dave, relieved.  &quot;That sounds really sexy... do you want to do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, let&#39;s do it!&quot; said Janet happily.<br />
<br />
Dave wrote on a new napkin with his magic pen.  &quot;In addition to the regular dessert menu, this restaurant now offers a special dessert menu called &#39;Oral Offerings&#39;.  On it, the diner can select a gender and type of staff--wait staff, hosts, maintenance, or cooks--as well as a body part--either mouth, breasts, pussy, dick, or ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave continued, &quot;An employee matching the diner&#39;s choice will present themselves to the table, in uniform, and lay down upon the table.  They will bare the selected body part and allow the diners to orally pleasure them to the diner&#39;s satisfaction.  This will cost around the same amount as any other dessert, but if the diner&#39;s give the employee at least one orgasm, it is half off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave finished writing, and the waiter came by once more and placed two menus on the table.  One labelled &quot;Dessert&quot; and the other labelled &quot;Oral Offerings&quot;.  He cleared the dishes as he left.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh, I&#39;m so excited!&quot; said Janet, seizing the Oral Offerings menu.  She looked it over quickly, and said to Dave.  &quot;Anything in particular you&#39;d like?&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh, anything,&quot; said Dave passively.  &quot;Would you like to get one to share?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes!  That sounds nice.&quot;  She asked, &quot;What do you think of a woman hostess... and... her pussy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds great!&quot; said Dave, hardly believing this was reality.<br />
<br />
Janet flagged down the waiter and relayed the order to him.  A few minutes later a cute woman dressed in a purple princess dress approached the table.  She said &quot;Hello folks!  My name is Kayla and I&#39;m a hostess.  I&#39;m here for your oral offerings of my pussy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good!&quot; Janet and Dave said in unison.  The hostess then climbed on the table face up and pulled the skirt of her dress up, revealing her thigh-high white stockings held by a garter belt, and her white lacy panties.  She slid the panties down her legs, baring her pussy for all to see.  &quot;I can take the garter off too, if you&#39;d like,&quot; Kayla offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.  I rather like it on,&quot; said Janet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Kayla said cheerfully.<br />
<br />
Janet then leaned down and with her enormous tongue, began licking Kayla&#39;s pussy.  Kayla gasped and moaned in pleasure.  Janet came up and grinned at Dave.  &quot;She&#39;s delicious; try some!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave was hard almost to bursting as he leaned his head between Kayla&#39;s legs.  Her sweet scent was wonderful.  Dave began to lick her and he found himself really enjoying the taste.  He came up and said &quot;Oh, yes!  She really is good!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is great!&quot; said Janet.<br />
<br />
The two took turns licking Kayla.  Dave couldn&#39;t help but notice that Kayla wasn&#39;t responding nearly as much when he was licking her as when Janet was.  Dave set about orally pleasuring her again, determined to bring her to orgasm, but it just wasn&#39;t happening.  Janet leaned in as Dave was still licking, her enormous face right next to Dave&#39;s and began licking Kayla as well.  Dave&#39;s and Janet&#39;s tongues met, and they each pulled back for a moment awkwardly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t stop now...&quot; said Janet softly, smiling at Dave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!  Don&#39;t stop!&quot; Kayla echoed from the table.<br />
<br />
The two then set back to it together.  Dave felt Kayla reacting and building towards orgasm, though it was obvious that it was Janet making this come about.  Dave enjoyed it anyway, and kept sucking and licking.  After a few moments of gradually building sexual tension, Kayla orgasmed.  She shouted and moaned as Janet&#39;s tongue expertly worked at her pussy and clit.  Her body tensed and her pussy was pouring juice, which was getting all over Dave&#39;s face.  He loved it.<br />
<br />
After a few more moments, Kayla&#39;s orgasm died down.  She stood up off the table and slid her panties back up between her legs.  She turned, bowed, and said &quot;Thank you so much!  I hope you enjoyed me as much as I enjoyed you!&quot;  And with that, she left and resumed her post as a hostess.<br />
<br />
Dave and Janet were both smiling at each other.  Dave brought up what he was thinking.  &quot;That was really great!  ...But I couldn&#39;t help but notice that you were doing all the work, and I wasn&#39;t getting very far...&quot;<br />
<br />
Janet replied &quot;It wasn&#39;t work at all!  I guess maybe you didn&#39;t know, Dave, but I&#39;m bisexual.  I tend to prefer women more than men, too, until I met you that is.  I&#39;ve liked you from the moment I met you, but really your desire to dress and act more feminine really just makes me like you even more!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave looked down, flustered.<br />
<br />
Janet continued &quot;I&#39;m pretty good at pleasuring women, because I&#39;ve been with them before.  But that doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t learn as well!&quot;<br />
<br />
The table grew quiet after that, neither having anything to say in response.  Dave looked around the dining room.  He saw a few other tables enjoying oral offerings.  He saw the cook he&#39;d noticed before, dressed in his green fairy outfit.  He was lying on a table with three guys taking turns on the cook&#39;s thick cock that stuck out from his tights.  At another table a couple of female friends were each suckling on a waitress&#39;s two bare breasts.  At a third, a father and teenage daughter were taking turns licking the ass of a bus girl.  The whole scene gave no peace to Dave&#39;s constant hard-on.<br />
<br />
Janet interrupted his thoughts &quot;Dave?  I&#39;d like to ask you something...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, what is it?&quot; asked Dave, smiling at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dave... this might be hard... but do you think I could use your pen for a moment?&quot; Janet asked.<br />
<br />
Dave hesitated.  &quot;You&#39;d like my pen... Are you sure...?  What do you need it for...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dave, if it was something I could simply tell you, I would and you could write it down yourself.  But I&#39;d like it because I have an idea that I can&#39;t tell you just yet....  Dave... you can trust me.  I wouldn&#39;t do anything to harm you, ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave hesitated again, and after some thought, decided that he could trust her.  He handed her the pen.  She took it and began writing on another napkin, concealing it with her giant hand.  Her writing with such a small instrument compared to her looked difficult, but she did so with practiced ease.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you writing?&quot; Dave asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll find out...&quot; Janet said playfully.  She finished and handed the pen back to Dave.  &quot;Thank you Dave.  I really think you&#39;ll be pleased with what I&#39;ve done.  It wasn&#39;t much; I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; said Dave.  &quot;I trust you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you!&quot; Janet replied.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes the check arrived.  Janet excused herself to the restroom while Dave paid.  He then went to the restroom as well, and then the two met outside the restaurant.<br />
<br />
On their way back to Janet&#39;s home in her truck, Dave asked &quot;How do you use the restroom in public places?&quot;<br />
<br />
Janet chuckled and replied &quot;Well it&#39;s not easy.  I use the handicap stall, since it&#39;s the only one that&#39;s big enough.  I&#39;ve gotten really good at positioning myself right over the toilet, and then I just do it.  ...Sometimes I have to flush a few times, during...&quot;  She blushed.  Dave knew what she meant, and didn&#39;t ask anymore.<br />
<br />
Before long they were back on Janet&#39;s doorstep.  Before Dave realized what was happening, Janet leaned down and gave him a long, deep kiss with her enormous lips.  Her lips completely covered his mouth and chin, but Dave returned the kiss, enjoying himself immensely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for the wonderful date, Dave!&quot; Janet said happily.  &quot;Would you like to come inside a little longer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like that very much!&quot; said Dave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then,&quot; said Janet, &quot;come along inside!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two entered Janet&#39;s giant house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I can show you what I wrote down...&quot; said Janet.<br />
<br />
...</p>
