<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Julie… Can we talk?” Martin asked. Tears still stained his face, and he was heart broken by the fight. But he knew that his priority should be his daughter. Julie was in her room, sobbing herself. The fight they all knew was coming had just come. It exploded downstairs, and left the house in a cold silence. <br />
<br />
“Go away!” Julie cried. Martin hesitates, but does go into her room. Julie on her bed, sobbing.<br />
<br />
“Julie, I know you’re upset…”<br />
<br />
“Upset?!? Everything is my fault. Eric’s probably run off with Spencer, and now Mom’s left! Everything is my damn fault!” Julie said. That bit about someone named Spencer confused Martin, but he continues with what he wants to say. <br />
<br />
“No, this is my fault! And don’t think otherwise. You’re not the reason your mom is so distraught.” Martin said, rushing to his daughter’s side. He takes her head in his lap, and strokes her hair. <br />
<br />
“Exactly like her mother’s.” Martin thinks. <br />
<br />
“How can you say that? I’m such a disappointment…”<br />
<br />
“Julie Marie Stovall you are not a disappointment. You made a mistake. Granted it was a very, VERY, big mistake, but you have never once disappointed me.” Martin said, turning his daughter’s head so she can see his face. <br />
<br />
“But….”<br />
<br />
“Julie, listen to me. I’m the one who screwed up. I’ve been a terrible role model for you. I… I can’t explain why I do the things I do. It just happens. I’m not going to make excuses, but I can’t explain my motivations either. Your mother has every right to be angry with me, Any fury she directs at you is meant for me.”<br />
<br />
“But… what if she does leave?” Julie asks in a weak voice.<br />
<br />
“I won’t let her. I’ll fight as hard as I can for her. But if she does… I can’t say I blame her. I’m surprised she’s stayed this long. She’s too good for me…” Martin sighed. <br />
<br />
Julie sat up, wiping the tears from her eyes. Then she asked what she should do next. <br />
<br />
“Do what your mother said. Apologize to Eric. You don’t have to get back together, but just tell him you’re sorry.” Martin said.<br />
<br />
“What about Brian?” Julie asked. Martin assumed that to be the boy his daughter had been seeing. <br />
<br />
“Your mother is right about that too. I’m sure you go to school with him, but don’t see him outside of that. It’s best for you to make a clean run of things. You make amends, and I’ll try to be a better husband and father.” Martin said. The two hugged, tears flowing from both of their faces. Then, Martin’s cell phone rang in his pants. <br />
<br />
He checked the caller ID, and went into another room. He didn’t want to leave Julie alone at a time like this, but at the same time he didn’t want to worry her about his work problems. <br />
<br />
“Samantha? I hope you’re having a better day than I am.”<br />
<br />
“Uh, I was. But I have a feeling I’m about to make your day about ten times worse.” <br />
<br />
“Will this day never end?” Martin thought, bracing himself for the worse. <br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Melissa Stovall drove up and down the streets of Moon Lake, tears freely falling from her face onto her lap. She didn’t know where to go, who she could talk to. Her family was on the other side of the country. She had no one close to confide in. She couldn’t bring herself to make a phone call. <br />
<br />
She couldn’t go to Martin’s family. They’d hate her for wanting to leave. But she was so fed up with Martin’s behavior, and now her daughter’s. Melissa found herself in the parking lot of Moon Lake High School. No one was around, it was a Sunday. A few kids were using the basketball court, and the baseball field. <br />
<br />
No one paid her much mind. Melissa just sat there, crying and crying. She wished she could go back in time and change her life. Never leave Charolette, marry her high school crush when she had the chance, have normal children. Never meet Martin at that damn gas station. Never forgive him for cheating on her that first time. <br />
<br />
Melissa’s thoughts raced and raced until she heard her phone ring. It was Martin. She angrily hit the “DECLINE” button and threw her phone to the floor of her car. It started ringing soon after. But when she went to decline the call again, she was surprised to see an unknown caller ID. <br />
<br />
“Martin if you’re calling to beg me to come home….”<br />
<br />
“Melissa, this is Samantha Twist.” Samantha said quickly. <br />
<br />
“Oh god, Samantha I’m sorry. I thought….”<br />
<br />
“I know, I know. I just got off the phone with Martin.”<br />
<br />
“Oh.” was all Melissa could say. Samantha wasn’t calling to convince her to go back home was she? Samantha didn’t ever strike Melissa as that sort of person. <br />
<br />
“Look, I don’t know the details, Martin just told me you had a fight. But he wanted me to ask you to go home to stay with Julie. Something’s come up, and he, I need him at City Hall.” Samantha said. <br />
<br />
“What happened?” Melissa asked. <br />
<br />
“I can’t go into too much detail. But it’s pretty serious.” Samantha sighed. <br />
<br />
“Everyone’s having a crappy Sunday.” Melissa thought. She took a few deep breaths before responding. <br />
<br />
“Alright, I’ll go back home. Is Martin still there?” <br />
<br />
“He didn’t want to leave Julie alone.” <br />
<br />
“No of course he wouldn’t. God, what am I going to do?” Melissa thought. She thanked Samantha and hung up. After steeling her nerves, she pulled out of the parking lot and headed home. It was the last place she wanted to be, but from Samantha Twist’s tone of voice something was going on. Something more important than The Stovall’s family problems.  <br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
“Melissa, thank you for coming back.” Martin said. He’d gone out to meet his wife. The only thing he told Julie was that he was needed at work, and her mother would be coming back to watch her. Julie was obviously worried about her father, but Martin was more worried about Julie’s safety. The town would soon be teeming with feds, and they would be eager to end this business with Jeremy Bower. <br />
<br />
“I don’t want either of them to get caught in the cross hairs” Martin thought. <br />
<br />
“I’m not here for you, I’m here for Julie.” Melissa said coldly, trying not to meet Martin’s eyes. <br />
<br />
“All the same, thank you.” Martin said before getting into his own car. <br />
<br />
“Martin!” Melissa said, as Martin pulled out of their driveway. Martin looked, surprised his wife called out to him. She stood there, in their driveway fresh tears falling onto the ground. <br />
<br />
“Be safe.” she almost whispered. Martin nodded, tears welling his his own eyes, but for a different reason.<br />
<br />
“I love you.” he said before driving away. Melissa went inside, and found Julie standing in the living room looking absolutely terrified. The two put aside any feelings from earlier, and hugged. They both cried in each other’s arms, worrying about the man they shared their lives with. Melissa surprised at how worried she was. <br />
<br />
“I can’t do this anymore. The constant worrying, the hating and fighting.” Melissa said, burying her face into her daughter’s hair. <br />
<br />
“Mom…?” Julie said in a soft voice. <br />
<br />
“Yes?”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry.” Julie said. Melissa’s eyes teared up again, and she pulled Julie closer to her.<br />
<br />
“I know sweetie. I know.”</p>
