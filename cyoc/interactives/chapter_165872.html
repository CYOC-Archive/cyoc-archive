<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After eavesdropping on his parent’s conversation with Ava for a few minutes, Connor got up and began to go to his room. <br />
<br />
“Where are you going, Connor?” Ava whispered. “Don’t you want to hear more about what Were species Mom and Dad want to become?” <br />
<br />
“I’d love to, but I can’t,” Connor responded. “I have to get ready for my date with Ryan tonight.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, alright then. I’ll tell you what you missed before you leave.” <br />
<br />
Connor smiled. “Alright, sis,” he said with a nod. Then, the young man walked down the hallway and into his bedroom, closing the door behind him. As soon as he did, the text alert on his phone went off. Connor reached into his pocket and pulled out his phone, looking at who sent him a text. <br />
<br />
‘Hey, it’s Ryan. Was just told that my parents are going to be going out of town for the weekend, so we’ll have the house all to ourselves. I was thinking we could meet up at my place around 5:30. Sound good?’<br />
<br />
Connor read the text, then quickly responded with ‘Yeah, that’s fine. See you then.’<br />
<br />
As Connor put his phone back in his pocket, he couldn’t help but think about what Ryan had said about them having his house all to themselves. The date hadn’t even happened, and yet Ryan was already assuming that it would go well. Maybe Tad was right about Ryan wanting to transform him no matter how well their date went…<br />
<br />
Whatever the case, Connor wanted to make sure he looked good for their date tonight. He went into his bathroom to take a shower in order to clean himself up. Once he was out of the shower, Connor walked over to his closet and opened it, staring at the clothes inside. While he and Ryan wouldn’t be going to a fancy restaurant, Connor didn’t want to wear casual clothing on their date. Unsure of what to do, he quickly grabbed his phone off his bed and texted Ryan. <br />
<br />
‘What should I wear tonight?’<br />
<br />
It didn’t take long for him to receive a response: ‘You don’t need to wear anything fancy. Come in whatever makes you feel comfortable. You’ll look great no matter what you wear.’<br />
<br />
Connor blushed as he read Ryan’s response. Putting down his phone, the young man grabbed a nice pair of jeans out of his closet and put them on before walking over to his dresser and pulling out a t-shirt. <br />
<br />
Once he was dressed, Connor grabbed his stick of deodorant and quickly put some on. Then, he walked over to the mirror that hung on his door, admiring himself. <br />
<br />
“You clean up pretty nicely Connor,” he said to himself with a smile. <br />
<br />
~	~	~<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, a few streets down, Ryan was getting ready for their date as well. Like Connor, he took a shower and got dressed, putting on a nice pair of khakis and a t-shirt. He even put on a few spritzes of cologne. <br />
<br />
Ryan was actually quite excited about his date with Connor tonight. He couldn’t put his finger on it, but there was definitely something special about Connor. Maybe it was his enthusiasm about joining the Were community, or maybe it was how timid he got whenever they were together. Whatever the case, Ryan was definitely looking forward to the night to come. <br />
<br />
The young man had every intention of making sure his date with Connor went well. Then again, it seemed like it would be kind of hard for things to go wrong. Because of this, Ryan had somewhat planned out their extended weekend together. The entire weekend would be dedicated to showing Connor the ins and outs of being a Werewildcat, and with his parents out of town, there would be no interruptions. Everything was going to be perfect. <br />
<br />
Once he was ready for his date with Connor, Ryan began looking for ways to kill time until Connor arrived. He played some video games for about an hour before turning them off when he heard the doorbell ring. He grabbed his phone and looked at the time. It was already 5:30. <br />
<br />
Rushing downstairs, Ryan opened the front door to see Connor standing there, looking a bit timid. <br />
<br />
“You’re looking pretty good,” Ryan said, giving Connor a warm smile. “Are you ready for our little dinner date?”<br />
<br />
Connor blushed and nodded. “Yeah, I’m really excited,” he confessed. “I can’t believe that we’re actually going on a date….and tonight might actually be my last night as a Normal…”<br />
<br />
Ryan chuckled before stepping outside and shutting the front door to his house behind him. He quickly locked the door before turning around and wrapping his arm around Connor. “Believe me,” he said, “If things go well, tonight will be something you’ll remember for the rest of your life.”</p>
