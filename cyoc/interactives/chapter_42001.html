<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Simon tapped in 7.5 as the new testosterone level.  He wasn't exactly sure what was going to happen...but he knew it was going to be interesting, to say the least.<br />
<br />
   Bryan looked over Simon's shoulder at the device.  &quot;Sweet!  Don't forget to up my age too!&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;Alright, alright, now pipe down before you wake Jay up.  He might freak out, or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Simon accessed Bryan's general stats and changed his age to 16.<br />
<br />
   &quot;18,&quot; said Bryan.  Simon looked up questioningly.  &quot;I want to be 18,&quot; he repeated.  &quot;Or, better yet, 20!  Might as well do this right if we're going to do it.  Just because Jay is highly developed by the time he's 16 doesn't mean I'll be.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;Shush,&quot; whispered Simon, putting a finger to his lips.  &quot;Okay, okay, keep your pants on.&quot;  Simon thought about his figure of speech for a second.  &quot;On second thought, take them off.  You wouldn't want them squeezing your essentials once you grow out of them...literally.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Simon entered 20 in Bryan's age field and set the timer for three minutes.  Bryan finished stripping off his pants and socks, then looked at Simon expectantly.  &quot;Well?&quot; said Bryan, giving an impatient wave of his arms.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Shush,&quot; Simon said again.  &quot;It's just...you sure about this?  Maybe with a smaller age jump-&quot;<br />
<br />
   Bryan gave his infamous glare, signaling his impatience.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Alright, fine.  Just a suggestion.&quot;  Simon pressed the 'Apply' button.<br />
<br />
   For a moment, there was a pregnant silence in the air.  Simon stood there, clutching the Chronivac, feeling tense and unsure at Bryan's extreme eagerness for the drastic change.  Maybe he was one of those TFing nuts whose websites he stumbled across occasionally on the internet.  There were some pretty nasty things on those sites, too...  Bryan stood there, in his t-shirt and Superman boxers, fists clenched, eager for the changes to start.<br />
<br />
   After a few moments of nothing, Bryan relaxed a little and looked up at Simon questioningly.  &quot;Dude...that thing actually does stuff, right?  You're not playing me, are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
   Simon raised an eyebrow.  &quot;If I were, how would you explain Jay?&quot; Simon said, motioning to the overdeveloped 16 year old now sleeping on Simon's couch.<br />
<br />
   It was at that moment that Bryan's eyes suddenly widened.  &quot;Sy,&quot; Bryan said, using one of their old nicknames for Simon.  &quot;Sy, Simon.  I feel something.  Kinda...kinda like a pulling sensation...and-and like ants crawling on my skin...&quot;<br />
<br />
   Simon looked closely, and indeed started to notice a few changes.  He could see that Bryan was definitely growing taller.  He also noticed his muscles developing some.  Simon then noticed some faint hairs appearing on Bryan's legs, and also on his forearms.  It wasn't much of a noticeable change.  Heck, his own parents might not have noticed anything.  That was when Bryan his his growth spurt.<br />
<br />
   Bryan's growth became much more noticeable, and Simon estimated that Bryan was passing around 5'6&quot; or 7&quot;.  His muscles became more defined, but not as defined as Jay's.  Simon noticed a trail of hair leading up from Brian's boxers to his bellybutton was visible in the widening gap between his waistband and his t-shirt.  In fact, Bryan's t-shirt was beginning to look tight across his widening chest.  The hair on Bryan's legs and arms became much darker and thicker.  His hands and feet had also become larger, a little out of proportion with the rest of him.<br />
<br />
   Bryan flexed his arms.  &quot;Man, I'm gonna get pumped!&quot; he said in his deeper, more manly voice.  Simon vainly tried to shush him again, but to no avail.  However, Bryan's arms never really got, so to speak, &quot;pumped&quot;.  They got thicker, and a little more muscled, but nothing too astounding.  They stayed pretty much average.  Bryan felt a prickling sensation as his stubble began to grow in.  He reached up and felt his rough, angular jaw.  The stubble seemed concentrated on his jawline, and got sparse as it went to his cheeks.  He looked down at his arms to see the hair on them becoming a little thicker, moving on up to the backs of his hands.  He lifted up his tight shirt to see the hair had gone up to his chest, covering it in a fine coating, but nothing too extraordinary there, either.  He could feel the changes slowing, and was disappointed to see that he would just be a sort of average 20 year old.  He walked briskly to Simon's bathroom to see himself in the full-length mirror, careful not to trip over his new proportions.<br />
<br />
   He looked in and saw that he saw an average looking college student looking back.  At least he wasn't completely left out in the hair department...nor the male essentials department, either, judging by the bulge in the front of his boxers.  However, he could feel once last change coming on.  He held his breath in anticipation...only to be greatly disappointed.  He felt his boxer's waistband tightened and saw his abs lose their definition as a belly appeared.  It was slight and only bulged out a little, but it was enough.  Bryan noticed the flesh under his chin soften and sag a little too, threatening a second chin if more weight were gained.<br />
<br />
   Bryan sighed and turned to Simon, deflated (well, figuratively, anyway).  &quot;Well, this sucks.  Is this what I have to look forward to?  An average body and belly fat?&quot;<br />
<br />
   Simon rolled his eyes.  &quot;Maybe if you took better care of yourself, you would-&quot;  Simon was interrupted by a beep from the Chronivac.  &quot;It says that Stage 1 is complete...now applying Stage 2.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;Stage 2?&quot;<br />
<br />
   Simon smacked his forhead.  &quot;Duh!  The testosterone enhancement!  I almost forgot about that!.&quot;<br />
<br />
   This time it was Bryan who had to shush Simon.  &quot;Yeah, me too.  I hope it offers some improvements.&quot;<br />
<br />
   The effects were instantly noticeable.   All of Bryan's hair immediately thickened across his body.  His chest hair expanded to cover his entire chest and abdomen.  His forearm hair thickened and traveled to his upper arms, covering them generously.  His leg hair thickened and traveled up his thighs.  Bryan's sparse stubble thickened and covered his jaw, giving him a thick full beard.  He could also feel the tingles as the hair completely covered his shoulders and back, leaving no area uncovered.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Jeez...&quot; was all Simon could get out.<br />
<br />
   &quot;I know...&quot; was all Bryan could reply.  His voice was noticeably baritone and gravely.<br />
<br />
   Bryan also noticed his muscles thickening, becoming more and more defined.  He heard tearing sounds as his biceps and pecs began tearing at his t-shirt.  His widening thigh muscles were also making his extremely tight boxers very uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Dude,&quot; grunted Bryan.  &quot;Get me a pair of your dad's boxers...I think mine are gonna blow.&quot;  Simon nodded and ran off.<br />
<br />
   Bryan looked in the mirror and estimated he might be somewhere around six and a half feet.  He was getting huge!  His belly was now unnoticeable with all the hair and abdominal muscles.<br />
<br />
   Simon rushed back with a towel and a large pair of boxers.  &quot;The towel is for you to wrap up in until your change is finished.  Then you can change into the boxers.&quot;  Simon looked Bryan over.  &quot;If you can fit into them, that is.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Bryan felt his essential equipment stirring.  He new his boxers couldn't stand another second of this, they simply didn't share the strength of the hero whose logo was plastered all over them.  Bryan quickly wrapped the towel around his midsection as a sharp ripping sound was heard.  Little Superman-printed strips of tattered fabric fell around Bryan's extremely large and hairy feet.<br />
<br />
   Bryan could tell the changes were slowing down and felt significantly more satisfied with the new change.  According to the Chronivac, he was 20 years old, 6'9&quot;, and 250lbs.  But, just as Bryan was admiring his huge and hairy self, he felt a tingling across his scalp.  He ran his hand through his hair, which had kept its short buzz cut throughout the changes.  As he did, his hand came back with tufts of hair.  Bryan's eyes widened and pulse quickened.  He ran his other hand through and came back with more tufts.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Simon,&quot; Bryan rumbled, panicked.  &quot;Wh-what's happening?&quot;<br />
<br />
   Simon quickly read though the effects of the testosterone enhancement.  &quot;Uh-oh.  Sorry, Bryan, but it warns that there could be a possible increase of male balding.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;What!&quot;  Bryan took a comb and began to frantically comb through his hair, pulling out a few more large tufts.  He then took a towel and scrubbed his scalp for a couple seconds.  He took the towel away and took a look and his new fate.<br />
<br />
   All-in-all, it wasn't too bad.  The was significant receding of the hairline above his forehead, resulting in a peninsula of hair that looked like it was about to be closed off into an island.  There was also a large bald patch on the back of Bryan's head, with thinning hair around it.<br />
<br />
   Finally, Bryan just smirked.  &quot;Heh, I just can't win, can I.  Actually, I think I would prefer a body like this and go bald, than have a horribly average body with a pot belly.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Simon thought that the testosterone enhancement made Bryan looked much older than 20.  He thought Bryan could pass for a surprisingly wrinkle-free 40.<br />
<br />
   Just then, Simon heard movement behind him.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Dude, Sy,&quot; said the 16 year old Jay.  &quot;I'm not feeling too well.  I just feel, I dunno, like I'm uncoordinated or something, like my legs are too long.  And my skin feels like it's covered in cobwebs.&quot;  Jay stumbled a bit, a combination of being delirious from sleep, and not being used to his more developed body.<br />
<br />
   Just one Simon thought he could salvage the situation, Jay suddenly bolted upright and pointed at the new Bryan.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Sy!  Who the f### is that?!?&quot;</p>
