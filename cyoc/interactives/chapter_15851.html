<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I want to introduce you to a great friend of mine” Milton said to Max, as the two high school students walked down the street towards Ty’s house. “He could help you gain more muscle!”<br />
<br />
Max was about 5 foot 4 inches tall, he was short and chubby. He was slightly overweight and he hated the fact that he was horribly out of shape. He was just as much as a geek as Milton, that’s why he was completely amazed when Milton introduced himself to Max as the assistant’s of the computer lab at his high school.<br />
<br />
“How can Ty help me?” Max wondered. “Does he sell any protein drinks or some other types of vitamins or something? I just don’t want to be tricked into taking any drugs or anything in order to lose fat and gain more muscle…”<br />
<br />
“No, you’ll see. He might ask you to change your workout a little. I’ll let him explain it to you himself” Milton chuckled, as the two walked up to the front door of Ty’s house.<br />
<br />
Milton rang the doorbell, and Allen opened up. Allen was Ty’s best friend from school, and he escorted the two boys to Ty’s room, which was upstairs. Once Milton had introduced Ty to Max, he had explained to Ty what it was he wanted him to do for Max.<br />
<br />
“I can help you out” Ty began. “But, you’ll need to work for it! You’ll need to go to the gym tomorrow and help out everyone who is in need of a partner, a spotter, advice or just some encouragement.”<br />
<br />
Max gave Ty a surprised look on his face.<br />
<br />
“Really? Is that all?”<br />
<br />
“Yes” Ty replied. “You must be the most helpful, the most generous, and the most selfless guy in the gym tomorrow, and by the time you’ll leave the gym, you’ll be as big as Milton, without the fat!”<br />
<br />
Max just shrugged and nodded. It wasn’t the answer that he expected from Ty. But, he didn’t have a problem with it, so he decided he was going to follow Ty’s instructions no matter what, even though it seemed rather strange to him that just being helpful in the gym would be sufficient to make him grow.<br />
<br />
After Milton and Max had left Ty’s house, Max began to wonder why this had anything to do with him losing fat and gaining muscle.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Ty has his strange methods for making things happen. Just do what he says and you’ll see!” Milton assured him.<br />
<br />
The following afternoon, Milton was standing in front of the entrance of the gym, waiting for Max to show up. When Max finally arrived, they went in and walked directly towards the locker room, where they both changed into their workout clothes.<br />
<br />
Milton started to work out on his own, while Max just wandered around the workout area of the gym. <br />
<br />
Max had helped a teen to work on the bicep machines. After that, he helped an older man to work out using the bench press. Once he was done with that, Max proceeded to the free weights area, where he assisted several guys who were looking for spotters.<br />
<br />
After that, Max encouraged another teen who started out on the treadmill. He pedaled on the stationary bike besides a lady who had just joined the gym, and he talked to another student who was just as chubby and overweight as he was.<br />
<br />
After all was said and done, Milton looked up Max, who was busy helping another lady out, using the leg extension machine.<br />
<br />
“Alright, Max. I need to get going. How was your workout?” Milton asked him.<br />
<br />
“It went great, for the others. I really didn’t get to do much, because I spent so much time helping others in the gym rather than just focus on my own workout.” Max said with a touch of sadness in his voice. “I just don’t see how this could help me.”<br />
<br />
“It doesn’t matter! You’re helping others! Ty said that you’ll be rewarded for your help!” Milton assured him.<br />
<br />
As soon as Milton and max had walked out of the showers in the locker room, they examined each other’s bodies as they admired their reflections in the large mirror which was hanging over the counter where there were two sinks.<br />
<br />
“Well, you look great, Milton!” Max said to his friend. “I wish I could say the same about my own body…”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Max was overcome by an odd feeling in his legs. He couldn’t move!<br />
<br />
“What’s the matter?” Milton wondered, as he saw the look of shock on Max’s face.<br />
<br />
“I can’t move my legs! What’s going on?”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean, you can’t move your…” Milton said.<br />
<br />
“Aaah!” Max shouted, as his body started to change.<br />
<br />
Max looked down at his body, while Milton continued to stare at him as well.<br />
<br />
The fat on his legs slowly melted away, as the legs suddenly became slender and firm. <br />
<br />
Next, Max’s big stomach slowly started to melt away. Fat seemed to be pouring out of him, as the stomach deflated like air that was being let out of a balloon. Within seconds, his stomach was as flat as a board!<br />
<br />
After that, his pecs slowly shrunk down to size, as fat disappeared from his body. His thick, flabby arms suddenly became much thinner, as the layers of fat disappeared from his body. Max was now staring at the reflection of a skinny high school student!<br />
<br />
“It’s all gone! The fat is gone!” Max cheered.<br />
<br />
The second phase of the transformation began at that moment, where the muscle started to grow, now that all the fat had been taken out of his body.<br />
<br />
Slowly but surely, Max’s calves inflated like balloons, until they resembled two footballs, which were attached to his lower legs. His quads inflated as well, with layers of muscle forming on them, making them thick and rock solid. Thick rivers of veins slowly crept to the surface, covering his legs from the knees up to the quads.<br />
<br />
Abdominals began to push out of his flat stomach, forming neat rows of muscle tiles over the area, which used to be a large ball of fat. His abs were solid and hard as well.<br />
<br />
Finally, Max’s pectorals began to inflate as well, slowly turning into two large spheres of muscle mass. His shoulders widened as they grew, and his deltoids, his lats, triceps and biceps grew all at the same time. Max was truly becoming massive!<br />
<br />
Ty didn’t hold back! Max was becoming massive! In fact, he was almost freakish, as large, thick slabs of muscle covered the body, which had held nothing more than pound upon pound of fat cells for the most of his life.<br />
<br />
After the transformation had completed, Max could only smile at his reflection, as he posed before the mirror for the very first time.<br />
<br />
“I guess Ty couldn’t grow you any bigger than that! You’re maxed out, Max!” Milton chuckled, as he looked at his partner.<br />
<br />
“This is awesome! I have a little nephew, who would just go crazy if he were to see me like this!” Max laughed, as he flexed his muscles one more time.<br />
<br />
“We can go to Ty’s house and tell him about your nephew. What’s he like?” Milton asked him.<br />
<br />
Max was going to tell Milton about his nephew. He was like…</p>
