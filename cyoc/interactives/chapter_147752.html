<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As dean of the engineering department, Bruce Bullheart always had his students&#39; best interests at heart. It was the reason he never let up on them. They needed strong discipline not to be led awry.  A teacher always showed the right example. <br />
<br />
Him being turned into his own cock was irrelevant. He was a model of penis. He had had offers to become a porn star in his youth, from the sheer quality of his cock. At worst, his new state as a sexual organ offered a minimal distraction to his students and himself. But that drone had given him unrestricted access and ability to monitor his students during their finals. <br />
<br />
An unexpectedly high number of them had been unable to keep their eyes on their sheets. They doubtlessly deserved their punishment. If it could even be called one. Bruce was of the opinion that this was an improvement to many. Revealing their primal states of being as penises could only help their confidence in their status of real men. <br />
<br />
So, he had no remorse to call out Hugo at the slightest hint of foul play. This way, he got Adam, Benjamin, Oliver, Lucas, Joey and Mason dicked right in the middle of the exam. Spending some time as their own dicks would give them a bit of perspective. <br />
<br />
Still, as he had hovered about the amphitheater, amused that Danny was passing his exam via some complicated contraptions attached to his cock, Bruce had wondered. He was an educator. His role was to get young men to develop to be the best people they could. Perhaps, this was an opportunity in itself. <br />
<br />
Matthew. A quiet young man, did his work to the best of his capacity. Cooperated with anyone placed on his teams during labs and group projects. None of his teachers had ever spoken a ill word about him. Despite the commotion, he&#39;d never once looked away from his exam (unlike Lucas, for example).<br />
<br />
Well, Bruce had substituted for gym duties many times before. He&#39;d had to clean up the locker rooms. He sometimes caught a glimpse of students. He&#39;d never thought anything about that, young men were unashamed of their bodies amongst themselves for good reasons. As a teacher, he had always kept a very professional distance anyway. They would fool around between themselves at their leasure. <br />
<br />
Matthew, despite his work ethic, was a disappointment. The rumors and his own attitude did not lie. He was wasting his most important asset in life. <br />
<br />
So, Bruce had slowly gotten his drone to approach Matthew&#39;s seat, keeping an eye out of potential cheaters all the while. His flight remained uninterrupted, fortunately, and he twitched in anticipation. His soft shaft hardened, knowing that he was about to do the right thing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Matthew Baker, caught at 10:07 am,&quot; he had announced loud and clear. <br />
<br />
Matthew had looked up in shock, surprised written all over his face as he began to protest: &quot;What? No, I wa-&quot;<br />
<br />
The rest of the sentence had been lost to the camera&#39;s flash. Bruce wanted to grin, which translated to a few jolts of his dick body and a spurt of pre on the edge of his drone. Matthew might finally learn what to do with a God&#39;s given gift such as the tool between his legs. Even Bruce, a very morally upright man with strong convictions, found it hard not to be lost to lust every waking moment he spent as his own dick. <br />
<br />
&quot;This one,&quot; he&#39;d whispered to Hugo once he had returned to the front desk, &quot;needs a bit of a reeducation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo had raised an eyebrow, noting data in his tablet. <br />
<br />
So, Bruce had added, &quot;He&#39;s still a virgin.&quot; as an explanation. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
&#39;Reeducation?&#39; Hugo thought to himself as he sat down in his lab, what did that even mean? Humans had the most peculiar ideas about their places in the universe. Drastic shifts such as becoming their dicks would of course alter how a man thought, but even then he was not certain what Bruce Bullheart had meant. <br />
<br />
Not that it mattered too much in the long run. His opinion held little sway with a homan. Hugo&#39;s superiors had sent him a few virtual documents congratulating him on his findings so far and encouraging him to diversify his range of experiments on the dicked humans. Some of the scientists back home might be on the way to a breakthrough. In the meantime, he had full license to keep up his experiment. Willingness, mental effects, resistance. He was to document everything about dicking men. Gladly. <br />
<br />
He&#39;d spread out the seven cocks he had collected during the finals on one of the lab&#39;s worktable. Files. He always had so much files to fill in for this. He was a researcher at heart, but even he could only stare at some many tantalizing dicks for so long without feeling an itch. So, maybe he *had* sucked a few of them into fully erect states. He could not be blamed. <br />
<br />
Hugo rolled back the measuring tape with a satisfied hum. <br />
<br />
Matthew, glimmering with Hugo&#39;s saliva, was twelve inches long, slightly above average in girth, with balls to match. Of all the males transformed so far, only he could compete with Bruce in sheer size. He was the prize of his new lot. <br />
<br />
Seven new cocks for his collection, ranging otherwise from five to nine inches, with Matthew as the proud outlier. <br />
<br />
Still, it wasn&#39;t a bad idea to try and perfect his methods with new subjects. He only had a handful of his first batch of frat bros around. <br />
Those were strapped to the machines of his lab to test their stamina, mostly, or their willpower. Needless to say, he had only a bunch of very willing dicks on hand at this point. #2 (Paul, seven inches, cut, curvy and most often than not hard as steel), #3 (Alexander, eight inches, just long enough to be floppy, uncut) and #6 (Sebastien, eight inches, cut, drooling pre all the time) had, according to their thought scanners, not even noticed their speakers were muted. They had not interest in human communication anymore. Thus, their numbering. Hugo had no problem leaving Perry with them. He wasn&#39;t even sure if they would respond to their human names at this point.  <br />
<br />
Isaac (#8, six inches, shy around Hugo, nice bouncy balls) had stopped mentionning wanting to be turned back, even if he still held conversations with Hugo when it was time to test him. Mostly, on the best milking equipment in the lab. His enthusiasm was almost endearing. He would surely help pitch the dicking transformation when Hugo sold him to a new customer. <br />
<br />
New dicks would let him gather fresh data for comparisons&#39; purpose and to advance his manipulation techniques. If only he could decide how to approach these new candidates. He&#39;d rather not deal with another round of &quot;No, please, change me back. This is a mistake!&quot; or some threats about breaking his teeth. It was almost inevitable when the transformed men hadn&#39;t asked for the dicking. <br />
<br />
Hugo was running out of speaker chips to surgically insert under the dicks&#39; skin too. A new batch would be teleported soon, likely on the morrow, but for the time being he had to choose which would be allowed to talk and which would be stuck as voiceless penises. <br />
<br />
It would probably be for the best to label some of them. Though, in all honesty, he had not paid a lot of attention to the students&#39; names when he had dicked them. Their personal belongings had been brought to Hugo via drone, but he couldn&#39;t remember exactly which cocks were which students besides Matthew. They more or less all fit the IDs he had. Any of them could be a Lucas or a Benjamin. Or none. He knew none of their distinctive features. Only that they were dicks. <br />
<br />
Hmmm, wasn&#39;t that an idea? Dehumanization was a process he&#39;d of course encountered during his researches. It had a very powerful impact on a person&#39;s psyche. And that was without reshaping their bodies. With the dicking camera, Hugo could uniquely destroy a man&#39;s mind to leave him nothing but a beast of sexual impulses. Perry so far had responded well to the idea that he was only a penis, that he had never been a human to begin with, even if Hugo&#39;s treatment of him was still somewhat humane. <br />
<br />
Dave had been entirely opposed to his fate as a motionless cock until Hugo had isolated him for days on end. Stuck as a penis without a voice and without any interactions, he&#39;d broken down and accepted everything Hugo had told him just to get a semblance of life back.  <br />
<br />
It was always the best feeling when he put one of those arrogant human-dicks in their place. They never understood where they stood until he spelled it out for them. <br />
<br />
Hugo closed his tablet and put it down in the table with more force than necessary. The surface trembled, and the dicks could only feel the vibration resonate through their flesh. &quot;Alright. You must be wondering what is going to happen to you. I bet most of you are excited.&quot;<br />
<br />
He paced around the table, circling the line-up of penises like a predator. When he disappeared from their view, he deliberately slowed, just to make them ponder a bit longer. <br />
<br />
He grabbed the edges of the table, leaned in and hissed angrily. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t be.&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the longer cocks (eight inches, Hugo could tell at a glance) quivered. <br />
<br />
&quot;What you saw during the exam was just convenience for me. Bruce Bullheart is a useful idiot. I gave him a drone, which I can remotely take control of at any time I want, so he would spread the idea of being dicked as something normal for men. He even offered you seven as sacrificial dicks for my purpose. He was all too happy to see you reduced to penises. Think about it for a second.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matthew seemed to want to shrink on himself, but even then he was bigger than his next rival. Hugo was starting to see what Bruce had meant. Oh well, it made it easier to sound stern and cruel. <br />
<br />
&quot;Effective immediately, you seven no longer are humans. You are dicks. That is everything you are. You no longer have names. You have designations. Models twenty-one to twenty-seven. Which one of you is which number isn&#39;t even important.&quot;<br />
<br />
This time, the fear seemed shared between all seven new dicks. <br />
<br />
&quot;If you thought you would be like Danny, free to be carried around on campus and to be used as toys for fun, you are sorely mistaken. I&#39;m sure you must have tried to speak already as well and found out you couldn&#39;t. That was me using my super advanced technology as a favor to them. But you? You will not be given voices. You won&#39;t need them. Your ideas are unimportant. Your dreams, your personality, your relationships, all of that is now irrelevant. Dicks have no need for any of that. Dicks are only needed for one thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Without warning, the eight incher spewed three long strings of cum all over the table. It puddled under him and spread to the two adjacent dicks. Even after cumming though, the cock remained rock hard. Hugo almost smiled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Hugo said coldly. &quot;One of you already understands his purpose. Unfortunately, Model Twenty-Three did so without my authorization. Therefore, I will be have to discipline him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo lifted the hard cock from the table and shoved him in the pocket of his lab coat. <br />
<br />
&quot;As for the rest of you, I will leave you here to lie down there, immobile, as good dicks should.&quot;<br />
<br />
Somewhere behind Hugo, an electronical bell chimed. Instantly, Hugo&#39;s expression lifted into one of careful benevolence and consideration. Picking his tablet back up, he headed for a sealed machine whose multiple glass tubes were filled with hard cocks. After a little bit of fiddling, he opened one of them with a pneumatic hiss and extracted his favorite model left. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Model #7, what are your conclusions about the new extractor?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fucking amazing, sir!&quot; Perry twitched in Hugo&#39;s grasp, clear liquid drizzling down the length of his dickhead. &quot;It hits just the right spot. Right there under my head. It&#39;s like you pumped me full of nutri-cum!&quot;<br />
<br />
Perry&#39;s excitement spoke well for the future. He was even using Hugo&#39;s terminology naturally now. It would be a shame to dash his new perception of reality and reveal to him that he indeed used to be a man. Well, he could always postpone that for now. Maybe once he had finished his new experiment on the 21-27 batch. <br />
<br />
Hugo smiled. &quot;Perfect. Let me put you in a stasis tank for now. I&#39;ll have a few stress tests for you later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t wait!&quot;<br />
<br />
In a few seconds, he&#39;d placed Perry in his nutri-cum bath and left him to drift under the gaze of the remaining cocks. The contrast in treatment between them (tools, powerless sexual organs) and Perry (cooperative model who knew he was meant to be a dick) would begin to work wonders on their minds. <br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t wait to see the results.</p>
