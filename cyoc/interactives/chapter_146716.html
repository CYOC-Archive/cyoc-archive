<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joan&#39;s heart was hammering in her chest as she led her husband to the bedroom. She motioned for him to sit on the bed then locked and bolted the door behind her. Slowly walking towards him her mind was going a mile a minute. She had to show her husband her changes. But how could she show him the marks on her body that proved she was weak and had given in to base urges. Especially since she had done it more than once.<br />
<br />
*Skritch-Skritch* Henry scribbled away on his notepad. Joan took a quick sniff of the air. There was definitely a linger of the goaty piss smell from her activities, no matter how much she had cleaned up this morning; but it wasn&#39;t excessive, and more of a mild whiff, than a full blown stench.<br />
<br />
&#39;So you changed too? Can I see the tail?&#39;<br />
<br />
Her stomach dropped. Henry looked supportive and kind. He always had kind eyes. <br />
Biting her lip she nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; Closing her eyes she turned around, facing away from him. Squatting down, wobbling for a moment on her unsure hooves tucked hidden in boots, she grabbed the lower hem of the dress she wore. Fingers slipped to the back of the dress. Slowly she rose, pulling the dress up with her. Squeezing her legs together she made sure there was no gap for Henry to possibly see her dangling fat penis. One thing at a time.<br />
<br />
Henry&#39;s eyes bugged as his wife straightened up, dress catching on the bottom of her ass for just a moment before rising and revealing her clenched cheeks. Though in her early forties an starting to sag and expand, Henry loved his wife&#39;s body, his heart always jumped at seeing her naked, this was no exception. What was unique this time though, was the short stubby, hairy tail that poked out over the top of her ass cleft. As it had been said by Jess, he did recognise it as a Goat&#39;s tail. His hand rose to his mouth, partly covering it in awe at the sight. Though he had seen Jess&#39;s tail up close and James&#39;s ears, seeing his wife changed was quite a bit more to take in.<br />
<br />
Joan, hearing nothing for several moments, turned her head and caught her husband&#39;s eye, seeing the look of shock in his face. She turned back, cheeks reddened and ashamed. Not a moment passed and Joan jumped at the feeling of her husband&#39;s hand on her thigh. Obscenely her dangling penis flopped around at the movement, though she kept her senses enough to keep her legs clamped together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Henry...&quot; She turned to look at him. He stared up at her, eyes wide and with adoration plastered across them. Though Joan suspected he was putting on the show to lift her spirits and boost her confidence, she appreciated it all the same. He was trying to make her feel okay with the change, and that was a kind thing to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; She gently spoke, as Henry grinned. Turning back to her ass.<br />
<br />
He lent in, kissing one cheek, then the other, finally rising and gently kissing the tip of her hairy tail. The feeling tickled, and made her tail twitch. Joan giggled and half spasmed to get away from the tickling sensation. Again her penis wobbled around between her thighs, but this time with a feeling of pressure bubbling in her crotch. Looking down she could see the penis had gotten fatter, now no longer dangling down, instead pointing down at a thirty degree angle. <br />
<br />
Henry, sensing his wife&#39;s mood was increasing, went back in, kissing her, ass and tail again. Joan, giggled again, though this time prepared for the sensation and didn&#39;t jump at the tail tickle. The building pressure from her crotch increased, raising her penis to stick out, half grown, with the foreskin slowly rolling back revealing the tip of the bulbous head. Adrenaline built at the thought of how exciting it would be to show Henry and to let him fuck her with her dick flopping all around. Imagining it she squeezed down on her kegels, the adrenaline sank down, flooding her dick with that fantastic feeling, she watched as it rose ever higher, foreskin rolling further and further until the mushroom head popped free. God she wanted to put her hands on the limb and tear away at it, but so far, she had enough control. Joan had to keep it that way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehehe-Henry, stop it!&quot; She called back good natured. Turning she saw him pull back grinning, his mission complete, his wife was smiling again. Quickly he picked up the pad and began writing again.<br />
<br />
Joan took this time to look back around at her erection. It hadn&#39;t softened at all, though it did seem to be angling back a little more forward, like something was pulling on it. Angling her neck she gasped as she saw what was pulling on it. The tingling feeling from the underside of her cock was coming from a newly grown scrotum, pink, bald, and surprisingly large. <br />
<br />
Again her stomach jumped at the sight, the penis and balls looked delicious, which was fuelling her horniness. To get it out of sight as quickly as possible she dropped the hem of her dress letting it fall back down over her tail, ass legs and dick. Though the fabric caught in front, bunching on her rod like a coat hanger, forcing her to quickly flip the fabric forward.<br />
<br />
Fully down now, it was still painfully obvious that she had a tenting erection. not wanting Henry to see, she panicked for a moment, then remembered what Henry, and all her male friends used to laugh and joke about, flipping an erection into a waistband during their horny teenage years to hide it. Joan wasn&#39;t wearing pants, but she did have a belt on around her midriff, over the dress.<br />
<br />
Glancing back to see Henry still scribbling and concentrating on the paper she shimmied down the belt to her waist, then carefully twisted and pushed the penis up and under the belt. A few tugs and twists of the fabric and it was secure. For good measure she pulled down the belt a little bit more, securing it for when it inevitably went soft.<br />
<br />
She turned in time to see Henry finish and show her the paper.<br />
<br />
&#39;I think it looks cute honey.<br />
Really accentuates all that junk in your trunk.<br />
It&#39;ll be something to play with when we get out of here and everything&#39;s back to normal.&#39;<br />
<br />
The thought of keeping the tail, even after their return somehow seemed exciting to Joan. If she could keep it, it would be a naughty secret, something to keep hidden from her work colleagues, something only shared in the bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Henry, Hearing, or... Well... Seeing that means a lot to me.&quot;<br />
She reached out, stroking her husbands face. He smiled and rose, holding his wife by the shoulders reassuringly. Leaning in he pecked her on the lips.<br />
<br />
Joan, at that moment, realised a flaw in her plan to flip her cock under her belt. Securing it tightly now had created an environment where it had constant pressure, and any movement of her body was the same as grinding her hand across it. Rising horny adrenaline aside, she did think for a moment that there was a lot she didn&#39;t know about operating one of these.<br />
<br />
Henry, kiss over, leaned in, wrapping his arms fully around his wife&#39;s upper body and gently squeezed. Joan, not wanting his lower half to come in contact with her rock hard erection pulled her hips away, again causing her dick to shift and pulse under the pressure of the belt. She even felt the tip touch a fold of her belly pudge. It felt wet and slimy with pre-cum. She loved that  feeling. She always had. Watching Henry&#39;s dick leak pre and playing with the clear gooey fluid had been one of Joan&#39;s favourite bedroom games.<br />
<br />
Things were getting dicey. Joan was getting very excited, more and more her brain was telling her to just wank and get it done with, with the other half telling her she couldn&#39;t let Henry find out...</p>
