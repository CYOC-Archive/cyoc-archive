<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason trudged his way to the house, rolling a sore shoulder. Dean had stayed back to help Shiloh with one last task but they both had insisted Jason return to the house. He felt guilty, like he wasn&#39;t pulling his own weight, it was a weird feeling for the once slacker. Truth was, he still wasn&#39;t pulling his own weight, or maybe he was considering he weighed so much less than those two. Either way, neither of them seemed to hold it against him, and when even Shiloh spoke up to reassure him it was fine he knew he should just head back.<br />
<br />
It was Friday, and his fifth full day on the farm. Things were getting easier, and he now knew, not just suspected that he was getting bigger. No one commented on it though, and he didn&#39;t exactly know how to ask. But no one was freaking out, so he just kept on going.<br />
<br />
Not muddy, just a bit dusty and sweaty, meant he could use the front door and the upstairs shower rather than the one at the back of the house. He still kicked off his work boots at the front door before stepping inside. He grinned as he looked down at his bare feet, he had actually needed to borrow a different pair of boots from Dean, the old ones had gotten too tight, and he wasn&#39;t rolling up the cuffs of the overalls as much as he had.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you&#39;ve been selling the boy short, Roy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason stopped as he neared his uncle Rex&#39;s office, the door was ajar, his uncles voice came out a bit stern as he spoke Jason&#39;s father&#39;s name.<br />
<br />
&quot;He hasn&#39;t given me a peep of trouble. He&#39;s a good worker, Dean and Shiloh love having him around, a little bit of sourness the first day was to be expected, since then he&#39;s been as good as I could have wished.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason felt a swelling in his chest at those words. He&#39;d never heard his dad speak of him that way.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. It just proves you should have sent him to me four years ago like you were supposed to. You and River were wrong to take him away. This is where he belongs.&quot; Jason winced at hearing his mother&#39;s name. His dad never took her being brought up well. After another long pause. &quot;It is. I was afraid it wouldn&#39;t after having been put off, but it is. Quicker than usual, too, like it&#39;s trying to catch up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rex was quiet so long he thought the conversation might be over, then. &quot;He&#39;s eighteen, Roy. I&#39;ll let him make his own choice. If he decides he wants to stay, I won&#39;t force him to leave. You could always come here to visit though, maybe remember that this is your home, too.&quot; A deep sigh came from Rex as he hung up the phone. &quot;You might as well come in, Jason.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason gave a start and peered around the doorframe and into the office. It was a pretty nice place. A desk with a computer, documents organized into binders on one shelf, lots of books old and new on another. Another wall was covered in prizes and awards from various fairs, and a series of family photos the oldest of which were in that brownish sepia color. Rex looked thoughtful, but not angry, so he slipped inside. &quot;Sorry, I just.. I didn&#39;t mean to..&quot; The excuses died in his mouth, he didn&#39;t want to make excuses to this man. &quot;That wasn&#39;t the right thing to do, sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rex just nodded then grinned. &quot;Told him he was selling you short. I think it&#39;s time I explained a few things to you.&quot; He motioned to another chair in the office. Jason took a seat, setting his boot down next to the chair. Rex stood and walked around his desk to lean back against it right in front of Jason, giving him a critical once over. He reached out and gave Jason&#39;s bare upper arm a squeeze. &quot;Damn, it really is doing a number on you. Normally it&#39;d be months before it was obvious but just a few days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean the growth?&quot; Jason asked.<br />
<br />
Rex nodded. &quot;Normally it starts when we hit fourteen, works over the next four years or so. Slow, gradual. With you it seems to be trying to make up for lost time and catch you up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Puberty?&quot; Jason looked up at his uncle, that broad chest straining his plaid shirt as he folded arms over his chest.<br />
<br />
Rex just laughed. &quot;Beyond that. The family.. gift I guess is the best word for it. We&#39;ve been on this land for generations and have a deal with it. As long as we work it and protect it, it makes sure we are strong enough to do so. There&#39;s more to it than that, like the fact we only have two kids each generation, both boys. Other things that&#39;s too much to get into now. But, you just need to know what&#39;s happening to you is meant to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your.. mother wasn&#39;t a big fan of our family gift when she found out about it and convinced your father to take you and leave with her. When she passed away I hoped the two of you would come back but your father is a stubborn one. I took me years to finally convince him to send you here.&quot; Rex frowns as he recalled the history.<br />
<br />
&quot;He sent me because I didn&#39;t want to go to school and couldn&#39;t find a job.. Because I wouldn&#39;t.&quot; Jason admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;And he complained to me and I planted the idea of sending you out here to straighten you out a bit. You were past the years the gift worked anyway, probably would ignore you.&quot; Rex grinned a smile. &quot;I hoped it wasn&#39;t true, but I needed to convince your dad.&quot; Jason found himself smiling, knowing this man he didn&#39;t really know had been fighting for him. &quot;I bet you weren&#39;t even as bad as he said. Maybe you just felt out of place, like you were where you didn&#39;t belong, like something was missing and you couldn&#39;t place it. Feelings that have been gone since you got here?&quot; Jason nodded. &quot;We all feel that way when we&#39;re away too long. To be gone from here almost your whole life.&quot; He reached out and grabbed Jason&#39;s shoulder giving it a squeeze. &quot;There&#39;s more about our family and the gift I need to tell you but that&#39;s enough to process for now. Go get cleaned up, dinner will be in a few.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason stood up and hugged his uncle, the man seeming shocked for a moment then returning the gesture with a bear hug of his own than made Jason&#39;s ribs creak. He grabbed his shoes and headed upstairs. He quickly stripped down in his bedroom and grabbed his towel. Hopping into the hot water of the shower felt fantastic on his sore muscles, soaping up as he washed off the dirt and grime.<br />
<br />
One spot on his chest was being stubborn though, a dark spot on between his burgeoning chest muscles that looked like some dark mud that dripped down his stomach. He gave it another scrub but it was still there. He frowned and ran his fingers along it. Short hairs prickled his fingers. He traced the line of hairs right down the middle of his stomach which had begun to tighten up, right to his pubes which had been thickening over the last couple of days as his balls swelled. There hadn&#39;t been much change in his cock, but his balls were really beginning to hang.<br />
<br />
Jason hopped out of the shower and dried off, feeling better than he had in, well, ever. Things were only changing for the better. He strode into the hallway, nearly bumping into Dean who pointed at his chest. &quot;Hey!&quot; Dean&#39;s own chest was only display, pretty much covered in curly blond hairs. &quot;This is a celebration day. Beers and a movie after dinner?&quot; Jason blushed a little but nodded and slipped back into his room to get dressed for dinner.</p>
