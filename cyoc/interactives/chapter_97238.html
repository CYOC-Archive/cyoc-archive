<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I am enthralled by the images crossing the screen at such a speed that even if I were in a conscious state I wouldn&#39;t have been able to identify them but they were making their presence known to my psyche.<br />
<br />
It plays and plays for such an indeterminate amount of time I didn&#39;t notice that all the lights in the room had gone dark primarily due to the fact that it was night and I hadn&#39;t turned on any lights.<br />
<br />
When a knock came at the door a man stood there and put a collar around my neck and padlocked it. I followed him out to his truck that had a trailer attached. I went in the back and saw several other vacant faces just as they might have known mine was if they were conscious.<br />
<br />
I felt the truck lurch and we were off. <br />
<br />
Several stops later and we were full of collared men crowded into the back of the trailer. Each one with a different build.<br />
<br />
As we headed off to our final destination there was a wafting of some odor I couldn&#39;t identify but would eventually become very familiar with. It was the smell of straw.<br />
<br />
We pulled up and were backed into a structure I would find out was a barn. <br />
<br />
We were led into a pen and chained to a bar that was close to the ground such that it made it difficult to stand not that we wanted to anyway.<br />
<br />
A man on overalls came around to each one of us and stripped our clothes off and we remained in the barn falling into a deep sleep.<br />
<br />
As we woke in the morning we noticed another screen playing the same hypnotic DVD to all of us. Well an extended version. That was when I would have noticed that we had all begun to take on the mannerisms of pigs if I were conscious.<br />
<br />
We began to walk on all fours. We grunted and oinked as if to talk to others. Later that morning the man in overalls came through and we had a pig tail dildo stuck in our asses.<br />
<br />
And we were slopped for the first time. A slurry of food was dumped into the trough nearest to the bar we were chained to and we dug in. We couldn&#39;t help it. We had no will of our own to stop this.<br />
<br />
As each one bloated with as much as they could stuff in their bellies they would fall over on their sides and sleep. <br />
<br />
There were some big men. Chubby men that could eat and eat. But I was not one of those. But I wasn&#39;t one of the twinks that had a hard time with much of the slop.<br />
<br />
The couple of muscle boys that I saw ate more than I would have thought but they were probably use to eating huge amounts to keep up their physique. It was a shame the they would not have that body for long.<br />
<br />
As we woke from our slumber we were individually taken to a pen and a hose was stuck up our asses and we were forcefully emptied of out contents. Getting us ready for our next feeding.<br />
<br />
The days went on like this. The lack of exercise soon showed on everyone&#39;s body even the twinks that showed the least were showing a bit of a belly. <br />
<br />
That was when we were taken to our own pens in the barn. I could only see five of the other men. One had been chubby to begin with and this had done well to fatten him. Two were muscle men and the changes showed even more on their bodies. The muscle quickly dissolved into fat and the lack of constant workouts left their bodies a mess. One was like me and one was a twink.<br />
<br />
We remained in our pens with the same routine for the next week when the twink was taken away. It was a month before he returned and he was easily as bit as the chubby guy that was across from me but with a lot less definition than him. There was so little muscle on him that he could barely move.<br />
<br />
The muscle boys were the next ones taken one by one and each one came back huge but with the muscle on them the fat was able to be moved as they crawled on their hands and knees as we all did just like pigs.<br />
<br />
The fat one was keeping up the gain so I was the next one taken. I was put into a very confined pen. A hose was stuck in my mouth which I obediently swallowed and I realized I was being constantly fed. The pig tail had been removed because the food in was almost enough to force the other food out. It was a constant feeding for the week.<br />
<br />
I was enormous.<br />
<br />
Not nearly the biggest but I had to have been well over 500 by that time.<br />
<br />
And the other was also taken in and fattened up.<br />
<br />
They took the twink in a second time before the took the chubby guy in and he couldn&#39;t move when he came back he was rolled out on a trolley that had him suspended face down in a web of nylon straps that held him up off the floor.<br />
<br />
I would have wondered if I was going to be that big and not able to move if I had any conscious thought but I didn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
That was when things changed.<br />
<br />
We were rounded up and put into a much larger trailer and I saw many of the men that began this journey. All the twinks were immobile and had to be trolleyed into the trailer. One of the chubby guys had to be trolleyed in and two of the muscle men were on trolleys.<br />
<br />
The rest of us walked in on our hands and knees and all I heard were oinks and squeals.<br />
<br />
We were taken to a large arena where we were staged in a large holding pen where I could see other pens full of fat men.<br />
<br />
One by one the pens were led into the arena where we were auctioned off to men in the stands. Mostly middle eastern but all wanted to own their own fat American pig.<br />
<br />
As we were sold an envelope was given to the new owner.<br />
<br />
I found out what that envelope was when we got to his home. He read the note to me that brought back my memories of the entire events that is how I can relate this to you. <br />
<br />
My owner also bought 20 other men. some from my sty. Yes I still have pig memories. One had been a muscle man and my owner never read his envelope to him. He remained a pig but a big picture of him was hung over the pen he was in as were all of our original pictures.<br />
<br />
The five twinks he bought were taken care of by a handler. Feeding them by hand. They had no chance of ever getting away so they were given back their memories and he might have regretted that because they were always whining about how they looked but they were the most prized pigs at the events the master threw. They were stuffed with food from one end and fucked at the other.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed the events. I was housed and fed and fucked and I didn&#39;t have to do anything.<br />
<br />
Not many were gay. I wasn&#39;t gay but I enjoyed my stimulation. It wasn&#39;t always a dick. Some times it was a dildo. Some times it was a cucumber or other long thin vegetable. And occasionally it was an arm.<br />
<br />
The muscle boy that remained a pig thought he was a sow and he would be fucked by many men but on occasion they would lead in a real pig to fuck him. And he would squeal in delight.</p>
