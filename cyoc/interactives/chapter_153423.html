<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;...Totally the Football Guys.&quot; Kelly responded, after a moment&#39;s hesitation. She admitted she liked the sheer variation the roles brought in terms of build. There were the big, brawny and thick linebackers like Gary and Matt, the toned and almost fitness model level good looking quarterback Terry, and the thinner and quick footed running backs and such.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Kells, any particular football guy got your eye?&quot; Brittany asked, cutting right to the chase.<br />
<br />
Kelly admitted outloud, &quot;I-I really like Matt, from the Varcity Team. He&#39;s...he&#39;s really dreamy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brittany chuckled and tried to inform Kelly, &quot;Uhh, Earth to Kelly, Matt is like, gay. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s gonna---&quot;<br />
<br />
Kelly pouted a bit and replied, &quot;Well, explain what happened last week! Matt and I were doing an assignment for history. He caught me when I fell from the stepladder...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Danger prone Kelly alert!&quot; Tracey interjected, and the others hushed her to let Kelly continue the story.<br />
<br />
&quot;...And he caught me! I hugged him tight to thank him, and he returned the favor! He&#39;s so big and strong...we just stayed there like that for a few minutes, I-I even think we were gonna kiss...&quot; Kelly got somewhat starry eyed as she remembered what happened, and just standing there in the jacket made her think about the warmth of Matt&#39;s body, his gentle, strong hands...<br />
<br />
Brittany sighed and said, &quot;Look, Kells, I want to make sure with this. Did he really do all of that? I just don&#39;t want you getting all dejected if he goes and sleeps with a guy when you&#39;re trying to get with him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tracey laughed loudly, &quot;Leave it to Kelly to fall head over heels for the gay guy.&quot; She took out her phone and went over to Kelly, showing her a picture of Matt - him and his peroxide blond hair, bright blue eyes, all dressed up in a crop top that only barely covered his enormous pecs, and aptly showed his cobblestone abs, shiny neon pink boots completing the look, &quot;See? That&#39;s from his IG.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kelly looked at the pictures, and even looked at Matt&#39;s Instagram, seeing him in even more flattering and showy outfits. The eighteen year old senior was living the life, apparently...but she decided she didn&#39;t mind it. &quot;Let me try, and if he says no, I&#39;ll leave it be...&quot;<br />
<br />
Brittany pointed outside, and shouted, &quot;Kelly, I think your time is now. Take a look!&quot; She and the rest of the girls watched as Matt jogged by outside the place on his daily jog. He was dressed in a skimpy pink crop top, short shorts, and tight sneaker shoes with bright neon washed colors.<br />
<br />
Kelly was feeling shy just thinking about going up to him, and even moreso now that she actually saw he really did dress like that in day to day life. She however decided if she didn&#39;t get this off her chest she would never be able to live it down to herself. Matt was right out there, and to just get intimidated out of saying anything would be just accepting the way things were. Her, alone, the only girl at this table without a boyfriend.<br />
<br />
So Kelly headed out, ignoring the whispers and laughter from Tracey.<br />
<br />
Matt stopped in his run and paused when he saw her run up to him, &quot;Ohh, hey Kelly, didn&#39;t expect to see you around. How&#39;s things?&quot; He didn&#39;t even seem to find any difficulty talking to people dressed as he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I uh...&quot; Kelly was stumbling around with her words even as she tried to say something to him. Even dressed as he was, she could not stop herself from checking him out. His skin was just so perfectly tanned, his hair was almost bright in its shade, and his muscles in such revealing clothes were overwhelming and enhanced his stature.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kelly?&quot; He seemed a little concerned now, &quot;Something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like you, okay!&quot; She blurted out, and after a moment of looking down, she looked back up at Matt, &quot;I...ever since I saw you, I really...really liked you. And that time in the library was really sweet. And I want to...to...go out. With...with you.&quot; She was worried she spoke so fast Matt couldn&#39;t understand her speech. But he put a hand on her own at her side for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;You...you do?&quot; He seemed to be at least a little surprised by this, and then smiled, &quot;Aww Kells, I&#39;d love to go out with you! Where to? I mean, I am so incredibly open to date options. Wherever you&#39;re comfortable!&quot; He meant it - she could tell from his tone.<br />
<br />
Kelly felt a downpour of emotions as she stood there. Confusion. Delight. Pure joy. She had a million questions she wanted to ask. But she decided the first one had to do with his pics, his look, and all this. &quot;I uh...I was told you were...that you were gay...&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt smiled and simply nodded, &quot;Oh, you heard absolutely right. I&#39;m like, super gay. Boyfriends for days. You probably saw my Pride photos. Met some amazing hotties there.&quot;<br />
<br />
And now Kelly was right back at confused. But...if he was--- Why would he even---? &quot;Then why are you going out with me if you&#39;re...&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt eased up toward her, and tilted his head to the side, &quot;Because, Kelly, you&#39;re one of my exceptions. Y&#39;know how some guys say there&#39;s one guy they&#39;d go gay for? You&#39;re the girl I&#39;d go straight for. So if you&#39;re up for it, I&#39;m good to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t even take a moment, &quot;I-I&#39;ll do it. I mean, I want to---yes! Yes!&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt took out his phone from a small workout bag he hoisted around, and helped her get his number down, &quot;Now, I gotta finish my run and get back home. Thanks for the chat...girlfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kelly blushed and waved at him as he went off. Football guys...she sighed and went back inside, relaying the news and saying she was gonna head home. Tracey needless to say was confused, while Brittany was elated if slightly in the same boat as Tracey. She had heard of the occasional case like that, but she just hoped it ended well for Kelly.<br />
<br />
As Kelly went home, she felt taller, stronger, more toned the whole way home - such that when she took off the jacket and put it by her younger brother&#39;s room, she felt like she could assert herself so much more. So what if Matt wasn&#39;t what Tracey and the others might think was &quot;boyfriend material&quot;. She had gotten a good answer out of him, and the newly empowered and strengthened Tracey was going to pursue this.<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
As Kelly prepared for her date, her younger brother, a dorky and awkward, tall middle schooler named Dale looked outside from his room. He and Kelly had a pretty good brother sister relationship, and he felt he could confide in her. Better than what some others had with their younger siblings. &quot;Hey Kelly, is...uh, that yours? It&#39;s right by my room...&quot;<br />
<br />
She figured if Dale wanted to wear it and try to look more the jock less the nerd, she could support him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but you can try it on if you want, little bro.&quot; She said as she got ready for the date, arranging a time and place with Matt.<br />
<br />
Dale picked up the jacket and put it on - as it was usually pretty cold around the house, and immediately started to feel warm from it. Honestly, kind of tingly too. He wondered if the material had any special fibers or construction to it...</p>
