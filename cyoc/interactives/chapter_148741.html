<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John took the hotel’s provided towel off the rack and dried his body off, at least as best he could with all the hair on his body. He hung the towel back up when he was done and reached his arms straight up, taking a big stretch to relieve tension he still had built up. He swung his arms to his sides in a big arc, letting them come down to his sides before relaxing them. Shrugging his shoulders a couple times, John started moving back to the main room of the hotel. He couldn’t shake this tense feeling, no matter how hard he tried. The shower certainly did help, but it felt as though something was lingering.<br />
<br />
His resolve though wouldn’t allow him to sit and stew in it and try to figure it out. He approached the bed, and saw his clothing all over the floor. John reprimanded himself over throwing his dirty clothing on the floor. He knew he was on vacation and didn’t have a hamper, but that was no cause to act like a slob! He reached over and scooped up his clothing in his arms and placed it on the bed. Still, getting dressed in dirty clothes was definitely not something he wanted to do, so he opened up the suitcase again.<br />
<br />
This was the first time that John had truly opened the suitcase, other than to fish around for clothing while he was at the airport, but opening the suitcase didn’t feel like it as he took a look through the belongings inside. There really wasn’t anything exciting inside of the case, just clothing similar to what he was wearing before, a toiletry bag, a couple of books.. John pondered over the clothing for a minute or so, trying to figure out what to wear. He couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off, but he had no idea for the life of him what it was.<br />
<br />
After a minute of indecision, he just decided “fuck it” and grabbed a random assortment of items from the suitcase. He pulled a white jockstrap out of the suitcase and lifted one leg to start putting it on, and quickly pulled it up his legs, the cup nicely cupping his member. It felt tighter than the other one did, which was a bit strange. He started to pull out a pair of shorts from the suitcase, but as he leaned into the suitcase caught a glance of himself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
John’s eyes went right to his groin, which was accentuating his penis through the cup of the jockstrap. But he wasn’t looking right at that, because he could see his fuzzy ass hanging out of the jockstrap’s back. It looked perfectly round and hairy in the reflection, and John started to pose so he could get a better look. He gave his ass a firm slap, feeling an erection grow firm as the noise resonated and he felt the contact and the jiggling of his globular behind.<br />
<br />
He snapped back to reality for a moment. This wasn’t right. No matter how amazing his ass looked in that sexy jockstrap, John knew he had to.. do something. Why was his brain so foggy? He chalked it down to being tired from travelling, and now it had him all horny. He couldn’t blame himself for being turned on from his body though. Trying to get his head back on straight, he grabbed a pair of shorts from the suitcase and put them on, then another stringer and a pair of socks.<br />
<br />
Getting dressed in a hurry, John didn’t realize that the clothing felt very tight on him until he started walking around the room. His shorts and shirt felt very constricting on him. He looked back over in the mirror, getting a good look at his reflection. The clothing looked tight on him too. It accentuated his body, which was slightly muscular and very hairy. He flexed his chest by popping his arms in front of him, and saw the word GYM on the stringer push out a little bit, but also felt the fabric push back on him. He smirked in the mirror, at least he could do that, but it really wasn’t a good idea to destroy the clothing.<br />
<br />
John cursed himself for bringing too tight clothing with him on this trip, this surely wouldn’t do. He stood by the door of his hotel room and started to put on one of his shoes, but was met with quite a lot of resistance. He cursed, he swore these shoes fit earlier, but they were clearly too small now. He managed to shove his feet into the too small shoes, and walked over to the shorts he was wearing before and fished out the wallet. He needed new clothes at any cost, this simply wouldn’t do. John grabbed his key card and his phone and started heading out, now with a clear goal in mind.</p>
