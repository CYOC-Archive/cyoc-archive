<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You had become an anthro hyena girl, and a damn hot one at that. Your breasts were DD cups and your ass was large and round. Your uniform consisted of a lush green top that covered your ample sized breasts, but it was really revealing and short so the bottom portion of your breasts were visible for all to see. The revealing top also left open hole for your head, but that hole also large enough to reveal almost all of your cleavage, and it felt as if the only areas of your breasts that were covered were the sides and fronts of them, and you weren’t wearing a bra or panties.<br />
<br />
Your bottom was covered by a small skirt around your waist and nothing more, so if you were to bend over everyone would see your glorious ass and is they’re lucky, your cunt. There was nothing else except for the orange tag on your right ear that signified your commitment to the zoo, but you had nothing else as far as clothing went.<br />
<br />
You realized this all the while being stared at by the patrons in front of you. As the patrons grinned at you one, who was a bear said,&quot;Hey waitress gal, you look nice. Those knockers you have there really liven up the mood.&quot; You couldn’t help but to just smile at the patron as you felt the need to serve with a bright smile. Another one of the patrons, who was a coyote added,&quot;Yeah, you ever get guys who ask for milk because of the jugs you’re carrying?&quot;<br />
<br />
You suddenly paused once hearing this patron&#39;s joke about your breasts, and your smile slowly grew brighter as oddly as it was. You felt a very strong urge to giggle and you tried to hold it back, but you eventually gave into your the urges and you took a deep breath and let it all out. &quot;Ah...HAHAHAHAHA!&quot; You paused to calm down and catch your breath then you looked to the patron and said,&quot;Oh good one! Also thanks for the compliment on my girls, heh. You boys are fantastically humerus.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another patron, who was a tiger paused grinning then smiled and said,&quot;Like the bone?&quot; You then realized that you unintentionally made a bad pun, a very bad pun but you still broke into a spree of laughter that put tears in your eyes. &quot;Y....you guys.... Hahaha! I’m just a bartender....hehehehe, you don’t need to go picking on my words.&quot; You laughed trying to stop but then the final patron, a lion, slapped you on the ass and said,&quot;See you later then sweet cheeks.&quot;<br />
<br />
You then laughed harder now, almost like a lunatic, and laughed,&quot;Ha! Cheeks like....pfft asscheeks! HAHAHAHA!&quot; You walked away laughed wagging your tail and barely able to contain yourself from coming up with even more jokes. You didn’t know what it was, but now you even found the simplest jokes absolutely hilarious and pranks were absolutely priceless even if you were the victim of one.  <br />
<br />
You walked off into a restroom and you sat down in a stall and thought to myself about how hilarious those guys were. You then sighed and took off your top and skirt to see yourself nude. You looked at your breasts and you played with them using many different means. You flicked your nipples, squished your boobs together, and you even held one nipple to your mouth and licked it as if you were able to suckle it as a newborn pup. You laughed of course thinking to yourself,&quot;Oh this is priceless! Having boobs is great! They’re so squishy, soft and sensitive. They’re just so funny!&quot; You then sighed and used the bathroom as it should by taking a shit and snickering each time you let out a fart before you put your uniform back on.<br />
<br />
You walked over to the sink and washed your paws off then stepped outside and got back to your position at the bar still with a bright smile on your face. The patrons from before still sat there and they each smiled at you as you came out. &quot;Hi there again, so what’s your name miss?&quot; The wolf asked and you paused then smiled at him and said,&quot;Just call me Joy, because I’m so full of it that I can hardly contain it Haha!&quot;<br />
<br />
The wolf nodded and he looked to his friends and grinned back at you. &quot;You know, me and the guys will give you an extra tip if you show and let each of us play with your breasts.&quot; You paused then said,&quot;Oh that would be funny, and then you&#39;d get thrown out which is even funnier!&quot; You then paused and snickered,&quot;If you want some boobs then grow&#39;em, oh wait, you can’t! HAHAHAHAHA!&quot;<br />
<br />
The other patrons paused and looked to the wolf, who just shrugged. The lion then smiled at you and said,&quot;Well we wouldn’t want that now would we? But how about I tell you about someone else? He&#39;s funny like you, very funny, and I bet he&#39;d be interested with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused and looked at the lion and said,&quot;I&#39;m listening, who is this funny guy?&quot; The lion chuckled and said,&quot;You’ll see him, he&#39;s a hyena like you in fact. Laughs all the time, and I’m sure if he met you then you&#39;d both laugh at each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is he a clown?&quot; You asked and the lion paused for a moment and blinked at you then you broke down laughing again and said,&quot;Just kidding Hahaha! You should’ve seen your face! But he sounds great, where do I meet him?&quot; The lion paused then he shrugged and said,&quot;Well you’re certainly a colorful character so I&#39;ll let you know, but knowing him he’s probably doing a stand-up comedy act right now. Happens close to dusk in the same exhibit you’re going to at dusk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So he is a clown! That’s hilarious!&quot; You said then began laughing up a storm while the whole bar just stared at you with mixed reactions. &quot;Yeah, he&#39;s uh.....interesting at times. But still nice cans, I&#39;d like to see them outside of the uniform when you’re out casually sometime.&quot; The coyote said then the wolf nodded and howled,&quot;Ooooooooh Yeah! Those things are rocking my world right now!&quot;<br />
<br />
The tiger then paused and smiled,&quot;I prefer feline babes myself, but that ass of yours is nice.&quot; The lion nodded too and added,&quot;Yeah, your just what this place needed. Who knows, maybe you’ll start a whole new life here, maybe even have a family?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;New....life...?&quot; You asked then paused,&quot;That’s hilarious! HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!&quot; You laughed harder than you ever did before now and you couldn’t breathe for a few moments as you cried with absolute joy. You eventually stopped and caught your breath again then said,&quot;Silly, I always dreamed for this, so I’m not going anywhere. Also what do you mean by new life? I&#39;ve been like this for as long as I can recall....well except one time....&quot; You paused as you saw one last memory of who you were, but to you it was just a random human boy that you didn’t know. You knew what he looked like but nothing more, and the thought of him made you laugh,&quot;Haha! Sorry, what were we talking about gentlemen?&quot;<br />
<br />
The patrons all looked to each other and the lion shook his head and said,&quot;Nothing, just the bills for the drinks please.&quot; You nodded and said,&quot;Of course!&quot; You walked over to a register then handed each of them their bills and they smiled and after a while they paid and left all of which smiling happily.<br />
<br />
You then cleaned off the area where they were while tending to your other patrons and you saw that each of them left you a large tip, and they all had something extra on their receipts. The wolf wrote on his,&quot;Hope you&#39;ll let me feel next time,&quot; there was a drawing of your breasts right next to the message which made you laugh. The tiger wrote,&quot;I&#39;ll be the smacking your ass next time.&quot; The lion&#39;s made you laugh as it was a badly drawn picture of a tiger with the words,&quot;He wishes, call me if he tries,&quot; then there was a phone number next to it. Then finally the coyote wrote,&quot;You&#39;re funny and nice, so the hyena den is in the savannah section, just follow the sounds of laughing. ;)&quot; <br />
<br />
You read all of them and you had a good laugh and though,&quot;Oh my, they were certainly satisfied. I hope this &quot;other&quot; funny guy likes me. But for now I’m having fun here....but what do I do after work?&quot;<br />
<br />
You shrugged and continued working throughout the rest of the day and around 4 in the afternoon you closed up and took off your uniform and walked outside of the gift shop nude. You saw all the other animals outside and either nude or wearing clothes, they didn’t care, but you loved the way you teased patrons by wearing your skimpy uniform in the shop. So what did you do now?</p>
