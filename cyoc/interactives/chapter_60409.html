<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan lay there absorbing Vinnie's spunk, and feeling it harden and get crusty in his mesh body.  He wanted to <br />
cry, he wanted to scream, he wanted to pound Vinnie into a bloody pulp. He thought that was what he wanted.  <br />
That was until he felt Vinnie's cock go limp, and felt an emptiness inside him.  He felt a bit ill, did he <br />
really wish that Vinnie was hard again, did he really want to spend the rest of his existence as some nerdy <br />
wimp's cum rag? The no he shouted to himself didn't seem sincere enough, and that scared him even more.<br />
<br />
An hour later, Vinnie rolled over and stretched, and he looked down at his cum stained jockstrap. Then he sat <br />
up abruptly, and said, &quot;Oh shit, Ryan, I forgot you were down there!&quot;<br />
<br />
Vinnie peeled off his soiled jockstrap, and carried it to the bathroom. He filled the sink with warm water and <br />
Woolite and began to gently scrub his jockstrap clean.  The birthday medallion lay on his chest as he scrubbed <br />
and rinsed Ryan, and hung him from the pull out clothesline over the shower.  Still naked,  Vinnie turned on <br />
the shower and climbed in.  Ryan was furious.<br />
<br />
He felt emptier than he had in his entire life.  Like it or not, he had a purpose.  Much as he was loathe to <br />
admit it, that purpose was to be Vinnie's athletic supporter.  It's fundamentally what he was supposed to b <br />
doing.  Now that he was up in the air with no manhood inside, he felt totally worthless.  He begged in his <br />
mind for Vinnie to put him back on.<br />
<br />
Vinnie stood with the shower blasting his shoulders and facing Ryan. He looked up and said to Ryan, while he <br />
lathered up his chest, &quot;I wish I could change you back into a human, Ryan, but not like you were.  If I could <br />
change you back you would be twice the wimp you think I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Twice the wimp?&quot; whined Ryan as he became a naked 4 ft 90lb version of his former self, &quot;Now what have you <br />
done to me, Cost?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vinnie blinked and stepped backward jamming the metal shower controller into his back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, Ryan, hee, hee, it looks like you're pre-pubescent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It may look like that, Vinnie, but I am still 18. Look what you've done, do you think Stacy will go to the <br />
prom with me now?  I want to go to the prom with the most popular person in the school, and that would be <br />
Stacy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I think I can arrange for you to go to the prom with the most popular person at this school...&quot; Vinnie <br />
grinned. <br />
<br />
 He was thinking he was figuring out how to use his magic.  First, he had to be naked, except for his <br />
medallion.  Second, he had to touch it with his body -skin to skin contact- to make his wishes come true.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, Vinnie, I won't hurt you. Just change me back,&quot; Ryan pleaded.<br />
<br />
Vinnie just fingered his medallion and smiled.<br />
<br />
Ryan stared upward as Vinnie started to grow bigger.  He didn't until he 6'4&quot; of pure muscle.  Ryan just <br />
gawked with his mouth hanging open. He gasped, &quot;No way!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, way, little dude. Everyone at school will remember you as the wimpy geek, and me as the football star <br />
who led our school to victory.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I did that!  I'm the popular jock!  You're the nerd!&quot; Ryan shouted feebly clenching his fists and <br />
pounding Vinnie's smooth wet chest.  He sobbed, &quot;I don't want to be a geek!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, that's right I promised you that you could go with the most popular person in the school. Now that would <br />
be me,&quot; Vinnie said thumbing his chest.<br />
<br />
Ryan stopped pressing against Vinnie's naked body and lightly hitting him.  He stepped back with his eyes wide <br />
open, and said defiantly, &quot;I'm not gay!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither am I,&quot; retorted Vinnie with a snort.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, then what's all that about taking you to the prom?&quot; Ryan asked in his new high pitched voice. Then he <br />
felt a twinge in his manhood, it seemed like something was crushing it - forcing it back into his body.  Then <br />
his nipples became erect, and his pectoral muscles seemed to inflate. &quot;Boob?&quot; he gasped, &quot;No,&quot; he said as he <br />
voice went up an octave, and then another octave, he said, &quot;You can't, Vinnie. I'm a guy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not anymore Ryleen.  Your the hottest girl in school. You're the star cheerleader, and top of girls' dean's <br />
list. Which makes poor Stacy, number 3 after me and you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, I think I made you too hot, Rylene.  Heh, heh, I can't wait to see what your room looks like now.  You <br />
were born a girl, so I doubt it's painted blue and filled with football trophies,&quot; Vinnie said, &quot;You're my <br />
female fantasy.  I should be your male fantasy,&quot; he added licking his lips and fingering the medallion.<br />
<br />
Ryan was struggling against it, but his mind instantly thought of some attributes that would improve Vinnie's <br />
appearance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, I'm growing body hair like nobody's business!&quot; Vinnie remarked, &quot;And my cock's growing a foreskin and <br />
growing bigger? And you said you weren't gay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not you hot Neanderthal, but now you're the dumb jock.  So dumb in fact, you don't know how you did this <br />
magic-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But wait, I'm Valedict-uh-tator?  No, that's not right?&quot; Vinnie looked confused and began to scratch his head <br />
trying to remember that big word for smartest guy in school.<br />
<br />
Rylene laughed.  It was a mean lilting laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now give me that golden necklace, Vin.  Put it around my neck, and I'll see what damage I can do,&quot; Rylene <br />
said to Vin.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing, Rylene.  Guys shouldn't wear jewelry anyway.  It's so gay.  I wouldn't uh done it if it hadn't <br />
been a gift from grandmama,&quot; he explained as he lifted it off his head, and lowered it over Rylene's head.</p>
