<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the car sped away from the manor they saw a figure closing in on them.<br />
<br />
“You’re fucking kidding! She’s still after us?!” Setepenre said.<br />
<br />
Before the others could react the  kitsune jumped in front of the vehicle and when the two collided, the car was the one sent flying, it crashed into a lamp post without even a scratch. Then Hinata found herself dodging two missiles before deflecting machine gun fire with her sword. She rushed over to the car and grabbed the black girl who was operating the guns. She was surprised when Setepenre grabbed onto Hinata’s arm, black wrappings appeared from the black girl’s arms and wrapped themselves around the kitsune. With a flash from her sword, Hinata blocked a sneak attack from the werewolf, Luca and Setepenre were shocked that the fox girl could move so quickly and had anticipated their attacks.<br />
Hinata sent Luca flying, showing how deceptively strong she was, then the kitsune summoned her foxfire forcing Setepenre to release her enemy. Once she was free, Hinata jumped back and just narrowly avoided a sudden attack from Bong-cha, who had drawn the sword she received from Choon Hee.<br />
<br />
“What’s with the uniform? Did you get separated from your field trip?!” The red haired girl hissed.<br />
<br />
Hinata and Bong-cha engaged in a sword fight that was quickly ended when the kitsune caught the vampire’s sword and shattered it with bare hands. Bong-cha jumped back and the other girl could see her red vampiric eyes show themselves.<br />
<br />
“It seems you three are the ones who got separated. Why don’t you come back to the Normal with me and I won’t have to kill you.” Hinata offered.<br />
<br />
“That’s not going to happen!” Luca howled and rushed the pigtailed fox girl.<br />
<br />
He had completely transformed into his werewolf form and towered over the young swordswoman. She deflected his brutal claws and found herself stuck by more of Setepenre’s phantom wraps, giving the werewolf a chance to savagely slash their attacker and send her flying into the car.<br />
Hinata’s uniform was ripped up and she was bleeding. Using a simple healing technique she managed to stop the bleeding and turned to the three, her aura burned and she held her sword in preparation for a special technique.<br />
<br />
“300 degree phoenix slash!” She shouted and a blazing crescent slash flew towards them at great speeds.<br />
<br />
Luca and the others couldn’t react in time but were relieved when a wall of tombstones just barely blocked the attack.<br />
<br />
“That sword is fucking silver you mutt! You and Bong-cha would be more careful!” Jolie yelled. <br />
<br />
They turned to see the white haired girl holding out her arcane carved arms at the gravestone barrier. More kitsune flames engulfed the area forcing the other three back. <br />
<br />
“Get back guys.” Setepenre said as a dark cloud encircled the mummy.<br />
<br />
Her colored box braids returned to their natural black and grew much longer, the skin around her face and arms seemed to unravel like silk wrappings, revealing the flesh underneath. The girl’s eyes and teeth became black and sand kicked up beneath her, forming into sand cobras.<br />
Setepenre spoke something on a long dead language and Hinata turned to look. While the kitsune was distracted Jolie crossed her arms like a corpse and fell backwards into a green mist, then with the same mist she arose next to Bong-cha and Luca.<br />
<br />
Hinata sensed this increase in threat and her foxfire grew and circled her. Hinata now had sharp teeth and claws, Moon Slayer glowed brighter as well.<br />
<br />
“You three were always more trouble than you were worth, when the Boss is done with you, you’ll wish you never left. If I don’t kill you myself.” The Normal agent growled.<br />
<br />
The sand began spinning faster and collided with the foxfire, Setepenre and Hinata ran at each other with the mummy barely dodging the kitsune’s sword. The two engaged with Hinata dealing out aggressive slashes and fire attacks with Setepenre barely using her shadow wraps to parry them along with the sand snakes to keep her opponent on the move. With a spin Hinata used a fire spell to disperse the sand tornado, unintentionally allowing Abolith to strike but was blocked by the fox girl’s foot and with a spin she sent both attackers back, using her fire to force the mummy to retreat and focused once more on the assassin. <br />
<br />
“I’ve never seen a kitsune fight in their human form before.” The elf taunted.<br />
<br />
“Be quiet.” Hinata said launching an arc of fire at the assassin.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Bong-Cha was helping Luca flip their car back over.<br />
<br />
“Can’t you just age her to a baby or something?!” The Asian girl asked.<br />
<br />
“No, the battle is too chaotic, plus I don’t think she knows I have rings of age, if she finds out she’ll try to take them for the Normal. That’s something I cannot allow to happen.” Misery replied.<br />
<br />
“We have to find some way to—“ Luca was cut off by Hinata who had impaled him with her sword.<br />
<br />
Bong-Cha’s eyes went wide and she lunged at the other girl with a vicious cry. Hinata was faster though and spun back and slashed before the vampire could strike, separating Bong-Cha’s right arm and leg from her body. She fell back clutching her shoulder as she bled out on the car. Misery launched a burst of raw magic at her but again she managed to evade her attack. Misery looked for the others who had been fighting Hinata but went pale when she saw Setepenre on the ground with severe burns and Abolith was nowhere to be seen. <br />
Before the kitsune could attack a mass of dark energy erupted between them.<br />
<br />
“You attack my friends and defend the wicked! That is unforgivable! In the name of the stars I’ll punish you!” A voice called out. <br />
<br />
They all turned to see Lilith in her Solar Guardian form, her Pluto staff in hand.<br />
<br />
“Are you one of their friends as well?” Hinata asked and Lilith wished she didn’t.<br />
<br />
“I am the pretty protector of the solar<br />
system! I fight for love and justice! My name is Guardian Pluto!” Lilith announced with a pose.<br />
<br />
The tension was cut when Bong-Cha couldn’t help but laugh at the magical girl’s flashy entrance. Hinata was less than amused and launched flames at the magical girl.<br />
Guardian Pluto spun her staff to disapate the attack and stomped her foot furiously.<br />
<br />
“S-seriously?! You’re literally in pieces right now and you’re laughing?!” She yelled.<br />
<br />
“Ughh…s-sorry…I-I…..” Bong-Cha slowly lost consciousness and Misery did her best to stop the bleeding.<br />
<br />
The kitsune raged with foxfire and prepared to strike but suddenly stopped then put her hand to her ear.<br />
<br />
“B-but Sir—yes sir. It’s your lucky day kids, next time you won’t be so lucky.” Hinata said and vanished.<br />
<br />
“W-we have to do something! Luca’s dead and Bong-cha and Set are not much better!” Misery cried.<br />
<br />
“Beautiful dark forces, I call to you! As the pretty guardian Pluto I invoke the power of death and pull my friends back from the void!” Lilith shouted and kissed Bong-cha, Luca and Setepenre.<br />
<br />
Each of them had their injuries healed and once again drew breath.<br />
<br />
“That was amazing! You retrieved their souls from the beyond so perfectly and easily! And that dress!” Jolie gushed.<br />
<br />
“Yea, it’s one of my abilities but unfortunately it only works for those in close with.” The magical girl said powering down.<br />
<br />
“Thanks dudett, that stab wouldn’t have been that bad but the silver poisoning would a finished me!” Luca howled grabbing the girl in a hug.<br />
<br />
“W-whatever, don’t mention it.” Lilith said blushing.<br />
<br />
“Let us be off then, that kit was stronger than I expected.” Abolith said, surprising everyone.<br />
<br />
“Thanks for totally bailing on us.” The vampire said.<br />
<br />
“I couldn’t fight her with you getting in the way, besides that magical girl’s ability wouldn’t have worked on a stranger like me so why risk my life for your sake.” The red haired assassin replied.<br />
<br />
“Let’s just get back to Circe’s park, I could use a nice long bath.” Misery said.<br />
<br />
The group all got back in the car and made their way back to the park, weary from the skirmish.</p>
