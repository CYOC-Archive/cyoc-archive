<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Amber walked into the strange top secret government laboratory feeling a mixture of fear and excitement. <br />
<br />
Sure, Amber loved the Dragon Amazon Brigade, or the DAB as it was more commonly known.  She admired their bodies, designed to be the perfect killing machine, combining the raw power and near invulnerability of a dragon with the tactical skills and ingenuity of a human.  And, of course, she loved fighting.  That was why she joined the armed forces several years ago.  <br />
<br />
But as the DAB proved more and more successful in field operations, human soldiers were slowly being phased out of combat.  They were just so inefficient compared to the DAB.  It didn&#39;t make sense to needlessly risk the lives of human soldiers when the DAB could easily handle the same missions. So, Amber had a choice.  Join the DAB or sit behind a desk for the rest of her military career.  For Amber, it was an easy decision.  She applied to join the DAB at her first opportunity.<br />
<br />
Well, applied wasn&#39;t exactly the right word.  Amber was actively recruited.  She was at the top of her class in the classroom as well as in her combat training.  Female soldiers were still a precious commodity in the military, despite changes in society.  And since only women could become members of the DAB, quality recruits like Amber were a rare find, aggressively sought out by military intelligence. <br />
<br />
Equally problematic was the fact that most women simply did not want to join the DAB.  The process was irreversible, and joining the squad essentially meant consenting to give up your humanity for the rest of your life.  But it didn&#39;t take much convincing for Amber.  She thought the DAB soldiers were beautiful, the perfect mixture of power and beauty.  And she didn&#39;t care much for human society.  If she was forced to sit around with other women and gossip, discussing fashion, celebrities or children, she would probably go crazy from boredom and just kill herself.  No, she needed real excitement. She wanted to explore the world, visit strange places, and have amazing adventures.  And to fight, of course. She loved to fight.  Nothing got her heart racing like a good scruff.  And the adrenaline rush she got from a good fight was better than any drug to her.  So, the thought of getting stronger and having more challenging fights was enticing to her. Amber was looking forward to becoming one of the DAB.<br />
<br />
Still, Amber did have some reservations.  The procedure was highly classified, known only to the military staff with the highest clearance.  But that didn&#39;t stop some rumors from filtering down to the other low ranking soldiers.  Amber had heard that the procedure was painful, dangerous even.  She had heard more than once that it had been fatal to some volunteers.  Her military liaison had assured Amber it was safe when she was given the many, many forms required for consent.  But although Amber was loyal, she didn&#39;t always trust her superiors.  <br />
<br />
So, as Amber entered the large oval chamber of the lab she had mixed feelings.  She was surprised to see that the room looked empty, save for a chair and her superior,  a field officer by the name of Major Tom.  He was gruff older man, with a neatly trimmed grey mustache and the toned, fit physique of a much younger man. He stood stiffly in his perfectly cleaned and pressed uniform as she entered the room.  He looked impatient as she made her way to the center of the room. Amber felt a little guilty, like she had disappointed her father or something.  <br />
<br />
Major Tom&#39;s stern cold gaze was a stark contrast to the friendly smile of the female doctor who entered the room.  Amber was again surprised by the Doctor&#39;s appearance. She had expected a small mouse of a woman, a shy introverted nerd.  But this woman was statuesque, standing almost six feet tall, with long blonde hair tied in a bun and the thin figure of a model.  Well, perhaps she could have been a model several years ago.  Although she was still quite attractive, Amber could see that the Doctor was in her late forties.  The only feature that betrayed her identity as the Doctor - well,  aside from the long sparkling white lab-coat - was the large glasses with oversized lenses that she constantly had to keep pushing back up her face as it slid down her nose.<br />
<br />
Amber felt a little intimidated by the beauty of the doctor. She knew she was not ugly - her rigid training had given her a toned, maybe slightly muscular physique.  She wasn&#39;t short, standing at around 5&#39;4&quot;, but she had always felt a little inferior to taller people.  She had been told that her hair was beautiful, but she kept her bright fiery red hair cut short in a buzz cut, to avoid problems in combat.  A few freckles spotted her face, betraying her one weakness - the sun.  Her pale skin burned easily in the harsh sunlight, not that she ever complained or let it become a problem.  Overall, she thought that was cute.  But she would never turn heads like the Doctor could. She felt a little apprehensive, but she had to do what she had to do.  Amber quickly removed her uniform and revealed her naked body, all its glory and imperfections exposed for all to see.<br />
<br />
Neither the Doctor nor Major Tom seemed particularly interested in her nudity.  Doubtless, they had more important things on their mind.  The Doctor motioned for Amber to have a seat in the chair, gently guiding her with one of her soft hands.  The chair was large, with equally large straps on the arm and leg rests.  Amber hesitated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, dear.  The straps are just for safety.  You have nothing to fear, I promise,&quot; said the Doctor warmly.<br />
<br />
Her sincere smile comforted Amber and she relaxed a little.  The Doctor&#39;s kind  demeanor reminded Amber of her mother and helped her feel more at ease as she sat in the chair.  But as the good Doctor tightened the straps she felt he fear rise again.<br />
<br />
The Doctor scribbled some notes on her large pad as she and Major Tom backed away.  The door to the lab opened and a male lab tech in a short white coat entered, carrying an metal tray with a large syringe.  Amber looked around the room frantically.  It seemed to be some kind of metal cylinder, with a large glass window curving around one side of the room.  She saw a few more lab techs behind the window.  But she still didn&#39;t see any type of machine or anything. How was this going to work?  The Doctor explained, trying to ease Amber&#39;s fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, Amber is it?&quot; asked the Doctor.<br />
<br />
Amber nodded nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, she will be DAB 23X9,&quot; said Major Tom. <br />
<br />
The Doctor ignored Major Tom and continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amber, like I said, you have nothing to fear.  We are going to inject you with several different types of retroviruses.  Some will add new dragon genes to your genome, while others will inactivate some human genes that you will no longer need or might interfere and conflict with your new genes.  Do you have any questions?&quot; asked the Doctor.<br />
<br />
Amber shook her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you consent to the procedure?&quot; asked the Doctor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doc, we have been over this several times.  She has signed all the paperwork.  She knows what she is doing.  Can we just get this started?&quot; said Major Tom impatiently.<br />
<br />
The Doctor gave him a cross look.  &quot;I want to hear her say it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Doctor gave Amber a sympathetic look.  &quot;Listen, it&#39;s not too late to back out.  If you don&#39;t want to do this, we can stop right now.  But once we begin the process, there is no going back.  Are you sure you want to do this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amber nodded.  &quot;Yeah, Doc.  I have thought this over and I do want it.  I really do.  I have always admired the DAB.  I think they are really cool. I have longed to join them on their adventures for quite some time. I know the fighting will be tough and I am prepared for that.  But I also think it will be a lot of fun running around the globe fighting bad guys. Please Doc - let me join the DAB.  I am ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Doctor smiled warmly and patted her hand.  &quot;It is fun.  And you won&#39;t be disappointed, trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Doctor nodded to the tech beside Amber and she felt a large needle pierce her arm.</p>
