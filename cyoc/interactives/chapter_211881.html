<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;How about a rabbit?&quot; Jeff suggests. &quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong, Sally, I love dogs, you&#39;re my best pet I could ever ask for, but rabbits were always my favorite animal growing up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why rabbits?&quot; Sally questions.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I could explain it better but... first off, they&#39;re so different from us. They&#39;re really small, and yet so mobile. I mean, they&#39;re known for jumping. Oh, and they&#39;re really adorable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I never thought I&#39;d hear you call something adorable,&quot; Sally giggles.<br />
<br />
Jeff shrugs. &quot;Well, in a few minutes, you&#39;ll be my owner, at least until we turn back. And you&#39;ve always been my best friend. I just... I trust you, Sally.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally blushes. &quot;Thanks, Jeff. I promise to take really good care of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the other reason. You&#39;re new to being human, so I didn&#39;t want to put a burden on you. Bunnies are quiet, easy to train, and clean. I&#39;ll be really low maintenance, and yet so small I can be your little fur baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you put a lot of thought into this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t think me wanting to be a rabbit is dumb, do you?&quot; Jeff asks, embarrassed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why would I think that? I&#39;ve met rabbits before at the dog park and they were so nice and friendly. And you gave a bunch of great logical reasons too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if my family finds out?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally cups Jeff&#39;s cheek. &quot;It&#39;s okay, Jeff. How about we use the Reality Alteration feature then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Reality Alteration?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally guides Jeff to the computer. &quot;See that option right there? If we use it, then the whole world besides us will think you were always a rabbit. Nobody will judge you for anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if that makes it so my parents never had me, and the Chronivac is lost forever?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll just make it so that I was your twin sister first before we change you. That way, I slot perfectly into your place in the family.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff doesn&#39;t seem convinced, but nods anyway. &quot;I&#39;d love having you as a sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally hugs Jeff. &quot;And I&#39;ll love you no matter what.&quot;<br />
<br />
The now-human girl hits a few buttons on the computer. Jeff barely notices a thing. &quot;Done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, I&#39;m not officially your twin. Cool, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But things don&#39;t feel any different.&quot;<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when a second set of memories flood Jeff&#39;s mind... memories of him and Sally growing up together. And the room, which previously supported only a single bed, now has two.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? The wall between my room and dad&#39;s office is gone!&quot; Jeff notices.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about now, little bro?&quot; Sally teases.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you were only born five minutes before me!&quot; Jeff complains, before realizing the implications.<br />
<br />
&quot;See? And the rest of the world only remembers things according to our new memories.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, this thing is insane.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, let&#39;s go over some basic details,&quot; Sally suggests. &quot;What type of rabbit? As in, breed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Netherlands Dwarf, with white fur please,&quot; Jeff requests.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about sex?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sex?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Boy or girl, male or female,&quot; Sally clarifies. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, I understood that. But why are you asking?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. Being female is something different. I know how much you struggle with looking for mates as a human, so maybe it would be easier if you were the one being pursued. And if you were worried about being seen as adorable as a guy, then we can ease that fear by making you a gal. It&#39;s also something super different than you&#39;re used to. And lastly, if I have to take care of you, I&#39;d be more comfortable if it was just us girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I make you uncomfortable?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Sally insists. &quot;That was a poor choice of words. I just think you&#39;d enjoy it better. Besides, this is all about perspective, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff gulps. &quot;Again, I trust you, Sally. If you think it is for the best, go for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally fiddles with the settings a bit more. &quot;There, female and heterosexual. I can&#39;t believe in a just a few clicks, our roles will be reversed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t make it sound so nostalgic. You know as well as I do that we&#39;re swapping back right when the family pulls in the driveway, which could be hours from now but could also be any minute. I&#39;ll barely have time to break in my white coat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, of course, swapping back as soon as they get home. That&#39;s the deal, right? Now, let me go ahead and enter the settings...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff had to admit there was still something spooky about watching his former pet using his computer. It was even freakier to realize he was letting her use his own new software and accessories to change his species. She didn&#39;t even have her nudity left to remind a casual observer that she had ever been a pet. On some level, it was really starting to sink in that he was effectively being replaced. In a way, though, so was she.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Jeff? You might wanna get out of those clothes of yours. Technically, they&#39;re my clothes now, and I don&#39;t think I want a fully dressed rabbit, even if it is just for a few minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her request takes Jeff off guard. Sure, he&#39;d been naked in front of Sally before, during a quick change of clothes once in a while without thinking, but that wasn&#39;t when she was human. Of course, he wasn&#39;t going to be human much longer. If he is going to be the pet, for potentially the rest of the evening, he would have to be okay with being the one who didn&#39;t wear clothes in the relationship.<br />
<br />
As Jeff strips his clothing, his face becomes more and more red. Sally, on the other hand, smiles playfully. Seeing his former dog was biting her lips, Jeff tried to cover his privates with his hands. “Hey! Stop looking at me like that! You may be a human now, but you&#39;re still a dog on the inside. Don&#39;t get any funny ideas.”<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, Jeff, I don&#39;t bite. Still, it would be interesting to see what it&#39;s like to have sex as a human, and I wouldn&#39;t trust anyone else to be my mate than my best friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know. It&#39;s just embarrassing. All of this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, all those thoughts will go away soon, I promise.&quot; Sally&#39;s eyes widen. &quot;Oh, what would you like me to call you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff?&quot; he retorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re gonna be female,&quot; Sally scolds. &quot;And don&#39;t say something like Jeffra either. I want something cute and adorable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff sighs. &quot;Jazz.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally is satisfied with the name. “Okay. Looks like we’re just about ready to begin. Shall we?”<br />
<br />
Jeff  is also a little intimidated, because he isn&#39;t sure someone who should be licking her own butt would be the choice ideal choice to take control of his anatomy and psychology. So far, Sally seemed just like a normal woman with above-average intelligence and a first-hand understanding of life as an animal. Even so, how would a dog use seemingly omnipotent technology, especially a dog whose mind and body have been warped by that same technology? If Sally got them both in trouble somehow, how we he explain that he turned his exclusive beta testing opportunity over to his dog?<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Sally how long is this gonna take?&quot; he asks, awkwardly baring it all in front of a human woman whom nature had never intended to even be a human woman, wanting to distract himself before he could talk himself out of this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why, I thought you never ask.”<br />
<br />
With a flick of a button, Jeff could feel the changes begin. It started as a tingle in his stomach, but it quickly spread.<br />
<br />
The first thing to change is his height. Standing at 5&#39;8, Jeff begins losing centimeters by the second. Jeff begins to panic slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be alright, Jazz,&quot; Sally consoles. &quot;You just picked a really small breed. Take deep breaths, and it will be over soon, and you&#39;ll be so happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Got it,&quot; Jeff agrees. <br />
<br />
As Jeff continues to shrink, his body hair quickly turns to a majestic white.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll have a beautiful coat when you&#39;re done,&quot; Sally praises. &quot;You&#39;re such a good girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
It is when she called him &quot;girl&quot; the first time that Jeff notices Sally hadn&#39;t been calling him &quot;master&quot; for a while. He hoped she wasn&#39;t getting too in to this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my gosh, Jeff! your hands! Look at your hands! They’ve starting to change!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff notices that the fur was growing on his hands as he looked down to see the changes up close for the first thing he could see was his nails getting longer and sharper, becoming points while the color of each nail brightened to white. By the time they sharpened into claws is where the fingers cracked and pulled in for they were becoming less dextile as the thumbs while it migrated all the way up to the back. As his hands shrink, they are encompassed entirely in fur. He tried to flex them, but found it to be nearly impossible. Looking down to his feet, his middle and ring does converge into a single digit. Now he couldn&#39;t type or click a mouse to save his life: it was all up to Sally now! At least she seemed to know what she was doing.<br />
<br />
Jeff decided, admittedly against his better judgment, that this was all good thing after all. He&#39;d always been curious about what being an animal feels like, and even though he might never be able to look at Sally the same way again after this, his curiosity is starting to be satisfied. He also knew that the Chronivac worked as was thrilled by the power he had now, even if he was temporarily at the mercy of his pet. It was like a horror movie, but it made him smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Careful, girl, you&#39;ll be on four legs soon enough, but for now it might be tough to keep your balance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing Sally&#39;s voice again made Jeff&#39;s ears twitch. Reaching up to feel them, he found his ears much longer. They had migrated to the top of his head entirely, and stuck up. Soon, Jeff could feel a pop as a small fluffy tail emerged right above his butt.<br />
<br />
It almost made Jeff forget he also switched genders.<br />
<br />
His nipples began to feel very sensitive, his chest puffing up slightly, and he noticed as a set of six before began appearing on his chest.<br />
 <br />
He could feel shifting in his abdomen, as things rearrange themselves to a female configuration, and could feel his dick and balls getting smaller and smaller, his penis slowly receding into him, his testicles moving from the scrotum inside the body.<br />
<br />
Jazz is officially a girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, if only my breasts were bigger, I&#39;d look like a playboy rabbit,&quot; Jazz jokes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Laugh while you can,&quot; Sally teases. &quot;Soon, you won&#39;t be able to talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
It is true, as the transformation begins to speed up. In a matter of a minute, Jazz goes from three feet to a third of that, as fur spreads across her entire body, not a single area untouched.<br />
<br />
A few more cracks in his spine and tendons makes him tumble down and have to catch his weight with his forepaws. She can feel her bones crack into place, as her facial structure changes itself. Blinking, Jazz notices two changes. Firstly, that rabbits were colorblind, only being able to see blue and green. Jazz realized he couldn&#39;t tell every color apart, he wasn&#39;t entirely colorblind. Secondly, that her vision, which was previously limited to just the front of her head, is nearly a complete 360 degrees.<br />
<br />
Her other senses come just as quickly. Her hearing improves dramatically, to the point of sensory overload, giving Jazz a migraine. The difference is truly night and day. Her sense of smell increases in much the same way.  Jazz began to sniff the air. All the smells in the room are getting stronger! There is hair, fur, wood, plastic, skin oils, rodents, insulation, clothing, carpet, snack crumbs, and--and dog urine?! Had Sally peed in here without her knowing? Bad girl! Jazz has an unmistakable compulsion to find Sally&#39;s urine and spray some of her own nearby, but she resisted. She didn&#39;t want to be a bad rabbit!<br />
<br />
The Chronivac dinged as Jazz shrunk to a final height of 5.6 inches. Her room, which once felt incredibly small, was like a mansion to her. She started to feel very scared. Sally walked over and gave Jazz&#39;s furry head a rub, carefully picking up her new pet rabbit.<br />
<br />
The physical changes mostly completed, Jazz felt a sudden headache. The same way Sally had started to develop human mannerisms, rabbit instincts were taking further root in Jazz&#39;s brain. While her human memories were still there, the rabbit instincts were in the forefront of her mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re so CUTE! We&#39;re gonna have a fun evening in our new bodies, aren&#39;t we?&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead... Jazz shakes in terror. While she felt safe in Mommy&#39;s hands, this is anything but fun to her.<br />
<br />
Sally, assuming she knew what Jazz was so scared of, tried to console her new pet. &quot;I want you to have the full experience, girl,&quot; Sally told Jazz. &quot;I promise you&#39;ll be safe with me. You&#39;re my little fur baby, remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jazz snuggles up against her &#39;Mommy,&#39; hoping to make the best of this experience... or at least, simply survive it.</p>
