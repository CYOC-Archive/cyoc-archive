<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff continued to feel pleasurable though quite unusual feelings with his detached cock, which was inside Rachel. &quot;Why are you shrinking me?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry! It&#39;s all going according to plan,&quot; Pris said. He looked to her, but she said, &quot;No, keep your eyes on Rachel.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel was still lying next to him, her eyes closed, and smiling. &quot;Is her... your... belly growing?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhh,&quot; Pris said. &quot;Let me enjoy this. Just watch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before long, it was apparent that Rachel&#39;s belly was in fact growing. Her breasts appeared to have increased at least one cup size also. She looked like she was in a late stage of pregnancy. &quot;That&#39;s... impossible?&quot; Jeff said. Her belly continued getting larger and larger. It looked like she was also getting... taller? As she grew, he realized that she was taking up more of the bed, leaving little room for him, so he stood up, and continued to stare.<br />
<br />
Rachel&#39;s belly continued to grow, beyond any plausible size for pregnancy. As he watched, he realized that she was getting taller only because her belly was getting longer, as well. Soon she was too tall fit the bed, most of which was occupied by her enormous belly. Her legs were hanging off the foot of the bed, and her upper body was curved up against the wall at the head of the bed. Her belly ws so large that it took up nearly the entire bed. Suddenly Rachel gave a cry of pain.<br />
<br />
Pris stood next to Rachel, put a hand on Rachel&#39;s belly, and said, &quot;There, there. It hurts, and will hurt even more, but it will soon be over.&quot; To Jeff, she said, &quot;Why don&#39;t you hold my hand, try to comfort me?&quot; Jeff moved toward Pris, but she said, &quot;No, silly. The _other_ me,&quot; pointing to Rachel. Jeff held one of her hands. He couldn&#39;t reach around her gigantic belly to hold her other hand. Rachel cried in pain again.<br />
<br />
Pris moved to the foot of the bed, and said, &quot;Cervix dilated to 5 cm.&quot; She started counting up as she watched her cervix dilation increase. &quot;Six... seven... eight...&quot;<br />
<br />
When the count passed fifteen, Jeff said, &quot;What&#39;s happening? Isn&#39;t that too much?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pris shushed him again, as Rachel cried out. Pris said, &quot;Just keep holding my hand, please. This is getting very painful, and it will get much worse before it gets better.&quot; She continued calling out the dilation as it continued to increase. After 22, she said, &quot;Full dilation. Push!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff saw Rachel&#39;s face contort in pain, and she squeezed his hand, hard, smiling she pushed, groaning. She relaxed again, panting. Then she pushed again, crying out, and squeezing his hand almost hard enough to cause him pain. &quot;Again,&quot; Pris said. Rachel took a deep breath, then pushed again, screaming. Up until now, Jeff had almost forgotten about his detached penis, inside Rachel. Now, as she pushed, he felt her muscles contract around his cock to the point of being painful. When she relaxed, he felt better.<br />
<br />
&quot;Push,&quot; Pris ordered. Rachel cried out, and this time the pain Jeff felt in his detached member was excruciating. He cried out too, and they squeezed each other&#39;s hands painfully as well. She relaxed, and he felt his own pain diminish somewhat, but this time it didn&#39;t go entirely away. Her muscles were still very tight around him. &quot;Push,&quot; Pris ordered again. Rachel and Jeff screamed. Jeff had never felt such pain before, and couldn&#39;t even imagine the far worse pain Rachel must feel. &quot;Push!&quot; Another burst of pain, and then... a pop? some relief? The shaft of his penis was still in pain, her muscles tight around him, but the head of his penis no longer felt pain. &quot;That&#39;s the head! Keep going!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was very confused. She had said she was shrinking his penis, yet now she was apparently delivering it, like a baby, and it must be absolutely huge, not the tiny thing he&#39;d imagined when she&#39;d said she had to shrink him. &quot;Push!&quot; he heard again, and he and Rachel both screamed again. If they squeezed each other&#39;s hands any tighter, they&#39;d start breaking bones. There was not nearly enough time to recover before Pris again yelled &quot;Push!&quot; They screamed again. Jeff thought he was going to pass out, but he felt a little more of his cock finally get pushed out of Rachel&#39;s body. &quot;That&#39;s the shoulders,&quot; said Pris, much to Jeff&#39;s relief. Wait, what, he thought? Shoulders? Am I going mad? My penis doesn&#39;t have shoulders. Why did she make it so damn big, anyhow? He&#39;d wanted a bigger cock, but this was absurd.<br />
<br />
Pris kept ordering &quot;Push!&quot; and each time Rachel pushed, they both felt excruciating pain. He saw that Pris nearly collapsed each time, and he wondered why, before remembering that she and Rachel were only one person. The pain was so much that he couldn&#39;t even think straight.<br />
<br />
It wouldn&#39;t have been as bad if every push had gotten more of his cock out of Rachel&#39;s body, but many of the pushes seemed to make no progress. Finally, after a particularly painful push, Jeff felt more of himself emerge from Rachel, and Pris said, &quot;Waist!&quot; Now I&#39;ve definitely gone mad, he thought. But I&#39;d always imagined being mad to be more pleasant than this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Push! Harder!&quot; After more of the excruciating pushes, Jeff couldn&#39;t even count how many, he felt more progress. It felt like he was nearly out of Rachel. Pris said, &quot;Nearly there! Only a few more feet to go!&quot; Feet? Surely she means inches?<br />
<br />
Rachel pushed again, and this time Jeff felt Pris&#39; hands grabbing and pulling him out of Rachel. After only two more pushes, he felt himself finally slip out of her entirely. He and Rachel each let out a huge sigh, a welcome change from the screaming they&#39;d been doing.<br />
<br />
Jeff saw that Rachel&#39;s belly was not distended anywhere near as far, now that she&#39;d finally finished pushing him out. In fact, it was shrinking as he watched. Pris motioned to him. &quot;Come look,&quot; she said. He was too exhausted to even want to see his giant cock, and he was irate that she had put him through this. He hadn&#39;t asked for a giant cock, he&#39;d asked for a duplicate. And even if he _had_ wanted a giant cock, why the hell wouldn&#39;t she have just made it grow in place, rather than putting them both through this torture?<br />
<br />
&quot;Go look,&quot; Rachel said, the first articulate words out of her mouth since her belly had started to grow.<br />
<br />
Wearily, he shuffled to the foot of the bed to see his giant cock that Pris was apparently so proud of. He nearly fainted when he saw... &quot;That&#39;s me?&quot; He saw, not the giant cock he expected, but an entire adult male body. As Pris helped the body stand, which he felt but couldn&#39;t process, he said, &quot;You gave birth to an adult me?&quot;</p>
