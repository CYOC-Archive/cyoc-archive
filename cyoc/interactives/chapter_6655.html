<br />
So read the incantation. Davis stepped back from the book for a moment. Thinking about what he had just read. &quot;oh hell, this isn’t gonna work.&quot; he mumbled. <br />
<br />
A strange sensation overtook him just then. An almost tired, groggy feeling, yet warm. His mind was racing, he couldn’t think clearly... Was this it? he normally didn’t get strange feelings just at random, so there has to be a reason he thought. Maybe he was just flustered, nervous, maybe he was imagining things, maybe it wasn’t real. he couldn’t think straight, his mind wanted to be logical about this, calm even... but he couldn’t help his own emotions.<br />
<br />
It was in this frantic state of mind where Davis noticed something, he felt like his body was expanding, his arms! <br />
<br />
Davis turned quickly to see that his bicep on his right arm was, in fact growing. It was getting bigger, a lot bigger, at a rapid pace. The sleeves of his shirt were now touching his growing biceps, on both his arms. Davis lifted his  right and left arms half way up to see his biceps expanding out, larger and larger, with each passing second they were getting bigger. His sleeves were going to become too small to hold those arms of his. It was surreal, everything was surreal, and Davis was in a total state of shock. Watching it all happen in front of him.<br />
<br />
It felt like his whole body was moving away from him. As if he was involuntarily making it flex all over, though it looked as if he was just inhaling air, making his chest larger, he wasn’t, and his shirt was becoming more and more awkward on his increasing frame. Two large pecs began to show through the fabric of his shirt. They were growing thicker all around, and growing outward, just as fast as his biceps. Looking back at his arms, standing there half-paralyzed with shock, he saw in amazement, his sleeves no longer covered most of his arm, as it had before. Now his sleeves went only down to the beginning of his expanding biceps, where the fabric had grown tighter around a thickening arm. The muscles grew out, like they had a mind of their own. His shoulders were quickly widening, filling with more and more mass. Those sleeves seemed to only get shorter as his shoulders expanded. Before long, they only covered the top of his arm. The rest of his now tremendous biceps exposed to view. Davis knew his shirt was tightening around him, he could feel the fabric as it pulled tight across his broadening chest and shoulders, tightening under his arms, the fabric was pulling at his body, as if demanding a release. Those pecs were still expanding out, growing faster, pulling the shirt tighter and tighter, until it reached the breaking point.<br />
<br />
The shirt ripped right on the peak of his left pectoral muscle, and quickly released some of the tension to the shirt, But that gap, which exposed part of his muscular chest, was widening. The tear seemed to stretch downward, over where is rapped around his very muscular, yet large, even bulky stomach. His waist had expanded out, Davis could notice, the jeans he was wearing were way too small now. His thighs showed right through. Davis, feeling them grow smaller on his huge legs, needed to get them off, quick. <br />
<br />
Davis, calmly leaned over to unbutton his tightening pants, but at that moment as he leaned his enormous, massive torso over, a loud rip could be heard. His shirt ripped straight down his back. His back had, apparently, grown far too wide and muscular to hold that shirt any longer. The remains of his shirt fell around his waist, then tumbled to the floor. <br />
<br />
Davis continued to undo his pants, and quickly tried to take them off. They had become far too small on him now, so much so, that it was almost impossible to get them off. But he finally succeeded in removing them.<br />
<br />
Now he was wearing only his boxers, and he could see right through the tight fabric, that hugged his waist, and muscular legs. His neck felt thick and massive, his legs heavy and oversized, his whole upper body felt weighted down by bulk, yet, he was filled with unbounded energy, and strength. He looked at his body, his overgrown muscles, his oversized torso-<br />
<br />
And with that it was over. <br />
<br />
the growth stopped before he realized just what had happened, There Davis stood, transformed into this enormous 300 pound muscle man. His chest bulging out, his impossibly thick shoulders and neck, his chiseled abs, and tremendous arms. There he stood, feeling strong and full of energy...<br />
<br />
&quot;...I...I...this isn’t real-&quot; Touching his chest only confirmed his suspicions. It wasn’t a dream or a hallucination. It was real muscle. &quot;I'm fucking Huge!&quot; he screamed. &quot;this is fucked up, this... this is fucking awesome&quot; He shouted....There again, his mind was filled with thoughts, thoughts of what he could do next... Davis admired his new body, his new form, but wanted something more...</p>
