<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Since in conversions were once-in-a-lifetime moments, it&#39;s not uncommon for some people to make a show out of them, even if the show is only meant for themselves. For instance, there was Clara&#39;s video of her conversion of Richard. Part of it had been publicly released to show how the mayor of Animalia was willing to help others, but the sexiest parts were kept private and Clara sometimes watched it when she wanted to get in the mood. Some conversion videos were intended to be private but ended up getting leaked. Such exposure may be scandalous among humans, but with Animalians, it could kickstart a new career for them.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Fiora was one such person. Her birth name was actually Fiona Flora Ferguson. At least that&#39;s people assume it is. Her mother was notorious for both her flakiness and her illegible penmanship. So she just called herself &#39;Fiora&#39; just to save everyone the trouble. Besides, it was going to be her legal name once she converted. Her choice of Animalian was interesting. She&#39;s always been a bit of a mousy girl, even if her hair is blonde. One would expect her to do something more bold than a mouse, but she watched the Year of the Rat competition and she knew impressive mice can be. Of course, she wanted her conversion to be a little more special than that.<br />
<br />
Fiora was a pretty big science fiction fan, particularly of the very early stories in which chemistry seems to be able to do anything from turn a man completely invisible to making animals and people far larger than they could have grown naturally. And of course, that included Robert Louis Stevenson&#39;s class novel &#39;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&#39;. As such, she wanted her conversion to have a more mad science theme to it. The props she needed were pretty easy to get. Miss Vivian has a large variety of Ripaway costumes for sale, including several scientist sets. Apparently a lot of people like &#39;hulking out&#39; for their conversions. As for her conversion method, she something special in mind too.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Fiora checked to see if the webcam was recording properly. After that, she backed up. She looked like a prim and proper scientist, hair tied up in a bun, large glasses, and the standard labcoat and such. Fiora cleared her throat and said, &quot;For years, I have been searching for the perfect way to bring out the full potential in humans. I do not believe we have to live with whatever dice our parents&#39; genes throw for us. I believe that within each person, there is a hidden code for what may be our ultimate selves. For some people, this perfection lies closer to the surface. Others, like myself, has theirs buried deep away. But this serum I&#39;ve developed should unlock our true potential.&quot;<br />
<br />
Here, she held up a flask filled with a bright green liquid. It was actually a super-concentrated solution containing the Animalian virus, laced with mouse DNA. It was mixed in green apple flavoring to make it more drinkable. &quot;I have tested it on my lab mice for months now and I&#39;m finally satisfied that I&#39;ve devised the formula needed to bring out their potential. Now it&#39;s time for the first human test subject: myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Fiora lifted the flask and drank it all down. The concentrated solution should count as a double-dose. The green apple flavoring covered most of the taste, though she doubted she would have noticed a taste. Almost as soon as it hit her stomach, she could feel the change starting. She cringed and hunched over, dropping the flask. It was made of plastic, so it bounced instead of broke. &quot;It...begins...&quot; she groaned as she felt energy racing through her body. She wasn&#39;t too old, but she wasn&#39;t about to pass up getting back to her youth.<br />
<br />
Her costume soon started to rip as she built up mass. Her muscles bulged, easily breaking through the sleeves of her coat. Grey fur was soon beginning to appear. Fiora pretended to be surprised. &quot;Fur? That&#39;s not supposed to-&quot; she started before grimacing. Her shoes bulged before bursting open, revealing rodent feet. &quot;Oh no, the formula...&quot; groaned Fiora, &quot;It wasn&#39;t designed to bring out the ultimate potential in any mammal. It was designed to bring out the ultimate potential in mice. Which means...&quot;<br />
<br />
Fiora&#39;s transformation seemed to pick up speed, her Ripaway costume tearing apart as her body got younger and fitter. It was actually growing taller than she expected. She groaned as her pants were destroyed by her expanding hips and ass, which left plenty of room for her hairless tail to grow out. She moaned as her labcoat was forced open by her growing breasts. Pretty soon, buttons were popping off as her boobs grew larger than what the flimsy material could hold. Her bra and panties were likewise quick to go. At this point, Fiora was in such a high from her transformation that she didn&#39;t hesitate at all to start groping at one breast while stuffing fingers into her vagina. Her glasses were knocked off as her face stretched out into a mouse&#39;s muzzle. Her hairbun became undone, allowing her more lustrous locks to fall free, her new ears partly parting them. Fiora fingered herself harder as her transformation reached its conclusion. Finally, she let out a loud squeak as she pushed herself over the edge.<br />
<br />
Fiora gasped a little as she calmed down. She looked down at her new body and said, &quot;Whoa, I wasn&#39;t expecting this.&quot; She wasn&#39;t just acting that time. She had expected to get a young, sexy body, but she wasn&#39;t expecting to get such a fit one either. She wasn&#39;t bodybuilder material, at least not yet. But she was very toned, more than she was expecting. She also put on a bit more height than she expected for a mouse. &quot;Guess that serum was more potent than I thought,&quot; said Fiora. She hefted her breasts, which look to be about the same size of her human head. She gave a very Hyde-like smile. &quot;I can&#39;t wait to have more fun with this body,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
While the video was meant for only herself, eventually Miss Fabina saw it. She saw that Fiora had quite a bit of potential when it comes to erotic acting. And since she hadn&#39;t thought much about what she&#39;d be doing post-conversion, Miss Fabina offered her a job doing special mad science-based performances at the Meat Market, along with more explicit videos for adult viewing. Fiora found herself enjoying herself, even more since she had a new boyfriend. Bruno had been a former bodybuilder until rumors of steroid abuse ruined his career. He then went into the porn industry until Project White Lily gave him a chance to start over fresh. But he still do some naughty work at the Meat Market. He was the &#39;test subject&#39; for Fiora&#39;s super-soldier/Frankenstein experiment that she would gloat over before breaking free and ravishing her. As can be imagined, they did a lot of roleplaying in private.</p>
