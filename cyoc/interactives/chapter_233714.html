<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I got the pizzas !&quot; shouted Mike as he came back to the appartment he was sharing with his two flatmates Tony and George. &quot;Is Kylie online already ?&quot;<br />
<br />
The three friends had planned to spend most of the night playing on-line video games with Tony&#39;s younger sister Kylie. But the only answer to Mike&#39;s question was fainted female moanings.<br />
<br />
Mike approached the living room where the three friends had their computers. His two friends were, as expected, in front of their computer, their headset on, masturbating while watching some strange spirals on their screen. Except it wasn&#39;t his friends, but two busty women wearing his friend&#39;s clothes, a as if .... &quot;Is this some kind of a joke ?&quot; thought Mike as his mind was trying to find a rational explanation. Those women couldn&#39;t be his transformed friends, right ? Magic wasn&#39;t a real thing, even if there were unconfirmed rumors about this &quot;Transform or dare&quot; game.<br />
<br />
The woman sitting on Tony&#39;s chair was wearing glasses, like Tony, but hers were neon-pink, the same color as her long hair and her perfectly polished nails. She had C-cup breasts, but the seize seemed to increase each time Toni was fingering her clit. Toni was sweating hard as she was about to climax. Her boy-clothes transformed into a cute pink miniskirt and a crop top showing her tatooed navel. Toni&#39;s desk and computer changed as well, it became typical of a girly girl: all pink, with an unicorn plushy and many double-heard stickers. Her chair also became pink and adapted to her anatomy. Toni climaxed as her transformation was complete: she was a cute 5&#39;6 tall girl with D-cup breasts. <br />
<br />
The woman sitting on George&#39;s chair was tall. At 6&#39;2, she was even taller than George, and very muscular. George was quite fat, but this woman only fatness was in her enormous H-cup boobs. Mike believe he could still recognize George&#39;s face before the woman gained voluptuous, green-colored lips as her short hair also changed color to dark green. Georgie still had a penis, a detail that finally convinced Mike that his two friends were indeed becoming women. But it didn&#39;t last long as Georgie genitalia became fully female. Georgie was wearing a dark-blue jersey with &quot;Miller&quot; and &quot;69&quot; written in yellow letters (another proof she used to be George Miller). Her desk was full of cups and medals she won in various sport competitions, and on the wall there was a big picture of a half-naked female soccer players and female beach volley players wearing bikinis. It was hard to believe this beautiful Amazon was the same person as the nerdy, fat George Miller. In fact, Georgie was everything George dreamt to be - a sucessful athlete - only female.<br />
<br />
Their transformation finished, Toni and Georgie hugged, then kissed in front of Mike, who was freaking out and asked: &quot;Tony, George ? What happened to you guys ?&quot;<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t it obvious ?&quot; said Georgie, pointing at her own boobs.<br />
&quot;Kylie sent us a program to improve our live. You&#39;ll love it !&quot; Toni stated, excited.<br />
&quot;No thanks&quot; Mike said, as he tried to walk back, out of the appartment.<br />
&quot;You have no choice&quot; precised Toni. &quot;This is a lesbian-only flat, we won&#39;t have a man as our flatmate !&quot;<br />
<br />
Georgie immobilized Mike, and then forced him to sit at his computer, while Toni put the headgear on Mike&#39;s ears and started the hypnotic video. Mike tried to resist, but his willpower weakened and he started to listen to the female voice who was repeating: &quot;Jen is your Goddess. Worship her and you will be blessed&quot;. &quot;There is no such thing as a God&quot; replied Mike who was an atheist. But an image formed in his mind, the image of an incredibly beautiful woman and Mike instantly fell in love with her. He began to feel her presence in his mind and became aware than she was Jen, and that she was more than human. She was a Goddess. &quot;My  Goddess&quot; thought Mike as blue makeup appeared on his face.<br />
<br />
And Goddess Jen spoke to Mike: &quot;Women shall fuck women, and everyone shall be a lesbian.&quot;<br />
<br />
Those words imprinted into Mike&#39;s mind. He smiled and started thinking about it. Wouldn&#39;t a woman know better than a man how to please another woman ? Wouldn&#39;t they share a deeper emotional connection ? That would be logical. That would explain why he had so much trouble scoring with women, while his flatmates Toni and Georgie could easily find new girlfriends. In fact, the few times he had brought a girl home, the girl had ended up the night with either Toni and Georgie after finding out she was a lesbian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes ... Women shall fuck women&quot; concluded Mike as his ears became pierced and earrings (shaped as double-venus symbols) appeared on each ear lobe. A rainbow flag and multiple political tracts advocating lesbianism and female empowerment appeared on his desk.<br />
<br />
In fact, Mike could no longer think of any reason a woman would be sexually attracted to a man. Maybe because they were socially coerced into liking men when they shall naturally fuck other women ?<br />
&quot;The Second Amendment should be: &quot;The Sacred Right of the Women to be Lesbians shall not be infringed&quot; thought Mike as his Adam&#39;s apple disappeared and long blue hair grew down past his (smaller) shoulders. His arms became slender and long blue fingernails enhanced the beauty of his delicate hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about men ?&quot; Mike continued thinking as the video he was forced to watch showed more women fucking each other, with the hypnotic spiral slowly fading. &quot;If all women are lesbian, and men are still mostly heterosexual, they would harrass women, maybe sexually assault them.&quot; As he formulated the problem, he also imagined a solution: &quot;Men shall take female hormones to decrease their libido and increase their breast size!&quot; Indeed, Mike developped C-cup breasts. He touched his sensitive nipples, and his breast grew larger. His black T-shirt expanded to make room for his gorgeous H-cup boobbs, it also changed to display a rainbow flag and the sentence &quot;proud of my big girls&quot; written in pink letters.<br />
<br />
At that point, Mike thought again about what Goddess Jen had told him: &quot;Women shall fuck women, and everyone shall be a lesbian.&quot; This was the Divine Truth. So Mike identified herself as a transgendered woman named Mina. And Mina was blessed by the Goddess: her dick and balls were absorbed inside her body where they became a clitoris and two ovaries; a womb and a vagina formed and a slit openned to make her 100% female. On her desk, appeared the book she wrote. Its title was &quot;The Divine Cocoon&quot; and on the back cover it was written: &quot;Mina Summers is an outspoken lesbian / transgender rights activist. She explains how joining the Church of Jen helped her to become the woman she was meant to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mina&#39;s transformation was over. She sent an email to thank Kylie, then joined Toni and Georgie who were having a good time together. The three little nerds had become three gorgeous lesbian cultists. But Goddess Jen still needed more worshippers.</p>
