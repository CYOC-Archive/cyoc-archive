<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rei ran towards the light and paused once he caught up to his sister and saw what she saw. It was an abandoned underground village in ruins, and the light came from a magical torch that burned with white fire. &quot;What in the....&quot; Rei said but paused awestruck by what he was seeing.<br />
<br />
&quot;A village? Down here?&quot; Amelina asked and Rei paused and looked at the torch and asked,&quot;How is this still burning? This place looks like it was abandoned long ago.&quot; Rei wasn’t wrong, most of the buildings in the village had holes in them from battle, and if not that the wood was rotting on them. The cave itself was illuminated by a large crystal overhead, and a beacon of light shot up into it and reflected the light all around the cave. Amelina shrugged then looked to the town and said,&quot;Maybe there’s some supplies we can loot, and if those drawings were right then maybe there’s something for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rei paused and crossed his arms then he gave Amelina a smug grin and said,&quot;And here I was thinking that I would be the first to stoop to that level.&quot; Amelina turned around and punched Rei in the arm and said,&quot;Shut up already, you definitely need something to cover up that crotch of yours, horny bastard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rei paused then growled,&quot;Hey, what happened in that cave was an accident and nothing more!&quot; Amelina turned around and started towards the village and yelled back,&quot;All the more reason to get you a loincloth, or something that will stop you from &#39;accidentally&#39; cumming yourself.&quot; Rei groaned and facepalmed then he ran back up to Amelina and said,&quot;Well look who&#39;s being sassy now, well played sister, well played.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two walked for a few minutes and eventually they got to the town, and Amelina looked to Rei and said,&quot;Maybe there’s something that can help at least cover that tailgate of yours up.&quot; Rei looked back at his tails and his ass and chuckled,&quot;You’re just mad that yours doesn’t look this good. Besides I would rather find something that would help me....well actually be able get home without being killed.&quot; Amelina rolled her eyes at Rei and he intentionally walked past her and bent over.<br />
<br />
Amelina shielded her eyes then a blue ball of magic appeared in her hand and she tossed it and hit one of Rei’s tails with it. Rei’s tail immediately froze to the ground and Rei saw this and whimpered,&quot;Hey, you didn’t need to do that.&quot; Amelina then walked past Rei and said,&quot;Just look around, and stop showing off hothead.&quot; Rei paused then sighed,&quot;Okay,&quot; then he turned around and took a deep breath and exhaled a stream of fire that helped thaw out his tail, so he could rejoin Amelina.<br />
<br />
Rei ran up to Amelina as they approached the center where the beacon of light shot up from, and there was just a giant hole in the ground where the pillar shot up from. &quot;Something tells me that if we do anything to this then everything goes dark. So I’m going to just leave this be for now.&quot; Rei exclaimed then Amelina paused and shrugged,&quot;Most likely, but I think we should at least investigate it.&quot; Rei nodded then said,&quot;Fair enough, but let’s at least see what’s around here first. Maybe something neat or useful we can take back.&quot; <br />
<br />
Amelina paused then nodded to Rei and said,&quot;Just he careful, and if we meet up next to a pool of dragon semen then I swear to god I’m going to freeze that sheath shut.&quot; Rei paused then commented,&quot;Ouch, okay point taken, but be careful yourself. I don’t want to have to break you out of a trap, or see you end up like this or whatever. Meet back here when you’re done.&quot; Amelina gave Rei a quick nod then she ran off in a direction and Rei went off in the opposite direction.<br />
<br />
The first standing house that Rei approached looked pretty sturdy for what it was. &quot;Alright let’s see what’s inside, at least I&#39;ll see how these people lived with those...&quot; Rei paused then looked at his claw and sighed,&quot;Right, never mind then.&quot; Rei at first tried the door, but it was locked, and he tried forcing it open with his body but failed. &quot;Stupid...little....DOOR!&quot; Rei roared then he punched the door as hard as he could and it fell over off of the hinges.<br />
<br />
Rei paused and looked at his fist and thought,&quot;Huh, either I&#39;m surprisingly strong or it was extremely weak.&quot; Rei then shook his head and refocused himself on the house and entered it. Looking around, Rei noticed this was a living room with broken furniture all around him, and nothing seemed to be useful to him. Rei then saw a rotting staircase to his left, and in he attempted to use it to walk upstairs. However, the steps creaked under his bulky weight, and as he started to put weight on the last couple of steps they cracked beneath his paw and gave way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot; Rei growled as the steps collapsed and he scrambled to grab something and he managed to dig his claw into the floor just above him. Rei looked down at what appeared to be a cellar ow and his heart raced and he chuckled to himself,&quot;Heh, a dragon falling and injuring himself sounds pretty ironic right about now.&quot; Rei then carefully hoisted himself up onto the second floor and he saw a large bedroom. However something was off about the room as he saw both a nest and a large bed for a couple.<br />
<br />
Rei then saw an end with a drawer next to the bed, so he opened it up and saw a set of old photos. The pictures didn’t have color and seemed rather old, but what they were of absolutely shocked Rei. The first picture showed a male humanoid dragon and a female human almost like a married couple. The second showed the male dragon proposing to the woman. The third then made Rei almost sick as it showed the woman growing scales all over her body, and there was a bite mark on her arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what the hell am I looking at?&quot; Rei thought as he moved to the fourth picture and he saw a female dragon that stood and kissed the male dragon in the sunset. Rei figured this dragon was the woman from before, but with the next picture he almost legitimately vomited as it was a picture of the female bent over and the male was mating with her. &quot;Ah! Why is there a picture of this?!&quot; Rei growled but paused and as he looked at this picture more his dicks began to emerge from its sheath. &quot;No, no! Not again you bastards!&quot; Rei growled and tried to push his cocks back in, but he couldn’t and they again stood at full erect length.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck!&quot; Rei growled then sighed and went onto the last photo and it showed them hugging and the female had a pregnant stomach. Rei then took a deep breath and sighed,&quot;Goddamn it, why did I come in here again, and when will THESE THINGS fuck off!&quot; <br />
<br />
Rei then groaned and skimmed through the pictures again, and scanned them all individually then paused at a sudden thought. &quot;Wait if this dragon was one that changed this woman then...oh fuck Amelina!&quot; Rei thought as he realized that this place may have once housed peaceful humans and dragons, but if they transformed them like this then Kat might encounter one that’s still alive, dragons do live far longer than humans after all. <br />
<br />
As Rei’s fears rised his cocks sheathed again, then Rei saw a window and charged out of it. Rei hit the ground outside of the house and growled, and slowly got to his feet. Rei then looked to his wings and whimpered,&quot;I hope I know how to use you things.&quot; <br />
<br />
Rei then took a deep breath and took to the air, and began looking around frantically for Amelina. Rei still had the photos on him to show Amelina of course, but he didn’t really care for them at the moment. Rei then spotted Amelina out of the corner of his eye, but....</p>
