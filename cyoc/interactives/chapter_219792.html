<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kara closed her eyes letting the warmth from Milo’s seed spread within her, she prayed to God that this wasn’t the last time, that they would stay the same gender even as they transformed into merpeople but if the worse should happen that his seed would strike home and they would at least have a kid together. She had stopped birth control, telling him of course the moment they had started showing signs of the mermaid virus. Both of them wanted a kids but had planned to wait until after the wedding and they owned a house, now they had spent all that money to buy one room in a three bedroom apartment in New Atlantis. Still there was a 50/50 chance that Milo, the love of her life would be a mermaid not a merman so they had to at least try. She knew she had a chance of becoming a merman but the odds of that were 1/10,000 so she wasn’t as concerned.<br />
<br />
Milo was closing his eyes as sleep began to take him as well as Kara slid out of him and down his chest so that her head rested on his bare chest in the hot tub. His hand wrapping around her bare back as both of them let sleep take them both.<br />
<br />
Kara opened her eyes an unknown time later to find that they weren’t alone anymore.<br />
<br />
“So one of the loved fishes is waking up.” Said a beautiful woman with impossible short impossible dark red hair, her eyes where also a deep red. Her breasts were small and contained within the same white one-piece swimsuit that everyone going through the changes seamed to have to wear.<br />
<br />
“Looks like it.” Said a man, with neon green hair and the beginning of a beard which was also green. The two of them were in one of the other hot tubes relaxing. His eyes where a darker green and he had the same suit on as the women.<br />
<br />
“Hello? How are you?” inquired the man “I am Aaron.”<br />
<br />
“Oh sorry.” Said Kara as she covered her breasts as she pulled away from Milo.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about it.” Said the women “I am Lindsay and you wouldn’t about it, your walk in or swim in I should say during your transformation. Who are you?”<br />
<br />
“Kara and this is my boyfriend Milo.” Explained Kara as she looked back, she didn’t see any growing breasts on Milo and she could still feel his dick brushing against her under the water so he was still a man. The one thing that really stood out at the moment was that his blonde hair had become an almost bright golden yellow. <br />
<br />
“Milo…wake up.” Ordered Kara as Milo opened his eyes, his blue eyes where still blue but now where an impossible bright blue. <br />
<br />
“What?” inquired Milo as he opened his eyes to see they weren’t alone. He turned toward Kara, her hair had changed drastically from a dark brown to a silver color and her green eyes where an impossible almost memorizing shade of blue. “Kara…your face.”<br />
<br />
“What?” asked Kara as she got out of the hot tube, not really caring about being nude before walking up to a mirror. What looked back at her was basically herself only with blue eyes and she now become a metallic silver hair color. She looked toward her knee where the scales had first appeared to find that almost one of her whole legs was now covered with scales from ankle to the opening of her womanhood. Patches of the scales were silver, white and the same blue as her eyes. <br />
<br />
“My God.” Said Kara before she realized that she was nude and quickly slipped on the suit. <br />
<br />
She watched as Milo got out of the tub and walked toward the mirror. He still had a dick but his balls where gone, instead a still human shaft was coming out of basically a scale covered pair of swim trunks. The scales where a mixture of gold and a rather beautiful bronze color. <br />
<br />
“Does this mean I am staying a man?” inquired Milo<br />
<br />
“Not for sure buddy.” Answered Aaron as he pulled himself out of the water to show that both his legs were covered in green scales and his feet had expanded outwards to look like he was wearing diving fins. “I would say the odds have gone up, more so if your balls have moved inside but that can change quickly.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks.” said Milo as he put on his own suit as Lindsay got out of the water and with Aaron’s help was put into a wheelchair. Her legs had fused from the knees up into a single tail which was a mixture of different shades of red scales along with a few black scales. Small fins had grown from her hips and her still human legs from the knee down had at least doubled in length. <br />
<br />
“Care to join us for some dinner?” inquired Lindsay “We are all transforming and who knows we might be neighbors when we get down there. Or maybe your like to go back to your bedroom?”</p>
