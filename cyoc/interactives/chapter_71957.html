<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As your vision comes back, you look around you. Everything appears to be so colorful and vibrant. It feels like you're in a anime. You look at yourself and you gasp as you see how colorful and vibrant your skin has become. You look around some more and notice that the other girls are free too, all naked as you are smiling and giving friendly waves towards you and to others. You notice besides the bright colors something else that's odd, the other girls have very big eyes and their hair have very unusual colors: such as purple with highlights of pink, etc. You begin to think &quot; has the mother tree warped you into some anime world?&quot; As you begin to move towards the others. You feel a slight tugging as you do and you look down to see a vine attached inside your groin and as you look behind you you see another vine sticking out your rear. You blush at this and when you look at the other girls you can see they have it the same way, all blushing too at their predicament. You try to contact the mother tree to understand why it is this way. The mother tree responds telepathically as usual.<br />
<br />
&quot; We are now in a era in which human beings have long gone extinct as a result of their own pollution and abuse of the planet. The planet had decided long ago that humans were a waste of it's energy... but us trees argued with the planet that there were humans out there that were still pure and were worthy of life. So the planet chose a few of us all over the world to become &quot;mother trees&quot; whom would take in some noteworthy humans and have them merge with us trees. After that, we would wait for 2,000 years as the world struggled to divert any violence towards us trees while we waited, while slowly the world killed off all remaining humans through converting the air to a miasma state. There were survivors of course, but those that remained slowly succumbed to suicidal thoughts of the loss of others and eventually none remained. Now, we have reborn the humans that had merged with us as a new human/plant species that will live as plants do, but also have the mobility of humans through their humanish forms. This will conserve the energy of the planet and it will slowly be able to recover from it's losses. We also hoped that picking humans whom have experienced alienation from others would be able to endure this transition and create a new world for the planet to witness. We trust that you will.&quot;<br />
<br />
You sigh in despair at the thought of your family and all other humans being brought to their ends. Though you realize this was also your choice when you chose to merge with the tree instead of going home to be with them at the end. You can see the other girls feel a similar emotion to the news. You suddenly feel the urge to release your fecal matter and urine again and you look down to see them pass through the vines inserted into you. &quot; So that's where they went all these years,&quot; you think. You look back up at the others, wondering what to do next. They all kinda sit the best they could with the vines sticking out of them as they conversed with the others. You had always found talking to be boring, being more of an introvert then just shy, but suddenly hearing their voices interested you and you begin to voice your own opinions about the world as well. You love the way your voice sounds now, and it slowly builds your confidence. <br />
<br />
Years pass by as you and the others travel the world for the others, noticing you can detach the vines and reattach them to the ground as you please to move; they simply withdrew into your nether regions when unwanted and came back out to reattach to the ground when you were hungry or you simply had to use the bathroom. You noticed over the years you and the others never aged, and the mother tree confirmed it was because you were part plant now and as a result your body was exposed to no mutations that would cause aging. You also noticed everyone you met was female and looked like a anime character. The mother tree explained this was because female was the default gender and as a result used less energy to maintain. The animeish appearance was simply due to the female's enhanced capabilities to see color and the need to absorb more light through the eyes to complete the photosynthesis process. <br />
<br />
Eventually, 1000 years passed by and the sun had long since been through the supernova phase and black-hole phase. Those years hence had greatly payed off, the large absorption of light through your animeish eyes produced a bio illumination effect and each of you glowed differently in the darkness and aftermath of the sun. Apparently, you had been used along with the others, to absorb the energy of the sun's supernova so the planet would be protected. The black hole had drawn the planet into it, but maintained it's form through the opposing energy of the supernova channeled through you and the others. The planet had just finally reached a new galaxy through this 1000 year trip, and you finally understood everything. The planet was conserving energy for this eventual fate and used you and the others to survive all the effects after the event took place. Now in another galaxy far from any impending disasters, the planet could now rest, basking in the bright bio illumination of this new human race it had produced. The mother tree mentally spoke it's final words to you and the others before it went into it's sleep state as it was no longer needed: &quot; you may now do as you please, my young demi goddesses. For as you see, you and your sisters have achieved an eternal form of energy that will support the planet's being and yourselves forevermore. There is no need for death, as it was merely another way to conserve energy and matter, as well as no need for birth as you and your sisters are all the planet needs to survive now. Farewell, do as you please with your eternal life and enjoy your new chance at life with no limits.&quot; You smiled, loving your glowing body and having others to love and to be loved by. You were finally at peace with the world.<br />
<br />
