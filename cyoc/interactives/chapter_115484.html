<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Three boys walking around, watched as the giant bouncy ball was being rolled away. They knew that guy and thought of how funny it was that he picked on people, and now the clown made him a bouncy ball. &quot;Hey do you think the dudes just hiding somewhere ready to beat up whoever made fun of him being a giant ball?&quot; The others thought the same thing and stopped laughing. As they walked along one of them said &quot;hey do you think that clown might know if he&#39;s really around or not? I mean if he&#39;s not around no one will care then, right?&quot; The others laughed as he said &quot;around&quot;. Noticing this he laughed to and bumped into someone backing up. He turned around and there was the clown, smiling and ushering them into his tent. The three just shrugged and walked in.<br />
<br />
It looked like some small stand on the outside, like one of those small psychic stands. But inside was a huge stage, and hundreds of seats standing empty. The clown ushered all three up to the stage, and with a goofy voice said &quot;who wants to be first? Ooooh! How about you!&quot; He said pointing to one of the bigger ones. He pointed to himself and said &quot;me? Eh! Why not! Hey guys, maybe I&#39;ll turn into a ball too! Hahaha!&quot; The clown shook his head and giggled. &quot;What would you like to be when your older? What can inflates the clown do for?&quot; He said with a stupid giggle. The boy thought about it for a while, he always did have a dream, to be the biggest power lifter the state ever saw. &quot;I wanna be the biggest power lifter, maybe even offensive lineman, oh! I just want to be big like that! Big and strong, that I&#39;d fit right in as the strongest guy this state has ever seen!&quot; He stopped himself, the other two looking at him funny. He never told anyone that, and shook his head in confusion.<br />
<br />
Inflates shook his head up and down and giggled. &quot;Big boys need to be bigger!&quot; He giggled as he brought out a tank and a pile of massive cloths. He picked up the pair of sweat pants and said &quot;wow! These are huge! There bigger then a table cloth in the waste!&quot; The others laughed, and the clown pointed at him to put them on. There was a dressing curtain on the stage behind him and he began to change quick. He didn&#39;t want them to see him all natural. He never liked underwear and didn&#39;t wear any, mostly because it made him uncomfortable, like he felt now. He walked out almost tripping over the folds of the pants. His sweatshirt was so big he looked like if he moved wrong he&#39;d drown in a see of black.<br />
<br />
Looking at an emblem on the cloths he realized this wasn&#39;t just sweats, it was workout sweats for a professional gym up the way. It was known for major power lifters and lineman that workout there, all of them striving to be the biggest. They even made the doors bigger, so some of the ones that juiced so much, could get in sideways from there bulk. He laughed and pointed to the others at the logo. They all laughed as he said &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;m the kinda material for this gym inflates!&quot; The clown giggled loudly and showed a sparkling cloth. Before the boy knew what hit him, the clown covered his bottom with the cloth, and pulled it away saying &quot;tada!&quot; <br />
<br />
Where once there was a massive pile of sweat pants was now just fitting his legs. His legs and waste were now huge! His calves were these giant mounds of muscle, veins almost poking out of the legs of his pants. His thighs were even bigger, stretching his pants out to almost bursting. Big powerful legs that looked like they belonged as trunks on a tree rather then him. &quot;Dude! Look at your ass and waste!&quot; He saw his waste was so wide it looked comical compared to his small flat stomach. The sweatshirt still overlapped the top of him, but when it got to his waste, it almost didn&#39;t make the girth! &quot;Inflates, is there a mirror?&quot; The clown grabbed a bag and pulled out a long length mirror. He saw his ass and almost busted out laughing! It was so huge it looked like a person in itself! The cheeks were giant shelves of flesh and muscle, he couldn&#39;t even imaging being able to fit through a door, much less a double door! &quot;Hey inflates! Why do I have such a huge ass! I know powerlifters need a huge ass, but this is ridiculous!&quot; He slapped his ass, and saw it WAS all muscle! It didn&#39;t even ripple! He also saw it wasn&#39;t some trick, this really was his ass! <br />
<br />
&quot;Guys! This bottom part is really me!&quot; He said surprised, now feeling his powerful legs. He tried to walk, but could only waddle slightly, his mass to big to walk normal. Before he could freak out, the clown brought the cloth back, and with a whisk of sparkle the top part changed. Now the sweatshirt could hardly contain his upper body, the muscle and bulk almost spilling out of the stretched seams. His biceps, which were once just making 17inches, now puffed out to a whopping size! They were so big, that between his wings panned lats,they couldn&#39;t even touch his sides. Large veins bulged out of his sleeves, making him look like a bodybuilder. And his chest was so big, his pecks were heavy slabs of muscle, popping out both sideways and down. They looked like no bra could hold him even if it tried, let alone a t shirt! <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god! Your HUGE!&quot; The one said as he tried to see his feet. He tried to look down, but his shoulder were so big and wide, they almost covered his normal sized head. His boobs didn&#39;t help either, and he swiveled slowly back to the mirror to see. That&#39;s when he noticed the bulbous gut coming out of the front of him, matching the huge ass. &quot;I&#39;m a massive power lifter! But my gut! It&#39;s so big and heavy!&quot; He said picking it up with his veiny calloused hands. &quot;Mmmmm big boys have big bellies!&quot; Inflates said as he came up to him again, covering his head this time. With a whoosh, his small head disappeared, replaced by that of a monstrous man. His cheeks were puffed out, making him look almost obese, but his neck now was fluent with his shoulders. There was no longer any way to tell where one began, and one ended. His forehead looked like that from a primate more then a human, and his head almost bald. There was some hair there, but it was shaved like powerlifters usually do. By far his entire body was so big and heavy, the gym would have been proud to have him as the mascot for it! That is if they wouldn&#39;t turn him away for being to big to enter it! &quot;I&#39;m so BIG!&quot; He shouted, his voice almost booming. He was now from a measly 5&#39;8&quot; to a towering 6&#39;11&quot;. His lumbering body clumsily waddled around the stage, looking almost comical as he tried to move toward his friends and the clown. &quot;Dude! I&#39;d be careful!!! The wood is creaking from your weight!!!! It might collapse!&quot; He stopped and put his big powerful hands over his face, crying in a deep, testosterone filled voice. That was when....</p>
