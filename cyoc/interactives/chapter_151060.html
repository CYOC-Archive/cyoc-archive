<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Duinir! I-,&quot; Vect&#39;s elation at finally seeing his mentor after being kept away for the last few days, dissipated when he saw the smoking hole in the wall he&#39;d created. &quot;Oh um. I can probably fix that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Duinir glanced into the hole beside him and then smiled. &quot;I think you have some work ahead of you.&quot; Vect was taken aback by how old Duinir looked. &quot;I know it looks bad, but could you not stare,&quot; he said, but with a joking tone to his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Vect forced himself to instead focus on the hole in his cabin wall. &quot;Did I really do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed. It seems shaman Gratz&#39;s prediction was true. Tell me, what were you dreaming about? I haven&#39;t seen you toss like that since...,&quot; Duinir&#39;s voice trailed off, unsure of how to phrase his thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since after the raid,&quot; Vect finished the thought. &quot;It wasn&#39;t exactly a dream.&quot; He explained to the rapidly aged elf about this creature that called itself Amnael and it&#39;s offer to teach him how to use magic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, perhaps our hall of records can help you find out how to handle this unwanted guest. I know Ruvenon will find it fascinating to study,&quot; Duinir pondered. &quot;I haven&#39;t heard of something like this before, but then again I don&#39;t have experience with people that have, even partially, merged with a dragon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing here anyway? Or for that matter, why have you been avoiding me,&quot; Vect&#39;s voice having a slight edge of anger to it.<br />
<br />
Duinir sighed and almost seemed to age even more as his smile faded. &quot;Forgive me my lord, I should not have turned away my ward. I had to get my affairs in order in a short amount of time, something I have in short supply,&quot; Duinir said sarcastically.<br />
<br />
Vect felt a pang of guilt at this. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t imagine what you are feeling now,&quot; Vect averted his gaze. <br />
<br />
&quot;We both have issues that desperately need to be discussed. I should have at least said something to you before I locked myself away.&quot;<br />
<br />
They remained sitting in silence for a few moments before there was a banging on his cabin door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enter,&quot; Vect said.<br />
<br />
The door swung open and the skyship&#39;s captain stepped through the doorway. &quot;I would much prefer you didn&#39;t put holes in my ship,&quot; the large man frowned, obviously holding back his anger.<br />
<br />
Vect stood up and bowed low. &quot;My apologies captain. I have never been able to use magic before and this was just as unexpected for me,&quot; he indicated the hole. &quot;If you have the materials I can try to repair the damages.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The offer is nice, but I am not in the habit of making passengers work. Just promise it won&#39;t happen again and pay the repair costs.&quot; He considered the two elves before him and rubbed his chin. &quot;An inexperienced mage is a dangerous thing. I can&#39;t have my ship randomly catching fire midflight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will supervise him and keep this hellion in line,&quot; Duinir offered, his smile returning upon seeing Vect&#39;s indignant expression. &quot;In fact, I think we should go above deck and practice,&quot; he half pushed Vect towards the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just don&#39;t get in the crew&#39;s way,&quot; the captain stood aside and let them pass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I think you might like what I have in mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
------ 2 days later-----<br />
<br />
&quot;So...any advice Erress,&quot; Vect asked worriedly.<br />
<br />
&#39;You mean besides to not look down? No. I still do not understand why you find this so difficult.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;You literally feel the same thing I&#39;m feeling right now! How in the mine hells do you not understand,&quot; Vect fumed.<br />
<br />
&#39;Feeling and understanding something are two completely different things.&#39; Erress countered flatly. &#39;Dragons never have to worry about heights.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;How fortunate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Far below, Duinir, Faral, and the ship&#39;s captain looked up at the entertaining sight. Holding tightly to the mast with one hand, Vect held out his other and let the magic flow out as he exerted his will on the ropes before him. With the crew holding the sail, Vect slowly tied the ropes to secure it from his perch. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you looking at,&quot; Edran asked curiously as approached. He then followed their gaze and his eyes widened. &quot;Anyone want to explain why our lord is hanging from a ship mast?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Practice.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re surprisingly calm about this,&quot; Faral smiled to her twin.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I just know raising my voice will do no good at this point, so why bother?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He is in no danger. If he falls we can catch him,&quot; the old elf explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...think I&#39;m just going to go lie down and pretend this isn&#39;t happening,&quot; Edran turned slowly to leave before Duinir grabbed his arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;He will be fine. I would never let him come to harm under my watch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not doubt your dedication, but does he really need to be up there? Couldn&#39;t he try that spell from down here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Duinir pursed his lips. Looked up towards Vect then back to Edran, &quot;could the spell reach?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...well let us think of this as a way for our young lord to overcome his fears.&quot; Behind Duinir, Faral tried to surpress a giggle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I have finished tying the sail ropes, can I come down now,&quot; Vect called timidly from his perch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are the ropes good and tight,&quot; Duinir called up to the crew. Each checked the knots and called out their satisfaction. &quot;Then yes you can come down, without climbing,&quot; he added quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You expect me to jump?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I expect you to use the spells I have taught you, or did I waste my time boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To the deepest pits of hell with you,&quot; Vect muttered under his breath as he looked around for some inspiration for how to get down. Finally he decided on the most direct route, closed his eyes, and let go of the mast. <br />
<br />
He felt his stomach tighten as he began to feel his body fall. He wanted to open his eyes, but fought against the impulse and muttered the words for the spell to slow his decent. Feeling the foreign sensation of Mana flowing through his body and bending to his will was almost intoxicating. Vect understood now in a small way how mages felt and why they crave greater power.<br />
<br />
&#39;Feels amazing doesn&#39;t it, little one,&#39; Erress cooed. <br />
<br />
The magic ended once Vect&#39;s feet touched gently on the deck. He opened his eyes, and blinked several times to ease the ache from keeping his eyes shut so tightly. <br />
<br />
&quot;You did well,&quot; there was pride in Duinir&#39;s voice, &quot;how did it feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I&#39;ve gone my whole life with a blindfold on,&quot; Vect said excitedly. &quot;The distance up wasn&#39;t pleasant though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The first step to conquering one&#39;s fears is to face them. Isn&#39;t that right Edran,&quot; Faral glanced at her twin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I suppose you are right,&quot; he relented, understanding their logic. &quot;Doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m happy about it though. How long before we land captain?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One hour. After we take care of our cargo, we should be back in the air in say 5 hours if Sir Duinir has no trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
Resting his hand on his sword hilt Duinir smiled. &quot;No trouble should be expected that I can&#39;t handle. I may be aging rapidly but I am still able.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish you luck sir. All according to plan, and we&#39;ll be at your destination in 4 more days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost 2,000 miles traveled in just 2 days,&quot; Edran shook his head in disbelief once the captain was out of earshot. &quot;I formally apologize for doubting your choice in transportation for this voyage home. I was expecting this ship to be slow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never underestimate the power of a well constructed skyship. If it wasn&#39;t for waterbound ships being cheaper to build, sky travel would be the dominant power. I had once thought of purchasing my own ship once, before I was asked to join Lord Corellion&#39;s court,&quot; Duinir&#39;s smile faltered as he reflected on his younger days, something that was rapidly slipping away. &quot;Let&#39;s go, I may need you three to help carry some items.&quot;<br />
<br />
Below them, and growing closer, was a pass between 2 high mountain ranges. And resting between them was a sprawled settlement between them called Broken Tooth Passage.</p>
