<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gean was a man of honor and a man of duty. And even after gaining the details from the <br />
angels, he found that while he had no love for Jasmine, he also had no hatred towards her <br />
for the death of Robert, it had been war after all, and Gean had been a solider too long to <br />
hold anymore malice towards soldiers on opposing sides, in particular when he was just <br />
programmed and body hijacked almost into serving the side he did to begin with. Some <br />
might have darkly joked that for Gean it should have been same old-same old, but <br />
contrary to popular belief, in Gean's opinion of course, you did not get a personality <br />
transplant after becoming a soldier. <br />
<br />
Gean's career as a solider had been respectable, but nothing extraordinary. He had made <br />
one mark on history now.  He was the first -male- shiva fennec fox to exist! <br />
<br />
Gean realized that while he had no desire to cheat death, he had no desire to return to an <br />
assist living home. He had gone back of course, to deliver Robert's final message to his <br />
family, and told his house mates what had transpired. Naturally they all felt he was crazy: <br />
what for depended on who you asked. Some thought he was crazy for going, some <br />
thought he was crazy for coming back, and some thought he was crazy for giving up <br />
another run at life, thankfully as of Project Return no one thought he was crazy for his <br />
story in of itself. <br />
<br />
And Gean, as a man of duty and honor, took one look at the kid now on the throne of <br />
crazy little kingdom Gean had been service contracted into working for, and knew this <br />
couldn't end well. Oh he knew the kid was a vast improvement from the two lunatics that <br />
had previous been king of these foxes (who the real deal were now coming out of hiding <br />
with Karther/Tamthis gone and Project Return on at last). But he also knew that this kid no <br />
matter what experience he had gleaned from Karther, was still totally knew at ruling a <br />
country. Gean wouldn't say he had any experience either, but he knew this kid was going <br />
to need all the help he could get. <br />
<br />
He knew Alexandra was really just some geek who got mutated into one of Karther's work <br />
hands... but he was sorry to see her go, she was cute. From the reactions of Kathy, who <br />
had apparently been once Karther but wasn't anymore (he had no idea how to figure that <br />
one out!), some were going to miss her a LOT more than he was...<br />
<br />
In a way however, Alexandra leaving only reaffirmed Gean's own choice. With Alexandra <br />
gone, this kid had one less person he could turn to in trouble. <br />
<br />
So when Jennifer came face to face with King Tommy and he offered to terminate her <br />
service contract with the kingdom of the fennec kitsune, Jennifer had refused, but -did- <br />
request some major modifications. <br />
<br />
For starters she was allowed to hold citizenship of both her native and adopted land. Then <br />
she landed herself a promotion, and a pay-right, and some private leave to tie up personal <br />
ends. Finally he requested that her RNA and Y chromosome be restored.  Gean had been <br />
very precise that he did not want his biological age altered.  This of course meant the now <br />
nine tailed fennec kitsune only had about one hundred or so years left of life.<br />
<br />
Now holding nine tails the fennec kitsune elder was quickly respected by King Tommy, <br />
Kathy, and the precious few others that had chosen to stay at Tommy' side. <br />
<br />
Of course Gean's kids thought he was crazy, but he was an adult and didn't need their <br />
approval, one of his grandkids even demanded he become a fox person too which his <br />
parents immediately shot down. <br />
<br />
Of course, Gean was also a splash of cold water to any furry who laid eyes on him, a harsh <br />
reminded that old age didn't go away simply because you changed genders or species. <br />
Gean got quite a bit of satisfaction from that. <br />
<br />
His King had regretfully informed him that since Roberta was dead, there was no way to <br />
transmute her corpse to resemble her original self. Gean didn't know the first thing about <br />
magic and wasn't about to argue the point.   Gean had taken Roberta's body back to the <br />
states where it could be given a proper burial and Robert could be given a proper <br />
goodbye. <br />
<br />
As it was now, Gean was effective captain of the guard, chief of police, and possibly <br />
general of the army. They'd likely have a more coherent hierarchy once some more willing <br />
recruit could be found for the fennec city state and possible when that Lucy girl decided <br />
where she wanted to go and what she wanted to do with herself and that woman Natalie <br />
got enough of her wits back... Maybe they'd join Gean on the male side of things, it was <br />
possible. <br />
<br />
Even with the angels themselves keeping the mostly theologic arabs from declaring the <br />
fennec kitsune all trespassers, Gean was glade he was there with the kid to make sure his <br />
king didn't say the wrong thing at the wrong time or accidently start a war. It had taken <br />
everything just to convince the arabs even begrudgingly to -let- the kitsune -buy- the <br />
land the city state was standing on. Thankfully some of Karther's gold and jewels wasn't <br />
just sand. <br />
<br />
Gean flexed his multiple sets of arms, and looked down into one of the palace's fountain <br />
and saw his new furry and wrinkly face and muzzle looking back at him. &quot;I won't say I'm <br />
glade bastard Karther got me to sign that damn contract. But I will say I'm satisfied with <br />
how things have turned out. And that'll do I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Mi'Elder Jen, er, Gean...His Majesty desires you within his presence. He seeks your <br />
wisdom in the lawful acquisition of willful volunteers for our city's protectors to replace <br />
the near mindless constructs that still make up the majority of our forces...&quot; <br />
<br />
Gean turned his head and looked down at Kathy. This was supposed to have been Karther? <br />
He guessed his king was right when the kid said there was nothing left of the bastard <br />
inside this sweet thing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I'm coming.&quot; Wearing nothing but a loincloth and a decorated sash, the shiva male <br />
fennec kitsune made his way through he palace of the fennec kitsune King Tommy.</p>
