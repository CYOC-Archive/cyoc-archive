<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, when you put it like that, I can&#39;t really refuse such an offer, can I. Sure, I would love to become your personal feeder.&quot; Agreed Lexi. It wasn&#39;t a hard decision to make at all. Today had already been beyond her expectations, and she loved every moment of it too. She had cum gallons of food for the girls over the course of their trip, and had sucked even more milk from her own tits. It all felt so amazing too.<br />
<br />
Lexi, who was still set within her special spot in the limo, would be going home one last time to get her things. A courtesy granted to her only after she begged Monica to let her at least grab something extremely important. Monica had insisted that the agency would move her for her, but she wouldn&#39;t budge. There was no way she would ever trust the Chronivac to someone else&#39;s handling, even if said person were her best friend.<br />
<br />
After packing the Chronivac into a bag and set up both a password and a way for her to access it remotely. Once she was all packed back inside the limo, the driver brought her and Monica to the Model house, where she would be living from today onwards. <br />
<br />
As Lexi entered the home, she was surprised to find that it was a little different than the old normal. For one, there was no such thing as a kitchen in this reality. But also, there was a padded frame installed in just about every social room. Lexi understood that these frames were for her to be placed inside of and hooked up to the numerous feeding tubes installed around each room.<br />
<br />
She finally understood for the first time that she was different from the others on a fundamental level. She wasn&#39;t beneath them socially speaking, but she was kinda used more like an appliance than a person. Though she understood the mentality behind everything, so she didn&#39;t mind it being this way whatsoever. <br />
<br />
Actually, being treated as an appliance had a certain kinky appeal to it. Like a coffee maker that people would fuck occasionally and could talk to. Maybe she would have to play around with this later? <br />
<br />
Lexi was shown around the house, and was told the basic schedule of the women living here. It was pretty straightforward too. Breakfast at 8am, dinner at 7pm. Anything else was up to the individual to seek her out themselves. She did have 1 rule however. As she was the food source of 8, she wouldn&#39;t be allowed to remain home by herself. She would need at least another person in the house with her, or accompany the models to their work location. Lexi didn&#39;t mind this at all either, as she couldn&#39;t imagine not being their to feed her consumers. If she didn&#39;t cum for them, then who would?<br />
<br />
The tour ended and they joined up with the other 7 models who were all watching TV. Upon entering the room, the other girls turned to look at Lexi with surprise. &quot;Oh! So you accepted!&quot; Realized one of the girls. Lexi nodded and they had a mini celebration. It was the first time Lexi ever brought the food to her own celebration that someone else was throwing for her.<br />
<br />
After the fun, one of the models, a redhead named Kaylee, approached Lexi. &quot;Hey Lexi, I have to know. What&#39;s it like having backwards knees?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lexi paused for a moment, unsure how to answer. She couldn&#39;t think of any real way to describe it. &quot;I guess, it feels normal to me? I don&#39;t really know how to answer this. How does it feel to have front facing knees? Pretend I didn&#39;t have them for several years before becoming an adult. How would you answer the question?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee pondered for a while, but like Lexi, couldn&#39;t come up with anything. So Lexi just shrugged. &quot;It feels normal. I can walk, run, do everything you can for the most part. The only reason why all feeders have their knees reverse is simply to make more room for our massive balls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee nodded at this, and  although she still didn&#39;t really get an answer to her question, she was satisfied with the response. Lexi relaxed back in her frame that she has been standing within for the past few hours. One of the plus sides to being a feeder is that her body never get tired from standing. However, she still liked to lean against the padded back of her frame. And the ring holding her cock straight allowed her to do it since her dick was long enough for it. <br />
<br />
She was still on edge to cum at any moment someone sucked on one of the many tubes throughout the room that connected into her urethral insert. And it was a pleasent feeling too. Unlike having blueballs, this was a warm and good feeling, and not cramped or pressured at all. It was actually relaxing, knowing that at any second, she would be made to orgasm in order to feed one if her girls.<br />
<br />
She became flushed in the face as she was suddenly forced to have yet another orgasm, pumping a fresh mouthful through the tubes and into Monica&#39;s mouth who was sitting on the couch watching TV. She just had a tube in her mouth and would occasionally give it a suck. Several of the other girls were doing a similar thing too. And so at a rate of one orgasm per around 10 seconds, Lexi spent the remainder of the movie in bliss.<br />
<br />
One thing she was curious about is how claimed feeders spend their nights. Her consumers would all be sleeping in a few hours, leaving her wide awake and alone. And due to her condition, she couldn&#39;t just drain her balls to stop herself from having infinite stamina as she produced her own milk, thus ensuring she never would be completely out of cum.<br />
<br />
So, with plenty of time on her hands, Lexi decided that tonight could be her chance to <i>customize</i> the appearances of 8 models.</p>
