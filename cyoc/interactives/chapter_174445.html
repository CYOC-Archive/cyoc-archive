<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Being turned into a female was interesting, especially seeing that reality had adjusted to match.  But it was only a means to an end.  Jeff returned to the &quot;Other Person&#39;s Anatomy&quot; option on the Chronivac, and excitedly clicked on the &quot;vagina&quot; option.  Earlier, this provided him with two options: his little sister (the one person who had a vagina in range of the scanner), or random person somewhere in the world.  Becoming his little sister&#39;s vagina was beyond creepy.  And he didn&#39;t wanna risk becoming the vagina of someone he didn&#39;t know; what if he were treated poorly, or became a vagina just in time for child birth?  But now that he was female himself, the scanner had added him to the list of options.  Yet he wondered, how would the Chronivac interpret becoming his own vagina?<br />
<br />
As he selected himself, a message popped up, answering his question.  &quot;Failsafe: Current settings would leave host body without a conciousness.  To prevent this, target&#39;s conciousness will be duplicated between host body and selected anatomy.&quot;<br />
<br />
So this meant that, when Jeff becomes his own vagina, a copy of his conciousness would still be in control of the 18-year-old body he currently occupies.  At first, he thought the scenario was perfect.  Who could he trust more to be his host, than himself?  But then he realized, from his perspective, he could wind up being the host, while a copy of his conciousness resided in his vagina.  Which means it wouldn&#39;t be him that was enjoying the transformation, but his copy.<br />
<br />
Closing the alert, Jeff noticed more options had popped up.  The first was &quot;Awareness&quot;.  He could make it so the host was unaware that he had duplicated his own conciousness into his vagina.  The thought did excite him a little.  This meant that his vagina self would be treated as just a normal vagina, rather than a person.  However, this being his first time as a vagina, he&#39;d want his host self to handle his vagina self with extra care, and knowing that his vagina is a person would help ensure that.  Beyond that, what would his host self do if he didn&#39;t know his vagina was a person?  Would he try duplicating himself again?  He wasn&#39;t sure how that would work out, so to be safe, he decided to keep his host self aware.<br />
<br />
The next option that had popped up was &quot;Telepathy&quot;.  This would allow both of his conciousnesses to communicate with each other telepathically.  Jeff considered this.  If he enabled this, his vagina self would be able to let his host self know if anything is wrong, whether his vagina self wanted to change back or felt he needed to be treated better.  But in this case, he wasn&#39;t sure he liked the idea of having himself speaking in his own head the whole time.  So he disabled this option.<br />
<br />
Next up, &quot;Senses&quot;.  Sight, hearing, touch, smell, taste.  Sight and hearing would be handled psychically, given that his vagina would have no eyes or ears.  Jeff decided that if he was going to be a proper vagina, he&#39;d disable those senses.  Touch?  It was strange there was an option to disable that.  Of course he wanted to be able to feel his transformation.  Smell and taste were by far the most interesting options.  He disabled the former.  He wouldn&#39;t be able to cover his nose if he disliked his own smell, not to mention the scent of hovering over a toilet bowl.  And with that thought, taste would not only mean tasting himself, but also when he&#39;s used to go to the bathroom.  He wasn&#39;t sure he wanted to experience that sort of flavor.  However, there was a part of him that was curious about that.  As a vagina, it wouldn&#39;t exactly be an unhealthy experience.  But at the same time, it wouldn&#39;t necessarily be an enjoyable one.  Uncertain what he wanted to do, he decided to set Taste to &quot;Random&quot;, allowing the Chronivac to decide for him.  And, while he was at it, he went back to Smell and set that to &quot;Random&quot; as well.<br />
<br />
The final option was &quot;Duration&quot;.  He was already familiar with this option, having turned himself into a female.  With this option, the Chronivac could undo the transformation automatically after a set period of time, or the transformation would have to be undone manually.  When becoming female, he had set the option to &quot;Indefinite&quot;, meaning he&#39;d have to change himself back manually.  But by default, the duration was set to &quot;5 Minutes&quot;.  This was intended as a test period for the transformee.<br />
<br />
Before deciding on the duration, Jeff noticed there was a message under the option.  &quot;When reverting the transformation, all duplicated conciousnesses, and the memories of each, will merge back into a single conciousness, occupying the host body.&quot;<br />
<br />
If Jeff was understanding this correctly, this meant that even if he found himself as the host, he&#39;d gain the memories of his vagina self as soon as it was brought back to his head.  But was remembering his time as a vagina a good replacement for actually experiencing it?<br />
<br />
Looking again at the &quot;Duration&quot; option, he decided that 5 minutes was too short.  He also decided not to set the time to &quot;Indefinite&quot;.  While he knew he could trust his host self to change his vagina self back eventually, he wanted to make that decision now, while he was still fully capable.  So, he set the duration to 24 hours.<br />
<br />
It was 4:18 pm right now.  So this meant that until 4:18 pm tomorrow, he&#39;d be living one of two lives.  One life would be that of an 18-year-old girl.  The other, the girl&#39;s vagina.  His host self would be fully aware that a copy of himself was living as his vagina.  His vagina self would be without sight and hearing, but would still feel; and, depending on the Chronivac&#39;s random choice, would possibly retain the ability to smell or taste, possibly both, or neither.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, Jeff excitedly (yet somewhat nervously) hit the &quot;Confirm&quot; button.  He feels a brief sense of dizziness, as his conciousness is duplicated between host and vagina.  Which conciousness do we follow?</p>
