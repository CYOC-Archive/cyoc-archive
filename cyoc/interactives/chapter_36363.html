<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>Ron didn't wait too long as that typical breakfast food just sounded to be what the doctor had ordered. "Greg, I will have the Bearish Man's Platter!"</Br>
<Br>"Sounds like a good deal, you are a man who knows to ask and then knows what he wants!</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, I can be a butt but I am good at knowing what I want when I hear it. Oh! I will also take the toast with white bread and my eggs to be over medium."</Br>
<Br>"Excellent! I will be back with your food shortly!"</Br>
<Br>As Greg turned around and headed toward what was thought to be the kitchen area to turn in the long awaited order, Zach stared at Ron with a semi-evil glare.</Br>
<Br>"What Zach? What is the matter?"</Br>
<Br>"You know... I don't know why it is that you feel you need to give everyone of our waiting staff at restaurants such guff. I can't believe you made him stand there and wait on you. I am glad you came to a decision as quickly as you did. Lord knows that you usually take forever, just to see if the waiter or waitress will crack and tell you that they are just trying to up sales or something along those lines."</Br>
<Br>"Hey... don't give me that! You know what happened the last time I gave someone this type of treatment... remember, they broke down and told me the truth then gave me a discount because of their deceitful tactics."</Br>
<Br>"That is true, but this guy was really nice and friendly. Most of those others were hard-ballers, were somewhat deserving of that treatment. I just hope that you are going to give him a better tip than you usually do!"</Br>
<Br>"I probably will because you are right, Greg seems like an honest and genuine guy."</Br>
<Br>"That's a relief to hear!"</Br>
<Br>"So Zach, tell me something... why did you jump on the first choice so quickly when he was giving a great deal on that piece of meat?"</Br>
<Br>"Well... to be honest... his old self sounds just like me, for the most part. I mean look at me! The best I can do is grow a very thin mustache, slight stubble for a beard and no matter how hard I work at it, I can only build lean muscle. I want to be like him Ron, a hulking mass of MAN... you know?"</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, I guess I can understand since I was like that for a while myself, that was until my big development stage happened at sixteen. I know at the moment, I could use an improvement in my physical shape, but I have a hit a stalemate and I could use a kick. If this is the food that is going to do it, like it did for him, then so be it!"</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, you always were the lucky one. I remember you could have anyone you wanted in school and I barely got a date for Senior prom. Now we are both twenty-five, single and looking... not to mention we pretty much look the way we have for several years. If this platter of food is going to be the catalyst to look like Greg and like you probably will turn out, then that is the way for me!"</Br>
<Br>Ron chuckled, then his attention perked as the smell of hot food was in the air, wafting toward them. Greg was holding a large circular dish tray that held both their meals and the special sauce they made, while syrups for Zach's pancakes hung off the side of the large man's apron. As Greg placed the food in front of the pair, he didn't utter a single moan or groan that was common with other waiting staff from ridding themselves of such a great weight.</Br>
<Br>When Greg finished, he pointed toward the special sauce with an open meaty hand, which they both noticed was slightly meatier with longer, sharper looking fingernails. If they weren't mistaken, his whole hand, forearm and exposed area of his chest was slightly more manly and hairy. Thinking they were just seeing things, their attention focused back on the task at hand.</Br>
<Br>"There you are gentlemen, your food as you both ordered and our special sauce as I mentioned. Don't be afraid to pour gobs of it all over your food no matter how much you may want to taste things the way they are, especially since the sauce goes with everything and enhances the flavors twice as much without it."</Br>
<Br>Ron and Zach just shrugged, thanking Greg and then he was on his way to serve others, but promised that he would be back later to check up on how everything was going. Curious about the taste of the sauce, Zach went first and poured a drop on his finger, just as a test so not to ruin his meal. Tasting it, he tasted pretty much nothing at all, but then decided to pour just a drop on his piece of bacon. Tasting that, his eyes lit up like the fourth of July and he began pouring loads of it over everything.</Br>
<Br>Astounded by Zach's behavior, Ron tried a drop on his sausage link and found the same exact result. The flavor of the meat was intensified twice as much as it would have been normally. Ron loaded the rest of his platter with the sauce, emptying it out completely.</Br>
<Br>Before they both knew it, their platters were empty, the second glasses of beer was empty and they both sat back in their chairs in a lounging fashion as they picked up their third glass of the brew. As they both sipped on the beer, they realized that even that flavor was intensified even though they didn't add any to the beer. Thinking it was just remnants on their tongues, they continued to sip away and relax.</Br>
<Br>Just as they finished their last glass of brew, Greg returned to check up on the both of them, seeing that things had gone well.</Br>
<Br>"Well, I see that you both pretty much enjoyed yourselves!"</Br>
<Br>Both of them just nodded, too stuffed to say much at all.</Br>
<Br>"I also see that our special blend of food, beer and sauce has already began to take it's effect on you two. This is good... as you two will be joining the family soon!"</Br>
<Br>Confused by what he meant, they were both about to ask him the same question, when they both saw more changes in Greg and themselves. Greg just stood there with a smile on his face, which was quickly changing into something inhuman. They watched in marvel as his body underwent an astounding metamorphosis. His hands changed into bear paws, his body hair changed into a thick and dark brown fur, his muscles bulked out rapidly with his clothes tearing slightly at certain seams allowing his fur to poke through, his face pushed out into a bearish muzzle, his ears migrated to the top of his head while rounding out and shrinking slightly, the fur on his actual muzzle turned blonde with a large streak running down his throat and onto his chest, his legs and feet did the same thing with his claws extending shredding through his shoes. Then most unexpectedly, a very large bulge formed in his pants, causing the button to pop off and fly towards the two in the beginnings of their changes, allowing a slight amount of his thick shaft to show.</Br>
<Br>Their eyes were wide, not knowing what really just happened there, thinking the alcohol was playing tricks on them, while they just stared at what was visible and barely visible on Greg.</Br>
<Br>Speaking with a deeper, gruffer and more manly voice, Greg shocked the two and had to repeat himself. "So... you two like what you see here with me?"</Br>
<Br>They just nodded.</Br>
<Br>"Good... how about with this?" He asked while he grabbed his junk, adjusting himself so they could get a look.</Br>
<Br>Both sat there transfixed by it, staring and as their whole faces and mouths changed, they licked their slight maws with their slobbering tongues, feeling their slightly sharper teeth. Greg just chuckled, knowing what the answer without words, just as he had been when he first ate there and he changed. Greg wondered just how much like him that they were and decided to try something out.</Br>
<Br>Since they were at a place where only men could come and everyone there was like Greg, as they had changed for the new men they just served, Greg grabbed his pants and opened them wider, allowing his thick piece of meat to stick out freely; dripping with his naturally thick clear juices. Greg placed a bearish finger on the tip, wiping some of the fluid onto it. He then brought it to their new maws and blackened noses, letting them smell his essence, then quickly brought it to his maw and cleaned the fluid off with just his longer, flattened and wide tongue. Ron and Zach leaned in closer to his cock to get a taste, snaking each of their tongues to the tip of the large mushroom head and as the fluid pooled onto the tips of their tongues, they instantly tasted the sweet fluid while wanting more. Just as they were about to dive on his cock, their changes happened quickly, shredding all of their clothes and leaving them completely in their new, naked and bear forms. Greg just chuckled, held his meat back and had to decide what his next move was.</Br></p>
