<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Midnight, the once Janine, looked up at her tormentor, her struggles and attempts to yell quieted for now, Rhianna having spent the past few minutes sketching something out on a piece of notebook paper and looking like she was deciding on something. Face furled up in concentration, the magical cheerleader seems to have hit on something she's pleased with, walking over to Midnight with a brilliant smile on her face.  &quot;the goths are a bit freaky, everyone picks on the loners, but what we don't have in the school is a real freak of nature; something everyone can look down on.  That someone'll be you.  Nothing ugly, just weird, but I think you'd be perfect for it.&quot; Midnight's face falling even more as she tries to big, her voice coming out in tiny whispers that are ignored by Rhianna.  &quot;I mean, as is, you can always just say you're pale or something, but this, I don't think you'll ever be able to hide.&quot; she doesn't sound cruel, just pleased. &quot;Now, why don't we start with a few things. &quot;I have smaller than A cup breasts and am underdeveloped, short, and young looking for my age.&quot;&quot; <br />
<br />
Midnight's voice follows the cheerleader's words, her shirt growing baggy on her as she starts to shrink, smaller and smaller, waist shrinking, hips and shoulders too, her entire body looking more and more like that of someone who never blossomed.  Her eyes, widening as she stares on, watches as her lips get a little poutier, face gaining a touch of baby fat, looking a bit younger though still certainly her age, just someone that the puberty train passed by, leaving them at the station.  Within a few moments she's barely 4'10, slight and tiny, her too large clothing like a tent over her, skirt having fallen down.  <br />
<br />
Rhianna claps a little, cooing as she continues to run her hands through Midnight's hair.  &quot;You. Look. So. CUTE! Maybe I won't keep you as the school freak.&quot; She looks thoughtful.  &quot;Mmm, maybe though, school freak or mascot but loved.&quot; A few moments.  &quot;Mmmm, shall I be nice or mean?~&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nice! Please, I beg of you Miss Rhianna&quot; Midnight didn't intend to use Miss in there, but it slipped out, &quot;do not cause me more torments!&quot; tears shining in her crimson eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm, nice.  I think we'll do that! How's this, &quot;I have a unique genetic disease which stops my visible and actual aging and results in both no longer requiring biological functions, immunity to health problems and appropriate organic coverings which resemble in every way appropriate clothing.&quot;&quot; She looks proud of herself for that, maybe for the use of &quot;biological&quot; terms; seems she was paying attention.<br />
<br />
Midnight's eyes widen, some in terror, some in sudden...it's not arousal, it's...almost something better, like her very body is shifting in some weird but right way.  Her breath stops, she can feel her lungs stop working, their functions no longer necessary except to let her speak as her heart shuts down.  She coughs, or tries to, but nothing comes out as she can feel something at her neck, her once clothing unraveling to nothing as a leather looking black choker forms, skintight yet she can feel the air on it.  As she watches, her fingers seem to grow a little longer, nails sharper as a pair of black silk gloves, fingerless, seem to sprout from her hands, blotchy patches of liquid emerging from pores that no longer exist, forming a perfect skintight set of gloves, clad up to her upper arms where they vanish into a forming dress.  A few moments of staring at her hands means that Midnight misses how her shoulders are growing out, hard bone-type protrusions on them forming shoulderpads, covering themselves in the black silk that is her new &quot;skin&quot;, white streams of lace feathering down her tight arm pieces, covering the &quot;arm warmers&quot; she finds herself stuck with.  As she looks, a tight black bodice firms up, corset tightening even though it doesn't show anything off, her lack of breath helping her survive the tightness without any discomfort, another silk layer forming over this one, rows and rows of frills pushing their way out, itchy on the ropes as nerves connect.  On her back, she can feel a few lovely ribbons forming, tying themselves into an overlarge bow at the base of her back, tails hanging down low, the connecting nerves giving her some control over them into her changing brain.  Looking down at her feet, Midnight notices how her shoes are...gone.  Replaced by delicate high heeled shoes, they're platforms, giving her a little bit of height as some sort of rubber pushes out of her feet, toes subsumed by the rounded front, pretty white ties on the top of the tongue, right where her foot would meet her ankle.  Sliding up her legs come the pantyhose, covering her once naked bits in perfect and tough black silk, unable to be removed; even if they could, she would lack any sort of organs or openings there.  As a final touch, the dress seems to complete itself, a long skirt flowing down to below Midnight's knees, black and frilly as more and more layers seem to add themselves, pushing the entire apparatus up a little as she feels the changes finish.  Her tears, once falling, stop, eyes dry as she stops producing water.  <br />
<br />
Rhianna's eyes light up as she tugs lightly on the twin-ponytails that Midnight's found herself with, tied up with white ribbons that trail down through her ebon and purple locks to her knees, giving her an even more childish look.  &quot;You look SO CUTE!&quot; giggling as the...gothic being tries to cry, speak, do anything, her little mouth emitting tiny scared sounds, sounds that grow in urgency as she feels fangs with her tongue.  &quot;I think, we're going to set you loose with one final command.&quot;<br />
<br />
Midnight shakes her head, trying to beg otherwise, &quot;N-no...please...I-I do not wish this...I do not wish to be this.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm, so ungrateful!&quot; Rhianna's voice made it clear to Midnight that no matter what she did, she'd have been ordered to say this, &quot;I was thinking of just letting you and everyone else think this was normal, but, I think we're going to do something differently.  Now repeat after me, &quot;I've been a little gothic freak as long as I can remember and no one finds this unusual. I act as the school's mascot and every year's head cheerleader keeps me as a &quot;class pet&quot; until I'm passed off to the next one.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
Midnight's eyes widen as her mouth begins to work, voice speaking as....Midnight looks about, confused.  She's at her desk; one of the joys of being at a school, she can learn, the cell phone Miss Rhianna gave her buzzing a little, as if telling her that her keeper for the year was finished with practice.  Her gloved hands working it open, she gives an unneeded sigh.  Sometimes she wonders what it'd be like to grow older, wear true clothes, but, according to everyone, doing so is unladylike and if there is nothing Midnight cannot stand, it is uncouth behavior.  Gathering her things, the races out to the practice field where both the team and her keeper are waiting, content, for now, with her lot in life.</p>
