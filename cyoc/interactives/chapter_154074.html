<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Liam... I... Like... I like you&quot; Kyle stumbled along his emotions, letting the moment take over &quot;I always thought of you as more than just my best friend. You&#39;ve always been there for me when I needed it. You were the only one who stayed here right now! You&#39;ve always been so... Special to me... I can&#39;t even begin to say how much happiness and joy you&#39;ve brought into my life, and only hope that I can at least give that back to you in double. Because... Because I love you, Liam. I really, really love you. Always had. Always will. I just hope you&#39;re the same... Or at the very least, we can keep...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle was silenced as Liam&#39;s arms wrapped around him and their lips touched. Kyle melted as Liam pulled him even closer, their tongues twisting and dancing in their kiss, and their cocks rubbing each other through their pants. A tear rolled down Liam&#39;s face, and Kyle was lucky to see it happen before closing his eyes again to enjoy everything he always wanted to do and more. But before it could go on, Kyle moved away for a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before you go on... You know what the curse will do to me, right? I&#39;ll be... I&#39;ll be fucked by every goddamn person in this city. I&#39;ll become a cum slut, and all those... Horrible things... You still wanna... Go on with this?&quot; Kyle looked at Liam in the eyes, water pouring from them &quot;Kyle, having you was something I could only dream about minutes ago. I&#39;m just so overwhelmed by all of this. I don&#39;t care about the curse. I don&#39;t care about anything anymore. Hell, you could maybe even curse me with the same shit and I&#39;d still join you and we&#39;d be the biggest fucking sluts in this planet!&quot; They both laughed &quot;Besides, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m not from this city, much less that everybody needs to be fucking you at the same time all the time. I&#39;ll just have to... Monopolize you for as long as I can. Or maybe I WILL INDEED join you! The important thing is: I love you. I love you, I love you, I love you, and nothing could change that. Nothing. Ever. Ever. Ever.&quot; Liam pulled him close to another kiss. This time, his hands slowly passed through Kyle&#39;s whole body, feeling every single part of his neck, his chest muscles, his arms, slightly defined abdomen, butt, hips and finally reaching his cock. He then began stroking it gently, causing Kyle to do the same to him, and pulling his body closer to him than ever. Both moaned without parting the kiss still.<br />
<br />
Kyle could feel some of the effects of the curse in action: His own cock already felt a little bit bigger than he remembered, his butt was somewhat softer, and his mind was racing at the thought of sucking his cock, or maybe letting him fuck his ass mercilessly. This only made his cock twitch and get even harder and now substantially bigger.<br />
<br />
Liam could feel Kyle begining to act more... Giving towards him, as Liam dominated their kiss, his tongue circling around his lover&#39;s mouth, and feeling his grasp on Kyle&#39;s cock more secure and taking this as an cue to move a little faster. He quickly moved his hands after a while to Kyle&#39;s butt, which felt smother and more jiggly. He grabbed it with intensity and then procceded to remove his pants and underwear, freeing his cock. <br />
<br />
Kyle was already moaning loudly at this point. His cock was very sensitive, and Liam&#39;s touch couldn&#39;t possibly feel more right, as he caressed his shaft and balls with and dexterity and softness he had never experienced before. He&#39;d be sure to remember that for later. Kyle undid the buttons and ziper on Liam&#39;s pants and dropped all down, effectively making him half naked as well. Liam&#39;s hypnotizing cock was almost starring at him, as his mouth became wet and he panted, rapidly coming back to stroke and caress and feel it as much as he could.<br />
<br />
&quot;... You&#39;re liking this, don&#39;t you, bitch?&quot; Liam timidly whispered in Kyle&#39;s ear. &quot;You wanna suck it right? Go ahead. Suck it like a little whore that you are!&quot; Kyle lost his self control, as he barely dropped to the ground, and engulfed the cock in his mouth. It felt even bigger than it looked. The taste of precum imediatlly filled his mouth, and it was already divine. For that he was really glad, as he wanted to take in as much as he could. He found he really could do that, as he was having no problems with gag reflex or teeth or anything.<br />
<br />
He swirled his tongue around the head and along the shaft, and giving a licking to his ball sack. He then started moving it inside his mouth, the head first and going deeper each time. As he sucked and licked and kissed, he gave sexy, slutty looks to Liam, who was moaning like crazy. Liam then put his hand on Kyle&#39;s head and started pushing in and out, each time deeper and faster and with more force than the last. Kyle moaned with a cockfull in his mouth, as Liam&#39;s cock was easily 8 inches, one of the biggest he&#39;d ever seen, even in porn. He proceeded to follow his new master&#39;s command and, with one swift move and thrust, deepthroated, reaching even his balls. He felt the head reaching deep in his throat and he loved it. Liam screamed in pleasure, unable to control himself, and pulled Kyle&#39;s hair. He forced him to do this again a few more times before allowing him to breathe (although Kyle seemed to have basically no need for air as well, he would rather continue deepthroating).<br />
<br />
Kyle took this moment as an advantage and pulled out the sexiest, sluttiest moan and look he could possibly muster, and the result was fenomenal. He could sense the cum traveling from his aching balls to his cock and then flying into his mouth and face. It was warm and very thick, and while most of it landed in his face, the part of it that fell directly into his mouth made a small pool, which he proudly showed, tasted and swallowed. It really was delicious, in fact, he could see himself only eating that from then on. It functioned as an aphrodisiac as his cock somehow got even harder, and his arousal only grew...</p>
