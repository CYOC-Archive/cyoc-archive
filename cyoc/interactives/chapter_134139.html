<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rachael stood up and tried to get her bearings. It wasn&#39;t easy considering she had just turned into some kind of horse woman and was quite literally dripping with arousal. <br />
<br />
Rachael was on the edge of town. It looked like there was a run down farm not too much further out and a small plaza a short distance back the way she came. It was very late, close to midnight in fact, and there was no way that anyone helpful was going to be in that plaza. Just then a light flickered on in the old farm house down the road. Rachael reasoned that she had a better chance of getting help from whoever was out there than any of the shady individuals that might be hanging around the slum behind her. She might even get lucky and whoever lives out there might have a truck she could get a ride in. She knew she wasn&#39;t going to fit back in her car given her new mass and frame. Having made up her mind, Rachael began walking further out of town, towards the old farm house.<br />
<br />
Rachael stumbled uneasily on her unfamiliar hooves. She wasn&#39;t used to them yet. Even with her powerful new legs, she couldn&#39;t quite keep steady. The further she walked the better her balance became though, and after about half an hour of walking she felt pretty confident on her new hooves. She even gave running a try and found that she could now set a blistering pace without really trying. So she did. Rachael took off down the road towards the house. She was desperate to get back to Mike. It wasn&#39;t an option. Her loins demanded release. As she ran, she could hear the tell tale *clip-clop* of her hooves pounding the asphalt. Her tail swished back and forth in time with her steps. She could feel a new energy coursing through her body, turning her pent up desire into fuel for her massive legs. She felt amazing, like she could run forever or lift a bus. For the moment, she was completely in tune with her new body and senses. Before she knew it she had reached the driveway of the old farm house. The light that she had seen earlier was out again and the house looked dark and foreboading. Against her better judgment, Rachael knocked on the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it NOW?!&quot; A voice bellowed from somewhere inside the house. &quot;I already told you to get lost you drunk!&quot; As soon as Rachael had knocked her mood had changed to a  timid apprehension. she could hear movement start to accompany the angry yelling but she couldn&#39;t muster up the courage to actually speak. She just stood nervously outside the door hoping this man would take pitty on her. The porch light flickered on and she tried to think of something to say but nothing came to mind. Rachael heard the man mutter a few more things under his breath before the handle started rotating and the door unlatched.<br />
<br />
Opening the door was a rather angry looking young man with brown hair and an unshaven face. The man was thin but not skinny. He was wearing a loose shirt and boxers.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the...&quot; The man almost whispered before fainting in a heap on the ground.<br />
<br />
Rachael just stood there. This was not what she expected, a scream, maybe even the door slamming in her face, but not this. It was then that Rachael noticed a peculiar scent. She had never noticed it before but she knew exactly what it was. It was a male. Rachael&#39;s oversized nostrils flared wide as she breathed deeply. The smell was intoxicating and began to stir up her arousal once more. Her mound, which had been slowly calming down due to her previous nerves, instantly flushed out new juices. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh!&quot; Rachael blushed. &quot;I feel so warm. What&#39;s going on with me? I&#39;ve never been this turned on in my life!&quot; Rachael felt tingles all over herself. She walked closer to the doorway where the man lay. Her nose perked up again catching a whiff of her own scent being wafted from her moist sex by her tail. Rachael got down on all fours and approached the passed out stranger. As she started reaching for his hand to try and wake him she noticed his boxers were beginning to tent up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooo! What&#39;s this?&quot; Asked Rachael, somewhat surprised. &quot;Did I do that? Hmmm, I&#39;m feeling like Mike is going to have to wait. I need this. I need his, need his...&quot; Rachael trailed off she could barely think straight as she reached over and lowered the man&#39;s boxers. His cock sprung up with the removal of his undergarments. She took his length in her altered hand. Rachael smiled, It was rock hard. Her pheromones were working marvelously to keep him fully erect. Slowly Rachael leaned over his manhood and drank in his scent. She could now smell his arousal as it pushed her into sexual overdrive.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Mike...&quot; She whispered right before giving the man&#39;s dick a long deliberate lick. Slowly and methodically she lubricated his entire shaft with her saliva. She placed the tip of his shaft in her mouth and enveloped it with her horse like mouth. She had lost all self control at this point. She couldn&#39;t stop herself from pleasuring the man and her long horse like snout enabled her to take him deeper than she&#39;d ever been able to take anyone before. She moved her rear end around to position her crease above the strangers face. Subconsciously she hoped that her proximity would encourage him to return the favor. However he was still unconscious and, unfortunately for her, unable to reciprocate. Rachael didn&#39;t know it, but her entrance was dripping right into the man&#39;s slack jawed mouth. If he were awake he would&#39;ve been able to feel Rachael&#39;s coarse tongue rubbing and coaxing his shaft to the point of pure bliss. As Rachael stroked up and down the length of his cock she noticed that she seemed to be going further with each pass. She paused and looked down to see that what used to be the man&#39;s average sized dick, was now about two times bigger and still growing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh YES!&quot; Rachael exclaimed, excited to finally have something that looked like it could get her off. Rachael excitedly moved to straddle the man&#39;s crotch. She watched in amazement as fur started sprouting from the man&#39;s groin and spread up and down the rest of his body. Just like when she had changed, the muscles underneath his new fur grew large and pronounced. Rachael couldn&#39;t believe it, she was actually getting more worked up by watching the man&#39;s transformation. With each new patch of fur or swelling mass of flesh the more moisture surged out of her slit. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is exactly what I need.&quot; Rachael gasped as she impaled herself on his prick. &quot;Aaaaah! YES!&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then the man&#39;s eyes fluttered open.<br />
<br />
Rachael froze, it was hard for her to tell what he was thinking. The man looked surprised and confused. Rachael slowly started to pump his shaft again hoping the pleasure would goad him to succumb to his more primal urges. She watched as he tried to put all of the pieces together and make sense of what was going on. The man rolled his eyes as he gave up trying to make sense of the situation. &quot;Fuck it.&quot; He said and thrust wildly into Rachael trying to keep time with her rhythm. Rachael felt a massive orgasm begin to build. She watched while the stranger&#39;s chest broadened and grew with fur and strength. The changes spread out towards his extremities. His legs snapped and reformed. Sinew, meat and tendons grew and shifted under Rachael and she knew his legs had taken on an unguligrade stance. The man didn&#39;t seem to care or notice though, he was lost in the feelings of euphoria washing over and through his body. He reached up to feel his lovers taut skin and short fur. He moved his deforming hands up from Rachael&#39;s shredded abdomen, to her sizable chest. He cupped her breasts and teased her dark firm nipples. New waves of pleasure radiated out from Rachael&#39;s bosom. She knew it wouldn&#39;t be long before she finally came. She looked up and closed her eyes, letting herself be completely consumed by the bliss rolling throught her altered body. The man&#39;s face began to pull forward and get longer. His nostrils widened and his ears grew long and pointed. His tongue fell out of his open mouth as he thrust one last time into Rachael. <br />
<br />
&quot;Neeeeeigh!&quot; They both cried out in unison cuming together in a shared experience of ecstasy. Rachael collapsed on top of the stranger and they both drifted off to a much needed sleep.</p>
