<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle&#39;s son Erik was behind him trying to hide from Loki. He has 6 years old and as he was the page boy of the wedding he was wearing a small tuxedo like the one his father had a few moments ago.<br />
<br />
When Loki turned the broomsmen into strippers they became almost naked so his father&#39;s pants that Erik was holding dissapeared and he was hugging his toned leg instead. He had seen his father without shirt and pants before in the beach, but he wasn&#39;t muscled then like he was now. He looked like a superhero with all those muscled in his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Erik, stay behind me.&quot; Kyle whispered to his son<br />
<br />
&quot;Now we have all these strippers, lets begin the party!&quot; Loki said and with a finger snap, erotic music started to play from nowhere. &quot;Guys, show me what are capable of do!&quot;<br />
<br />
Like if they were hypnotized by the music, the new strippers started to dance sensually. They can&#39;t control their bodies except for their head that were red in embarrassment. Kyle was trying to ignore the impulse to dance but Loki&#39;s magic was so strong that he started to dance shaking his butt. Then he turned around and continued shaking while he showed his now perfect bubbled butt to Loki.<br />
<br />
&quot;Erik, run!&quot; He said to his son, but Erik was distracted by the unusual movements that his father was doing. His little thong didn&#39;t hide his now enlarged bulge and that meaty thing was shaking in front of Erik&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do we have there?&quot; Loki said when he saw Erik paralyzed in front of his dancing father. &quot;It seems like if the kid wants to play too!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave him alone, you monster!&quot; Kyle shouted. That makes Loki angry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I had the intention to get a junior stripper.&quot; Loki said. &quot;But as I see you love him so much, I will help you to be closer!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Erik, run! now!&quot; Kyle said but because of his funny movements Erik can&#39;t take him seriously.<br />
<br />
&quot;These will be a three acts performance!&quot; Loki said. &quot;First one: the man!&quot;<br />
<br />
Erik felt a sudden pain in his body which make him to writhe in pain. His small body was growing too fast as he grew to an adult body. His hands and feets become bigger as his torso, arms and legs. In a matter of seconds, the little tuxedo can&#39;t hold his new size and bursted into a lot of tiny pieces leaving Erik naked. He grew like a regular man, with some hair on his hands and legs, a small beard and a few hairs on his chest. The most interesting thing was the growing bulge in his now little withey tighty which was an average size too. When Erik reached a twenties aspect, his small underwear finally gave up and his dick was revealed to the audience. Now, instead of a little 6 years old boy, there was a twenty something years old young man naked among dancing strippers. Erik looked like almost identical to his father which now could be around the same age.<br />
<br />
&quot;A good growing you had, boy... er, man&quot; Loki said. &quot;But now it&#39;s time for the act two! The hunk!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then, Erik began to feel another pain in his body. A sudden dose of testosterone had entered Erik&#39;s body. His average adult body began to grow muscles all over the places, in his chest, his arms, his legs. He now looked like a bodybuilder, with a lot of muscles.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you wouldn&#39;t be able to dance well if you have too much muscles...&quot; Loki said and Erik body reduced a little until he looked toned with a decent muscle body but nothing too extreme. &quot;And I&#39;m not forgetting the most important thing!&quot; Then Erik average dick started to swell like if Loki was blowing it as a balloon. His dick grew until he reached a soft ten inches monster with a pair of ball to match.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally, say goodbye to your son.&quot; Loki said to Kyle. &quot;And said hello to the new member of your strip team! Three! The stripper!&quot;<br />
<br />
A black curtain appeared from the sky and it covered Erik adult body. After some weird shaking, the curtain went up revealing a young man, well muscled and very hot with a stripper suit like the other guys in the place. His body hair vanished and he got an oiled and tanned skin. His big dick was covered in an apparently small thong and he was barefoot leaving his big feet to everybody sight. Erik was shocked by his transformation and didn&#39;t move. But Loki snapped his fingers and Erik began to move his body like the other stripper was doing. He was becoming closer to his father, who now looked smaller than him. Then, they began to dance together in a unusual stripper sensual dance. Both were unable to control themselves as they were at Loki&#39;s mercy who was laughing uncontrollably while he was seeing the show.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s next?!&quot; Loki said while he was looking for another victim.</p>
