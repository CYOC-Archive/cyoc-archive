<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Max sat at the computer that night with the Chronivac program open again, he couldn&#39;t stop thinking about the young furrys playing at the park such energy he wanted to experience it to live it. Yes he had experienced childhood as a human but he wanted to do it as a furry but not forever. He set his age to 7 years same for his friends human and furry he also adjusted reality to match so no one would be surprised slammed the enter key he stripped down and waited wagging his tail excitedly.<br />
     Jeff felt himself shrinking slightly as Max&#39;s body regressed around him, he felt Max&#39;s teeth change into children&#39;s he floped sloppily out of Max&#39;s mouth and the boy panted excitedly. &quot; This is so cool I&#39;m so little again&quot;. Max examined. He explored his young body giggling as he found his penis and started playing with it. It slowly emerged from his sheeth and flopped limply &quot; aww I don&#39;t get erections anymore&quot; he played with his limp penis rolling it between his fingers. A glob of drool dripped from Jeff and splattered on Max&#39;s hand. He abandoned his penis and started playing with his tongue, running his fingers down the slobbery length.<br />
      After he finished playing he sat back down to make some adjustments.&quot; Ok I want my penis to get bigger but I don&#39;t really want erections right now I&#39;m only 7, my tongue definitely has to be longer and&quot; he paused heart racing in his chest&quot; I&#39;ve always wondered what it would be like being a girl&quot; he moved the mouse to the gender option&quot; no I want to be a little boy again I&#39;ll try being a girl later&quot; just after he clicked confirm the lights flickered and the internet disconnected he got a pop-up warning him that connection to the Chronivac Servers was interrupted and all changes would become permanent&quot; what was that??!&quot; He clicked on the undo arrow only to be greeted by a notification that there was nothing to undo. He tried to change his age manually but the slider was grayed out and didn&#39;t work&quot; fuck he said in his new higher voice now I have to grow up all over again.<br />
       Max went downstairs still naked and found his Mom in the kitchen. &quot; Hi Max sweetie&quot; she pet his head gently&quot; why are you naked? What happened to your clothes&quot; &quot;Nothing happened mom I&#39;m just hot&quot; Max sat down at the table panting lightly Jeff the tounge hanging out to the side dripping slightly. &quot;Mom can San come over and play?&quot; She sat down across from him &quot; of course he can, let me call his mom and find out&quot; she picked up the phone and dialed&quot; just remember you have to wear clothes when we have guests over I know you get hot but not everyone is used to seeing a naked 7 year old running around&quot; Max giggled &quot; Mom I&#39;m almost 8 and besides Sam is always naked at his house his parents don&#39;t care&quot; She looked at her youngest son sitting there panting lightly in the summer heat,&quot; ok you don&#39;t have to wear clothes at HOME or at a friend&#39;s house but only if it&#39;s ok with their parents &quot; Max jumped up and hugged her trying his best not to slobber on her&quot; Thanks mom&quot; she put the phone down&quot; Sam&#39;s parents can bring him over in a hour go clean up your room until then &quot; Max ran from the kitchen and upstairs to his room skidding across the hardwood floor and crashing into the door in his excitement.<br />
       He quickly cleaned up by stuffing his clothes and toys into the closet and under his bed he ran back downstairs to wait for Sam. A short while later Sam&#39;s dad knocked on the door Max eagerly ran over and opened the door forgetting that he was naked&quot; oh hello Max he said is your Mom home &quot; she&#39;s here&quot;Mom!! Sam&#39;s here his dad wants you &quot; Sam stepped in and the boys ran off leaving the adults alone.<br />
      Max&#39;s slammed the door behind them and launched himself at Sam licking his face in greating, Sam returned the favor licking his best friend back as their tails wagged. &quot;Why aren&#39;t you wearing anything did your mom finally agree to let you be naked?&quot; &quot; Yeah after I told her how hot we get she agreed but only at home or a friends house&quot; &quot; nice&quot; Sam stripped down throwing his clothes in a pile. The boys sat down on the floor and played with some trucks. Sam stood up and poked his finger in his sheeth&quot; I need to go pee* Max scrambled to his feet &quot; me to let&#39;s go!!&quot;<br />
       The boys ran into the bathroom scampering across the tile floor, Max lifted the toilet seat and grabbed his soft penis now fully emerged from his sheeth, Sam stood next to him holding his own penis&quot; let&#39;s see who can pee the furthest&quot; he stepped back and Max followed the boys aimed at the bowl and released their piss. Jeff felt Max smile and saw light through the gaps in Max&#39;s missing baby teeth he saw glimpses of the bathroom and Sam. The boys soon ran out of pee and cleaned themselves up making sure the floor was dry &quot; I really don&#39;t want mom to yell at me again for doing that&quot;. They went back to Max&#39;s room and played some more.<br />
       A few hours later Max&#39;s mom knocked on the door&quot; hay you two why don&#39;t you take a break and get some lunch&quot; Max and Sam jumped up and ran out the door to the kitchen. She had made Mac and cheese for the boys and they eagerly grabbed their forks&quot; be careful it&#39;s hot&quot;. After a quick lunch Max skipped down the hall to brush his teeth. Sam joined him in the bathroom as Max brushed his teeth and tounge vigorously slobbering into the sink&quot; wow that&#39;s messy*Sam commented as he watched&quot; oh I almost forgot I&#39;m having a sleepover with Michael you know him right? And I wanted to see if you could come over too?&quot; Max spit into the sink rinsing his mouth out and sticking out his tongue checking it out in the mirror&quot; yeah I do!! Let&#39;s go ask my mom&quot;</p>
