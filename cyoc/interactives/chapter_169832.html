<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Share it at the Park<br />
<br />
Tyler, Sam, Tina, and Zoe are playing volleyball at the park. The four are taking advantage of the holiday weekend to enjoy some fun in the sun. Tyler, the school running back has been dating Tina again since the beginning of the summer. Fit, blond, charismatic, they seemed like the perfect couple. The only problem is that Tyler is a chad and Tina is a total bitch. The seem like they&#39;re always arguing about something that doesn&#39;t matter, and if there&#39;re not then they&#39;re inseparable and are practically always reaching into each other&#39;s pants. Sam and Zoe, on the other hand, dean&#39;s list students, are involved in the student body government, and founders of the African Cultural Heritage club. They are not dating, despite what the rumors say, and despite the insistence by Tyler that Sam needs to &quot;get in there and end your dry spell&quot;. They&#39;re just very good friends who enjoy each other&#39;s company without any extra complexities.<br />
<br />
They&#39;re playing two vs two, men vs women; Tyler and Tina are in the middle of another spat and refused to play together, though it feels more like two vs one as Sam ban barely carry his weight.  Sam serves the ball to start the next point, but suddenly the four hear a shout &quot;BALL!&quot; as a great grey blur darts across the volleyball court, leaps into the air and catches the ball in its mouth even before it could clear the net. Swatting in the middle of their game is a huge anthropomorphic wolf, all four paws on ground, tail wagging, and the popped remains of their volleyball being chewed in between great rows of teeth. There are mixed reactions of confusion, anger, and trepidation among the group, but mostly anger from Tyler.<br />
<br />
Tyler stomps up to this intruder, the wolf-man&#39;s tail wagging as he watches Tyler approach. When Tyler is standing over the sitting canine (though not over by much as the wolf is still just over 5 feet tall while in a sitting position), the wolf spits out the deflated ball and says, &quot;I caught the ball...&quot; and looks on expectantly, maybe wanting Tyler to throw another one.<br />
<br />
Tyler&#39;s face turns red, &quot;What is this?&quot; he shouts, &quot;Is there a furry con in town? Keep your weird fetishes to yourselves!&quot; The other three are still mystified by the creature in front of them, and become a bit frightened when it stands to its full height, but they know that to try and calm Tyler when he gets like this will only make him go longer. He continues to shout, seeming blind with rage, &quot;we don&#39;t need you freaks pushing you business on normal people like us. If I had it my way, every last one of you freaks would be round up and -&quot; And then Tyler was flattened under foot. Alex used his height advantage to lift up a foot paw well over head and while there his toes and pads grew twice its already inhuman size and brought it down upon Tyler&#39;s head. It didn&#39;t hurt though (at least, not as much as one would expect when a body crushing object fell on someone), instead, his body contorted like an accordion underneath the leathery pads of this freak. Down and down he went, Tyler felt like he was deflating all the way to the ground; not only had the air been knocked out of him, but everything inside of him seemed to become insubstantial compared to the all-consuming mass of the toe pads pressing on him. Having been smooshed under foot, Tyler felt weak, small, and in the dark.<br />
<br />
Alex lifts his foot off the mess he&#39;s made. It sticks like gum on a shoe, but the flesh colored mound snaps off and Alex&#39;s overgrown foot returns to its normal cartoonishly large size. Sam, Tina, and Zoe all bend over to look at their friend; there is a three foot diameter perfect circle of flesh about as thick as a flapjack laying on the ground with a clear and obvious paw print indented into it. under the paw indent there is a screwed up abstract toon rendition of a pair of palm up facing hands and a smooshed human face that captures some of Tylers more characteristic features. It blinks a few times and looks around but otherwise does not appear able to move on its own.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what a &#39;furry&#39; is,&quot; The wold interjects, &quot;but he was being loud and annoying. I&#39;m Alex, by the way. nice cha meet &#39;ya!&quot; He reaches out with a gloved hand offering a handshake. All three are stunned into silence until one of them breaks out of their daze. &quot;TYLER!&quot; Tina screams and rushes down to the flat sentient disk on the ground. She tries to lift it, but it&#39;s just as heavy as Tyler was. &quot;What have you done to him?!&quot; Alex just looks on without really getting what the problem is.<br />
<br />
Sam and Zoe each rush to Tina and grab a shoulder and try to pull her away. &quot;Come on, we&#39;ve got to get out of here!&quot; encouraged Zoe, but Tina was fighting them, willing to do nothing but sob into the modern art caricature that her boyfriend has become. &quot;Wow, she really needs to cool down&quot; Alex says. &quot;Ah ha! I know just the thing! I&#39;ll be back in two shakes of a dog&#39;s tail!&quot; in a flash, Alex has run off in a random direction out of sight. Just enough time passes for Sam to ask &quot;are we safe?&quot; before Alex returned holding a cartoon fire hydrant. A glance a couple hundred feet away would show a geyser of water jettisoning out of the main line where surly this hydrant was just pulled from. Alex plants the hydrant in front of the group, &quot;This baby will cool you guys off in no time flat.&quot; The word &#39;flat&#39; elicit another bellowing cry from Tina. Alex winces and says, &quot;ouch, and not soon enough&quot; and he undoes one of the valves, sending a torrent of light blue water splashing over the group. The three are all lost from view in the cascade, a chorus of burbling sounds and gasps emanating from the flood. <br />
<br />
The gush of water only lasts a couple moments before it dies down to a trickle, but in its wake lay several very different figures splayed out on the ground. One props himself up begins to shake dry his dripping wet wet body. As he does so, wild black fur poofs up across him with a FWOMP sound, leaving the toon canine (a Bonuvier des Flandres) looking very fluffy and round; round head with big round nose atop a big round snout, round body particularly in the pelvis to stomach region, fat round three toed feet and four fingered gloved hands, and a big round bulge between his legs underneath a pair of shorts. <br />
<br />
His fur is so bushy around his face that his eyes aren&#39;t even uncovered, but he seems to see all right anyways as he notices another body laying across his legs. He blushes a deep red (despite his face being covered by fur) looking over the elegant figure of the dark cocker spaniel laying face down across him, her modest breasts pressed against his thigh, clad in a purple sports bra, and giving a beautiful view of her shapely ass, her floofy tail flipped across her back. Although nothing naughty is showing beneath her yoga pants, the fluff bursting out at the ends around her caffs look like natural leg warmers, and she&#39;s got a matching set around her forearms. She&#39;s surprisingly human proportioned and sensibly dressed for a cartoon.  <br />
<br />
Sam forgets his and Zoe&#39;s precarious position as she comes to and lifts her head up, her thick black twin braids covering her ears and draped across her shoulders, cute button nose at the end of an elegant muzzle facing him, and soulful brown eyes drawing him in. They gaze into each other&#39;s eyes (her eyes, is shaggy eye brows) and lean in towards each other, a pink heart outline framing them as a classical music crescendo starts to build. The music abruptly stops with a record scratch and the heart frame shatters to a shrill shout, &quot;O. M. G., He is SO hot!&quot;.<br />
<br />
There is a cartoonishly proportioned blond girl collie pointing at Alex with a gloved hand with several dangly bracelets. With legs that flare out at the hips atop huge round padded feet in flip-flops supporting her bikini clad boobs that could be mistaken for far away blimps that seem to float up on their own, this bitch is the antithesis of modesty. And that&#39;s not me bad mouthing her, she&#39;s wearing a pink collar with a rhinestone &quot;BITCH&quot; bedazzled into it. Above the collar is the exaggerated sultry face of a collie; Bright blue eyes with thick eye lashes, a long snout that flares out towards the end to accommodate a bulbous nose and candy apple red lips, and attentive fluffy ears sticking up from a lush mane of blond hair that falls all the way down to her wagging tail.<br />
<br />
Without a moment&#39;s more hesitation, the panting bimbo toon dog rushes over to Alex in a blink of an eye and presses her beach ball tits against him. &quot;Like, heeeeey. I&#39;m Tina! Those are Sam and Zoe but don&#39;t pay any attention to them because I&#39;m, like, so happy to meet you, and stuff!&quot; She says trying and failing to play it cool. <br />
<br />
Sam looks at how Tina is acting towards Alex and suddenly feels a pang of insecurity. Sam takes a deep breath and sucks in his gut, inverting his pear shape and sending all that round pudge from his bottom half to his pecs and biceps. He hitches up his now 2-feet-too-wide pants and slides over casually to Zoe. &quot;So, uh, come here often?&quot; he asks with an artificially deep voice. In response, Zoe side eyes Sam, holds up a sewing needle, and pops his huge air-filled mussels. &quot;Don&#39;t be a goober.&quot; Sam looks down to the ground defeated as rain starts to poor over him and only him. But his chin is brought back up by Zoe&#39;s finger so that the are looking at each other again and she says, &quot;you don&#39;t have to pretend to be something different for me&quot;. She then leans in and lock lips with his. What complexities were they even worried about? <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! You guys are finally doing it!&quot; Tina shouts from the other side of the court while casually sitting on top of Alex&#39;s speedo clad bulge, sweat dripping from his face. &quot;Well it&#39;s about time! I&#39;ve got a new boyfriend too! We should, like, play a game to celebrate!&quot; With that she slides off, eliciting an exhale of release from Alex. Tina walks over and picks up the flattened Tyler still laying on the ground, seemingly not that heavy anymore. She spins him around to get access to his underside, takes a deep breath and blows into (some part of) him. With one breath, she&#39;s inflated the flat disk with Tyler&#39;s image printed onto it into a volleyball with  Tyler&#39;s image printed onto it (larger than the one that Alex popped but still smaller than Tina&#39;s tits). Tyler, now with some more life pumped into him, says, &quot;This is so humiliating,&quot; before starting the service point.<br />
<br />
The new pack of friends and lovers, some old and some new, are playing volleyball at the park. Then suddenly, a shadow silently passes from over head. They all look around to for the source before the four dogs all see it at the same time: a Frisbee disc sailing majestically through the air. And then the volleyball court was abandoned, a cloud of up kicked dust and grass lingering in the air as a volleyball bounces to the ground... <br />
<br />
&quot;Um... a little help? Please? ... Hello? ... Anybody?&quot;</p>
