<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>Tricia first noticed that her hair was growing out again. It was different this time, though. It started to billow out behind her, and some of the locks were even falling in her face. She tried to brush them out of her way, but she just couldn't keep all of it behind her shoulders. The locks in the front were shock white and the rest of it was pitch black.
<P>Meanwhile, the sensation of fur was returning to her body. She saw black fur covering almost every visible part of her skin now. The only exception was the white fur that grew down her neck, her chest, and dipping into her shorts.
<P>She looked over herself for other changes. She could see that her hands were covered in white fur, and they were growing claws. Her feet were doing the same thing.
<P>"What am I? A cat?" Tricia asked. Samantha stood silently watching with crossed arms and a knowing smile.
<P>Tricia continued to watch as her body changed, though with her thickening mane of hair, it was hard to get a clear view. She could feel a tug at the base of her spine, and knew a tail was forming. Samantha had apparently shown some mercy, because it was growing through a hole in her shorts, completely uninhibited. As it grew longer and longer, she could see that it was wide and flat, with two white stripes running along and meeting at the very tip.
<P>"A SKUNK?" Tricia growled. "A cat would have been fine, but a SKUNK? Give me that remote." Tricia stomped over to Samantha on her newly-pawed feet and snatched the remote out of her hands. She apparently didn't grab it well enough, however, as it fell on the carpet with a soft thud.
<P>Tricia bent over to pick it up, her shower of hair now flying in front of her. After padding the floor a few times to locate it among her tresses, she found it, but she couldn't grasp it. "What's going on?" she wondered.
<P>She found her answer when she stood back up, brushed the white locks away, and looked at her hands. Her fingers had shortened considerably, and her thumb was almost nonexistent. Her hands had been changed into perfect paws. There was no way she could hold the remote, or anything for that matter.
<P>"Serves you right," Samantha said as she picked up the remote. "Don't worry, though, the rest of the world won't care what you look like."
<P>Tricia was about to respond with a threat, when a tugging on her hair interrupted her. Her scalp tightened and she turned around in surprise. A thick bunch of hair whapped her in the face, and she could feel the rest of it tossing about. So her hair wasn't caught on anything, like she first thought.
<P>Other sensations startled her as well. She felt her clothes changing and something tighten at her upper arms.
<P>"Come on into my room, there's a big mirror there." Samantha pulled on Tricia's furry arm and led her into her bedroom. Tricia walked slowly up to the floor-length mirror and realized the extent of her changes.
<P>Her skunkified body was gorgeous. She had a stripe of white fur running down her nose, around her mouth and down her neck. Her ears were cute and round. She was now wearing a tattered red shirt with a white skull and crossbones on it. The sleeves looked like they had been torn right off. Her upper arms had one black silver-spiked bracelet each, hugging her fur tightly. Her shorts had changed to dark blue jean shorts, with a lock and chain strung around the waist. The shirt was short enough to expose her white belly.
<P>Her hair was insane. It had obviously thickened to comical proportions. The hair at the front of her head had turned white, leaving the rest solid black. All of it was done up in a series of four pigtails, each containing enough strands for a single head, and each reaching almost to the floor. The pigtails on either side of her head had all of her white hair gathered in them, and the two pigtails in the back of her head had the black hair. They made a semicircle around her head, each done up in a tight red scrunchie. She knew from the feel of it somewhere behind this huge mass of hair there was a large skunk tail, but it wasn't visible in the mirror.
<P>Her hands and feet resembled the paws of an animal, with no posable thumbs. Her gaping mouth showed sharp little teeth. The weight of the hair on her head was uncomfortable. She had to keep her neck stiff or else she'd wind up staring at the ceiling.
<P>"Why the hell did you do this to me?"
<P>"Cuz it's funny," Samantha said. "Punk skunk instead of goth cow. I'm not sure which I like better."
<P>"And how long am I going to look like this?" Tricia asked, turning away from her strange reflection.
<P>"Depends," Samantha said. "Whenever I finally find a form that I like?" She turned her attention to the remote in her hands. She began going through its menus again. "Feel free to try out that new body. I might be a little while. And this time, I won't be a stupid mouse."</p>
