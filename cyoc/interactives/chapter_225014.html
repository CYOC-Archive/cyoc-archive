<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“… as we have informed those who have tuned into the start of the morning news; a surprise early dawn raid was just carried out in a compound just outside of Saphire village in Montana. The town sits roughly two and a half hours northwest of Billings. The raid was conducted by a task force with agents from the FBI, ATF. Child Protective Service and the local state police.”<br />
Edward watched the latest news broadcast as he stood in the living room sipping coffee. He silently chuckled as this must have been the fundamentalist compound that Bob Clawfoot escaped from. Recalling the anthro bear furry’s story from last night. He looks at his cell phone to see a text message from Bob show up. They exchanged numbers shortly after leaving. Edward Heartpaw responds that he is currently watching the news. Noting that not much information is being given out as this is currently an active federal investigation.<br />
<br />
“At least this didn’t become like Waco,” Edward turning off the television. He remembered that event as he was a teenager during the disastrous siege at Waco Texas. Normally he would be getting dressed and ready for work; but now that he is an anthro fox furry, he narurally eschewed putting on clothes. Instinctively finding the garments constricting and irritating his fur. Last night before he and Julia retired to bed and engaged in a raucous and satisfying rut, he waved a hand paw at his dresser and closet and transformed all his clothes into alchemical ingredients for Julia to experiment with. Finding out she already transformed their washer and dryer into a DIY alchemy lab, Edward was more than happy to assist his wife’s attempt to use magic to help increase the potency and speed of infecting humans and turning them into Furry’s.<br />
<br />
Edward finishes his coffee and then heads to his daughter’s room; it was then that he remembered that she went out with Brittany Soulfang and the two were staying the night at the house where their mates were. He looks at the text message Allison sent last night and smiled. A selfie with her and Brittany in all their Cougar and Wolf furry glory with two strapping anthro Stag-Deers. There was also a follow up text stating that she was going to take the bus to college in the morning. He turns around and see’s Julia walking to the bathroom. A part of him wanted to follow as he heard the shower turn on and rut her under the cascade of warm water. His growing erection did not hid the fact that his body approved of such carnal desires. He steeled his nerves and managed to will his horniness away as he walked back to the kitchen to get a quick breakfast ready.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
At the Proudhoof house, Allison stirred from her fitful slumber. With bleary eyes she sees she is muzzle to muzzle with Brittany Soulfang; she on her left side, while Brittany was on her right. Behind her she could feel Jake behind her, spooning her. She didn’t need to look to know that the Anthro stag-deer’s cervine cock was out of its sheath and poking her. Also, Jake’s right arm was wrapped around her waist and his hoof hand rest on her tightly toned belly, halfway between her belly button and feminine entrance. His left hand was resting below her ample furry breasts. She hazily remembered the wild romp she and Brittany had with Jake and his twin brother Jimmy. While Jake was gentle and wanted to mate her missionary style, Brittany was more of a wild one, opting for Jimmy to rail her with wild abandon. Insisting he mount her like an animal and engage in rough animalistic sex. They had multiple rounds of this before they finished with some girl on girl action before finally falling asleep. Allison was the first to get up off of the floor where they passed out from sexual exhaustion. Managing to disentangle herself from Jake’s loving embrace, she walks towards the bathroom and promptly sits on the toilet. Taking care to not sit on her tail, she relaxes and lets a stream of urine spill from her feline cookie. She also takes the time to defecate before standing up and cleaning herself up.<br />
“Just because I have fur and no need to wear clothes,” Allison flushing her waste down; “doesn’t mean I need to ignore basic hygiene. Now to shower,” Allison stepping into the nearby stall and turning on the taps.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Sixty minutes later Brittany, Jimmy and Jake are all up and in the kitchen along with Allison. All smiling through their muzzles as they each help in preparing breakfast. Jake setting the table, while Jimmy was cooking up a large helping of scrambled eggs and bacon. Both Allison and Brittany were preparing the toast and coffee rspectively.<br />
<br />
“Dad didn’t come home after he left,” Jake being the first break the silence as he munches on a slice of toast. “You think he got lucky last night?”<br />
“We’ll find out when we head to the restaurant later today to help prep for the lunch and dinner services,” Jimmy answering as he shovels a strip of bacon into his mouth. &quot;You of course will help prep the bar and work the front end as per usual,&quot; Jimmy smirking as his twin brother was a thumb-less, fumbling buffoon when trying to cook. &quot;At least you can make a decent martini or whiskey sour,&quot; Jimmy then adding; &quot;and have a decent head for book keeping and payroll.&quot;<br />
<br />
The restaurant in question was originally founded by their great grandparents during the Sixties; there father took over around the late 1990’s and has been going strong since. It was thanks to Jake and Jimmy’s quick thinking into providing online delivery during the Covid lockdown that allowed the restaurant to stay afloat and not go out of business. But it was around this time that tragedy struck and their mother was taken from them. Hopefully, now that their father is an anthro buck-deer furry like them; it is assumed that their father Michael Proudhoof is out of his depressive funk and ready to begin anew.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Michael arrived at the restaurant at the crack of dawn. He usually arrives along with his son’s around ten in the morning to assist the line cooks prep. But now Michael felt hopeful, his success in finding a mate last night renewed his zeal for life and felt true happiness for the first time in a long while. Denise who became a very lithe and powerful anthro tigress fury who he had an intense passionate rut last night before they fell asleep in each other’s embrace was the kick to the ass he needed to get out of his doldrums.<br />
<br />
Michael was still feeling randy when he arrived and started turning on the lights to the restaurant kitchen and checked to make sure the cook line was functioning properly for the days service. His rod was at full attention and he had a sudden idea popped in his head. A standing lunch order for a modestly sized engineering firm was to be prepared today and Michael had the idea of lacing the food and having said office turn into horny furrys like himself and his sons. So he starts to stroke his shaft slowly as he grabs a nearby measuring cup. Picking up in tempo as he moans in delight as he feels his large testicles quiver as they begun working in overdrive to churn out a batch of infectious cum. It wasn’t long before he instinctively grunts and thrusts as he felt his orgasm reach and began blowing his load. Michael was careful to ensure every drop of his cum landed in the measuring cup as he kept spurting for a solid two minutes.<br />
<br />
As the orgasm subsided, Michael examines the glass container and smiles in satisfaction as he produced a large amount of seed.<br />
“Almost two cups worth,” Michael heading to the walking cooler to grab various condiments and pre-made sauces and proceeds to mix the cum in. being careful to blend his cum in so as not to alter the color or taste, he takes a quick sample and nods in satisfaction.<br />
“This will serve for the sandwiches that Greg will soon arrive to help prepare,” Michael leaving the condiments out as he grabs the bread, meats and various vegetables. Michael then pauses to put on a fresh pot of coffee. Taking a bit of his cum, he places it in the carafe before turning on the machine to beginning brewing a pot.<br />
“If I remember,” Michael grinning, “Greg likes to drink a cup of Joe before he begins work. He will be the first of my staff to become a furry. When Jake and Jimmy arrive,” Michael putting away the measuring cup with some of his cum still leftover; &quot;I&#39;ll get them to help in dosing the food. Every customer who orders food today will become a furry.&quot;</p>
