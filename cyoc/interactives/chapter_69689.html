<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan felt cool grass underneath his feet. This seemed a little strange to Dan because just before he had passed <br />
out he had been wearing shoes, in fact Dan had been pretty sure he had been wearing clothes. Wherever he was, <br />
he was completely naked.<br />
<br />
He took in his surroundings. The first thing he noticed is that while it was “night”, the sky was filled with <br />
unfamiliar constellations, large alien planets.<br />
<br />
The most significant feature of this strange place was the largest ash tree Dan had ever seen. It was <br />
gargantuan in size, spanning at least a kilometre in diameter. It just seemed to keep going up taller and <br />
taller.<br />
<br />
Surrounding the giant tree were fields luminescent tulips and daisies, their hues mixed shades yellow, light <br />
blue, pink and purple. The flowers stood tall waving idly back and forth with a gentle breeze, almost in <br />
reverence to the godly tree before them. Dan noticed a path leading through the field, beaten down and well <br />
established. Obviously, generation after generation have been following  this path for eons<br />
<br />
Dan followed the path, idly admiring the flowers, which appeared to react to his presence by moving in <br />
formation in waves and swirls. Dan couldn't get too preoccupied, somewhere around here Patrick needed Dan. He <br />
walked down this path for what seemed like forever. The entire place was all to quiet. As Dan got closer to <br />
the tree, its scale become all the more immense.<br />
<br />
The path lead Dan underneath the roots of the tree,  In the distance he saw Patrick.  He was standing with his <br />
back to Dan, on a stone platform suspended over water. Dangling over the platform was a smaller tree heavy <br />
with fruit. Whatever changes were happening to him at home, they appeared to be completed here. Patrick was <br />
now a ginger God, statuesque in stature (even compared to before) with inhumanly oportioned biceps and quads, <br />
his body covered by dense red fur. Am I too late? Dan thought.<br />
<br />
Dan decided to approach carefully, not wanting to surprise him. “Patrick..” he sheepishly called. Patrick <br />
looked over his shoulder a little, dismissing thinking he was mistaken. “Patrick!” turned himself around and <br />
instantly recognised Dan.<br />
<br />
Patrick's brightened up in a way which Dan had previously never thought possible. He got up and ran towards <br />
Dan. He had the enthusiasm and energy of a puppy racing to meet his Master as he returns home, but he had the <br />
intensity and force of a charging bull. Patrick lifted Dan off ground and wrapped his arms around Dan in the <br />
strongest embrace he had ever felt. With his head pressed against the ginger's massive hairy pecs and the <br />
braided beard which had now grown down to his waist,  Dan couldn't breath. He he felt his eyes were just about <br />
to pop out of the sockets.  “I thought you would never get here?” Patrick cried. As best he could, Dan beat <br />
against the wall of meat, squirming for release. <br />
<br />
The penny dropped and Patrick put Dan down, but continued to hold onto Dan. The feeling of naked skin to naked <br />
skin was an overpowering sensation for Patrick.  His mammoth cock stirred. “Sorry” Patrick said sheepishly <br />
clearly feeling self conscious as Dan felt pre-cum oozing pooling between their feet. For a moment the two <br />
just stood there enjoying the moment. <br />
<br />
Patrick bent down and kissed Dan on the lips. Despite his strength and stature, Patrick's kiss was soft and <br />
tender – his tongue carefully exploring Dan's mouth. Upping the ante, Dan forcefully drove his tongue down <br />
Patrick's throat, biting Patrick's lip and bighting down on on his meaty neck, leaving plum-purple bruises. <br />
Patrick moaned in pleasure. He face scrunched his mammoth testicles tightened as he let forth a torrent of <br />
tick cum, shooting several feet. Most of it landing in the water.<br />
<br />
Patrick gave Dan a little bit of space. “How long have you been here?” Dan inquired.<br />
<br />
Back where they came from, Patrick has only had only been unconscious for a couple of minutes. But from the <br />
way Patrick was acting it seemed much much longer.<br />
<br />
“I don't know, hours... weeks... months. There is no day/night cycles around here. It's difficult to tell”<br />
<br />
“And where exactly is 'here'?”<br />
<br />
Patrick smiled. “Yggdrasil, of course! This tree supplies is the source of all life and energy in the cosmos. <br />
It's not quite right to describe here as a “place”. It's not real... but it kind of is... in a way. It's hard <br />
to explain.”<br />
<br />
Dan was truly lost. “Well, when a ginger initiates changes he becomes hyper receptive to a special wave <br />
frequency, which we call the Yggdrasil-Resonance – which is present on a sub-atomic level in all matter. Like <br />
regular human beings can't see infra-red, most people are innert to Y.R.... for Gingers it's like tuning a <br />
radio to the correct channel- his body fortifies as best it can to become a conduit, harnessing Y.R and <br />
himself and and the fabric of reality, and in doing so becomes a 'god'.<br />
<br />
A flash of consideration crossed over Dan – The Chronovac! “Would it be possible for someone to harness the <br />
Yggdrasil Resonance mechanically?” Asked Dan.<br />
<br />
“It's certainly would be difficult, but not impossible. All they would have to do be able to tap into the <br />
right energy harmonic. Only an foolish person would try though. Normally a ginger who harnesses this power can <br />
utilise it unsustainably – unless he is bound of course. Without binding it's like opening yourself up to the <br />
whole universe, but the more a ginger taps into the Y.R the more stress his body is exposed to. That's because <br />
his body acts as a buffer, taking a penalty rather than having the effects ripple onwards. Without the right <br />
safeguards...” Patrick trailed off looked a little grave.<br />
<br />
“Anyway” he continued. Changing the topic “My physical change is complete. Now I'm here to 'throw the switch' <br />
as it were... and you're here connected through me. I can't express how thankful I am. I'm so glad I waited.”<br />
<br />
“Why did you wait for me?” Dan asked.<br />
<br />
“Because what I'm about to do. I need you here for.”</p>
