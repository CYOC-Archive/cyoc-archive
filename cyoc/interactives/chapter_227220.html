<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Does Aaron have the same” Jenny asked reaching forward and running a finger along Ryan’s thick hard cock. He moaned in excitement as she did. “No, no he doesn’t” he said breathing heavily, “I got all the cock!”  Jenny was surprised. Could twins have different penises? “Prove it” she whispered into Ryan’s ear as she wrapped her hand around his manhood, “prove your the real man of the house and I’m all yours.”  Ryan was about to bust as Jenny released his unit.  He regained his composure and yelled out “Aaron come to Kurt’s room”. A few moments later Aaron came in, wearing only his underwear, “what?” He asked as he looked around at his naked siblings.  Kurt pushed the door shut, “got to prove something” Ryan said as he quickly moved forward pulling down Aaron’s underwear.  Aaron was now standing completely naked shocked at the entire situation.<br />
<br />
Jenny took the opportunity to look at Aaron’s little penis.  Ryan was right, Aaron’s penis looked less than an inch soft and shriveled against his body.  Aaron didn’t have any pubes and his balls were small pulled up against his body.  “Ohh my god” Jenny said with a mean laugh, “that’s the tiniest cock ever.”  Aaron turned read and tried to pull his underwear up falling as he did. “No, take them” Jenny ordered her other brothers. They did as she ordered.  Aaron began to get hard his pathetic boner reaching a 1 and a half inches and thin as a pencil.  “Stop” Aaron began to shout as he struggled, bumping up against his brothers boners as did.  The other boys were smirking at his little boy cock.  <br />
<br />
Jenny held a finger up to Aaron’s mouth, “shh shh” she silenced him, “do what we say and no one needs to know about your pathetic little peepee”. Aaron became quiet. “Okay” she said, “you’re going to obey me now” she said looking at him. Aaron nodded.  “Down on your knees” she ordered and he obeyed without complaining.  She moved her tight pussy in front of his face, “look at this” she said rubbing it, “no girl is going to want your little clit dick.”Aaron stared at her vag, his cock was at full mast.  Jenny noticed and laughed, “Ryan come here and show this bitch a real cock.”  Ryan came forward his big dick still hard as be placed if right in front of his brothers face.  “Put him in his place” Jenny said as she moved his hand onto her girlhood.  He began to stroke it as he said “you’re such a little bitch, I’m a real man and you’re just a boy.  Every day you exists you have to remember that you’re inferior to me”. Jenny’s cunt began to drip wet at the insults.  “Kurt too” she said.  Ryan turned to Kurt and ordered he down in front of them.  Kurt fought the order for moment before Jenny said “Now, boy.” Kurt looked at the floor as he moved in front of his little brother and sisters exposed genitals.  “Continue” Jenny said in Ryan’s ear softly.  <br />
<br />
“You both wish you were me” he said looking at Kurt. “I’m only eight and I’m a bigger man than you.  All your girlfriends are going to wish my massive cock was in them”. Ryan’s hard cock swayed back and forth as he insulted his brothers, slapping Kurt’s face slightly as it did.  “Suck it” Jenny blurted out as she watch the scene, her pussy dripping as Ryan fingered it.  Kurt looked defeated as he leaned forward and took his 8 year old brother’s big cock into his mouth. He knew his time as big brother was over.  Ryan moaned as Kurt worked his way up and down the boner, not able to reach the base.  Ryan grabbed the back of Kurt’s head and began to thrust slowly at first and then faster until it was clear he had finished.  Kurt swallowed whatever had come out.  <br />
<br />
“Now you blow him” Jenny ordered Aaron, “you can touch me” she said to Kurt. He reached up and began to rub her clit. He was clearly experienced as Jenny began to feel waves of pleasure.  Aaron moved his mouth over to Kurt’s throbbing hard cock and began to lick it.  Kurt took longer than Ryan to cum.  Aaron’s head bounced up and down working the second biggest cock in the room, finally Kurt moaned and began to clench spraying rope after rope into Aaron’s mouth until it began to leak out and drool onto the<br />
Floor.  Jenny was mesmerized by the jizz, “should I lick it up” she asked and watched as Ryan approved. She got down and licked the warm salty puddle.  She enjoyed the taste.  What to do now? She wondered taking in the cocks around here…</p>
