<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>While you wait for the next part, I&#39;m adding some more bad ends.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Troy was busy practicing all his spells for the day. He’d always set a clock-always as in, for the last few days. And now he had to deal with the Familiar spell. He aimed it at the dog across the street, Muffin and smiled as it succeeded. The energy was sucked out of him in a rush, and Troy grinned and passed out, belatedly realizing he’d forgotten to set the clock again…<br />
<br />
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Rusty and Leonard, who now seemed to respond to Lenny, drove home. Rusty scratched an ear and tried not to think about Lenny, formerly Leonard. It was causing him a bit of a crisis and he wasn’t sure what to do about it. Something was going horribly wrong.<br />
<br />
Lenny was much fatter than Rusty&#39;s own memories had informed him. Transforming Troy had somehow done something to Lenny as a byproduct. Now Lenny was an enormously fat, slobby bearman who smelled of musk, spoiled food and precum. He’d showered when they changed into uniforms for their shift, but the musk smell had increased gradually over the course of the day as sweat from the heat of the sun and the promise of sex had done its work. Worse still was that he would not shut up about anime and BattleAnvil and apparently Rusty played it too because he’d found an entire painted miniature army in the back of his personal vehicle.<br />
<br />
He shuddered. Even now, he was having vague memories of playing against Lenny and he’d almost gotten drawn in to a discussion about the changes in fifth edition, which he was against, for some reason, and worse, the longer he listened to the words coming out of his own mouth, the more he was convinced he was right, they’d totally nerfed High Elves into the ground. He’d checked the rear-view mirror after that conversation and found himself looking softer. A quick trip to the bathroom confirmed his worst fears. He had a less-defined body and a forming potbelly. And even worse, instead of freaking out over it like he wanted to, he didn’t half mind it. Troy loved playing with it and even encouraged him to get fatter.<br />
<br />
As his memories shifted to him gorging with Lenny at their many food stops, the potbelly rumbled and inched forward, sagging slightly over his waistband. Distracted with his distended gut, he almost missed his second chin swell into place with an audible *glorp*. Rusty gulped and tried to will his boner away. Lenny was literally rubbing off on him. He’d already gone from bodybuilder to ex-jock and now even his muscles diminished as he watched, leaving him with a dadbod. His rump was becoming bigger as well if his slowly widening waist was anything to go by. Fuck, if he didn’t change Lenny soon, he’d be as big as he was.<br />
<br />
His cell phone beeped. Rusty dug into his pocket for it. It was a struggle, as his fingers had gotten fatter and his pants tighter. There was a *pop* and he blinked. His phone was now on an easily accessible holster at his hip. Had...had that always been there? He finally answerd it. It was Troy.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? I&#39;m busy.&quot; He practically snarled.<br />
<br />
The conversation was short and tense. He&#39;d wanted to calm Troy down but right now he had bigger issues. Like the rising muffin top he was sporting. He grumbled and tried sucking in his belly but he couldn&#39;t hold it. Worse, a button popped off when he let his breath back out. It sewed itself back on, but his shirt had jumped a size. He left the bathroom and went back to work, hoping it would stop soon.<br />
<br />
Rusty wanted to end the shift early, but it was like reality was determined to shaft him. They got yet another call. It was-surprise!-another house call, the fourth today. He’d literally never been this busy. And they were dumb calls. Cats in trees, and owners so grateful they’d give them fresh pies and cake. Rusty knew none of this was a coincidence. It really did feel like whatever had transformed Lenny had turned its sights on him. There was a...not malevolence, but...definitely a directed force bent on molding him into a fat nerd like Lenny.<br />
<br />
“God, it’s like whoever&#39;s doing this wants me to be fatass.” Rusty grumbled after being handed the third pie of the day.<br />
<br />
Apple. His favorite. His mouth filled with saliva but he shook away his hunger. He already had an inkling of how this worked. The more you gave in, the more reality shifted. Two more hours. He just had to hang on that long.<br />
<br />
“Nothing wrong with that,&quot; A voice rumbled next to him and Rusty felt a clawed paw pat his increasingly bulbous gut. It bounced. “You wear the weight well.”<br />
<br />
Rusty felt his heart flutter and let Lenny rub his belly, his dick hardening again. In response, he swore his belly grew even bigger and softer, fully sagging over his belt line. He glanced at the bear, whose loving green eyes were doing things to him now he only ever experienced with Troy. He found himself leaning up to kiss his fellow nerd and best friend-No! That might solidify things. And best friend? He’d literally met him yesterday. Memories, though, contradicted him. He’d fallen for Troy but he’d always played around with Lenny, who was still in the closet at the time, and now that Rusty was openly gay, Lenny had confessed his own feelings.<br />
<br />
His pecs softened and drooped as his memories changed, the muscle replaced with fat. He reached up with one paw and touched a moob. Floppy. That wasn&#39;t...he shouldn&#39;t have a moob...his paw fell away. Something was wrong.<br />
<br />
As if sensing Rusty’s hesitation, Lenny bent down and completed the kiss and Rusty&#39;s concerns flew away. He could feel his thoughts shifting, tried to push the bear away and instead found himself rubbing his belly instead, and then Lenny&#39;s paws moved up to fondle Rusty’s newly formed moobs, massaging his nipples as they swelled to the size of silver dollars. Rusty moaned into the kiss, shocked by the pleasure. He&#39;d never been this sensitive....nipple play was for bottoms and he was...a top? The last of his muscles disappeared, either withering away or vanishing under the thick layer of chub that swelled across his body.<br />
<br />
His resistance fell the longer the groping went on. Why would he resist, anways? And when had Lenny gotten so unbelievably hot? Rusty shifted his jaw to better fit Lenny&#39;s muzzle and his normally well-trimmed chin fur grew down to his chest, leaving him with a tangled cream and brown beard. Rusty groped Lenny&#39;s belly and moobs in return and heard an answering moan from the bear.<br />
<br />
Lenny moved them into a nearby alley out of sight of the road and any onlookers and groped Rusty&#39;s cock through his tight uniform. Rusty&#39;s heart skipped in joy and relief. He&#39;d kept his foot long dick, at least, but there was a welling layer of fat that was swallowing it up. Lenny rubbed it, sending vibrations through his body that set him jiggling.<br />
<br />
 In the squad car, two pies disappeared, leaving only empty tin pans covered in crumbs. Rusty felt a surge of warm contentment and fullness and finally relaxed into a kiss that tasted like the blueberry filling from the pies they&#39;d just ate. His gut gave a final gurgle and lurch before stopping at beachball size and sagging lightly, as though it had been there for years. And it had. <br />
<br />
Lenny broke off the kiss, leaving Rusty panting and dizzy. “Man, you’re such a good kisser. Can’t go farther than that in public, ha! Only two more hours until the end of shift. Then we can put that big dick of yours to work, big guy.”<br />
<br />
Rusty swallowed and nodded, giving himself a quick once over. Moobs and a huge belly with a wide, thick ass to boot. He gave a sigh of relief. Just like he always had. But he needed to be careful for a few more hours or he might get fatter. Which was strange to think, since that’s what his boyfriends liked? He shook it off and smiled. Lenny gave his cock a squeeze and patted his belly one last time.<br />
<br />
”So what were you saying about fifth edition?” Rusty asked as he wobbled to the car.<br />
<br />
His center of balance seemed off for some reason, though he fixed it when he thrust his belly out in front of him. Why would he walk all hunched over like he&#39;d been like he was trying to hide his kegger? He was proud of it. Took him year of binge eating with his boyfriends to get it. And he wore the weight well.<br />
<br />
Lenny chuckled, “Nothing we haven’t argued a million times over. Your army will be fine. It just won’t be fucking broken.”<br />
<br />
Rusty shook his head and switched topics to anime and how shit isekai was as they drove off to the next call, sharing the apple pie between them.<br />
<br />
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Troy was still asleep when Rusty and Lenny walked in.<br />
<br />
“Uh, is that normal?” Lenny rumbled, pointing a finger at the figure sprawled next to the window.<br />
<br />
Rusty shook his head, sending his double-chin wobbling. He hadn’t gotten a third chin, instead his second chin had bloated up like a frog. With the fur covering it, it just made him seem fluffier.<br />
<br />
“Nah, he’s usually ass up in our bed unconscious.” Rusty said, and casually kicked the Book of Beasts under the coffee table.<br />
<br />
Lenny chuckled. “You two. He’s kinda cute like this.”<br />
<br />
“Help me.” Rusty lifted Troy’s legs.<br />
<br />
Lenny grabbed hold of his arms and together, with lots of panting and straining, the two overweight anthros managed to hoist Troy onto his bed. <br />
<br />
Lenny laughed, ”Let’s make some dinner before he wakes up.”<br />
<br />
They left, closing the door behind them.<br />
<br />
Troy turned in his sleep, his potbelly growing slightly and the cleft of his muscles slowly disappearing.<br />
<br />
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Troy woke an hour later to the sounds of laughing and dice rolling. He sniffed. Delicious smells filled the house-Italian cooking, spaghetti with meat sauce. He drooled. All that training had made him hungry. He tried to hoist himself out of bed but found it harder to do than usual. He frowned and rolled out instead, landing on his feet with a meaty thump. He looked to the door and froze.<br />
<br />
Next to the door was a mirror. Troy ran his paws down soft pecs-almost moobs. Mooblets, a voice whispered in his head. Below that was his potbelly, though one could hardly call it that, as it now looked more like a wobbly soccer ball. He swore he could see the beginnings of a second chin forming. He might have checked his ass, but that was aways fat…although it didn’t seem as firm, now that he looked at it.<br />
<br />
What the hell had happened? Had Rusty done something? Punished him for liking a fatass like Lenny by ruining his figure? That was impossible. The Book of Body was the only Book that could alter one’s body like this. But was that true? He’d changed Clint into a hugely muscled horseman. He wasn’t that muscular as a human. Neither had Rusty been so muscular. He’d had an athletic form, but certainly not the steroid weightlifter look he now sported.<br />
<br />
Another quirk or undiscovered rule of the book, then. But that didn’t explain why he was suddenly fat. And…he squinted at his double chin, which seemed to grow as he looked at it…getting fatter. What had happened? Were they under attack by the owner of the Book of Body? Holy shit, did they have a fat fetish and just changed so many people reality itself was warping world wide!?<br />
<br />
Troy threw on clothes that shouldn’t fit his increasingly flabby form but somehow did...and were much less girly than his usual-it was purple with a cat flying across it on a rainbow-and opened the door. He wandered around the hallway until he reached the living room/kitchen bar and stopped, his jaw dropping.<br />
<br />
Lenny, who was now an incredibly obese bear (fatter than Troy had recalled from their last dalliance), was playing some nerdy wargame on the kitchen table. On the stove bubbled a huge pot of sauce and an unbelievable amount of spaghetti boiled in a huge pan. Troy didn’t recognize either of those pans-they never cooked that much food. But perhaps the worst thing was Rusty.<br />
<br />
For one thing, he was fat-not enormously so, like Lenny-but spherical would be a good description. Rotund. And strangely….kinda hot. For some reason, the phrase “carries his weight well” echoed in Troy’s mind. The Rusty he knew hated geek shit, as he called it, yet here he was, neck wobbling, fur messy and strangely beard-like around his muzzle. Troy swore he saw him actually smiling. Not grinning mischievously and evilly, like he used to. Happy and content, two things Rusty never was.<br />
<br />
As he took in the scene, Troy felt his mind physically being struck by memories. Ones that involved him and Lenny and Troy in a love triangle. Getting fatter and finding out they enjoyed it and geeks were fat, after all, weren’t they, so it wasn’t that big of a deal. Plus Troy was into that anyways, and Lenny becoming a literal bear had basically cinched the deal.<br />
<br />
His mind was nearly overwhelmed by the assault, he physically reeled as his belly grew two inches and started to sag, his double chin wobbling fully into existence and his pecs finally giving out and sagging into moobs. But that was normal, actually, they ate so much-Troy shook his head, and the weight gain slowed to a trickle. Pound a minute, he’d guess. He knew he was fatter in this reality, certainly not like Lenny or Rusty, but “pleasantly plump”. He probably had another 80 pounds to go, at a glance.<br />
<br />
Troy fought back, his mind having built quite the resistance. “No.”<br />
<br />
Rusty looked up, smile faltering. “You okay babe? We found you passed out.”<br />
<br />
Troy took in the scene one last time, blanking his mind from the odd whispers that were telling him to just let go and be himself, and gestured to the door. “We need to talk.”<br />
<br />
Rusty blinked. “I’m almost finished with my turn.”<br />
<br />
“Turns take half an hour.” Troy replied, wondering how he knew that.<br />
<br />
Of course, it was because he played BattleAnvil himself-he dimly heard a *pop* in his bedroom closet as his army appeared in a case-and now his breasts looked plumper, but he realized it was because his belly had grown again and they were resting on it. He steadied himself. Maybe fifty pounds left. <br />
<br />
Oddly, that thought didn&#39;t upset him. In fact, he was disappointed it wasn&#39;t a hundred-his belly gurgled and pushed forward a bit and he realized the end result had changed. He was even plumper and cuter now in the final image. A hundred and ten more pounds to go. He shook the thoughts away in panic. Jesus, whatever this was, it was fast and listened.<br />
<br />
“Now.” He put some power in the growl. It sounded more like a grumble.<br />
<br />
Because he didn’t get angry with Rusty in this reality-Troy shook the thoughts away, aware of how this worked now. The memories and changes were happening hand in hand. No thinking. No matter how hot-he shook his head again. Really slippery bastards, those memories. Almost got him again. He was aware that he was softening even as he stood there, a pound at a time.<br />
<br />
“Okay, okay, holy moly!” Rusty adjusted glasses he’d never needed earlier. “Let me take a picture of the board state.”<br />
<br />
Troy nodded and asked. “The Book?”<br />
<br />
“It…um, hold on.” Rusty blinked and thought hard, running his fingers through his beard. He snapped a quick picture and pointed under the coffee table. “Almost forgot.”<br />
<br />
“You almost forgot about that? You understand why that’s a huge problem don’t you?” Troy replied, slowly, hoping to jog Rusty’s memories.<br />
<br />
Rusty blinked, “Yeah. Kinda. Did something….”<br />
<br />
“Yes. We need to use it now. I think it’s a reality cascade. We need to fix it fast before things go permanently pear-shaped.” Troy giggled at his own pun and stopped himself.<br />
<br />
His chin tickled for a moment and when he scratched his chin and found fur there. A big tuft, which he was sure was quite cute, found himself stroking it absently and wondered if he always did this when he was nervous. He let the thought go as soon as it came. Reality was changing and if he dared dwell on it for a second he’d be whisked away in memories and end up like them. Happy and overweight nerds.<br />
<br />
That was bad…right? He frowned and rubbed a growing nipple and managed to pull away as it enlarged. Shit. It was fucking with him more subtly. Whatever this was, it had hit them both and had hit him harder…because…because obliviously it had gained momentum. Each piece of reality would cement itself, stabilize itself. He was the last domino and had the force of two other reality shifts bearing down on him.<br />
<br />
Troy grunted and had to carefully get down on all fours to get the Book out. Lenny wolf whistled and Troy blushed. Everyone loved his ass, at least that hadn’t changed. His ass ballooned out a bit more, wobbling but keeping its bubbly shape. He finally found the Book and grabbed it, hoping for the Book to offer it’s protection…but nothing happened. No nosebleeds.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit, this is really bad.” Troy whispered.<br />
<br />
Rusty walked over to him, his pawfalls heavy. Troy took him by a saggy arm and left the house, keeping near the window.<br />
<br />
“What’s up?” Rusty asked as Troy shut the door.<br />
<br />
“You aren’t fat, you’re fit and muscular, not nerdy. I’m holding the book.” Troy added the last one as more of a bluff. Apparently, this was reality now, so obviously the book wouldn’t be able to affect it.<br />
<br />
Rusty scrunched his brow cutely, “How?”<br />
<br />
“Lenny got caught in the reality bubble we created. He’s fat and nerdy...but more so than he used to be. Reality had to correct itself, make it make sense. It hit you next, because a fit guy and a fat cop don’t make sense. And now it’s hitting me.”<br />
<br />
“But you’ve always been-”<br />
<br />
“Stop! Not another word. Reality shift. Of course you think that.”<br />
<br />
Rusty grabbed the book. And blinked. “No nosebleed?”<br />
<br />
“Right. That’s the other part. This is simply reality shifting to reassert itself. You’ve already given me the speech about choosing which reality we believe in, right? Someone is tipping the scales. I thought it was the Book of Body attacking us, but it’s clearly just…”<br />
<br />
“Natural force. Also, holding the book did do something. I see the real you. I can compare it to my old memories. Sorry to say, but you’re, like, Fifty pounds fatter than this.”<br />
<br />
“Nope, stop, reality will force memories in.” Troy held up a hand, though he felt his belly push forward another inch and wobble before sagging slightly. “No talking about that.”<br />
<br />
Rusty eyed the belly as it wobbled. “Do we.. need to stop it?”<br />
<br />
“Are you a cop?”<br />
<br />
Rusty nodded absently, still staring at Troy’s belly, which Troy realized was rising as they spoke. Like lovely soft dough-he shook the thought away. He swore he felt something caressing him, soothing him, telling him he could just be happy. His cock was hard, nestled in the warmth of his growing fat pad, yet he felt something twining around it. He breathed out, his stomach swelling-and then shut out the thoughts. Forty more pounds and he&#39;d be stuck.<br />
<br />
Let&#39;s go with fifty, the voice seemed to whisper. Rusty&#39;s hand wandered towards his belly.<br />
<br />
“What were your calls like today?” Troy batted Rusty’s hand away. “Rusty? Wake up.”<br />
<br />
“Uh, yeah, house calls, but it was mostly cats in trees. We got pies and cake though. Oh! I should bring those in-” Rusty bustled off to the squad car.<br />
<br />
His ass swayed left and right, mesmerizing. Drool started to form on the side of Troy’s growing jowls. Ass and cake, the perfect meal. He blinked and shook himself. That fucking dog would destroy them. He closed his eyes, concentrating on his breathing and nothing else, not even the softly rising chub or the creak of his shorts as the grew and resized, waited for the cakes to be put away.<br />
<br />
Rusty came back outside, wiping off his hands. Troy glanced down at himself. Fifty more pounds and he&#39;d be done. Hold on, was that right? He&#39;d thought he&#39;d said fifty last time. It was nice and warm and soft, fifty wouldn&#39;t be so bad…<br />
<br />
“Hey.” Rusty’s paw rubbed Troy’s belly gently. <br />
<br />
Troy knew he had to resist but the rubbing felt so nice. His gut pushed Rusty’s paw further away as it grew. He gasped as Rusty’s paw circled around him, sliding past his generous love handles and squeezed his widening rear.<br />
<br />
Troy stared into his boyfriend’s soft, happy eyes and leaned forward, kissing him, enjoying the taste of pie on his breath. His cock was hard, still managing to poke out of his burgeoning fat pad, and Rusty’s hand reached down into his pants and gripped it gently, pulling him forward and into the house.<br />
<br />
Over Rusty’s plump shoulder, Troy saw the police cars *pop* out of existence, replaced with a beat-up looking van. Rusty’s thick paw squeezed his generous ass and pushed him through the door before Troy could say anything. He was obese now, he could tell, but like Rusty, his fat was nice and taut. Fifty more pounds and he’d be done for. Troy shook his head, second chin wobbling. He was sure he’d gained more pounds.<br />
<br />
When he turned and saw the living room, his heart skipped a beat.<br />
<br />
The couch was folded open into a futon. Lenny’s things were piled into one corner of the room, his gaming stuff had replaced the potted plants they’d set there before. Lenny himself was walking over to them, tongue licking his jowly chops, big belly jiggling.<br />
<br />
“Something up?” Lenny asked, squeezing Troy’s ass.<br />
<br />
“Naw, Troy was just having a panic attack.” Rusty stroked The tip of Troy’s dick, fingers digging into the fat pad to get a better grip. “And he’s hard.”<br />
<br />
Lenny nodded, big paws roaming across Troy’s increasingly flabby form, groping and squeezing his breasts. The voice seemed to have disappeared for now, and all Troy could feel was how nice those paws were. Even Lenny’s pretty green eyes were attracting him now.<br />
<br />
“I’m-” Troy swallowed, his body slowly sagging as his skin lost some elasticity.<br />
<br />
“Really horny, huh?” Lenny chuckled and guided Troy down onto his futon. “Come on, Rusty, let’s help our boyfriend out.”<br />
<br />
Boyfriends? Troy was about to protest when Rusty kissed him again. Lenny sidled up behind him and began pressing a fat digit in Troy’s hole. He gasped as the bear found his prostate and rubbed it gently. His t-shirt strained, an inch of belly peeking out the bottom. Troy felt the cold air on his gut and glanced down, adjusting his glasses.<br />
<br />
As he glanced down between his floppy moobs and his protuberant gut, he realized he didn’t care how much growth he had left. The extra pies disappeared from their pans. Troy burped as Lenny rubbed his overfull belly, enjoying the taste of pie. Troy tried to keep himself aware, but it was so hard. He was trapped between two loving boyfriends who were determined to keep him pinned until he came. Everywhere he turned, he was met with a muzzle thirsty for a kiss. Lenny gently curling digit and Rusty’s gentle but insistent tugging were bringing him closer and closer to the edge.<br />
<br />
Troy relaxed, he had a full belly and two loving boyfriends. He smiled, not noticing his shirt grow to cover his belly up and then some, becoming over-large on him. His pants changed into comfortable basketball shorts. His fur became fluffy and a bit unkempt. He made one last attempt to extricate himself and failed, a roaming paw pulling him back in. He looked around at the smiles and love in these eyes of his boyfriends.<br />
<br />
He was..he was…<br />
<br />
Fat and happy, just like his boyfriends.<br />
<br />
Troy came, tongue lolling out as all thoughts about resisting disappeared from his mind. Rusty hadn’t seemed to notice or care about Troy’s orgasm, his hand squelching as he lubed Troy’s gunt with his own seed, and Troy realized he could go again and he laid back, Taking Lenny’s cock in his move and tonguing the nub. <br />
<br />
The three fucked all through the night. Their reality settled in, the Book of Beasts forgotten. They had more important things to do, like eat and play BattleAnvil. The Book faded from existence, searching to find an owner who had a life they wanted to change.</p>
