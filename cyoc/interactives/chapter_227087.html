<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emily opens the door and walks in sheepishly, her cheeks flushed and her eyes low, yet she sported a little smirk... As if she had something up her sleeve you didn&#39;t know about.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, she went and stood at the far wall of your room, as far away from you and the Veil as she could. &quot;Look... You won fair and square.&quot; she said, showing you her hands. &quot;I really am just here to talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Suuure.&quot; you say, dripping with sarcasm. &quot;You say you have something to... Confess? Out with it then, and then get out of my room.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nods. &quot;This isn&#39;t easy to admit but... I&#39;ve always been jealous of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You chuckle. &quot;Jealous? Look if this is a trick....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No trick. I&#39;m being honest.&quot; she says. &quot;I&#39;ve been starting to have... You know... Feelings. Uh... For girls.&quot; she half-lied. &quot;And seeing you at school being so... Confident and successful... It made me jealous of you. You know, as a girl in high school, other girls don&#39;t really look at you in <i>that</i> way. Boys seem to be interested in me but... I&#39;d like it better if I was like you... If girls looked at me like they&#39;d watch a... Boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
You smirk, throwing the Veil up and catching it, teasing her with it. &quot;So, you came here to ask me to make you a boy? With the Veil I just stole from you?&quot; you lean back in your chair with a satisfied grin. &quot;Sorry sis. No can do. Honestly, I was trying to think of ways I could humiliate and diminish you with the Veil, but this is perfect! I <i>love</i> having you be shorter and weaker than me. And now that you told me about this, I really love that you will spend your whole life pining for girls, spending your whole life painfully aware that because you don&#39;t have <i>anything between your legs</i>, they won&#39;t ever see you as anything but a friend. Just another girl to gossip about boys with!&quot; You scoff. &quot;You&#39;ll spend your whole life knowing that what I have between MY legs allows me to make any girl I want spread her thighs for me and moan my name. That I can make any girl pregnant with my cum, while you can only bump your cockless little mound against hers, wishing you had half the power that I have over any girl. That any girl, you included, will always be weaker and shorter than me...&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily&#39;s meek and surprised expression turned into a menacing smirk as you spoke. &quot;Oh?&quot; she replied, innocence all but gone from her voice. &quot;That so silly of you to say... <i>Considering you ARE a girl yourself, along with a &#39;cockless little mound&#39;, like you say.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
You scoff. &quot;Yeah, you wish!&quot; you say, your voice breaking awkwardly in the middle of your reply, jumping to a higher octave. Eyes wide with surprise, you feel yourself shrinking into your clothes as you look down at your rapidly shrinking body. With a gasp, you see the still-hard erection that strained your jeans grow smaller and smaller, and as you try to grab your proud manhood with your shrinking hands, you only manage to feel it dwindle and shrink into a humiliatingly small little button meant only to turture you with pleasure... The feeling of tightness and throbbing desire is soon replaced with a radiating and vague feeling of warmth that tingles between your softening thighs... An empty, wet feeling that you instinctively know would be satisfied by something <i> penetrating you</i>. You clutch the Veil in your now delicate hand, and thrust it towards your sister held firmly in your small fist. <i>&quot;Emily is a silly little baby!&quot;</i> you shout triumphantly at her in your new, soft, feminine voice.<br />
<br />
Yet, Emily is standing unchanged before you, still displaying that annoying, confident smirk that now seems more threatening to you by the second. To your great dismay, you don&#39;t see her shrink fully inside her clothes, crawling out as a helpless little girl, unable to speak or understand what happened to her... No, the defiantly-14 year old is looking down at you without any craving for a pacifier or any sign of getting helplessly younger... &quot;Why isn&#39;t this working!&quot; you squeal girlishly as you feel petite but perky breasts push against your oversized shirt. Your stiff and aroused little nipples brushing against the fabric distractingly, making the ache and emptiness between your legs that mucb more distressing. <i>&quot;Emily is too horny to think! Emily can&#39;t help but pee herself as she gets younger!&quot;</i> you say, shaking the Veil which seems to have lost all power on her. <i>&quot;I&#39;m a boy! I&#39;m a big, strong man!&quot;</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Now you&#39;re just being silly.&quot; Emily says, walking toward your shrunken and feminized body swimming in oversized male clothes and effortlessly snatches the Veil from your hand. She looks at it with disinterest, shrugs and still places it in her pocket. &quot;Could still be useful.&quot; she says to herself before turning her attention back to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what&#39;s happening? How could you have done this to me without the Veil!? Why isn&#39;t the Veil working!? &quot; you whimper, annoyed at the hint of &#39;hysteria&#39; you notice in your own, panicked female voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I gave myself the power of the Veil before you took it from me?&quot; Emily says with a smirk as she approaches you. &quot;And now, look at you. All those years you have over me, and you&#39;re barely the same height as me.&quot; she coos.<br />
<br />
Grabbing you by your thin, and much narrower shoulders, she forces you to your feet. You yelp weakly, and grab at your jeans, threatening to drop and expose you shame to your sister. Fuming, you look up at her, realising that she&#39;s right,despite being the &#39;big sister&#39; you are looking at her straight in the eye. Exactly the same height. She giggles. &quot;Oh, boys are going to love that. You should know: Boys love the idea of a girl much shorter than them.&quot;<br />
<br />
You grit your teeth. &quot;I&#39;m NOT a girl! And I&#39;m certainly not interested in being the &#39;right size&#39; for men! I&#39;m not gay!&quot; you say with a voice that attempts, and fails, to be menacing. &quot;Turn. Me. Back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily chuckles. &quot;Oh cupcake, you forget who has all the power here. Here&#39;s a hint: it&#39;s not the girl clutching boy-jeans to hide her new, smooth little crotch. And you&#39;re right, big sister, we both know <i>you&#39;re not gay at all.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
As she repeats the words you yelled, you feel a wave of dizziness wash over you. You look in horror as all the posters of swimsuit models on your walls vanish. Panicking, you try to think about the last video you watched online, about that girl in pigtails being railed and demeaned by a man... Realizing with horror that your mind instead focuses on what you think the woman was feeling as she was being claimed and ravished by that thick.... Veiny...<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong big sister? Are you ashamed?&quot; Emily gloats, walking around you as you tremble. &quot;There&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of. After all, you&#39;re just a girl. You can&#39;t really help it if your body wants to be mated... I suppose the more you think about these things, the more precise your kinky little wants will be... Who know what kinks you&#39;ll develop while your body fills you with thoughts of thick, hard, long penises, hmm?&quot; <br />
<br />
You look at Emily through a veil of tears, welling up from your wide, doelike eyes. If you didn&#39;t know any better, you&#39;d think that she wasn&#39;t only enjoying it, but she was also aroused by your predicament. You could see the naughty little bumps on her shirt where her stiff nipples pressed against it. Or the way she pressed her thighs together, and clicked her lips sultrily... Was this making her wet?<br />
<br />
With a deep blush, you realize you were no better. The way your shirt hung on your now slender female frame made it evident your own nipples were stiff with arousal. You could feel your own aching desire deep inside your loins, only empowered by your new sexual orientation that, for now, disgusted you...yet you knew it was only a matter of time before it started to feel natural and you&#39;d be seeking to seduce boys to overpower and ravish you, making you feel small and desired and weak and....<br />
<br />
You shook your head! No! It&#39;s not because you thought most girls were submissive by nature that you&#39;d be this way too! Maybe you&#39;d be a dominant girl, making boys beg and submit to you while they presented their thick.... Veiny.... Stiff....<br />
<br />
Again, you felt a twinge of desire and an absolute emptiness between your thighs that you didn&#39;t want to think about. &quot;I... I don&#39;t want to like boys!&quot; you whimpered, holding back a few sobs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well... That could be arranged.&quot; Emily chimed in. &quot;What is it you said, when you thought you could stop me from turning you into a girl? You wanted to turn <i>me into a little baby girl</i> was it? You wanted me small and helpless. Didn&#39;t you?&quot; she leans towards you menacingly. &quot;You said it clearly when you thought you were in power: you were <i>sooooo happy to be taller and stronger than any girl, so thrilled to have that cock you so loved... I think it would be quite fitting for you to become the weak, petite, young and innocent little sister instead of me, don&#39;t you think?</i>&quot; she said, clutching the Veil in her hand.</p>
