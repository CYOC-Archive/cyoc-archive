<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chloe went to sleep as body fought against the hybrid, canine/human sperm, and ultimately lost. The seed Erika had pumped into Emily&#39;s heavily protected womb was as virulent as any corona virus even a woman who as at the very edge of fertility could get impregnated  by it. <br />
<br />
She had woken in the early am in order to vomit up the contents of her stomach. A night of disturbed sleep she was starting to feel her sick. In a daze of insomnia she went to get dressed. Given she was living a double life of a stripper, then a buttoned down librarian the next day she had to dress appropriately. She had left her secret wardrobe open, hidden behind her ordinary wardrobe. <br />
<br />
One contained her librarian clothes, her oversized lenses and dull beige colored clothing in the form of dresses that ranged from little black leather numbers through to naughty school girl, slutty cheer leader, seasonal costumes like a sexy bunny outfit (which was pretty much a traditional Playboy clone) for Easter and sexy Mrs Claus for Sexmas. Disney was also counted for, public domain, like Snow White and Beauty and the Beast with finally her favorite a sexy police officer&#39;s outfit with cap.<br />
<br />
Inside was a safe built into the wall with a touch pad for her fingerprints. Next to the ajar door with her &#39;librarian&#39; 1970s vibe with a turtle neck, down her thigh reaching past her knees just. Ugly glasses that she didn&#39;t need and a belt. She needed to put in her $889 in tips and pay as Fire Girl and get her head ready for being a normal school librarian.    <br />
<br />
She made her way to the kitchen table. Chloe headed toward her school, as she continued to drive to the school. She started to feel a strange gnawing sensation in her stomach. It was not quite nausea but there was something...off about the way she felt. Chloe gave her stomach a light rub and grunted. &quot;It&#39;s probably nothing,&quot; she said to herself as she kept on her walk, even as she felt her stomach was rounder and tighter against her her skirt than it was this morning.<br />
<br />
By the time Chloe made it to school, she could feel the incredible tightness of her belly fighting with the fabric. Her chest also felt tighter in her bra and top, though Chloe just chalked it up to her bad mood. She hugged absently minded her friend Jenna.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Ooh, your tits feel bigger!&quot; Jenna chuckled<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it sucks,&quot; Chloe said, before turning  &quot;I just got some really strong cravings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot; Jenna asked &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Noodles and peanut butter. Pizza with pickles. Ice cream and...pickles. Mostly pickles.&quot; Chloe mused<br />
<br />
&quot;Eww, I do not want to go around smelling like pickles all day,&quot; Jenna huffed, though she had to admit <br />
<br />
Chloe groaned as she struggled to fit in to her desk, her belly pushing against it as she tried to sit down. Chloe sat in the reference section, not everything was on the internet yet, so she sat in the back of the library, play games on her phone today, she really could not focus. She felt so heavy and sore and her clothes were so tight. Looking down, Jenna was right, her boobs did look a lot bigger than usual, but she just chalked it up to her wearing a different, more lacy bra than usual from last night, underneath her dress.<br />
<br />
Chloe was someone who was secretly feared. She had gotten the last principal to resign on the basis that she knew he was having lap dances, she had given them. However she had had something weird happening the night before. As the day went on, one of the staff in the school she hated, Carmen, got her attention . &quot;Hey Chloe, who is the baby daddy?&quot; Carmen asked with a nasty grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck are you talking about?&quot; Chloe scoffed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who knocked you up? I mean, I am impressed you hid it for so long, but you look ready to pop,&quot; Carmen laughed. &quot;I guess it is not fair to ask you who the baby daddy is. Probably some sperm donor and IVF.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck off,&quot; Chloe said, rolling her eyes. Then, as she went back to her phone, she realized that she had been rubbing her stomach with her other hand. Unconsciously, she was just rubbing big round circles on her belly, which was now very tight against her top. Chloe blushed and excused herself from desk to go to the bathroom, waddling with each step now. At first, she just went there to undo the  bathroom, she felt a strange pressure pushing down on her bladder and she had to go quickly.<br />
<br />
When she slowly made her way out of the stall, <br />
<br />
She waddled her way out of the bathroom, hands in her lower back because it felt so sore now, and pushing her stomach out far in the process. The belt on her jeans finally snapped as her stomach surged out too far and her ass cheeks got too thick and wide, but with her belt in, Jenna did not even notice.<br />
<br />
Chloe was trying to sit behind their desks and noticed how much more attention they were getting now, but they paid it no mind and just thought it was something wrong with their clothes or their diet. But Chloe also noticed how much heavier and more sensitive her breasts were getting and how they were straining against her bra and her top, to the point where she had to unhook her bra and let out a big sigh of relief as her enormous tits could rest freely. <br />
<br />
She did not wear her thong to school that day but her butt cheeks were so swollen and thick now, her regular underwear might as well have been a G string. And gradually, she could hear the seams in their tops start to rip and stretch out as their bellies got bigger and bigger. And not only were their bellies big but they also felt very firm and taut, unlike bloating or fat. She did not understand what was happening to her but she was more focused on making sure no one was laughing or gossiping about them behind her backs.<br />
<br />
She went to the cafeteria and started eating two plates of spaghetti. Having consumed one plate a thin waif of a teenager with dark brown, almost black hair, sat down. It was a student wearing a pencil shirt and top that showed her lean body, muscled and at the same time feminine. Her chest pushed into her fabric of her shirt. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Erika.&quot; Chloe mumbled<br />
<br />
&quot;You have sauce&quot; she indicated to her chin. <br />
<br />
&quot;-thanks&quot; she slurped .<br />
<br />
&quot;You have been infected-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What!&quot; Chloe nearly choked<br />
<br />
&quot;You are pregnant-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No I am not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;-you will notice it sooner rather than later. I don&#39;t (she spoke over Chloe) who did this to you but they are working against me. You aren&#39;t one of mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One of your what?&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chosen, my harem.&quot; Erika sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is going on Erika?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You need to get home before it (she pointed at her stomach) gets the better of you. Alyssa Kendall has already suffered due to their interference.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that Erika got up and left, she had some kind of power over Chloe. Underneath the table she had thrust her hands in between her thighs as she squirmed on her seat and her nipples felt rock hard.<br />
<br />
Throughout the rest of the day, Chloe continued to grow and swell and expand, though the whole time they seemed unaware of what was truly happening to them. Every eye was on Chloe as she waddled down the hallway, her clothes getting close to ripping and bursting apart to contain her obviously pregnant body. Her belly button was now a large popped out nub and it pushed through her shirt, sticking out plainly and prominently as she slowly made her way around the library. At 3pm she had to undo the strap on her bra and her breasts, now engorged with milk to the point that they were the size of basketballs and her large dark nipples could be seen through the increasingly thin and stretched out fabric of her top.<br />
<br />
 But no matter how big and round and full she got, or how much she was starting to feel a strange fluttering inside of her belly that was actually kicking and stirring from her many unborn lietter now full term in her womb, with more added gradually throughout the day, she still would not notice what was happening to her. Her selfishness and her vanity would not allow her to do so.<br />
<br />
Chloe just smiled and purred as she saw all the attention she was getting. She was still ignorant of just how large and swollen she had gotten and thought that everyone was staring and gawking at her.<br />
<br />
Tony an assistant Librarian could not ignore how big and sexy her swollen breasts were now and her skin was now glowing and vibrant thanks to her pregnancy hormones but he could not get past that big belly of hers. He smiled nervously and gulped as he looked at her pregnant curves. <br />
<br />
Then, Chloe felt a strange jolt inside of her belly and touching her palm against her stomach. &quot;Ooof, weird gas today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was that a kick?&quot; Carmen asked as she passed by, adding in a mocking laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;A kick? What the fuck are you talking about?&quot; Chloe huffed, waddling away with her friends. &quot;I swear, everyone is acting so weird today. I can&#39;t wait to get home.&quot;<br />
<br />
She tried to get into a college&#39;s car but could not fit her belly behind the steering wheel. After half of the school day went by Chloe was looking like she had an over inflated beach ball inside of her womb. But as big and round and fertile as they looked and despite the feeling of fetal kicks inside of their bellies, the woman still did not understand what was happening to them.<br />
<br />
Chloe wrestled with her car and groaned, finally giving up on fitting in. &quot;My stupid car&#39;s seat is broken or something! I have got to call AAA.&quot; Gina huffed, pulling out her cellphone and ordering pizza instead.<br />
<br />
Chloe got a full stack of take out pizzas delivered and ate them at her home, she would never strip again. As she ate, she continued to swell, her pregnancy progressing at a steady rate. Chloe could hear the normally durable fabric in her dress groan and stretch to try and accommodate her they were getting close to bursting apart. She winced as she felt her skirt cutting in to her sensitive underbelly and her own butt, while her breasts were nearly exposed from how tight her chest was against her top and she was half an inch away from her dress riding up past her knees and revealing her bare, glowing, smooth pregnant stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something is really feeling strange in my stomach today,&quot; Chloe moaned, her palm stroking her firm, round curves. &quot;Like I have some sort of weird bug in my gut.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chloe could not fit through the door to get in to one of her own flat, which made some residents audibly gasp as they watched. That made her blush and run away, or waddle away as quickly as she could at least.<br />
<br />
Chloe was even bigger now, her belly as big as a mattress and still perfectly round and smooth. She moaned and wrapped her hands as far around her ripe stomach as she could. It was true: she had been in denial all day but she looked like an extremely pregnant woman and she could feel her skin and muscles swell and stretch as she continued to grow. Erika had told her but she felt compelled to return to the Library, there was some power that held her there.<br />
<br />
Babies. The word made Jenna shudder as she moved both hands to her own stomach, moving her palms around and feeling the unborn babies she was carrying kick and flip and swim around inside of her womb. &quot;I&#39;m pregnant! Really I am pregnant! It is so surreal and weird and...and I do not know how this happened!&quot; She moaned and moved her hands to her underbelly, feeling just how heavy and tight her stomach was. &quot;I do not want to be a mother! I am not ready! I hate babies!&quot;<br />
<br />
Even though she was 47 years old.<br />
<br />
With a mighty ripping sound, her clothes finally burst off, unable to contain her huge, swollen pregnant body. her dress ripped open down the front and back as her thick, swollen belly button pushed out and it tore the rest of the top of her skirt off as her pregnant belly triumphantly surged out. Her ass cheeks were also finally too much for her panties and they exploded out with tatters of fabric as her bare butt stuck out. With one deep exhale, their thick thighs and wide hips did the rest of the work leaving her exposed and undressed.<br />
<br />
Less than 24 hours before she had stood bare naked, but strong and sexy on the stage at the Out Club..Now she stood naked in the middle of the library, her smooth pregnant belly out in the open and her engorged, heavy breasts barely contained in her now woefully small bra. <br />
<br />
Before she find cover. Two simultaneous kicks to the bladder and the cervix made Chloe grunt and double over, clutching her huge pregnant belly before she looked up at Erika. &quot;You! You did this to me you bitch!&quot;<br />
<br />
Erika closed the distance and whispered in Chloe&#39;s ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bitch, you are. My bitch, I told you to fucking go home, but you stayed. I wash my hands of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still getting bigger! My belly is already so tight and so sore! I am so big and so pregnant!&quot; Chloe wailed, her stomach surging forward an extra inch as her voice grew. Her breasts rested on top of her ripe stomach like a shelf and her ass cheeks were now so big, they looked like an ordinary pregnant woman&#39;s full term stomach.<br />
<br />
Erika had been right, Chloe suddenly realized. She wasn&#39;t one of her friends, Melissa or Emily. She had been exposed to something that had not had time to turn her into what she had to become.</p>
