<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">'what was that noise?' Ian thought to himself. The loud thumping... seemed to calm down a bit. 'what the hell?' he thought to himself. The thumping clearly reminded him of sex. He thought about it for just a second when he started to feel a little odd. Suddenly he felt warmth in his crotch. His respectable 7&quot; cock grew by .7 of an inch in that second, then followed by a sudden tightening of his shirt and pants. &quot;what the fuck&quot; he said aloud. He watched his body as it seemed to expand in front of him. At 140 pounds, Ian felt the pounds adding on. He felt it strongly on his chest and arms, but they soon spread to his shoulders, stomach and legs. &quot;What the fuck!&quot; he exclaimed again. His shirt was tightening, and he could clearly see an outline of his pecs. He had gained, in the matter of a few seconds 14 pounds. now he weighed 154. Not a huge gain, but noticeable. <br />
<br />
At 70 inches tall ( 5' 10&quot; ) he felt something else, something odd. He began to grow. His legs lengthened, his arms grew in length, and his feet and hands grew rapidly. He looked at himself in awwe. &quot;Jesus! im.... grow---ing...&quot; those 7 inches had added several pounds to his frame. He now weighed 188 pounds. Skinny, and very tall, but heavier. Ian's shirt now only went down to his belly button, and felt absurdly small. His sleeves were stuck at mid-forearm. His pants were so uncomfortable, and now far too short for him. He proceeded to peel the uncomfortably small pants off of him. Ian stood up, now only in boxers and a short shirt,  out of his chair, unable to believe what was happening to him. He looked around, everything was different from his new, taller perspective. Everything, the chair, the coffee table, everything looked smaller and shorter. &quot;this... it...s its unreal...&quot; he mumbled. He looked down again. He knew he had grown, *everywhere* so he reached his large hands down into his pants to feel if there was a noticeable difference. He felt it, or at least he thought he felt a difference. The idea of masturbation then crossed his mind. <br />
<br />
It started swelling again, right in his hands. His manhood expanded from 7.7&quot; to 8.4&quot; and then larger still as he had thought about it for at least 2 seconds... and it grew to 9.25&quot; He felt massive. His growth then continued to his body. He gained muscle rapidly. His pecs continued to grow larger and rounder, and began straining his shirt substantially. His arms beefed up and despite their length, and he looked surprisingly built. His weight increased from 188 to 206.8 pounds. Then the growth continued and his basketball-star body became a little more muscular. Soon he had increased to about 227.5 pounds at 6'5&quot;. He looked good. His shirt, however, was suffering. His upper body was bound by a now too small shirt, and it felt constricting on his enlarging frame.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ty!&quot; he exclaimed, but no answer. Then the third phase began. His body began to grow in length once again. His muscles elongated to fit his lengthening arms and legs. He lost any bulkiness but looked still very strong and fit. His biceps bulged as he moved his arm. His body was growing taller and taller, and his feet had grown from a regular size 11 to a huge size 18. His shirt, now began to tear along the back, and then fell off of him onto the carpeted floor. He now stood at a slight bit over 7 feet. Everything was so small to him. What was going on?!? &quot;Ty!&quot; he yelled again, but now his voice had become deeper. At first he didn’t recognize the sound of his own voice! Everything was so weird, it was like a dream. Was he awake? He wondered: 'Is it a dream?' his weight, due to his increase in height, had jumped to 288 pounds.  He looked down at himself, he felt so massive. <br />
<br />
&quot;I’m huge!&quot; he cried. Just then, Ty appeared. He descended the stairs with a look of awwe on his face. Ian really was huge, and unfortunately for him, almost completely naked. His boxers had scrunched up around the tops of his wide thighs, the outline of his now huge manhood clearly visible. &quot;Ty! You gotta help!&quot; Ian pleaded.  Ty didn’t know what to do. A mischievous smirk spread across Ty’s face. <br />
<br />
“Ok, Ian, I’ll see what I can do”</p>
