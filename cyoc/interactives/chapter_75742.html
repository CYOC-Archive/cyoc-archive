<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Wait,&quot; said Morgana pausing to gaze in a pocket looking glass, &quot;That's Princess Constance's father's army?&quot; <br />
She snickered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go back into the keep and unpack, we're going to have some fun,&quot; Morgana chuckled. Then she held up the <br />
jarred princess, and asked, &quot;I should have asked what country you were a princess of before I panicked. An <br />
army indeed, perhaps more than a tenth of your nation's population march against us, but your country is Grand <br />
Piggywiffle has a scant population of 250 men, women and children. I can deal with an army that size with my <br />
eyes closed. And most of them look to be farmers and laborers that your father drafted into service.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maedel asked, &quot;Thirty men is an awful lot, are you sure we shouldn't flee?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, I can flatten the lot with one hand.  When she said army, I pictured thousands of troops. I <br />
overestimated her, as much as she underestimated me. Haha,&quot; Morgana said. Then waving her hand she shouted, <br />
&quot;Inside now! They'll be here soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your highness, are you sure that we should be doing this?  Perhaps you should offer Constance's hand in <br />
marriage to the valiant prince who rescues her?  That's what most kings do,&quot; said Sir Victor, as his armor <br />
clanked.  The armor had been made for him when he was young and robust, but he had shrunken with age, and now <br />
it hung loosely on his frame.<br />
<br />
&quot;Prince Valiant prefers men to women, why would he rescue her? No, no, I have to do it myself. Besides I have <br />
a plan for dealing with Morgana. Tell the guardsmen to turn right at the crossroads,&quot; King Constantine <br />
ordered. <br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't mean Prince Valiant, sire, I meant - but Morgana's keep is left at the crossroads,&quot; befuddled Sir <br />
Victor said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, she is left, and my army is going right. Understand?  Now make sure they go the direction, I ordered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sire.&quot;  He wanted to ask if they were still going after the princess.  Perhaps the king meant to raise <br />
more troops from the villages along the other road. Victor delivered the orders.<br />
<br />
High in her tower, Morgana gazed at the road leading to her keep. The army should be here any minute she <br />
thought rubbing her hands together. Time always seemed to go so slowly when you were waiting for something to <br />
happen.  An hour passed, and she started to pace. Finally, she teleported to her mirror to see what had become <br />
of the army she planned to turn into playing cards. She stared at the progression of the army, and soon <br />
realized they had taken the wrong path.  She laughed so hard she fell on her rump.<br />
<br />
&quot;They took the wrong road.  Some rescue,Princess!&quot; she laughed, &quot;And I was worried about them?&quot;<br />
<br />
She decided to turn her attentions on Princess Connie, and not worry about the army. They were no threat.<br />
<br />
The king ordered his men to form an encampment. Then he took his most trusted men: Ardent the Fowler, Jolly <br />
the Jester, Marcus the Smith and Sir Willem (the youngest knight). <br />
<br />
&quot;Sir Victor, you are in charge of the men, while we are away,&quot; the king said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But sire, I should go with you,&quot; Victor protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need you here my trusted liege man, you are the most experienced of my men, and will have the camp running <br />
smoothly when I return.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was an old but long disused path that the king and his four trusted companions ventured down.  The wood was <br />
black with age, and dense. More than once a sword was used to clear the path.  The dense trees all around made <br />
the path's direction clear in spite of the brush.  The wood was entirely silent except for the noise of the <br />
armed men.  At last they came to a clearing. There on a stump in the middle of the clearing roosted a black <br />
bird. The fowler readied a snare, but the king stayed him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What brings you this way, king?&quot; challenged the bird.<br />
<br />
&quot;I seek assistance against the witch Morgana. She holds my daughter Constance captive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still playing her same old tricks, I see. Well, if you will do me a favor, I will help you,&quot; said the bird. <br />
&quot;But beware the favor I will ask is not without risk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My companions and I will do your favor in exchange for your boon, oh wise black bird,&quot; the king said.  His <br />
companions looked askance, but were quiet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Verily, go down the path between the two birch trees, and you will find an ogre. He has stolen my fine gold <br />
cloth.  Bring it to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish,&quot; the king nodded, and led his companions down the path between the white trees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sire,&quot; whispered the fowler when he thought they were out of earshot, &quot;Can a bird's help really defeat <br />
Morgana?  And is it worth tangling with an ogre?  I hear they have transformation spells.  We might all end up <br />
worms for the bird to eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The blackbird is not unknown to my family.  She is in fact a family secret.  She doesn't care for the ogre, <br />
but I suspect he too may become an ally, and an ogre will give Morgana pause.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sire,&quot; said the fowler thoughtfully.<br />
<br />
They came out into a large clearing surrounded by blackberry bushes.  It appeared deserted, but the king <br />
stayed his men bidding them not to enter.  He perceived that the clearing was encircled by mushrooms or <br />
toadstools, and he could smell the magic at work.  He drew his sword and buried it cross wise in the circle <br />
breaking it.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, they beheld that the clearing was not so clear.  Trenches filled with pickets and skeletons of <br />
adventurers appeared before them. Beyond the trenches was a black stone hut. <br />
<br />
&quot;Clever, knight,&quot; said an oily voice from no place in particular.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, you must be the great ogre of whom we have heard such acclaim,&quot; said the king loudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have heard of me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed, we were told that you had some yellow cloth or was it gold for sale, and I need to purchase a <br />
suitable tribute for the evil witch Morgana to ransom my daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gold cloth?  The bird sent you,&quot; said Ogre, &quot;But she wants the cloth for herself, and you want it for <br />
Morgana. Heh, heh, oh, this will be fun, for you have to get by her to get to Morgana.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's only a blackbird,&quot; whispered the fowler.<br />
<br />
The ogre snickered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I might just sell you the cloth.  If you give it to the bird, I can always steal it again.  If you give <br />
it to Morgana, I'll just steal it from her. Now let me tell you my price,&quot; the ogre said materializing just on <br />
the other side of the trench.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were that carrion beetle,&quot; said the king.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can be many things. If you want the cloth, you must go on a quest for me. It will be dangerous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want the cloth, but tell me of the quest first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You must go down the path by the dead oak, and retrieve from the dragon who lives in the cave at the end of <br />
that path my gold skull cap.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dr-r-ragon?&quot; whispered the jester nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;A gold skull cap is worth more than any cloth,&quot; said the king, &quot;We will get your skull cap in exchange for <br />
the cloth and for your aid against Morgana.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You will end up dragon fodder, but if you survive and retrieve the cap, I will gladly aid you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Ogre, now may we pass to take that path?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You must stay outside the circle of mushrooms, if you or your companions step inside the circle then <br />
transformed will the transgressor be.&quot;<br />
<br />
So the men hugged the edge of the clearing, and worked their way around to the path the ogre had designated. <br />
Just as the king and his companions reached the path one of the men slipped on a loose stone and fell <br />
backwards into the ring of toad stools. He vanished, and in his place...</p>
