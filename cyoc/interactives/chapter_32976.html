<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A big mans company<br />
<br />
Dave looks on as his boss continues to change. The Turtle neck sweater, now skin tight, began to change in texture and design. The neckline receded down into the garment leaving a neck opening larger than normal. It swooped down to the sternum exposing part of Chris’s hairless pecs. The trapezes muscles could now rise up higher unobstructive out of the opening as well. The sweater has now been changed into Under Armour shirt with accent panels setting off the body’s best features. It made the chest and back look bigger while the waist looked trimmer.<br />
<br />
“Dave, are you alright?” Chris asks again.<br />
<br />
“Oh. Ah. Sure I’m fine.” Replies Dave. “I was just thinking of the big bulge . . . I mean the Biggalow account.”<br />
<br />
“Which is why I’m here. They are the best company in the fitness industry. I've been using their products for years. How do you think I got so big?” Says Chris as he does a double bicep pose.<br />
<br />
“You do look like you are in good shape.” Dave says as he tries to hide his excitement. “How long have you been working out?”<br />
<br />
“I think I was around 5 years old when I picked up my 2 pound weight.” Chris strokes a make believe set of chin whiskers. He then goes into a most muscular. “Not bad for a forty-year-old” <br />
<br />
“Forty! You don’t look a day over twenty five.” Dave reaches under his desk to adjust himself.<br />
<br />
“Thanks for the compliment. I get them all the time. Now back to why I’m here.” Chris picks up the golden pen and note pad before Dave could stop him. “I’m implymenting a fitness program for the company. This is going to be your number priority and here is the to do list. All my executives are to get in better shape and I want it to start with my top exec. I want my top man to have two hundred and fifty pounds of lean muscle with a BFI of less than five percent.<br />
<br />
Dave could feel the transformation taking affect. His dress shirt was stretching tighter as his chest expanded. The sleeves of his shirt were filling out to the point of bursting. But the fabric couldn’t contain the expanding arms for long. The seams gave way with a resounding rrrrriiiiiiipppppp as the sleeve split from cuff to shoulder, exposing arms full of veins.<br />
<br />
Oblivious to what just happened Chris continues to write on the pad. “You will need build up your legs with striated muscle until each one is as big as your waist. You will also build up your ass into buns of steel.”<br />
<br />
Dave’s legs grew to twice their current size and then some. His entire body was now covered with a road map of veins under tissue paper thin skin. He had to shift his position forward in his office chair to make room for both his huge thighs.<br />
<br />
“Oh! And speaking of your waist.” Chris adds to the to do list. “You will develop your mid section into a perfect set of eight pack abs that any man would want to have.”<br />
<br />
Dave felt his abs contract like a he was doing a never-ending ab crunching sit-up. Once again he had to adjust his posture in the chair when his ass muscles grew adding to his seated height.<br />
<br />
Dave let out a soft moan escape from his mouth. He was enjoying his transformation so much that he almost cummed in his tight dress pants. His cock was hard in shorts. Good thing he was seated or he would be tenting in front of his hot looking boss.<br />
<br />
Chris was unaware of the changes that had just happened right under his nose to his top exec. To him, Dave was always built like a bodybuilder. After all that is why he hired him.<br />
<br />
“You know Dave I like my men big.” Chris was now idling drawing a picture of Dave on the pad in his hand. “And they need to be dressed in very tight clothing so they can show off their bodies.”<br />
<br />
In his younger days he was an accomplished artist and made enough money to help pay his way through collage. These days he only did it when he was in a boring meeting. <br />
<br />
In his drawing his dream guy had a muscular chest covered in a skintight tank top made lycra-spandex. The pants worn by the man in the drawing were just as tight and just as reveling. Chris had just about completed his sketch of his dream guy when he thought of just one more thing to add. As a finishing touch he added a twelve-inch bulge. <br />
<br />
Dave’s cock was elongating down one pant leg closer to his knee. The longer it got the thicker it got. His cock was only half as thick as his wrist but it was still soft. Dave was wondering how big it would get when it got hard when Chris came around the desk, catching him off guard.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Now that’s more like it.” Chris says. <br />
<br />
Before Chris in the chair, dressed in skin tight Lycra-Spandex, sat his dream guy. Chris looks down at the long bulge in Dave’s tight pant leg. He reaches down and gives it a gentle squeeze. The effects his actions were almost immediate as the bulge began to double in size.<br />
<br />
Looked up at crotch before him he sees that it was getting bigger too. “I see that you are just as pleased with things are as I am.” Dave says with a grin.</p>
