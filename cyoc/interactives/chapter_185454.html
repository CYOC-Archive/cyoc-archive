<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ken, stood by then as wholly dumbfounded, he wanted to speak but all he could muster out his mouth was a bray.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anna dear, don&#39;t you like what you have done to Ken, your brother?&quot; Circe&#39;s mentality asked of Anna. &quot;Oh dear girl, but how seem as frightened, nervous too, you stand there wiggling. Was it not fun and funny to see Ken transforming, as he strikes quite the virile pose of a partially aroused male donkey. See there, look at his sheath, note how about six inches of limp donkey blunt ended penis hangs near ready to bloom at the slightest reason for him to become as fully aroused.<br />
<br />
Bolster your mindset, as all men are animals and from my ideals, they should look proper to how they act. Besides, Ken deserved it for all the mean things he did to you!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But, what about our parents, what will they think when seeing of Ken, their son to him being like he his?&quot; Anna felt unsure she had done what was righteous; having her brother as being furry, gained a tail and the genitals of a stud male donkey. She stood gawking, taking a mental inventory of her brother then an animal. &quot;He never was a beast toward me, a pain true enough, but this, he being a donkey, virile as hell and outwardly a common farm animal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you fret, as through you I will take care of Ken and enhance his sense of male animal ambitions for being dominant toward his herd animals, jennies, mares, and a few perverse whores what come seeking him by night.&quot;<br />
Circe reiterated her thoughts to Anna, as continually working at controlling Anna; until at some later date in time when she Circe and Anna became as one together.<br />
<br />
A moment later and Mr. Nelson, Anna&#39;s father did walk into the bedroom. &quot;Anna, is something wrong, I thought I heard a rather terse to ragged screamed sound..., what is that donkey doing being here in your bedroom?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Nelson stood there eyeing the full-grown, a mature male donkey sporting a limp six inches long erection; while the donkey seemed to shiver from its fearing seeing of the man there in the bedroom. &quot;Anna, you know better than to allow donkey Ken to come inside the house, and especially having him be in your bedroom, he is not housebroke and could at any time create quite a mess that you would need to clean it up!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad please, that&#39;s not a common as ignorant donkey, it is Ken!&quot; Anna exclaimed loudly, her anxiousness about the donkey as verbally evident from her tone of voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that you named him in honor of your deceased brother, and considering how much that Ken did act like a blithering jackass, well, I think Ken is a good name for your pet donkey!<br />
<br />
However, he really should not be in the house; so be a good girl and take him back to the barn.&quot; Mr. Nelson said as he so loved his daughter, and rarely showed his anger for what she did or the really foolishness of being young. &quot;I would appreciate your not mentioning this situation to your mother. It has taken a toll on her, the disappearance of your brother, she has forgotten about Ken, ceasing to think about him as part of her daily stream of thoughts<br />
<br />
If Ken were born a donkey and not as my son, much of the world we as a family live in could have seemed brighter and happier.&quot;<br />
<br />
The hearing of his dad speaking poorly about him, had Ken even being a donkey then thought differently about Anna as kind for changing him to be a donkey. Ken was not thinking well about his dad, and moved a little, his hoofs clopping about as he stepping, turned tail toward his father. Ken felt angry thoughts, and braying, was still scared about how he would need to live daily, being physically a horny Jackass; thought his Dad was going too far when he told Anna that her brother would have made the world as better if he, Ken were a donkey animal!<br />
<br />
Circe chuckled softly, her humored thoughts almost escaping out the mouth of Anna.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kenny hear me, as I am the spirit of Circe, that Greek witch who appreciated men best when they became as pigs. <br />
<br />
I know about your thoughts, they are the same as were other men, you now fighting with beastly instincts, trying desperately to retain your senses and sanity. It won&#39;t be long there Kenny before those sensual as lusty desires of a male donkey acting like any common Jackass, as sex with female equines feeling their estrus will envelope your cock with a hot and as rippling muscular vagina, shall suck your semen from those weighty big balls.&quot;<br />
<br />
A loving father turned and walked away, he leaving Anna to her tugging the reins, pulling to lead Ken from her bedroom and outside the house, he better kept in the barn. &quot;Tug tug,&quot; as Anna turned and looked Ken in the face. &quot;You do as I say, or you shall find this bodily form of being a Jackass stud donkey to be as yours..., well for a longtime until I find my true love and bare my first kid,&quot; Anna grumbled; as she noted how the ring glowed and the bargain became as mutually sealed with Ken remaining a Jackass for years of him to cum, as cum, breeding!<br />
<br />
&quot;Anna, you foolish girl, what have you done to us, binding Ken&#39;s fate to your own, this was not wise for our future, said Circe&#39;s mental voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, like what did I say that was so wrong,&quot; Anna asked just as Ken budged, he turning his bulk self to willingly let his sister take him to the barn.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was how you phrased your wish for Ken to remain as a donkey; you mentioning the word &quot;Kid!<br />
<br />
A woman bares children, but a nanny goat births her kids; expect then soon your body to begin as changing, you and I becoming a doe goat animal. You specified nothing in the wish about retaining your mental state, so expect to become an ignorant goat, living by instincts and urges. As you change us, you were sly to mention as finding your true love; as think, your father&#39;s farm has goats but no buck males for breeding, he artificially has the Veterinarian inseminate his goats to keep the goat milk flowing. <br />
<br />
We might live as a dumb doe goat for years before allowed to mating, be bred penis-inserted by a buck goat. You shall age then quickly, maturing within three years to equal that of a forty year old woman; as such beyond her years of fertility and child bearing.<br />
<br />
I suggest that you ask, beg, plead for your father to buy a Billy goat to breed, it mating with us, and we having you birth your first Kid!&quot;</p>
