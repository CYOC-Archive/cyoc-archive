<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mannick&#39;s gaze snapped to the cashier, his eyes narrowing slightly. The question was innocent enough, but something about the way the words hit his ears was... off. He could feel the tug of reality trying to reshape itself around him, a byproduct of his leaked magic. He had to be careful not to let it get out of hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll grab some... snacks,&quot; he murmured, his deep voice echoing through the otherwise quiet store. He picked up a bag of chips and a bottle of soda, trying to keep his movements nonchalant. The cashier, a young man with a name tag that read &#39;Luis&#39;, eyed him curiously as he approached the counter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Certainly, Lord Mithral,&quot; the cashier said with a hint of awe, his eyes lingering on the intricate patterns of the armor.<br />
<br />
Mannick&#39;s heart skipped a beat. Did he just... Did he call me that? He glanced around the store, expecting the guard to jump up and attack him or for the lights to flicker with more reality-bending shifts. Nothing happened. The guard remained slumped in his chair, scrolling through his phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-how do you know me?&quot; he stuttered, setting his items on the counter. The cashier looked up, his eyes gleaming with excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, everyone knows the great Lord Mithral!&quot; Luis said with a grin. &quot;Your legend is spreading across the lands, my lord! Your valor in battle, your wisdom in strategy, your...uh, your... well, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
The chips and soda on the counter change before Mannick&#39;s eyes. The bag of chips morphs into a pouch filled with what appears to be golden nuggets of enchanted corn, the logo on the bag now depicting a grinning, corn husk-wearing gnome holding a wand. The bottle of soda transforms into an elegant crystal flask, its contents swirling with a mysterious blue liquid that seems to glow from within. The label reads &quot;Elixir of Refreshment,&quot; and the cap has been replaced by a cork stopper sealed with a wax emblem of the frat house&#39;s crest.<br />
<br />
The cashier&#39;s eyes widen in amazement as he reaches for the flask. &quot;Whoa, this is some high-quality stuff!&quot; He says, his voice filled with a mix of wonder and excitement. As his hand touches the crystal, his costume begins to change. The plastic action figure attire starts to become real, fusing with his skin as if it was always meant to be there. The fabric of his shirt rips away, revealing a gleaming, sculpted chest with &#39;LUIS&#39; emblazoned across the top, and his limbs become more defined, complete with bulging muscles and intricate armor details. His name tag morphs into a golden plate hanging around his neck, the letters engraved into it.<br />
<br />
Mannick&#39;s eyes dart to the register, and he watches in horror as it too begins to transform. The digital display flickers and reshapes itself into a glowing crystal, casting rainbow patterns across the counter. The plastic and metal give way to gleaming brass and ornate carvings. The buttons are replaced by a series of mystical runes that pulse with a soft light, and the cash drawer opens with a dramatic &#39;whoosh&#39; sound, revealing not money, but a hoard of gold coins that clink and clank together.<br />
<br />
The counter beneath them starts to shiver and shift. The mundane plastic and wood morph into a glossy, black stone surface, veined with streaks of silver and gold. The edges of the counter curve and rise, forming a battle-ready barricade that would be more at home in a dwarven stronghold than a convenience store. The candy display behind Luis rattles and reorders itself, the sugary treats morphing into gleaming jewels and amulets that dangle from the shelves, each one emanating an alluring aura.<br />
<br />
Mannick&#39;s heart raced as he felt the very fabric of reality bend to his will. The cashier, Luis, had turned into a living action figure, his costume now a gleaming suit of enchanted armor that fit him like a glove. The snacks he had been stocking now looked like they could grant mythical powers.<br />
<br />
Luis, seemingly unfazed by his new form, finished scanning a customer&#39;s items and handed them over with a smile. Mannick couldn&#39;t believe his eyes—his magic was spreading and changing the very store around him. He had to find Merlin. Now.<br />
<br />
The floor beneath his boots shifted from the standard linoleum to a glossy stone, veined with shimmering silver that echoed with every step he took. The fluorescent lights flickered and dimmed, replaced by floating orbs of soft blue light that cast a serene glow over the aisles, making every product appear more epic and mystical. Even the air felt heavier with enchantment, a faint tingle dancing on his armor-plated skin.<br />
<br />
Mannick watched in shock as the shelves grew taller, the packaged goods giving way to racks of gleaming weapons and armor. The snack aisle had become a veritable cornucopia of mystical delights—enchanted apples that restored vitality, chips that granted temporary invisibility, and sodas that bestowed the strength of a hundred men. The chill of the refrigerators transformed into a gentle coolness that whispered of ancient spells and hidden knowledge.<br />
<br />
The guard, who had yet to acknowledge the bizarre transformations around him, began to shift as well. His plastic green hat morphed into an actual helmet, complete with a gleaming golden crest, and his uniform transformed into a suit of scaled armor that looked like it had been forged from the very essence of myth. The guard&#39;s eyes lit up with an ancient wisdom, and his posture straightened as if he had been a sentinel for centuries.<br />
<br />
His human body vanished leaving a enchanted suit of armor in its place, the kind that could tell tales of epic battles and forgotten legends. The transformation was complete, and He now went by the name of Sir Green, the guardian of the store&#39;s peace.<br />
<br />
Mannick stared at the two workers, now fully realized as mythical beings. &quot;What... what did I do?&quot; he murmured to himself, his voice echoing in the cavernous helmet.<br />
<br />
&quot;We hope this helps you Lord Mithral,&quot; Luis said, his voice now resonating like it came from a speaker. &quot;the golden corn will help the party by sexualizing it more. Elixir of Refreshment will keep the party going all night.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mannick nodded absently, his eyes drawn to the doors and windows of the store. The glass had transformed into stained glass depictions of erotic scenes from ancient Greek mythology. The doors, once plain and metal, had morphed into intricate wooden portals, carved with scenes of satyrs frolicking with nymphs. The metal handles had become gold-plated and curved into the shapes of entwined serpents.<br />
<br />
He ran to the bathroom in an attempt to calm down. The purple lights he has for his eyes worried him as they dimmed slightly.<br />
<br />
The part of him that was manny or as he was now called lord Servant didn&#39;t see anything wrong, while the part of him that was Nick felt awful he had brought those men into this. Sir Green was always so loyal, and Louis... Mannick shook his head as the runes on him glowed.<br />
<br />
Beneath his boots, the tiles grew warm and shifted into a velvety surface, the walls adorned with gold-leaf patterns that swirled and danced with every step he took. The once plain bathroom mirrors transformed into ornate frames, the glass reflecting not just his image but a world of sensual delights. The soap dispenser grew a pair of cherubic hands, offering up a frothy concoction that smelled faintly of oyster and champagne.<br />
<br />
The bathroom around him grew more decadent with each passing second. The once plain porcelain sink now gleamed with a golden finish, the faucet a serpentine dragon&#39;s head that spouted water that glittered with an arcane sheen. The paper towel dispensers had morphed into elegant wooden stands with plush, velvety towels embroidered with the TFU insignia. The light fixtures grew elaborate, casting a warm, seductive glow that painted everything in an erotic tint. The walls, once a dull gray, now boasted lurid murals of mythical beings in passionate embraces, the colors so vibrant they seemed to pulse with the rhythm of his racing heart.<br />
<br />
The toilet and urinals grew into thrones of velvet and gold, the water in the urinals swirling with rainbow colors as if it had been enchanted by a playful fairy. The stall door vanished as the dividers morphed into walls covered in velvety fabric, each with a different color scheme and intricate tapestries depicting scenes of mythical beings in passionate embraces. The air grew thick with the scent of musk and desire, the very essence of the enchanted realm that Lord Mithral was slowly bringing to life around him.<br />
<br />
Exiting the bathroom Mannick was shocked to see the changed store was now even more magical and sexual. The shelves once stocked with simple snacks now groaned under the weight of exotic fruits that shimmered with iridescent lights, each one looking ripe for the plucking. The candy aisle had transformed into a veritable Willy Wonka&#39;s paradise, with edible underwear and chocolate body paints that promised to bring pleasure beyond imagination. The cashier&#39;s desk had grown into a grand altar of commerce, adorned with velvet and gold leaf, and Luis, now a living action figure, was dressed in a skimpy loincloth that left little to the imagination.<br />
<br />
The guard, now Sir Green, had taken on a more imposing presence, his armor gleaming with an unearthly light that cast an emerald hue across the store. His eyes had become crystalline, swirling with an otherworldly energy that seemed to hint at his newfound power. The once bored guard now stood proudly, his posture that of a sentinel, as if daring anyone to question the legitimacy of the new store.<br />
<br />
Mannick&#39;s heart would&#39;ve pounded out of his chest if he still had one, but instead, his armor clanked slightly with each breath he took. The store had transformed around him, now clearly branded with the TFU insignia and adorned with the erotic vibes of the frat house he had so desperately tried to escape. The shelves were now lined with enchanted lube, potions promising to enhance stamina and pleasure, and edible underwear that looked suspiciously like they were made from the same material as the pledges&#39; costumes.<br />
<br />
The cashier, now an enchanted action figure, eyed him with a mix of awe and confusion, his plastic features seemingly frozen in a smile that never quite reached his eyes. The guard, fully engulfed in the transformation into Sir Green, nodded slightly in recognition as if they had all just completed a secret handshake.<br />
<br />
Mannick knew he had to leave before the changes got out of hand. He couldn&#39;t risk being discovered by anyone who could link the transformation back to him. The cashier, Luis, was ringing up a customer, his plastic hands moving with surprising dexterity over the keys of the register. The customer, a young woman, didn&#39;t think twice about the two enchanted armors and the action figure ringing her up. However, Sir Green altered him to the fact that she was an interloper and a potential problem.<br />
<br />
The woman, seemingly oblivious to the fantastical beings around her, was dressed in a simple hoodie and jeans. She paid for her items with a casual swipe of her credit card, receiving a bag that now had a faint glow. As she left, she thanked Luis in a daze, not noticing the way her hoodie had subtly shifted to hug her curves more tightly or the way her jeans had turned into tight leather pants with a small TFU emblem stitched into the side. The reality outside the store was slowly being reshaped by the frat house&#39;s influence, and it was spreading like a ripple in a pond.<br />
<br />
He tried to fight as he approached her from behind, sword at the ready, but his body betrayed him. His sword arm trembled as it arced downward, the enchanted blade pointing straight at the woman&#39;s back. She was unaware of his approach, lost in the haze of magic that had infiltrated her mind from the items she had just purchased.<br />
<br />
With an internal grimace, his arm jerked forward, and the sword plunged into her flesh with no sound. The woman screamed, not from pain, but from the sudden surge of power that filled her. The sword didn&#39;t slice through her; it simply phased into her as if she were made of water. Her eyes widened in shock, and she turned to face him, the sword sticking out of her back, his grip still on the hilt.<br />
<br />
The woman&#39;s body convulsed as the sword sank into her, the metal seemingly dissolving into her flesh as if it were a mere extension of her own. Her eyes rolled back in ecstasy, and she let out a guttural moan that echoed through the now-quiet store. The transformation was complete. The customer was no longer a mere mortal but a creature of myth and magic, a satyr, with a pair of horns crowning his newly formed masculine head, a tail swishing erotically behind him, and his clothing burned away by invisible flames to reveal a physique sculpted like the statues of ancient gods.<br />
<br />
The satyr arched his back, and the room seemed to pulse with otherworldly energy as he reached the peak of his transformation. The sword slid out from his body without sound and a fountain of white-hot semen shot from his cock as his balls emptied. The force was so intense that it left a mist in the air, coating the floor with a sticky sheen of pleasure.<br />
<br />
Mannick stared, horrified, as the satyr turned to him, a hungry look in his eyes. &quot;Oh, my Lord,&quot; he said with a sultry purr, his voice now deeper and more masculine, &quot;thanks for fixing this pledge&quot; He licked his lips, the hunger in his gaze making it clear what he thought Mannick had done.<br />
<br />
The satyr&#39;s eyes shone with adoration, mistaking Mannick&#39;s horror for a sense of accomplishment. He stepped closer, a leather wristband with intricate runes coming into view. Without a second thought, the satyr reached out and touched the band, whispering a spell that seemed to be an ancient tongue of gratitude. A soft pop echoed through the store, and a leather pouch filled with gold coins materialized in his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;For your service, my lord,&quot; the satyr said with a flourish, dropping to one knee and offering the pouch to Mannick. &quot;You have brought me the ultimate gift, and now I shall reward you in kind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mannick stared at the pouch in astonishment, his mind racing to understand the situation. He hadn&#39;t done anything to the satyr that deserved this, but the creature thought otherwise. He cautiously took the coins, feeling the weight of them in his palm. They were real, solid gold, and warm to the touch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Mannick forced out, his voice sounding gruffer than he intended due to the armor&#39;s influence. The satyr&#39;s smile grew wider, showing his new goat-like teeth. He took a step closer, his hooves clicking against the tiles that were a mosaic of mythical creatures in heat.<br />
<br />
The satyr looked around the store, his gaze lingering on the aisles of enchanted items. &quot;I must procure something special for Lady Dryad,&quot; he said, his voice thick with desire. He grabbed a bottle of what looked like glittering nectar, the label reading &#39;Arousal Potion&#39;. &quot;This should do nicely,&quot; he purred, his eyes glinting with excitement.<br />
<br />
As the satyr approached the counter, now an elegant altar adorned with gold trim, he tossed the bottle onto the gleaming surface. The living action figure cashier, Luis, looked up, his plastic eyes widening at the sight of the new patron. Mannick&#39;s purple lights for eyes dwindled to pinpricks to know he was the cause of that.<br />
<br />
Manny&#39;s thoughts echoed in his mind, reminding him of his duty as Lord Mithral to expand the frat&#39;s influence and protect the lands from outside threats. But Mannick&#39;s humanity won out, and he knew he had to find a way to reverse this. He had to get to Merlin. The enigmatic wizard was his best hope for reversing this transformation and regaining control over his own body.<br />
<br />
Mannick&#39;s armor grew heavier, the metal seemingly aware of his inner turmoil. With a grunt, he forced himself to turn away from the enchanting sights of the store, his eyes locked onto the door. Each step felt like a battle against his very being as he approached the exit, his boots echoing through the now-fantastical marketplace. The guard, Sir Green, nodded in acknowledgment, his armor clanking as he saluted his lord.<br />
<br />
The moment Mannick stepped out into the cool night air, the magic of the emporium seemed to cling to him, as if reluctant to let go. The door swung shut with a thud that resonated through the marble-and-stone facade. He took a deep breath, tasting the faint hint of oak and pollen from the nearby forest, a stark contrast to the enchanted air within the store.<br />
<br />
Looking down, he noticed the concrete sidewalk under his boots was slowly morphing into a cobblestone path, veins of glowing moss weaving between the stones. The streetlights above began to flicker and change, their metal frames morphing into wrought iron lanterns hanging from wooden posts that grew out of the ground. The asphalt of the road stretched out before him, stretching into a dirt path that led toward the distant lights of the city.<br />
<br />
Mannick&#39;s heart raced as he realized the magnitude of his situation. If the mere presence of Lord Mithral&#39;s essence could alter the fabric of reality outside the frat house, what must be happening within the Tau Digamma Upsilon walls? The thought of his fellow students, the very fabric of the college itself, succumbing to the chaotic sexual whims of the transformation curse sent a cold shiver down his spine.<br />
<br />
He knew he needed to find Merlin, the one who could potentially reverse the changes. The mischievous wizard had started this mess, after all. But where was he? The night was quiet, save for the distant sound of laughter and music, hinting at the mundane Halloween festivities that were unfolding across the city. The question echoed in his mind, growing louder with each step he took away from the store.<br />
<br />
Mannick had last seen Merlin at the frat house, he said he was going to fix this. He had to get to the second skin and hope he was there. The problem was he didn&#39;t remember where exactly it was, and his phone was gone in this form. He cursed his luck, he needed to get there before it was too late.</p>
