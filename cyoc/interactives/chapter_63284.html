<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sean sat in front of the chronivac.  He wanted to take Dan even further.  He kept flashing back to Dan standing before him, belly hanging over his tight boxers.  His cock would stir whenever he thought about it.  Sure, he'd always been into transformation.  He never gave fat much of a thought though.  Mostly because he only usually thought about transforming himself... now though, he had a way to make it happen to other people.  For real.  <br />
<br />
  He heard the phone ring and snapped out of it, about to grab it when he heard Dan pick up.  &quot;Oh, Hey babe.  Oh yeah?  Aw... that's too bad.  Well, we'll try again this weekend.  Yep.  Sure.  Love you too.  Bye.&quot;  Then he heard footsteps plodding down the hall.  Dan was soon in his doorway.  &quot;Looks like Steph has to work tonight, so she's not coming over.  Someone called in sick or something.&quot;  He said looking relieved.<br />
<br />
  &quot;You don't seem too disappointed.&quot;  Sean said, minimizing the chronivac window with Dan's stats in it.  Dan let out an awkward chuckle.  &quot;I kind of am.  I don't think I could explain this if I tried.&quot;  He said lifting his shirt, exposing the smooth dome of his now chubby belly. &quot;At least now I have a few days to figure out what happened to me...&quot;  Sean raised an eyebrow looking at it and tried to not let Dan catch him staring.<br />
<br />
  Sean cleared his throat a little &quot;I'm sure it's nothing.  Maybe something in that thai food gave you a reaction or something.  I dunno.  Does that just make you puffy or do you put on water weight in an allergic reaction...&quot;  Dan shook his head &quot;No way this is a reaction.  This thing is flab, man.  It's fat.  No doubt about it.&quot;  He said giving it a light slap, making a ripple shake across it.  Dan felt a little thrill when he did it.  He felt a thrill showing off his new bulging belly to Sean.  He turned a bit red with embarrassment.  His member half-stiffening at the thought.  &quot;Uh, so yeah.  I'm home tonight if you wanna do anything.  That's all I wanted to say.&quot;  He gave a slight wave and walked off, turning and letting Sean see his now swollen butt in the pants that were shockingly too small for him.  Sean's mind was racing.  Thoughts of that gut sticking out.  The ripple cascading across it.  The soft bounce it had when Dan backed out of the room. Mostly thoughts of it getting bigger.  Dan getting bigger.<br />
<br />
  That settled it.  Dan had potential as a fat guy.  At least that's what Sean told himself.  He needed more.  He brought up Dan's stat window again and found weight.  The ratio was set almost entirely to fat.  No need to change that, then.  He paused a moment.  How much should Dan weigh next...  he looked at the 193.  30 pounds had been a good start...  he wanted a nice even number now though.  Biting his lip a moment, he took out the numbers and typed in 2... greedily he hoverec over the 9, but decided against it.  He hit the 5, then the 0.  250 pounds.  Dan was chubby now.  He'd be fat after this.  Then he looked at the timer.  He wanted it to be faster.  He wanted to see the results quicker.  20 minutes?  No.  10. A third of the time to gain almost twice the weight.  He grinned to himself and hit save.  The timer popping up.<br />
10:00 9:59, 9:58... at 9:48, he watched Dan's weight tick up a pound.  His grin widened.<br />
<br />
  Dan had gone back to his room.  Shirt off, he was inspecting his newfound belly.  It was somewhat soft to the touch.  Somewhere between a beer belly and pure flab.  Figures, since he never worked out, he didn't really have the muscle behind it to keep it's shape.  He was okay with that though.  He caught himself when he thought that.  Okay with being fatter than he was an hour ago.  Okay with just being fat...  he felt a tightness creeping across his ass and thighs again.  He turned white.  Not more... it stopped, hadn't it?  Was he growing again?!<br />
<br />
  He dashed over to the en suite bathroom and hopped up on his scale.  It ticked upwards, past the 163 he was used to, past the 193 he was sure he'd become, onto 202. He gulped.  It was only a brief few seconds before it ticked to 203.  He stood still, watching as it inevitably became 204.  Then 205.  He got off the scale and stood in front of the mirror, watching as his body shifted.  Getting bigger and softer right before his eyes.  He could SEE himself inflating.  His pants were too tight.  Boxers too.  He stripped down and watched the show.  Things were bulging.  Shifting. Bit by bit, going from a guy who looked like he just needed to shed a few pounds, to a guy who needed to hit the gym hard.  <br />
<br />
  His slight pecs bulged out over his stomach.  Softening.  Fighting gravity at first, but soon losing, starting to fold over his belly.  His hips widened, he grew large lovehandles.  His ass was swelling out behind him and his thighs were touching.  His arms lost all definition as they plumped.  Even his face was rounding out.  In all this softening, at least one part of him was getting harder.  He looked at his cock in the mirror, belly looming over it.  It looked shorter, thanks to a growing pad of fat behind it.  That should freak him out.  He knew that.  It just didn't.  He'd always wanted to be bigger.  Sure, from time to time he'd entertained the thought of putting on serious muscle.  But Dan knew his guilty pleasure was imagining just letting himself go, packing on the pounds, and not caring one bit about it.  <br />
<br />
  Somehow, that guilty pleasure was coming true.  His thin body was being covered in thick, soft flab.  He played with his gut a bit, feeling it's texture, it's shake and bounce.  His chest reacting slightly to each wobble he gave it.  The weight was still piling on... how fat was he getting?<br />
<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
  Sean had been waiting for the dramatic shout, when Dan realized he was really porking up, but no such shout came.  He watched the timer hit 0.  Dan's weight was 250... did it not work?  Was there some other Dan out there now panicking about his new weight?  Sean got up from the chronivac and headed down the hall to Dan's room.  He gave a knock, no response.  Did Dan go out?  The door was open a crack, and he could swear he heard Dan in there...  So he opened up.  He could hear the tap running in the en-suite, but again, the door was open a crack.  He pushed it open and gasped at what he saw.<br />
<br />
  There was Dan, on the toilet, jerking off like crazy, kneading his gut.  Eyes half closed, muttering to himself &quot;f..fuck.  250... so fuckin' fat... fuck... why's this so fucking hot to me?&quot;  Every inch of him shaking and bouncing as he went to town on himself.  <br />
<br />
  &quot;Shit, Dan, what the hell happened to you?!&quot;  Sean shouted, doing his best acting job to be surprised... in a way, he was surprised. The shock of finding Dan enjoying this... this much was enough inspiration.<br />
<br />
 Dan jumped in surprise, nearly clamoring himself into the bathtub.  &quot;SEAN, SHIT, KNOCK FIRST!&quot;  He said, scrambling to his feet, forgetting for a moment he was naked, letting Sean take in every inch of his overinflated body.  Big belly quaking.  Little brown treasure trail still apparent, leading down to a hard cock between thick thighs.  Sean looked up quickly, seeing tits and a slight second chin on his formerly thin roommate, who, in a moment of clarity realized he was naked and covered up with a bath towel.<br />
<br />
  Dan felt that twinge of embarrassment again, it made his member twitch with some excitement.  He'd been caught playing with himself over how fat he was getting, by his fit roomie.  Why did that thrill him...  He stumbled over what to say, but Sean spoke first.<br />
<br />
  &quot;fuck man... you're so fucking fat!  I can't believe how hot this is!&quot;  He shouted without even thinking.  Sean's eyes went wide.  Dan's eyebrows cocked.  The two stared at each other, realizing they'd both revealed some secret to each other.</p>
