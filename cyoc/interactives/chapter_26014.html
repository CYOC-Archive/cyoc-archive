<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now outside, Mary directed Jess out to the country road out in front of her house. &quot;Ok Jess, now go easy, I don't have a saddle and I still could slip off&quot;, Mary told Jess. Jess knew this and started off with a light trot down the easy road.<br />
<br />
 Jess, was finding that she really love going around like this. She felt powerful and strong. Once they were a little farther down the road Jess picked up her pace a little, wanting more and more to brake out into her full speed to see just how fast she could go. However she knew she couldn't go that fast as she might hurt Mary.<br />
<br />
 Mary was sensing this and got an idea. &quot;Hey Jess, keep going down this road and make the secound left turn, and then go to the 2nd farm house on the left side&quot;, Mary instructed. Jess didn't know what Mary had in mind, but she did know that Mary's family owned a small ranch out in that area, and that's probably where they would be headed.<br />
<br />
 After about 10 more minutes of galloping down the road, and taking directions from Mary, Jess finally saw the farm house to the ranch. Her and Mary had come here a couple of times when they were younger, and Mary was now the care taker of the place. Mary then got off of Jess and openned the gate so Jess could trot in.<br />
<br />
 Once inside the ranch Mary lead Jess to the corral. Mary then openned the gate to the corral and said,&quot;Now you can run as fast as you want without having to worry about the traffic on the roads, or hurting me.&quot; She was right, Mary must have read Jess's mind, and Jess was all to happy now that she could fully experience the speed and power of her new horse body. &quot;Now you have fun, I got to see how the old place is doing since I forgot to come by yesterday.&quot; And with that Mary left Jess to herself.<br />
<br />
 Jess, now in a more open area, picked up speed. She began galloping faster and faster though the corral. She loved this, as she had never experienced speed quite like this. Next she tried a few jumps, as there were a few boxes and things lying about. She bounded over all of them with ease, even with the weight of her body.<br />
<br />
 However, after sometime Jess slowed down a bit, and heard a noise comming from behind the barn of the corral, so she went to investigate. Jess went over, and using her muzzel, unlatched the door to the barn, and walked to the back. Once she reached the back, she came across a large, black stallion. She was amazed by his size and how awesome he looked in the sun light. It was also about this time that the stallion noticed Jess, and came over to her to investigate this new mare before him.<br />
<br />
 Jess decided to try and play it cool. &quot;I'm completely horse in body, so the stallion shouldn't have any problems with me&quot;, Jess thought,&quot;infact, I might be able to see how horses interact with each other when people aren't around.&quot; And as she was thinking, the stallion came over and began to sniff around her. He was looking all about her, and finally started to nip playfully at her. Jess, not know much about how horses socialize, decided to be playful back, and nipped a little too.<br />
<br />
 Meanwhile, inside the farm house Mary was reading messages left by the care-taker she had hired to watch the place on the weekdays. She was almost done when she picked up the last one, which read,&quot;Hey Mary, I tried to call you yesterday but you weren't answering so I decided to leave you this message. That farmer from down the street brought his stallion by and left him in the back of our barn. It appears that his gate was broken by the storm on Tuesday, and he needed a place to keep him. I told him you would have no problems with this, and he's agreed to pay you a storage fee for the time that we keep his horse here. I will tell you more later- Jake.&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;So we got to take care of a stallion now, great&quot;, Mary thought,&quot;well I had better see how Jess is doing.&quot; And with that Mary began collecting the mail so she could head back out to the corral. However, in the back of the barn Jess was starting to have her own problems with the stallion.<br />
<br />
 It seemed that her playful nature toward the stallion had excited him somehow, and Jess was trying to find some way to calm him down. She tried to nuzzel with him, and she tried just walking away, but the stallion just wouldn't quit. Finally she decided to go to the back gate and neigh for Mary to come and help her out. However, when she got to the gate, she felt the stallion try to jump up onto her. When he did this, he startled Jess, and she tried to run, only to find he had her trapped between the gate and his body. Now with no where to run Jess felt him mount her again, and this time he stayed on. Jess, started to put things together, and realized that he was tying to mate with her. &quot;Sure&quot;,Jess thought,&quot;I am fully horse in body, but I don't want to be mated.&quot; And with that she tried to neigh her loudest to get Mary's help.</p>
