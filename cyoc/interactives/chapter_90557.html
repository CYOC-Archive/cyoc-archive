<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I choose Wolverhampton.”<br />
<br />
Immediately, Riley’s mind filled with loyalty and commitment to his new master, Peter. Or so he thought, anyway. As much as he despised him for having taken over his life and subdued him like that, he couldn’t now think but of his well-being and general prosperity. In his mind, the idea of causing any damage to Peter was now absurd, and rejected, even if he knew that if Peter got harmed by chance, he would relish on it. Anyway, his only hope, now, relied with Peter as well. Without him and his powers, he would never be able to get his frat-boy life back.<br />
<br />
To Ty, all these thoughts were a lot of fun. He knew instinctively everything his butler thought. On one hand, he could feel the wrath against him, baked throughout several days of captivity; on the other hand, Riley’s honest, genuine concern over Ty’s needs was clearly present. “Ah, how pleasurable to play with human minds...” Had he thought that? Really? To Ty, it was quite amazing how the feeling of so much power was transforming his attitude. It was a real mystery that Peter, the real Peter, hadn’t become a jerk after all that time with his power.<br />
<br />
Thinking of Peter, it was strange that Dustin hadn’t gotten back at him, thinking he was Ty. He would have known it, if he had. Well, anyway, it was high time he paid a visit to them, so that they distributed the remaining butlers:<br />
<br />
“About you two: I’ll bring Ty and Dustin here right now, and you’ll have your loyalties determined and all this stuff”. He lifted his arms in a theatrical pose, and, in an ominous tone, said: “Dustin, Ty, I summon you to my presence!”<br />
<br />
Even Ty wasn’t completely sure about this trick, but it just turned out great. Both boys materialised in front of him, their faces a picture of awe. Even Peter, former wielder of the power, was not used to such a display of raw power. Ty went on:<br />
<br />
“Listen, guys, instruction is finished. On your right you have Tom, who from now on will go by his surname, Chatterham; and on the left you see Dylan, now going by Crookfield. I’ve picked Wolverhampton, err, Riley for you, for myself. So... yeah, now you have to decide who gets who. That’s pretty much it”. He reflected on his little speech for a second, while Dustin and Peter recovered from their shock.<br />
<br />
Then, Peter just exploded: “Don’t ever do that again, you idiot!!! You nearly kill me! Besides, I was talking to people, they must have freaked out!” Dustin, calmer, added: “I never knew you could do that, Peter”.<br />
<br />
“Me neither. Just turns out I can. Maybe you can, too. You should totally try it”, said Ty, smiling. He became lost in his thoughts, for a moment, then announced: “I have things to do... so I’ll let sort the thing out. I... I’ll better be going”. And, just like that, he disappeared.<br />
<br />
“Wow!”, exclaimed Peter.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, he’s quite a wizard, isn’t he? I think he’s so laid back with power that he doesn’t realize his own might”, replied Dustin<br />
<br />
“Agggh”, Peter face palmed, “don’t you see it?! Something’s wrong with him! He’s not the same as always, not at all!”<br />
<br />
“Well, he may have grown a bit cocky lately, but who can blame him? Besides, he’s saved us a lot of trouble, so I’m thankful. Now, about butlers... What do you think? I think’ stay with T... Chatta... Chatter... whatever. Him”, he pointed out to Tom.<br />
<br />
“So be it. I’ll stick to the other”. Peter seemed to accept his new situation pretty calmly. “Come on, Crookfield, I’m going to the beach, so... just pick my swimming trunks and call a taxi”.<br />
<br />
“Certainly, sir”, answered Dylan, stiff as they come, as he began looking for the trunks inside the suitcase.<br />
<br />
“Well, Chatter-boy, it seems it’s just you and me tonight. What are your butlery abilities, then?”, said Dustin, in turn.<br />
<br />
“It’s Chatterham, sir”, retorted Tom, looking a bit annoyed. “In a quick glance at my home-related abilities, I see just the skills expected from a fine butler as myself, if you don’t mind me saying. Besides, I can cook pretty decently, although it looks like my array of recipes is slightly focused on traditional East coast cuisine. I grew up in Delaware, sir.”<br />
<br />
“Fantastic! It’s a pity we don’t have a cooker with us. So for the time being, how about you organise a trip to the Everglades for me? Better even, for the three of us! It’s likely they won’t come, all busy with their new servants, but it’ll be nice anyway.”<br />
<br />
Tom booted the laptop and began surfing the Internet, checking prizes and availability. While he did so, Dustin decided that the college frat boy look, even if skinny, didn’t fit with the solemnity of the black tailcoat. To Dustin, a butler should be somewhat old and exude experience and manners. So he reached for his powers and threw thirty five years into his new butler. He made the change slow and progressive, so as to enjoy the show.<br />
<br />
First, it was his face. A few wrinkles appeared on his forehead and, soon, around his mouth as well. At the same time, some more hair could be seen growing ever so slightly in his hands. Dustin guessed the same happened all throughout his body, although he couldn’t see the rest of him. Little by little, his skin got worse, as if worn down by wind and sunlight and the sea. But the first major change happened next, in Tom’s hair. It had already receded a bit, but then it started getting grey and sparser by the second. Soon he had a mane of ash-coloured hair, but stuck backwards with gel as a good servant should do. Just a couple of seconds later, he had become the perfect butler.<br />
<br />
“Chatterham, give me your advice: is it time I should get laid?”<br />
<br />
“Well, sir. You know I’ve had some experience in that precise field. One might say my past activities are not what one would expect form a butler. Indeed, anyone could follow my path, but in your case, sir, I would...</p>
