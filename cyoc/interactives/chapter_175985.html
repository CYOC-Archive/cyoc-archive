<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Corinne wrote that he can freely expel anything out of his womb and pussy that is stuck inside of it, and quickly pushed out the fake eggs and semen. Contrary to what he thought, it didn&#39;t hurt too much, but was just an overall unpleasant feeling. Pushing a pair of lightbulb sized eggs through over 12 inches of pussy tube was not the most enjoyable experience. <br />
<br />
Now that he was thinking about it, having the pussy tube in and of itself was quickly becomming annoying. It was just too big to be comfortable. Sure using the ovipositor dildo felt really, really good. Almost too good even. But having what essentially is a 4 inch diameter cylinder between his legs was not equally as fun anymore. Maybe the whole &quot;pushing 2 eggs through it&quot; situation also had something to do with it as well? Either way, it had to go for now too. So with another edit, Corinne was left with just a normal looking pussy between his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm. Now that I think about it, aren&#39;t I like, just a normal woman right now? I got both a pair of boobs and a pussy, yet my profile in the book still defines me as a male? Maybe because I specifically gave them to myself, it just made me a guy with a female&#39;s reproductive system? Actually, I still have my balls, come to think of it. Maybe getting rid of those would make me  defined as being female?&quot; Pondered Corinne out loud to hinself. With nothing else to really lose, he removed his balls, and sure enough the book updated to now define her as being female. <br />
<br />
&quot;Haha. Fuck. What a round about way to just change a single word&quot; laughed Corinne in a much more feminine voice. Her entire body had slightly altered here and there in order to give her a much more feminine body. Even her brown hair had turned black and had lengthened considerably, down to the small of her back. In essence, she just looked like a feminine version of her male self, and apparently, if she had been born this way, her hair color would have taken after her mother&#39;s and not her father&#39;s. <br />
<br />
While admiring herself in the mirror, Corinne had to admit that she was definitely pretty hot as a young woman. The one complaint she had was that her back hurt a lot more now from the weight of her breasts. A single sentence fixed that though, for all women too. Simply put, she had just made all human female&#39;s have the back and shoulder strength to support any sized breasts, yet not change anything physical about there outward appearances. Corinne immediately straightened upwards fully, as her breasts seemed to become weightless. While that was by no means what actually happened, it was still a unique experience. <br />
<br />
Tomorrow was Monday, so that meant work again. Actually, maybe work will be a bit more enjoyable now that she had the book. Corinne sat down at her desk, while still naked, when her cellphone rang. It was her mother calling, so while not thinking anything of it, she answered. Then she realized that she was still a woman, however by now, it was too late. <br />
<br />
In her usual &quot;fake happy&quot; voice, whi h always meant her mom was actually annoyed with something, her mom began speaking. &quot;Hello my sexy daughter. How are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine Mom... uh, how about you?&quot; Replied Corinne, cringing a little bit at being called her &quot;sexy daughter&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I am just fiiiiiinnnne. You father on the other hand is going to be in deep shit if I ever catch him wearing one of my bras again.&quot; Corinne sighed knowing she was 100% at fault for this, and that clearly the end of her mother&#39;s sentence was not directed towards her, but her father. Likely he was just confused as to why he had a bra on. She guessed that she didn&#39;t undo the part about all men having breasts properly, and since at the moment, she is a women, how did that change even apply now? Likely it just made all men start wearing bras only to suddenly not need them, but not remove them since they still sort of had breasts somehow... at least that is what she believed happened, given the context of her parent&#39;s argument. She quickly fixed it properly, erasing it all so that only woman have breasts again. Her mother&#39;s tone also chamged too, becomming normal again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways, I just wanted to say hi and ask if you have gotten a boyfriend yet? Your a beautiful woman in her prime. So finding one should be easy for you. O-or, or, maybe a cute girlfriend? If that is the case that is. I won&#39;t judge you for being that, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No mom, I am still single. I will tell you when I find someone. Okay? Oh, I got to go. Someone is at the door. Love you bye&quot; replied Corinne. There was no one at the door. She just didn&#39;t feel like another hour long discussion about finding a partner. Even back when she was still male, her mother would just call to ask her about that specifically. Anyways, there were better things to think about.</p>
