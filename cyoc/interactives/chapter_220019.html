<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the sun shone in the windows, Tony woke up again and licked his nose again as usual. His breath and his saliva reminded him of the beef cubes and gravy he&#39;d had last night. He hoped David was going to bring some extra good treats to their training sessions today!<br />
<br />
A glance down to his groin brought back other memories, memories that involved Megan. The hairy sheath he&#39;d grown last night was still fused tightly with his grown, pointing straight up at his face like it was staring at him. Tony realized he was still a little bit afraid of his new dick. It looked nothing like his old one and was apparently prone to swelling up and getting stuck. But if this was really what a canine had then he was just going to have to get used to it! At least it still smelled kind of like Megan, which was a plus.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe I got laid last night!&quot; he thought with a wide grin. Smiling made him realize that his mouth felt funny, so he reached a clawed hand up there and discovered that his nose and mouth were both farther forward then they had been in the past.<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I getting my muzzle? At least it will happen gradually today and not painfully in a few minutes, I hope!&quot;<br />
<br />
When David came along again, Tony was excited to see him as usual. He was excited for David was already rubbing his fur and tell him what a good boy he was! He was excited because he could already smell fragments of beef jerky inside David&#39;s jacket pocket. (&quot;Treats for later, I bet!&quot; Tony thought.)<br />
<br />
David did not comment on Tony&#39;s altered maleness, but Tony would not have been unhappy if he did. Shame was starting to become a distant memory for Tony. He was accustomed to his morning routine and was actually excited to get outside and refresh his scent markings so they could start their training session as usual. That made him disappointed when he had some newfound trouble peeing on things. His sheath was aiming his dick too high up anyway, and for some reason he had trouble getting anything to come out!<br />
<br />
Tony&#39;s altered mouth anatomy made it even harder to talk to David than the longer tongue had, so he mostly whined a lot and tried to make some words while David tried to figure out why Tony wasn&#39;t doing his business. Eventually, David realized that he hadn&#39;t seen Tony attempting the obvious and said, &quot;You know, Tony, dogs don&#39;t usually do that standing up if that&#39;s what you&#39;re on about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Could it be that simple? Tony got down on all fours and thought back to all the canines he&#39;d seen lifting their legs against a tree or hydrant and soon discovered that this position worked for him as well. His sheath was perfectly aimed to point his piss hole forward like a gun barrel, and he could steer it toward the left or right by holding a leg at just the right angle.<br />
<br />
&quot;This thing&#39;s easier to use than I thought it was!&quot; he thought, panting, suddenly much more satisfied with his new arrangement. He made sure to mark the same posts and bushes that Lucky usually did in the hopes that his friend would keep in touch. He took his daily dump and watched David throw it away as usual. This time, though, he thought of Lucky again, and how far the lab retriever had been able to curl himself around and clean his asshole with his tongue. Tony realized he would no longer be able to use toilet paper or take showers and that he had not bothered to for days. So with that in mind, he circled his body in on itself, aimed his half-formed snout behind his own testicles, flicked his long tongue forward, and almost immediately made contact.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, shit! I can taste everything that&#39;s come out of me back here!&quot; his mind yelled, causing him to pick up his pace a little. Looping the two ends of his digestive tract together was like a revelation to him. Tasting meals that he had long since digested and smelling scent glands that he had never noticed was giving him an entire new perspective about himself. He new this was the area where other dogs would sniff and lick to find out more about him, so licking himself back there was a lot like polishing his personal ID card. More than anything, though, his warm velvety tongue just felt luxurious across his raw anus.<br />
<br />
When he was done, he sat on the ground and looked up at David. David took out a tennis ball and was ready to play fetch. Tony noticed ability to run faster and than every to get the ball and bring it back again like a superhero! Tony was getting so much energy out of his system that he didn&#39;t realize how much energy he had pent up while he was inside. Tony remembered that some of his college age friends were already complaining about how much sooner they got tired now than when they were in elementary school. Tony felt freer and more energetic than he could ever remember being even back then! It was like his body needed to run and jump and chew and just relish the wide open space of the training field. If this was what living and breathing as a dog was going to feel like, then he was looking forward to enjoying every minute, and he couldn&#39;t really bring himself to feel jealous about the extra decades his friends would be living as humans. If anything, he felt they would likely be jealous of him!<br />
<br />
At last, David hooked a leash to Tony&#39;s collar and led him to another location, and Tony thought maybe they were going to place where David could hide things and let Tony sniff around to find them. He also thought they might even be going to the horse barn to play with the cattle dog again. To his surprise, they were going to back into the building to a room he had been in before as though he were about to be examined again. What could the reason be this time?</p>
