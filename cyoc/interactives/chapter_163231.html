<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“As for you Reverend Manson, you almost won the day, but not quite as resourceful as is a devil of the green Jinn. Yes minister, there are some of us as members within the host legions belong to various collective groups separated into colorful titles. Some of our members live as do the Genies of legends and folklore. They are more toward being kind and benevolent, mostly supportive of their present master, while ready to demean any previous master to an unsightly doom; similar maybe to my leaving of Dolthan to becoming a dull donkey.<br />
<br />
He infected his mother by a most devious means and sold her to Mister Morrison as a brood mare. As now, if he can get loose from the adhesive tape bindings, I would recommend him to seal his future by mating with his own mother turned mare.<br />
<br />
You would ask then of me why doom both mother and son? Well as one being of the Green Jinn, our mission is responsible for all forms of misfortune, gifting to some a bedeviling possession, and of giving any as all the plain or horrid types of deadly diseases. Most people would never think that being as transformed to a different species is not caused by the infection of a rare disease.<br />
<br />
Diseases that kill are commonplace, but we of the many Jinn’s, plan to leave the inventing of transforming to genetic scientists and their constant search to as they say, “Bettering of Life.”<br />
<br />
However, those to the purple jinn are sometimes quite supportive and benevolent, as at present I can think of two world laboratories working on similar viruses. The inventing of volatile viruses shall by help from resourceful devils shall cause a spill, and in turn create a wave of misfortune. Viral adversity shall come upon the unsuspecting, and as well the bold who from their limited knowledge while boasting of what cannot be real; shall as well discover their bodies as changing, fur sprouting, feet becoming for some as a second pair of hands. Others, they shall awaken one morning to having hoofs, both either as cloven or a singular toe type.<br />
<br />
Horrors will spread and from the differing manners to those changing, the male species will feel much enhanced testosterone levels, making them as wildly horny and from desired fornication they will spread the new diseases. <br />
These times are coming, and of this day, it is of my design to cause a change.<br />
<br />
Now enough of my boasts, there is damnation to being done. Reverend Manson, I give to you a gift!” The unseen, unknown devil in the shadowy barn as said, he having finished Marg to her being a pony mare. As well dooming of Dolthan to him becoming full form a donkey was given a test; whether he would get free and come to mate with his own mother a mare.<br />
<br />
A sudden whoosh of wind spun into a whirlwind and took hold of dead Tilda’s mare body. The rush of wind made the dead mare body as buoyant, it floating on a cushion of compacted air to then thrown, as flung at Reverend Manson.<br />
<br />
The alert minister saw the dead mare body coming toward him and he first stepped to the right but the body kept then circling overhead. The minister knew what the devil had as he had spoken of a plan, and if he could dislodge the hand hold of the Holy Scriptures, the man would be then vulnerable.<br />
<br />
“No I say; as you Devil get thee behind me, tempt me not!” Reverend Manson said as Jasper began sniffing his muzzle about the waiting rump of Margery the new pony mare.<br />
<br />
The body of dead Tilda then dropped like a wet glob meat onto the ground. Her body came close but nearly missed the minister, as he continued voicing his desires and stood his ground facing down a Devil. The weighty force from 400 pounds of dead flesh flopped hard onto the ground caused the Reverend to juggle his hold of his Bible. He came very close to dropping what he knew held that devil at bay.<br />
<br />
“Ah-ha, you almost lost your number one chance of gaining my blessing and spend the rest of your life being fucked and dropping foals.” The deep tone voice called from inside the barn.<br />
<br />
“Neigh…,” Marg whinnied loudly as what became of her son Jared then mounted his stallion body over her furred rump. As Dolthan remained trapped in the second floor bedroom, his four legs snugly bound by then twisted sticky strapping tape; all he could do was watch the dooming mating about to occur below on the driveway.<br />
<br />
The Reverend ran toward the mounting stallion as if to scare Jasper and Jared from fornicating and dooming of Marg, she then if bred would remain permanently as a pony mare. <br />
<br />
Just then a sun-yellow Chevrolet Corvette drove up the gravel driveway from the rural road. The driver began blowing the vehicle horns as drove fast along the length of the driveway. The echoing sounds worked to deflate, and disturb Jasper at the moment when his erect cock did grazed a touch across the winking, wet vulva of a dreading and scared pony mare.<br />
<br />
As the Corvette scrunched the driveway gravel and dirt into a rolling cloud of dust, the driver door was flung open and out stepped Debra Tiller, she was the hot dolly girlfriend interested in Jared and kept calling, leaving phone messages, but never got a return call.<br />
<br />
“Reverend Manson, what are you doing here…, like blessing the mating of that black stallion to this pretty gray mare; that is Tilda, and what is that a dead Tilda, how is this, what is going on here?” Debra said, as she gained a fuller view of the scene and situation her voice became louder.<br />
<br />
“Leave, leave now, I have a real Devil trapped inside the barn and the gray mare is Misses Morrison, and the big black stallion is your changed boyfriend being as Jasper, now get in your car and go!” The Reverend said as a stunned Debra stood gawking at him as if from what he said, he was crazy.<br />
<br />
“Well hello Debra,” said the deep voiced Devil inside the barn.<br />
<br />
Debra looked stunned, she stood in front of her car, staring into the dark shaded barn where the voice had boomed out from and did something to her to make her then shiver.<br />
<br />
“Have I got just the deal for Jared’s horny hot girl friend, Miss Tiller, your boyfriend foolishly spoke a wish and from his having his lucky coin, he became as was Jasper the Morgan stallion at stud owned by his dad, Mister Morrison; now named as Roberta and being a Welsh breed pony MARE!<br />
<br />
It just so happens that lying there and recently made as dead is the original pony are named as Tilda.<br />
<br />
Yes, yes your avid mind caught the drift of my coming offer. Since Jared is as thoroughly happy being a stallion horse, he could never marry you a woman. However, if you wanted to feel his horse cock spread wide the walls of your vagina, then you need to become a mare. As we have there a dead body mare, you and it I can merge to make as one living pony mare; what do you say hot dolly?” The curse-host Devil said, as it chuckled, was scheming, knowing how Debra had four times almost led Jared to her bed.</p>
