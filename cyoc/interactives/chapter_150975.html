<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad grabbed some stuff from his locker and headed toward his car. He hoped the toy size car key chip would still register. The car had keyless ignition,  so he should be able to drive home.<br />
<br />
He was relieved to find that by holding the key against the car door allowed the signal to unlock the door.  The keyless ignition was a bit trickier. He moved the key fob around the interior until he found the spot  on the dash closest to the sensor and the ignition started. He had a spare key and change of clothes at home.<br />
<br />
He changed his shirt and discovered that it was too small too. Not only was his crotch smooth, but his body was now proportional to the extreme body type of the Ken doll.  His 48 chest was now at least a 54 inch. His waist was a bit bigger too, and he seemed shorter. He had been 6&#39;3&quot;  but Ken was 6&#39; proportionally.  Hey, his nipples and belly button had changed too.<br />
<br />
Chad drove to a toy store and bought a Ken doll, he stripped it and checked it out. Yeah, he was mostly its human twin, fortunately,  not plastic. He needed Jeff to reverse this, he figured.<br />
<br />
So he drove to Jeff&#39;s house. He wasn&#39;t exactly sure what to say when he rang the bell. He tested it in his head: hi ma&#39;am, you&#39;re son tried to magick me and it sort of went wrong.  And well, I&#39;m a eunuch and he&#39;s a plastic doll, and I need him to break the spell and make us both right. Oh, yeah, that would make her want to help him. He rolled his eyes, why had he rung the bell? She was probably a powerful sorceress, and he&#39;d end up a Ken doll for sure.  Still he - his mind stopped racing the door opened.<br />
<br />
It was a teenage girl, Chad recognized her, she went to his school, but she was a freshman, and therefore jailbait to Chad, her stuck exclusively to 18 and older after his 18th birthday. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whew! Uh, Jasmine, isn&#39;t it? I didn&#39;t know you were Jeff&#39;s sister,&quot; Chad blurted out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff must&#39;ve screwed up big time this time,  Ken. Explains why he stole my Ken doll, and took it out of the box. It was an original Ken doll mint in box,&quot; Jasmine complained. <br />
<br />
Chad shifted his feet awkwardly trying to figure out what to say - other than I don&#39;t want to be a eunuch.  He stammered, &quot;It&#39;s not Ken, it&#39;s  Chad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jasmine eyed him suspiciously, &quot;I don&#39;t know any Chads, how do you know me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You won the spelling bee last month. I was really impressed,  I&#39;m not very good at spell casting. Better at sports.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Jasmine relaxed, &quot; Chad? Sports? You&#39;re Chad the quarterback and pitcher and water polo guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guilty. I was wondering if I can come in and get Jeff. I think he&#39;s probably in his room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lemme guess if you look like a Ken Doll, then doofus is probably a 12 inch hunk of plastic now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come in, his room is down the hall, I&#39;ll disarm his wards and charms if you don&#39;t want to get struck by lightning. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, if it breaks this spell?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; I doubt it. Looking like a Ken doll doesn&#39;t seem that awful? Why don&#39;t you let Jeff stay in his box a week or two?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad made a face, and sighed,&quot;I look like Ken all over,&quot; his eyes looked down. Her eyes followed them and widened.<br />
<br />
She laughed, &quot;You&#39;re smooth down there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much incapable of using the toilet,&quot; he added slapping his crackless butt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, this cannot wait a week,&quot; she shook her head. Her hand stopped Chad.  She muttered an incantation.  The smell of sulfur filled the air.<br />
<br />
She opened the door. The room was dark. She turned on the light and opened the blackout drapes. The Ken doll box lay in the middle of Jeff&#39;s bed.<br />
<br />
Jasmine picked it up, looked at it and tossed it to Chad.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s my doofus brother alright.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad sighed in relief, half the problem solved as he stared at the Jeff doll. Oh, great, now what?<br />
<br />
Jasmine saw the perplexed look on Chad&#39;s face.  She said,&quot;You don&#39;t know how to break his spell?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, not exactly.  See he used more than one spell, first the ken lookalike spell and then the shrinking doll spell, which I reflected. Oh, and used a phony spell to make me think he was changing me into his briefs.  There may have been more, because when he went in the box, it vanished.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, a jumble of spells,&quot; Jasmine sighed. She added, &quot;Come with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
So Chad the living Ken doll followed her into her sunny pink bedroom.  She picked up a handmirror with the glass missing and held it in front of Chad and then the doll. She shook her head, and muttered, &quot;unnecessarily complicated.&quot; Then she nodded her head, and said, &quot;alright, I&#39;ll help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then she shooed Chad out of her room. &quot;You go home, Chad, take Jeff with you. You&#39;re linked by the spell, so you should be able to communicate telepathically.  Just don&#39;t trust him. If he asks you to do any spells don&#39;t.  Just write down what he says,  I will compare it with my research, when I come by tomorrow okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, thanks.&quot; Chad said.  He hid in his room, locked the door and took Jeff out of the box.<br />
<br />
As soon as skin touched plastic,  Jeff&#39;s mind unleashed a tirade at Chad.<br />
<br />
*You moron! You ruined my spell!*<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Jeff. I&#39;m sure glad I did or I&#39;d be in the box instead of you. So why did you do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you blind jock boy?&quot; His plastic erection appeared in Chad&#39;s mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gosh it&#39;s almost one inch and a half inches?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Scale, jock boy, oh, right you think with your dick and you&#39;re dickless now. So you&#39;re even more brainless than before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, so a 12 inch doll is a 6 feet, so an inch is 6 inches, so your cock is 9 inches now?  Wait my cock was nine inches? If you wanted to swap cocks, why don&#39;t I have one!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, well, I messed up a spell to make me look like Jasmine&#39;s Ken doll. Her doll got my cock, so. Well, I swapped bodies and-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait then you had a glamour to make you look like yourself? But then, why don&#39;t you look like me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The doll&#39;s spell interacted. I got my body back, you got Ken&#39;s body, I got your dick, and Jasmine&#39;s doll is now a Chad doll with an inch long penis. Six inches isn&#39;t bad, but why did you just not swap it back into a doll and just swap bods? This seems too complicated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not Jock boy. See if you were the Ken doll, I&#39;d give you back to Jasmine.  I&#39;d keep her now anatomically correct Jeff doll as my trophy, and I&#39;d take over your life as Chad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, you&#39;re a powerful mage, why would you want to be me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Girls, popularity. Really big dick. Oh, and I&#39;d still be the powerful mage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad set Jeff down, and texted Jasmine to let her know about the other doll.<br />
<br />
Damn, he was hot, so he peeled off his clothing and lay down naked next to the naked Jeff doll. He dozed off. He woke to find the doll in his hand moving it up and down across his crotch bulge.</p>
