<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake felt the brisk wind on his fur for the first time, washing away some of the heat the fur was trapping in, appreciating a cool breeze for what was probably the first time in his life. While there were concerns about the reaction people were bound to have to him, as well as his lack of footwear, the larger part of his brain simply didn’t care. He smiled, adjusting his junk before walking off down the street, towards the bus stop, his stride wobbly on his new feet.<br />
<br />
The gathering at the bus stop was all human, but while he caught a few glances from an older lady no one was really reacting more than if he was just dressing a little funny, allowing him to blend in. On the bus it was much the same too. The bus driver gave him a look, but once he showed him his pass the driver became more concerned about the older lady’s excessive baggage. As the bus pulled away, he blended into the crowd, just another soul standing on the bus. <br />
<br />
That was, that was until they turned their first corner, which nearly threw him off his new feet and onto his ass. He sat on the nearest empty seat, looking around to see if anyone saw his near-fail, then distracted himself by looking out the window.<br />
<br />
The drive out of suburbia wasn’t that long, and really was a crash course in how normal his new body was. It only took him five minutes to see his first fellow monster, a snake girl, passing her by as she waited for a bus. She had an old, roman looking aesthetic, covered in a bedsheet with a purple trim, swaddled around her midsection so her shoulders were uncovered. Another five minutes, and after about a mile, he passed a house with three tiger-furries getting into a car, as a fourth left the house, the four possible siblings all dressed in what looked like cosplay. This was followed by a neko exiting a shop in a bikini on the corner, a bull man with a bulge further down, and then an androgyneous harpy flying overhead. <br />
<br />
Closer into the city more and more monsters appeared, until it was roughly one in twenty people, with at least one on every street, and about one in three of those as extensively monster-like as himself. It was getting harder to keep track, especially witthe the rising noise of the shopping district, and he became so entranced that he didn’t notice when one got on the same bus as him, her boots clopping towards him.<br />
<br />
“Mind if I sit?” the little voice squeaked. Nathan turned and found a mouse girl, less than half the height of a regular human, smiling up at him. There were a few seats free around him, enough for everyone, and yet she wanted to sit there, with him.<br />
<br />
“No, it&#39;s good.” Nathan replied, as she pulled herself onto the seat. Unlike him she had hair that was dyed back and pulled into a ponytail behind her, complimenting her angeogyneously gothic aesthetic. He couldn’t tell if the black patterns in her fur were natural, or just part of the aesthetic.<br />
<br />
“Are you okay? Are you gonna stare at me the whole trip?” She said. While her tone was terse there was a smile hidden within it.<br />
<br />
“Sorry,” he replied, turning and rubbing his neck, “you look really cool is all. That must have taken you ages.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you, but I’m taken. You look, erm, interesting.” She grinned, eyes skirting up and down Nathan. “I’m guessing you changed recently?” Nathan nodded, feeling Jake stir in his pants, little paws shifting in his sheath.  “We have all been there. What happened to your shoes?” He looked at his paws, flexing his toes, grinning through a rising blush. <br />
<br />
“Literally just last night.” he replied.<br />
<br />
“Wow. Like all in one night?” Nathan nodded. “Holy cow. How much did you pay for it?”<br />
<br />
“I didn’t. A friend really wanted to turn himself, as well as someone else at the same time, and I just agreed.”<br />
<br />
There was a pause, the two reading each other&#39;s faces, before she began prodding him, inspecting him with a tiny paw.<br />
<br />
“Kinky?” she asked, he nodded. “Gay shit?” he chucked, but again, he nodded. “Is he still with us or did you eat him?”<br />
<br />
“A little of both.” Nathan laughed, nervously shifting in his seat, still stroking his neck, as Jake stumbled out of his sheath. “Are all furries like this? Do you go around asking every fur their kinks?”<br />
<br />
The mouse girl raised an eyebrow, and a devious grin.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s MUTT, I’ll have you know, as fur isn’t inclusive enough. Besides, I never mentioned your kinks.” She breathed, paw retreating from his fur, like he was radioactive. “Should I have?”<br />
<br />
“Probably.” Jake’s muffled voice spoke. <br />
<br />
The mouse recoiled, and in a flash bounded from his lap and to Nathan’s head, eeking as she scrambled to stay up. There was a melee of paws, shouting from both mouse and Nathan, as well as a chastising look from the driver. <br />
<br />
As Nathan pulled the girl off his face he felt all eyes of the bus staring at him, the magic of normality broken, and he was suddenly very aware of his situation. It was like his world collapsed, like everything had suddenly dissolved into shit. His heart skipped and plunged, barely able to escape the crushing gaze.<br />
<br />
Letting her down, he excused himself and got off the bus in town, flying out the door and into an alley.<br />
<br />
“Dude, dude,” Jake whispered, “What’s up? What happened.”<br />
<br />
“They all saw.” Nathan barked through his whisper, The shame was unreal, so hot even Jake felt it. “I-I don’t know, I just, I dunno.”<br />
<br />
Jake, at the controls of the Vac, was waving away at screens like a pilot on a crashing plane, but the ministrations were not helping. His vision was invaded by abstractions beyond imagery, fears of crushing, shrinking, powerlessness that made Jake struggle against it, waving faster. It only brought the reality into sharper relief, only made him feel smaller, weaker, stranger…<br />
<br />
“Dude cool it, cool…”<br />
<br />
“Hey! Big feller!” The mouse girl called out. There was a clark as her tiny boots pounded the pavement towards them. “C’mon, look at me. Deep breathes. It&#39;s a panic attack, that&#39;s all. Deep breaths.”<br />
<br />
Jake was briefly flooded with mental imagery of the girl, of the sharp dark lines around her face, and of the joy her little smile brought. Despite this there was no sexual imagery, just a motherly expression behind the gothic edginess.<br />
<br />
“Sorry.” Jake sighed. “Was that really…”<br />
<br />
“Yup. Mine was the same on my first day too. Your brain is still the same, depending on what method you used of course, but the way you interact with the world is so new it can be overwhelming.” She touched his paw, hers so tiny they were lost in its mass. “Sorry, it&#39;s pretty shitty of me to start inspecting you like that, especially when you are so fresh. What was that anyway? Is your friend like…”<br />
<br />
“Yeah I’m in here.” Jake said. Curious about what he was talking to he brought up the girl’s details, looking at a holographic image of her, alongside Nathan’s screen. Jake watched Nathan’s shame moodlet rise, mirroring the mouse girl’s curiosity. “I’m the one Nathan, uh, ‘ate.’ Names Jake.”<br />
<br />
She looked at his groin, then back up at Nathan proper.<br />
<br />
“Pleased to erm, meet you?” She said through a forced smile. “I’m Steph.”<br />
<br />
“Likewise. You wanna meet me prop…”<br />
<br />
“No.” Nathan and Steph said in tandem. All three laughed, as Nathan steadied himself against the wall of the alleyway, his tail starting to swing.<br />
<br />
“I’m an older mutt,” Steph explained, “and I work and live in support groups for mutts. Hell, us older mutts are practically walking support groups for you ‘youngins.’ I was actually on my way back from one dedicated to transwomen.”<br />
<br />
“Fuck, sorry about that. I didn’t want you to miss your stop.” Nathan said.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s cool, I can get another one.” She was lying. Nathan knew that bus route, there wouldn’t be another for an hour. “Besides I need to get some stuff in town, I was gonna fuckit because of the parade but, well, if I’m here might as well do it anyway, you know?” She smiled, pulling her phone out of her pocket. Nathan barely contained his squee, the device also half the size of normal. “I am gonna head off before it gets too busy, but before I go I wanted to give you the contact to my girlfriend’s - erm - lets call it a ‘support group,’ that might help, as well as a little advice, for little Jake there.<br />
<br />
“Look, it&#39;s cool you guys have found something you like but you can’t bring random strangers into your kink like that. I can’t consent on the fly like that, and if that’s gonna be an issue you need to do more kink prep. There are plenty of bars, hotels, districts, and communes for that shit, but you need to keep it under wraps until you get there. If you do it on the bus you are gonna get us all banned. Got it?”<br />
<br />
Jake grumbled, a finger hovering over the ‘delete entity’ function, before pausing. Not only was their life story displayed in full, making it hard to be so capricious with her life, the details about it had them confused. Steph wasn’t short for Stephanie, it was short for Stephan. Steph, was in fact gender fluid.<br />
<br />
Jake realized he were staring at Steph’s hidden cock for far too long, leaving the mouse themselves looking on in confusion. They minimized the screen, whipping the spittle of precum from their mouth.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I suppose that was pretty shitty of me too.” Jake relented, glimpsing hungrily at the cock one last time. “Sorry.”<br />
<br />
They smiled, nodding up at Nathan.<br />
<br />
“That’s all.” They finished, presenting a card to Nathan, a website written on it. “See you around?”<br />
<br />
Nathan nodded one last time, before heading back down the alley, Steph heading out the other, the two going their separate ways. <br />
<br />
Nathan also had an hour to kill, but he also had more genuine uses for the shopping centre they found themselves in, and shoes sat at the top of his list. Jake was still there, but his power was waning with Nathan’s arousal, grumbling his way back into the cloistered world of the sheath. It was hard to stay angry, especially considering how all this would be undone in two weeks anyway, but he was annoyed at feeling so impotent even with control over the infinitely powerful Chronivac.<br />
<br />
This must be how God feels, Jake thought. <br />
<br />
As Steph walked further away Jake let out a sigh, waving their screen away, losing them to the background noise of the city, retreating back into hibernation.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
The next thing Jake saw was the deer girl again, though this was very much his dream; a lucid vision that passed by, leading him into an orgy his own creation. There were all manner of monstrous creatures there, none with the standard amount or location, or even types of genitals, writhing in a sea of liquid flesh, moaning, reforming, and then melting back into the mass. Despite the erotic scene, little Jake felt nothing.<br />
<br />
The next moment the mass stirred and twisted, reforming into the image of a centaur, his package bouncing with each step, with a great wall of fabric behind it. The image twisted and faded, as Jake found himself awake again, head poking out of the sheath, pumping with the tease of virility, the one unsheathed ear picked up on the clopping of hooves. Before he could comprehend it, before he could call on the vac, the clooping drew away, and Jake found himself sliding back in, arms and head held still by the sheathes tightness. <br />
<br />
The sea returned, at last Jake could move, but the liquidity of the mass was starting to behave in ways he couldn’t comprehend, the water overlapping itself, sliding into a gaseous state before dissolving into darkness. <br />
<br />
Jake was lost in an abyss, his phallic body  held together by willpower, phantom legs striding standing on concrete, so real that he could feel the concrete’s texture, and warmth, and smell, and colour. If he focused, really focused he could see it, and his hands again, the whole of reality coming back in some way, able to see through Nathan’s eyes as a passive observer. <br />
<br />
But, as Nathan walked on, he spotted something. Jake fell back, sliding through the dream and into the boxers again, his whole head fully emerged. He was awake again, with Nathan sat somewhere, his thighs flanking and culminating his vision. Nathan said a few things, as a male, a strong male, a male Jake couldn’t see but a male Jake’s features somehow just knew, kneeled not far from his face. <br />
<br />
Jake pulled an arm out the sheath, summoning a holographic screen with Nathan’s details, zooming in on Nathan’s arousal. <br />
<br />
‘Slight,’ it said. It didn’t feel slight.<br />
<br />
Nathan’s foot pounded the ground a few times, as he laughed, the sound of conversation more muffled than ever. Moments later, the arousal began the shrink again, as did Jake.<br />
<br />
Here we go again, Jake thought.<br />
<br />
More dreams, more visions, and more abyssal emptiness, as Jake slid in and out of stasis, his brain gradually coming to terms with what was going on. When Nathan wasn’t aroused his body sent less blood to Jake, less general resources, and with that Jake - as a person began to retreat into Nathan. Nathan would see something, he would start to rise, he walked on, Jake would retreat away, becoming nothing more than part of Nathan. However, when he was out the only thing Jake could think about was getting a release. <br />
<br />
Jake sat there, dark liminality all he knew, his consciousness reduced to abstract notions bound by a will to survive, his consciousness melting with the mass of fucking fantasies. It was a horror, the enoaching feeling of oblivion irresistible, Nathan’s senses sliding onto him like, dominating his own, until all of a sudden it all collapsed, and suddenly Jake was a person again.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Jake popped back into existence, forced out of the sheath, face pressed against the cotton of Nathan’s boxers as a flash of something curvy penetrated his mind. <br />
<br />
He didn’t need to see where he was on the Vac’s screen, he merely had to smell the coffee in the air.<br />
<br />
Of course. Of course Nathan would stop by the Coffee Lab, ‘Just to make sure it still existed!’ he could hear Nathan say, and of course he would have to make sure everything was still the same by buying a coffee. Nathan was like a coffee-seeking missile in the morning, and always had an excuse ready, especially if it allowed him an excuse to visit his favourite.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Jake was certainly feeling the tingle of arousal, which gave him a new perspective on the caffeine addiction. Was he getting a hard on over it? He opened up the console, only to be interrupted as a shared fantasy invaded his mind.<br />
<br />
Nathan was in the queue, waiting for his cue to move forward and place his order, in amongst a few furries, under the shadow of another furry. This one, the barista, was a dog like him, a fluffy border collie, her figure so thick it was bursting out of her uniform, tits so large they were almost comical. Most of her face was almost lost amongst a mane of brown and golden fur, covering the side of her head and her neck, and might have been if not for the glimmer of golden piercings on her ears and nose. Her emerald eyes, however, couldn’t be missed,  shining the brightest with unplaceable familiarity.<br />
<br />
Jake pulled away from the mental image to look at the girl&#39;s stats, as the erection pushed his face along the inside of the boxers. He was so hard at this point the holographic screen was coced through the cotton, before vanishing, though he no longer needed it. Through the flood of mental imagery he saw one telling thing pinned to the barista’s massive breast; a name tag.<br />
<br />
That was Jenna; Jenifer Rickter, Jen-R, or just Jenna. <br />
<br />
She sat in front of them in Biology, giving them both an ample view of her ample ass. She had worked here once before, in the real world, and it was the reason they discovered the place, but she had left years ago. Now she was not only back, but she had an upgrade.<br />
<br />
Again, of course. <br />
<br />
Jake smiled, laughing as his brains came flooding back, along with scattered half-memories of walking and shopping and a big hunky guy near his groin. It made his panic seem silly, not unlike Nathan’s earlier panic. He took a mock-breath, sighing as the girl spoke to them at last.<br />
<br />
“Have you been served, sir?” she said to Nathan, her tail flicking with the same joy that filled her voice. Nathan stepped forward with a smirk, eyes flitting over her figure. <br />
<br />
“Medio mocha to go?” He breathed, trying to sound as cool as he could. Her face scrunched, confused eyes looking up and down Nathan.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure Hun, you are a dog, chocolate is…”<br />
<br />
Oh. Well that sucks. Nathan thought.<br />
<br />
“Sorry,” he blushed, “still getting used to this. What do you think I should get?”<br />
<br />
“Neolatte,” she chirped, gesturing to the item on the menu. She had such a sincerity to her smile it was debilitating, and the wild waft of her tail only accentuated it. “It&#39;s made for us doggies! Could even give it to an animal doggy and it wouldn’t even kill it. Could even give you my special brew I only give to the best doggies.”<br />
<br />
Images of the dog girl lactating into the coffee invaded both Jake and Nathan’s mind, as precum slpewed from Jake’s mouth.<br />
<br />
“Sounds awesome.” he said, paying for the drink. “Gonna go and use your bathroom, be right back.”<br />
<br />
Inside the cubicle, Jake flung out of his fly, his tiny ears unfurling, glowing with tingling sensitivity. He was looking down, lost in a heady stupor, staring towards Jake’s now covered feet. He shook it off, trying to clear his head.<br />
<br />
“First off, where did you get the shoes?” Jake said, pointing to the canvas trainers on his foot paws.<br />
<br />
“At the store?” Nathan said as he whipped out some moisturizer from his pocket. “I just dove into a foot locker - or paw locker - and picked some up.” <br />
<br />
“Oh.” Jake said, wondering how long he was out for, and why he could see the store in his own memories, along with the man that sold the shoes. “I thought you were more of a Tims man?”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s racist.”<br />
<br />
“But you are though. I mean you straight-up wore Tims last night.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, well, they don&#39;t seem to exist in this world.” Nathan sighed, lubing Jake up. Jake didn’t notice, confused about the mental image of the man talking about the shoes. He was cute, but not enough to be part of a fantasy. “Least not the furry version of them. Guy in the store said they were the last major chain holding out against integration.”<br />
<br />
“Is that racist? Nevermind. The fuck you doing?” He said, pushing back Nathan’s paw. “She wants to bounce your cock so hard man, just go get her!”<br />
<br />
“She’s just being nice, like good customer service? I’m not about to…”<br />
<br />
“Jackass I have the Vac.” Jake laughed, pointing at an unseen screen. “I can see what she wants and she has wanted your schlong for years.”<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah. Wait, you want to be like… I mean… I thought you were gay?” Jake paused, dismissing the screen and steadying himself against the side of his leg. It was clear to them both that when they were like this, the bounds of consent, want, and individual desires became blurry to the point of incoherency. But, rather than explain it, Jake just bit his lip, trying to control his urge. “Yeah, yeah, I get it. I mean I would want to use you if…”<br />
<br />
“She is going on lunch.” He snapped. The rational part of Jake’s brain was screaming for clemency, maybe even dialing the raging sexuality back, or at least checking she was cool with cock cats, but it was lost to a throbbing sexuality. “Just go, we can discuss the implications later.”<br />
<br />
Jake grabbed his coffee from Jenna’s human male colleague, ignoring their hungry looks as he looked around for his prey. There was a brief moment he thought he missed his opportunity, until the raging cock cat gestured with a tiny paw out the door. She stood across the street, apron gone, revealing her figure in full behind some tight black leggings and a tight black top, the line of her bra and panties clearly visible. <br />
<br />
Nathan winked at the colleague, making him grin and blush, as they shot out the door.<br />
<br />
Jenna was vaping in a little community garden, reclaimed from an underused parking lot, idly swiping away at her phone. She looked around, a little saddened, but glew up as she spotted Nathan’s approach. The bounce as Nathan walked over made Jake flop out completely, the image of a grinning Jenna the only thing on his mind as they entered the semi-wooded seclusion.<br />
<br />
“Hey,” he smiled, hesitating, taking a sip of the coffee. It was creamier than he expected, which didn’t help the mental image of a lactating dog girl. “It&#39;s good coffee, best I’ve had!”<br />
<br />
She stared on, not even replying, her smile fixed like she was waiting for the meat of the conversation. Nathan wanted to ask her there and then, and Jake was burning with the need for satiation, but the words just faltered and twisted in his mouth. How do you ask someone to casual sex, anyway? He shook his head, reframing the thoughts in his mind. “I have to head back and give my mom a hand with things, but I kinda like you, can we hang later?”<br />
<br />
Jenna beamed.<br />
<br />
“Can I give you my kink sheet? You can show me yours but I can guarantee mine is much more kinkier, and it has my contact deets on it too!”<br />
<br />
She held up a QR code on her phone, a grin plastered across her face. Nathan just stood there, gormless.<br />
<br />
“What’s a kink sheet?” He asked, heart pounding in his throat, Jake practically screaming down below. <br />
<br />
“Oh, you must be new to all this. It&#39;s an app.” Nathan pulled the phone out his pocket, and the second it was unlocked Jenna swiped it into her paws. “Tells people what you are into, and it&#39;s standard for us mutts, you select… wait. Here it is.”<br />
<br />
The app was buried amongst his social media in a folder on it&#39;s own, like he had put it there himself, even filling in the details. Nathan just chuckled, smiled, and shrugged. “Oh yeah, that thing, I installed it a while back and forgot about it.”<br />
<br />
She looked between him and the app, the grin expanding. <br />
<br />
“Oh really? Says here you updated it last night, that you and a friend did some CTF, and that while it&#39;s strange you ARE loving it, as opposed to that you DID love it. Not only does that imply you are lying to me, it also implies that the CTF is an ongoing thing.” She presented him with his own lies in his own hand (or paw), though it was all news to him. After lingering for a moment at a selfie he allegedly uploaded  he began to splutter, while Jake began searching through his unseen screens. It was the Vac, Jake discovered. In fixing reality it had created a whole new life for the two of them, including social media. <br />
<br />
Oh fuck, he thought, both Nathan and Jake’s ears flattening.<br />
<br />
“You don’t have to hide your kinks with me Hun, not with me at least, not gonna judge.” She had a coy laugh like a villainess revealing a plot, accentuated by a pose that made the cuteness performative, a mask for her dominance. The dismissive hand gesture the cherry on the cake. She scanned her QR with his app, revealing her own secret life. “I am going to be working over the parade, but after it, I want to see him.”<br />
<br />
Jake was, by this point, straining against the underwear, so hard and so bold she couldn’t help but notice, so desperate it&#39;s all either of the boys could think about. He wanted to talk, wanted to invite her in, but was very conscious of how wrong it was, and how disastrous it would become.<br />
<br />
No matter what he did, a sacrifice had to be made.</p>
