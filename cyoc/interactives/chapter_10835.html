<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">JFK High School, Orange County School District, Monday morning, 7:52 AM<br />
<br />
There was a large group of students who had just stepped off the school bus while many other cars queued up to drop off the students, when Jason stepped off the bus with another student, who had never attended the school before. It was a foreign exchange student from England, and this was supposed to be his very first day of class.<br />
<br />
“I’m so excited you finally made it to America, Peter! That’s awesome! I hope you can stay longer than you thought at first…” Jason said to his new buddy.<br />
<br />
“Well my family has just moved here, I am lucky to be next door to you. And from what I heard, I think I am gonna be a resident here!” Peter replied.<br />
<br />
“Hey Peter, two of my best friends are standing over there. The tall blond guy is Tyler, and the big kid next to him is also named Peter! I will introduce you to them, okay?” Jason said to Peter, as the two walked up to the main building.<br />
<br />
When Jason and Peter came up to Tyler and Peter Karlowski, Jason used the opportunity to introduce them to Ty and Peter first.<br />
<br />
“Hey Ty and Peter, this is Peter Pendragon, he’s from England!” Jason said excitedly, while pointing to the English Peter.<br />
<br />
“It’s a real pleasure to meet you two! I am pretty new here and am looknig to meet new friends. My intrests are computers, writing stories, and playing/collecting Yu-Gi-Oh! Cards.” Peter replied. <br />
<br />
“Hey guys, won’t it be a bit confusing having two guys in class with the name ‘Peter’? Because my cousin’s name is also Peter!” Ty said, with a bit of a concern.<br />
<br />
“Well you can call my P.K. too” Peter Karlowski said to cousin Ty.<br />
<br />
“Just call the Peter from England Pete!” Jason replied, hoping to clear up the confusion with that.<br />
<br />
“So what stories do you like to write, Pete?” Peter asked his British namesake, as the four boys made their way into the classroom for their first period History class.<br />
<br />
“Well I write a few based on Yu-Gi-Oh!, but my main speacilty are stories where people are transformed into dragons. I got a good writing style!” Pete explained; as he sat down to grab his books out of his backpack. Pete sat right in between Jason and Peter, and Ty was right in front of him<br />
<br />
“Dragons? Gosh I thought dragons only existed in the world of wizards and magic…” Jason wondered out loud.<br />
<br />
“Magic? Oh well we can definitely say a thing or two about magic” Ty replied with a chuckle, while staring at Peter at the same time. <br />
<br />
“I have heard a little about you. Some people round here say you two have magic powers. It sounds a bit farfetched, but really cool!” <br />
<br />
“Let’s just say that we know a few magic tricks…” Peter replied. He didn’t like to tell people about his powers because he was afraid to scare them during their first meeting.<br />
<br />
The class finally got started after the bell rang and the teacher walked in with his books. All the students paid attention, accept Ty. He turned towards Peter and sent him a telepathis thought. <br />
<br />
“Are you going to tell Pete your secret?” Peter heard Ty’s voice say inside his head. <br />
<br />
“A secret? What secret is that?” Ty and Peter heard. Both of them gasped and dropped their mouths wide open when they realized that Pete could read their minds as well! They knew they were going to have fun since they were already known at the school as “the Wizards”.<br />
<br />
Pete and Peter shared most classes together, while Ty had several classes on his own. But the whole group got together during lunch, which was right after the fourth class period was over. Peter and Ty were the first in line.<br />
<br />
As soon as the fourth period was over, Peter and Ty made it a habit to immediately wish for them to appear first in line at the school’s cafeteria. They got their lunch and made the way to the long tables in the dining area, where they reserved several seats for their friends.<br />
<br />
Jason and Pete joined them just a few minutes later. At first Jason wondered where Peter and Ty had disappeared off to, but Pete seemed to understand what they were doing and where they were already!<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for them, Sergio, Doug and Ethan just walked in to cafeteria. Sergio had spotted the table where Peter and Ty were sitting. He didn’t like them and dispised them. But he knew that there wasn’t much he could do and Peter and Ty had warned them earlier on to stay away from them and to leave them alone. This time, however, they noted that there was a new face sitting among Ty’s group of friends, and the three bullied huddled together to talk about the plan of action.<br />
<br />
“Hey, who’s the new guy?” Doug wondered out loud.<br />
<br />
“Don’t know. But hey, we need to tap into new sources of income, you know? Our habit is getting expensive. We can offer him our services in exchange for protection money!” Ethan replied.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know about this. Strange things always seem to happen every time we mess with Ty and Peter! Especially Peter, he made me shrink last time I did something! I’m not gonna mess with these guys, dudes” Sergio mumbled out of concern, remembering what happened last time he bullied them.<br />
<br />
“What’s the matter with you? Are you chicken or something?” Doug sneered back at him.<br />
<br />
“I think we need to face them alone, because they’re too strong when they are all together. Let’s wait for them on the parking lot after class. I need to get some money so I can buy a joint!” Ethan said. Both Doug and Sergio grinned as their formulated their evil plan to teach the new guy a lesson.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, we need to welcome the new guy!” Sergio replied. The three students laughed, as they walked out the cafeteria. None of them could wait for the end of the seventh period.<br />
<br />
Luckily for Pete, Jason was in every single class that he had. He wasn’t with Peter and Ty in every class, but it didn’t seem to matter to him, since he could now link to both Peter and Ty telepathically and he knew at all times what they were doing, what they were thinking, and where they were.<br />
<br />
That afternoon, 3:17 PM<br />
<br />
As soon as the seventh period was over, Peter dashed out the door.<br />
<br />
“What’s the hurry?” Ty wondered out loud, as he saw his cousin bolt out the door.<br />
<br />
“I have swim practice and I need to go to the gym with Rob tonight! So I don’t have much time to study this afternoon.” Peter explained, as he dashed down the hallway.<br />
<br />
Ty hung around for awhile to talk to some of the other students, while Jason and Pete made their ways out on to the staff parking lot. They lived relatively close to the school, so they didn’t need to take the bus back home.<br />
<br />
“I hope you liked your first day of class, Pete…” Jason said to Pete, just as they walked through the double doors.<br />
<br />
“This was a very good first day! I think I am gonna enjoy this school!” Pete said to him, “I have more friends than I did at my British schools, and it looks as if there are not that many bullies here, thank God.”<br />
<br />
As Jason was walking, suddenly Ethan came up behind him and tapped him on the shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Hey Jay, come here! I need to show you something!” Ethan shouted at him. Jason turned around and followed Ethan to the softball field, leaving Pete alone on the parking lot.<br />
<br />
Suiddenly Doug and Sergio came out of hiding, and they approached Pete. Since they were twin brothers and they were both about 6 ft 3” and well over 300 pounds, Pete was a slight bit startled when these two big guys walked up to him.<br />
<br />
“Hey, fag! Yeah, you! I have never seen you at this school before! What’s your name?” Sergio growled at him.<br />
<br />
“I am Peter Pendragon, but the others call me Pete. And you are?” Pete replied, obviously feeling a little uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
“I’m Sergio, and this is my brother Doug.” He answered.<br />
<br />
“Well, since you’re new, my little friend, I gather you don’t know about the Safety Tax at our school!” Doug explained.<br />
<br />
“Safety Tax? This sounds like the thing the bully from the unaired series of ‘Yu-Gi-Oh!’ was running. He wanted… Oh what was it, 80k or 200k dollars? This sounds fishy to me…” Pete politely replied.<br />
<br />
“Well since you’re the new guy; let’s just say we’re here to collect twenty Dollars for the first month of safety while you’re at this school!” Doug said, while rubbing his hands together. He then turned towards Sergio and gave him an evil grin.<br />
<br />
“I`m sorry…. But I don`t have any money on me…” Pete replied calmly.<br />
<br />
“Well then, that’s just too bad for you!” Doug said calmly while Sergio walked behind Pete and was poised to grab hold of him from behind, so that Doug could punch him in the stomach.<br />
<br />
“OH NO! WAIT… What are you doing?” Pete shouted, as Sergio grabbed hold of his arms and held them behind his back. “DON’T HURT ME! YOU’RE MAKING A MISTAKE!”<br />
<br />
Pete looked at Doug, who was making a fist with his right hand and punched it in the palm of his left hand. He became deeply concerned, and he closed his eyes. He decided to concentrate hard on Peter and Ty, and he thought out loud for them to hear. “TY or PETER! I got attacked by two bullies on the school parking lot! HELP ME! COME HERE NOW! THEY’RE GOING TO PUNCH ME!” Pete kept his eyes closed, anticipating the first blow against his abdominals.<br />
<br />
Just when Doug struck Pete in the stomach, Ty appeared at the other end of the parking lot, since he didn’t know where Pete was. But when he looked around, he just barely caught a glimpse of Doug’s punch, and this upset him inmensely. He immediately ran to Pete’s assistance, while shouting at the two bullies!<br />
<br />
“HEY YOU TWO! LEAVE HIM ALONE! Ty shouted, as he came running towards Pete.<br />
<br />
Doug had just made his fist in order to deliver his second punch. But he hesitated, when he realized that Pete’s face began to change. His eyes began to turn red as his face began to change in shape.<br />
<br />
Then Doug became startled when Pete looked up at him and opened his mouth. Pete now had a forked tongue!<br />
<br />
“You FOOL! Do you RRRREALLY think you can hurrrt WYRRRAACH URRRR?” Pete said calmly, while still looking Doug in the eye. Doug’s jaw dropped wide open when he saw the look on Pete’s face, and the forked tongue scared him a little, as he took a step back.<br />
<br />
“What the heck is that?” Doug wondered out loud when he noticed Pete’s initial changes.<br />
<br />
“What doesss it look like, you morrron? It`sss a drrragonsss tongue! It can tassste how ssscarred you arrre. You rrrealy made a HUGE missstake beating up on my human forrrm!” Pete replied to them. <br />
<br />
All three of them, Ty, Sergio and Doug dropped their jaws wide open when they realized that something strange was happening to Pete! Sergio immediately let go of Pete and walked over to where Doug was standing, so he could see what was happening to Pete.<br />
<br />
The three looked on in surprise and shock as Pete’s fingers began to grow longer, the skin beginning to peel off, revealing shiny black scales underneath. Razor sharp crimson claws ripped through his fingertips as they lenghtened into deadly talons!<br />
<br />
All three of them gasped again when Pete’s pupils in his eyes became slit like that of a lizard! Or in this case, a dragon!<br />
<br />
Next, Pete’s whole body began to grow taller and taller, forcing him to rip out of the clothes he was wearing. His jeans and tennis shoes ripped apart, exposing his mighty claws and long legs which were now beginning to show scales which were slowly covering the rest of his body!<br />
<br />
The scales covered the flesh of his legs, leaving not a single speck of flesh showing as his ankles pulled up, a deadly crimson claw growing from his ankles. His legs no longer looked human, but were now the powerful hind legs of a fearsome dragon! The legs grew more muscular as his spine began to ache severly, as if someone was pulling on it.<br />
<br />
Next, large pointy spikes began to grow from his knees as his legs were slowly being covered by thick, black scales. A long lizard’s tail began to grow from the end of his spine, with razor sharp edges completing the outer layer of the deadly tail’s skin.<br />
<br />
On the underside of the tail, thick crimson scutes formed, running from the tails tip, to up his chest, and up to his bottom jaw. His neck started to feel weird as it began to grow thicker. It then elongated, growing some 20ft! At this current point of time, a half lizard, half human creature was looking down on the three of them! Sharp, deadly spikes grew from the barbed tip of the tail up to the top of his still human neck.<br />
<br />
Suddenly something began to grow out of Pete’s backside, as he slowly began to bend over forward. Ty, Doug and Sergio continued to watch in amazement, as wide, thin and powerful draconic wings began to form on his back just below the neck, clearly ripping away the remains of his shirt. The strangely beautiful wings slowly spread out over his back, as there was now a sharp fold on each end. Short, strong claws grew out of the tips of the wings, which had now grown to a span of over 100 feet! The webbing between the wings was bright red, as the claws turned black.<br />
<br />
There was now a creature with the body of a dragon and the head of a human, but that did not last for much longer. The flesh on his face tore away as his jaws cracked and fused with his nose, pushing out into a scaly black dragon`s beak. His human teeth fell out as deadly sharp black fangs grew in. His ears lenghtened into three spined fans as five horns grew from his head, 2 on each side and one between his eyes, which moved to the sides of his head. Acidic venom dripped from his beak, burning into the ground as a short burst of flame shot from his mout into the air, ending his change. He roared in triumph.<br />
<br />
Both Doug and Sergio’s faces turned pale white as they began to shake with fear as they witnessed this student as he transformed into a mighty dragon. Slowly, they took turns backing off; when they eventually turned around in order to run from the large, winged lizard! <br />
<br />
“HELP!! We’re being attacked by a DRAGON!! I’m OUTTA HERE!!!” Sergio shouted, as both men feared for their lives!<br />
<br />
The dragon roared and swung his neck back and forth, first looking at Ty, and then turning towards Sergio and Doug, who were now running away. Luckily, most of the cars had left the parking lot, so there was nothing left for them to hide behind.<br />
<br />
The dragon then paused and took a deep breath! It then opened its giant beak wide, aiming straight at the two running students. Suddenly, a fiery stream of fire spewed from his throat, striking Doug's jeans just above the legs! The dragon then took another deep breath, and did the same to Sergio!!<br />
<br />
“AAAAAHHH!! I’M ON FIRE!!! HELP ME!! SOMEBODY HELP ME!!!” Sergio screamed, as he desperately tried to find a place to quench his burning jeans. <br />
<br />
Ty saw the desperate situation that the bullies were in and chuckled for a moment. Then he immediately reacted, and wished for a small hole to form in the parking lot, which was filled to the edge with fresh, cold water. Both Sergio and Doug ended up falling into the small lake, putting out the fire on their behinds!<br />
<br />
Then, the twin brothers climbed out of the pool, completely drenched and shivering of the cold, as they tried to get into their car with their clothes soaking wet! Then they pulled out of the lot, and they drove on to the street going faster than 90 miles per hour!<br />
<br />
Ty grinned when he saw their escape, but he became slightly scared when he was left behind to face the towering dragon alone!<br />
<br />
“Oh Peter, you had better meet me on the school parking lot… I’m standing before a live dragon!” Ty thought, as he slowly backed off from the mighty beast. He was struck with fear, but then he was relieved to see that the dragon did not mean to harm him at all.<br />
<br />
Three seconds later, Ty’s cousin Peter magically appeared out of nowhere, standing right besides Ty and looking up at the dragon with absolute amazement!<br />
<br />
“Holy smoke! Where did THAT come from?” Peter wondered, as he grabbed Ty by the shoulders and put himself in front of Ty in order to shield him from the dragon.<br />
<br />
“Guysss rrrelax, it`sss me, Pete! Well, that name doesss not sssuit thisss forrrm, I am known in thisss forrrm asss Wyrrraach Urrr!” the dragon then said to the two Wizards.<br />
<br />
“Wow! That’s awesome! You can turn into a dragon?” Ty shouted at him.<br />
<br />
“Amazing!” Peter said out loud.<br />
<br />
“Now then… Would you like a rrride rrround thissss city? I don’t mind!” the dragon replied to the two students.<br />
<br />
Both Ty and Peter turned towards each other and smiled. Next, Peter grabbed a hold of Ty’s arm with his hand, and he helped his cousin climb on to Wyraach Ur’s back. Once he was sitting on the back of the mighty dragon’s scaled, long neck, Ty extended his arm and pulled Peter up on the dragon’s neck. Peter sat next to Ty because he was bigger and the heaviest. <br />
<br />
Ty then wished for a thick, leather collar to tightly form around Wyraach Ur’s neck so that he had something firm to hold on to while the dragon was airborn. Peter held on to Ty’s shoulders, as the great, black dragon took a few quick, long steps as it allowed it’s magnificent wings to spread out in order to catch the next gust of wind.<br />
<br />
The dragon gracefully soared in the air, and both Ty and Peter laughed as the cold, hard wind blew in their faces. The dragon ascended quickly, flapping its mighty wings while allowing its large lizard-like form to silently pass over the buildings of the city.<br />
<br />
Traffic in the city came to a complete standstill when people looked up to see the mighty dragon as it soared across the sky! People began to scream and there was panic everywhere as the shadow of the giant, winged lizard silently passed over the outskirts of town. <br />
<br />
Then the dragon gently banked to the right as it circled the area wher the high school was located, and after a few moments, the giant beast gently landed on the parking lot, with its feet touching the pavement first. For Ty and Peter, it was a ride of their life! The thrill of riding on the neck of a live dragon was incredible, and they realized that a unique opportunity like this one would be something they would never forget!<br />
<br />
The dragon then lowered its neck so that the snout touched the ground, allowing for Peter and Ty to slide off the dragon. When they were both on their feet, they both smiled as they looked up at the friendly dragon whch towered over them. The dragon then stuck out its forked toungue, indicating that it felt happy and safe with these two students. <br />
<br />
Then it closed its eye lids, allowing for the transformation back into human form to take hold. Within seconds, the large, winged lizard began to shrink. When it was about nine feet tall, its form began to change as well. The thick, black scales suddenly turned back to flesh, the beak and snout shrunk back, allowing the head to resemble that of a human being. The mighty draconic legs and claws turned back into human legs with feet and toes, the tail and wings shrunk until they disappeared, and where there was a large dragon; there was now a naked, teenage boy who was sitting on his knees on the paved ground.<br />
<br />
Peter and Ty immediately ran towards Pete, whose face was red as a tomato. Hair had grown back on his head and his legs, as the final transformation was now complete. Wyraach Ur, the mighty dragon, has disappeared, leaving the fragile, tall and skinny British student in its place. <br />
<br />
Pete was breathing hard as he was clearly exhausted from the transformation. His face had sweated everywhere, and he felt hot and tired. He was still panting when Ty helped him to get back on his feet. <br />
<br />
Peter immediately wished for Pete to wear his basketball clothes, so he wouldn’t catch cold and also so he wouldn’t walk around naked on the parking lot. Pete’s transformation had completely destroyed his clothing, so Peter and Ty decided to lend him some of their own clothes. Both Ty and Peter held on to Pete, who slowly began to breathe normally again.<br />
<br />
“I’m thirsty… I need some water… My throat feels hot and dry…” Pete whispered. Immediately Ty had wished for a big, plastic mug, which was filled to the rim with water and ice. Pete took the mug from Ty and started to gulp from it, drinking the cold ice water as if he had spent several hours in the hot, burning desert!<br />
<br />
“Are you feeling better, now?” Ty asked Pete, who was clearly still very tired from the dramatic transformation. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, Jason came running onto the parking lot.<br />
<br />
“PETE!! PETE!! Oh my God… WHAT HAPPENED?” he shouted, when he saw that Ty and Peter had to help him walk into the building. <br />
<br />
Once inside the building, Peter wished for five chairs to appear in the hallway, set up in a small circle. They sat Pete down, and Ty got more cold water from the water fountain. Peter then explained to Jason what had happened. <br />
<br />
“Ethan had lured me all the way to the football field, and then he wan away! I had no idea what was going on!” Jason said to Ty.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry! Sergio and Doug tried to beat him up, and they got burned instead!” Ty explained to Jason.<br />
<br />
“Those JERKS! Why, when I get my hands on those guys tomorrow…” Jason shouted in anger.<br />
<br />
“Oh they won’t dare mess with Pete ever again! Trust me!” Peter replied calmly.<br />
<br />
“I will take care of Ethan tomorrow!!” Ty said, showing a wide grin on his face!<br />
<br />
“I don’t think there will be a need for that! Once Doug and Sergio tell him what had happened to them today, they will never come near you guys again!” Peter said, with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
All three boys, Ty, Peter and Jason were happy to see that Pete was looking better as he had regained some strength. His face wasn’t so red anymore, and most of the sweat was gone from his face.<br />
<br />
“Ty and Peter; Thank you so much for sticking with me. I’m so sorry if I had scared you. Please, don’t hold this against me… I still long to be your friends…” Pete pleaded with them, as he wiped the last sweat from his face with his hand.<br />
<br />
“No problem, Wyraach Ur!” Ty chuckled, as he patted Pete on the back.<br />
<br />
“You’re one of us now, Pete! Why don’t you come over to our house for dinner?” Peter said to Jason and Pete.<br />
<br />
“Thank you! I’m starving! I feel like I’m hungry as a… a…” Pete stuttered for a moment.<br />
<br />
“Hungry as a dragon?” Ty said, completing the sentence for him.<br />
<br />
“Hey, we can ask Wyraach Ur to light the barbeque for us!” Peter said. <br />
<br />
The whole group broke out in laughter as they allowed their newest member to gain his strength. Pete’s face turned red once again, but this time it was from laughing! Then Ty stood up, closed his eyes, and the five boys disappeared from the hallway, leaving only five empty chairs behind. <br />
