<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Arich had always felt like he didn&#39;t belong anywhere. While he loved his parents and didn&#39;t wish to blame them for his problems, he felt like most of his problems could be traced back to their seemingly-incompatible union. His parents were a textbook case of opposite attracting. His father was descended from Norwegian immigrants and was a big Nordic man. His mother was a first-generation immigrant from Thailand and was tiny and dainty. The end result was him: too dark-skinned and slant-eyed to mingle among whites, too tall and blue-eyed to mingle among Asians. Even his name signified he didn&#39;t belong anywhere. His mother insisted on giving him a name from her land since he already had his father&#39;s last name. Arich meant &#39;unknown&#39; in Thai and that&#39;s often how he felt about himself.<br />
<br />
And that wasn&#39;t even bringing in the mood-swings he had to deal with since he was 8 years old. His parents hadn&#39;t thought it was a problem at the time. It was pretty normal for kids to be very emotional at that age. But eventually, they noticed that Arich was hyperactive and bouncing off the walls one day and being gloomy and lethargic the next. A trip to the pediatrician confirmed that Arich had a minor aberration in his brain that caused a chemical imbalance which caused a bipolar swing between his moods. Thankfully, the medication needed to &#39;even his moods&#39; was simple and inexpensive to acquire.<br />
<br />
But that was then. As the years went by, the price of medicine started to go up. There were also times where the antidepressants didn&#39;t seem to be enough. Though at least one time it was forgivable after his parents died during the avian flu epidemic a few years back. For a time, his depression episodes were far more common than his manic episodes. It also appeared that his medication wasn&#39;t doing as much as it used to. That was when Arich tried making his own medicine with St. John&#39;s wort. It didn&#39;t really work very well, especially when he suffered from the nausea and bowel cramps. Finally, it all became too much and he was contemplating suicide until he heard how Animalian conversion can help mental problems. Figuring he had nothing left to lose, he sold all his possessions to move to Lyre.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you certain that this is the course of action you want to take?&quot; asked Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
&quot;If conversion can finally fix my bipolar brain, I don&#39;t see what the problem is,&quot; said Arich.<br />
<br />
&quot;As it&#39;s most a physically neurological problem, I&#39;m not doubtful it won&#39;t work,&quot; said Dr. Jones, &quot;It&#39;s just that those who chose to go through Project Hermaphroditus do so because they are transgender. Do you identify yourself as a woman?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, I never really felt like I had an identity,&quot; said Arich, &quot;I didn&#39;t really as much for girls than I did for boys. I guess that makes me asexual or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you don&#39;t have any objection to becoming a bisexual wolf?&quot; asked Dr. Jones.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyone and anything is better than who I am right now,&quot; said Arich.<br />
<br />
Dr. Jones frowned a little. This man will probably need some therapy after his conversion. Hopefully being part of a pack will help him out. &quot;Very well, I suppose I can clear you for conversion, so long as you understand the consequences.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have everything to gain and nothing to lose,&quot; said Arich with a shrug.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Arich wasn&#39;t really sure what to expect with this. Well, he had the most basic idea, which why he was down to his underwear in the changing room. He wasn&#39;t sure which hermaphrodite wolf he should expect to come into the room and convert him, not that he would know who was who. Imagine his surprise when the whole herm pack ended up coming through the door. Like Arich, they were down to their underwear, which consisted of a bra and a pair of briefs. They could easily pass for amazonian women in body type, though the tends in their briefs made it clear what they were equipped with.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arich, my name is Lunette,&quot; said the one wolf with human tresses, &quot;These are Night Runner, Chelsea, Dusky, and Paula. And we&#39;re here to induct you into our pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All of you?&quot; asked Arich, &quot;Is that really necessary?<br />
<br />
&quot;Not strictly,&quot; said Dusky, &quot;It would only take one of us to convert you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we are a pack,&quot; said Chelsea, &quot;Which means we stick together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We want you to feel like you&#39;re really one of us,&quot; said Night Runner, &quot;That you belong in our pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
That touched Arich more than he thought it would. For as long as he could remember, he never fit in with anyone. Now these Animalians were welcoming him with open arms. He walked towards Lunette, who appeared to be the leader. Lunette understood what he wanted and unfastened her bra. Arich latched onto her nipple with more fervor than when he was at his own mother&#39;s breast.<br />
<br />
As Arich suckled, the other wolves got themselves comfortable as they slipped out of their underwear. There were a few sighs of relief as breasts bounced free and cocks could emerge from sheathes without restraint. Arich didn&#39;t recoil when the wolves started petting him as his new fur stared growing in, pale grey hair quickly covering his skin. He didn&#39;t resist when they pulled off his underwear. They were getting a little snug as his ass and hips were getting bigger and his tail started to grow out.<br />
<br />
Arich could feel more intimate changes happening in his body. His chest was swelling out as he grew his own breasts. His cock became longer, redder, and pointier as a sheath developed around the base. Arich gave a few whimpers of pleasure as wolfs hands groped as his ass, feeling behind his balls until a cleft opened up, an opening to a moistening tunnel. A wolf cock prodded at the entrance before Paula whispered into Arich&#39;s furry ear, &quot;You mind if we call you Erica?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erica moaned as hir voice went up several octaves. &quot;Call me whatever you want, just don&#39;t stop,&quot; shi moaned as her face started pushing out into a muzzle. Shi let out a yip as a wolf dick plunged into hir new pussy. Shi had no idea this kind of sex would feel so good. But better than the sex was a new sense of peace. For the first time in hir life, shi felt like shi really knew who shi was.</p>
