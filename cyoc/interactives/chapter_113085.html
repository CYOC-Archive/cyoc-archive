<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wednesday morning came early and Dieter Wilhelm&#39;s second agent found it still dark when he got up. It was dark, but that suited him, as he figured that might give him time to get ready and get to a spot where he could observe the apartment building that he&#39;d found as the third address in the local phone book with the name &quot;Jenkins.&quot; Bored because of a lack of action and with no further updates from the first agent, who the second agent didn&#39;t know was dead, the second agent had decided he would get something done. There might be a lot of surveillance going on, but he&#39;d also found little serious indication of any major terrorist activity and what there was seemed too vague to be worth a major effort. And in fact that seemed to be more gang warfare rather than terrorists. In this, the second agent figured he might just be able to get it done as a drive-by before &quot;Harry&quot; Jenkins could make it to his car, and would be well on his way out of Moon Lake before anything happened.<br />
<br />
Some of it was rather odd in many ways, but the second agent wasn&#39;t one to really try to think things through, though this benefited Moon Lake. If he really thought it through, he might have gotten the sense that there was something of a hoax going on. Either someone tricked the first agent or the first agent was in on it, which might have made him braver with regard to hunting down Harry Jenkins. However, with his patience at its end, the second agent dressed himself and put on a decent sized jacket. It wasn&#39;t something that would be worn in a bad blizzard but it was fairly warm and had enough &quot;weight&quot; to it that he could hide a handgun inside it, and after dressing himself and practically inhaling a pop tart, the second agent made his way out with his gun <br />
<br />
Once was out he made his way to his car and was soon on his way. It felt good to be out and not just sitting and waiting for either an alert that things were better from the first agent or from instructions from Dieter Wilhelm. It gave the second agent the sense of being able to do something as he drove along the streets of what amounted to a pretty sleepy little town in the Cascade Mountains. Some things struck him as rather odd, as the only part of the town that seemed to be laid out like a normal town was a small central area, but things on the edge of town seemed to radiate out like the spokes of an old wagon wheel. It was odd, but the second agent figured that things like that was just something that was either geographically determined by where the town was built or due to some odd decisions on part of the people who originally laid out the town.<br />
<br />
&quot;And people think us guys from Alabama are bumpkins,&quot; the second agent thought to himself as the drove along.<br />
<br />
The apartment building wasn&#39;t like what one would consider the stereotypical apartment building. More often than not, people thought of largely rectangular buildings that rose up above the skyline and were only topped by the great skyscrapers of major cities. This apartment building was only two floors and was longer than it was wide and seemed to be made out of wood paneling or something that looked a lot like it. He also noted a portable air conditioners in almost every window, which meant it didn&#39;t have central air conditioning. It had a narrow parking lot on each side of the apartment building and the second agent was quick to realize that he couldn&#39;t just sit in the parking lot near the the truck that he had identified as belonging to one of the Jenkins in Moon Lake. There simply wasn&#39;t room and with the way the parking lot was arranged, he&#39;d have to practically double back to get out of the parking lot which would give any security and police forces time to catch up with him.<br />
<br />
That left the agent with the task of parking on the street near the apartment complex. It&#39;d mean he&#39;d have to tail &quot;Harry Jenkins&quot; as he either went to his job or to wherever Jennifer Harper was staying in this Washington State town, but it wasn&#39;t as if he really had that much choice. He had to make do with the cards he was dealt and figured he might be able to manage something when his target got to his work place, but he&#39;d have to go from there. So, he parked his car and simply waited.<br />
<br />
As he waited, the second agent looked around, mostly to buy time. It was still relatively early, but by now the sun was rising over the eastern horizon and many people would be beginning their day. The apartment was the beginning of one of the spokes that went off from the center of Moon Lake and like many of these spokes was a residential neighborhood. Things were fairly quiet with little to no traffic, about the worst traffic was a guy driving his car and tossing newspapers to the front door of the houses on the street. The agent noted that he got out and carried a stack of newspapers into the apartment building, but reappeared quickly enough for the agent to assume that he dropped the newspapers off in a lobby and then left. However, the paper delivery man didn&#39;t hold the second agent&#39;s attention for long. The next person he saw DID hold his attention.<br />
<br />
One of the garage doors from a nearby house opened and a person came out towing a large green garbage tote. That by itself wasn&#39;t that much, but the fact that the person was female and looked like she was dressed only in a short bathrobe that barely came down past her hips was something that would attract attention and the second agent was no exception to that. The agent found himself marveling at her as she pulled her garbage tote to the street. She had a fairly narrow waist and was very well endowed with regard to her bust line, which her robe barely covered. He also found that her hips were not only wide but very wide to give her the almost perfect pear shaped body and was enough to make the second agent follow her every move. If she noticed him watching, she paid no attention to him. She took her garbage tote to the curb and then went back inside, pausing only to bend over and pick up her newspaper, revealing that she was wearing white panties with blue stripes.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s like a Victoria&#39;s Secret retirement community,&quot; the second agent thought lustfully, thinking on how so many of the women seemed to fit the most attractive of all the female body types that there were. Every woman that he had seen in this town seemed to be very well built. That was fairly odd, but not something that the second agent was going to complain over. He watched the woman until she disappeared into her garage and the door soon shut a few moments later.<br />
<br />
With that handled, the second agent turned his head back toward the hotel only to see the truck that he figured belonged to Harold Jenkins, and actually belonged to Henry &quot;Huck&quot; Jenkins Junior, driving up the street away from him. In a lustful pause, he had failed to notice his target come out, walk to his truck, start the engine, and then drive away. The second agent cursed and threw his car into drive and drove after him. He might have to change his plans a bit, but he had no room to complain about that now. It had happened and he had failed to notice his target leaving.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn,&quot; the second agent cursed, &quot;of all the times to see a hot babe in a skimpy bathrobe...&quot;<br />
<br />
Much of his plans for his mission had been shot, but the second agent followed figuring something might come up.</p>
