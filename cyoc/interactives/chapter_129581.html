<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite the girls being nervous they eventually all agreed to show Sasha the ring of Age. Much to Gloria and her friends relieve Sasha promised to keep it a secret. As Gloria now exited the bus with her friends they began happily talking about what they should do with the ring.<br />
<br />
“So yur sister used to have that thing,” Sasha asked staring at the ring. “Yeah,” Gloria said, holding it out. “She and her friends found it when she was around our age. She says that with it we can make things better for people.” Sasha rubbed her chin thoughtfully as she now thought of all the fun they could have with it. <br />
<br />
After homeroom the girls found themselves in history class. From what they had been told their original teacher, Mr. Jenkins was taking an extended leave of absence due to illness. Gloria and her friends now found themselves excited about their new teacher. While Mr. Jenkins was okay he was becoming quite old, meaning that many of the student had a tendency to fool around. This was especially troublesome for Gloria and her friends as they were forced to deal with their bully Morgan and her friends.<br />
<br />
Morgan was the most popular girl in the freshman class. A tall leggy girl with large c cup breasts, a models face and fiery red hair. Morgan seemed to make a habit out of intimidating Gloria and her friends. Although Sasha was able to fend the bully off when she was around, Morgan and her girls made a habit out of finding Gloria or one of her friends when they were by themselves. As Gloria now entered the class she could see her friends gathered towards the corner, while Morgan and her friends sat in the other. Morgan now smirked devilishly at Gloria as she made her way towards her friends.<br />
<br />
“What took you,” Jackie moaned. “Morgan and her puss posse were shooting spitballs at me and Felicia.”<br />
<br />
Gloria frowned as she watched Felicia and Jackie pull spitballs from their hair. “Sorry,” she said meekly. “I had to stop at my locker before class.”<br />
<br />
“It was a good thing Sasha came in when she did,” Felicia said quietly. “As soon as she walked in Morgan and the rest of them went to the other side of the classroom.”<br />
<br />
“Good thing too,” Sasha grumbled. “I was about to grab that bitch by the hair and swing her around.”<br />
<br />
Felicia and Diane now tried to calm Sasha down as the dark haired teen gritted her teeth. Gloria smirked as she realized how fortunate they were to have Sasha as a friend. The girl, while skinny, was intimidating, still Gloria didn’t want to see their friend get in trouble. “We’ll be okay Sasha,” Gloria said warmly. “You know how she is, once the numbers aren’t in her favor she backs down. No need to get detention again.”<br />
<br />
Sasha sighed as she made her way towards her desk. Glaring at Morgan, once again the teen sat down as she waited for the teacher. Felicia and Diane now went to their seats next to Sasha as Jackie sat down next to Gloria. “Glad Sasha’s on our side,” Jackie whispered. Gloria nodded before smiling. “I know and too think you didn’t want her as a friend at first.” Jackie blushed slightly causing Gloria to giggle softly.<br />
<br />
“Class can I have your attention,” a voice said. Turning the girls now saw a young man enter the classroom. Gloria gasped as she immediately recognized him as Claudia’s older brother Derrick.<br />
<br />
“Morning class,” Derrick said with a smile. “My name is Mr. Harris and it looks like I’ll be your teacher for the remainder of the year. I already reviewed Mr. Jenkins notes and will be following what he has planned for you. However, I want you to enjoy this class so I plan to include things that Mr. Jenkins didn’t. Hopefully by the end of the year you will have an appreciation of history.”<br />
<br />
Gloria smiled as she looked at the young teacher. Gloria had gotten to know Derrick casually through Katie and Kellie. The 25 year old had graduated from college with a degree in history and gone on to become a history teacher. Once he had finished his student teaching he had tried to get a full time position at the high school. While no position had opened yet, the school did like useing him as a sub. From what Gloria had heard Mr. Harris was one of the best subs in the district. Hopefully this long term sub position would lead to a full time position.<br />
<br />
“Isn’t that your friends brother Derrick,” Felicia whispered. Gloria nodded and smiled as she watched Mr. Harris. “Wow,” Felicia said. “You know a teacher...and a cute one at that.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me Felicia is there a problem.”<br />
<br />
Felicia squeaked as she turned red with embarrassment. “Ummm no sir,” She squeaked turning red with embarrassment. Morgan and her friends now giggled as they glared at the embarrassed girl.<br />
<br />
Derrick furrowed his eyes as he now turned to look at Morgan. “Something funny Morgan,” Morgan froze as she looked at her upset teacher. “No,” she said, trying to maintain a defiant tone. Derrick lowered his head as he gave Morgan a hard look. “I hope not Morgan because i will not tolerate fooling around in my class. I already know quite a bit about you and I must say it’s not good. If you think I’m going to let you coast this year you have another thing coming.”<br />
<br />
Morgan gaped as she looked at Derrick. She was usually quite good at convincing teachers she was perfectly innocent of anything. Unfortunately it didn’t seem that he was going to buy any of her b.s. “Sorry Mr. Harris,” she said meekly.<br />
<br />
Derrick now looked towards Gloria, giving her a knowing smirk. “What did Claudia tell him,” Gloria thought in amazement. “Does he know I have the ring?”<br />
<br />
“Well class,” he said clearing his throat. “I’m hoping for a good year. I want you to leave with an appreciation of history. As long as you put in the effort I can help make this class enjoyable. All I ask in return is your attention.”<br />
<br />
Derrick now looked directly at Gloria as he spoke. “Oh and one last thing,” he said with a smirk. “Act your AGE. We’re in high school boys and girls. The time for fooling around comes to an end now.”<br />
<br />
Jackie, Felicia, Diane and Sasha now turned in shock as Gloria went slack jawed. Gloria and her friends had understand the meaning of Mr. Harris’s sentence. He was aware that she now possessed the ring of Age And would be keeping an eye on her. Gloria now shifted slightly as she placed her hand over the ring. Derrick was going to be interesting as a teacher. Gloria now realized that her and her friends would need to be careful with anything they did with the ring.</p>
