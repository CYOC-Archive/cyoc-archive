<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Yvette Smith, fugitive werevixen, stopped to rest by the stream. Her escape from jail was a crime of opportunity. No pre-planning or accomplices, just plain dumb luck that werecoyote tried to make a break for it and Yvette managed to get away in the confusion.<br />
But now that she had time to stop and rest, Yvette realized that she needed to plan ahead.<br />
<i>The cops will be watching my place, along with my darling&#39;s house, and campus security will keep an eye on him at school, but there&#39;s got to be some way I can reunite with <b>my</b> William and get him away from that bitch he&#39;s stuck with,</i> thought Yvette, as hatred danced across her feral eyes in regards to Martha Anderson.<br />
<i>Maybe we can go somewhere and start anew. I hear Canada has some nice forest lands,</i> as she started lapping from the stream to quench her thirst.<br />
<i>I&#39;ll have to stay alert, avoid capture, come up with a viable plan, and find some clothes between now and Monday morning, but I can certainly live off the land between now and then,</i> as her fox senses detected a warren of sleeping (normal) rabbits nearby.<br />
Yvette slowly crawled toward her prey, licking her muzzle in anticipation of a late dinner.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
William and Martha Anderson, along with Samantha and Frances Twist, were gathered in the Anderson family&#39;s living room with their younger son Eric.<br />
The four adults had a very brief discussion concerning what was about to happen, before Samantha and Frances joined Eric on the living room sofa, one lady on either side of the boy.<br />
&quot;Now Eric,&quot; began his mother, standing next to his father in front of the sofa. &quot;We know a lot has happened over the last couple of days, but there is something we need to discuss in greater detail.&quot;<br />
&quot;The whys and hows don&#39;t matter,&quot; said William, &quot;but your mother and I are both weres now too. I&#39;m a werefox, and she is a werecat.&quot;<br />
&quot;Like them?&quot; asked Eric, pointing to the Twists.<br />
&quot;Yes dear, like them,&quot; confirmed Martha, &quot;but there&#39;s nothing to be afraid of. None of us, nor Ben or Nate, would ever harm you or make you do something against your will.&quot;<br />
&quot;But, you have yet to see the new us in the best of circumstances, and it&#39;s time we correct that,&quot; added his father, before nodding at Martha.<br />
Then both Andersons allowed their inner selves to come forward. Eric watched in rapt fascination as his parents gained fur, pointed ears, and tails popped out from the back of their clothing. Soon a fully developed male werefox and a fully developed female werecat, wearing his parents&#39; clothes, stood before Eric.<br />
&quot;We may look different, but it&#39;s still us son,&quot; said William, as both he and Martha slowly turned around in circles to let their son get a full look at their other personas.<br />
&quot;Does it hurt?&quot; asked Eric, staring at his furry parents.<br />
&quot;No. It doesn&#39;t,&quot; said his mother, with a bit of a smile on her feline face.<br />
&quot;Do you like being... like that?&quot; asked Eric.<br />
&quot;It took some getting used to on my part,&quot; admitted his father, because of the circumstances surrounding Yvette, &quot;but it is an interesting experience.&quot;<br />
&quot;Definitely,&quot; agreed his mother, staring at the trio on the couch.<br />
Samantha and Frances returned Martha&#39;s smile, but now was not the time to contemplate more pleasurable pursuits as Eric asked, &quot;So what happens now?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, when Nate comes home tomorrow, we&#39;ll have him show you his werewolf form, just so you know what we all look like furry,&quot; answered his dad. &quot;But as far as you&#39;re concerned, you are Eric Anderson, our youngest son who we love very much.&quot;<br />
&quot;Whether or not you ever decide to become a were yourself, let alone what kind of were, is totally up to you. There will never be any pressure from any of us to favor one possibility over another,&quot; said Martha.<br />
&quot;Certainly not from me, my wife, or Ben,&quot; said Samantha.<br />
&quot;And since we&#39;re friends of your family, we&#39;d like to be your friend too,&quot; Frances said, looking at Eric.<br />
Without even pausing to think about it, Eric said, &quot;Cool. But what do we do about that werevixen?&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Samantha, a bit concerned.<br />
&quot;I overheard enough to realize that you&#39;re all worried because she&#39;s escaped from jail. So what do we do about that?&quot; asked Eric.<br />
&quot;Between everyone in this room, Nate and Ben, and a lot of my friends, we can make sure all of us stay safe until she&#39;s caught and put back in prison where she belongs,&quot; swore Samantha.<br />
<br />
After William and Martha resumed their human forms, the adults started talking about plans and contingency plans in case of dire emergencies, until it got to the point where Martha asked if she should put on a pot of coffee.<br />
Eric excused himself to go to bed, while Martha went into the kitchen to start brewing a fresh pot. Seeing it was almost midnight, she reached into her purse and took her werecat birth control pill for Sunday.<br />
<i>Damn that werebitch!</i> thought Martha, as she washed the medication down with some tap water. <i>Until Yvette&#39;s out of our fur once and for all, we&#39;re never going to know any peace! William and I will never have a chance at total reconciliation as long as she&#39;s in the picture. And the thought of Eric being at risk...</i> as she shuddered.<br />
<i>Then again, if I&#39;m going to re-enter the workforce, the last thing I need with my increased fertility is to become pregnant again before I&#39;ve even found a new job,</i> she realized, while putting the pill bottle back in her purse.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, unbeknownst to any of the adults downstairs, while Eric Anderson might have gone upstairs to his room for the night, he had yet to go to bed.<br />
His fingers played over the buttons of his phone until the text message was composed and sent.<br />
<br />
&quot;IS IT 2 LATE 2 TALK?&quot;<br />
Julie Stovall read the message three times, her heart beating faster with each word over the thought of conversing with Eric again.<br />
<br />
Eric smiled as he read Julie&#39;s reply.<br />
SHOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS 2 U SOONER. HERE&#39;S MY E-MAIL ADDY...<br />
The two young freshman students then spent the next hour and a half exchanging e-mails until exhaustion started to claim them both and they reluctantly said good night.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Nate looked over his new furry self as the rest of his new pack surrounded him in their werewolf forms.<br />
His smile was a big wide grin of pointed teeth across his muzzle as Ben came up and shook his paw. &quot;Congratulations and welcome to our extended family.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; said Nate, as he howled again, an exclamation of excitement that several of the other werewolves joined in.<br />
Then Nate turned and hugged Alex. &quot;Thank you.&quot; Then Nate couldn&#39;t help himself and kissed his fellow werewolf the best he could muzzle to muzzle.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re very welcome,&quot; said Alex, after Nate broke off the kiss.<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t want to put any additional pressure on you, but I have a confession to make. That was my first time,&quot; admitted Nate.<br />
Alex stared at his new pack mate for a moment, until he realized what Nate meant. &quot;REALLY?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Nate, looking at the other werewolf with more than thoughts of friendship in his eyes.<br />
&quot;Well, no matter what Austin and the others might want to do for the rest of the night, <i>we&#39;re</i> going to find someplace more quiet to have some further... conversations,&quot; said Alex, with a smile on his muzzle. &quot;Besides, you still have to return the favor to fully complete your transformation.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m <i>very much</i> looking forward to that,&quot; replied Nate, as he made the bold move to hold Alex&#39;s paw in his own.</p>
