<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sky was beginning to darken as dusk approached, but Ty and Eric were hopeful as in the distance they could make out a plethora of lights and some tall towers, indicating that the road they were on did indeed lead to a city.  There was hope for them yet, and it seemed like they would make it there before night fell.  <br />
<br />
As they walked, around a twist they came upon an unusual sight.  Alone on the side of the vacant road, was a wooden stall, decorated in magical fetishes and lit by several glowing crystals in purples and pinks.  A cartoonish sign above read ‘Esmerelda’s Morphic Mishap Fixing Station’.  <br />
<br />
As the two got close, they say that seated behind the table laden with magical tomes and jars full of body parts, was a slender human woman, dressed in classical witch’s garb, with a tall pointy black hat, gothic makeup, long black hair, and a prodigious chest that showed off perhaps too much cleavage.  She smiled as the two approached, waving politely to the two confused adventurers.  “Welcome customers, to my little enterprise!  I know what you are wondering, and yes, I can help fix all those strange changes you’ve gone through, for a price of course.”  Ty and Eric looked at each other excitedly.  <br />
<br />
Ty spoke up.  “That sounds good and all, but what are you doing out here in the middle of the road, and not in the city?” He said, pointing to the gates in the distance.  <br />
<br />
“Well,” she said with a grin and a wink, “The authorities of Vale don’t look too kindly on my work, although they seem just fine to let the alchemists run rampant with their crazed concoctions and morphic droughts.  So I set up on the outskirts, where they won’t bother me.”<br />
<br />
“Still sounds kind of fishy, but I guess that checks out,” Eric said.  “So, if you could fix us, how much would it cost?”  As he said this, he pulled out the bag of coin they had looted from the bandits earlier.  <br />
<br />
The witch took the bag and made a show of hefting it and counting out the coins.  She then returned it to Eric.  “Certainly not enough, but I can work out an appropriate payment.”  She then produced two vials of shimmering orange liquid. “Here, drink these first.  They’ll make it a lot easier to craft and rework your bodies.”  Eric nearly took it, but Ty placed a hand in front of him.  <br />
<br />
“Wait, how do we even know you can do what you say?  Could you at least show us something first.” <br />
<br />
The witch giggled and nodded before she made some gestures in the  that made the two feel a little queasy.  Magic like smoke emanated from her hands, and with a flourish she swirled it about her head.  Quickly, she popped it off, holding the living head in her right arm while her headless shoulders were now covered in clear skin, making it seem like no head had ever been there.  She then spun her head around, neck facing the two, and made a pussy appear under her neck.  Then she tossed her head over the table where it morphed midair into a pair of nude legs with the witch’s hat still atop them.  The legs did a little pose before they jumped onto her shoulders and turned back into her head.  “Convinced?” She asked coyly.<br />
<br />
The pair nodded and accepted the potions.  Almost immediately the pair felt a wave of heat come over them.  Their knees buckled, then gave way as the two of them fell to their asses and began frantically pulling at their clothes.  Eric. Was able to take off his top before his dick neck exploded out of his torso and landed on the other side of the road.  His dick limbs, having less propulsive power, came again and again inside of his torso while his loose arms fingered the cunt in his shoulders.  Ty was not so lucky, and chest cocks burst forth from his shirt before he could unwrap them, shredding the fabric easily.  His hands shakily tore off the wraps on his head before ripping his face from its hiding place and smashing it against the pussy on his head.  His open hand pathetically stroked his cock as the Tiefling moaned into her head.  <br />
<br />
The witch cackled madly as she walked over to the masturbating adventurers.  “Not too bright are you?  Who lets a witch give them an unmarked potion, especially when the witch is just randomly on the road?”  She laughed again as she got closer to Ty, savoring his inability to stop stroking himself or eating out his own cunt.  “I wasn’t technically lying though.  I will help you your changes, although that will be at my discretion.  I do so love getting creative.”  She knelt down and examined the writhing Tiefling, taking special note of her detached face.  “Hmm, stinks of fey magic, which makes it hard to break, but valuable to have.  Let’s see…”. <br />
<br />
She grabbed Ty’s face, leaving several snail trails coming from it to his head.  Don’t want to lose face haha!  Let’s stick this back on and make sure it won’t fall off.”  She then reached down to his crotch and cooed as she heft up his monster prick.  “Hope you like your own smell, cause you’re going to be down here for a while.”  She then took his face and began to knead it into his pelvis, much like his skin was more putty than flesh.  Even in his fevered masturbation frenzy he could feel his face deforming, melting into his groin.  He felt his mouth melt away, then suddenly return, but it felt all wrong, too wet.  At the same time, his vision shifted to just above his cock, with his eyes and nose now resting just above his pubic hair, which tickled his nose something terrible, but not as bad as having to now constantly smell his own musk.  He left out a moan, and felt it come not from his mouth, but from the cunt tucked away behind the massive balls of his dick.  <br />
<br />
“Hmm, and for payment I think I’ll take… ohh, that would be good!  I don’t have much fey-touched flesh, so this should be fun!”, she said as she picked up Ty’s head and placed it into her stall.  “But, it does feel kind of wrong to just leave that space empty.  How about this?”  She traced her finger along the empty space in his shoulders, and a huge vagina blossomed into being, reaching from his sternum to his back, with a massive clit topping it off.  “There, now you can help your friend out if they need a body ride!”<br />
<br />
The witch patted Ty on the pussy and skipped over to the cum drenched Eric, passing his body and picking up his head, letting its giant testicles press up against her own bosom.  “Have to hand it to you, this one is pretty messed up.  Even I make sure to either let people stay in one or two pieces, but this is too much.”  She looked back to the demure dark elf body lying on the ground.  “Can’t say that wouldn’t make for a nice piece though.  Let’s just make this one easy then, I’ll just get you a new body to sit in and I’ll take that mess of parts off your hands.”  Head in hand, she walked back to the stall and pulled out a strange box carved with intricate runes.  Setting the head down, she began to touch the runes in a specific pattern, muttering about which one she should choose.  Eventually her mind was made up and she pressed a rune on the cube, causing it to light up and float in the air. A portal then opened, leading to what looked like a storage facility, full of bodies and body parts.  The witch went in, and a few seconds later she came back out, leading someone by the hand.  Trailing behind her like an obedient dog came the massive body of a female orc.  The body was headless, extremely muscular, covered in tribal tattoos on the arms and back, and awash in battle scars.  It was clothed in fur boots, a loincloth that did nothing to hid the hairy pussy behind it, and a strip of leather to hide the bodies non-existent tits, nor concealed her unshaven pits.  The body brimmed with power, but had no will of its own.  <br />
<br />
The witch bade the body kneel down so its bare shoulders would be even with her head.  Placing a hand on the empty neck space, she drew and circle, causing a large puckered anus to grow in between the orc’s shoulders.  She then took Eric’s head and shoved it into the upper asshole, leaving his massive balls to hang over the orc’s flat breasts.  The witch studied the combination for a second, before deciding she wasn’t completely satisfied.  She pressed on his ballsack, causing it to deflate with a quick ‘pop’.  First the right testicle, then the left.  At the same time, as one ball disappeared, the corresponding breast on the orc grew in size until the orc body now had tits larger than its owners head.  Now beneath Eric’s chin there was just cock, although still massive.  Not one to miss things, the witch also slightly enlarged Eric’s head to match his new body.  She then gave the body a playful slap on the ass and said, “Enjoy that bad girl my little rogue!  Just be mindful of her needs, or she might turn on you.  temporarily of course.”  Eric, however, heard none of this for as soon as the body was no longer under the witch’s control, her tore his dickneck out and began to furiously fucking his big orc cunt with it.   Ty, still lost in the throes of the lust potion, joined him and began to furiously buttfuck the orc’s big ass, causing his chest dicks to jiggle and cum wildly.<br />
<br />
While they were busy working off the effects of the potion, the witch quietly took her prizes and disappeared into the portal she had made.  Alone, the two fucked well into the night, unable to resist their body’s desires…</p>
