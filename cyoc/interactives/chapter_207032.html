<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the situation with Aunt Violetta, things went back to normal for a couple of days. Rei cringed sometimes though when Miles asked if he could have her aunt&#39;s phone number as she still thought it weird that he was crushing on her. Nat and Rei were walking home together one day when they heard something from the bushes.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think that could be?&quot; Rei asked sounding a little worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s probably nothing, just some idiot trying to prank us. Halloween is still half a month away!&quot; Nat called out to the person in a nearby bush. The person emerged from the bush, but they found it not to be a person but a tabby cat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! How cute!&quot; Nat and Rei said looking over the tabby cat as she rubbed her body against Nat&#39;s legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, Rei, this kitty wants me as its mommy!&quot; Nat squealed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Rei, she&#39;s just being affectionate. Besides do you think your parents will let you keep a pet? Remember when you told your parents you wanted a snake?&quot; Rei reminded her girlfriend making her think back to a time when Nat tried to have a pet snake but accidentally took it outside and it was ran over by a car.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you were supposed to let snakes go outside, it&#39;s an animal, how was I supposed to know?&quot; Nat argued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, good luck asking your parents. I&#39;ve got to go get a start on Ms. McKinnon&#39;s homework tonight.&quot; Rei said as she kissed her girlfriend on the cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye, love you, let&#39;s get hitched!&quot; Rei joked as she headed home.<br />
<br />
******************************************************************<br />
<br />
&quot;Please mom, please mom, please mom! She could just stay for one night?&quot; Nat begged to her mother after she had shown her the cat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Natalia, you know your record with pets is....spotty. Remember the raccoon? Ugh...I remember the raccoon.&quot; Marisa MacGregor shuddered thinking about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;But she looks like such a sweet kitty mom, please?&quot; Nat begged again this time with her damphir beady eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, alright, alright. I regret that I ever taught you to that little trick.&quot; Marisa said shaking her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you mom.&quot; Nat said hugging her mother.<br />
<br />
That night, Nat slept peacefully in her bed, as she did, she sleepily saw the tabby cat lay herself on Nat&#39;s chest as she slept. Nat then began to dream.<br />
<br />
************************************<br />
<br />
Nat dreamed she was at a party in what looked to be the late 18th century as many party guests were telling scary stories. Nat listened as one person began telling a particular scary story and the woman&#39;s voice sounded familiar, it looked like Rei.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must confess to you good people that on my late night strolls I happened upon a temptress of the night. She had hair as red as the fires of hell itself, she was a robust woman and she lured me into a night of pleasure and she has cursed me for all time!&quot; The dream Rei said with horror and then pointed to Nat in the dream.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s the temptress witch now! She&#39;s been touched by the devil!&quot; The dream Rei said as everyone began looking at Nat whose teeth were sharp fangs and her clothes which had been fine a moment ago were now black and torn. Her body was soaked with blood as people began swarming around her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Monster! Monster! Monster!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not a monster! I just want to be a normal girl!&quot; Nat said through her tears.<br />
<br />
**********************************************<br />
<br />
Nat awoke from her nightmare and noticed it was only an hour or so after she had gone to bed. Nat knew Rei hadn&#39;t gone to bed yet as she like to stay up a little late to finish as much homework as she could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Rei, are you still awake?&quot; Nat said over the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I was just about to go to bed, what&#39;s up?&quot; Nat took a moment to compose herself before she asked her friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rei, you don&#39;t think I&#39;m a monster, do you?&quot; Nat said trying not to cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Natty, you know I&#39;ve never thought that about you. I love you as a human or a vampire, or damphir. If we could, I&#39;d marry you right away and....make it worthwhile.&quot; Rei said making Nat blush, she always thought it was funny how Rei could sometimes be a little over romantic about their relationship.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now go to sleep, I love you.&quot; Rei said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Love you too radiant Rei.&quot; Nat said before hanging up the phone.<br />
<br />
Nat looked around her room for a moment but didn&#39;t see the cat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weird, she must&#39;ve gone into another room.&quot; Nat said to herself as she went to sleep.<br />
<br />
***************************************************************<br />
<br />
Over at the Moreland house, Spark was sleeping peacefully, she thought she felt something against her bed but ignored it and went back to sleep. As Spark slept, she began to toss and turn a little in her bed as she began having a nightmare.<br />
<br />
In Spark&#39;s nightmare, she looked around and saw that she was somewhere she didn&#39;t want to be again, the abandoned pharmacy where Jacob Moreland had lost his right arm to vampires.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no, not here, not again. Jacob! Caleb, where are you?&quot; Spark called out to them as she flew around the store looking for them.<br />
<br />
Spark then heard a scream not far away and flew in that direction.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m coming.....Connor?&quot; Spark said softly as she saw that where Jacob had been, it was now an older Connor with his arm pinned against the wall with a sword in his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on and finish me then you bastards.&quot; Connor said through his teeth.<br />
<br />
Spark wanted to fly over and free Connor, but in that moment she felt frozen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ann, should we honor Mr. Moreland&#39;s request and finish him?&quot; The vampire known as Ken asked the sadistic little Ann. Spark&#39;s eyes grew large when she heard the vampire girl stomp her foot once.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! CONNOR! CONNOR!!!!&quot; Spark said as she rushed over to Connor&#39;s side but was too late as the vampire girl ripped out his heart killing him.<br />
<br />
********************************************<br />
<br />
Spark immediately shot awake from her bed sweating. She looked around for a moment to gather her surroundings and realized where she was. She was grateful that it had just been a bad dream, but she still decided to go see Connor. She left her room and softly knocked on Connor&#39;s bedroom door. Spark stood with her back turned to him as he opened it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spark? What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Connor asked concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just....had a bad dream...and needed someone to talk to.&quot; Spark quietly answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Spark, do you...want to....sleep on my bedroom floor or something?&quot; Connor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I....I....I...&quot; Spark tried to answer as she turned around and saw Connor standing there without a shirt on and saw he had a few abs on his stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;When did you....get...get...those?&quot; Spark asked trying to ask as calmly as possible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Oh, yeah, I started working out a little bit. Cool, huh?&quot; Connor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could we...uh, could we sex together...SLEEP, could we sleep together out on the couch?&quot; Spark asked as Connor nodded.<br />
<br />
Connor and Spark sat down on the couch as Connor laid down and Spark laid on top of his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh Spark, you know could lay on the other si...&quot; Connor began to say before Spark shushed him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m perfectly comfortable right here...on your firm body.&quot; Spark said with a sigh. Connor smiled and kissed Spark goodnight on the head as they went to sleep.<br />
<br />
Neither of them didn&#39;t notice a tabby cat sneaking out of the house and going back to Nat&#39;s house without Nat being the wiser. Nat nor Rei could&#39;ve suspected that this cat was a mara.</p>
