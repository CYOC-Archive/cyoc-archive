<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kent, Abigail, and Sam could only listen as the fog finished enveloping the room. The ripping and pleasurable moans gave way to monstrous sounds as the fog settled at their ankles. The group was shocked at how quick and drastic the other changes were. The only way they could tell who was who was because of where they were standing. Where once stood Doctor Avery now stood a tall dark grey monster with no visible eyes. Its teeth were blue and its gums were purple. With the large fangs at the back and lack of lips, it looked like it was constantly snarling. Looking at Sally they saw that the suit was a pile of scrap around a masculine figure. It had a humanoid form with shades of grey and black but its abdomen was a foot longer than it should be. Its tail was similar to a snake. The black fur on its head covered its eyes and the entire back of its neck. Its head structure and ears were similar to that of a canine. The most interesting point was that its palms, inner forearms, fur tufts on its elbows, tongue, gums, and ears all glowed a teal color. Next was their boss Colt. His purple body was amphibious with the fins in its head, arms, and the end of its shark&#39;s tail. Those were light blue as well as his cock, claws, tongue, and gills. Finally, Cynthia was now this boar-like satyr. It had purplish-grey skin and red fur. This fur covered its lower half, forearms, neck, and lower snout. Its hair was now a red spiked mohawk. Interestingly the creature was the only one with piercings on its nipples and nose. Looking around the base it now looked like it had aged centuries in seconds. The creatures didn&#39;t seem to care as they began masturbating their cocks, well all except for Sally. It was looking down at its hand with a permanent toothy grin, its tongue too long to fit in its mouth. Despite its grin the tail of the creature was drooping. It tried to speak but was able to emit what sounded like a hiss mixed with a whine. X popped up from behind a fallen piece of the ceiling and went to its aid. This however caught the attention of the three monsters were stopped their orgy. The tall monster pulled his cock out of the boar monster&#39;s pussy which was hidden under its balls. Speaking of it, it stopped jacking off its horse cock and sucking the fish monster&#39;s cock as the three looked at them with hungry stares.   <br />
<br />
&quot;uh... the guy&#39;s you still in there?&quot; Sam asked. All he got, as a result, was an inhuman screech from the tall one as it used all four limbs to close the distance. It nearly got Sam but Sally used its new tail to wrap around the monster and fling him back into the others. &quot;RUN!&quot; Kent yelled. The five of them ran out of the ruined lab only to find the main exit blocked by debris. &quot;in there&quot; Abigail pointed to the bathrooms. The woman&#39;s was blacked but the man&#39;s was ajar. They rushed to it and locked the door when the three monsters banged against it. X braced against the door with Sally as Kent tried to come up with a plan. &quot;sir if everyone in this base let alone the city is like that then getting to the volcano is going to be impossible&quot; Sam said. Kent thought long and hard about this. Then he looked at Sally and an idea came to mind.  <br />
<br />
&quot;We have to get back to the lab,&quot; Kent said. &quot;what?!&quot; Sam and Abigail cried. X gave an exclamation and question mark in his visor as Sally screeched. &quot;with the main exit blocked and the possible threats around us the lab is our best bet. We can climb up the debris and get out through the hole. Also, we need to see if Sally&#39;s C.P.U. is still working. It possible that Doctor Avery&#39;s invention could restore minds and prevent deterioration&quot; Kent explained. Everyone looked at each other and agreed this was their only plan. &quot;one problem Kent, these monsters won&#39;t let us reach the lab&quot; Sam said. Sally then noticed the wall next to a ruined stall looked weak and about ready to give. They pointed it out and the others realized this was their option. It would only give them a few seconds when they entered the hallway but it would help. suddenly a purple-clawed hand broke through the door and began to widen the hole. &quot;the wall, hurry!&quot; Kent cried out. The three humans used whatever they could grab and repeatedly hit the wall. As the cracks grew bigger a hoof broke through the door right under Sally&#39;s new balls. They were thankful they were taller now. Then right as one of the hinges broke the wall crumbled. Kent motioned everyone to go through the hole. Not a moment after Sally and X ran to the opening did the three monsters break the door down.     <br />
<br />
They ran as fast as they could to the lab only for the grey monster to catch up to Sally. It pined her down as it shoved its long cock into their ass. Sally then felt the familiar sensation of her pussy being penetrated and realized it must have merged with her anus. Even as they were being &#39;bred&#39; they still helped out their team. They used their tail to trip the boar monster and grabbed the amphibian monster&#39;s tail. The two looked at them with annoyance before deciding to use Sally to satisfy their &#39;hunger&#39;. The grey mutant used its strength to lift Sally. The boar monster then positioned its pussy in front of their cock and pushed back. Finally, the amphibian monster forced Sally&#39;s mouth open and plunged his cock in. Sally couldn&#39;t help but feel aroused by all this &#39;affection&#39; they were getting. Their glowing teal parts glowed brighter the stronger the arousal got. Once each of them cummed did the teal glow dim back to normal. It spread to the three and covered their bodies before returning to Sally. The four were spent and laid there for quite some time.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Abigail had seen Sally get tackled but knew there was nothing that could be done. As she ran into the lab X put a rusted pipe through the door handles. &quot;where&#39;s Sally?&quot; Sam asked. Before she could answer however the door was dented. Through the glass window, they saw several monsters wanting to get in. Kent noted none of the ones from the lab were there as he ordered his men to the hole. X brought up the rear as Kent grabbed the edge and pulled himself up. He then extended his hand down for Abigail. Once she was up he helped Sam and X merely jumped up. However, when he landed it caused the roof to crack. X gave a nervous emoji on his visor before the hotel began to expand.  <br />
<br />
&quot;GO!&quot; Kent said. The four ran as fast as they could. Thankfully they saw the fire escape was still mostly intact. Once again X was the last one as they scaled down it. As they did several pieces fell off it as they descended. They ran once they got to the bottom as the top part broke off the side and hit the ones below it. Sam looked at the twisted metal as he breathed heavily. &quot;okay now whaaaa...&quot; he stopped his question as he saw the effects the chaos energy had on the city.  <br />
<br />
Unlike the base, the city looked different. It looked like fantasy had mixed with technology. Kent looked around and noted everything besides the base&#39;s main building was gone. A park seemed to replace it, except for a jagged circle of crumbling concrete with lightning-like patterns coming off it randomly. &quot;okay we need to find that drone, once it leads us to its home we will use that to find where X left the wilderness then it&#39;s a straight shot to the volcano.&quot; Kent explained. The three others nodded before X pointed to the base and gestured. &quot;our weapons were lost in the change, we won&#39;t be of any help to her right now&quot; Kent then walked to the new city. He knew none of them had a chance to look for Sally&#39;s C.P.U., no matter they had to hope theirs would provide enough info for the next base they go to. X gave a disappointed emoji as it followed them, it just hoped its new friend was okay.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Sally slowly opened their eyes to see them through their hair. They quickly realized it wasn&#39;t a dream/nightmare. The taste of sea salt and cum hung in their mouth as it dripped off their tongue. Looking ahead revealed they were laying on the boar monster with their cock still in its pussy. The amphibian monster was on its back passed out in front of them. Behind them, the grey monster was also passed out. Sally attempted to get away as quietly as they could but soon found a major problem. Their cock was completely canine including its knot, the same knot that kept the boar monster attached to them. Before Sally could figure this out the boar woke up and began squealing. This caused the others to arise from their slumber. Sally could see their hunger was not satiated and they were eager for another round. &#39;no, don&#39;t do that to me again&#39; Sally thought.  <br />
<br />
They then noticed something interesting happening to the monsters around them. The eyes on the amphibian and boar briefly glowed teal and they stopped their advance. Confused Sally thought &#39;What is going on?&#39; and was surprised to get a response. &quot;we are at your service sire&quot; the three said in unison. It was a little unsettling how they recognized the voices but didn&#39;t at the same time. The grey monster&#39;s voice sounded like Avery&#39;s but a little garbled and coming from his throat. The amphibian had Colt&#39;s voice but it sounded a little like it was underwater and lacked his commanding tones. The last one however sounded nothing like Cynthia. They sounded like deep-voiced nasally biker. The only way they even knew it was them was that they recognized the other two&#39;s voices. Testing the waters Sally decided for Cynthia to get off of them. The boar however didn&#39;t respond. Sally slapped their forehead remembering they didn&#39;t remember. They also felt calling the boar they were too confusing since they also went with this pronoun. &#39;you will either refer to yourself as he or she, now tell me which&#39; Sally thought. &quot;I&#39;m a guy obviously, about the only thing girly about me is my pussy&quot; the boar said. Sally was surprised at his full sentence.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps their intelligence wasn&#39;t completely lost after all. Wondering if the commands applied to them they tried ordering their knot to shrink. Thankfully no one but the other monsters saw it do nothing. They had no idea what caused these three to be obedient to them except it may have to do with their orgy. Regardless they were stuck in a boar monster&#39;s pussy until the knot went down. Hearing some noise down the ruined hall Sally wondered what that was. &quot;a fellow monster bumped into a light that barely hung from one side. Their coming this way&quot; the grey monster explained. Not in the mood for another orgy Sally ordered them to help them get out of sight. The grey monster helped Sally while the amphibian pushed the woman&#39;s door open. Once they were all inside Sally saw the reason the door had been stuck.  <br />
<br />
Unlike the men&#39;s the women&#39;s restroom&#39;s ceiling had collapsed. Unfortunately, there was no way up at the moment. &quot;they are passing out now&quot; the grey monster whispered. Curious how he knew this Sally saw him point to his two long ovals coming from where his eyes used to be. &quot;omnidirectional antenna, thus allowing me to &#39;see&#39; even more than you can&quot; he said. Sally could have sworn she heard a bit of Avery&#39;s cockiness come out when he spoke. Hopefully, they will continue to regain who they once were. &quot;what is our move sire&quot; the amphibian monster stated. Like with Avery&#39;s monster form Colt&#39;s monster form seemed to slowly regaining consciousness. Without knowing it he had given an order by asking for one. &#39;first we wait until this knot goes down, then we...&#39;</p>
