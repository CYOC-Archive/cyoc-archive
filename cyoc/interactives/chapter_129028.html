<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kellie looked at her girlfriend who was now smiling impishly. “Uh oh what are you thinking,” she smirked. Katie smiled as she now gazed at her girlfriend. “I don’t know,” she said. “Was thinking how much fun it would be to actually be a kid again for the summer, last night was a lot of fun that ended waaay to soon.”<br />
<br />
Kellie nodded as she rubbed her chin. “True,” she said. “But who would take care us and besides we all have lives outside. It would be fun but we would miss out on so much.”<br />
<br />
“Hmm maybe I can help,”<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie turned to see an elderly man standing by the window. While they should of been alarmed to see a stranger standing in their room, they were oddly calm, as if they had been expecting him. “Who are you?” They asked.<br />
<br />
“Merlin,” he said warmly. “I’ve been keeping an eye on you two since Katie found my ring.”<br />
<br />
Katie now looked down at the ring of Age on her finger. “This is yours,” she asked in shock. Merlin nodded before smiling. “Yes I made it,” he said. “And I must say I’ve been very pleased with how well you two have performed with the ring. So I’ve decided to assist you two in some fun.”<br />
<br />
“What kind of fun,” Kellie asked. Merlin smirked as he looked at the two girls. “Well as always Kellie you have a valid point when it comes to the magic of the ring. Yes you could relive your childhood for the summer, which Katie has successfully deduced everyone in this house wants to do. Kellie however realized that their are others that would be affected by this decision. Thats why I love seeing you two together you compliment each other so well.”<br />
<br />
“Um thanks,” Katie blushed as she held Kellies hand. “But how is it you can help?”<br />
<br />
“Well I’m glad you asked,” he stated. “You see I’m magical, which I’m guessing you already figured out. So what I’m suggesting is that I create a bubble universe for all of you to enjoy yourselves.”<br />
<br />
“Wait,” Kellie said slightly confused. “Are you saying that we could actually relive our childhood for a summer and no one would be the wiser?”<br />
<br />
Merlin nodded. “Exactly,” he said. “I would create a kidverse for the lot of you. All of you would be able to relive your childhoods for a summer and when it was completed you would return here without anytime passing. You would miss nothing and no one would know you were gone. Think of it as having your cake and eating it too.”<br />
<br />
“Wow that’s incredible,” Katie exclaimed. “So is their a catch? Are we going to forget we were adults?”<br />
<br />
Merlin shook his head. “No,” he said. “Everyone would remember their adult life. You would still be yourselves, you would still care for everyone the same. You would however regain your innocence.”<br />
<br />
“What does that mean,” Kellie asked concerned.<br />
<br />
“Well Kellie that is a good question,” Merlin said kindly. “Basically your memories would remain in tact however all sexual knowledge would vanish. No one would be obsessed with relationships or boyfriends or girlfriends or any of that. Remember how you two loved each other like sisters during the game last night, it would be exactly like that.”<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie turned to each other pondering this. “Well we would still be together,” Kellie said. “To be honest I think I could handle it. We both know we’re not ready for that part of the relationship.”<br />
<br />
“True,” Katie said. “But what about the others? We might be willing to do that but would Kumiko or Lisa or even Mika and Claudia? What would it mean for them?”<br />
<br />
“You would be surprised but they would actually enjoy it for a little while,” Merlin stated. “Mika and Claudia regretted their decision to part with their innocence. As for Lisa, Kumiko and Julia the grind of adulthood is wearing them down. To retain their innocence for a time and still be able to hold onto what their cherish in their adult lives is a good deal.”<br />
<br />
“What do you think Kel,” Katie asked. Kellie shrugged. “Well it isn’t a tempting offer. We would experience the summer as kids and not lose anytime here. It would be a double summer but the question I have is who would take care of a house full of kids?”<br />
<br />
Merlin gestured to himself smiling. “It would be my pleasure,” he said. “I’ve so enjoyed watching your adventures that it would be a treat to be part of it. Besides I always wanted to experience fatherhood.”<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie shrugged and smiled. “Why not we get a double summer vacation out of it,” Kellie smiled. “And we’re still going to be the best of friends and together.”<br />
<br />
Katie nodded as she now turned to Merlin. “Okay Merlin do your thing,” Merlin nodded as he waved his hand. Katie and Kellie felt the familiar tingle, signaling their regression. Turning the two girls kissed each other knowing that in a few moments such things would be foreign to them. As they watched themselves become 15 they felt their bare feet shift on the carpet as they got smaller. Before they could say anything though their friends burst into Katie’s room.<br />
<br />
“Katie did you make a wish,” Claudia exclaimed. The blond girl stopped dead in her tracks though as she stared at the elderly wizard. “Who isn’t that,” Samantha asked. Katie and Kellie now explained how Merlin was giving everyone’s in the house the opportunity to live the summer as kids and still be able to come back and enjoy a normal summer.<br />
<br />
“That’s incredible,” Mary Elise exclaimed. “A pocket universe existing outside of our normal time.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah plus double summer vacation,” Samantha smirked.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Claudia and Mika gasped in surprise and began blushing wildly. “Oh my god,” Katie exclaimed. “Are you two Okay?”<br />
<br />
Mika and Claudia now looked sheepishly at each other. They ran their hands over their bodies before looking at their friends in shock. “Umm Katie,” Mika whispered. “I...Uh...I think...I’m a virgin again!?!”<br />
<br />
“Me too!?!,” Claudia whispered.<br />
<br />
The group gaped at their friends before turning to Merlin. “I told you,” he stated. “I’m returning your innocence. That includes your virginity. Since they were both virgins at 15 I would think it would make sense.”<br />
<br />
Claudia’s and Mika now gaped at their friends in shock. “That’s...that’s incredible,” Claudia gaped. “And it’s crazy. I mean I can remember everything we’ve ever done but the sexual stuff is starting to disappear. I’m...I’m forgetting not only what that felt like but all the other sexual things in a relationship.”<br />
<br />
Katie now attempted to search her own memory to to see what she was losing. Every time she tried to remember something from a sex Ed class or some sexual act she had heard of it began to fade from her mind. Even the concept of lesbianism was beginning to  fade away. Turning the onwards now Kellie she’s realized she still loved the girl but the relationship was changing. Instead of lust and romance it was a pure and innocent relationship. The type of relationship one would have with a sister or best friend. Katie decided to test her theory by kissing Kellie. The two girl she kissed briefly but instead of romance or lust they felt a deep friendship or sisterly bond. “That  felt different,” Katie giggled as Kellie blushed. <br />
<br />
Claudia and Mika taking a cue from those two now did the same. The two girls now burst into giggles as they looked at each other. “That’s so weird,” Claudia giggled. “I still love you Mika but now there’s  no lust. You’re like my best friend in the whole world.”<br />
<br />
 The others stared dumbfounded as they all became 14. Turning they looked at Merlin in shock. They still remembered everything about themselves yet anything in regards to romance or relationships was becoming childish. Unsure about all of this Katie and Kellie  now held hands and smiled. Hopefully they had made the right choice.</p>
