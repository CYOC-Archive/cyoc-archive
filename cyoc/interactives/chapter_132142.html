<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Oh my gosh! Layla!” Judy Ann shouted as Layla’s brain began working again. She ceased drooling and looked blankly at the woman above her whom she recognized as her mom. The woman bent down and helped her to her feet but Layla stumbled and had to be caught, “Oh my angel, what happened?!”<br />
<br />
Layla opened her mouth to respond but couldn’t remember anything. She just looked at the woman for answers but got none. She was helped indoors and sat down on the couch while staring at nothing. Her mom suddenly sniffed the air and narrowed her eyes.<br />
<br />
“You weren’t smoking weed were you?!” She asked in a rather angry manner.<br />
<br />
“No mom,” Layla replied dizzily as the memory of eating weed filled her while the memory of smoking it faded.<br />
<br />
“Of course you wouldn’t take weed willingly,” Judy muttered and Layla felt the offhanded comment change things again. She’d been tricked into it.<br />
<br />
“They, they hid it in the brownies mom,” Layla muttered dizzily and her mother grew a shocked look.<br />
<br />
“Oh no, did they have sex with you?!” She asked while suddenly stripping the various articles of clothing off her daughter. Layla’s mind filled with the memory of feeling dizzy and dropping a drink at the party and being helped by a guy with bad breath. She recalled him lying her down and pleasure filling her while her mind swam in a billion different directions. Her brain was interrupted by her mom shouting, “They did! Oh you could be pregnant!”<br />
<br />
Immediately her mentrul cycle shifted and when that guy banged he the night before his sperm made contact with one of her eggs impregnating her. Layla was now pregnant but unaware she was.<br />
<br />
“Oh baby, what happened to you, why did this have to happen, you’ve always been such a good girl,” she cried out and Layla’s piercings began to vanish and her hair drooped down into a long and modest style and lost the pink colourstion. It turned brown and she was crying now too wondering why this happened to her. Her mother was upset and she felt sick so her mom helped her up the stairs to her room and put a glass of water by her end table. The room changed from a dark teenager’s room to a modest bedroom with modest things in it. Now she could recall a friend inviting her to the party and that drink being non alcoholic. She didn’t want to make her parents upset so she never drank. But that made parties less fun so parties began to leave her mind as memories were replaced by nights at home. Suddenly the universe needed an excuse to keep her away from the party crowd and her mind began to alter into that of a socially awkward introvert. Things on her desk became geeky and somewhat childish and her hobbies became things people would look down on and scoff at as for little kids. An old game system materialized on her bed along with plushies for the game “Suns of Orion.” She’d received the console and the first game for her eleventh birthday and could recall shying away from boys and girls her age and enjoying doing things alone. Her desk altered again to feature sketchbooks and art supplies as she had always enjoyed drawing the little monsters and that had led her to enjoy comic books, Japanese manga, and experiment with her own sketches. A drawing pad appeared next to her laptop and she tossed and turned as the clothing she stole turned into a tee shirt for her favourite game and the short shorts became simple jeans while the shoes became neat and free of scuff marks. Her mother’s contempt for her daughter’s lifestyle transformed into worry about her angel as she talked with a doctor on the phone.<br />
<br />
Layla groaned as her wardrobe changed and her memories altered to fill her new role in existence. She was so shy she would turn into a mumbling mess most of the time and this party had been an anomily filled with awkwardness. Her body became healthier as a proper diet filled her and obsessions with celebrities and weight flew over her head. Instead of reading tabloids and slipping out to smoke weed with friends she now huddled herself in a corner and drew while Japanese cartoons played in the background. She lost all sexual experience and her grades shifted around and textbooks changed. She lay under the covers panting as her mother walked back into the room and checked her temperature.<br />
<br />
“You’re burning up dear, must be a bug, but you were fine yesterday,” Judy lamented so the universe just shot time forward. Layla’s sweatiness built up more and more as her stomach began to shoot outwards and the illness turned into the result of morning sickness.<br />
<br />
“I feel like crap,” Layla admitted and her mother scowled.<br />
<br />
“Don’t talk like that,” she ordered and suddenly the act of swearing became awkward for Layla. Rudeness in general became something she was incapable of. She groaned and clutched her extended gut painfully. Her mom just sighed and said, “You wouldn’t be pregnant if you didn’t go to parties.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t party,” Layla groaned and her mother faded as she grew in both age and pregnancy. The party and the experience with weed faded into nothing and The room changed and she found herself in a different location. The door was swung open and instead of her mother a man entered the room and kissed her on the forehead.<br />
<br />
“Have a good day sweetie,” He told her beforehand rubbing her baby bump, “Don’t strain yourself.”<br />
<br />
“I won’t,” Layla sniffled as she remembered this man as her husband. An equally socially awkward man whom she was wedded to. They had been introduced at a party a few years back and were now awkward together. They’d gotten married and after a lot of anxiety had started Having sex, that sex had led to her pregnancy.<br />
<br />
Sick as she was Layla didn’t want to lie around all day so she rose to her feet and shuffled to the kitchen to cook some soup. Afterwards she huddled under a blanket and watched a few episodes of an anime while pulling out her drawing pad and continuing work on a graphic novel page she’d abandoned yesterday while steam drifted from a mug of tea and rain splattered against the window of their apartment. Lightning flashed and Layla finished sketching her main character who, for some unexplainable reason, and spiked up pink hair. She didn’t know why but something deep inside her felt like that was natural and it had gone over well with fans in previous books so this would be no different.<br />
<br />
The thought of questioning faded and Layla got back to work with a pleasant smile crossing her face. Her previous life forgotten.</p>
