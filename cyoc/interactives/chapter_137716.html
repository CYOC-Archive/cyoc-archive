<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Seemingly thousands of years after you were born as a mere whelp, you decided that you&#39;d rather study to be more like your mom than your dad. Of course your father wasn’t happy about this, and you overheard him and Mom breeding as of late and she’s looked pretty pregnant lately. Your Dad suffered a considerable blow to his pride with your decision it seemed, and breeding another son seemed like a solution to him. However you can’t help but feel a bit of schadenfreude towards your dad after he turned you into his cum, made you from it, and now another one is on its way. Your dad isn’t entirely against it, or at least that’s what he pretends to make you think, but he sometimes spouts out something questionable that suggests otherwise. Knowing this if you get a new sister then knowing your dad he&#39;ll do everything in his power to make the child a son of his, and if not that then turn you female. <br />
<br />
At first you kind of felt intimidated when you thought that your dad would make you female, but then again your mother could probably make you into a girl too by now. You’ve also started puberty a couple hundred years back, and thoughts like that seemed to trigger some less innocent thoughts that now roamed your mind. Perhaps you could bribe your mom into even doing that, but for the time being you prefer being your male self. <br />
<br />
____________<br />
<br />
You woke up at dawn and stretched your wings, neck, legs, and your tail. You were now about half the size of your parents, and you slept in a nest separate from theirs but beside them. A bunch of your mother’s scrolls sat to the side of your nest that you used to study what she knew. You practiced spells every day whether it was with your mom or by yourself, and sometimes Dad watched.... but very rarely.<br />
<br />
You sighed as you looked over at your parents&#39; nest, and you saw that it was only your mother sleeping there. You then looked to the mouth of the cave and saw your father taking what he called &quot;guard duty,&quot; however you figured that it was because of you as he only started doing this as of late. You really wanted to talk to him about your past now so it would help clear up a few things for him, but you didn’t know how he would react to it. Your worst fears were that he would just end up leaving you and Mom, or maybe even just straight up slaughtering you. For now though you felt the need to at least talk to him, and speak about the main issue in his mind right now.<br />
<br />
So you took a deep breath and made your way up to the mouth of the cave, and you sat down next to him and said,&quot;Uh....Dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
Your father sighed once he heard your voice and looked to you and said,&quot;Razor? What is it, and shouldn’t you be with your mother?&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused and felt your father&#39;s fearful presence as he said this, but you managed to swallow your fears. &quot;Dad,&quot; You began,&quot;I&#39;m a disappointment to you, aren’t I?&quot;<br />
<br />
Your father paused and looked down at you with a look of uncertainty on his face. He then sighed and said,&quot;Razor, why do you test me like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, just say it!&quot; You snarled then suddenly your dad’s eyes widened at your sudden outburst. &quot;Look, you barely come out to see me practice, you always make the occasional comment about how I should be a better fighter, and finally you’re out here alone! Are you really guarding us, or are you just getting some alone time away from me and Mom?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Your Dad stared into your eyes now, and he blinked twice then laid down on his stomach and looked at you from an eye-level stance and said,&quot;Razor, Son, since you were a wee little hatchling, before you even had teeth you were such a wild little fighter. I thought you looked up to me, and you wanted to be like me. It’s just... you didn’t exactly turn out how I wanted you to, and when I asked you to reconsider you made it clear that you were strongly passionate about your magic. I... don’t know if I should tear you away, or if I should just let you embrace it. I’m the protector of our family Razor, and if I can’t pass on at least that legacy then who’ll take care of us when we’re ill, or injured? I just.... thought that would be you, but obviously you aren’t. So again, I support your decision, however I&#39;d really prefer the you when you were younger.&quot;<br />
<br />
You listened to your father&#39;s message and reasoning, and your sudden rage now felt like it was just another byproduct of puberty. Still, there felt like there were holes that you needed to fill, and you were compelled to keep asking. &quot;Dad, I do look up to you, I want to be as great as you. It’s just, maybe I can be great at something other than fighting, you know? If I need to stand out here like you are now then I will, but can’t you be proud of me at something I can do better than you?&quot; You asked, nudging your Dad and giving him a serious look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Son, who told you that I wasn’t proud? It’s just that I care for your mother and I want someone to protect her when I can’t. We may be immortal creatures, but we can certainly be injured and killed if we’re not smart. However.... tell me, when was the point where you couldn’t take it anymore? The moment you... didn’t want to be a warrior.&quot; Your father asked and you paused.<br />
<br />
You thought for a bit, and you didn’t quite know how to describe your situation to him. You turned back to your mother and saw that she was still asleep thankfully. &quot;Father, before I say anything promise me you won’t tell Mom, for... all of our sakes.&quot; You whimpered.<br />
<br />
Your father raised a brow and said,&quot;What did you do now boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
You took a deep breath and sighed closing your eyes and clenching your claws shut tightly before saying anything. &quot;I-I....i-it’s....&quot; You stammered then you took a deep breath and said,&quot;It&#39;s not something I did Dad, it involved.... humans....&quot; You weren’t sure how your Dad would react now, as you weren’t even told about humans even existing as of late.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hu..... wait, how in the hell do you know about humans?&quot; Your Dad asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I was one, okay?!&quot; You roared and your Dad’s eyes widened and he stared at you in disbelief and said,&quot;Razor, don’t you dare be playing pretend with me again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, I&#39;m too damn old for that, and also I’m not lying. Before you and Mom made me, I, or at least part of myself, stumbled onto your den. You then punished me thinking I was stealing something, and you turned me into your... cum, all of it. After that I kept all of the memories of my past, and I have them all now still. I just.... couldn’t tell either of you, I didn’t know how you would react.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your Dad stared at you wide-eyed, he looked like he couldn’t believe your words, but you shouldn’t even know of such events occurring. You could tell that he was stricken by your words, and he reacted by....</p>
