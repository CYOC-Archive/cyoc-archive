<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Just wanna say I&#39;ve really been enjoying writing this, and thanks to BeefyBullyGuy for setting me up with a good premise. Cheers, ya&#39;ll</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was late in the morning the next day when Aiden awoke curled against Marks massive chest, a strong arm curled protectively around his slim waist. Mark had not been joking about his endurance; he’d fucked Aiden three times the previous night, with Aiden lovingly sucking and worshiping his cock in between sessions. His pussy and his ass both felt sore, but pleasantly so, like the sting following a powerful and productive work out session. Aiden wrapped his arm tightly around his man’s stomach, his hand running through the curly hairs on his chest and stomach. He grinned as his hand drifted down lower to caress Mark’s morning wood, running his hand up and down the throbbing shaft and teasing his head. Mark didn’t seem to wake, but Aiden felt the muscles in the arm encircling him tighten, holding him closer. Aiden continued to stroke and caress him until his mighty 18 inch cock was at full mast, laying against Mark’s hard, hairy stomach. Checking to make sure Mark was still snoozing, Aiden grinned to himself and slid lower on the bed, pushing away the covers. He drank in the sight of Mark lying on his back, his hard cock laying on his stomach, a big hand resting on his powerful chest while his handsome, virile face was soft and relaxed with sleep; If Aiden had gone blind at that very moment, he’d be okay with it.<br />
<br />
He crept carefully between his man’s legs, running his hands over Mark’s strong thighs before reaching for his heavy cock. He took Mark’s bulbous head into his mouth, moaning with relief as he did so; he really had to remember to thank Mark for making the interior of his throat so sensitive and pleasurable. He sank himself deeper upon the giant cock, his moans coming out in sighs through his nose as his jaw stretched around its throbbing girth. He heard Mark take a deep breath above him, but he made no other move to suggest he was awake. Aiden continued his assault, letting go of Mark’s shaft as his face steadily approached the thick thatch of pubes at its base. He felt two hands come to a gentle rest around his head, and Aiden hummed and smiled to himself when he realized Mark had come to a groggy wakefulness. He groaned deeply, stretching his arms behind his head and sighing with pleasure as his boy continued his ministrations. <br />
<br />
“G’morning, baby,” he murmured, his eyes still closed and a growing grin spreading on his scruff face. <br />
<br />
Aiden responded pushing himself further until the man’s entire shaft was embedded within him; Mark let out a deep, appreciative sigh as Aiden flexed his throat muscles against his cock. He ran his hands under Mark’s firm ass, squeezing his furry cheeks before lifting his strong thighs and folding his legs around Aiden’s head. Mark raised his pelvis slightly as Aiden increased his speed, pulling back further and slamming himself back down harder on his cock before removing it from his mouth slowly. As Mark’s cock flopped out and back onto his stomach, Aiden went between Mark’s legs and took one of his heavy, burgeoning testicles into his mouth, lightly squeezing the ball with his cheeks and swirling his tongue over the soft, warm surface. Mark gasped and jerked his leg as Aiden swallowed him, the pleasure and pressure on his nuts from Aiden’s mouth making him want to yelp and come right there. He felt himself leave Aiden’s mouth, the boy kissing and nibbling at the inside of his thigh before diving back down to repeat the process to his other testicle. Mark’s eyes were wide, his breath ragged, as his hand reached down to his now painfully hard cock and gripped it, running the tip along Aiden’s head and face to alert him of his need.<br />
<br />
Aiden just laughed and without a word took Mark’s beautiful schlong back into his mouth. He felt Mark pulling at his body; Aiden relaxed as Mark grabbed his body and spun him around on his cock, so that Aiden was now facing down the bed, with his ass and pussy towards Mark. He continued sucking, humming around Mark’s cock when he felt the man’s strong hands knead and squeeze his full ass. Mark began to finger Aiden’s pussy and ass as he went down on him, slowly increasing the number of fingers and the intensity of his probing. Aiden stumbled and lost his footing slightly when he felt Mark’s hot breath on his pussy, his tongue entering him and expertly stroking and stimulating Aiden’s insides with his rough tongue. They went on like this for another few minutes before Mark brought Aiden over the edge with his tongue, his hands gripping Aiden tight against him as he felt the smaller man groan and tense on top of him and around his cock. Aiden was sucking with gusto as the waves of his orgasm passed through him, supplemented by Mark’s now almost overwhelming stimulation as he continued to lick and finger his holes. Soon, aid heard Mark’s breathing turn ragged and deep, the man lifting his pelvis and his balls heaving before his came, his cock pumping load after load down Aiden’s throat in thick gobs. Aiden milked all that was left from the big thing before pulling himself up and climbing back up the bed, resting his head on Mark’s chest and smiling as the big man once again encircled him in his arms. <br />
<br />
“Thank you, baby. You really know how to wake a man up,” he said, pecking him on the forehead. <br />
<br />
“Well, you know just what I want to wake up to,” Aiden replied, his hand drifting down to caress Mark’s still semi-hard schlong. “Does this thing ever go down?” Aiden asked with a laugh.<br />
<br />
Mark chuckled, “Yes, but do you want it to?” he peered down into Aiden’s blue eyes.<br />
<br />
Aiden pretended to think about it before saying, “Not really, no.” He sat up in the bed stretched, looking down at his man, “But I do want coffee.” He said, leaning back down to give Mark a peck on the cheek before climbing out of the bed. He giggled as mark pretended to roughly snatch him back into the bed, before leaning back against his arms and chortling to himself.<br />
<br />
“Make me a cup too, pussyboy!” he shouted with a smile as Aiden padded to the kitchen, naked. <br />
<br />
He went into the kitchen and set the kettle, groaning when he saw that he had to grind coffee. He pulled out the press and a few mugs, and grabbed the fat sack of bargain-brand coffee beans they went half-sies on. In the bedroom, Mark leaned forward and took a big stretch, letting out a deep, manly groan as he did so. The events of the previous night slowly came back to him, and he grinned to himself as he remembered the details. He wondered if that new boy Cody was up right now, sucking the morning wood off of his coworkers. Serves him right for trying to take my boy, Mark thought to himself as he swung his big legs and his semi-hard cock over the bed. He was really enjoying the world that he had made for himself and Aiden, and after the fun times and devastatingly good sex that he had subjected Aiden to, he was hoping that today would be the day he would convince Aiden to make all of this permanent. Wondering where his boy, and his coffee, had gotten too, Mark stepped out of bed and lumbered quietly to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
He found Aiden standing with his weight on one leg, his plump ass bare and inviting as poured coffee beans into the grinder. Feeling devious, Mark waited until he ran the machine, quickly walking up behind Aiden and with one hand feeding the tip of his still hard cock into Aiden’s ass. Aiden groaned and almost knocked over the coffee grinder as he felt Mark’s tiff wood slide gracefully into him, bowing his head and bracing his hands on the counter as Mark pushed deeper. He felt the man’s big hands reach around his chest, teasing his nipples and Pulling Aiden closer against his hairy chest. <br />
<br />
“You scared me!” Aiden giggled as mark leaned down to bite and kiss his neck in his favorite place. <br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, babe,” he growled, “I couldn’t help myself; your ass just looked so warm and perfect.” He said, increasing his thrusts. <br />
<br />
He bent Aiden over the counter and continued to roughly fuck the boy as they waited for the kettle to boil. Aiden sighed and groaned as Mark shoved his big cock into his ass, smiling; he’d spent the last 24 hours getting fucked in his new pussy he’d almost forgot how good it felt to have a cock in his ass too. Mark wrapped a tight, almost constricting arm around Aiden’s neck, pulling his boy against his chest as cock swelled and he came, filling Aiden’s ass deep with cum. Right on time the kettle whistled; Mark pulled himself out of Aiden and took the liberty of pouring the coffee, while Aiden caught his breath and sat down at the table.<br />
<br />
“God damn, Mark.” He breathed. “That cock is like, mind-shattering.” He complimented as mark handed him a cup. <br />
<br />
“Me?” said Mark with a cocky grin. “Have you been inside yourself. This is home.” He said, giving Aiden a kiss and reaching down to fondle his moist pussy. “So, what do you think?” he said, after a minute of them sipping their coffee. <br />
<br />
Aiden gestured at himself and Mark. “About all this? I love it!” he said with glee<br />
<br />
“Really?” Mark said, a slow grin spreading on his face.<br />
<br />
“Yes! At first, I was freaked out; I lost my dick and then you came home and…” he trailed off, snickering and blushing. “And then you turned around and somehow made it…fun, and sexy.” He confessed. “Oh my god, watching you fuck that guys dick away last night,” he shook his head and pretended to fan himself with his hand. <br />
<br />
Mark chuckled. “Yeah, I got a little carried away. I’m loving the changes too.” He said, leaning back in his chair and rubbing his expansive belly with his big hands. “I’ve never felt better in my life.”<br />
<br />
“And to think, two days ago we were just roommates!” Aiden said, shaking his head.<br />
<br />
Mark sat up straight and reached out for his cup. “And now what are we?” he asked, peering up at Aiden from beneath his heavy brow. Aiden cocked his head and evaluated the surprisingly uncertain, boyish expression on the man’s hard face. <br />
<br />
“More than roommates, I guess…” he trailed off, he wanted to say something else, but he wasn’t sure how to broach it. <br />
<br />
“Boyfriends?” he asked hopefully, his fingers fiddling with the handle of his mug.<br />
<br />
Aiden blushed and took a breath as his heart started racing. “Yes,” he said, reaching across the table and putting a hand on his nervous fiddling. Mark’s fingers relaxed under Aiden’s palm, the big paw flipping around to grip it back. “I’d love to be your boyfriend.” He said with a smile. He got up from the table and went over to mark, climbing into his warm lap and wedging his big cock between the cheeks of Alex’s firm, round ass. “Will you be my man?” he asked, wrapping his hands around Mark’s neck.<br />
<br />
The man grinned down at Aiden, his bright eyes alive with happiness. “Yours and yours only, baby.” He promised, leaning down to kiss him passionately. Mark wanted throw him on the table and take him again right there, but he held himself back. Instead, he assaulted Aiden’s mouth with his tongue and fingered his aching pussy, savoring the feeling of him writhing and moaning in his lap.<br />
<br />
“What about the rest of the world?” he breathed against Aiden’s ear, his thumb lightly rubbing Aiden’s swollen nipple. <br />
<br />
“Mmm…” Aiden nuzzled his face against Mark’s hairy chest, savoring the smell of his musk while he thought about it. He was loving his pussy, and he wasn’t getting his dick back; Mark had taken him from fear and shame to the heights of pleasure and ecstasy in less than twenty-four hours. Aiden couldn’t see himself being with him any other way. But he also thought about his parents…God, his mother, his sister, his friends from university and Mark’s friends too. Hell, all the people in the world. Aiden felt intimidated by the fact that this innocuous computer program had the power to make such drastic changes. But then again, with how weird and shitty the world had been lately, perhaps life could use a tune up.<br />
<br />
“What do you think?” he finally said, looking up at him.<br />
<br />
“Well, obviously its pretty hot. I don’t want to be straight again; I love how the town turned out, all the people changed into beefy men like me, or sexy little pussyboys like you,” he chortled, his cock throbbing against Aiden’s ass. “And the weird thing is that I didn’t give the Chronivac very specific instructions.”<br />
<br />
“Really?”<br />
<br />
“No; I made some changes on you and myself, and then it gave me the option to toggle awareness and reality alteration, and the computer did the rest.” He said, admiring the results. <br />
<br />
“Huh,” Aiden came to a decision. “If its that good at tying up loose ends, then why not.”<br />
<br />
“You sure?” Mark asked one last time.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, fuck it. This whole year was a wash anyway, what with this stupid virus.” He gave Mark a deep kiss before continuing. “Let’s do it.”<br />
<br />
Mark gave him a firm kiss in return. “Excellent.”<br />
<br />
Excited, they both left the kitchen and made for the computer. Mark stuffed his big body into Aiden’s little office chair and opened up his laptop. The Chronivac program was still up on the window. He started going through the stats, both of them pointing out any other options that looked important or fun. When they had agreed on the parameters, Mark scrolled down and made to click the ‘commit changes’ button when Aiden stopped him.<br />
<br />
“Wait, turn that one off, and that one too,” he said, pointing on the screen.<br />
<br />
Mark turned to look him in the eye. “Are you sure? We’re making this permanent.” Mark had strong feelings for Aiden; he had been seductive and alluring to Aiden in the beginning to get him to accept the changes, but ultimately, he didn’t want Aiden to do anything for him that he didn’t want to do to himself. <br />
<br />
But Aiden allayed his fears, placing his hand on Mark’s chest and another on the side of his scruffy face. “Absolutely.” He kissed him, but then pulled away. “You made sure we have like, a shitload of money now, right?”<br />
<br />
“Not a shitload, but we’ll be fine, yeah.” He confirmed. <br />
<br />
“You’re a stud,” Aiden giggled. “You ready?” <br />
<br />
“No.” he said, gesturing to the throbbing erection in his lap. Aiden rolled his eyes but casually climbed back onto Mark, facing him as he lowered himself delicately onto his stiff rod all the way down to the base. Aiden groaned with satisfaction as he felt Mark’s cock settle into its home deep inside of him. “Now, I’m ready.” He growled, pulling his boys head in for another passionate kiss while his big finger tapped the mouse button and committed their new changes to the system. The screen flashed a warning sign as a countdown began, but Mark and Aiden weren’t paying attention; they were too busy making out as Aiden bounced and gyrated his slick pussy on Mark’s expanding cock. <br />
<br />
“You know I love you, right?” he heard Mark say in a coarse whisper. <br />
<br />
Aiden reared back from him in shock, before a stupid grin spread over his face and his heart began leaping in his chest. “I love you, too.” He returned, leaning back in kiss Mark’s full, rough lips. The two men, or as they were about to forever be in about ten seconds, the Man and his pussyboy, continued to make love as the timer counted down to their new lives. There was the sound of a bell, a flash of light, and a humming sound that all gradually faded as Aiden reached a climax on top of his powerful man. Mark grunted as his balls emptied themselves down his prodigious length and into Aiden’s aching pussy and waiting womb. They collapsed against each other, finally spent for once, catching their breath and tenderly kissing each other as Mark softened within him.</p>
