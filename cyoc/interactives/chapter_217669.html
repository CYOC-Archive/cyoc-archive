<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Rachel was just an unborn fetus in the womb, both her future mother and father were in their bedroom with the mother observing her nine month pregnant belly in the mirror.<br />
<br />
Rachel&#39;s mom, whos name is Sarah, is now thirty years of age with C cup breasts, long blonde hair, angelic face, and baby blue eyes looked to herself and sighed with worry.  Checking her huge belly and poked belly button, she was scared about the day she would give birth to her baby daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down, Sarah.  It&#39;s going to be all right.  Once the delivery is over, you won&#39;t have to worry about anything.&quot; said Rachel&#39;s father, Ryan who was just in his under ware.  He too was in his thirties with a muscular body that has manly pecs, eight pack abs, a chiseled face, short brown hair, and hazel eyes.<br />
<br />
Sarah kept starring at it and said to him, &quot;That&#39;s the point.  I know this is my first time making a delivery, but what happens if it all goes wrong?  What if my baby girl dies?  What if I die?  Will she turn out all right?  These are the things that would keep me up at night.  I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m ready for this.&quot;<br />
<br />
He sighed and got off the bed, approaching his wife and placing his hands on her shoulders.  Turning to her, he assured her that nothing could go wrong.  &quot;Nothing bad is going to happen.  I&#39;m sure of it.  Once this is all over, you will have a baby girl and we will become a family.  Don&#39;t worry...  I&#39;m sure you are going to make a great mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah heard his words and gave a warm smile, saying back, &quot;Thanks, Ryan.  I knew I could count on you.  And I&#39;m sure you will make a great father as well.&quot;  She soon gave her husband a hug, trying not to squeeze her belly.  Looking up with her lovely eyes, she told him, &quot;You know...  I was thinking...  When our daughter is born, we could call her Rachel, after my great great grandmother&#39;s name.  Sounds nice, don&#39;t you think.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan gave a chuckle and told her, &quot;Nice?  Heh...  Sweetie, it&#39;s perfect.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, the two started to kiss lightly, knowing that they will be great parents for their soon to be born daughter.  What they didn&#39;t know is that the golden pocket watch that Rachel had was still active as the hour and minute hands continue to wind back, where days turn into seconds and months to minutes.<br />
<br />
As they continue to kiss, Sarah&#39;s stomach was slowly shrinking as the unborn fetus was going backwards through pregnancy.  As the belly went back to eight months, both Sarah&#39;s and Ryan&#39;s kiss was getting deeper and a bit more risker.  Seven months along, they slowly backed away to the bed as they were groping each other.  Ryan placed his hand on her boob and gave it a good squeeze while Sarah went to crotch and rubbed it to start giving it an erection.  The belly was already six months along as fell to the bed on their sides, still planting their lips together and were getting more intimate.  Even Ryan shaft was sticking out and was starting to throb.<br />
<br />
As all of this was going on, Rachel was still in the womb.  The unborn fetus was in a deep slumber and wasn&#39;t aware of the pocket watch still regressing her.  Her body was already getting smaller and she was starting to loose bits of herself as she going back in months.  Already entering her sixth month, Rachel is about 12 inches long and can weigh close to 2 lbs.  Her skin is still translucent yet reddish and wrinkled, her fingerprints and toe prints become were undeveloping, and her eyelids were non existent.  <br />
<br />
Five months along, Rachel shrank to about 10 inches long and can weigh anywhere from .5 lbs – 1 lb.  Her arms and legs were smaller then her body and her head was bigger.  Veins were starting to show and a thick substance, called vernix caseous, deteriorate from the skin exposing her to amniotic fluid.<br />
<br />
Now back to four months, Rachel was starting to loose herself.  Shrinking down to 6 inches long and weighs 4 ounces, her hair, eyelids, eyelashes, nails and her nervous system were undeveloping.  Her heartbeat was slowly down, pumping less and less body through her body and brain.  Even her reproductive system was going back as her tiny vagina was slowly sealing itself up.<br />
<br />
In three months, Rachel was nothing more then a genderless fetus that is four inches long and weighing an ounce.  It look like something out of an alien movie with her tiny limbs that have undeveloping hands and feet and a huge head with two dots for eyes and undeveloping features.  Its organs were being shown as they begin to deteriorate and the heart stop beating with the brain not active.  Yet the former Rachel didn&#39;t realize it as it was reaching her limit.<br />
<br />
Out of the womb, both Sarah and Ryan were on the bed with the wife on the mattress and the husband on top of her.  During the time they were kissing and groping, Sarah&#39;s stomach kept on shrinking and she was now three months along with her stomach only showing a small bump.  The two were still roughing each other up as Ryan nibbled on his wife&#39;s neck to pleasure her.  But as the pregnancy was going back, the two were starting to get ready for the next level.  Already Ryan&#39;s under ware was off and his huge dick was fully erect and ready for some action.  Sarah looked on and was worried about something.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know if this is a good idea Ryan.  I mean, I&#39;m already three months in and I don&#39;t want to harm our unborn kid.&quot; she said looking to his dick.<br />
<br />
Ryan groaned and told her, &quot;Oh come on, Sarah, don&#39;t be a worry wart.  It&#39;s been a while since we had sex and I am in desperate need of some action.  Besides, aren&#39;t you two months in your pregnancy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Indeed it is true, Sarah&#39;s pregnancy is already two months in and her stomach was getting flatter.  That led to her confidence slowly building up and she said to him, &quot;Okay...  Go ahead and do it, just try to take it slow, it&#39;s my kid we&#39;re talking here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan gave a smirk and said, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, you won&#39;t feel a thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Slowly, he guided his erected penis into her vagina and was slowly moving up and down like a pogo stick.  Sarah groaned in pain as she was clinging to the bed posts.  While the movements were slow at first, it didn&#39;t matter as she and her stomach went down to one month, making the movements faster and harder.  By now, Sarah&#39;s pregnancy was now down to weeks as the unborn fetus inside was getting more and more simplified.<br />
<br />
In Sarah&#39;s womb, Rachel grew so small and simple that it has become an embryo as it deconstructed and became a ball of cells.  As the days and weeks ticked back, the cells started to dived as thousands became hundreds, then hundreds became tens.  Once the two cells devided, it became a fertilize egg as Rachel was reaching it&#39;s limit.<br />
<br />
Out of the womb, both Sarah and Ryan was making out harder and the husband kept bouncing on his wife very aggressively.  Sarah was feeling it as she was moaning louder and louder.<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh...  Oh...  This is it!  I can feel it!  Doing it Ryan!  Cum into me!  Cum me now!&quot; she said to him<br />
<br />
Ryan grunted harder and harder and said back to her, &quot;Yes dear!  Right away!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two were pounding each other and they are about to reach the climax.<br />
<br />
At the same time, the fertilize egg was started to feel weird as a tail started to stick out.  Almost instantly, a sperm was separated from the egg and they floated backwards.  For the sperm, it swam backwards as hundreds of them suddenly appear and joined it as they went back through the tunnel and entered another tunnel.  As for the egg, it went back into the tube and went back to the ovaries&#39;, nestling itself into the many eggs around it.<br />
<br />
As that happened, both husband and wife screamed out loud as they believe they reached their climax.  What really happened was that Rachel&#39;s sperm went back into Ryan&#39;s dick and went back into the testicles.  Once they reach the point, they collapsed on the bed and gave a big rest after all that action.  What the two didn&#39;t realize was that they have unmade Rachel and she no longer existed.  At the same time, Sarah was back into her fit body before she was pregnant with her flat and curvy stomach and her bubble shape rear.  Even her breasts shrunk a little as they didn&#39;t produce milk.<br />
<br />
In short, the golden pocket watch regressed Rachel to the point before she even existed and now a couple was left without a kid.  What would happen to them now?</p>
