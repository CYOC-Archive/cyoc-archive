<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One would assume that Calliope and Calypso would have trouble fitting into Animalia due to being the only conjoined twins in Animalia, but &#39;normal&#39; has very low standards in a community where animals can become humanoid, humans can become half-animal, and age could be reset for both young and old. This makes Calliope and Calypso more of a novelty rather than a pariah, placed in an apartment building that is home to other reptilians. Though odd as most are solitary by nature, it might have been the accommodations made for the slightly cold-blooded tenants that may have the opposite effect on them. The two-headed anaconda&#39;s day started out as normally as it did for most serpent Animalians: A nice hot shower to warm up the blood, followed by a healthy breakfast which mainly consisted of sausages, and some planning for the day ahead.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what&#39;s on the agenda?&quot; asked Calliope. &quot;Well, we&#39;re gonna be talking with Clara about our exhibit,&quot; Calypso answers. &quot;Plus doing some bodybuilding training for the games.&quot; &quot;Good, maybe we can bulk up some more,&quot; Calliope comments with a smirk. &quot;If we get any bigger, we won&#39;t be able to fit in this apartment,&quot; Calypso retorts. The only issue the twins have with their flat  is that it is too small for an uplifted anaconda of their size, preferring a house custom-build for them. Thankfully, the Nutra Pharma Corporation is willing to provide with the twins willing to wait until the construction of their future home is finished. &quot;Good point,&quot; said Calliope, &quot;So, training first or exhibit?&quot; &quot;Exhibit first. The mayor doesn&#39;t have as much free time as us,&quot; said Calypso.<br />
<br />
Soon after that, the twins leave their apartment and head to city hall, only to learn that Mayor Clara is on maternity leave as her litter is coming in sooner then expected. But Robby fills it and meets the twins in Clara&#39;s office. &quot;So what all are you planning to display with your exhibit?&quot; asked Robby, who was also looking at some papers. &quot;Mainly how the Animalia Virus is capable of fixing...birth defects,&quot; said Calypso. &quot;Or in our case, improving them,&quot; said Calliope, flexing her arm. &quot;So, your exhibit will showcase the improvements the virus makes to Siamese twins,&quot; said Robby. &quot;No, to conjoined twins,&quot; said Calypso. &quot;What do those cat sisters from the beauty parlor have to do with this?&quot; asked Calliope. Robby sighed and said, &quot;Sorry, &#39;Siamese twins&#39; is an old term for conjoined twins. Apparently, the most famous set of twins were a pair from Thailand that traveled in P.T. Barnum&#39;s circus and the term &#39;Siamese twins&#39; became synonymous with twins such as yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, so it has nothing to do with Ping and Ming,&quot; said Calliope. &quot;No,&quot; said Robby before pausing, &quot;Though I think they might have a nephew or niece who was born with that condition. I haven&#39;t heard much from them about it. But at least they&#39;re healthy enough that they&#39;re not desperately trying them here from treatment.&quot; &quot;Anyways, our exhibit will show how much benefit the virus can do for someone who was born with a less optimal body,&quot; said Calypso. &quot;It did a lot of wonders for us,&quot; said Calliope. &quot;You have our communityy&#39;s support,&quot; said Robby, &quot;But is there something else that worries you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We might be able to feel better with ourselves...&quot; started Calypso. &quot;If we had a mate,&quot; finished Calliope &quot;I take it finding one among the anacondas here is not so easy,&quot; said Robby. &quot;I think we scare them by being so large,&quot; said Calliope. &quot;Well, perhaps there&#39;s a human who could be a match for you two,&quot; said Robby, &quot;We could put you two into the dating service, if you have an idea of who you&#39;d like to date.&quot; Calliope and Calypso paused at that, neither having though that far ahead. &quot;Well, think it over,&quot; said Robby, &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have time enough for that. The important thing is never to be ashamed of yourself, yourselves. Sorry, pronouns can be...tricky around you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We understand,&quot; the twins respond in unison. &quot;Well, if that&#39;s everything you need to discuss...&quot; said Robby, turning back to his papers.<br />
Calliope was ready to leave, but then she saw the word &#39;Brazil&#39; on the papers. &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; she asked. &quot;Well, if you must know, there&#39;s discussion about buying this hotel that has been abandoned in the Amazon,&quot; said Robby. &quot;The Amazon, as in where we&#39;re from?&quot; asked Calypso. &quot;Yes, but this hotel will need some inspection before we can consider the expansion,&quot; said Robby, &quot;Clara would go down to see it, but she&#39;s in too delicate a state right now.&quot; &quot;Can we go too?&quot; the twins asked together. Robby thought it over. Ran went with them when they went to inspect Mieni Atoll and he had done VERY well for that trip. &quot;I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a reason why you shouldn&#39;t go,&quot; said Robby, &quot;Just don&#39;t expect to find your mate there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Next was the anaconda twins&#39; workout session in prep for the Animalian games. Today, they were focusing on the bodybuilding portion. and their trainer for this will be Marlysa Williams who helps them practice proper posing. &quot;Now curl your arms like this,&quot; Marlysa says while tightening her flexed right arm so her left arm can grasped her right bicep. Doing so also pushed up her breasts, which were thinly covered by the &#39;posing pasties&#39; she was wearing. The nipple-covering fabrics were hardly modest, but it was the closest that female bodybuilders could be to being bare-chested.<br />
<br />
Calypso flexed her arm while Calliope crossed her arm under their chest to grasp her twin&#39;s bicep, the whole exercise being one of coordination. In a way, they were thankful of not having legs. &quot;Ugh, I&#39;m going to be sore all day,&quot; groaned Calypso. &quot;No pain, no gain, sis,&quot; Calliope responds while flexing her arm. After their work out session, the twins relax at the sauna alongside Marlysa as her husband Anton joins them.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how are the hatchlings?&quot; Calypso asks Anton and Marlysa, who often talk about their children and show off pictures of them. &quot;They&#39;re growing fine,&quot; said Anton, &quot;They&#39;re not going to grow faster than normal, which is a relief to me.&quot;&quot;It won&#39;t be long before they&#39;re on solid food,&quot; said Marlysa, &quot;And yet, I think I might miss breastfeeding them.&quot; She rubbed her breasts and said, &quot;When I first changed, I didn&#39;t really see the point of me first growing these things. But I did love how Anton paid attention to them. But when I&#39;m feeding my children directly, it feels more natural than anything. Do all mothers feel this way?&quot; &quot;You&#39;re asking the wrong guy about it,&quot; said Anton.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder if we&#39;ll feel that way someday?&quot; Calypso says in bit forlornly tone. &quot;Still not having luck with finding a mate?&quot; asked Anton. &quot;Not among the anacondas,&quot; said Calliope, &quot;But Robby suggested maybe we could find a human who would be open to us. But we don&#39;t really know what to look for.&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t claim to understand anything beyond relationships,&quot; said Marlysa, &quot;But I think that the only thing that matters is that they love you and are willing to be in an open relationship with you both.&quot; &quot;So, are you two in an open relationship?&quot; asked Calliope suggestively. &quot;No,&quot; both Anton and Marlysa answer flatly. &quot;Calliope!&quot; said Calypso disapprovingly. &quot;I was joking,&quot; said Calliope, &quot;Unless you-&quot; &quot;No,&quot; repeated the iguanas with Calypso chiming in. &quot;Ok, fine,&quot; said Calliope.<br />
<br />
Calliope and Calypso have lots on their minds by the time they returned to their apartment, from the prospect of returning to Brazil to see the new hotel to idea of acquiring a human for a mate. Coiling up in their bathroom, which was small relatively easy to clean, they undress to vent out sexually as Calypso fondles their left breast. Sine both share sensations from the necks down, Calliope gave a moan of satisfaction before reaching down with her hand to rub around their cloaca with both moaning with growing arousal. Sensing their climax, Calypso moves her hand from Calliope&#39;s breast to their cloaca and plunge her fingers. The twins let out a loud moan at that, with Calliope following suit as they plunged they hands into their pussy before it clenched and gushed as they let out a loud hiss of excitement. Calliope and Calypso panted a bit as they started to calm down, cleaning their mess up once their hearts slowed down. Whatever the downsides in society, being conjoined has it perks as the twins have each other even if they cannot find a mate.</p>
