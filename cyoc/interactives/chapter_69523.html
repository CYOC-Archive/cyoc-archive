<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As he walked down the stairs into the bar on a drizzly Monday evening in May, David Carmichael reflected on <br />
how his life was going. David was not a happy young man for a number of reasons. For starters, at 25 years old <br />
he was still a virgin. There’d been a fair number of girls who came close, but for various reasons he’d still <br />
never slept with any of them. And he was starting to feel the pressure getting to him. He needed to have sex, <br />
and soon, to feel normal.<br />
<br />
This wasn’t the only thing bringing him down though. His job was unfulfilling, having worked in as a waiter <br />
since leaving college. He wanted to do more, but no matter how many jobs he felt he was well-qualified for, <br />
the response to his applications always began ‘Dear Mr Carmichael, I regret to inform you...’, at which point <br />
David found it hard to read the rest. He’d worked hard for a good degree in management but no-one seemed to <br />
want to listen. He also didn’t like his body which was tall at 6’3, but lanky with it. Last time he weighed <br />
himself he was under 160lbs, very lean for his height. Working long, unsociable hours meant he didn’t have the <br />
time or motivation to go to the gym, even though he really wanted to. He longed to be more muscular, like the <br />
bodybuilders he saw on the front of magazines like Men’s Life, and he would have given almost anything to look <br />
that way.<br />
<br />
The one thing David was thankful for was his friends, he thought as he saw them gathered around their usual <br />
table in the bar. The same gang had been together a long time, right from the first day of college, and they <br />
got on very well together. There was Alex – a short, blonde, shaggy surfer-type, very attractive, always <br />
bragging about how many girls he’d slept with. All he seemed to do was fuck and surf. He’d always been <br />
popular, right through school when he was on the swim team (“Just so I could show the girls my body,” Alex <br />
would joke) and into his job now. None of the group really knew what he did for a living: it was something in <br />
an office and whenever he started to talk about it they all sort of zoned out.<br />
<br />
Next around the table was James. He was tall and skinny just like David, but James had managed to find himself <br />
a girlfriend a few years ago. When he was really drunk one night James said he was thinking of proposing, <br />
which the others all brushed off as drunk-talk at first. The next day though he showed them the ring he <br />
bought, and that he was just waiting for the right time to pop the question.<br />
<br />
On James’ right was Will, whose parents were both Chinese but as he was born in this country he didn’t have an <br />
accent or a stereotypical Chinese name. He was probably the most stylish of the group, always at the front of <br />
new trends, and always with a new girl on his arm. David envied how easily he was able to connect with girls, <br />
always wanting to ask him for tips but never quite getting up the nerve.<br />
<br />
Completing the group were Shaun and Bradley. They were brothers: Shaun was 25 and Bradley was younger at 22 <br />
but both were tall and built well, and both very successful with girls. David wished he had bodies like <br />
theirs, but he also found himself wondering how big their dicks might be, to his shame. He wondered if the <br />
rumours about African-Americans were true, and if they were if they’d be bigger than his ample 7 inches. It’d <br />
certainly explain why they had better luck than he did.<br />
<br />
David ordered a glass of red wine. His friends always poked fun at him for it, saying he couldn’t handle beer <br />
like the rest of them, and he went along with it. Truth be told, he just didn’t like the hoppy taste of beer <br />
and preferred the fruity strength from wine. He walked over to the table with his glass and sat down, “Hey <br />
guys,” he muttered in greeting.<br />
<br />
“Hey Wine-Boy,” said Shaun with a grin, “Settle a debate: would you be rich and lonely for life, or dirt poor <br />
but liked?”<br />
<br />
“I’ll go for the current situation and vote poor and liked – what did the rest of you go for?”<br />
<br />
“Can’t be that poor to drink red wine all the time...”Bradley said to chuckles from the rest of the group.<br />
<br />
“Well I went for rich,” said Alex, “Because then I can pay for people to be around me and pretend to be my <br />
friends. And, of course, buy whatever I want.”<br />
<br />
Shaun and Will nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
“Nah I’m with you on this one buddy, can’t buy me love and all that,” James said to David, with Bradley <br />
nodding in agreement.<br />
<br />
“Whatever, how did this come up?” David asked.<br />
<br />
“Well there’s this story in the paper about a guy who won the lottery and just ditched everyone who loved him, <br />
bought an island in the south Pacific and just lives in paradise. Alone,” replied Will.<br />
<br />
“Sounds kinda sad. But good luck to him. Anyway, I’m off for a piss,” David said as he pushed out his chair. As he walked over to the bathroom he didn’t notice that someone else had pushed out his chair too, and <br />
followed him in.<br />
<br />
While David was in mid-flow, a deep voice behind him said “I know how you feel.”<br />
<br />
David jumped: the voice was so deep he felt it more than heard it. He shoved his dick back into his pants and <br />
turned around to see who had spoken. As he saw him, David’s jaw dropped: standing in front of him was an <br />
enormous man: taller than David at what must have been 6’5 at least, and muscular too. He was wearing a tight <br />
white wifebeater which showed off his arms and chest, which were so big they would have put most bodybuilders <br />
to shame. His green eyes were piercing as they looked into David’s, with a devastatingly handsome face covered <br />
in a few days’ stubble. His huge hands were on his hips, allowing his half-flexed arms to look even bigger.<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?” David asked when he had recovered from the shock of seeing this mountain of a man.<br />
<br />
“I mean David, that you’re unhappy. You wish you were better than you are – more successful, bigger, more <br />
confident – well, more like me I guess,” the man said as he flashed a cocky grin.<br />
<br />
“And who are you?”<br />
<br />
“I’m Tony. And I can help you become who you want to be.”<br />
<br />
David was curious now. There was no harm hearing Tony out at least, “Go on.”<br />
<br />
“I looked like you once, felt like you too. Unloved, unfulfilled, jealous of the successes of my friends, <br />
wishing I could be more like them. And one day I met a man who changed me into who you see before you. Into <br />
the man I wanted so much to be. This, David, is what I’m offering: the chance to be who you’ve always wanted <br />
to be – who you DESERVE to be.”<br />
<br />
David was sweating now. How did Tony know what he wanted? And what exactly could he be offering? It all <br />
sounded very tempting - he had to take a chance, “What do I have to do?”<br />
<br />
Tony smiled, locked the bathroom door from the inside, and dropped his jeans to reveal a huge hard dick, must <br />
have been about 10 inches long and 7 in girth.<br />
<br />
“Suck on me, drink my seed, and you’ll be who you want to be within a month, I guarantee it.”<br />
<br />
“No way, I’m not gay man.”<br />
<br />
Tony shrugged, and pulled up his jeans. “Too bad. I guess you’ll spend the rest of your life this way then. Just tell me David, tell me one thing: when’s the last time you got laid?”<br />
<br />
David found this too much to take – that provocation was enough for him to strengthen his resolve. If he <br />
needed to suck off one guy to become a stud all the girls would want, so be it. So he went over to Tony, <br />
pulled down his jeans, and sucked on his hard shaft. Tony purred in pleasure as David ran his tongue along the <br />
head of his huge dick, slowly working its way along the length. He hated himself for it, and the taste was <br />
revolting, but he forced himself to carry on. Pretty quickly, Tony said, “Oh God David, here it comes, you <br />
ready?” and more or less immediately hot jets of cum burst into David’s mouth. David almost gagged in disgust <br />
but he forced himself to drink them down, sucking on Tony’s softening shaft until he was all dry.<br />
<br />
Tony chuckled, bent to pick up David’s phone and typed something in. He threw a business card to David and <br />
said, “Good. Well David, you’ll be a new man within a month.”<br />
<br />
And with that, he pulled his jeans back up, unlocked the door and left, with David feeling disgusted and <br />
cheated. Why had he allowed Tony’s provocation to affect him? More sickeningly, this was the most sexual thing <br />
David had ever done, and it was with another man. With that, he shoved the business card into his back pocket, <br />
ran out of the bathroom, straight home, avoiding his friends completely. As soon as he got to his apartment, <br />
he went straight to bed, hoping to forget about the whole experience.</p>
