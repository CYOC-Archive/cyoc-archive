<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">TJ was out of breath and panting halfway through the second game.<br />
<br />
Being a fat kid was hard on him. He didn’t like physical activity, it made his knees hurt, his back hurt, and the air burned in his lungs at the mere thought. And yet, here he was, catching more balls than he ever had in the total sum of his lifelong dodgeball career.<br />
<br />
Normally, he’d be afraid of those throws. He didn’t like getting hurt. But that hot, spicy wolf musk lingered in his nose and it made his shorts tent visibly and his face flush. It filled him with a strange sort of confidence, that since Alpha-since Axel believed in him, he could do anything.<br />
<br />
Axel was throwing zinger after zinger at his opponents, much to the delight of Jeremy and Austin. <br />
<br />
Whatever Axel missed, TJ caught. He was sweating, his t-shirt soaked. There were sweat stains around his collar, armpits and bellybutton and the shirt was clinging to his fat gut, but TJ was having the time of his life.<br />
<br />
Every time Axel clapped him on his back, TJ’s little cock spasmed and drooled precum into his athletic shorts. That was getting a dark stain too, but his belly covered most of his crotch so it really wasn’t visible. Axel’s bobbing boner was a distraction, but TJ soldiered through his lust.<br />
<br />
The battle was getting more an more one-sided the longer the game went on.<br />
<br />
Sure, Adam and his human friends were all athletes, but the wolves seemed to have endless stamina. They weren’t sweating nearly as much, though they were panting rather heavily. He could tell they were, at least, feeling a bit fatigued. That was something of a miracle and a testament to Adam’s skills. <br />
<br />
That and Adam’s team was mostly athletes and Jeremy had only chosen girls and weak guys, probably on purpose to make the match more even. And yes, there were athletic girls, but Adam had scooped all three of the volleyball players. It didn’t matter. <br />
<br />
The nonstop assault against their key players crippled the other team. TJ watched in awe as Axel threw ball after ball with unerring accuracy. He thought Axel looked a bit more athletic, his arms more muscular, but it must have been his imagination.<br />
<br />
Then, the game was over. They’d won. Their team cheered as Coach Silver whistled and the bell ending the day went off.<br />
<br />
Everyone hurried to the locker room, trying to catch the bus.<br />
<br />
TJ was exhausted. He was sweaty and gross and tired. There was no way he was catching the bus today. His mom would have to come pick him up. <br />
<br />
What he really wanted was a shower, so he waited until everyone had left and stripped, his fat gut sagging out, and waddled to the shower room.<br />
<br />
It was thankfully deserted. He turned on a shower and let it run until steam filled the room. Then he stepped under the water and enjoyed a hot soak. He scrubbed himself down with soap thoroughly, leaving his hairless pale skin pink where he’d scoured.  Then he stood there and let the water soothe the aches and exhaustion away.<br />
<br />
There was movement behind him.<br />
<br />
TJ turned and saw Axel strutting in. It must have been his imagination, but Axel looked a bit more muscular than usual. Nothing like Austin or Jeremy, but his biceps were nice, his back wide, his cock…TJ licked his lips at the sight of the drooling red rocket. <br />
<br />
“H-hey Axel, how’d I do?” TJ asked timidly.<br />
<br />
Axel smirked. “I just had a talk with the boys.”<br />
<br />
“W-what’d they say?”<br />
<br />
Axel was behind TJ now. TJ gasped as he felt Axel’s paw grope one of the nerd’s flabby buttocks. The wolf sniffed his neck softly.<br />
<br />
“I little firmer, I think, less saggy.” Axel spoke like TJ wasn’t even there.<br />
<br />
“What?” TJ asked.<br />
<br />
“Hmm, sorry, I have to have a firm idea of what I want in my mind before I…kiss you.” Axel grinned, thick strands of saliva falling from his lips. “The boys think you should be cuter. I like you as is, though. But I have to think of what’s best for The Pack.”<br />
<br />
“W-what do you mean? Kiss me? Are you-oh!” TJ gasped as the wolf hugged him from behind, the gesture tender and affectionate. <br />
<br />
The fat boy could feel that huge cock on his bareback, sliding across his smooth skin. Axel gripped him and pulled the fat boy closer. TJ could feel the soft wolf fur and some rather nice, thick  furry pecs against his back.<br />
<br />
TJ felt a sudden awkward pressure on his shoulder as the two paws gripped him tight.<br />
<br />
He glanced to his right and saw Axel, the hot wolf, suckling and lapping at a bite mark on his right shoulder. Though bite mark wasn’t quite right, it looked more  like a purplish hickey, though TJ thought he saw blood welling up from the teeth marks. Which was weird, because the entire right half of TJ’s body was numb.<br />
<br />
The hot wolf growled lustfully, his mouth oddly foamy, and dug his mouth tighter against TJ’s shoulder, shaking his head a little. Thick drool splattered across the floor and sizzled, the noise lost in the sound of the shower.<br />
<br />
TJ’s cock was rock hard. “Hey, Axel? Why are you giving me a hickey?”<br />
<br />
Axel pulled himself away from the strange mark on TJ’s shoulder and licked his lips, his teeth stained pink.<br />
<br />
“Oh, he went for it, bro!” Jeremy hooted from behind them.<br />
<br />
TJ turned in time to see the huge white-furred Jeremy and the red-furred Austin swagger into the showers. Both of their cocks were staggeringly erect. It made TJ cringe, knowing his little 3-incher couldn’t even compare.<br />
<br />
“G-guys?” TJ asked, his shoulder starting to itch. He scratched it absently, not noticing soft brown hairs pushing up from the wound. “W-what’s going on?”<br />
<br />
“Boys,” Axel growled, his voice deeper and more confidant. “Welcome our new Beta into the Pack.”<br />
<br />
“The pack?” TJ’s voice quivered as he scratched harder at the fur growing down his arm and across his moobs. “W-what-?”<br />
<br />
Jeremy and Austin descended up on him, their tails wagging. TJ found himself encircled by the wolves as they poked and prodded him.<br />
<br />
“Hey!” TJ gasped as he felt Austin’s cold nose nuzzle between his asscheeks, “S-stop-”<br />
<br />
“Not much musk,” Austin snuffled and lapped at TJ’s rear entrance.<br />
<br />
TJ felt Austin spread his cheeks apart, gripping and massaging them. <br />
<br />
He wanted to slap him away, but the two wolves and their fur and wagging tails were everywhere. His rear end began to firm up, flab becoming supported by muscle before becoming a large globe. TJ’s new over-inflated  bubblebutt wobbled as Austin dug his snout deeper.<br />
<br />
“Oh!” TJ moaned as the red-furred wolf lapped lovingly at his hole. <br />
<br />
The tongue was warm and moist yet firm, each lap making Austin feel more and more relaxed. His asshole clenched and spasmed with every lick and began to darken and puff. A warm, inviting musk filled the room, one that smelled eerily familiar to TJ.<br />
<br />
Austin’s eager tongue plunged deeper inside TJ’s loosened ring, eliciting more moans from the fat boy. It explored his insides, licking him out. TJ’s pucker began to clench wantonly around the tongue as it brushed something that had him moaning and bucking. The wolf’s tail wagged as Austin’s drilled that sensitive spot over and over again. Precum dribbled from TJ’s cock as a pleasant, fluttery pressure built deep inside of him. <br />
<br />
TJ felt himself rising up further and further on his toes, the pressure of Austin’s assault on his prostate growing almost unbearable. He wanted to scream or howl. And then the wolf pulled out, leaving TJ feeling desperately empty. His pucker winked lewdly and a soft whine escaped his darkening lips.<br />
<br />
As Austin’s tongue pulled away, TJ’s spine popped and a fluffy tail unfurled from his wide backside. <br />
<br />
“Nice and soft. We should keep that.” Austin commented as his paws roamed around TJ’s increasingly furry rump. TJ’s tail continued to grow, tucking itself between the fat boy’s legs. Austin saw it and chuckled. “God, I take it back, he’s gonna be a cute pup. Good choice, Axel.”<br />
<br />
TJ looked up to see Axel smirking proudly, his tail wagging.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but his dick is really small.” Jeremy groped TJ’s cock and balls with a paw, eliciting a groan of protest from TJ. The wolf rolled TJ’s small balls in his paw. “That’s fine, but his balls cold use some work.”<br />
<br />
Jeremy’s tongue bathed TJ’s balls in saliva. Then the wolf took them in his mouth rolling them around. TJ gasped and moaned, his balls churning as the wolf’s tongue played over them. They felt swollen, stuffed to the brim with cum.<br />
<br />
TJ’s hairy hand fell on top of the wolf’s head as the tongue massaged his cum-swollen balls. He moaned, his balls feeling tight, pulsing in the wolf’s maw. Jeremy’s suction increased, the pressure inside TJ’s testicles building to a crescendo. The increasingly wolf-like chub shivered, feeling his orgasm growing closer and closer.<br />
<br />
Then the wolf abruptly pulled away. <br />
<br />
TJ’s sack plopped out of his muzzle and sagged lower than before. It slapped against TJ’s thick thighs, the softball-sized testes hanging plump and heavy, the wet fur covering his new scrote tickling in the air as it swayed. <br />
<br />
“There, we can milk him for extra protein.” Jeremy grinned. “That tiny little cock of his is gonna leak like a faucet!”<br />
<br />
“I-It’s not that small!” TJ protested, his increasingly hairier face red in shame and embarrassment.<br />
<br />
Jeremy sighed. “Don’t worry, I’ll give you some more meat to play with. It’s not like you’ll actually need it as a Beta.”<br />
<br />
TJ wondered what he meant when the wolf’s hungry mouth engulfed his little twitching dicklet. <br />
<br />
Jeremy’s mouth was like a vacuum cleaner. If TJ thought the pressure on his balls had been bliss-inducing, the suction on his cock was nearly broke him. He moaned and writhed as Jeremy’s tongue wrapped around his shaft, slurping and suckling on it loudly. His cock grew and twisted, becoming strangely bulbous at the base.<br />
<br />
With a *pop*, Jeremy pulled away from a much longer, thicker doggy dick, so red it looked like lipstick pushing from TJ’s pubic fur.<br />
<br />
The wolves continued gripping and massaging TJ’s body, fondling his moobs, firming the muscle up beneath them until they were plump pillows.<br />
<br />
Axel stepped forward and planted a kiss on TJ’s mouth. TJ’s maw began to tingle, his nose growing dark and wet and flaring, smelling the lusty wolves around him. The Alpha pulled away slowly, TJ’s nose and mouth creaking and pushing outwards to keep up with Axel’s mouth.<br />
<br />
“You look good, TJ,” Axel said, playing with TJ’s ears as they rose up the side of his head and unfurled into a proper wolfish shape.<br />
<br />
“W-why-?” TJ whined.<br />
<br />
“Why you or why a wolf?” Axel shrugged. “Because I had a crush on you. Because you are a wolf and not a dog or coyote, so you’re super rare.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, Betas are usually a lesser canine species.” Jeremy said.<br />
<br />
“B-but why am I still fat?”<br />
<br />
“I can give you some muscles, but I like you fluffy.” Axel whispered, biting TJ’s ear gently.<br />
<br />
Axel ran his paws over TJ’s form, his body growing firmer in all the right places. TJ’s felt his belly round and rise as he grew tight abs under his blubber. It was a far cry from his flabby, saggy form before, now he looked more like a burly ex-jock.<br />
<br />
“There.” Axel smiled.<br />
<br />
“Much better.” Austin eyed TJ critically. He reached out a paw and squeezed on puffy arm. “Firm but still soft and yielding.”<br />
<br />
“Not a completely gross tub of guts like before.” Jeremy agreed.<br />
<br />
“Hey!” TJ’s yelp of protest went ignored.<br />
<br />
“Let’s break him in!” Austin’s tail wagged.<br />
<br />
Jeremy grinned. “Front or back?”<br />
<br />
“I’m gonna see if I can get him inside of me. Go ahead and take his ass, Jeremy!” Austin wagged excitedly.<br />
<br />
Austin got down on all fours, scooting backwards beneath TJ’s belly. His waggy tail brushed the fat wolf’s new belly fur. TJ looked down to see Austin staring at him over his shoulder with a playful expression on his face.<br />
<br />
“What are you waiting for, Beta? Stick that new dick of yours in my ass!”<br />
<br />
“W-wha-?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, he’s a virgin. Here, like this,” Jeremy snorted, grabbing TJ’s cock and placing it at Austin’s pucker. “Now thrust, Beta.”<br />
<br />
“But he isn’t lubed-”<br />
<br />
“I said THRUST.” Jeremy placed a hand on TJ’s back and forcibly pushed TJ’s dick into Austin’s surprisingly pliable butthole.<br />
<br />
TJ gasped, feeling Austin’s warm, clenching insides. He was so tight and wet, his bulbous, muscular asscheeks squeezing around TJ’s newer, bigger cock. It drove him wild. He started thrusting like a mad man.<br />
<br />
“There we go, Beta, that’s the spirit. Give Austin’s ass a good plow.” Jeremy laughed, positioning himself behind TJ. “Now take a deep breath and let it out.”<br />
<br />
TJ felt Jeremy’s hands around his furry waist and glanced back to see his huge cock lined up between his wide asscheeks.<br />
<br />
“W-wait, I-Oh! Hohooo!” TJ hollered as the thick cock spread his hole wide.<br />
<br />
“Breathe, Beta.” Jeremy pat the wheezing fat wolf below him kindly. “Relax and let it in.”<br />
<br />
“Wah!” TJ said as Jeremy pressed deeper in him, the air leaving his lungs in a whoosh. Then it brushed past that lovely thing and he shook as a jolt of pleasure lanced through him. “Oh, God!”<br />
<br />
“Found it!” Jeremy cheered.<br />
<br />
TJ tried to breathe, the huge wolf cock spreading him wide. He felt so full and so good at the same time. It wasn’t… painful, per se, but more like an intense, foreign presence putting pressure on him in a way that had his toes curling in bliss. It was too much, he was gonna-<br />
<br />
Gonna-<br />
<br />
His hole spasmed wildly around Jeremy’s cock, his hips bucking involuntarily as he experienced his first orgasm. TJ’s balls pulsed and he felt the warm hole around his cock grow slicker as he fucked his own cum deep inside Austin’s ass.<br />
<br />
“Fuck yeah! Fuck me harder, Beta!” Austin howled.<br />
<br />
Jeremy kept plowing TJ’s furry ass, making the new wolf’s cheeks clap and bounce wildly. TJ moaned in bliss as the orgasm went on and on, his hole spasming and hips bucking. It was like Jeremy was prolonging it, his fat cock smacking his prostate over and over.<br />
<br />
“Guh! Guh!” TJ cried, his body shuddering.<br />
<br />
“He’s definitely not a virgin now!” Jeremy grinned and huffed. “Fuck, you’re so nice and tight, TJ!”<br />
<br />
There was another foreign feeling. <br />
<br />
Something was inflating at the base of TJ’s cock, smacking wetly against Austin’s pucker below him. Now that he thought about it, he could feel the same big knot bumping against his own stretched hole.<br />
<br />
“Fuck this is so hot. Open wide, babe,” Axel grinned, shoving his dick into TJ’s muzzle.<br />
<br />
TJ found himself sucking on the musky red organ like a pacifier. Axel started thrusting, holding TJ’s head steady, his fat cock’s head smacking against TJ’s throat. TJ gurgled and gagged for just a moment before his throat relaxed, opening up for Axel cock to slide down it. It forced TJ to breathe through his nose and filled his mind with Axel’s raw, masculine, dominating scent.<br />
<br />
The four wolves rocked together, building up a rythym that had TJ’s mind completely overwhelmed by competeing sensation. The fat cock in his throat, the smell of his Alpha, the huge cock in his rear, the hot, wet tunnel hugging his cock.<br />
<br />
Then Jeremy slammed his cock deep inside TJ, his knot blasting the fat wolf’s ring apart. With a strangled cry, TJ found himself thrusting hard and suddenly his overly sensitive knot was forced through Austin’s tight ring. His ass involunatarily clenched around Jeremy’s knot and thw olf finally released.<br />
<br />
Hot cum flooded TJ’s bowels. Austin’s pucker spasmed and clenched around TJ’s cock and suddenly the most shocking pleasure tore through the new wolf’s mind in a blaze of overwhelming need and he was cumming as well. It was like a chain reaction.<br />
<br />
Axel thrust deeper and suddenly warmth was flowing down TJ’s throat. The four wolves shuddered and shivered as they all came. <br />
<br />
The warm water flowed over them, soaking their fur. Wet dog permeated the air. TJ found he didn’t mind it so much. His tail wagged as they waited for the knots to go down, the wolves enjoying the intense after glow.<br />
<br />
Finally, they managed to separate, the wolves proceeding to act like nothing had happened. <br />
<br />
“Here, fur shampoo,” Jeremy said, handing TJ a bottle. “You’ll need to buy this.”<br />
<br />
TJ nodded and shampooed, the other wolves helping him, giving him little gropes while the did. TJ felt… nice. Being objectified for the first time in his whole life was gratifying.<br />
<br />
He stood under a blowdryer for ten minutes before searching for his clothes. <br />
<br />
“Looking for something, Beta?” Austin grinned, the red-furred wolf holding up TJ’s clothes.<br />
<br />
TJ reached for them, but Austin pulled them out of reach.<br />
<br />
“You don’t wear clothes.” Axel said. “None of us do.”<br />
<br />
“B-but my cock is hard.” TJ blushed under his fur.<br />
<br />
Which was true, his cock hadn’t calmed down even after the five-minute long orgasm.<br />
<br />
“Yes it is, and it’s a very nice cock. Thank Jeremy for it.” Axel replied mischievously.<br />
<br />
“Thanks Alpha, I knew he wouldn’t be needing it but I couldn’t let him go with such a tiny dicklet!” Jeremy guffawed and slapped TJ across his furry back, making his body shake. “It’s bigger than most humans. Be proud.”<br />
<br />
TJ found himself nodding. Of course, humans had much smaller cocks than wolves. Compared to the other wolves, however, he was definitely the smallest.<br />
<br />
“Can you at least give me back my pants so I can get my phone? I have to call my mom so she can pick me up.” TJ said.<br />
<br />
“No, you aren’t leaving. You’ll stay after practice and lick the sweat from our bodies. That’s your place now.” Jeremy leered.<br />
<br />
TJ started to panic. “But I have to go home sometime! My Mom is going to kill me!”<br />
<br />
“Home?” Jeremy and Austin looked at each other, confused.<br />
<br />
“You know, where my room is?” TJ said exasperated. “Wolves do have bedrooms, right?”<br />
<br />
“What?” Axel cocked his head. “Oh, I think I understand. Austin, you live with me now. You’re my Beta. It’s basically a boyfriend position in the pack.”<br />
<br />
“...What?” TJ said flatly.<br />
<br />
“Austin and Jeremy will bring your stuff over. Don’t worry, my room is really big, Dad prepped it just in case I make a Beta.” Axel’s tail wagged and he hugged TJ tight. “I’m so excited! I promise I’ll let you sleep in my bed, okay? We can fuck all night to celebrate.”<br />
<br />
TJ was in a daze. <br />
<br />
His cock was achingly hard and the Alpha was clearly in love with him, which should make him happy. But at the same time, human TJ was still inside of him and telling him this was all wrong. With nothing else to do, he hugged his… boyfriend? <br />
<br />
“There, just stay in here and we’ll come back all musky and ready for that tongue of yours.” Axel patted TJ on his back, making his body jiggle.<br />
<br />
“Okay, Alpha.” TJ said, his tail wagging.<br />
<br />
He couldn’t say no to his Alpha.</p>
