<br />
Mary Finly got home, after being dropped of her boyfriend, she realized she was home alone so she decided to go and take a shower before using the cap you got her boyfriend to use to try out being a guy aka her boyfriend, so she went up stairs and but her bag with the cap in outside here room and run into her room to get new clothes to wear after, and headed into the bathroom and locked the room.<br />
<br />
Mike was in his room when he heard the Barth room door slam shut, he wondered if his mom is finely back with his snack he asked for and went out of his room, and in the corridor, he saw a shopping bag leaning on his sister&#39;s door he thought maybe his mom left him something for him accidentally in the bag, so he looked inside and yep there was a cap what he has never saw his sister or mom never wear anything like a cap so it must have been for him so he picked it up and put it on his head, and it was way to big flopping around his 13 year old head, he took it off and looked at it seeing it is for an adult man, and Mike thought, god dam it mom never pays attention to anything she buys him, and throw it back in the bag, not wanting to get in a augment with his mom tonight and went back in to his room and started to play his game again, joining a discord chat where his friends were already in.<br />
<br />
Mary was done in the shower now and thought it over that she might as well try being her boyfriend as seen as she can so if she did not like it she can just try and sleep throw all of it, she did not know what it would be to have a penis and no boobs, and well she is going to be someone she loves and gets turned on by, so she went to the bag and she brought it into her room, she got the pair or boxer shorts what she brought aswell not knowing what size Grants dick is but looking at his bulge a lot of times to think that this was the right size, so put the hat and boxer on the bed and headed down stairs where she knew where her mom hid the medallion.<br />
<br />
Mike was still talking to his friends back at his old home, while playing a game with them, and after 20 or so minuets he heard a hungrily loud “AAAAAAAAAAAA” what sound surprisingly familiar, and Mike wanted, no needed to see where it come from it sounded like it come from his moms or sisters&#39; room? So Mike picked up a glass bottle of fizzy pop, and slowly mad is way towards his sister&#39;s room seeing the door already open what it never is with her being a 16 year old girl and does not like any one going inside it, but when mike got there, he could not believe what he saw, it was a mirror image of himself wearing to big clothes what looked like something his sister would wear, and found him saying in a shaky voce “ho---how are you.” forgetting all about the medallion and the days he spent as his sister and mother and waved the glass bottle in his hand at his twin.<br />
<br />
Mary looked kind of scared seeing his brother who is now as high as she now is and threatening to hit him with a bottle, and she did not want to tell her little brother that it was her in his body but I guess she now HE did not have a choice and said “Mike it is me, Mary, I used the medallion and I somehow ended up as you?” she could see that he started to add things together and lowered the bottle and put in on a shelf in her now his room.<br />
<br />
Mike looked at his now twin and said “why have you tuned into me, I thought you thought I was a nerd?” Mary looked at him and said “I did not mean to, I wanted to be Grant, and this is a hat (with her/him showing the cap what Mike tried on) what Grant last warn and well this happened” with her/him looking at his/her brother and saw a familiar face trying to hide his guilt and she/he felt a new type of anger go throw him/her, it felt strong and I&#39;m controllable and she shouted “you little runt? What did you do!” with her/him moving his new body forward but her new dick swag out of her/his pantie she/her was still wearing, what made her stop out of shock for a second.<br />
<br />
Mike said “hay., I..1 saw a cap thinking that mom brought it for me and put it on and well it was too big so I put it back not wanting to make trouble and well I guess here we are” she/he looked at him with a very familiar frustrating face and let out an annoyed noise what sounded assertively like when Mike got frustrated what freaked out Mike a bit and said” Fine, I guess you did not mean to, but now what, I am stuck in your body for 12 house what will I do an till tomorrow morning?”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mike thought for a second and suggested and said “well maybe borrow some of my clothes, because I can see my dick hanging out of your dress?” she/he looked down and could not believe what she saw, his was right, seeing her brothers now his dick hanging out the front of her or I guess for now “his” dress and he quickly covered it up, feeling his first ever dick never expecting it to be his own, and said “fine get some of you clothes but, ones what you have never warn, and stop looking at my.... just stop looking at it!!!” Mike smiled for the first time and said “jezz chill bro, it is not like I never seen it before, if you haven&#39;t realized we are twins now” Mandy step towards him feeling his new equipment wobble so he stopped with it feeling foreign“ Mike stood back and said “ok, ok bro I will go and get you some more fitting clothes, but just to let you know you have my full permission to experiment all you want with my body, I know I did with yours when I could” with him running out of the door slamming it shut dodging the pillow what Mary throw haring the last thing he said.</p>
