<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michael looked up at Freddy. <br />
<br />
“I think I’m ok. I’m just in a lot of pain right now. It was fine up until your knot expanded. That’s when it stopped being so pleasurable and started hurting a lot.”<br />
<br />
“Mind if I take a look in there?” Freddy asked.<br />
<br />
Michael nodded as Freddy gently reached down and put a finger to Michael’s butt. He could feel more of the dog cum leaking out. He swiped some and put it to his mouth to sample it. <br />
<br />
“Not very tasty” Freddy thought to himself. <br />
<br />
Freddy proceeded to put his finger back down and began to gently inset it into Michael’s asshole. Michael moaned quietly as Freddy stuck his finger all the way in and moved it around the inside of his asshole. <br />
<br />
“It doesn’t feel like anything is out of place in there” Freddy continued. “However, I’m not a doctor, so I can’t say for sure.”<br />
<br />
Freddy took his finger out and saw more cum on it, but fortunately, no blood. And thank goodness, no shit either.<br />
<br />
“Want me to put some ointment in there? Freddy asked. <br />
<br />
Michael nodded as Freddy got up.<br />
<br />
“Mind if I take a shower first?”<br />
<br />
“I mean I guess” Michael replied. “Though I don’t see why. You’re going to be a dog again soon, anyway. What do you need a shower for?”<br />
<br />
“Hmm. Good point. I’ll skip it.”<br />
<br />
Freddy walked to the bathroom and found a container of ointment in a drawer. When he came back to the bedroom, he carefully sat back down on the bed. He opened the ointment bottle to squeeze some onto his finger. He sealed the container shut and began to gently inset his finger back into Michael’s asshole. Slowly, Freddy began to massage inside of his lover’s asshole, hoping to help him heal as a way of showing his appreciation for offering himself up to him….or rather, to Fido. <br />
<br />
Michael stopped sobbing as he began to feel better. It was really considerate of Freddy to do this for him. It wasn’t just done out of a sense of obligation, in his thoughts. The way Freddy was working his finger in there gently felt like an expression of love. Michael felt a sense of relief wash over him, grateful for this moment of intimacy before a tough day would begin. <br />
<br />
When Freddy was done, he got up to wash his hands in the bathroom. Michael joined him in there soon after. <br />
<br />
“Mind if I take a shower now?” Michael asked as he turned on the water. <br />
<br />
“Fine by me” Freddy replied as he finished washing his hands. “Mind if I join you? I know you said it wouldn’t make a difference, but I’d still like to clean myself off.”<br />
<br />
Michael hesitated before he responded.<br />
<br />
“I guess so.”<br />
<br />
Freddy smiled as he got in and joined Michael in the shower. The two lovers gently let the water wash over them as they shampooed their hair and went about cleaning themselves off. <br />
<br />
“Let me have the soap for a second” Freddy said as he motioned it to him.<br />
<br />
Michael handed Freddy the bar of soap as he gently began to rub it along Michael’s back. It felt so sensual for his boyfriend to do this for him, Michael thought to himself. This was the first time that the two of them had the opportunity to shower together. Sure, the shower space was limited, but the boys made it work. Michael could see himself doing this more often when they finally had the opportunity to live together on their own. <br />
<br />
Freddy continued to wash Michael’s arms and legs, taking care to be thorough as possible. Finally, Freddy reached down to Michael’s butt and gave it a little spank.<br />
<br />
“Hey” Michael called out, with a playful tone in his voice. <br />
<br />
“That’s mine” Freddy jokingly said with a smile. “That beautiful, perky butt is all mine.”<br />
<br />
“It’s yours whenever you want it. Let’s break this curse first and then we can finally have human sex again.”<br />
<br />
Freddy fell silent for a moment as Michael looked to him, nervous that he may have said something wrong. <br />
<br />
“You’re right, Michael. I’m anxious to break this spell. Let’s finish up in here so I can change back and become Fido again.”<br />
<br />
“Freddy…”<br />
<br />
Freddy leaned in to kiss Michael as the water ran down their bodies. <br />
<br />
“It’s ok. You’re right. It was fun fucking you as a dog, though admittedly, I don’t really remember that much of it, but it’ll be nice to fuck you with an organ that you can easily handle without us worrying about you ending up in the emergency room.”<br />
<br />
Freddy looked down to his penis. It was flaccid, but not small. <br />
<br />
“Not that my unit isn’t satisfactory enough on its own” he continued. <br />
<br />
“Agreed” Michael replied as he kissed Freddy. “I’m looking forward to that thing fucking me again.”<br />
<br />
Freddy smiled as Michael took the bar of soap from him and did the same to his lover. Freddy moaned in relief as his back muscles were worked with precision. Michael was really good at giving massages. It was sad that he hadn’t done it for him all this week while this curse was in effect. It would have comforted Freddy so much if he had, but it’s better that it’s happening now than never. <br />
<br />
Michael continued to work his hands all over Freddy before grabbing his penis and shaking it a few times. <br />
<br />
“Should we try changing you back now?” Michael asked.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know…” Freddy hesitated. “Maybe we should wait. Having the scent of wet dog, and my fur all over the bottom of the tub, may not be such a good idea with your dad’s allergies.”<br />
<br />
“You’re right.”<br />
<br />
Michael shut off the shower as the two of them got out to dry themselves off. Freddy dried himself off first before offering to assist Michael. Freddy sensually rubbed his lover’s hair as he moved the towel over him with care. He made sure every spot of Michael was dry. When they were done, they decided to forego wearing towels around their waists as they walked together naked down the hall to Michael’s bedroom. When they got inside, Michael kissed Freddy again.<br />
<br />
“Come out again, Fido” he said. “We need you.”<br />
<br />
Freddy pushed him back.<br />
<br />
“Can it wait?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Freddy…time is of the essence. We should get you, I mean Fido, back as soon as possible.”<br />
<br />
“I’m just not very horny right now.”<br />
<br />
“Are you serious?”<br />
<br />
Michael looked at Freddy with an annoyed expression.<br />
<br />
“I am, Michael. I just had an amazing orgasm and it’s going to take me a little while before I can get horny again.”<br />
<br />
“Well how long is it going to take you, Freddy? We don’t have all day.”<br />
<br />
“I know!” he snapped. <br />
<br />
Michael stood back as Freddy instantly felt a sense of guilt in having reacted that way. <br />
<br />
“Sorry” he apologized. “I’m just feeling a little on edge at the moment, that’s all. Besides, this bickering isn’t going to help me bring Fido back out.”<br />
<br />
“It’s fine, Freddy.”<br />
<br />
Michael went in to hug Freddy as the two embraced in their birthday suits. After a few minutes of their loving embrace, Michael pulled back and motioned Freddy to sit on the bed. The two of them sat down and got to talking.<br />
<br />
“We have a few hours before my parents should be coming home” Michael said. “You look like you didn’t get a very good nights sleep last night. Want to take a short nap before we try to change you back again?”<br />
<br />
“I’d like that” Freddy replied as he smiled. “Thanks Michael.”<br />
<br />
“Do you want me to leave?” he asked as he got up from the bed.<br />
<br />
“No” Freddy replied as he grabbed him his hand, pulling him back in to the bed with him. “Stay. I wanted you so badly in my arms last night. Let’s take advantage of this moment while your parents aren’t here.”<br />
<br />
“Ok.”<br />
<br />
The boys settled themselves into Michael’s bed as they quietly drifted off to sleep. Freddy spooned Michael as they looked as comfortable as lovers could be. Time passed before Michael stirred awake. He could feel Freddy’s arms around his stomach, gripping him tightly as if he was subconsciously possessing him. <br />
<br />
“Freddy?” he called to him.<br />
<br />
Freddy didn’t move at first before Michael shook him awake. <br />
<br />
“Huh, what” Freddy replied. <br />
<br />
“Freddy, we should be getting up now.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, right. What time is it anyway?”<br />
<br />
Michael got up to check out his phone. <br />
<br />
“Oh my God!” Michael yelled. <br />
<br />
Alarmed, Freddy quickly got up and ran over to place his hands on Michael’s shoulders. <br />
<br />
“It’s 3 PM!” Michael yelled “It’s getting late.”<br />
<br />
“Oh shit” Freddy replied. “You’re right.”<br />
<br />
The boys panicked for a moment before Michael thought to grab the pheromone spray from one of his drawers. He sprayed some on his hand and put it Freddy’s face. <br />
<br />
“Smell this” Michael said as he urged Freddy towards him.<br />
<br />
“Yuck” he replied as he briefly sniffed it and quickly stood back, with a repulsed look on his face. “Fido gets turned on by that?”<br />
<br />
As if to answer the question, Freddy’s dick turned back into a dog’s sheath.<br />
<br />
“That must mean yes” Freddy continued, as if to answer his own question. <br />
<br />
Rapidly, Freddy changed back into Fido at the fastest time so far. Michael couldn’t even see the changes very clearly as within a matter of seconds, Freddy fell onto his hand and knees as he turned into Fido. As if within the blink of an eye, the dog appeared once more, standing there, looking up at Michael curiously. <br />
<br />
“Wow, that was fast” Michael thought to himself as he put the bottle away and began to get dressed. <br />
<br />
Freddy thought it was odd as well that the transformation happened so quickly. While he didn’t like the smell of that spray, evidently Fido did. That’s al that mattered as they needed to get going to Sofya’s as soon as possible. It was getting late. Michael’s parents would be home soon.<br />
<br />
Michael finished getting dressed as he pulled out a collar and leash from his knapsack.<br />
<br />
“Your mother gave me this, Freddy, and, although I know you’re going to hate me doing this, it’s important for Sofya to have this in case she needs to walk you or you need to go outside.”<br />
<br />
Fido whimpered as Michael bent down to put the collar around his neck and attached to leash to it. <br />
<br />
“Let’s go, boy” Michael called to him.<br />
<br />
Fido whimpered again as he refused to move. <br />
<br />
“Come on boy, let’s get going” he tried again.<br />
<br />
Fido stood silently. <br />
<br />
“Oh, right” Michael corrected himself. “Sorry, Freddy. Let’s go.”<br />
<br />
Fido barked twice as he allowed Michael to tug at the leash to walk him out of the house. The two made their way downstairs before Michael went to open the front door. <br />
<br />
“Good thing my parents have been gone all day. It would be a major problem if….”<br />
<br />
Before Michael could finish that thought, he opened the door to discover…..</p>
