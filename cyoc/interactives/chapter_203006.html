<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Renata Hamilton settled into Delilah&#39;s pile of heart-shaped cushions on the sofa. It was so weird to be naked with her best friend&#39;s mom, to say nothing of the aforementioned best friend and her new girlfriend. Then again, Jezebel and her mom <i>were</i> succubi. Ruby and Jezebel snuggled into Renata&#39;s body, squishing their boobs against her furry shoulders.<br />
<br />
Delilah du Charme idly stroked one of her goatlike horns. &quot;Going by the look on your face, I&#39;d wager you haven&#39;t been in on our family&#39;s little secret for very long, Renata.&quot;<br />
<br />
Renata shook her head. &quot;No, I haven&#39;t. I&#39;ve been aware of the Supernatural for the grand total of twenty-four hours. Which is weird, considering I&#39;m part of it now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could tell by the almost frightened look on your face, darling,&quot; Delilah smiled soothingly. &quot;Mortals have an unfortunate tendency to assume that all demons are evil.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My mom certainly thinks that,&quot; said Renata. &quot;She has relatives in the monster-hunting business, and she&#39;s always saying negative things about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose that&#39;s why Jezzie never brought you over to visit before now,&quot; Delilah observed as she began to idly play with her clit. &quot;Yes, &#39;monster&#39; hunters do spread some truly awful propaganda about us. Even the ones willing to be open-minded about vampires, werebeasts, mermaids, faeries, and the like tend to get paranoid about demons. The fundamentalist ones especially seem to hate <i>sex</i> demons like me. Humans get so bashful about the most natural of things, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it true that demons come from Hell?&quot; asked Renata.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed it is,&quot; said Delilah, still rubbing at her quickly engorging pussy. &quot;I don&#39;t recommend you visit, though. Weather&#39;s terrible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t?&quot; asked a perplexed Renata. &quot;I thought demons were always trying to tempt people into Hell.&quot;<br />
<br />
Delilah laughed as she slid a clawed finger into her vagina. &quot;So humans assume! True, humans who please neither Father Day nor Mother Night get thrown in with us after they die, but we don&#39;t want <i>more</i> of them. They&#39;re really damn inconvenient.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why do succubi seduce humans?&quot; asked Renata.<br />
<br />
Jezebel (who had begun to masturbate herself) decided to answer that one. &quot;It isn&#39;t about their <i>souls</i>, Renata. It&#39;s for their <i>life force</i>. Different thing entirely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Their WHAT?!&quot; gasped Renata, the bushy fur on her tail standing on end.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just what Jezzie said,&quot; answered Delilah, who was wildly thrusting a finger in and out of her vagina with one hand and rubbing her clit with the other. &quot;When we lure humans into sexual acts, we absorb some of their animating energies from their anoglobulus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never heard of it,&quot; Ruby interjected as she fondled her fluffy tail like an extra pillow.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s an invisible organ near the anus that generates life force,&quot; Delilah explained. &quot;You may have encountered it while studying kappa lore under the term &#39;shirikodama&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ruby shrugged. &quot;Never been big on studying.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway,&quot; said Delilah, &quot;succubi have been tasked by the princes of hell to enter the human realm to gather as much life force as possible and periodically touch base with them to distribute it to all the hungry demons. Life force is our food, you see.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; said Renata. &quot;If you&#39;re harvesting people&#39;s life force, how the HELL are you not the bad guys?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jezebel giggled as she squished her meaty pussy lips between her pale red fingers. &quot;Hehe, you sound like a monster hunter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It isn&#39;t as bad as it sounds,&quot; Delilah explained. &quot;You see... Oh, oh, OHHHHHH!!!&quot; The elder succubus&#39;s purple-hued body spasmed and her bat wings stiffened as a potent orgasm wracked her body. She braced herself by clutching at her four tits, screaming in pleasure. Her body slackened as her climax wore off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about that, girls,&quot; Delilah smiled sheepishly. &quot;My fingers are just <i>too</i> good! Now, where was I? Ah, yes. Some amoral succubi don&#39;t really care how much life force they take from a human, but some do and take only very controlled amounts. The human barely knows anything was taken and usually just assumes that they were fucking too hard or something. Their anoglobulus usually produces enough fresh life force that they&#39;re back to normal in a day or less. Some of us do like to be humane.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Makes it easier to not get doused in holy water by monster hunters, too,&quot; Jezebel added.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Renata said thoughtfully, scratching her furry muzzle. &quot;Sounds like donating blood. Well, enough about the succubus lifestyle. Please tell me about <i>yourself</i>, Delilah. For the mom of my best friend, I know amazingly little about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Delilah said, snuggling deeper into her cushions. &quot;I was born in 1779 BCE. When I was sent to Earth to harvest life force for the demon princes, I made straight for Babylon. Let me tell you, that delightfully naughty city was the succubus capital of the world at the time.&quot; Delilah sighed nostalgically. &quot;Ah, what I wouldn&#39;t give to stroll beneath the blue-tiled Ishtar Gate with a lover on each arm again. After Babylon fell in 539 BCE, I fled to Greece. Greece had mostly been incubus stomping grounds, but there was plenty of room for a succubus in that bisexual land. (&#39;Incubus&#39; is a word for a male succubus, if you&#39;re wondering.)&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why <i>were</i> all those ancient Greeks bi, anyway?&quot; asked Ruby. &quot;I&#39;ve always wondered about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Greece was home to several large vampire clans with bisexual patriarchs back then,&quot; Delilah answered. &quot;Most of them were wiped out by monster hunters connected to the early Church, which was really strong in Greece. That was actually my cue to—&quot;<br />
<br />
Delilah was cut off by her daughter&#39;s orgasmic shrieks as she finished masturbating. &quot;Oh, oh! Unnngh! Oh, yes! Ah, ah! Fuck, yessss!&quot; Jezebel suddenly blushed a deeper red when she realized how much noise she was making. &quot;Oh, sorry, Mom. Didn&#39;t meant to interrupt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s quite alright, Jezzie,&quot; Delilah smiled kindly. &quot;Like I was saying, Christian monster hunters were on the rise in Greece two thousand years ago, so I made for Rome. The Christians eventually followed, but the monster hunting didn&#39;t. Not until around the Fifteenth Century, anyway. A lovely city, Rome. I had trysts with everyone from prostitutes to Pope John XII. Once the tide in the Vatican began to turn against magicals, I made my way to Florence. Oh, those darling Medicis. I admit there was a bit of trouble with a feisty friar named Girolamo Savonarola who had quite the grudge against anything beautiful (yours truly <i>definitely</i> included), but the good people of Florence soon tired of his dreary proclamations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously, that bastard was burning works of art,&quot; Jezebel added as she wiped her juices from her pubes with a Kleenex. &quot;Look him up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I stayed in Florence until 1859,&quot; Delilah went on. &quot;By that point, the allure of Paris was just too great. The city had always been an attractive feeding ground for succubi and incubi, but the growing prosperity and opulence it was enjoying under the rule of Napoléon III made it irresistible to me. I quickly set myself up as an exclusive courtesan (a sort of serial mistress for hire) and enjoyed the beds of everyone from actresses to the Emperor himself. The good times lasted until the autumn of 1939, when the Germans launched their invasion of France during World War II. Being more a lover than a fighter, I made my way to New York City. I spent the next thirty years in that crowded feeding ground, but it was tiresome having to compete with hundreds of other succubi and incubi.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that when you moved to Stokerville?&quot; asked Renata.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is,&quot; Delilah said, her forked tongue flicking out of her mouth as she reminisced. &quot;I spent the summer of 1969 searching for a small town with minimal succubus activity to set myself up in. I soon discovered a little place called Stokerville that was quickly becoming a bit of a lesbian mecca. Even better, it already had a strong magical community, including a vampire clan, a werewolf pack, and a witch who ran a shop catering to our special needs. It seemed perfect. After a few years posing as a high school student, I got down to business. Seeking to capitalize on the lesbian tourism, I invited over a few succubus friends and opened a nightclub called Inferno. Using all my know-how from Paris and New York, I made that place the hippest place for a lesbian to spend the night on the entire West Coast.&quot;<br />
<br />
Renata&#39;s bushy tail stiffened and her ears pricked up. &quot;YOU own Inferno?! That place is freaking <i>legendary</i> here in Stokerville!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have me to thank,&quot; Delilah said, proudly puffing out all four of her deep purple breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who was Jezebel&#39;s dad?&quot; asked Ruby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just an incubus who was passing through,&quot; Delilah shrugged. &quot;It was a one-night stand. A very fortunate one-night stand.&quot; She smiled lovingly at a somewhat embarrassed Jezebel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Must be pretty cool being a succubus,&quot; Ruby remarked. &quot;What kind of powers do you have?&quot;<br />
<br />
Delilah laughed. &quot;Not thinking of joining us, are you? You make such a beautiful werevixen. To answer your question, we have quite a few useful abilities. Most obviously, we have a sort of mesmerism similar to a vampire&#39;s, except it can only be used to cause the target to become sexually obsessed with us. For reasons both ethical and practical, I haven&#39;t used mine in over three hundred years. Being demons, we also never age... unless growing more uncannily beautiful and sprouting an extra set of tits counts as aging. As you likely noticed when I answered the door, we can also assume a human form to better blend in with our prey... if you&#39;ll excuse the expression.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will,&quot; Ruby said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can also use these wings to fly in our natural form,&quot; Delilah went on, &quot;but it can be hard to find a place where humans won&#39;t spot us flapping around in the air. We can also breathe fire, which comes in handy when &#39;monster&#39; hunters are around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweet!&quot; Ruby grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t get <i>too</i> excited, Ruby!&quot; Delilah chuckled, flicking at her four nipples as she talked. &quot;We also have weaknesses. Holy symbols of faiths that worship Father Day (crucifixes, for instance) can ward us off if the wielder has true faith. With the right ritual, such a holy symbol wielder could even exorcise us back into Hell. We also can&#39;t enter ground consecrated to religions of that nature. For example, we couldn&#39;t enter a Christian church or a Muslim mosque, but we <i>could</i> approach a Wiccan altar (since Wicca&#39;s mostly grounded in the worship of Mother Night). We&#39;ve also got a nasty salt allergy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Salt?&quot; Renata asked, somewhat confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like you wouldn&#39;t believe,&quot; Jezebel concurred. &quot;Gives us a terrible rash, or worse in large enough quantities. Cold iron sucks, too. It hurts us just as bad as it does faeries.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s nothing compared to holy water, though,&quot; said Delilah. &quot;It burns us like a strong acid. It may sound absurd, but there&#39;s no sight that chills us more than a monster hunter with a squirt gun in each hand. Well, enough about us. Tell me about <i>you</i> two.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ruby shrugged her red-furred shoulders. &quot;I&#39;m just a pretty regular werevixen. Unusually gorgeous, but otherwise regular. I live with my family&#39;s skulk and we travel around America in our caravan of mobile homes, getting into all kinds of awesome trouble. Mom&#39;s our skulk&#39;s alpha. Okay, maybe I&#39;m <i>not</i> so regular.&quot; Ruby grinned to herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you?&quot; Delilah asked Renata.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ve lived in Stokerville all my life,&quot; Renata began, &quot;and I&#39;ve been best friends with Jez since elementary school. She was my first time, you know. High school&#39;s been a wild ride; Jez and I have slept with more people than anyone else in our grade. I&#39;ve even been called the school vixen. Prophetic, huh? I discovered the Supernatural last night when I met Ruby and she revealed her true self to me, quickly followed by Jez doing the same. Well, Ruby introduced me to her skulk, and I just fell in love with their fun-loving ways... and their beauty. I went to Morgana and bought both a Werebrush and a fox-skin belt. I used the belt to turn myself, and I&#39;m using the Werebrush next full moon to start building a skulk of my own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How delightful,&quot; Delilah smiled. &quot;I&#39;ve always liked werefoxes. Of all werebeasts, they throw the best parties.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I also learned Just tonight that the Vordenburg side of my family are famous monster hunters,&quot; said Renata. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, though; I&#39;m on your side. I&#39;m pretty sure my sibling Beck is, too. They&#39;ve been acting weird lately, and I&#39;m beginning to think they&#39;ve become some kind of werebeast.&quot;<br />
<br />
Delilah grinned. &quot;How lovely to learn the Vordenburg seed isn&#39;t <i>all</i> bad. I went to school with your mother back when I was pretending to be a teenager, and I hope you don&#39;t mind my saying that Kimberly Vordenburg was the biggest prude I&#39;ve had the misfortune of knowing. Turned me down every time I offered to eat her out.&quot; The elder succubus stretched and spread her shapely purple legs. &quot;Well, I&#39;d say we now know each other well enough to enjoy some recreational fucking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Renata actually fell off the sofa and landed in a furry heap on the floor. She was hardly a prude, but could she really have sex with her best friend&#39;s mom?! Of course, Delilah du Charme was hardly a regular mom. Much hotter, for one thing. And social norms seemed <i>very</i> different for succubi...</p>
