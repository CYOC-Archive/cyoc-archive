<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Jess, Amy!  You&#39;re going to miss the bus!&quot;  Their mother knocked at their bedroom door.<br />
<br />
Jess groggily started waking up, her body feeling understandably strange, but no longer sore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jess, it&#39;s 7:30!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess&#39;s eyes shot open as panic set in.  Crap, she overslept!  &quot;Okay, I&#39;m up!&quot;  Or at least, that&#39;s what she wanted to say.  But she stopped herself after &quot;Okay&quot;, covering her mouth as she heard her new voice.  Remembering her transformation last night, she looked down at her chest, grabbing one of her breasts.  No, no, no, crap!  Why did she change herself to female?  Wait, &quot;she&quot;?  No, he&#39;s not ready to call himself a &quot;she&quot; just yet.  (It hadn&#39;t yet dawned on him that he responded to the name &quot;Jess&quot; instead of &quot;Jeff&quot;.)<br />
<br />
He looked at the clock on his nightstand.  7:31.  No time to change himself back to male.  He&#39;s just going to have to roll with the changes for now.  Jess quickly slipped out of bed, unwittingly pulling the still-asleep a-butt-osaurus off the bed, her head landing on the floor with a painful thud that they both felt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oof!&quot;  Amy woke up with a start.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry!  We gotta get going!  We need to get to school!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;School?&quot;  Amy thought for a moment, before her memories of this reality surfaced.  She lifted her head in happy realization.  &quot;Oh!  I get to experience school!&quot;<br />
<br />
As Jess was putting on a bra, though, he was less excited.  He was glad he knew how to put it on, thanks to the Chronivac, but he wasn&#39;t sure he liked that he now wore a bra.  He then dug a shirt out of his dresser.  It was one he always had as a male, featuring his favorite band, but had been altered to fit his now-female frame.  After putting it on, he looked in the mirror nearby.  There was his new self: an 18-year-old girl with the lower half of an apatosaurus and the head of one sticking out behind him.  Aside from those changes, though, he still looked mostly like himself, just more feminine.  He stepped closer to the mirror and opened his mouth.  He couldn&#39;t see it, but he knew somewhere in his throat was his relocated urethra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jess, Amy!&quot;  Their mom shouted from across the house.  Amy answered, this time.  &quot;We&#39;re coming, mom!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess looked at his longer hair.  A bit messy, but no time to brush.  He located a scrunchy and expertly tied his hair back into a ponytail.  Grabbing his bag, he quickly left his room.  No time for breakfast, either.  He&#39;ll have to grab a granola bar out of the kitchen on his way out.<br />
<br />
As he was about to step through the front door, he stopped himself.  He wasn&#39;t wearing any pants!  But then something clicked in the back of his mind, reminding him that he doesn&#39;t own any pants.  He decided to trust this thought, and zipped outside in time to see the school bus approaching the bus stop nearby.<br />
<br />
As Jess stepped on the bus, he noted the seat near the front with its backrest removed.  That seat had been modified for him and Amy.  With the way Amy sticks out behind Jess, a backrest would&#39;ve made sitting akward.  Jess sat down next to the window and leaned against it.  As he did so, he heard another student nearby.  &quot;Hey, dino-butts!&quot;  Jess turned to the voice and smiled, a bit surprised to find himself accepting the greeting as friendly and not an insult.<br />
<br />
Amy answered back.  &quot;Hi Stephanie!&quot;  Much like with Jess&#39;s family, the Chronivac had given Amy the necessary memories to be included among Jess&#39;s friends.<br />
<br />
Stephanie looked at Jess.  &quot;You okay, there?  Your hair&#39;s just a bit frizzy, there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I...&quot;  Jess paused a moment, still a bit caught off by his new female voice.  &quot;...Stayed up late.  Doing homework.  Woke up about ten minutes ago.  Didn&#39;t have time to brush.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well, here, take my brush.&quot;  Stephanie pulled a brush out of her bag and handed it to Jess.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot;  Jess pulled the scrunchy out of his hair and began brushing his hair, while Amy and Stephanie started talking about school work and the previous day.  It was interesting to hear Amy talk about yesterday at school, as though she had really been there.  But until yesterday afternoon, Amy had been living in a Chronivac simulation, among other dinosaurs.  Jess chimed in on occasion, but he found himself a bit distracted.  Not from brushing his hair; he had already finished and handed the brush back to Stephanie.  No, he was distracted by a dreadfully familiar tingling.<br />
<br />
He had to pee.<br />
<br />
Jess looked out the window, a bit frustrated with himself.  Why did he have to sleep in so late?  He had hoped to pee in the privacy of his own bathroom, where nobody can hear his inevitable reaction to having pee come out of his mouth for the first time.  Instead, he&#39;s going to have to go in the school&#39;s public restroom.  The girls&#39; restroom, Jess realized.<br />
<br />
Jess tapped into his new memories, of having lived his life in this new body.  The first thing he realized is that the girls&#39; restroom wasn&#39;t much different than the boys&#39; restroom.  But that wasn&#39;t important.  He was trying to remember peeing from his mouth in this new life.  It wasn&#39;t an easy thing to remember.  Kind of a dull memory.  Not much different than trying to remember peeing with his penis.  Mindlessly repeating the activity multiple times each day, it&#39;s not something one&#39;s mind bothers to remember with clarity.<br />
<br />
Regardless, he does remember peeing with his rearranged anatomy.  The question is, how did it taste?  That, he could not remember.  As far as his new memories were concerned, he never paid much attention to the taste.  It was just something he was used to, having lived this way his whole life.  Hopefully that meant he won&#39;t notice it, now.<br />
<br />
A few minutes until they arrive at school, and Jess realizes there&#39;s another sensation he&#39;s feeling: hunger.  Reaching into his bag, he pulls out the granola bar, and begins eating it.  He quickly notices how strange it feels to have food moving around in his mouth, especially across his more-sensitive tongue.  Of course, not only does his mouth now contain an orifice for peeing, but his whole mouth is now a sexual organ.  A female&#39;s sexual organ.  Thankfully, eating doesn&#39;t seem to be sexually stimulating.<br />
<br />
Having arrived at school, Jess and Amy said their farewells to Stephanie for now, and headed inside.  Jess made a beeline for the girls&#39; restroom, finding it harder to hold it in.  Thankfully, the restroom was empty for the moment.  Jess went into one of the stalls, careful to let Amy in with him before closing the stall door.  He may no longer have had a need for modesty on his lower body, but using the bathroom was still a private affair for them.<br />
<br />
Hesitating only a moment, Jess leaned over the toilet bowl, and stuck out his tongue.  Feeling himself release a muscle somewhere in his throat, the pee come out of the urethra at the base of his tongue, flowing across it before pouring into the toilet bowl below.  And the taste... was not as bad as he expected.  But it was still bad!  Gone was the leftover taste of the granola bar from earlier, now replaced by a rather rancid flavor.  Like some kind of juice that was way past its expiration date.  He also detected hints of last night&#39;s supper.  A bit of the juice from those burgers had seeped into his pee.  But it wasn&#39;t enough to save the experience.  Not only was it bad, but it was so surreal.  Both the sensation of pee flowing out from where it never flowed from before; and also having noticed the taste of his own pee for the first time, despite new memories saying he&#39;s tasted it his whole life.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Amy watched him from behind.  In this new reality, this was routine, and with this being a public restroom, she thought it best not to ask Jess of this new experience.  Besides, as she felt the pee come out of his mouth, she could very much imagine what it was like for him.  It may have been Jess&#39;s choice to alter himself in this way, but she couldn&#39;t help but feel sorry for him.  Yet with her own mouth having been repurposed into Jess&#39;s anus, she was also very thankful to have become a part of someone who would make this sort of sacrifice for her.<br />
<br />
As Jess&#39;s pee trickled to a stop, he spit out what remained in his mouth.  He wanted to swear at what he just experienced, but he knew this wasn&#39;t the best place.  Ugh, the aftertaste was bad, too.  Not terrible, but not pleasant.  Suddenly, there was another mental click, as Jess remembered he kept mouthwash strips in his bag.  In this reality, they were intended to clean his mouth after peeing, but he was more interested in rinsing the taste out.  He quickly grabbed one and placed it on his tongue.  After it melted and he swirled it across his tongue, he spit it into the toilet bowl, and gave it a flush.  His mouth tasted a lot better, though not perfect.  He wondered if this was what Amy&#39;s experience was like last night.<br />
<br />
As Jess left the bathroom stall and started making his way to his first class, he was undeterred.  He wasn&#39;t sure yet whether he wanted to stay as a female.  But as long as Amy was willing to live with the taste of Jess&#39;s poop, Jess was willing to live with the taste of his own pee.</p>
