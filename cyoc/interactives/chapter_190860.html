<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Daniel&#39;s mom went to her room to put on some clothes while he went to the bathroom as he was dirty with his fucking mom and needed to take a shower.<br />
<br />
After the shower Daniel checked and found his mother in the kitchen preparing dinner. She looked at him blushing, as she was still embarrassed about what had happened before, and told him to wait along with his sister who was watching TV in the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s you. I was hoping it was Mom telling me dinner is ready. Can you believe she took a nap in her bedroom and ended up sleeping too much? That&#39;s why she&#39;s late with dinner.&quot; Susan said<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t blame her, she&#39;s been working hard to support us since Dad died. She must be really exhausted.&quot; Daniel said<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but I&#39;m starving. I ate some cookies that were in the kitchen but they didn&#39;t do any good, it makes me so frustrated.&quot; Susan said<br />
<br />
A fear hit Daniel at what his sister said and just then he noticed that her blond hair was changing color, turning orange. &quot;Did you eat cookies? You weren&#39;t supposed to do that.&quot; he said<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not? I know, you got them from your girlfriend and wanted to keep it all to yourself.&quot; Susan said, Daniel noticed that her teeth were getting sharp.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not it, you got it wr....&quot; Daniel was cut<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be selfish, I only ate two cookies, there&#39;s plenty left for you. What are you looking at?&quot; Susan said, then noticing that her brother wasn&#39;t looking into her eyes, but lower down. She looked down and saw what caught his attention, her skirt being lifted by something alien on her body.<br />
<br />
Daniel knew what was under his sister&#39;s skirt, but he didn&#39;t want to believe that the same thing that happened to his mother was happening to her, especially after she came and part of her cum went through the fabric of her skirt while the rest fell on he floor.<br />
<br />
After her orgasm Susan noticed with more clarity the changes she was undergoing. She felt her clothes get uncomfortable as her muscles grew. She also noticed that her nails had turned into claws and said &quot;Daniel, what is happening to meeeeee....?&quot; and instinctively thrust her hips forward with all her strength, which made her skirt lift and expose her new cock. She tried to hide her new member by pulling her skirt back down, but her sharp claws didn&#39;t go through the fabric any more easily than she expected and, in another instinctive move, she thrust her hips forward once more, this time tearing her skirt and coming again.<br />
<br />
Daniel watched his sister come and, as the cum was shot by her clearly non-human cock, her panties were stuffed with her new ballsack, which a pair of testicles descended on. Her clothes started to get tight and she tried to shrug them off, but her fingers on her hand thickened and thickened, becoming what resembled feline front paws.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daniel... Please... help me... to... take off... my... clothes. They are... very... tight.&quot; Susan said, unable to undress herself, her hair now completely red. Her voice already sounded more masculine and her breasts were quickly reduced to nothing.<br />
<br />
Daniel saw no choice and went to help his sister out of her clothes, but there were some cracks and she lost her balance, falling on him when her leg joints reversed. At this time Susan came once more, soiling his clothes with his cum. As he enjoyed his nose became a feline snout, whiskers grew on him and a tail grew above his ass.<br />
<br />
Susan&#39;s moans quickly changed and resembled more of roars, just as the fur that grew on the tip of his tail made Daniel recognize that his sister was turning into a lion, which left no doubt when a short golden fur covered his body and his hair spread around his head, becoming a mane.<br />
<br />
Susan&#39;s transformation into a lion was complete and he got up enough for Daniel to get out from under him, but not before he was hit by cum from another orgasm from his sister.<br />
<br />
Daniel started to get scared, as now there was a hungry lion in the middle of the room that was his sister, who he had no idea if he still had any trace of his humanity or would attack him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is there a lion here?&quot; said Daniel&#39;s mother, shocked to see the animal she didn&#39;t know was her daughter, when she arrived with dinner ready.<br />
<br />
Susan looked at his mother and advanced on her, who out of fear let all the food fall to the ground, where the lion ate everything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daniel, what&#39;s going on here? Why is there a lion in the house?&quot; his mother asked<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Susan Mom. Susan turned into a lion.&quot; Daniel said<br />
<br />
&quot;What? But that is not possible.&quot; his mother said<br />
<br />
&quot;But you yourself turned into a stag a little while ago, don&#39;t you remember?&quot; Daniel said to his mother<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I honestly don&#39;t remember. I just remember my clothes getting terribly uncomfortable and the cock that grew between my legs, then I was naked in the shed and still owned a cock and was jacking off, until you called me there. I just don&#39;t remember anything that happened between these two moments.&quot; Daniel&#39;s mother said</p>
