<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Skyler was being taken to the swapping appointment by a butler, his father had no intention on being there for the whole ordeal.  The facility was massive and apparently Tony was there as well.  It was ordered by the court that they couldn’t interact on swap day so Skyler didn’t plan on seeing him anytime soon.  Well, unless it was in a mirror.<br />
<br />
He was asked to strip and put on a cheap medical gown.  He couldn’t remember much after that.  The sedatives they gave him were quite effective. <br />
<br />
When he groggily awoke the first thing he noticed were his hands.  Gone were the soft hands of a billionaire’s son, in their place were rough hands that were accustomed to labor.<br />
<br />
Skyler touched his cheek.  He could feel the slightly rough streak where the subtle scar was.  He still couldn’t believe the judge regarded this little mark as “permanent damage.”<br />
<br />
He then took a peek at his new penis.  He was a bit disgusted but not surprised to find it was uncut.  He was however, not expecting to find pubes.  He was 13 and hadn’t quite finished puberty in his old body, it seems this one was a bit further along in that department.  He cringed at the thought of Tony previously pleasuring himself in this body.  <br />
<br />
He took another peek of his new member.  “It’s certainly bigger, maybe it wouldn’t hurt to... NO, what am I even thinking?!” <br />
<br />
Skyler was interrupted by a knock on the door. “Godwin, get dressed and exit.  Your father requested your presence ASAP.”<br />
<br />
Skyler reached for his clothes and immediately realized that they would now fit pretty snug.  Damn, he didn’t think of bringing other clothes. He put on the now tight outfit.  He had to hold his shoes because he couldn’t fit his new feet into them.  He felt like some child hobo who that just raided a rich boys closet.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in another part of the facility.  Tony was just waking up from his own procedure. The only difference was that the doctor had decided to stick around to make sure he was alright. <br />
<br />
Everything around him looked a bit taller, he kinda forgot about Skyler’s shorter stature.  He looked in the mirror and tensed up a bit.  He always felt on edge seeing that face and mentally prepared for the teasing.  Now he only saw an expression of apprehension.<br />
<br />
“Well it looks like the swap was a success.” The doctor said looking at his chart.  “How are you feeling Mr. Martinez?”<br />
<br />
“A bit weird.”  Tony replied, the sound of Skyler’s voice catching him off guard.  “But overall fine.”<br />
<br />
“That’s good to hear.  I’m sure you’ll be wanting a bit of privacy now to familiarize yourself with your new body and get dressed.  Don’t be too preoccupied with it’s current condition.  Judging from your new genetic makeup, you will mature rather nicely.”<br />
<br />
The doctor stood up. “I’ll be outside with your lawyer and parents, come out whenever you’re ready.”  He excited the room.<br />
<br />
Tony sat up on the examination table.  The plastic coating was cool to the touch of his soft skin.  He closed his eyes.  “You gotta get over this.  This is your body now.  Not his.”<br />
<br />
Tony began to remove the gown.  He let his hand wander over to his new penis.  Apparently Skyler was circumcised.  Even with his smaller hands, Tony could tell that this dick was a bit in the premature side.  “I guess he wasn’t just overcompensating for his height.” Tony mentally noted.  He rubbed his hand around his now smooth naval.  He seemed to be hairless from the neck down.  <br />
<br />
Tony finally opened his eyes and looked at his new reflection in the large mirror on the wall.  His light skin made his blushing very apparent.  <br />
<br />
“This is so messed up.”  He said to himself, but he couldn’t stop rubbing at Skyler’s, no, his penis.  <br />
<br />
He gave into his urges and masturbated for the first time in his new body.  He tried to muffle his moans, they sounded too much like Skyler.<br />
<br />
He felt a bit ashamed at his lack of restraint.  After he was done, Tony unfolded the old blue jeans he brought with him.  He had to roll up the ends to accommodate his shorter height.  His boots also fit him a bit big.  He opened the door and walked towards the lobby. <br />
<br />
“Hey there champ.”  His lawyer greeted.  “Don’t worry about the fit, you’ve got plenty of time to shop for better clothing.” <br />
<br />
Tony once again nodded.  He didn’t want to think about what he just did in the procedure room...<br />
<br />
 ******<br />
<br />
“What do you mean I won’t be returning to school?” Skyler asked his father.<br />
<br />
“I’m afraid that you’re going to start being homeschooled by a private tutor.  We’re limiting your outside interactions.  I’m hoping on keeping a low profile for a bit and making sure your home will help with that.”<br />
<br />
Howard looked at the boy that stood before him in ill fitting clothes.  He couldn’t believe his son was in there. <br />
<br />
“Looks like you’ll be needing new clothes as well, but for now I guess you can just wear some “shorts” or something until your old enough to work.  You’re only going to be at home for awhile.<br />
<br />
Skyler looked confused by his father’s statement. “Wait ‘work?’ You mean you’re not-“<br />
<br />
“When the court ruled for your assets to be frozen, that meant all I can provide you with is food, shelter, and water.  The useless lawyer I hired at least got the judge to agree to letting me pay for homeschooling.  Clothing is apparently something I can’t provide.  You’ll have to work for new clothes that actually fit that body you got yourself stuck in.”<br />
<br />
Skyler looked down at his, no, Tony’s body.  The ends on his pants were a few inches higher that his ankles.  His shirt was so small that it made it look like he was wearing a sort of crop top.  His new treasure trail was very visible.<br />
<br />
“Those Hispanic’s probably grow faster so they can start doing physical labor at an early age, you’ll be fine.  You just need to fit the role your new body has assigned to you.”</p>
