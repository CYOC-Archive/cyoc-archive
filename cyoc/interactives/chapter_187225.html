<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, please first understand that we were so pressed for time with how critical of a condition you were in. The only possible donor close enough was the large squid from the aquarium next door. Coincidentally, she had just passed and was still fresh enough for us to be able to transplant many of her organs into you. However, as I am sure you know, this was highly experimental. And as such, we had to put more of her into you than we possibly could have needed. This is a world first, so please spare us if any future complications arise. We will do our best to accommodate you for them as well.&quot; <br />
<br />
The Surgeon seemed to be a very sincere and skilled person, and this doctor is friendly enough too, so you are able to relax a bit. &quot;Hey Doc, mind if I ask you something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am here to answer all of your questions, and I am sure you have pleanty of them, so ask away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You kept saying <i>she</i> when talking about the squid, will that be an issue?&quot;<br />
<br />
The doctor grimaces briefly and takes a nearby chair over to the side of you and sits with the back in front of him so he can lean forwards on it. &quot;Listen, about that. Unfortunately due to how severe your body was mangled... well, not all of you was able to be replaced. I am terribly sorry, but we couldn&#39;t save it and had to remove it or risk it getting infected.&quot;<br />
<br />
You feel a big let down as you suddenly become fully aware of the lack of your cock and balls between your legs. &quot;But, there is more. And maybe, this will be somewhat of a silver lining for you. I took the liberty when I transplanted the squids intestins into you, to include it&#39;s reproductive organs too. There is just one crucial issue you must be made aware of. Your digestive system is now completely reversed, and now you are restricted to the diet of a squid, mainly raw fish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean by reversed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, in order to fit it all into you, we had to convert your crotch into the mouth, or rather, beak. You still expel waste, just now out of your human mouth, and you urinate through that same hole too. We sealed up your anus as well, as it is now obsolete.<br />
<br />
One thing you need to remember is that Squid have a cloaca, which you now have too. Your mouth is your cloaca, functionally speaking wise. We also transferred your sense of taste and smell down to your new beak for your benefit. Your nose and human tongue are now decorative for the most part. And your tongue can still help you with speaking. That said, you can speak through your beak too. Finally, you can fully breath underwater and even thrive while in salt water. You will notice that closeable gills are lining the sides of your torso. Just keep them open if you want to breath in water. Or you can also just continue to breath normal air like the rest of humanity if you close them up. Its completely the best of both worlds kind of deal for your respiratory system at least, ha ha. Sorry, I know this is going to be a massive change for you, but we will help you the full time you are here, and even then after you leave the hospital.&quot;<br />
<br />
You just sit their taking in all of what you just heard. You feel a bit sick about what happened to you, but in the end, at least you were still alive. You by all rights should be in your grave right now, but they managed to save your life, even if in a rather unorthodox manner. &quot;Thanks, I guess. It will be quite an adjustment, but at least I am still alive, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am relieved that you are choosing to think about this positively. Yes you are alive, better than just alive even. You should make a full recovery in a manner of speaking. Please do keep this one last bit in mind. The squid we used was female, meaning you now are carrying her female parts inside of you. We will monitor your body chemistry, but you might start having some unfamiliar urges or thoughts. After all, you are more female than male at this point. Just let us know if something unusual starts happening, alright? Oh, and watch your fingers when feeding yourself, your beak is quite sharp. I will leave you to yourself. I image you are curious to see your new appearance. That button on the table will turn the ceiling into a mirror for you. Just don&#39;t leave the bed yet. Your still not fully able to support your full weight for that long. So without someone here to help you if you do fall, stay in the bed.&quot; The doctor then got up and left the room, closing the door behind him.<br />
<br />
You certainly are curious. So you press the button and pull off the covers. You then slowly pull back the hospital gown so that you can see your new beak. What you see is just a small white shelf-life protrusion from your body. It does slightly look like it is comming out of a pussy though. It sticks out about 3 inches, and is about 4 inches in diameter 2 small holes are near the top of your new opening, likely for your new &quot;nose&quot;. You try opening it, and it does. Inside of it, you find that it also has it&#39;s own tongue, only this one is thin, and can stick quite a ways out. <br />
<br />
It could be far worse than this. This is actually not as bad as you thought. As you examine you legs, you notice that they are completely hairless and smooth looking. Your feet are smaller too. Well, what could you expect after such extensive surgery? At least there is virtually zero scaring anywhere. <br />
<br />
In order to fit your beak, your hops have also been widened. So now there is a pretty big difference between the width of your hips and the width of your abdomen. Of course you have no defined muscles anymore, but those will surely come back with time. <br />
<br />
Your chest also is now featureless as well as hairless. You poke your left pectoral in disappointment. For some reason, doing that makes your mouth start to water. You poke the other side, and you almost begin to drool. And actually, you realize that softly poking them even feels kind of good too. Your fingers, which now also are smaller, begin playing with your chest and other parts of your body. But no where else feels as good, except maybe for your ass, which was kind of odd. <br />
<br />
You finally looked up and were shocked to see what you could only assume is you reflecting back. You were a bit unsure at first because your facial features are more like those of a woman than a man. If you let your hair grow out, and add some light makeup, no one would ever assume you were male. Then it clicks. This isn&#39;t your atrophied and post extensive surgery body at all. It is just a normal woman&#39;s body, which you were just put inside of! <br />
<br />
Now it all made sense. Your sizes are feminine, not modified. Your voice is that of a woman&#39;s, not just recovering from surgery like you thought. No wonder your beak looks like it is in a pussy. It actually is, your pussy. Which means that you were playing with your small breasts. The doctor did day you were much more female than male now, but you didn&#39;t expect to this extent. <br />
<br />
A bit of drool drips down your lips, and you wipe it off, noticing that it is much more slimy and gooey than usual. &#39;Oh, this isn&#39;t normal drool... right&#39;. You remember than you mouth is essentially your new pussy, meaning this is just you essentially being horny. You sigh and lay backwards, carefully licking your finger clean with your new tongue. It didn&#39;t taste that bad either.</p>
