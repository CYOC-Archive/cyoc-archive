<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;That was a great dinner Mrs. Lawson. I don&#39;t think I can eat another bite,&quot; said Frieda Knight, while pushing her plate away.<br />
She was sitting with Evan, Maggie, and Spencer Lawson. The four of them all proudly displaying their fursonas, since it was just them in the privacy of the Lawson&#39;s house, with the Code W* still in full effect for Moon Lake.<br />
&quot;Thank you Frieda, but if you&#39;re going to be part of our family, it&#39;s Maggie, and my husband&#39;s Evan,&quot; replied Spencer&#39;s mom, as her mate got up to start collecting the dishes.<br />
&quot;Well, between my feelings for Spencer, as well as Eric, everyone&#39;s parents have needed some time to get used to our unique arrangement. But I do appreciate your friendship and support. It&#39;s not everyone who would accept their child being part of a menage a trois,&quot; Frieda pointed out, before giving the black furred werewolf-cat-panthress mix sitting next to her a kiss on the muzzle.<br />
&quot;As long as the three of you are happy and never hurt each other physically or emotionally, this bi-were mix has no room to complain,&quot; said Maggie, sitting across from the teenagers at the dinner table, next to her husband.<br />
It was hard not to notice Maggie was barely able to suppress a yawn.<br />
&quot;You doing okay mom?&quot; asked her daughter Spencer, noting how tired she seemed.<br />
&quot;Your brother has a schedule all his own right now,&quot; replied Mrs. Lawson, referring to her newborn child upstairs. &quot;I&#39;ve just about got my strength back from giving birth, but the endless feedings...&quot;<br />
And then, as if on cue, the baby monitor sitting on the table between Spencer&#39;s parents started broadcasting the whine of a just awakened infant.<br />
&quot;Diaper or hunger?&quot; wondered Evan Lawson, coming up behind his wife to hug Maggie.<br />
&quot;Sounds like both to me,&quot; she answered, while grabbing the monitor.<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you two go on upstairs, and we&#39;ll take care of things down here,&quot; offered Frieda, before Spencer could speak.<br />
&quot;You two don&#39;t mind?&quot; asked Maggie, as she got up.<br />
&quot;No mom. You two go on. We&#39;ve got it,&quot; said Spencer, as she started to rise from her chair.<br />
&quot;Okay. Thanks. Now you two don&#39;t do anything we wouldn&#39;t,&quot; said Evan, as the pure blooded werewolf took his wife&#39;s paw in his.<br />
&quot;And if you need a ride home Frieda, just ask,&quot; added Maggie, as the werecat-panthress mix smiled.<br />
&quot;No problem,&quot; said Frieda, as a smile crossed the gray furred werepanthress&#39; muzzle.<br />
With that, the adults went on upstairs to the nursery, leaving the two teenagers alone.<br />
<br />
Frieda and Spencer started collecting the rest of everything and taking it to the kitchen.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re parents are so cool,&quot; Frieda said to her girlfriend, as they started cleaning up.<br />
&quot;Your parents aren&#39;t that bad,&quot; Spencer said, as they started rinsing plates to put in the dishwasher.<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; conceded Frieda. &quot;My father&#39;s starting to come around, to a point. But you&#39;ve always had a mom and dad, while I...&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey. We make the most of what we have,&quot; Spencer told Frieda, while nudging her.<br />
Frieda smiled and enjoyed the moment of her girlfriend&#39;s black fur against her own gray pelt.<br />
&quot;I haven&#39;t always been the ideal daughter my folks were hoping for either,&quot; Spencer reminded her.<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; agreed Frieda, &quot;but in hindsight, our past contributes to our present, and as far as you&#39;re concerned Spencer Lawson, I love you just the way you are,&quot; she said with a smile.<br />
&quot;And there&#39;s no doubt in my mind or heart how I feel about you either Frieda,&quot; said Spencer, before initiating a kiss.<br />
The two ladies stopped and embraced. Their respective tails twitching in pleasure as they wrapped their furry arms around each other.<br />
Then, Frieda reluctantly broke the kiss and said, &quot;We still have to finish the housework Mrs. Knight,&quot; referring to the fact that they already had their were-wedding, and were married at least as far as nature was concerned.<br />
&quot;Then we better hurry up Mrs. Lawson, because I can&#39;t wait to have dessert,&quot; said Spencer, while winking at her girlfriend, lover, mate. Despite what the legal laws of the land would say on the subject, both ladies considered themselves the other&#39;s wife, as well as Mrs. Eric Anderson. Eric considered himself husband to both of them, and the threesome wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.<br />
&quot;I wonder what Eric would say if he was here,&quot; said Frieda, referring to the white furred werepanther that completed their group.<br />
&quot;Tonight is just for us ladies. Besides, he&#39;ll have plenty in the future to look forward to,&quot; Spencer reminded her.<br />
&quot;From both of us,&quot; Frieda added, before they resumed cleaning up from dinner.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE, UPSTAIRS...<br />
&quot;Oh... Evan...&quot; said Maggie, between a purr and a moan. &quot;Keep that up darling.&quot;<br />
They were sitting together in bed. She with her back against his furry chest as Evan&#39;s hands were in constant motion, alternating between massaging her shoulders and back while helping to milk her breasts as their newborn son laid in Maggie&#39;s furry arms and continued to suckle at his mother&#39;s teat.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still not up to full on intercourse yet,&quot; complained Maggie, &quot;but I&#39;ll certainly make it worth your while orally later,&quot; she added, moving against him just long enough to confirm the existence of a hardened penis pressing against her lower spine.<br />
&quot;Anything for you, my love,&quot; said Evan gently, as he started nuzzling her neck.<br />
<br />
BACK DOWNSTAIRS...<br />
The two girls had finished cleaning up, dried their paws, and retired back to the living room to cuddle together on the sofa.<br />
&quot;When I stop to think of everything we&#39;ve all been through since Eric&#39;s family came to Moon Lake and mine moved back here,&quot; began Spencer, recalling their adventurous past.**<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; said Frieda, nuzzling her furry body against Spencer&#39;s, even as one paw caressed her lover&#39;s luscious curves. &quot;To think, if Julie Stovall had her way...***&quot;<br />
&quot;No. We&#39;re not discussing that,&quot; said Spencer, before kissing Frieda. &quot;We&#39;re here. The three of us have a bright future together, and the only thing I want right now is you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then allow me Yin,&quot; said Frieda, using her pet name for Spencer. &quot;Yang may not be physically with us tonight, but Eric will soon feel what we&#39;re up to through our special emphatic link, and with you two in my heart, I&#39;m always Whole.&quot;<br />
With that, Frieda started kissing her way down from Spencer&#39;s muzzle and neck until she reached her female companion&#39;s breasts.<br />
A long series of kisses and tongue licks encircled both breasts before Frieda zeroed in on just one, paying special attention to the hardened nipple before she started suckling on it.<br />
But Frieda&#39;s paws weren&#39;t idle. One was rubbing its way along Spencer&#39;s back, down to the base of her tail to play with it and Spencer&#39;s rear.<br />
Frieda&#39;s other paw went directly to the quivering lips of her mate&#39;s vagina, gently teasing tender flesh with goosebumps and promises of more pleasures to come.<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before a talented tongue was applied to Spencer&#39;s outer cunt lips, as Frieda kissed her way downward, only pausing just long enough to lick around the outside of Spencer&#39;s belly button as a hint of what lied ahead.<br />
<br />
Spencer started moaning in pure pleasure, her tail wagging with each stroke of Frieda&#39;s tongue.<br />
The Lawson lass felt her vagina growing wetter with every passing moment as Spencer raised her hips upward to meet Frieda&#39;s muzzle and encourage her to continue.<br />
Frieda simply hummed as she continued licking, now pausing every so often to tease Spencer&#39;s now unhidden clit. A lick here, a short exhale of hot breath, or even a brief kiss as Frieda started drinking deeper from her mate&#39;s wet chalice, Frieda&#39;s hunger for more of Spencer&#39;s delicious female cream growing with every passing second.<br />
&quot;MORE!&quot; Spencer moaned, encouraging her girlfriend to continue, even as her paws started playing with Frieda&#39;s ears and attempted to push the werepanthress&#39; muzzle deeper into her cunt.<br />
Frieda needed no encouragement, the urge to bring Spencer to climax just as frantic as Spencer&#39;s need to experience orgasmic bliss.<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before both girls got what they wanted.<br />
Spencer came and came, her whole body shaking in sexual pleasure.<br />
Frieda drank even more of the free flowing female cream as her body shook in echoes of the emphatic link they share giving her not only the sensation of Spencer&#39;s orgasm, but triggering one of her own.<br />
<br />
Spent, for the moment, Frieda crawled back up to look deep into Spencer&#39;s eyes.<br />
She moved in for another kiss and as their lips met, Spencer got to taste her own cream straight from Frieda&#39;s mouth.<br />
Their tongues danced between each other&#39;s muzzles, until Frieda just decided to lay and cuddle within Spencer&#39;s arms once more.<br />
&quot;I love you,&quot; Frieda whispered in Spencer&#39;s ear.<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Spencer whispered back. &quot;And as soon as I&#39;m able to, I&#39;ll show you how much I love you too.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m ready, willing, and looking forward to it!&quot; Frieda said with a smile, before kissing Spencer again.<br />
