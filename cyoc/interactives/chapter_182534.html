<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The door to the living room opens and “Zoran” enters, “hey mom, hey dad,” he says, acting the part as he puts down his bag.<br />
<br />
“Hey buddy,” Don says, “how was your sleepover?”<br />
<br />
“Zoran” smiles, “it was FANTASTIC,” he says, “we had lots of fun playing video games, even though he beat me most of the time, but I had my chances to kick his bum also,” he continues with a grin.<br />
<br />
“Grace” smiles, “well, Mark is a pro game,” she says.<br />
<br />
Don raises an eyebrow, “how do you know?”<br />
<br />
“Grace” gulps, “um... I saw the boys play a few times together,” she says.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, mom always bugs when friends are over,” “Zoran” adds quickly, “so she has often seen Mark beating me.”<br />
<br />
“I see,” Don says, with that the topic drops, “I wonder when “miss princess” will return,” he then says.<br />
<br />
“Grace” chuckles, “you know her,” she says, “always taking her time.”<br />
<br />
“Zoran” looks at his “mom”, “mom, can I talk to you in private for a minute?”<br />
<br />
“Sure, let&#39;s go to your room,” she says, she looks over at Don.<br />
<br />
“You two are acting weird,” he says with a chuckle, “go ahead, I&#39;ll get the dinner ready,” he then says and heads into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Zoran” and “Grace” head into Zoran&#39;s room and lock the door, “Grace” sits down at the computer and starts it up, then turns to her “son”. “So... mom,” she starts, “how has your weekend as a teenager been?”<br />
<br />
“It was really amazing and cool,” “Zoran” says, “what about yours?”<br />
<br />
“It was great, but now I understand what you have to go through ever day with all of the house work... it is really tiring.”<br />
<br />
“Zoran” smiles, “I was thinking,” he then says, “I had so much fun with Marc and the others, that I&#39;d like to stay a teenager a little longer.” He looks up at his “mother”, “b-but only if it is okay with you, son.”<br />
<br />
“Grace” thinks for a while, “well, I don&#39;t know,” he says, “what if dad tries to get... you know,” she says with a blush.<br />
<br />
“Zoran” chuckles, “don&#39;t worry Zoran,” she says, “me and your dad hadn&#39;t have sex in ages. I am sure that he&#39;ll not suddenly start it up again, we are both to out of age. Besides, we don&#39;t want any more children,” she adds.<br />
<br />
Of course, “Zoran” has no idea of what had happened and “Grace” does not remember what had happened, because of Don deleting her memories that he and his “wife” had sex.<br />
<br />
“Grace” relaxes, “if that is so, then I&#39;d be happy to trade my life with yours for a little longer,” she says and turns to the computer, starting up the program. “How long would you like the swap to continue?”<br />
<br />
“I was thinking,” “Zoran” says, “instead of having a deadline, let&#39;s make it undefined and we&#39;ll just swap back when one of us is tired of the other&#39;s role?”<br />
<br />
Zoran/”Grace” thinks about it, then nods, “sure, let me change the timer,” she says. First she opens her stats and scrolls down, she stops the timer, which is ten minutes away from ending, and changes it to “permanent”. Then she opens up “Zoran&#39;s” stats and does the same to “his” profile, “it is done,” she then says and closes the program, after adding a password, &#39;that way only the real “Zoran” can access the program,&#39; she thinks to herself.<br />
<br />
“Zoran” walks up to his “mother” and gives her a big hug, “thanks Zoran,” he says, “I promise that after this is over, I owe you big time,” she smiles up at her body.<br />
<br />
“Grace” smiles down at her “son”, “my pleasure, mom,” she says, “but you don&#39;t have to repay me,” she says. They break the hug, “let&#39;s head down and see what your “dad” has cooked for us,” with that they head downstairs.<br />
<br />
As they walk down the stairs, the front door opens and Zoran&#39;s older sister “Jane” enters the house. “It is about time,” “Grace” says, “why do you always do this?”<br />
<br />
The 18-year-old girl looks at her “mother”, “mom, I am 18... I can stay away as long as I want,” she says, “stop treating me like a child.”<br />
<br />
“Girls, stop fighting,” they hear Don&#39;s voice from the kitchen, “Jane is right, she is old enough. You really should stop treating her as if she were still underage.”<br />
<br />
“Grace” sighs, “you are right,” she says, “sorry Jane, it is just... I get worried, I know you can look after yourself. I guess it is just that we mom&#39;s are over protective when it comes to their kids.”<br />
<br />
“I understand mom,” Jane says, “but it is really frustrating,” she says.<br />
<br />
“I promise to stop from now on,” Grace says.<br />
<br />
Jane smiles, “good, now let&#39;s eat, I am starving.”<br />
<br />
As they sit at the table, eating their meal, Don scans Jane and “Zoran” without them and “Grace” noticing. “Grace” is watching her “son” as he argues with his sister, &#39;damn... mom has it down to a “T”. If I&#39;d not know that me and mom have swapped bodies, even I would be fooled.&#39; The “woman” then raises her voice, “kids, will you two please stop fighting?”<br />
<br />
“Zoran” and Jane look at her, “Zoran started it,” Jane says.<br />
<br />
“NOT TRUE,” the “boy” shouts, “YOU are the one that started.<br />
<br />
“ENOUGH,” “Grace” shouts, “if you don&#39;t stop, BOTH of you will be grounded for... four weeks!”<br />
<br />
The threat works and both teens fall silent, lowering their heads as they continue eating, “Zoran” turns his head to his “mother” and smiles with a wink, mouthing “good job”. “Grace” smiles back and mouths a “thanks”.<br />
<br />
Don finishes his meal first, “I need to check some E-Mails,” he says as he stands up from the table. <br />
<br />
“Honey, why do you always have to wolf down your food,” his “wife” asks, “it is not healthy.”<br />
<br />
“Zoran” nods, “yeah dad... why can&#39;t you just enjoy the food for ounce?”<br />
<br />
Don chuckles, “sorry... it just tasted so damn good,” he says with a grin, rubbing the back of his head, “I promise to try next time to eat slower.”<br />
<br />
Jane, “Zoran” and “Grace” all roll their eyes and groan, “we heard that hundreds of times,” they say.<br />
<br />
“Hahaha,” Don laughs, “I love you guys too,” he says. The man goes to grab his plate but it stoped by “Grace”.<br />
<br />
“Honey, don&#39;t bother,” she says, “I&#39;ll take care of clearing up.”<br />
<br />
Don smiles and heads upstairs to the office, but instead of checking E-Mails he takes out his phone and opens the app. “Let&#39;s make a few changes,” he says, he pulls up his profile, he scanned himself in the morning. He starts to edit his stats, first he sets his age from 40 to 30, then he changes his body, giving himself some nice abs. After saving the changes he opens the profile of his “wife” and changes her percentage of lust from 10% to 60% and the percentage of fertility from 5% to 100%. He switches her awareness of his changes off, also he adjusts the change he had done to her, so that she finds it normal to &quot;feel&quot; that way, then he opens the profile of “Zoran” and Jane, for now he only turns off their awareness, so that they do not notice his change, then he hits confirm.</p>
