<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After clicking the submit button, the first thing he noticed was that the computer monitor was slightly lower than he was accustomed to it being. The second thing he noticed was his clothes were too tight, almost painfully so. He rose from the chair, slightly disorientated at how everything now seemed to be slightly out of place. In the mirror placed on the other side of the room the avatar of himself which he had shaped with such care on the monitor had sprung to life, was now him. He raised his hand up to touch at his adonic face, only for his shirt to tear up open in several places, sun bronzed muscle spilling out.<br />
<br />
He shucked off the tattered remains of the shirt, undid his belt and stripped his trousers and too tight underwear off, piling the ruined clothes into a little pile for disposal later. He ran his hands over his sculpted chest, thumb slightly catching on each groove in his eight pack. He knew he stood at the apex of masculine beauty and that few people, if anyone, would be able to resist his allure. He was everything Chris wanted.<br />
<br />
The thought of Chris caused his penis to leap to attention. If THIS was what the Chronivac could do to him, what could it do for Chris. Making himself perfect was one thing, but designing the perfect partner? Quite another. Daren sat back down at the computer, readjusting the chair to accommodate his new height and saw a flashing message on screen.<br />
<br />
&quot;FIRST TIME USER: Congratulations on making your first set of changes using the Chronivac. Default settings ensure that only you are aware of the changes which have occurred, everyone else will presume the changes made have been your de-facto form. Would you like to remove your own awareness or designate another program subject as exempt?&quot;<br />
<br />
He could see why some people would make the changes and then make themselves forget they had been anything else other than the paragons of perfection the Chronivac allowed them to become, but he wanted to remember. He needed to remember, to fully savour what he had been given. And, after a moment&#39;s thought, he realised he needed Chris to remember too. Despite all the changes he was still, at his very core, himself. He loved Chris dearly but Chris was in many ways an overgrown child. Spoiled, attention-seeking, needy and a little whingey too. The Chronivac would allow him to take his boyfriend firmly in hand, and to keep him there. A few clicks ensured Chris would remember how things used to be, but only he and Daren would do so.  <br />
<br />
He expanded the window with Chris&#39;s settings. Finally, he was ready to begin reshaping his boyfriend. Chris looked younger than his twenty five years. He was only five foot six, and had the build and face of a twink despite his age. Daren reasoned it was because of his heritage, German on his mother&#39;s side while his father was Japanese. Daren had met Chris&#39;s parents and had noticed that they were both on the small side, and that Chris had inherited this trait. He&#39;d lucked out though in that his facial features had achieved that highly attractive blending of east asian and european traits that left him looking very pretty, almost feminine, and which made him look younger than he was. Chris hated his neotenous features as he grew older, complaining it made him look like a perpetual thirteen year old. Daren had always reassured him that it wasn&#39;t the case, but every time Chris had talked like that he&#39;d have to excuse himself soon afterwards to rub one out.<br />
<br />
The age slider was at twenty five. He wouldn&#39;t be leaving it there, but he wanted to see if he could make a perfect baseline. He needed a goal though, a perfect ideal to reshape Chris towards. He drew out another cigar from the pack on his desk, lit it, took a long exhale, leaned back in his seat and began thinking. He didn&#39;t want to make Chris another human adonis, that didn&#39;t appeal to Daren. He wanted someone he could bend over his knee and intimidate. That suggested a twink, the sort you could find any on any decent gay porn site on the internet but he dismissed that as being just a little too common. He was the perfect alpha male, he needed the perfect partner. <br />
<br />
And then he had it. The dewey skinned, wide eyed, luscious lipped starlets of K-pop and J-pop. He would reshape Chris into his own personal flowerboy. With the image in mind, he began altering Chris&#39;s features. The skin tone was set to be as pale as milk, his complexion blemish free with all the niggling little spots, imperfections and tiny scars removed. The body type he set to be an extreme ectomorph and what muscle tone Chris had melted away. The results were disappointingly gangly, all bones and angles, so Daren spent some time adjusting it. The result was a pleasingly lithe body with a lean, tight musculature. Daren also gave Chris a high level of physical flexibility.<br />
He removed the body hair from Chris in all places save in his pubic region and the top of his head. Facial hair was right now, his boy wouldn&#39;t have any.<br />
<br />
When Daren came to Chris&#39;s face, he again ensured he kept it recognisably Chris. Chris was already a very pretty man, so it didn&#39;t take many alterations or adjustments to elevate his features to the sort of image that would have had little girls squealing themselves with excitement upon seeing his visage. A narrowing of the chin, a lengtheing of the eyelashes, a filling out of the eyebrows, a softening of the cheekbones, a widening of the eyes.  His hair he lengthened, with huge bangs draped across his face and long silken tresses spilling onto his shoulders. The black colour had to go though, Daren wanted to have a contrast with his own curly locks, and so he chose to set Chris to have hair the colour of a soft rose.<br />
<br />
As he had proceeded with the alterations, his free hand had strayed to his lap to wrap around his growing dick. Clear sticky pre-cum oozed out around his fist. But his newfound iron self control kicked in, he would not allow himself to experience release quite yet.<br />
<br />
He moved into the mental section of the Chronivac after satisfying himself with almost all the physical changes. An idea had formed in his head over how he could use the Chronivac to advance themselves in life. He maxxed out Chris&#39;s capacity to learn and then opened the talent sub-menu. He&#39;d ignored this himself, planning to go back to it later once he figured what he&#39;d like to have a talent in, but he knew what he wanted for Chris. He added in &#39;dancing&#39; and &#39;singing&#39;.<br />
<br />
Finally, it came to personality. Several of the traits here had been grayed out on his own menu related to submissive character traits that did not mesh with his chosen personality. He wanted to enjoy Chris as a partner, and had specified that he would most get enjoyment out of inflicting humiliation. Daren made alterations that ensured Chris would gain the most sexual fulfilment from being humiliated, but that he would instinctively lash out against it as well. His defiance levels were also raised. Chris was going to be a headstrong brat, but Daren was going to enjoy taming him. His charisma was maxxed out, it was an essential component of Daren&#39;s new scheme.<br />
<br />
The sexuality meter had Chris as 100% homosexual. Daren decided to change it to 100% Daren Adamos. He had no intention of sharing his little flowerboy with anyone and didn&#39;t want to take any risks when he was back was turned.<br />
<br />
Finally, almost everything was ready. He returned to the physical statistics, and to the age slider. He would take Chris in hand. He dragged the slider to the left, seeing the age meter tick down and keeping a close eye on the avatar to ensure no imperfections emerged as Chris&#39;s body was dragged back through time. There were little enough changes for the first few years, though he noticed that what passed for Chris&#39;s musculature retreated and the sheen and softness of his skin grew more intense. But the drop from eighteen to sixteen produced a stunning result, as Chris hit five foot one and became almost impossibly slim. He wasn&#39;t gangly or awkward as many teens at that age were, but was akin to a lean, supple willow. If Daren was now the perfect example of masculine beauty, then Chris would become the apex of what a feminine male would be.<br />
<br />
Daren&#39;s mouth was dry at the image in front of him. He checked the box that would preserve Chris at this age, moved the cursor down to the &#39;apply changes&#39; button...and he clicked submit.</p>
