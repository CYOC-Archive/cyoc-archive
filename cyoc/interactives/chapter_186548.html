<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dou-Wan realized that it was simply not possible to clean the cum off him with his shirt, the stain would be too apparent. He then realized he was unable to enter the other stalls after he heard some guys enter the restroom as well. &quot;Guess I just better text Chong-Hui&quot; Dou-Wan thought as he grabbed his phone from his pocket and messaged him to bring him his hoodie. Since his brother Hussein was in class, he knew that Chong-Hui was his only option but it did make him feel embarrassed asking the guy he was just jerking off to to bring him his hoodie. After. a few minutes the guys left the bathroom and Dou-Wan heard the sound of the door reopening before a voice began speaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dou-Wan? Where are you?&quot; Chong-Hui asked, his voice booming through the empty restroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m right here. Could you give me your hoodie now please?&quot; Dou-Wan said as he stuck his hand under the stall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. But why did you need to borrow my hoodie?&quot; Chong-Hui asked him as he gave Dou-Wan the hoodie.<br />
<br />
Dou-Wan grabbed the hoodie and placed it over his arm he began to use his shirt to clean off the cum that had landed on his glasses and anywhere else on his body. Luckily his cum had only fallen on his shirt and glasses so as long as Dou-Wan wore Chong-Hui&#39;s hoodie it would hide his cumstains. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry. I spilled some water over my entire shirt and i just wanted to hide the stain.&quot; Dou-Wan lied as he put the hoodie on and stepped out of the stall. Dou-Wan could tell the hoodie was a bit too big, but luckily it didn&#39;t appear too baggy, He noticed Chong-Hui staring at him concerned. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Dou-Wan asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know but don&#39;t you seem a little different? Like weren&#39;t you white... no black before?&quot; Chong-Hui asked him. Dou-Wan looked at him confused. All his life he had always been Chinese. He remembered how as he grew up with his adoptive brother Hussein and that they never found their different ethnicities odd and were even raised as twin brother due to them both being the same age. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nope. I&#39;ve always been Chinese. Anyways, I have to get back to class before the lecture ends.&quot; Dou-Wan said a bit shocked at Chong-Hui&#39;s question. He didn&#39;t know why but he had been acting strange for the past few days. &quot;See you at lunch.&quot; Dou-Wan told him as he left the restroom. Dou-Wan quickly returned to class and after the lecture ended he headed to the dining hall. He found Chong-Hui waiting for him in front of the entrance doors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry I was a little late. I had to make sure I had all my notes together&quot; Dou-Wan told him as they entered the dining hall. As promised, Dou-Wan payed for both their meals and as they sat down, Dou-Wan noticed Hussein walking over to them. &quot;Hey, bro. Mind joining us for lunch?&quot; Dou-Wan asked him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. But I just finished eating.&quot; Hussein said pulling the chair next to Dou-Wan and sitting down. <br />
<br />
Chong-Hui looked at Hussein a bit uneasy, he had wanted to speak to Dou-Wan alone, but perhaps this wasn&#39;t too unrelated to Hussein after all. &quot;Ok. Guys have you notice that things have been changing?&quot; Chong-Hui asked them. The brothers looked at one another but shook their heads in disagreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything seems the same to me.&quot; Hussein said stroking his black beard. Chong-Hui could tell that there was something clearly wrong with Hussein having a beard but he wasn&#39;t sure what. Instead he simply chose to continue the topic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen. When I woke up this morning, I was looking at the syllabus for Dr. Martinez&#39;s class and I had written my name as Charlie on it&quot;. As soon as Chong-Hui finished, the three students felt an immense pain in their heads. Something about what Chong-Hui had just said had caused them to feel a strange sensation in their heads. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the hell was that?&quot; Dou-Wan said rubbing his head. Something about the fact Chong-Hui had written his name as Charlie had hurt his head but he wasn&#39;t sure why. It felt as if something was wrong and it wasn&#39;t Chong-Hui writing his name as Charlie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know but the thing is if my name clearly isn&#39;t Charlie why would I write that?&quot; Chong Hui said. The brothers both agreed with him. &quot;That&#39;s why I wanted to see your syllabus. I want to see if what I&#39;m thinking is true&quot;. Chong-Hui said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry but they&#39;re at our house. Why not go with us to get them?&quot; Dou-Wan said as he looked at his food strangely. He had only gotten a salad, some fish, and other side dishes. Although the food didn&#39;t feel right to Dou-Wan he had lost his appetite anyway. &quot;Would you mind if we go now?&quot; Dou-Wan asked Chong-Hui.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I think I&#39;m too anxious to eat&quot; Chong-Hui said and the three of them walked out of the dining hall and towards Dou-Wan&#39;s and Hussein&#39;s house. They entered their house and the brothers grabbed their syllabus to see they had written Drake and Dakota on them. &quot;Just as I thought&quot; Chong-Hui asked as he looked at them while clutching his forehead. The strange sensation had returned again but it wasn&#39;t as intense as before.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot; Hussein asked him while massaging his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;This may sound crazy but I think we&#39;ve all been changed.&quot; Chong-Hui said gripping the syllabuses and staring at the brothers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait... you mean as in like we became new people&quot; Dou-Wan said confused as he took his glasses off and rubbed his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. And I think it has to do with Dr. Martinez&#39;s class&quot; Chong-Hui responded as he took his phone out.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Hussein asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to go to Dr. Martinez&#39;s office hours. I think he may know what&#39;s happening to us.&quot; Chong-Hui asked as he searched Dr. Martinez&#39;s office hours and found them. &quot;Good. It looks like he has still has Office Hours for another hour. Let&#39;s go confront him.&quot; Chong-Hui said. The brothers and Chong-Hui then took their syllabuses and walked back to campus before reaching Dr. Martinez&#39;s office. <br />
<br />
Dr. Martinez signaled them inside and they entered. &quot;Now I certainly didn&#39;t expect all three of you to appear. Do you need something?&quot; He asked them<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. We want to know if you know why suddenly turned into different people?&quot; Duo-Wan asked him.<br />
<br />
Dr. Martinez then replied...</p>
