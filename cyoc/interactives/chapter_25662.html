<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The broken wall parts return to sand from which they came, the prince would have to fix 
that later after he got ride of his unwanted guest. His harem stood happily out of the way 
as they cheered their master on, wondering which of them would be first for him to enjoy 
when he celebrated his victory.  <P> 
Re-grabbing his sword, Karther dig it into the stone yet carpeted floor, and double kicked 
the jewish man in the face twice with his feet, then again and again with his many tails. 
The force knocked the jewish man on his back and Karther looking over his with his sword 
pointed at his nose. 
"Stupid Angel. Did you really think you could beat the prince of the nine tailed foxes?" <P> 
"You really think you're going to be allowed to keep all your precious prizes? You were 
allowed to have your real-estate back because no one else wanted it. Kidnapping people 
and reshaping them into what you want? You really think They will let that stand?"  <P>
"It's no different from what any god does to their converts."  <P> 
"You are no god." <P>
"Perhaps, but the people I have brought here, and remade in my image and given parts to 
play in my tale, those lives are now real as they live them, while their previous lives are 
not. To revert them all, would be to do the same as I did in the first place."  <P>
"You -really- think They will accept that justification?" <P>
"They only need to accept it long enough for me to become recognized as a legitimate 
power again in this world, and to remove me would cause more damage than repair." <P>
"You think too little of how humans have evolved since the old days." <P>
"They're still just naked apes blindly bumping into things. Good-bye." Karther slashed 
horizontally with his weapon. A bang rang through the bed room, Karther surprised and 
injured still managed to dodge the second shot, now bleeding on both sides, with an entry 
and exit wound. "How?" <P>
The Jewish man held a smoking service revolver. "You have plenty of defenses against 
magical attacks, but against something like a bullet? The thought never even crossed your 
mind did it?" <P>
The vixens were shocked, their, their master was taken by surprise? How awful! This guest 
was not nice at all! <P>
"You forget." The prince hissed. "Everything and everyone here is part of my story, my 
domain, and exists how I, see, -fit-! <P> The moment Karther was to will the floor to 
reshape into a spiked pit (he figure out where to put the dinning hall on the floor below 
later), he felt a very, very, intense pain, -down there.- <P>
He fell on his back, holding the bruised part. <P>
The jewish man got up, "Here's a piece of advice, being the biggest isn't always better, and 
serious? Leaving something like that out in the opening during a fight? You were asking 
for it to get hit!" <P>
Karther hissed. "I would know the name of the Angel that beat me." <P>
"My name is T-" <P>
"Get'im!" Instantly the harem clothes vanished into sand, and reshaped into armor and 
weapons for the nine amazons fox weapon suddenly no longer simple pleasure toys but 
now defenders of their master. This left the Angel Whose Name Starts with T in a larger 
problem, he couldn't de-brainwash them with them coming at him ready to kill. And he 
couldn't very well kill them, they were innocent people having been made into what 
Karther wanted them to be. He willed his sword back into his hand and held it with the flat 
side facing. No one said this job was easy. <P>
"And I think." Karther said as he moved away limping, "That I'll take one of those two 
runaways you damaged, and remodel her into my queen and her companion into 
something entertaining! Just so you know you have done nothing but caused misery by 
being here." <P>
The Angel Whose Name Starts With T just sighed. He didn't have time to shout back at 
Karther's over sized threats. He had nine furry amazons to face off against without killing 
them at the moment. <P> 

+++++ <P> 

On the bright side, at least these two male foxes wore loin clothes under their scimitar 
belts. So the changed vixens weren't as distracted as they could have been. The more the 
four foxes continued their game of chase through the palace, the two ladies got the 
feeling more and more of being in a fairy tale arabian palace. Thou, it felt, incomplete, 
there were hallways to nothing but several stories up in mid-air, and a wide desert just 
past midnight a huge pale moon. <P>
"Stop in the name of our prince concubines!" The two male guards said at once, two furry 
ears poking out of their turbans, the only clothing they had besides their cloths and 
weapon belts. <P>
The vixens felt like they were almost running in circles, there seemed to be no place for 
them to go. They had also seen a handful of other foxes, male and female, but mostly 
female. This fox was as big a pervert as first impressions suggested. Few of the other 
foxes really seemed to notice them, and those that did quickly darted out of the way in 
surprise and confusion. 
The turned a corner then ducked in an alcove, the guards past them running onwards. 
<P>
Tammie breathed a sigh of relief. "That was scary J-J...Janice..." Tammie sounded very 
scared. "Can you remember what your real name was?"<P>
"Of course it's..." Alarm filled Janice's face. "Oh no... but how? I, I remember knowing our 
names, well, our real names when we met in that bed room. And I was under mind control 
then!" <P>
"Do I look like I know? At least we still have our free will and aren't acting like empty 
headed ditz like those other girls were. <P>
"Tammie, you just said 'those other girls' not 'those vixens' or 'other animal people' but 
'other girls.' " <P>
"We have our free will, and we know we don't belong here. That's what important!" <P>
"But Tammie! What if we forget more! Where we live? Our birthday! Our credit card 
numbers! I can't go around like this! People will think I'm a hooker!" Janice started to 
panic. <P>
"Janice! Do you realize what YOU just said?!" Tammie demanded. <P>
Janice looked on the verge of breaking down and crying, Tammie slapped her. <P>
"Huh?" Janice blinked if waking up from a nightmare. <P>
"Janice, I'm scared too! But we have each other, and as long as remember that there's more 
to us than this place, we can remember anything we forgot while here." <P>
"O-Okay." <P>
"Now let's try to find a way out of here." <P>
"To what? That desert? We'd freeze or fry!" <P>
"It might be better than staying here, but you're right, let's at least try to find some water 
to take with us first!" <P>
The vixens carefully left their little hiding place, and moving as stealthy as they could, 
found another exit that just led to desert, but they did see another part of the palace that 
was built some ways away connected to another part of the palace thou all it's hallways 
hadn't been connected yet. They also saw a well next to and a few jars. Having no other 
options, they crept out. In an instant the black leather clothes they were wearing turned 
into sand, and fell off them leaving them with just their fur in the chill desert air. Surprised 
and alarmed the two fell on their tails making a yelp! What distressed Tammie more 
however was that while their outfits had vanished, they were still vixens, not human, and 
still couldn't remember their male names. <P>
Fearing their noise making had alerted their pursuers where they were, the vixens ran into 
the small second of the palace with the jars in front of it to hide. They started when they 
found another vixen, this one look more like a stereo typical woman from an arabian 
fantasy, calmly cutting up some recently dead pig humming cheerful. She eyed and said, 
"Oh! The prince finally decided to give me some people to help me in my honored tasks? I 
so happy. Who are you?" <P>
"Er, I'm Tammie." <P>
"Janice." <P>
"It's a pleasure to meet you both." The vixen looking almost exactly the same as they were 
made a polite bow. "I am Alexsandra." She looked them up and down. "Thou, why did the 
prince leave you without garments?" <P>
"Er," Tammie said honestly, "We tried to make a short cut through the incomplete sections, 
and they sorte fell apart." <P> 
Alexsandra cocked her head. "Incomplete? Fell apart? Are you feeling all right?" Clearly she 
had little idea of what they were talking about. <P> 
At that moment the guard from before burst in through the door way the vixens had -not- 
used. <P>
"Halt! In the name of our prince concubines!" They said together again. <P>
Alexsandra shook her head. "Do these look like concubines? They aren't dressed like them, 
these are my two new work hands. Tammie and Janice." <P>
"Then why did they not say so?" Said one the guards finally apart. <p>
"You never ASKED us." Tammie said daring to speak. "You just chased after us." <P>
"You were dressed as concubines." The second guard said again apart. <P>
"We aren't dressed like them now." Tammie said hoping this worked. <P> 
The guards looked at each other, then at the vixens, then at each other again. Finally they 
said together again. "This is true, continue then with thy role." They turned and left. <P>
Janice let out a breath she didn't know she was holding, Tammie too felt relieved. <P>
"Oh those guards, they're way to eager for something to do beside stand around or walk 
back and forth in the hallways." Alexsandra commented going back to her work. <P>
"I have some spare attire in the back there, watch the butcher knives. Then we can get to 
work." She said calmly. "The prince is selecting his queen this night and day, I wish he 
would pick me, thou I know this is but a dream." <P>
Tammie and Janice looked at each other, and figured not going around naked in of itself 
was at least a good idea. <P></p>
