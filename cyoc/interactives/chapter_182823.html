<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Knots sisters were a couple of girls that could draw every eye in a restaurant on a Friday night. They were absolute dolls, beautiful twins who you could usually find answering every question in class or tucked away in the university library restocking shelves. They were just perfection to every guy on campus, the type of gal your parents would be delighted to have you bring home. Unfortunately they were both taken so longing looks would have to stay longing looks.<br />
<br />
Harold Mansbridge had been one of those guys, at least last time he’d been nineteen. Also there’s only been one of them. He couldn’t believe his luck and had to keep pinching himself to make sure he wasn’t dreaming. Winnifred Knots as she was now known, was not only an exact duplicate of his dream girl but she was also really into him.<br />
<br />
He straightened his bow tie in anticipation, waiting for the girls to enter the diner. He’d often lined after various girls through his youth there, wishing he could take one out. He felt atop the world at that moment and felt his heart flutter even more when his girls stepped through the door laughing as she told her sister some joke. Minnie didn’t seem to find it anywhere near as funny as Winnie did but she put on a light and awkward smile for the sake of her sibling.<br />
<br />
Despite being identical they dressed very differently with Minnie wearing a cute little dress with boots and Winnie donning a skirt, sweater, and stockings. They’d had a little squabble over colour back in their dorm room. “We can’t both wear pink,” Minnie had complained so Winnie had thrown on a blue skirt and blue detailed sweater, annoyed she didn’t have a matching headband to go with it.<br />
<br />
Harold grinned stupidly at them and Winnie trotted up to him in excitement and planted a passionate kiss on his lips. It made his heart do a little flip and Minnie put her hands on her hips, staring at her sister crossly.<br />
<br />
“Winnifred Knots, have some decency. What would mom say?” Minnie demanded.<br />
<br />
“What would mom say about your late night ‘drives’ with Freddie?” Winnie teased in return. Minnie turned bright red at her words and slid into the booth after them with a huff. It didn’t take long for a fourth to join them. The man in question pulled up in his car and sauntered into the diner. He had slick black hair, impressive sideburns, and a build that just shrieked of manliness. The very reason Harold hadn’t flirted with Minnie in the past halted before their booth and grinned down at them with his perfect teeth.<br />
<br />
Freddie Vonce was his name and seeing him reminded Harold of his three rules. Never mess with his football games, never mess with his girlfriend, and never, under any circumstances, mess with his car. That car was his life and joy and referred to as Vanessa affectionally. The guy had never even looked at Harold in the past but he guessed dating twins had changed that.<br />
<br />
Freddie wasn’t his best friend or anything in this new reality, but at least when he let an insult leave his lips Minnie would jab him in the elbow real hard. He mostly jut sat there in boredom when they talked school and Harold sat there in boredom when Freddie talked about his car or his sports.<br />
<br />
When the girls departed to the bathroom not a word was spoken between them, just an uncomfortable silence lingering between them. In fact Harold could have sworn he heard Freddie complaining that his friend Steve should have gotten with Winnie instead of him.<br />
<br />
They ordered when the girls came back and not long after that their shakes arrived, one for each couple. The girls were all over them, taking sips of their own and tasting each other’s before the guys could get a taste.<br />
<br />
“Careful,” Freddie warned. “You need to watch your figure.”<br />
<br />
Minnie elbowed him hard and judging from the Yelp a few seconds later, Winnie had added a kick to that blow. They seemed to make up quickly as they were sharing the drink a few seconds later. Harold couldn’t help but feel amused by how well he got along with Winnie compared to Freddie and Minnie. He felt like a real winner.<br />
<br />
“If you were my girlfriend, you’d hate comments like that,” Minnie scolded her boyfriend.<br />
<br />
“But I’m not the girl here,” Freddie replied with a poke of his girlfriend’s nose.<br />
<br />
They ate burgers and fries after that and chattered over the juke box and the music it was belting out. It was only after they’d finished eating that things got a little weird. Harold had to do a double take and noticed quite clearly that Freddie was shorter. He didn’t loom over his girlfriend anymore, in fact he was exactly her height. That was when he looked at his girlfriend and noticed that he’d fallen to her height too. Even worse was the fact she and her sister were growing.<br />
<br />
Freddie noticed it too, one second he was the biggest at the table and the next he was the shortest and the girls were the tall ones. He glanced at Harold in confusion and pointed. Harold grabbed at the hair falling into his face, blonde and definitely getting longer. He pointed back at Freddie who suddenly had lipstick smeared around his lips.<br />
<br />
“Excuse us for a second,” Harold announced while rising to his feet, his now tall girlfriend watching him without much reaction.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, guy stuff, we gotta fix our hair or something,” Freddie added before basically shoving Harold right into the bathroom.<br />
<br />
“What is going on?!” Harold demanded.<br />
<br />
“Why are the girls giant?” Freddie added before pointing at Harold. “Y-your face!”<br />
<br />
“What about my face?” Harold demanded before rushing to the mirror and nearly shrieking. His face had shrunk and reshaped itself until he had the mug of a really pretty girl. “I look like a chick.”<br />
<br />
There was a sudden cry from Freddie and he grabbed at his crotch before paling.<br />
<br />
“I am a chick,” he mumbled before they were hit with a flurry of changes. Freddie’s dark hair grew out of her scalp, Harold’s hips popped out as his pelvis shifted, and Freddie’s ass inflated to a beautiful size that made her scream. Harold felt his own dick and balls retreat as Freddie’s scream rose in octaves until it was shrill and feminine.<br />
<br />
“What do we do?” Freddie demanded in her new girly voice while shaking Harold back and forth. She let go the second Harold’s chest inflated outwards and Freddie’s hands rubbed against the newly formed breasts.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know!” Harold replied, her voice cracking higher with each syllable. “What did we do that made us change?!”<br />
<br />
“I ran a stop sign on my way here,” Freddie admitted in panic while her lips puckered up.<br />
<br />
“I wasn’t with you, and neither were the girls,” Harold replied while motioning at herself, her pants legs merging into a long skirt that quickly rose up to her knees.<br />
<br />
“Uh, I was making fun of Minnie!” Freddie exclaimed while each bat of her eyes made her eyelashes expand.<br />
<br />
“I wasn’t!” Harold replied, her feet shrinking in size.<br />
<br />
“The shake!” Freddie exclaimed, batting a hand into the other, a motion that made her hands turn dainty and feminine and each nail to be painted with glossy nail polish.<br />
<br />
Harold paled at that, her long hair collecting behind her head while a baby blue ribbon tied it together with a neat and ladylike bow. She pictures Winnie’s lips sipping from her milkshake and from her sister’s the same lips that had sucked her cock earlier that day and transported her back to the past and turned Winnie into Minnie’s twin. That was it, it had spread to all of them.<br />
<br />
“That’s it,” she swallowed as her undershirt shrank into a breast hugging bra. Her bow tie turned into a necklace while her shirt became a sweater with a baby blue stripe on it to match the ribbon in her hair. Her shirt took on the same colour as well.<br />
<br />
“How do we reverse it?” Freddie asked with a tremble, her own breasts pushing out and her shoes becoming a pit of go go boots. They looked like a couple of gals you’d find in any diner by that point. A couple minor changes occurred before the whole process halted and they were left as complete women dressed up for a night on the town.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know, maybe we should drink another shake,” Harold suggested before Freddie grabbed her stomach.<br />
<br />
“I’m full,” she admitted with a sort of panic, “I’m never full after my meal, I usually pick at what’s left of Minnie’s and then eat more when I get home.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe we can slip out,” Harold suggested. “Come back tomorrow and try to reverse this.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Freddie exhaled before opening the door and peering out onto the floor. “But where are the girls?”<br />
<br />
“Found them,” Harold swallowed after only one gaze across the room. It was hard to miss the two very handsome guys at the register, mostly because they looked identical and like masculine versions of Minnie and Winnie.<br />
<br />
“No way,” Freddie shook her head. “I can’t believe this.”<br />
<br />
It didn’t really matter if she believed it or not.<br />
<br />
“You girls have the wrong bathroom,” one of the twins laughed while approaching them. He’d become a six foot one prime rib of a man with short well kept hair and a clean shaven face. He must have been Winnie because he completely ignored Freddie and pulled Harold from the bathroom and out where a bunch of other college students were dancing. Freddie was pulled onto the floor and stared at Harold the whole time as if he could fix this.<br />
<br />
By the time they stepped from the diner they both knew their names. Harold had been called Harriette half a dozen times and Freddie was called Fran and bragged about by Minnie, now going by Milton, to every other guy in the bar.<br />
<br />
“Where’s Vanessa?” Fran asked in complete panic when she stepped outside.<br />
<br />
“Who?” Harriette’s boyfriend Winston asked.<br />
<br />
“My car, where’s my car?” Fran demanded.<br />
<br />
“Oh, so you want to go for a drive, I can arrange that,” Milton grinned before steering her over to a nearby car and setting her delicately into the passenger seat. Fran couldn’t stop blushing and stared at Harriette with panic the entire time she was in sight.<br />
<br />
“You want to go to The Point too?” Winston asked while slinging an arm around her shoulders. She inhaled the scent of his cologne and felt her entire body tremble with... arousal she guessed. Her heart was hammering and when she looked up at the man Winnie had turned into she blushed hard and couldn’t say a word. “I’ll take that as a yes,” he smiled before leading her to his own car and peeling out of the Parking lot after his brother.</p>
