<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Christine was a 14 year old girl who was quite insecure, she thought that she was ugly and unattractive who no boy would ever want to date or even talk to.<br />
<br />
She was on a vacation with her mother, father, and two brothers. Her mother was a decent look, her breasts were a D cup, which was much better than Christine’s A cup, her mother had a very curvy body which was the main attraction and is what Christine assumed was the reason her father married her. Her father had a muscular body and a very obviously large penis, he didn’t try to hide it through the fabric of his shorts, it was outlined very clearly through them. Christine had come to the conclusion that her parents didn’t love each other to begin with, they saw each other as attractive and continued to date, and it went on from there.<br />
<br />
Her older brother, Max, who was 16, was fairly muscular, not to the extent of her father, but he had defined abs. His penis was also very large, she could see it through the tight swimming shorts he wore. Her younger brother, who was 13 was also quite muscular, he was also taller than Christine, even though they were two years apart, you would think she was the youngest. <br />
<br />
The family had set out to go to the beach for the day even though Christine had advised not to, she didn’t like having to wear revealing clothes, so she went in a long sleeve t-shirt with some baggy shorts so she didn’t get too hot, she had a hat on so most people couldn’t see her face,  she didn’t like the idea of a cute boy around her age seeing her face and thinking she was ugly so she kept her face hidden for the majority of the trip.<br />
<br />
The rest of the family were out having fun in the ocean, so Christine decided she wanted to explore ,so she walked around for a good five minutes admiring the nice view, taking a few pictures with her phone before she stepped on something sharp in the sand. She looked down, and beneath her feet was a green stone, it wasn’t transparent or anything, so she picked it up assuming it was just a normal discolored stone and planned to try and skim it on the water.<br />
<br />
When she picked it up but it felt a lot smoother than she first realised, she wondered why it felt so sharp, when she lifted it up to get a better view of it, and realise it had a rope attached to it, the rope had some metal bits dangling off of it, she looked a bit closer and saw that on the underside of it were 5 coloured markings on it, one red, one blue, one yellow, one green (a lighter green from the stone), and one black. She looked at it for about half a minute before realising everybody might be looking at her, out of fear of confrontation, she walked at a fast pace back to where her bag was placed. After getting back, she sat down and looked at the stone, then she put it in her pocket. A few hours passed and it got darker so her family decided to leave, Christine had to quickly hurry behind them as she got distracted by something on her phone.<br />
<br />
The family wanted to go out for dinner at a resteraunt, Christine didn’t want to go so her family let her stay at the hotel with her youger brother who also didn’t want to go due to his girlfriend wanting to call him and he wanted to call her, Christine couldn’t have any interest in what he was doing so she decided to go to the bedroom which she had to share with her older brother.<br />
<br />
After a while of chatting with her friends on text, she decided to go into the bathroom and listen to music, so she walked in and locked the door shut, put her headphones in and  turned on the music before laying on the floor lifeless, as she usually did. She wanted so badly for her family to know how she felt, but there was nothing she could do to make it so.<br />
<br />
After laying on the floor, contemplating life, for about half an hour, she got up. As she looked down she saw the stone on the floor, ‘it must have fell out of her pocket while I was zoned out’ she thought to herself, she picked it up and looked at herself in the mirror and took a deep sigh, then she placed the amulet over her orange hair (which was strange considering her father was blonde and so was her younger brother, and her mother was a brunette and so was her older brother, she the odd one out, as well as the other aspects of her) and placed around her neck, she looked at herself and though it suited her well. <br />
<br />
She then pushed it to the left to center it, but when she did that it began to glow, the five colored spots lit up as well as the centre of it, this left her confused, so she tapped the red spot on it and like magic, her finger had a glowing red spot on it, an unnatural kind of glow to it. She tried to wipe it off on the edge of the sink, but couldn’t, it didn’t seem poisonous so she subconsciously licked it, it touched her lips before her tongue, as she touched them, the spot went away, but her lips began to feel a strange warmth, a noticeable warmth that didn’t hurt in any way, but it wasn’t a normal feeling. She looked at herself in the mirror as she saw her lips grow before her, she looked at her face and saw them pushing forward and outward, they continued to grow until they were the both the size of her thumb. She was confused, freaked out, scared, and this made a strange feeling of butterflies in her stomach.<br />
<br />
She poked her lips again to see if she could do it again, but of course couldn’t, she had no idea what to do, she started panicking, saying to her self, “What do I do!! What do I do!!” Which came out as, “Whad’uwah’doo!! Wha’too’ah’duh!!” Saliva began to drip from her lips, she wasn’t used to them being this big.<br />
<br />
He tried randomly poking at a color on the necklace, which she would probably call amulet by now, she randomly pushed her finger into one of them and poked the black one, this made the Amulet vibrate, and the same vibration spread around her body, making her shiver, it spread like a wave along her body, and when it got to her lips, they went back to their original size.<br />
<br />
Relieved, but also confused, and a bit intrigued, she wondered what she should do next..</p>
