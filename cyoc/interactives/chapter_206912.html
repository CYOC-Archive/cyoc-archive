<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The stork then sprinkled some violet powder upon the former young teen. Jonathan sneezed, at which the big bird chuckled. His sneezes were just too much! But then Jonathan felt himself change. Horns sprouted upon his forehead. Tiny nubs that were appropriate for his young age. More downy fuzz erupted upon his face and back. His tummy stayed bare. But his legs suffered drastic alterations. Thicker, but still fine hair, matching his hair color, sprouted on his legs. Pressures occurred all through his legs and in his lower back. There was a few seconds of sharp pain and he cried, as any baby would. But the pain wasn&#39;t that severe, he shouldn&#39;t be bawling like a stupid baby. His feet suffered the most changes and he saw they shifted to becoming cloven hooves. In fact, his tow legs had become goat legs and a tiny tail had come out from his back. He could wriggle it slightly.<br />
&quot;Oh my!&quot; gushed the stork. &quot;You are the most adorable little faun I&#39;ve ever seen! Coochy coochy coo!&quot;<br />
He tickled Jonathan under the chin and thanks to the feathers, Jonathan erupted in giggles and for a moment, he forgot his previous tears. Indeed, he was engulfed in sweet bliss and innocence as he basked in the attention and praise offered by someone. That made him incapable of resisting as the stork placed him in a wicker basket, wrapped him into a the softest pink blanket Jonathan had ever felt and cooed at him, telling him he would soon forget his life and that his two new daddies would just adore him. They had waited so long for his arrival! Jonathan wanted to scream in protest or yell in disgust but already his baby mind were superseding his young teen thoughts. Annoyingly, he could only gurgle in wonderment, his fingers naturally reaching his mouth. The stork tied a white cloth around the basket and delicately took off.<br />
<br />
During the trip, Jonathan was mortified. A baby faun! Him! To be adopted by two gay goat-men! It had to be a nightmare! The idea of homosexual men disgusted him and a subject of horror among his friends. Lesbians were hotter! Why could he not have been adopted by satyr women? He bet their woman and goat tits would be a lot nicer to see and touch! And imagining them making out... Wow! But no, he had to be delivered by two stupid hairy faggots! Or did they shave, as gay men? He wanted to cry and hurl insults at the stork but again his babified mind took precedence. The gentle rocking of the basket in the air made his sleepy and without realizing it he closed his eyes and settled into the amazing warmth and softness of his little bed. His last thoughts were how it was great to be wrapped in such coziness and that he hoped he would feel more of this. Yes, he could get used to this level of safe softness. He dimly wondered if his mommy&#39;s womb had been as wonderful as he rubbed her swollen belly full of a cute little satyr and as she munched vegetables and grasses to make sure her goatling would grow strong with long horns to be proud of. He hoped he&#39;d see his mommy who must be the nicest and prettiest again soon...<br />
<br />
Johnny woke at the sound of sweet little words whispered into his tufty ears. The stork was gone and if he was still in his precious blankets, he was out of the basket. He was in the arms of a male faun. But not his mommy! He smelled different, too. The still-human part of his mind looked at the weird broad nose, light blond hair and horns flaring outwards that greeted his sight. But his baby brain was intent upon finding his mommy. His sweet, soft mommy! Except if the baby faun wanted to find his mother desperately, the mother he wished for did not exist. The human side of Jonathan, still alive in his skull, knew that and already he had problems recalling the traits of his true mom, the human one and that had really existed. Nevertheless, albeit for different reasons, his brain agreed it was time to get distraught. Jonathan started to wail and thrash with his weak limbs. The adult faun tried to shush him, suddenly worried. <br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter, my little one?&quot;<br />
&quot;He&#39;s probably scared. And hungry,&quot; answered another male faun entering the stone den they inhabited. This one was much more muscular, with a black beard and masses of long hair upon his head, along with enormous ram horned. The blond faun bounced a little their new bundle of joy, but that didn&#39;t do the trick.<br />
&quot;Let me go warm up a bottle of milk,&quot; said the bulkier goat-man.<br />
When he returned, the blond faun attempted to offer the nipple leading to warm milk to Jonathan but he twisted his head this way and that. How could he tell them he wanted the breast and udders of his mommy? Or better yet, that he wanted some real food and nothing to do with them? But the blond faun, noticing his coaxing went nowhere, let his partner tickle the belly of their new baby. Johnny giggled, leading the faun to force gently the bottle into his mouth. The warm creamy liquid gushed into his mouth and by reflex, Johnny sucked on the bottle. Soon, he had finished every last drop and felt incredibly drowsy. His human mind still wanted to scream but more and more, he thought the effort just wasn&#39;t worth it. He let himself be talked sweetly by the two fauns who placed him in a wooden crib. They rocked him and soon he drifted off to sleep. He was too tired and much too comfy to sort out the mess that was his thoughts. <br />
<br />
A few days later, Hazelnut, as Jonathan was now called, received an exciting visit. He had for the most part forgotten his past life, overtaken as he was by baby concerns and thoughts. The two male fauns were so nice and gentle, he barely thought about a mommy anymore and he loved cakes dipped in warm milk. Cuddles were great too and even the strong arms of the black-haired fauns made him feel protected. And proud, to have a daddy as big and strong as he did!<br />
<br />
One afternoon brought a real treat, though. The two fauns asked their two female friends to come over. A couple, like them. Hazelnut had a great time, being spoilt, cooed at, molly-coddled and generally getting cuddled and told he was adorable. Then one of the females suggested offering milk to the new little darling and both presented their overflowing udders, one female with four breasts and the other with two set of goat udders, making a total of eight nipples to latch onto. And latch onto he did, suckling as much as he could, remnants from his human brain marvelling at the abundance of female breasts and how his dream of gay female fauns had come true. He had no trouble promptly falling asleep amongst the four breasts of the first female faun, blissfully full and content. He allowed these coherent thoughts of his former life get submerged by his new innocence and needs. They weren&#39;t very important or indeed much developed or intelligent to start with.</p>
