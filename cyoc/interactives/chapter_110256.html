<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Chapter title is lyrics form the AC/DC song Jailbreak</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Julie was clearly mad; being made to wait in a small chamber while the council was busy reviewing evidence and testimony against her; seeing her former friend Frieda Knight along with Eric and Spencer as well. Julie tried to confront them in the common area. Being stopped by Daisuke Tachibana and his brother Yamoto made Julie even more livid as the two were-foxes denied her a chance at some measure of justice for a second time in the morning. Looking at the were-foxes she makes a mental note to put them on her long list for revenge.<br />
<br />
After sitting in the chamber for about a couple of hours waiting to be called; Julie left to see the same were-foxes that stopped her, blocking her path.<br />
“You’re not leaving until you are called,” Daisuke Tachibana staring at the young wer-mer; who is still not bothering to cinch up her robe, allowing everyone to see her womanly assets.<br />
“The I guess I’m just going to have to squat and take a piss right here,” Julie being flippant;  “or you could escort me to the girl’s room. Choice is yours.”<br />
Daisuke snorts in disgust as he guides Julie to the nearest washroom. As Julie was entering the two were-foxes started to follow but Julie stops them cold.<br />
“Unless you have a vagina between your legs;” Julie pointing to the washroom sign marked female; “you stay out here.”<br />
Daisuke and Yamoto look at Julie cold and each take a place at the washroom entrance.<br />
Julie shaking her head enters the washroom. Seeing she is not alone; Julie notices a custodial staff mopping up. Seeing that the individual has not notice her; Julie grins as she sees her chance at an escape. She quietly shifts from her stage two form back to human and takes a broom off the Janitors trash cart; she uses the shaft as a garrote to quietly silence the person. While wer-mers were considered the weakest of the were species; Julie was able to surprise the person and quickly crush their windpipe; killing the person as Julie slowly suffocates the janitor to death.<br />
<br />
Minutes later, Julie lets go to see the person lying lifeless on the ground. Noticing that the janitor was female; she had a wer-mer scent heavily muted with the various cleaning supplies, gives Julie and ideal. Stripping the dead girl of her clothes Julie puts the clothes on and takes what little money was on the person. Julie figuring the were-foxes waiting for her outside knew her scent; she splashes some of the cleaning supplies on herself as a means to temporarily mask and alter her smell. Before leaving the washroom; Julie quickly uses the toilet. Afterwards she drags the dead body to one of the stalls and leaves using the custodial cap to hide her face and push the cart out.<br />
<br />
Daisuke and Yamato seeing the door to the female washroom open up, prepare to escort Julie back to the waiting chamber; instead they see one of the many custodians leaving the washroom. Julie with her head down grinning as they make no attempt to stop her; Julie’s disguise and simple attempt to mask her scent worked. Feeling embolden; Julie quickly heads to a door with a card lock; Julie uses the card off the dead janitor and gains access to a side hall for janitorial staff only. Ditching the cart she hightails down the hall. Looking at the two branches she sees and exit sign at the end of one and rushes to that location.<br />
“Freedom,” she grins; Julie uses the key card once again to open a door. Leaving the building she is greeted with the sight of snow covered woods and blue sky. Taking off like a shot; Julie quickly disappears in the dense forest. Thinking she is heading to the highway out of town; Julie makes her plan to bum a ride to Seattle and heading to Puget Sound where she will finally disappear and make her way to the tropics for her plan to find some lonely old man and be a gold digger.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Daisuke and Yamoto were waiting at the female washroom for what seemed like a long time. Not wanting to be rude or having to deal with a teenage girl screaming as men entered the female washroom, they continued to wait for Julie Stovall to finish her business.<br />
“How long does it take for a female to void their bladder,“ Yamoto grumbles.<br />
“No man can answer that question brother,” Daisuke answers; “it’s one of the mysteries that is womanhood.”<br />
<br />
Lila Carpenter was feeling restless while waiting for the council to take a break; eager to be with Lance as she managed to get out of city hall work; she heads over to the washroom. Needing to relieve herself she sees, Daisuke and Yamoto standing guard. Nodding at the two were-foxes as she enters the female washroom; Lila passes by the stall with the dead janitor slumped over the toilet. Lila seeing the dead body screams bloody murder.<br />
<br />
Outside, Daisuke and Yamoto hear the scream of the were-tigress that just passed them and immediately enter the washroom. They see the dead body of a naked girl and the white robe Julie was wearing when she entered. Yamoto swearing as he leaves his brother to try and comfort the distraught were-tigress. Yamoto bursts into the council as it was still in session.<br />
“Apologies everyone,” Yamoto speaking; “Julie Stovall has escaped! And she has committed murder!”<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Julie running as fast as she is able; Julie was panting as she made it to a road. Unsure if it was a highway out of town; Julie start to thumb for a ride.<br />
Alyssa Cooper was unsure of what to do. After last Monday with having to beg her ex-fiancé to get her out of the charges her cousin laid on her; Alyssa was seriously considering taking her cousin’s advice and leaving town permanently. Driving on the road; she notices a person trying to bum a ride. Pulling over to let the person in; Alyssa is assaulted by the stench of strong chemicals. Yet Alyssa could smell a faint hint of wer-mer on her.<br />
“Were you off to,” Alyssa trying to make conversation.<br />
“Seattle,” Julie answers; I’m hoping to get out of town real fast.”<br />
“Problems,” Alyssa mildly interested in the young wer-mer’s issues.<br />
“I just left a bad situation,” Julie answers not wanting to tell the Good Samaritan she just escaped the elder council building; “I was facing major trouble and I don’t want to answer for it.”<br />
“What kind of trouble,” Alyssa asking<br />
“Don’t you know,” Julie looking at the Samaritan and then swearing; “Shit! Alyssa!”<br />
Alyssa stop the car and looks at her passenger; “how do you know my name?”<br />
Julie takes off the janitor’s cap; “It’s me Julie Stovall.”<br />
<br />
Alyssa looks stunned at seeing Martin’s daughter in her car. Her shock turns to joy as Alyssa grins.<br />
“Well,” Alyssa smiling; “this is turning into an interesting day. I do know of a place in Seattle we can go to. But I want some juicy information. Starting with why you are running away. And afterwards, mayhap we can exchange samples of each other’s honey.”<br />
“Statue 1A violations,” Julie answers; “I didn’t want to answer to the charges placed on me so I sneaked out of the elder council building.” Julie not knowing how Alyssa would react if she knew murder was just committed to escape; Julie keeps mum on that detail.<br />
Alyssa looking stunned; “why would you do that?”<br />
“Because,” Julie answering; “I refuse to let some old fuddy duddies, deny me my pound of flesh.”<br />
“And what would that be,” Alyssa asking as she pulls onto the highway heading to Seattle; “who is on you proverbial shit list?”<br />
“My former friend Frieda Knight,” Julie starts; “my ex-boyfriend Eric Anderson and his current girlfriend Spencer Lawson. My other ex Brian Walker, Mom and dad; as well as the sheriff and everyone else who has crossed me.”<br />
“Am I on your list,” Alyssa asking; “you did give me grief with your finking on Brian and me to my Cousin the sheriff.”<br />
“Well you didn’t rat me out to my parents when we met at the lake last week,” Julie answers; “so I guess we are cool. Sorry for the email bit earlier. Brian was my target, you just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.”<br />
“Apology accepted. Speaking of your parents,” Alyssa asks; “what dirt do you have on them?”<br />
“Dad is resigning as Mayor, Julie answering; “he is going to be the new wer-mer rep for the elder council.<br />
“And your mother,” Alyssa thinking of sampling Melissa’s honey; “what of her?<br />
“Pregnant,” Julie flatly answers; “if you and my mother meet up, do me a favor and give my mother a good bolo punch in the gut.”</p>
