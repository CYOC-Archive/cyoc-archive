<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark was ready to leave the Chronivac alone, when he came up with an idea. What if only one member of the <br />
family was getting older? How would that affect their relationships and lives? He opened the time acceleration <br />
mode again and switched to the advanced options. Sure enough, you could choose to change the flow of time for <br />
individual people. Should he choose himself? Although he'd like to see how he'd look when he reached Simon's <br />
age, maybe he'd do that another time. He wanted to be an observer for once. He can't make Bryan or Simon older <br />
as they were both already so old. The sudden appearance of his nephew Danny did seem to mix things up a bit. <br />
Maybe he should see the boy become middle aged throughout the day. But wouldn't Jay notice that his son <br />
suddenly became their brother? Although Mark had adjusted his awareness of the situation for Jay, he was still <br />
pretty suspicious of the changes Mark had made, which had thrown a spanner in their brotherly relationship. <br />
<br />
Mark clicked on Danny's name and tried to decide on a time. He wanted Danny to become old, but not too old. <br />
Maybe he should make Danny end up the same age as him and Jay by the end of the day, therefore making them <br />
triplets. But it didn't sound clean to him, aging him 28 years. In the end, he decided to round that up to 30 <br />
years throughout the day, making him 42 by the end. He typed in the details and before clicking agree, he'd <br />
decided with a twinge of regret to change Jay's awareness to the same as Bryan's, which is to say he wouldn't <br />
be aware at all. He was getting too suspicious in the day and he wouldn't want to anger him more once his only <br />
son became their older brother. However he also changed Danny's awareness to the point Jay's was previously, <br />
wondering how an &quot;outsider&quot; would react to knowing something was up with his life, without previously knowing <br />
what the Chronivac did. With a bit of hesitation, he clicked accept and the Chronivac did its work, the wave-<br />
like energy bursting forth, though Mark didn't feel anything this time. He turned the Chronivac off and went <br />
back to his room, briefly bumping into his father on the way. Luckily the bathroom was opposite Simon's room <br />
so he didn't rouse suspicion. They exchanged goodnights and went to bed.<br />
<br />
 Danny had woken up early from his slumber, scratching his stubbly cheeks. He froze suddenly, since when did <br />
he have to shave? He was only a kid. But no, he wasn't. He was almost 20 now, and he'd inherited his dad's <br />
high testosterone levels. He'd been shaving since he was 14 near enough. He must of been remembering a dream <br />
of his, and yet his whole body didn't feel right. Standing up, he wobbled a bit on his large feet, now the <br />
tallest man in the family. His height gave him a better spread for his weight so he didn't look as large as <br />
his relatives at this age. In fact, he was in a healthy shape. Not as healthy as his uncle, but he tried to <br />
keep up. He itched his chest which was covered with hair that many men his age would be envious of and went to <br />
the bathroom. It was already occupied. They really needed more than one in the house seeing how there were 5 <br />
men sharing it, but they couldn't afford a new one. It wasn't long before his grandfather had finished and let <br />
him in. The old man gave him a weird look, like he'd never seen him before, then shook his head and continued <br />
to his own room. Danny frowned, did he look as different as he felt? Danny entered the bathroom and looked at <br />
his adult face. He looked the same as normal, yet there was a hint of unfamiliarity about it. He got to <br />
shaving his face, leaving a wide strip on the bottom of his face hairy, which wasn't a hard feat given his <br />
genetics. He'd seen the style on one of his favourite actors once and thought it looked cool. He fiddled with <br />
his hair, which had steadily receded by a couple of inches. It wasn't too noticeable if he combed his hair <br />
forward, yet it was obvious he'd follow the rest of his family. He wanted to shave his head like his uncle <br />
Mark, but his dad had told him it was a coward move and to embrace his hairline like the rest of his family. <br />
Maybe in a few years he'd have the courage to shave it. He sighed and got in the shower to clean up.<br />
<br />
Mark had woken up, still as a 40 year old and looked out of his bedroom door. He saw Simon leave the bathroom, <br />
not looking any different from their exchange in the night, while a young hairy man went in. He remembered <br />
what he did last night and went downstairs to fix breakfast. Meanwhile, Jay had woken up and waited outside <br />
the bathroom to be let in next. Danny came out and said good morning to his dad and headed down the hall to <br />
get changed. Jay couldn't believe how much his son had grown over the last few years. It only felt like <br />
yesterday that he was drawing pictures of the family. He'd kept one of them on the fridge, much to Danny's <br />
embarrassment, because it reminded him of the good old days. Now his little boy had graduated from high school <br />
and went straight to helping his family in the auto repair shop. He was even growing his first beard, an <br />
extended goatee which suited him well. Jay entered the bathroom and looked at his aging face in the mirror. He <br />
wondered where all that time went.</p>
