<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The reality warp caused by the &quot;sterotype&quot; formula now flowing through Zheng Ah Wen&#39;s body had claimed its third victim at nearly the same time as it changed his adopted children into his biological offspring.  The altering power reached out to secure for the changing family a proper matriarch. Thankfully, it did not have to go far to find a suitable base to transform. as one of the neighbors had crossed over the front lawn.<br />
<br />
And she would not be the last to changed by the warping power of the &quot;sterotype&quot; formula, as it seemed to sense that this neighborhood was not the proper place for such an honorable and tradtional family to live...<br />
<br />
====<br />
<br />
Megan Bradley lived in the house next door, which was a rather open one at that. She and the other millennials shared the space in a non-tradtional manner, sleeping where and with whomever they wanted to.  No one was exclusively with anyone else.  She and her housemates had been among the first to welcome the Zheng family to the neighborhood, and they&#39;d all gotten along swimmingly.<br />
<br />
Dressed in her favorite yoga pants and a well-worn t-shirt, the sandy blonde twenty-something had gotten up that morning and  pulled on a pair of old sneakers. Having a quick bite to eat, she&#39;d headed over to wish her gay neighbors a happy anniversary and give them a present from the household. She&#39;d meant to do it yesterday, but got distracted by a sudden bit of fun with one of her roommates. Little did Megan know who she was about to become once she crossed onto the lawn next door.<br />
<br />
====<br />
<br />
In the time it took her to get from her door over to the front yard of the Zhengs, she found herself walking up a magnificently maintained path of grey flag stones that had once been a plain red brick walkway. She paused in front of the thick black oaken door that more resembled an old fashioned gate, wondering when they&#39;d put that in. Suddenly, her mind remembered that Ah Wen had done it during the extensive remodeling a few years back, wanting to make their home more like it would&#39;ve been back in China.<br />
<br />
The young woman blinked, a little confused at where that flash of insight had come from, and why she thought this was her home. But as she stood there, reality continued to warp around her. The once ragged looking lawn gained new life as various plants and trees sprouted from its surface, swifty becoming a lovingly maintained and lush garden.  A thick stone wall sprang up along the former lawn&#39;s edge, sealing the house off from the outside world. A twin to the door Megan stood in front of pressed itself out of the new wall to face the street.<br />
<br />
Now even more confused and starting to get scared, the Caucasian millenial tried to walk away from this strange new house, even as a pair of stone fu dog statues rose up to flank the door but something kept her rooted to the spot. Perhaps, it was the sudden flood of memories that washed over her mind, as her knowledge of English was starting to be replaced with...Chinese. Flashes of a life lived abroad began supplanting her old memories. She&#39;d grown up in a small town...village in southern California  or was it China? Unable to process these conflicting thoughts, she briefly clutched at her head, oblivious to the physical changes starting to occur.<br />
<br />
As the alterations to Megan&#39;s memories started come faster and stronger,  her western features began to shift in reflection of them. Her pale skin gained a slightly golden hue that washed over her whole body, starting from her head. Her brownish blonde hair started grow longer, falling past her shoulders to the small of her back as a straight sheet of glistening ebony. Her bony and somewhat blockish face rounded itself out, with plump cheeks and a dimpled chin. Meanwhile delicate plucked brows arched over eyes that had gained epicanthic folds, even as their color shifted from dull brown to dazzling sea-green. Her thin lips thickened as her teeth whitened and straightened themselves into a perfect smile. There was a slight crunch as her nose lost length and width. Her fingers thinned, as her nails pushed themselves to a more feminine length.<br />
<br />
Her breasts surged outward, straining against her t-shirt as they gained a cup size or two. Her already taut stomach gained more tone while her thin hips widened to proportions more appropriate for child bearing. Below this, her thighs and buttocks began to swell with a healthy mix of fat and muscle that pulled her yoga pants tight. Her spine then arched inwards, further pushing out her butt and bust. A cracking of bones preceded the lengthening and toning of her legs, raising her height slightly above where it had been.<br />
<br />
All the while, her former life as a carefree millennial was being lost to that of a dutiful Chinese wife and mother. Her obsessions with the latest hashtags on social media gave way to a love of being in the kitchen. Resentment towards the previous generations inverted into a motherly concern for her sons&#39; futures. Her embrace of a truly progressIve lifestyle was rejected in favor of a traditional marriage. Some part of her old self tried to fight back, but quickly lost ground against her new self&#39;s steely will.  This new identity began to assert itself more fully with changes to Megan&#39;s clothing, as  such overly Western wear was hardly appropriate in this household.<br />
<br />
The legs of her formerly baggy yoga pants had fused together, becoming the bottom of a gray dress, with a single slit allowing her right toned leg to stand revealed. The colorful image of a cat that had graced her t-shirt faded into a grey non-existence as its bottom edge fused to the rest of the developing dress. The gray darkened further, losing its cotton texture as it became fine black silk that tighten appropriately to show off the lush curves of her body. Suddenly, embroidered patterns of flower made of red and gold threads stitched themselves into place, as some of  the silken material slid down her arms  to becoming proper bell sleeves. The loose neck of the former shirt stiffened, rising into a mandarin collar, while a pair of thick golden cords looped themselves across the front to points just above her right shoulder. <br />
<br />
The last traces of Megan Bradley disappeared with the twisting of her old sneakers into a comfortable pair of black leather flats. The newly formed Zheng Meixiang smoothed out a wrinkle in her elegant qipao even as her long black hair binded itself into a flower bun, accented by a plum blossom from the garden. A few hints of make-up dabbed onto her face, reddening her thick lips and highlighting the almond shape of her eyes. The once-anniversary gift had been changed into her beloved husband&#39;s favorite silver watch, as a thick jade band wrapped itself around her right ring finger. Allowing herself one last look at the garden, Meixiang rang the doorbell and smiled at the sight of the one who answered it. One deep kiss from Ah Wen later, she and him were on their way to see their sons hard at their studies. She felt so comforted by the strength of her husband.<br />
<br />

<br />
Meanwhile,  the power of the formula crept beyond the walls of the Zheng house, but where would it strike next...</p>
