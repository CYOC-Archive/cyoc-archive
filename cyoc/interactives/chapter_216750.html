<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Confused, exhausted, indignant, and cripplingly frightened by what this new reality had brought about, Gloria made the only move that she thought made sense in the moment.<br />
<br />
“I wish that we were all younger again, so suck on it Tom!”<br />
<br />
“Gloria, you idiot!” screeched Tammy as the stone exploded like a supernova of green luminescence, blowing back Gloria&#39;s blackish-gray hair in gust of supernatural wind.<br />
<br />
Bill, panicking, noticed that reality itself was melting, shimmering, becoming vague. It reminded him a bit of Inception when the city in Ellen Page&#39;s dream started collapsing into an M.C Escher puzzle, but he didn&#39;t have a chance to notice any specific impressions he could make out before the Ahn&#39;Ger Stone&#39;s magic had finished its course. The light faded away as quickly as it had erupted.<br />
<br />
It only took a moment for Bill to realize that he was now standing in a living room far removed from his own, let alone the guest room he had just been in a brief second ago.<br />
<br />
The room was rectangular, with a shaggy tan rug covering the entirety of the floor and white walls making up the rest of the area. A comfortable looking black couch sat across from a large screen television, with a rather nice looking rectangular coffee table in between the two. Bill walked up to the coffee table, and he noticed that a board game was sitting on top of it.<br />
<br />
Settlers of Catan! That was Bill&#39;s favorite board game, and it looked like the game was already in progress.<br />
<br />
Turning around, he saw two little girls, wandering around confused. One looked a lot like Gloria might have looked as a toddler, no older than two, three at the most. She was wearing a pink t-shirt for babies, and a diaper could be visibly seen poking out from underneath it. Her hair was in pigtails, and she was holding something in her right hand, but Bill couldn&#39;t make it out. Her eyes were darting around the room, frightened.<br />
<br />
The other girl had curly blonde hair and was dressed in a shirt with The Flintstones on it and some black pants. She seemed more curious than the other girl was.<br />
<br />
“Gworia?” asked Bill in a childish voice no older than two. He slapped his mouth and slowly looked down at himself. It was then when he looked down and noticed that he had transformed into a toddler too! He was wearing a black t-shirt with some cartoon character on it and he apparently was still in diapers as well.<br />
<br />
“Oh nooh!” he said in surprised agitation.<br />
<br />
Where was he?! What was this place?!<br />
<br />
He climbed on top of the couch and looked outside of a partially open window. Outside, Bill noticed that he wasn&#39;t in his hometown anymore. The first clue was that the traffic of both the automobile and pedestrian kind was a lot busier than Shermer, Illinois ever was. The second was that the buildings were a lot bigger and differently designed. The third were the palm trees. It was also a lot warmer than Illinois ever got. He crawled further on top of the windowsill and looked outside. In the distance he saw rolling hills.<br />
<br />
“Billy, sweetie, get down from there!” said a familiar voice.<br />
<br />
Bill turned around and saw Willow, his daughter from the future, frantically running across the strange living area and pick him up by the waist. She carefully placed him back on the floor and bent down to look at him face to face. She gently stroked his hair. She looked worried.<br />
<br />
“Billy, how many times do I have to tell you!? No climbing on the windowsill. I&#39;m sorry, Billy. I know how curious you are, but you&#39;re still only two years old, and your coordination isn&#39;t good enough to go on any adventures yet. Someday though ” she said, winking at him.<br />
<br />
It slowly dawned on him. That damn stone had changed reality again, and judging by what was going on, Bill would guess that it had turned Willow into his mother and himself into her son! Bill couldn&#39;t believe it. It was mind blowing enough to know that he&#39;d have a daughter in the future, but now he was back in diapers, and Willow was the one pulling them up. He was scared as he thought about the seemingly unlimited power and capriciousness of that stone, now wondering deeply how it came to land on his porch in the first place. More importantly, what had happened to his real mom and dad? The fear showed in Bill&#39;s eyes, which Willow took to mean that he was upset.<br />
<br />
“Oh, honey, I&#39;m sorry” said Willow in a very maternal voice. “I know! How about we all go out for ice cream later after Mommy is done working?”<br />
<br />
Just to keep up appearances, Bill nodded fervently.<br />
<br />
Option 1: In this new reality, Willow is the daughter of Kimberly Strasserman. When Willow moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in animation and ended up pregnant with triplets after a one night stand, Kimberly soon followed her to pursue her own interests, trying to restart her life in middle age. She and Willow currently live together in a decent apartment. Grandma Kimmy stops by after one of her classes to watch Bill, Tammy, and Gloria while Willow is working.<br />
<br />
Option 2: The story briefly switches to Willow&#39;s point of view of a harried, ambitious young single mother as she simultaneously works on a project from home while also keeping an eye on the gang&#39;s attempts to figure out a way to activate the stone again.</p>
