<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There Rene was, looking up at Helen, and realizing all too late that she'd made a horrible mistake!<br />
<br />
&quot;How should I kill you, Rene?&quot; Helen asked her, menacingly &quot;Should I fry you? Crush you? Eat you? Or maybe I'll just take that soaker of yours, <br />
and find out if I can make myself even MORE powerful?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then, thinking fast, Rene smiled and shouted &quot;Hey Drake! What do you think of 'Miss Popular' NOW?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Drake?!&quot; Helen said, panicking, then turned around fast. &quot;I swear Drake,&quot; she said &quot;this isn't what it looks like! I was just ... &quot; She stopped when <br />
she saw he wasn't there! Then she turned back to face Rene, only to find a fox-girl-shaped white cloud being blown away. &quot;I can't believe I fell <br />
for that!!!&quot; she said, as she smacked her hand on her face. &quot;Now you're gonna get it!!!&quot; and she ran at full speed after Rene.<br />
<br />
As Rene ran, she saw Helen gaining on her, so acting fast, she pulled a banana out of an invisible pocket on her skirt, peeled it, ate it, and <br />
tossed it over her shoulder. By the time Helen knew what Rene did, she'd stepped on it and started sliding down the street!<br />
<br />
Rene dodged her, and Helen could be heard shouting &quot;You've gotta be kidding me! This joke so oooooold!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But effective!&quot; Rene happily shouted after Helen, as the dragon slid down the street, swerved around the corner, and out of sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder if she'll remember she has wings and can fly away?&quot; Rene thought out loud, and upon saying this, a large crash could be heard off-<br />
screen, sounding like a car-wreck, and a piano being destroyed. &quot;Whoops!&quot; Rene said, smiling &quot;I guess not! Now on the the next item on my to-<br />
do list - Here I come, Drake!&quot; and with that, she pulled a hole out of nowhere, threw it on the ground, and cannonballed right in, laughing all <br />
the way as it closed up behind her.<br />
<br />
Up on the rooftop, 2 cloaked figures (anime characters btw) had watched the whole thing - A woman with a nice body, but but an evil look, and <br />
a short, bald, fat man with blank eyes, and a bulbous nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like everything is in place now for the next part of the plan.&quot; the woman said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That dragon looked so big and juicy, Lust!&quot; the man said to his partner &quot;Can I eat her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No Gluttony.&quot; Lust said &quot;We have to convince her we're on her side by helping her get back at the fox, so we need her alive - for now. You'd <br />
know that if you'd paid attention to the plan!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot; Gluttony said sadly &quot;I'm just so hungry!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You already ate that duck-woman yesterday,&quot; Lust said &quot;so don't complain. Speaking of which, I thought Envy's act as her was very convincing <br />
- had Rene playing right into our hands, and even gave her that water gun, so at least ONE of my comrades remembers the plan!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gluttony started drooling an erie green substance.<br />
<br />
(Author's note: If you've seen &quot;Who Framed Rodger Rabbit&quot;, then you know that DIP is the only thing that kills toons, so that's why Gluttony <br />
used it to eat his poor victim. The reason why it didn't kill him is because he's a homunculus, and besides that, due to the vast culture <br />
difference between Western cartoons and Japanese anime, it has no affect on anime characters at all. And due to more cartoons today being <br />
made of digital imaging as opposed to paint, it won't work on newer toons, so it won't affect Rene or Helen since they became digitally-colored <br />
toons. Ever since the technology could be used, and since the &quot;Judge Doom&quot; incident of 1947, the management of Toon World fixed it so that <br />
any human who becomes a toon, on purpose or otherwise, would be digitally colored, to act as a safeguard, should the now-illeagal and <br />
outlawed substance ever get smuggled in somehow. Gluttony though, could kill and eat ANYONE, and the DIP he had in the limitless storage <br />
space in his stomach guaranteed it. So while getting part of their bodies bitten off wouldn't kill or hurt them, and DIP would have no affect, if <br />
they got bitten by Gluttony WITH the DIP in his mouth, it would be fatal! And if you're wondering how they got the DIP, the had an Alchemist <br />
make it for them by transmuting the basic matter needed to make it. This alchemist, btw, is non-canon, so they aren't any you'd know from <br />
official FMA media. This alchemist is still alive, and is the brain behind this evil plot, filling the same role as Dante did in the 2003 anime, and <br />
Father in the manga and 2009 anime. In addition to the 7 original homunculus, they transmuted the remains of a certain villain into a new one <br />
called &quot;Doom&quot;, His body is all black like the Gate Children, and just as featureless save for the anime-angled eyes with blood-red irises and slit <br />
pupils, the evil smile with sharp teeth, and the mark of the ouroboros on the left side of his neck. Doom has a high-pitched helium voice, all <br />
the memories of the one from whom he was made, and all the cruelty, insanity, and powers that go with them - buzz-saws, missiles, ect. He <br />
wears a white tux and long white pants. Doom obeys the alchemist only because they carry the remains within an amulet worn around their <br />
neck at all times. The name of the alchemist, what they lost due to equivalent exchange, and their exact plan will be revealed in time. For now, <br />
back to the story - sorry for the long explanation.) <br />
<br />
&quot;Careful with that, you fool!&quot; Lust scolded, and he sucked it back in. &quot;That DIP was very hard to get a hold of,&quot; Lust reminded him &quot;and the last <br />
thing we need is unnecessary property damage, so save it for the next toon you eat, understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Lust,&quot; Gluttony said apologetically &quot;but when?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll tell you when.&quot; Lust assured him &quot;In the meantime, let's meet up with Envy at the spot we agreed on, and go offer our help to Helen. She's <br />
an amateur at being a villain, so she shouldn't refuse help from professionals. Those two girls have no idea they're being used by us. I almost <br />
feel sorry for our clueless puppets - well, ALMOST!&quot; And at this, Gluttony gave an evil maniacal grin, reveling his many teeth as he looked down <br />
at the street below. The two homunculi then moved swiftly, but silently across the rooftops to meet Envy, who looked like a young teen guy <br />
(though his short, sleeveless top, his exposed midsection, his shorts, and his voice, made it hard to tell if he was a HE at all), with long, spiky <br />
green hair, and a black headband.<br />
<br />
&quot;About time you two got here!&quot; Envy said &quot;I had to climb up here as King Louie just to avoid prying eyes. You KNOW how much I hate posing as <br />
beatniks!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it's done now,&quot; Lust said &quot;so let's go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; Envy said, with an evil smile &quot;Time to reel in that clueless diva-turned-dragon with our song-and-dance routine! I love this part of the <br />
job!&quot;<br />
<br />
So they left to find Helen, with hopes of baiting her with revenge on Rene.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Drake and Jack had finished lunch, and were walking down another street.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm telling you Drake,&quot; Jack said &quot;toon chicks are EASY!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I keep telling YOU,&quot; Drake said, very annoyed at him &quot;that there's only ONE girl for me!&quot; He was referring to Rene, but never told Jack so.<br />
<br />
&quot;But haven't you seen these toon girls?&quot; Jack insisted &quot;They're HOT, and they practically THROW themselves at nice guys like you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you I'm not interested in girls who are animated,&quot; Drake said &quot;because 1: for all I know, they could be older than my grandma, or <br />
younger than my cousin's baby, and 2: most of them aren't even human - they're furries!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But dating a furry girl is every guy's dream,&quot; Jack said &quot;and have you seen the size of their assets? With some, you could fit an apple in the <br />
space between their -&quot; &quot;CUT IT OUT, JACK!!!&quot; Drake shouted, with open arms &quot;You're such a pervert, and besides, I know we're in Toon Town, <br />
but we STILL have to be real about this - even if I was interested, it's not like some random toon girl is gonna pop out of nowhere, and jump <br />
right into my arms!&quot; And just as Drake said that, right on cue, a hole opened up in front of them, Rene jumped out of it, and landed in Drake's <br />
open arms!<br />
<br />
&quot;Quick!&quot; Jack said, smiling &quot;Now say 'It's not like my best friend just won the lottery!' - COME ON, say it, PLEASE SAY IT!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Drake was very confused as he looked at the purple and pink, toon fox-girl he was holding in his arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Drake!&quot; she said smiling, in a voice he recognized.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rene?&quot; Drake asked, surprised but happy &quot;Is that you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eee-hee-hee-hee! Of course it's me!&quot; she said smiling, and adjusting her rose-tinted glasses &quot;Who were you expecting, Helen? I just gave her <br />
the slip - literally!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is she alright?&quot; Drake asked, not all that concerned about Helen in the first place, since she was so stuck-up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Rene answered, smiling &quot;She's a toon dragon rip-off of Maleficent's dragon form, so since toons can't die or be killed, she'll be fine - I'm <br />
sorry to say! Eee-hee!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But how did you two become toons?&quot; Drake asked as he gently put her down on her feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;A nice new toon friend I met felt sorry for me after I told her how Helen was treating me,&quot; she explained &quot;so she whacked me with a giant <br />
mallet, and turned me into THIS!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She turned you into a fox-girl?&quot; Drake asked, still confused &quot;Well,&quot; she said smiling, and twirling her long, red hair with her finger &quot;I wouldn't <br />
say she TURNED me into this - more like she brought out the real me! I've always been a beautiful toon vixen on the inside - I was just too <br />
scared to show it, but not anymore, and I'm glad!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then how'd Helen transform?&quot; Drake asked &quot;My new friend gave me THIS!&quot; she happily exclaimed, as she pulled out the water gun from an <br />
invisible pocket on her red miniskirt &quot;It's filled with toon water that has no effect on toons, but turns normal humans into their inner furries, so <br />
that they can't hide what they are anymore, or how they feel about others!&quot;<br />
<br />
She stood next to Drake, smiling seductively at him, and polishing her toonifying weapon. &quot;Becoming a toon felt great, Drake.&quot; she said <br />
seductively to him &quot;It set me free. Would you like me to set YOU free? I'd love to see what YOU'D look like - not that I don't like how you look <br />
NOW, but would you like to experience this anyway? I love you, so I'll only do it if you want it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sure.&quot; He said &quot;Is there a way to turn back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After you transform,&quot; she said lovingly &quot;you may not WANT to - I know I don't. Do you like me like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've always liked you, Rene.&quot; He said, smiling &quot;You didn't have to do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You've ALWAYS liked me?&quot; she said, as her big, beautiful, blue eyes lit up &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you're not like any other girl I've met.&quot; he told her &quot;You're smart, kind, and always know the right thing to say to others. I guess I was <br />
afraid of how people would react if they knew.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooookaaaaay.&quot; Jack said, smiling &quot;This just got really awkward, soooo I'm gonna go somewhere else now before this gets any better - just <br />
don't stay out after 10 at night, ok? Later!&quot; And with that, Jack left them alone, wondering if he should use this in one of his standup routines.<br />
<br />
Ignoring Jack, Rene asked Drake seductively &quot;Do you really think I'm smart?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like a fox!&quot; he said, chuckling a bit at his own joke &quot;Sorry - I've been with Jack too long!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's ok.&quot; she said smiling &quot;I'm a fox now, aren't I? Do you still like me now, though?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; he said &quot;I know it's you, and besides, you said you love me, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eee-hee-hee!&quot; she laughed &quot;That DID sorta slip out, didn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then I love you too.&quot; he said smiling warmly, and she smiled back with her fox ears wiggling a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;So now that we've both got some free-time,&quot; she said happily &quot;what do you wanna do with it? Go to the park? See a movie? Go on a ride? Do <br />
you want me to turn you into a furry toon like myself with this water gun, or would you like me to transform you with a kiss instead? Or <br />
perhaps since you're trying to become a professional animator, you could practice drawing with me as your model, and if you want me to take <br />
my clothes off, I don't mind, since I'm covered in all this thick fur, and I've lost all my modesty and embarrassment anyway. Don't worry though <br />
- I promise things won't get too 'PG-13' if you don't want them to. What will it be Drake, my love?&quot;<br />
<br />
After thinking about it, he decides happily, but what does he want? <br />
<br />
