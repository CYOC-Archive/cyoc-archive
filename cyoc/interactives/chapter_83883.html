<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mabel was still hiding around the corner of the art room, just out of sight of the children. The rings magic was still working, and the former 3-year-olds were now 10. Beth was still out of the room, having been “mortally embarrassed” by Jeremy, but Mabel was hoping that her ever growing maturity would cause her to return in short order. <br />
<br />
Especially because she knew that puberty was about to kick in and turn the kids into teenagers.<br />
<br />
Lori, was already 4’5”, and her thick, dark brunette hair suddenly snapped he hairband off as her hair grew longer and slightly curlier. She still had babyfat throughout her body, which caused her to begin developing breasts first; there were already two small bumps protruding from her chest, but barely.<br />
<br />
Annie, for her part, was still taller than Lori. The stick thin blonde was 4’6”, but was still flat and skinny. Her hairstyle changed yet again with her changing tastes, becoming shoulder length –although, since the ring could not cause hair to be cut, her body simply re absorbed the protein briefly and withdrew the hair inward, oddly.  No one seemed bothered by this of course.<br />
<br />
Annie and Lori were well into a conversation about cute boys on Disney Channel and Nickelodeon shows they enjoyed and were pretty much ignoring Jeremy, now 4’3”.  He seemed bored with them, two, and began drawing again, this time superheroes, with their anatomy improving and becoming more realistic.<br />
<br />
Then something happened that caused Mabel’s jaw to drop: As the girls rounded the corner from 10 to 11, they both hit growth spurts, and Mabel could actually seem them grow bigger and bigger! Lori was now already 4’9” while Annie was an even 5’ tall! Lori even began to develop acne.  Mabel, for her part, thought she heard poor skinny Annie ask Lori about her boobs, and she definitely heard Lori say “B cup” – almost as if it was intentionally whispered loud enough for Jeremy to hear. Lori, always the bold one, was obviously trying to get a rise out of the 4’4” boy.<br />
<br />
It was at that moment a much calmer Beth rejoined the group outside. Her emotions had obviously matured along with her.  Although at 4’3” she was still the smallest of the group, she had also begun to develop the tiny beginnings of breasts beneath her oversized smock.<br />
<br />
Jeremy approached the girl hesitantly as she entered. “Hey. I’m sorry if I embarrassed you. We cool?”<br />
<br />
Beth smiled at him shyly. “Yeah, we’re cool,” she said, as pimples began to appear on her forehead. Jeremy got one too on his cheek, at roughly the same moment.<br />
<br />
Mabel noticed that she could tell the girls growth was slowing slightly, while both Jeremy and Beth hit a spurt at about the same time. The four kids were now 12 years old, almost 9 years removed from where they started on the playground.  <br />
<br />
Lori and Annie were now 5’3” and 5’4” respectively. Lori’s chubbiness was melting away, leaving her definitely curvy. Still slightly bigger for her age but also still definitely not fat, she was already almost a full B-cup, but Mabel could see her breasts slowly pushing her shirt further out, and she knew it wouldn’t be long before she was a C-cup – she was definitely going to be the bustiest of the three. Annie, meanwhile, had still not developed breasts, but her hips were beginning to flare outward.<br />
<br />
Jeremy had hit a growth spurt and was roughly 4’9”, still short for his age.  He was however beginning to show signs of the “bad teenage mustache,” and his voice had dropped – not cracked yet, but he would be easy to confuse for a woman on the phone.<br />
<br />
Beth was roughly 4’7”, still the shortest.  Her new breast buds were pushing out the smock, she was already either a large A or small B.  Her acne was pretty bad, and her curly, light brown hair was starting to get stringy.  She was still slightly self-conscious and crossed her arms in front of her chest, as 12-year-olds often do to make their breasts seem invisible.<br />
<br />
The conversation had quickly turned to more teen and pre-teen oriented conversations, including pop stars.  Jeremy’s affection for Beth was turning into a crush, but like any typical pre-teen, he couldn’t keep his eyes off Lori’s growing boobs.<br />
<br />
Mabel giggled to herself as the changes continued, and then she realized she heard this sentence from Annie: “I really like helping these little kids after school.” <br />
<br />
With that, Mabel knew for sure just how powerful the ring was.</p>
