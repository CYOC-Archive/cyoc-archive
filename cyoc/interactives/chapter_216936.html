<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Savannah and Katerina were cuddling in bed together, gazing soulfully into each other&#39;s eyes. They had just gotten finished with an athletic, exhausting evening underneath the covers, both women in the midst of an orgasmic glow. <br />
<br />
With Savannah&#39;s duties protecting the cosmos, not to mention spending most of her free time now with her daughter and daughter in law, she didn&#39;t get to spend as much time together with the Black Widow as she used to. This time had felt like it had been a while.<br />
<br />
The two had always had an open relationship, so Katerina had adapted, finding other women to pleasure.<br />
<br />
But as much as Katerina was reluctant to admit affection for anyone, at the end of the day, she always came back to Savannah.<br />
<br />
Katerina sensually stroked Savannah&#39;s silky smooth thigh. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder what life would have been like for us without The Great Change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing good&quot; Savannah said. <br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
In another universe, Seth Tullio and his wife Lydia were busy having their own fun.<br />
<br />
Or at least they were trying to. <br />
<br />
Both of them knew deep down that their relationship wasn&#39;t working out and they didn&#39;t didn&#39;t love each other anymore, but they were both stubborn and trying to make it work anyway, through sheer force of will. <br />
<br />
At least until the kids were grown and out of the house. <br />
<br />
As Seth was thrusting into his wife, fondling her pillowy breasts, his cell phone suddenly started ringing on the bedside table.<br />
<br />
Without a second thought, Seth pulled out of Lydia and answered it. <br />
<br />
As he sat on the edge of the bed speaking to his superiors, he didn&#39;t see Lydia&#39;s angry expression. <br />
<br />
She turned on the TV to distract herself from her anger. <br />
<br />
Sigh, more news about the war in the Ukraine. <br />
<br />
Lydia was half Ukrainian, on her mother&#39;s side, and seeing the destruction of where her grandparents used to live pissed her the hell off. But nothing could be done to stop it. <br />
<br />
She hated the Russian leader so much. <br />
<br />
According to Seth, who had met the Russian leader, he was a prick in person too.  <br />
<br />
She changed the channel. <br />
<br />
More Drumpf news about his arraignment in Manhattan. Ugh. <br />
<br />
Seth had met Drumpf too, several times. According to her husband, he was somehow even stupider in person and twice as creepy. <br />
<br />
Because of his big dumb mouth, he wasn&#39;t allowed to know about Occ Ops, which was the first time a President had been kept in the dark about the paranormal since the department had began.  <br />
<br />
Lydia had enough news for today, she already knew how fucked the world was. <br />
<br />
She turned on Hulu and got lost in some new drama that had just come out. <br />
<br />
&quot;OK, I&#39;ll do it&quot; she heard Seth say.  <br />
<br />
He hung up the phone. <br />
<br />
Seth kissed Lydia goodbye as he quickly got dressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Work stuff&quot; he told her, which he expected her to understand. <br />
<br />
Lydia did understand what Seth meant, but it didn&#39;t mean that she had to like it. <br />
<br />
&quot;When will you be back?&quot; she asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not sure&quot; Seth said. &quot;Probably less than a week.&quot;<br />
<br />
He entered Emily&#39;s bedroom and kissed her goodbye. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bye Daddy. I&#39;ll miss you&quot; she said. <br />
<br />
He entered Nancy&#39;s room next and did the same. She and her friend Kevin were playing video games.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re the man of the house until I get back&quot; Seth said, patting Kevin on the shoulder. &quot;Can you handle that, buddy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can count on me!&quot; Kevin said cheerily. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Don&#39;t let these women push you around too much. You give an inch, they&#39;ll take a mile.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seth winked at Nancy, who smiled. <br />
<br />
Seth then walked outside of his house, got into his car, and drove away.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
After being briefed about his mission, which was off the books: acquiring a teenage trans girl living in California who had mysteriously vanished from an airplane, and sending her back to her family in Saudi Arabia to be detransitioned, Seth told his contact, &quot;I&#39;ll do it&quot;. <br />
<br />
His contact, a Russian colleague named Katerina, was disgusted.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you really take let that poor girl go back home to suffer, I&#39;m never speaking to you again&quot; she said flatly.  <br />
<br />
&quot;OK.&quot;<br />
<br />
After going over the report while eating a Whopper he picked up from Burger King, Seth had a pretty good idea of what happened to Aziza.<br />
<br />
It was obvious, really, considering where in California Aziza&#39;s relatives were from. <br />
<br />
It took him less than an hour to do some additional research with his good friend Google and formulate a plan of action.<br />
<br />
He boarded his flight later that night. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
In Glendale...<br />
<br />
Kylie Perkins had spent the rest of the night dodging all Kyle and Aziza&#39;s questions about exactly who she was, where she came from, where she had just disappeared to, and why she had magical powers. The two were curious about everything about her now, skeptical about her story of being a transfer student from out of town. <br />
<br />
Kylie promised her new friends that she&#39;d explain everything to them another time when she was more comfortable talking about it, but she just wasn&#39;t right now. <br />
<br />
Aziza and Kyle both had no choice but to accept it. <br />
<br />
With all three of them having been through a lot tonight, the trio of teens decided to cool down and watch a movie to get their minds off of all the upsetting stuff. <br />
<br />
Something light hearted. Something Disney. <br />
<br />
Aziza chose Cruella.  <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Today, as she was walking to a coffee shop during lunch, Kylie couldn&#39;t get a line from the movie out of her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Born brilliant. Born bad. And maybe, a little bit mad&quot;. <br />
<br />
Kylie wouldn&#39;t admit it to Kyle or Aziza, but she related a lot to Cruella de Vil. <br />
<br />
The obsessive, undying thirst for vengeance against those who wronged her. The struggle to control her darker impulses. The histrionic personality. The mood swings. The persistent feeling of loneliness and fear that everyone will abandon you. The possible insanity.  <br />
<br />
Not to mention that Kylie loved the girlboss energy Emma Stone had provided throughout the movie. <br />
<br />
Kylie was definitely going to cosplay as Cruella the next time she went to a convention. <br />
<br />
But she wasn&#39;t sure if having so much in common with one of the most hated  villains of all time was a good thing. <br />
<br />
And it&#39;s not like Kylie had a good history with Disney. <br />
<br />
Back when she was Evil Sorceress Kylie, she had transformed the entire basketball team of Glendale High into Disney princesses, more or less destroying all of their original personalities in the process. <br />
<br />
She had bewitched the boy she had transformed into Princess Jasmine into becoming a full time stripper. <br />
<br />
As far as Kylie knew, Jasmine was still working the poll to this very day. <br />
<br />
Worse, the boy she had transformed into Sleeping Beauty, she had pretty much sexually assaulted. Publicly.<br />
<br />
The immigrant from another dimension shuddered with revulsion as she entered the coffee shop, purchased her caffeine infused chocolatey drink, and as she sipped on it on her way back to Glendale High, she wondered whether she&#39;d really be able to protect Aziza from more kidnapping attempts. <br />
<br />
Kylie Perkins may have had the Glendale Curse, but she was still just a sheltered suburban girl, after all. She wasn&#39;t some tough chick or superhero or whatever.<br />
<br />
Evil Sorceress Kylie could live that life, maybe. After she had taken over Glendale, tons of people tried to kill her pretty much every single day, and she had transformed every single one of those people into something awful, but Kylie was trying really hard not to be that person anymore. <br />
<br />
Just before crossing the street, she felt someone press a wet rag over her face from behind her. She passed out before she could even react. <br />
<br />
Nobody saw a thing. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
When Kylie came to, she realized that she was laying in a queen sized bed. Taking stock of her surroundings, she guessed that she was in a motel room.<br />
<br />
A white man, well built but not a bodybuilder, was sitting in a chair across from her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you...did you chloroform me?&quot; Kylie asked, afraid of this man. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
Kylie wiggled her toes in an attempt to turn this man into a dog or something. <br />
<br />
Kylie didn&#39;t need to wiggle her toes, but that, or wiggling her fingers, or stroking her hair, or other little things like that, helped her focus her magic better.  <br />
<br />
Her powers weren&#39;t working.<br />
<br />
Uh oh. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you planning to murder me?&quot; she asked the man in a casual sort of way. She was trying her best not to panic. <br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you going to rape me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Do I look like a pervert to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...&quot;<br />
<br />
The man chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess a grown man kidnapping a teenage girl does seem sketchy. But I did it for a good reason, I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
A moment of awkward silence passed by. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, are you *positive* this isn&#39;t going to end up with me getting raped and murdered? I saw Megan Is Missing, and I am not ending up getting buried alive in a barrel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not laying a hand on you, Miss Perkins. I have kids of my own, and the things I&#39;d do to anyone who hurt them would make your skin crawl. The thing is, Kylie...can I call you Kylie? Or do you prefer Miss Perkins?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Perkins makes me sound like I&#39;m forty. Call me Kylie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, Kylie, I need you. I know you have the Glendale Curse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kylie&#39;s skin, which was already fair, paled a bit further. <br />
<br />
&quot;I want a lawyer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seth chuckled again. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not a cop, Kylie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;FBI? CIA?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why can&#39;t I use my powers?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Trade secret. Sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seth held up a photo of Aziza from the previous edition of Glendale High&#39;s yearbook. <br />
<br />
&quot;You rescued this girl last night aboard an airplane heading back home to Saudi Arabia. She&#39;s a school mate of yours, correct?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kylie didn&#39;t say anything. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kylie, I&#39;m one of the good guys. I know that someone is trying to force Aziza to detransition against her will. Considering the rate at which transgender teenagers commit suicide or self harm because they aren&#39;t allowed to be themselves, it&#39;s a good bet that Aziza would likely become another statistic. I don&#39;t want that to happen. And since you rescued your friend, I take it you feel the same way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re...you&#39;re not one of Aziza&#39;s kidnappers?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want from me?&quot; Kylie asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to help me take care of a problem, and make sure that your friend is never, ever harassed again.&quot;</p>
