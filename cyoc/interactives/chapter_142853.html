<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emily woke up the next day feeling sore. Her breasts were aching a lot, eager to be milked again, and she just hurt all over, probably from undergoing all these changes so quickly.<br />
<br />
She rolled onto her front and grabbed her phone from the bedside table. It was 3pm. She was meant to be meeting Nate hours ago. He&#39;d bombarded her with texts and calls since 11am. Judging by his last one it seemed like he was still there.<br />
<br />
&#39;Holy shit I slept for 17 hours?!&#39; Emily panicked. She jumped out of bed and immediately went to the bathroom to shower. She quickly washed, and milked her tits enough so they would at least stop screaming at her.<br />
<br />
Emily dried herself off as fast as she could, threw on one of her new bras, and a yellow flowery dress, chucked her essentials in a bag and left the house. She lit up a cigarette as soon as she was out the door, and typed a text out to Nate.<br />
<br />
&#39;im so sorry Nate I overslept. I&#39;m now on my way, I&#39;ll be about 20 mins&#39;.<br />
<br />
Emily was on her third cigarette and about halfway to the farm fair when Nate finally replied.<br />
<br />
&#39;ok&#39; was all it said. &#39;oh god he&#39;s gonna be so pissed with me&#39; Emily thought. She continued to chain smoke the rest of the way without even realising, and finished off her seventh cigarette as she arrived.<br />
<br />
It was now 4pm and the fair was only open to the public for another 30 minutes. A majority of the guests had already left, which meant it shouldn&#39;t be too hard to find Nate, Emily thought.<br />
<br />
She tried calling him but there was no answer, so she started to walk around the show, keeping an eye out for him. She was actually quite surprised at the amount of animals that were on show here. Chickens and roosters, goats and llamas, pigs and sheep and even some that you wouldn&#39;t typically find on farms.<br />
<br />
Emily stopped by one of the pens and tried to call Nate again, but there was still no answer. It was almost half past now, and there were almost no people to be seen, let alone Nate. Emily turned around and was startled by a bull that was in the fenced off area she&#39;d decided to stop by.<br />
<br />
It was just stood up against the fence, staring at her. She made eye contact with it, and found it hard to take her eyes away from it. The bull stood itself up, leaning it&#39;s front legs against the fence, and giving Emily an eyeful of why she had its attention. &#39;Oh god it&#39;s...huge&#39; Emily thought, now unable to take her eyes off it. Her mind started to wander again, picturing herself on all fours, preparing herself to take the whole thing.<br />
<br />
Suddenly her phone went off with a text, snapping her out of it. It wasn&#39;t Nate though, like she was hoping. Emily continued walking towards the next pen, full of cows, as the bull followed her along its fence. It couldn&#39;t follow her any further once she reached the cows, but it still stared at her from a distance.<br />
<br />
She stopped to watch the cows, her mind wandering once more. She was watching them slowly trot around and graze, and despite how dull it was, she wished she could join them.<br />
<br />
Emily looked around. &#39;Well...I could join them. Nobody is around anymore to stop me...&#39;. She started to climb over the wooden fence, feeling immensely turned on by what she was doing. Once she was over, she got on all fours and started eating the grass. Her mind didn&#39;t need to fantasise this time, because she was already living it. Everything felt simpler now, her thoughts of finding Nate slowly slipping away.<br />
<br />
&#39;Why...did I come here again?&#39; she thought, feeling confused. She continued eating the grass though. &#39;Did I just come here to...eat? Yea, that must be it. Mmmm this is good food. I could eat this all day. Need my strength for when I get pregnant. Oh god I could do with a fucking right now&#39;s she decided, and happily carried on eating, becoming more and more aroused.<br />
Suddenly a voice started to break through from the back of her mind. &#39;GET. OUT. OF. THE. PEN.&#39; It screamed at her.<br />
<br />
&#39;Pen...? Fence...I climbed a fence into here&#39; she remembered. Emily trotted over to a fence, and started climbing her front legs up it. Her horniness tried to keep her bent over, but she managed to push through it.<br />
<br />
&#39;Just over this fence...find Nate...have sex&#39; she thought, her memories coming back slightly. Emily struggled, but eventually she toppled over the fence, landing on her back. <br />
<br />
&#39;Okay...free...now find Nate and fuck him&#39; she thought, trying to stand upright. Her arousal finally won out though and her body was forced onto all fours again, locked in place. <br />
She started heading in the direction she thought she came from, but walked into another fence. She decided to follow it until she could go around it, but it met another fence. Emily followed that one, and found herself looking into the cow pen again.<br />
<br />
&#39;I climbed the wrong fence...&#39; she realised.</p>
