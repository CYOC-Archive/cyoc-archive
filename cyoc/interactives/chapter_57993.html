<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">1689 August <br />
<br />
Mal'akh sat with Joella, silently. Mal'Akh knew the execution had to be over by now. She <br />
didn't care about the witches… but she did care an innocent girl like Joella had to suffer <br />
because of their evil whose only crime was loving the witches as they presented themselves <br />
to her. <br />
<br />
There was a knock on the door. Mal'Akh got up and went for the door… and gasped…  <br />
<br />
Joella got up, trying and failing to ignore the cool body of her grandfather… And gasped <br />
too. <br />
<br />
At the front door was a gargoyle… who was her size… A large brown snake with six small <br />
snakes connected to it's sides, and a black haired peach skinned human in clothes too big <br />
for him (The only wearing anything). <br />
<br />
Mal'Akh stepped back in fear. But Joella just stepped foreword… &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are the final gift your mothers could give to you.&quot; Said the gargoyle who was her size. <br />
<br />
&quot;They died trying to give happinesssss to to thissss world… &quot; Said the large multi-<br />
headed/armed snake. <br />
<br />
&quot;We wish only to serve and protect you since your mothers can no longer do so…&quot; Finished <br />
the black haired human. <br />
<br />
Hearing of her mothers' deaths, Joella blinked away tears, but forced a smile and nodded <br />
and quickly hugged the giant serpent who hugged her back with his six 'arms'. <br />
<br />
Upstairs, Lark was the first to awaken, ironically being the most far away from her creators <br />
being the first effected by their deaths. She awoke in the soft warm bed, with no idea she <br />
had been out for over a day and a night. She felt herself itches and ugly rendered herself <br />
back to her true nude 'glory' as she did so, she felt like a hammer had hit her in the back <br />
of the head and she fell to her knees… crying… feeling like some awful had happened… <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;What Lark felt,&quot; Marie-Eliza explained, &quot;Was what Herodias and Lilith felt at the same <br />
time, being a familiar herself ultimately, Lark and the other child familiars were hit <br />
emotionally hard, like any familiar is by the death of the master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;THey would recover right?&quot; Lawrence asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The former mob members? Yes. Since magic had been the midwife in a way to their birth, <br />
they were able to balance out the magic in them much more easily than the affected <br />
children, for whom it would be a longer journey.  And most importantly, while they weren't <br />
leomon cubs, well, most of them, the Witch Pride would die before abandoning a single <br />
one of them. That's why Twilight wouldn't let the pups go with the Wolf Pack without a <br />
blood feud unless she was allowed to go with them. <br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza broke out of her narrative to explain some things in fore-detail, &quot;There was <br />
one part of the curse that Vatican found he couldn't escape… any body he entered would <br />
grow small… quite small… to a Felman what a Felman was to a Human and a Human was <br />
to a Lupman and a Lupman is to a Lemon. Vatican, or Equality as he would ultimately come <br />
to call himself, would in the early years apologize to Joella for this flaw, though he knew <br />
better than to tell his master that it had been her mothers who had cursed him so. He'd <br />
eventuallyshape a form for them that was more visually and emotionally appealing to Joella <br />
for Free to transfer him into … &quot;<br />
<br />
Lawrence pointed out matter of fact, &quot;You said that Joella told them to live their lives as if <br />
they were not under a spell.&quot; <br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza nodded, &quot;I did. But you must understand, while Joella was incapable of being <br />
greedy, cruel, or self serving, due to the very nature of how she was born. She had no <br />
comprehension that the people around her were slaves programmed to obey the witches <br />
without any real question, it was one of the things she didn't learn about her mothers save <br />
of course of the mob turned into children and only because she directly witnessed it.  And <br />
that programming, having taken on a  life all it's own, gaining personhood, it adapted to <br />
the witches' absence by switching their loyalty to Joella… <br />
<br />
And the witches had told their loyal creations to treat Joella with as much respect and <br />
loyalty as they showed the witches, in their own way even more so since the witches were <br />
confident in their ability to protect themselves but knowing Joella didn't have the gift <br />
planted layer up layer of enchantments and commands with more layers than a wedding <br />
cake. All with the single purpose of insuring their desire to protect and serve Joella could <br />
NOT be broken short of killing them like the witches had killed the people they had once <br />
been!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And this meant Joella did not find it alien or strange in the least that some of the hunters <br />
had a change of heart and chose, out of penance she assumed, to join the estate as her <br />
loyal servants like all the rest. She ordered them to live their own lives, since all the death <br />
she had seen had taught her harshly that she wouldn't be around forever. And lived their <br />
own lives they did, but by then, the Dare to serve Joella like she as the second coming had <br />
been engrained itself into their very being!   But of course they also obeyed their master's <br />
order to do more with their lives than simply sit on their rears waiting for her to ask for a <br />
cup of tea. And Death's geass was in full effect, in it's own way, their Dare to serve and <br />
obey Joella without question MERGED with Death's geass, they became even more <br />
determined to build a future for all of the children who had no parents to return to or now <br />
had the gift within them. <br />
<br />
Of course Linus had to hide the fact he was a creature that was not in the least bit human <br />
when helping Marie Cruz try to talk reason into the people of Salem that were persecuting <br />
innocent people… and it made things harder… with being someone who always hissed, <br />
and covered his body so completely… This only added to the rumors he was a warlock.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course that was not the only thing that made things harder… in particular now that <br />
Kathrine couldn't defend herself, AT ALL… she no longer even had the most basic instinct <br />
for survival most living things have when pushed into a corner…  Marie Cruz's Transform <br />
had prevented from either of them from having to kill the other… but it also made Kathrine <br />
a complete and utter sitting duck! A spider with a poisonous bite that she saw on her arm <br />
she couldn't kill!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like someone as without an immune system.&quot; Betty said.<br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza sadly nodded. &quot;She had to have someone with her CONSTANTLY… when <br />
sleeping, when going to the out house, she wasn't forced to kill Marie… but she'd suffer all <br />
the same… And finding out that Marie had cared more about the witches even after all they <br />
had done than her.. that left an emotional scar that would take years if not decades to <br />
heal...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;As for Herodias and Lilith… they would serve Joella as best they could … in spite of <br />
everything… in spite of anything… they had shared their master's vision, Herodias merely <br />
spoke out what the witches in the shadows cast by the back of their minds had already <br />
wanted… to make what was wrong right…  In a way, that was what the symbiotic spirit <br />
spoke to Marie Cruz all those years ago.. but until the witches, that little girl proved <br />
stronger than the dark side that spirit was attracted to. <br />
<br />
<br />
And now their masters were dead… They had FAILED as familiars. That truth struck them <br />
harder than ever. Lilith.. ate herself… for lack of a better word… Herodias watched as the <br />
great red boa slowly consumed herself like an Oroborus. Until there was literally nothing of <br />
her left, like watching a paradox in motion. <br />
<br />
As for Herodias… she'd wander back to the witches manor in a stupor… she'd be found by <br />
Roselia, who'd ultimately make her her hidden familiar bringing things full circle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;But Herodias was at her heart a familiar, and the voice that spoke from the shadow cast <br />
from the back of Roselia's mind was quite different from that of the witches… and so <br />
Herodias by her nature as a familiar took on a new persona… Maybe it was a natural <br />
change, maybe it was a slow death, either way, she was no longer the familiar who had <br />
served Golgatha. And 'Princess''  line continued to provide familiars until the curse <br />
continuing to devour, eat up and gobble up any and other magic in existence to full itself, <br />
made magic on Earth effective impossible. The gargoyles themselves became effected by <br />
this… suffering 'miscarriages' for the first time in their existence's history…Not totally, as <br />
new gargoyles are spawned even today… but now the shadow of fear had crossed over <br />
them. &quot;</p>
