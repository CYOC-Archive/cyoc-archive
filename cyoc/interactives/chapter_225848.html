<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">the three warriors watched as the kingdom continued to grow. &quot;hey wasn&#39;t there a city outside the castle?&quot; Kemo asked. &quot;yes and there is one outside what was the neighborhood&quot; Milo answered. he was extremely worried about his father. if his father was changed then who knows what would happen.  <br />
<br />
the dream version had died to the undead king along with his dream version of his mother. Kemo had taken possession of Melody&#39;s mother&#39;s body. thankfully she was still part of him. As if seeing the worry on his face Elixar put his paw on the dragon&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I feel your worry. sadly there is not much we can do. the dream weaver is quite powerful. however, I will try to break some of its power. maybe then we can stop the hippo man from creating chaos.&quot; he removed his hand and looked outwards.  <br />
<br />
the asphalt of the road broke into carefully laid cobblestone. lamppost soon replaced streetlights as the vegetation began growing larger. the land began to stretch as it became the same distance as Melody&#39;s dreams. &quot;Elixar I would ask you to try to prevent any possibility of the undead king and his army from becoming real.&quot; Milo said as mythological creatures began to appear in the foliage. &quot;hey I know this is a dream becoming reality and stuff but the undead king? the group should&#39;ve given him some name.&quot; Kemo said. his curse making him act Macho again.  <br />
<br />
&quot;we should not name our enemies. doing so would show we acknowledge their evil deeds,&quot; Elixar said while closing his eyes. opening them he spoke once more. &quot;Claire is awakened. She is within the city&quot; They then went down the stairs to the stables.  <br />
<br />
a lion man and a satyr brought out their steeds. While Milo and Elixar had horses Kemo had something different. it was a Grimmboar. a giant feral beast resembling a wild boar with black spikes dotted across its body.  they approached the gate as a Cerberus anthro cranked it open.  <br />
<br />
the three of them rode their beasts down the road to the city. Once they arrived they saw it was almost identical to the city of Kanton. There were modern devices and even some cars. however, it looked like a medieval city had been built generations ago and now had modern equipment. Elixar rode in front leading the band to where Claire resided.  <br />
<br />
they passed humans mythological creatures and anthros. it was just as Melody had imagined it. glancing as he rode Milo noticed everyone was fine with it. &quot;the dream weaver prevents panic. it does so by either making people accept it as normal or altering their minds. with such a strong passionate dream it is most likely the latter&quot; the sorcerer said as he slowed down.  <br />
<br />
they soon found themselves in front of an antique shop. Milo suspected who Claire might have been as they secured their steeds. approaching the door Milo braced himself for what was to come... <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Carl had just sold an old sewing machine to a young lady. he was currently putting the money away when he saw something. outside a knight riding a horse. while it was unusual it was the lizard head that threw him off. quickly he pinched himself and yipped like a fox when he drew blood.  <br />
<br />
As he glanced at his hand the building became more medieval. tons of mystic and ancient artifacts now littered the place. however, he was more interested in his new claws. he watched as his hands slimmed down. pads grew on them before black finger-less gloves covered them.  <br />
<br />
black cloth covered his now thinner arms. his manly body soon took on an hourglass shape as his chest grew. H-cup breasts soon bulged against the dark blue cloth. Carl touched these and was overwhelmed by the sensations he received. his now longer tongue hung from his mouth as he played with them.  <br />
<br />
his age reduced to 17 years old as her penis shrank. She soon pulled her now black pants and shoved her other hand into her dripping pussy. her shoes soon became custom-made so she could move without a sound. her face pushed out into a muzzle a silver blue fur covered it. she brushed her long silver hair into her hood.  <br />
<br />
Finally, large pointed ears poked through the top of her hood. Claire soon came and panted on the floor of the antique shop. She soon heard a ding of a bell as someone entered. &quot;you sure she&#39;s here?&quot; Milo said. glancing over the counter she saw her fellow warriors were there.  <br />
<br />
Elixar was talking to a Minotaur who had just purchased a grindstone for his ax. Milo seemed to look at the shop itself. Kemo struggled but eventually got in the door. for some reason, he seemed more amazing than she had ever thought. &quot;okay so this is his shop. so shouldn&#39;t someone be manning the cash-&quot; Kemo was saying before being tackled.  <br />
<br />
now normally he&#39;d be able to stand his ground. however, he hadn&#39;t been expecting the rogue vixen to tackle him. As such he fell into a pile of artifacts. &quot;oh Kemo you so manly I can&#39;t believe it!&quot; she said. she began kissing him before an idea popped into her head.  <br />
<br />
She aimed her rear right over his now erect cock. Milo and Elixar averted their gaze as she began shoving the tube of flesh as far down as she could. a good amount was still visible but she couldn&#39;t wait anymore. the Minotaur took his leave and the tiger used his magic to lock the door. &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s still a lock,&quot; Milo said.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m aware. however, I was in a bit of a rush.&quot; the mage said as he led the dragon prince away from the two lovebirds. &quot;it seems as though most of your father is gone I&#39;m afraid. some of his personality remains. the love of your mother is one part that remained&quot; he spoke as they reached a series of mirrors along the walls. he then blasted one.  <br />
<br />
the reflection rippled as the hippo man chose to go elsewhere. &quot;sorry for the lack of warning. any might have alerted the creature&quot; he apologized as he checked all the reflections and hiding spots. &quot;so you mentioned this thing is the cause&quot; After getting a nod Milo continued. &quot;so can you tell where this dream weaver came from?&quot;.  <br />
<br />
with a wave of magic from his hand several mirrors lit up. Instead of showing reflections they showed the previous victims. a herm bear kid was sitting on his bed looking at his breasts. from the mirror&#39;s angle, it appeared they were using a monitor to see him/her. next to appear was a cowgirl (an anthro cow) being the center of attention at a high school.  <br />
<br />
this time the mirror had connected to a display case. next was a bull man talking outside a grocery store to a police officer. this time the cop car&#39;s side mirror was what the the mirror connected to. the final mirror connected to one showing a horseman jacking off. the image was quickly cut off before long.  <br />
<br />
&quot;These have the strongest residual magic from the weaver.&quot; Elixar said before pointing at the bear. &quot;this poor soul was the one who dreamt it&quot; he then cut the connection before going to the largest mirror on the wall. using his magic he connected to a mirror inside a house.  a warthog, a hairy man, a rhinoceros centaur and a lion-man were all discussing something. however, they could tell what.   <br />
<br />
&quot;These were the ones before that. From what I can tell there is none before them.&quot; he said before he severed the connection. &quot;well when did they change?&quot; Milo asked. after a sigh Elixar stated, &quot;It was only a few minutes between each time. I suspect now that our changes have concluded the hippo man will find a new target&quot;.  <br />
<br />
&quot;what! Then what should we do?&quot; the prince asked. &quot;that is for you to decide. should we stay here or go? you&#39;re our leader&quot; Elixar said as Kemo and Claire arrived. &quot;so what&#39;s the plan?&quot; Claire asked while stealing a necklace. Milo closed his eyes before opening them up again. a look of determination on his face.</p>
