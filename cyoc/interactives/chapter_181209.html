<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris was seductively unzipping Jay&#39;s pants while Dan and Sean watched in horror that their newly born son was making out with their friend in front of them. Basically, Jay has made all these problems and he didn&#39;t seem regretting at all. So, while he closed his eyes and was feeling his dick being pulled out from his pants, Chris, Dan and Sean stared at each other with a plan in their minds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now!!&quot; Chris shouted while he suddenly pushed Jay to the ground. As fast as they could, Dan and Sean ran to hold him down. Jay was desperately trying to get free but Dan and Sean were too strong for him alone. Meanwhile, Chris was standing up and with a devilish grin on his face he took the Chronivac and started to make some changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing?!!!&quot; Jay yelled at Chris while he fights with his roommates. His former erection was softening and swaying side to side as he struggled. &quot;Well, since I have found out I&#39;m an aberration. I think I could have some fun. You&#39;ll see, both my parents have dicks now, so that makes no sense I&#39;m keeping this hole between my legs. I want to look like a regular guy so...&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris was talking while Jay watched how his slit was closing and a tiny nub grew from above. Then it slowly but continously was enlarging until it looked like a regular dick. 6 inches soft, with no visible veins and a noticeable foreskin covering its glans. &quot;So, that&#39;s how a dick feels!&quot; Chris said while he gently stroke his new shaft. At that time, the skin below his phallus started to loose and get wrinkly. Jay noticed to small marbles descending in them but they swelling until they looked like chicken eggs in mere seconds.<br />
<br />
Chris gentle stroking has become more intense and aggressive. He was holding a 10 inches monster with a hand while he used the other to massage his newly grown testicles. His moans was starting to make everyone uncomfortable, including his parents who had watched their son growing a manhood bigger than theirs. &quot;This is sooo good!&quot; Chris said between his moans before he reached his climax and released his first dose of manmilk. &quot;I can&#39;t believe I was missing that experience. Being a man is great!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know if I must be proud or disturbed.&quot; Dan said as he was still getting used to have a son his age and that his best friend was the other father. &quot;But I&#39;m certainly sure our little friend Jay needs to learn to respect other men&#39;s jewels. Don&#39;t you think so, Chris?&quot; After hearing that, Jay immediately realized what&#39;s going to happen next, what they have planned for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course dad. I&#39;ve already set it in the program.&quot; Chris started to take Jay&#39;s pants off while he desperately tried to kept them on. &quot;Oh, don&#39;t be shy now, Jay. We all here are men, don&#39;t we? My dad Sean and I are naked too and we don&#39;t felt ashamed of our bodies.&quot; With Jay&#39;s pants completely discarded, his still existing manhood was freely moving as he struggled. Unlike Sean or Chris, Jay wasn&#39;t a hairless guy and his hairy legs and dense bush on his crotch were on display. &quot;You&#39;ll be an interesting pussyboi with that much hair on your body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please no!! Please!! Don&#39;t do it!! DON&#39;T!!&quot; Jay protested but nobody cared about it. Sean, Dan and Chris were completely interested in watching Jay&#39;s dick going reverse in puberty. It was so funny seeing it shrinking from his proudly 10 inches to 7, 4, 2, 1 and finally nothing. At the same time, his balls slurped inside him and his loose hairy scrotum were tightening and merging with his crotch. For a brief moment, Jay was just a nullo but that soon changed when a slit began to open between his wild bush of pubes. Several labias were forming in there until Jay has a completely normal and functional pussy between his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;How does it feel bitch?&quot; Sean asked Jay. &quot;It&#39;s not that funny when it happens to you, right?&quot; He immediately put two fingers inside Jay&#39;s new hole and violently played with it. Jay was feeling so much new things that he screamed in pain and pleasure at the same time. &quot;You&#39;re a fucking aberration now!!&quot; Dan said as he took his turn to finger Jay&#39;s pussy. &quot;You deserve this for making me fuck another man!!&quot; Jay kept screaming while he felt new fluids coming out from his vagina.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... feel... empty...&quot; Jay managed to say. He was panting exhausted. He can&#39;t feel more humiliated. He was the one with a pussy now. &quot;We can fix that.&quot; Chris replied with a smile. &quot;I want to use my tool with a vag and yours seems fine. Call me freak, but even those pubes are turning me on!&quot;</p>
